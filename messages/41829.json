He looks at Shivah. &quot;Don&#39;t answer that comm yet.&quot;\n\nThe commander looks over his left shoulder. &quot;Scyther.&quot; His spy slowly materializes to the left of him, looking at him and ready for orders. He&#39;d already predicted half of Killfest&#39;s plan.\n\n&quot;Yes?&quot;\n\nWithout answering Scyther, Killfest looks over at Shivah. &quot;Is there any way to leave the base right now?&quot; he asks, &quot;I&#39;m going to send Scyther out to scout. He&#39;ll be undetectable. Meanwhile, you set up a transmission blocker to block everything but yours and that Maximal&#39;s transmissions. We capture the two inside, if he&#39;s lying and they&#39;re really inside, and hold them for &#39;negotiations&#39;. Scyther will determine if the one outside is alone. If yes, he can kill him or capture him. Meanwhile, have your troops search for any bombs in the base while you keep talking and distracting him.&quot;\n\nHe waits for Shivah&#39;s opinion. To him, it was a good plan.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine was at an extreme disadvantage. A Predacon army in an impenetrable\n&gt; fortressversus a single bot with a bunch  of dummies. (Classic John Wayne\n&gt; senario.) &quot;You&#39;ll have to come out to get it Predacon.&quot; he said calmly\n&gt; knowing that the Preds had as much trapped themselves inside the Black\n&gt; Fortress as kept him out. &quot;And if you fail to produce Silver Scout I&#39;ll have\n&gt; all my friends reduce you to rubble.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; One bluff had led to another, now all there was to do was add the final\n&gt; touch. &quot;I hate to inform you that the signals you picked up inside were\n&gt; faked, We had a unit slip in, plant explosives all through your base and\n&gt; slip out unnoticed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the Black fortress Foxfingers and Razor Claw stood helplessly huddled\n&gt; beneath Razor Claw forcefield. Lunarpines message broadcast loud and clear\n&gt; to thier comms. A pannel opened on Foxfingers wrist and the thief pressed in\n&gt; a sequence that set off one of the charges he&#39;d planted near the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a sudden BOOM that sent debris into the lava pit surrounding the\n&gt; Fortress.\n&gt; &quot;That should get thier attention.&quot; Foxfingers comments chuckling the whole\n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine smiled as his scanners picked up the explosion. &quot;They&#39;re alive,&quot;\n&gt; he thought to himself, &quot;I should&#39;ve known not to doubt them. He returned his\n&gt; concentration to his comm, &quot;THAT could&#39;ve been the top sections of your\n&gt; base.&quot; He paused to let the Preds think for a moment. &quot;That WILL be the top\n&gt; sections of your base if I don&#39;t start seeing some compromises on your\n&gt; part.&quot; He closed the line cutting off the conversation, The ball was in the\n&gt; Predacons court now. If there was a civilized answer they would have to\n&gt; reopen the line to talk.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 14, 2001 11:52 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Ender/Mutants/Waitting/Blaze/Silverscout\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shivah/Seven-batp robes::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Then you have gave me some reasons to kill her: first. your friends\n&gt; &gt; and you was allies of MAximals and we&#39;re mortal enemies to maximals.\n&gt; &gt; Second. you sent your spies and like spies they will die... if they\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t death right now.&quot;said Shivah &quot;and you INTRUDER, I you have\n&gt; &gt; three seconds to decide you fate and Silverscout&#39;s, gave me that\n&gt; &gt; antivirus and she and you won&#39;t die today!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The bats probes, who were outside scanning Lunarpine&#39;s signature\n&gt; &gt; hidding around the area, letting the externals defences of\n&gt; &gt; BlackFortress imed against him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (according to the sensors Foxfingers and Razor Claw already had a\n&gt; &gt; miserable death, Foxfingers is useing a dampening field to make them\n&gt; &gt; invisable to the scanners.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine answered Shivahs comment with &quot;You&#39;re partly right, I was\n&gt; &gt; at one point a Maximal, now my loyalties are to my friends as an\n&gt; &gt; independant.&quot; he knew he was pushing his luck but he&#39;d always been\n&gt; &gt; stubborn enough to push until it pushed back. &quot;As for the anti-virus,\n&gt; &gt; it is ours and will remain with us until we see Silver Scout exit.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He knew it was in the Predacons best interests to keep Silver Scout\n&gt; &gt; alive, especially if any Preds were infected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: Airshadow Nightlight\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Monday, August 13, 2001 12:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Ender/Mutants/Waitting/Blaze/Silverscout\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Shivah said to Ender &quot;Over that factions (Alliance and\n&gt; &gt; Destrons) who are the best to get an alliance? &quot;after that the male\n&gt; &gt; opend his comm link to Blaze and Silverscout &quot;Blaze and Silverscout,\n&gt; &gt; go to area 23&quot; and looking to Drillbit &quot;As soon as I end to deal with\n&gt; &gt; this pest, we can continue our businness &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Shiva opened com link with Lunarpine &quot;Why don&#39;t you give us\n&gt; &gt; the anti-virus and later we can chat about Silverscout?  if you don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; do it I will kill her together your two friends that I&#39;ve have in my\n&gt; &gt; hands&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       BlackFortress External defences turned on and aimed to\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine; the room where Razor Claws and Foxfingers were, the acyd\n&gt; &gt; level started to increase.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       &quot;I&#39;ve told you Lunarpine of MAximals -Yes I know that you\n&gt; &gt; have been in Maximal base due that I give you that name&quot; said\n&gt; &gt; Shivah &quot;I told you that I haven&#39;t humour this day, unless you give me\n&gt; &gt; that antivirus to cure Silverscout...
