Leave now and await Zardus&#39; \ndemands.  It&#39;s the only way you will get your Maximal comrades back...alive.  \nYou&#39;ll attack, but to brake through our defenses, hull, and forces just to \nget to them, will cost you dearly and take over a mega-cycle.  And by then, \nwell, we have seven people guarding the Maximals and they can open fire \nanytime I give the order.  \n    So, either back off, or they die and you are weakened even more.  It&#39;s \nyour choice.  Either way, the Alliance is gonna have FUN TONIGHT!~ Nemesis \ndeactivated the intercom.\n\n&quot;Bravo!  Bravo!  Let&#39;s hope they attack.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?  There is a probability they could win.&quot;\n\n&quot;So we can watch the base blow up and see the Maximal corpses!&quot;\n\n&quot;What!&quot; Punch yelled to Scattershot and Nemesis Enforcer.  &quot;If Zardus came \nback and saw his base...nothing but flaming rubble...he&#39;d hunt us down like \ndogs!&quot;\n\n&quot;Maybe, but he&#39;d have to beat us!&quot; Scattershot laughed, throwing his head \nback in laughter, DeathStorm&#39;s head sliding off his head, hitting the ground.\n&quot;Slag!&quot; he picked up the head and put it back on, getting to the sensors.\n\n"}}
