But when she suddenly got up and walked over to the corner again \nIron Raptor sighed and shook her head, the fembots actions drawing more \nsympathy from her.\nShe looked over towards the open door and a smile came across her face, glad \nas ever to see who was standing there.\nIron Raptor sighed again and shook her head at the shaking fem, knowing that \nshe didn�t just trust anybot. *\n\n� Don�t worry. He�s on our side.�\n\n* She spoke with a smile to prove herself right, gesturing towards Prowl \nwith her thumb. But then her optics narrowed and she looked towards him \nwithout turning her head. *\n\n� Even if he IS a bit ugly.�\n\n* The smile remained on her lips, and she knew that Prowl would get her back \nfor that later. Iron Raptor then looks at Feline with a reassuring \nexpression on her face, letting her know that it was all right to sit back \ndown. But then she thought of something that might calm the femm, gesturing \ntowards Prowl. *\n\n� Feline. This is Prowl, our military strategist and field soldier. Prowl. \nFeline, a new bot to the Maximal forces.�\n\n* She finished with a gesture towards the fembot. Just hoping that this \nwould ease the fear that Feline felt, even if just a bit. *\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
