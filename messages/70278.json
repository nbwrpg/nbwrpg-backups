My Cr. I need\n&gt; to reach there... I need your help Cyclonus... What had happened with that\n&gt; treacherous rat and with our prisioners... what happened with the primes?&quot;\n\nCyclonus stepped over to Hydras and carefully helped him to his feet.\n&quot;Tuscon has escaped, as well as the other Maximals.&quot; Cyclonus said\nsorrowfully. &quot;Rodimus . . . I am not sure.&quot;\n\nCyclonus paused as he looked over Hydras&#39; injuries as best he could,\n&quot;As for Perceptor.&quot; Cyclonus paused again as he looked at Hydras, not\nsure how exactly he felt about the Predacon scientist, &quot;Perceptor\nlooked to be siding with Rodimus. When we found him he was in\nconversation with him, as if planning something.&quot;\n\nCyclonus continued to help Hydras, &quot;There was an explosion, it looked\nlike one of Perceptors&#39;.  That was how the bots escaped. The explosion\nblocked us from reaching Tuscon and the others. I absorbed what I\ncould of it, but I don&#39;t know.&quot; Cyclonus shrugged painfully, the\nextent of his own injuries showing themselves.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t see any sign of Rodimus after that, although the explosion\nopened up the tunnel that Scorponok had used to tunnel over here\nseveral months ago from the Ark.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
