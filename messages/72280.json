The battle of Tuscon against Rodimus will not come\nyet, but I have no problem with Tuscon being able to check that out\nwhen that time does come.\n\nAnd have no fear, one way or another the truth will come out as to\nwhich one the clone really is. But one thing I will say is that BOTH\nrenditions of Rodimus looks, acts, walks and talks enough like Rodimus\nthat even Nightlight cannot tell the difference, or Elita if she were\nhere.\n\nSo is the fake Rodimus the red/orange made to throw off the Maximals\nor is the black one the fake?\n\nStay tuned for the revelation coming to a computer near you soon!\n\nI will post, it will just be slower, not as much stuff in each one,\nand I may miss some of the posts :)\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 9/20/11, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I know you may not be able to post for a while but I was wondering\n&gt; If we could use the battle between Rodimus and Tucson as the match\n&gt; where Tucson&#39;s suspicion of a clone proves correct.  The only way he would\n&gt; know for sure is if Dark Rodimus&#39;s spark chamber gets knocked open during\n&gt; the fight.  In order to do that I was wondering if you would allow Tucson to\n&gt; get in a few good hits as he too can take a few of his own.  I fully allow\n&gt; for Tucson to take a beating and I was wondering if you would allow the same\n&gt; for Dark Rodimus.  And you get to chose which mode they fight in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also , whoever else he&#39;s put up against, which could very well be a fellow\n&gt; comrade, he will explain his strategy via silent com and inform them that\n&gt; he&#39;s playing the part to be strategic.   He has to make it look real if he\n&gt; is going to attempt to fool Magmatron, which is going to be an ulitimate\n&gt; challenge of wisdom.  When you can&#39;t beat them you can at least act as if\n&gt; you&#39;re going to join them.  And all is well if you can pull off the\n&gt; deception carefully.  Tucson realizes he can not defeat Magmatron in a one\n&gt; on one but, he can find a way around him.  He will definitely gather troops\n&gt; on all sides for the fight against Magmatron, including the Preds and\n&gt; Decepticons who are also annoyed with Magmatron.  I will send Airly a\n&gt; message about that and see what she thinks, but only after I hear from you.\n&gt; That&#39;s it for now.  Happy writing.  ^^\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
