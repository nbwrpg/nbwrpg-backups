Raising both pinches, \nDouble Punch fired two missiles at Striker&#39;s side, and two missiles at \nUltracon.\n\n---\n\nManterror returned, seeing Ramulus.  &quot;HOLY SLAG!  IMPOSSIBLE!&quot; he screamed, \nleaping from the foilage, attempting to tackle the person he had &quot;bravely&quot; \nkilled a while back.  \n\n---\n\nRamhorn got up, firing two laser blasts from his pistol at Mosquitor&#39;s back.\n\n"}}
