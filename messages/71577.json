By instinct he curls up \n=\r\n  his front and hind legs as&lt;br&gt;&gt; he gets higher in the air. The higher =\r\nhe \n  gets the more draft he experiences&lt;br&gt;&gt; until he is able to soar o=\r\nn \n  outstretched wings without beating them. He&lt;br&gt;&gt; holds his long nec=\r\nk out \n  straight and uses his long tail as a rudder which&lt;br&gt;&gt; keeps hi=\r\nm perfectly \n  balanced in the air.
