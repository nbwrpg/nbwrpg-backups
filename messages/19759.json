She turned and looked around.  She saw a \nmouse and smiled.  She wanted to hunt. &quot;Well, if you two want to talk \na while...I&#39;ll be right.&quot;  She turned and dashed off after the \nmouse.  She ran threw the thickets and under the tall bushes.  She \nran around the tall trees and under a few fallen logs.  She made a \nmad leap and pounced on the mouse.  She looked at it in her paws and \nsmiled.  &quot;Hah! Caught ya.&quot;  She smiled as the mouse struggled trying \nto get away.  She picked up the mouse and was about to eat it when \nshe thought about the mouse. Maybe this mouse had a family to take \ncare of. She sighed and looked at the mouse. &quot;Today is your lucky day \nrodent.&quot; She let the mouse go and watched it scurry off. She sighed \nand started to walk back to the others.  She looked around and saw \nnothing but trees all around. She couldn&#39;t find the trail that she \nhad taken to get to this point. So sighed and muttered,&quot;Oh yeah, he&#39;s \ngoing to skin me alive this time.&quot;  She sniffed around and tried to \nfollow her nose back to where she was.  She followed a path that \nlooked like it was cut out of the forest, but a long time ago and had \ngrown over a bit.  She walked along and made her way slowly through \nthe forest. Her childlike curiosity was getting the better of her.  \nShe kept going until she came up to a strange cave. She walked inside \nand looked around.  It was dark, but there was a hole in the top that \nlet in some light.  She smelled the smell of old death inside the \ncave. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;       &quot;Is there something you&#39;re not telling us?
