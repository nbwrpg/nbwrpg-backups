He instead turned to the closest base, which, as far as he could \ntell, was a Maximal base.  He moved to his new route he,and trucked \nalong, for hours on end.  A few hours later he was a kilometer, and \ndecide to stop and let the occupants of the base come to him, he \ndidn&#39;t want start on their bad side.  So instead, he entertained \nhimself, in his beast mode, with the trivial plants and animals on \nprehistoric Earth.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; A craft, appearently Minicon, flew over the bounty hunter.
