He sent a knee into Defensor&#39;s abdomen, \nthe grip on his neck loosening greatly and the punches stopping.  \n\n---\n\nDefensor let out a yell of pain as the numerous laser blasts he was pushed \ninto seared into his armored form.  The hit to the abdomen hurt as well, and \nhe eased his grip on his opponents neck, trying to cope with the pain.  \nAnother knee to the abdomen hurt even more, and he let out a grunt of pain.\n\n---\n\nDark Wolf raised his sword, firing off a missile blade into a side of the \nCybertronian Fire, followed up by three rapid optic blasts.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer picked up Angel Prime and Prowl on his scanners.  &quot;Heh heh.&quot; \nhe chuckled (in a laugh similar to the thespian Christopher Lambert&#39;s), \nflying forward at top speed, the ball of energy form Angel Prime missing. \n\nNemesis moved the launcher to the side, firing off a rocket at Prowl.  He \nthen lifted his head up, firing off ten rapid optic blasts up at Angel Prime.\n\n---\n\nScattershot watched with interest.  &quot;Myah, ganging up on the man, eh?  \nWhere&#39;s your Messiah now, myah?&quot; he raised his rifle, firing off twenty-five \nexplosive rounds at Angel Prime&#39;s knees.\n\n---\n\nVehement raised both arms, firing off two energy-signature seeking missiles \nat Hot Rod, one heading for his chest, the other his left knee.\n\n==\n\nChordate felt the CF shake, and checked the scanners.  &quot;Hull at 76%.&quot; he said \naloud.  \n\n"}}
