So I \n&gt; &gt; decided to wait, wait until I know if would be needed my \n&gt; &gt; intervention... at first I consider influence her... bur she&#39;s \nwake, \n&gt; &gt; wake and afraid to hurt some one even if her live is at risk... \nhHer \n&gt; &gt; reaction after destroy that Unicron&#39;s minion confirmed that... \nSO I \n&gt; &gt; decided that it&#39;s time that I do something and took control of \nher \n&gt; &gt; and insolate her spark, it was pretty easy: she was emotionaly \n&gt; &gt; exausted...
