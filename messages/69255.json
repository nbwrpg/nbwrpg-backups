Along the way the \nteam\n&gt; can s=\r\nee more of the scorched and burned walls, some of the structure\n&gt; of it has=\r\n been ripped away from support struts, metal twisted and\n&gt; strewn everywher=\r\ne. However this damage, unlike the damage found near\n&gt; the front door appea=\r\nrs to old, as rust has set into exposed metal\n&gt; surfaces. \n&gt; \n&gt; As the grou=\r\np arrives in the command center, bodies of full sized\n&gt; Autobots and Decept=\r\nicons are littering the floor: Optimus Prime,\n&gt; Megatron, Soundwave, Prowl =\r\nand Jazz, all of them still possessing\n&gt; their Cybertronian modes. \n&gt; \n&gt; Fr=\r\nom under one of the control panels Lord Elder&#39;s legs stick out at \nan\n&gt; odd=\r\n angle. &quot;That&#39;s got it.&quot; Lord Elder says, his voice muffled, yet\n&gt; satisfie=\r\nd as the alarms shut off. \n&gt; \n&gt; Climbing out from the panel Lord Elder look=\r\ned almost surprised to \nsee\n&gt; Salveo&#39;s team, or perhaps it was their battle=\r\n ready posture. &quot;OH!&quot; \nhe\n&gt; exclaimed as he activated the main view screen.=\r\n &quot;You thought there \nwas\n&gt; some sort of a battle.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the view screen=\r\n what appears to be a black and crimson weapons\n&gt; satellite is floating hig=\r\nh in the air, overlooking the debris of\n&gt; sweeps that are all over the grou=\r\nnd. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder pointed at the screen, &quot;That&#39;s just . . . ummm . . .\n&gt;=\r\n Legacy.
