I am \nnot sure if you will recieve this message since My clock keeps switching \ntimes, this anomaly doesnt only affect space it effects time as well. I feel \nmy time to exit this worm hole of sorts has come. I have crashed on a planet. \nThe being here are friendly and have given me shelter. They say a large ship \ncrashed here about a year earlier leading me even more towards the thought \nthat the tripreds are here. They have been causing these people great pain and \nI intend to try anything to stop them.\nMagnus\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat was unaware of the bot&#39;s approach untill it was right next to \n&gt; her.  She couldn&#39;t quite get her optics to focus properly.  She \n&gt; checked her energy levels. In a few hours, her energy cells would be \n&gt; empty. She decided to not fight and spend the energy unless \n&gt; nessassary.  She whispered, &quot;Kit....KitKat.&quot; She was about to ask \n&gt; the bot a question when the exposed wires in her shoulder  sparked \n&gt; and she cried out in pain.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: If something it&#39;s wrong with this post I&#39;ll repost\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor poped up near Kitkat and shut down the distress \n&gt; signal &quot;i \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like that any one alse comes, it could be an unpleasant \n&gt; &gt; company&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and tooking at Kitkat in arms, he walked towards predacons&#39; base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking to the femme, he said &quot;Do you have a name?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
