She \nknew the Fox wasn&#39;t just because he was silly enough to try to fight \na wolf. Megatron would have informed his crew member of her modes. \n\nShe thought it would be better to show him and Aracnia what she had.\n&quot;Megatron, you know your the hardest bot to give a gift to? I will \nnot discuss any such topic in the open. If you wish to talk, we will \nhave to go inside.Aracnia, please join us.&quot;  She motioned they go \ninside.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: sorry Yanshosh about cutting out of the convo so soon, my \ncomputer \n&gt; crashed and i had to reinstall AOL.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia looked to the group around Kitkats base. It was \nMegatrons \n&gt; goons....the expendable team as she recalled.
