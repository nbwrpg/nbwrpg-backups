She could feel her form moving and changing.\n&gt; It was about 60% complete.  Her body was was becoming covered with\n&gt; soft, white fur. Her wings were growing and were a soft gray that\n&gt; lighted up to white at the tips.  She stood there wondering why\n&gt; Lunarpine hadn&#39;t come back for her. She leaned against the table and\n&gt; closed her eyes. She tried to picture in her mind where Lunarpine\n&gt; was. She could almost feel his presence, but not see him.  She tried\n&gt; to hear his thoughts, but couldn&#39;t.  She sighed and lowered her\n&gt; head. &quot;I can not find him. I don&#39;t know why, but I can&#39;t connect with\n&gt; him.&quot; She looked up at Veratis, sorrow was in her eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis stared at the form before him. It was large and powerful.\n&gt; The best\n&gt; &gt; part was that it still wasn&#39;t completely finished. &quot;Shadow Wing you\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; truly becoming a beautiful creature. So graceful yet so powerfull.&quot;\n&gt; He was\n&gt; &gt; still astonished at what she turned out to be. &quot;Lunarpine still\n&gt; hasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; returned and I can&#39;t communicate with him.&quot; He was wondering if her\n&gt; &gt; telepathy was still there or if it had stopped with her\n&gt; completion.&quot; Do not\n&gt; &gt; worry my dear, everything will be fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
