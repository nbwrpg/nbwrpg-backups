It was heavily muted and only good for\n&gt; short range=\r\n, perhaps 40 or 50 meters. Actually better than what they\n&gt; were getting be=\r\nfore, which was virtually nothing past 10 meters.\n&gt; \n&gt; However having said =\r\nthat there was still no trace of HYDRAS. If he was\n&gt; still alive, he was ou=\r\nt of sensor range.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAn improvemewnt in scanning range in the dens=\r\ne jungle underbrush was still useless, given that if they were to come in u=\r\nnder assault by the time an opponent was charging them they might get a res=\r\nposne from it.  But still, it was less negligbly useless than before.\n\nFor =\r\nthe moment, using WASPINATOR to calibrate, BLACKARACHNIA was able to determ=\r\nine that HYDRAS was nowhere in the vicinity, with a muttered sense of the C=\r\nYBERTRONIAN language equivalent of &#39;No Slag NIghtbeat&#39; going through her pr=\r\nocessor.\n\nAnd she listened to the commentary tossed out by CRYOTEK with ext=\r\nreme interest now.  He had a point.\n\nAnd who else had an unknown connection=\r\n to Unicron..\n\nBut Tarantalus?\n\nOOC - Beast Wars wasn&#39;t specific on that, b=\r\nut it was directly stated in the Convention Comics he was a creation of Uni=\r\ncron, to an unknown degree.

The tunnel walls a=\r\nre made completely of stone and\n&gt; rock and, at least at this point, look na=\r\ntural. There was still no\n&gt; trace of HYDRAS as they went down. However the =\r\ninteresting thing was\n&gt; that the lower they went the shorter their transpon=\r\nder signal became.\n&gt; Whatever it was they were going into, the interference=\r\n on their\n&gt; com-links and transponders was getting stronger.\n&gt; \n\nThere was =\r\na thought of contemplation in the tunnels from VICE GRIP.  &quot;There&#39;s some so=\r\nrt of jamming boundary or interference zone the deeper we go, the less rang=\r\ne we have.&quot;\n\nWondering if there was a lower &#39;sheathe&#39; to the jamming zone, =\r\nhe attempted to use his commsignal to try and &#39;bounce&#39; back the signal, as =\r\nif using echolocation to try an dsee if he could locate the &#39;bottom&#39; of it,=\r\n in any sense of the word.\n\n\n\n"}}
