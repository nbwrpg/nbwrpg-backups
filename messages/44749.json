He squinted, trying to look around, as his optics\nslowly came on line. &quot;Whe...where in great cybertron am I?&quot; asked the\nsmall red autobot, as he wearily walked out of his cell. \n\nThen yellow arm grabbed him from behind, grabing onto his neck. &quot;That&#39;s\na good question Autopunk.&quot; an obnoxious voice shouted, as the Stunticon\nknown as Drag Strip pulled Cliffjumper in, getting ready to smash him\nwith his other fist. Cliffjumper quickly went to his knees, then using\nthe larger robots own momentum, stood up quickly sending the Stunticon\ninto a wall with a large thud. Two other robots ran out of the cell,\nWildrider and Breakdown. \n\n&quot;Why you little, no one does that to the Drag Strip, except Wildrider.&quot;\nthe crazed grey robot shouted as he ran towards Cliffjumper. Cliffjumper\nwas still trying to recover from the shock, as his instincts did the\nwork for him. He gracefully leapt backwards, onto Drag Strip, then used\nthe suicidal racer as a catapult to launch himself straight into\nWildrider, shoulder first, sending them both barreling into Breakdown,\nas they fell in a crumbled mess against another wall. Cliffjumper pulled\nhimself up, trying to shake loose the screws in his head, when he his\nsuddenly jerked several feet into the air, being held by a powerful\nlarge greay fist, almost totally encircling his head. Cliffjumper then\nbegins to flail his body in an attempt to escape. \n\n&quot;Let me go Motormaster, you big freak, and i&#39;ll shove your cylinders\ndown your throat module.&quot; \n\nMotormast stood in the doorway with no emotion on his face at all,\nsimply holding Cliffjumper up easily with one hand. &quot;Shut up Squirt.&quot;\nEchoed Motormaster&#39;s hollow and gruff voice. He then began to slowly\nincrease pressure around Cliffjumper&#39;s head.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrimlock simply followed Sinew.\n\n"}}
