Heh also it is going to be fired \nway far between times. Likely an OOC \nmonth or so before another time its \nfired if it is fired again at all. \n\n  o Pretty cool(so long as it isnt used to blow up one base after the other) \n  o It sucks \n  o I guess it could work if it wasn&#39;t fired at every base every single day and its on an extremely rare occasion that it is fired? \n  o Its iffy... \n  o Whee!!! \n\n\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/polls \n\nNote: Please do not reply to this message.
