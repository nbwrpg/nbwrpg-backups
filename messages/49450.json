It isn&#39;t that the chair is poorly designed - it&#39;s just that \nshe&#39;s much too big for it.  Usually the giant Rogue works in the \nengine room, where her size is less of a hinderance and more of an \nasset.  But given the lack of able-bodied crew, she&#39;s needed on the \nbridge.\n\n&quot;See any good landing spots yet, folks?&quot; she asks the other two \nRogues in the room.\n\n&quot;Nothing worth mentioning,&quot; Torin remarks from the piloting station.  \n&quot;Looks to me like a matter of personal preference.&quot;\n\n&quot;How about there?&quot;  Jayde points out an area in the southernmost part \nof the mountains.  (Unknown to them just yet, this is within easy \ntravelling distance of the Predacon base.)  It&#39;s a rather comical \nsight, because Jayde is the smallest Rogue, and looks much like a \ntoddler compared to the 12&#39; Gatara.\n\n&quot;Worth a shot,&quot; Torin sighs.  &quot;It&#39;s sheltered, out of the way - and \nRiekan just informed me over the comm that the engines are gonna quit \non us soon.&quot;\n\nGatara is momentarily irritated that Riekan didn&#39;t page HER with that \nmessage, but given the situation, she&#39;s willing to forgive it this \ntime.  &quot;Do it,&quot; she orders.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The damage report was not encouraging.  Although its quarry had \n&gt; escaped the energy storm&#39;s wrath, Rogue Star had not.  Now most of \n&gt; its crew was in a comatose state, and repairs were sorely needed.  \n&gt; After examining the situation, the conscious Rogues chose to land \non \n&gt; the most suitable landmass - the large northern continent.  And so \n&gt; the Rogue Star, hidden under its powerful cloaking device, began to \n&gt; descend ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, in the storage room that doubled as her sleeping \nquarters, \n&gt; another transformer was busy moping.  There wasn&#39;t much else to \ndo.  \n&gt; A prisoner by another name, Phoenix hated the Rogues and all that \n&gt; they stood for, but was too terrified to do anything about it.  \nShe&#39;d \n&gt; been conditioned over the course of nine stellar cycles to cower \naway \n&gt; from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not to mention, she hated violence in any form even more than she \n&gt; despised her captors.  Phoenix had no idea where her strong beliefs \n&gt; came from, but she knew it had to have something to do with the \n&gt; memory engrams the Rogues had destroyed before her eyes, in the \n&gt; earliest event she could recall clearly.\n\n\n"}}
