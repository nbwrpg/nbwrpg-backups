The nine foot robot raised \nboth of his arms in the air.\n\n&quot;The Evil One smiles upon us today as our Brothers move in on the Maximal \nprison deep within the Cybertronian province of Polyhex!  We shall free over \ntwo hundred convicts, twenty-eight of them imprisoned members of our \nBrotherhood.  We estimate over fifty of the others shall join our righteous \ncause, and help us crush the heathens!&quot;\n\nA roar of cheering erupted from the crowd of over seventy robots in front of \nhim, Maximal and Predacon alike.\n\n&quot;For the Evil One!&quot;\n\n&quot;FOR THE EVIL ONE!&quot; the crowd roared.\n\n&quot;I sha--&quot; Vehement looked up as several figures smashed through the glass \nwindow, all on ropes with laser rifles in hand.  &quot;Heathens!  Kill them!&quot; \nVehement said as he reached into his robe, producing a laser pistol.  \nPointing the barrel at one of the robots on a rope, he fired off a few bolts, \nlaughing as the robot crashed to the ground in the middle of the crowd.\n\nVehement took off at a run as the other robots on ropes landed on the ground, \nopening fire at the armed members of the crowd.\n\n---\n\nVehement ran passed several members of his Brotherhood, getting into a room \nfull of screens, a few robots looking at them.\n&quot;Status report?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not good, Archbishop Vehement.  Our forces are losing.  Maximals are pouring \ninto all sections of the base.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah.  I see.&quot; Vehement said, raising his pistol, firing off several bolts.  \nHe laughed as the bodies hit the ground.  Reaching into subspace, he produced \na black square charge, tossing it in the middle of the room and walking out.  \nHe sighed as the device exploded, erupting the entire room in flames.\n\nHe walked on as a few Brotherhood members ran by him, heading for the flaming \nmess, a few of them calling out to him.\n\n"}}
