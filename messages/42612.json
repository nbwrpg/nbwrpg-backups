She had been on the planet \nsince the arrival of the first transformers. Her maximal form had \nbeen suspended in a half bot, half artic fox mode.  Her proccesses in \nbecoming a maximal had only been half complete. The change proccesses \nhad not been able to finish the transformation. Her bot form looked \nmore like a rotting corpse with animal pelt hanging off it than a \nwhat it was intended to look like. And untill now, her pod had been \nburied under tons of snow and ice. Now, for the first time, the ice  \nwas giving way.  CRASH!  A large chunk of ice broke off from the  \nglacier and fell into the cold sea of the north pole. Her pod, still \nentombed in the ice, floated along as part of a very large iceberg. \nDrifting lazily with the sea&#39;s currents, the pod&#39;s distress becon \nbeeped on. Extremely faint, but the becon could be picked up if the \nbot were only a few miles away. \n\n\n"}}
