It has been \n&gt; such a long time since fuel and smoke filled his sensory receptors. He \n&gt; stood for a few seconds to enjoy it. He then stepped out of Cyclonus \n&gt; and walked towards the Hill Motormaster had positioned himself at. \n&gt; &quot;Excellent Motormaster&quot; Megatron commended him. As soon as Motormaster \n&gt; noticed Megatron there he stood to attention and saluted him. He then \n&gt; elbowed Dead-End, who was nearest, to do the same. &quot;Stand down&quot; he \n&gt; told them. He walked up to the peak of the hill, and scanned the \n&gt; battle field for Shockwave.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
