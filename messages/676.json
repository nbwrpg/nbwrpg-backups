His laugh was a little un-nerving. \nWhat he said about Black Archnia didn&#39;t sound too realistic to him right \nnow. And how did he know he had an affection over her? Love wasn&#39;t on his \nmind, it was how the was going to get used to this and who he was going to \nsettle down with as ally.\n\nHe turned his head back to the stick on his foreclaw. He guestured to \nTransulas for his favor with the two foot long leaf that he was going to use \nto tie down the brace. He hoped that he would tie it down too. He knew he \nwas going to have a fit with it.\n\n&quot;Where are we&#39;s goin&#39;?&quot; he added.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
