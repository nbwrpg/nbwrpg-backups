She saw the mech fluid and the parts laying\n&gt; there. &quot;Why did you do this Death? Why? I thought he was a loyal\n&gt; follower in the group. I though....&quot; She stopped and looked at\n&gt; Death.&quot;You said you killed a bot who was a traitor to us all. I will\n&gt; have to ask that you prove it.  We may be predacons, but I need every\n&gt; bot available.  We will need everyone when we take up our major\n&gt; challenge.  But untill then, yes, you make analyze what ever you want\n&gt; from his body, but please show me proof that he was as you say he\n&gt; was.&quot;  She looked at Destructor,&quot;I want checks on all personell in\n&gt; the group. And please check the computer systems, security systems\n&gt; ETC ETC.  I want to make sure everything is functioning properly when\n&gt; company comes.&quot;  She looked down again at Phobia&#39;s body. &quot;Fetch me\n&gt; the spark out of him.  I may have use of it. I may be down a bot, but\n&gt; the others don&#39;t know that.&quot;  She looked at Death and back to\n&gt; Destrustor. &quot;Anything else?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She had to hide her feelings deep. She had trusted phobia, considered\n&gt; him a friend. Now this.  She felt terrible about this.  She couldn&#39;t\n&gt; show weakness, but she felt berayed and hurt frim this.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  DEstructor quickly followed kit kat. he entered the hall to find\n&gt; Death\n&gt; &gt; awaiting him...&quot;We have a problem he said. The one called\n&gt; Phobia..he is a\n&gt; &gt; vile creature. I scanned his data tracks. What I found can not be\n&gt; described.\n&gt; &gt; You must understand he would have found away to kill us all if had\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; chance. I did what I had to do. He though I fear is not slain. When\n&gt; I killed\n&gt; &gt; his body many of these little spiders cvame out. I fear they may\n&gt; rebuild him.\n&gt; &gt; I wish to have them examined.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  Destructor put his hand on his old friends shoulder. &quot;I understand\n&gt; but it is\n&gt; &gt; not my place...you must ask our leader.
