Inside he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finds a bunch of energon pulse weapons, a\n&gt; newer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tripred design, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although he&#39;s unsure how effective they are. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He moves onto the next sealed crate, and is\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to open it when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gets Megatron&#39;s second message. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looking, so lemme \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alone for a bit.

The ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which none of the bots know about, or what\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are. Something that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would involve triggering an effect of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; artifact, which would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause the Predacons to win the battle, but\n&gt; maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the artifact could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switch hands, and then a sort of power\n&gt; struggle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would ensue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\n&gt; &gt; http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
