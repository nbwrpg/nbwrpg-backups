It lands at an angle, the scanners \nsuccessfully emerging to scan a suitible lifeform. A few moments later, the \npod opens, a small bot carefully sitting up. His small eyes nervioustly \nscanned the area, yelping and jumping back into his pod as he sees something \nmove in the trees. Several minutes later, he carefully pokes his head out, \nlooking around.\n\nNothing moved.\n\nScrat breathes a sigh of relief, trembling in fear as he slowly climbs out of \nthe pod. He stood three feet tall, with a small knife as his only weapond. \nHis entire life had been spent in fear, and this place was no different. He \nshivers in fear, moving off into the forest, regretfully leaving his small \npod behind.\n\n"}}
