He leans forward.\n\n&quot;The result will be anything but uncontrollable,&quot; he says to \nher, &quot;But are you saying that you won&#39;t make it? It does, after all, \ngarauntee your freedom.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The creatures that Magmatron created were very good fighters,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Zardus replies, &quot;This is kind of an experiment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk checked the facts, there was no doubt about the qualities \nof these\n&gt; creatures in a fight. The ones she&#39;d known were savage ferocious \nbeasts with\n&gt; insect like skin that made them difficult to kill. &quot;My technology \nwas meant\n&gt; for science, exploration, and colinization purposes, not to create \nan\n&gt; uncontrollable killer.&quot; She could tell that Zardus&#39; attention wasn&#39;t\n&gt; entirely on her. she wished she could transform to her half mode so \nshe\n&gt; could use her third eye to see what he was doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, there&#39;ll be security,&quot; Zardus says to Lady Hawk after ending\n&gt; &gt; the transmission to Mortem. &quot;If the bot is uncontrollable it&#39;ll \nhave\n&gt; &gt; to be redone. Once you&#39;re successful, you&#39;ll be free to go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This was the best offer she had heard yet. She wanted away from \nthis group.\n&gt; so far she&#39;d been wrapped up by one member(Najah) and shot at by \nanother\n&gt; (Gotron). If these bots were supposed to be on her side then she \nhated to\n&gt; think what they&#39;d do to thier enemies. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can find a \ncomprimise.&quot;\n&gt; She says willing to do almost anything to get out of there.\n\n\n"}}
