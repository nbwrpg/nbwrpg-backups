He is the best hope&lt;br&gt; against&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;  Unicron&#39;s forces.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Elder redirects his attention.&lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Elder: Razorwing, how many can we afford to send to&lt;br&gt; &gt;  Atlantis?
