We are damaged as well as our base \nand require repairs, this would be a nice time to do that.&quot;\n\n* She looked over at the damaged island controls and sighed...*\n\n&quot; But you all fought well and deserve a few mega-cycles in the CR chambers, \ndespite the outcome of this battle. Believe it or not...I&#39;m rather proud of \nyou all.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked back to Prowl, a tired smile on her face...*\n\n&quot; But after you repair please return here and pick up a weapon for yourself, \nI will be speaking to the remainder of the Maximals as well after their \nrepairs.&quot;\n\n* She then turned to Teltoli, she looked the fuzor over but then nodded...*\n\n&quot; As I can see, you have found the weapons hold. Good, you have done well. \nAnd it&#39;s obviousy that I haven&#39;t told you my name yet...it&#39;s  Iron Raptor. \nAnd I&#39;m glad to have you as a member of the Maximal force.\nIf you have any questions or something like that feel free to ask me and if \nI&#39;m not available then you can ask another.\nBut for now, if you&#39;re damaged then simply follow Prowl to the CR chambers. \nAfter your repair is complete please return here, there will be a short \nmeeting.*\n\n* Iron Raptor then turned towards the controls again and set the missile \nlaunched on the pile of weapons on the floor, it could be used in better \nhands then her own. She looked forward to working with the new bots about \nbut it was still going to be difficult at times.\nShe opened her com-link to an all Maximal frequency, it was time to bring \nevery bot in for a well deserved rest and repair...*\n\n&quot; Attention, all Maximal forces. If you are not already on your way in I \nsuggest that you begin making your way towards that goal, you&#39;ve all fought \nwell and deserve a good repair and rest. After you have recovered may you \nplease make your way to the bridge for a short meeting. Thank you.&quot;\n\n* Now it was up to them and her now, the base and it&#39;s bots needed a good \nrepair and so did she. But her own repairs weren&#39;t that important right now, \nbesides, all she would be doing is taking up a chamber that a more wounded \nsoldier would need.\nIron Raptor sighed as she began to slowly fork on the damage, she wasn&#39;t a \nbot that was ever trained to do heavy repairs but she knew a little.\nShe continued to work carefully and slowly as to make no mistakes, she was \nwaiting until the remainder of the Maximals recovered and reloaded.\nThen she would have a little...chat with them.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
