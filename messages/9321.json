But from what I got from Quickstrike&#39;s mind while it was weak, Rowdy Wolf traded places with him. He is now Vok. I recieved this information directly from your leader&#39;s mind.

If I were you, I would get everyone inside before he comes here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
