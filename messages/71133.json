Rat Trap does the same.\n\n&quot; Sorry big guy, but this is wh=\r\nere we gotta get off.  Thanks for the lift though, saved us some gas and ti=\r\nme.&quot;\n\nRat Trap sniffles.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sure gonna miss this big guy.  No telln&#39; if =\r\nwe&#39;ll ever meet up with &#39;em again.&quot;\n\nThe large dino looks down to both of t=\r\nhem, nudges them gently with his snout, and then continues on his own path.=\r\n  Night Shift cautiously scans the area, as he tries to get his GPS back on=\r\nline.  Yet he motions Rat Trap to stay close to him, as he watches the larg=\r\ner predators all around him.\n\n&quot; Stay close Rat Trap.  We&#39;re in uncharted te=\r\nrritory now. The ground&#39;s very uneven here, doubt that my alt form is gonna=\r\n do us any good.  I could travel for a while like that but if I blow more t=\r\nhan just one tire, we&#39;re sunk.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Better save it, and stic=\r\nk ta walking.  And why didn&#39;t ya think of loadn&#39; up on spares anyway?!&quot;\n\nNi=\r\nght Shift looks back to him.\n\n&quot; The Ark only carried so many spare tires fo=\r\nr my make&#39;n model.  Yeah, the speedsters had plenty of spares but the bigge=\r\nr vehicles, they&#39;re hard ta find.&quot;\n\nRat Trap sighs.\n\n&quot;Oh, so I take it they=\r\n all got used up.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Yep, between Tucson, me, and a cou=\r\nple others, we used &#39;em up because we&#39;re off road vehicles. C&#39;mon, I got th=\r\ne signal, and I think I know where we&#39;re headed.&quot;\n\nThey begin another trek =\r\ntoward the Black Fortresses former location.\n\n&quot; I hope Cheetor&#39;s still in o=\r\nne piece.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The trip via dinosaur does indeed make the trip faster than i=\r\nt ordinarily\n&gt; would have been. Not because they are necessarily faster ove=\r\nrall, since they\n&gt; were definitely slow movers, but in this rough and uneve=\r\nn terrain they made\n&gt; better speed then either of the two Maximals could ha=\r\nve. Also most predators\n&gt; give these large Stegosauruses a wide berth!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n However one disadavantage of being so large is the almost constant need to=\r\n\n&gt; feed, which the creatures do as they walk. Their large frames knocking o=\r\nver\n&gt; small trees or propping up on the larger ones. What this means for th=\r\ne\n&gt; Maximals is that their path to the Predacon base is not going to be a\n&gt;=\r\n straight one as the dinos detour to grab morsels of food, quench thier\n&gt; t=\r\nhirst or investigate an interesting smell along the way.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the distan=\r\nce the Maximals can hear the sounds of other large creatures,\n&gt; some of the=\r\nm the dinosaurs, but others are from the larger mammals that have\n&gt; appeare=\r\nd - saber toothed cats and other larger and deadly predators.\n&gt; \n&gt; As time =\r\npasses the Maximals&#39; internal compasses began to chirp in alarm as\n&gt; the cr=\r\neatures they were riding are began to veer off the course. They were\n&gt; trav=\r\nelling more south than the east they needed to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; As more time passed=\r\n they came to what looked to have been an old river bed,\n&gt; and in the dista=\r\nnce a heard of Stegosaurus were walking, or should we so\n&gt; plodding, their =\r\ntrip taking them to the south, evidently on some migratory\n&gt; trail. They we=\r\nre no longer going in the direction that the Maximals needed\n&gt; to be travel=\r\nling. However one good thing was that they were no in more open\n&gt; country, =\r\nthe large plains beckoned before them. The Maximals had many more\n&gt; miles t=\r\no travel before they arrived at their destination, but at least they\n&gt; coul=\r\nd see where they were going . . . but then again that means that any\n&gt; pred=\r\nators could see them coming as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Yup, if you haven=\r\n&#39;t guessed yet I am having fun with this trip, since\n&gt; it is a long trip an=\r\nd we have a battle going on at the same time. I don&#39;t\n&gt; want them to leave =\r\nthe battle and travel thousands of miles and get back\n&gt; before its over. Th=\r\ne time lines wouldn&#39;t really match up and it wouldnt\n&gt; really make sense.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Enjoy\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
