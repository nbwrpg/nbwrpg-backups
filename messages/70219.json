We will \n&gt; attempt an escape to reduce further risks to our ranks....  Wait a \n&gt; minute...  That&#39;s Darkhawk... He - he&#39;s calling for help.  Talon, I have \n&gt; to break contact for now, need to help someone.  I&#39;ll call you back, I \n&gt; promise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He breaks contact with Talon, hearing Darkhawk&#39;s voice.  Night Shift hears \n&gt; it too.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sir, you thinkn&#39; what I&#39;m thinkn&#39;?  I mean that little pest has slagged \n&gt; us more than enough times..  But deep down he&#39;s one of us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Exactly what I was thinking Night Shift.  Change of plans.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He lets go of his inverted spider maneuver as does Night Shift, who both \n&gt; land back on their feet, to follow Dark Hawk&#39;s cry for help.  Like cats, \n&gt; as soon as their feet surely touch ground, they follow the sound until \n&gt; they find him, as they keep their regular headlights on for light. Tucson \n&gt; arrives first, kneeling down to Dark Hawk.  Night Shift now approaches as \n&gt; well, to assess the predacon&#39;s injuries.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Before you go nuts on us, we&#39;re here ta help not ta hurt ya.  It&#39;s okay, \n&gt; we&#39;re not gonna open fire, we promise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson knew what was happening.  He had an idea all along that Hydras \n&gt; never gave a real scrap about any of his lackies.  He felt bad for Dark \n&gt; Hawk, he knew that he had been cast asside like a piece of trash. Instead \n&gt; of resenting him for his animosity toward him, he looks down to the fallen \n&gt; predacon with an air of compassion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hydras may not come for you but, no matter who you are, which faction \n&gt; you&#39;re on, if you need help, I will ALWAYS come to your aid. And it&#39;s no \n&gt; lie, it&#39;s a PROMISE.  Sure, you did a number on me, but, all things \n&gt; asside, I believe that really wasn&#39;t your fault.  Now, don&#39;t be alarmed, \n&gt; I&#39;m going to lightly touch you to scan for fractures or major damages.  I \n&gt; want you to tell me as soon as I touch something that hurts, so I can get \n&gt; an idea of what needs to be repaired.  Night Shift, support his upper body \n&gt; and try to keep him calm.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.  Tucson now looks to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm, still a little dark down here.  Rodimus, could you give me some more \n&gt; light please?  I can&#39;t quite see if there&#39;s any external leakage of fluids \n&gt; due to his fall.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift could see that the lights were turned up as high as they went. \n&gt; He couldn&#39;t help but interrupt.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Umm, Sir, they&#39;re up as high as they go...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was realizing what was happening.  The power that turned him into a \n&gt; Prime could only give him sight temporarilly.  In order to be able to see \n&gt; permanently that damage had to be maunally repaired.  Soon, the area was \n&gt; becomming darker and darker.  And this time he was without his \n&gt; transmitter.  It was clear he would need assistance to vacate the area.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The Matrix must have only given me enough reprieve from my disability to \n&gt; get Rodimus recovered..  I&#39;ve done that, and now...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Before he could finish, the light dims and then..  Nothing.  He did not \n&gt; panic though, he was still a Prime, just a Prime who could not see.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Night Shift, you&#39;ll have to take over for me..  Rodimus, here&#39;s your \n&gt; test.  Guide me back safely to the Ark, I will help you fight, but you \n&gt; have to be up front and honest with me.  Watch my back because even though \n&gt; I hear, I&#39;m without my transmitter, and I am still blind to those beyond \n&gt; my range of normal hearing.  Do this for me, and I will trust you for \n&gt; eternity.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift takes over, carefully assessing Dark Hawk&#39;s injuries.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/hydras/Darkhawk\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;MOVE!!&quot;commadned hydras, whose move away of the hole.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;HELP ME!!

He quickly looked around doing a quick check of the room.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Great.&quot; he said as he noted that there was no other exit but the one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; above them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile above things were seemingly going well for the Decepticons\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and Predacons who appeared to be further away from the hole, that is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; until Cyclonus and Deepstryke noticed something.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Sir?&quot; Cyclonus said to Hydras as he looked at the hole in front of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; them and then at the black Autobot tank that had just burst through\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the door, &quot;Um, perhaps we should not still be standing here the rest\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the floor is not stable . . .\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Deepstryke, rather than firing at those in the hole began firing at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the tank, however his shots could not penetrate the shielding,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; although he could clearly see the shield beginning to weaken under\n&gt;&gt; &gt; their sustained fire. Phobia followed suit.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus from below watched as Tuscon and Nightshift attempted to use\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some sort of ninjabot training. He shook his head, wishing he had paid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more attention to those classes. However he did remember one thing as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he looked upwards, &#39;always be prepared.&#39;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; hand retracted and in its place was a grappling hook which he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fired upwards, and with a click it latched onto something above. As\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fast as he could he began to climb out of the hole, while still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dodging the firepower that was coming from above!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus swung around as he felt a blast of heat as several shots came\n&gt;&gt; &gt; close to hitting him, one causing him to spin as his shoulder was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clipped! &quot;We are clay pigeons down here!&quot; Rodimus grunted as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; continued to climb.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Legacy oriented his main cannon at the Predacons and Decepticons, his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; intention was not to hit them, but to destroy the floor beneath their\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feet, and send them tumbling down into the hole as well! The front of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the tank glowed as energy was built up, and then a beam of light and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; destructive energy was fired from the great cannon muzzle vaporizing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the floor!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s voice intoned over the radio, &quot;Then I would suggest vacating\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this location as soon as possible.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
