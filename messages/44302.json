He was horrified, and=\r\n was screaming for help.  Then, he went forward, and a bunch of saws and st=\r\nuff came down!  They started cutting at Decapitron.  All he could do was sc=\r\nream in sheer pain.  Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol engraved on it. =\r\n Decapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading into a larg=\r\ne box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol came down an=\r\nd sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron went into the box th=\r\ning, which also had an Autobot symbol, and then the doors of the box shut, =\r\nand then Decapitron was stuck, and he was getting beaten and battered.  Aft=\r\ner the 10 minute torture process was done in the box, Decapitron kept going=\r\n.  Mechfluid and oil and stuff were pouring like mad, and he was mangled an=\r\nd dislocated and stuff.  Finally, he was at the end, and was dumped off of =\r\nthe conveyer belt and onto the ground.  The last thing he had seen back the=\r\nn when that happened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinisterly with evi=\r\nl eyes and faces.  \n          *Flashback Ends*\n           \n          Surgit=\r\nal was still...\n\n\n          Your use of Yahoo!
