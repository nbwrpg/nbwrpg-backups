No, it just spouts medical \n&gt; &gt; terms at me.&quot;  She smiled at him in a warm and innocent \n&gt; manner. &quot;So \n&gt; &gt; where pray tell are the sleeping quarters?

She located \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engineering section, the prisoner holding cells, the main \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ventilation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supply systems, lab and hanger bays.  She was just wondering \n&gt; &gt; &gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking rather lost and not sure of where to go.  She \n&gt; eventually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found the Med bays and went to the console.  She looked \naround \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure that no one was looking. Then, she opened up the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; console \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pad and started to look for info on the bot Nightlight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She soon found what she was looking for. THe original bot \n&gt; known \n&gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nightlight had been here. Was reprogrammed and into another \n&gt; bot. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was about to find the name when she heard a noise. She closed \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer terminal and made a rather loud sigh. &quot;Drat. I try \nto \n&gt; &gt; find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the map to find my way around and this stupid computer won&#39;t \n&gt; help \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All it does is bring up medical stuff to which I know nothing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the PIT won&#39;t this bad day just end already.&quot;  She whined \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and turned to leave. Her head low and her shoulders drooping \na \n&gt; &gt; bit, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just incase someone was watching.\n\n\n"}}
