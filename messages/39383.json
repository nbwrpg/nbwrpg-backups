In \nno time, she was repaired. As she exited, she tried to find her way around. \nShe entered a room where many computers and monitors were located. One \nholoprojection showed the current state of the battle. She saw Nightlight \nand Termitron as well as many other bots, but it seemed the Chivtrons were \non the losing side...\n\nStarstomp:\nBy Prime! This can&#39;t be! Alright! I&#39;m going in! (she opened her com) To any \nChivtron personnel, I&#39;m Starstomp and I am ready to assist if you&#39;d just \ntell me how to get the salg out of this base!\n\nShe transformed to her beast mode, ready to trample.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
