Winged Warrior told me you&#39;re in charge of the \nInfecticon base in the Atlantic Ocean. Mustex, Rhesus, Gorzo, and \nThunderstorm are there now. Mustex sent our a message. Either respond \nor Mustex&#39;ll tell Thunderstorm to open fire (since the others are \nhardly in a position to do such). And getting power from the pit has \nnothing to do with it.  In fact he&#39;s looking for bots to SELL there \nsparks and what good would that be if they were already with the pit?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; because it wasnt directed towards him, and pin pointing every evil \nrobot on \n&gt; the planet is useless. As Evil is all in the eye of the beholder. \nMeaning the \n&gt; Infectcions are really good guys, as are the decepts and everyone he \ncant \n&gt; just pick one evil bot out of an entire planet of them. Also he \nwouldnt to it \n&gt; anyway since the infecticons dont draw energy from the pit. They get \nit \n&gt; somewhere else. In other words, SS cant find the mysterious bot.\n\n\n"}}
