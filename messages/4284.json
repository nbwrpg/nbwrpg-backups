We must destroy the \nenemy colony for the Queen!\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Shut up hot head, we know what were doing. You tunnle \nus in, and we do the damage. Rampage?\n\n::: In his beast mode, he sits in the back, almost sulking over something, \nhis attention elsewhere. :::\n\n::: Rampage ::: I can smell them. They know we are here, I can sense the \nadreniline rushing to there juicy heads...\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: ...I bet you do. Now, lets do this!\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Waspinator was now deep within the forest with Shredder, going to get the \nscrap they needed. :::\n\n::: Waspinator, in the front leading because he felt he was better than \nShredder, ::: Waspinator thinks we should go that way! Waspinator commands \nthat we go that way!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron takes a small break from construction and sees the two Predacon \nblips on his scanners that are Shredder and Waspinator. He sighs, and turns \nto Darkmouse. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Darkmouse, report. How our are systems functioning?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Marine looks to the screen with Hell Beast&#39;s face on it.

Were going to attack them and with out communications they \nwill not be able to get reinforcements.\n\n::: Marine looked to Pheniox who typed in a few codes. The insignia on the \ncomputer screen changed from the Newcomers Predacon face, the the Maximals \nanimal face. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: It is done Commander.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Good. Wait there, im sure there will be someone attacking, \nalthough we could use you at the Maximal base....no matter. Remain there. \n\n::: Marine nodded, and the computer switched off. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Set, followed by Ra and Ominous come to the ship to see Defector standing \noutside of it, talking to someone. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Who the hell is this now?\n\n::: Ra&#39;s hands glow with flames ::: I will burn them alive!\n\n::: Set ::: No you idiot, they are talking to Shuko.
