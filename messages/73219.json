I ONLY CAME THIS WAY ONCE BEFORE!  I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW\n&gt; LONG IT WILL REMAIN STABLE!  I DON&#39;T THINK WE&#39;RE BEING FOLLOWED\n&gt; SO NOW I CAN LIFT THE RUSE!  I HAD TO DO THAT TO FOOL\n&gt; MAGMATRON!  BETTER TO PLAY ALONG AND TRICK THEM THAN RISK\n&gt; LIVES TO FIGHT THEM! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap rides Quickstride out and winds up beside Tucson.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I HOPE HE BOUGHT IT WINGS!  BUT THAT WAS GOOOOD ACTING!\n&gt; DEFINITELY AN ACADEMY AWARD PERFORMANCE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride snorts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; BRAVO!  NICE JOB PLAYING THE BAD GUY!   YA HAD US ALL FOOLED\n&gt; BACK THRE, WE THOUGHT YA REALLY TURNED ON US!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; ME?!  TURN ON ANYONE INTENTIONALLY!?  THAT&#39;S NOT HOW I WORK,\n&gt; QUICKSTRIDE! CALL IT RECKLESSNESS WITH FINESSE!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe MAXIMALS race down one tunnel and the PREDACONS down another, of\ncourse MAGMATRON and his men are going down another tunnel entiresly!\n\nThe tunnels continue to rise as heat and foul smelling air pushes\nthrough the area that they are all running through. Posionous gasses\nquickly follow.\n\nBIG CONVOY continued to run, &quot;I would suggest that you stop\ncongradulating yourselves and keep moving!!&quot; He said gruffly, &quot;This\nwhole things is comming down on top of us! If you have time to talk\nyou are not moving fast enough!&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME also was reaching the same point and then paused as well,\n&quot;Keep running, we are not out yet!&quot;\n\nUp ahead day light could be seen or at least some sort of bright light!\n\nMeanwhile all around them the tunnels shok violently as a red light\ncould be seen comming from behind them. MAGMA!!\n\nA volcanic erruption was in progress!!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
