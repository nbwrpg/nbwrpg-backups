Now that you&#39;ve\npicked the enemy I shal try and make the plan of\nattack. We can use the signal scramblers. They wont be\nable to detect us. We will use Out big tank friend\nhere.&quot; He patted the tank on the shoulder. &quot;To\ndistract the defences while we use Drillbit to dig\nholes under the sheilds. I think it would be best is\nwe just brought the preds with us remember Magma&#39;s\nplan......blitzgreg. Fast an efficent. After we get\nunder the sheilds we  storm the base but remember we\ntake prisoners to reconfigure as Destron. Thats what\nthe machine is for. If anyone has any objections I\nsuggest we contact the predacons immediatly.&quot;\n--- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I think Dachande posted Magmatron leaving.  If\n&gt; not, he should have.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;     He watched Magmatron leave the conference room. \n&gt; &quot;Apocalypse, it&#39;s time \n&gt; to begin our battle plans.&quot;  He opens a com to\n&gt; Ramjet.  (If Ramjet&#39;s there \n&gt; just ignore this part.)  &quot;Ramjet, I need you in the\n&gt; conference room now.&quot;  He \n&gt; turns off the com and brings up the map.  He hits a\n&gt; few buttons and the map \n&gt; splits into two smaller maps.  One shows North\n&gt; America, the other shows the \n&gt; Middle East.  He then highlights the Destron bases\n&gt; on each map in blue.  The \n&gt; known enemy base (Trainers) he highlighted in red. \n&gt; The Destron&#39;s allies \n&gt; (Predacons) were highlighted in green.  The other\n&gt; two bases in North America \n&gt; (Chivtron and Decepticon) were highlighted in yellow\n&gt; because they were \n&gt; relatively unknown bases.  &quot;My recommendation is to\n&gt; attack the Trainers, \n&gt; here.&quot;  The red dot blinks.  &quot;Ramjet and I were\n&gt; planning a battle there when \n&gt; the rest of the Destrons returned.  I think we could\n&gt; take them now but if we \n&gt; need reinforcements we can always get the Predacons\n&gt; to back us up.  The \n&gt; reason I recommend attacking the Trainers is that\n&gt; they pose the greatest \n&gt; threat to our bases.  There are no other bases near\n&gt; ours that are known \n&gt; enemies.  If, Apocalypse, you agree, then I will\n&gt; formulate a plan of attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
