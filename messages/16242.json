I&#39;ve just read \n&gt; about 150 messages, but it&#39;s okay becuase most of them aren&#39;t about \n&gt; me.(*sob* nobody loves me...). And Iron Raptor, I don&#39;t mean to be \n&gt; rude or anything, but who gives you the right to make the scamatics \n&gt; for my weapon? Too late now, I&#39;ll go with it, but just e-mail me \nnext \n&gt; time and I&#39;ll telly ou about what you want to know. I&#39;m also gonna \n&gt; scratch the post where Gotron went to Dark One&#39;s help. I wasn&#39;t \n&gt; really following the battle, so I&#39;m going to get him to do stuff \nwith \n&gt; Starscream.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois looked the two Vok up and down. Powerful, but they should be \n&gt; able to beat them. He put his arm around Child and stared at the \n&gt; villains.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is my mountain, and will soon be a scared place of the \nOracle! \n&gt; Leave now or feel our power withing!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix patted Ramulus on the back.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know. You were pretty goo up there. You came in when we \n&gt; needed it. A few more trips and and you&#39;ll get the hang of it. And \nwe \n&gt; may need some more trips before this is done. Now what&#39;s this comp \n&gt; have to say?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream/Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream came out of his CR Chamber in the Alliance base. He \n&gt; thought about what he should do. He needing to know how his group \nwas \n&gt; doing. He had been thinking about Phobia&#39;s action on the ship, and \nhe \n&gt; wanted to save everyone and was willing t give his life, so he&#39;s \n&gt; valiant. That means he&#39;s probably not in with Megatron. He sent a \n&gt; message.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the Alliance base. How is everyone \n&gt; doing? Did KitKat and Cave-In get their CR Chambers? And are we \ndoing \n&gt; anything against Megatron?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream walked down the hall and entered the caf. He really had \n&gt; nothing to do until his group came to the Alliance, so he&#39;d go hang \n&gt; out. When he go their though, he saw a familiar face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Gotron!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Starscream! What are you doing here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A little ambassador stuff. What about you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m Alliance, remember?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh yeah.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come. Have some energon with me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The two sat down and started getting drunk.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon kissed Spears. He had never felt like this before. She \nalmost \n&gt; made him want to give up his real girl. Maybe he should put chips \nin \n&gt; all the fembots. He could be the player of the NBW!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You mis-understand what were doing. We are only telling Ramulus \nthat \n&gt; we will mett him in a few days. We are not taking Striker with us. \n&gt; When we get back, there will be plenty of time to say good-bye.&quot; He \n&gt; kissed Spears&#39; again as Ignatius flew down.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now, if you hop on Ignatius we&#39;ll be ready to begin.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Bullet went to the guard position by Striker&#39;s cell. He \n&gt; thouht to himself that with him here and Blaze controlling the cell \n&gt; guns that the only way this person could get out is if they were an \n&gt; ultimate strategist. Than again, Bullet is pretty stupid.\n\n\n"}}
