He tried to bring up his arm to block another, but the arm was to\ndamaged from his attempt to pick up Firearm, so another went to his leg,\ngrazing it. He managed to dodge on more, and put Firearm in the way of\nanother again, (again Yanshosh you can post damage). He then looked at his\nflying foe, &quot;Menasor.... Say you stupid, and hurt Maximal more than you do\nme&quot;, he then continued towards Astroblast.\n\n\n\n"}}
