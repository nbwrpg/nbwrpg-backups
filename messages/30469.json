His thoughts were busy communicating with hers.\n\n-He&#39;s got an interesting argument, love,- he thinks to her after \nMegaton&#39;s introduction, a bit amused. -If the leader of a Predacon \nfaction is suicidal enough to walk up here alone, we might not want \nto ally with a whole group of him.-\n\nAfter a slight momentary pause, Prowl continues. He was used to being \na military advisor, and this is what he usually did anyways.\n\n-Although helping him defeat the other Predacon leaders and unite the \nPredacons, if that&#39;s what he&#39;s getting at, would be kinda suicidal \nfor us. I doubt this bot would pause for a second before turning on \nthe ones that helped him gain power.-\n\nHe smiles to himself under his faceplate, which had come up along \nwith his helm in case of battle. This ability of his and Iron \nRaptor&#39;s to communicate with each other over thought has just \nrevealed a new advantage.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; then here\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton stopped about twenty feet away from Iron Raptor. His \ntowering form\n&gt; placed her in his shadow. The dragon took a good close look at the \nbot who\n&gt; appeared to be in charge. Her look had changed since the predacon \nfiles he&#39;d\n&gt; studied but there was no mistaking that the bot standing tall \nbefore him was\n&gt; none other than Iron Raptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transforming to his freakish robot mode Megaton shrunk down to a \nsize more\n&gt; compatible with hers. He still stood slightly taller than her but \nthey were\n&gt; now equals none the less. &quot;My name, my dear, is Megaton, rank will \nbe leader\n&gt; of all predacons.&quot; He stepped back a step to appear less \nmenacing. &quot;As you\n&gt; may already know the Predacons are split into seperate factions \nmaking my\n&gt; opposition ripe targets. Destroy the other leaders and the \nPredacons will be\n&gt; reunited.&quot; He knew that the information he was giving the maximals \ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; sound very convincing but there was a twist that he&#39;d left out. &quot;I \nknow that\n&gt; you&#39;ve recently taken quite a bit of damage from attacks, I offer \nthe\n&gt; protection of my faction in return for your assistance.&quot; As added \nincentive\n&gt; he added, &quot;If a single bot such as myself walked up to your front \ndoor\n&gt; imagine what a group with a dozen warriors could do.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
