Brown begins firing his gun at Depp &lt;BR&gt;as =\r\n\n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; they became dangerously close. Depp swings his swor=\r\nd. \n  Brown &lt;BR&gt;stares in &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; horror as his hand drops to =\r\nthe \n  ground. Depp raises a gun and &lt;BR&gt;shoots &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown =\r\nin the \n  head. He collapses. McGowan raises a hand, signaling &lt;BR&gt;for \n  &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virgo and Depp to step back. They follow her orders and=\r\n \n  stand &lt;BR&gt;beside &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; her. Birdbot and Papertron haven&#39;=\r\nt \n  attacked yet. They were &lt;BR&gt;waiting &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Aerotaur,=\r\n \n  Nightlight and Trinity. Virgo was also waiting for &lt;BR&gt;that \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; certain someone.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; &gt; Virgo: Furry bitch furry bitch....Gonna be so \n  frigging dead....=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Hazel, \n  White and Per=\r\niwinkle begin walking towards the &lt;BR&gt;attackers. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bi=\r\nrdbot&#39;s eyes change color. Then, without warning, he \n  flies at &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; Hazel. She gasps and grabs White, pulling her in \n  front of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;herself, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; for protection. Birdbot digs his \n  talons i=\r\nnto White&#39;s chest. After &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; several cracks, his feet \n  b=\r\nust through White&#39;s back and start &lt;BR&gt;trying &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to grab =\r\n\n  Hazel, but can&#39;t reach. He rips his feet back out of &lt;BR&gt;White, \n  &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sending blood flying. Hazel blocks a fleet of shots from \n =\r\n McGowan &lt;BR&gt;with &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; White before dropping her. White sta=\r\nres, \n  wide eyed. Her fingers &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; twitch as she lays on t=\r\nhe ground. \n  Hazel looks at McGowan, whose &lt;BR&gt;smile &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\nhad brightened. \n  Hazel runs back over to Cerulean, Bronze and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; \n  Periwinkle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;=\r\n Hazel: Damn, \n  their good. I&#39;ve got to admit that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &g=\r\nt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Hazel watches Lee and Barrymore brutally ki=\r\nck Pink \n  and Brown &lt;BR&gt;while &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; a puddle of blood forms=\r\n around \n  White.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Bronze=\r\n: Maybe I&#39;ll \n  kick ass another day...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  Papertron: ERF FER FER FER!...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; Papertron flexes while Birdbot demands Doritos=\r\n...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of \n  Yahoo!
