It was more of a relay \nsatelite for the energy generator our galaxy was created as. And I \nnever said a word about SSJ (although I did mention dbz a little to \nmuch). I realize these were stupid ideas, but if you&#39;re going to \ntorment me about them at least get the facts straight. And now we have \nthe descendants of the Maximals and Predicons, why no the Ancestors of \nthe Autobots and Decepticons (and let&#39;s stop argueing before Hugar \nblows his top.......again).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Right and who wanted to make his charachters go SSJ and wanted the \n&gt; regular moon to be a gigantic robot for his charachters? Hmmm... \n&gt; Original ideas and very creative if I do say so myself but they are \n&gt; rather dumb IMHO. You really get on my nerves Dewboy and thus I get \n&gt; on yours, its a vicious cycle, deal with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks you&#39;re not the first to compliment me.
