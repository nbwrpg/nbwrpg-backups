Maybe being in seperate quarters would help him understand.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 07, 2001 10:49 PM\nSubject: Chamaleon\n\n\n&gt; Chamaleon:\n&gt;\n&gt; Chamaleon looked to Blaze and Bullet and said &quot;Well, I was wondering\n&gt; if you like that I show you your quarters?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
