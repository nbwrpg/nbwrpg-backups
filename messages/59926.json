The \nscene \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked like a battle was brought out of know but at the same \n&gt; time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everywhere. Almost as if the barriers of the dimensions folded \n&gt; &gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; two. SureStrike begins to anlyze the scene. He looks towards \n&gt; &gt; Cooley \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and says &quot;Well I can pickup Dragos and Argos weapons fired \nhere. \n&gt; &gt; But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this is confuzing. It is almost as if the other set of weapons \n&gt; &gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is Identical yet seperate from the Dragos, As if there was a \n&gt; &gt; clone.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cooley looked towards SureStrike as if in confusion. &quot;How was \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons cloned. I mean they are designed to use no traceable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; signal.&quot; Cooley said. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well there is a way, But that is if we are cloned.&quot; \n&gt; SureStrike \n&gt; &gt; &gt; replied to Cooley with a concerned look to him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If that is the case then what are we doing we need to find \n&gt; &gt; Dragos \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ans Argos before they die. That is if they aren&#39;t already dead \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.&quot; replyed Cooley. At that they take off again to \n&gt; check \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the area for scraps and other parts but they find none.
