Maybe \neven while they were asleep?\n&lt; Not an easy choice.&gt;\nHer mind reeled...before: &lt; Just kill him. Problem solved.&gt;\n&lt; YOU!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Hehe!&gt;\nIR: &lt; Grr! Get lost! I&#39;m thinking right now! Bug me later!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Kill &#39;em!&gt;\nIR: &lt; Bite me! Now go away!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Well...at least can I listen in and see what&#39;s happening?&gt;\nIR: &lt; Haven&#39;t you been doing that already?!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Your point being?&gt;\nIR: &lt; GET LOST!&gt;\nSBM: *hurt pause* &lt; PMS!!&gt;\nIR: &lt; GRR! I&#39;M GUNNA...&gt;\nSuddenly her mind went blank, the SBM giving a startled cry before \ndisappearing all together.\n&lt; PMS THAT you skanky bitch! Haha!&gt;\nBut, as Iron opened her eyes and left such an inner battle behind, the \nanswer that she had been searching for before the rude inturruption came.\nAnd standing firm, tall and solid she glared down at the bot before her.*\n\n&quot; And that is why I want you near me at all times. So that I can stop you \nBEFORE such a thing can happen and assure that not only the sparks of the \nMaximals are safe but perhaps spare yours from exicution from a crime that \ncould be prevented.&quot;\n\n* The expression on her face softened.*\n\n&quot; Though, to prevent their suffering at your hands I WILL terminate you if \nnesecarry. But ONLY if you make me.\nIs that clear?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
