He stepped in \nwith a quick gracefull leap.\nLunarpine thought about the three questions that must go through \nevery transformers CPU when they&#39;re reformatted: What have I become?\nWhy are we here?and most of all Will I change when the other two \nquestions are answered?\n\nHe looked at Shadowwing at the controls, he saw how natural it \nappeared, and with the word &quot;MAXIMIZE&quot; he transformed and took a seat \nat her left.\nSomething about the panel brought back memories, he remembered a \nsimilar situation with him at navigation.The memory was vague, but it \nwas there. He looked back at Shadowwing and said &quot;well this is \nit.Lets fly.&quot;\n\nWith one last glance outside Lunarpine couldn&#39;t help thinking &quot;Hope \nI&#39;m ready for the Maximals again: But are the Maximals ready for me.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him. &quot;If your sure, then we shall go to the base.&quot;\n&gt; She flew up and started to fly in the direction of the transport \npod.\n&gt; She was happy that she wasn&#39;t travelling alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --Original Message---\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri Jun 30, 2000 8:49pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I must learn both sides of my nature, I&#39;m a robot&#39; I was programed\n&gt; to learn, to adapt.&quot; Lunarpine&#39;s voice became stronger with each\n&gt; word, He knew that he was doing the right thing going with Shadow\n&gt; Wing, and she knew it too.&quot;Take me to them it&#39;s time I faced my\n&gt; techno side.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
