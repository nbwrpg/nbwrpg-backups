(because my characters hardly ever avoid attacks) and she threw a\nspin kick at him..he didn&#39;t respond.....then later he said he made her\nweapon disappear for good....so i revealed that she stole another\none..because he can&#39;t do that!.....and now Tigerhawk is complaining that\nPlintissa always blames others for what she does....she never did that, so\nit looks like Tigerhawk is really the one blaming others for stuff that HE\ndoes......i know you can hear me, RGDan, Plintissa left the Maximals to get\naway from YOU.......thought i had to get that off of my chest.........whew!\nyou have to tell the truth!....\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 16, 2000 6:34 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars - Saga\n\n\n&gt; (Code, (no offense meant to Liono), but yes, RgDan does mode.  But just\n&gt; because he modes numerous times, does NOT mean you get to, and it&#39;s no\n&gt; excuse.  RgDan has been spoken too, and if nothing is done by him, further\n&gt; action will be taken.  Heck, I don&#39;t really agree with &#39;Stinger being able\nto\n&gt; move the Autobots and Decepticons where ever that person wants, I think of\nit\n&gt; as a little along the lines of moding.  But if that wasn&#39;t done, we&#39;d have\n&gt; people joining the Maximal side just so they could go off and blow up\n&gt; Autobots and Decepticons for kicks.
