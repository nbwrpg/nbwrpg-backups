She hadn&#39;t known \nRodimus for long, but she had respected his words and his actions. \nVisibly shaken Scryed looks at Rodimus her eyes sorrowful, &quot;H... \nHow... How, what happened?! The Preds? If it was the Preds...&quot; She \nwas now visily shaking with anger as she checks her weapons, which \nwere nearly at full charge. She calms herself reconsidering her \ndesire to attack the Preds full on; not a smart idea.\n\nHearing another voice from behind Rodimus, she is momentarily \ndistracted. Spoting Wheeljack-X, she calls over Rodimus to \nhim, &quot;Whoa... I totally missed you, sorry bout that. I&#39;m Scryed, \npleased to meet you.&quot; She passes Rodimus, and offers a paw.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Optimus Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No &quot; replied Rodimus&quot;He&#39;s death, at least that said Owlhawk and \nhe \n&gt; named me commander of Maximals&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
