He and his TERRORCONS were also in beast mode,\n&gt; usin=\r\ng whatever protection it afforded them against being surprised.\n&gt; However s=\r\nince all of them were the rough equivalent of being\n&gt; transmetaled it would=\r\n not be a perfect cover.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fortunately they were far enough away from th=\r\ne ARK that it could not\n&gt; scan them casually, although a directed scan migh=\r\nt reveal them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Agreed.&quot; HUN-GRRR said with one of his heads, the othe=\r\nr looked at the\n&gt; other TERRORCONS. &quot;Rippersnapper, Blot, excavate a tunnel=\r\n and knock\n&gt; down the Maximal tunnel!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BLOT nodded, looking something =\r\nlike a a shark with legs and claws. &quot;Me\n&gt; Blot understand.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; On the oth=\r\ner hand RIPPERSNAPPER started to balk, &quot;What? We&#39;re not\n&gt; going to fight th=\r\nem?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; HUN-GRRR&#39;s other head turned to face RIPPERSNAPPER, &quot;We will figh=\r\nt\n&gt; when I give the command and not before.&quot; One of HUN-GRRR&#39;s heads\n&gt; poin=\r\nted back at the tunnel. &quot;The coordinates are here, but we haven&#39;t\n&gt; seen ou=\r\nr objective. When we see that, *then* we can deal with the\n&gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There was a pause from RIPPERSNAPPER and then a nod, &quot;On it.&quot; he said\n&gt; a=\r\ns he took off towards the tunnel, BLOT quickly following behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; One o=\r\nf HUN-GRRR&#39;s heads looked at DINOBOT, &quot;I don&#39;t see anything like\n&gt; the fema=\r\nle said. If it&#39;s here it must be in the tunnels somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDIN=\r\nOBOT let out a nod then, and hissed, &quot;We fight the MAXIMALS when they are w=\r\neak, and when we can pick them apart and cull them at our leisure.&quot;  Hopefu=\r\nlly even RIPPERSNAPPER would get the idea that engaging an unknown gropu of=\r\n Maximals a mere few kilometers from the ARK an din range of the heavy cann=\r\nons atop it -and- the rest of the MAXIMAL army was a stupid idea.  \n\nThen a=\r\ngain this -was- RIPPERSNAPPER they were talking about.\n\nDINOBOT grinned, &quot;W=\r\ne&#39;ll bury them in thier own tunnel and iether let thier folk be desperately=\r\n focused on rescuing them or cut them off and eliminate them ourselves.&quot;\n\nF=\r\nor now, he went back tos canning the horizon then, hoping that they could g=\r\net dug in underground before the ARK&#39;s continuous scanners would pick them =\r\nup.\n\nThere, far away, stealted over was BLACKARACHNIA, who gazed over at th=\r\ne ARK..  &quot;oh, to be alone for a day..&quot;  Stroking at her chin, wishing she s=\r\ntill had her access codes and overrides to it from so long ago.\n\nAnd so she=\r\n went, giving her &#39;report&#39; to TARANTALUS and slinking over towards the unde=\r\nrside of the heavily retrofitted VANGUARD class craft.\n\n\n"}}
