But Brooder was right, they needed to find the Autobots first before all of this took place�if she decided that it would happen.\nIron Raptor studied the wall behind the bots ahead of her, her mind deep in throught.\nIt could work, it could damn well work.\nBut there were a few more details that had to be worked out before she accepted anything. Like, just how were they going to get the ship into space without a pilot? Things such as that.\nBut there was also another problem, the Ark was basically scrap. It would have to be repaired before they did anything.\nIron Raptor sighed and leaned forward, placing her hands on the table and leaning on them.*\n\n� This plan of yours sounds fairly possible. But I need more detail on it. I need to know what your actions will be if anything goes wrong, if there�s a deadline and just how you plan to pull this stunt off. I�m not going to clarify this unless I know EVERYTHING.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then scanned the ship again but found that the new bot ( Feline ) was no where in even nearing the Conference Room as she had asked.\nEither this bot hadn�t gotten her message or she was ignoring her, either way she was required to at least follow a simple order as to come when she was called.\nWith her internal systems she scanned through this new bot�s file and finally found her name and other vital info.\nShe looked at Arcangle for a moment but then opened her com-link to the fembot again.\nBesides, she already had a few things that this bot could do to keep her busy�and out of restricted areas.*\n\n� Feline, this is Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander. Report to me in Conference Room 6-3. I wish to speak to you.�\n\n* And with that she turned back towards Arcangel.*\n\n� Sorry, just another matter of buisness. Now, to your plan.�\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
