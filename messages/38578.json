Proto did come up with the original idea, but he left early on, right before Firestorm, the final original founder. Almost everyone (no offence, Proto) has been here longer than he has, but that&#39;s really no reason to start up fights.\n\nWhile I&#39;m at it, I&#39;m going to criticize all the faction bashing that&#39;s been going on. Some factions are stronger than others, but that&#39;s no reason to bash each other about them. In fact, I&#39;m going to go clear out all the polls about that in an effort to promote peace amongst RPGers :-). Anyways, quit bashing each other&#39;s factions. It gets extremely annoying reading through 10 or so &quot;My guys can whoop your guys&quot; posts with absolutely no point to them.\n\nPS. If you really wanna argue about something, email the person, don&#39;t spam the RPG!\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Oh, really? Then why did you bail out before? I&#39;ve posted every day (except for days I didn&#39;t feel well or on special occasions that I shouldn&#39;t post on) since I&#39;ve arrived. So in reality, counting up all of the time, I&#39;ve still been here longer than you have...\n\n\n"}}
