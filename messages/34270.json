in the destroyed groun=\r\nd as \n  he chased after Dark One.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fir=\r\nst Aid \n  managed to get to his feet, and began slow repairs on Hot&lt;BR&gt;Rod.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Blades avoided most of the fire b=\r\nall, the entire \n  left side of his&lt;BR&gt;apache mode &lt;BR&gt;&gt; burnt slightly.=\r\n&nbsp; &quot;Damn \n  Decepticons.&quot; he cursed as he gained altitude&lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; armed his \n  missiles.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He spotted someone firing on Smo=\r\nkescreen, and fired \n  off two missiles&lt;BR&gt;at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; robot responsibl=\r\ne, Darkfate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Groove and Streetwise=\r\n will still being carried \n  away by friendly&lt;BR&gt;Maximals to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; get m=\r\nuch needed repairs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scattershot lo=\r\noked disgusted at Darkfate&#39;s \n  soldiers, staring for a&lt;BR&gt;cycle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; b=\r\nlankly.&nbsp; He then spun around \n  real quick, transformed to bald eagle&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;mode, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crazily flapped \n  his wings, flying off after Zardus=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Imprisoner transformed to biped =\r\nmode and blasted off through the air&lt;BR&gt;with \n  his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; boosters at fu=\r\nll power.&nbsp; The explosions from below sent him \n  flying&lt;BR&gt;upwards &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; event faster as his boosters began to fizzle \n  out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *g&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Imprisoner headed straight down, firing three optic \n  blasts off at&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nRixer.&nbsp; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformed in mid air, the quick \n  decent causin=\r\ng him to easily avoid&lt;BR&gt;rapid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; laser fire shot at \n  him.&nbsp; He=\r\n crashed to the ground in his tank mode,&lt;BR&gt;firing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; off a \n  missil=\r\ne each from both of his cannons.&nbsp; Two missiles streaked&lt;BR&gt;through \n  =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the air towards the Element.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  Predator&#39;s sensors detected laser fire, missiles, and an \n  incoming&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;robot.&nbsp; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; leapt back, flying upwards into the \n  air.&nbsp;=\r\n He avoided the missiles,&lt;BR&gt;and the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bot, but two blasts \n  from D=\r\narkfate dug into his calf on the way up&lt;BR&gt;and tore it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  painfull=\r\ny wide open.&nbsp; He raised his launcher, firing off a rocket at \n  &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Reptillica and another at the Cybertronian Fire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  (Je=\r\nn, since Forrior would&#39;ve been point blank had Predator stayed&lt;BR&gt;there, \n =\r\n the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; missiles shot by Firearm would be heading pretty much for \n  =\r\nForrior&lt;BR&gt;now, since &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they had been fired at where Predator had la=\r\nst \n  been, the location&lt;BR&gt;where &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Forrior would now be.&nbsp; I be=\r\nlieve, \n  anyway)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Choran jumped out o=\r\nf the way of \n  some autogun fire, and raised his&lt;BR&gt;weapon.&nbsp; He &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; fired off his \n  rifle in an arc, five laser blasts at Rixer, 10 at&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nTruttle, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ten at Demise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Easily avoiding some \n  shots, Shockwave looked to Wildrider. &lt;BR&gt;&quot;Megat=\r\nron?&nbsp; As in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \n  Predacon impostor?&nbsp; Be gone before yo=\r\nu are melted down!&quot; he&lt;BR&gt;intoned \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; without emotion.&nbsp; He rai=\r\nsed his missile launcher, firing off \n  two&lt;BR&gt;rockets.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Both=\r\n heading for the Element.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Firestar=\r\nter avoided most of the shots, some digging into \n  his frame. &lt;BR&gt;He &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; launched off two missiles at the Element from his \n  missile launcher,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;and then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformed back into space fighter \n  mode, engines r=\r\noaring and&lt;BR&gt;sending him &lt;BR&gt;&gt; screaming through the \n  air.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Unitron flew fast, only a few shots \n  from Dol=\r\nlon and Drillbit digging&lt;BR&gt;into his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; frame.&nbsp; He cursed, \n  fi=\r\nring off four blasts from his rifle, two at&lt;BR&gt;Dollon and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; two at \n=\r\n  Drillbit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Double Punch felt three \n=\r\n  tentacles wrap around him as a mass of&lt;BR&gt;voltage ripped &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through=\r\n his \n  body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Beeline hovered, and fi=\r\nred \n  twenty-five rapid laser blasts from its&lt;BR&gt;bulging &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eyes off=\r\n at \n  EndBringer.&nbsp; It then powered up its engines and gained&lt;BR&gt;altit=\r\nude \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; so it wouldn&#39;t be easily shot.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Manterror avoided most of the shots, some digging further into=\r\n his&lt;BR&gt;badly \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; damaged body.&nbsp; He fired off six ion disks, t=\r\nhree from each arm. \n  &lt;BR&gt;Three at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manthys, three at Wespah.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Injector got struck by a charge, which=\r\n knocked him out of the way \n  of&lt;BR&gt;other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; shots.&nbsp; Hovering p=\r\nainfully, he raised his arm, \n  firing off four&lt;BR&gt;missiles &lt;BR&gt;&gt; total.=\r\n&nbsp; Two down at the Cybertronian \n  Fire, two at the Element.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vehement flew \n  hard, avoiding most shots but =\r\na missile blew up&lt;BR&gt;against his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; left \n  abs, ripping the armor pl=\r\nating there wide open.&nbsp; He cursed,&lt;BR&gt;raising \n  both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; arms an=\r\nd launching off two missiles and ten rapid optic blasts. \n  A&lt;BR&gt;missile at=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Killfest, a missile at Reptilica, and the ten rapid \n  optic blas=\r\nts at&lt;BR&gt;Forrior.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sun Crusher \n  jump=\r\ned into the air, avoiding the missile but several&lt;BR&gt;shots dug &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  =\r\ninto his armored form.&nbsp; He laughed as the missile headed near \n  the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;stasis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; locked Smokescreen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He raised his \n  rif=\r\nle, firing off three powerful blasts from the heavy&lt;BR&gt;laser &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ri=\r\nfle, two at Truttle and one at Rixer.&nbsp; He then did some \n  quick&lt;BR&gt;mo=\r\ndifications &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and threw the rifle with great accuracy and \n  strengt=\r\nh like a javelin&lt;BR&gt;at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Element with the explosion power of \n  =\r\na small grenade, not much, but&lt;BR&gt;better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He raised his arms, firing off a missile at the Cybertronian \n  Fi=\r\nre,&lt;BR&gt;which was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; almost out of range.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Reflector avoided the missiles heading for him, which cratered=\r\n \n  the&lt;BR&gt;surface of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the already worn ground below him.&nbsp; Sev=\r\neral \n  shots tore into his&lt;BR&gt;rather &lt;BR&gt;&gt; untouched leg armor.&nbsp; &quot;=\r\nYou pieces \n  of slag heathens!&quot; he yelled,&lt;BR&gt;raising his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; arms an=\r\nd firing off two \n  missiles.&nbsp; One at Blyer, the other at&lt;BR&gt;Wespah.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Smokescreen was hit by the missile,=\r\n which sent him flying \n  through&lt;BR&gt;the air, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; avoiding Darkfate&#39;s =\r\nshots (thanks for small \n  favors), his badly&lt;BR&gt;beaten form &lt;BR&gt;&gt; only =\r\nripped apart more as he \n  slammed to the ground, shrapnel stuck&lt;BR&gt;in him =\r\nall &lt;BR&gt;&gt; over.&nbsp; The \n  Maximal did not stir, still in stasis lock =\r\nand it wasn&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;going to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  change, especially after that missile=\r\n hit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Serpentor was still being fi=\r\nlled with energy by the CF&#39;s \n  shields,&lt;BR&gt;and his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; systems overlo=\r\naded, his body exploding like a \n  bomb (the explosion&lt;BR&gt;would hit &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; the CF, BTW), and the only thing the \n  remained was Serpentor&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;charr=\r\ned head &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that went flying through the \n  air, catching the attentio=\r\nn of&lt;BR&gt;Scattershot who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caught it like a \n  football in his talons=\r\n.&nbsp; He did a victory dance in&lt;BR&gt;mid air, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  as best a bald ea=\r\ngle could do, and continued after Zardus.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Nemesis Enforcer remained offline, being carried by \n  Zardus.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ares avoided the missiles, a few \n  plasm=\r\na shots digging into his&lt;BR&gt;wings, almost &lt;BR&gt;&gt; penetrating them in \n  s=\r\nome areas, not doing much in other.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Still in near \n=\r\n  perfect condition, especially compared to the others,&lt;BR&gt;he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; laun=\r\nched \n  off two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, followed by ten&lt;BR&gt;rapid=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  laser blasts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sixshot co=\r\nntinued onward, \n  his dorsal fins being blown clear off by a&lt;BR&gt;missile &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; explosion and \n  plasma blasts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;You Autobot trash!=\r\n&quot; he yelled, firing off two \n  missiles and twenty&lt;BR&gt;rapid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; laser =\r\nblasts at the source of his pain, \n  the Element.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Y=\r\nour \n  use of Yahoo!
