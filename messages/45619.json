Also rAuq is \nthe only one I&#39;ve discussed this with (since I didn&#39;t need to unban \nanything just make sure it wasn&#39;t banned to start with), but he may \nnotice I changed a few details.  He&#39;ll start interacting when he gets \nto Earth.\n\nBIC:  A Pred lutient that looks like TT stands infront of a large \ntanker (not to be confused with tankor).  A green gas is pumped into \nthe holding area.  A general walks up to him.\n\nG:  You sure you want to fly this alone.\n\nL:  So long as I&#39;m one step ahead of my brother whose to stop me.\n\nG:  Don&#39;t underestimate your brother.  If he thinks there&#39;s a chance \nto stop you he&#39;d fight even if it meant civilian casualties.\n\nL: He has no idea where Earth is anyway.  It&#39;s not like he&#39;s just \ngoing to get lucky and crash there.  And what&#39;s so hard about getting \ninto the orbit of a planet and dumping a biological weapon in there \natmosphere to wipe out all organic life and make sure the Decipticons \nwin the great wars.\n\nG:  You do realize you were a Maximal Protoform.\n\nL:  The Autobot fight to  the death hero&#39;s on the Ark aren&#39;t related \nto me, and the ones back on Cybertron would hopefully surrender to the \ndecipticons.  Me and my brother would be one big happy Pred family in \nour own time.\n\nG:  After seeing what this did to those Tranconians I have no doubt \nthis gas can do the job.  If something goes wrong just get into the \nescape pod and land remember.\n\nL:  What could go wrong.\n\nG:  I don&#39;t know.  They just teach us high up officers to say stuff \nlike that if we want to be popular and to say fight to the death if we \nwant to be remembered in history as that great General who sadly died \nyoung possibly in a Mutiny.\n\nL:  Once there aren&#39;t any humans to back up the Autobots we win.  \nWhat&#39;s so hard about that.\n\nG:  Well when I visited Megatron in prison and he gave me this \ninformation it sounded like it had been pretty tough for him.\n\nL:  That was because of that Dinobot idiot.  After the tribes \nscattered he didn&#39;t have the weapons or tech to wipe them all out so \nhe just went for the Ark.\n\nG:  Well then you better be off.\n\nL:  Goodbye.\n\nHe get&#39;s in and pilots it to Earth.\n\nOOC: I know I should have saved this a while longer, but I have a plan \nto keep the threat to Earth without carring it out.\n\n\n"}}
