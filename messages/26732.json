She smiles back. Fenox hadn&#39;t seen this bot before in the base, \nso he must be new.\n\n&quot;Of course,&quot; she replies in a friendly tone, turning away from D and \nfacing Vlad. &quot;What do you want to know?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Vlad hadn&#39;t really had any chance at the battle at the Alliance \nbase but he hadn&#39;t really been into action to begin with, more as in \nleaning towards using his brain then his weapons. He was, indeed, far \nfrom weak but he didn&#39;t see running blindly into trouble as a good \npolicy on keeping one&#39;s life. He put his rifle away and looked down \nat Shesta, who had stayed near him the whole time.\n&gt; They were simply wasting time here and Vlad was eager to locate Von \nso that they could end this and their mother&#39;s land would be his.\n&gt; At that thought Vlad smiles to himself and ran a hand over Shesta&#39;s \nsilky head, knowing that he always got what he wanted. However, he \ndidn&#39;t want to risk injury to himself and would need a hitman who \ncould get rid of Von for him, if he was still alive. Mother had \nalways said that Von wasn&#39;t anything to be scared about, that his \nspark was bigger then his brain. Which, for Vlad, would make his fall \nall the easier.\n&gt; So Vlad turned towards the IronFist, Shesta on his heels, and began \nto move towards it. A pair of bots catching his interest, a fembot \nand some wolf. Walking towards them as they seemed to enter the base, \nVlad flashed one of his famous smiles.** &quot; My Dear Lady, may I ask \nyou a simple question which&#39;ll only take a cycle of your time?&quot; ** \nVlad approached Fenox, Shesta still at his heels. He wanted to know \nif she could recommend somebot he could use as his hitman, which was \nwhy he was here in the first place.\n&gt; Vlad had always known how to impress the ladies, and his young and \nhandsome looks only helped him the more. not to mention, he was \nalways taller then most of them, and in this case it was no \nexception. But all he wanted was to know, not to court.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
