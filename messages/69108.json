Not your guys&#39; fault that I don&#39;t know\nmy Transformers, nor is it your f=\r\nault that I had other expectations. \nHowever, as a suggestion I wouldn&#39;t ma=\r\nke it a habit of letting posts\ngo blatantly ignored for so long, especially=\r\n when it comes to\nnewcomers who don&#39;t know what the heck they&#39;re doing ;)\n\n=\r\nFeel free to write out Shard, or kill him off.
