And that&#39;s wh=\r\nat&#39;s bothering me. Is it that hard\n&gt; &gt; to be nice as well as authoritative =\r\n?

You=\r\n guys may be more connected\n&gt; &gt; ta the old medic in more ways than one. You=\r\n too.

To me, solving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; differences =\r\nhappens when you ask to speak to someone privately and try to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; come=\r\n to a reasonable resolve.  But I sure do dislike the fact that Leo has&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; no personal relation skills.  I mean, seriously, if you want your comr=\r\nades&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to respect you but, the leader has ta also show a little comp=\r\nassion if he&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to be properly respected.  And that&#39;s what&#39;s bother=\r\ning me.  Is it that hard&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to be nice as well as authoritative ?  Tu=\r\ncson does that and more and he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even try to. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Rattrap sighs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorta like what your pal Ratchet w=\r\nas like.  He had a temper but he gave it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his all ta save the lives=\r\n of those who needed saving.  In fact, all those&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; times he put his =\r\nlife on the line for everyone, just like the old CMO would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; do.  He=\r\n&#39;s also got Ratchet&#39;s expressions..  You guys may be more connected&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; ta the old medic in more ways than one.  You too.  You got his heart and =\r\nso&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; does your brother.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; She looks to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait are you saying that Ratchet might have been our- our dad?=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Might be, I&#39;m sure we=\r\n got plenty of intel on it.  I&#39;m sure Legacy will be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; able ta do a =\r\nsearch for us because it is your right ta know.  He could&#39;ve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; been =\r\nfamily and it&#39;s your right ta find your roots.  I actually wonder if&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Lord Elder might know a little bit about that...&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSANTON nodded as he took in the information. &quot;I am sure that LEO wi=\r\nll&lt;br&gt;\nlet us know soon enough.&quot; He pulled out his storage pack, checking t=\r\no&lt;br&gt;\nmake sure that any medical supplies that should be needed were there.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nInterestingly enough there were no offensive weaponry in any of&lt;br&gt;\nSA=\r\nNTON&#39;s gear, although that might make sense bing that he is a doctor&lt;br&gt;\nan=\r\n not a soldier.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWINGCALIBER on the other hand listed to RAT TRAP a=\r\nnd STRAIGHT grumble&lt;br&gt;\nabout LEO PRIME&#39;s leadership skills. &quot;What do you f=\r\nind so trying about&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME?&quot; WINGCALBER said as he walked up to RAT =\r\nRAP and STRIGHT&lt;br&gt;\nSHOT, his tone more curious than anything else.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&quot;I have noticed that Tuscon and Leo Prime have different goals, whoch&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nis most likely to be the case, since they are different people, but&lt;br&gt;\nwh=\r\nat else do your see as different?&quot;  like a teacher who paused to try&lt;br&gt;\nto=\r\n puzzle out a problem that a student was having with homework.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TA=\r\nG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group em=\r\nail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-13-725431062--\r\n\n"}}
