He was the unsung hero\nfor he took the dirty jobs where no one else would and when he got\nback his attitude set people apart from him.  He stopped and turned.\nHis infrared vision showing exactly where the bot stood.\n&quot;No need to show your self&quot; the ugly got said.

The figure belonged to a rather large Autobot,\n&gt; though he was stone drunk.

Upon coming to a mound of scraps the bot sits down on\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; goes to kick a small piece out from the pile when all of a sudden\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; mound opens up reaveling a hole with a stiarway.  He looks into it\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; transforms into his large bug monster mode and his infrared vision\n&gt; &gt; comes on. He begins his long descent down into the secret chamber\n&gt; &gt; holding the Autobot&#39;s ship, the &#39;Hidden One&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
