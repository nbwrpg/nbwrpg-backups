It wasn&#39;t taken personally.  One character said it \nto another character and that was perfectly fine.  It was never made \nto be personal. And nothing that goes on here is taken personally.  \nDon&#39;t sweat it cuz I&quot;m sure not. This was a misunderstanding and \nmiscommunication.  OK, let it go. Anyway, back to the RPG)\n\n\n::KitKat\nShe looked at everyone there.\n&quot;Hey guys, I really don&#39;t mind who helps put my leg back on. But I \ncould use some help getting it back on. Draw straws, flip a coin, I \ndon&#39;t mind. But please help me get it on.&quot;\nAs she walks to the lab. &quot;Land Mine, Could you please grab my leg and \nask Drill bit to bring the one that he made.  If one will not work, \nthe other one will.&quot;\nShe walked into the lab and transformed into bot mode.  she sat on \nthe table hoping that this would be finished, over and done with soon.\nShe just wanted her arm back so she could get back to fighting.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Phobia stood back watching the exchange.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d trust a Mechanibal (Comic book reference) with my leg before \nI&#39;d \n&gt; trust these two Jesters.&quot; Phobia thought as he watched the exchange \n&gt; between the three bots, it was almost ammusing though, neither ones \n&gt; function had anything to do with repairs. &quot;If this is the future of \n&gt; cybertron then maybe we should all be deleted.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He walked toward the entrance to make sure Megatron didn&#39;t return \n&gt; unexpectedly, placed a baby there to warn him if he had to stop \n&gt; immediately, then turned and returned to the eoom where the \noperation \n&gt; was taking place. When they were done he&#39;d have a few words of \n&gt; encouragement for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
