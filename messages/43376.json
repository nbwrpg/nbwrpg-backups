He had two white flags tied to his\ncannons. He stopped several paces away from the Tripred, then the back\npart of the vehicle seperated, as the front part leapt up into the air,\ntransforming into the Autobots leader. Pacifix turned to Gesper, and\npicked out his two freeze cannons, throwing them to the sand in front of\nhim, then looking back up. \n\n&quot;I hear you want to speak to the Autobots.&quot;\n\n"}}
