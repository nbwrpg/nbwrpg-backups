Don&#39;t know how much more. \nWe&#39;re the best, of course. We&#39;re known as the Alliance. Zardus is the \ncommander, you might wanna ask him some questions if you want to know \nstuff.&quot;\n\nThe shields of the Alliance base flicker off to let the shuttle \nthrough, and then flicker back on. The Iron Fist&#39;s landing bay opens \nand the ship touches down. Astral stands up.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re here. Follow me, I&#39;ll show you around,&quot; he says, exiting the \nshuttle and waiting for Composer to follow.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecklessa lands near the entrance to the Iron Fist, entering and \ncarrying Griplash to the CR chambers.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Composer::\n&gt; \n&gt;      Composer sat down on a chair, just for a quick rest.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;So, how large is your faction, and by what name do you go \nby?
