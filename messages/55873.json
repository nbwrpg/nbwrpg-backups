Perhaps later we can end our... friendly duel&quot;\n\nBlackstorm looked to Maxima and Kitkat, waitting what they said\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 4/24/03 1:17:01 AM Central Daylight Time, \n&gt; raccoon7679@y... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With lightening fast reflexes, she turned, jumped the ring roped \nin \n&gt; &gt; one leap, and ran towards Maxima. &quot;YOU! You do not raise your \nvoice \n&gt; &gt; to me young one. I do not care who you think you are. You will \nshow \n&gt; &gt; the proper respect. I am the trainer here. You are the \ninterloper. If \n&gt; &gt; you want to play games, then leave and do your programming \n&gt; &gt; elsewhere.&quot; she said, growling. Her optics red with fury, and \nthe fur \n&gt; &gt; on the back of her neck standing up. &quot;You will learn your place \nyoung \n&gt; &gt; one. In the pack, there is an order. And in that order, I am \nyour \n&gt; &gt; supior officer.&quot;  She took a step back to recompose herself. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a more steady and lightly softer tone. &quot;You, young one are \nclever, \n&gt; &gt; smart and well knowledged. But you have yet to really learn how \nto \n&gt; &gt; use this talent to it&#39;s fullest potential. When you have, then \nyou \n&gt; &gt; shall be leader. Untill then, I am still higher ranked. You will \nshow \n&gt; &gt; the rank respect if not the bot. Much like Hydras. He has my \nloyalty \n&gt; &gt; and respect. And I shall show that to all who are around me. You \nwill \n&gt; &gt; do well to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She turned and went back to the ring. Her arm still holding her \n&gt; &gt; stomach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima&#39;s optics glowed. But she would not scrap the bot who just \nseriously \n&gt; insulted her. &quot;It is you who have crossed the line. Hydras \ndeserves my \n&gt; loyalty for many reasons. YOU however,&quot; her voice still eriely \ncalm but \n&gt; obviously there was hint that she did not appreciate what KitKat \njust did, \n&gt; &quot;underestimate me. I am by NO means young. I would be surprized \nthat you \n&gt; would be older than I. Rodimus himself is much younger than I. \n#2... \n&gt; Perceptor has placed ME in charge of Blackstorm. I do believe that \nyou have \n&gt; over stepped your bounds. If I am correct, I don&#39;t recall Hydras \ngiving you a \n&gt; superior ranking let alone charge. Flicker has charge of this \nplace. As does \n&gt; Perceptor. Now... if you will so kindly step aside & allow me \nfinish \n&gt; Blackstorm&#39;s programming.&quot; Her crimson optics glared at Kitkat. \nShe knew at \n&gt; the beginning that this one would be a problem. She was right. So \nmany \n&gt; wanting so much. Sounded far too familiar. Sounded much like \nStarscream.\n\n\n"}}
