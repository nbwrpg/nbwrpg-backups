Forcing a Hawk to walk was like \nthrowing a fish onto land. She was tempted to escape but didn&#39;t want \nto take the fight back to Veratis. If she hadn&#39;t turned on Squizzy \nthe mongoose would make short work of the snake. She was on her own \nfor this part of the war.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I thought Najah was just wrapped around her wings and stuff..\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Repressor::\n&gt; \n&gt; Repressor walks behind Lady Hawk, his gun aimed at her back.
