He was running the show, at least for the moment.\n&gt; Quickstrike needed to give the codes over...if he didnt then they would\nnever\n&gt; be able to control the ships functions, and then the battle outside would\nbe\n&gt; for nothing. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: TRANSANULAS, in his lab ::: Hah, Soon HLL BEAST will know who his\n&gt; superior is...and then I will kill him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He was pouring over computer data when he recived the message from the\n&gt; Oblitercons. Quickly, he sent a reply----::::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: TRANSANULAS ::: Tell Quickstrike this is Transanulas, the clone of\n&gt; Tarantulas. I need him alive and safe until I can smuggle him into the\nship\n&gt; to use his codes. He is a skilled warrior and I cant lose him, not now.\n&gt; Please hurry.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He sighed, and went back to work. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: BLACK ARACNIA stared at her computer in disbelife ::: Ah, HELL BEAST,\n&gt; there have been numerous encrypted messages coming and going from\nTransanulas\n&gt; lab.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: HELL BEAST, with a frown looks at her screen ::: What in the\n&gt; blazes....your right. Magnetically lock him within his lab while we\ndecrypt\n&gt; these messages. I want to know what that spider is doing. JACKLE, GREMLIN,\ngo\n&gt; gaurd the door.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: The two Predacons get up and march off the bridge. HELL BEAST then\n&gt; watches PHENIOX and BLACK ARACNIA work on decrypting the messages. Once he\n&gt; found out who he was sending them to.....:::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: HELL BEAST ::: GANGON, BRIGHTBLADE! Go and patrol he perimiter. Look\nfor\n&gt; anything suspicious. We still dont know where our former commrads are\nhiding.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: MEGATRON buzzes into the clearing with currently alot of activity. He\n&gt; jets right up to Shredder :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: MEGATRON, using a quite pissed off voice ::: Transanulas is black\nmailing\n&gt; me! we must eliminate him now. Quickstrike, how are you? And can you give\nme\n&gt; the codes? We must hurry before HELL BEAST finds out!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He says very quickly, and nervously.
