Kenzo loaded in \nthe\n&gt; wounded maximal into his copter form using robotic arms that \nextended\n&gt; out the doors of the copter. He flew aways until he reached the\n&gt; Maximal base.  While in transit his internal repair systems were \nable\n&gt; to administer minor repairs like a lesser version of the CR \nchamber. \n&gt; He landed in front of the base and carefully unloaded them onto the\n&gt; ground. He converted to robot mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I hope flying away from Flicker all the way to the base wasn&#39;t\n&gt; moding but my guy was getting behind.
