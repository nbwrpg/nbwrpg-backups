Magmatron had his own base, \nwhy should he need a new one? Walking past a tree, he sees something. He \nfrowns, looking down at it. It looked familiar....\n\nShredder looks back the way he came. He was in a clearing, one that had \nhosted a short battle sometime in the past. Shredder frowns. He remembered \nsomething like that, back in the days under Zenyak&#39;s rule.... The thought \nabout Zenyak surprised him as he realized that he had not seen his ex-leader \nin quite a long time. He makes a mental note to scan for him .... and kill \nhim when he is found.\n\nAgain, he looks down at the metal heap, reaching down to brush away some \nmoss, and revealing a predacon simble. He frowns again, recognizing the \ndecapitated bot that laid at his feet. It was Fractyl... He looks back at the \nclearing. There had stood the ship that had killed Fractyl during their \nassault on it, now gone somewhere.\n\nShredder shruggs, walking off again into the forest.\n\n"}}
