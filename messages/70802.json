He had felt a great=\r\n power within him, and with Rodimus there, he felt it even more.  He puts a=\r\n hand on his chest.\n\n&quot;Hmmm?  This is strange, ever since we&#39;ve been talking=\r\n here together, I sense an increase of power in my spark..  I wonder...  Ro=\r\ndimus your plan is fail safe, but something inside me is trying to tell me =\r\nthat we should stick together...   Almost as if....&quot;\n\nStraight Shot transfo=\r\nrms and lands between them.\n\n&quot;Power link.  That&#39;s the word you&#39;re trying to=\r\n get out Tucson, Powerlink.  Y&#39;know?  It&#39;s when two Autobots transform and =\r\nmerge into one highly powerful warrior.  You guys are both Primes, and I be=\r\nt you two can power link.  That&#39;s what that little voice inside you is tell=\r\ning you Tucson.  And that&#39;ll explain the power increaes you feel, whenever =\r\nyou&#39;re with Rodimus.  Well, that&#39;s if it is possible, not sure though..  Ju=\r\nst think imagine what you guys could accomplish if you could do that?  And =\r\nRodimus could become your eyes and you can become his strength.  And since =\r\nsometimes you guys have different views, you can share them when you&#39;re lin=\r\nked together.  And the more you share, the more well rounded you become.  K=\r\nnowledge is power, and that&#39;s one thing we got that Hydras doesn&#39;t have.&quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson turns his head toward Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I - I have never tried that...  Tha=\r\nt&#39;s up to you if you wish to attempt it, Rodimus..&quot;\n\nRat Trap steps in.\n\n&quot;Y=\r\nou&#39;re missn&#39; out on a power play if ya don&#39;t try it.  Flatten Hydras, stomp=\r\n out those big bad bugs...  Powerlinking will give you guys the umph it&#39;s g=\r\nonna take ta take ta not only exterminate those overgrown pests, but it&#39;ll =\r\nreally put Hydras in his place.&quot; \n\nTucson turns to Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; A power pla=\r\ny huh?  I&#39;m willing to try it, but Rodimus has to also agree to something l=\r\nike this.  It&#39;s not something I can do without his permission.&quot;\n\nRat Trap n=\r\nodds.\n\n&quot;Atta boy Wheels.  And I can&#39;t think of anyone else who&#39;d make a pow=\r\nerful statement other than you guys.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head to Rodimus and=\r\n waits for his reply.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds and does as asked o=\r\nf him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Very well. I&#39;m happy to see that all of you are showing the=\r\n initiative to\n&gt; &gt; have faith in the unknown. This will only strengthen our=\r\n bonds and our\n&gt; &gt; forces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his head toward the direct=\r\nion of Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I notice you&#39;re a tad quiet Rodimus, I understand =\r\nif something is bothering\n&gt; &gt; you and I&#39;m here to listen if you need to get=\r\n a few things off your mind. I\n&gt; &gt; realize that you have been through a lot=\r\n, and most of it unpleasent. I\n&gt; &gt; assure you Hydras will not get away with=\r\n what he did to you and neither will\n&gt; &gt; the rest of his lackies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nA stone solid look of determination comes over Tucson&#39;s face. Like Optimus\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; he was not one to shy away from working toward a resolve.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And=\r\n if I must, if given the challenge, I will face him if he so choses, on\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n a one to one basis. He took something very valuable away from me, my\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nomrades, and my friends. And now, it&#39;s time I took something away from\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhim.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus shook his head slighly as he turned to leave =\r\nthe room, his\n&gt; strides long and purposeful. &quot;There are so many things to d=\r\neal with at\n&gt; once.&quot; He said as he walked, his face firm and resolute. &quot;At =\r\nthem\n&gt; moment we have our two objectives, locating and defeating Hydras as\n=\r\n&gt; well as learning more information about the Insect creatures that we\n&gt; ha=\r\nve just encountered.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned and looked at the others that had=\r\n followed him out of\n&gt; the room. He gestured expansively with his his left =\r\nhand as he\n&gt; continued to hold Elita in his right arm. They had all come to=\r\n a stop\n&gt; in a large chamber, the bridge was just a litle ahead of them. Ch=\r\neetor\n&gt; and Lord Elder also made thier way over to joim the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tu=\r\nscon, since you are a Prime now and I am sure you are eager to\n&gt; revisit yo=\r\nurself on Hydras, whoch will leave me to focus on the\n&gt; insectoids.&quot; Rodimu=\r\ns smiled grimly as he tapped his head meaningfully.\n&gt; &quot;I believe that even =\r\nthough they have been able to learn much of us\n&gt; Maximals and Autobots from=\r\n what was stored in my head, I believe that\n&gt; they left a few tid bits in m=\r\ny head as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
