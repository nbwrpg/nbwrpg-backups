She had fallen down a hill \nand then got lost in the forest.  She had used her sence of smell and \nhearing, but it proved to be of no use.  She couldn&#39;t find \nQuickstrike, Black Aracnia, Paralysis, any of them.  She was \nhopelessly lost.  \n\nShe had been wandering around in the dark forest for a few days now \nand couldn&#39;t find any sign of another bot. She stopped near a small \nsand bar and started a small fire and snuggled down for a night.  but \nsleep and rest never came.  She had horrable nightmares about seeing \nthe distruction of the Predacons and Maximals.  She saw nothing but \nburned and scorched earth, bots that had been blown apart.  The ships \nas they burned to nothing.  She knew that somehow, this would \nhappen.  The end of the planet may be near.  \n\nShe woke up shaking ans shivering.  She sat up in a cold sweat.  She \nlooked and saw the fire had gone out.  She transformed into mouse \nmode and walked through the trees in the cover of night.  Her \nthoughts were still on her dream.  She had dreamed that same dream \nbefore.  but something made it feel more real than any other dream \nshe had ever had before.  \n\nShe walked along as a small warm breeze came up.  It was then that \nshe finally came across the scent of another bot.  She felt overjoyed \nby the thought of finally finding another bot.  She walked towards \nthe sorce of the scent. \n\n\n"}}
