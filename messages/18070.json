She opened \nher eyes and saw lazar fire and bots standing over her pod.  She \nstood up on all four of her kitten legs and growled a kitten growl.  \nShe called out in a small voice,&quot;HEY! Let me out. Come on, open this \nthing up.&quot;  she got mad and scratched at the top of the pod.  The \nopening mechanism was dammaged in the crash and wouldn&#39; open \nautomatically. &quot;LET ME OUT! Come on you guys, let me out. This isn&#39;t \nfunny any more. Let me out.&quot; She pawed at the glass and growled again.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Tarantulas and Aerostreak gave up on the old pod, and quickly \nrelocated \n&gt; to Trinity&#39;s pod. They entered jsut when the DNA scanners had \nactivated.\n&gt;     &quot;Quickly! In a few moments it will be to late!&quot; Tarantulas \nhissed, \n&gt; rushing over and ripping open the control panle. He unhooked \nseveral wires, \n&gt; placed the ever important Predacon chip in place of the Maximal \nchip, and \n&gt; seal the control panle back up. His fastest record yet.\n&gt;     Aerostreak looked around. &quot;So, is it a Predacon?&quot; He didnt like \nbe so far \n&gt; away from the ship, and the others.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes Aerostreak. When the bot emerges it will be a Predacon!&quot; \nHe laughed \n&gt; with Aaerostreak, until a fimiliar rumbeling broke there happiness.\n&gt;     &quot;I know that buzz.....oh no....&quot; Tarantulas said, as he looked \nup to see \n&gt; Hell Beast and Gremlin. They were armed, and pissed off.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, Tarantulas, thank you for saving me the trouble of \nreprogramming \n&gt; that pod! Drop your wepons now, or be destroyed!&quot; He barked at \nthem, floating \n&gt; a few feet above the pod. Gremlin approached and looked down apon \nthe pod. \n&gt; &quot;Its clear.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Excellent. Now we wait until the bot emerges. In the mean \ntime, I wish \n&gt; you two to give a message to Black Aracnia for me.&quot; He said with a \nsly smile.\n&gt;     &quot;And what would that be?&quot; Aerostreak tried to say bravely.\n&gt;     Hell Beast shot two missles at the Predacons from his shoulder \ncanons, \n&gt; sending the two flying out of sight deeper into the forest. He then \ngave his \n&gt; attention to the pod.\n&gt;     &quot;I have had enough of Black Aracnia. I need to find \nMegatron.....the \n&gt; tables have turned, and he is the one holding all of the cards now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron cursed his incompetent Maximal counterparts. Aquarious \nand \n&gt; Nighteyes failed to give him what he wanted, and Terrorsaur was \nstill \n&gt; missing. On top of that, Kitkat was getting closer to the truth. \n&gt;     (And yes, Logo, you are right on the Remote Control thing.)\n&gt;     &quot;Cant you idiots do anything right?Argh! Get out of my sight \nbefore I \n&gt; send you both to the scrap pile!&quot; He roared in fustration. The \ndestruction of \n&gt; the Autobots seemed to be getting harder and harder......but \nprehaps a covert \n&gt; spy within the Cybertronian Fire would prove useful...\n&gt;     &quot;Ah yes....a spy. Nighteyes, I have a new mission for you.&quot; He \nsaid, and \n&gt; then gave a bellowing laugh.\n\n\n"}}
