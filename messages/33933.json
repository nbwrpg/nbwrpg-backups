Vycir&#39;s cloaking system activates, and the jet slowly\ndissapears from sight. A few seconds later two grenades fly out of\nseemingly nowhere and head toward Sinnertwin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Supernova/Slasys/Scrap jet spins in the air, avoiding Hun-Grr&#39;s\nshots and returning fire with two missiles.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sinnertwin bounds out of the line of fire, further away from all the\n&gt; explosions. One of his head keeps an eye on his direction, while the\n&gt; other turns, and opens it&#39;s maw. A stream of fire bursts out,\nsending a\n&gt; ball of searing flame towards the passing jets.\n&gt; \n&gt; (This is it guys, just like the Terrorcons against the Technobots :)\n\n\n"}}
