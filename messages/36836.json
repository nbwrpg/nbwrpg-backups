In this version, which is\n&gt; Beast wars, and seems to be based on the cartoon of Transformers, there\n&gt; was no Primus. At least, not mentioned. They were all made as simple\n&gt; machines, to work as the Quintessons felt needed, but when the\n&gt; Quintessons made the mistake of giving them personalities, they\n&gt; rebelled. Also, it&#39;s not necessarily clean cut, I mean, sure the\n&gt; Decepticons act evil, but in their minds, they may be justified.\n&gt; Megatron&#39;s quote is &quot;peace through tyranny.&quot; and by that, I think it\n&gt; implies he wants peace, but the universe isnt able to achieve it if they\n&gt; are free, as people tend to be greedy. This is just my opinion of\n&gt; course, and I think the Decepticons are pure evil (dont ask me why I\n&gt; like em that way, I havent the foggiest) but there isnt a rule book\n&gt; saying right or wrong. And they never stated clearly about this whole\n&gt; Matrix pit thing in the cartoon. That&#39;s just your take on it\n&gt; Legendarynemasis.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
