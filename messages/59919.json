Telemetry... online. Targetting... \nonline. Artillery... online. Retalian ready for battle.\n\nRetalian, the super gun, was now ready. Dreadplague leaped right \nnext to the control panel and locked visually to the small satellite\nthat the Minions had left.\n\nDreadplague: Retalian, confirm lock and fire! Destroy that slaggin&#39; \nscrap!\n\nRetalian: Lock confirmed. Powering up... firing.\n\nA powerful detonation rocked the crater and sent the transformers in \nit falling down as Retalian recoiled nearly to the bottom of the \ncrater. The shot was mighty and savage.\n\nIn space, the satellite was utterly blow apart. Not even melting \nremains were left.\n\nDreadplague: Yes! We&#39;ve done it!\n\nImmediatly, static confirmed that communications were back.\n\nHowever, long range radars also detected something huge in the \nMoon&#39;s orbit.\n\nUnicron had arrived.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
