She suddenly became serious, almost sensing her friends thoughts. What if the Alliance wanted it back? What if they tried to kill her for it?\n\nThat Shocker bot seemed already fairly intent on killing her. She didn&#39;t think he would get that far though.. she hoped.\n\n&quot;Nah.. I&#39;ll keep it. If they do want, don&#39;t want you getting killed for me now!&quot; She half-laughs and stores it in her wrist compartment.\n\nShe had a real strong feeling that she should keep it.. and figure it out. Teltoli had no idea why though!\n\n&quot;So have you killed Megatron yet?&quot; The bot laughs.\n\n------Original Message------\nFrom: Carnage Dinobot &lt;carnage@...&gt;\nTo: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nSent: May 22, 2000 11:14:51 PM GMT\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars Saga\n\n\nCarnage/ Dinobot\n\n* Carnage looked at the disc that Teltoli held out to her, she took it carefully in her hand and looked it over. It was strange and it baffled her as to why the Alliance wanted it so badly, perhaps it contained important info on new programs or then next attack on the Maximals from them? Carnage had no clue as to why they would give it to Teltoli and then ask for it back but it had to be something, she looked the disc over again but then held it out to Teltoli to take back.\n\nAll she knew was that it was important and they had to keep it.*\n\n&quot; You know, I have no clue as to what it is but I can bet that it&#39;s important. Hang onto it.&quot;\n\n* Just then the thought occurred to her, what if the Alliance came to find it and if Teltoli didn&#39;t give it back they would torture her! That was a thought that she didn&#39;t want to think about but it was very well possible, and she knew what it would be like.\n\nCarnage looked at the disc in her outstretched hand then at Teltoli, she didn&#39;t want her friend to be hurt over some stupid disc that the Alliance wanted! She could handle torture and still be able to keep the disc from those bots, but could Teltoli?*\n\n&quot; Unless you want me to take care of it?&quot;\n\n* That question had meaning and concern behind it, the answer may even mean the difference between life and death...for Teltoli.*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
