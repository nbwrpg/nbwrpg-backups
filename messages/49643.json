Not wanting to be hit by the Vok Destroyer\n&gt; shot, he puts all of \n&gt; his efforts into diving to the side, out of the way.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The powerful weaponshot warps the surrounding air as\n&gt; it flashes by \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s lower legs. His circuits tingle as he\n&gt; realizes what had \n&gt; missed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; He hits the ground sliding, but quickly rolls, and\n&gt; brings himself \n&gt; into a crouching position. His should armour still\n&gt; damaged from \n&gt; Owlhawk&#39;s initial attack, was the only damaged part\n&gt; on him at the \n&gt; moment. Seeing the Tripredacus retreating, he growls\n&gt; at missing the \n&gt; chance to eliminate a few slag heaps. &quot;Crushing\n&gt; something... \n&gt; Maximalish would be nice right now... yesss...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; New faces on the field greated his eyes. One could\n&gt; be none other \n&gt; than Galvatron, who was fighting the Maximal leader,\n&gt; Rodimus \n&gt; Prime. &quot;A situation to be taken advantage of.&quot; He\n&gt; smiles menacingly; \n&gt; evil amusement could be read from his glowing red\n&gt; optics.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Switchblade has been fooling around with\n&gt; the artifact \n&gt; he&#39;d just put together, or more correctly, put\n&gt; itself together for \n&gt; him. He probes it&#39;s sides for any sort of start\n&gt; mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Searching without any lucky, he was about to quit,\n&gt; when the cube-\n&gt; like matrix of artifact suddenly started to glow. He\n&gt; found that he \n&gt; couldn&#39;t remove his hands from the sides that he was\n&gt; holding, and he \n&gt; had no idea what was happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly, a white superheated blade of white spears\n&gt; outward, slicing \n&gt; through the side of the storage bay and slashing\n&gt; across the western \n&gt; battle field (west side of the Pred base) causing\n&gt; massive damage to \n&gt; anything in it&#39;s path. Switchblade was still\n&gt; gripping the artifact \n&gt; like there was no tomorrow, and he didn&#39;t appear to\n&gt; be fully \n&gt; concious. It was like the artifact was controlling\n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; ( i just chose a side for the attack to damage, so\n&gt; if anyone feels \n&gt; that there bot is on the west side, they can post\n&gt; for the attack \n&gt; damaging their bots, or missing them. I intend to\n&gt; have Megatron \n&gt; damaged at a minimum. =) )\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
