There were so many, there would be quite a bit of information and \ndata to go through before she would find what he was asking for.\nAlso, scans on the weapons used in that certain battle, a chip of some sort.\nIris thought for a moment, her scanners going through her data memory file \nas she thought.*\n\n� Hmm�.�\n\n* She would have to narrow it down, but it would be easier of she knew whom \nshot the weapon that this Maximal was asking information for.*\n\n� Could you provide me with a name of the one whom shot this weapon?�\n\n* Her question was simple, but even as she asked the question her scanners \nhad already narrowed the possibilities down to a few battles.\nBut the name of the bot who shot would give her the data she needed to go \nright to the battle with him/her in it�and she would be able to identify the \nweapon he had been carrying.\nIt was that simple.\nBut then her scanners located one particular battle in the last ones which \nhad been narrowed.*\n\n� Wait!�\n\n* Her scanners brought in a 3-D grid of the battle, from above, side and \nunder.\nWith a repaired projection device she projected the data image into the air \nin front of Ramulus, a miniature of it there instead of a life-sized \ndiagram. The projection slowly rotating.*\n\n� There�s a single indication of a strange weapon in section 3.F.�\n\n* She highlighted a single bot and moved to life-sized, while deleting the \nremainder of the 3-D scan. Leaving only a projection of the bot. A triangle \nmoved and surrounded the weapon he had in his hands, deleting him and \ndisplaying the weapon in larger then life schematics.\nThe weapon moved to the side a moment while a constantly moving flow of \nwords/data appeared to the left of it.*\n\n� Model 16 A. Used in heavy military facilities. Classified. Used to \nreprogram the enemy or a turncoat from varied distances, also used in \nassassinations.\nHolds 4 chips at one time.\nFirst prototype built in 2391.\nCreator, Skiff  Stankly.\nGood for righties and lefties.\nLast known location: Cybertron Artillery Fair, five stellar-cycles ago.\nLast used: Star-date 34 by 62�last week.\nGrid 23.\n150 yards from perimeter of the Ark.\nNeed I say more?�\n\n___________________________Zyber\n\n* Zyber sat back on her heals once the beast was against the headboard, \nwatching the muscles under his hide relax and slightly wondering just how \nbit they had to be to support the great movement of the creature.\nBut then she simply shrugged, looking back onto the great things face.\nShe heard his quiet words and then looked back to the bowl over the fire, \nthe tea finally boiling and a smooth and fragrant steam rising off the \nsurface of it.\nZyber eased herself to her feet and stepped on the furs of her bed, walking \nover to the filling the stone cup she had brought with the amber colored \nliquid. *\n\n� I drug you here�myself. On my back.�\n\n* She blew on it to cool it a bit before turning towards the bed and walking \nover to it again, sitting at it�s edge and holding cups rip up to the \ncreatures lips.\nZyber tilted her head as she studied the animals features, wondering just \nwhat it could be�but she could never guess. It was everything. *\n\n� Here you go. Drink it lightly and slowly, it is fairly potent. It will \nwarm you up�and begin small repairs of your internals.�\n\n* She waited patiently for him to drink, just hoping that he wouldn�t try \nand lunge out of bed again. *\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
