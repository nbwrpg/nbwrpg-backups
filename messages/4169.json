An image of Magmatron appeared in front of \nBobertron.\n    &quot;Bobertron, give me your ears for just a little while. I know your past \nand I know your proboly heading for Megatron right now. I will know where he \nis if you keep going, and I will tell Hell Beast. Megatron has gone insane, I \nlearned this on Cybertron. He wishes to destroy the Ark, so if you help him \nyou will kill yourself in the process. And if I&#39;m correct you would have made \na copy of the Key, I know you well. If you did Megatron already belives that \nyou are lying, he will kill you. I have enough weapons up here to supply an \narmy. I still wish for you to join me, as second in command. Yes I don&#39;t have \nmany forces now, but I will hopefully have more. If you join me I will let no \nharm come to Megatron while I am here. Remember Megatron has gone insane.&quot;\n\n"}}
