He whips his stinger around a couple of times.\nIn an instant he knows exactly waht had happened to him and what he\ncould now do. He realized he had fallen unconcious on his entrace to\nearth and his head slammed on the computer of his pod.  The heat had\ntransfused the computer into his chips and he was now a supergenius.\nHe had a reason for coming ot earth but the crashed had cleared his\nmemory.He transformed into a vulture and flew high scouting hte area\nwith it&#39;s keen eye. It could spot  adead bot miles away. Which it\ndid.At the CF..or at least almost dead. He took off for the battle of\nthe century.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; The giant ball of fire landed north of the CF somewhere in the Sahera\n&gt; desert.  The pod searched for a suitable life form but the bot inside\n&gt; was somehow samter than before and intstantly reprogramed it to find\n&gt; two suitable bodies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Throug the sky above the War at the CF a ball of fire flies through\n&gt; &gt; the air lighting up the entire area then dissapears in the distance.\n\n\n"}}
