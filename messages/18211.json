SHE was the one who was supposed to be doing this!\nAnd here she was, Iron Raptoe, programed to fight but no common sense on how \nto fix a bot by hand. She was doing everything by common sense and simple \nknow how.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
