He blinks. They had \nwon! The Maximals had just fought back an almost full-scale assault from the \nNewcomers singlehandedly, something that no other faction had done so far (to \nhis knowledge).\n\nHe smiles, looking over the battlefield, but seeing no dead bot. &quot;Everyone, \ngrab a CR chamber, and get repaired!&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;We have \nwon the day!&quot;\n\nWith that, Striker heads to the Ark, keeping a lookout for any bots that \nmight need help.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl looks at the newcomers as they retreat. The Maximals have succsessfully \ndefended themselves! He looks over the battlefield, noting no casualties.\n\n&quot;Ok, see you then,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;The battle&#39;s over. We won!&quot;\n\nWith that, Prowl heads to the equipment room on the Ark. His repairs could \nwait, he still needed to come up with a plan to get Iron Raptor and Tavatron \nout of the Alliance base, the least known base of the three main factions.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus smiles as Striker gives the command to get repaired. Repairs were \nsomething that the ram could use. He headed toward the CR chambers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen and Ramhorn run up to Shadow Wing and Lunarpine.\n\n&quot;We won!&#39; Smokescreen yells. He knew it was childish and silly to go crazy \nover one victory, but it had been so many battles since the Maximals had last \nwon one, that this was almost signifying a new age for them.\n\n"}}
