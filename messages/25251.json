Why wheren&#39;t the \nother Maximals listening? She WAS the leader, wasn&#39;t she? they make it to \nher side, from behind, only to hear her yell for the others to come. Snow \nTech couldn&#39;t belive his ears! They weren&#39;t listening! They kept on with \ntheir savagery, even when bolth sides have ordered a seize fire! Where was \nthe honour in that? Was the maximal group being reduced to a pack of \nhigh-powered savages?*\n\n&quot; Iron Raptor, Snow Tech and Shadow Cat reporting for duty, SIR!&quot;\n\n*He saluted her and grinned his goofy grin while Shadow Cat just sighed and \nshook her head, She knew better than to try and stop him. He only became \nworse. She looked at Iron Raptor and spoke*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t mind him, he&#39;s just being himself. Whats the problem?

But she growled.\n&gt;These Maximals weren&#39;t listening and now the Alliance making them and her\n&gt;look bad. She sighed. What else was new?\n&gt;She knew that it wasn&#39;t right to think that way, but they just weren&#39;t\n&gt;listening!\n&gt;Iron Raptor looked out across the field and saw more Maximals, ones which\n&gt;were not coming to her. Here eyes narrowed.\n&gt;Opening a comm-link....*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Her voice booming over the communicator.&quot; GET YOUR SKIT\n&gt;PLATES OVER HERE ON THE DUBBLE!!! I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re being shot at, \n&gt;just\n&gt;cease fire, quit thinking of yourself and get over here now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* She was slagging sick of their ignoring her, there were more important\n&gt;thing going on here then theyr stupid battle! Like a crew member&#39;s life!\n&gt;Iron Raptor kept her eyes towards the battle field, ready to meet every\n&gt;Maximal that came eye to eye. She was not happy!\n&gt;But the ones that had come she was proud of, those were the Maximals she \n&gt;was\n&gt;looking forward to commanding in the future. And she knew, that inside of\n&gt;each Maximal, even the ones which had not some yet, there was loyalty\n&gt;waiting to get out.\n&gt;Iron Raptor sighed and thought to Prowl....&lt; What am I going to do? They\n&gt;won&#39;t listen. When did they get like this?&gt;\n&gt;But the Maximals weren�t all that bad, and even she had faults. Her temper\n&gt;for one, which was fairly pumped right now.\n&gt;Iron Raptor stood facing the Maximals, glancing towards the ones that had\n&gt;already come.\n&gt;This battle was going to end one way or another, with or without the\n&gt;Maximals. She couldn�t wait forever.*\n&gt;&lt; Come on, you guys! I know you can do better then this!&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
