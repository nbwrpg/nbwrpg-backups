He swears, jumping out of his chair.\n\n&quot;Lock down!&quot; he says into his comm as he pulls out a pistol, \n&quot;Defences activate.&quot;\n\nPlates emerge to cover all the computers, autoguns dropping from the \ncealing to open fire on Skulletron. Chordate adds a few shots \nhimself, furious that someone had tried to attack him in the Maximal \nbase.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;          Skulletron just realized he could&#39;ve been caught spying.  \nHe forgot Perndabot, and walked off.  Hopefully, HotRod was \nreprogrammed now, after being repaired by Feline.  Yes, Skulletron \njust had to setup everybody in the right position, and then, victory \nwould be achieved.  He would have Feline use HotRod to cause some \nchaos, and then, Skulletron would throw away Feline from his \ncabinet.  He would return to Zardus, and tell him the bad news of \nFeline not surviving.  Then, Skulletron just had to pick off of \nZardus&#39; other followers, slowly, and then, Skulletron and Zardus \nwould be the most powerful duo.  Skulletron and Zardus.  \nYesssss..Skulletron was heading to where Chordate was.\n&gt; \n&gt;      He arrived.  He slowly, ever so silently, crept up behind \nChordate, and then quickly grabbed his ray gun and swung it at \nChordate&#39;s head, trying to knock him out.\n\n\n"}}
