Dinobot.\nIron Raptor sighed and rubbed the back of her head for a moment.\nNow, THERE was a bot with an attetude that could cause Feline a few \nproblems.\nHe was big, powerful and mean. Three things that Feline might not be able to \nhandle. And if she was lucky, she might get a full sentance out of him that \ndoesn&#39;t end with a threat.\nIron Raptor sighed again. But he was dependable and vary loyal. She guessed \nthat for those his attetude was worth putting up with.\nBut it was then that Feline seemed to regain her fear again at the mention \nof the Alliance, something that could also become a prob.\nIron Raptor watched Feline sit and shake a bit, walking over to the table \nand sitting on it beside her.*\n\n&quot; I wasn&#39;t planning to send you out alone. That would just be stupid to \nstart with. You&#39;d have a pertner or two, whatever was needed. If Dinobot&#39;s \nin stasis lock you&#39;ll need two bots to carry him alone.&quot;\n\n* She then looked at the holo-image of the Transmetal 2.*\n\n&quot; And the Alliance isn&#39;t what you have to worry about, they&#39;re too far away \nto even bother with you once you got there. Dinobot&#39;s your main problem if \nhe&#39;s still online.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor steadied her seat on the table and crossed her legs, getting a \nlittle more comfortable. Motioning for Prowl to come over there with them so \nthat he didn&#39;t seem so alien to Feline any longer.\nShe then looked at Feline agains to see her reaction, then back at the \nprojaction.*\n\n&quot; I can tell you right now, he&#39;ll reject any help and you&#39;ll probably be met \nwith a pair of Transmetal 2 jaws since he doesn&#39;t know you. And I can bet my \nposition as command that he won&#39;t trust you right off the back either.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then smiled down at Feline.*\n\n&quot; But I can garontee one thing, treat him with respect and he&#39;ll do the same \nfor you.&quot; * she then chuckled.* &quot; How else do you think I manage to live \nwith him?&quot;\n\n* She then looked at the projection and then back at Feline.*\n\n&quot; But I&#39;ll send a few bots with you for protection, just in case. Also to \ncarry a bit of equipment, knowing that Dinobot will definitly be \ndamaged...you&#39;ll need it.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then leaned back on her hands and looked up at the cieling, \ntrying to think quickly of just who she could send with Feline.\nA thoughtful growl sounded from her throat as her mind worked, but the truth \nwas...she didn&#39;t know just who was free and willing to do it. She mostly had \nto think of a few bots that could handle Dinobot&#39;d aggression and not snapp \nback at him in return, that would only make things worse. Especially if he \nwas injured.\nIron Raptor then looked over at Prowl, a little expression on her face \nsaying that she couldn&#39;t really think of any.*\n\n&quot; Prowl? Any...suggentions of who we can send with Feline.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
