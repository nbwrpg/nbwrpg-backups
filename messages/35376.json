The figure belonged to a rather large Autobot, \nthough he was stone drunk. He staggered down the stairs behind the \nother bot, making very little sound even in his condition.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; A lone bot walks through a deserted and run down part of the slums \non\n&gt; Cybertron.  Upon coming to a mound of scraps the bot sits down on \nand\n&gt; goes to kick a small piece out from the pile when all of a sudden \nthe\n&gt; mound opens up reaveling a hole with a stiarway.  He looks into it \nand\n&gt; transforms into his large bug monster mode and his infrared vision\n&gt; comes on. He begins his long descent down into the secret chamber\n&gt; holding the Autobot&#39;s ship, the &#39;Hidden One&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
