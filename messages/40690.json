Dewboy, when did rhesus land? when did he get here? why \nis he\n&gt; &gt; here? Why has noone traded with him but Mustex? Why is he so well\n&gt; &gt; known yet noone speaks of him? How did Mustex get on the island? \nWhy\n&gt; &gt; are you insulting yan? Is it because he cares about making the RPG\n&gt; &gt; fair? Is it because you cant mode like people do in DBZ? Is it \nbecause\n&gt; &gt; he said you cant control a bases shields or another persons \nchars? Is\n&gt; &gt; it his, Rauqs, Megans, and Allorans fault that they made that \nrule and\n&gt; &gt; must now change it so you can be happy?
