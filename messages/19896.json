Requesting \n&gt; permission to enter. I am heavily damaged and need to speak with \nthe \n&gt; leader.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Granted,&quot; Kluster replies, &quot;I&#39;m Kluster, the ship&#39;s captain, I&#39;m \nat \n&gt; the entrance if what you need to say is urgent.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The hatch opens behind Kluster, Shredder limping in. He was leaking \n&gt; mechfluid, and had dents and scorch marks all over his torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Destrons,&quot; he says, breathing a bit heavily as he leans \nagainst \n&gt; a wall, &quot;They&#39;re gonna destroy the Maximals. I got away to warn \nyou, \n&gt; but they nearly kill me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster frowns and taps a few buttons on the console he was near, \n&gt; checking the position of the Destrons. &quot;They and the Predacons are \n&gt; helping us rebuild the Ark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re allied,&quot; Shredder says, his face turning from weary to \n&gt; serious. He was making things up, but he wanted Cerebrus \n&gt; dead, &quot;They&#39;ll get in good with your group, find out stuff about \nyour \n&gt; ship, and then backstab you. I&#39;d know, I used to be a Predacon, and \n&gt; then a Destron. Its normal procedure.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus stops a few miles away from the Alliance base, his scanners \n&gt; reporting gunfire. He activates his comm-link, sending a \ntransmission \n&gt; to the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m at the Alliance base,&quot; he says, &quot;Should I ask Zardus for his \n&gt; help?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto lands at the Cybertronian Fire, passing Shredder, Kluster, \n&gt; Child, and Galvatron and heading toward the CR chambers.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Rex groans, nearly falling out of a CR chamber as the door opens. \nHe \n&gt; was repaired, but his head hurt like the pit from the gas that \n&gt; BrightBlade had gotten him with.\n&gt; \n&gt; He stumbles out of the CR room, heading for his quarters.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kluster,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;I think the Predacon female \n&gt; that infultrated the ship has gotten away. She might have info on \nthe \n&gt; ship, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m gonna take a rest, I&#39;ll be in my quarters \nif \n&gt; anything comes up.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler lands at the Cybertronian Fire, entering and looking at \n&gt; Kluster and the group of bots around him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mangus says that the Alliance is trying to destroy time,&quot; he says \nto \n&gt; Kluster, &quot;I say we get Zardus&#39; opinion on this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster nods. Too many things were happening at once, he didn&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; this. He recieves Ramulus&#39; message, replying to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, tell Zardus I really need to meet with him at the \nCybertronian \n&gt; Fire. This is turning out to be very confusing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He taps a few keys on the console, bringing up a list of Predacons. \n&gt; His eyes narrow as he sees the name Megatron, tapping a few keys.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Megatron would be glad to help in Maximal destruction,&quot; he mutters \n&gt; to himself, looking through scan logs. He recieves Rex&#39;s \n&gt; transmission, not bother to decide. If the Predacons had info on \nthe \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire, they were a definite threat. Maybe the act at \nthe \n&gt; Ark was a trick after all..\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind Kluster, Shredder watches the screen over Kluster&#39;s \nshoulder. \n&gt; The Maximal in front of him seemed to be lost in thought. Shredder \n&gt; smiles to himself. His plan was working.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; (Logo, did Firearm&#39;s attempt at getting Spears&#39; spark temporarily \n&gt; into the machine succeed?)\n\n\n"}}
