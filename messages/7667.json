She thought about how this all looked so \nfamiliar to her.  Something in her felt pity for the bot laying there.\nShe felt something else too.  Like da-ja-voe almost.  She couldn&#39;t \nhelp it.  She stared at the Dracona.  She mumbled something about how \nthis looked so familiar.  She turned and went to seek Scorponok&#39;s \nhelp.  He knew the answers to the questions brewing in her mind.\n\n\n"}}
