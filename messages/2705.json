She growled.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Either get rid of that walking glue stick or don&#39;t follow me, the\nsmell&#39;s\n&gt; getting to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then began to take a small short cut towards the base, through a\nthick\n&gt; forest but the bushes were ideal for cover in case of an attack.\n&gt; It was also the sort of thickness that the toller a bot was the less they\n&gt; could get through it, so Gangon and herself could get through easily since\n&gt; they were lower to the ground but a bot like Lightmare couldn&#39;t even hope\nto\n&gt; get through.\n&gt; BrightBlade then walked up a small hill covered with pine needles, the\nhill\n&gt; declined sharply so she then decided to jump down. She would have landed\n&gt; with ease if there hadn&#39;t been for a small dip hidden and filled with\n&gt; needles. Her foot sank into the hole and slightly twisted as her other\nfoot\n&gt; came down beside it but out of the hole.\n&gt; BrightBlade yipped in surprise and a bit of pain, she lifted her foot out\nof\n&gt; the hole and looked it over. Twisted ankle.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh, great! Just what I needed!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *She then growled but then kept on walking towards the base, a slightly\n&gt; pained look on her face and limping heavily. But she didn&#39;t care, mainly\nfor\n&gt; the reason that no one else cared.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving\n&gt; more each month?
