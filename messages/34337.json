The volcano suddenly blows its top, and before they\nknow it, the Lavacons are buried under tons of ashes and lava, perhaps\nto be reawakened some other day.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc looks down at his wrist as a small device beeps, his eyes\nwidening.\n\n&quot;Warmachines, our ride home has arrived,&quot; he says over his comm, &quot;Lets\nget out of here.&quot;\n\nHe walks out of the Iron Fist, transforming into vehicle mode and\nflying off toward the ship that had just gotten to earth to take the\nWarmachines back, Repressor following him.\n\n\n"}}
