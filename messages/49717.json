I&#39;ve heard that story plenty of times, bub.  And it&#39;s \nalways \n&gt; a flat-out LIE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that you&#39;ve seen my knee-jerk opinion of your arguement, how \n&gt; about something a little more thoughtful ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me remind you that I DID put a cap on the weapon&#39;s firing rate -\n \n&gt; albeit belatedly.  Not to mention Wheeljack-X isn&#39;t the type of \n&gt; fellow to take advantage of a stasis-locked bot unless they did \n&gt; something to REALLY tick him off, which is a legendary feat in and \nof \n&gt; itself.  Depending on the size of the character, and the relative \n&gt; vulnerability to magnetism (there IS a difference between bots in \n&gt; that regard, see below), and of course individual tendencies to \nallow \n&gt; damage to characters, it could take three shots, or six, or ten, \n&gt; etc.  This is the same with most other weapons, you know.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, individual bots may have different susceptibility to \n&gt; magnetic fields.  Those with plasma-based weapons are in real \n&gt; trouble, as are those with more sophisticated circuitry.  (In case \n&gt; you didn&#39;t know, plasma is easily affected by magnetism.)\n&gt; \n&gt; And a quick physics lesson for those who are in dire need of such \n&gt; education: an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a rapidly-spreading \n&gt; burst along most or all of the electromagnetic spectrum.  A \nmagnetic \n&gt; field (note the obvious terminology difference: pulse vs field) is \na \n&gt; set of force lines that loop back on themselves - affecting only a \n&gt; few parts of the same spectrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Look, the main reason I asked to hold firing your new weapon was \n&gt; &gt; because I was not certain of wether it was in the bounds of \n&gt; legality \n&gt; &gt; or not. The way I saw it was that the weapon could send a bot to \n&gt; &gt; stasis lock in no time. We&#39;d like to keep this rpg as fair to \n&gt; everyone \n&gt; &gt; as possible. That&#39;s all and there&#39;s no reason to say we don&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; new \n&gt; &gt; ideas just because of that.\n\n\n"}}
