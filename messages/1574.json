She knew nothing of any dangers that were going on. She let her mind wander..\n\nIt would be nice to have a partner.. she suddenly thought, wondering where that had come from. But did bots really feel love? Yes.. they did. She had seen Brightblade and Gangon.. Dinobot and Tavatron.. and others. They had love for one another.. even though they really didn&#39;t show it. It was nice to have friends, Teltoli thought, but a partner would be great.. it would fill that little place in her heart..\n\nThe Fuzor wondered mildly if Liono had a girlfriend. She doubted it.. who on earth would date a guy like him? Sure he saves his friends.. and helps them.. but what about Maximals he didn&#39;t know? He didn&#39;t even blink an eyelid at them. She reckoned Iron Raptor would make a much better leader.. even if she had only met her for a while.....\n\n--------------------\nTeltoli Silverflight\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
