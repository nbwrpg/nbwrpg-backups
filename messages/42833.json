She transformed into \nbot mode and ran for cover.  She dove behind a large rock and hid \nfrom the autocannons.  She groaned at the pain in her shoulder.  She \nlooked around. &quot;Those auto defence systems shouldn&#39;t have kicked in \nunless there is a maximal out here. Well, I&#39;m not staying here and \nletting some crazied maximal take me out. I&#39;ll just have to get them \nbefore they get me.&quot;  She turned on her scanner and checked the area. \nA strange maximal signature showed up on her scanner. It was right \nthere were she was.  She grabbed her photon pistol,jumped up and \nlooked around. IN jumping up, the auto lazars homed in on her and \nfired.  She ducked back behind the rock. &quot;OK Maximal, come out and \nsurrender. Your out numbered and out gunned.&quot;  But there was no \nanswer. The ships Autoguns fired a large plasma round at her.  It \nwent up in a big explosion a few yards away from her.  She screamed \nin fear and went running away from the ship as fast as she could. \n\nIt took her a few minutes and some fancy foot work to get out of the \nhail of lazar fire.  She fell to her knees and tried to catch her \nbreath. She checked her scanners again, hoping the maximal that had \nset off the autosystems wasn&#39;t anywhere near her. The blip on the \nscanner showed her and that maximal signature standing right next to \neach other.  She grabbed her gun again and looked around. NO one was \naround. Yet this strange maximal signal was right there. Her scanner \ncouldn&#39;t be malfunctioning, could it?  She looked around and sniffed \nthe air. She could smell the after scent of lazar fire, but no other \nbots near by.  She looked at her shoulder and saw the glowing mech \nfluid oozing out of the wound.  She winced and groaned. &quot;This just \nisn&#39;t my day.&quot;  She shook her head and started walking.  She didn&#39;t \nknow where she was going, or in what direction.  She just walked away \nfrom the ship. Perhaps Galvatron had set off the system and just \ndidn&#39;t want her around anymore?  She couldn&#39;t figure out what had set \noff the systems. She stayed in bot mode and kept walking.  \n\n\n"}}
