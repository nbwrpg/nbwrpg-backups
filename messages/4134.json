Take all \nthe time you need replying.)\n\nTavatron snarled softly to herself. Why did she care what happened to him? \nHe was just one of hundreds of &#39;bots she had known over the years, what made \nhim so... so... different? She sighed inwardly, now was neither the time nor \nthe place to contemplate her feelings. She had to strain her ears to hear \nhim draw his breath. When most &#39;bots would be breathing quite heavily his \nbreaths were low and shallow.\n\nTavatron watched as he fell after his first attempt to rise, her own concern \ngrowing, but not nearly as evident as before. She wanted to reach out and \nhelp him, but held back, he had to do this on his own. Besides, there wasn&#39;t \na single part of his body that she could touch without causing immense pain \nof some kind.\n\nTavatron held her breath as she waited for Dinobot to attempt to stand \nagain, and fail. She was worried, but why?! Why in the inferno did she care \nwhat happened to him? She had always been a loner, rarely making, much less \nbeing able to keep friends. Tavatron breathed a sigh of relief when Dinobot \nstood, her concern finally subsiding. She stepped back as his repair system \ntook care of some of his more... prominant damage, hopefully making walking \na little easier.\n\nTavatron walked over to him and placed his hand on her shoulder, indicating \nthat he should use her for support:\n\n&quot;You know, you&#39;ve got to stop saving me like this, you&#39;re going to get your \nself killed one of these days.&quot;\n\nTavatron smiled up at him, she was joking of course, but was obviously \nrelived that he was able to stand.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
