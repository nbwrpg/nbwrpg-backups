He unbuckled Dark Mouse, \nejected her into the air, went to bot mode and caught her on the way \ndown. He walke dinto the base and found KitKat.\n\n&quot;Hey KitKat. We found this bot talking with Inferno. I captured it, \nbut I&#39;ve got to go back and help Drillbit fight Inferno. You do what \nyou want with....hey, what&#39;s the matter? You seem upset?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nThe Trainers arrived so that thye could see the CF, but could not be \npicked up on scans. They were cloaked, but that only worked for sight \nunless you had stealth cloak. Prebon pulled out the Tamer and checked \nthe scan for Spears.\n\n&quot;Damn it! They must have taken her inside. We&#39;re too late. She&#39;s in \nstasis. But perhaps their is a way to still get ahead in this. I can \nsend messages and extra energy through the link that I have \nestablished between myself and the chips. It could help the Trainer \nprogram win permanantly. The Maximal chip would still be there, and \nwould work again with repair, but without repair it would just be \ndormant. She would attack all those around her, and with the \ndistraction we could storm this new ship of theirs. And if that \ndoesn&#39;t work, the moment they remove the Trainer chip, if the can \nfind a way to do it without killing her, I simply give the self \ndestruct order and boom! We&#39;re down a few Maximals. I&#39;ll try the \nfirst plan first.&quot;\n\nPrbon began communicating with the Trainer chip.\n\n*Come on Spears! You can win this! Come back to me! Defeat the \nMaximals!*\n\nPrebon kept repeating this message while sending small boosts of \nenergy to the chip.\n\n\n"}}
