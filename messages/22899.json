She watched it engulf the body \nof Quickstrike.  She closed her eyes and let a single tear fall down \nher cheek. Good Bye old friend, she thought. Then she got a strange \nidea.  She would wait until they had left and she would go and get a \nDNA sample from the body and clone him. Like she was doing already \nfor KitKat, she could do for Quickstrike. \n\nShe would wait, and then bring back her friend.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He steps back as Killfest shoots.
