Is he having any\nsuccess in stealing our units?&quot;\n\n&quot;No sir.&quot; Krytek&#39;s hands moved smoothly across his control panel as he\nspoke. &quot;I am countermanding any spurious orders they are receiving, and\nam setting up encrypted command codes. The X-6 units are\nunsophisticated units, had I not been monitoring them, it is possible\nthat this unit would have succeeded in his attempt.&quot;\n\nVorpal&#39;s optics dimmed as his own screens still showed the estimated\ntime of Cyclonus&#39; arrival, they were nearly here. &quot;Continue with the\ntest then, and apprise Cyclonus of the situation.&quot;\n\n&quot;Understood.&quot; Krytek&#39;s cold voice acknowledged the command.\n\n -------------------------------\n\nBack on the surface of the moon:\n\n--- Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; AzureBlade: Wha... ? [He staggers a bit] Hold on, Minion, I&#39;ll take\n&gt; care of you in a moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; He stops sending the panic attack at Animus, and instead concentrates\n&gt; on his own mechanical processes. By the same way his armor repairs\n&gt; itself, he starts consciously &quot;repairing&quot; the spheres, trying to\n&gt; persuade them that they are a part of him, that they are him. The\n&gt; energy drain is high, but he still has enough power to do something.\n&gt;\n&gt; Azureblade: See you in hell.\n&gt; \n&gt; He aims and shoots two missile at point blank range at Animus.\n\nThe spheres successfully resist the attempt to be repaired even as they\ncontinue to attempt to leech power from Azureblade. As he fired his\nmissiles tendrils of energy lash out out at the missiles from a few of\nthe spheres scoring their hulls and causing their power levels to drop.\n\nThe missiles though still maintain much of their deadly power, although\nAnimus does not. Animus continued to back away smiling at Azureblade\nuntil he sees the twin streaks launch at him. With a last ditch effort\nhe attempts to throw up a shield, but it is not enough ... \n\n**BOOM!!** \n\nFlames erupt from the point of impact and debris is ripped from the\nground: stone, rock, metal all scatter across the surface of the ground\nas a new crater appears on the surface of the moon. If Animus survived,\nhe is no longer visible to the naked optic.\n\nAbove Azureblade in the distance something like a large black fog\ndrifted between him and the sun for a moment. If an observer had\nbinocular vision they might determine they are ships, many of them. As\nquickly and silently as the apparition came it began to drift on. At\nthe last moment though, just as the last of the armada was vanishing\ninto the ebony backdrop of space, five units detached from the main\ngroup and began moving at high speed toward Azureblade&#39;s location. Even\nas this happened the spheres attached to Azureblade&#39;s frame grew\nheavier and heavier, attempting to leech power from him, draining from\nhim the very ability to resist!!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
