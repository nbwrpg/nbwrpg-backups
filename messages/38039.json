On another portion of the ship, two small portions \nopen \n&gt; &gt; up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; before two odd looking ships seemingly flying like a vertical \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exit and fire out into the ocean. Each then flys off towards \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surface before they break through and the bottom folds out into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wings. Each one passenger ship then speeds off towards the \n&gt; location \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the IGL transmission.\n\n\n"}}
