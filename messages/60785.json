You should know by now \nthat \n&gt; those pretentious Tripredacus have taken Cybertron and control it \n&gt; with an Iron Fist. The refugees of the war, both Maximals and \n&gt; Predacons, fled to Earth and tried to work together. Fools they \nare! \n&gt; They simply deny their true nature as heirs to the Decepticons!\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at Hydras straight in his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vykos: We have to let news of Maximal failures reach Modern day \n&gt; Earth. We have to show our lost brothers that only they hold the \nkeys \n&gt; to the future! However, I have only limited manpower. Even though \n&gt; Warghoul is powerful, he cannot do things alone. What do you think \nof \n&gt; my little plan?\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Warghoul identified the new Megatron.
