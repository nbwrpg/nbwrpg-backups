He&#39;d survived \nhis first battle in this form and gotten away with minor injuries \ncompared to many of the others. It bothered him though that he only \ngot to scrap one Predicon, and to do that he still needed Shadow \nWings help. Maybe the Predicons on this planet won&#39;t be easy to \ndefeat after all. One of his prey did this damage. A rams not \nsupposed to hurt a wolf. \n\n&quot;They&#39;re retreating?&quot; maybe his arrival was on timeto do more than \npick up the pieces.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Inferno731@a... wrote:\n&gt; The last dagger goes through Ares leg and he can&#39;t get up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shuko: Yes Zeus that would be a good idea.
