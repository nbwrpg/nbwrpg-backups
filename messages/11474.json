Avenge? With troops? No, \nthat isn&#39;t the way.\n\n&quot;What do you want? To go in there, blasters open and slag them all? I \ndon&#39;t think so. My way is peace. That is what Soundwave died for, and \nhe would not want it to change. If we start war on the alliance, than \npeace can never be accomplished. If you really want to remember \nSoundwave&#39;s memory, as I do, since he was a great friend of mine, \nthan help me win over the alliance. Come with me to their base, and \namke Zardus listen to us. Not with troops. Just myself and you. And \nperhaps a thirs, because another one is coming soon. I don&#39;t know \nwhen, but I sent a message. But for now, come in and I will show you \nwhat my mission is about.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
