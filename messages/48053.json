In case the\n&gt; predicons attack I don&#39;t want the armor of the ship\n&gt; buckling under an initial attack. Mind you just mark\n&gt; locations where repairs are needed, we&#39;ll worry\n&gt; about the actual repairs tomorrow. Once you&#39;re done\n&gt; inspecting the ship join any other bots in the mess\n&gt; hall or get some rest, I want every bot at 100% for\n&gt; the days ahead.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
