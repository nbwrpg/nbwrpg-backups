In\nhis current condition it wouldn&#39;t be a difficult task to obey.

His pain fealt as if it\n&gt; would break out of his head and travel down his arms. He knew that\n&gt; something bad had happened, he could feal the cr chamber keeping him\n&gt; sedated. He looked around the room &quot;BIG MISTAKE&quot; he thought as the\n&gt; room seemed to spin. He would&#39;ve tossed his &quot;cookies&quot; (little comp.\n&gt; joke) if he had an organic stomach. His adrenaline rush had gone but\n&gt; now he had to deal with the hangover that followed.\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: dcoburn\n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, March 29, 2001 12:14 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: BlackFortress&#39;s Cr\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   ::Orchestra::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Orchestra nodded, and patted Chameleon on the back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Ya, let&#39;s drink.
