She \ncouldn&#39;t break her concentration now, despite what Lunarpine said.  \nShe was about to change the image again when she heard him say \nVeratis.  That broke her train of thought.  Her image in Megaton&#39;s \nmind stop and she stared up at him. &quot;What did you say? What&#39;s Veratis \nhave to do with this?&quot;  She realized she fell for a trick and started \nup the image again.  Only, this time, she put up the image of energon \nbars and caged Megaton inside.  If he tried to reach the bars, he&#39;d \nthink he was being shocked. Or at least, she tried to make him think \nthis.  The strain was showing and her body was trembling.  Her mind \nstarted going in differant directions.  Without knowing it, she had \nsent the same image to Lunarpine as well as MegaTon. Her power supply \nwas getting low, but she couldn&#39;t let Megaton destroy her friends, or \nthe bot she cared for.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megaton didn&#39;t understand what could be happening to him, he was \nperfect,\n&gt; the ideal Pred. He tried to think logically, how was it that he \nhadn&#39;t\n&gt; transformed? (He did but Ice&#39;s telepathy keeps him from knowing \nit.) He\n&gt; turned around to where Ice lay, he knew that either her or \nLunarpine were\n&gt; causing this. He decided to try some more logic, &quot;You haven&#39;t told \nthem what\n&gt; Veratis intends for the Maximals when his army of mutants are \ncomplete have\n&gt; you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine rushed to Ice&#39;s side, he could see her strain. &quot;I don&#39;t \nknow what\n&gt; you&#39;re doing to him but I want you to stop before you hurt \nyourself.&quot; His\n&gt; concern for her was interupted by Megatons comment about \nVeratis. &quot;Shut up\n&gt; monster or I&#39;ll show you whats in store for ANY traitor who comes \naround\n&gt; me.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
