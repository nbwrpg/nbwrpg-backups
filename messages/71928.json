However we can assume\n&gt; that =\r\nVice Grip had not calibrated his scanner to detect in that fasion\n&gt; and so =\r\nit came up as false?\n\nOOC - Yeah, conjoined sparks are pretty much unknown =\r\non Cybertron, unless you&#39;re a high end tech or medic.  I&#39;m pretty sure his =\r\nscanners, while they would detect it, he&#39;s not technically inclined enough =\r\nto realize it has Megatron&#39;s spark and another in it.\n\nSo, basically he&#39;s s=\r\ncanning for Megatron&#39;s spark, but because the reading is not the exact same=\r\n Megatron as he has scanner results for, given it reads differently and he&#39;=\r\ns not that bright as far as tech goes, he&#39;s just leaping to teh conclusion =\r\nit&#39;s not Megatron.  \n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a grunt front INFERNO as =\r\nVICE GRIP&#39;s readings showed false.\n&gt; &quot;How dare you speak against the ruling=\r\n monarch over our illustrious\n&gt; force.&quot; INFERNO&#39;s voice imperious as he kep=\r\nt himself between HYDRAS\n&gt; and VICE GRIP.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is no trick Vice Grip.&quot; =\r\nCRYOTEK said in obviously annoyed tones.\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps we need to update your =\r\nsensors a bit.&quot; He was about to say\n&gt; more when HYDRAS cut in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD =\r\n- Hydras&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras:: Hydras hissed annoyed and said &quot;I&#39;ll dicispline =\r\nmy troops by\n&gt; &gt; myself... and YOU, Vice Grip... COME And wed disscuse it i=\r\nn the way that\n&gt; &gt; MEgatron, myself, used to do it in a FIGTH!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK shook his head as he grumbled, &quot;This feels more l=\r\nike the\n&gt; Galvatron in him then the Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BRUTICUS X and WASPINAT=\r\nOR merely stepped aside as HYDRAS indicated he\n&gt; was going to fight, a cert=\r\nain level of eager anticipation on their\n&gt; face. It had been a while since =\r\nthey had seen their leader open up on\n&gt; someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFERNO was reluctant=\r\n to step aside, his desire to protect HYDRAS at\n&gt; war with his ingrained ob=\r\nedience to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a wicked smile from IGUANUS, &quot;I had a simila=\r\nr reaction to\n&gt; &#39;im.&quot; he chuckled as he casually hefted his rifle onto his =\r\nshoulder.\n&gt; He shrugged, &quot;It&#39;ll all come out soon enough.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DI=\r\nNOBOT AND HYDRAS&gt;\n\nAt this point, VICE GRIP hissed, &quot;Galvatron and Megatron=\r\n?  What sort of absurdity is this?&quot;  HIs twin pincers going to power up the=\r\nn, seeing he was surrounded, &quot;What sort of ludicrous assembly have you forc=\r\ned me upon, Criminal?&quot;\n\nTaking a few steps away then as he saw HYDRAS going=\r\n towards him, his claws up, &quot;If there is any of MEgatron in you, I must apo=\r\nlogize for what I will do to free him from whatever you have forced him to,=\r\n CDriminal!&quot;  Thinking if tehre was anything &#39;here&#39; it was the diong of CRY=\r\nOTEK!\n\nAt this point, his body powering up then as he went to ready himsel =\r\nffor a fight with HYDRAS..\n\nNot aware of the overrides that CRYOTEK had put=\r\n within him!\n\nAt this point, DINOBOT walked back along with IGUANAS as he t=\r\nook a few steps back around the rapidly forming battle circle, &quot;Pah.
