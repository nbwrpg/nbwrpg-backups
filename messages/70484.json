Take heart, this is for the best, and I know it will help Rodimus immensely. Something inside me is telling me so.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He enters the room and gets his bearings so is not to knock anything over or trip over anyone. His sensors quickly leading him to Rodimus as he finds his way over to where he lies. He then nods to Stanton and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All right, tell me what I have to do and I will do it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hang in there Rodimus, I&#39;m comming. I promised to save you and I will save you.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon entered the room Santon stepped out and guided him over\ntowards the bed. At the same time Legacy slid over another operating\nbed so that it lay next to Rodimus.\n\nBump, who was still continuing to work freed another small portion of\nRodimus&#39; frame and he quickly attached power allocation cables to the\nspot.\n\nSanton nodded, satisfied at Bump&#39;s progress and then turned back to\nTuscon, &quot;Rodimus&#39; life signs are beginning to fail. We will need you\nto continue giving your unique spark energy to him. This would give us\nmore time to complete this.&quot;\n\nBump looked up from his position over Rodimus, &quot;The problem is we\ndon&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s draining him, and we don&#39;t know what risk\nthere is to you.&quot;\n\nSanton looked back at Tuscon, &quot;He&#39;s right. If you don&#39;t want to do\nthis, we will understand. But if you do, then lie back and I will\nconnect you.&quot;\n\n*    *     *     *     *\n\nMeanwhile in the observation room Silverbolt stood once again silently\nobserving Rodimus, his own optics dark and worried as Airhammer and\nNoctorro stood next to him. &quot;Have no fear Lady Talon.&quot; Silverbolt\nsaid, his voice confident, &quot;The valiant Tuscon Prime will prevail.&quot;\n\nWhile Silverbolt seemed confident and assured, Airhammer and Noctorro\nseemed to wear more worried expressions.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
