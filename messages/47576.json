Yesterday I\n&gt;got Transformers the movie and after watching it 3 times I came to\n&gt;the conclusion IT&#39;S AN INSULT TO EVERYTHING BM AND BW!  The Autos and\n&gt;Decepts were suppose to be smarter than there descendants, but\n&gt;Megatron had to use the Trgan Horse tactic that&#39;s been outdated for\n&gt;2,000 years on Earth and the Decepts should have radioed a need for\n&gt;repairs and NOT stood close to the hole.  How dumb can they be.  Also\n&gt;the Autos tried to get the Dinobots in the shuttle first even though\n&gt;they were the strongest fighters and should have been last.  In fact\n&gt;I think they were the only ones doing in damage in the later fight\n&gt;against Unicron.  And why were they so happy at the end when they had\n&gt;used up the Matrix&#39;s energy and basically destroyed their own version\n&gt;of heaven?  I prefer BM standards where the Matrix is everywhere and\n&gt;eternal.  And just to be annoying can I have Spike?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n"}}
