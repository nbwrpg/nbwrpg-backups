The pod\n  stayed in st=\r\natis mode for all this time. Now, as the programs dictate,\n  the bot awaken=\r\ns.  \n\n  The optics flicker. The hydrolics in the joints move.  The spark pu=\r\nmps\n  mech fluid.  Power levels rise and programs reactive.  The life of th=\r\ne\n  bot restarts and the Matrix wills another to join the fight of the\n  un=\r\niverse for the universe. \n\n  The pod opens. A hand reaches up and lightly c=\r\nlasps the rim.  Sitting\n  up, the bot looks about.  Blue sky, white clouds =\r\nfloat over head.  The\n  sun shines down warmth and light.  A gentle breeze =\r\ncaresses the face\n  plates of the bot. A scent on the wind, barely noticibl=\r\ne, but there\n  all the same.  Causion stirs in the mind of the bot.  Optics=\r\n focus,\n  autio sencors adjust to listen for the slightest noise.  The bot\n=\r\n  stands up, not a sound is made.  She stands in white and gold\n  transmeta=\r\nl skin.  Her form small, yet powerful.  She looks up again. \n  With a sigh,=\r\n transforms into BARN OWL form and takes to the skies. Not\n  a sound is mad=\r\ne as she changes her shape.  She rises to just above the\n  tree tops and sl=\r\nowly surveys her new home.  \n\n  She lets her talons spread as she glides do=\r\nwn silently and perches on\n  a tree branch high in the trees.   She looks a=\r\nbout her and wonders how\n  she came to be here.  She checks her programs, a=\r\nll seem to be\n  functional except her mission logs where wiped out during h=\r\ner\n  transport.  On her left ankle, she could see a symbol. It was Maximal.=\r\n\n  But she knew not what it meant.  She searched her memory banks for\n  her=\r\n identity in hopes it would give her a clue as to why she was\n  there.  Her=\r\n name, was &quot;SILENCE&quot;.   Her programmed instincts told her\n  to seek out oth=\r\ner maximals. Other than that, she knew not what to do.  \n\n  She spread her =\r\nsoft white wings and let her body take to the wind. \n  Her form glided effo=\r\nrtlessly back towards the pod.  She landed on the\n  edge and with her beak,=\r\n she hit the homing beacon on the pod.  A\n  maximal signal would be sent ou=\r\nt. With luck, they would find her soon.\n  With that accomplished, she flew =\r\nup back into the trees and hid.  She\n  knew that if maximals could find her=\r\n signal, others might too.  She\n  hid herself in the trees, but kept a shar=\r\np owl eye on the pod.  \n  She waited, she watched, in perfect...silence. \n\n=\r\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
