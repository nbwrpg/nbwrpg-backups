Riekan kicks at Ragnar, hoping to drive him back a \nbit, and fires again.\n\nThe shots pepper Pumpskin&#39;s hide, but fail to penetrate.  &#39;Relative&#39; \nleaves a lot open, and the warrior&#39;s weak points are still tough.  \nWhen he hears what Blackfang has to say, he stops and thinks about \nit.  &quot;You know, that&#39;s a very good point.  Why am I doing this?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ragnar raised his arm and the harpoon exploded. A searing burn ran \n&gt; across his arm, but he managed to twist enough to fire his Gauss at \n&gt; Fury. The slug went straight at the knife, which would break \n&gt; inevitably, and past it at Fury.\n&gt; \n&gt; The blond Clansman looked at his limb and saw it in a bloddy \nmetallic \n&gt; mess. Adrenaline was still high, but he would not last.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya saw a breach and fired between the tentacles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang leaped back and out of most of the tentacles way. \nHowever, \n&gt; his shotgun was taken out of his grip. He drew his pulse laser and \n&gt; fired small quick shots as near as he could to the gash.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Why the hell are you doing this then? You&#39;re on our side!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Riekan takes the hit, all right, but he&#39;s sturdy enough to \nmaintain \n&gt; &gt; his point-blank position long enough to fire his harpoon gun.  At \n&gt; &gt; this range, Ragnar could be ripped wide open by such a blast.  \nFury \n&gt; &gt; whirls his blade, waiting for another opening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of the fire impacts on Pumpskin&#39;s self-regenerating limbs, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang scores a solid body hit with his last shot - and this \n&gt; wound \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t close itself up right away, betraying the relative \n&gt; &gt; vulnerability of his torso.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hee hee, you&#39;re a perceptive one!&quot; Pumpskin chuckles as he \nflails \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; both directions, looking to give each of them a two-tentacle \nhug.  \n&gt; &gt; All four appendages stretch out to their maximum length again.\n\n\n"}}
