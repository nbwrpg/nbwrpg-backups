He \n&gt; &gt; patiently waited that she woke up\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima came to. As her optics - which were once clear blue, were \nnow crimson \n&gt; red - flashed brightly. She sat up & swung her new legs over the \nside of the \n&gt; table. Then leapt off the table. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her sleek new form more metallic than the last one, was nearly as \ndangerous \n&gt; as her old style form. \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to face Perceptor. &quot;You have done well, Perceptor. You \nare to be \n&gt; commended.&quot; Her voice this time was less feline & more like her \nold original \n&gt; voice. There was more of her orginal form to this new appearance \nthan her \n&gt; previous techno -organic form. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now... at full power & strength.. she was ready for anything. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics glanced about, then spotted off into the CR the form of \nHydras. \n&gt; &quot;Status on Hydras,&quot; she asked.\n\n\n"}}
