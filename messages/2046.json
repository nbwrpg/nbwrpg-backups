Carnage didn&#39;t laugh, she had seen quite a few of her targets do that just before they knew that they were going to die and that never got them anywhere, did it?\nShe looked at Teltoli seriously and then towards the lake, she watched as a slight wind came up and began to form ripples on the surface. She heard Teltoli&#39;s question about is she had killed Megatron yet, that comment seemed to bring the pain of her dead friend right to the surface again! Her spark ached and her shoulders slumped, this day never did start out right for her had it?!*\n\n&quot; I wish!&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
