Well that wasn&#39;t so hard so I guess I would definitely put\n&gt; marksmanship, recon and decoy tactics as my skills. And if I were ta form a\n&gt; team it would include Talon, Nightlight, and yes you&#39;ll freak over the next\n&gt; choice, Elita.  But she would be with her mom at all times and I doubt\n&gt; anything or anyone would harm her if Nightlight had anything ta say about\n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She looks to Talon with confidence and back to Leo the same way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just because we&#39;re femme bots doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re helpless.  I know we can\n&gt; do it just as well as you guys can.  So what do ya think?  Can ya give us a\n&gt; chance?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs STRAIGHT SHOT named off the choices she would make to add to her\ngroup there was nod from LEO, that is until she came to ELITA where\nhis nod became a shake of the head. &quot;You are right if you mean I am\nnot going to allow it. She is much to young.&quot;\n\nLEO straighted as he put his hands on his hip which had the\nunintentional affect of allowing the lion&#39;s head on his chest gaze out\nat those in the room as well. &quot;If you wish to train her and get her\nready for such an ordeal that is one things, but if you mean take her\nout in the field under dangerous conditions, that would be another.&quot;\n\nThere was a frown, &quot;And that would also mean that her training would\nbe here in or around the the safety of the Ark until such time as she\nis deemed fit to do more. *AND* . . . &quot; LEO stressed the word &#39;and&#39; &quot;.\n. .  I would have to have her parent&#39;s permission.&quot;\n\nOOC: Please keep in mind that Elita is portrayed as a young child,\nwith the maturity level of a human 6-8 years of age.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
