They could not lead him to the base. He was not a very \ngood stealth bot was he? or maybe his ego was so big it blinds his \nsenjudgment. Savior powered up his shields and Gabriel pulled his sowrd of \nfaith. (saviors main weapon is that his shields gather the energy fired on \nhim and shoots it back. like optimus primal in beast machines.) Savior flew \nbehind the bot while Gabriel shot at him with his wrist guns. Savior flew up \nfull speed from behind and attempted to put him in a full nelson lock to \nblock and defence of the bots against gabriels shots.\n\n"}}
