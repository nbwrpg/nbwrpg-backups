She sneered at his back.  \nShe hated this thing.  It not only smelled bad, but it gave her the \ncreeps.  The energon boiled in her veins.  She hated letting this \ncreature just walk in and do as he pleased.  She felt anger rage \nthrough her.  But what hurt more, was the fact she could do nothing.  \nher leader just let them walk around.  Megatron made no attemp to \nstop them.  Black Aracnia seemed to show no sign of even trying to \nstop anything.  She looked at Quickstrike,&quot; My friend, I have had \nenough of this.   I will fight in a war, but I shall not share in the \ndeath of the world in this manner.&quot;  She walked off in mouse mode, \nheaded away from the cave, the base and away from it all.  She headed \nfor the caves that were far into the mountains and away from the \nwars.  She knew she would be able to hole up there adn wait for \neveryone to kill themselves.  Then she would join who ever was left.\n\nShe stopped and looked at Quickstrike one last time.\n\n\n\n- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Hell Beast looked over the crowd standing before him. Apollo \nchose the \n&gt; body, and in fact controlled it. This wasnt the real Hell Beast, \njust a \n&gt; replica to get a rather messy job done.\n&gt;     &quot;What are you trying to pull? Put your hands in the air or \nprepare to get \n&gt; fried!&quot; Aracnia said as she drew her bowcaster.\n&gt;     Hell Beast, better yet, Apollo, laughed at her. &quot;Foolish \ntransformer. You \n&gt; do not know what your dealing with. Stand aside or I will be forced \nto \n&gt; destroy you.&quot;\n&gt;     Tarantulas didnt like it ethier. He hated the Vok, and these \nAliens were \n&gt; far more annoying. &quot;What do you want, exactly. Maximals? We have \nthree of \n&gt; them.....take them if you like.&quot;\n&gt;     Hell Beast glanced over to them. The Armada would be able to \ndrain there \n&gt; energy to power several different functions. &quot;Very well. I will \ntake the \n&gt; Maximals. But for now I am going into that bunker to further my \n&gt; investigation.&quot;\n&gt;     The Predacons agreed and let him go, but what no one saw was \nMegatron \n&gt; sneaking away secretly, back to the Cave.\n\n\n"}}
