A Canine figure jumps out of the pod. She looks about and \nruns through the trees.  She hoped that no one saw the pod land.  She ran \nthrough the forest looking for a spot to hide in.  She stopped and sniffed \nthe air.  She smelled other wolves in the area.  Two males to be exact. This \nmade her nervious.  She ran untill she came to a lake.  She didn&#39;t see \nanyone and went to the waters edge.  She started to drink when something \nmoved in the water. She jumped back.  An otter poked it&#39;s head from the \nwater&#39;s surface and looked at the canine bot.\n\nFidgit: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;\n\nKitKat: &quot;I&#39;m well.&quot;\n\nFidgit: &quot;That&#39;s good to hear.  I&#39;m Fidgit.  I&#39;m a Maximal.  Who are you?&quot;\n\nKitKat: &quot;My name is KitKat,  I&#39;m a...a..&quot; she looked at the symbol on her \narm and looked back at the otter. &quot;I&#39;m not sure.  The crash rattled me a \nbit.  What is this symbol on my shoulder?&quot;\n\nFidgit: She looked at the symbol. &quot;Oh my, that&#39;s not a maximal symbol.  \nThat&#39;s a Predacon symbol.&quot;\n\nKitKat: &quot;Oh. Well then, I guess I should be on my way then.&quot;  With that she \nwalked off into the forest.\n\nFidgit: She watched as the wolf walked away.  She wondered how a nice bot \ncan be a Predacon.  After all, it wasn&#39;t everyday that a Maximal and a \nPredacon have a civil conversation.  She dove back into the water and swam \nto her spark&#39;s content.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
