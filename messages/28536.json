Galvatron, he thought, he knew that many off\n&gt; his soldiers felt hatred for him, but it was a gamble when he spoke the\n&gt; words, as the Predacons never showed this hatred towards him. Megatron\n&gt; chose his words carefully, still standing tall, to try and show his power,\n&gt; &quot;Galvatron, is on this planet, and has tampered with me, and my destiny.
