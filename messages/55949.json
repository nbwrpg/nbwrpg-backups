Phoenix shudders and pulls \ncloser to Flicker, having been the only member of the group who was \naround when Pumpskin joined the Predacons.\n\n&quot;Better be careful, guys,&quot; she whispers.  &quot;That pumpkin&#39;s missing a \nfew seeds, if you take my meaning.&quot;  She means, of course, that this \nparticular Pred belongs in a rubber-lined stasis pod - which was \nactually where they found him.\n\n&quot;Eeheehee, hello everyone.&quot;  A sickening cackle rattle emanates from \nPumpskin&#39;s fanged mouth.  &quot;What&#39;s this, new Predacons?

She \n&gt; was using her hightened hearing and sonic wave hear what was being \n&gt; said about the room. So far, other than Flicker showing her no \ntrust, \n&gt; which was expected from a pred, she didn&#39;t find a clue to \n&gt; Nightlight&#39;s where abouts. She wasn&#39;t going ot give up yet. She \n&gt; looked at Flicker. &quot;So how many of us are there. I over heard some \n&gt; bots talking earlier about getting the slag kicked out of them from \n&gt; the maximals in a previous battle. I hope this will not be the case \n&gt; in the future? I do not wish to be imprisioned again by those weak \n&gt; sparked, waste of metal fools.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
