Not to mention it \nwas charred badly.  Kicking Bumblebee, the other Predacon flyer slowly \nshaking his head.\n\nBumblebee let out a groan, slowly opening his optic sensors.  Looking around, \nhe saw some feet, and looked up, seeing Injector.\n\n&quot;Ugh...how&#39;d we get down here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Someone shot us, you idiot.&quot;\n\n&quot;O...oh.  Wh...what now?&quot;\n\n&quot;We...get out of here, obviously.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good enough, for me,&quot; the other flying Predacon said, pushing himself to his \nfeet, &quot;I hate it here.&quot; he finished, lifting off into the air, followed by \nInjector.\n\n\n---\n\nManterror gathered himself up, looking around.  He could make out Bumblebee \nand Injector flying int he air, heading for Hell Beast&#39;s ship (or at least, \nit used to be his), that one Oblitercon (Scavenger) entering the Alliance \nbase, and Prowl and Iron Raptor nearly faded out of his sight.  \n\n&quot;Well, if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join them.&quot; he shrugged, the green robot \ntransforming to beast mode (a abnormally large praying mantis) and headed off \nfor the Predacon base, and the CR chambers it held in its depths.\n\n---\n\nScavenger put ont he brakes, transforming to robot mode, flipping through the \nair perfectly, landing on his feet.  He entered the craft, heading for the CR \nchambers.\n\n"}}
