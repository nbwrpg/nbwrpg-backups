Jan\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a man named George Thomas=\r\n, pastor in\na small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning\nhe came to =\r\nthe Church carrying a rusty, bent, old\nbird cage, and set it by the pulpit.=\r\n  Eyebrows were raised and, as if in response, PastorThomas began to speak.=\r\n..\n&quot;I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a\nyoung boy coming towa=\r\nrd me swinging this bird cage.\nOn the bottom of the cage were three little =\r\nwild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the\nlad and asked, &quot;W=\r\nhat you got there, son?&quot;\nJust some old birds,&quot; came the reply.\nWhat are you=\r\n gonna do with them?&quot; I asked.\nTake &#39;em home and have fun with &#39;em,&quot; he ans=\r\nwered.\nI&#39;m gonna tease &#39;em and pull out their feathers to\nmake &#39;em fight. I=\r\n&#39;m gonna have a real good time.&quot;\n&quot;But you&#39;ll get tired of those birds soone=\r\nr or\nlater. What will you do?&quot;\n&quot;Oh, I got some cats,&quot; said the little boy. =\r\n&quot;They\nlike birds. I&#39;ll take &#39;em to them.&quot;\nThe pastor was silent for a momen=\r\nt.\nHow much do you want for those birds, son?&quot;\nHuh?? !!! Why, you don&#39;t wan=\r\nt them birds, mister.\nThey&#39;re just plain old field birds. They don&#39;t sing.\n=\r\nThey ain&#39;t even pretty!&quot;\n&quot;How much?&quot; the pastor asked again.\nThe boy sized =\r\nup the pastor as if he were crazy and\nsaid, &quot;$10?&quot;\nThe pastor reached in hi=\r\ns pocket and took out a ten\ndollar bill. He placed it in the boy&#39;s hand. In=\r\n a flash, the boy was gone. The pastor picked up the cage and gently carrie=\r\nd it to the end of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Sett=\r\ning the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars persu=\r\naded the birds out, setting them free. Well, that explained the empty bird =\r\ncage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell\nthis story.  One day =\r\nSatan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Ga=\r\nrden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.  &quot;Yes, sir, I just caught t=\r\nhe world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they co=\r\nuldn&#39;t resist. Got &#39;em all!&quot;\n&quot;What are you going to do with them?&quot; Jesus as=\r\nked.\nSatan replied, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m gonna have fun! I&#39;m gonna\nteach them how to ma=\r\nrry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink =\r\nand smoke and curse. I&#39;m gonna teach them how to invent guns and\nbombs and =\r\nkill each other. I&#39;m really gonna have fun!&quot;\n&quot;And what will you do when you=\r\n get done with them?&quot;\nJesus asked.\n&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kill &#39;em,&quot; Satan glared proudl=\r\ny.\n&quot;How much do you want for them?&quot; Jesus asked.\n&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want those =\r\npeople.

He asked again.\nSatan looked at Jesus and sneered, &quot;All your =\r\nblood,\ntears and your life.&quot;\nJesus said, &quot;DONE!&quot; Then He paid the price.\nTh=\r\ne pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and\nhe walked from the pulpi=\r\nt.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_001B_01C2C481.91583EA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2800.1126&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;Yes, this has been aroun=\r\nd several times, but I \nthought it was good enough to read and pass on agai=\r\nn.&nbsp; Jan&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;There once was a man na=\r\nmed George Thomas, pastor \nin&lt;BR&gt;a small New England town.
