He really wanted\nto\n&gt; make idle conversation to interrupt the silence.\n&gt;     Soon they reached the quarter section of the base. He walked up to a\ndoor\n&gt; and pressed a button. The door opened. Inside was the basics, a bed, a\ndesk,\n&gt; with a computer, a weapons rack, and a few shelves. He went across the\nhall\n&gt; and opened the another door. Inside was the same layout. Both had windows,\n&gt; but were covered with rock.\n&gt;     &quot;You may pick either room, they are exactly the same.&quot; Bazooka said to\n&gt; them both. &quot;Magmatron has granted you access to most of the ship, you may\n&gt; explore at your will. He has also requested that you report to the lab in\n20\n&gt; cycles. Which gives you plenty of time to get aquatinted with you new\nhome.&quot;\n&gt;     Bazooka left them to their exploring.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
