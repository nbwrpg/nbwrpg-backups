She \n&gt; turns away from the computer.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah good. Glad you could make it. Quickstrike, we need your \ncomputer \n&gt; skills to get the main power generator up and running. Meantime \nDarkMouse and \n&gt; I will take a look around the bunker a little more. Tarantulas,&quot;\nShe \npaused \n&gt; an looked at him in puzzlement for a moment, &quot;You can start reading \nthe \n&gt; commander, or whatever was in charge here, journal entry&#39;s. Got it?&quot;\n&gt;     Tarantulas transformed and nodded. He walked over to one of the \nterminals \n&gt; and began to read. Aracnia took Dark Mouses shoulder and began to \nlead her \n&gt; back out the door into the dark hallway to investigate.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron was indeed tired. Waspinators infernal humming was the \nonly \n&gt; thing keeping him awake. He was mostly watching radar and filling \nout the \n&gt; daily report.\n&gt;     &quot;Megatron made cat bot commander! Why not Waspinator?&quot; He said \nsuddenly, \n&gt; with out any hesitation.\n&gt;     Megatron turned a heavey optic to him. &quot;Your stupid, and an \nidiot. Kitkat \n&gt; is smart a reliable.
