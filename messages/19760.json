She sniffed \naround and found the source of the death smell. There were old \nremains of animals and bots in a pile in a corner of the cave. She \nput her paw up to her nose as the smell was over whelming. She walked \nbackward and bumped into something. She slowly turned around and saw \nas metal skeleton of a bot standing up against the wall.  It started \nto fall towards her as she bumped it.  She screamed at the top of her \nlittle lungs and ran out of the cave.  She stood outside the cave, \nher face pale and her little lungs going into hyperdrive.  \n\n\n"}}
