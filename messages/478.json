She looked down and noticed that Carnage was no \nlonger with them, where could she have gone to?!\nTeltoli swooped low and flew just above the ground, unless her friend had a \ncloaking device then she hadn&#39;t followed them this far. She sighed and began \nto fly back when suddenly she saw her friend emerge from the forest and \nbegin to make her way towards the clone.\nTeltoli landed beside Carnage and looked at the sludge covered reptile.\nCarnage shook her hind foot and wrinkled her snout as she heard sludge \nsplatter against a near by rock, she sighed and looked at Teltoli.*\n\nCarnage: &quot;Yuk!! Just my day, isn&#39;t it!!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli smiled and shook her head.*\n\nTeltoli: &quot;So, where were you?&quot;\n\nCarnage: &quot;Well, I kinda...tripped in the swamp back there and here I \nam...the Swamp Thing!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli smiled and walked beside Carnage as she made her way up to the \nhill top to Cyber Claw. As the pair approached Cyber Claw Teltoli had to \nstand aside as Carnage shook the sludge from her body, not a pleasant \nexperience!*\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
