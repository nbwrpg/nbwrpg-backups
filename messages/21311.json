It seemed \n&gt; kinda fair since JP got 5 Inferno clones in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that the lack of specification is getting really \n&gt; annoying. &quot;Firing at the enemy&quot; or &quot;Firing at some Alliance members&quot; \n&gt; isn&#39;t good form. Also, &quot;Firing at all the Alliance members&quot; can imply \n&gt; that your character is spinning in circles and firing through walls, \n&gt; so please be SPECIFIC!\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, KSL has authorized my use of Unitron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::The Oblitercons/Deamon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh Ripper/Six \n&gt; Shot/Ares/Manterror/Injector/BumbleBee/Double \n&gt; Punch/Unitron/Zardus/FZ/Perndabot::\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One rolls in the air, dodging a few shots, several of them \n&gt; hitting him. Dodging some gatling fire, he turns in time to see \n&gt; Destructor grabb KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kill the wolf femm,&quot; he says over his comm-link to his troops, \n&gt; launching two signature seeking missiles at KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I don&#39;t think the part of the battle involving KitKat should be \n&gt; continued untill Logo posts if KitKat was grabbed or not. So next \n&gt; post on this should be hers.)\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The arrow hits near Pyro, the Oblitercon ignoring the pain as he aims \n&gt; his gun at KitKat on Dark One&#39;s orders and opens fire, sending a few \n&gt; fireballs flying at her.\n&gt; \n&gt; A rocket hits near him, charring the side of him a bit.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; In HUMVEE mode, Scavenger drives toward Destructor and KitKat, firing \n&gt; dozens of rapid laser shots at KitKat.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Transforming into his artillery cannon mode, Breakdown aims his \n&gt; weapons at KitKat, firing a few laser shots as well as a missile at \n&gt; the femm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hiss, in Robot mode, runs toward KitKat, firing at her from his gun.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Dark Claw growls as an arrow hits near him, not being affected by the \n&gt; virus due to his advanced form. He aims his sword at Pestilance, the \n&gt; blade detatching and flying as a missile at the bot, a new blade \n&gt; replacing it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Flesh Ripper stumbles back from an explosion in front of him, \n&gt; laughing as he puts his palms together, launching the ball of energy \n&gt; it forms at Disease.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Manterror yells as pain from the virus goes through him, taking him \n&gt; out of the battle for a few seconds.\n&gt; \n&gt; He manages to roll out of the way of a rocket, the explosion sending \n&gt; him flying.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Cloaking after getting up from weapon fire, Double Punch looks up as \n&gt; DarkFate flies in, firing two missiles at the bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Injector jupms away as he sees an arrow hit nearby, the virus not \n&gt; reaching him. He runs after the horsement, firing stinger missiles \n&gt; after them.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; SixShot barrel rolls in the air, dodging weapon fire and launching \n&gt; two missiles at War.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Yelling in pain as the virus surges through him, Ares is thrown to \n&gt; the ground by an explosion.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; BumbleBee flies toward DragonFly, firing a missile at the bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus frowns as the Iron Fist reports the stage the battle is in, \n&gt; tapping his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Deemos, have your group engage the enemy. Kill as many as you can. \n&gt; Unitron, go intercept any fleeing bots.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He frowns as he sees Perndabot on the scanners again. &quot;Perndabot, go \n&gt; to the coordinates I&#39;m sending you, back up the Alliance members.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sending a mental command to FZ to go and also back up the Alliance, \n&gt; Zardus watches Unitron fly off and head toward the battle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Recieving Zardus&#39; transmission, Panzertron looks over at BrightBlade.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a battle I&#39;m needed on, lets go, you can join in too!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He takes off at a run toward the battle, then activating his jetpack \n&gt; and flying toward it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; FZ looks up as he recieves Zardus&#39; orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I must go, Zardus calls,&quot; he says to Squizzy, running out of the \n&gt; room and out of the IF, launching off toward the battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
