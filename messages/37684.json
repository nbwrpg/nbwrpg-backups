He had planned\non scrapping this false Decepticon, then maybe Speedbreaker for bringing\nhim here, but h heard Shockwave&#39;s voice. He strugled to stand, then felt\noil pump through his wires, from the fight, and felt strong. He looked\nat Shockwave with a ripped up face, only one of his eyes whirled to life\nto take in his former Guardian of Cybertron. His mouth barely moved as\nhe spoke. &quot;Megatron claims nothing. HE IS.&quot; Megatron yelled. &quot;You have\nbeen busy Shockwave.&quot; Megatron said motioning to Unitron. &quot;But this\nfight proved nothing, except I can, and will scrap you as well. It\nproves not wether I am Megatron or not. But the power I display proves I\nam worthy of Leadership.&quot; Megatron said, stepping foreward. He through\nhis cannon to the ground, it landing with a thud. &quot;Decepticons, do not\nfire on Shockwave, I trust him, with all my Spark.&quot; Megatron said,\nnodding. He walked forward. &quot;Do you not remember Shockwave. When we\njoined together, all those millions of years ago. Conquest was one and\nall. We as Cybertronians are superior, and we deserve it. You and I had\na kinship, I felt with no other Decepticon. Not Soundwave, not\nStarscream, no one. That is why I left you in charge of Cybertron.&quot;\nMegatron then smiled. &quot;If you wish to destroy me now, then try, but you\nwill only be crushing our dream.&quot; he finished, looking over the purple\nCyclops.\n\n"}}
