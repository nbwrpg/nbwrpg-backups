He never got to settle down. He was \ncareful when he stood. He didn&#39;t feel quite himself. Within a few \nsteps to test his legs, he closed his optics. He felt dizzy. He \ngrabbed his head and took a few more steps ahead. He opened his eyes \nto take a quick look around. \n\nHe walked to off to find a place to lay down before he fell. He found \na spot by a rock by the wall. He layed down, trying to get out of the \nway of the others, getting a quiet spot. He was drained of energy \nfrom his body working over time to save him from death. He closed his \neyes. By the time he woke up, he hoped he would be in better \nconditions.\n\n\n"}}
