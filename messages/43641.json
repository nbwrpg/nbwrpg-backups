It seems \nbizaar. He grabbs some energon cubes as peace offerings and goes to \nsee what it is.  He finds Transmutate crying.\n\nRhesus: What&#39;s wrong.\n\nTransmutate: No friend.\n\nRhesus hands him the energon cubes and he eats them.\n\nTransmutate: Friend.\n\nRhesus: Yes I&#39;m a friend.\n\nRhesus guesses that Transmutates spark never fully went on line so he \nbegins slowly probing his knowledge a little at a time to bring him \nout of it.\n\nRhesus: Do you have any other friends?\n\nMutate: Did.\n\nRhesus: Who?\n\nMutate: Sil-ver-bolt...Ram-page.\n\nRhesus: What happened to them?\n\nMutate: Don&#39;t know.\n\nRhesus: What factions were they in?\n\nMutate: Silver-bolt Maxi-mal...Rav-age Predi-con.\n\nRhesus: (jackpot) Did you have any more.\n\nMutate: They think I stupid.\n\nRhesus: Who said something like that?\n\nMutate: Rhi-nox, but he use different words.\n\nRhesus: (perfect now he&#39;s revising the words of others) Well I&#39;m sure \nhe was wrong. What faction are you in.\n\nMutate: Well, I was a Maximal Protoform, but I don&#39;t approve of \nfighting. In fact I jumped in the...hey....I&#39;m not dumb anymore.\n\nRhesus: Nope. Just some gradually drilling into your spark. You need \nnew legs. Let&#39;s go.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; Rhesus gets the first canon online, but still has to mount it.

He picks up a small holograpic projector and \n&gt; looks \n&gt; &gt; sadly at it.  He sits down and begins to meditate.  He turns on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; projector. A picture of a girl bot comes up. The projector starts \n&gt; &gt; playing a recording of a woman singing the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; theme:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                 I don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt;                 what words I can say.\n&gt; &gt;                 The wind has a way\n&gt; &gt;                 to talk to me.\n&gt; &gt;                 Flowers sleep\n&gt; &gt;                 a silent lullaby.\n&gt; &gt;                 I pray for reply.\n&gt; &gt;                 I&#39;m reeeeaaaaady.\n&gt; &gt;                 (I forget how the next verse goes and that&#39;s \n&gt; actually \n&gt; &gt; a traslated version they sing twice in the series not the one they \n&gt; &gt; sing at the end of each episode in Japanese).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  During this Rhesus has flashbacks (hey I needed to introduce some \n&gt; &gt; conflict).  A small out post with the girl, Mustex, Stallex is \nborn, \n&gt; &gt; they constantly try with there few resorces to figure out why \n&gt; Stallex \n&gt; &gt; has to constantly upgrade like organics to adulthood over the last \n&gt; 10 \n&gt; &gt; months (I just dicided to say he ages 12 times faster than human \n&gt; kids \n&gt; &gt; although it will stop after 20 months and return to normal), then \nan \n&gt; &gt; attack, fighters are everywhere, they four of them are running to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; shuttle, 20 ft. away she&#39;s grabbed from behind, she&#39;s held around \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; neck by a large shadowy bot he can&#39;t quite make out, she screams \nat \n&gt; &gt; him to go, he screams he won&#39;t but pushed the button to close the \n&gt; door \n&gt; &gt; anyway like a coward, and the shuttle takes off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He stands up crying. He stops still looking sad.  He gets his \ntools \n&gt; &gt; and gets back to work on the cannons.\n\n\n"}}
