The Predacons were tricky bots to try and tackle but then again, the \nMaximals weren&#39;t so easily defeated. They stood proud and true no matter the \ncost, or so it seemed to her at the time.\nIron Raptor put her sword away and looked around at the sceen, there weren&#39;t \nthat many Preds out in the open but that also meant that they were mostly in \nthe base! Not a good thing!\nShe sighed again as she looked over the shield that now covered the base, \nobviously Iris was sustaining it but her power supply could only last so \nlong...then what?\nIron Raptor growled as she made her way back towards the Ark, her splatter \ngun in hand. It was then that she spotted a new bot, and then another!\nShe snarled, another raptor and a fuzor...but at least they were on their \nside.\nIron Raptor saw that the fuzor was closest and opened her com-link to it...*\n\n&quot; Attention, bot 663(Teltoli). Please specify your name and function.&quot;\n\n* She looked up at the fuzor and snarled again, she knew that it was going \nout on a limb but she had to find out who and what it was.\nAllies are very important to a group that was outnumbered.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
