He had always been the strategic type, and as\n&gt;&gt; if planning his next move in a game of chess, he narrows his brow and not\n&gt;&gt; one word comes out of his mouth, except...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Not on my watch.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which was also what he had said in his sub conscious.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Night Shift, Rat Trap and Straight Shot watch, they look to Kup and\n&gt;&gt; nodd, yet, what comes out of Tucson&#39;s mouth causes them to turn on a \n&gt;&gt; heel.\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot sees the determination in his face.  A determination he had\n&gt;&gt; when he first faced Hydras before he became a Prime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Ohhh I think whoever has Rodimus Prime under their control is gonna \n&gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; their tendrils full with Tucson.  That&#39;s it Tucson, you can do it, you \n&gt;&gt; got\n&gt;&gt; your name for a reason.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rat Trap watches carefully.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; If anyone get get Rodimus outa that jam it&#39;s Wheels.  He didn&#39;t let\n&gt;&gt; Hydras stop &#39;em and now he ain&#39;t gonna let any oversized bug stop &#39;em\n&gt;&gt; either.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift follows Straight Shot and Talon.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Talon, you can bet your spark that Tucson Prime&#39;s gonna come outa this\n&gt;&gt; with Rodimus just fine.  Tucson got his name for a reason, like Straight\n&gt;&gt; Shot said, every mech gets his or her name depending on his spark, and\n&gt;&gt; lemme tell ya Tucson&#39;s got one heck of a spark, and a back bone. Okay,\n&gt;&gt; let&#39;s get ta the CR chamber&#39;n get Nightlight&#39;n Windlord back online where\n&gt;&gt; they belong.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Straight Shot follows Night Shift, Rat Trap stays with the others,\n&gt;&gt; including Quickstride, Silverbolt, Noctoro, Ramhorn, and Bump, carefully\n&gt;&gt; watching his newly found friend&#39;s every move.  There was a power there, a\n&gt;&gt; power that even Tucson himself couldn&#39;t explain.  Again, another\n&gt;&gt; indication of strength, as Tucson begins to grip his fist tightly with a\n&gt;&gt; narrowing brow.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Kup/nightlight/Windlord:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Kup reicved the signal of the cr and said &quot;Nightlight and Windlord has\n&gt;&gt;&gt; been\n&gt;&gt;&gt; repaired...

Kup walked towards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; CRs and watched them looking with sadness his friends\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *     *     *     *     *\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, next door to the medbay in the recharge chambers there were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; twin beeps as both Windlord and the female once known as Nightlight\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; are fully charged and repaired. With a click and a hiss the doors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; began to slide open.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
