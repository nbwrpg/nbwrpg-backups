She sat up in the \n&gt; chair and rubbed the moisture from her face. She had been haviing \n&gt; nightmares about her death and reanimation experience. She stod up \n&gt; and looked around.  She sighed and sat back down in the chair. &quot;Yeah, \n&gt; I&#39;ll get you Megatron. You sent me to my death and I was fortunate to \n&gt; come back. Now it&#39;s my turn to send you to the Matrix.&quot; muttered to \n&gt; herself.  She paced the room a few mintues and tried to calm down. \n&gt; She finally relaxed enough to try to sleep some more. She sat back in \n&gt; the chair and closed her optics.  She snoozed for a while, but had \n&gt; fitful dreams.  She changed into mouse mode in her sleep and curled \n&gt; up in the chair. Her tail tucked in under her leg, her whiskers \n&gt; twitching.\n\n\n"}}
