I forgot to mention yesterday that JP gets \ncontroll of \n&gt; Autofire, and KSL also gets controll of DevilDuer till I get back. \nC ya all \n&gt; in 10 days, or if I get on a comp before that.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Prowl/DevilDuer/Ramulus/DeathScythe/Mosquitor/Shredder::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus leans back from the femm he had been reprogramming, his arm \nstarting \n&gt; to shimmer. It was happening again, he could feel it. He frowns, \nturning back \n&gt; and typing a few commands on a console. A stasis field emerges over \nthe femm, \n&gt; keeping her in stasis untill a command from him would disable it. \nHe \n&gt; activates his comm-link on a secure channel to all Alliance members \nother \n&gt; than Feline and Skulletron, who were in the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;I&#39;ll be gone for a few days. Nemesis \nEnforcer \n&gt; is in charge untill I return. Feline and Skulletron will return \nsoon wearing \n&gt; Maximal symbols, don&#39;t open fire. They&#39;ll have interesting \ninformation.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a flash, Zardus dissapears, to return in a few days.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl blinks, looking down at himself as he turns partly \ntransparent. Prowl \n&gt; looks back at Iron Raptor. He was reluctant to leave her, but he \nhad no real \n&gt; choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few days, love,&quot; he says to her, quickly kissing \nher \n&gt; before he dissapears.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; In front of the pod, DevilDuer looks at the new bot. &quot;Hello, I&#39;m \nDevilDuer,&quot; \n&gt; he says to the bot, &quot;Who are you?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus frowns as his feet pass through a bush, noticing that he \nwas \n&gt; shimmering. He sighs. Here it comes again. With a flash, he \ndissapears, as \n&gt; does DeathScythe above.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Without warning, Mosquitor&#39;s stupidity causes him to be phazed out \nfrom the \n&gt; dimention for a few days to fix some bugs with his brain and make \nhim at \n&gt; least be able to solve 2 + 2.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Walking alongside Mantella, Shredder suddenly falls to his knees, \nstarting to \n&gt; shimmer. He groans as he dissapears with a flash. He hated these \nsmall \n&gt; phazings, but they were unavoidable.\n\n\n"}}
