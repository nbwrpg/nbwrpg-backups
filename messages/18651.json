Fangs that inject venom. Venom will send \n&gt; most average BW bot into stasis, but not kill. \n&gt; Alliegance: Predacon \n&gt; \n&gt; She was made on Cybertron, by the Predacon Council. She was designed \n&gt; to be a spy and assassin. Her moto, SEEK,SEDUCE,DESTROY. She had \n&gt; killed many Maximal officails on Cybertron and was working her way \n&gt; around to the top leaders. She was the best in her field. The \n&gt; Predacon Council had made other bots for the same purpose as she, but \n&gt; she had out done them all. But because of her skill, a few of the \n&gt; Predacon leaders felt she might become a threat to them. She knew \n&gt; too much and they now wanted rid of her. She had just killed one of \n&gt; the Maximal Council leaders and was then turned in by one of the \n&gt; Predacon Council members. She had to flee Cybertron or be exacuted. \n&gt; But her programs of killing and information gathering were still \n&gt; strong and for the Predacon cause despire the fact they betrayed her. \n&gt; She stole a small transport ship and sped off from Cybertron. She \n&gt; didn&#39;t know if she would ever return, but for now, the further away \n&gt; she got, the safer she felt. \n&gt; \n&gt; She was deep into space, when a black hole opened up infront of her \n&gt; ship. Seconds later, her ship was sucked into the vortex of space. \n&gt; She tried to fight, but the ship couldn&#39;t break free. She blacked \n&gt; out from the g-forces of the black hole as the ship was sucked in. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her ship finally flew throught the hole in space and ended up near \n&gt; the solor system on Earth. Her ship had lost power and engine drive \n&gt; while in the black hole. The only systems that remained active were \n&gt; life support. She was in stasis lock at the helm of the ship. AS \n&gt; the ship drifted past the planets, it was hit by space debre and \n&gt; rubble. Small meteors collided and smashed parts of the exterior \n&gt; drive system and parts of the navigational systems. The ship \n&gt; evertually drifted near earth, where the gravitational pull had \n&gt; started to pull the ship into the earth&#39;s atmosphere. The ship fell \n&gt; from the sky and landed 100 yards from the Allience base. The \n&gt; transport ship was about the size of the NASA Space shuttle. \n&gt; \n&gt; Diamond was still out cold, her body slumped over the control \n&gt; console. Her body bruised but for the most part, undamaged. The \n&gt; ship had sustained a lot of damage and would never fly again. Smoke \n&gt; poured out of the tail and engine rooms. The wings were torn off \n&gt; upon impact. One wing flew off and hit against the Allience ship. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
