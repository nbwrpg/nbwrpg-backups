OK WHO said \n&gt; everyone could go in the ark and blow it up. you all\n&gt; are stupid did you all \n&gt; not understand if the ark goes very few bots would\n&gt; still exist. there is no \n&gt; way any of your guys would have been able to get\n&gt; into the ark except for \n&gt; zergling and Punch. they would have killed each\n&gt; other with the bombs. when \n&gt; Arcangel,Silverbolt, and Brooder arrived they got in\n&gt; the way of the door so \n&gt; how the fuck did all these people get into the ark.\n&gt; I say take one of those \n&gt; bombs stick it up zerglings ass. That was the bigest\n&gt; mode I ever heard worse \n&gt; then what I do. and if any of you all understand\n&gt; what it means firing \n&gt; rockets down the haul. It maens that when i fire\n&gt; rockets they are heading \n&gt; down the walls of the ship. If you don&#39;t understand\n&gt; that GO TO SCHOOL YOU \n&gt; RETARD. Also logomorgh why do all of your char keep\n&gt; dying? I will leave it \n&gt; at that.]\n&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
