It didn&#39;t know why or \nhow it had the same scent but it knew the twin wasn&#39;t appearing \nthreatening. It&#39;s twin was a bit larger than her but it wasn&#39;t \nfealing threatened. It nuzzled against Ice smelling the bandages on \nher back. It stepped back slightly, then moved back again. The female \nbear sensed an oddity about it&#39;s twin, something that didn&#39;t belong. \nIt was getting fearful and a bit nervous.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She saw the polar bear approah her. She wasn&#39;t sure what to do. She \n&gt; looked and saw that the bear wasn&#39;t attacking. She sniffed the \nscent \n&gt; of the bear as it got closer.  It smelled familiar. She couldn&#39;t \npin \n&gt; point it, but she had smelled that bear scent before. She looked at \n&gt; the polar bear. Then it hit her. THIS BEAR WAS HER DNA DONOR!. She \n&gt; smiled. The bear might take her for a sibling if she smelled like \n&gt; this polar bear that was appraching her. She took a few steps \ntowards \n&gt; it and lowered head as a sign of submissiveness. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK Logo lets throw in a little suspense into this game.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A scent filled the air for a Polar bear. She knew something was \n&gt; nearby. She\n&gt; &gt; went over the hill and saw another bear. The scent was familiar, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; different. AS if it were a family member. It started downhill \n&gt; through the\n&gt; &gt; snow toward it&#39;s mirror image. It could sense that it&#39;s twin was \nin \n&gt; pain and\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s curiosity filled it&#39;s instincts.\n\n\n"}}
