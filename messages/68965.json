I will try to hold out for alittle longer.\n\nIt looks like I&#39;=\r\nm running: Cyclonus, Scourge, the sweeps, Decibel, Myrmidon, Tumult, Nightr=\r\nazor, and now Rodimus (as NPC). That leaves Lord Elder, Kup, Scorponok, G2-=\r\nJhiaxus and Grimlock open for temporary ownership. Jd, if you want Kup Till=\r\n Robo gets back that&#39;s cool. \n\nIs anyone up to hold the others till his ret=\r\nurn?\n\nPreston \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jdmyemail&quot; &lt;jdmyemail@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Looks like Robo&#39;s gonna be MIA for a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it just me=\r\n or are we three the only active players here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Either way, I&#39;d like to=\r\n continue interacting with you two.
