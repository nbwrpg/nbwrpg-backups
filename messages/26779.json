Before the Maximal got to \nKillfest, the missiles hit, sending Koj flipping over Killfest&#39;s head \nand flying toward EndBringer, who had his tentacles ready.\n\nEndBringer lashes out with a tentacle, but Koj reacts quickly by \ncutting it off with his sword, an electric shock traveling up the \nsword and into Koj, distracting him. A missile from Killfest smashes \ninto his back, sending him flying over EndBringer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nLiono flies back, the sword leaving a gash on his chest. He draws his \nown sword, holding it in front of him. &quot;We&#39;ll see who&#39;s better, \nDecepticon,&quot; he says, slashing at Motormaster.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Motormaster takes the brunt of the shots being fired at him as they\n&gt; ricochet of his armored hull, and maneuvers himself towards Liono, \ndrawing\n&gt; his sword. He turns to Killfest, and over his comlink speaks &quot;we \nneed to\n&gt; get in there to check what is going on, we will let Astroblast \ncheck it\n&gt; out, we&#39;ll keep them busy. He then turns to Liono, &quot;Now Maximal, \nfeel the\n&gt; anger of a Decepticon, and he swings towards his enemy. As he move \nhe\n&gt; silently on a different frequency from everyone, so no one else  \ncould\n&gt; normally hear it (unless they intercept) &quot;Astroblast, I will keep \nthem\n&gt; busy, get on the ark and find our target. If it&#39;s not there look \nthrough\n&gt; Teletran&#39;s datatracks to find it.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
