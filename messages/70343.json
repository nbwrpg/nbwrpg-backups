Nearly 250 feet across and high it was a\nnear perfect semi circular room all the way around. All around the\nroom, starting from 30 feet off the floor the walls were lined with\ncave entrances, each of them perhaps five feet wide, hundreds of them\nall around the room and stretching high towards the domed ceiling. At\nfloor level of the chamber there are several larger cave openings\nwhich lead off in different directions much like the one that the\ngroup was entering from.\n\nIn the center of the room a large column, stretching from floor to\nceiling and nearly 30 feet thick at the base. About 100 feet up there\nappears to be some sort of small metal chamber that has been\nhaphazardly affixed to the column with some sort of adhesive. the\nchamber is about 10 feet tall and perhaps 4 feet wide or so. Upon\ncloser inspection one could see that it is a recharging chamber, and\nit is from inside this that Rodimus&#39; signal can be detected.\n\nHowever high up, near the top of that column near the ceiling is a\nmuch larger version of the insectile creatures that you have seen. It\nlooks about identical to the others with four forelegs, each ending in\nsharply barbed blades, eight legs that went along the side of the\nbody, and a scorpion like tail, although the abdomen is larger, and\noverall it appeared to be 30 tall.\n\n&quot;Maximals, Autobots and Predacon&quot; the creature said as it&#39;s wings\nbuzzed, the voice definitely sounded female. &quot;Your companion has had\nmuch to teach and is about to become a most delicious snack. But it is\ngood that you have come, you can become the main course!&quot;\n\nThe creature spread her wings, dropped from her high perch and took\noff to the air as she chuckled evilly.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
