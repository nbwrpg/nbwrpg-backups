She turned a \ncorner in the hall and walked towards the door that entered into the weapons \nroom, she had fought alongside that fembot almost from the beginning and she \nthought that she did just fine.\nIron Raptor entered into the room and looked over the racks and piles of \nweapons, she lifted a semi-automatic flame thrower and looked it over. It \nwas a good weapon but not the one in which she was looking for, she set it \ndown and lifted up a duel-shock missal launcher. She hefted it and felt it&#39;s \nweight, it fit her perfectly.\nIron Raptor smiled and put the launcher away in one of her back \ncompartments, now it was time to get to the island&#39;s borders.\nShe snarled, this battle may be a tough battle and they would need all of \nthe bot&#39;s they could get. This was no time to let Plintissa run off!\nIron Raptor opened her comlink to Plintissa&#39;s frequencies she exited the \nroom and headed for the bridge...*\n\n&quot; Iron Raptor to Plintissa, come in. It&#39;s about time that you returned to \nbase, there&#39;s been the orders to head to the island&#39;s borders and prepare to \nbe attacked. I want you there as well. Iron Raptor out.&quot;\n\n* She hoped that Plintissa would change her mind and fight this battle with \nthem, but she didn&#39;t have to much time to waste on that matter when a battle \nthreatened. After all, it was up to Plintissa, not her.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
