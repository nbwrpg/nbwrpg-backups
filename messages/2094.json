He earned it. Reprogram a computer, survive \npoisioning, and live through being chased. Ha, Hell Beast&#39;s group, try that.\n\nSaluting would just feel stupid, so he left the room without saying a word.\n\nBut then, he froze. He had no quarters to sleep in. Ever since he came back \non-line, he was busy being on the run, bugging Hell Beast&#39;s soldiers, and \nsleeping out in the wild.\n\n&quot;Uh, boss,&quot; he said, turning back to Megatron. &quot;Ah ain&#39;t got no quarters. \nGot one free?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
