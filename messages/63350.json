She wanted him. She knew that. But it would possitively\nkill her to make him choose. To do that would be the most dishonorable\nthing she could do. To make him choose between her and another bot he\ncared for so much, she would be no better than the Predicons she had\nfought so many times over. No, she would not make him choose.  She let\nthe mech fluid tears run down her wolf face plates as she ran towards\nthe coordinantes that she was given for this pod they were after. \nEven though she could feel her spark break, she knew what she had to\ndo.  She would let him once they made it back to base.  She let her\nface dry a bit as she made herself a small vow, that she would make\nthis last time with him rememberable for them both.\n\nShe stopped running and changed back into bot mode. He was not in\nsight.  She looked around and found a rock a little bigger than her\nhead on the ground.  She lay down, with her head on the rock, closed\nher optics and waited for him to catch up with her.  It was tough not\nletting herself smile at her plan for a little bit of fun first, but\nshe kept a straight face as if she was asleep.  Or in this case, she\nhoped he would think she was knocked out cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice: \n&gt;  \n&gt; He groaned as she took off again.  He was being punished.  For what\nexactly he didn&#39;t know, but figured he deserved it.  He ran after her,\nshe left his sight but not his sensors, and he followed them to get to\nher.  He knew he had to choose between her and Blacknightmare, but\ncould not come to a decision that would leave them all okay.  He\nfigure it out, just not now as he chased his first love to their\ndestination.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
