A third faction operating in the area, with seemingly significant\n&gt; resources and a base was an unkonwn one.  So that meant that the unkonwn\n&gt; quality had to be assessed and dealt with so that the skmirishes could get\n&gt; back to focusing on the true adversaries, the MAXIMALS.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThat sentiment was one that CRYOTEK agreed with. However there was\nanother faction that could not be forgotten - UNICRON. His minions had\nbeen left here either on the EARTH or on its moon. Whether MAGMATRON\nand his cohorts were part of this UNICRON faction or working for\nthemselves was still unknown.\n\n&gt; DINOBOT glanced over to CRYOTEK then as he heard the sounds coming from down\n&gt; the tunnel.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Leo.  He narrows a brow in concentration as they move deeper\n&gt; into the tunnel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maybe not a clone, but perhaps an illusion brought on by Magmatron or his\n&gt; minions.  The rumor itself....  That could be an illusion to turn us against\n&gt; ourselves so that way our efforts would diminish to the point of surrender.\n&gt; DAMMIT WHY DIDN&#39;T I CATCH THAT SOONER!  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stops short, digging his claws into the ground as he swings his body\n&gt; around and stares angrily at the darkness of the tunnels.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; MAGMATRON!  IF ITS A FIGHT YOU WANT TAKE IT UP WITH ME AND LEAVE MY\n&gt; COMRADES OUT OF IT!  I DARE YOU!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON&#39;s voice echoed down the tunnels that is when the PREDACONS\ncame bowling over the MAXIMALS in an effort to escape!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The PREDACONS seemed to have the lead in things now, having taken the first\n&gt; moments to race ahead into the tunenls as sounds of crumbling rock filled\n&gt; after them, trying to shove their way up to the front of the ongoing\n&gt; collapse!\n&gt;\n&gt; What followed was almost like a clip of the Junkeon inspired Benny Hill show\n&gt; as they all fell over one another to get ahead!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIf the PREDACONS were seeking to get ahead, the MAXIMALS were doing\nmuch the same thing as behind them the walls rumbled and the entire\ntunnel shook as everyone continued running down through a long and\ntwisted path.\n\nFinally with a large crash that shook the tunnel the ceiling fell\nalong with tons of rocks and earth, totally sealing the passage behind\nthe MAXIMALS and PREDACONS.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he stood up in the darkness,\n&quot;It is like we are being herded.\n\nWING CALIBER nodded, &quot;The question is to where, and for what purpose?&quot;\n\nAs the dust cleared it was obvious that the path was sealed behind\nthem for almost the entire length of it. If they were going to get out\nthe only way was to dig through tons of earth and rock or continue\ndown the path.\n\nTORCA, the MAXIMAL FUZOR commander looked around, temporally locking\ngazes with SKYSHADOW his PREDACON counterpart as various MAXIMALS and\nPREDACONS began to shine lights to illuminate the tunnel.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; TORCA said, &quot;But for the moment it would seem that we\ncan only go further in.&quot;\n\nInterestingly, further down the tunnel there was some sort of\nflickering light. It was very dim, but it was like fire light or\nenergy of some sort.\n\nFrom the dimness of this light it was obviously still some distance away.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
