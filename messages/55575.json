She \npluged into it and ran a systems check on herself. She found no \nunknown programs. She sighed as the scan showed she was normal. She \nwas about to shut if off when the screen showed a few new programs in \nher systems.  She analyzed two of the the three new programs. One she \ncould not figure out because it was sealed and would not allow her \naccess. The others were small personality programs. But to her, it \nwas enraging. She saw that one was boosting her fighting instincts.\n\nThinks, No Wonder I&#39;m always itching for a fight. This is boosting \nit. If I can just knock it down...\n\nShe managed to get most of the program knocked down.\nNext she saw the 3rd program was just an energy booster to give her \nextra strength in battle, or when she was angry, which helped explain \nwhy she was extra jittery when she was mad. And that also helped to \nexplain why she seemed mad all the time.  She shut that program down \ntoo.  With a sigh, she unhooked herself and walked back to the \nentrance. She was puzzled as to the the one program she couldn&#39;t even \nsee. It was blocked to her, yet it was running. Something in the back \nof her mind bothered her, but she couldn&#39;t seem to find the answers. \nWell, with the two she did shut off, off, now she could think with a \nclearer head.  She returned to the entrance, gently placed a hand on \nSHarpClaws&#39;s shoulder. &quot;How&#39;s our friend doing?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
