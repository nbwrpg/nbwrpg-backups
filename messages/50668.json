He tries to remember where he h=\r\nad seen Diesel before. Memories of his past come flying back to him. They r=\r\neturn easily when he needs them enough, he finds, the Radicons hadn&#39;t done =\r\na very good job of erasing these memories. He slowly turns around, recallin=\r\ng Diesel&#39;s place in his tumultuous life.\n\nArrow: Ah, yes, Diesel, the messa=\r\nge. It has been a long time, hasn&#39;t it? Shall we get to business immediatel=\r\ny?\n\nArrow could barely remember Razor. He didn&#39;t hold anything against the =\r\nRadicons for damaging his memory so badly. They did what they had to, Arrow=\r\n had attempted to kill them.\n\nArrow: So, what now? Do we head to Earth?\n~~~=\r\n~~\nDeemos was sitting in a meeting, bored.\n\nLeader: Gentlemen, we must all =\r\nband together and stop this menace! We cannot allow this other club to gain=\r\n the upper hand! We truly have the best flag! The others will pay for their=\r\n disagreeance!\n\nDeemos: What kind of club is this? And is disagreeance a wo=\r\nrd?\n\nLeader: This is not a club, this is a council. It&#39;s the Council of Evi=\r\nl. And yes, Disagreeance is a word.\n\nDeemos: No, you said &quot;We cannot allow =\r\nthis other club to gain the upper hand,&quot; apparently if there is this &quot;other=\r\n&quot; club, this is a club.\n\nLeader: See here--\n\nDeemos: I was the one who held=\r\n a council. We were the Mafia, the most imposing group to ever exist save f=\r\nor the Alliance.\n\nLeader: Sir, I&#39;m certain I don&#39;t know what you are talkin=\r\ng about.\n\nDeemos: If this so called council is so evil, why is it that we a=\r\nre not attacking, and why is it that we are not spilling blood.\n\nLeader: Me=\r\nch fluid.\n\nDeemos: It&#39;s the same thing. I&#39;ve spilled alot of it.\n\nLeader: W=\r\nell, sir, you see, we like to bide our time, and then--\n\nDeemos: Then you b=\r\nurn someone else&#39;s flag. Then they come and burn yours. You don&#39;t know what=\r\n violence is. I am the epitome of violence. The innovator. The only individ=\r\nuals I&#39;ve seen you destroy are your own comrades. Not that it&#39;s a bad thing=\r\n to destroy your comrades, I&#39;ve destroyed plenty of lackeys in my time.\n\nLe=\r\nader: I think you&#39;re only saying this because you&#39;ve joined another council=\r\n!

Send me =\r\nto the great junkyard in the sky?\n\nMember: Junkyard?\n\nLeader: Enough of thi=\r\ns, get him!\n\nDeemos stands up. A member sitting right next to him stands up=\r\n as well, but he&#39;s too slow and too dumb. Deemos puts a pistol to his mid s=\r\nection quickly and fires. Several bolts rip through the robot, creating sev=\r\neral flashes and one hole leading all the way through. The unlucky one fall=\r\ns to the ground. Deemos&#39; trigger finger quickly flicks a switch on the util=\r\nity pistol as he swivels it around towards another member who was raising a=\r\n rifle. Deemos moves forward a single step and barely dodges a shot heading=\r\n his way. He fires the pistol and a barrage of 5 inch long steel nails are =\r\nfired at rapid speed, piercing the head of the attackee and tearing off lar=\r\nge chunks. Deemos quickly spins around, flicking a switch once more and he =\r\nfires. Several shots hit the robot who had fired at him, cutting down the b=\r\not who shocked at Deemos&#39; speed and severing one of his arms and his head. =\r\nThe cut down fellow&#39;s head rolled across the floor as the body dropped.\n\nLe=\r\nader: Idiots!\n\nDeemos quickly fired a few pellets on the ground, which erup=\r\nted into tall flames. He was hidden from sight. A shot emerges from behind =\r\nthe flames, passing Deemos&#39; head by inches.\n\nLeader: Did you hear that? I t=\r\nhink I got him.\n\nA grenade flies out from behind the fire and rolls near th=\r\ne Leader of the council&#39;s feet.\n\n(Cut to)\n\nDeemos runs through the halls of=\r\n the building as a massive explosion erupts behind him, detonating the room=\r\n he previously occupied. It was no problem escaping from these buffoons, he=\r\n thought as he exited the building, laughing at the fact that he destroyed =\r\nabout 20 or so more lives. He decided to check his messages. His commlink s=\r\nystem was designed to capture messages and hold them for a later hearing. H=\r\ne had two of these. He activated the first one.\n\nMessage: Hey, buddy, I got=\r\n some of those (buzz) were trying to get. It was (buzz) so, you wanna (buzz=\r\n) we&#39;ve--\n\nDeemos deletes the message quickly. A wrong number and a bad com=\r\nmlink. He activates the next message. He listens to the code carefully then=\r\n plays it back again. He plays it back a third time.\n\nDeemos: Hmm. Maybe. T=\r\nhis sounds like the old code.\n\nHe activates his jets and flies, planning to=\r\n answer this message addressing him and the the one that he knew well back =\r\non Earth, Arrow.
