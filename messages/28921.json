Rubble will get him.&quot;\n\nHe looks over at Rubble, but the bot was already on his way back to \nthe Element.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl groans as he&#39;s lifted up by Iron Raptor. His optics slowly come \nactivate, very unfocused but functional.\n\n&quot;What happened?&quot; he says weakly, one of his arms sliding around Iron \nRaptor for support. He felt like all his energy was drained out of \nhim, which was pretty much the truth.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor only slightly noticed the sadness in the crew which \nMantle \n&gt; ruled, trying to keep Prowl&#39;s head from slipping to the ground.\n&gt; But she was suddenly rewarded from the strain when Prowl transformed \nback \n&gt; into robot mode, falling onto her knees nearly in surprise and \nslipping her \n&gt; arms around his chest.\n&gt; The first thing she did was stroke a hand over his head to see if \nthe damage \n&gt; Element had caused to his SBM had been passed on to his robot mode. \nSighing \n&gt; in relief that none of the damage was transfurred she looked down at \nhim, \n&gt; shaking him slightly to try and awaken him.\n&gt; She looked up at Cinder as she seemed run forward, kneeling at \nProwl&#39;s side. \n&gt; She saw that she was probably trying to pick him up.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s ok, I got him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked back at Mantle as he came forward more, \ngripping Prowl \n&gt; more tightly as she moved to ger to her feet, trying to take him \nwith her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes, as a matter of fact. You can all halp by keeping close to the \nCF, \n&gt; there&#39;ll be a meeting shortly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp\n\n\n"}}
