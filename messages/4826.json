The Fuzor was\nstill\n&gt; dull as a cyber-brick. He ducked his head and tried to quiet a chuckle.\n&gt;\n&gt; He had to get just a little closer. This was funny. But how did he get\nback\n&gt; on-line? And where did this other scorpion come from? Maybe she was the\none\n&gt; that brought him on-line, perhaps favoring him over the others peices of\n&gt; scrap metal. She must have done a good job of rebuilding him. He looked\n&gt; fairly clean. But he still stunk.\n&gt;\n&gt; A dead branch on the ground got in the way of his paw, he tried to move\nhis\n&gt; paw a step forward, but it hit a twig that snapped.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh slag.&quot; He knew they had heard it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike turned his head. &quot;Ya hear that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/_/_/962034613/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
