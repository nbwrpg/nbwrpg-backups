W=\r\nith the grinding of gears he\ntransformed assuming his robot mode and looked=\r\n around, his weapon\ndrawn and ready for action. He glanced at Tuscon and th=\r\nen the other\nAutobots and Maximals, &quot;Heh, thought you guys could break in h=\r\nere and\ndefeat us? Don&#39;t you know that you can&#39;t win?!?&quot; Rodimus paused and=\r\n\nthen chuickled again, although this time it was a little weaker and\nless s=\r\nure, &quot;yeah, you can&#39;t win, so why even try.&quot;\n\nRodimus shook his head and sm=\r\niled as he helped collect any weapons\nthat are discarded.\n\nScourge, much li=\r\nke Rodimus began helping with any weapons that are\ngiven over, and nudging =\r\nthe prisoners in the right directions. &quot;So\ndisappointing.&quot; Scourge said as =\r\nhe shook his head sadly at the\nAutobots and Maximals, &quot;I looked forward to =\r\nthe battle. maybe next\ntime.&quot;\n\nScorponok just stood grinning, or atleast as=\r\n close to grinning as his\nface plate would allow. He looked at Nightshift, =\r\n&quot;Is this what you\nmeant by get it?&quot; he said, the sarcasm thick in his voice=\r\n. &quot;I think we\ngot it then, yes we did.&quot; he chuckled at his own joke.\n\nAs al=\r\nl this was going on the doors slid open and Cyclonus stood there,\nweapon dr=\r\nawns and optics darting around the room. The cyclonus that\nstood there, whi=\r\nle familiar to most, was very different from the last\ntime Tuscon had seen =\r\nhim before he lost his sight. This Cyclonus was a\nlittle taller and sleeker=\r\n, even in his robot mode his lined and form\nbespoke speed and aerodynamics.=\r\n He seemd larger and more imposing than\nwhen he last stood before him, his =\r\narmor thicker and more resilliant\nthan when he was a simple lacky for Galva=\r\ntron. It is as if he had\ngrown into something more than what he was, even h=\r\nis spark no longer\nregistered as pure Decepticon, there was that aspect tha=\r\nt was always\nUnicronian, however on his chest was emblazed the purple symbo=\r\nl of the\nDecepticon forces.\n\nUpon seeing the turn of events Cyclonus nodded=\r\n satisfactorilly as he\nturned to Hydras, &quot;What ever wave that was from Tusc=\r\non awakened\nJhiaxus from stassis. He has the security section secured.&quot; He =\r\nturned\nhis gaze on Tuscon, &quot;We will have to have it analyzed to see what ev=\r\ner\ndefence to it can be mounted. It seemed to have a more pronounced\naffect=\r\n on your Decepticon and predacon forces.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: The changes I descri=\r\nbed are for Tuscon&#39;s benefit as well as those\nwho have not seen him a long =\r\nwhile. Hydras is already aware of this,\nas are the rest of the preds. These=\r\n are the changes from Unicron\nrebuilding him as well as the changes that he=\r\n had undergone from the\nmatrix enhancement. For any of the Predacons he sho=\r\nuld look the same,\nand there should be no surprises, only the Maximals and =\r\nAutobots who\nhaven&#39;t seen him in a while, especaily tuscon who hasn&#39;t seen =\r\nhim in a\nvery long while should there be the change. - I hope that makes se=\r\nnse.\n\nPreston\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 14, 2010 at 1:37 AM, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/nighlight/Perceptor/Kup/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0Hydras la=\r\nughted, it was a deep evil laughth and looking to around him said &quot;Throw aw=\r\nay Your weapons...
