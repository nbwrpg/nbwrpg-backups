Straight Shot is a basic, so is Rat Trap. Even when Rat Trap\nbecame transmetal and despite the fact that he was listed as a Deluxe,\nin the show he never actually grew. So he would be between 5 and 6\nfeet tall. The show bible says 5&#39;\n\nHowever having said that I am instituting something that the show did\nbut that we forgot.\n\nBW&#39;s characters do not size change.\n\nFor instance Rat Trap was about 5 feet tall as a robot and he turned\ninto a rat of approximately the same size. If you noticed in the\ncartoon he is much larger than your average rat. Transmetal  Megatron\nwas about 10 feet tall and he turned into a 10 tall T-rex, which is\nmuch smaller than the real world counter parts.\n\nWhat that means is that Rat Trap will not be small enough to climb\ninside walls or Windlord as he is a Deluxe size no matter if robot or\nbird (approximate 7&#39; or so).\n\nAnyways, I know we allowed it before, but I am attempting to keep us\nas close to the Beast Wars feel of things as is possible. This is just\nfood for thought as things get more intense later.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
