With any chance, they&#39;ll thank me after that... Minions, \n&gt; here I am! \n&gt; \n\nDeep within his fortress Vorpal sat, his thoughts dark and brooding.\nBeneath his hands lights flashed as information scrolled across a view\nscreen. Yes, he may have been silent all this time, but he had not been\nidle. He had plans, and he had things in motion. And perhaps that\nCyclonus could be used to further his plans ... if he could be trusted.\n\n\nHe smiled as he checked a few more things. It would only be a matter of\ntime before the next step in his plan would be ready. One view screen\nshowed a desert scene on the earth. Vorpal was about to tap a few keys\nto bring up more information about it when an alarm went off. \n\n&quot;Unknown intruder.&quot; The computers annyingly mechanical voice reported.\n&quot;Sector 776.&quot; \n\n&quot;Acknowledged.&quot; Vorpal grunted more then spoke. &quot;I may not have fancy\nnew sweeps like you do Cyclonus, or as many of them, but I have a few\nminions I can use.&quot; He said speaking to himself in a low growl of a\nvoice. Vorpal pressed another button and a few shapes emerged from an\nalcove above his base, looking like something serpentine and yet\nwinged. Boosters flared from behind them as the trio of them take off\ntoward the intruder.\n\nOOC: They should be visible to the newcommer as soon as he likes. They\ndo not appear to utilizing any sort of stealth gear.\n\nPreston\n(Vorpal)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
