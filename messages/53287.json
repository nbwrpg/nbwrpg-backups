He blasted his way through the ceiling of the\n&gt; &gt; vault and started climbing to the surface.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prophetus: DON&#39;T YOU GET IT? YOU ARE THE LAST ONE OF YOUR KIND! YOU\n&gt; &gt; ARE ALONE AND WILL BE FOREVER! EVEN PREDACONS WILL REJECT YOU!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He swung a huge bladed tail towards her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She heard him, but would not listen. She understood she was the\nlast, which \n&gt; made it all the more special & important. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her own memories of the world came to her, as she rushed along\ntowards the \n&gt; surface. But not fast enough for her. \n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually, she made it to the surface & made a beeline to the\nspaceport. \n&gt; There she searched for a chip to take off with. Anything.. but\nbefore hand, \n&gt; she hacked into one of the computers nearby... albeit short, as she\ngathered \n&gt; what info would be helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; Predacons.. upon a planet. She got the coordinates. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then left the comp quickly. She didn&#39;t want to get anything that\nwould be \n&gt; damaging. \n&gt; \n&gt; She spotted a ship that looked like a fast ship, even though it was\npossibly \n&gt; a freighter. She wished she was in her old form, she could possibly\nmake it \n&gt; to the world where the Predacons were. \n&gt; \n&gt; Running into the ship, she went to the cockpit, where she reved it\nup, within \n&gt; minutes, she blasted off. She had to leave. But swore she would\nreturn. & \n&gt; return with a new Decpeticon army to recapture Cybertron under the\nRIGHTFUL \n&gt; conquerers. \n&gt; \n&gt; The ship, with some supplies in it hold, took off, darting away from \n&gt; Cybertron. \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s destination... Earth (I hope this is the planet where they are on.)\n\n\n"}}
