Now on a piloted \nmech... hehehe!\n\nBic: Hurled throughout nearly a thousand light years from Strana \nMechty to the wave&#39;s point of origin, the warship exploded, killing \nthe many crewsman aboard. In space, however, the three mechs seemed to \nmelt... At least, they were shrinking. The seven meter-tall Solitaire \nbecame seven feet tall, the twelve meter Timber Wolf reduced to twelve \nfeet and the Dire Wolf stopped now at fifteen feet. Then, amazingly, \nit seemed the machines were screaming. In orbit of the earth, they all \nfell in, protected by the debris of the ship.\n\nAs Katya&#39;s and Ragnar&#39;s mechs fell down in the waters of the bay \nbetween Maximal and Predacon bases, Vlad came down at the southern \nedge of the southern continent, in a temperate forest.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
