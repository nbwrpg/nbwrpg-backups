Time Bomb was worried since everyone was shooting at Land Mine, he ran\n&gt;to her and found she was wounded pretty bad. The bad part was that she was\n&gt;quickly losing blood, and needed to have the blood flow stopped. He could\n&gt;burn her. No, that wouldn&#39;t work, the wound was too big and it would hurt\n&gt;her too much if he covered the whole thing. He decided he had to do a \n&gt;decent\n&gt;job, then. He powered his laser to flame mode and sent a small firey beam\n&gt;into her side. She was still bleeding, she wasn&#39;t even looking at him, just\n&gt;lifelessly looking at Megatron. Time Bomb knew why Land Mine always came\n&gt;prepared for this now. He took out her survival kit and wrapped her up, \n&gt;that\n&gt;would be okay for until they got back to base. Time Bomb picked up Land\n&gt;Mine, nodded to Megatron and sat down behind the rock next to Megatron...\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, August 02, 2000 7:33 PM\n&gt;Subject: Kick &#39;Em While They&#39;re Down\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Injector/Manterror:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Injector landed, a few feet from KitKat.  &quot;Hello, traitors!&quot; he said \n&gt;with\n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; smile, kicking at the side of KitKat&#39;s head, firing off a stinger \n&gt;missile\n&gt;at\n&gt; &gt; Terrorsaur.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manterror fired off a single ion disk at the rock Megatron was hiding\n&gt;behind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
