Shortly before he was going to turn he spoted\n&gt; a figure.  Probably and animal, but he wasn&#39;t sure.\n&gt; He went to robot mode and a laser sword poped out of\n&gt; his wrist compartment.  He dropped straight at\n&gt; Nightshade.\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: I had posted that when he was on the ground and\n&gt; Nightshade was trying to flank him he planted a\n&gt; grenade where he was likely to step on it as he moved.\n&gt;\n\nOOC: And Nightshade is a demolitions expert you think a dropped mine WHILE\nSHE&#39;S WATCHING YOU is gonna get her?

He was a maximal\nafterall, and attacking an unarmed unaggressive enemy was as impossible to\ntheir nature as was genocide.\n\n    Sitting back relaxed she waited for him to approach.\n\n\n\n"}}
