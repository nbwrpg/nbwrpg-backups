Raising his launcher, he fired a rocket off at Tigerhawk.\n\n---\n\nHades, got in behind the other Maximals, firing five laser bolts at \nTigerhawk&#39;s back, an optic blast at Liono&#39;s back.\n\n--- \n\nMost of the Predacons (Double Punch, Counter Punch, Manterror, Injector, and \nBumblebee) assembled as they saw the Maximals retreating,  Giving chase after \nthe Maximals, Dark One had been chasing, they chuckled.  They would finish \nit...tonight.\n\n---\n\nBoth punching, Nemesis went flying backwards through the air, slamming to the \nground from 30 ft up.  At the same time, Nemesis&#39; punch sent Serpentor \nslamming to the ground downwards.  Both getting up quickly, \nAnubis twirled througSerpentor tackled Nemesis, two swift punches followed.  \nRaising his rapid laser rifle, he fired twenty blasts.  Ten at Blue Stinger, \nten at Antagony.  Turning his head, an uppercut from Nemesis sent him to the \nground on his back.\n\n---\n\nThe Oblitercons, all in their vehicle modes except for Hiss, and minus Dark \nOne, exited into the clearing where the Maximals and Newcomers were, \nchuckling madly.\n\n"}}
