Being a drunk for the last while of his life, he&#39;d been in many barfights, and enjoyed them.\n\nDion turns his back and walks off, down the hallway, forgetting about Crotale. Rubbing his fist, he was surprised to discover that he felt respect for the Dinobot for responding to the punch that well.\n\nI gotta get to know him, he notes mentally, stopping and trying to remember where he was headed.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The fist smashed in to Grimlocks face as he turned around. It was the\n&gt; first thing he saw. His visor went off, then back on in a few seconds.\n&gt; Grimlock leaned forward into Dion&#39;s face. &quot;PLEASE, don&#39;t waste my time\n&gt; Autoscrap.&quot; Grimlock rudely said, as he turned his back on Dion, and\n&gt; began to walk again. He shook his neck ,as the joint cracked. This\n&gt; Autobot could hit, Grimlock thought. But not like a Dinobot.\n\n\n"}}
