The ran to the ramp, letting it open, \nthen saw the battle. And there, was Transulus. He stood, eyeing the battle \ncarefull, looking for the mouse. He focused his optics, looking past the \nPredacons, even Transulas. He looked to the right, by the trees was limp \nbody of the mouse-bot.\n\nQuickstrike charged off. &quot;Auto-guns, on-line.&quot; he commaded. They came to \nattention, firing at Maximal signatures.
