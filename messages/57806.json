I would STRONGLY urge you to either attend OTFCC in Chicago, IL in \nJuly 2004 or the very last real BotCon in Pasadena, CA in June of 2004. Glen \nHallit promises to make OTFCC THE best, & has it planned to run 3 days! So far he \nhas planned a mystery dinner for Friday night with the theme of &quot;Who shot \nOptimus Prime?&quot;, skits, much of what has been in the past conventions & SO much \nmore. Currently a lot is in the works. \n\nAnyway... I must say briefly, that it was a fantastic convention. I truly had \nthe time of my life. The voice actors are very interactive, even at the party \nSaturday night thrown by Allspark.com & Transfandom.com they showed up! Their \nperformance in the live script reading was beyond fantastic, it was \nspectacular & full of laughs. All 3 actors - Greg Berger, Garry Chalk & David Kaye - \nwere always around somewhere & guaranteed you always had a chance to speak with \nthem if only to say &quot;hi&quot; & shake their hand or an autograph. The same applied \nto Vince DiCola & Simon Furmon who were always around & interacted well, \navailable to sign autographs & chat. I got pictures with all the actors & with \nVince DiCola. I didn&#39;t get one with Simon Furmon, but.. I would imagine that yes, \nnext year that will be a major possiblity. \nFriday night, after the supper was rather fun for fans besides searching for \nparts, as there was a lightsaber battle which I & Jive (Katherine) started. \nJive has footage of this which several people already asked for copies. :) This \nmade us both so excited & this is something that we hope to do again next \nyear.\nThe toys some people were disappointed in. But, I can&#39;t say that I am. The \ntoys ended up to be Transformers Universe Sideswipe & 2 femmes - sisters - \nAutobot Roulette & Decepticon Shadow Striker. The hotel exclusive was Sunstreaker. \nNow, Sunstreaker & Sideswipe were not like the original Gen 1 style, in fact a \ndifferent style which looks somewhat like RiD or Armada. The t-shirt was \nrather neat though some people didn&#39;t particularly think it was spectacular. \nHowever, I thought it was rather nice. \nAnyway... i figured I give you a taste of OTFCC 2003. Again, I will do a FULL \nreport WITH pictures (Hopefully) by the end of the weekend. \nCiao!\nStac\n\r\n--part1_1e0.e14e082.2c575efe_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=3Darial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=3D2 FAMILY=3D&quot;SANSSERIF&quot; FAC=\r\nE=3D&quot;Arial&quot; LANG=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;I&#39;m back all! &lt;BR&gt;\nI must say I had a GREAT time!
