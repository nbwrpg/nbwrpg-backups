Today was the final day, but three winners havn&#39;t been decided\nyet.\n\nThe results of the last poll were:\n\nrAuq@...\t\t4\nRfa007@... \t3\nRudra656@... \t3\nKSLawdogg@... \t3\nIcedemon101@...\t2\nTMRattrap@...\t4\nAlloran2@...\t3\nKinger01030@...\t2\n\nQuite a few of you are probably staring at the screen with jaws dropping\nabout now. And yeah, I&#39;m surprised too.\n\nAnyways, only two people made it onto the council for now (Megan and rAuq,\nyou can stop worrying now). As you can all probably see, third place was a\ntie between Robo, Rudra, KSL, and Alloran. I put up a Council Election\n(Round 2) poll featuring those four people as the four options. This poll\nis only going to go on for 1 day, so everyone get your votes in\nquickly. Tomorrow evening we should have the third person elected, and\nthen we can get on with all this.\n\nThe first poll is still up, but if you try to vote at it, you&#39;ll get an\nerror. That poll&#39;s been closed, its just there so people can view the\nresults.\n\n\n"}}
