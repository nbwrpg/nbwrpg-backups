He didn&#39;t like loosing \n&gt;his\n&gt; &gt; temper at base, and the only ones there to yell at were the females.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He saw a rather large rock formation in the distance. He slowed his pace\n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; stopped to study it. &quot;Say look at that.&quot; he said. He blinked at it. He\n&gt; &gt; zoomed in on it with his optics and found out that it was a cave. It had \n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; pointed top and a rather open area around the front.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He nodded his head to Stingtra. &quot;Wanna go check that out?
