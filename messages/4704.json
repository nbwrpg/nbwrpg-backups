Like me you seek the night \nyour grace could easily lure anyone into a false sense of trust but \nsomehow I know otherwise. Who are these beings you speak of? are they \nrobots like us? &quot; Lunarpine follows his new aquaintance eager to \nlearn all he can before deciding his final fate.\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him.\n&gt; &quot;Well Lunarpine, what do you feel like then?  What does your \ninstincts tell \n&gt; you to do?  When we get back to the ship, it may be that your \ntalents will \n&gt; be used for scouting, for fighting, for anything?  I don&#39;t know.  \nI&#39;m not \n&gt; any kind of leader.  I hardly fit in myself.  But I try to do what \nI think \n&gt; is right.  If you feel that this isn&#39;t right for you, then go and \nfollow \n&gt; your instincts.  But becareful.  There are those here that would \nuse you for \n&gt; scrap metal.  They will use what you have and then kill you when \nyour \n&gt; usefulness runs out.  I offer you a chance to make a difference and \nmaybe \n&gt; even a better chance of survival.&quot;\n&gt; She knelt down and stared into his wolf eyes.\n&gt; &quot;Follow your instincts.  I followed mine and found some good \nfriends. I hope \n&gt; you choose the same path as I.  IF not,&quot;  she sighed deeply, &quot;I&#39;d \nhate to \n&gt; fight such a handsome bot as yourself.&quot;  She got up and started \nwalking \n&gt; through the forest.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
