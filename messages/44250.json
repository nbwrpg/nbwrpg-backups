The Maximals\nhad been victorious, they weren&#39;t even chasing their\nenemies, but instead letting them flee, and for such a\ndeed why should they be attacked (whether this bot was\nwith the first bots or not). Suddenly a wave of anger\nflows through mutate. Energon begins coming out of his\nmouth in an unstable wave. He flies in a wild charge\nup to the bot just as the energy is released only 2\nfeet from this bot.\n\nOOC: Thanks Nemasis (did I spell it right) I&#39;ve been\ndieing to do that and don&#39;t complain because he did it\non the show whenever he got scared or angry. And it\nmight do some damage to Rampage, how far do you\nestimate this bot was from Rampage?\n\n--- Legendarynemasis@... wrote:\n&gt; Just as Megatron orders the Decepticons to retreat,\n&gt; the mysterious robot from \n&gt; the Infecticons arrives on the scene. He flys and\n&gt; hovers down onto the ground \n&gt; a short distance from megatron, his arms crossed,\n&gt; his black, red, and grey \n&gt; form gleaming in the sunlight. The field of energy\n&gt; that surrounds him then \n&gt; dissapears and an intense shockwave is sent out from\n&gt; his body knocking large \n&gt; boulders away from him.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;So the decepticons have been defeated despite\n&gt; the Maximal base having \n&gt; been incapacitated. This news is most unsettling,\n&gt; yet I can not help but feel \n&gt; obligated to make sure the Maximals lose this day.\n&gt; It is now time to seperate \n&gt; the weak from the strong here... the weak ones being\n&gt; the Maximals. \n&gt; Decepticons, do not give up and combat the Maximals.\n&gt; Fight to your deaths if \n&gt; neccesary!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The bot just continued to stand there, bolts of\n&gt; energy gliding along the \n&gt; smooth metallic plates of his armor.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
