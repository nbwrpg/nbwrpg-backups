Yet he had to control\n&gt; his rage for everyone around him. Yet his expression tells all. Narrowed\n&gt; eyes, tensing fist, this was his greatest test of temper.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s best you listen to them Nightshift. Try not to slip back into\n&gt; robot mode if you can help it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift nods. Yet he tries to reach behind him to lick it. Licking\n&gt; wounds often soothes the pain for many felines, as he tries to do the\n&gt; same.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No! Don&#39;t do that Nightshift! Don&#39;t touch it!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift growls in frustration.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But it hurts and itches!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot waddles over and holds a can of liquid coolant.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maybe this will stop the itch. Tucson&#39;s right, don&#39;t touch it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift lies back down as Straightshot applies the coolant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson&#39;s expression deepens with intent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If indeed this is from Cybertron, then it&#39;s reason to believe that\n&gt; those who deployed this weapon, we&#39;re either from our world or they are\n&gt; working with those who are. I will search everywhere and I will not rest\n&gt; until I have found them. And if by chance any of you find them before I\n&gt; do, I want them brought to the cave near the Ark, where the old dragon\n&gt; resided. That is where I will pass judgement on them. This planet is\n&gt; under the guardianship of Talon and myself, any affairs of that nature\n&gt; will be dealt by us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to the doorway , transforms into beast mode and let&#39;s out a\n&gt; thunderous roar of warning and assertiveness. A message to those to heed\n&gt; his word and respect the land which he guards.\n&gt; Tucson turns back to Talon and almost immediately, his expression softens\n&gt; and he stands beside her, gently rubbing his face against her shoulder.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon followed Tucson closely without said a word\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I didn&#39;t mean to scare you, I&#39;m sorry.  That was meant to knock some sense\n&gt; into whoever is out there, desecrating our planet.&quot;\n\nSANTON and BUMP watched as the coolant was applied to NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s wound.\n\n&quot;The coolant slowed the progression.&quot; BUMPsaid\n\nSANTON nodded in agreement. &quot;We may have a way to slow this down but\nwe need to get you to the medical bay.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from BUMP as well.\n\nMeanwhile LEGACY and BIG CONVOY had walked outside led by RODIMUS\nPRIME looking around at TUCSON and TALON.\n\n&quot;You are not alone in the protection of this world.&quot; RODIMUS said. &quot;I\nOPTIMAL RODIMUS PRIME will help you and keep this world safe from the\nencroachment of our kind.&quot; He looked around, &quot;This world has much\ngrowing to do and the longer we all stay here the more damage we will\ndo.&quot;\n\n&quot;And that is why we must leave.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he walked up as\nwell. &quot;That was one of the objectives of my mission, this planet is to\nbe emptied as soon as possible - Predacons, Maximals and colonists.&quot;\nHe said emphatically. &quot;Everyone.&quot;\n\nLEGACY straightened as his optic shimmered, &quot;Perhaps that is why\nanother of my kind has awakened!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
