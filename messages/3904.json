He goes\n&gt;the long way around, although safer. Around the\n&gt;battle. He prays that no one will see him, although he\n&gt;is in stealth mode, he knows he is more vulnerable in\n&gt;his robot mode. He transforms back into his beast mode\n&gt;and stalks around the battle. He is almost there when\n&gt;he spots a fellow maximal in need. The bot named Prowl\n&gt;was hit but still fighting. He sighs and transforms\n&gt;into robot mode. He runs into battle firing his\n&gt;electric gun at the people that hit Prowl, taking a\n&gt;few minor hits as he reaches Prowl.*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; Need help! I do, but my sis says it&#39;s a mental\n&gt;thing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Shadow Cat sees Snow Tech run into battle. She is\n&gt;furious! He was supposed to go to Iron!*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; SNOW TECH, YOU DORK! YOU WHERE SUPPOSED TO GO HERE\n&gt;NOT THERE!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * She yelled across the battle field to him. Damn he\n&gt;was stupid! She continued to Iron, making sure she\n&gt;took no more damage then that to her back. She reaches\n&gt;her quickly. She begins to fire at the bots firing at\n&gt;Iron, making sure her shots count. She smiled up at\n&gt;the larger bot.*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; thought you needed help, mind if i join, or is this\n&gt;battle taken?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Send instant messages with Yahoo!
