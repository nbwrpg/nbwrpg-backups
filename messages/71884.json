Leo, can you bring that data up for me by=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chance?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The strategist part of Tucson comes back =\r\nto life as he begins to piece\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things together as he did on Cybertro=\r\nn, years ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; This definitely takes me back In time when =\r\nI was going over this with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; senior officers vorns ago. I actuall=\r\ny enjoyed this aspect of military duty,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was a good challenge for=\r\n a rookie in training. And the strange aspect of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that was the fact =\r\nI just simply had a knack for solving complex strategies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHe then thinks of Optimus Primal, and how they could determine his last\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; location.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Mathematics, it has everything to do with =\r\nnumbers. The geographic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates, they lead to areas of latitude=\r\n and longitude. Now, to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Primal, he must have informed someone =\r\nas to where he was going. We chart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the distance between here and th=\r\ne intended destination, and map out various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; routes leading to that =\r\nlocation. You will come up with several different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scenarios but, th=\r\ney will all point to one area of bilocation. We then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; factor in his =\r\nrate of speed he was traveling at, including the time he left\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here,=\r\n and the time it takes to reach the final destination. Then, determine\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the time of his last transmission and that will indicate how far he got=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where he could possibly be now. I know it sounds complicated, =\r\nbut it worked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Cybertron, so let&#39;s see if that will work here.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;One thing I have found Tuscon is that often=\r\n times one cannot solve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every mystery while sitting at the drawing bo=\r\nard.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manipulating the console LEO attempted to locate the inf=\r\normation. &quot;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; last record of Optimus Primal . . . and at that point =\r\nhe was Optimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus, was at the Base of the Pacifist Maximals the =\r\nAtlantis base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He paused and read further. &quot;An interesting point tha=\r\nt was registered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at that point was that thee was an Optimal Optimus P=\r\nrime as well as an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked confused, then nodded,=\r\n &quot;There was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting trying to determine if one was a minion or not.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: See messages in Dec 2005 for reference to what I&#39;m tal=\r\nking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about.

He looks to Leo at the same&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; time.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Yes, that&#39;s rig=\r\nht, there was definitely high concentrations of Unicronian&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; energy being used at that point of time. Every being casts their own&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; energy frequency whether it be low, medium or high, depending=\r\n on that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Individuals strength profile. Now, if those sign=\r\natures are the same coming&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from those various locations, =\r\nit would indicate that the same individual is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible=\r\n for those abductions. Leo, can you bring that data up for me by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; chance?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The strategist part of=\r\n Tucson comes back to life as he begins to piece&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; things t=\r\nogether as he did on Cybertron, years ago.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot; This definitely takes me back In time when I was going over this with=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; senior officers vorns ago. I actually enjoyed this a=\r\nspect of military duty,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it was a good challenge for a roo=\r\nkie in training. And the strange aspect of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that was the f=\r\nact I just simply had a knack for solving complex strategies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He then thinks of Optimus Primal, and how they coul=\r\nd determine his last&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; location.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Mathematics, it has everything to do with numbers. The geograph=\r\nic&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates, they lead to areas of latitude and longit=\r\nude. Now, to find&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Primal, he must have informed someone a=\r\ns to where he was going. We chart&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the distance between he=\r\nre and the intended destination, and map out various&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rout=\r\nes leading to that location. You will come up with several different&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; scenarios but, they will all point to one area of bilocation. W=\r\ne then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; factor in his rate of speed he was traveling at, i=\r\nncluding the time he left&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; here, and the time it takes to =\r\nreach the final destination. Then, determine&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of =\r\nhis last transmission and that will indicate how far he got and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; where he could possibly be now. I know it sounds complicated, but it=\r\n worked&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on Cybertron, so let&#39;s see if that will work here=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;One t=\r\nhing I have found Tuscon is that often times one cannot solve&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nevery mystery while sitting at the drawing board.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Manipulating the console LEO attempted to locate the information. &quot;The&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; last record of Optimus Primal . . . and at that point he was Op=\r\ntimal&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Optimus, was at the Base of the Pacifist Maximals the At=\r\nlantis base.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He paused and read further. &quot;An interesting poin=\r\nt that was registered&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; at that point was that thee was an Optim=\r\nal Optimus Prime as well as an&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Optimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked con=\r\nfused, then nodded, &quot;There was a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting trying to determine i=\r\nf one was a minion or not.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (OOC: See messages i=\r\nn Dec 2005 for reference to what I&#39;m talking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; about. Tuscon was=\r\n not here at that point, but the data logs are still&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; present)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He paused, &quot;I don&#39;t see if anything was truely r=\r\nesolved on that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; issue.&quot; Pausing again, &quot;Infact Primal disappea=\r\nrs soon after that with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; no other references given.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
