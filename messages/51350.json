I&#39;m not going to do a long rant, &gt;so I&#39;ll cut to the chase. It&#39;s simple, you see. Things are not like they were before. You and &gt;others can laugh all you want, as we KNOW you think this is an over-rated joke, but I just &gt;wanted to let you know that you are no longer a player here, and you are belittled by the &gt;nWo and some non-nWo&#39;ites out there. I expect somebody to reply either a long, boring &gt;post against this or insulting the me or the nWo, or else a short, boring post doing the same. &gt;HAVE A NICE DAY.....brother. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;(OOC:&nbsp; The &#39;coburn&#39; jibba jabba rings bells, but my memory is Scheisse, so excuse me if I consider your post rather insignificant.&nbsp; ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do not need you to tell me this RPG is different, I would have to be blind not to notice.&nbsp; There are new members, new staff.&nbsp; Hell, ol&#39; Ivan the Russian isn&#39;t even around, busy making games &lt;A href=&quot;http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net/&lt;/A&gt;&nbsp; &lt;--- That&#39;s Yanshosh&#39;s site.&nbsp; He and a friend of his are evidently making games or some such.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t played them, but Yan&#39;s smart so I&#39;d urge people to check it out.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry, got sidetracked plugging Yanshosh&#39;s website.&nbsp; Anyway, I am a player here, I&#39;ve officially joined.&nbsp; If you&#39;re referring to me not being in the Council, you have a point.&nbsp; I have no power, and I don&#39;t particularly care.&nbsp; Keep in mind&nbsp;I &lt;EM&gt;left&lt;/EM&gt; the Council.&nbsp; I have adminstrative and writing responsobilities in a few other RPGs and online wrestling federations.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don&#39;t have a shred of desire to run/pull a God Nightshade/control this RPG, Rauq can enjoy running it along with the current Council.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And I was belittled before I rejoined, &quot;Eric&quot;,&nbsp;it didn&#39;t bother me then and it doesn&#39;t bother me now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply because I didn&#39;t care about you or your opinions when I was here before, and I certainly don&#39;t care about them now.&nbsp; As for the&nbsp;nWo, do&nbsp;what you want with them.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel it&#39;s a bad idea, but if you want to do it&nbsp;Der Deutsch Devil isn&#39;t gonna stop you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny how things never change.&nbsp; Still people posting things that don&#39;t concern anything IC over yahoogroups when there&#39;s a perfectly fine message board.&nbsp; So please,&nbsp;you and everyone else who harbors animosity towards me, keep it OOC.&nbsp; Again, your Scheisse was completely uncalled for, so please,&nbsp;unless you are responding ICly to my roleplays, I don&#39;t want to hear anything you or your&nbsp;jungen have to say.&nbsp; But on a sidenote...Predacons...how about a little reprogramming assitance, eh? ;) )&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: &lt;a href=&#39;http://g.msn.com/1HM1ENUS/c144??PS=47575&#39;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
