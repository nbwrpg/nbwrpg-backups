He was amazed by her transformation. She \nnow had three complete modes. Well two and a half. This griffin mode \nshe sported seemed uncontrolled. It was a form that looked as if she \ndidn&#39;t know how to transform properly, or couldn&#39;t decide which to \ntransform into. With time she&#39;d probably learn to control it, until \nthen it she&#39;d live with it.\n\nLunarpine watched her transform, the white fur changed into feathers, \nher form was as he remembered it, an owl. A little larger than he \nremembered but the same none the less. When she transformed to her \nhalf stage it worried him. She had all these new abilities and \nresponsibilities but she still had to learn control. He would work \nwith her as would Veratis but he didn&#39;t know how or what she was to \nbe.\n\nOOC Time for me to go to work, I&#39;ll play more tomorrow.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; OOC( Yeah, I know, it just made the story line more interesting.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; She smiled at Lunarpine. She could tell he still cared for her as \nshe \n&gt; did for him. \n&gt; \n&gt; She frowned a bit. &quot;Well, gee, things are going to get really \nboring \n&gt; around here aren&#39;t they.&quot; She sighed and knew it was to the good of \n&gt; the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; She heard him give the order to transform. She didn&#39;t think she was \n&gt; going to change into what she already knew she could change into. \nShe \n&gt; stood on her hind legs and engaged the transfomation order.\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt something tingle in her body.  Huge gray wings appeared on \n&gt; her back. Her head changed into that of a great owl, but her body \nwas \n&gt; that of a polar bear.\n&gt; She squawked and roared. She looked at herself and felt something \n&gt; move inside. She Reared up and finished her transfomation into a \n&gt; Great Owl. She squawked and shifted again. Into full polar bear \nmode.\n&gt; \n&gt; her bot mode was now replaced with a griffen type of mode, but \n&gt; instead of Eagle and lion, it was owl and polarbear.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Veratis in her bot mode. &quot;OK, so how was that?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis stepped back at Ice&#39;s first movement toward him. He was \nbut \n&gt; a morsel\n&gt; &gt; to her now, Her thoughts came to him and he saw the truth about \nher\n&gt; &gt; feelings. he extended a hand and patted her on the top of the \n&gt; head. &quot;No harm\n&gt; &gt; was done this time, the virus was contained on time.&quot; he turned \n&gt; back to the\n&gt; &gt; scans &quot;Until we get the virus entirely out of your system you&#39;re \n&gt; still under\n&gt; &gt; quarentine, the only contact you should have is with me or \n&gt; Lunarpine.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; knew that if her control over her telepathic abilities was that \n&gt; fragile\n&gt; &gt; she&#39;d know the reasons behind it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine grinned a devilish grin at her thoughts to him. She \n&gt; didn&#39;t have to\n&gt; &gt; tell him her fealings for him, he suspected they hadn&#39;t \nchanged. &quot;I \n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; Wing me too.&quot; he said leaving Veratis out of the loop.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis studied the makeup of the DNA strands. She was a bear, \n&gt; there was no\n&gt; &gt; sign of the Owl DNA. Then it hit him like a brick, the DNA \nstrands \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; intertwined around her techno core. &quot;Try and transform and see \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; happens.&quot; He told her as he tried to put together the last couple \n&gt; pieces of\n&gt; &gt; her existence. If his hypothesis (OOH Big word.) was correct \nthere \n&gt; was more\n&gt; &gt; to her than meets the eye.(Little transformers pun intended.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 14, 2000 6:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Ice\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked down at Lunarpine. She had a slight smile slip \nacross \n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he face. She cold still read his mind even though he tried to \nhide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his thoughts. She was pleased that he liked her new form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked at Veratis as he scanned her. She ws glad that the \n&gt; virus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t going to kill her or get her killed. &quot;That is good news. \n&gt; But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what happens now?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She read his thoughts and the smile on her face dissappeared. \nShe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could read the anger in his mind. She lower her body down and \n&gt; changed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into full bear mode. She took a step closer to Veratis. She put \n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts in his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think that I was \n&gt; hurting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you. I was more afraid of what Lunarpine thought and didn&#39;t \nwant \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; face that. I didn&#39;t think I could spread the virus as I was. I \n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know it could have the effect that it could have. Or that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; putting anything it touched in jeopardy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She nuzzled her huge head against Veratis shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. \nI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t do it again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She turned and faced Lunarpine. She smiled again and filled his \n&gt; head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with thought of how much she cared for him and how much she had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missed him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
