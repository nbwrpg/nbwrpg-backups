Megatron was mad with Kitkat. It was her fault this was \ngoing on. But, the bot must be an important bot if they want it so bad.\n    &quot;Kitkat! What the hell do you think your doing?&quot; He demanded, ready to \npummle her with his closed fist. His eyes were closed into little angry \ncrimsome slits.\n    Waspinator ran to the control boad and began to initiate more autoguns \nand re-routed power to the shields. He then turned to see if Megatron was \ngoing to beat Kitkat.\n\n    Aracnia oversaw the construction and was pleased. The shield generator \nwas up and functional, and already they had twelve double barrle auto-guns. \nAnd with the forest around them, they had a great advantage.\n    &quot;Alright, Im going inside. Tarantulas you come too. I want to find out \nwho these aliens are and why they made this bunker.&quot; She said, opening the \nhatch and getting ready to climb down.\n    Tarantulas walked over, &quot;Very well. I would like to investigate this new \ntechnology myself.&quot;\n    Thw two arachnids entered the bunker and climbed into the darkness.\n\n"}}
