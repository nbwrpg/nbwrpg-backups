(He&#39;d never trust a predacon with his back. He might get a \nknife in it.)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Dachande85@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Magmatron/Bobertron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;That insect will let us spy on the bot who is trying to spy on \nus.&quot; \n&gt; Magmatron explained to Bobertron. &quot;It will also infect all others \nof it&#39;s \n&gt; kind with the same virus.
