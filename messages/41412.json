He hears her saying something, but doesn&#39;t pick the words out, though her tone didn&#39;t sound too good.\n\nFlipping open his wrist comps, he taps a few buttons, ordering several maintenance bots to get to his position. He wanted those beasts moved where he could easier monitor them.\n\nClosing his wrist comp, he waits by the door for Lady Hawk to exit.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OK. found it, One of three things must have occured. I missed it and deleted\n&gt; it accidentally, I was tired and slept through, or I was so overwhelmed by\n&gt; OOC&#39;s that I passed it up thinking it was another one.\n&gt; \n&gt; FZ nods, looking over the beasts once more.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes. I must admit I wasn&#39;t expecting you to accomplish this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns and walks toward the exit, the door opening. &quot;Would you like a\n&gt; shuttle\n&gt; to get back to wherever you are from, or would you rather fly by yourself\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk smiles for the first time in a while. Knowing that Shuttles could\n&gt; be traced she decided leaving on her own would be her best bet. &quot;I can fly\n&gt; thank you.&quot; Soon as FZ had exited she gathered up the samples that Zardus\n&gt; was kind enough to gather for her as well as a sample of DNA from each of\n&gt; her creations and prepared to leave.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Before I go though&quot; she thought, &quot;I&#39;ll give my creations a work out.&quot;\n&gt; carefully the daughter of Veratis set a timer on the two force cages\n&gt; surrounding the Aliens. &quot;I should be half way home when these two come out\n&gt; to play.&quot; she looked up toward the security camera. &quot;I&#39;ve programmed a\n&gt; failsafe into the cages, if anything happens to me on the way out the DNA\n&gt; will deteriorate making it useless to you.&quot; Lady Hawk stretched her wings\n&gt; one more time before moving toward the door.\n\n\n"}}
