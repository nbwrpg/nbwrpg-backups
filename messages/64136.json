She was in a dark room\nwith grey\n&gt;   &gt;   walls. She obviously did not recognize the place. In fact she\nhardly\n&gt;   &gt;   remembered anything... except a burning mix of emotions towards\n&gt;   &gt;   someone... Azure. Where was he now?\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   As she stood up in a prone position, a door slid open and a tall\n&gt;   &gt;   robot, with huge weapons in his back, entered without saying a\nword.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Balistica: You&#39;re the one who had me repaired? Well, I guess I-\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   ???: You have three choices, Maximal. (He turned to face her)\nYou see,\n&gt;   &gt;   we are quite a xenophobic bunch here.

We believe that the Maximals\nare going\n&gt;   &gt;   to lead us astray. War is brewing, and survival means we must\nimpose\n&gt;   &gt;   our leadership.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Balistica: On second thought...
