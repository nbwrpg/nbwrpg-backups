Bu=\r\nt he could see several tiny wires, and quietly nibbles on them to see what =\r\nlittle good that could do.  \n\nOut on the battle field, Tucson concentrates,=\r\n knowing what kind of attack was enveloping his comrades and himself.  He h=\r\nad once learned from his sensai, how to clear his mind, and focus on the ta=\r\nsk at hand.  Clearing his directory... Was that the way to lift the fog tha=\r\nt Phobia had beset upon them?  Night Shift was the only one who could read =\r\nhis thoughts, due to the fact that he too, had the same sensai as Tucson.  =\r\nHe catches on quickly, and takes a deep breath, clearing his mind of everyt=\r\nhing.  \n\nAs Tucson clears his mind, he could feel the breath of those many =\r\nheads hitting his body from all angles.  Based on this information, he atte=\r\nmpts to backfist one of the heads he feels behind him.  And in pure ninja f=\r\nashion, he keeps quiet.\n\nNight Shift now focuses on his job at hand, and dr=\r\naws a ninjitsu blade from the back of his left shoulder. \n\nTucson then look=\r\ns to everyone.  He sends a silent com to Kup and everyone else.\n\n&quot;Comrades,=\r\n this is an attack of the mind.  Mind over matter.  If you clear your minds=\r\n you may find it easier to overcome the attack beset by Phobia.  Just a lit=\r\ntle something Night Shift and I learned from our Sensai, Master Yokitron, v=\r\norns ago.&quot;\n\nNow completely focused, Night Shift nodds, and his expression c=\r\nhanges to Determination rather than fear.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s do this.

Someone&#39;s opening the door.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For n=\r\now before doing anything, he&#39;d have to wait until someone closed the \n&gt; doo=\r\nr before he could make his move.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the battle scene, Tucson focuses o=\r\nn what he has to do, but then, a flash \n&gt; back is quick to flood his circui=\r\ntry.  It was the day he feared that he had \n&gt; het his Autobot comrades down=\r\n, by being taken off line suddenly during a \n&gt; horrific battle against the =\r\nDecepticons.  It was this fear of failure that \n&gt; he would stick to his gun=\r\ns, literally and be sure that his comrades would \n&gt; NOT be failed once agai=\r\nn!\n&gt; \n&gt; He sticks close to Talon, and the others, trying his hardest to shi=\r\neld them \n&gt; from harm.  It was something he thought he had failed to do so =\r\nvorns ago. \n&gt; His fear of losing the ones he cares about, now floods him.  =\r\nFailure would \n&gt; not be an option for him, as he very much fears it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\n No Hydras, I will not fall to you now or ever again.  Failure to me is NOT=\r\n \n&gt; an option!  I will NOT fail my faction or the Maximals! &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He draws=\r\n his sword, like a Knight facing a fierce dragon.  He circles \n&gt; Hydras, an=\r\nd then listens carefully to his foot steps while wileding his \n&gt; blade mast=\r\nerfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Night Shift&#39;s fear was simple, he had always had a=\r\nn aversion to \n&gt; oversized arachnids.  Now, he sees a large spider&#39;s web fr=\r\nom the corner of \n&gt; his eyes, and is quick to jump back away from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;WOAH SCRAP!  WHAT THE PIT?!  I AIN&#39;T STEPPN&#39; ANOTHER STEP FURTHER! \n&gt; WHAT=\r\nEVER MADE THAT WEB&#39;S GOTTA BE BIG, UGLY AND BAD NEWS!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson listens.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Night Shift, keep it together! &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift transforms and tr=\r\nies to back up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Uhh uhh, when it comes ta oversized spiders, I ain&#39;t =\r\ngonna have anythn&#39; ta \n&gt; do with it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson narrows his optics.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Oh no, Phobia... Night Shift, listen to me!  Everyone, listen to me! \n&gt; Ph=\r\nobia has deployed a fear tactic!  You have to try your best to resist it! \n=\r\n&gt; It&#39;s the only way to shake it off!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He then turns back to Hydras, an=\r\nd remembers that if he did attack the \n&gt; predacon leader with a blade, and =\r\nif he had managed to slice off a head, two \n&gt; more would grow back and what=\r\n would be the sense of doing that?\n&gt; \n&gt; His fear of failure was still real,=\r\n but his knowledge of old legends was \n&gt; still fresh in his directory.  The=\r\n only way to stop a Hydra, was to cast a \n&gt; flame upon it&#39;s body that was n=\r\not its own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson accesses his smaller blast cannons, and sets fire t=\r\no a piece of \n&gt; fallen debris and takes it up into his hand like a torch.  =\r\nIt was a \n&gt; primative method of combat, but if legend still held true, it w=\r\nould ward \n&gt; Hydras off.  Hopefully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Slice one head off a hydra, and =\r\ntwo grow back.  But cast a fire upon it \n&gt; that is not its own, will indefi=\r\nnitely see to its demise...  Phobia may have \n&gt; caused fear, but she had no=\r\n idea that her effect on me, would actually \n&gt; inhibit me to resort to reso=\r\nurceful thinking rather than running away.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He now stands solid with t=\r\nhe large torch in hand, waiting to see what Hydras \n&gt; would do next.  This =\r\nwas it, a page right out of mythology.  The legend of \n&gt; Hercules stuck sol=\r\nidly in his directory.  Having read something about it, in \n&gt; his spare tim=\r\ne as a regular Autobot, vorns ago, the story stuck well in his \n&gt; mind, and=\r\n now was coming in handy.  The legend itself depicted Hercules \n&gt; facing th=\r\ne Hydra and finding that cutting off its head was not the way to \n&gt; kill th=\r\ne beast.  But taking a torch to it would mean certain death for the \n&gt; crea=\r\nture.  And he did just that, in the legend.  But Tucson&#39;s fear did \n&gt; sprea=\r\nd beyond failure.  His fear of dishonoring his Autobot and Maximal \n&gt; comra=\r\ndes was now apparent.  He was a Prime after all, and the Autobot way, \n&gt; wa=\r\ns not to take a life needlessly.  So, he remains perfectly still, torch in =\r\n\n&gt; hand, facing Hydras with a brave face, but yet, afraid to do the final d=\r\need, \n&gt; in fear of dishonoring his bretheren.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Night Shift g=\r\nets back into robot mode, and notices a lot of \n&gt; spider web material aroun=\r\nd him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Great, more webs, more spiders...  I hate spiders.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Back =\r\nat the Ark, Quickstride suddenly realizes that his stinky surprise goes \n&gt; =\r\nterribly wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ooooops.... I sooo didn&#39;t mean to do that....
