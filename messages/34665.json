It\nhad been doing this very thing for countless years, but there was\nalways something to draw his attention. Lately it has been a war on\nearth. The Vok had taken interests in time being continuous, and had\nrecruited a bot from the planet to work for him. That bot was Zardus,\nbut hadn&#39;t accomplished much lately.\n\nThe Vok was examining Zardus&#39;s progress on the planet when the call\ncame. It instantly knew who the caller was: an Ikoto. Those annoying\nbeings were a thorn sometimes, but the Vok delt with them.\n\nWithin seconds though time wasn&#39;t mesured in units by the Vok, the\ngolden head floated up to the three Ikoto. It looked them over flatly.\n\n&quot;I have recieved your call and arrived,&quot; it said without speaking,\n&quot;Why have you disturbed my duty?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; *Predicts this post to be the next winner for best entrance post \n&gt; sequence.* =P\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Azafroth / Brodak / Uokarase / Ikoto ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Azafroth floats in the endless void that is known as outer space. \n&gt; His corporal body shimmers as he absorbs the energies being \n&gt; produced by a quasar, a loan bright light that dominates the \n&gt; surrounding nothingness. He notes that his next target source of \n&gt; energy is the event horizon of a distant black hole. His thoughts \n&gt; drift to the nearest Ikoto to him, Brodak, who stirs from his semi-\n&gt; eternal feasting. &quot;Azafroth, this bores me,&quot; He breakes off from the \n&gt; energy source, having sated himself enough for now. &quot;We will find \n&gt; something---&quot; he pauses to consider something, &quot;something more \n&gt; interesting, perhaps the destruction of a planet,&quot; Azafroth&#39;s non-\n&gt; existent eyes flare up, &quot;Ha, a suitable idea... Uokarase, what is \n&gt; your input on this idea?&quot; The two direct their attentions to \n&gt; another... thing feasting off the quasar. Uokarase breaks off from \n&gt; the source to join the others in thought. &quot;I find the idea amusing, \n&gt; how shall we go about it?&quot; Azafroth&#39;s translucent body shimmers \n&gt; multiple colours, &quot;I have an idea. The Vok.&quot; he says simply, &quot;We \n&gt; shall dally with them. I know that they have at least one planet \n&gt; under their control, or they attempt to dominate it. We will propose \n&gt; to them a sort of gamble on the outcome of that planet. We \n&gt; propose a bet that a group of out pawns will attempt to over thrown \n&gt; the Vok&#39;s pawns and control the planet. If this happens we will \n&gt; cause a chain reaction explosion of the planet and,&quot; Azafroth \n&gt; almost flickers with delight as the others listen, &quot;and we will use \n&gt; the energy from the explosion as a charger for our bodies, much \n&gt; better than stupid quasars.&quot; He finishes and has left the other\nIkoto \n&gt; flickering as well. Brodak and Uokarase both immediately agree, \n&gt; and they begin periodic teleporations to find the Vok.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; At an indeterminable time later, the three Ikoto have traveled far,\nto \n&gt; an indeterminable location of energizing beauty. Azafroth projects a \n&gt; summoning though to any nearby Vok for communication. &quot;I have \n&gt; sent out a summoning emphatic and telepathing message to all \n&gt; Vok with in my range (which is large), as you have just witnessed.&quot; \n&gt; All three beings away a response with certainty.\n\n\n"}}
