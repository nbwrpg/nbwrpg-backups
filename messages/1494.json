The ship had made its unplanned \ndescent from the heavens and landed into a large sand dune, over looking the \nprecious and live giving Nile river. Around the ship was pockets of grass and \ntrees, also a few wild animals relaxed in the shade of a large oasis. :::\n\n::: Set got up from his burt control panel. He glanced to this right to see \nthe others unconscience, from what he could tell at least. He got up and \nwalked over to the main viewer. Despite its hairline cracks, he could make \nout where they were. Sighing, he made his way to a terminal and looked at the \ndamages. It wasnt good...but also they had saved alot of systems. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Damn asteriods....I wonder, perhaps if our ship wasnt there to \ntake the hits from the asteriods they might have struck the earth and \ndestroyed it. Hah....we may have just saved this rock!\n\n::: Quickly he went to Shuko and began to examine him. He began to shake him \n::: Wake up! Cmon....\n\n::: He paused to think a moment ::: I wonder if he left me in his \nwill.....how much is Shuko worth....?\n\n::: He chased away that thought and began to try and wake him agian. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: HELL BEAST, who had left the spider to rot in the lab went to the bridge. \nHe looked at the scanners and the new fallen ship :::\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Well....there goes the neighbor hood.\n\n::: BLACK ARACNIA ::: Now what?\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: We shall go and greet them. They are Predacons after all. \nJackle, lets go.\n\n::: HELL BEAST and JACKLE head out towrds the fallen ship ( what should we \nname it?) ::::\n\n~~~~~~~~``\n\n::: MEGATRON damaged beyond belife sputters across a shavana when he sees the \nship fall. :::\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: God Damn it.....this is all I need.\n\n::: He quickly heads to the crash :::\n\n"}}
