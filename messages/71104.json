I canno=\r\nt allow that to happen.=94\n\nTuscon=92s message came back over the channel .=\r\n . . \n\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, disregard that last request. But keep an eye on the cham=\r\nber, where the \n&gt; Autobots sleep. I have a feeling Nightrazor will indeed t=\r\nry to infiltrate it, and lay harm \n&gt; to those who are fallen.&quot;\n\n=93Gotcha!=\r\n=94 Rodimus said, the relief in his voice could be clearly heard over the s=\r\nound of Rodimus=92 revving motor in the background. =93I am in the chamber =\r\nnow on the way out.

Follow me...=94 \n&gt; \n&gt; After that Hydras attemped to ente=\r\nr the ARK!!!!\n\n\n\n&gt; Inside the Ark, Quickstride gets the message, and is swi=\r\nft to locate a manual control for\n&gt; the doors, and swiftly activates it by =\r\nslamming a palm against the main manual\n&gt; controller.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Read ya loud&#39;n c=\r\nlear Torca, I got it! No one&#39;s commn&#39; in or outa here unless they\n&gt; wanna r=\r\nisk their sorry afts ta do so.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then transforms into beast mode, and=\r\n rears up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I got more kick power in this mode. Hooves are geat defens=\r\ne weapons, &#39;specially when ya wanna strike a bot below the belt, if ya know=\r\n what I mean, Torca.\n&gt;\n&gt; He charges in beast mode toward his enemys, at a s=\r\ntrong trot and hefty snort.\n\n\nAs Quickstride and Leo II come running out of=\r\n the Ark, the door of which was beginning to lower, they could both see Hyd=\r\nras, followed by Cyclonus, Inferno and Waspinator flying directly at it! Po=\r\nwerful blasts from the Predacons, although carefully aimed so as to only hi=\r\nt Leo, Quickstride and Torca who was rushing over to try to hold the door, =\r\nmade if difficult to run across the field of fire!\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord O=\r\npened fire against  Deepstrike trying to impeding his entrance to the Ark. =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup cursed and keep firing at Scourge and the sweeps.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nScourge =\r\nwas truly a menace in the air, using his agility to out maneuver the more l=\r\nandbound Autobot. Kup was able to hit Scourge with a few glancing blows, bu=\r\nt Scourge was made of sterner stuff, and continued to rain down fire on Kup=\r\n. \n\nDeepstryke on the other hand was built like a tank. He was definitely N=\r\nOT built for manuverablity, but he was heavily armored. Like a cross betwee=\r\nn a gun emplacement and a satellite Deepstryke took a few hits from Windlor=\r\nd, but he kept returning fire with his powerful and precise cannons. Howeve=\r\nr for the moment Windlord seemed to be successful in keeping Deepstryke fro=\r\nm following Hydras towards the Ark! \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He [Tuscon] slams a foot =\r\ndown hard, and at the same time, lets loose another round of formidable son=\r\nar waves.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was no sound or movement in or near the room with T=\r\nuscon and Straight Shot, however there was a new wave of sparks that ran th=\r\nrough the Ark=92s systems as once again Tuscon=92s wave wreaks havoc. \n\nThe=\r\nre is no sign of the intruder with Tuscon, however a weak signal does appea=\r\nr in the front chamber, the very same chamber that held the font door, as w=\r\nell as the fallen Autobots and Decepticons! It would seem that the intruder=\r\n has used his time wisely and was attempting to make a fast get away!\n\nMean=\r\nwhile Hydras received a message from Deepstryke, =93Sir. I am detecting a w=\r\nave harmonic affect emanating from within the Ark.=94 Deepstryke was of cou=\r\nrse talking about the wave Tuscon was emimitting. =93Shall I attempt to cou=\r\nnter it?=94 \n\nMeanwhile back inside the Ark:\n\n&gt; Elita squeezed Ramulu=92s h=\r\nand and asaid quietly =93I want my mommie... I want her back\n&gt; as well as m=\r\ny dad=94\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=93I will get you to her as soon as I can. Come.=94 Romulu=\r\ns said. His voice was guff, unused to speaking to young Autobots. Turning t=\r\no look around for a moment he glanced back at Elita. =93We have to get you =\r\nto safety. =93Stay behind me.=94 He took off at a slow jog down one of the =\r\nside hallways, occasionally looking back to be sure that Elita was keeping =\r\nup. \n\nThen Romulus stopped as he came to be standing over two dark shapes l=\r\nying on the floor. =93Oh dear Primus!=94 he said. He looked back at Elita, =\r\nshock and fear in his optics, =93Stay back.
