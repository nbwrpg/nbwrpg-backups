As the dust cleared, she layed there. \nShe groaned and slowly got up.  Her side had a hole blown through \nit.  You could see right through her.  She stood onher wobbly legs \nand looked at Striker as he flew off. &quot;COWARD!&quot; She then looked at \nthe other bots.  She took a step forward and collapsed.  She was \nhaving trouble breathing and gasping for breath. Sparks flew out from \nthe wires that were showing.  She coughed and moved her front paw a \nlittle. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer growls in anger as more shots hit him, the Trainer stumbling \n&gt; and nearly losing his balance. The war suit was doing its best to \n&gt; protect him, but it couldn&#39;t take too much more. With a silent \n&gt; command from him, his cloaking device activates, Slayer \ndissapearing \n&gt; from view.\n&gt; \n&gt; He jumps into the air, his jetpack lifting him up as he shoots \n&gt; missile after missile at the bots on the ground.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus jumps to the side, a missile nearly hitting him.
