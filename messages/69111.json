I would never call anyone unneeded and in fact I was looking forward to interacting with your characters in upcoming scenes. Unfortunately I had already planned on doing what I did to Myrmidon before you had arrived, and I regret that had no other active characters in the area to keep anything going with you. :(\n\nPerhaps this is a lesson to us all. :(\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nWrom: MKHJYFMYXOEAIJJPHSCRTNHGSWZIDREXCAXZO\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, September 14, 2008 1:47:26 PM\nSubject: Taking my leave\n\n\nHi all,\n\nAs much as I had hoped that this story would work out, it&#39;s become\npretty clear to me that it&#39;s not.  At least not for me.  Between not\nknowing what&#39;s going and not being responded to, I feel like an\nunneeded fish out of water - or maybe an unneeded BW fan in a\npredominantly Transformers RP.  Not your guys&#39; fault that I don&#39;t know\nmy Transformers, nor is it your fault that I had other expectations. \nHowever, as a suggestion I wouldn&#39;t make it a habit of letting posts\ngo blatantly ignored for so long, especially when it comes to\nnewcomers who don&#39;t know what the heck they&#39;re doing ;)\n\nFeel free to write out Shard, or kill him off.  I&#39;ll just delete my\nMaul post since it went unanswered and won&#39;t be missed. \n\nI&#39;d like to thank Cyclonus for his help; I wouldn&#39;t have even made it\nthis far without him, and I enjoyed the interaction with Myrmidon\nwhile it lasted.  :)  Good luck to you all!\n\n    \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
