A pod was emitting a signal.  He looked at\n&gt; the ot=\r\nher bots he had been trapped with in that room.

Their names were Guardia, Ravenchief,\n&gt; and Salveo.  Together with =\r\nPerseus, they were the Pasificus Maximals.\n&gt; They lived on the island of At=\r\nlantis, and hoped to stay out of combat;\n&gt; however, they made sure to keep =\r\ntheir fighting skills sharp so that\n&gt; they would not be defenceless.  They =\r\nvowed not to use force unless\n&gt; they were defending themselves or a defence=\r\nless person.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but Ravenchief and Guardia=\r\n: you go and\n&gt; find out where this pod is.
