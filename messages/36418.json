AH!&quot; Whatever the drunk was going to say to Crossfire was cut short as Arty&#39;s blasts hit him in the back, almost slamming him into the wall. He spins around, his back dented, growling. Running toward Arty, the drunk fires two missiles at him.\n\n&quot;How much firepower can to take?&quot; he asks the shield while charging at Arty.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Arty had just gotten free when another slab was flopped on top of him. His\n&gt; servos were damaged so he couldn&#39;t find the leverage he needed to push it\n&gt; back off. He tried to aim his cannons knowing that he was as good as trapped\n&gt; but couldn&#39;t get an angle to aim at Pacifix. His eyes saw the drunk, his\n&gt; cannons turned and aimed, the tip started to glow and Arty fired both\n&gt; barrels at full power at the drunks back.\n\n\n"}}
