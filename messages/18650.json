The bot looked like he \nwas smelling something.. Striker growls, realizing that Lunarpine could smell \nhim. Not wasting anymore time, Slayer aims his gun, firing a missile at \nLunarpine.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHearing shots, Ramulus runs out of the Ark, grabbing a cloaking device on his \nway and activating it. He disappears (to the eye), running out of the Ark and \nfiring at where Koj had said Prebon was.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen rushes out of the base, cloaked once again. Seeing a few shots \nemerge out of nowhere (one of the Trainers&#39;), he fires at the spot, running \nto the edge of the clearing of the Ark so he could get some cover.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto flies out of the Ark, cloaking himself as he opens fire on where Koj \nhad said Prebon was.\n\n"}}
