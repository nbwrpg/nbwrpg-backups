She did some fancy wing \nmovements and dodged most of the ion disks, but one cut clean through \nthe center of her wing.  She started to drop in altitude and called \nZardus on her link. &quot;I&#39;m hit in the wing and will have to land.&quot;\n\nShe landed and transformed into bot mode. Her wings folded around her \nlike a cloak and leaking from the hole in the center of one wing.  \nShe drew her dagger and pistol and ran towards Archangle.  Her intnal \nsystems would have to repair her wing.  Sh ecould fly, but it would \ntear her wing apart if she did.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Arcangel/Depth Charge/Tigerhawk/Icedragon/Shocker\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Arcangel:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tigerhawk,Icedragon, and Shocker you take him me and Depth Charge \nwill take \n&gt; her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Arcangel fire 6 fireballs at Battera.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Depth Charge\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he fire five ion disks at her\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Tigerhawk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he fired a huge blast as big as Thrash at Thrash.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Icedragon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he fired two more stunning missles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shocker fired two missles at Thrash.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
