He hated the little worm. Ever scince he \njoined with Aracnia he had changed. The loyal little expendable soldier he \nonce knew was dead....this new Quickstrike was intelligent. And a soldier \nwith intelligence often caused trouble.\n    &quot;Its bots like you, roach, that are making the Predacon reunion so \ndifficult! I only want to help, you only want to cause trouble. How yo came \nto be Sub-Commander is beyond my comprehension. Yes.&quot; Megatron said as he \nlooked down from atop rampages shoulders.\n    Rampage entered the clearing that contained the ship. He could see \nInferno, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, Tankkor, Paralysis, and Black Aracnia \nstanding waiting for them. Most of them withdrew there guns at the sight of \nMegatron.\n    &quot;What do you think your doing?!?!?! That is the traitor!&quot; Inferno yelled, \ngoing into a fighting stance, his body ridged and flexed.\n    Megatron frowned. &quot;Tut tut my fellow commrads....I want to help yo-\n    Before he could get another word out, Inferno blasted his head off of his \nbody and sent in falling to the ground. Rampage then dropped his body.\n    &quot;Take him inside. we can remove his arms and legs...that way he wont hurt \nanything, or anyone. Come on troops, lets move in.&quot; Aracnia said ushering in \nher troops. \n    &quot;Anything wrong Quickstuff?&quot; She asked kindly, smileing....for once.\n\n"}}
