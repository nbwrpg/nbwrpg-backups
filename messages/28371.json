Inside, all \nthe eletors were making a few final preporations for battle. Cinder looked \naround at her family, seeing them all armed and ready to help the maximals. \nHer excitment was bubbling over, but she tried not to show it.\n\n&quot;Everyone ready?&quot; she heard Mantle ask. Cinder looked at him, nodding along \nwith her brothers and sisters. Mantle smiled at her. She knew that he could \nfeel what she was feeling. Mantle could feel the feelings and occasionally \nhear the thoughts of other bots. That was one of the traits that was built \ninto him to make him a good leader. She smiled back, trying to be less \nexcited.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll be there in 10 seconds, guys,&quot; Cyndro&#39;s voice informed them. Cinder \nslowly counted down from 10 in her mind, looking at the hatch that would \nsoon open so that they could fly out into action. Cinder hoped that they \nwould be there in time to help. She wanted to do well in this battle. After \nall, there was someone out there that she wanted to do well for... But she \nshouldn&#39;t think of that right now, not right before a battle.\n\n&quot;Lets do this like normal battles, but keep an ear open for any suggestions \nfrom me,&quot; Mantle said just as Cinder&#39;s mental countdown reached five. \nEveryone nodded, and five seconds later Cyndro&#39;s voice could be heard again:\n\n&quot;We&#39;re here! Good luck, guys!&quot;\n\nThe Element zoomed into the African plains, the grass bending as it passed, \nand stopped 200 feet from the Cybertronian Fire. The brand new ship was a \nbeauty outside. It was mostly oval-shaped, with a flat bottom and a flat \nback where the engines were attached to it. There were weapons and different \nhatches on the outside. The weapons were (yan helped me out by telling me \nwhat weapons are on the planet right now, so this is partly his work too) \nmissile launchers, autoguns, and EMP cannons (I&#39;m not exactly sure what \nthose are, but they&#39;re there :). There were two big cannons on either side \nof the Element, which could fire very strong plasma shots at enemies. There \nwas also a small disk on the top that could target robots and shoot \nconcintrated sonic waves at them. It could also be switched to transit \nunbearebly loud beeps over the comm, which would stop attackers from \ncomminicating with each other (my little invention :). The ship was designed \nfor fighting in space, so its weapons were powerful. Around the ship, about \n20 feet from the sides, was the shield, a thick wall of protective energy.\n\nCinder&#39;s heart was pounding as she watched the hatch open and her family \nexit through it. She was finally going to fight! She exited behind everyone \nelse, and then took off at a run toward battle. Cinder reached into her hip \ncompartment, taking out a large pistol and firing it at the first enemy that \nshe saw, which was Deamon Wolf. Out of the corner of her eyes, she could see \nRubble running near her and aiming a missile launcher at Dark Claw. He \npulled the trigger and a missile shot out, heading quickly toward its \ntarget. Aqua ran on the other side of Cinder. His spear gun was aimed at \nFlesh Ripper and several spears were flying out of it toward the meanie. \nMist flew overhead, her charge launcher (it launches small explosives, like \nthe ones Rattrap used) out. She aimed at Astroblast as she got within range, \nfiring two charges at him. Mantle was flying beside her, his arms stretched \nout. Two missiles flew out of each arm, mentally guided by him toward \nMenasor. Shadows passed over all the Eletors as missiles and lasers shot by \nCyndro flew out toward any attacking bots.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
