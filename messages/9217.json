So, this was going to be her new home. It looked rugged, and \ntoo unorganized to be Predacon worthy. What she didn&#39;t like was the \nthought of the little snake-bot being the leader of them. It just \ndidn&#39;t settle down in her mind right. He had a harem, or those two \nfemales just favored him. She hoped they were because she wasn&#39;t \ngoing to be a part of it. \n\nShe looked over and saw KitKat in the distance. She listened in. She \nwas looking for Rowdy Wolf. She walked closer until she was close \nenough for her to reach her mind. \n\n&quot;You won&#39;t find him,&quot; she said to her. &quot;He is what your little snake-\nbot would have become.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
