At the moment, you didn&#39;t post for\n&gt; dodging Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; attack, Sunhawk grabbed Megatron and put him into a\n&gt; headlock, and \n&gt; then turned him around to face Kup&#39;s weaponfire.\n&gt; THAT is what&#39;s \n&gt; wrong. You should be posting that Sunhawks tries to\n&gt; grab Megatron to \n&gt; put him into a headlock, not that he suddenly has\n&gt; him in a headlock. \n&gt; =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cause talking ooc style is delaying Megatron, I&#39;m\n&gt; going to just go \n&gt; with that you&#39;ve done. I&#39;m not sure that Azure wants\n&gt; Warhead dead, \n&gt; so Megatron is going to just try to run with\n&gt; Warhead. Heh, he&#39;s got \n&gt; the whole maximal base running him down right now\n&gt; eh. =P\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Megatron --\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s axe swishes harmlessly past Sunhawk&#39;s\n&gt; side. The over \n&gt; powered swing allows Sunhawk to grapple him, and get\n&gt; him into a \n&gt; headlock.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hah, a headlock?!&quot; Megatron gets hit by one of\n&gt; Kup&#39;s shots, a char \n&gt; mark appears on his back armour, then he grabs for\n&gt; Sunhawk&#39;s legs, \n&gt; attempting to try to throw him at Kup, along with a\n&gt; plasma blast. \n&gt; (he&#39;s going to throw Sunhawk and try to hit him with\n&gt; a plasma blast \n&gt; after the throw)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s how I like to do it.
