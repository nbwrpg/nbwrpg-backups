Tripredacus was only three bots, WarMachine is\n&gt; five. Besides, Rampage was 12 feet tall. If you&#39;re saying Shockaract\n&gt; is that high, he&#39;d be about four times as small as WarMachine (who&#39;s\n&gt; over 45 feet tall). If you want Shockaract to be nearly as bit (even\n&gt; not nearly as big, say 20 feet), that would be breaking the giant bot\n&gt; rule. Gestalts are giant, but they&#39;re five bots, not one, and were\n&gt; aprooved back in March or April.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::WarMachine::\n&gt;\n&gt; WarMachine laughs, bringing up an arm to absorb the shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t hope to defeat me, fool!&quot; he yells, firing from his\n&gt; shoulder missile launchers at Shockaract, several dozen machine gun\n&gt; shots accompanying the two missiles.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Shokaract, up to a new gestalt from beast wars, would only be\n&gt; a very\n&gt; &gt; small amount smaller, take a look at Rampage compared to\n&gt; Tripredacus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC: Shokaract looked in the direction of the firepower as it\n&gt; shipped his\n&gt; &gt; armor rapidly.
