The base creaked from non use and\n&gt;ignorement. he was disgusted by it. If his master had been here he would\n&gt;have never let it happen. The body was almost complete. It now only needed\n&gt;its fule. The blood of a few hero bots to bring it to full power. He felt \n&gt;the\n&gt;dark spark&#39;s precense. &quot;Its almost ready master. Do you wish to have all \n&gt;the\n&gt;weapons you had before?&quot; The dark sent a obvious yes to the bots frightened\n&gt;face. The dark spark pulsed over and over. He would soon be back and he \n&gt;would\n&gt;set fire to the entire world if he had to to bring about his enemies. But\n&gt;first he had to make a few allies. Brother Megatron had already been\n&gt;contacted. But another one he would soon need to speak with was Zardus. he\n&gt;sent a typed message to his opticals. For he yet to have form so a visual\n&gt;seems impossible. The typed message would read. &quot;Great leader of the\n&gt;alliance. I have never met you in person but we have spoken. I have long \n&gt;been\n&gt;very impressed by your skills as a leader. But defending the maximals I was\n&gt;quite surprised by that. Non the less I am very interested to work with \n&gt;you.\n&gt;Unfortunatly I am not complete but I will be soon. I will contact you then.\n&gt;Until then good luck.&quot; The message ended and the dark spark waited for his\n&gt;body to be finished. For when it was the world would never be the same \n&gt;again\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
