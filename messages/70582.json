So much=\r\n so that he found himself tearing a bit from both eyes.  Straight Shot was =\r\nalso showing tears in her eyes, as she holds Rat Trap&#39;s hand in support.  S=\r\nhe could also see that Silverbolt was also pouring his heart out for Tucson=\r\n and Rodimus to pull through, and with her free hand, she gently puts it in=\r\nto Silverbolts.\n\n&quot; If there&#39;s one thing Tucson Prime told us that I&#39;ll reme=\r\nmber always, is the fact that we have something that no Predacon or Decepti=\r\ncon, or Unicronian will ever possess.  A power so simple yet so powerful th=\r\nat only those with pure hearts possess it.  You&#39;re feeling it too, you have=\r\n that power, we all do.  We just gotta tap into it, and let it be felt by T=\r\nucson and Rodimus Prime.  If they can feel that we&#39;re pulling for them, the=\r\ny&#39;ll find the strength to make it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap smiles back to them.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s =\r\nright Silverbolt, we can do this, we got what it takes, it&#39;s in our hearts,=\r\n and no one can take that away from us, no one.  But if Wheels&#39;n Speedy are=\r\n gonna make it, we gotta show them that our hearts are pulln&#39; for them all =\r\nthe way.  See?  Every time we put our hearts inta them, that light pulsing =\r\nin Wheels, it gets brighter&#39;n brighter. He knows  guys, he knows we&#39;re pull=\r\nn&#39; for &#39;em.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot; Oh yeah, I&#39;m just noticing that now.  H=\r\ne knows we&#39;re pulln&#39; for &#39;em all right, he can feel our energy commn&#39; taget=\r\nher.  We might not know that we&#39;re radiatn&#39; somethn&#39; out at &#39;em, but he sur=\r\ne does.&quot;\n\nWith every hope poured into Tucson&#39;s success in recovering Rodimu=\r\ns, his chest glows brighter and brighter with each pulsation.  It&#39;s as if h=\r\ne could actually channel the energy put out by his comrades in a spiritual =\r\nsense of being.  And on the table, even in slumber he lets them know just h=\r\now he feels about their support.  He wispers.\n\n&quot; I - will - not fail you.&quot;\n=\r\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Silverbolt stood and watched as Nightshift, Elita and the others\n&gt; pour=\r\ned out thier hearts out over Rodimus.
