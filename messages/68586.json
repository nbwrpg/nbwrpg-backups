Before the smoke cleared, he swung\n&gt; &gt; his chain swo=\r\nrd at Myrmidon and fired at perceptor with his \nrifle. \n&gt; &gt; When the smoke =\r\nthinned enough, one could see the damage visibly\n&gt; &gt; repairing itself.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heh, that felt kinda good.

He=\r\n knew Malice to be a more formidable fighter than he had \nlet\n&gt; on . . . bu=\r\nt then again so was Myrmidon. Myrmidon had only hit him \nwith\n&gt; enough forc=\r\ne to set him back, testing the durability of this \nopponant.\n&gt; The fact tha=\r\nt Malice had been able to absorb the energy from the\n&gt; shielding was not lo=\r\nst on him as he moved to the side, the swooshing\n&gt; noise from inside the sm=\r\noke told him that swinging.
