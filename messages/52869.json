Anyway, here I am, back once \n&gt; more. Crawling back has become typical of me. Well, this time I&#39;m \n&gt; back for a few reasons. They are below if any of you want to read. I \n&gt; doubt you do, but this is my post and I will type what I want to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1: nWo is 4 life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2: Azure wrote me this pretty little letter and cheered me up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3: Rudra didn&#39;t respond to my teasing RPG posts and I wasn&#39;t \nhaving \n&gt; fun anymore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4: Cardhead didn&#39;t reply to the Boogerman post. Thanks, buddy!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5: Saliva&#39;s &quot;Always&quot; is awesome. That&#39;s not a reason, but I \nbelieve \n&gt; it to be fact.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6: This RPG can&#39;t live without me. Don&#39;t say it can, because I \nlike \n&gt; to think it can&#39;t. Shut up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7: Wrestlers shouldn&#39;t get so mad. If I got any madder I&#39;d be like \n&gt; HHH, and that&#39;s definitely not a good thing. I have to make it to \n&gt; reason 8 I can say I have a Megaman total. (GEEK ALERT)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8: I like wasting the time of the innocent with worthless posts \n&gt; like these. Yeah, I wasted your time if you read down this far. Oh, \n&gt; not quite. There&#39;s a reward for your patience provided you did not \n&gt; click delete as you read this. It&#39;s 1 million dollars plus a bomb. \n&gt; Oh, never mind. I&#39;m sorry, people, this post was my cry for \n&gt; attention! It&#39;s because I don&#39;t know how to say that NBW is part of \n&gt; who I am now, despite all of the random outbursts of rage. Oops, I \n&gt; guess I just did. I&#39;m high on no-sleep right now, forgive this shit. \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mr. Mister Zeeryo\n\n\n"}}
