As quick as he came, he \nfled with the box. Son he reached his base and entered through a secure \npassage. He entered the holding cell to see Ra pacing the corridor and \nlooking att he Predacons. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Wake Megatron. I have his box.\n\n::: Ra opens the cage and kicks megatron in his side. The proto-form awakes \nand takes the Tech box. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Ah, at last. Now you will get whats coming to you, yes.\n\n::: He entered a nearby stasis pod that was empty. After a few moments and \nseveral computer commands, he emerged in a purple transmetal 2 \nt-rex form. :::\n\n::: Megatron laughed ::: Ah, excellent.\n\n::: set looked at Megatron&#39;s arm as it was covered by his beast mode tail, \nand noticed it was slowly lighting up...:::\n\n:: Set ::: Now, are you going to-\n\n::: A blast shot out from the tail, it sent Set flying across the room. \nMegatron turned to Ra, who was standing behinde the counsol. He blew apart \nthe computers engulfing Ra in flames. :::\n\n::: Hell Beasts cell opened with the destruction of the computers. Jackle \nburst out and went to a supply closet where there wepons were kept. Soon, the \nthree Predacons were armed and ready to move. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: I suggest we work together for the moment...these new \narrivals seem to be quite menacing to both our teams.\n\n::: Megatron ::: we have no other choice. And with the Allience working with \nyou....we will crush them and the Maximals!\n\n::: Hell Beast sighed ::: Lets move.\n\n::: They ran for the door, only to find several battle droid like soldiers \nguarding it. They began to fire at the three predacons. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: They will be no problem! jackle, go ahead and clear a path \nfor us!\n\n:::: Jackle did so, and the predacons burst down the hallway until they came \nto the exit. :::\n\n::: Ra, smoldering with ash and smoke ran down the hall, his hands engulfed \nin flames ready to burn the escapies. Set was close behinde sounding an alarm \n:::\n\n::: Megatron worked at the control panel for a moment, and the door slid \nupward. Jackle squeezed under it and opened it the rest of the way. The two \nlarger bots managed through and shut it behinde them. MEgatron, Hell Beast, \nand Jackle took off as saft as they could go towrds the Predacon base. :::\n\n::: Set slamed the door and turned to look at the battle droids ::: DOnt just \nstand there! Ra, take an assult team of batle droids and destroy them and \nthere base! No one crosses me!\n\n::: Ra nodded, and with a dozen battle droids behinde him he left for the \nPredacon base. Set then went to see Shuko. If he could, he would send the \nother dieties to the Predacon base, and there they would form Dark Messhia \nand finally show these savages who they were dealing with! :::\n\n"}}
