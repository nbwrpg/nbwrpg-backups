We&#39;re done\n&gt; here for now.&quot; His wrist beeps. He looks down and sees the alliance\n&gt; base reporting that there was activity at the pred base.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The predacons are probably going to attack again. They can carry on\n&gt; here. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Zardus sends the tranmission and fires several shots\n&gt; at Teltoli, waiting for the alliance to finish up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *--- FREE VOICEMAIL FOR YOUR HOME PHONE! ---*\n&gt; With eVoice Now you can keep in touch with clients, vendors, co-workers,\n&gt; friends and family ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
