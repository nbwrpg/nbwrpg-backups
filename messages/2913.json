He walks off\n&gt; after her but also stops as he hears the predacon&#39;s transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl looks at Iron Raptor as she begins her sentence about backstabing\nbots,\n&gt; but doesn&#39;t catch the last several words as Iron Raptor nearly fell in\npain.\n&gt; He walks up to her, passing Plintissa.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I think I should carry you to the CR chambers,&quot; he says, his concern\nclearly\n&gt; written in his eyes and heard in his voice as he puts out a hand to steady\n&gt; her. From the look she had in her eyes earlier, he wasn&#39;t sure wether to\ntake\n&gt; her to the CR chambers or her quarters.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker sits down in the war room, waiting for the meeting to begin when\nhe\n&gt; hears shots outside. He growls, taking out his gun and running toward the\n&gt; shots.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus shruggs, not knowing the answer to Ramhorn&#39;s questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have no idea. Last thing I remember was being shot by predacons,&quot; he\nsays,\n&gt; &quot;And then I woke up in a CR chamber.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Remember Father&#39;s Day Is June 18th\n&gt; Click Here For Great Gifts!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5037/10/_/_/_/960413700/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
