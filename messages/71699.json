Something was happening and she had the\n&gt; feeling that Leo Prime and Lord Elder didnt like to told her. After that \n&gt; she\n&gt; would move towards an empty quaters, she didnt know where was her place in\n&gt; the ark, no time to took one since she has arrived. she didnt like to \n&gt; admit\n&gt; that she felt slighty tired and also she needed to sit down and think what \n&gt; to do next.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s starting show the craws&quot; commented Perceptor &quot;It was time&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do you have something to do with that Perceptor?&quot; said Windlord, who\n&gt; arrived shortly after Nightligh left\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I didnt have any hand in what happened here... or with Rodimus&quot;replied\n&gt; camly\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME walked NIGHTLIGHT to the door, tryinto be as comforting as\npossible, his optics kept in a kindly light and his arm on her\nshoulder consoling. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we will let you know what&#39;s\nhappening as soon as we know.&quot;\n\nAs NIGHTLIGHT left the room and tried to hang around to listen LEO\nwalked back into the room, his optics on PERCEPTOR and WINDLORD and\nthen finally LORD ELDER.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right Perceptor.&quot; LORD ELDER said finally. &quot;She is starting to\nshow her claws, and she has a right to. Her husband and child are\nmissing, she herself was captured. Any of us would react the same.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded, &quot;You&#39;re right. But now what?&quot;\n\n&quot;She has training as a Scout.&quot; LEGACY interjected. &quot;It is unknown if\nher skill set will lend itself to this endevor.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER looked over at WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR, &quot;We don&#39;t think\nanyone here has done anything to start this, but if anyone has any\nsuggestions, the floor is open.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded in a agreement. The look on his face saying he was\nnot happy with the prospects.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
