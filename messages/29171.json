I have something else for you to do as well.&quot; He says, \ndata downloading into a datapad from his datatracks. &quot;Can you build a \nsmall repair/recharge station on the island? You can use the CR \nchambers and other materials from the old Alliance base. Have the \nLavacons help you build, they&#39;re available right now.&quot;\n\nHe tosses the datapad to Wheeljack. On it were the basic specs, plus \nthe places in the old Alliance base where he could get the CRs. The \nstation was designed to be a quick recharge point during defensive \nbattles. It was easilly accessable, and would be powered directly from \nthe old Alliance base. &quot;Those are the specs and other info. Do you \nthink you can do it?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Banzai-Tron:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::He finds Zardus::\n&gt; Wheeljack: Zardus, sir.\n&gt; ::he salutes::\n&gt; Wheeljack: Composer and i are pleased to tell you that the new \ndefenses are a \n&gt; success.
