I really doubt I&#39;ll have time to post, \n&gt;though I will have internet access so I might drop in for a little while. \n&gt;I&#39;ve been preparing my laptop for a hacker war, wish me luck :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyways, I&#39;ll split my chars among people a bit. Here&#39;s who gets who until \n&gt;Monday (if its ok with them to control those bots till then).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Robo - Cledar, Rixer, Forrior, Blyer, Firearm (have them go to the battle \n&gt;to help the Chivtrons. Here&#39;s your chance to make HotRod look competent for \n&gt;a change) :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hedge - DevilDuer (don&#39;t make him act _too_ stupid).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Gunthers - Dion\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Megan - Prowl, Cyndro.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;ll go into effect tomorrow. I&#39;m not sure if I can post today, but I&#39;ll \n&gt;try.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
