Sorry. And to CODE, worry about your own \ncharacters and not other peoples for a change.)\n\n* Carnage growled as she crouched low in the grass surrounding the Maximal \nbase, she was only a few metres from Scourge and some other bot right now \nbut her real goal was to get into the middle of the battle and not it&#39;s \nfringes. She looked behind her and saw Cyber Claw, it would be harder for \nthe clone to get into the base and into a CR chamber now that there was a \nshield up.\nCarnage crept past Scourge and began to make her way deeper into the battle, \nbeing hidden by the long grass was an actual advantage for her since she was \nnow picking out a suitable target.\nSuddenly she spotted one!\nIt was a Predacon, didn&#39;t look too bright but a dumb look sometimes hid a \nclever bot indeed!\nShe crept up to him and waited in the long grass for him to mosy on by, to \nher it almost seemed like a drone. (Tankoor)\nCarnage waited in the grass, just a little bit closer!*\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n* Dinobot watched as the charges from his rifle punctured the ventilation \nshaft, he was disappointed that he never hit his target but he had a lot \nmore charges where that came from!\nHe looked at the moving signature of his enemy as it moved towards the \nbridge, it was an advantage that if a bot had lost sight of his enemy he \ncould always count on locating it&#39;s signature.\nDinobot snarled as he slammed a new charge cartridge into the loading bay of \nthe rifle after taking out the old one, the empty charge cart clattered to \nthe floor as he continued to follow hie target throughout the ship. He aimed \nthe rifle just ahead of the signature and let a mirage of charges go, he \nsmiled to himself as they punctured the vent.\nNow he meant buisness!*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
