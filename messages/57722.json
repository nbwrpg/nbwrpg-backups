As I said, this might not please you very \nmuch, but neither am I hot to the idea. I was sent here to get you, \nalive or dead. What I suggest is that you leave, in exile. You can \nstill have contacts with your crew, which I do not necessarily wish \nto see evicted, but the main thing is that you are not on Earth \nanymore. We will not chase you or anything, unless you come back. If \nyou wish, you can negotiate to accomodate yourself.\n\nDreadplague looked at Tyrael with a struck air, then at Darkangel. \nHer voice came out so low that only her fellow warrior could hear her.\n\nDread: Is he crazy?
