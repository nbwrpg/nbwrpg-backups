He barely escaped Skulletron&#39;s missile, but managed it \nnonetheless.\n\nHe opened a commline to the newcomers, deciding any help was better \nthan a stand alone at that time.\n\nTyrael: I am Major Tyrael and I am in charge. Report your names, \nplease.\n\nThe hits he had landed on Skulletron were a good start, and he \nintended to go on. However, he saw the falling pod.\n\nTyrael: Womanbot, hold out. Get to that pod and secure it for the \nTripredacus! Here, insert that in it!\n\nHe throws a Tripredacus programming chip at her. He looked at the \nshield&#39;s gauge and saw it had dropped yet again... 80 - no - 79%, and \nstill falling. He slashed twice again at Skulletron and, turning back \na little, sent a massive light bolt at Proto.\n\nEven before he had started to fire on him, Vlad realized Waspinator \nhad been hit hard. He was not an immediate threat.\n\nVlad: Greetings, Major Tyrael. I am Khan Vladimir Ward of Clan Wolf. I \nwill assist your Tripredacus.\n\nHe switched targets to Inferno and launched all mini-missiles on the \nant.\n\n\n"}}
