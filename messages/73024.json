LEO!   S=\r\nURROUND RODIMUS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; AND DETAIN HIM!  BIG CONVOY, I NEED YOU TO SECURE =\r\nNIGHTLIGHT!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; MAXIMALS, PREDACONS, OPERATION STORM, NOW!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\nlt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY, along with the rest of the MA=\r\nXIMALS quickly&lt;br&gt;\nmoved down the center of the room as well, allowing TUSC=\r\nON to take the&lt;br&gt;\nlead at the moment.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; VICE GRIP had fallen in over behind CRYOTEK, ready over to assist i=\r\nn a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; flanking position as they came face to face over with MAGMATRO=\r\nN and what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; seemed to be..  OPTIMUS PRIME.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DINOBO=\r\nT was ahead and over to flank, and while still etnirely confused -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n OPTIMUS was still aboard the ARK, and it was supposed to be impossible to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; clone sparks forged from the MATRIX, he held back over and waited =\r\nto attack.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Let the MAXIMALS weaken themselves first after all, an=\r\nd then charge in!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So now, the duo of PREDACONS watied lik=\r\ne stooges over for the orders to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; attack, ready to rush forwards an=\r\nd gut anything in their path!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwhile the other PREDACONS looked=\r\n at TUSCON and then at CRYOTEK and&lt;br&gt;\nSKY SHADOW.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Who does that =\r\nTuscon think he is?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the FUZORS said.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;He doesn&#39;t rule=\r\n here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;No!&quot; CRYOTEK said. &quot;But I do, and I want Optimus Prime de=\r\nad! Now Move!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith that the PREDACONS also took to the air and ra=\r\nn along the ground,&lt;br&gt;\nrunning along with TUSCON but having a very differe=\r\nnt objective in&lt;br&gt;\nmind.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe water flowed down the center of the =\r\nvast chamber, finding the&lt;br&gt;\noriginal channel it had once possesed. At fir=\r\nst it was a walkl of&lt;br&gt;\nwater, then a break as it filled out and then it w=\r\nas a powerful font&lt;br&gt;\nof water that ran swiftly towards its goal.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nHowever before it reached the pillar of fire like energy it bisected,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nsplitting into two streams and began to flow around it. It had made&lt;br&gt;\ncon=\r\ntact with a shield, a shield which for the moment protected&lt;br&gt;\nMAGMATRON, =\r\nSABERBACK and DARK RODIMUS as well as other SHARKTICONS&lt;br&gt;\nthat were spill=\r\ning out from the cave opening near to their location.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDARK RODIMUS=\r\n looked up at TUSCON and the others and laughed as he&lt;br&gt;\nspoke to SABERBAC=\r\nK and MAGMATRON. &quot;There is no reason to worry, that&lt;br&gt;\nbungling idiot TUSC=\r\nON, he couldn&#39;t fight his way out of a paper bag.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the same tim=\r\ne others of MAGMATRON&#39;s troops began to appear,&lt;br&gt;\ndinosaur like troops of=\r\n all shapes and numbers. And MAGMATRON himself&lt;br&gt;\nlooked as if he had grow=\r\nn to nearly twice his size. He was standing&lt;br&gt;\nnealy a full 20&#39; tall!&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe laughed as well! &quot;You have come to your doom!&quot; His voive echoed&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nabout the vast chamber.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis was not going to be easy at all.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- e=\r\nnd group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-A007478D-B31F-4448-94E6-5C74F4FB370D--\r\n\n"}}
