[beast \nmachines cheetor.] he was not doing to well. Angel Prime was not sure which \nwas the lost one. the predcon and or maximal. then both gave up the fight. \nthey both fell down dying. the predcon died first. Angel Prime walked over \nto cheetor bending over looking down at him.\n\n\n\nAngel Prime:\n\n\n\n&quot;so you must be Cheetor. I got a question for you. you can join me and \nsearch for the rest of the lost ones or you can go back to the beast wars. I \nam not going to let you die here so your choice?&quot;\n\n\nCheetor:\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;give me another shot at killing megatron. I will take it. just things must \nbe new so ok.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nAngel Prime throws a little ball on Cheetors chest and he starts to change \ninto a TM3 body. his eys turn green he turns to his beast mode cause he can \nnot yet control the new body. Cheetor then goes threw a portal. back on past \nearth thuder starts to form around the cf as three lighting bolts hit in the \nmiddle of what once was a battle field infront of the CF Cheetor walks threw \nthe portal and looks around at all the new faces. then he yells out.\n\n\n\nCheetor:\n\n\n&quot;who is the leader around here?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nAngel Prime then leaves the future and starts heading to the past to find \nsomeone of the lost ones. he has no control of where he is going. but \nwhatever caused him to be able to do is not ready to stop.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
