But we are not doing this \nto \n&gt;   kill Deemos. IF, and only if, we have to kill him it must be done \nin \n&gt;   self defense.  We also will have no arguing over who to kills \nhim, \n&gt;   like barbarians.  Aerotaur, Sarge.  You two will share leadership \nin \n&gt;   the attack.  You will learn teamwork.  You will also both train \n&gt;   Trinity, Aerotaur because you know her, and Sarge, because you \n&gt;   don&#39;t. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   As Birdbot and Papertron flew in he felt the vibrations as \nBirdbot \n&gt;   flew at Trinity and Papertron aiming at her.  With a snap of \neither \n&gt;   wrists two whips flew out made of pure energon. One at Birdbots \nleg \n&gt;   to try and grab it and another at the weapon Papertron was \n&gt;   holding.  &quot;Thank you for coming you two.  They are your \nresponsibilyt \n&gt;   Sarge, don&#39;t forget that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Nightlight/Trinity/Windlord::\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &quot;What?&quot; said Nightlight&#39;s shocked.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Will you teach me  to fight, Uncle Aerotaur?&quot; said happily \n&gt;   &gt; Trinity &quot;Yoooohoooo!!!!&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Are you sure that it&#39;s good idea???&quot; said Nightlight to \nAerotaur.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &quot;I can&#39;t see other way&quot;replied Windlord..\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Trinity was jumping around happily and when she see Parpertron \nshe \n&gt;   &gt; said &quot;What&#39;s happen with you friend ? &quot; she looked to \nPartpertron \n&gt;   and \n&gt;   &gt; she said &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Orchid with what thing Papertron are aimming Trinity?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
