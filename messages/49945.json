We have stayed here long enough. I say \nwe go and explore our surroundings.\n\nThe large mech-robot looked at her, grinning as if he was amused by \nsomething.\n\nRagnar: You do remember the basics when you are lost, quiaff? Stay at \nthe same place until rescue comes.\n\nShe turned her face, the wolf mask placing itself to form a \nbreastplate. Her face was that of a very attractive and beautiful \nwoman, and it seemed that the transformation had not erased the straw \ncolor of her hair.\n\nKatya: Aff, I do.

The vegetation is not the \nsame, the landscape is unfamiliar, there is only one moon.
