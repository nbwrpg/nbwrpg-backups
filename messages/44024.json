They also didn&#39;t make Airazor\n&gt; into a Transmetal, in fact, they cancelled her and\n&gt; Tigatron out of the show. Well, at least they made\n&gt; them into Transmetal 2&#39;s later (Tigerhawk), They did\n&gt; a similar thing with Dinobot, even though he didn&#39;t\n&gt; act anything like the old Dinobot, and his plot was\n&gt; kind of cheesy. Scorponok got ripped off no matter\n&gt; which way you look at it. And Tankor isn&#39;t a\n&gt; Transmetal, either. As for the call out attacks,\n&gt; thing, that&#39;s just something that they do in\n&gt; Anime...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: dewboy30816@... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 4:44 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: 2\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   But didn&#39;t the robots Transform into Robots in\n&gt; Gobots. Doug also said \n&gt;   that it was a ripoff of Transformers. And who here\n&gt; thinks it was \n&gt;   stupid to make everyone except Rhinox a Transmetal\n&gt; (unless you count \n&gt;   Tankor)? Also wasn&#39;t stupid the way in Robots in\n&gt; Disguise they call \n&gt;   out there attacks (the only problem with the\n&gt; show)?\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Once again, no.  Beast Wars is an\n&gt; American/Canadian creation, \n&gt;   from \n&gt;   &gt; Mainframe Entertainment. Same thing goes for\n&gt; Beast Machines.  Your \n&gt;   cousins \n&gt;   &gt; boyfriend probably mistook Silverbolt for\n&gt; someone else since he has \n&gt;   never \n&gt;   &gt; been in command.  Robots in Disguise originated\n&gt; in Japan, being the \n&gt;   only \n&gt;   &gt; Japanese Transformers series so far to come to\n&gt; our shores. Gobots is \n&gt;   &gt; COMPLETELY UNRELATED to Transformers.  It was a\n&gt; rival show and \n&gt;   toyline in the \n&gt;   &gt; 80s, but Transformers was infinitely more\n&gt; popular(and better).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
