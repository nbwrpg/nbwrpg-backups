Cutie entered the area that would later be Augusta \n&gt; Georgia (I don&#39;t want you to know exactly where I live now do I). He \n&gt; then laid down clutching a small disk close to his heart. It showed \na \n&gt; press conference with Optimus Prime after they arrived back on \n&gt; Cybertron. He didn&#39;t care his shuttle had crashed. This was the \nright \n&gt; planet, he had been going for the 20th-21st century but when didn&#39;t \n&gt; matter. Optimus had spoken for 4 mega cycles. He mentioned several \n&gt; Earth legends. Among them was the fountain of youth. After finding \nthe \n&gt; disk Cutie had worked for 10 stellar cycles to find out where Earth \n&gt; was. Now he could find the fountain of youth (one of the few known \n&gt; legends with no known root in true history or nature) and pray it \n&gt; worked on bots.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: If you want to complain cutties stupid talk to whoever came up \n&gt; with Bob first.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is it my fault my superior intellect (this is the way\n&gt; &gt; I talk when I don&#39;t have time to think out what I say\n&gt; &gt; which is pretty much whenever I&#39;m not typing) I have\n&gt; &gt; gained extreme amounts of imagination, and hense\n&gt; &gt; impationse with such things as rpgs.
