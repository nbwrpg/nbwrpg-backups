The insane bot had forgotten where his quarters \nwere located, so he was wandering the base in search of them. His eyes widen \nas he sees an air vent cover replace itself.\n\n&quot;GHOSTS!!&quot; he yells, grabbing DeathStorm&#39;s head off his own and running back \nthe way he came in terror.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl frowns as Dinobot bats aside his arm, then backing up in the vent so \nthe other bot won&#39;t accidently crash into him. Prowl chuckles as he hears the \nyell from Scattershot.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s just hope the idiot wouldn&#39;t bring the others to view these &#39;ghosts&#39;. \nThey&#39;re not all as dumb as he is.&quot;\n\nProwl crawls down the vent, stopping at the other side. He looks through the \ncover, some sort of shelf set obscuring his sight of the bots inside.\n\n&quot;Once we&#39;re in, we need to take out the rest of the bots. Do it silently, if \nthey sound the alarm, we&#39;re dead,&quot; he says through his silencer.\n\n&quot;Ready?&quot; Prowl waits for a responce from Dinobot, ready to open the vent and \njump down into the torture chambers.\n\n"}}
