Myrmidon glanced at Trelos\n&gt; noting that he had no intention of stopping. Myrmidon could only hope\n&gt; that Hydras would see this and reign him in, he had other things to\n&gt; worry about, like dealing with this intruder.\n&gt;\n&gt; He shifted only slightly as the warning shots came from the intruder,\n&gt; he ignored them as he began speaking once more. &quot;NO! It is you who do\n&gt; not understand the peril you are in.&quot; Myrmidon&#39;s voice is smooth, deep\n&gt; and authoritative, the sound of a warrior, one who is loosing patience.\n&gt; &quot;You will collect no bounty here without the concent of Hydras MASTER\n&gt; of this base!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Myrmidon shifted slighty as he spoke, lining up on Malice yet keeping\n&gt; the base behind him, &quot;You will either stand before him or you fall\n&gt; before us! The choice is yours!&quot; Myrmidon smiled slightly as he was\n&gt; ready for battle, and almost hoped that this intruder would refuse, his\n&gt; clawed hands opened and closed, eager to begin!\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Remember, Myrmidon is floating.
