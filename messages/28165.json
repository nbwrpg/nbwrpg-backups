But thier journey had not been\n&gt; uneventful, due to an unplanned fight on board with the former crew, the\n&gt; ship was noe plummeting towards the earth.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Upon re-entry the air around the ship&#39;s hull burst into flames, giving\nthe\n&gt; ship an image of a giant fireball heading towards the ground. Screaming\nover\n&gt; the souther sky, Razorclaw was at least able to adjust course to land them\n&gt; in the water.   The co-ordinates showed that they would be landing close\nto\n&gt; what would be called the Azores Islands.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
