A\ndragon, scaled to the jaw, armored on every inch of his scaled body. Megaton\nflew sharply through the sky like a living mountain. Bringing dust and\ndisaster in his wake he rushed toward his destiny.\n\nThe great beast came to a cloudy stop as his enormous spiked wings raised\nthe sand around him. He was the creature that made the Earth tremble as he\naproached. He tipped his head to the ground, smiling his cunning tyranical\ngrin that obviously came from Megatrons influence. He sniffed the ground\nfinding a familiar scent. He smelled his donor. The bot was through the area\nnot to long ago. The dragon was intrigued so he decided to follow the trail.\n\n\n\n"}}
