With the keyboard she shut the hatch, (which wasnt open and you \nreally should check next time instead of the elaborate mode you just did.) \nand sealed the four Maximals in the ship.\n    &quot;Now, they will pay for there actions! Examples must be made of them. \nComputer, activate a force feild around sector 9 in the main corridor in \nfront of the hatch. That will contain them.&quot; She hissed, glareing at her \nscanners and diagnostics.\n    The computer did so, and trapped the four maximals in the sector. Then, \nwith the command from Aracnia, the Nerve gas was pumped inside the force \nfeild where the Maximals were. And, to flavor there death, Aracnia started \nthe internal autoguns that began to fire apon them.\n    &quot;Now that they will be dead in minutes, I want Paralysis and Darkmouse to \ngo stand gaurd by them. Quickstrike and THunder Hammer should go to. I&#39;ll \nsend Mosquitor shortly. But, above all, I WANT THEM DEAD!&quot; She screamed.\n\n"}}
