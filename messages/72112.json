But there aer\n&gt; too many pieces to this puzzle.  The Schemings of TARANTALUS, HYDRAS, and\n&gt; CRYOTEK as well, and the ongoing schemes of each of their own underlings.\n&gt; This situation is too complex even within our own forces.  And we have the\n&gt; Maximals and the followers of UNICRON to deal with as well, and other\n&gt; things.  We spend too much of our time dealing with internal issues.\n&gt; Pah.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking along then as the trio stomped off towards TARANTALUS&#39; bay.  &quot;And\n&gt; I am interested in finding out just how he was able to restore a protoform\n&gt; without the rest of us knowing, Yess..&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKYSHADOW gave DINOBOT an appraising look, glancing at him in the dim\nlights of the cargo bay. &quot;It is an interesting turn of events is it\nnot?&quot; He said as he walked. &quot;Tarantulus seems to be up to his old\ntricks again.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is Hydras&#39; old ship, and I am sure Tarantulus knew about it. &quot;\nHis voice was low and his optics dimmed slightly as he talked and\nprocessed the information. &quot;Tarantulus could not have completed her\nconstruction in the amount of time we have been on this ship. Either\nhe has moved her to this location at some point . . . &quot; SKYSHADOW\nturned to look at the open door that led into the room TARANTULUS was\nin just off the cargo bay, &quot; . . . or he was already here.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a smirk from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;I thought the addage was &#39;any port\n&gt; in a storm for the rats deserting the sinking ships&#39;?  If you&#39;re going to\n&gt; do something you don&#39;t like, you can at least be accurate as to your own\n&gt; circumstances.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And then of his instructions over she nodded.  &quot;So, do you want to do this\n&gt; the old fashioned way or other then?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Any way you like my sweet.&quot; he said in low tones, his optics filled\nwith wicked amusement.\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW WASPINATOR/BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, as INFERNO came in escorting HYDRAS and CRYOTEK, and\n&gt; TARANTALUS pointed over to BLACKARACHNIA, the first to break the silence\n&gt; before any of the other officers was..\n&gt;\n&gt; WASPIANTOR.  &quot;Oooh, Spider-Bot hazz radioactive Spider-Babe.  Wazzzpinator\n&gt; rememberzz!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, there was a SIGH from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;The more things\n&gt; change..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning over to CRYOTEK and HYDRAS, and giving a lazy twirl and pirouette,\n&gt; winking her optic unit over at CRYOTEK, &quot;A pleasure to make your..\n&gt; Acquiantance.&quot;  Giving a sultry drop of her vocalizer over at HYDRAS&#39;\n&gt; direction and then to CRYOTEK.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCRYOTEK nodded, his stance, that of a dignified gentleman, and yet\nhere was a certain glance from his optics that said something more.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What a cute thing!&quot;said hidras while he watched Blackarachnia &quot;Smart,\n&gt; poisonus, and I hope that you havent any disloyalty in your genes... It&#39;s\n&gt; for your own good, I would hate to rip off with my bare hands your\n&gt; beautifull body; but I will do it if were necesary&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Oh I am sure that nothing as delicate as this could have treachery in\nher proccessors.&quot; CRYOTEK said as his crimson optics watched\nBLACKARACHNIA closely. While he words and even tone held hints of dry\nhumor, his gaze however was dark, watchful and not entirely tusting.\n\n&gt; Looking at Inferno said &quot;My loyal soldier, I have a special mission for\n&gt; you&quot;he started to download some codes and a map&quot;Thjis is the map of our old\n&gt; base: the Blackfortress and I need that you bring me a... special item that\n&gt; is in my former chambers;with those codes you can open and unlock the roomn\n&gt; and the deposit box... Fractil, the treacherous spider and the dark lady...\n&gt; Come with me I need you for create a new predacon&quot;he typed some stuff and a\n&gt; drone with a caged vampire come in&quot;We have alot to do and we need more\n&gt; troops&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was an answering nod from INFERNO. &quot;As you command your highness.&quot;\n\n&quot;But wasn&#39;t your base destroyed Mighty Hydras?&quot; SKYSHADOW said as he\nlooked at HYDRAS.\n\nINFERNO glared at SKYSHADOW, &quot;Do not question the royalty!&quot; He looked\nat HYDRAS, &quot;I am ready and at your command!&quot;\n\nHe turned to leave, giving SKYSHADOW one last glare before moving\ntowards the door.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
