She went to her console and \nlooked around.  She sat with her face in her hands.  She felt sick.  \nShe had let three bots run past her and escape.  She hadn&#39;t been any \nhelp to Scorponok.  She just wanted to crawl down a hole and die.  \nAnd she knew that if Megatron got mad at her, that&#39;s just what would \nhappen to her. Only she wouldn&#39;t crawl, she would be blown to inferno.\nShe knew her life was as good as slag.  Her one love didn&#39;t show much \nfeeling towards her anymore.  Megatron, the leader whom she tried to \nmake proud of her, now thought of her as a punching bag and not as a \nhelpful, loyal bot.  She sat there and sighed.  What can I do, she \nthought to herself. She got up and walked back to the lab.  she \ndidn&#39;t even look at SCorponok, she just started to clean things up.\n\nShe picked up a few boxes and put them away.  She found viles and \nother instruments on the floor.  She did her best to tidy up the lab.\nShe came across a black box, one she had seen before but didn&#39;t know \nwhat it did.  She went over to hand it to SCorponok.  &quot;This was one \nthing you ordered me not to mess with. Here you are commander.&quot; she \nput it on the counter next to Scorponok and continued to clean up the \nlab.\n\n\n\n"}}
