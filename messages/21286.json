They pulled out there weapons. All three fired rockets at the area \nwhere the area was infected with the virus. not all of the alliance members \nwould have been hit. so hopefull the ones who had been stuck there would \nstill be affected by the virus and hit by thier rockets. The three rockets \nlanded. All they saw was the flames. They turned and kept going.\n\n"}}
