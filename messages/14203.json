She opened the door to \nthe chamber and stepped out.  She had her head lowered and felt like \ncrying.  She knew she would feel bad for killing Land Mine, but she \nnever imagined the internal torture she would have to endure.  In her \nmind, she kept replaying the event over and over.  Wishing she could \ncorrect or undo what has been done.  She didn&#39;t even look up to see \nwho was around her.  Without a word, she went to her room and sat on \nthe edge of the bed. She closed her eyes and whispered,&quot;Will you ever \nforgive me Land Mine?  Will you ever give me peace?&quot;  She made no \nsound.  She only let the tears roll down her cheeks. \n\n\n"}}
