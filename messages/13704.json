Grappler, Aerostreak, \nGuantix, and Paralysis greet him with pointed and loaded pistols.\n    &quot;How can we help you, Megatron?&quot; Paralysis croaked.\n    He snorted and pushed his way past the foursome. &quot;I have a meeting with \nyour Commander....&quot; He said, and then mumbled, &quot;And i have a score to settle \nwith two little roaches...&quot;\n    He entered the tunnle and proceeded down the corridor looking at the dead \naliens as he went by. He came to the door and it slid open to reveal Aracnia, \nTarantulas, Darkmouse, and Quickstrike.\n    &quot;Isnt this the picture I always wanted to see. &quot; He said, &quot;Im not here to \nfight, Im here to get rid of these Aliens. Now point me to he nearest \ncomputer and we can get this over with quickly, &quot; He then looked to \nDarkmouse, &quot;as quick as cracking a spine.&quot;\n    &quot;Thats enough Megatron! Help us or leave!&quot; Aracnia said as Tarantulas \nlaughed himself out of his seat.\n    &quot;Im sorry, indeed I am. I will put old grudges aside and do what needs to \nbe done.&quot;\n\n    (Waspinator isnt in command, Kitkat is, until Megatrons return.)\n\n"}}
