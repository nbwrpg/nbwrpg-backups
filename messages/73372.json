What if he&#39;s o=\r\nne of them?  A mole?  What if everything that&#39;s happened so far, is because=\r\n a shred of intel has been leaked out from this base? &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nTucson pauses.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Stanton, I need you to run an activity =\r\nreport on all intel that has come in and out from the Ark, during the durat=\r\nion of the chain of events which have happened so far.  There may be good r=\r\neason to be suspicious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot looks over to the =\r\ngroup and returns to her work at the computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Lemme s=\r\nee what I can come up with, this might take a while.  I just hope Cheetor, =\r\nRhinox and Optimus Primal are still in one piece.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Night=\r\nshift limps along side Bump and looks up to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thank=\r\ns for the encouragement, we can use everything we got now.  Slaag, if it&#39;s =\r\ntrue that we got a mole on board, we&#39;re done for.  But it looks like the bi=\r\ng boss kinda knows who it could be.  Check out Tucson&#39;s body language, his =\r\ntail tapp&#39;n the ground, his stiff gait, and that little snarl on the snout.=\r\n  He does that when he smells someth&#39;n that doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to=\r\n keep an eye on Legacy.  Tell me if you see any suspicious behavior on his =\r\npart.  If you do, don&#39;t let him suspect that you know anything.  Just play =\r\nalong, observe and relay back to me what you observe.  Then together with L=\r\neo Prime, we can decide what action may need to be done.  I think this is l=\r\nong overdue. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads to the med b=\r\nay.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Local artist who specializes in illustration, using =\r\ntraditional and digital media.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I also specialize in ha=\r\nnd made crafts.  Great for any occasion!  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Need a great =\r\ngift idea that is original?  No problem!  Email me at this address and we w=\r\nill talk.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On May 8, 2012, at 12:08 PM, Super Cyclonus =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Legacy with eyes sligh=\r\ntly narrowed. It was a look of slight&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; annoyance and the =\r\nfact that Uproar could have been treated long before his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n symptoms got worse. Yet he keeps an even demeanor.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, i would have wanted to know about this sooner...

Well, that&#39;s over now, but I want&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him treated now=\r\n, and then you can do the same for me. I want no delays and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; no excuses.
