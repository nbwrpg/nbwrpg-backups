The Decepticons were a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit bigger than she was and she wasn&#39;t one to try to go hand to\n&gt; hand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if she didn&#39;t know the outcome. If Lunarpine had taught her one\n&gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was that she was no fighter. If she was to get through this it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wato be by intelligence, not force. &quot;Maximals, we&#39;re getting\n&gt; nowhere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting individual battles. move together and I can direct you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing also about the dease fire between the black fortress\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons and the Maximals she could use a little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; psychology. &quot;Perceptor, you are seriously pushing the agreement\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was aranged a while back, turn and leave and maybe you&#39;ll save the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; faith.&quot; Logic had always been her strong suit over brute force now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her Maximal back ground was needed over her mutant\n&gt; powers. &quot;Maximals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside the city, as the senior Maximal here I&#39;m assuming command,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; check the records under SHADOW WING if you please to back up my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; claims.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mustex moved forward &quot;I&#39;m with you Ice.&quot; he rose his rifle and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired five more pulse blasts from his rifle, this time targeting\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; target master Triggerhappy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
