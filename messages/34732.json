Let me begin.&quot; His translucent\n&gt; &gt; corporal body begins to shimmer as he recounts what he and the other\n&gt; &gt; Ikoto had said. &quot;We, the Ikoto, would like to propose a bet, \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; gamble you could say, on the fate of that planet, Earth. We \n&gt; &gt; propose that the Ikoto chose a group of sentient beings, like the\n&gt; &gt; ones you already have messed with, and put them on the planet. There\n&gt; &gt; they will be empowered with tasks, tasks of utmost importance in\n&gt; &gt; their minds. The group that the Ikoto choose will have to defeat\n&gt; &gt; your group, and gain control of the planet. Likewise, your chosen\n&gt; &gt; ones will have to defeat the bots chosen by the Ikoto. If our side\n&gt; &gt; succeeds, we will do what we will with the planet,&quot; continued\n&gt; &gt; Azafroth knowing full well that the Vok knew what the Ikoto would\n&gt; &gt; do, &quot;and if your side succeeds, then we will leave.&quot; The Ikoto&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; body shimmers in cruel delight at the game, knowing that their\n&gt; &gt; choice of chosen robots was the ultimate irony. Azafroth emanated a\n&gt; &gt; cold amused smile. Uokarase buts into the telepathik war zone, and\n&gt; &gt; put mental pressure on the Vok representative, &quot;Well, what do you\n&gt; &gt; say?&quot; Uokarase&#39;s thoughts speed intently around the groups.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 15 May 2001, at 6:07, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::The Vok::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If Voks frowned, this one would have.
