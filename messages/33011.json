I&#39;ll meet you after this battle. I&#39;m currently\nengaged in combat at the Cybertronian Fire, but it shouldn&#39;t last too\nlong.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nShredder nods. &quot;Allright.

Then I will rule supreme over two galaxies.&quot;\n&gt;      The comm to Zardus completed right after the word &quot;galaxies&quot; \n&gt; Magmatron spoke to Zardus. &quot;Alliance Commander Zardus, I think it is \n&gt; about time you and I had a meeting, face to face. For me to see what \n&gt; has become of my project, and how it has helped you. Magmatron out.&quot;\n&gt;      Because of time dilations, Magmatron and crew would have been \n&gt; gone much longer than it seemed. In that time Magmatron and an army \n&gt; or Xenomorphic Transformers had conquired the main planets of another \n&gt; galaxy, breeding new types of Transformers. Magmatron knew that \n&gt; Dachande and Cerberus had slipped through his fingers, but not for \n&gt; long, at least with Cerberus. Dachande was of no use to Magmatron \n&gt; anymore, the prototype was outdated, and he was expendable. Shredder \n&gt; on the other hand, well, Magmatron liked him. This would be a very \n&gt; interesting war.\n\n\n"}}
