tunnels...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras opens fire on the insect like creature his blasts rip into\n&gt; the creature severely damaging it, that combined with the other damage\n&gt; that it has already recived forces it to stumble back several steps,\n&gt; smoke begining to come from several cracks that have opened in his\n&gt; armor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Curiously it smiled as it turned around to look at Hydras, its mouth\n&gt; dripping some sort of lubricant from the side as it did so, &quot;You are\n&gt; different, more powerful. Like this last one. You will become one with\n&gt; the horde like he will.&quot; the creature said, its voice much rougher\n&gt; than it had been before, obviously from the damage it had just taken.\n&gt; &quot;Your techological advantages and distinctiveness will be added to our\n&gt; own and wel will be stronger.&quot; It turned its cannon on Hydras it it\n&gt; prepared to fire. However instead of firing on Hydras his chest\n&gt; erupted in flames and smoke and it fell over!\n&gt;\n&gt; Behind the creature stood Cyclonus, his cannon in hand, it is obvious\n&gt; that he had fired the felling blow, and also obvious that he had not\n&gt; been unconscious only dazed, and Hydras&#39; attack had allowed him to\n&gt; fire on him as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Cyclonus said as he stepped foward, his legs a bit shaky,\n&gt; obviously he was also heavily damaged. &quot;We have recovered Scourge, but\n&gt; his two drones were taken before I got here.&quot; Cyclonus glanced at the\n&gt; fallen creature. &quot;We will need to get Scourge some medical attention.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus and Inferno had already stepped foward to pick up the fallen\n&gt; forms of Scourge and Bruticus-X.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl, who should have been recovering Insecticon was instead\n&gt; looking at the fallen creature, his optics curious, he was reaching\n&gt; foward to examine it . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
