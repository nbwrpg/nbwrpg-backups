There \n&gt; will be an armed garrison and an entry way for you to enter the \nOtyebis where \n&gt; you will be alerted of ground rules.  If you do not comply you will \nbe \n&gt; imprisoned.  If you break any of the rules you will be imprisoned, \nput on \n&gt; trial, and possibly executed.  Thank you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Where you land there will be about twenty different IGL guards in \ngold and \n&gt; red uniforms of various species)\n\n\n"}}
