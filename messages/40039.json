He didn&#39;t \ncurse, he didn&#39;t yell in pain.  He simply got a target lock and fired two \nmissiles, one at Forrior and the other at Cledar.\n\n---\n\nUnitron was struck by all the shots, the lasers not really doing anything \nwhile the two missiles put large dents in his turret.\n\nAft, Unitron thought.  I have to keep moving or I won&#39;t last.\n\nThe Decepticon powered up his motor and began going 30 MPH and climbing, but \nwouldn&#39;t be able to go to his maximum of 60 MPH because of the missile \nattacks.  His turret swerved slowly, firing off two blasts of large lasers at \nHot Rod (he&#39;s a tank, no longer a space fighter).  His mounted machine gun on \nhis turret turned just as fast as it ever did, firing off ten rapid laser \nbolts, all at Aerotaur.\n\n\n"}}
