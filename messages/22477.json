This goes to everyone. If you \n&gt; have Maxi chars, GET TO THE SLAGGING MEETING.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster frowns, recieving Chordate&#39;s transmission. &quot;I see. Allright, \n&gt; put them on enemy. But if they approach, alert me. THe Maximals are \n&gt; having a meeting right now, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you stayed and \n&gt; watched the scanners.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He growls, pushing a button near his seat. A transmission is sent out \n&gt; to all Maximals, repeated over and over and over untill they would be \n&gt; detected to be within the Cybertronian Fire. The message also played \n&gt; over the intercom of the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Maximals, this is the fourth call. Get to the Cybertronian \n&gt; Fire&#39;s conference room immediately. This meeting is not optional.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster ends the transmission, sitting back in his chair. What kind \n&gt; of a team was this? No wonder they needed help in the war. He looks \n&gt; at the hologram of Koj, frowning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why did you and Inu just steal supplies from the Cybertronian Fire?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (I&#39;m taking back control of Chordate from Yanshosh)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chordate:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chordate sipped a cup of slightly heated energon.  It was about \n&gt; five degrees \n&gt; &gt; lower than the temperature needed to set the energon off into an \n&gt; explosion.  \n&gt; &gt; He spit his energon up on his lap, though he ignored that, and \n&gt; looked at a \n&gt; &gt; monitor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He saw Koj and Inu shoot open storage chamber and continued to \n&gt; watch them \n&gt; &gt; leave the Cybertronian Fire.  He activated his comm. unit to \n&gt; Kluster and Iron \n&gt; &gt; Raptor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Kluster, Iron Raptor, this is Chordate.  Those two new Maximals, \n&gt; Koj and \n&gt; &gt; Inu, have just stolen quite a bit of supplies from the Cybertronian \n&gt; Fire, and \n&gt; &gt; in the direction they&#39;re heading, I can only see one real important \n&gt; thing, \n&gt; &gt; the Ark.  I&#39;m going to place them on enemy.&quot; he ended the \n&gt; transmission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He finished putting them on enemy only a cycle later, when a \n&gt; thought popped \n&gt; &gt; into his head.  Ever since that Predacon inflitrated the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire, \n&gt; &gt; the codes had never been changed.  The comm. frequencies and shield \n&gt; &gt; frequencies had, but nothing else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He began working on that, knowing it would only take a couple \n&gt; cycles to set \n&gt; &gt; up the programs to randomly change the codes that would then send \n&gt; all the new \n&gt; &gt; codes to those with the authority.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Such as, people, I can&#39;t tell who gets which codes because I don&#39;t \n&gt; know all \n&gt; &gt; the Maximals, but for something like emergency shut off of all \n&gt; systems in the \n&gt; &gt; CF, new recruits wouldn&#39;t have that.  That would be just Iron \n&gt; Raptor, \n&gt; &gt; Kluster, and Chordate.  Please be logical like that when Chordate \n&gt; finishes \n&gt; &gt; the codes and I have him send &#39;em out.  Thank you)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
