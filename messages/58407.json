She had become \nconfortable \n&gt; with her form by now. Her old existance was now gone.. a new \nexistance lay ahead \n&gt; of her. When she was out in the wilderness, it all seemed to guide \nher, click \n&gt; within her, hit her with the reality of it all. Now.. she knew \nthat there was \n&gt; a path that Alpha Trion had forseen ... a path only she could \ntake. No Autobot \n&gt; she fought could walk her path. It was a giant leap for a peaceful \nold bot \n&gt; like Alpha Trion to take. \n&gt; \n&gt; As she moved into the conference room. &quot;What is it that you want?&quot; \nHer voice \n&gt; was rather pleasant.\n\n\n"}}
