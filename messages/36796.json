He thought to\nhimself for a second. He didnt have quite the expertise of Ratchet, or\nHoist. But he was better at this than he was at fighting. He opened his\nchest compartment, and ordered his computer to convert some of his own\nenergon into a cube. He then placed it into Redhot&#39;s hand, hoping it\nwould be enough for now. He then activated his geological equipment, and\nmonitered Redhot&#39;s head, for anything unusual, magnetic interferance,\nmocrobes, etc.\n\n"}}
