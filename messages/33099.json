It was in fact Double Punch&#39;s cyberbee, Beeline.  \n\nTurning his interest back to where it belonged he only laughed.  He changed \nhis voice back to its normal tone for intimidation.  His voice would be heard \nin the mind and for some with relatively weak minds compared to Unicron, it \nwould hurt.\n\n/YOU, HOT ROD, DO NOT HAVE THE AUTOBOT MATRIX OF LEADERSHIP NOR GALVATRON&#39;S \nINCOMPITENCE TO AID YOU.  NOR ARE YOU RODIMUS PRIME, BUT STILL AN \nINSIGNIFICANT INSECT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF OPTIMUS PRIME.  YOU \nCOULD NOT EVEN DEFEAT ME WITH YOUR PRECIOUS MATRIX.  YOU WILL ENJOY THE VOID \nSOON ENOUGH./ Unicron&#39;s (Orson Welles&#39;) voice boomed as if he was speaking \ninto several megaphones at once.  \n\nHe raised his left arm, firing off two missiles at Hot Rod.  He raised his \nright arm, firing off a sonic wave at Magnus Prime, the ancient being never \neven considering Ultra Magnus to be a threat.  In the Chaos-Bringer&#39;s \nopinion, Ultra Magnus was a complete incompitent fool.\n\n---\n\nTeufel&#39;s shoulder cannons fired a total of forty rapid laser bolts (20 from \neach) at Zardus.  The cannons in his arms fired off a total of four missiles. \n Two energy-signature seeking missiles from the left arm cannon at Iron \nRaptor, and two missiles at the CF.  The bland looking robot noted the \nretreat of the bulk of forces attacking the Cybertronian Fire.  Though his \nlong range sensors detected Sun Crusher approaching, it was abvious a retreat \nwas in effect.\n\n"}}
