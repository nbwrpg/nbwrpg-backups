He heard a commotion near his apartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics shared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching Megatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting her.  His brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, tenticuled, robot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the door aside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, but megatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery bot escaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics helped his brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics shut the door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand to reassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew black, Neutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older brother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  Neutronics covered his audio\n recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n \n \nMalice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  Instantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced off his index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the insides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down the wire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and looked around.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up gently, rested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the cargo net to face Wolfblade.\n:Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n\nshadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@...&gt; wrote:\nCamoflage::\n\nShe purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled even \ncloser to him.  Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her sleep, \nshe muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I won&#39;t \nget rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay mommy.&quot;  \nShe whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n\n\nWolfblade::\nShe moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched her. It \nwas Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping bot and \nsighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders and \nwondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought to \nherself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \nexperience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just to raise \na bot&#39;s oil pressure.\nShe turned her head to see that Malice had a little one sleeping at \nhis side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room to \nsleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could sneek in to \nthis place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in and kill \nthem. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought disturbed her \nenough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for the kids \nto wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n\n\n\n&quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into damnation.
