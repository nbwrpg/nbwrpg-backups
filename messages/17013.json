You are going to get along, or I \nwill put you both in the brig! Now, to the plan. Everyone, here.&quot;\nPrebon handed everyone except Spears a small circular device. The \nTrainers pt it on.\n&quot;This is a cloaking device. It will mask your signature. Now, I will \nhave Spears tied up and with me. My Trainers plus Savage will be far \nin the back, listening to what takes place. They will come forward \njust incase Ramulus brought back up. Slayer, you will be up on a \nledge, scoping at Ramulus. As soon as you get a decent shot, kill \nhim. Now let&#39;s move out!&quot;\n\nPrebon and The Trainers left the base. Prebon called for Savage, and \nwhen he came put a cloaking device on his skin.\n\n&quot;All of you can get on him. Remember to activate them when we get \ncloser to the area.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
