I live in Georgia, and wouldn&#39;t be\noffended if you talked about Southern people in a\nhumorous way (although I wish I lived up North, love\nhockey, hate southern accents, and think the only\nthing red necks are good for is singing country music\nwhich I consider the greatest form of music in the\nworld ironically).

We are a nation of thinkers and mediators.\n&gt; Conflicts are wasteful to us. \n&gt; They waste money, resources and more importantly\n&gt; lives. Why fight when you \n&gt; can talk it down?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. We saw the war in Irak as an opportunity to get\n&gt; more petroleum so the big \n&gt; shots could continue screwing normal people. As it\n&gt; is right now, the cost of \n&gt; gas has recently bursted up to a dollar a liter in\n&gt; just a few weeks! \n&gt; Coincidence? I let you judge.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Rumours go around that Iran put false information\n&gt; in US hands so they \n&gt; could see Irak bulldozed, which it was. If that were\n&gt; true, US should be more \n&gt; than ashamed of themselves and realize that being\n&gt; all military oriented \n&gt; leaves them with no head to think.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know what people of other countries think of\n&gt; it, but Canada never \n&gt; saw any provocation by Irak that was worth a war and\n&gt; the death of hundreds \n&gt; of people. If no one else does, I beg that God\n&gt; blesses the good people...\n&gt; \n&gt; This was my personal comment and hopefully the last\n&gt; in this argument. I do \n&gt; not want any other comment that disrespects ANYONE,\n&gt; be they US or other. We \n&gt; are all equal on this planet and not even a\n&gt; president has the right to \n&gt; bullshit the lowliest person that exists.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Fwd: Fw: Speech\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 4 Jun 2004 15:23:42 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This is non-religious, so don&#39;t flame me...oh, and\n&gt; &gt;what happened to those bots talking to\n&gt; Fortuneteller?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Note: forwarded message attached.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;__________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;Friends.
