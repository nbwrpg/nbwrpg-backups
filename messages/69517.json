He was fe=\r\neling the effects even in vehicle mode. Once transformed he could feel that=\r\n it would be extremely difficult to transform back into robot mode.

Yet, he didn&#39;t want to seem t=\r\noo helpless either. He finds the strength to get on his knees and pauses th=\r\nere for a moment. At this time his processor was spinning a million miles p=\r\ner second, as a wave of dizziness hits him with enough of a punch to knock =\r\nhim back down on his left side.
