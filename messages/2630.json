He saw Jackel and Pheniox at the door. Slag! He \nwas caught. His wide chest heaved, and he stared at them. His eyes soon \ndrifted over to Mantella. He then turned back to the two Predacons. He \nremembered Megatron being calm about them around while he was being attacked \nin the CR room. He had to do something. Fine, he could be calm. Don&#39;t risk \nthe damage. He couldn&#39;t have done something too evident. He hid the disk \nbehind his back and put them away. He tilted his head and grinned at the \ntwo.\n\n&quot;No problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;Help you wit&#39; something?&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Fri, 2 Jun 2000 12:19:23 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin took control over the ship while Rampage, Inferno, and Tankkor\n&gt;were out. Jackle, Pheniox, and Black Aracnia, along with Transanulas manned\n&gt;the computer systems. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Black Aracnia ::: Damn it, Quickstrike is in he systems agian. My\n&gt;computer is going beserk.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: JAckle takes out his pistol ::: I say we finish him off for good!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin ::: Pheniox, Jackle, go after him and kill him for good. Black\n&gt;Aracnia and Transanulas and myself will try to fix the computers.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Jackle and Pheniox burst out of the control room. They run down the \n&gt;main\n&gt;corridor to Quickstrikes position. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Pheniox ::: He should be in here. Ready?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Jackle nods and opens the door. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Yes, the Newcomers. In my opinion, if we join our forces\n&gt;we can totally out number them.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: Or, we could treaty with them, and crush the Maximals!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell BEast and MArine glance towrds Megatron ::: It seems that you want\n&gt;to make a juncture with them for your own gain.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: They came from Cybertron, and they came to mine energon \n&gt;and\n&gt;set up a colony. In months we could have this planet under our control! We\n&gt;could enslave the humans, and mine this planet dry. The Auto-bots would be\n&gt;our hostages. No one would dare stop us.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast nods ::: Yes, good thinking. But they did try to kill us. I\n&gt;want to at least let them know we are in charge here, that we are the big\n&gt;guns. We need to make them nuturel.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
