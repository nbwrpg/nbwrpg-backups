And tell me, \nplease!!?)\n\n* The small, white kitten was set on the control panel and left alone for \nthe first time in his little life. He mewed pitiously and when Iron Raptor \ndidn&#39;t hear him, he followed her to the door and looked around. This ship \nwas large for someone so small. He fluttered where he was, trying to find \nwhere Iron Raptor had dissapeared too, but when he couldn&#39;t locate her, he \nturned around and went back to his original spot on the panel. Mabey if he \nwaited long enough......He sighed and lowered his head to his paws. Mabey if \nhe took a small nap it would help pass the time. He was just dozing off when \nhe heard again that same phycic scream he had heard earlier. His head shot \nup and he looked around, but the location of the scream wasn&#39;t nearby. He \nfluttered up from his spot, Iron Raptor wouldn&#39;t be mad at him if he left, \nwould she? It was an emergency. He flew out of the room, and began flying \nthrough the halls, trying to find his way out. But he was unable to. He \nsighed and flew back in the direction he came. But when he was unable to \nfind the room he was originally in, he became frightened. Now he was lost \ntoo. No way out, no way back. He fluttered to a beam near the ceiling and \nsat there. Mabey if he waited. He sniffed. Fresh air? From where? He looked \naround, and spying an open air shaft, he flew to it. Here was a way out!! He \nflew up into it and out into the open, soaring to the place were he heard \nthe scream in his head.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Bite Me!\n&gt;Date: Tue, 13 Feb 2001 17:52:07 -0800\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Matrix is in a leg compartment, KSL. Not in her chest...yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor looked over the enemy carefully before her attention was\n&gt;suddenly grabbed by the feeling of somebot staring at her.\n&gt;Looking towards the direction the feeling was comeing from her eyes fell on\n&gt;Sun Crusher.\n&gt;He was glaring at her chest!\n&gt;But slag where he was looking, with the way his optics seemed to be on her\n&gt;he was probably sizing her up as some target. Her fingers itched to reach\n&gt;for the handle of her sword, but with controle she kept them right where\n&gt;they were.\n&gt;&lt; Let him make the first move. So I can collect energy.&gt;\n&gt;Her eyes were on his when he decided to look up from her chest and meet her\n&gt;own glare, her face fixed in a look of studied aggression under her helm.\n&gt;If he and his fellow bots didn&#39;t take her advice and leave he&#39;d know what \n&gt;it\n&gt;was to deal with a Maximal commander who would rather see them dead then\n&gt;inside of the brig.\n&gt;Iron Raptor had a hate for her enemies, a hate that could lead to both\n&gt;trouble or victory.\n&gt;But she was kinda puzzled when he finally talked, ordering her to give him\n&gt;what was in her chest.\n&gt;Her spark?\n&gt;But that couldn&#39;t be it, it basically had no power. It was her whole body\n&gt;which had the power.\n&gt;But Sun Crusher&#39;s intensions were clear when he suddenly tomd her that it\n&gt;was the Matrix he wanted and not her spark, still confusing her for a\n&gt;second.\n&gt;But...the Maximal Matrix was in her leg, not her chest.\n&gt;She glared at him.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; As enemies of the Maximals your words mean nothing to me. Besides, the\n&gt;Matrix isn&#39;t in my chest, dolt!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor unlocked the hatch to her leg armor where the Matrix sat.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; It&#39;s in...my.............&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* When she looked...it wasn&#39;t there!!\n&gt;The Matrix wasn&#39;t there!\n&gt;Where was it?!*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; It&#39;s gone!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Panic struck her spark before her systems suddenly noticed that in the\n&gt;paniced rate of her spark there was something different.\n&gt;Different as in...something that wasn&#39;t there before.\n&gt;&lt; It IS in my spark! It has to be, otherwise what&#39;s that feeling?&quot;\n&gt;The Matrix had somehow disappeared from her armor and was sitting snug \n&gt;right\n&gt;in the center of her spark where her life source sat.\n&gt;Mysteries of the Matrix was a distent thought in her mind.\n&gt;Her panic ceased and she looked back towards Sun Crusher, looking him over\n&gt;with a look on her face that expressed distaste...even though he couldn&#39;t\n&gt;see it.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Yeah...right. Like I&#39;ll hand it to YOU. Now get lost before you annoy me,\n&gt;little man.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Her spark was still thudding with the panic as it wore off, regaining her\n&gt;composure. Her hands rested on her hips as she looked across the field at\n&gt;him.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
