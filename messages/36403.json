Besides if you cut \nthrough\n&gt; you&#39;ll be damaging the supplies in our upper supply depots.&quot; He \nhoped that\n&gt; the supplies would be more important than the risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before the ship could respond a wave of fire struck the roof. \nblowing it to\n&gt; pieces sending it down into the control room on top of \nIgnatius. &quot;Now that\n&gt; was just BRILLIANT, you tell me to come out then bury me alive.&quot; \nIgnatius\n&gt; had taken more abuse in this one day than he had dureing the entire \nwar, He\n&gt; wanted more than anything to curl up in a lube bath and sleep for \nmonths.\n\nCyanide smirked as he watched the top of the trainers base get \nmangled and quickly flew into it via the hole. He looked around and \nthen at Ignatius who was covered with metal before he opened fire on \nthe metal around the bot with with acid beams from his hands.\n\nCyanide: &quot;Now then fool... where is the rest of your crew? ANd what \nitems do you have on this ship anyways that may be of use?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile Vile watched above as Drillbit made his escape and \npaitiently awaited the departure of the rest of the Predacons and \nDestrons.\n\n\n"}}
