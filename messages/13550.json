She was please that he liked \nwhat she had caught for him.  She looked up into the sky for a \nwhile.  She could see the night creatures flying about. The bats and \nthe owls and such.  She leaned against a tree and looked at Dollen.\n&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it. I can catch more in the morning for you.  They \ndon&#39;t come out at night.&quot; She put her hands behind her head and \nleaned back against the tree.  She looked up at the stars and sighed.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;           Dollen looked at his food.  He transformed to taranturtle \nmode.\n&gt; He skuttled around on his legs.  Then he went up to his food.  He \nrubbed his\n&gt; two front legs together and said, &quot;Dinner is served!!!!!  \nHehehehehe!!!&quot; He\n&gt; cackled, sounding very much like Tarantulas.  He bit a big chunk \nout of the\n&gt; gopher meat with his two spider mandibles, and then another bit \nwith his\n&gt; turtle jaws.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Hmmmm, tasty!!&quot; He said as he transformed and took another \nbite of the\n&gt; meat.  He finished his meat, and then looked at GoldenEye.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;You&#39;re quite the hunter, yes,&quot; He said, sounding very \nmuch like\n&gt; Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: When I say Dollen sounds very much like Tarantulas and \nMegatron, I\n&gt; don&#39;t mean he sounds exactly like their voice, he just sounds like \nthem in\n&gt; speaking style in his own voice)\n\n\n"}}
