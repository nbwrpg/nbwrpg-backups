If she\ncontinued to transfer power into the dome from the sword she would soon be\nrunning off her own power supply and now from what energy she had managed to\ncollect from the charges.\nSweat was collecting on her brow and the hair, which formed her bangs, were\nstringy and wet against it, hearing her own breathing rasping from inside\nthe helm.\nThe battle rage which controlled her movements wasn�t gone and it wouldn�t\nbe for a while, but soon her energy would be what was powering this dome and\nshe was sure that she wouldn�t be able to do it.\nAfter all, this body was made for speed and swiftness, not brut strength.\nBut she had seen just what damage this new weapon had caused, and she would\nhave whistled with impressment if she would have had any breath to spare.\nBut watching Nemisis Enforcer try to protect himself in his beast mode, then\nfail and fall to earth was all the satisfaction she needed.\nIf only�if only she could do that again, then maybe she could get him on the\nground or maybe into stasis lock. Then she could move onto another foe,\nmaybe take out a couple more.\nBut it would take her up to 20 min to get everything back again, up to a\nworkable level�as well as more then a few charges against her shield.\nBut Iron Raptor almost caught herself laughing as she looked at Nemisis\nafter he had dropped to ground. His wings all charred and sizzling. It was\nrather funny. He had looked like a fly, which had ran into an electric\nfence!\nButs she snickered to herself instead.\nShe had watched Nemisis Enforcer launch himself into the air but knew that\nhe was badly hurt, simply smiling as he called her a witch. *\n\n� Have no better names for me, Nemisis?�\n\n* She said to herself from inside of her helm, her faceplate warm from her\nbreath against the metal from the past few moments.\nIron Raptor stood ready with her sword in hand again, but the dome had long\nsince disappeared and blade was only now dimming to the image of normal\nalloy again. Now the air around her and probably Nemisis had more of a\nstatic feeling to it, like there had just been a lightning strike and the\nair still sizzled with the heat of it.\nShe had no idea what surprise this body would pull out of it�s hat now, but\nshe was sure that it would do some damage�but since most of her energy had\nbeen in the dome, she doubted that it would be anything spectacular.\n\nHer scanners swept the surrounding area, taking in the remaining signatures\nof Maximal and Alliance bots, her mind turning to Prowl after she had\nreceived his thoughts. *\n&lt; Are you alright, Prowl? &gt;\n* She sent, her mind slightly worried about him. But he couldn�t be\ndead�because she would be dead too.\nIt was supposedly, part of their link and the deal he had made with the\nMatrix.\nThere was one thing that she had failed to notice, however�was what weapon\nScattershot was throwing towards her. And she didn�t know just what it was\nuntil it was much too late.\nIron Raptor had just enough time to turn her eyes towards Scattershot, not\neven enough for her head to follow, before a charge suddenly struck her side\nin a wide and heavy explosion..\nThe impact threw her 10feet from where she had been standing last, armor\nstill flying away from where she had been his as she fell hard against her\nshoulder.\nHer arm slid under her side as the momentum carried her body over so that\nshe ended up on her back, her cape sprawled out under her and her helm\nretracted. Her hair also sprawled out under her, her arms out at either side\nof her while her legs were drawn together.\nA gaping wound in her side, plating from her side, along it and then over\nhalf her stomach, as well as armor from her hip missing. But it was only her\nside which was bleeding, blue skin spattered with mech-fluid showing in the\nremaining areas armor was missing.\n\nShe could feel it, the circuits and wires which were broken or twisted\ninside of the hole, and the ribs which were cracked or snapped deeper\ninside.\nThere was little wreckage in too deeper then that, but it hurt like an SOB.\nIron Raptor breather out a heavy sigh and opened her eyes, looking up at the\nsky dotted with smoke from exploding charges and the ringing in her ears of\nthe gun blasts and battle cries. Stunned and not moving from where she lay.\nNemisis was still in the air but she couldn�t see or hear him, and\nScattershot was still out there.\nShe knew that she had to get up, she couldn�t fall from just a wound to the\nside. She had suffered worse from past battles.\nBut then she remembered something�she had been more armored then, and now\nshe had sensitive skin/armor now and she would feel every damage she took.\nIron Raptor sighed enough, but if this wound stayed like this, open and\nbleeding, then she would lose energy and maybe even pass out from loss of\nmech-fluid. She had to heal, but she couldn�t just run inside and use a CR\nchamber.\nShe closed her eyes, trying to shut out the weapons and voices, but it was\nno use. But what she was doing was trying to find a repair program or\nsomething like that, and she needed to be still for something like that.\nGoing through the programs and files which were new to her and obviously\ncame with this new body.\nWhat she would give for an instruction manual!\nWhile doing this, Iron Raptor had not noticed the Maximal gestalt, which had\nappeared on the field, mistaking it�s rumbling footsteps for that of\nOblitercon. *\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
