The Shadow Destiny&#39;s weapons are used \nin the only goal to create suitable terrain for a techno-organic base. The \nreformatting would take place only in Australia, or, if the council chooses \nso, a part of Australia. The weapons will be destroyed or otherwise rendered \nuseless as soon as the base is established or even before. Australia is not \nused as a base for any factions I have heard of, and its reformatting would \nnot affect gameplay in a dramatic way. What I want to know is if I continue \non my story line or if I have to redo my post entirely. Please do not mind \nthe previous posts and reply only to this one.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
