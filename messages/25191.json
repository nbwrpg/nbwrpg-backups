He fired off two sonic arc blasts from his sonic blaster at\n&gt; &gt; Tarantopulous.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pyro remained submerged in the mud, now six feet under, the pressure\n&gt; &gt; stopping.  But Pyro couldn&#39;t move.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hiss fired off four fusion blasts from his cannon at Tarantopulous.  A\n&gt; blast\n&gt; &gt; of freezing struck his arm, the right shoulder joint freezing up and\n&gt; &gt; unmovable for now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scavenger transformed to his biped mode, running over to Pyro and\nplunging\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; arm into the mud, wrapping his arm around his comrade&#39;s wrist and\ntugging.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hot Spot transformed to his biped mode, the blue robot turning around\nand\n&gt; &gt; making a run for Blades and First Aid, his sensors reporting First Aid\n&gt; near\n&gt; &gt; death.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Groove lowered his weapon, running after Hot Spot for Blades and First\n&gt; Aid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blades reached First Aid, putting pressure on First Aid&#39;s neck wound and\n&gt; &gt; chest wounds, blocking the flow of mech-fluid from those areas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First Aid remained unconsciouss, slipping into darkness slowly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Streetwise kept his stance, covering the other Protectobots in case of\n&gt; sudden\n&gt; &gt; attack.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Demon Wulf looked up to Iron Raptor, silently walking over to Future\n&gt; Zardus.\n&gt; &gt; The Vok warrior kept his sword pointed at the ground.  But he got a\nsensor\n&gt; &gt; lock on IR if she tried to run.  He would hunt his prey if the Maximal\n&gt; &gt; faction of the Cybertronians attempted anything.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Flesh Ripper lowered his rifle, transforming to his hyena mode and\npadding\n&gt; &gt; over next to Demon Wulf, transforming back to biped mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark Claw transformed to his beaten up attack vehicle mode, remaining\n&gt; where\n&gt; &gt; he was and arming his missile launchers just in case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Beeline descended rapidly down towards the Alliance warriors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Double Punch received FZ&#39;s transmission and had ordered everyone around\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; and the cyber-bee to stand down.  He held out a wrist, Beeline landing\non\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; and attaching to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manterror slowly got up, hearing the last bit of FZ&#39;s orders.  He made\nhis\n&gt; &gt; way for Double Punch.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We won this round.  But we&#39;ll win the next.&quot; he laughed, transforming\nto\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; badly damaged biped mode and landing on the ground next to FZ, stinger\n&gt; &gt; missile launchers in hand but missing missiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bumblebee continued hovering in the air, his arms akimbo and the missile\n&gt; &gt; launchers pointed at the sky.  He looked at the carnage around the\n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian Fire and the damage caused to the CF, and wondered if the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals considered this a victory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sixshot transformed to his winged wolf creature mode, taking flight and\n&gt; &gt; preparing for the next attack.  He&#39;d known Autobots as well as Maximals\nto\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; stupid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ares waited, weapons pointed at the ground.  Hopefully negotiations\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; work and he could get back to slaughtering Maxis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Receiving a transmission from FZ, Sun Crusher raised an arm towards\n&gt; Reflector\n&gt; &gt; and pointed towards the CF.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The second-in-command of the Brotherhood powered up the boosters in his\n&gt; feet\n&gt; &gt; to full power and took off for the bridge of the CF.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reflector nodded at Sun Crusher, tossing his rifle into subspace and\n&gt; heading\n&gt; &gt; for the CF as he flew through the air at full speed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Minion stopped, sliding across the ground at the sudden stop while going\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; 100 MPH.  He transformed while still moving, his biped mode crashing to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; ground, the War Machine jumping up quickly, jogging for Chaos.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chaos had four more missiles armed, but transformed to biped mode, a\n&gt; &gt; double-tubed rocket launcher in hand.  He lowered it, looking to Minion\nas\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; approached him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This may be interesting.&quot; he laughed, charging his optic weapons to\nfull\n&gt; &gt; power if he needed to open fire quickly and take people down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis was only a few meters from Blades and First Aid, but stopped his\n&gt; &gt; crawl when he saw two other Protectobots run over to their comrades.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Slag...it.&quot; he coughed, looking up to see Scattershot land by him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vehement cursed at FZ&#39;s order.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Cowards.  That Warrior of Light shall not survive-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He walked over to the opened part of the bridge, seeing Reflector and\nSun\n&gt; &gt; Crusher heading for him.  The cannons on the ends of his arms took the\n&gt; forms\n&gt; &gt; of hands once more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unitron landed on his feet, rather happy with the deal FZ had made.  His\n&gt; &gt; plans hadn&#39;t been disrupted in the slightest.  It had in fact saved him\n&gt; &gt; trouble.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He nodded to Firestarter.  &quot;Stand down.  We will get what we want either\n&gt; way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firestarter gave a crooked grin.  &quot;Excellent.  I hope Shockwave fairs as\n&gt; well\n&gt; &gt; in his mission.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
