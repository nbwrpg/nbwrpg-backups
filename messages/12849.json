Waspinator stood behinde him at the doors \nslid open and they stepped out to eradicate the pesky Maximal.\n    &quot;Waspinator, go and attack from above, I will flank his position. Fire on \nmy signal!&quot; He commanded to the insect, already in motion. Megatron pulled \nout his tail gun and was heading to flank the Maximal, but spied the pod and \nthe others by it. This was his territory and that was his pod.\n    He lept into the air and his thrusters started. He jetted through the sky \nand landed smack down on the pod. &quot;I belive this pod is mine, and \ntresspassing is punishable by death! Turn it over now and leave or die!&quot;\n\n    Aracnia approached Quickstrike. She had a very important mission for him. \n&quot;Quickstrike, Hell Beast&#39;s data disks say there is an alien device deep \nwithin the southwestern jungles, in a trench. Its a good distance away but I \nhave to know what it is. Take Venomus and Solo with you. But, I can send \nGrappler, Aerostreak, and Guantix to help you if needed.&quot; She said in one \nquick breath.\n    \n    Tarantulas paced. He was bored out of his insane mind. Anything was \nbetter than this, even serving Black Aracnia.\n    &quot;Atma! Tell Black Aracnia that I&#39;ll serve her. I cant take this \nimprisonment any longer!&quot;\n\n"}}
