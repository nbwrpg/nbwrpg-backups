I believe those chars are still \nyours. \n&gt; And you may make another char since the char limit is ten. \n&gt; &gt; To the rest of the RPG. I know that you all know the limit to be \n&gt; eight. There hasn&#39;t been an official announcement, but Rudra and I \n&gt; agreed to make it ten. \n&gt; &gt; The preceding has been paid for by the \n&gt; &gt; New World Order \n&gt; &gt;  &quot;CatMaster o &lt;catmastero@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote: Okay, \nI \n&gt; kinda got lost for awhile but I&#39;m gonna try and get back in. \n&gt; &gt; So are Inferno, Quickstrike, Waspinator and Kenzo still mine or \nhave\n&gt; &gt; they been given away?
