This is an RPG board, not a general discussion board. If you want to discus something, do it over private email or on the message board on the site.\n\nI don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the completely pointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great RPer. Now shut up and take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. The moment I see a char with even a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, you&#39;ll regret it. In adition, stop moding. You can&#39;t make other people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for Mustex even attempting to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you have no part in the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no logical way of knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to have them have that insight. Either explain how they know or drop that storyline. It makes no sence. Also, you never even landed that lowlife seller or whatever of yours on the planet, and I&#39;m not going to write your profiles for you. Shape up. Read the rules and act by them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting on every post. The council will catch it if its moding.\n\nEveryone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t post at all. I&#39;m very sick of coming home from work and reading through 100 or so damn OOC posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who sends an OOC ever again. I won&#39;t, but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the verge of turning into a very mean person.\n\nFrom now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the site&#39;s message board. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of it, as I said like 10 times already in this post.\n\nThere. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC messages stop. Its very hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all this pointless crap is starting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n"}}
