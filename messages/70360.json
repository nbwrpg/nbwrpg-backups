In fact Rodimus&#39; form cannot be truly seen, as he&#39;s covered\nhead to foot in them, however every scan confirms that he is indeed in\nthere somewhere. Scans also reveal that although he is healthy, he is\nundergoiong his own ordeal, something left over from the insects. Time\nis of the essence to get him back and repaired.\n\nAs the party makes it way back to the Ark they can hear several\nexplosions behind them, the walls rumbling around them but so far\nnothing seems to inhibit their travel.\n\nMeanwhile back at the Ark Lord Elder was there at the headquarters,\napparently he had not taken any time for rest or even to eat, instead\nhe manned the communicatyion station waiting for any word.\n\n&quot;We read you Tuscon!&quot; Elder said as the call came in. &quot;We will have\nmedical staff standing by when you get here.&quot; Elder manipulated a few\ncontrols as he spoke, &quot;and the shield is up and waiting for your\nentrance.&quot;\n\nElder turned back to Kup and just smiled broadly, &quot;They&#39;re alive!&quot; he\nsaid, nearly leaping out his chair with happniness.\n\nIt takes Tuscon hours of driving, but finally Tuscon arrives at an\nopening, a final break in the long monotony of near featureless\nsmoothly tunneled walls. They at long last arrive at an opening to a\nrather deep pit.\n\nThe pit is very deep and very dark and it seems to go on for a very\nlong time. It is roughly 8-10 feet and looking down it runs nearly\nstraight down into the depths of the earth; even with artificial\nlight, its end point cannot be seen as it continued into the darkness\nbelow. However looking up, several hundred feet up a tiny pinprick of\nlight can be seen, it is the surface! However to reach the top one\nwould need to be able to fly or have extremely good climbing\nabilities, as there are no hand holds and not even a single plant\nbreaks the surface of the walls lining this area, the sides are\nextremely smooth and sheer,\nalmost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam. .\n\nFrom beneath Tuscon&#39;s position heat and noxious fumes rise from below,\nclearly show the danger of failing to climb or fly properly and\nplunging into the super heated depths. It would be a grizzly end\nindeed.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
