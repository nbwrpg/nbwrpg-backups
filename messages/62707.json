Take the panels down and melt them down and install the\n&gt; new ones as fast as you can without sacrificing structural integrity.

I think it would be\n&gt; a good idea just to melt down this entire pannel and make a new one,\n&gt; that way we will be sure to have enough metal....and the whole thing\n&gt; will be much stronger.... Assuming you have no problems with me\n&gt; removing the damaged panels?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron looked like he enjoyed this work very much, almost too much.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!
