I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s wise. Last time Hell Beast&#39;s group made an\noffensive, they attacked the Maximals. Both us and the Alliance\n&#39;aided&#39; the Maximals against Hell Beast. The Maximals are probably mad\nat him, and letting them be mad at him could give us a big advantage,\nkeeping them off our backs and on Hell Beast&#39;s. Plus, if the Alliance\nis aiding the Maximals, and we&#39;re supposedly on good terms with them,\nwe might as well keep low in case they aid the Maximals again.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok.
