He will be unavailable for \nsome time, he&#39;ll be attending some gladiator event or something. He was \ntrying to get an arrangement with Zardus, leader of the Alliance and said he \nwould recommend us to him.\n\nBelthassan:\nHaha! Old friend! You haven&#39;t changed at all! Always trying to prove you are \nthe best! Well, for the Tripredacus and the Matrix, I widh you luck!\n\nMelchana:\nYeah, but maybe his mercenary act is going to get him killed... Too much \nenemies means you never miss some fun, but sooner or later, he will be done \nfor good!\n\nGesper:\nSo what do we do? Do we work for Zardus for some time?\n\nBelthassan:\nPerhaps... (he thinks for a bit) Gesper, you will stay here to establish the \nperimeter defenses. Get the shield online and reconfigure the surrounding \ntechno-organic vegetation so it can provide us with some defensive \nfirepower. Melchana, connect the shield&#39;s absoring devices to the Shadow \nDestiny&#39;s generator. I&#39;ll be looking at the tactical emplacement of the base \nand bring modifications to the orders I gave if need be. Gesper, if Zardus \nsends a message, relay it to me in top priority. He is likely to be an ally \nto us in this war. If he wants our assistance, I will go along with \nMelchana.\n\nThe two others acknowledge their orders, Melchana hoping that Zardus will \ncall soon...\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
