Yeah, you&#39;re r=\r\night, there is an intruder here, and two blips, one familliar, Maximal like=\r\n us, and one that&#39;s reading unfamilliar, could be pred or con, or even Mini=\r\non...

I&#39;ve worke=\r\nd with the control box \n&gt; before and about this bomb, I haven&#39;t defused one=\r\n in a long time but I do \n&gt; know how to. It&#39;s a good thing I paid attention=\r\n in the technological \n&gt; training sessions.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He climbs up to the contr=\r\nol box, and gently opens the door, via a manual \n&gt; button on the side.  He =\r\nlooks at the inner workings and assesses what needs \n&gt; to be done.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh=\r\n boy..  Okaaay, well, here&#39;s what I think guys..  The wiring appears to \n&gt; =\r\nhave been altered somewhat, which means whoever our intruder is, is rather =\r\n\n&gt; skilled in this field.  But, it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t falter.  I overhea=\r\nrd \n&gt; Tucson talking about trying to disrupt this with a sonar wave, and \n&gt;=\r\n truthfully, I think it&#39;s our best shot. After that, I can get to the bomb =\r\n\n&gt; and stop it from going off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, there ya have=\r\n it Leo ll.  It&#39;s up ta the boss ta step in first.  I \n&gt; hope he&#39;s close.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the Ark, Tucson now finds himself within range to execute the =\r\nsonar \n&gt; disruption plan.  He begins to transmit while enroute.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All r=\r\night, Tucson to Rodimus, and Legacy.  I am within range and \n&gt; transmitting=\r\n now.  You should begin to see a disruption in the Ark&#39;s systems \n&gt; in the =\r\nform of static and audio interference.  Once you see that, it&#39;s time \n&gt; to =\r\nmove in and quickly regain control of the mainframe.   This should also \n&gt; =\r\nbring our enemy out of hiding, once realizing what is happening. It will be=\r\n \n&gt; your opportunity to seize and immobilize him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap senses the=\r\n wave.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Owww, Wheels, is it supposed ta hurt our ears?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson si=\r\nghs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry Rat Trap, I know, I did not have time to configure a sa=\r\nftey buffer \n&gt; for the transmission.  I appologize for any pain any of you =\r\nfeel, and now \n&gt; suggest that all of you turn off your audio sensors now.  =\r\nThat goes for you \n&gt; as well, Rodimus, Legacy, everyone.  This transmission=\r\n is going to cause \n&gt; more than just a mild disruption, it may also cause y=\r\nou moderate to severe \n&gt; discomfort.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sonar wave gains in strength,=\r\n as Rat Trap does as told.  The ground \n&gt; beneath them begins to vibrate wi=\r\nth the transmission yet, Tucson seems to \n&gt; continue driving over it at a s=\r\nteady speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift steadies himself on the shakey ground beneath=\r\n his tires.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Woahh, that&#39;s some heavy sonar you&#39;re puttn&#39; out big guy.=\r\n.  Let&#39;s hope this \n&gt; works.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson knew he would have to amplify the=\r\n wave.  He now activates his built \n&gt; in amplifiers to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Get re=\r\nady, I&#39;m amplifying the transmission.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Upon doing that, the ground vib=\r\nrates just a tad more.
