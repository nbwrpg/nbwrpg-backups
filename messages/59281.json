I may be one of\nthem- even yours!&quot;\n\nProfile: Shadowcaster was originally built by the\nQuintessons (back when the quints were still\nmanufacturing Autobots and Decepticons as a wholesale\ncommodity) as a prototype of what was to be their\nfinest accomplishment- the ultimate\nassassin/intelligence robot.  \n\nVirtually unstoppable at the time, his strength and\nphysical prowess were unmatched by any Decepticon ever\ncreated.  His name comes from his model name-\nShadowcaster.  The reason for this designation, was\nbecause he and all others of the class of robots that\nwere to go into main production were designed to be\nmanufactured with a then state of the art cloaking\ndevice, and stealth jamming system- rendering them \nundetectable till they choose to reveal themselves.  \n\nThe Quintessons had created - in him - the perfect\nmilitary robot to sell off to their clients, or so it\nseemed.  However, there was a &#39;flaw&#39; in his program-\nShadowcaster not only possessed emotions but also the\nsoul of a noble samurai- something that would\nessentially ruin their latest creation.\n\nShadowcaster was aware of their intentions, however\njust like a true samurai, he was unable to a stop\nthem.  \n\nHowever before the Quintessons could correct the\n&#39;glitch&#39;, they fell foul of the uprising led by Alpha\nTrion, in which Shadowcaster was a more than willing\nparticipant.  Shadowcaster soon discovered something\nwhich he found he immensely liked- peace.  In true\nsamurai tradition, he decided then and there, that it\nwas his obligation to maintain the peace and to\nprotect the weak (mainly the Autobots).\n\nHowever, nothing - including peace - lasts forever. \nIt wasn&#39;t long before the warring instincts of the\nother Decepticons found an outlet- the Autobots, and\nultimately, the universe.  When the war started up,\nShadowcaster decided then and there, that he could no\nlonger remain a Decepticon and maintain his beliefs-\nand so he chose the later: secretly swearing\nallegiance to the Autobots, as well as an oath to\nprotect them from his fellow Decepticons, as he views\nthem as innocents- unprepared for war. He starts\nmiraculously appearing in battle after battle,\ncontinually saving the Autobots- only to then\ndisappear into the shadows. A legend soon sprung up- a\nlegend which brought hope to the Autobots, and fear to\nthe Decepticons.\n\n\nHowever, there were a some who knew that his existence\nwas real- one of those being Alpha Trion; the other\nStraxus- when Shadowcaster revealed himself to him-\nbefore permanently taking him offline.  After the\nsecond war, Shadowcaster&#39;s friendship with Alpha Trion\ngrew.  In that time, Shadowcaster learned a great deal\nabout the sciences, and became a skilled doctor and\nprogrammer.  However, he insisted that Alpha Trion,\nnot reveal his existence, as there was always the\npossibility  that the Decepticons might find another\nStraxus, and begin a new war.\n\nSure enough, he was right.  Only this time the\nDecepticons could not only fly, but they were\nstronger, better armoured and more powerful than ever\nbefore.  Shadowcaster saw the writing on the wall, and\ninsisted that Alpha Trion assist him in developing a\nreconstruction process for the Autobots.  For as much\nas he hated to admit it, this was one war which he\ncould not win alone.  They commenced the project in\nearnest- with Shadowcaster making Alpha Trion keep his\nexistence still as a secret.\n\nIt was not long however, that the first of the new\nAutobots would come about.  Shadowcaster saw Alpha\nTrion bring the almost lifeless body of Orion Pax in,\nknowing instinctively that he was someone special.  So\nthat Shadowcaster could work unseen, Alpha Trion\ninsisted that the Aerialbots remain outside.  In the\nmonths that followed, they successfully rebuilt\nnumerous Autobots, with none aware that they owed\ntheir continued existence to two Autobots- not just\none.\n\nNot long after, he had Alpha Trion make all the\nnecessary modifications on him, so that he could\ndestroy these new Decepticons as easily as he had the\nolder ones.  He then recommenced (in secret) his\nactive role in the war.  During the time that the\nAutobots were still on Cybertron, he destroyed several\nDecepticon super weapons and killed off many would be\nassassins, with noone but Alpha Trion knowing of his\nexistence.\n\nAfter the Autobots left on the voyage that would\nultimately bring both them and the Decepticons to\nEarth, Shadowcaster began waging his one man war on\nthe Decepticons more intensely than ever, inflicting\none punishing raid on the Decepticons after another-\nnothing large enough to finish them, just enough to\ngreatly aid the small number of Autobots left behind.\n\nDuring the events of &#39;The Heavy Metal War&#39; he sneaked\naboard the space bridge and travelled to Earth after\noverhearing a transmission from Megatron to Shockwave,\nand, after reaching the Ark, used a backdoor code into\none of his greatest creations- Teletran One - to\nreconfigure himself into a more Earth-like form (using\nthe configuration that would later be used on the\nAutobot Tracks), then creating false security logs,\nand storing the real ones in an area of it&#39;s memory\nnot accessible to any other Autobot.  After that time\nhe continued his one man war- both on Cybertron and\nEarth.\n\nHowever, by 2005, the Decepticons had taken over all\nof Cybertron, forcing him to change his tactics. Being\ncareful not to reveal the true extent of his powers,\nhe joined the Decepticons again- only this time as a\nwell planted spy- relaying what information when he\ncould, while still remaining anonymous. During the\nattack by Unicron, Shadowcaster disappeared into the\nshadows....... \n\nAfter the planet was liberated due to the attack on\nCybertron, he went back into the shadows, observing\nRodimus Prime&#39;s actions and helping where he could. \nAt the end of the third great war, he came out from\nhiding and joined one of the numerous teams of\nAutobots who were responsible for hunting down the\nDecepticons and bring them to justice one way or\nanother.\n\nHowever, with the end of the signing of the Pax\nCybertronia he found himself out of place, deep down\nwanting a peaceful existence, but the warrior in him\nbeing ever vigilant- convinced that it was only a\nmatter of time before the Decepticons returned to\ntheir former ways in the same numbers as from the\npast. At the same time though, in this time of peace\nhe felt like an anachronism, a guardian with no need\nto guard those he was sworn to protect.  Begrudgingly,\nhe found himself undergoing the great upgrade and\nreverting to the role of scientist, at which he found\nhe excelled. However, his latent abilities could not\ncurb his latent fear that the Decepticons or their\ndecendants would rise up again and strike the moment\nhe let his guard down.  \n\nAs things would turn out he found himself as part of\none of the many science exploration voyages to\nnumerous different worlds.  It was on this voyage that\nhe would meet a bot that would change everything in\nhis life a female Maximal by the name of Phoenix. \nPhoenix and Shadowcaster formed a kinship almost\nimmediately, with him being drawn to her youthful\ninnocence and hope-filled outlook, and her being drawn\nto this weary battered soul.  At first things were\nawkard when they talked of times past or things\nstarted to become intimate, with Shadowcaster\nwithdrawing, unable to let his guard down, having\nwitnessed too much over the millions of years in the\nshadows, and feeling the weight of too much blood on\nhis hands for those whose lives he had ended. Phoenix\nsensed his pain internally, however she persitsted,\ndetermined to to break through to the bot she knew he\nwas inside.  On the night of what seemed like the\nperfect day to end the perfect cycle, she finally\nbroke through, and he sobbed mech fluid uncontrollably\nfor over an hour, finally letting go of his demons,\nPhoenix holding him and comforting him the entire\ntime.  It was then that he experienced one of the\ngreatest miracles in the universe, he fell in love.  \nFrom that day onward, he went from strength to\nstrength, healing more and more as the days went on,\neven starting to forgive himself for his sins during\nthe war, they even procreated life in the form of\nthree offspring, one who would be later known as\nRattrap.  For the next few years, things were perfect,\nand for the second time in his life, Shadowcaster was\ntruly at peace. However, it was soon after this that\nwould not be long before an ambitious and war\nmongering Predacon would raid and steal the\npersonality chip of the most dangerous Decepticon ever\nto exist: Megatron.\n\nWhen he heard the knews of the rise of Megatron,\nShadowcaster was on edge, verging on the point of\nparanoia, however Phoenix reassured him they had\nnothing to worry about, mostly out of a youthful sense\nof naivette. Shadowcaster after all had witnessed\npeace for so long and felt that security on Cybertron\nwould be upto the task.\n\nSoon after this, Megatron recruited some of the worst\nPredacons in existence by means of a breakin and\nbreakout of a Cybertronian maximum security prison,\nthen decided to teach the ruling Maximal governing\ncouncil on Cybertron a lesson by randomly obliterating\nthe maximal science teams on the neumerous planets\nthroughout the galaxy- their first target would turn\nout to be the very team that Shadowcaster was a member\nof.\n\nIt was a sunny, clear skied, perfect day that day.\nShadowcaster had decided to go on a scouting mission a\nfew hours north of camp to observe  the growth in\npopulation of the newly dominant species on that\nplanet. He was half an hour away from the base when he\nheard the massive explosions which took out the base&#39;s\nshield generators and ripped a massive gaping hole\nthrough the center of its hull.  Knowing instantly\nwhat it could only mean he raced back there as fast as\nhe could, bearly overloading his servos in the\nprocess.\nNothing could have prepared him for what he saw when\nhe returned, with most of his team mates dismembered\nbeyond the point of repair, their sparks extinguished.\n\n\nHis mind started racing, as he rushed all over the\nbase looking for her. He found her in the CR Chamber\narea, mech fluid gushing, and clearly looking like she\nwas not going to make it, as she lay over another\nsmall bot that Shadowcaster couldn&#39;t quite make out. \nHe transformed and held her in his arms, begging her\nto hang on, feeling like he was about to break in two\nat the very sight of her in that state.  She kept\nsaying how she was sorry and that she couldn&#39;t save\nthem, then begging him to hold on to the light. All he\ncould do was beg her to stay- it was then that her\nspark extinguished.  \n\nThrity seconds later, the Predacon who Megatron had\nleft behind to take care of any scouts who had been in\nthe field stumbled upon him.  It was then that the\nprogrammijng that the Quintessons originally tried to\ninstall in him took over, as he moved at blight speed,\nripping the would be killer&#39;s limbs off violently and\nat mach speed. The Predacon begged Shadowcaster for\nmercy, at which point he was told that he would\nreceive the mercy that scum like him deserve.  The\nscream which the hapless Predacon gave out as he was\nsavaged to death rang out for miles like a symphony of\ndeath resonating through a concert hall.\n\nIt was when he went to pick up Phoenix that he noticed\nthe bot she had been trying to protect- their son\nRattrap- he was in stasis lock and severely damaged,\nbut he would live. Not wasting an instant,\nShadowcaster placed him in the nearest working CR\nChamber and then repaired the base enough to get a\ndistress beacon working.\n\nBlaming himself for the incident due to him letting\nhis guard down, Shadowcaster vowed to never allow\nhimself the luxury of peace ever again. He returned to\na secret life in the shadows, secretly augmenting\nhimself once more for combat, and resuming the one man\nwar he once fought against the Predacons. However,\nthings had now changed, this time around he blamed the\nMaximals and the Autobots for allowing the Predacons\nthe oportunity to exist, viewing th Pax Cybertronia as\na slap in the face to all those that the Decepticons\nand their decendants had caused pain to over the eons.\nSoon after the attacks on the colonies, Shadowcaster\ncaught wind of Megatron&#39;s plan to steal the Golden\ndisk.  At this, Shadowcaster raided a top secret\nweapons factory storing as many high powered and\nlethal weapons as he could in subspace, then, after\nrigging the flight control computers in Iacon command\nso that the Axalon would be the only ship capable of\ncatching up with the rogue Predacons, then replacing\none of the protoform filled stasis pods on board the\nAxalon with and empty one modified by him to design\nspecifications which he pre programmed into the\nscanning program., which he then boarded.\n\nHe awoke after the quantum surge, then a transmetal\nPanther with a third tank mode and a psychotic\ndisposition towards the Predacons, and a cold\nresolution to remove any obstacles in his path to\ntheir eradication.  After losing a major battle with\nMegatron not long after he landed, Shadowcaster\ndecided there was only one weapon that he could use to\novercome Megatron- the Autobot Matrix of leadership. \nHe then began a quest from Africa to North America,\nfinally reaching his destination. Getting past\nTeletran 1 was easy, after all, it was his creation.\nFinding his was to Optimus Prime&#39;s stasis filled body,\nhe quickly removed the matrix, and took tis power for\nhis own.  However, what resulted was the last thing he\nexpected- as he found hiself confronted with his own\ndemons and ghosts, and forced to find true peace. He\nawoke 4 times his post upgrade size, with a blending\nof his original G1 form and his Maximal form, and with\neverything in balance for the first time in his life.\n\nHowever, before he returned the Matrix, he knew there\nwas one more thing he had to do- pass on its power to\nOptimus Primal, resulting in the birth of Optimal\nOptimus. They then returned to the Ark, and restored\norder to it, while at the same time, upgrading\ndefences, to stop any attempt at temporal sabotage by\nmegatron.\n\nOver the course of the next year, they went from\nstrength to strength, until Megatron showed his trump\ncard, the Nemesis.  Knowing that if nothing was done,\nthe Maximals, and perhaps the Autobots and humans\nwould be destroyed and history forever altered,\nShadocaster launched a successful frontal assault\nagainst the nemesis, severely crippling it, however,\nthe attack resulted in the destrustion of his life. \n\nFinding himself in the Allspark, he now spends what he\nexpects to be the rest of eternity in peace.  However,\nlife doesn&#39;t always turn out as we plan it.....\n\nAbilities: Shadowcaster&#39;s name comes from his\nincredible cloaking device, which allows him to move\naround unseen and undetected by all tracking systems\nin any of his three forms.  In addition, he is\nequipped with a low powered anti gravity system,\nallowing him to hover just far enough off the ground\nso as not to leave any tracks. He has a communications\narray which contains a broadband scrambler system,\ncapable of scrambling all communications up to a 10km\nradius. \n\nHis large, TM3 (think Optimal Optimus) size also\nbelies incredible speed and agility, and his\nsttrenghth is such that he is capable of lifting up to\n60 tonnes.  A superb marksman- contains telescoping\noptic sensors, allowing him to lock onto a hex nut\nfrom 3km away.  In jet mode, can attain speeds of up\nto mach 1.5 at a ceiling of 10km, while in Panther\nmode he is capable of reaching speeds of 150km/h and\n500km/h in land assault mode. In all three modes, has\naccess to twin corrosion missile launchers- which\ncontain warheads filled with sulfuric acid.  In jet\nand robot modes, carries an electro disruptor, which\nfries the electronics of anything it hits. In robot\nmode, he is also equipped with two retractable wrist\nblades that extend out to a length of 2m.\n\nWeaknesses: Shadowcasters only real weakness is that\nthose that know of him, know of him only as a legend-\nif he ever actually were to get in real trouble, his\ncomrades wouldn&#39;t even know of him, also,\nShadowcasters beliefs on the combat skill of the\naverage Autobot make him resistant to ever ask for\nassistance- however, the possibility of that ever\nhappening is extremely remote. \n\nGM Note: A gift which Shadowcaster will receive from\nPrimus after Primus briefs him, is a weapon of my own\ncreation called a Lock pistol, which is the\ntransformer equivalent of a blowpipe with knockout\ndarts. What is shoot the target with a tight beam\ntransmission, which contains a computer virus which\nnot only overrides the victim&#39;s system and activates\nstasis lock, but to keep them there, it makes a\nconnection between two major components in a medium\nlevel, but non critical system (the virus is designed\nto analyse and determine which system will be the\nideal choice) go open circuit. Its purpose complete,\nthe virus then destroys both itself and any trace of\nitself which may have been used to create an\nantivirus.  The effects of the virus can be countered\nafter stasis lock, by either a well trained medic\nwhich located the tricked up away and restores the\nconnection, or by a very short spell in the CR\nchamber, as in no longer than 30 seconds.  The main\npurpose of this weapon will be for use on nightstalk,\nhowever, in cases of emergency, Shadowcaster may\nresort to using this gun.\n\nhttp://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
