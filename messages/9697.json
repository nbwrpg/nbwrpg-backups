She cursed when she saw no one \nattempting to fix them.\n    &quot;Computer, bring all systems online.&quot; Aracnia said, taking a seat in the \ncommand chair.\n    &quot;Unable to respond. Invaders have tampered with schedual and procedure \nprotocols.&quot; The computer chirped.\n    Black Aracnia paused for a moment, and then opened a compartment on the \narm of the command chair. Hell Beast left disks on the numerous functions of \nthe ship, and tips on what to do in emergency. Aracnia went through them \nquickly until she found the system diagnostic. It would get the computer back \nup and running.\n    She inserted the disk and it went to work quickly. The stillness of the \nbridge was filled with the hum of the computers and mainframe coming online. \nBlack Aracnia smiled, leaned back in the chair, and was now going to take \ncare of the invaders.\n\n    Adrax fired his gappling gun at Terrorsaur, and sent two optic blasts at \nKitkat. He manuvered around the sky,trying to hit as many targets as he could.\n\n    Black Aracnia, while looking at the computer monitors, &quot; Computer, bring \nall Autoguns online, and initiate the shiled at Maximum Power.&quot;\n    The computer did so, and within a moment the Autoguns flew to life, \nshooting at Megatrons group, as well as Adrax and Autofire who they didnt \nreconize as Predacons.\n    &quot;Excellent. Now, for the intruders inside....&quot;She said, bringing over a \nkeyboard and an interactive map of the ship.\n    She began to type in codes for various sections of the ships internal \ndefences. She spotted the two intruders and sent the internal defences on \nthem. The corriodr they were in snapped shut, the ventilation system hissed \nclosed, and several small canon extend from the ceiling. Black Aracnia smiled \nbecause they had just walked into there own tomb.\n    &quot;Computer, close hatch and lock down the entire ship. I dont want anyone \nelse getting in.&quot;\n    The computer did so. All the doors on the ship closed. The shafts for air \nsnapped shut, and all the canon extended and prepared to fire. And, for a \nlast fitch effort in case anyone somehow got though, Black Aracnia orders a \nforce seven sheilding on all doors and corridor entrances, including the \nhatch. The ship was inpenetrable all thanks to Black Aracnia....who was \nthinking of who should be in charge of the fraction.\n\n"}}
