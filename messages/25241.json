But at leats \nwe didn&#39;t have to eat MRE&#39;s every day in the army! Disgusting things. \nThey all tasted the same.. even if they were labeled to be different \nflavours&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor drew slightly back at Carnage&#39;s question. What was it like \nto be loved by a family? Wow.. she had never been asked something \nlike that before, and had never really thought about it either.\n\n&quot;Uh.. I guess it&#39;s.. nice?&quot; She offered lamely, then shoek her head \nat her own patheticness. &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s kinda a difficult question. \nWell, it was nice, to be loved, I mean. To know that your Father and \nMother were there when you got home from hanging out with your \nfriends. Knowing they&#39;ll support you wherever you go..&quot;\n\nHer eyes glazed over, and she stayed silent for a few seconds, arms \nto crossed across her chest. &quot;But you can get in big fights. I got in \na few with my Dad.. but never my Mum&quot; She shrugged.\n\n&quot;As I said.. it&#39;s nice&quot; She grinned.\n\n\n"}}
