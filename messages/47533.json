I would like to \n&gt; thank all the people who petitioned my sentence be rethought (my \ntime \n&gt; ran out) and I would like to apologize to Hugar, I never said it, \nbut \n&gt; I suspected my early inability to post was a matter of him \n&gt; remoderating me without telling anyone after rAuq demoderated me \n&gt; until he could twist everyone who agreed to have a char in the \n&gt; faction I&#39;m starting after the restart into not joining. Also when \nI \n&gt; was moderated I posted Turntail and Legacy dieing and put them on \nthe \n&gt; Matrix list before I realized I was moderated.\n\n\n"}}
