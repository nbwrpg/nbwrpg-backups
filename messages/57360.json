He would have to talk to \nPerceptor later about informing him of things before hand. On the \nother hand it was, perhaps, a tactful decision. Hydras might have \nsimply blasted the bot earlier.\n\n&quot;Wolfenstein. The foolish bot returns from his escapade with \nfailure... I should melt you to scrap right now for your insolent \nbehaviour, but I have a better idea.&quot; a small smile catches the \nedges of Hydras&#39; mouth.\n\n&quot;Maxima dear, begin work on the Blackstrom clone.&quot; Hydras says with \na short glance back at the female predacon. &quot;Implant a virus into \nthe clone to lay dormant until they try to reformat the Blackstorm \nclone and return her to Nightlight.&quot;\n\nThe Predacon commander turns back to the newly returned \nWolfenstein. &quot;Ah yes, now for your part. It is your job to escort \nthe clone on a recon mission which vectors nearest to the Maximal \nbase. I&#39;m sure their sensors will pick you up. It will be your job \nto make sure the clone gets into their hands safely, and I don&#39;t \nmean just hand it to them. Make it real, trick them.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, and one more thing.&quot; Hydras&#39;s hand slides into his arm and a \nspiked semi-sphere forms around his hand - Hydras Fusion Cannon - \nand points it at the new but old Predacon. (The cannon does not \nalways fire at full strength, just in case you&#39;re wondering if \nhydras is willing to level his base to get back at wolfy =p)\n\n&quot;Perceptor,&quot; He tosses a small explosive device to the other \nbot, &quot;Insert this at the back of Wolfenstein&#39;s neck.&quot; He turns to \nWolfy, &quot;If you disobey, you will never disobey again.&quot;\n\nPerceptor moves towards Wolfenstein following Hydras commands.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; OOC: SharpClaw is a Predacon, already, at this time. He was out \nwith KitKat when she was taken in by the Maximals for medical aid. \nWolfenstein was a Pred but defected to the nWo. Now that the nWo is \ngone he wishes to return.\n&gt;  \n&gt; : : SharpClaw/Wolfenstein : :\n&gt; \n&gt; SharpClaw and Wolfenstein follow Perceptor in to meat with Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first issue would be Wolfenstein&#39;s return to the Predacons. \nSharpClaw would then have to inform Hydras of KitKat&#39;s wherabouts.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
