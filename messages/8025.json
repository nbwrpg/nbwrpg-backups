Still, Dark One WAS lying \nin a puddle of his own fluid, and there was only one &#39;bot in the\nworld \nshe new of who could act this casual after slagging someone. \n\nWith a sigh of relief Tavatron sheathed her sword and jumped off the \ntable, landing with a soft thud beside Dinobot. Her optics were still \ndamaged, but other than that she was in as good of shape as any &#39;bot \nwho had been bombarded by weapons fire and threatened with torture. \nThe relief to see Dinobot was clearly written on her face, though her \nvoice sounded otherwise:\n\n&quot;You know, one of these days your going to get yourself killed. By\nthe \nMatrix what were you thinking?! This mission is suicide! Primus, you \ncould STILL get killed!&quot;\n\nTavatron snarled softly, a small groan escaping her lips. She wasn&#39;t \nangry, and finally her relief did get the better of her. She was glad \nhe had come for her, deep down she was afraid no one was ever going\nto \ncome. In a moment she may soon come to regret Tavatron threw her arms \naround Dinobot&#39;s neck. He may despise physical contact, but at that \nmoment she really didn&#39;t care:\n\n&quot;Primus, am I glad to see you.&quot;\n\nHer voice was filled with relief as she removed her arms from around \nhis neck. She looked up at him, her fur was still singed and\nblackened \nin some places, but her internal repairs had managed to fix the \nmajority of damage. She then remembered that she had not been the\nonly \nprisoner in the room, and quickly turned to search for Iron Raptor. \nFinding that she was not present in the room, Tavatron turned back to \nDinobot, a puzzled expression on her face:\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s Iron Raptor?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
