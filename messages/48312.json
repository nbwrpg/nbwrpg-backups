Examining it slowly his optics widened as\nthe system specks were rather...unique...for a predicon. Shifting and moving\nfrom behind the console the bot moved to the CR chamber and pushed the\nrelease switch.\n\n    As the chamber door slid upwards he noted the predicon was both awake\nand waiting, he had expected some resistance but then again considering her\nconfiguration it wasn&#39;t a big surprise. &quot;My name is Talos and you are now a\nguest of the Maximals.&quot;\n\n    Nightshade looked at Talos and shrugged, moving out of the chamber\nlooking up at him, &quot;Nightshade, you really should do something about that\nbird bot of yours. Even we know what white flag conditions mean.&quot;\n\n    Talos tilted his head, Sunhawk hadn&#39;t mentioned that his prisoner had\nbeen taken while under truce conditions. Sighing he shrugged, &quot;It changes\nvery little I assume you were looking for something and I want to know\nwhat.&quot; He said gruffly indicating the fem bot should walk before him from\nthe room.\n\n    Walking out Nightshade wasn&#39;t suprised to hear the soft click of a\nreadied weapon behind her. &quot;I came seeking the maximal leader of this troop,\nI have business to discuss with him or her. Mind escorting me to your leader\nrather than the brig?&quot;\n\n    Talos chuckled the nozzle of the pistol prodding her back, &quot;Well state\nyour business, you&#39;ve met him.&quot;\n\n    Nightshade turned looking at Talos skepticly, &quot;How do I know you&#39;re\ntelling the truth, the current example of maximals in this troop have been\nless than honorable...&quot; Her voice dropped low her tone almost insulting.\n&quot;Besides what I need to discuss has to be done away from prying optics and\nsensors. Know a place?&quot;\n\n    Talos nodded grimly indicating the direction towards the bridges ready\nroom, an office of sorts for commanders of a ship. Putting away the pistol\nboth Talos and Nightshade moved to the room.\n\n\n"}}
