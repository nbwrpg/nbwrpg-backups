However, from \nScattershot&#39;s earlier attack he had obtained a slight amount of damage just \nbelow his left shoulder-plate. Which ment that he had fought.\nHowever, there seemed to have been reported a life at stake, so he had no \nchoice other then that to cease his actions and go to the commander&#39;s call. \nThough, he did not have to like it!\nDinobot growled and scanned the battlefield, not only for the commander&#39;s \nlocation but for Tavatron&#39;s as well. Surely she had recieved the same \ntransmission and might be on her way. But if she was trying to defeat an \nenemy, he might be of assistance to her...as he always was before.**\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
