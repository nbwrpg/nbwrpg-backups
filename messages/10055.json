Now was time for repair and rest, for both of them.\nThough, she knew that she could nearly faint with relief. Glad as the Matrix to be away from such an awful place as the Alliance and back into the welcoming arms she loved so much, Prowls.\nIron Raptor listened to him speak: Their new base?\nHer optics looked over the huge base with excited wonder, just dreaming of what sort of weapons if held in its Holds, what power it had.\nA smile creeping across her lips as she listened to Prowl explain how well the shields had held, thinking of just how this ship could increase their chances of winning the Beast Wars!\nIron Raptor then looked back towards Prowl as he slipped his arm around her waist, also enjoying the feel of him against her.\nShe noticed his damage but knew that he could take care of it, after all, he WAS a Transmetal 2�with his own built-in instant repair system. Though, still a bit concerned.\nLooking into Prowls eyes as he looked into hers she relaxed a bit more, knowing that she was safe from anything as long as she was with him. Her own love for him showing in the depths of her own optics.\nHearing him explain where she would be bunked and a little tinge of excitement and surprise felt when he explained that it would be HIS quarters she would be staying in, then a little disappointment when she heard him say that he would find another place to sleep while she stayed in her room.\nShe obeyed his tugging as he walked towards the Cybertronien Fire, both of them soon to enter their new home.\nIron Raptor slightly leaned against Prowl and feeling his warmth.*\n\n� Who ever said you had to find somewhere else to sleep?�\n\n* She asked while she grinned and gave him a sly glance, tightening her hold on his waist for a moment but then relaxing her grip. Half joking but half not. Loving the idea of having him so close in her sleeping hours as well as her waking.\nBut then Prowl asked her if she needed a CR chamber and she nodded, knowing  how damaged she really was. There was no point in hiding it , mainly because it couldn�t be hid.\nIron Raptor let out a breath just before she spoke.*\n\n� Yeah. But it seems to me that a certain knight in shining armor needs a little R &R himself, having rescued a damsel in distress and all.�\n\n* She smiled at him. Actually proud of him and what he had done, though, expecting no less from the bot she loved and would do the same for.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
