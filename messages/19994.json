Slayer seemed to know this. Pride\n&gt; &gt; seemed to be the only reason this fight continued. Lunarpine \nrefused\n&gt; &gt; to lose. He wasn&#39;t losing fluid nearly as fast as Slayer so he \nknew\n&gt; &gt; that he could outlast the bot even if it caust Lunarpine his own\n&gt; &gt; life. He wanted to save Shadow Wing but not if it cost the rest of\n&gt; &gt; the maximals thier lives by giving the traitor the chance to \nlive. If\n&gt; &gt; he left Slayer&#39;s weapons alone Slayer would continue fighting and\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine would have the opportunity to finish him. He had a \nbetter\n&gt; &gt; idea though. he leapt forward again slashing both claws at Slayers\n&gt; &gt; shoulder cannons and biting for his neck. If he got a hold on him \nat\n&gt; &gt; close range this battle would be as good as over with Lunarpine \nthe\n&gt; &gt; victor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slayer continues to fly backwards, Lunarpine&#39;s slash leaving \ndeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gashes in his chest.

It was time to put an end to this battle and to the \ntraitor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once and for all. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t let the fact that they \nonce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; served together matter. At this moment only two things \nmattered\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him. Winning or losing would be the difference between who \nstands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tall and who crawls away licking thier wounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC Thank you and have a nice day.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
