The sound muffled \nfrom the cape over her head.\nHer shaking had stopped, her spark still pounded but not nearly as bad as it \nhad. Calm taking over...and being replaced by annoyance.\nShe hated heights the Prowl knew that, yet he still dropped like a rock from \nthe sky and scared her out of her wits...AGAIN!\n\nIron Raptor simply sighs deeply, lifting the cape from her eyes and head, \nthrowing it back so that it would settle against the ground, then looking at \nthe trunks of the trees a bit as Prowl kneels down and\nsends his thoughts to her.\nHer blue eyes turning to him in a glare.*\n\n&lt; Well, next time when you decide to test them I&#39;M NOT WITH YOU!!!&gt;\n\n* She breaths another sigh  but keeps the glare, eventually getting to her \nfeet and dusting herself off.\nThen noticing Prowls puppy eyes, only mannaging to get another glare from \nher.*\n\n&lt; That&#39;s never worked on me...and NO!&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor leaned her weight on one leg as she continued to glare at \nProwl, a look that a mother would give her son when she found out he was \nthrowing things around in the house, breaking something that was of value to \nher.*\n\n&lt; You know very well my fear of hights, but you STILL pulled that stunt! If \nyou ever, EVER do something like that to me again I&#39;ll do way more then just \nslap you!&gt;\n\n* She then looked towards the forest.*\n\n&lt; I&#39;ve also decided that I&#39;m walking back.I can&#39;t trust you anymore.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor didn&#39;t really want to hurt Prowls feeings or anything like \nthat, but he had to get it through his head that he couldn&#39;t just joke about \nanymore.\nThis was a war that they were fighting, and good humour was welcome, but not \nantics and showing off. If Prowl wanted to test his metal, he would have to \ndo it on his own time.\nIron Raptor thought this too, so he would get the picture.\nTurning towards the direction where the signatures of the ship was coming \nfrom, noticing three instead of just two. There must have been a stow-away, \nor even maybe a new Maximal for her to meet.*\n\n&lt; Now, we have to get to the ship, or what&#39;s left of it.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor then began to move into the forest, her cape, surprisingly, \ncatching on nothing.\nMoving easily into the shadows, her armor soaking them up, or seeming to.\nBut when she happened to pass under a ray of light which filtered in through \nthe branches her air seemed to sparkle, her mind too focused on seeing her \nfreinds again and making sure they were alright to notice.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
