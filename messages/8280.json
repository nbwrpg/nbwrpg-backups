Make sure that you do. BrightBlade out.�\n\n* And with that she deactivated her communicator and looked back to \nPerndabot, him not knowing that she had actually seen him nod but then try \nto recover. She shook her head with a smile. *\n\n� You know, you can admit that you like me if that�s the case.�\n\n* She saw him speed up but maintained her casual pace, still keeping up with \nhim. The trees were thinning out and a vast plain could be seen in the \ndistance, it would soon be time to execute her carefully thought up plan.\nBut somehow she guessed that she would not be able to get all of the \ninformation she would need, thinking of how the Maximals would detect her \nafter half a mega-cycle or two. But for the sake of Predacon conquest she \nhad to try. And if she failed she would judge in what she had done wrong the \nfirst time and then try it again, knowing that she knew before and knowing \nthat she knew then.\nBut one never knows until they try.\nBrightBlade looked down at Gangon�s spark, knowing that she wouldn�t be able \nto take it with her. Its signature would give her away.\nBut if she kept it with Perndabot and his own cloaking device it would \nremain unreadable.\nShe looked up at Perndabot, taking in a deep breath. *\n\n� Would you mind if I left this spark with you? I can�t take it in with me.�\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
