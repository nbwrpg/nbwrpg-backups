Very interesting, I shall entertain the idea.\n&gt;  \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; Organics:\n&gt; The tall and graceful form of the valkyrie stirred, a transmission \ndisupted her sleep cycle.  Organics stirred and slowly set up, \nreplaying the transmission.  Realizing the danger, she scrambled out \nof her quarters after she grabbed her shield and sword and ran to \nthe command area.  She franticly searched the consoles for the \nshield controls.  Finally finding them, she dropped the shields and \ndashed outside.  She spotted the striken craft and then jumped into \naction. She flew into the air then tansformed into her space fighter \nmode and flew to help the shuttle correct it&#39;s course.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Fortuneteller&#39;s shuttle raced towards earth. She\n&gt; laid within the small sleek craft, barely large enough\n&gt; for her slender form, and light equipment. In one\n&gt; hand she held her staff, she preferred to use it as a\n&gt; melee weapon, but it was quite capable of delivering\n&gt; energy blasts of moderate power. In her other hand\n&gt; she held twenty bolts. They were her power, by how\n&gt; they fell she could see the future to some extent. \n&gt; She was nothing to compare with Seer, Ex, her beloved\n&gt; Deus, or even Machina, but she had some skill, and had\n&gt; stolen some destiny energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; She blew on the bolts, and asked them, &quot;What is so\n&gt; important about this `Organics&#39;, why does the destiny\n&gt; energy settle about her so. She threw them, and saw\n&gt; many patterns gather. Most of them were indistinct,\n&gt; representing the chaotic course of destiny, but one\n&gt; was quite clear, one bolt laying against another, and\n&gt; a third before them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A potential child,&quot; chuckled Fortuneteller, &quot;well\n&gt; I&#39;ll soon put a stop to that.&quot; She whispered to the\n&gt; bolts again &quot;Who is the father?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The bolts were once again unclear, showing four\n&gt; separate possible candidates, but one was most\n&gt; distinct, taking ten bolts in his pattern. His bolts\n&gt; were chaotic, mad, but still of one pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally she asked her final questions of the bolts,\n&gt; &quot;What is so special about this child?&quot; She gasped at\n&gt; the final pattern. The bolts were quite clear this\n&gt; time, while even without her there was no assurance\n&gt; the child would exist, beyond the child one future\n&gt; dominated seventeen of the bolts, and the other three\n&gt; lay scattered, in un-formed future. The possible\n&gt; timeline she would be stealing for the Deviners uses\n&gt; would be a very different one indeed. In fear of\n&gt; loosing the child the mother would put it onboard the\n&gt; Ark in stasis, even putting his spark within an\n&gt; Autobot body. When the child awakened HE, not Optimus\n&gt; Prime would become the leader of the Autobots. \n&gt; Through some odd device the mother would both allow\n&gt; his spark to mature over the eons, and erase all\n&gt; possible memory of his former life. Under his\n&gt; guidance the Great War would be a massacre of\n&gt; Decepticons, a future in which only the Maximals\n&gt; existed. Her son would be the most ruthless, and\n&gt; brilliant transformer ever to draw energon, but such a\n&gt; great leader he would have no need of the Matrix. If\n&gt; she read them right he even discovered some way to\n&gt; destroy Unicron without opening it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Deus would reward her for this. She thought of her\n&gt; precious Deus, and knew as always he was just using\n&gt; her. She looked at her reflection in the forward\n&gt; shuttle window. She wasn&#39;t old, but worn with the\n&gt; fading beauty of mid-life. Deus was perhaps older\n&gt; than she, but his destiny energy kept him looking ten\n&gt; cycles younger. Still, she was his to command, and\n&gt; she would do as he bid, even to her own death.\n&gt; \n&gt; She aimed her shuttle at the place where she sensed\n&gt; her pray, slightly beside the Maximal Base, but still\n&gt; within their shields. She sent out a distress signal,\n&gt; &quot;HELLO! UNKNOWN BASE DO YOU COPY! I&#39;M OUT OF\n&gt; CONTROL AND I WILL HIT YOUR SHIELDS IF YOU DO NOT\n&gt; LOWER THEM! HURRY!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: All that she envisioned was just a possible\n&gt; future, don&#39;t think I&#39;m forcing anyone into anything\n&gt; (for that matter I&#39;m still waiting on the council to\n&gt; tell me the restrictions on the Deviners).\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
