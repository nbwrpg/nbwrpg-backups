He was\nvery bored. He thought that they would attack the Trainers or someone,\nbut that never ended up happening.\n\nHis eyes narrow as he sees a blimp on the scanners, recognizing it\ninstantly. He activates his comm, sending a message to his commander.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn the conference room, Killfest turns to Darkfate and DrillBit.\n&quot;Scyther detected some bots that were with Hell Beast before heading\nfor the Maximal base. I suggest we attack these bots. From the last\nbattle we&#39;d been to, I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re not friendly to\neither Zardus or the Maximals, so we won&#39;t piss any of them off.&quot;\n\nHe was ready to go, and eager to slag his enemies.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/Double\nPunch/\n&gt; Manterror/Injector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron looked around, still amazed he was alive.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We need to attack the Cybertronian Fire quickly.&quot; Shockwave\nintoned.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You mean Zardus.&quot; Unitron stated.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Zardus is at the Cybertronian Fire, attacking those who wish to\nharm the \n&gt; Maximals.&quot; Vehement explained.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We must move quickly if we are to catch him and his allies off\nguard.&quot; \n&gt; Firestarter said, looking to his fellow Neo Decepticons.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then let&#39;s go.&quot; Shockwave ordered, transforming to his space\nfighter mode \n&gt; and launching off, the other Neo Decepticons following him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement looked to his fellow Brotherhood members and lifted off the\nground, \n&gt; following the Decepticons with Sun Crusher and Reflector following,\nsomewhat \n&gt; reluctant to leave the Chaos-Bringer alone.\n\n\n"}}
