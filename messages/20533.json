It \nwas an excellent location for a base, an island several miles away \nfrom the mainland. He smiles, thinking about the military advantage.\n\nIt was excellent. The Iron Fist&#39;s shields covered the whole island, \nwhich was a few hundred feet across. The shields would need to be \ntaken down in order to gain entry, but it would have to be done by \nair troops, as ground troops would be forced to swim the three miles \nto the island, making an easy target for the defences. In adition, if \na bot aproached underwater, the Iron Fist and island defences would \nrelease energon nets, or send powerful electric shocks through the \nwaters, frying the approaching bot.\n\nIf a bot managed to get through the shields somehow, he would be a \nmuch easier target to the defences. Multiple missile launchers and \nlaser turrets lined the ship, and the Iron Fist&#39;s main turret (the \none Panzertron demonstrated to Megatron) stood out on top.\n\nZardus&#39; smile broadens, the Alliance commander, remembering that the \ninside of the ship was filled with halls and rooms containing state \nof the ark Predacon technology: labs, weapons, everything.\n\n&quot;Shields down,&quot; he says into his wrist comp, the shields of the Iron \nFist lowering. Zardus lands near the open hatch, entering the ship.\n\nBehind him, the shuttles carrying the Alliance base arrive and land, \nthe Alliance base combining again in the middle of the island. \nDemolition lands and enters behind Zardus, carrying Delta, and Havoc \nbehind him, carrying Feline&#39;s body parts.\n\n&quot;Follow me,&quot; Zardus says, heading down the corridor to the labs. Two \nshuttles launched out of the Iron Fist&#39;s docking bay, flying toward \nthe mainland to pick up any Alliance troops going by foot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer nearly falls as the Alliance base lands, grabbing onto a \ndoorway to keep his balance.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re at our destination!&quot; he says to Vamprah, &quot;Wanna go outside see \nwhere we are?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
