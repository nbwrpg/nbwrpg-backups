Whoi wants to be active??? Everyone please\ndeclare what characters you wish to utilize. This is the time if you\nfeel you want to make changes it will be easier to do so.\n\nIf you have too many characters and want to drop some feel free.\n\nIf you feel you want more, then carefully consider how many characters\nyou can handle AND STILL MAKE MEANINGFUL POSTS and then let me know.\n:)\n\nSome of us have a LOT of characters and I have seen a few one and two\nline posts float by. Please only choose the number of characters that\nyou can handle and still make meaningful posts.- yeah I said it twice\n:)\n\nAlso I encourage those that can to make charaters on different sides.\nOur Max side is heavy with characters while the pred side is only me\nand Airly. Again, this is not a requirement, it is only a suggestion.\nI may be waking the unicron isde up as well, if anyone wants a\ncharacter on that side let me know.\n\nAnyways, I look foward to responses. I will be moving characters not\nclaimed or discarded to the inactive parts of the list or take on\ntheir roles myself to keep things moving, depending on the need.\n\nTo view the wiki list you can check here:\nhttp://www.wikihost.org//w/nbwrpg_wiki/character_list\n\nThanks\nPreston\n\n"}}
