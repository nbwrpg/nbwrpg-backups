While in the air \nhe transformed to his bot mode letting loose two shots from his \nrifle.  The shots hit two trees down by the beach raised up on the \ncliff a bit.  The trees fell toward the ground making a ramp down \ninto the water.  Before he hit the groudn he transformed again into \na JetSki.  Landing in between the two logs he slid into the water \nand resumed course.  Dunking under the water he shot back up \n100 meters later transforming to his ATV with a saw buzzing as he \nwent straight into a groupd of trees.  Moments later he appeared on \nthe ground, trees falling behind him.  &quot;Almostt here&quot; he said.\n\n"}}
