Zardus&#39; eyes narrow as he looks \nat the monitor.\n\n&quot;I may be of some help here...&quot; he says to Panzertron, activating his \ncomm-link.\n\n&quot;Dark One, some destrons are attacking the Iron Fist. Can you take your group \nand attack at their base?&quot; he says into the device.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; Dark One&#39;s voice replies, sounding like was carrying something, &quot;Me \nand Pyro are kinda dragging the prisoners to the torture chambers.&quot;\n\nZardus&#39; eyes widen, &quot;Any reason?&quot;\n\n&quot;Maximals are apparently more suicidal than we had thought. Tigerhawk tried \nto rescue them. Alone. Now we&#39;re showing them what happens from that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. In that case....&quot; Zardus pauses, looking down at his wrist comp, \nchecking the locations of all Alliance bots. He switches his comm-link to \ntransmit to all Alliance members, &quot;Reptilica, Bloodystrike, Hiss, Scavanger, \nBreakdown, and Scattershot, please pay a little visit to our destron friends. \nAttack their base untill they are forced to retreat from the Iron Fist, then \nback down.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBreakdown, Scavanger, Hiss and Scattershot set off for the Destron base, \nleaving their repairs on the base unfinished.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot&#39;s eyes winden as BrightBlade answers. &quot;A stealth mission?! You&#39;re \nplanning to infultrate a fully functional ship that is surrounded by miles of \ngrasland. That&#39;s sui-&quot; he&#39;s interrupted by Bloodystrike walking up to him, \nfailing to see Gangon&#39;s spark.\n\nBloodystrike looks up at Perndabot craining his neck up to look at the other \nbot. &quot;Hear that?,&quot; he asks, refferring to Zardus&#39; transmission, &quot;Ya mind \ntossin&#39; me Reptilica?&quot;\n\nPerndabot growls, easily tossing Reptilica to Bloodystrike. Bloodystrike \nquickly runs off, dragging Reptilica toward the Destron base. He&#39;d wake up on \nthe way, Bloodystrike figures, jumping over a bush.\n\nPerndabot looks back at BrightBlade, his eyes sliding down her body, but then \nto the spark in front of her. &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; he asks, taking out his gun just \nin case.\n\n"}}
