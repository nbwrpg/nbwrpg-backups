He then\n&gt; looked at Dead-End&#39;s pecemistic view. &quot;Maybe, but at least he&#39;ll go out\n&gt; in a crash and burn.&quot; he said getting pretty worked up. Breakdown was\n&gt; looking around nervously however.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was nervously looking around, and when he caught Astrotrain&#39;s eyes,\n&gt; thought it best to speak. &quot;So we have to do some aquariaticral work?&quot; he\n&gt; asked Astrotrain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sinnertwin had found something, the sent of an animal perhaps, he\n&gt; thought to himself. He moved off away from the group, making a lot of\n&gt; noise as he did. The hissing grunting and growling mass of yellow\n&gt; reptile made his way towards a forest. &quot;Smell from in there.&quot; one head\n&gt; notted. The other nodded, &quot;Small creatures, lots of them.&quot; the other\n&gt; chimed in nervously. Then they both curled up backwards nervously, &quot;WE\n&gt; HATE.&quot; and heat began to build in both mouths, as they jutted their\n&gt; heads foward sharply, emmiting two streams of searing flame towards the\n&gt; bushes. Emidiatly when the heads were down, the cannon on his back\n&gt; flamed to life, and began spouting random balls of fire into the canopy\n&gt; of trees. The first few bushes immidiatly caught on fire, and began to\n&gt; spread, whereas the ones caught directly in the stream of inferno simply\n&gt; disapeared in smoke.\n\n\n"}}
