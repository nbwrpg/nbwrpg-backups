One of the clones was dead. But he wanted \n&gt; their leader out. He dodged their randomly shot bullets, and than \n&gt; turned his jet pack on. He went right above Inferno, and shot \nrapidly \n&gt; down on him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon got upset. He saw Ramulus, but this other bot? This was not \n&gt; part of the deal. But maybe....this bot was just small back up. \nMaybe \n&gt; with him here, there was less chance of an ambush. This Ramulus \nmust \n&gt; be very dumb.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is the meaning of this? You were supposed to come alone \n&gt; Ramulus! Why is he here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Ignatius saw something he didn&#39;t like while he was \ngazing \n&gt; with his piercing Eagle Eye&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Hammer\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not sure....but something&#39;s not right over there. Movement in \n&gt; the bushed. I don&#39;t like it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm... maybe they were thinking the same we were thinking. This \n&gt; Ramulus must be very smart. Ignatius, take to the skies and look \nover \n&gt; everything carefully. Blaze, get a bit closer and see if you can \n&gt; smell anything. Report back once you have anything.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius and Blaze left the group.\n\n\n"}}
