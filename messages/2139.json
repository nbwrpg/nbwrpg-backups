There was no point in washing anything if there wasn&#39;t any soar to wash it with! She gathers a few bunches of soapallaly (barriers then when squished and rubbed into stuff is like soap), and then walks back over to the stream and the furs. She kneels beside the furs and looks about for something to crush the berries, it was a time that she wished that she would have brought her mortar and pestle but since she was without she went with the next best things. Zyber found a flat stone and set it down in front of her, she then took a fair sized rock from the stream bed and began to crush up the berries after she set them on the rock.\nSoon a froth began to develop from the berries and she then took the furs and dunked then into the stream. With her free hand she took a bit of the froth and began to spread it about the furs until a foam began to form. She then dunked the fur into the water and if the filth wasn&#39;t removed she then repeated the process.*\n\n_____________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor had nearly been captivated by Prowl&#39;s optics again when her attention was ripped from him and towards the same gun fire he had heard. She growled at the fact that it seemed to always be their base that was the center off attention for common battle, it was already on her nerves and just getting worse with every gun shot she heard. She growled even deeper as she opened her com-link and spoke into it.*\n\n&quot; Iris? Keep all base defences on maximum and any signs of attack I want the shields raised and also at max. I also want the auto-guns to fire in a square pattern if you can pull it off. One set firing straight ahead and the other two to the sides. I want them to fire in a spray or scatter form. Hitting more targets that way.&quot;\n\n* It took a nano but soon Iris replied.*\n\nIRIS: &quot;Transmission received and all defence systems at max, guns calibrated to fire at suggested level. Anything else?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked towards the base and thought a moment, if she was needed then she should keep a channel open for emergencies.*\n\n&quot; Just let Tigerhawk and Liono know that I can be reached if they need me. Alright?&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Kay. I&#39;ve just sent the message now on their com-links.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then deactivated her communicator and turned her attention back to Prowl, with the base now in capable circuits she could focus on the subject at hand. She looked back at Prowl with a slight smile and noticed that he looked into her optics as she had looked into his. She then sighed with relaxation as she leaned close again and laid her head gently on his shoulder-plate, her hand going from his chest to his other shoulder as the other stayed on his back. She closed her optics and let all of her worries slip away, not knowing that she just happened to be breathing near his neck.*\n\n&quot; Quieter sounds nice.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
