Her mind went into a semi \ndream state.  The virus was still changing her in some ways.  Her \ntelepathic abilities were getting stronger. She heard what Lunarpine \nwas thinking, but not reacting to it.  In her dream state, she could \nsee through Lunarpine&#39;s mind and sees.  She saw him carrying her and \nknew he was taking her back to the base.  She heard his curious mind \nwondering what had happened to her.  She thought about it herself and \ncouldn&#39;t quite find the answers.  She just knew that the matrix \nwanted it this way and she would just have to live with it.\n\nHer shoulder was dripping blood down onto Lunarpine. Even in her \nsleep, she could smell the blood. She didn&#39;t like th smell of it at \nall.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine thought he&#39;d heard something, no someone calling to \n&gt; him. &quot;What was that?&quot; He wondered, smelling the air again. He \n&gt; followed the scent to her. He could still hear her words in his \nhead \n&gt; when she called to him. &quot;What&#39;s become of you?&quot; He thought, \ncuriosity \n&gt; flooding his mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heard a voice over his comm. Veratis wanted an update on the \n&gt; situation. &quot;I found her&quot; he replied, getting her back was going to \nbe \n&gt; the diffivult part.\n&gt; \n&gt; Three clean up drones aproached scanning her. A needle came out of \n&gt; the first one and headed for Ice. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No&quot; Lunarpine yelled as he grabbed hold of it, It was trying to \n&gt; neutralise the virus. He knew that if that happened she&#39;d be dead. \n&gt; Veratis reprogrammed 2 of the drones to help get her back. \nLunarpine \n&gt; picked Ice up on his back and with the help of the drones began \n&gt; carrying her back.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
