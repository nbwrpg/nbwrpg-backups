As he slowed his pace pulling up beside the \ntyrant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron reached down and hooked his fusion cannon to his arm. He \nthen\n&gt; looked down, &quot;Soundwave, Eject the Frenzy cassette. Immidiatly the\n&gt; cassette door on Soundwave opened up, as the red and black cassette \nflew\n&gt; loose, then transforming and growing into the cassette warrior. \n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave then autimatically realayed the message from Perceptor to\n&gt; Megatron. &quot;We are currently pulling out, but Firestrike has gone \ncrazy,\n&gt; and I can&#39;t afford to lose any troops right now. Continue towards \nbase.&quot;\n&gt; He looked down to Frenzy. &quot;Frenzy pull Soundwave and Triggerhappy \nout of\n&gt; here.&quot; Then he turned his attention to Spasstik and \nBlowpipe, &quot;Prepare\n&gt; to open fire on my mark.&quot; Frenzy took the miniature cassette player\n&gt; (Soundwave) from Spasstik, then gripped Triggerhappy as best as he\n&gt; could, slowly lifting him from the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron then pointed to Prowl, &quot;Smelt him down.&quot; Megatron then \naimed\n&gt; his cannon at the Maximal leader, and fired a fusion blast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spasstik picked different targets however. His duel laser cannons\n&gt; targeting the running Groove. Both let out a laser beam towards the\n&gt; Protectobot. Then his rear anti neutrino grenade launchers aimed\n&gt; upwards, arcking off two grenades into the middle of the Protectobot\n&gt; formation, as the Decepticon wolf snarled with fury.\n\n\n"}}
