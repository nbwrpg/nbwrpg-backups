He eyes Frenzy and Rumble, who were already there, and then \n&gt; proceeds lie down, eye&#39;s closed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frenzy frowns, &quot;I&#39;m bored... I wanna kick some autocrap around. \n&gt; Wait, wait, wait... grrr, that&#39;s all we do here.&quot; He stands up and \n&gt; begins to pace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rumble&#39;s eyes narrow at the though of destruction, and he \n&gt; smiles. &quot;Lets find Soundwave, maybe he&#39;s got something for us.&quot; \n&gt; Frenzy nods, Spasstik perks up, and all three bots head for the \n&gt; control room.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade grins maliciously as he picks up the damaged Megatron \nin \n&gt; gun form. &quot;Megsy, never thought I&#39;d see you in this position this \n&gt; soon... no matter, I&#39;ll just make the bes--&quot; Megatron \n&gt; coughs, &quot;Switchblade, you fool. Fix me and I shall reward you \n&gt; greatly!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The small dark bot laughs, his eyes glowing green with intent. &quot;Now \n&gt; why, Megsy, do I doubt your words... Ah well, I won&#39;t have to \nlisten \n&gt; to anything you say anymore.&quot; Megatron utters his final words, &quot;No, \n&gt; don&#39;t you ca--&quot; as Switchblade disables Megatron&#39;s ability to \n&gt; transform, and to speak, thus rendering the once great bot trapped \n&gt; quite effectively. &quot;Megsy, so sad... or not!&quot; He spends some time \n&gt; repairing the weapon, changing the colour, modifying the design a \n&gt; little, camoflauging the once mighty Decepticon commander. The end \n&gt; result is a sleek red and black hand pistol, with a particularly \n&gt; menacing look to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade then moves over to Firestrike and continues working on \n&gt; the larger fire oriented minion of his. He attaches the final arm \nto \n&gt; Firestrike, with a little modification: A pistol size slot on the \n&gt; inside of his arm, and a little mechanism that pops the pistol into \n&gt; Firestrike&#39;s arm. He then places the pistol into the slot, hidden \n&gt; from view. In addition to the pistol, and his orginal weapons, \n&gt; Firestrike had also been equiped with an enhanced flamethrower. \nThis \n&gt; bot would be a significantly dangerous enemy to face, as long as he \n&gt; didn&#39;t do too much thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; His eyes casting an evil glow around the room, Switchblade utters \n&gt; several words that signify the starting of a revolution. &quot;Arise, \n&gt; Firestrike.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, in the control room of the Dark Avian, Soundwave is \n&gt; conversing with his most cassettes, minus Switchblade.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rumble, Frenzy. No hostile activity has been detected yet, and \n&gt; also, we&#39;re awaiting the recovery of Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rumble shrugs, &quot;I guess we&#39;re waiting till something happens... \n&gt; SLAG, I hat waiting...&quot; He flops down on the floor, and stretches \n&gt; himself out. Frenzy leans against the wall, and Spasstik sits \n&gt; obediantly at Soundwave&#39;s feet. Soundwave opens a commlink to \n&gt; Blindfear, &quot;Blindfear, what is your status? Soundwave out.&quot; He \n&gt; awaits an answer, totally unaware of what is coming...\n\n\n"}}
