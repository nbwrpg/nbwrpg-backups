He also would have been happy that he had reprogramed \nit to \n&gt; become an image of him centered on the emitter itself.  The final \nthing was \n&gt; pure luck he dropped it in the battle and landed on it when he \nfell.  It \n&gt; turned on and created the hologram over where he was lying.  The \nfirst shots \n&gt; hit him and dealt significant damage but they also knocked him \nbackwards away \n&gt; from the explosions.  The shots dealt less and less damage as the \nblew him \n&gt; farther away.  Because the emitter was centered on his body and \nsmall it \n&gt; remained functional, moving only slightly.  It also was programmed \nto hide \n&gt; him from sight so that they could not notice that he was no longer \ngetting \n&gt; hit.\n\n\n"}}
