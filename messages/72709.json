He gives\n&gt; the guards a deep throated hiss, bearing his teeth and fangs.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nUnfortunately for TUSCON the guards do not trip over his tail or fall\ninto his coils. Not because TUSCON was not strong enough or powerful\nenough but simply they were not close enough. They were still coming\ndown they hall when they saw his large bulky form. Instead of rushing\nin to do melee they simply stop and pull out their laser rifles and\nstart firing, their laser blasts bouncing off the walls and targeting\nTUSCON, BIG CONVOY and the others.\n\nAt the same time alarms start blaring once again!\n\n&quot;I certainly hope this wasn&#39;t the distraction you were hoping.&quot; MACH\nKICK said, his sarcasm covering his own growing tension.\n\nBREAK nodded as he pulled back against the wall.\n\nOver the radio LONG RACK said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you guys are planing\nbut security is moving in your direction.&quot;\n\nBIG CONVOY nodded, &quot;We&#39;re going to have to move before we are over run.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
