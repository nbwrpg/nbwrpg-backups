His expression, that of a very hungry\n&gt; predator, ready to devour his victim and litter the floor with his nuts and\n&gt; bolts.\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Hard Head and Hydra with an intimidating hiss.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m getting hungry and you two seem like a substantial snack.  Unless you\n&gt; would rather be on my good side and retract your weapons.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He licks the tip of the weapon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, this actually tastes rather good..&quot;\n\nas TUSCON turned to face HARDHEAD and HYDRA they both glanced at each\nother, stepping back, fear in their optics, their weapons wavering\nslightly.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t push it.&quot; GUILEDART said from behind TUSCON now that he had\nturned around, &quot;You might be formidable but I have no problem taking\nyou down right here and right now.&quot; He said, his voice all business.\n\nGUILEDART pressed his cannon shapped in the form of a dinosaur&#39;s head\nbetween TUSCON&#39;s shoulderblades. &quot;You heard Magamtron, your time will\ncome, but you have to live to see it!&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON just stood their watching the display his arms folded across\nhis chest.\n\nRODIMUS and SABERBACK both wore smug smiles, but also did nothing,\nletting GUILEDART handle matters. However above them the sphere that\nhung near the ceiling began to glow as if being charged with energy.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
