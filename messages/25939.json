He sighs.\n\n&quot;Allright, hold tight, the Alliance will leave as soon as they get \nout of the Cybertronian Fire.&quot; he says to him over the comm, feeling \nrather helpless.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster spins around as Tarantopoulus runs off. &quot;Hey, where&#39;re you \ngoing?&quot; He yells after the bot.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Damn!  I really messed up on my character&#39;s intros!  Sorry \nAirshadow!!!  I&#39;ll do a little correction with Orchestra, and pretend \nhe didn&#39;t notice the base!  Again, sorry everybody!\n&gt; \n&gt; Orchestra/Symphony\n&gt; \n&gt;        Orchestra was worried.  What could&#39;ve happened to his \nbrothers?  Oh, anything could have happened.  They could&#39;ve been \nblown off course by a strong wind.  They could&#39;ve been destroyed by \nenemy transformers.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;DAMN!!!!  I&#39;VE WAITED SO LONG TO PLAY THIS \nMUSIC!!!!!!!!!!&quot; He yelled out loud with anger.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;AND WHY DID I HAVE TO LAND IN A STINKIN&#39; VOLCANO!!!!!!!  \nWHY???????&quot; He yelled again.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Orchestra pulled out a alien-like weapon which shot out \nblue plasma beams.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;HEAR MY BOLERO OF THUNDER!!!  HEAR MY MINUET OF \nRAGE!!!!!!!&quot; He yelled, this time firing his gun up at the air(the \ntop of the volcano).\n&gt; \n&gt;             He tapped a button on his gun, and it turned into an \nobject resembling a violin.  Orchestra got out a stick and started \nplaying fast-paced, violent sounding music on the violin.  Thunder \ncould be heard outside of the volcano.  Inside the volcano, small \nstreaks of lava appeared, growing a small bit bigger with every \nnote.  As Orchestra&#39;s angry music went on, a circle of lava had \nformed around Orchestra.  This went on, until finally Orchestra \nfinished his little piece of music.  The lava and other elements \nwhich the music had struck up disappeared.\n&gt;  \n&gt;             &quot;Played by the great Orchestra!!!!&quot; Orchestra yelled \nwith pride, bowing to nobody and raising his violin in the air.  He \nturned the button back into a gun and put it away.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Ok, if the base didn&#39;t hear that, then I don&#39;t know what to do\n[Well, I do, but I&#39;m trying to make you notice Orchestra so that he \ncan get factioned])\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Symphony stopped his music, and then sent a message to all \nthe Maximals of the CF through his com.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;I wish to join you!  I come in peace, and I wish to join \nyou!  You are my only chance at being heard!!!!&quot; He begged.\n\n\n"}}
