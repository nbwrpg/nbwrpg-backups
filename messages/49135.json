Controlling proto-humans isnt going to happen. The council will \nnot put extremely important NPCs into the hands of players. In BW the \nMaximals interacted very little with the humans and thus that should be \nrespected and shown in here. The protohumans would also get crushed in combat \nwith TFs they lack the know how to do so. While controling humans persay \nisn&#39;t a bad idea, it still isn&#39;t that good of one especially when you are \ntalking about human ancestors. After all you have to look at this from a \nlogical point of view, just how many transformers are going to be attracted \nto primitive earth. We&#39;ve had 5 or 6 factions already crashland onto the \nplanet, that in itself defys some rational thought. Yes back stories are good \nfor them but sometimes its just enough. The RPG really doesn&#39;t need any \nwholey new factions to get it running again. It just needs a spark, an \nelement of chaos if you will. So far everything that has appeared and \nhappened has been pretty much voted on by the players, that just makes it \nboring. Once in a while something needs to happen that the players no nothing \nabout. Better RPing skills are built that way. As for the quintesson \nquestion, they were always around as far as the fandom know. They made the \ntransformers and in the continuity as far as my knowledge goes the gobots \nwere never recognized, although it is possible that they were or could have \nbeen since in Five Faces of Darkness it begins with a galactic olympics, \nhowever they were also not able to identify one of the attackers that got \ncaught so it also shows that at the time not everything was known. Anyway \nthats my 2 cents for now. Flame me if you want but this has been my unbiased \nopinion.\n\n"}}
