Now though, they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gone, fleeing the unnatural that had come from inside the earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And now, the creature was about to become a meal for the third\ntime in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its death. A lean coyote, devoid of any fat, with barely skin on its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bones, looked at the corpse with delight. Finally something good\n&gt; to eat!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It came up to the dead animal and started tearing at putrid\npieces of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meat, pulling bones and decomposing tendons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The coyote was happy. It could have hunted, but it prefered much\nmore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sweet odor of rotting flesh. He learned more from it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The coyote transformed, becoming a no less hungry-looking robot.
