Not wanting to be hit by the Vok Destroyer shot, he puts all of \nhis efforts into diving to the side, out of the way. \n\nThe powerful weaponshot warps the surrounding air as it flashes by \nMegatron&#39;s lower legs. His circuits tingle as he realizes what had \nmissed him.\n\nHe hits the ground sliding, but quickly rolls, and brings himself \ninto a crouching position. His should armour still damaged from \nOwlhawk&#39;s initial attack, was the only damaged part on him at the \nmoment. Seeing the Tripredacus retreating, he growls at missing the \nchance to eliminate a few slag heaps. &quot;Crushing something... \nMaximalish would be nice right now... yesss...&quot;\n\nNew faces on the field greated his eyes. One could be none other \nthan Galvatron, who was fighting the Maximal leader, Rodimus \nPrime. &quot;A situation to be taken advantage of.&quot; He smiles menacingly; \nevil amusement could be read from his glowing red optics.\n\n---------------------\n\nMeanwhile, Switchblade has been fooling around with the artifact \nhe&#39;d just put together, or more correctly, put itself together for \nhim. He probes it&#39;s sides for any sort of start mechanism.\n\nSearching without any lucky, he was about to quit, when the cube-\nlike matrix of artifact suddenly started to glow. He found that he \ncouldn&#39;t remove his hands from the sides that he was holding, and he \nhad no idea what was happening.\n\nSuddenly, a white superheated blade of white spears outward, slicing \nthrough the side of the storage bay and slashing across the western \nbattle field (west side of the Pred base) causing massive damage to \nanything in it&#39;s path. Switchblade was still gripping the artifact \nlike there was no tomorrow, and he didn&#39;t appear to be fully \nconcious. It was like the artifact was controlling him.\n\n( i just chose a side for the attack to damage, so if anyone feels \nthat there bot is on the west side, they can post for the attack \ndamaging their bots, or missing them. I intend to have Megatron \ndamaged at a minimum. =) )\n\n\n\n\n"}}
