His damage was taking over him.\n\n&quot;Ah&#39;m goin&#39; t&#39; get mah repairs,&quot; he announced to his comrades. He skittered \nout into the corridors, passing rooms and closed doors. He crawled into the \nrepair room, where the CR chambers stood. He still wasn&#39;t used to the \nchambers. He was used to the tanks the Darkside once had. But the Darkside \nwas dead. Sadly. He liked that ship.\n\nHe transformed to his robot mode, and once his feet hit the floor, he \nstumbled and screamed. He caught himself, using his arms for balance. He \nstood, baring the pain. On a panel in the room, a fur pelt laid. It was the \nfur pelt Rowdy Wolf gave him on his trip back home. And on the floor, was \nthe torn headband. He shook his head.\n\nHe sighed and limped painfully into the CR cahmber. It closed behind him.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
