Without the sonar device, getting a definite ping would be \n&gt; difficult, via echolocation.  Yet, the tunnels seem to carry an echo of \n&gt; their own.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; According to the tunnel&#39;s echo, he&#39;s about two thousand clicks due east \n&gt; of us.  And that&#39;s not many.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift narrows his optics.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Then I think it&#39;s time for a little pest control and a diversion.  You \n&gt; guys go on ahead, I can keep bug face busy for a little while.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside in the hallway, Quickstride had always hated Deepstryke and his \n&gt; crew of lackies and wasn&#39;t afraid to take them on all by himself. He \n&gt; snorts angrilly, and gets into beast mode.  Rat Trap remains in his beast \n&gt; form, and bristles his own fur.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If I were you chumps I wouldn&#39;t get too cocky!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride joins him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right plane brains!

His optic displaying a bit of\n&gt;&gt; mirth as he watched them he nodded to Perceptor.  &quot;You say that our\n&gt;&gt; actions are predictable, and even boring, but in the end people of all\n&gt;&gt; types flourish where there is freedom. What would you gain under the\n&gt;&gt; rule of the Predcons or the Decepticons?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus shrugged as he continued, &quot;What will you do if you succeed in\n&gt;&gt; conquering everything?&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;One thing I have learned\n&gt;&gt; spending these past months among you is that Predacons, much like the\n&gt;&gt; Decepticons, care only about power even at the expense of each other.\n&gt;&gt; That is why they cannot win, because in the end they only work against\n&gt;&gt; each other.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus looked speculatively at Perceptor, &quot;Is there anything more\n&gt;&gt; that you would want for yourself?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as they walked the sounds of rumbling could be heard coming from\n&gt;&gt; behind them, the sounds of someone digging could be clearly heard,\n&gt;&gt; like a drill, or several of them moving in their direction through the\n&gt;&gt; very walls.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;That sounds like Scorponok&#39;s digging!&quot; Rodimus said, his voice and\n&gt;&gt; face resolute. &quot;We had better hurry, we do not want to be stuck down\n&gt;&gt; here with him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, BLACKRAZOR, Rat Trap, Quickstride\n&gt;&gt; Location: Black Fortress - hallway\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy, noting the direction that the others have left in started up\n&gt;&gt; his own motors. &quot;Come he said to Rat Trap and Quickstride, &quot;We also\n&gt;&gt; need to leave. No doubt the Predacons and Decepticons are rallying for\n&gt;&gt; some sort of defensive maneuver.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You would be right.&quot; A voice from the shadows ahead said as the bulky\n&gt;&gt; form of Deepstyke could be seen in his gun unit mode.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as Deepstryke spoke from behind chuckling could be heard as\n&gt;&gt; Phobia and Nightrazor come out as if from side hall or doorway, they\n&gt;&gt; chuckle as Phobia&#39;s voice could be heard chiming in, &quot;Although it is\n&gt;&gt; too late to do anything about it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As one the three units open fire, Deepstryke&#39;s cannons opened up on\n&gt;&gt; Legacy, who&#39;s shielding was beginning to fail under the onslaught\n&gt;&gt; while Phobia and Nightrazor aimed for Rat Trap and Quickstride.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC: Airly, I am not sure what you want to do with Hydras.
