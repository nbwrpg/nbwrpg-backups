He was about half way to his destination.\n\nInside Cyclonus and Rodimus stared at each other with expressions that moved in complex hues ranging from anger to respect. Scourge for his part looked at the forward screens, then Hydras, then at Zarak, his face showing irritation and mistrust.

I wasn&#39;t aware of how far it was previously. They will be arriving in the next post or two. \n\nIf Megatron wants to follow them, I am not sure of his sensors, but perhaps he will see a long line of heat??  The heat trail is the tunnel that they left behind that the Magma filled. While it only goes for a couple of miles before it begins to cool into obscurity, it points to a subsurface tunnel aimed in a straight line in the direction of Hydras&#39; base. \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
