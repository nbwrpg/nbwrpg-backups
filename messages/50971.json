Megatron&#39;s \noreds are \n&gt; moving out.&quot; He sent a comm to Nightshade and quilldart. &quot;You two \nmeet us 10  \n&gt;  miles  outside the tripred base. Things gave come up.&quot; He turned \nback to \n&gt; Cyngar. &quot;I have people in place who will make this battle \ninteresting. By \n&gt; taking out megatron quickly we will destroy a major threat. While \nthe bots \n&gt; are distracted with eachother we can attack Megs himself and end \nthis. I will \n&gt; do that personaly. &quot; The shields would go up with the auto denfenses \nuntil \n&gt; Galvatron disabled them.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Quilldart stopped. &quot;Damn I hate it when he does that. Lets go \nnightshade.&quot; \n&gt; He turns towrds the point they were set to meet.\n\n\n"}}
