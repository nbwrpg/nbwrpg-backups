Maybe even with her.\nBrightBlade closed her optics, as if anybot would love her. Maximal or \nPredacon. No bot had ever really loved her: Gangon alwasy commented on her \nlooks but he never showed any signs that he loved her, Perndabot only liked \nher for her looks and not her real self.\nBut now there was this strong feeling that she was finally loved, the \nthought actually warming her spark a bit.\nBut it was brought on by the thoughts, otherwise she wouldn&#39;t give a rats \ntail about any of this.\nBrightBlade looked at the cuffs again but then noticed something, Grimmler \nwas apporaching her.\nBut why in the Hell should she feel so attracted to a slaging Maximal?\nIt wasn&#39;t right, but the more she fought against it the stronger it became.\nShe sighed again and looked at the cuffs, knowing that each step the man \ntook towards her her love for him grew.\nIt was frustrating as Hell but she couldn&#39;t fight it, not even the fact that \nher mind told her she was a Maximal.\nIt was so strange.*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
