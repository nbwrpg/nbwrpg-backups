Many small insectoid-like drones about the size \nof a football worked frivolously on their overbearing &quot;master,&quot; though they \nlacked the sentient status to know this. The each, in turn, crawled from here \nto there, piece by piece, placing scraps of metal and familiar bits in a \npile. That pile, in turn was being places intricately together. Through this \nsmall &quot;factory&quot; of sorts, one could make out the very Tarantulas who was \nthought dead. Obviously, with his small spider drones, he was rebuilt; maybe \ngood as new. But with their help, his lair was coming by perfect. Computers \nlit up once in a while, the large nearby energon deposit supplying a great \nenough power to keep everything maintained. &quot;Yess...they will see what its \nlike to cross the great arachnid, Tarantulas...yess....&quot;.\n\n(( OOC: I just wanted to add, this isn&#39;t my best work...I just wanted to get \nthis done. ))\n\n"}}
