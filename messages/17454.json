She no \nlonger could communicate with Veratis.  She felt her spark fall as \nshe could only hear her own thoughts.  She wished she could talk to \nLunarpine and tell him how much she loved him and that she was sorry \nfor all she had put him through. She would have to wait and see if \nthe Matrix would let her live long enough to say these thing to him.\n\nVeratis had started her thinking about things.  How old was he \nexactly? What could he teach her? Woud he be willing to teach her? If \nhe had lived and survived this long, perhaps there was the chance \nthat her and Lunarpine would make it that long.  She would have \nsmiled if she could have.  She felt some small bit of hope and \nthought about the questions she would ask when Veratis returned.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis wanted to stay and chat with Shadow Wing for a while, he to \nhad\n&gt; questions that he wanted to ask, unfortunately his old body wasn&#39;t \nwhat it\n&gt; used to be. &quot;I&#39;m sorry child, I grow tired at my old age, I need \ntime to\n&gt; rest, Lunarpine will be back in a while and we&#39;ll sit and talk face \nto face.\n&gt; Until then I must be going.&quot; He removed the receptors and placed \nthem back\n&gt; in thier cases.\n\n\n\n"}}
