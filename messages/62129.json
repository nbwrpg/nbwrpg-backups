He got up off the floor and\n&gt; went to check the alarm&#39;s trigger.  It appeared to be someone was trying to\n&gt; open the working hatch.  He was not totally sure if anoher bot was with\n&gt; them, but he didn&#39;t want an intruder in his ship.  He left the room and\n&gt; turned to see Celeron trying to open he hatch.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;What are you doing and why ar you trying to open my hatch?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex Sell &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Celeron quietly sneaked in and grabbed the toolbox he had been using\n&gt; earlier, then left quietly.
