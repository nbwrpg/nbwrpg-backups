We can still get him!&quot; he yelled, Injector, Double Punch, and \nManterror getting outside.\n\n&quot;He went that way!&quot; Double Punch, used to tracking victims down and murdering \nthem.\n\n\n---\n\nRamhorn had slowed down quite a bit, 2 thirds of the way to the Ark.  He was \ndamaged, and his time with internal repairs had only helped so much.  Running \nlike he had been doing had distrupted the repairs and opened wounds.  \n&quot;Ramhorn, maximize!&quot; he yelled, transforming into his biped mode.  Starting \nto walk towards the Ark, two explosions when off near him, sending him \nfalling backwards, almost losing his balance.\n\nInjector ran up, swinging wide at Ramhorn, but Ramhorn blocked it with one \narm, punching Injector in the stomach, then kneeing him in the face, sending \nhim toppling over.  Manterror and Double Punch came running after him over a \nhill, firing ion disks and missiles.  The shots all missed though, but they \ndid create noticable damage to the terrain.  Raising the stinger missile \nlauncher he had stolen from Injector, Ramhorn fired four missiles, two \nhitting in front of Double Punch, the others inf ront of Manterror, tripping \nthe Predacons.  \n&quot;Slag my injuries!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, going to beast mode and heading for the \nArk as fast as he could.    \n\n"}}
