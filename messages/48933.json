This could\n&gt; explain his ability to get blown up.  The Spark is\n&gt; everything.  If it dies so does everything.  Beside&#39;s\n&gt; if logic were in the head you wouldn&#39;t need it to\n&gt; revive Waspinator, but they never threw it out as a\n&gt; useless waist of power.\n&gt; \nit seems like Inferno, Waspinator and Terrorsaur where the ones that \nalways got blown up, they might have been the same type of model or \nsomething.\n\n\n"}}
