As \nestablished in the Gen-1 series and unchanged in Beast Wars (which is \nbased directly on Gen-1), the Autobots and Decepticons existed and \nfeuded for millions of years as the sole occupants of Cybertron, not \nthree thousand.\n\nThe Great War, which ended 300 years before the Beast Wars storyline, \nwent on for nine million years.  As well, there were two other major \nwars between Autobots and Decepticons recorded prior to that, with \nperiods of peace in between (and before the first war broke out).  \nGoing by what would be thought of as significant time periods by such \na society, the Autobot/Decepticon era of Cyberton&#39;s history is \nprobably at least 12 million years long, and probably closer to 20 \nmillion.\n\nPardon me for what may look like nitpicking, but if this RPG is going \nto be based on existing Transformers storylines, then proper \nadherence to history has to be maintained.\n\n\n"}}
