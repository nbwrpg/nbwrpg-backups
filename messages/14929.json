We have other things to worry about.  Get the wounded\n&gt; fixed up.  We then need to find another base and get ourselves\n&gt; organized.  Then we need to get revenge on the Maximals for all they\n&gt; have done to us.  If you survive to that point, then you can fight\n&gt; amongst yourselves, not until then!&quot;  She winced at the pain in her\n&gt; leg.  She noticed she was standing in a pool of fluid already.  She\n&gt; reached out and took Drillbit&#39;s shoulder to stabilize herself. &quot;And\n&gt; now if you will pardon me, I need to get fixed up.&quot;  She then limpoed\n&gt; to the CR room.  She sat in a chair next to the chamber to catch her\n&gt; breath.  She grimaced in pain as it surged through her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DrillBit looked at Psuedo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Kit doesn&#39;t even know she ever new a Land Mine or a Time Bomb.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing I could do too cure her insanity was to either erase the\n&gt; &gt; memorys\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Land Mine and Time Bomb, or compleatly reprogram her.
