We have the ability to \nheal, to an extent at least.  So, if we can draw him to a quantum \nsingularity with the appropriate bait, we can bag us a Chaosbringer.  \nBut there are no blackholes in this sector.  The best bet would send \nhim through another sub space instability.  Or...&quot;\nHe thought a moment as he took another drink from his mug.\n&quot;... give him a virus.  Cause his space fold system to crash and he \ncan&#39;t move in space.  Or sabotage his energy refinery.  Our options \nare not very favorable, even for me.&quot;\nHe thought more on the subject, taking another drink from his mug. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt;   She grinned. &quot;My turn huh. WEll, first off, wolves are not bounty \n&gt; hunters in the same way your thinking. But hunters we are. As for a \n&gt; secret I possess, I will tell you one thing. It doesn&#39;t take two to \n&gt; keep a secret.&quot;  She grinned and sipped her drink. &quot;However, I do \n&gt; believe in returning a favor for a favor. First off, Yes, I am from \n&gt; another dimension. How I got here or why I&#39;m here is beyond my \nmental \n&gt; processors. However, I do know what will tempt Unicron. IT&#39;s three \n&gt; things he can&#39;t resist. Energy, knowledge and metal.  HE uses metal \n&gt; to rejuvinate himself, energy for the same reasons we need it, and \n&gt; knowledge. He wants to be a god. Better than the matrix. He thinks \n&gt; he&#39;s the smartest thing out there and that he knows everything \nthere \n&gt; is to know except the future. But since he&#39;s almost invincable, he \n&gt; doesn&#39;t care about attacks from smaller enemies. He&#39;s too big to \n&gt; stop. However, he can still be outsmarted. Ever hear of something \n&gt; called a BlackHole?  I did it once before in my universe. We had \n&gt; rigged something to make Unicron think we had found the EYE OF THE \n&gt; MATRIX.  It lets one see into the past, present and future. He \nwanted \n&gt; it so bad, he followed me into a black hole. I made it by chance \nout \n&gt; the other end. He was way to big to fit through the small Quazar \nand \n&gt; was stuck forever. So, now you have info on me.&quot; She grinned, &quot;Oh, \n&gt; and one more little thing, if you want a secret about me. I am made \n&gt; of a substance called Zianium. It&#39;s stronger and more duable than \n&gt; Transmetal. But unlike metal, it can, ah, heal itself. LIke a true \n&gt; organic can heal from a wound or sickness. And, I have a substance \n&gt; similar to the organic liquid called blood. It&#39;s thicker and has a \n&gt; blue color, but it&#39;s not just mech fluid. I was one of seven like \n&gt; myself. We were the prototypes. But, well, &quot;  she looked at her \n&gt; drink. &quot;Never mind anyway, favor returned. Find something to look \n&gt; like an EYE OF THE MATRIX and lure Unicron into a black hole. He&#39;ll \n&gt; fall in and your rid of him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
