The jet&#39;s \nrepair system activates, working on the dent as the jet circles back, \nfiring two more missiles at Astroblast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Vicyr/Slasys jet, still cloaked, turns around and fires three \nmore plasma shots at Astroblast.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Astroblasts radar picks up the missiles heading toward him, but \n&gt; not soon enough to dodge both of them. The first missile \n&gt; broadsides him, but he manages to dodge the second. Then \n&gt; coming around he fires three laser blasts from his twin laser \n&gt; cannons at Scrap. &quot;Trying to surprise me are you, I don&#39;t think \nso!&quot; \n&gt; he says evily.\n\n\n"}}
