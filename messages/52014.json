That&#39;s borderline moding, you know.  Nobody of \nthat mass can be that agile - that&#39;s basic physics.  I&#39;ll let it go \nthe first time, but remember that six (or seven, if Rauq ever wakes \nup) versus one is a virtually insurmountable handicap for any \ncharacter that follows the rules of the RPG - your own rules.\n\nTorin throws himself to the ground, his next shot going wild.  Next \nto him, Fury lets out a wild, shrieking war cry and whips out his \nlashknife, sending the blade slashing out on its cable at the Maximal \nwhile firing more darts from his cybervenom gun.\n\nDevilcat takes to the air, letting loose with the powerful blasts of \nhis subspace cannon.\n\nRiekan launches his boomerang arm-blades, reasoning that this \noutnumbered opponent can&#39;t dodge them coming and going and still put \nup a fight.\n\nJayde circles around to one side, trying to widen the crossfire \nYggdrasil is facing by firing bursts from her nailgun at him.\n\nGatara shields her face with her arms as her hide is peppered by \nbullets.  It dings her up a little, but she&#39;s still ready for plenty \nmore as she returns fire with her combination heavy machine \ngun/grenade launcher.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil watches as his plan fails utterly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: So much for passivity! Yggdrasil Prime, Maximize!\n&gt; \n&gt; His thick tree bark hide reveals his robot form. He looks \nstunningly \n&gt; like Optimus Prime, but he seems less tolerant and far less \ncautious \n&gt; when it comes to fighting.\n&gt; \n&gt; He opens fire with his two giant machine guns, mainly aiming Gatara \n&gt; and Torin, and fires four shots of his particle gun. He dodges most \n&gt; shots but still gets scratched over his chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, intimidation tactics have little effect on the \nRogue \n&gt; &gt; forces, with the lone exception of Jayde.  They&#39;ve all seen \nthings \n&gt; &gt; much scarier than an attacking tree-creature, regardless of its \n&gt; size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gatara, the closest Rogue (also the biggest), sees one tree \nheaded \n&gt; &gt; for her own noggin, but knocks it aside with a fist and squeezes \n&gt; both \n&gt; &gt; triggers on her weapon, sending both a hail of magnum bullets and \na \n&gt; &gt; grenade at this ferocious enemy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Devilcat steps forward, allowing the falling timbers to bounce \n&gt; &gt; harmlessly off his force shield.  Then he retaliates with several \n&gt; &gt; energy bursts from his laser sword.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jayde yelps and scrambles back, looking for an opening to bring \nher \n&gt; &gt; own nailgun to bear.  Torin, Riekan, and Fury are out of reach \nfor \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil&#39;s initial attack, but they fight back anyhow: Torin \nfires \n&gt; &gt; his plasma blaster, Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and \nFury \n&gt; &gt; (after transforming) opens up with his cybervenom gun.\n\n\n"}}
