Still puzzled at how they can be \nentertained so easily.\nBut, she guessed that that was just the way that these two were.\nIf all men were like that, slag help them all.\nBut these too looked simple minded.\n\nBut ever so fainly, as Reptilica pointed down the wron g direction and was \nrudly corrected bt Bloodystrike, she wondered if the Maximals were ever this \nstupid?\nNone of them seemed like it, in fact, they all seemed to be rather clever. \nBut then why were they losing this war?\nTheir kind ways, which is basically weak not only in her own views, but \neveryone elses.\nHmm...but some of the Maximals soldiers didn&#39;t seem so peaceful.\nLike the reptilien warrior she had seen back in that clearing, the \ntransmetal 2 which she had sensed held the mech fluid she kept hungering \nfor.\nBut it was the first time she had ever sensed fluid so strong before, not \neven knowing until now that it existed.\nDesmonus&#39; stomach growled at the thought, hissing through her teeth.\nShe would have that fluid, but first she would have to get the bot who it \nbelonged to.\nPerhaps reprogram him into an Alliance member, so that he would always be \naround when hunger struck.\nBut unlike these two, she would not have to give any sense of primitive \npleasure just to feed, she could just take it.\nDesmonus smiled, she liked that idea.\n\nDesmonus suddenly shook her head to clear it, feeling Reptilica trying to \nslip an arm around her, hissing but allowing him to do so.\nMostly annoyed at breaking her train of thought.\nThen Bloodystrike trying to slip his arm around her as well.\nBut she put on a smile.*\n\n&quot; Yesss, we shall. But...a question while we walk: I saw a Transmetal 2 in a \nclearing once, batting against one of our soldiers, Oblitertron.&quot;\n\n* In order to capture and perhaps reprogram that bot, she might as well \nlearn his name.&quot;\n\n&quot; Hmm...silver armor, hard, mean features. Reptiliean, skilled. What is his \nname...if you know?&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
