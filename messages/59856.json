Interfacing with the\ncomputers, and uploading the image of him, the\ncomputer fed me back his data file. As for finding out\nabout his claims, I secretly hid a bug not far from\nthe Maximal base in case it yielded anything about the\nnew bot.

A major wildcard is a Maximal\n&gt; warrior by the name of Shadowcaster who according to\n&gt; all records died defending the Ark during Megatron&#39;s\n&gt; attack using the Nemesis. He claims to be sent back\n&gt; from the Matrix by Primus, whic if true means he\ncould\n&gt; well be a good option to turn to should the weapon\n&gt; fail. On the other hand, if this is really a hoax by\n&gt; Unicron then I fear we are all in danger. Assuming\nhe\n&gt; is the spawn of Unicron, even if we were able to\nfoil\n&gt; his ruse, he is as powerful as Optimal Optimus,\n&gt; however, much faster, and with cloaking\ncapabilities.\n&gt; Whatever the case, it would seem that our problems\nare\n&gt; increasing.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;  --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Tyrael was grave yet again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: A file appeared.
