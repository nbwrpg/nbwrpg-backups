He raises his \nright arm, equiped with his legendary weapon of destruction on it, and \ntakes aim at the pods racing towards the ark. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what to \ndo Astroblast&quot; he spits, as he pulls the trigger. &quot;They are nothing \nbut stagnating waste, waiting to be born in the inferno of my fusion \ncannon&quot;. After finishing the sentence, a small huming sound builds \ninside of his weapon. Deep in it&#39;s pit two atoms begin to be forced \ntogether by energy process, and then a huge torrent of white energy \nbegins to grow, and push outwards and grow, until it forms a large \nwhite bubble around the end of the cannon, straining to hold the \nenormous effects it creates. Air rips, as finally the storm hits. A \nlarge wide ark of fusion energy explodes from the cannon, pushing \nMegatron back a bit, as he plants his feet, unleashes a screaming \nblaze of chaotic energy towards two of the pods, it&#39;s massive area of \neffect. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWildrider approaches the pod, and quickly shifts and transforms taking \naim at it, and about to pull his trigger. Speedbreaker barrels into \nhis legs however, sending the grey psychotic robot laughing maniacly \ninto a rock. Speedbreaker then transforms, and takes aim himself at \nthe pod, and is about to pull the trigger.\n\n\n\n"}}
