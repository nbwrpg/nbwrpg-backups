Some=\r\none mentioned Tucson Prime in the transmissions.. \n&gt; &gt; Good for him, He wor=\r\nked really hard ta get ta where he is, and ta become a \n&gt; &gt; Prime..

Well, I just can&#39;=\r\nt sit \n&gt; &gt; around and wait for him can I?  After all, he&#39;s gonna need me.  =\r\nWhen we \n&gt; &gt; work together, we hardly miss our targets.
