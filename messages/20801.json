He set her inside the transport pod and set the coordinates for\nVeratis&#39; base. The pod quickly sped back to the base in time to save Ice.\nLunarpine tried to make sense of her thoughts, they seemed mixxed up beyond\ncomprehension. She wasn&#39;t afraid of the virus, she was more afraid of\nsomething else. he tried to focus, the visions made little sense to him. Why\nwould she be thinking about a cage at a time like this. Her roar echoed\ndeafeningly in his head. &quot;Calm down.&quot; He shouted to her hopeing she had at\nleast a little comprehension. The cleaning drones helped the struggling bot\ncarry Ice back inside and into the lab. He forced himself to resist the urge\nto scream as he placed her into her CR chamber. He hoped that this would\nsettle her. Almost immediately a sedative flooded the tank intended to calm\nher.\n\nVeratis raced into the lab and activated the DNA sequencers. He hoped that\nthe intervention of her origional DNA would counteract the virus. He held\nhis head as if it would explode if he let go. &quot;What happened out there?&quot; the\nold science bot asked when the sedative took effect on Ice.\n\n&quot;She paniced I think.&quot; Lunarpine answered looking on at her new form inside\nthe chamber.\n\n&quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; Veratis stated in an almost demanding manner as he\npointed Lunarpine into the other chamber. &quot;We can&#39;t take the chance that the\nvirus may have mutated.&quot; Veratis watched the scanners as Lunarpine stepped\ninside.\n\nFoxfingers locked himself in his room while he waited for the viral\nemergency to calm down. He suddenly came to a paniced realization. His\nsamples were in the lab with the infected bots. If they were contaminated\nthered be hell to pay.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 13, 2000 10:03 AM\nSubject: Ice\n\n\n&gt; Ice:;\n&gt;\n&gt; She felt the virus start to change and enter it&#39;s final stages. It\n&gt; was changing her mind. Her thoughts went running wild.\n&gt;\n&gt; The virus started to increase her range on mental thought\n&gt; transference capabilities. She was projecting her thoughts out to\n&gt; Lunapine and any bot with in miles. She was projecting images of pure\n&gt; fear. The fear of being locked up in a cage was her foremost fear at\n&gt; the moment. She had images of being in a small cage, no where to go\n&gt; and no way to get out. She roared in her mind and started fighting\n&gt; against the cage bars.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her body started to move as the virus worked insde her. She let out a\n&gt; small roar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
