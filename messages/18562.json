For the record, the Alliance was made for the exact opposite reason \nDark Prime is telling the Maximals. The Vok that possessed Zardus and ordered \nhim to get the Alliance together did it to preserve history by whiping out \nall the other bots. They wern&#39;t doing that because there wasn&#39;t enough \nbotpower on their side, but that&#39;s different now...\n\nAlso, Logo&#39;s a bit off on the history. Well, it isn&#39;t really if its just what \nKitKat knows, but if you stretch it out all the way to the beginning of the \nRPG.... I&#39;m not even gonna go into that, too tired right now.\n\n::Grimmler::\n\nGrimmler raises an eyebrow. &quot;Now wait a minute! The Maximals are not on bad \nterms with the Alliance. In fact, we havn&#39;t been attacked by them at the \nCybertronian Fire at all. The Predacons are what we should be considering. If \nmy mission briefing was right, the Predacons are here to gather energon, and \nif they succeed in getting it back to Cybertron, us Maximals are in alot of \ntrouble. Their fleet could then overpower us very easily then. If Cybertron \nis in danger, its from the Predacons. They have a huge fleet, the Alliance \nonly has about thirty bots.&quot;\n\n"}}
