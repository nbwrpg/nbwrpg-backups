All t=\r\nhe \nprogramming Perceptor might expect is there, but there is a shell \nprog=\r\nraming of some type overlaid on Skorponok&#39;s systems, and its \nsignature is =\r\ndefinitely Unicronian in origin. \n&gt; \n&gt; The shell programming is resisting P=\r\nerceptor&#39;s attempts to hack.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate checked the Protophorm\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Inside the small base at the center of the cavern the pod that \nhoused the=\r\n protoform still stood. However the pod itself looks \nheavilly damaged, its=\r\n door no where to be seen, and the cables that \nhad once transfered power a=\r\nnd data to it now dangled in the air or \nlay strewn on the floor. The room =\r\nitself is littered with debris, \nsmoke filled the air and none of the compu=\r\nter systems that had \nmonitored the pod are active. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &quot;Greetings Dar=\r\nkfate!&quot; A voice spoke from the darkness as=A0twin \noptics seemed to almost =\r\nwink on and then stare out at Darkfate from \nthe darkness.
