They will be known as The Guardians of the Embassy. \nThey will protect it at all costs. But they musn&#39;t attack! For \nZardus, after a few days of training, we will go together to face \nhim.&quot;\n\nVulois welcomes Windrazor to his group.\n\n(OOC: I know this might screw up everything we&#39;re doing, but isn&#39;t it \nagainst the rules to have a char who controls other bots that aren&#39;t \nother chars, sorta like the whole Beast Machine Drone thing? It&#39;s on \nthe rules page somewhere.)\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n(Spears seems the one who orchastrated this whole reapir thing, so I \nassumed that she could make decisions.)\n\nBronco and Fliq ran out of the Ark and found spears watching some \nnewcomer. They didn&#39;t bother with introductions, they would come \nlater. They ran right to Spears.\n\nFliq: Spears! I&#39;ve developped away for us to collect as much needed \nparts as possible. We can alter a pod and take it to the moon to \ncollect wreckage from the ship we crashed on. It could make it \ncompletly re-built, except for the flying part. All we need is your \ngo ahead, and we&#39;re set! What do you say?\n\n\n"}}
