With three factions wanting his allegience already, there was sure to \nbe conflict. Weapons would be most handy.\n\nIn his left arm was mounted a taser with three shots charged. He began the \nprocess to liquify his arm nanobots and bring the lazer to the surface in a \nnewly created mounting. This would take about a half an hour for a crude job; \nSeveral hours would be necessary for fine craftsmanship but Vorb knew he \ndidn&#39;t have that long.\n\nWhile Vorb was handling the modifications in VorbIss&#39;s beast-mode weasil \nform, Iss began to raise a medium-strength argon cutting lazer that he had \nbeen secretly forming. Iss kept it immediately below the surface of the skin, \nand by manipulating the nano-controller tendrils carefully he ensured that \nVorb was unaware. Iss trusted Vorb to make policy decisions, and a taser was \nat best a gentleman&#39;s gun. Iss would play backup, in case something happened.\n\n&quot;Iss, are you there?&quot; thought Vorb, not hearing from his companion for a few \nmoments. [Yes, I&#39;m here] replied Iss. &quot;What were you doing?&quot; asked Vorb. \n[Thinking. We know there is a shuttle approaching, even with our weak \nsensors. There are at least three known factions on this planet, each \nobviously wanting to ally itself with us. They, too, can detect the shuttle. \nThey have surely heard the message from the Alliance as well. They cannot \nallow us to become an ally with their enemy.]\n\n&quot;What are you saying?&quot; though back Vorb. &quot;That we&#39;re some hot figure? I don&#39;t \nthink so. Yeah, my body is made of nanoprobes which is something special, but \nthey don&#39;t know it. Why do I care that lots of them want me? That lets me \npick and choose.&quot;\n\n[You care because the enemies of the Alliance will try to get to us before \nthe shuttle arrives. We must assume that this body is a very valuble \nresource, and potentially worth a craft of greater speed and firepower than \nthe shuttle sent by The Alliance. It is good that you were armed, Vorb, for \nwe may be kidnapped.]\n\nIss then shut Vorb out of his mind, and concentrated on enhancing the laser&#39;s \npower systems. If necessary, Iss decided that he could deactivate Vorb for \nthat much more laser power. That would be a last hope, though. \n\nMeanwhile, the shuttle grew louder, and VorbIss&#39;s left arm grew gooier as the \ntaser came to the surface.\n--robin\n\n"}}
