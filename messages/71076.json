He growls angrilly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;GRRRR! That rotten slag b=\r\nall got away!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His expressions change quickly upon finding Elita. A gen=\r\ntile look comes over his face, as he crouches down to check her over, to be=\r\n sure she hadn&#39;t been injured in any way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry little cat, as l=\r\nong as we&#39;re here, that mean slag ball pred isn&#39;t gonna lay another finger =\r\non ya.

We don=92t know if the intruder can turn invisible, or teleport.=94 he sa=\r\nid, grumbling. =93Or both.=94\n\nHe glanced up as Rodimus and Ramulus came ru=\r\nnning down the halls towards them!\n\nRodimus almost skidded to a halt, his s=\r\nharp optics easily picking out Elita, his chest mounted headlights flicking=\r\n on to illuminate the dead end they were all standing in. =93Elita, you alr=\r\night?!?=94 he said as he looked over at her, concern for her etched in his =\r\nface. \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nMeanwhile, a few halls away the intruder, squatting in the =\r\nhalls gets a message . . . \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =93When you are ready to leave, tol=\r\nd me, I=92ll create a distraction=94said cold \n&gt; Hydras =93IF YOU HARM A DE=\r\nCEPTICON IN THE ARK YOU WILL REGRET IT, DO YOU \n&gt; UNDERSTAND???=94\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=\r\nThe intruder looked down at the heavily damaged form of Lord Elder and smil=\r\ned, =93But of course I hear you.=94 He said quietly to Hydras. He looked do=\r\nwn at a timer on his wrist and nodded, =93Begin your distraction; it is tim=\r\ne for me to leave.=94 \n\nMEANWHILE BACK OUTSIDE:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the Ar=\r\nk, Tucson did not like the idea that his comrades and his home were being c=\r\nompromised by the Predacon forces. He knew something had to be done, and di=\r\nd not care what condition he was in. For now, Rat Trap had stopped the leak=\r\ning of battery fluid, and for this moment, with the regular flow of fluid b=\r\nack into his system, he could at least transform into his robot mode, with =\r\njust a bit of pain from his injurred arm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Torca, thank you for your h=\r\nelp, I appreciate it deeply. Now, it&#39;s my turn to contribute to the cause. =\r\nThe only way we&#39;ll be able to regain control of the Ark, is if we throw off=\r\n a disrupter wave, that will cancel out enemy programming. I am now capable=\r\n of doing so since we are at such close range.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He narrows his optics d=\r\nangerously. This meant he was fully prepared to do whatever it took to rega=\r\nin the Ark&#39;s control.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift transforms and prepares to back up =\r\nhis commander.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; This is gonna work, I know it will.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson then t=\r\nransmits to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, as full control of the Ark is re establi=\r\nshed, it will be your\n&gt; opportunity to head a clean sweep of the Ark entire=\r\nly. That means any enemy\n&gt; forces that are still present, will be yours for=\r\n the capture. But do not\n&gt; destroy. Anyone you find, will be valuable for q=\r\nuestioning. Once captured,\n&gt; they&#39;re to be brought to the questioning room,=\r\n where I will personally\n&gt; question them myself. Good luck comrade.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n\nRodimus responded, =93Gotcha. We=92ll be ready.=94\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; His expr=\r\nession turns resolute as he now stands solidly with a firm foot on the grou=\r\nnd. He begins to transmit the most powerful sonar wave ever emitted by his =\r\nsystems.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, I&#39;m transmitting now. Be prepared. Leo ll, I&#39;ll need =\r\nyou to head\n&gt; another scouring team on the outer parameter of the Ark. No d=\r\noubt if there\n&gt; are any enemy forces that have escaped, they may still be w=\r\nithin range of\n&gt; capture. Take the south parameter and extend your search a=\r\ns widely as you see\n&gt; fit. Noctorro, I will need you to head a group of Max=\r\nimals to scour the North\n&gt; Parameter outside the Ark&#39;s boundaries. The furt=\r\nher we go, the better our\n&gt; chances are at capturing enemy intruders. Night=\r\n Shift, I want you to go with\n&gt; Kup, and scour the East Paramater. Talon, W=\r\nindlord, Rat Trap, you will take\n&gt; the West Parameter. Go as far as all of =\r\nyou see fit, but safely within range.\n&gt; It&#39;s our only assurance of securing=\r\n our base from further attack.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLeagcy responded, =93Understood. Sh=\r\nutting down shield now.=94 He said. The reason behind this maneuver was obv=\r\nious, if he did not, the shield would more than likely repel most if not al=\r\nl of Tuscon=92s blast wave. \n\nAt the same time each of the Maximals gave th=\r\neir assent to Tuscon and go off in different directions. It was time to cle=\r\nan up the area around the Ark, and make sure there were not other surprises=\r\n waiting for them. \n\nMeanwhile Tuscon began his wave assault! Like a tidal =\r\nwave constructed of ultrasonic sound the blast began to roll over the Ark, =\r\nthe very air shimmering in its path. \n\nInside the Ark different systems beg=\r\nan to spark as the energy quickly overloaded delicate systems. Legacy quick=\r\nly attempted to reroute power, but even he was not entirely successful. \n\nO=\r\nn the bridge several systems shorted causing other back up systems to kick =\r\ninto place. All over the Ark, power that had been previously shut off turne=\r\nd back on flooding the Ark with lights once again . . . and then sending pa=\r\nrts of it back into darkness as circuit breakers blew. \n\n=93FRELL!=94 The i=\r\nntruder barked as he shimmered for a moment, his cloaking device temporaril=\r\ny shorted by Tuscon=92s blast. He looked up, but at the moment there was no=\r\n one near him, the other Maximals having caught up with the little femme bo=\r\nt were a few hallways away.\n\nWith the skill of a master ninja he stepped in=\r\nto the shadows as he pulled out his blades. \n\nMEANWHILE NEAR HYDRAS:\n\nScour=\r\nge kneeled down next to Hydras, as all the sweeps were doing to keep the le=\r\nad Predacon hidden from the sensor beams from the Ark. \n\n=93ACK!=94 Scourge=\r\n said as he watched Tuscon fire his beam at the Ark, =93That must of hurt!=\r\n=94 He could see the power moving over the Ark. \n\nOne of the Sweeps nudged =\r\nScourge and pointed at two Maximals approaching their position, it was Nigh=\r\ntshift and Kup. If that got much closer their cover would be blown!\n\nA mess=\r\nage came from Nighrazor, =93Whatever you=92re going to do Hydras you had be=\r\ntter do it now, the bots are waking up.=94  \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_004A_01CBE0AD.A93C0C80\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Elita/Percep=\r\ntor/Hydras::&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Perceptor&nbsp;=\r\n tried to cut of the main lead, stop the explosion and save \nthe ark!!!!!!!=\r\n Then He yellss in pain, what ever Tucson have done, it really \nhurted. but=\r\n Overcoming the pain contined working and trying to insolate the \nAutobots =\r\nand decepticons from the main mess.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;**********=\r\n***********************&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV \nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: i=\r\nnline; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGH=\r\nT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT size=3D3 face=3DCalibri&gt;Elita lowered her ears and said =93He almost c=\r\naught \nme, dad...
