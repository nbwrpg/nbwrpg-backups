The damned scout ship had \nlasted the trip..barely. They had lost a wing upon landing, not to mention the zillion pieces that had burned off \nin re-entry. Domnijoe knew it was a dumb idea...but Blindchaos had made a stink about the subject. She leaned \nback in her seat and pushed herself away from the piloting consol. At least they had survived the trip. She \ntwirlled herself around in her seat to face Blindchaos. The male Decepticon&#39;s stupid grin was still welded to his \nface. It was enough to make the Desepticon female gag.\n    &#39;Why are you always in such a damn cheerful mood?&#39; she snapped.\n    &#39;Why are you always so grouchy?&quot; Blindchaos countered. His grin grew even wider...just to annoy his \ncrewmate. &quot;Now we&#39;re here, what do we do?&quot; \n     &quot;Beats me.&quot; Domnijoe said. She rose from her seat and looked out the cockpit window. It&#39;s green landscape \nwas still fresh in her mind , even after all those vorns. How she missed the wreched mudball. She just hoped \nthat Decepticons were still on it.\n     &quot;Send out a distress call.&quot;\n     Blindchaos looked up with confusion. &quot;Distress call? We&#39;re not..&quot;\n     The Decepticon jet snorted at her animalistic companion.  &quot;Have you seen the state of our ship? We&#39;ve got a \ndisabled ship. We&#39;re the only ones here. Send out a distress call.&quot;\n    Blindchaos shrugged and sent out a distress call to all Decepticons he hoped were on the planet.\n    &quot;Now lets wait and see...&quot;\n\n********************\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n\n\n"}}
