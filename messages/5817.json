And panzertron, please dont mode Megatron for me, I can do \nit.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: In the frost of the dimming sun, a streak like a shooting star shot \nacross the sky. It got brighter and closer as it broke into the atmosphere \nand then into the sky. The stasis pod began to stableize and then set down \ncarefully on a small rock in the middle of tar pits. The computer sequence an \nthrough, and the DNA scanner picked up a beast mode. The protoform changed, \nand only needed to leave the pod. Unfortunetly, the lid was dented from orbit \nand the computer could not fix it. :::\n\n::: With the computer beeping frantically, Transanulas made his way over the \ntar onto the slab of rock where the pod rested. :::\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Ha, I knew the scanners werent wrong! There still are \nstasis pods in orbit!\n\n::: He bent over and began to remove the Maximal codeing and replace it with \nPredacon data. He stood back and waited for it to open, and then realized it \nwas stuck. :::\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Damn! So close! Open confound you!\n\n::: Ever vigilant and watchful, Marine stepped forward to surprize the \nspider. ::: What are you doing?\n\n::: Transanulas spun around ::: How dare you sneak up on me! Im doing an \nimportant assignment for Hell Beast and cant be bothered by you!\n\n::: Marine, holding his missle launcer ::: I was not aware of this. I will \ncont-\n\n::: Transanulas hissed ::: No, you must&#39;nt! If he found out about this, he \nwould scrap us both! Listen, help me out and open this pid. Together, we \ncould rule the Predacons!\n\n::: Marine ::: You disgust me. Why must you always be so-\n\n::: Transanulas shot him. He was to sick and tired of listening to him. He \nturned to find the pod open, and a beautiful female T-Rex stnading besides \nit. :::\n\n::: Transanulas ::: What have we here?\n\n::: The Fembot looked over the spider. From what Transanulas could see she \nwas smaller thant Megatron when he was in his original beast mode. She was \nmost likely only 5 feet high and not very strong. She was pink and red, with \nwild black hair on her head with two crimsome eyes. :::\n\n::: Fembot ::: My name, is Demona. And who are you?\n\n::: Transanulas began to chuckle ::: I am Transanulas, your master. \n\n::: Demona ::: I find that very difficult to belive. Demona, Terrorize!\n\n::: She transformed quickly. In her robot mode, she stood around 6 feet tall, \nand also she didnt seem very strong in this mode. Unlike Megatron in this \nmode, her beast mode hear wasnt attacched to her right arm, and her tail was \nnot attached to her left arm. Her beast mode head was her midsection and \nhips, and her tail ran down her spine. The only wepons that were visible was \na small pistol attached to her hip. :::\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Well, belive it. Just because your taller than me dos-\n\n::: Demona snapped back ::: Shut up! Take me to the Predacon base now. \n\n::: Transanulas ::: Witch, you will d-\n\n::: Demona shot him square in between his eyes. She began to walk, a very \nsexy swagger. In her red and pink armor she made her way out of the tar pits. \nMarine, still conscience grabbed her from behinde. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Halt! You are a new Predacon?\n\n::: Demona screamed ::: I have had enough men manhandleing me today! AHHHHHH!\n\n::: Marine stood back. Demona took her small pistol and dug into Marines \nabdomen. She fired, sending the blast through his back. He slummed to the \nground, :::\n\n::: Marine ::: I have met my match, and it is a fembot...\n\n::: Demona glared at him ::: The name is Demona.\n\n::: With that, she fired and blew Marines face apart. The giant turtle bot \nwas dead, and the spider was missing. Demona pushed him with all of her might \ninto the tar pit, and Marine sunk quikly, his green eyes faded as what was \nleft of his face was swallowed by the tar. Only bubbles \nremained. :::\n\n::: Demona put her gun away and started off to the Predacon base. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron stood up and began to walk around the ridge, glanceing here and \nthere, and then turned to Panzertron. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: So, what are your intentions for this vessle? And for the \nBeast Wars?\n\n"}}
