IMH it is much more\ninteresting sometimes to intercept than to just dodge when you think you\ndont want to accept dammage. And Jeff, in the show they did intercept,\nussually missiles with gun fire, but sometimes more powerful rays\nagainst each other. Megatron and Dinobots laser war from Double Dinobot\ncomes to mind. In the original series, Slag even ignited a missile with\nhis flame breath before it reached him, and I&#39;m not sure, but I think\nInferno did it too.\n\n"}}
