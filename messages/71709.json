So for here it is more of a process, usually involving a CR\n&gt;&gt; chamber or being a new protoform. In essence you have to be &#39;reset&#39; to\n&gt;&gt; protoform status and then you can rescan for a new unit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mind folks wanting to change into new forms, but once you do\n&gt;&gt; you are stuck with it for a while unless you are ready to spend some\n&gt;&gt; down time to do it. Just talk to me first please. It makes things so\n&gt;&gt; much easier :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Plus wasn&#39;t nightshift going for a feline beast mode at one point? I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t see beast modes being like clothing that you can just put on and\n&gt;&gt; take off. :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
