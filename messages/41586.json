He looks over the map, and frowns for a second at the question.\n\n&quot;I know of some old Destrons that I could search out,&quot; he replies after a few seconds of thought, &quot;And I have several friends amongst the Predacons, although I doubt they would leave thier faction. THe old Destrons, though, are very likely soldiers.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  he stood up. His wings spread. Guiledart stood behind him on the right. God \n&gt; Neptune behind him on the left. Galvatron laughed. &quot;Welcome home Shredder.&quot; \n&gt; he walked around the command table and popped up the hologram. It showed all \n&gt; the bases on the planet and the ark base near the moon. he had seen it on his \n&gt; orbit of his spark. &quot;I wish for you to be my second in command. For you are \n&gt; lucky enough to be liveing in a new era. The era of the Destrons. And I shall \n&gt; lead us into that era. With you as my right hand man.&quot; he looked over the \n&gt; map. &quot;But we need more soilders.
