But ah guess we&#39;s could use another \nbot &#39;round here.&quot; He lightly tilted his head. &quot;But ya know, ya can \nalways delete it. Yer choice, though. Yer decision&#39;s mah decision.&quot; \nHe never guessed there would be something that would come on-line \nwith his genes. It was bizzare. He tried to hide it that he was \ntruely nervous about the whole thing.\n\n\n"}}
