She was also getting mad at the bot who hurt her \nfriend. She was wishing she was bigger, so she could get back at that \nbot. &quot;Zeni, you just hang on. You can&#39;t leave, ok? So you can die.

OK&quot;\n\nTrinity didn&#39;t know how badly Zeni was hurt or what exactly was wrong \nwith him. But she was scared to lose another bot whom she felt close \nto.  She had lost her entire family and now was worried she would \nlose a friend. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Technosis: He&#39;s knocked out, this is bad.
