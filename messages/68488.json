Center\nof all of this would be an unknown Decepticon (Malice), the focus of\nthier attacks, or atleast of thier attention. \n\nHydras, and Myrmidon look to be talking with Malice, while Malice is\nprojecting an image of Megatron X through some sort of communications\ndevice. (Although as Megatron X is distracted but the image is still\nbeing displayed, I would suspect that now we are all being treated with\nthe image of Megatron X conversting with the others in Relay?? ... or\nwhere ever he is??)\n\nHope I have that right.\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;Alright!
