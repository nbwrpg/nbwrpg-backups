He\nfires four missiles in the air, mentally controlling them to fly in\ncircles above Astroblast.\n\n&quot;Give the Maximal back and I will let you leave in peace,&quot; Element\nsays to Astroblast, ready to direct the missiles to strike the\nshuttle at any seconds.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I forgot to respond about the four missiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; Menasor tried to whirl around, but only successfully dodged two\nmissiles. &gt; The remainder struck him in the back with a sickening\nexplosione. He leaned &gt; against Astroblast to gain his ballance. He\nwas considerably weaker now, &gt; and furious, but he knew that now was\nnot the time for this anger. He put &gt; what was left of Firearm inside\nAstroblast, then with his free arm, grabbed &gt; his burnt arm, trying\nto ease the pain.\n\n\n"}}
