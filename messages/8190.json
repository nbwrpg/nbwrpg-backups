She looked around.  She used her telescopic vision to see his \npaw prints on the forest floor.  She took flight again and followed \nthe paw prints.  The led to the entrance of a cave. She grinned and \nperched on a Spruce tree branch.  She waited for him to come out.  \nFor while she saw his prints, she also saw the prints of a bear \nleading into the same cave. She grinned and waited.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine stood near the cave opening looking back. shadow wing was \n&gt; to far away to see but he did smell her. quickly he circled around. \n&gt; she was within a couple miles of him, he smelled the sweet scent of \n&gt; her feathers, he thought he could hear the whistleing wind as she \n&gt; beat her wings. she&#39;d continued north where he turned off.&quot;To the \npit \n&gt; with the caves,&quot;He looked to the sky and in his deepest most \nvibrant \n&gt; voice did something he hadn&#39;t done since joining the Maximals.\n&gt; \n&gt; HOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; His voice echoed, his mech fluid boiled, at last there was hunter \nand \n&gt; prey, he didn&#39;t know at the moment which he was, he just knew that \n&gt; once shadow wing heard his cry of the wild, she&#39;d know that she&#39;d \n&gt; just become the prey.\n\n\n\n"}}
