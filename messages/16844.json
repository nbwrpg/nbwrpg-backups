And one the humans would forever take for granted, or \nat least the majority of them.\n\tBut now the sun was close to breaking the surface of the east, in one burst \nof light it would shine forth and present the brilliance of a new morning on \nEarth.\nDinobot simply watched the eastern border for a few moments longer; no other \nsound other then the flapping of a dragons wings. Simple silence, just as it \nwas so many solar-cycles ago where there was only one objective: Find the \nMatrix.\nIn which he never did.\nAnd there was no chance he would die again as honorably as he had the first \ntime, but also refused to die in the first place.\nBut even now, his rage towards the Matrix gone, tucked away in the shadows \nof his mind once again, there was still one question, which he didn�t know \nif it could ever be answered.\nWhich he spoke out loud�*\n\n� If I wish to die, why do I wish to live?�\n\n* He had received the honored death in which he had always dreamed of in his \npast life, but he had not been admitted into that shining place in which \nevery transformer was destined to be if they had followed the right path, \ninstead he had wondered both space and time for an uncountable number of \nyears and found out the meaning of true loneliness.\nDinobot knew what it was like to be truly alone, with no hope of ever \nreaching a destination.\nAnd he didn�t wish to experience such a fate again, though in the end of \nthis life he may be forced to do so�again.\nIf there was a Matrix out there, then he did not find it.\nBut it still tugged on his mind if he WAS supposed to find it?\nPerhaps death was not meant for him then, so he was pushed back here.\nPerhaps he was meant to find something that he had been looking for his \nentire life?\nPerhaps simply to finish the war he and others had started?\nWhatever the reason, he was here now. And he guessed that was all that \nmattered.\nBut he HAD been cheated as well, denied the place in the heavens as a \nremembered hero. And instead, hauled to this place once again, to continue \nthe Beast Wars.\nIt was confusing, but it also made a bit of sense as well.\nIt was only right for one to finish what they helped create, but what would \nhappen after that?\nWould he then go on and live out his life back on Cybertron, or even here? \nOr would the Matrix finally summon his spark and he would finally be \nadmitted into its hold as he was destined to be?\nEither was fairly suitable to him, but which he preferred�he could not say.\nIndeed he wanted what was rightfully due, but he also didn�t wish to leave.\nThere was far too much for him here now, he couldn�t just leave.\nDinobot looked over at Tavatron just as the sun broke the eastern horizon in \none single burst of light, simply looking at her.\nNo, he couldn�t leave now, not with one whom seemed to care about him so.\nIt wouldn�t be fair to either party.\nHowever, he was still a little hot that the Matrix had to go on and dump him \nback here, right into the center of the same was as when he died.\nBut he was here now and there wasn�t a slag that he could do about it, which \nleft him with one last alternative.\nLive it out and see what happens in the end, and that was about all he could \ndo.\n\tDinobot could feel the bunching and relaxing muscles of Necromancer \nunderneath his clawed feet, but knew from their change of altitude that they \nwere landing.\nBut he had completed his mission; he had gotten Tavatron, with help, back to \nthe Cybertronian Fire.\nAnd once she was inside a CR chamber and fully healed, all would be fine.\nBut then, as Necromancer came to land and stop abruptly, Dinobot dug his \nclaws into the scales of his back, but they were thick enough that the great \ndrak wouldn�t feel it.\nHe had felt Necromancer come to a stop and had watched Tavatron take a dive \ninto the dirt, him staying securely in place until the dragon had come to a \nfull stop.\nDinobot unhooked his claws from Necromancer�s scales and simply walked \ntowards and down the living ramp in which he had created for them.\nDinobot leaned his head over one he stood in the center of the draks head, \npeering into the huge eye. *\n\n� My appreciation for the lift.�\n\n* And simply with that, he jumped swiftly from Necromancers skull and \nplodded over towards Tavatron and Foxfinger.\nHis systems were doing rather well for a bot whose fourth fluid pump was \nready and able to go offline\nBut there was one thing he knew for sure if not anything else, the second he \ntransformed into robot mode that pump would deactivate.\nSomething that he wasn�t looking forward to. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
