Now, as for these Tripredacus forces, our sensor logs \nshow that the existing group on this planet - what&#39;s left of it \nanyway - has joined up with the new contingent.  Judging by the size \nand classification of the ship and what I know about the first group, \nI estimate their combined forces to be somewhere between 8 and 20 \nindividuals - at least some of which will be elite warriors.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil: That could be. I haven&#39;t seen what they brought here, but\n&gt; if it&#39;s big, it can mean they&#39;ve got either a lot of resources or \nthey\n&gt; brought all they had.\n&gt; \n&gt; He picked up a loose bolt from a compartment in his arm and threw it\n&gt; at the forcefield.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: By the way, keeping a prisoner is generally considered an\n&gt; act of war. I don&#39;t mind staying a little more to find out what\n&gt; happens with the Tripreds, but getting this forcefield off is a \nleast.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Devilcat scratches his chin.  &quot;It would seem to me that whatever \n&gt; &gt; ruckus is happening, the Tripred forces are getting the better of \nit -\n&gt; &gt;  otherwise why would they spare a ship and crew to this \ndirtball?  If \n&gt; &gt; that is the case, it puts the Rogues and the Maximals on the same \n&gt; &gt; side of the battlefield, temporarily at least.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil nodded.

However, they sent me here to fetch Talos. As Talos is a \ngreat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leader of men, I assume they needed him for either a large-scale\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operation or a military planning. Either way, I believe the so-\n&gt; &gt; called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tripredacus are some important military guys, and I think they \ncould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be aiming for Cybertron. What they&#39;re here for, though... Could \nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they&#39;re seeking the Ark or the Nemesis, but your bet&#39;s as good \nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mine. I don&#39;t really know about them except as rumors as an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; underground organization, but I don&#39;t think the Preds are with \nthem,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at least not in practice.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not wise to make demands of someone who could kill you \nout \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand,&quot; Devilcat warns.  &quot;But in any event, I&#39;m prepared to \nreturn \n&gt; &gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to your Maximal brethren - IF you can help us in dealing with \n&gt; &gt; these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tripredacus buffoons.
