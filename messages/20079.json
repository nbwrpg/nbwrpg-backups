She wondered slightly of just where they \nwere going, and if there would be plenty of victims there.\nBut before she had the chance to think about feeding again the ship gave a \nsharp jerk and her grip on the wall failed.\nShe slammed against the corner of a hallway before she went flying down in, \na surprised yell ripped from her lips.\n\nBut then suddenly she slammed up against something hard, slightly. But \nlittle did she knew that it was another bot, BloodyStrike in fact.*\n\n\n\n&gt;The shuttles carrying the Alliance base reach the ocean, flying\n&gt;ahead. They would soon reach the island the Iron Fist was at.\n&gt;\n&gt;At the Iron Fist, work drones (no guns or anything) were clearing an\n&gt;area of the island for the Alliance base. The island was a half-\n&gt;circle, with the Iron Fist floating in the indent. It was about three\n&gt;miles away from the mainland. Metal plates covered the sides of the\n&gt;island, running down toward the ocean floor.\n&gt;\n&gt;Island map (just a general idea of what it looks like.
