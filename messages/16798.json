He flew up to Zardus.\n\n&quot;Sir, I have an idea. If these bots truly mean what they say, let me \ntest their loyalty by letting me take them back to KitKat and help \ndefeat Megatron. It would benefit all, except Megatron of course.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron arrived at the probe.

I can not wait forever!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nBlaze had completed the new head. It&#39;s wires were all made new, and \nit had Striker&#39;s face, so that when the Maximals look at it they will \nknow that their once great comrad was the one killing them. She re-\nattached the head, and was going to get Prebon when Hammer, Bullet \nand Ignatius ran in.\n\n&quot;We did it! We have completed our new weapon suit, the BH2. Complete \nwith rocket launchers, plasma cannons, infa-red goggles and two \nswords. It&#39;s great!&quot;\n\n&quot;Good, because our new mercenairy is finished. He will find great use \nfor that. PREBON!!!!&quot;\n\nPrebon entered the room, with a big smile on his face.\n\n&quot;Are we ready? Is he finished?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, and his war suit is done as well.&quot; Blaze lifted the body and \npopped off the face plate. She flipped a switch, bringing him out of \nstasis lock, and put the plate back on.\n\n&quot;Everyone...I give you our ex-maximal turned cold-blooded killer. \nMeet....Slayer!&quot;\n\n(Take it from here, Yanshosh.)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
