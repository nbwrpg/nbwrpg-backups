He searched the database. He knew \ndestructor had dl&#39;d it to the new base before he got rid of the other one. He \nalso knew that base was not destroyed but an illusion like the one they made \nbefore. he found destructor&#39;s spark signature. he dl&#39;d it to his nueral net. \nSo one day he could returm his fallen leader. (if it wasnt done yet please \nadd destructor to the matrix list.)\n\n"}}
