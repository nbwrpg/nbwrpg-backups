He\nlooked much like the predacon DINOBOT II, including the mechanical as\nwell as organic sides of his face and the sneer that was on his lips.\n\n&quot;You have returned Dark Rodimus.&quot; the figure said as he stepped out,\nstanding taller than most. &quot;And you have brought us a present.&quot;\n\n&quot;No Rapticon, I have brought myself a gift. My wife, and she will\nremain mine!&quot; DARK RODIMUS held on to her firmly.\n\nThere was a wicked and toothy smile from RAPTICON as he bowed his\nhead, &quot;Ahh, as you say then.&quot; He looked up at NIGHTLIGHT, his more\nmechanical optic glowing red for a moment as if scanning her. &quot;They\nwant to see you.&quot; He said to DARK RODIMUS.\n\nDARK RODIMUS nodded, &quot;I had assumed as much.&quot;\n\nRAPTICON tilted his head to once again look at NIGHTLIGHT more fully,\n&quot;Shall I hold your gift for you . . . watch over her?&quot;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; DARK RODIMUS said with a firm authority, &quot;She is with me.&quot;\n\nThere was a faint look of disappointment in his optics but RAPTICON\nnodded, &quot;Of course.&quot; he said as he turned back to the console, pressed\na button and the door to the room slid open. He smiled again looking\nalmost hungrilly at NIGHTLIGHT.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
