Her body finally finished it&#39;s mutation and her open \nwounds healed. She slowly awoke in the chamber. Her form was as it \nwas, polar bear with the the ability to chanbe the head into a bot \nhead. She looked around inside the chamber.  The virus in her was now \nnullified and no longer existant and her body was now immune to the \nvirus.\n\nShe opened the door to the chamber and lumbered out. Still a little \ndrowsy from the seditive, but awake. She stood up on her hind legs \nand changed into semi bot form. She looked at Lunarpine and Veratis.\nHer robotic eyes looking back and forth between the two bots.\nShe was still nervouse about being caged up. She wasn&#39;t sure if the \nvirus inside her was still active. \n\n\n\n"}}
