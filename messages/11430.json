He was doublecrossed by the \nAlliance, and brutally butchered by Nemises Enforcer and some other guys.  \nWindrazor is my new character and will be waiting to join Vulois(hes at the \nEmbassy).  Battera is doing so well with the Maximals that she has her own \nquarters, and Cybershark is about to meet Megatron on neutral ground.  \nBlackarachnia is basicly in control of the Preds, and Darkmouse died and came \nback in the same day.  Feline and Skulletron are in the CF trying to mess \nwith the Maximals hearts.  Hows that?\n\n"}}
