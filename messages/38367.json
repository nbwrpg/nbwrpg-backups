He leapt into the air, letting the suction \npull\n&gt; him into outerspace, then backwards, until he transformed into his \njet\n&gt; mode, and his thrusters slowly corrected him. Caliburst looked \naround at\n&gt; space, from the inside. He had seen it so many times, it was just\n&gt; &quot;different&quot; somehow. Probably something about him knowing that he \nmight\n&gt; die soon.\n\n\n"}}
