He quickly looked around doing a quick check of the room.\n&gt; &quot;Great.&quot; he said as he noted that there was no other exit but the one\n&gt; above them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile above things were seemingly going well for the Decepticons\n&gt; and Predacons who appeared to be further away from the hole, that is\n&gt; until Cyclonus and Deepstryke noticed something.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir?&quot; Cyclonus said to Hydras as he looked at the hole in front of\n&gt; them and then at the black Autobot tank that had just burst through\n&gt; the door, &quot;Um, perhaps we should not still be standing here the rest\n&gt; of the floor is not stable . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; Deepstryke, rather than firing at those in the hole began firing at\n&gt; the tank, however his shots could not penetrate the shielding,\n&gt; although he could clearly see the shield beginning to weaken under\n&gt; their sustained fire. Phobia followed suit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus from below watched as Tuscon and Nightshift attempted to use\n&gt; some sort of ninjabot training. He shook his head, wishing he had paid\n&gt; more attention to those classes. However he did remember one thing as\n&gt; he looked upwards, &#39;always be prepared.&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; hand retracted and in its place was a grappling hook which he\n&gt; fired upwards, and with a click it latched onto something above. As\n&gt; fast as he could he began to climb out of the hole, while still\n&gt; dodging the firepower that was coming from above!\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus swung around as he felt a blast of heat as several shots came\n&gt; close to hitting him, one causing him to spin as his shoulder was\n&gt; clipped! &quot;We are clay pigeons down here!&quot; Rodimus grunted as he\n&gt; continued to climb.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy oriented his main cannon at the Predacons and Decepticons, his\n&gt; intention was not to hit them, but to destroy the floor beneath their\n&gt; feet, and send them tumbling down into the hole as well! The front of\n&gt; the tank glowed as energy was built up, and then a beam of light and\n&gt; destructive energy was fired from the great cannon muzzle vaporizing\n&gt; the floor!\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s voice intoned over the radio, &quot;Then I would suggest vacating\n&gt; this location as soon as possible.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
