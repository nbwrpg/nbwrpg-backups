But if you&#39;re using Dragon Ball Z as\n&gt; an example, ( I said IF, I am not accusing) in Japan\n&gt; they called them &quot;Artificial Human&quot; instead of\n&gt; androids. Keeping in mind that the English versions\n&gt; are extremely stupid, I wouldn&#39;t trust those suckas.\n&gt; I myself would classify the characters like 17 and\n&gt; 18 of DBZ as cyborgs. King of like in The\n&gt; Terminator, except they feel pain where the\n&gt; terminator didn&#39;t. Geez, man, why did Dr. Gero make\n&gt; his machines feel pain? I guess so they can have the\n&gt; ability to heal themselves like the Terminator did\n&gt; not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just me rambling on...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: catmastero\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:35 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Owlhawk&#39;s training\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot;\n&gt; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: That&#39;s what he said, Catmastero...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   I said an android is built to look human but isn&#39;t\n&gt; organtic, not a\n&gt;   machine with organtic parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
