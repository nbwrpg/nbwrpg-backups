She singled out the \nintruder&#39;s signature and locked on. &quot;He&#39;s the one not being chased. \nFigures because the intruder is doing the chasing. I hope Chameleon \nwill be ok. KitKat3, Darkfate and Drillbit will handle them. But I&#39;m \nnot taking chances, I&#39;ll keep them backed up from here.&quot; \n\nShe finished her scans of all the bots in the fortress. &quot;Hmmm, that&#39;s \nodd.  KitKat&#39;s scan signature is only a half a millipulse off.  Hmm, \nI guess she&#39;s just over tired. Poor kid, dealing with coming back to \nlife, having,&quot; she grimaced,&quot;Mr.Lovey Dovey to put up with and then \nall this. Dang, she&#39;s a better bot than I. But then, I went through \nit too, so oh well.&quot;  She hurried through her systems and kept on \nwith the back up with the autoguns, but kept them at manual control. \n\n\n"}}
