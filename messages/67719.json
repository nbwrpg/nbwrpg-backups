So instead of asking about every\nsingle thread, I&#39;d thought I&#39;d ask all my questions at once.\n\nAtlantis:\n\nWhere are Rodimus (hot rod), Nightlight, Elita, Remus?  Do they still\nneed help out at the duel site or is that over?\n\nAre the other maximals still in atlantis.  I know they came back in\nthe shuttle, where are they?\n\nWhat is dinobot doing?  what happened at watchers hq?  Are the\nwatchers calling Salveo?\n\nHydras:\n\nSounds like someone is breaking into the base?  Trelos and another\npred were in the CR.  Trelos should be getting out soon.  (btw, Trelos\nis insane and really strong lol)\n\nRelay:\n\nNot sure at all what&#39;s going on there.  My new character is entering\nthe city soon. What&#39;s the status of IS preds, the other maximals are\nin atlantis right?\n\nPentatron:\n\nWhat I understand is, the minions are looking for Blacknightmare, right?\n\nSearing Eye:\n\nSo minions now have the matrix and are growing?\n\n"}}
