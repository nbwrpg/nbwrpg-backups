I would imagine a dragon would be about the size of a T-rex.\nHe would become as large as say Beast Megatron would be. (I say Beast\nmegatron and to differentiate them from their G1 versions)\n\nI would put all of them at about 28 feet tall or so. Most of your\nother leader class figure would be there as well: Hydras, Magmatron,\nCryotek.\n\nYour Optimal versions would be a bit bigger perhaps 32&#39;. They would be\nlike your Optimal Rodimus and Optimal Optimus for instance. They are\nnot a whole like bigger, but somewhat. This difference of about 4&#39;\nmakes them stand head and perhaps shoulders taller than the rest.\n\nI was watching a toon where Beast Wars Megatron was able to catch G1\nStarscream in his jaws and throw him. So for most of the Beast wars\ncreatures you could be as large as your real world beast mode could be\n- assuming you have one. I expect dragons are like Dinosaurs.\n\nHowever for folks who would get smaller get smaller like say Rat Trap\nor Waspinator, they would stay they same size as they are now. They\njust become big versions of their beastmodes. (IE a 5&#39; long rat or 6&#39;\nlong Wasp)\n\nAs a note, just because one person turns into the same animal type as\nanother does not always mean that they are the same size. For instance\nOptimus Primal is smaller than Optimal Optimus Prime even they both\nhave a Goprilla alt mode. And I think Beast Galvatron is larger than\nBeast Megatron. Optimus Primal becomes more of a big ape where Optimal\nOptimus becomes something larger - the Same thing with B-Megatron and\nB-Galvatron! :)\n\nBut I hopes this makes sense?? Feel free to write if you have any\nquestions, comments or suggestions. Nothing is quite set in stone yet.\nI am still reading and looking at pictures and such to make sure I\nhave things right. If you have anyhting you would like to throw in go\nahead.\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/30/12, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I was wondering about Tucson&#39;s size, due to his dragon beast form.

I am taking time to set myself\n&gt;&gt; up for another set of storylines, and am trying to do a better job of\n&gt;&gt; writing down my basic lines before I jump in :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So I apologize for delays, please give me another day or so to be set.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One thing I have been discussing with Airly is allowing for the larger\n&gt;&gt; sizes here. There was an old rule that everyone had to be Beastwars\n&gt;&gt; sizes, but I think I am going to fudge that one a bit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am planning on shifting us to more of a movieverse size scale. If\n&gt;&gt; you look at the IDW and the 3H comics that did Beastwars, they mention\n&gt;&gt; the size change, but never say how much and Rodims and Primal appear\n&gt;&gt; to be nearly the same sizes. I think Primal is BIGGER\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So here is a size scale that I might be inclined to use:\n&gt;&gt; http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/6/67/ROTF_Autobot_scale_guide_1.jpg\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is based on the ROTF so I think it will work. This way we can range\n&gt;&gt; anywhere from about human sized for some of the really small Maximals\n&gt;&gt; and Predacons to the really large.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My question is: What do you guys think? Do you think this could be\n&gt;&gt; something that would work for your own character concepts?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are differences between Autobots and Maximals as Maximals (and\n&gt;&gt; Decepticons and Predacons) generally the Maximals (and Predacons) are\n&gt;&gt; smaller (although not always) and generally do not size change much\n&gt;&gt; and are more energy efficient.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please let me know your ideas. I would like to know how you feel since\n&gt;&gt; this is as much your world as it is mine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
