He swears, setting\nthe\n&gt; defences on alert.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Computer, scan for anomalies,&quot; he says, the computer giving it&#39;s reports\na\n&gt; second later. It was strange, like nothing Rex had ever seen before. He\n&gt; orders the computer to fully analize it, and figure out how to destroy it,\n&gt; and then turns to Gangon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Any idea of what&#39;s going on?&quot; he asks, holding his gun ready.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
