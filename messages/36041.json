Gauntlet\nactivated his jet pack, and sent himself flying towards Megatron, claw\nstretched out. The two made impact, Gauntlet Prime flying over the body,\ngashing it deeply, and turning it up on itself. He landed a few feet\nback, and Megatron on the top of his tank, upside down. He let out a cry\nof rage, as he transformed, but was to late, Gauntlet Prime had lunged\nforward and gouged Megatron in the side, sending him toppling over onto\nhis side, exposed circuitry fissling. &quot;And now, Peace.&quot; He said charging\nup his glove, and moving in. He leapt at Megatron, but the Slagmaker\nquickly put his feet, and they caught Gauntlet Prime in the chest.\nGauntlet Prime stayed on the feet, motionless from having the his\ncircuits jarred, as Megatron coiled his legs inward, then put his arms\non the ground for leverage. With a grunt he sent the Prime flying back,\ninto a charred building, the floor he hit collapsing a bit under the\nimpact, as Megatron landed gracefully on his feet. As Gauntlet Prime dug\nhimself out, he noticed the barrel of Megatron&#39;s cannon aimed at him,\nand tried to move, but his leg was stuck. Megatron allowed himself a\nsecond to smile, then let his power erupt, heading straight into the\ncurrent Prime. A scream covered the landscape, and then smoke started to\nrise up from the building. Megatron turned his attention towards the\ntrailor, as an ancient robot moved towards the late Gauntlet Prime.\n\n"}}
