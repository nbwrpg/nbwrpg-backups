Airly has offered to help develop \na new site \n&gt; as long as other members help with the development and upkeep.  I \ndo not have \n&gt; the time right now to help in any significant way (AP tests and \nend of year \n&gt; stuff, etc.) so we need volunteers.\n\nWish me good luck and I will do my best.\n\n&gt;        Now for my final piece of business.  I&#39;ve thought long and \nhard about \n&gt; this... At the end of June I&#39;m going to step down from ownership \nof the \n&gt; list...  I&#39;ll be gone through most of July and between work in the \nsummer and \n&gt; starting college in the fall... I don&#39;t have the time to give that \nthis group \n&gt; deserves.  I don&#39;t intend to leave the group as the past owners \nhave but I \n&gt; will need to step back my involvement a bit.  I haven&#39;t yet \ndecided who will \n&gt; replace me... I have a few ideas but I need to check with them \nfirst.  I \n&gt; wasn&#39;t planning on announcing it this soon but I thought giving \nthe group \n&gt; time to prepare for the change would be better than me just fading \nout.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Alright I&#39;m sorry I was so longwinded today.  Back to your \ngame.\n\n\nI hope that you stay with us  a long time more\n\n\n"}}
