It was if Cyclonus was=\r\n draining a\npart of Remus&#39;s core at the same time. Remus couldn&#39;t stand it =\r\nanymore\n. The heroic figth of Rodimus may have destroy all hope of any futu=\r\nr.\nBut it wasn&#39;t Rodimus&#39;s fault. The only one&#39;s to blame was Remus: onle\nh=\r\ne had known what was at sake. He had to stop Cyclonus.\n\nHas he dashed towar=\r\nd Cyclonus, the golden glow from his eyes was\niradiating from all his body.=\r\n He was trying to get to Cyclonus.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super =\r\nCyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus let out a scream that =\r\ncould wake the dead and terrify even\n&gt; &gt; the bravest of bots to their very =\r\nsparks. The wisdom of the ages, the\n&gt; &gt; power of the Matrix had almost been=\r\n Rodimus&#39; life force for so long.\n&gt; &gt; He belonged to the Matrix as much as =\r\nit belonged to him. Now it was\n&gt; &gt; gone. The Matrix shell being depleted as=\r\n it&#39;s awesome power was\n&gt; &gt; extracted from it&#39;s connection with Rodimus&#39; sp=\r\nark. This was the fall\n&gt; &gt; of the legend. The chosen one was beaten and fai=\r\nled to protect the\n&gt; &gt; very thing he was alive to protect.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was n=\r\no change of expression from Cyclonus as Rodimus screamed\n&gt; out. Energy stre=\r\named between them, first from between Cyclonus&#39; hands\n&gt; to Rodimus chest th=\r\nen sparks began to jump all along them. For a moment\n&gt; they rose from the g=\r\nround as powerful electrical fields danced in\n&gt; between them. Wind began to=\r\n blow and once placid waters became strong\n&gt; and choppy For a moment the sk=\r\nies darkend as clouds before the sun, and\n&gt; in the distance thunderclapped =\r\n.. and then all was was complete. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus and Rodimus both fell to t=\r\nhe ground for a moment sprawled out\n&gt; on the sandy beach. Cyclonus sat up h=\r\nis optics going yellow then orange\n&gt; then resuming thier dark red. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ri=\r\nsing into the air Cyclonus&#39; feet merged and boosters replaced them\n&gt; allowi=\r\nng him to hover in place. As he did so it became obvious that\n&gt; something a=\r\nbout Cyclonus had changed with the defeat of this foe. He\n&gt; was still damag=\r\ned, his armor burned and desnted in many places, cracks\n&gt; seeming to run hi=\r\ns full length and yet he was subtly different. He took\n&gt; a moment to survey=\r\n his fallen foe, his look unreadable as if absorbing\n&gt; what had been done. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As he watched Rodimus appeared to glow red as Scourge and the remaind=\r\ner\n&gt; sweeps above &#39;painted&#39; him preparing to destroy him utterly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No.=\r\n&quot; Cyclonus word was clear and final, his face still somber. &quot;He has\n&gt; falle=\r\nn as a warrior, and I will allow him to be buried by his fellows.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe red targetting beams winked off and Rodimus resumed his normal hue.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; From behind Cyclonus Scourge&#39;s gruff voice can be heard, &quot;Hrmph. He wa=\r\ns\n&gt; a fool! Let&#39;s use this moment to destroy him and that city behind us.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus shook his head, &quot;We abide by this battle. We have won, and we=\r\n\n&gt; shall leave.&quot; He turned to look at Scourge, &quot;But we shall be back.&quot; For\n=\r\n&gt; the first time a smile appeared on Cyclonus&#39; face, &quot;but without the\n&gt; mig=\r\nht of Rodimus they will not be able to stand against us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sourge nodde=\r\nd in approval.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus looked skyward as sweeps continued to circle a=\r\nnd as several\n&gt; arrived apparently from some distance away. They merged wit=\r\nh the rest\n&gt; and circled as if waiting. &quot;Is everything in readiness?&quot; Cyclo=\r\nnus asked\n&gt; Scourge without looking away from the sweeps.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Scour=\r\nge&#39;s voice full of eagerness. &quot;everything is going\n&gt; according to plan.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Good.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; smile faded as he rose up into the air and then\n&gt; assu=\r\nmed his starfighter mode. &quot;Then it is time for us to depart. leave\n&gt; Rodimu=\r\ns to his own .. and leave that one as well .. &quot; indicating Remus\n&gt; &quot;He can =\r\nreport our victory to thier remaing leaders, and they will come\n&gt; to fear u=\r\ns, as all will!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a burst of sheer power Cyclonus rose up into the=\r\n clouds as Scourge\n&gt; followed suit and then the sweeps. Then like some dark=\r\n storm they rose\n&gt; high into the air took one last sweep, and then faded in=\r\nto the setting\n&gt; sun, quickly disappearing from all visual sensors.\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n---------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Down below on the sandy beach calm waters continued to=\r\n lap against the\n&gt; fallen form of Rodimus as the tide was begining to come =\r\nin. Trees in\n&gt; the distance began to blow and sway as natural winds resumed=\r\n. the cool\n&gt; breezes blew sand around, slowly begining to cover the scorche=\r\nd sands\n&gt; on the beach. In the skies sea birds cautiously began fly, a few =\r\neven\n&gt; were bold enough to try to land on Rodimus, thinking him a nice warm=\r\n\n&gt; resting place as they looked for fish. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tranquility with unyielding=\r\n boldness and resolve began to reassert\n&gt; itself once more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; =\r\n(Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n______________________=\r\n______________________________________________________________\n&gt; Never miss=\r\n a thing.
