These robots specialize in hunting as the name implies and \nare also very feirce Warriors. After completion of the bots the \nMaximals began to place them with in Maximal ships one each that is \nuntil The preds stole the Maxi ship which halted progress. Only two \nof the bots were created and placed (myself and my brothers \ncharacters) within the preds stolen ship and the maximals trailing \nship. Since the bots are top secret they would be known of by high \nranking bots and are hidden deep within each ship. Since the Hunters \nare programed to follow orders they will probably take alegances with \nwhom ever wakes them up.\n\nOne last thing : My brother wishes to play a Beast wars type \ncharacter within the maximal ship and I wish to play a technorganic \nwithin the pred ship. Is this possable? \n\n\n"}}
