Programmed am I\nwith many reconicence programs and battle sequences.  Night vision and\nlong range vision with audio anhancement technology. I am deamed\nsniper and watchbot.&quot;  Her head lowered as she heard her own programs\nspin in her head.  So many spaces, so much data lost. Scrambled were\nthings she felt she needed to know. Too much time in a pod with too\nlittle power to sustain all her functions. She knew she spoke the\ntruth. To do so would be very detrimental to all those who put trust\nin her. She looked back up at him. &quot;I am Silence. What orders do you\nhace for this Captain of the Ranks?&quot;  Captain? she thought to herself.\nWhere did I come up with that rank. But some how, that felt rather\ncorrect. It must have been her rank before she arrived here. If only\nshe could remember time before waking up in the pod. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rodimus:\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Smiled and said kindly &quot;who&#39;re you and what can you told me\nabout ya? &quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Dark Mouse \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, March 23, 2005 7:06 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Silence\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Silence::\n&gt; \n&gt;   She took a seat.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
