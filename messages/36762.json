Due to all the complaints that we&#39;ve gotten from the members on this battle, the council has thus far come up with the following:\n\n\n\n1. No teleportation whatsoever. This includes all the beaming.\n\n2. No deathglyders/tanks\nfor the time being. This is still being discussed.\n3. Absolutely no anti-shield weapons. No exuses.\n4. All large ships must crash upon entering the atmosphere. Please get those two ships out of the air and into their permanent positions.\n\nWe&#39;re still talking about it, so things might change. These rules take effect immediately.\n\n::Slayer/Incarcinator/EndBringer/Demise::\n\nSlayer dodges most of the beam, his arm being blown off. He curses, firing two blasts from his remaining shoulder cannon back at the ship that had shot him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator is hit by the two shots from the Trainer base, being blown backwards. The beam almost hits him, but he doesn&#39;t notice as he tries to regain balance.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRoaring, EndBringer fires two more missiles at the Trainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise looks around, growling. He didn&#39;t have any good long-range weapons, so he couldn&#39;t really help much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n\n&gt; The Violator shook wildy as it was pelted with autogon fire and other \n\n&gt; blasts. Quickly the ship unleashed a blast from the Vile cannon at the \n\n&gt; trainers base shields, the blast just as big as it was the first time \n\n&gt; it was used. It then locked onto the Infecticon ship and fired all \n\n&gt; four multi phase laser cannon blasts that were about to blow under the \n\n&gt; strain of the charging. The infecticon ship is hit bythe blasts as the \n\n&gt; lasers pierce its shields, a moment later it fires back at the \n\n&gt; Violator with one of its massive cannons making on of the thrusters \n\n&gt; explode outward. Inside Vile and the others fell over from the blast. \n\n&gt; Vile then stood and set a course for Antartica.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Vile: &quot;With any luck the Infecticon ship wont pursue...&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The violator then began to fly away from the trainer base. As this \n\n&gt; happened the weapons fire that was fired at the Infecticon base were \n\n&gt; stopped by its shield that for the most part was invisible. The ship \n\n&gt; began to reposistion itself and once again it fired down the column of \n\n&gt; light at incarcinator, the 8 rings following down to surround him. As \n\n&gt; this happens 4 massive cannons along the edges of the ship begin to \n\n&gt; aim at the trainer base before each fires a massive blast at the base, \n\n&gt; each blast would go through the shields even with the variable \n\n&gt; shielding.(Heh this is a tech on the Infecticon ship, the eight main \n\n&gt; cannons on the ship are able to pass through all shields no matter \n\n&gt; what since they absorb the shields energy into the blast to create a \n\n&gt; hole in them. Yan has the bio and alloran already knows of this so... \n\n&gt; shielding for the trainer base is useless since these blasts are not \n\n&gt; like anything anyone has seen before. Whee not like they&#39;ll matter \n\n&gt; much longer since this ship is going to crash into the ocean in a bit) \n\n&gt; As this happens two blasts from within the ships metallic ring like \n\n&gt; structure fly down at Slyaer as another two fire down at starscream, \n\n&gt; another 4 at the Trainers base shields, these blasts would not \n\n&gt; penetrate the shields since they were from other weapons.\n\n\n\n"}}
