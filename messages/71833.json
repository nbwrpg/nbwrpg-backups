Yet she was going about it in a composed and cle=\r\naver way.  She finds the floor rather slippery under her tiny paw like feet=\r\n and uses that to accidentally on purpose, slide back first, where her quil=\r\nls are the longest and sharpest, right into Wheelie from behind!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Who=\r\nops!  So sorry!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap grimaces as she skids into Wheelie.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Th=\r\nat had ta hurt. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson realizes what&#39;s going on yet says nothing to =\r\nstop his sister .  He knew Wheelie was in for something like that and it wa=\r\ns only a matter of time until he learned his lesson.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; What goes aroun=\r\nd, comes around.  Anyway, we will not have to separate Elita from her mothe=\r\nr, we will just ask them to be part of the capture strategy. I&#39;ve done deco=\r\ny missions before, this should work.  Of course I will be right behind them=\r\n if something goes wrong.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
