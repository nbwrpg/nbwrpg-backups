He \nconnected the wire to her hip and then connected the other side to \nthe pod. He back up back over to Black Arachnia. He swore if this \ndidn&#39;t work he was going to kill the spark. He wasn&#39;t going to lose \nher because an this worthless spark---that was half of his.\n\nHe stood by her waiting for something to happen, when it did. The pod \ncame on-line when it seemingly looked dead. The scanner probe even \nerected. Quickstrike cocked a brow at it.\n\nHe ducked and squinted his optics when the scanner flashed in his \nface. The fan rotated and shrunk down back in its place. \n\nHe stared at the pod with wide optics as the hull of it opened. Out \nstepped a slender bot---with his markings and coloring. Holy slag, it \nwas his daughter. A stupid bot would have passed out by now, but not \nhim. He just stared at her.\n\nShe was was no taller than both of them, with a slim face, wide \ncurving crimson optics, and a silver mouth plate that went from a \ncovered chin to a few inches under her optics. She had a slender \nfigure, like Black Arachnia&#39;s, even with those spider legs mounted \nbehind her arms. Her legs were gold and silver with gray feet. On \nboth her thighs were black holsters equipted with a gun. \n\nShe stared at both of them.\n\n\n(Fact: Quasar is named after a rescued horse.)\n\n\n"}}
