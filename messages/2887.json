Of course her troops would spare Iron Raptor, however, but\nshe walked to the base to say goodbye to her old friend Iron Raptor. She\npassed Ramhorn on the bridge, looking at him she laughed.\n\n&quot;Little Ramhorn, Maximal worshipper!&quot; Plintissa said. Plintissa walked away\nfrom the base, deciding to tell Iron Raptor goodbye over commlink. Plintissa\nand Dracona walked out and sat in the meadow. Plintissa called out to Liono\non her commlink.\n\n&quot;Liono, I don&#39;t give a damn about your troops. It&#39;s time for some maiming.&quot;\nPlintissa said. Dracona pulled out a heavy blaster rifle from her Cyber\nstorage compartment and handed it to Plintissa. Plintissa locked it onto her\narm and smileed. Dracona locked onto her arm an ion disk launcher.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get ready to rumble!&quot; Plintissa yelled out. Plintissa leapt on top of\na rock, Sinesis and Sinister standing behind her with Dracona. Plintissa\ncalled Iron Raptor on her commlink.\n\nIron Raptor, this is Plintissa, sorry but goodbye, I can not be your friend\nanymore, all because i&#39;m not wanted here anymore.
