The Sarga want to \nsee if we deserve the power they&#39;ve given use.\n\nOwlhawk:  WHAT DO THEY THINK I AM, A TRANSMETAL!\n\nOC:  Uhhhh.....Hawk look again.\n\nAs he dodges an asteroid Owlhawk looks at himself and notices HE IS A \nTRANSMETAL!\n\nOC:  Now listen Hawk.  Our first target for the Sarga will be a Vok \nemmisary named Meteera, but they figured we&#39;d also want to work on \ntaking out Megatron, so we&#39;ve basically been designed as his \nexecutioner.  You&#39;ll find we&#39;re more than a match for him strength \nwise, we can follow every move he makes with speed, we at least as \nmuch fire power, and we&#39;re more capable of standing up to high \ntemperatures such as his fire breath than other bots even other \nTransmetals, although nobot can take a direct hit from that and be \nTOTALLY unscathed, not even us.  Now take out the asteroids.\n\nHe fires a mini plasma canon on his wrist at a nearby asteroid \nblowing it to bits, then his lower wings transform into automatic \nrifles and blast most of the rubble.\n\nOOC:  I&#39;m trying to keep posting while I wait for the Vok Destroyer \ndecesion if it ever comes.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m still waiting on the Vok Destroyer decision.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:  The sparks continue circling closer until they connect and \nfuse \n&gt; into one.  Then a solid body forms around them.  Taller than either \n&gt; of there old ones it looks like an angel with 3 sets of wings, a \ntop \n&gt; one being hawks, a middle one being owls, and a lower one being \n&gt; entirely cybernetic.\n\n\n"}}
