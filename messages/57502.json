Hydras, you do not even have the guts to fight me \nlike\n&gt; the leader you pretend to be!  Would you risk all the credibility \nyou\n&gt; have in front of your crew?  Will you prove yourself weak?\n&gt; \n&gt; He sent eight light spears at his nemesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague, on her part, could not dodge the shots from Perceptor. \nNo\n&gt; matter, she struck twice at the Predacons, not worrying about her \nown\n&gt; wounds. She also brought more and more fear in the mind of her \nopponent.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Dragoon, though, saw that things were going quite well. Even\n&gt; though in smaller number, the Tripredacus were fighting well. It was\n&gt; his time now to push the Predacons back.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked for a good target. He found it in Thrust, Terpa and\n&gt; Bumblebee, and fired a massive fireball at the group.\n\n\n"}}
