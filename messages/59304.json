Now, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bloodblade, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is your turn to go, but I have learned from this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the pain stopped, he had forgotten who he was or who he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; served. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He only remembered his name. He started spinning wildly as he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; entered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high orbit and was attracted to the ground.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A few minutes later, he crashed loudly into the ground,\n &lt;BR&gt;exactly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same distance from the three bases.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
