He seemed to be the \nonly one there. He got a slight feeling that Terrorsaur was close-by. \nHe usually was. He spent most of his days in the main section of the \ncave or circling around the sky.\n\nHe looked around, needing to speak to anoter one of his troops, even \nif it had to be Terrorsaur, but he was out of sight. Just then, a \nfrantic black horse came charging into the cave. She whinnied and \nscreamed at him at the same time. It was Wildfire.\n\n~He&#39;s here!~ she shouted, but without moving her mouth. ~Run you \nfool! Fight back!~\n\nMegatron roared at her. Fighting and retreated into nothing, into \ndarkness contended at him without him deciding for himself.\n\n\n"}}
