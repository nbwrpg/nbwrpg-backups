You could&#39;ve taken me down at least a dozen times \nbefore that. You don&#39;t have the killer instinct. At least not YET.&quot; \nLunarpine was worried that there was more damage done than she was \ntelling him, but he didn&#39;t press the point.\n\nShadow Wing asked about sword training\n&quot;You could&#39;ve pulled your daggers any time you wanted. There&#39;s only \none rule I can think of in these matches. No killing the other \nmaximal.\n\nThere was a breeze coming from the west. he&#39;d worked his way east to \nkeep her scent coming toward him. Now he smelled something coming \nfrom the east, the scent was to faint to identify.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked into his eyes.  She could see the fire in his spark \n&gt; burning brightly.  She smiled and felt his hand run through her \n&gt; feathers. &quot;Your right. You can see just fine. And I&#39;m fine. Shook \nup \n&gt; a bit, but fine. Thank you.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed into bot mode and stood for a moment looking into \nhis \n&gt; eyes, his big, beautiful, golden wolf like eyes.  She shook her \nhead \n&gt; as if trying to brake a spell he had put over her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I ah...that was a good move you made. Felling the tree like that. \nI \n&gt; didn&#39;t expect that one at all. I&#39;ll have to be more careful next \n&gt; time.&quot;  she smiled warmly at him and looked again into his eyes.  \n&gt; They were almost hipnotic to her. She knew a wolf&#39;s stare was \n&gt; supposed to be able to almost stare into the heart of a being, but \n&gt; his stare surrounded her. She turned around and looked at the tree \non \n&gt; the ground. &quot;uh, OK, what do you want to teach me next? How to \nfight \n&gt; with swords perhaps?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Are you alright?&quot;Lunarpine asked with more concern in his voice \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d origionally intended.&quot;Are you able to fly?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He helped Shadow Wing to her feet (Talons) and checked her wing. \n&gt; &gt; Nothing appeared to be damaged beyond internal repair \ncapabilities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He looked in her great owl eyes and saw the beast she could&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; &gt; if she wasn&#39;t a transformer. A spark which seemed to be wanting \n&gt; &gt; completion. He kissed the top of her beak and brushed his hand \n&gt; &gt; through her soft downy feathers. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Lunarpine didn&#39;t know when to shut up.&quot;See I told \nyou \n&gt; &gt; not to worry about my eyes.&quot; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
