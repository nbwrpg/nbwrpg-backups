Unless you want to talk to\nflunkies,\n&gt; we will not be going to your ship.  Zardus has disappeared.  He&#39;ll be back\n&gt; soon though&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Follow me.&quot; Nemesis told Delta, heading back for the Alliance base.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn heard Archangle&#39;s transmission.  He sighed.  &quot;What a total\nretard!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster recieved Archangle&#39;s com transmission.  Kluster sighed,\nimmediately\n&gt; activating his com unit in his left wrist.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;This is Kluster, to all Maximals.  I am currently in charge of the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire,  the Maximal craft that crashed onto the planet.  I\nurge\n&gt; you not to follow this idiot Archangle.  Iron Riptor...or whatever, was\n&gt; captured?  Well, did you ever stop to think the plot of the people who\n&gt; captured him is to wait until you make a rescue party, attack, and they\nwill\n&gt; attack back?  Or with allies?&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster sighed over the com.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;From what I understand, the Ark is in total shambles because you guys\ncan&#39;t\n&gt; get your acts together.  We should wait until the Ark and Cybertronian\nFire\n&gt; are repaired and have strong defenses before we go and attack anyone.  I\nmay\n&gt; not be in charge of the Maximals, but that is merely my opinion.  Rushing\noff\n&gt; to get killed isn&#39;t my idea of a compitent mission&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup\n&gt; Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.\n&gt; Install today:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6347/13/_/_/_/962927318/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
