He erased his memory\nand replaced it with false ones putting it into his\nspark so to make them seem perfectly real and\nememenateing the chance of recessive dreams or\nflashbacks of his past life. He added in a few new\nprograms like loyalty to the destrons and the main\nobjective of destroying the earth and was finished.\nHis name was still halucinegen and had the same\ncharacteristics just diffrent memories. Destron\nmemories. Of war and conquest as if he were there for\nevery battle through thier galaxy trips.
