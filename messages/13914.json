Brix is alot older \nthan me though. That&#39;s why he&#39;s the Captain. In fact, when we came to \nPast Earth, it was the first time we were on a planet in over a year. \nWe&#39;ve seen it all! So what about you? You mention sometimes that you \ndied. Is this true?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nSavage\n\nSavage watches as the ship caves in, and laughs. He lands on the \nground and beats the side of the ship with his tail.\n\n\n"}}
