Ironhide frowned. It was really a pathetic\ncounter to Pacifix. He was suprised with Pacifix&#39;s maturity, it normally\ntook Autobots eons to grow up, at least, it did for him. &quot;Is anyone\nopposed to the Dinobots going along?&quot; He asked. The room was silent, you\ncould have heard a nebulan clip his tone nails. He had expected more\nagainst it, then realized that Grimlock still held his sword. He didnt\nblame anyone for not objecting. &quot;Fine then Grimlock, you will go too, I\nsuppose they might need your muscle,&quot; He said. All Grimlock could do was\nlooked pissed, &quot;Slggin right&quot; is all he said, as he walked past Swoop,\nand towards Pacifix. He looked down at his future comander, and spat a\nglob of oil beside him, then stormed out.\n\n"}}
