I guess Scrap happens at times. \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; She decided to kill time by using the scrap wires and metal outside \n&gt; the ship.  She managed to create a make-shift sensor beam.  It \nwould \n&gt; surround the ship, but at only 15 feet away.  It was a foot off the \n&gt; ground. And it gave a soft hum, but she could barely hear it.  With \na \n&gt; little luck, she had it run off solar power. The had to use one of \n&gt; her own small power cells to help store energy while the sun was \n&gt; down.  Her own power levels ran at 75% on a full charge now.  BUt \nshe \n&gt; wasn&#39;t worried. So far, she had no clue other bots existed. And if \nno \n&gt; other creatures were like the spindly legged thing she saw earlier, \n&gt; then she&#39;d be fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just on a sheer whim, she opened up her forarm scanners and \n&gt; radar. &quot;Hmm, wonder if I&#39;ll pick up anything other than atmospheric \n&gt; interferrence.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; The mayday could not be picked up do to the global communications \n&gt; jamm that was currently in effect. The Maximal sensors had picked \nup \n&gt; the ships decent, but noone had noticed since the Maximals were \n&gt; defending their base from Unicron&#39;s Minions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:OOC:  I thank you\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; StarFlier woke up to a dawn unlike she had ever seen.  The sky \nwas \n&gt; &gt; brilliant oranges and reds.  She got up, tansformed into bot mode \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; set about making her ship a little more livable.  She found her \n&gt; small \n&gt; &gt; tool kit and started working on fixing the emergency power cells, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; they were too far damaged.  She did find her distress beacon.  \nShe \n&gt; &gt; pressed it and hoped someday, someone might find her. It gave out \na \n&gt; &gt; general MAYDAY. But no allience signals. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She cleaned up most of the rubble and made a pile of scrap \noutside \n&gt; &gt; the ship.  Next, she went to the console.  Th best she could \nmanage \n&gt; &gt; was fixing her chair.  She sat in it and propped her feet up. She \n&gt; put \n&gt; &gt; her hands behind her head and leaned back.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t be so bad here. A few curtains, a little paint, \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; might be down right cozy.&quot;  with sarcasm dripping off her tongue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
