Shadowcaster had known that some\n&gt; parts of coming back from the Matrix would be\n&gt; emtional, but he hadn&#39;t counted on how special it\n&gt; would feel to be with his son Rattrap again. It had\n&gt; been a hard road for them when he&#39;d revealed himself\n&gt; to during the Beast Wars, with Rattrap initially\n&gt; blaming him for abaondoning him to grow up on the\n&gt; streets after several failed Cybertronian\n&gt; Orphanages,\n&gt; but the two had made their peace after Shadowcaster\n&gt; had had his epiphany with the Matrix. They had just\n&gt; really developed a strong father son bond when the\n&gt; Nemesis attacked and Shadowcaster was forced to make\n&gt; the ultimate sacrifice for everyone, including his\n&gt; son. He could still remember his last words spoken\n&gt; before he rammed into it on a direct line to Rattrap\n&gt; &quot;Forgive me&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadowcaster quietly approached Rattrap from behind,\n&gt; gently laid a hand on him and decloaked. &quot;I&#39;m right\n&gt; behind you son.&quot; he answered beamingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@...&gt; wrote: &gt;\n&gt; Rattrap &quot; Cheetor great to see you again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Rhinox &quot; Cheetor when the hell did you get here&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ba &quot; Hey KittyCat&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Optimus &quot; hey cheetor have you seen any sign of\n&gt; &gt; Silverbolt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Rattrap &quot; Hey cheetor do you know where\n&gt; ShadowCaster\n&gt; &gt; went?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OMWOS &lt;o_mighty_wife_of_shinigami@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Well then... since Tankor missed my post\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; Cheetor trying to \n&gt; &gt; talk to the other Maximals, I&#39;ll do a repost, but\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; may not work since \n&gt; &gt; I have no idea where everyones at now.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheetor&#39;s famous grin returned, &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; all the fun now.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; He was excited, to see an old face back from the\n&gt; &gt; Matrix.

That was it, he had gone insane, he\n&gt; &gt; was imaging things, \n&gt; &gt; hearing his own crews voices.
