She not only hated heights but she \nwas ready \n&gt; to bound away from Menasor before he would have crushed her and now \nher \n&gt; muscles ached a little from not leaping like they thought they were \nsupposed \n&gt; to.\n&gt; Looking up at Prowl she hissed at him, then heaving a sigh and \nlooking down, \n&gt; seeing the land fly away from under her feet...way...way down below \nher.\n&gt; The battle was going pretty well now, the alliance, or most of it, \nhad gone \n&gt; and now there was only half that many bots to deal with.\n&gt; She sighed again and kicked a little, not liking it when her feet \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be touching something. But she had to admit, it was a neat side \neffect that \n&gt; when she transformed into her SBM that Prowl did too.\n&gt; It made her feel not so alone. Being the only alien on the planet \nbefore and \n&gt; all.\n&gt; But in this case, Prowl was acking in instinkt and not his brain \nand she \n&gt; might have to teach him how to master this mode, just like he would \nhave to \n&gt; teach her how to fly in robot mode.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
