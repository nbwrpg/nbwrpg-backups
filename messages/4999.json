She never ran from a fight before. And now she felt \nlike she had dishonored herself. She turned and let go of the branch she was \nhanging onto and flew off leaving Cybershark near the tree.  She didn&#39;t want \nanyone to know that she was alive.  Not that she feared for her life.  It \nwas that she felt like her life wasn&#39;t worh scrap.  She just wanted to try \nto forget what happened.  If the others in HellBeast&#39;s base were dead, then \nshe survived.  But if they were alive, she was a coward.  She knew that she \ncould never go back there ever again or she would be killed for sure.  She \nflew u[ into the air currents, letting the breeze carry her to any which way \nthe wind went.  She looked up and thought she saw a hugh red bird like \ncreature.  She shook her head.\n&quot;Nah, my mental circuits are playing tricks on me.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
