Zardus&#39;s hands fly over the keyboard as he enters command \nafter command, reminding him of when he had first landed on earth \nunder the Predacon banner. He almost exclaims in triumph as the \nmonitoring systems in the room activate, clearly showing Unitron, \nFirestarter, Sixshot, Ares, Serpentor, Double Punch, Injector, \nManterror, and Bumblebee and playing back whatever they were saying. \nZardus doubted that the bots would notice that the monitoring systems \nwere back online, so he simply sat back, listening. No one was going \nto keep anything from him in his own base.\n\nZardus leans forward and taps a few keys. Every blast door in the \narea that the planners were in closes and locks, and the \nneutrodestructive gas releasers prepare to kill..\n\n(KSL, please post whatever Unitron and co are saying or tell me over \nIM).\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shokaract was still outside of the base, and he was watching \neveryone leave.\n&gt; He calls Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract: Hey, leader, where is everyone going? Should we be going \nwith\n&gt; them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kracken: Ask him what our mission is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract: Fine. What&#39;s everyone leaving to do, also?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kracken: Ask him who we&#39;re fighting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract doesn&#39;t ask.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kracken: Hmm. Sometimes, it can be quite difficult to make your \nleaders get\n&gt; annoyed...\n\n\n"}}
