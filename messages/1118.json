She knew he had his\n&gt; reasons, but whatever the reason it was not worth it. It was obvious he\nwas\n&gt; in pain, &#39;bots don&#39;t just cough up mech-fluid for the hell of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron took a deep breath and calmed herself. She wasn&#39;t angry, just\n&gt; concerned. She crouched beside Dinobot, though he had said he was alright\n&gt; she knew better. She&#39;d seen too many battles not to know when a &#39;bot was\nin\n&gt; pain:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We have to get you to an &#39;R chamber, now.&quot; Tavatron gave Dinobot a look\n&gt; that basically said &#39;if you say no I&#39;ll drag you there myself&#39;. She wasn&#39;t\n&gt; going to let him continue to battle in this state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron&#39;s head snapped up when she saw the weapon&#39;s fire coming toward\nthe\n&gt; ark:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh slag...&quot; Tavatron opened a channel to Iron Raptor:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Commander, we are under heavy fire. I repeat, we are under attack.&quot;\n&gt; Tavatron closed the channel and returned her attention to Dinobot. There\nwas\n&gt; no way they could get inside the ark without getting blown to pieces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron sighed inwardly, under normal circumstances she would leave\nDinobot\n&gt; where he was and attack the intruders, but she couldn&#39;t, something was\n&gt; stopping her. It was feeling, she just couldn&#39;t leave him, it wouldn&#39;t\nbe...\n&gt; honorable:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We have to get to shelter. The attackers are heavily armed. We would be\nat\n&gt; a serious disadvantage if we remained in the open.&quot;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Make music with anyone, anywhere, through FREE Internet\n&gt; recording studio software.
