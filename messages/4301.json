Injector came to the left of Black Arachnia, putting his arm around \nher waist.\n&quot;So, lovely and deadly, what are...orders?  Go back to base for some R &#39;n R?&quot;\n\nManterror laughed.  \n\nDouble Punch&#39;s head turned, being an expert assassin and being able to hear a \npin drop in a war with missiles.  Seeing Cyber Claw, he cursed.  The Maximals \nhad seen them.  The gig was up.  &quot;Maximal!  Don&#39;t let him get away!  Kill \nhim!&quot; he went invisible suddenly entering his cloak mode.  Raising a pincher, \nit opened, firing an energy-signature seeking missile off at Carnage.\n\nManterror stopped chuckling as he saw a missile from no where blast off.  \n&quot;Maximal!&quot; he yelled, raising the launchers embedded in his arm, getting \nready to fire a salvo of ion disks off at the intruder.\n\nInjector brought his hand going up, touching Black Arachnia&#39;s back, then her \nneck, then the back of her head, Injector patting it a few times, taking out \nhis stinger missile launcher from subspace and firing a poorly aimed rocket \noff that missed Cyber Claw and headed for the Ark.\n\n"}}
