Flies into a tree, flying through it and \nlanding against another one. He growls, using a branch for support as he gets \nto his feet, firing another missile at Predator.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm growls as Predator shoots at his friend. He fires at him with his arm \ncannon, his rifle firing at Choran.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker raises an arm to block the knife, clenching his teeth as the knife \nstabs into it. One of the plasma charges hit him in the chest, sending him \nstumbling backwards, the other two missing him by an inch. He continues to \nfire with his shoulder blasters, firing again with his rifle.\n\n"}}
