But also I wanted to spend domw time with\nyou, alone and without hesitation. I just wanted some fun times.&quot; she\nsaid with an almost sappy look on her face.  She realized she was\nletting her emotional programming the better of her judgement and\ntried to save herself....too late. She leaned in and kissed his cheek.  \nShe felt her face plates flush and pushed herself free. &quot;Uh, sorry, I,\nah, erhm, sort of, just, you know, got caught up.&quot;  She felt rather\nstupid for a second and stood there wondering if now would be a good\ntime to just run for it.  She wanted him more than any bot should want\nanother. But she had a contender. Another bot was there to fight for\nhis affections. THough she tried to reconsile in herself that she must\njust trust to duty and not let things get in her way, she still wanted\nhim.  She stood there letting her spark pound in her chest compartment. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; He tried to keep up with her movements, but in beast mode, it was\nnot too easy.

Oh yes, let&#39;s have some fun.&quot;  \n&gt; She started running circles around him and nipping, lovingly, at his\n&gt; heels. \n&gt; \n&gt; She wanted him. However, he seemed somehow, well, rather reserved\n&gt; about himself in someways. She kept her doubts to herself and kept\n&gt; just having fun with him. She did a few back flips and kept running\n&gt; circles around him. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?  You boasted such power, such skill! \nWhere is your power and skill now?
