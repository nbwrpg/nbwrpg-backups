The ship was a Predacon \ntransport/fighter ship. It had been sent on a mission to destroy any \nMaximal pods orbiting earth, but the idiot pilot had crashed it into \nan astroid due to its limited scanning abilities.\n\n&quot;That,&quot; Zardus says, aiming his wrist at the vines and firing his \ndraining missiles. The missiles release their draining field, big \nenough to reach whatever was within the vines. &quot;Is Mosquitor,&quot; Zardus \nfinishes, the vines stopping to move and the buzzing ceasing. He \nwalks forward, taking out his sword and beginning to cut the vines \naway.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s harmless,&quot; he says to Wheeljack and Hurricane.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; Wheeljack: What is this?\n&gt; ::He takes out his gun.
