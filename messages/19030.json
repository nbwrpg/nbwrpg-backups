Lunarpine&#39;s punch severs one of the connections to Slayer&#39;s\n&gt; jetpack, the device losing power. Not enough strength to keep two\n&gt; bots\n&gt; in the air, the jetpack burns at its maximum, but the two bots begin\n&gt; decending.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer takes hold of Lunarpine&#39;s arm, attempting to dislodge the bot.\n&gt; Somehow, this Maximal seemed familiar to him, like he had met him\n&gt; before, perhaps in a past life.
