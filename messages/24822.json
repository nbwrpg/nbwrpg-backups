As soon as I hit the lave I fell into stasis\nlock&quot; Scorponok finishes triumphly, then as if he realizes something starts\nto get excited again &quot; What was it you said about Megatron a traitor,\nMegatrons noble, he would not betray&quot; Scorponok starts to ramble off\nincohirently to himself as he starts to walk around looking at the wreckage.\n\n\n&gt;Sharpclaws/depfear/Charon/Underground/Aelo/Celeno/Ocipite::\n&gt;\n&gt;Hecate divided and Aelo, Celeno and Ocipite appeared again.\n&gt;Perceptor&#39;s squad was ready to fight just incase.
