To get the &#39;plans of the ship&#39;,\n&gt; you&#39;d either have to do what BrightBlade is doing, or what Feline and\n&gt; Skulletron are going to do. Phobia might have some of the ship scanned\nfrom\n&gt; his visit, but the jammers would most-likely have prevented him from\ngetting\n&gt; more than half.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt;\n&gt; Striker raises an eyebrow.
