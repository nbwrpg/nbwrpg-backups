Just daring her to try something while he held his gun in his hands. The snarl in his voice caused her to tense even further with aggression, her shoulders slightly rising with the increasing anger.\nBlue optics never left the moving Oblitercon as he approached the electrified bars with his gun aimed, watching every movement, every breath, even watching the pulse of his veins.\nIron Raptor�s breath began to become a little more heavier and she heard her spark in her hearing mechanisms, the instincts of both beast modes beginning to rise to the surface and show their own power.\nShe had never let her beast modes go before, never let them take control and dominate her robotic half�and she was trying not to let them take control now. But it was SO difficult! The rise of the instincts, the rush of the fluids, both just urging her to let them loose and express their extreme and total power. \nIt was so strange; standing there and almost hearing nothing other then one�s own breath and the pound of one�s spark in their chest.\nTry as she would she could not get the rise of adrenaline down, couldn�t calm her breathing, couldn�t slow her spark�couldn�t control her beast modes!\nWith an action quicker then one could blink the transformation was complete, from bot to beast in record time! The logical robotic half lost in the rage and fierceness of both beast modes! But also in the anger of them both�they merged! A feat in which was brought on by the anger, by the hate, by the combined thought of blood shed.\nWhere an armored fembot once was stood a beast of both worlds, of reality and nightmare�combined!\nBlack as night, eyes of coldest ice, height of 8 feet, claws of sliver, teeth of 3 � inches, inner toe claws of 8 � inches, vertebral spikes of 7 inches and three and a half tons of rage and killing power that could throw twenty tons into a single strike. (8-foot back raptor with silver claws, spikes along backbone, simple enough.)\nThere was no warning what so ever as three tons of claws and teeth hit the electrified bar head on, held back only centimeters away from Hiss�s nose.\nSparks flew outward on impact, spraying towards Hiss and the Oblitercons.\nGuns of no guns, she was getting through!!!\nA roar in which sounded out of this world echoed through the room as powerful jaws hit electrified bars, the bars groaning and screeching as they began to give way. All in one movement, the jaws in a straight course for Hiss!\nThere was no logic of robotic thinking, only the strongest urge to rip through robotic flesh!\nSparks showering, metal screeching, �the bars gave way to the awesome power of pure rage!\nHead and shoulders emerged through the bars, all in one swift movement the jaws began to close just around the perimeter of Hiss�s face!\nAll happening just as Breakdown finished his sentence!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
