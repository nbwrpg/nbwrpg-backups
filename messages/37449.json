He wants to talk to\n&gt; Ironhide before the leave.\n&gt;\n&gt; Crossroads get settled in, and awaits the launch.\n&gt;\n&gt; Afterburner races onto the ship, anxious to go, and he sits down\n&gt; quickly. He is swiftly followed by the down-to-business Scattershot\n&gt; who takes a seat beside the impatient Technobot. Nosecone\n&gt; wonders onto the ship, taking in all of the technology on board the\n&gt; stealth prototype Autobot cruiser deemed &quot;Hidden One&quot; by Pacifix\n&gt; due to its cloaking and stealth abilities.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 13 Jun 2001, at 22:20, Yanshosh@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Dios::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The drunk shruggs his large shoulders when the other two turn to him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nothing left here on Cybertron but bad drinks and worse memories.
