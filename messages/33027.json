He was back in the\n&gt; Sulaco, it looked the \n&gt; same as when he left it. Only dustier. Magmatron\n&gt; also had a new body. \n&gt; The great head of the black TM2 allosaurus poked\n&gt; it&#39;s way through the \n&gt; portal. Then the rest stepped through. He\n&gt; transformed to his new \n&gt; robot mode, he looked somewhat like a cross between\n&gt; TM2 Megatron (the \n&gt; allosaur tail on the back of the head) and Tigerhawk\n&gt; (allosaur head \n&gt; on his shoulder)\n&gt;      &quot;SLAG!!&quot; He roared. He typed in a few button\n&gt; and the autoguns \n&gt; came online, breaking away all the rock that had\n&gt; once surrounded the \n&gt; Sulaco. The rock flew from the ship with a huge\n&gt; force. &quot;Apocalypse, \n&gt; get to the Sulaco, now. I have war to discuss with\n&gt; you.&quot;\n&gt;      Magmatron paid no heed as Cerberus crawled\n&gt; behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cerberus:\n&gt; \n&gt;      In his new Techno-organic body he was capable\n&gt; of cloaking, a \n&gt; technology he had copied from Dachande. He crept\n&gt; quickly by \n&gt; Magmatron, the &quot;leader&quot; not even knowing. He got out\n&gt; of the base and \n&gt; headed towards a cave, decloaking as he did.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dachande:\n&gt; \n&gt;      A transdimensional rift opened and Dachande was\n&gt; thrown out of \n&gt; it. He slammed into the ground hard. He had gotten\n&gt; rid of his cursed \n&gt; beast mode, and the only true way for Magmatron to\n&gt; command him. Now \n&gt; all Dachande wanted to do was find Battera and\n&gt; eliminate Magmatron \n&gt; once and for all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
