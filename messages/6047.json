She hoped that he would consider an \nalliance with her group.  She was hopeful for the first time that \nmaybe, her group had a chance to win the war.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nKitKat::\nShe gave a low growl at the two bots.  Thay had mouths the size of \nCybertron, but didn&#39;t act like they had a lot of brains.  They kept \nsaying that they were assassins.  She wasn&#39;t impressed.  She walked \noutside and in wolf mode and went on a perimeter patrol.  She \nwondered if Megatron would ever return to the base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBattera::\n\nAt the beach with Cybershark, she was enjoying the ocean.  She flew \ninches over the waves while Cybershark was swimming.  She loved the \ncool water slpaching over her face and wings.  It felt wonderful.  \nShe was glad to see CyberShark cheered up and happy again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nShadow Wing::\n\nShe was walking in the direction of the new maximal base.  She would \nbe able to fly soon.  But that didn&#39;t make her feel any better.  She \nstill didn&#39;t want to go back and deal with her failure as a fighter, \nas a member of the team, as a bot.  She let down the team when she \nwas away.  The Ark was destroyed while she was gone and she felt \nguilty about that.  She knew that she should have been there to help.\nShe felt guilty about not being able to prove that she could fight.  \nShe could survive. But she knew that she would eventually need help.  \nShe had to admit to herself that even though she really liked \nLunarpine, it would never work. He was a survivalist.  he was a \nfighter.  She felt like she had to be babysat.  She knew that a wolf \nand an owl would never make it together.  That fact tore her spark in \ntwo.  She walked through the snow and lightening headed for the \nbase.  Even thought she wished that the pred hunting her had slagged \nher off.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSavanna::\nShe was enjoying the African sun.  She was teaching the cubs how to \npounce on prey and how to hunt. Even thought the prey for the cubs \nwas a small mouse she had killed and was tossing it around for them.  \nShe was loving her life on the planet. \nThat night she had a dream.  A dream of her old ship.  Her old \ncommander and fellow bots.  She dreammed of the worm hole that \nswallowed the ship and tore it apart.  She dreammed of her landing \nand trasformation into a lioness.  She awoke in a cold sweat. \nShe remembered what had happened to her.  She remembered why she was \nhere.  She sat up and looked at her pride.  She didn&#39;t want to leave \nher new family and friends.  But she knew what she had to do.\nShe transformed into her bot mode and walked away.  it killed her \ninside to have to do this.  But she had hope that one day, she would \nreturn to her pridelands.  She opened her scanner and looked for \nMaximal signals to home in on.\n\n\n"}}
