They both ran \nlike Hell for the other Dieties who had gathered.  Upon reaching them:\n\n&quot;We&#39;re ready!  LET&#39;S KICK MAXI TAILGATE!&quot;\n\n---\n\nNemesis saw Dinobot&#39;s optics charge, firing his own shot of optic lasers to \nintercept the blast.  Jumping up quickly, he transformed to his beast mode, \nactivating the boosters in his feet, he blasted off into the air.\n\n---\n\nShockwave saw the massive form of Iron Raptor.  &quot;Illogical beast modes.&quot;\nBringing up his targeting scanners from 120 ft in the air, he got a lock.  \nFiring four missiles and a burst of twenty rapid lasers down at Iron Raptor&#39;s \nmidsection.\n\n---\n\nScavenger saw Dinobot begin to turn towards him with a weapon.  &quot;Slag!&quot; he \nyelled, going into a quick reverse, explosions in front of him sent him into \na flip, landing on his tires with a crunch.  \n\n---\n\nSerpentor and Koga Shuko heard Cyber Claw screamed.  The kick sent Shuko \nslamming into the tree.\n\n--\n\nSerpentor laughed.  &quot;Stupid.&quot; was the one word he said before throwing his \nenergon sword blade first at Cyber Claw&#39;s chest, rolling to the left and \nstanding, his plasma rifle raised.  &quot;Megatron?&quot;\n\nKoga laughed.  &quot;Oh, yeah, he&#39;ll answer your questions.  Evidently you didn&#39;t \nknow him.  He&#39;s been dead for months, and only now reincarnated by my \nbrilliant technology.  And the same will happen to you, without the cloning!&quot; \nhe yelled, taking out his sword and getting in a fighting stance.\n\n======\n\nBumblebee swerved to the left, catching a few shots in his side.  Raising \nboth launchers, he fired a total of four stinger missiles off at Ursa Major, \nan optic blast off at Dark Mouse as he saw her bite Transantulas.\n\n"}}
