I believe Nightlight went after him.  They both ended up in a losing battle against Hydras and several of his friends, however they were all suddenly attacked by Trelos, some crazed bot that another faction had tried to reprogram. \n  \n Trelos and Hydras faced off and Nightlight and Rodimus used this chance escape (I think nightlight was entering stasis lock at that point).\n They were picked up and brought back to the Pasificus maximal base.\n  \n Rodimus and his family have been living there since.  Rodimus helped the Pasificus maximals again when Trelos attacked.  (I say helped because I didn&#39;t want to claim he was a member of the group without your permission; he hasn&#39;t really joined them, but Lord Perseus regards him as an equal).  Trelos tried to get into the base, but failed, went over and massacred about 30 police in Atlantis before being captured by Rodimus and Ravenchief, both were pretty badly damaged from the encounter. \n  \n Finally, Rodimus has been speaking with Doc (who quite possibly came from the future).  Doc is astounded to be speaking to a legend such as Rodimus Prime.  So the past month and a half, rodimus and doc have been talking. \n  \n Now there&#39;s an alert in the city because of the intruder.  Perseus has asked if Rodimus wants to help out on this mission, but since he already assisted in the last one, Perseus doesn&#39;t want to insist that Rodimus join. \n  \n Wew, that&#39;s what you missed for Rodimus.  He&#39;s currently in the medical bay, I planned to bring him up the the briefing but hadn&#39;t decided whether he&#39;d join the party into the city or stay and defend the base.
