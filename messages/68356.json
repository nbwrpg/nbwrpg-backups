He took a moment to look around as he carefully stepped onto\nthe the cooling surface, steam rising from the contact. With the\nslightest application of power, bosters flared and he rose above the\nmuck. \n\nHe watched as Trelos ran at the new robot and watched the result, a\nslight smile flitting across his face. With a flick of thought he began\ntransmitting what he saw to the command center, as he began to approach\nMalice. (OOC: Yes, Hydras should be able to see what&#39;s going on)\n\n&quot;Who are you to invade our space with threats of death?&quot; His voice is\ndeep, a cross between a purr and a growl.

Malice retreated to stable\n&gt; ground and hid behind a rock outcropping.  After the fortress settled\n&gt; and a sentry exited to search- for himself he assumed, he decided to\n&gt; get the creature&#39;s attention.  He leveled his rifle and fired a\n&gt; careful shot in the beast&#39;s path only fet in front of him, then a\n&gt; follow up shot behind it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s far enough, Predacon.
