He was back in the Sulaco, it looked the \nsame as when he left it. Only dustier. Magmatron also had a new body. \nThe great head of the black TM2 allosaurus poked it&#39;s way through the \nportal. Then the rest stepped through. He transformed to his new \nrobot mode, he looked somewhat like a cross between TM2 Megatron (the \nallosaur tail on the back of the head) and Tigerhawk (allosaur head \non his shoulder)\n     &quot;SLAG!!&quot; He roared. He typed in a few button and the autoguns \ncame online, breaking away all the rock that had once surrounded the \nSulaco. The rock flew from the ship with a huge force. &quot;Apocalypse, \nget to the Sulaco, now. I have war to discuss with you.&quot;\n     Magmatron paid no heed as Cerberus crawled behind him.\n\nCerberus:\n\n     In his new Techno-organic body he was capable of cloaking, a \ntechnology he had copied from Dachande. He crept quickly by \nMagmatron, the &quot;leader&quot; not even knowing. He got out of the base and \nheaded towards a cave, decloaking as he did.\n\n\nDachande:\n\n     A transdimensional rift opened and Dachande was thrown out of \nit. He slammed into the ground hard. He had gotten rid of his cursed \nbeast mode, and the only true way for Magmatron to command him. Now \nall Dachande wanted to do was find Battera and eliminate Magmatron \nonce and for all.\n\n\n"}}
