It wasn&#39;t til after Primal and Megatron merged with their\ncounter parts sparks did they grow to G1 size. Is it normal for them to be\nthat size? NO IT&#39;S NOT. The biggest BW/BM transformer possible under normal\ncircumstances is under bumble bee size. Even in their original transmetal\nbodies megatron/primal weren&#39;t even the size of optimus primes head and they\nwere two of the bigger (rinox/Rampage being the largest, but again proto\nform X was hardly normal system specs) bots on the show. Rat Trap is like a\nflea to an original transformer in size terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Legendarynemasis@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 06, 2002 9:21 PM\nSubject: Re: G1\n\n\n&gt; Cybertrons Moons were Cybernetic... not rock. And as for the TFs being a\n&gt; fraction of a G1 transformers size that is fault. On Average TF\nTransformers\n&gt; ranged anywhere from 8 feet to 40- 60 feet tall normaly, with some\n&gt; exceptions. The size range of BW transformers ranged from 4 feet- Original\n&gt; Rattrap to about 20 feet, Optimus Primal(ultra version) and Megatron(ultra\n&gt; T-Rex and TM2 Dragon.) Optimal Optimus was the size of a G1 bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
