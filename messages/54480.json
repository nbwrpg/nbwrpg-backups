Such a choice should not be \nso \n&gt; difficult. Or.. have these Autobot lackies softened you up?&quot; She \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; entiredly thrilled with the idea of Hydras terminated.

The Megatron side of Hydras is \nnothing more than a Predacon wannabe who named himself after someone \nfamous - and Galvatron is Galvatron, ruthless, uncaring, insane \ntyrant.  If he even remembers his time as the original Megatron, he \npays it no heed.&quot;  Empath clenches her fists, and Vok energy crackles \naround them.  &quot;He is going to pay through the nose for throwing away \nall those Decepticon lives just to save his own worthless hide.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
