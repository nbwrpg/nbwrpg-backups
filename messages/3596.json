He was a tattered mess. He tried \nto move, still fearing more shots, but there was not enough strength to pick \nhimself up. A shot had hit him at the back of his neck, nearly paralyzing \nhim and resitricting him from screaming.\n\nHe went still, his eyes wild from the pain. He was still conscious. All that \nwas behind his eyes, was the face of the poor mouse. The side of his chest \nwas torn open, exposing circitry and mechanical works inside. He struggled \nto breath, then after he went into stasis lock.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
