Of course, she couldn&#39;t expect him \nto know everything, but she did expect something else.\n\nKatya: Drawing first blood? Of course, it is an approach that \nminimizes losses, but where is the fun in that? We might as well start \nusing dishonorable artillery right away.\n\nShe enters the base before going on.\n\nKatya: The bidding ritual is done in two parts. Before a battle, we \nissue a batchall -a battle challenge- and ask what forces the defender \nwill use. After that, two commanders bid against each other to bring \nto least troops possible to achieve victory.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Owlhawk:  Each side agrees to send in a pre set either\n&gt; number or percent of warriors and they hold a battle\n&gt; to the first damage rather than death to determine who\n&gt; goes and who stays.\n&gt; \n&gt; He hoped his complete guess lucked out.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Katya was pleased.

Let us continue then. The Clans have\n&gt; &gt; developped another \n&gt; &gt; system that minimizes losses and promotes honor. It\n&gt; &gt; is our bidding \n&gt; &gt; ritual.
