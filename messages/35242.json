Pacifix walked outside, and stretched \n&gt; knowing that this would be his last day on the planet he had called \n&gt; home for so many years. &quot;Ok.&quot; He opened an encrypted commlink \n&gt; to all Autobots who were going on the mission. (Crossroads, JetV, \n&gt; Artemis, Gold bug, Jazz, Metalwarhawk, Technobots, Hoist -- the \n&gt; &#39;old friend&#39; that Ironhide sent, Trailblazer, Grimlock, Swoop, Slag, \n&gt; Snarl, Sludge, and any other Autobots that I haven&#39;t mentioned) \n&gt; &quot;All Autobots that are going to participate in this cruitial mission of \n&gt; secrecy, please report to the hidden Autobots shuttle, and wait \n&gt; there for me to arrive. Pacifix out.&quot; Pacifix transforms into APC \n&gt; mode and heads out towards his quarters to collect his stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swoop transforms into pterodactyl mode, and flies out towards the \n&gt; launch site. \n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads gets the message while he was approaching the \n&gt; launch site for the ship. He aririve at the entrance, and hops into it, \n&gt; appearing at the bottom. He walks around the ship, finds a crate to \n&gt; site on, moves it to the large open area which Pacifix would \n&gt; probably use for his farwell speech. He sits down on the crate \n&gt; waiting for Pacifix.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 18 May 2001, at 8:08, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ironhide frowned at how this had degenerated.
