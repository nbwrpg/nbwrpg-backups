His own private workshop. =\r\n Before becomming a Prime, he had \n&gt; taken great pleasure in restorring old=\r\n weapons and those in desperate need \n&gt; of repair.  And in some cases, he w=\r\nould also help to repair damages to other \n&gt; comrades.  He opens the door w=\r\nith a code.  Straight Shot peeks in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wow, it&#39;s just as you left it Tu=\r\ncson.  Everything is still there.

And to properly conduct repairs on \n&gt; comrades, I=\r\n&#39;d rather be where they can be monitored safely.  I need some \n&gt; tools, and=\r\n materials. I can get them here, and bring them to the medical \n&gt; bay.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me.=\r\n  It&#39;s about time I actually \n&gt; put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired=\r\n from Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yo=\r\nu really should have an assistant.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.

He was\n&gt; &gt; not a=\r\nble to show her that due to being under such duress, but now, there \n&gt; &gt; wa=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; time to express his feelings for her. He was a bot true to his word. =\r\nHis\n&gt; &gt; love was real, and it would remain as such.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Sh=\r\not knew him well.
