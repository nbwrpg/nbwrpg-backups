He drove a\npowerful piston like fist into the crumbled ice, scattering the large\npeaces of it, and kept trudging forward with his strenght, that could rend\nother robots armor. He pushed on ignoring the continous depletion for\nenergon. He must find this source of energon, that was still burning, could\nit be a generator? Did it once power a ship? But he was having problems\nthinking due to his loss of energon. He probably wasnt able to transform.\n\n\n\n"}}
