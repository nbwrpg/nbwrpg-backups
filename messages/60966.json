He fell asleep soon \nafter.\n\nIn his dreams, he met three bots.  The first was a big and tall one, \nhe had red eyes and a sinister laugh.  He laughed at Malice, until \nMalice curled up to cover his audios.\n\nThe second was a femme, tall and slender.  She too laughed at him, \nand pointed and laughed.\n\nThe third and final was also a femme.  But she was differant.  She \nwas a little shorter than the previous, and kind.  She kneeled down \nand tried to reach out to him.  He at first, moved away, but then, \nreached for her.\n\nMalice awoke several hours later, sitting up.  He was breathing hard, \nand it triggered a signal in Hellplague.\n\nHellplague opened a channel to Malice, who ignored it for a moment.\n&quot;Yes, Master?&quot;\n&quot;Are you alright?  My sensors in your body detected an emotional \noverload.  Ae you okay?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, I am fine.&quot;\nHellplague closed the channel, and laid back down.  She wondered if \nshe should tell Blacknightmare.\n&quot;Blacknightmare,&quot; she said softly into her comm,&quot;Malice isn&#39;t feeling \ngood.  He had a dream or something, it really bothered him.  I worry, \nif it will afect his performance somehow.  Should we go and check on \nhim?&quot; \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Anything else&quot;sais teh femme&quot;Rest well&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Malice rolled off his bed and walked to the door.
