However after a moment he could make out what appeared to\nbe a tree had fallen judging by the damage to some of the brush around\nit.\n\nAs WHEELIE maneuvered closer he could see it was spanning a small but\nvery deep gorge, the sound of water could vaguely be heard rushing\nthrough it somewhere below. Around and over the gorge there were the\nshapes of large avian creatures flying around the fallen tree.\n\nSWOOP, TERRANOTRON and LAZORBEAK.\n\n(OOC: Basically all redecos of each other and Terrorsaur and all of\nthe DINOBOTS!)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
