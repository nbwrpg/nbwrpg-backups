Dinobot wasn&#39;t using his \nenergy weapons during coming of the fuzors instead he was using a hand \nblaster and a shotgun laser blaster type thing. Because of this he ran out of \nammo. Also the weapons couldnt be solar charged because then they would have \nto be outraegeously used to charge and power the weapon. And if there were \nsolar cells then there would have been power to power the weapons at night \nsince what kind of idiot wouldn&#39;t have solar batteries that took in some of \nthe energy to operate the weapon at night. This still doesn&#39;t explain why \nthey faught at night either. Face it they needed ammo and they did run out of \nit at times and in G1 they also ran out. Don&#39;t deny simple facts such as \nthese because you feel you can&#39;t RP without firing 40 shots in one post at an \nenemy.\n\n"}}
