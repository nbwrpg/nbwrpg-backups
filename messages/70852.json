But Hydras mut pay what \n&gt; they\n&gt; have done... Mostly what he have done to Nightlight... For all the \n&gt; sufering\n&gt; that he had done and for all the sufering that he forced us to do... Kup\n&gt; told me about Perceptor&#39;s situation, He surely knows every corner of that\n&gt; dammed place and if he is willing to help as he claims so he will tell us\n&gt; all &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup smiled when he heard that he and Straightshot will work to gether and\n&gt; took the Arrow holster, Talon looked toTucson and smiled.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked over at Windlord, a look of shared pain in his face.\n&quot;There are several of us that he felt the sting of Hydras&#39; power.&quot;\nRodimus said as he strightened. He looked around at the others, his\noptics flashing as he contained his own internal anger. &quot;Hydras has\nlong used this method of control to create his troops from the ashes\nof Maximal protoforms.&quot; His voice deep and controlled. &quot;He must be\nstopped.&quot;\n\nWalking more or less to the middle of the room he turned to face the\nothers, &quot;There is little doubt that Hydras has spent at least some of\nthis time shoring up his base against the same methods that we used to\nenter before.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;and Cyclonus is a force to be\nreckoned with as well.&quot;\n\nTurning his head to look at Tuscon Rodimus continued, &quot;Like you he has\nfelt the power of the Matrix and has been forever changed by it, but\nin his case it has been corrupted, a dark twisted version of it.&quot;\nRodimus clenched his fist, &quot;But do not mistake it for a moment that\nhis wisdom and cunning are greater than they had been before - he\nknows much more than he reveals.&quot;\n\nCheetor crossed his arms over his chest, &quot;Power or no power, we will\nblast him back to Cybertron!&quot; he said, his voice exuding that\nexuberant confidence that was ever his trademark.\n\nRodimus smiled, &quot;Good, we will need that spirit soon.&quot; He turned to\nlook at the others, &quot;But first we need a concrete plan of action, to\nbe sure that we all act together.&quot; He looked around, &quot;Is anyone\nkeeping watch on Hydras&#39; base?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
