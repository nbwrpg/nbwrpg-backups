The\n&quot;structure&quot; of the camp location was up, and now Dracon was simply\nputting equipment into place.  He carries a couple of advanced radars\nand such and places them on a table.  When everything seemed ready to\nroll, he got back to his comrades.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Captain, I believe everything&#39;s just dandy over here, and we are\njust about ready to get to work and finally accomplish the operation\nthat will revolutionize our company,&quot; he says before asking, &quot;tell me\nCaptain, shall I operate from the camp while you do your thing?  I\nmean, I&#39;m much better on the sidelines than working with the\nheavy-duty stuff.&quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nic \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 23, 2003 9:21 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: StarDrill Inc.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: Get in orbit. As soon as Dracon&#39;s finished building the base\n&gt;   camp, we&#39;ll start the actual dig. Dracon, get moving! Find a nice\n&gt;   place with lots of mining space and start building! Tell us when\n&gt;   you&#39;re done so we can link an energy bridge between the station and\n&gt;   the camp.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The huge tank-bot was excited with the perspective of mining on Earth.\n&gt;   It was more than a dream, more like finally touching the stuff of\n&gt;   legends. Perhaps he would even dig the Ark up.
