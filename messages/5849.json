It has transwarp capabilities.&quot;\n&gt;     Magmatron took this news in stride, this could be very good for \nhim. &quot;If \n&gt; the Destrocons do not wish to join me then I will return to my \nplans. All \n&gt; door open. Close main doors and autoguns online&quot;\n&gt;     Everything happened as it should. Magmatron went back to his \ncommand \n&gt; room. He sat looking at the blip on the radar screen. &quot;Send a \nprobe.&quot; He \n&gt; commanded the ship. From the entrance the small probe went in \nsearch of the \n&gt; ship, as it came near the cameras turned on.\n&gt;     &quot;Well, what have we here? An attack would be pointless against \na ship \n&gt; that large, but if I can get inside....Maybe I&#39;ll equip Mantella \nand Shredder \n&gt; with cloaking devices, and let them have some extras, just in case. \nYes, that \n&gt; would work.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Somewhat on topic: Magmatron has a plan for the ship. Wondering \nwhat it is? \n&gt; Stay tuned, same bat time, same bat channel.\n\n\n"}}
