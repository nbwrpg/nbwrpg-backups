When they are \naway of the o=\r\nther bots he insolates the corritor and he blunty said &quot;Zarak is \nplanning =\r\nsometihing..&lt;WBR&gt;. Literaly I sense it, Hydras must be informed his \ndesire=\r\ns to get the Matrix, altough he mentions that was for us I think that the \n=\r\nright pronoun is he... He must be observed in a discrete way, i wont let hi=\r\nm go \nclose to the Ark, the slightes tampering in the wrong way and all is =\r\ndoomed, and \nwe dont know a lot about Scourge and Cyclonus; I&#39;ll insist Hyd=\r\nras, that let us \ngo me and Darkhawk but I need someone watching Zarak, but=\r\n that would be after we \nget all the info that we can from that Auto-fool &quot;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n************&lt;WBR&gt;**&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; DarkHawk took one of his guns and \naimed carfully, ready for all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: superc=\r\nyclonus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, February 22, \n2010 4:16 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n To: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Subject: Re: Recovering Rodimus/BlackFortre&lt;WBR&gt;ss&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;I remind you, Za=\r\nrak, that you and Jiaxus \nare our guest&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;in the BlackFortes=\r\ns&quot; said coldyPerceptor &quot;and not \nthe Master of the house, so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;remember where is your place; \nDarkhawk, take this...

There was a part of him that wanted to blast the little \nPredacon=\r\n for daring to tell him anything. But the ugly thing was that Zarak \nstill =\r\nneeded the extra forces that Hydras and his Predacons brought to the \ntable=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So rather than commanding his Scorponok unit \n=\r\nto open fire on the base he just nodded and said, &quot;I apologize, I have \nove=\r\nrstepped my place.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Cyclonus and Scour=\r\nge \ncontinued to face down Dark Rodimus, the air was tense as Dark Rodimus&#39;=\r\n optics \nstared into Cyclonus, niether of them ready to back down, both of =\r\nthem \nremembering the last battle they fought!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever it \nwas Perceptor that broke the deadlock as he continued giving ord=\r\ners . . . \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (PASTE)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; The rest, we \nhave to Keep an eye in maximal base things are becoming&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \ninteresting lately there, Rodimus... I need you for task&quot;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; The affect of the command was almost instant a=\r\ns Rodimus stepped back from \nCyclonus and Scourge and looked over at Percep=\r\ntor. &quot;What&#39;cha need Percy?&quot; \nRodimus said to Perceptor, happy for the momen=\r\nt that it was Perceptor and Hydras \ngiving orders and not Cyclonus and his =\r\nlap dog.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nCyclonus, seeing the break in the tens=\r\nion also stepped back, pulling Scourge \nback with him. &quot;There will be anoth=\r\ner time Scourge.&quot; he said quietly, &quot;No need \nto fight this out here.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there \nwill be.&quot; he said darkly=\r\n. His optics still watched Rodimus, his look almost \nhungry as he smiled ev=\r\nilly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As the tensions between \nCyclonus, Scourge=\r\n and Rodimus cooled Zarak turned to look at Tuscon, wondering \nwhat informa=\r\ntion this bot could hold. &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see \nwhat t=\r\nhis Auto . . . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *BEEP*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&=\r\ngt; Zarak was caught in mid sentence by his scanner going off, the hand hel=\r\nd \none that he had been keeping trained on Tuscon. He glanced down at it, a=\r\n curious \nlook on his face. For some reason it was registering a life sign =\r\nwhere there had \nbeen none before. It was located somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s h=\r\nead.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Zarak stepped forward to take a more caref=\r\nul scan . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nOOC: Yup, the same scanner \nhe had been scanning him with a few posts ago. =\r\nIt is still out and processing :) \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; \n(Cyclonus/Scourge/&lt;WBR&gt;Rodimus/Zarak)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0085_01CAB421.639EEA80--\r\n\n"}}
