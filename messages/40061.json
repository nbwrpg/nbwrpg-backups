That way I can \nexplain to you why you should be thinking before before making \nyourself look foolish. =) I wouldn&#39;t be still RPing if i didn&#39;t \nunderstand transwarp tech.

Cyberwolf has given me permission to take Megaton back\n&gt; in time(trans-warptechnology can do that duh it was the whole point of\n&gt; beast wars) so that he can attack Stallex when he was a baby and\n&gt; barely be saved by Mustex. That way in the future Mustex will have a\n&gt; rivalry with Megaton, Veratis his creator, and possibly all the\n&gt; mutants. This also explains why Mustex first downloaded his Datatracks\n&gt; into Stallex(for a second chance if something should happen to \nhim).\n\n"}}
