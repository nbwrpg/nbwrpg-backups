I am AzureBlade. I am a true and pure Maximal warrior. But you,\n&gt; Waterworm, do not quite seem to be a maximal. I would feel it elseway. If\n&gt; you are, though, I suggest that you let us in the base and introduce me\nand\n&gt; Hugar to the leader of the maximals on this planet.\n&gt; I would be grateful for that.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
