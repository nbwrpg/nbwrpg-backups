He started to \n&gt;make\n&gt;his was down to the cafeteria. On his way he noticed that doors were shut, \n&gt;he\n&gt;couldn&#39;t figure out why. Until he saw the computer in the cafeteria. It \n&gt;said\n&gt;that the Destrons have visitors and that Magmatron sealed all the doors\n&gt;leading to other parts of the ship so the visitors could only get to the\n&gt;Conference Room. Magmatron was still waiting for them.\n&gt;     He got in line to get some food. &quot;Hmmm....One energonburger and a\n&gt;McenergonFlurry (play on McFlurry)&quot; He told the computer. His order was\n&gt;served hot and fresh without bot whipping towels at each other.
