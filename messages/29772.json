Even though he didnt\nshow it, he truly did enjoy all of the Stunticons&#39; company, except for\nMotormaster, and he would make those Maximals pay for injuring his comerade\nin arms. Espeacially Prowl, he kept going over it in his head, the death of\nthe late Prowl, back on and Autobot shuttle, Scavanger had hit him well\nplace in the chest, and Prowl&#39;s smoking body hit the ground inactive. It\nwould happen to this Prowl to, Wildrider swore, clenching his fist, as he\nheaded to the storage room, for more metal for Beastbox.\n\n\n\n"}}
