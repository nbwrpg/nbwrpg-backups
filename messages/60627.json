Anyway, here it is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With my school year drawing to a close, I&#39;m considering coming \n&gt; &gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the summer. I have a suggestion though for a new faction \n&gt; &gt; (please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; note, this will for a while at least be a one man faction). I \n&gt; need \n&gt; &gt; &gt; council approval though, and to know how much they can do. Here \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All these being have some ability to predict the future, they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; increase this by stealing the &quot;hero/villan potential&quot; from \n&gt; various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; subjects who had the potential to be heros/villans (also \nkilling \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; subjects, but you have to immobilize them for a few minutes). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their leader is named Seer. He supposedly cannot die, but he \n&gt; never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; come to earth so he&#39;s a none factor. All his minions are \n&gt; required \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; give some of their stolen hero/villan potential to him, and he \n&gt; has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; incredible power, he also gives each of his servants a prophesy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; telling some detail of their deaths to help delay it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason they send their minions to earth (only one at a \ntime, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is why it&#39;s one man, they don&#39;t want to do to much \n&gt; damage), \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because over millions of years the change caused by someone \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even a small bit of hero/villan potential is incredible, so the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; potential they can steal is almost limitless. They give their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants a target before sending them back. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t thought out all the details, but the first minion \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; named Fortuneteller (a female), and her prophesy would be: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So long as you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will take \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; life (so long as you give Seer his fair share of the potential \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; steal no transmetal will kill you). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He also has a council of three other powerful members of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; faction, who will die, but share a prophecy of their death: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One will die by fire, one by ice, and the last must perish \n&gt; thrice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (essentially one will die, but his/her spark will return to \nSeer \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a new body, after which one will die by fire, then the first \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; die again, but the same thing will happen, then one will die by \n&gt; &gt; ice, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then the first will die and stay dead, but they don&#39;t know \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which and won&#39;t chance it putting themselves in danger). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I want to know how much prescience I&#39;m allowed? How can that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effect the game? And is it o.k. to dictate how my characters \ncan \n&gt; &gt; die \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (they can still have the crap beaten out of them, but they \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed any other way).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dewboy30816&quot; \n&gt; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to draw attention to the message board, and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; message \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I posted there at least a week ago.\n\n\n"}}
