She knew what he was thinking.  He was right, \nShe could sent out commander faster with thought. She nodded. &quot;I \nwon&#39;t say a word about who I am.&quot; she smiled. She was glad at the \nchance to see her old friends again. Even if she couldn&#39;t tell them \nwho she really was. She looked at Lunarpine and RazorClaw.  I&#39;ll do \nmy best.&quot; \n\nShe took the DNA collector and put it in her hip compartment.  She \ntransformed into polar bear mode and walked out of the room. She was \nstaring to get nervous. She had never been a leader. She didn&#39;t have \nwhat it took to be a leader. She was a recon bot. Not a leader of a \nteam. She sighted. Why couldn&#39;t Veratis have picked another bot who \nhad experience in this, like Lunarpine or RazorClaw, she thought.\n\nShe walked down the hall and stopped near the entrance. She wasn&#39;t \nreally ready for this. But she didn&#39;t want to tell the others that.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Foxfingers still has his comm programed for Maximal\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers listens curiously as the call to report to the CF comes \nthrough.\n&gt; &quot;Veratis, I know you&#39;re busy but I thought you might want to hear \nthis.&quot; He\n&gt; replays the message for the four bots in the classroom, &quot;Give you \nany\n&gt; ideas?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis stretches his back, slightly extending his bat wings. &quot;I \nthink we\n&gt; should be included in this meeting, it&#39;ll give us the chance to get \nmore\n&gt; aquainted with our new associates.&quot; He tries not to think to \nheavily on the\n&gt; subject knowing that strong emotions could be read by Ice. &quot;I think \nit&#39;s\n&gt; time to give you a field test.&quot; He looks over the three in the \nclassroom\n&gt; surveying his possabilities. &quot;Ice, I&#39;m putting you in charge, don&#39;t \ntell\n&gt; them who you were or where you came from, I still don&#39;t fully trust \nanyone\n&gt; with my technology.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stood up as if to voice his objections when Veratis cut \nhim off in\n&gt; mid thought, &quot;Ice can pick things up in thier minds before they can \nreact to\n&gt; it.&quot; Still seeing the need to justify his decision he continues &quot;Her\n&gt; telepathy can relay orders faster than either of you can call them \nout, and\n&gt; She will be able to cover your backs more efficiently than you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t have to say a word, he knew that Veratis didn&#39;t \nmean\n&gt; &quot;could&quot; The old science bot was right when he assumed that \nLunarpine might\n&gt; hesitate to cover Razor Claw. That one revelation put the choice \ninto a new\n&gt; light. The wolf knew that Veratis had made the only logical \ndecision.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw stood and faced the old bot, &quot;What is  my role in this \nmission?&quot;\n&gt; He had no knowlege of the Maximal units so he didn&#39;t know what he \ncould\n&gt; offer the team.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You have the strength they might need if they get into a messy \nsituation.&quot;\n&gt; He checked what limited information he had on the new member of the \nteam,\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m placing you as Ice&#39;s bodygaurd, your shield can protect her if \nthere&#39;s\n&gt; trouble.:&quot; He again checked his notes, &quot;You will all de given a  DNA\n&gt; recorder. Any bot you will come in contact with will be sent back \nto me.\n&gt; I&#39;ve set the devices on a changing frequency to make it harder to \ntrace.&quot; he\n&gt; looked to Ice again, &quot;Try to protect my prototype, I&#39;d like her \nreturned in\n&gt; one piece.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
