Looking back to \nsee what it was a book. He examined it and found it to have belonged \nto the Rocak, the ancestors of all robots,even more advanced than the \nVok. It would have been Elementary to them,but ti him it would be \nincredibly advanced. This book held the secret to polarizing energy\n(I&#39;ll explain when Mustex is face to face with Veratis).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt;  Mustex cautiously walked along &quot;Alliance Island&quot;. Suddenly he \n&gt; detected a Mutant Frequency. It Quickly ended. He checked his \n&gt; computer. It had only lasted 2.8 seconds. It was unlikely,but it \n&gt; could be explained by a jammer malfunction that had fixed itself. \nHe \n&gt; raced to the source.\n\n\n"}}
