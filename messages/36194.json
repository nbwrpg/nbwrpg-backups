Vlad exited behind her in beast-mode, hissing in frustration as his pet ran off across the grassy plains but he stopped and looked at just what it was she was heading towards. I gigantic CITY!  He had to blink numerous times just to assure himself that what he was seeing was true.  And it was. However, what his scanners homed in on was not what he had hoped to find. Dozens of Maximal signatures registered just inside of the city walls. And judging by the side and height of each transformer that was scanned, if he posed to be a threat and came too close�he was dead circuit boards!  And Shesta was heading right for the range if any weapons that city might hold!** � SHESTA!!� ** He bellowed, yet took off after her, hoping that the city defenses didn�t pick him off before he could reclaim his dog.**\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
