He was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bored. Whilehe thought of going out and go exploring around the\nPredacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; territory, he heard gun shots. He jerked his head up and stood up. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listened, then walked to the mouth of the cave. He saw Terrorsaur\nflying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; low, looking like he was ready to come back in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ah heard some shots!&quot; he said to him. &quot;Go find out what it was.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Terrorsaur grumbled to himself and flew out, turning his course. He\n&gt; &gt;picked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up two signatures on his scanners, one was Predacon.
