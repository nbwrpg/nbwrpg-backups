A plasma shotgun was also strapped to one of \nhis wings as in his hands an old sawed-off shotgun rested in his \nhands, which could have easily crushed it if he wanted to. Across his \nchest wasa bunch of ammo strips full of shells for the gun. He looked \nto the shop keeper and smirked as he cocked the shotgun before \nreaching behind his back and producing two more cred cards with a lot \nof cred on them.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;Will those six cards cover this all?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The shopkeeper nods and takes the cards eagerly, reaching down \nunder the \n&gt; table he was at, pressing a few buttons, the doors shutting and \nlocking, \n&gt; windows being blocked by sliding steel panels, a &quot;Closed&quot; sign \nreading on the \n&gt; front of the &quot;Cookie Store&quot;.  The walls swivelled and revealed new \nwalls \n&gt; lined with just about every weapon ever.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Pick your choice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Remember you can&#39;t have more than seven weapons)\n\n\n"}}
