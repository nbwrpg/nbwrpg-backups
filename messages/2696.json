She growled.*\n\n&quot; Either get rid of that walking glue stick or don&#39;t follow me, the smell&#39;s \ngetting to me.&quot;\n\n* She then began to take a small short cut towards the base, through a thick \nforest but the bushes were ideal for cover in case of an attack.\nIt was also the sort of thickness that the toller a bot was the less they \ncould get through it, so Gangon and herself could get through easily since \nthey were lower to the ground but a bot like Lightmare couldn&#39;t even hope to \nget through.\nBrightBlade then walked up a small hill covered with pine needles, the hill \ndeclined sharply so she then decided to jump down. She would have landed \nwith ease if there hadn&#39;t been for a small dip hidden and filled with \nneedles. Her foot sank into the hole and slightly twisted as her other foot \ncame down beside it but out of the hole.\nBrightBlade yipped in surprise and a bit of pain, she lifted her foot out of \nthe hole and looked it over. Twisted ankle.*\n\n&quot;Oh, great! Just what I needed!&quot;\n\n*She then growled but then kept on walking towards the base, a slightly \npained look on her face and limping heavily. But she didn&#39;t care, mainly for \nthe reason that no one else cared.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
