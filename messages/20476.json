She was covered \nin new fallen snow. She lifted her head up and loked around. She saw \nthat the landscape was totally white. She smiled and stood up. HEr \nshoulder was throbbing and still trickling blood. She looked down at \nwhere she was laying and saw a frozen puddle of red liquid in the \nsnow. She shook off the rest of the snow off her body and started \nwalking again. She headed north and just wakled along, in a calm \nmanner, seeing what there was to see. She left a small trickle of \nblood in the snow as she walked, but would soon be coverd by the \nfalling snow.\n\n\n"}}
