She hasn&#39;t tried to \nturn me over to Megatron when he was in her base. And Aracnia knows \nI&#39;m here, as well as Megatron. But I that Megatron, Aracnia and \nHellbeast are all too worried about getting the Allience, more than \nslagging us. If you want, we can stick together and watch out for \neach other. I don&#39;t trust Megatron any more than you do. He \nsacrificed us and didn&#39;t care. But KitKat is alright. Well, so far \nanyway. She really watches out for her group. It&#39;s wierd, but \nsometimes, she acts more like a maximal than a predacon.&quot;\n\nShe looked down for a moment, then back up at Quickstrike. &quot;Look, no \nmatter what happens, I&#39;m sticking with you. OK? Your the only one I \nreally trust. So let&#39;s just look out for each other. OK?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We can talk t&#39; Black Arachnia,&quot; he said to Dark Mouse. &quot;That&#39;s one \n&gt; thing. Ah don&#39;t trust Megatron anymore at all. KitKat---ah don&#39;t \n&gt; know, she might be loyal. Whaddya think? Ah all know is ah don&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; this. Not at all. It&#39;s makin&#39; mah nerves go again. Hell Beast an&#39; \n&gt; Megatron ain&#39;t uh good combination. Ah hate Hell Beast more than ah \n&gt; do Megatron. Hell Beast could kill ya fer lookin&#39; at &#39;im uh funny \n&gt; way. Ya can try an&#39; kick his kiester all ya want, but ah can&#39;t. \nHe&#39;ll \n&gt; do somethin&#39; personal if ah do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She stood up and looked at Quickstrike. &quot;Yeah, I know. It all \n&gt; smells \n&gt; &gt; fishy to me too. But what can we do? We can&#39;t run, we can&#39;t just \n&gt; &gt; leave them either. KitKat is a friend. She was  friend when I was \n&gt; &gt; with Megatron. She&#39;s the only one that hasn&#39;t betrayed me. And \nI&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; thinking right, she&#39;s still your friend to.&quot; she said, looking up \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike. She knew she was right. What bothered her was the \nfact \n&gt; &gt; that she still had feeling for Quickstrike. She also knew that he \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t give a care about her, much.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstrike leaned back. &quot;Ah don&#39;t need yer protection.&quot; He \n&gt; looked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back at Dark Mouse.
