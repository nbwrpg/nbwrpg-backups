A beam shoots towards Africa and scans a black \npanther. Inside the bot is given this beast mode and REFORMATED. He \nhas the same weapons as Optimus Prime in BM except he can only \npartially absorb the weapons fire. He opens a com link to his own \ntime.\n\nBot: This is Optimus Fury. I am proceeding toward the inferior \nAngilions. They will agree to be reformatted or they will join \nmillions of &quot;accidental&quot; deaths since the Maxis and Preds hunted down \nand destroyed Cheetor&#39;s team and killed most of there followers in \nattempts to deformat them. Because we are the Malacons. We live in \nsecret, and destroy those inferior to us.\n\nComm: Good. Don&#39;t return without a prize, reformatted or dead. Soon \nwith a little elbow grease (lol) we will be 2% of the population and \nthe Angelions will still be clueless about us.\n\nHe proceeds to &quot;destroy the evidense&quot; by aiming his shuttle at the \nAtlantic Ocean and parachuting out over England. When he lands he \ngoes to Beast Mode.\n\nOF: Stealth Mode.\n\nHolograms make him look like a real panther.\n\nOOC: I made sure he wasn&#39;t illegal, but you can&#39;t accept him without \nBM. Try to denig it now.\n\n\n"}}
