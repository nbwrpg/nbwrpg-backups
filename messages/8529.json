OR THE MAXIMAL DOG DIES!  YOU WILL \nHEAR OUR DEMANDS!&quot;\n\nHades and Anubis jumped back from laser fire yelling.\n\n&quot;HOLD YOUR FIRE!  HOLD YOUR FIRE!  WE HAVE A HOSTAGE!&quot;\n\nKoga Shuko looked around.  \n\n&quot;We will release this piece of slag as long as we have your words that we \nwill not be attacked or taken prisoner by any Maximals or any of the \nMaximal&#39;s allies, and will not attack for the next five days.&quot;\n\nRamhorn&#39;s optics slowly opened, seeing different sights.  Three Maximals he&#39;d \nnever seen before, and Ramulus.  He tried to move, but was too weak to break \nout of Shuko&#39;s grip.\n\n&quot;What the slag!?  WHAT?!  YOU IDIOTS LET ME BECOME A HOSTAGE!  By the \nPit...what a bunch of foul ups.&quot; he mumbled.  &quot;I bet they got to the bridge, \ntoo, didn&#39;t they!?&quot; Ramhorn sighed, waiting to see what the others did, but \nhe saw Maximals opening fire at them and called them all &#39;bad&#39; names almost \ninaudibly.\n\n"}}
