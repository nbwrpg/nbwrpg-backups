Being a Prime did not c=\r\nhange who he was heartfully.  He gives Lord Elder&#39;s question a moment and t=\r\nhen sits down to reply to him.\n\n&quot; I believe that if we try to attack the fo=\r\nrtress full frontal, that will surely give us away.  It&#39;s what Hydras would=\r\n normally suspect of us.  What he won&#39;t suspect, is what Night Shift hopes =\r\nto accomplish at the fortress by attempting to get a copy of the shell prog=\r\nram to us via remote transfer.  Once that&#39;s compelted, Night Shift will try=\r\n and make an excuse to leave the fortress to perform some recon duties for =\r\nHydras, and hopefully get Rodimus to join him.  I thought about this..  I k=\r\nnow we should try to rescue everyone all together but that would make it fa=\r\nr too obvius.  We&#39;ll have to do this carefully.  We first lure Rodimus to u=\r\ns, and once we do that, we&#39;ll need to get him quickly into stasis mode as s=\r\noon as we find a reversal for that shell program that Perceptor put on him.=\r\n  Like I said, this could take time, and if we must spend the time to do so=\r\nmething delicately, then so be it.  We want them to come to us, and not the=\r\n other way around.  We have a better chance at defeating them that way.&quot;\n\nH=\r\ne then gets up to watch the computer.\n\n&quot;After we rescue everyone, that is w=\r\nhen we can carefully plan our next move.  The next objective will be more d=\r\nifficult than the first.  But right now, what&#39;s most important to us, is to=\r\n take back what was stolen from us.  Our comrades.  After that, we can thin=\r\nk about subduing Hydras, Cyclonus and Scourge.  Things will fall into place=\r\n naturally.  Once the Decepticons who had been abandoned, realize that thei=\r\nr leaders cast them asside for greed and power, they may just revolt agains=\r\nt them.  This would further deduce the trio&#39;s hold over their faction.  Hop=\r\nefully what may happen, is that we may even aquire new comrades.  It&#39;s as P=\r\nrimus had said long ago... &quot;Till all are one.&quot;  \n\nHe had recalled the story=\r\n of how Unicron had been defeated the first time.  \n\n&quot; It happened long ago=\r\n, the first battle between Autobots, Decepticons and Unicron.  Unicron&#39;s gr=\r\need for power almost lead to the demise of both Autobot and Decepticon kind=\r\n, and it wasn&#39;t until both factions worked together as one, did Unicron get=\r\n defeated that first time.  That&#39;s what we need now.  We need to join our f=\r\norces and get everyone working together.  Autobot, Decepticon, Maximal and =\r\nPredicon.  I have a feeling that Hydras really does not care for the well b=\r\neing of his fellow predacons, and is only using them for his personal gain.=\r\n  Much like what Megatron and Galvatron did when they lead the Decepticons.=\r\n  If he had cared for his minions, Nightstrike would have been rescued days=\r\n ago.  I understand he is still in Maximal custody.  This further confirms =\r\nmy suspicions.  So here it is, where we are now.  We&#39;re pulled apart once a=\r\ngain, and in order to restore balance, we have to come together as one.  Ro=\r\ndimus was very good at keeping the peace, and hopefully by recovering him f=\r\nirst, I will have another Prime beside me to help fullfill that part of the=\r\n mission.  I understand that in order to light our darkest hour, I have to =\r\nprovide that light.  And provide it I will.&quot;\n\nHe looks to Kup and the other=\r\ns.\n\n&quot; We all have to start somewhere.  It may not be where everyone expects=\r\n.  But the smallest of changes can always lead to the best of results.  Kup=\r\n, Elita, Lord Elder, guard the Ark.  I&#39;m going to head over to the Maximal =\r\nBase, and I&#39;m going to talk to Nightstrike.  I think if we start gradually,=\r\n we&#39;ll get to where we need to be.&quot;\n\nHe opens the door to the outside, and =\r\ntransforms into a larger vehicle, with a sizeable trailer, looking a bit li=\r\nke a modern day truck.\n\n&quot;Inform me of Night Shift&#39;s progress as soon as he =\r\nreports.  Keep safe my comrades.&quot;\n\nHe slowly rolls off the ramp, stopping a=\r\nt the end, and signalling his next direction before rolling off to the Maxi=\r\nmal base.  His speed is kept at a casual fifty five miles per hour.\n\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n He turns back to his comrades.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Night Shift should be almost at th=\r\ne Dark Fortress, hopefully he will send us the information we need to rever=\r\nse the shell program which infects Rodimus and possibly Nightlight and Wind=\r\nlord. It may take him some time to get it to us, but be prepared, it could =\r\nhappen sooner than later.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder stood at first with his arms fol=\r\nded over his chest, when\n&gt; his jaw dropped and his arms dropped to his side=\r\ns, &quot;A New Prime!&quot; he\n&gt; said in an awed whispered, his optics bright! &quot;Maybe=\r\n we have a chance\n&gt; now against the Decepticons and the Unicronians!&quot; Elder=\r\n as he stepped\n&gt; back a pace.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What do we do now?&quot; Elder said, ready t=\r\no relinquish his role in the\n&gt; Ark to one obviously of greater stature.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Don&#39;t forget, everyone here, Maximals and Predacons, Auto=\r\nbots and\n&gt; Decepticons have all been converted to basic human height, espec=\r\nially\n&gt; in robot mode. Even Skorponok, who used to turn into a base as well=\r\n as\n&gt; the Scorpion is now just a massive 8-9&#39; tall in robot mode (about max=\r\n\n&gt; human hgt) and he lost his base mode. However I am considering\n&gt; somethi=\r\nng that might be the equivalent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
