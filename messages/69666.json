He lands on his side, =\r\nand remains still.  His only hope now was that Rat Trap could get to the Ar=\r\nk.  \n\nTrying to get away from the internal defenses proves difficult to Rat=\r\n Trap.  With the droids hot on his tail literally, he struggles to scamper =\r\nout of his predicament.\n\n&quot; This is it, I&#39;m a dead rat!  I&#39;m a dead rat!  I&#39;=\r\nM A DEAD RAT! GAHHHH!!!&quot;\n\nOut of sheer panic he slides into a slip hole int=\r\no a vent shaft.  It proves dark and tight, just big enough for a rat to fit=\r\n in.  He stays there to catch his breath.\n\n&quot; Sorry Wheels... I ran into a m=\r\najor set back..  Maaaaan talk about a mouse trap.&quot;  \n\nThe transmitter given=\r\n to him, begins to pulse.  Just a slight faster than before.  Yet still ver=\r\ny far away from his destination, Rat Trap looks to it, and listens to it.\n\n=\r\n&quot; The transmitter.. It&#39;s - got somethn&#39;.  Kinda faint but a little bit fast=\r\ner than before..  Which way now?&quot;\n\nWith so many droids roaming the halls, i=\r\nt would prove impossible for Rat Trap to continue his journey unseen.  He t=\r\nhinks to himself.\n\n&quot; If I sit here I ain&#39;t never gonna get ta the Ark.  And=\r\n if I don&#39;t get ta the ark, those preds&#39;n cons are gonna exploit it for the=\r\nir own personal gain.  And it looks like Tucson&#39;s the key ta gettn&#39; what th=\r\ney want.  No, I can&#39;t just sit here, he&#39;s count&#39;n on me.

She was=\r\n unconcious. Again, with every effort he tries to make, his actions once ag=\r\nain put a major strain on his systems as his energy levels drop from sixty =\r\nto forty percent. This wouldn&#39;t bode well for him. He could no longer trans=\r\nform, he could no longer move without great effort. He collapses to the gro=\r\nund, and now hearing Scorponok&#39;s steps, he remains up against a wall, burnt=\r\n out, nearly broken, and severely drained of his resources. His shinny silv=\r\ner armor scuffed and dented, appearing like something out of a major car wr=\r\neck. He could not go any further. !!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap stands over him and stay=\r\ns by his side.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheels, no, ya can&#39;t give up on me, not like this.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Tucson puts his hand with effort into Rat Traps&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I - may not be -=\r\n able to move, but, you - still have all your energy reserves - in tact. Ra=\r\nt - Trap. I - need you to - f- find the others, Zarak mentoned the Ark.. Yo=\r\nu - must find it and - try to get help. Can - you do that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap n=\r\nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I hate leavn&#39; ya here Wheels, but we&#39;re outa options. Okay, I&#39;=\r\nll do it. For you I&#39;ll risk my aft. But, how do I find it? When will I know=\r\n I&#39;ve reached it?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson gasps for breath. He then takes off his tran=\r\nsmitter from his helmet and turns on a beacon. The beacon pulses slowly on =\r\nit. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There is a beacon on this transmitter. The faster it - pulsates=\r\n, the closser you - are to finding the Ark. It was installed on my helmet a=\r\nfter I became visually impaired, so I could find my way back to the Ark aft=\r\ner - each mission. The beacon reacts to the alloys used to build the ship. =\r\nAnd only ones used by Autobots. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap takes the transmitter.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;But without this you&#39;re a sittn&#39; duck. This is our ears, this is how you n=\r\navigate. Without this, you&#39;ll be bumpn&#39; the walls constantly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson =\r\nsighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I can&#39;t go anywhere anyway. Now, get - going. You have a lot =\r\nof ground to cover.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap nodds, while Tucson secures the transmit=\r\nter onto his left ear, while in his rat form. The transmitter seems rather =\r\nlarge for his ear yet, he carries it sufficiantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You can count on =\r\nme Wheels.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He leaves his disabled friend, and darts out into the hall=\r\nways in his rat form, cautiously moving and freezing in place once in open =\r\nareas. The transmitter blips slowly. He still had a long way to go before h=\r\ne could reach the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the briefest of moments Zarak caught a =\r\nglimpse of the reading on\n&gt; &gt; his scanner, and all he could see immediately=\r\n that what was hidden in\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon&#39;s helm was no simple rat, there was too=\r\n much energy there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However the rat quickly transferred energy to =\r\nTuscon in the form of a\n&gt; &gt; fuel dump, and quicker than Zarak would have th=\r\nought possible Tuscon\n&gt; &gt; was back in action, along with Rat Trap!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n It seemed like it only took seconds! Rat Trap appeared, Tuscon\n&gt; &gt; revived=\r\n, Darkhawk was knocked down, and for a moment it seemed as if\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon wa=\r\ns going to drive right over him, but then he swerved, and\n&gt; &gt; after a blast=\r\n from Rat Trap that blasted open a section of wall they\n&gt; &gt; took off down.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zarak smiled as he sent a few shots from his energy rifle down aft=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; the fleeing Autobot and Maximal!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quickly he leaped over to =\r\nwhere the fallen Darkhawk lay as he opened a\n&gt; &gt; communication to Hydras an=\r\nd Perceptor, &quot;The prisoner has escaped!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Zarak looked back over at the =\r\nhole that was blown in the door as he\n&gt; &gt; spoke, &quot;There were two of them. O=\r\nne of them was hiding on that Tuscon\n&gt; &gt; Autobot. He somehow freed him and =\r\nthey&#39;re driving through the base!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even as Zarak did quick scan of=\r\n Darkhawk to check his vitals, a deep\n&gt; &gt; thunk of metal boots hitting thic=\r\nk deck plating could be heard from\n&gt; &gt; behind him. A door slid open.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; After ascertaining that Darkhawk would live he stood and turned, &quot;Yes\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; my old friend, the time has come once again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Taking up the enti=\r\nre frame of the door was the massive figure of\n&gt; &gt; Scorponok, Zarak&#39;s secon=\r\nd body so to speak. At the moment it was\n&gt; &gt; headless, giving it a strangel=\r\ny ghastly and yet vulnerable appearance.\n&gt; &gt; However that was easily rectif=\r\nied as Zarak leaped into the air and\n&gt; &gt; with the tel-tale sounds of gears =\r\ngrinding he shifted into a head, one\n&gt; &gt; that slipped perfectly between Sco=\r\nrponok&#39;s shoulders and clicked.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In his own form Zarak was short, e=\r\nven diminutive, but now joined once\n&gt; &gt; again with Scorponok he was fully h=\r\nead and shoulders taller then most\n&gt; &gt; Maximals and Predicons! With a Decep=\r\nticon purple frame and powerfully\n&gt; &gt; built green limbs he radiated aggress=\r\nion and domminance! The cannons\n&gt; &gt; mounted on his shoulders and the massiv=\r\ne claws that he had for hands\n&gt; &gt; were mute testimony to the true destructi=\r\nve potential that lay at his\n&gt; &gt; command.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He transformed into his =\r\ndestructive crab mode and took off after Rat\n&gt; &gt; Trap and Tuscon!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOOC: I think that Cyclonus and Scourge and the rest are somewhat\n&gt; &gt; separa=\r\nte from all this for them not to be involved, so I will post for\n&gt; &gt; them i=\r\nn a different letter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Zarak-Scorponok)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
