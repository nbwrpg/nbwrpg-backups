I never knew he was rebuilding her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The sly fool.&quot;=\r\n SKY SHADOW said, &quot;He could have used his resources in\n&gt; so many other ways=\r\n.&quot; There was a thoughtful look in his optics as he\n&gt; led the way towards ca=\r\nrgo bay four.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nThere was a contemplative pause from DIN=\r\nOBOT as he considered this.  &quot;And yet, look at what he has.  Either he has =\r\nsomeone who has injured him in the past that he can then humiliate for the =\r\npurposes of revenge, or he has himself a capable assistant if his reprogram=\r\nming has gone.  I would see few other ways of resources that we all would i=\r\nndulge in.  To humiliate one who had wronged us or to indulge in the irony =\r\nof their remaking.  There are fewer things more..  Predacon to be done.&quot;\n\nP=\r\nerahps, ironically, unaware that was a reason for his own resurrection.  &quot;B=\r\nut, I would like to find out how he gathered himself a new protoform and lo=\r\ncated her regardles sto remake and reprogram without the rest of us knowing=\r\n.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD =96 HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras: Hydras smirked and said &quot;I hope t=\r\nhat tarantulus hasnt taken the last\n&gt; &gt; protophorm, I need a female protoph=\r\norm... &quot;and said at his com link\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Fractil!!!! Come with me&quot; Hydras arri=\r\nved at the room where Blackaraniahh\n&gt; &gt; and Tarantulus was\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD - CRYO=\r\nTEK&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK shook his head as they walked, &quot;There are two other proto=\r\nform\n&gt; on my shuttle, they are thus far undesturbed.&quot; he looked over at\n&gt; H=\r\nYDRAS, &quot;The clear one no longer has a gender and is ready for your\n&gt; use.&quot; =\r\nMeaning ofcourse that HYDRAS can implant his onw gender on it.\n&gt; &quot;The black=\r\n one remains mine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The last time HYDRAS saw the protoforms they were =\r\nboth at CRYOTEK&#39;s\n&gt; base, and the black one had a strange temporal signatur=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nAt tihs point, DINOBOT walked along with SKY SHADOW=\r\n and FRACTYL to his sides.  Speaking quietly to SKY SHADOW.  &quot;What I Wonder=\r\n is why he so readily cooperates.  My..  Files on him are rather limited, b=\r\nut I do recall there was little love lost between him and..  Our Lord.&quot;  DI=\r\nNOBOT&#39;s immediate loyalties to HYDRAS rather htan the one who had made him.=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD - TARANTALUS&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another cackle from TARANTULUS, &quot;Oh yes, the sp=\r\nider is definitely out\n&gt; of the bag now.&quot; He said almost gleefully. &quot; He lo=\r\noked at\n&gt; BLACKARACNIA, &quot;It was time to reveal you.&quot; He rubs his hands toge=\r\nther\n&gt; in a conspiratal fashion. &quot;The crowning master pice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Although =\r\nTARANTULUS has given BLACKARACNIA as much data as he could\n&gt; muster, her se=\r\narch for information yields very little on CRYOTEK. He\n&gt; was a criminal mas=\r\nter mind and a cunning and intellignet scinetist and\n&gt; engieneer. While on =\r\nCYBERTON he was MEGATRON&#39;s tutor and led the\n&gt; attempt to steal the golden =\r\ndisk but was double crossed by MEGATRON.\n&gt; Little was heard from him until =\r\nrecently. He had a base in the valley\n&gt; Mine of Pentatron that HYDRAS had v=\r\nisited recently. There is little\n&gt; other concrete data on him or his curren=\r\nt agenda. Why he is helping\n&gt; HYDRAS not revealed in the computer files.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; http://www.wikihost.org//w/nbwrpg_wiki/valley_mine_pentatron\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - =\r\nBLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nHer search upon CRYOTEK gave her enough to go on.  Enough t=\r\no, in her state of vassaldom, to be aware that something didn&#39;t fit.  &quot;He&#39;s=\r\n come from..  The future, as we did.  But I would gather further along.  So=\r\n what has he seen there?  And he hardly seems the sort to accept a double c=\r\nross so readily.  Much less to give usch resources over to HYDRAS.&quot;\n\nPausin=\r\ng, and then going over the rather..  Minimal data they had of his base of o=\r\nperations, &quot;So, just what exactly do you know he is pursuing?  And consider=\r\n me..  Surprised you&#39;re cooperating again with Megatron yourself.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
