Still trying to fight the program, but is \nfailing.  She puts her hand on Strikers shoulder and looks at him.  \nShe didn&#39;t want to do this, but she had no choice in the matter.  She \nleaned down and picked up Striker, carring him over her shoulder.  \nShe felt her spark breaking as she did this.  She stopped for a \nsecond and looked at Tamron.  She didn&#39;t want to turn Striker over to \nTamron,  but the chip overroad her own programs.  She just stood \nthere, holding Striker, looking at Tamron.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Tamron\n&gt; \n&gt; Tamron looked at his new soldier.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spears, eh?
