She looked in and \nsaw Striker there. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m afraid Ramulus will be coming \nhere soon.  And in order for you to go free, your memory of this \nplace and me must be erased. But do not worry, I shall be happier \nhere serving Master Prebon.  He will look out for me now.&quot;  She \nturned and looked at prebon.  She leaned forward and kissed him, in \nfront of Striker. She then looked at Striker,&quot;You&#39;ll be happier \nwithout having to hurt with the memories of this place.&quot;  She kissed \nPrebon again.  The chip had finally taken her over completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Thanks Allloran for allowing me to control Eagle Eye and for \nmaking \n&gt; the char.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon guided Spears to the brig section as they found Striker&#39;s \n&gt; cell. Prebon relieved Bullet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Go now. We have this under control. Hammer said he might have \n&gt; something you should look at. Wait infront of the base for him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Bullet left. Prebon gazed intot the cell and saw Striker.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look at him. Good news! You are going to go home soon. Just a \nquick \n&gt; little surgery and you&#39;ll be set to return. I&#39;m not going to put \nyou \n&gt; offline for this operation. More fun watching you scream. But \nSpears \n&gt; wants to say something to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Hammer arrived to meet Bullet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look at the scrap I found from a bot I killed! It&#39;s mostly intact, \n&gt; with some good weapons!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That means....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Right! You can probably make the HB1 again!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, but it will still be different. We&#39;ll call it the HB2. The \n&gt; Hammer Bullet 2. It&#39;ll be the greatest war suit anyone has ever \nworn.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get started!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream tried to contacr Zardus again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Zardus! I&#39;ve got an emergency. I just need to ask you a quick \n&gt; question: How many of your soldiers would you be willing to spare \nto \n&gt; join our army to fight Megatron? Bloodystrike is already there, and \n&gt; Gotron said he would join, but is their anyone else I can take back \n&gt; with me?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix yelled to the rest of the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Snowcat, Ratchet, Andromena, come on! Help us install these \ncomputer \n&gt; boards until Ramulus gets back!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix adn Fliq re-enetered the Ark and went back to work.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois/Eagle Eye\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois had to think of a strategy. He saw Eagle Eye try to attack, \n&gt; and made it look like he almost wanted to die, so he had a plan. He \n&gt; called Eagle Eye over.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Eagle Eye, would you anything to keep the mission alive? Even at \nthe \n&gt; point of your own death?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes I would Vulois.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Than so be it. Good-bye Eagle Eye. You have surved with true \nloyalty \n&gt; to the mission.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois de-activated Eagle Eye and opened up his chest plate. He \n&gt; crefully removed the Spark and dropped Eagle Eye&#39;s lifeles body to \n&gt; the ground. He raised the spark above his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now Nemesis, meet your greatest threat! I have the power of myself \n&gt; and Child with me, and the Sprak of an honest and true bot. You can \n&gt; never win now.&quot; Vulois began to channel energy, almost all he had, \n&gt; into Eagle Eye&#39;s spark, &quot;NOW MEET YOUR DOOM!!!&quot; Vulois through the \n&gt; spark with huge force right at Nemesis, hoping to make contact.\n&gt; \n&gt; (This will probably kill Eagle Eye when it touches Nemesis. You can \n&gt; either say killed by Vulois or Nemesis. It doesn&#39;t really matter.)\n\n\n"}}
