Her and her pride were hunting.  \nThe brought down a large zebra.  She started to feast with the other \nlionesses.  After they had eaten most of the animal, they dragged it \nto where the cubs were resting.  She watched the cubs eat and play \nunder the shade of an akasha tree.  She layed down on her side and \none of the cubs came over to her and started biting her ear.  She \nbatted at the cub playfully.  She was happy in her new home.  She \nhadn&#39;t transformed into her robot mode for a long time.  She alomst \nforgot that she could transform.  She had been with this pride for so \nlong.  She hoped that things would never change.  She was a good \nhunter.  A good fighter, and looked out for her pride.  But somehow, \nshe felt that something was missing.  Like she had something to do, \nbut couldn&#39;t remember.  \nShe shrugger her shoulders and put the thought out of her mind.  She \nwas happy where she was.  \nThe cub started batting and pouncing on her tail.  She chuckled to \nherself. Kids, got to love them, she thought.  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
