I paid my dues through hard work and became a leader of a \n&gt;small ill fated faction and I&#39;m still not great. I don&#39;t think you know \n&gt;what greatness is.\n&gt;\n&gt;His sight never strayed from Phoenix while speaking to Spider.\n&gt;\n&gt;Spider: Yeah... Yeah.\n&gt;\n&gt;The furious Spider tries to pretend Deemos doesn&#39;t exist for a moment. He \n&gt;tries to hide his resentment of what Deemos said, but is unable.
