Why are they here again?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Is there anything we should know about the Bushido base before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entering???\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually most of the team is in the dry river bed somewhere on the\n&gt; outskirts of the mine some distance away as I said in the post. I have\n&gt; Nightrazor much further in, but NOT IN THE BASE. I have stopped here\n&gt; and have him looking around because I need some sort of description of\n&gt; what is going on. I have not quite specified where he is because if the\n&gt; player who runs this city talks about armed guards I can flow with the\n&gt; change. At the moment I imagine him either inside the mine area or\n&gt; atleast near the entrance, but that is open depending on what the\n&gt; player shows. It looks as if Kratos (Airly) controls it all, and I was\n&gt; waiting for a description or response from them.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As far as I can tell the base is somewhere in the city ... and wasn&#39;t\n&gt; the Bushido base the last place our runaway Minion was seen? Since\n&gt; Unicron hasn&#39;t mentioned any updated knowledge then these guys have to\n&gt; start here.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I am wrong in this, please let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and\n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
