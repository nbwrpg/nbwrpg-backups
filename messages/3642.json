He had to get into the base. He \nthen turns to the right and starts to run into zig-zag.\n\nSniper grabs his com link. &quot;Iron Raptor, Get your ass out here and \nbring prowl or who ever you can get out here too, We are under attack \nand only 2 or 3 can continue fight the rest need cr chambers, fast.&quot; \nSniper tokk out his rocket launcher and set his rifle to rapid fire. \nhe fired 20 shoots form his rifle at anubis. He fires to rockets at \nsixshot. Sniper looked up and saw Rain clouds, &quot;That will make it a \nlittle darker so it might help.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
