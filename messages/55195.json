She picked him up, threw his body over \nher shoulder and walked towards the base. With luck, another bot \nwould help her. In the mean time, she grinded her teeth together and \nwalked him away from the battle and towards the base.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; Now released from Battera, SharpClaw was freefalling.

The \n&gt; pain was blinding. She lost her sence of where or what was \nhappening. \n&gt; She followed her program and tried to fly higher. They had already \n&gt; managed to reach 700 feet in a short time. Her huge wings flapped \n&gt; hard as she flew almost straight up with her burden of the other \n&gt; bot.  She climbed to almost 1000 feet when she could no longer \n&gt; struggle with her load or against the pain and let him fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her body seemed slightly releived to no longer half to fly with \nthat \n&gt; much weight. But the blast had done damage. Her wings started to \n&gt; tighten up and she too, started to fall. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; &gt; SharpClaw allowed himself to be captured in Battera&#39;s claw.
