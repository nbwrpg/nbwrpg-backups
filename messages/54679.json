He was heading to Ea=\r\nrth to \n&gt; visit some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he=\r\n got there, he \n&gt; decided he would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He =\r\nfound one in the ships \n&gt; databanks. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete=\r\n with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             As he cleared Temp =\r\nSpace he started the scan of the \n&gt; truck, every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then=\r\n downloaded the information into himself. He \n&gt; got up from his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chai=\r\nr, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons, and went to \n&gt; prepare. As he=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the \n&gt; peop=\r\nle on this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             He touched=\r\n his chest, the change to actual bot had \n&gt; hurt his combined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spark.=\r\n Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             I=\r\nn the deep Prime voice that had once declared to \n&gt; Megatron that &quot;one \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus would dare \n&gt; betray me =\r\nlike that?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t even sit down as he entered the atmosphere, th=\r\ne ship \n&gt; shook. He was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus h=\r\nad planted on the \n&gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s =\r\nthrusters exploded, but the rest of the \n&gt; ship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, it =\r\ncareened out of control and slammed into the \nground, \n&gt; throwing Prime \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. \n&gt; H=\r\ne was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked=\r\n back to \n&gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been=\r\n ripped apart, and the \n&gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyon=\r\ne could see the protoform \nunderneath, \n&gt; the red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that turned an=\r\nd looked. His faceplate was smashed and dented, \n&gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshie=\r\nld&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the shoulder \n&gt; joints on the &gt; insi=\r\nde. All in all he looked like some sort of \nrobot \n&gt; sent back from the fut=\r\nure, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but he \n=\r\n&gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, th=\r\ne communications boxes on these \n&gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. =\r\nHe would need it to talk to the other bots. \n&gt; First though was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodi=\r\nmus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he started, with d=\r\nisgust, &quot;and the \n&gt; one known as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra.
