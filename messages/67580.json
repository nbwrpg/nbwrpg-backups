He&#39;s been with Hydras (preds) and Perseus\n&gt; (maximals). He and a f=\r\new others just stole a shuttle from the\n&gt; pacificus maximals.  Even on beas=\r\ntwars he started as a pred, but\n&gt; refused to follow megatron and joined the=\r\n maximals.  When he was\n&gt; killed and resurrected in transmetal 2 form, he w=\r\nas once again a pred.\n&gt;  Dinobot has realy never been loyal to any faction =\r\nexclusively.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the factions we have 3 predicon and 2 maximal fact=\r\nions.  The\n&gt; watchers are neutral and not to receptive to strangers visitin=\r\ng them.\n&gt; Preston got the descriptions mostly right.

The Autobots\n=\r\nhave the\n&gt; &gt; basic ethos of &quot;Peace is the right of all sentient beings&quot; whi=\r\nle the\n&gt; &gt; Decepticons are about &quot;Peace through tyranny!&quot; or &quot;Might makes\nr=\r\night!&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; However there are variations on each theme.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you look=\r\n at the Wiki site (which I encourage you to do) under the\n&gt; &gt; subsection su=\r\nmmary and setting which kind of gives you a break down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (I have gra=\r\nfted these from the site. please read them there in their\n&gt; &gt; entirety)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You have at least two versions of predacon : BUSHIDO PREDACONS who\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n believe that preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe little while they still have before the Minions start an all-out\n&gt; &gt; war=\r\n. their leader is Spire. And IRON SKULL PREDACONS who believe that\n&gt; &gt; Maxi=\r\nmals are weak and they would rather take over the lead from the\n&gt; &gt; Maximal=\r\ns and act right now. Their leader is Jotunn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You also have at least=\r\n two versions of Maximal: PACIFICUS MAXIMALSwho\n&gt; &gt; believe that peace is t=\r\nhe only way everybody can focus on the efforts\n&gt; &gt; against the Minions. The=\r\nir leader is Perseus. While you also have the\n&gt; &gt; SILVER WINGS MAXIMALS who=\r\n are convinced that the Predacons are\n&gt; &gt; preparing a revolution and that t=\r\nhey want to prepare a strike against\n&gt; &gt; them. They think they should take =\r\nthem all out before things get\nrough.\n&gt; &gt; Their leader is Razorwing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Then there are THE WATCHERS who look to me to still be Maximals but\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nake in members from other factions like Predacons. This faction is\n&gt; &gt; dedi=\r\ncated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty and swift,\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nthey are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skills also\n&gt; &gt; include di=\r\nplomacy, however, as members of any factions can join the\n&gt; &gt; Watchers. The=\r\nir leader is Elder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then there are the Minions of Unicron, generall=\r\ny called either Minions\n&gt; &gt; or Unicronians. Their apparent goal is to turn =\r\nthe Earth into a ripe\n&gt; &gt; feeding ground for Unicron. Unicron realizing tha=\r\nt the energon present\n&gt; &gt; on Earth was too powerful for him to absorb right=\r\n away, left minions\n&gt; &gt; behind to keep an eye on Earth until the crystals w=\r\nere ripe for his\n&gt; &gt; taking. (Remember how the crystals originally interfer=\r\ned with Maximals\n&gt; &gt; & Predacons, and they couldn&#39;t stay in robot mode?) Up=\r\n until\nrecently a\n&gt; &gt; sort of Cold War was raging between the Unicronians a=\r\nnd the\n&gt; &gt; Cybertronians however with the arrival of Cyclonus, Scourge and =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; sweeps, and the addition of several new warriors this cold war\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthreatens to explode into something more. They are led by Vorpal, a\n&gt; &gt; pow=\r\nerful villain who&#39;s full abilities have yet to be revealed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope =\r\nthis helps, and I am sure the others will give corrections and\n&gt; &gt; expansio=\r\nns as well. Also Please read what is on the Wiki site, and\n&gt; &gt; explore the =\r\ndifferent links. There is ALOT of information there -\n&gt; &gt; Pictures of some =\r\nof the bases, who leads, facts about the characters,\n&gt; &gt; the history and mu=\r\nch more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n______________________=\r\n______________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a bet=\r\nter friend, newshound, and\n&gt; &gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
