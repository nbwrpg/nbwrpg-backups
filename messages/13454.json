She\n&gt; turns away from the computer.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah good. Glad you could make it. Quickstrike, we need your computer\n&gt; skills to get the main power generator up and running. Meantime DarkMouse\nand\n&gt; I will take a look around the bunker a little more. Tarantulas,&quot; She\npaused\n&gt; an looked at him in puzzlement for a moment, &quot;You can start reading the\n&gt; commander, or whatever was in charge here, journal entry&#39;s. Got it?&quot;\n&gt;     Tarantulas transformed and nodded. He walked over to one of the\nterminals\n&gt; and began to read. Aracnia took Dark Mouses shoulder and began to lead her\n&gt; back out the door into the dark hallway to investigate.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Megatron was indeed tired. Waspinators infernal humming was the only\n&gt; thing keeping him awake. He was mostly watching radar and filling out the\n&gt; daily report.\n&gt;     &quot;Megatron made cat bot commander! Why not Waspinator?&quot; He said\nsuddenly,\n&gt; with out any hesitation.\n&gt;     Megatron turned a heavey optic to him. &quot;Your stupid, and an idiot.\nKitkat\n&gt; is smart a reliable.
