The internal explosion blew her apart.  Her \nlower body blown off and laying in fragments of metal on the ground \nnear her. Her torso was hollowed out and her face was burnt.  Her \nleft arm was blown off, but her right arm was still attached.  She \nlay there, gasping for breath.  Her optics already black,  her spark \nin it&#39;s finally beats.\nShe whispered,&quot;Hotrod....HotRod..I...I..&quot; her spark \nflutters,&quot;I...loved...you...for...give....me.&quot;  a single tear ran \ndown her cheek as the finall breath escaped past her \nlips.  &quot;HotRooooddd.&quot;  Her spark went to join the matrix.\nHer once beautiful body now lay in charred pieces on the ground.\n\n\n(Please put Feline on the deceased list.)\n\n\n"}}
