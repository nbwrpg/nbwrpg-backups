The \nflame blast incinerated the back of his shirt but did no real harm.  \nBefore he stopped he spun about and saw the incoming shots.  He knew \nwhat to do though, it was ingrained in his spark.  He put his hands \ntogether in front of him and through them out to the sidescreating a \nsmall barrier of energy destroying the shots.  He retaliates by \nclosing his fists and placing them together in front of him aimed at \nGalvatron.  As he concentratesa ball of energy envelops his hands.  \nThe ball grows to the size of a basketball.  &quot;BEAM CANNON!&quot;  A column \nof energy is launched from his hands directly at Galvatron.\n\n\n"}}
