He then\nlooked to the rest of his comerades, the confidence returning to his\nface, so as not to show the others his moment of weakness. &quot;We do as he\nsays.&quot; Hook told Scrapper, leaping into the air, &quot;Constructicons,\ntransform, phase one.&quot; he said, as he shifted in midair, his arms\nhooking in, his legs turning over, and his torso extending from his\nbody, as his crane became apparant. He shrieked a loud cry of pain in\nhis transformation, and landed on the ground in truck mode, creating a\nlarge thud from his mechanical weight.\n\nScrapper knelt down onto his hands, as they too transformed, as he\nlowered to the ground in his steam shoovel mode, followed by Bonecrusher\nand Scavanger who also shifted. Longhaul and Mixmaster then finished\ntheir transformations as well. \n\nHook drove out to the front, very slowly, &quot;Transform phase two.&quot; he\nshouted, as Scavanger and Mixmaster both drove up, and transformed,\ntheir, Scavanger shifting to stand up on his shovel, as Mixmaster did\nthe same, as they both shimmered in their transformations. Longhaul&#39;s\ntruck form took off from the ground, and shifted in mid air, connecting\nto the two legs to form an impressive lower body, as he two shimmered.\nHook followed, barrely making it to the body, and connectin as the chest\npart, and shimmering as well. Bonecrusher and Scavanger followed,\nhooking on the the sides of Hook, and begin to shimmer, but strangely\nBonecrusher quickly stops shimmering, and falls off in a loud klang, as\nthe rest of Devastator begins to crumble as well, (Okay, you guys can\npost now :).\n\nHooks lands on his side, transforming, and screams clutching his\nshoulder.\n\n"}}
