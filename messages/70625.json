Will Hydras and his team be taking any\nprecautions as far as security, or is everyone just sorta traveling in\ndisorganized pack? Is everyone going with Hydras or are some staying\nbehind? Will Hydras be doing anything with the shuttle like leaving a\ngaurd with it, sending it back to base or whatever?\n\nOh, and as a note - you can do as you like, but keep in mind that the\nground here is fairly open and barren, which means very few places to\nhide unless someone has some sort of invisibility or something.\n\nI look forward to your reply :)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
