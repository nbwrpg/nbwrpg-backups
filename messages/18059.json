They entered jsut when the DNA scanners had activated.\n    &quot;Quickly! In a few moments it will be to late!&quot; Tarantulas hissed, \nrushing over and ripping open the control panle. He unhooked several wires, \nplaced the ever important Predacon chip in place of the Maximal chip, and \nseal the control panle back up. His fastest record yet.\n    Aerostreak looked around. &quot;So, is it a Predacon?&quot; He didnt like be so far \naway from the ship, and the others.\n    &quot;Yes Aerostreak. When the bot emerges it will be a Predacon!&quot; He laughed \nwith Aaerostreak, until a fimiliar rumbeling broke there happiness.\n    &quot;I know that buzz.....oh no....&quot; Tarantulas said, as he looked up to see \nHell Beast and Gremlin. They were armed, and pissed off.\n    &quot;Ah, Tarantulas, thank you for saving me the trouble of reprogramming \nthat pod! Drop your wepons now, or be destroyed!&quot; He barked at them, floating \na few feet above the pod. Gremlin approached and looked down apon the pod. \n&quot;Its clear.&quot;\n    &quot;Excellent. Now we wait until the bot emerges. In the mean time, I wish \nyou two to give a message to Black Aracnia for me.&quot; He said with a sly smile.\n    &quot;And what would that be?&quot; Aerostreak tried to say bravely.\n    Hell Beast shot two missles at the Predacons from his shoulder canons, \nsending the two flying out of sight deeper into the forest. He then gave his \nattention to the pod.\n    &quot;I have had enough of Black Aracnia. I need to find Megatron.....the \ntables have turned, and he is the one holding all of the cards now.&quot;\n\n    Megatron cursed his incompetent Maximal counterparts. Aquarious and \nNighteyes failed to give him what he wanted, and Terrorsaur was still \nmissing. On top of that, Kitkat was getting closer to the truth. \n    (And yes, Logo, you are right on the Remote Control thing.)\n    &quot;Cant you idiots do anything right?Argh! Get out of my sight before I \nsend you both to the scrap pile!&quot; He roared in fustration. The destruction of \nthe Autobots seemed to be getting harder and harder......but prehaps a covert \nspy within the Cybertronian Fire would prove useful...\n    &quot;Ah yes....a spy. Nighteyes, I have a new mission for you.&quot; He said, and \nthen gave a bellowing laugh.\n    \n\n"}}
