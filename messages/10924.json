Why\n&gt; doesn&#39;t anyone ever pay attention to Hakibuscon!!!!  Is it because \nhe is\n&gt; neutral?  Why?  Why doesn&#39;t anyone notice him?  He attempted to \nsave the\n&gt; CF!  And nobody payed attention to his fire!  Anyways, just getting \nthat\n&gt; off my chest.  Don&#39;t worry about him right now though, he is just \nwondering\n&gt; off somewhere(I don&#39;t even know!). \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. Dinobot and Tavatron!  Hell Drak and Necromancer are talking \nto you\n&gt; guys!! Answer me!\n\n\n"}}
