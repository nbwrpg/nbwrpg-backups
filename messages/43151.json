She \nmoved \n&gt; closer to the maximal city.  She was now only a quarter of a mile \n&gt; from the outside walls.  She wondered how long untill the cannons \n&gt; would come down on her. Little did she know the maximal chip inside \n&gt; her totally disguised her predacon signature. So when the automated \n&gt; systems tracked her, they would only see a maximal and not a \npredacon.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OK, I&#39;ll need someone in the maximal city who just might be \nwatching \n&gt; the scanners or watching the perimeter to at least pick up the \n&gt; maximal signal and attempt to talk to her. Thank you. )\n\n\n"}}
