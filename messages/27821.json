With that he flew forwards, and the rest\nfollowed him.\n\nIn a circling and complex transformation, Motormaster compacted, and\nenlarged a bit, forming a large piece of black metal, with stubs on the\nends. Wildrider and Speedbreaker both transformed into car modes, and then\ntransformed again, gaining feet, and hooking up to Motormaster. Drag Strip,\nand Dead-End both also transformed into car modes, and then transformed\ninto large arms, joining to Motormaster as well. The large body that had\nbeen formed twirled around, and then after a large eminating light,\ntransformed, a huge head with horns, and a vacant fave emerged from the\ntop, as well as armor Transforming all around.\n\nThe huge monster of a robot stoped and soared , standing upright, and\nhovering in mid air. He was huge, and an awesome form, 45 feet of robot\nhovering above the battle field, staring at the combatants on the ground.\n&quot;MENASOR&quot; he pronounced his name.\n\nHe looked around for a target, and noticed Hot Rod, then looked some more\nand noticed Prow. &quot;MENASOR.....CRUSH&quot; he said in a deep booming voice that\ncould be heard from all around. He raised his arms, and huge barrels\nunderneath were present. He aimed one arm at Prowl, and the other at Hot\nRod, and Fired, leting huge Plasma energy erupting from both towards the\ntargets, from the air like raining fire.\n\n\n\n"}}
