Tripredacus was only three bots, WarMachine is \nfive. Besides, Rampage was 12 feet tall. If you&#39;re saying Shockaract \nis that high, he&#39;d be about four times as small as WarMachine (who&#39;s \nover 45 feet tall). If you want Shockaract to be nearly as bit (even \nnot nearly as big, say 20 feet), that would be breaking the giant bot \nrule. Gestalts are giant, but they&#39;re five bots, not one, and were \naprooved back in March or April.\n\n::WarMachine::\n\nWarMachine laughs, bringing up an arm to absorb the shot.\n\n&quot;You can&#39;t hope to defeat me, fool!&quot; he yells, firing from his \nshoulder missile launchers at Shockaract, several dozen machine gun \nshots accompanying the two missiles.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Shokaract, up to a new gestalt from beast wars, would only be \na very\n&gt; small amount smaller, take a look at Rampage compared to \nTripredacus.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Shokaract looked in the direction of the firepower as it \nshipped his\n&gt; armor rapidly. A bot larger than himself. Shokaract aimed his \nsmaller cannon\n&gt; at WarMachine&#39;s head and fires,,,\n\n\n"}}
