They saw magnus being fired upon. \nThey took cover behind his armor and watched as his guns started fire. \nGabriel remembered his special tool against the crazy bot from before. He \nyelled out to all the maximals. &quot;Get behind Magnus and shield your eyes.&quot; As \nhe said it he pulled a flare bomb from his back and chucked it over the top \nof the truck armor. He watched and pressed the remote denenator as it \ncleared. It should blind all the bots infront of magnus for about 15 seconds.\n\n"}}
