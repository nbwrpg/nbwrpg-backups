He \n&gt; screeched as his chest burst with an electric explosion, missile \nshrapnel was \n&gt; mixed in with his robotic organs, his snake skin was lying around \nhim in \n&gt; shards. He knew better then to try and transform, but the nano \nsystem would \n&gt; no begin if he didn&#39;t... &quot;N-n-n-nightV-v-I-perrrrr Terrrrrorize!&quot; \nHe screamed \n&gt; as hi changed... what lay against the tree was what some would \ndescribe as a \n&gt; &quot;roadkill&quot; The hood was gone shredded the snake face was skeletal \ndown one \n&gt; side its eyes were blinded. The body itself was skinless, and \nalmost zombie \n&gt; like. &quot;Eeeeeraghhh!&quot; He coiled himself into a knot and hugged \nagainst the \n&gt; tree as his entire body began sparking... Through the pain all he \ncould think \n&gt; about was StarStorm, He let his snake tongue flick out and he went \ntowrads \n&gt; the direction she last headed, but as soon as he began to slither \nanother \n&gt; pulse of electricity went though him and his body went into stasis \nlock. \n&gt; &quot;Ssstarssstorm.....&quot; He blacked out and lay silent.\n\n\n"}}
