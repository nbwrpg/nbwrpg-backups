Each one moderately damaged, VICE GRIP=\r\n moreso.\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT paused, then went to charge in over towards SKYBYTE.  =\r\nSwinging his\n&gt; tailblade over to try and slash SKYBYTE across the faceplate=\r\n, &quot;Coward, let&#39;s\n&gt; see you without your minions!  And reduce you to as much=\r\n scrap of the rest\n&gt; of them!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Menawhile, VICE GRIP transformed to try =\r\nand let his autorepair systems\n&gt; work..\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSlowly VICE GRIP=92s autore=\r\npair systems began to engage. They were\nsluggish and hesitant as they scann=\r\ned over his systems and he began to\ntake full stock of the damage that had =\r\nbeen done, and then a\ncombination of repair nanites and what might pass for=\r\n biological\nrepairs started to be put to work.\n\nOn his internal systems man=\r\ny fault and errors were flashing across his\nsystems, ones that could more e=\r\nasily be repair in a CR chamber, but\ncould if necessary be done by the self=\r\n repair process.\n\nMeanwhile as DINOBOT reached melee range with SKYBYTE, th=\r\ne first thing\nthat registered on SKYBYTE=92s face was shock and then a sens=\r\ne of\ndetermination, and lastly was a look of a pain as DINOBOT=92s slash hi=\r\nt\nhim, while hot in the face, squarely across the chest, and sent him\nreeli=\r\nng backwards!\n\n=93No! It shouldn&#39;t be like this!&quot; SKYBYTE said, a bit of pa=\r\nnic rising\nin his voice. &quot;I will kill you, I will kill you all!&quot; He pulled =\r\nout\nhis blade and stabbed visciously at DINOBOT!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was in=\r\n pain but he knew he had to keep on his toes if he was to get\n&gt; out of this=\r\n battle in one piece.  He had to figure out a way to get\n&gt; Magmatron to lit=\r\nerally take a few hits but through indirect means.  He\n&gt; thinks to himself =\r\nas to how to go about doing so.  But then, it comes to\n&gt; him.  The old drag=\r\non must have had many friends among the Natural world,\n&gt; including the cave=\r\nrn where they were now.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; When all else fails, turn to those who are yo=\r\nur most trusted followers.\n&gt; No matter their size, what lives among you in =\r\nNature, can prove to be your\n&gt; greatest  comrades.  I get it now.   I know =\r\nwhat I must do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot stops the music, as she watches her broth=\r\ner lift his head and\n&gt; begin to emit a soft rumble from his throat.  Yet th=\r\ne pitch of the sound is\n&gt; too high for normal ears, it is well received by =\r\nthrongs of cave dwelling\n&gt; bats that swarm out in clouds of activity.  He h=\r\noped that they would be\n&gt; enough to throw Magmatron for a loop.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickst=\r\nride tries desperately to fend off the remaining Sharkitcons while\n&gt; Rattra=\r\np lends him a hand in doing so.  It&#39;s at this time when bats cover the\n&gt; ai=\r\nr around them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Whoah!  Where&#39;d these things come from?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They lea=\r\nrn to sidestep the bats yet the tiny creatures continue to swarm!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nM=\r\nAGMATRON laughed, =93Bats!?

Yo=\r\nu have to fight, I know you are\nstill in there somewhere!=94\n\nNEMESIS laugh=\r\ned, =93I can assure you that the being that you once knew\nas OPTIMUS is tot=\r\nally gone, burned away in the black flames of the\nUnicronian fires below.=\r\n=94\n\nEven as NEMESIS spoke, flames of blackness began to rise from the pit,=\r\n\nreaching up to almost touch the bridge that NEMESIS PRIME and RODIMUS\nnow =\r\nstood. The BLACK PRIME who had been holding DARK RODIMUS by the\nthroat mere=\r\nly dropped to the ground at his feet as he smiled\nexultantly.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThat had a series of furious BACKPEDALS over from the shocked PREDACONS the=\r\nn\n&gt; as the melee seemed to sweep around, DINOBOT nearly pausing from his br=\r\nutal\n&gt; exchange of blows with SKYBYTE with a &#39;WHAT THE SLAG&#39; sort of expres=\r\nsion on\n&gt; his face..\n&gt;\n&gt; Along wtih VICE GRIP, who was trying to dig himsel=\r\nf a small dugout to hide\n&gt; in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, as the explosions carried through.=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shooting thorugh the tunnel entrance up above, to HIT NEMESIS PRIME o=\r\nn the\n&gt; head came WASPINATOR&#39;S SCALP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming he impacted and styaed t=\r\nhere, WASPINATOR moaned, &quot;Owwiez..
