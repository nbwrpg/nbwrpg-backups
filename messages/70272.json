Lord Elder, This is Rat Trap, Wheels was commn&#39; out with the \n&gt;&gt; others, but Rodimus told &#39;em ta go, he did, but he just turned around and \n&gt;&gt; now he&#39;s gon&#39; back in for Rodimus! I dunno if he&#39;s gonna be able ta come \n&gt;&gt; out in one piece!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Elder&#39;s voice came back on the same channel, &quot;What?!?&quot; Elder\n&gt; paused, obviously taking a moment to digest what had been sent to him\n&gt; in a few short words. &quot;Rodimus told him to go back? Where is Rodimus\n&gt; now, and where is Tuscon?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tuscon?&quot; Elder said, trying to contact Tuscon directly, although Rat\n&gt; Trap could probably hear it as well, &quot;What is your situation?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Inside, Tucson&#39;s many wheels turn rapidly as he tries to reach Rodimus. \n&gt;&gt; Because of his failure two years past, he tries to redeem himself by \n&gt;&gt; actually succeeding in bringing out his comrade alive. He knew the \n&gt;&gt; attempt could endanger his life as well, but by Primus he had to try. He \n&gt;&gt; sounds his horn three more times, hoping that Rodimus would hear him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon is quickly able to reach the wall of debris that stood between\n&gt; him and Rodimus. The wall looked to be quite thick and impenetrable,\n&gt; however not as impenetrable as it had before Tuscon had left the first\n&gt; time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dirt and stone and even bits of plant matter still filled the\n&gt; entrance, but it is obvious that the previous explosion had weakened\n&gt; the slide of debris in several places. The smell of sulfur was in the\n&gt; air, obviously coming from the other side of the slide.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, Hydras\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Throne Room\n&gt;\n&gt; The door to the throne room was flung open, and there standing in the\n&gt; doorway was the dirty and dented form of Cyclonus. He was covered from\n&gt; nearly head to toe in dirt, soil and other bits of immediately\n&gt; unidentifiable matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hydras!&quot; Cyclonus said as he spotted his commander and sprang into\n&gt; the room. &quot;What has happened?&quot; Cyclonus attempted to grab his scanner\n&gt; and then realized that he had lost it somewhere. He glanced around for\n&gt; a moment and then grabbed one from near the throne and began running\n&gt; over Hydras, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
