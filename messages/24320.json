In \none fluid motion she jumped, transformed, and drew her staff. She landed \nabout ten feet from Iron Raptor, just as Nemisis Enforcer gave the order to \nkill her. Tavatron fired several optic blasts as she tried to intercept the \nremainder of his shots. She then fired one solid blast at Nemisis Enforcer&#39;s \ntorso.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria charged her rifle and ran through the new &#39;exit&#39; provided by one of \nthe Alliance &#39;bots. She raised her rifle and fired two plasma energy bolts \nat Obliteratron before restoring it to cyber space and replacing it with her \narm/shoulder cannons.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Nemesis Enforcer yelled to Scattershot via comm. transmission.  &quot;IRON \n&gt;RAPTOR\n&gt;IS IN THE BATTLE!  KILL HER!&quot; He activated the boosters in his feet and \n&gt;held\n&gt;his wings aloft, keeping his arms akimbo with the rapid firing-laser rifle.\n&gt;\n&gt;He flew at Iron Raptor, firing off ten rapid laser blasts at her torso.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
