Now they scrape by, begging for scraps.&quot;\n\nThey were indeed &#39;empties&#39; as Tankor called them, but most of them\nkept thier distance from Tankor and his troop, thier optics bright and\neager. They looked to be all manner of shapes and sizes, some of them\nmay have been construction worers, others may have been soldiers, but\nall of them looked tired, haggard, almost diseased. If this were a\nhuman town, humans might describe them as the wretched homeless\nbeggers that clog the allyways of some of the bigger cities.\n\nTankor led Hydras and his team into the building, large doors slid\nopen as he approached, and slid closed behind them, locking tight as\nthey did so.\n\nTankor tiilted his head for a moment, a vacant look comming over his\nfeatures, then he nodded and looked at Hydras, &quot;Your team will remain\nhere, you will follow me to see Breakout.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
