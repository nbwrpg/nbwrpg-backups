Triceradon:PREDACON SCUM!!!\nStegotron dodged a couple of blasts, but one him in the chest. It made him almost fall over but he quickly regained his balance and continued firing his cannon at the Predacons.\nUltracon finaly arrived and saw his two freinds battling Predacons. So he took out his fusion cannon and fired it at Counter Punch. \nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector/Manterror/Counter Punch/Double Punch/Ramhorn:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror just layed there, his optics &quot;shut&quot; as Dark Mouse spoke somewhat to \n&gt; no one.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector got up, firing three stinger missiles at Triceradon&#39;s torso, and two \n&gt; optic blasts at Stegotron&#39;s left side.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline, the cyber-bee controlled by Double Punch, dived down, two optic \n&gt; blasts launching out at Stegotron&#39;s left knee.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Counter Punch, laying on the ground from the kick-backs of his weapons. �\n&gt; Raising both of them, he fired three photon blasts at Triceradon&#39;s abdomen \n&gt; (stomach region), and firing a single rocket at Stegotron, the kick back \n&gt; combined with the weak hold and position of the missiles launcher, sent the \n&gt; missile launcher flying backwards, landing 4 ft away.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch, still cloaked in his stealth mode, controlled Beeline. �After \n&gt; firing at the Maximals attacking that fool Injector, and a Predacon he&#39;d \n&gt; never seen, he leapt from the bushes, raising �both pinchers, he fired a \n&gt; missile at Stegotron&#39;s back, and a missile at the back of Triceradon&#39;s left \n&gt; knee.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramhorn got up slowly. �Taking out a laser pistol, he fired two shots. �At \n&gt; the same time a photon blast skinned his hand. �Dropping the pistol, he \n&gt; noticed a small hole in Counter Punch&#39;s stomach. �Right were he had been \n&gt; aiming for. �Charging forward, he leapt through the air, attempting to tackle \n&gt; Mosquitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n----------\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://home.netscape.com/webmail/\n\n"}}
