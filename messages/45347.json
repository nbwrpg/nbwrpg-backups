I will try to get off of punishment as soon as \nposible, BTW idea.  Do you want to close down the RPG during the \nHolidays to give people time to think ant everything on how to \nimprove the RPG and also cause its the holidays.   \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; That was... rather abrupt. Since another RPer with key characters \n&gt; and such has just quit, the council (i hope they don&#39;t mind that \ni&#39;m \n&gt; speaking for them) is open to suggestions on what we should do, \n&gt; either just continues as if the characters/stuff hadn&#39;t existed, \n&gt; finish off the IGL, restart the rpg, gah, i dunno... hit me with \n&gt; some stuff PLEASE.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I quit.  Lost my &quot;Hysteria&quot; by Def Leppard album and that just \n&gt; shoved me over \n&gt; &gt; the line of anger and don&#39;t feel like putting up with this RPG&#39;s \n&gt; crap.  No, I \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t go into some gay story about my life in the RPG or anything \n&gt; else.  I \n&gt; &gt; quit.  Enough said.\n\n\n"}}
