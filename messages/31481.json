He swears, waving the smoke away and backing up, firing his chain guns blindly in the general direction of the CF. He grunts as two objects hit him in the back, feeling his systems struggle as they tried to regain power, the two objects that had hit him draining energy faster than he could replace it.\n\nHe spins around, backing away from the draining energy fields that the two missiles fired by Zardus had created. The drain lessens and his power levels begin to rise again. He looks up at the enemy, watching Zardus fly in, more than ten Alliance bots following. This was definitely not good.\n\n&quot;Yes, attack,&quot; he replies to the member of the Predacons (gestalt group, not faction) who had sent him a comm, aiming both chain guns at Zardus and firing more than two dozen shots from each.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus angles up, the shots fired by the bot he had just hit with the missiles missing. He scans the area, seeing that there were a good amount of Decepticons here. He activates his comm.\n\n&quot;Astral,&quot; he says into it, &quot;New orders. Come and aid at this battle, bring all the troops that you can.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Galactors spread out as they fly into the scene. Supernova aims his missile launcher, letting loose several shots at Rippersnapper.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Lessee, who I wanna kill?&quot; Flare says, then fires two grenades down at Sinnertwin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nVicyr, completely cloaked, flies below the others, firing three laser bolts at Rampage.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlasys aims carefully, firing two missiles with deadly precision down at Razorclaw.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScrap, flying to the left of the rest of the group, fires four lasers down at Rippersnapper.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl spins around to look at the smoke when he recieves Quarto&#39;s message, thankful for the warning. He sees Alliance bots fly in in the distance and open fire on the attackers.\n\n&quot;Time for battle yet again,&quot; he says to Mantle, flying into the air and seeing someone attacking behind the CF. He flies toward Fireblade, landing quickly near Firedrill and his friends.\n\n&quot;Nice to see you both up and about,&quot; he says to the two that he hadn&#39;t seen conscious untill now. &quot;You guys are welcome to help defend the base.&quot;\n\nProwl lifts off again, flying at Fireblade and firing two missiles at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster runs out of the CF as the alarms go off, his missile launcher firing two missiles at Rippersnapper as soon as he gets out of the door, aiming carefully as to not hit any Maximals.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Argh, forgot about Grimmler! Sorry if I didn&#39;t reply to your last post with Tremmer, Megan)\n\nGrimmler hears gunfire as he heads back to the CF. &quot;Slag! We&#39;re under attack again!&quot; He exclaims and runs off toward the ship, motioning for Tremmer to follow.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rippersnapper/Preadcons::\n&gt; Rippersnapper&#39;s impatience increases, &quot;Signal! Me wanna destroy \n&gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorclaw nears the location intended by Megatron. He opens a \n&gt; commlink to Autofire, &quot;Hello Autofire. I am Razorclaw of the \n&gt; Predacons. Megatron sent me and my Predacons as \n&gt; renforcements, he told us to expect a signal to attack soon, and \n&gt; we are arriving and ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Divebomb reaches Autofire first, lands and transforms, looking \n&gt; around and smiling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rampage is thundering on behind Razorclaw, a sleek panther, a \n&gt; blur on the background. He dodges trees, speeding to the \n&gt; destination, Razorclaw doing likewise, after his commlink message.\n\n\n"}}
