He frowns at the two and directs a \n&gt; comment at them, while speaking to the rest of the Autobots, &quot;The \n&gt; key to our succes lies in our ability to follow orders, and our \n&gt; compassion for all. So, if we follow orders, and arrive at meetings \n&gt; without delay, then we have begun with a good start. Now for \n&gt; orders. Artemis and JetV, I want you two to scout out our current \n&gt; location and report back to me. Hoist, I need you to get the ship&#39;s \n&gt; computers functioning fully. We need to know the status of the \n&gt; ship as soon as possible. Technobots, I want you to start planning \n&gt; a defensive perimetre to deter any enemy bots, or scouts. \n&gt; Dinobots, your task is to guard the Technobots, and the ship. I \n&gt; don&#39;t want any intruders to get in and cause any further damage to \n&gt; our already damaged ship. Everyone else, asses the damages and \n&gt; report back to me when you&#39;ve made a detailed report. Oh, Crotale \n&gt; you&#39;re with me, and you are the second in command. Also, \n&gt; Grimlock, you are in charge of battle planning and our militia \n&gt; forces. Crossroads will be accompanying you around, and he will \n&gt; be your strategic advisor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads gulps at this and glances at the frightning dinosaur \n&gt; towering above him, but he trusts in Pacifix&#39;s judgement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix notices Grimlock&#39;s visage but ignores it, then he catches \n&gt; the eye of Strafe and speaks to him, &quot;Strafe, you look like you&#39;ve \n&gt; got something to say?&quot; He waits attentively.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 17 Jul 2001, at 21:29, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Excellent Jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Grimlock snarled and folded his arms, turning himself away.
