Not even myself.  So, I ask all of you =\r\nto show him the respect, you would show your leader, Lord Elder, and Primes=\r\n who have governed before me.  Let this be known that it is not a request, =\r\nbut as a Prime, I am telling you to respect those who have shown the capabi=\r\nlity of turning over a new leaf.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot; He&#39;s telln&#39; the tr=\r\nuth guys, Perceptor&#39;s legit.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot also gives them a thumbs up.\n\n=\r\n&quot;And if I didn&#39;t give a thumbs up then you&#39;d know it&#39;s not true.&quot;\n\nTucson P=\r\nrime waits for everyone to get out safely before making moves to get himsel=\r\nf out of the deep hole. He assists on holding the cable so is to make it ea=\r\nsier for the others to climb out.  It was what Optimus Prime would have don=\r\ne, before helping himself out of a tight jam.\n\n&quot; All right, I don&#39;t wish to=\r\n overload anyone, so I will wait until everyone else is out safely, before =\r\nI get out of here myself.  I want to make sure that no one is left behind.&quot;=\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Talon=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let him be alone&quot;defended Talon at Perceptor while she landed &quot;He d=\r\nidnt \n&gt; liked to come with us but he was caught helping Rodimus and others =\r\nleave \n&gt; Hydras&#39;s territory, he handt choice&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She was ready for help.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ********\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I knew that this will happen&quot;whispered bitterly Percept=\r\nor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt; From: &quot;Pre=\r\nston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 2010 5:42 AM\n&gt;=\r\n To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As ta=\r\nlon flew up, he quickly caught up with Legacy, who was himself\n&gt; &gt; flying m=\r\nuch slower as he was carrying Rodimus.
