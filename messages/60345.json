The sun light beamed through him shedding a rainbow over the bots body. Transforming into his robot mode he extended his hand. &quot;My name is cryaltron...may i ask where are we and what is going on? Ive seen many planets but none such as this.&quot;\n&gt; BlackFang:\n&gt; \n&gt; BlackFang arrived at apoint and checked his comlink, it seems that \n&gt; the unknow maximal was close ; he looked around and waited.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Cryaltron continued to fly but shifted towards the transmissions \n&gt; origin hoping to emet the bot half way there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackFang:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackFang opened quickly his comlink and said &quot;Hold on I&#39;m on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickly he left the base and started to ran towards Cryaltron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  A Pod crashed through the white clouds of earth. Like a \n&gt; meteor it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; screamed across the sky. The maximal protoform inside \n&gt; instinctivly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to salvage the ship. With little sucsess it crashed into a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed through \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a \n&gt; translucent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at \n&gt; work, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever seen. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he broke \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed spark. \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, as \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; same. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the spark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; encased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so \n&gt; slighty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an voice \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron \n&gt; snarled, &quot;Slag \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode. The sun shined through \n&gt; him \n&gt; &gt; &gt; like a plate of glass...like he wasn&#39;t even there only leaving a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rainbow under him as his trail. &quot;Any maximal in rage please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; respond.&quot; He flew off blasting his thrusters as well trying to \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as far away from the  murderous energon as he could.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
