She didn&#39;t want to see Vulios.  She \ncouldn&#39;t bring herself to see him and have him not forgive her. She was \nstarting to cry and she didn&#39;t want CyberShark to see her being weak. She \ntried her best to out fly him, but she knkew that his flying speed was \nfaster than hers. Still she flew upward.  She flew through a cloud bank.  \nShe knew he was near, but she didn&#39;t want him to she face.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
