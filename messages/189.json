She judged it&#39;s weight and height as she kicked \nher legs up and fastened them into the structure of the carnivour, it was an \ninch taller then she was but only a few ounces heavier.\nShe dug her front claws into the back of the raptor&#39;s head and clung on with \nboth front and back.\nCarnage ripped and tore into the hide of her attacker, feeling a jolt \nthrough her claws as she racked over an occasional structure beam.\nNO ONE TOOK HER BY SURPRISE AND GOT AWAY WITH IT!!!!!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
