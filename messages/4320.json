She looked at the deep \ntunnle Inferno was digging. At the sound of gun fire he poped up and demanded \nto know what to do. She looked at him and with the snap of her leg sent him \nfalling down. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Keep digging! Rampage, get down there!\n\n::: Rampage, brooding and hostile lept into the hole, and then the Fembot \ntook one last look at Cyber claw and felt a twinge of sadness for her. Black \nAracnia then lept into the hole. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Inferno ::: How dare you throw me down! The Royalty shall be disple-\n\n::: Black Aracnia, holding a flash light ::: Can it! We need to get into the \nMaximal H.Q. now! Rampage, at the end of the shaft is bedrock, through the \nbedrock is the hull of the Maxi&#39;s headquarters. Destroy that wall and were in!\n\n:: Rampage transformed into his tank mode. With the snapp hiss he sent three \nlarge missles zooming into the rock wall and it exploded with a mindnumbing \nbang. Smoke filled the shaft. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Now, move! Go Go Go!\n\n::: The three Predacons advanced and entered the smoking remains of what \nappeared to be a supply closet. :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: Trapped! We have failed!\n\n::: Rampage ::: Wheres the door?\n\n:::: Balck Aracnia ::: Both of you get off of me!\n\n::: Inferno ::: I have failed the Queen!\n\n::: With a screach, the door fell and Rampage moved out first, into the \ncorridor of the Maximal fortress. :::\n\n"}}
