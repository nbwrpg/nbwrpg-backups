He was ashamed \nof the way he&#39;d spoken to Ramulus. He wasn&#39;t sorry for what he said. \nHe was sorry that he&#39;d said it in front of at least three other \nMaximals. A subordinate should never upstage a member of command in \nfront of the troops, especially after a battle. Those actions could \nlead to low morale and defeat. With the future at stake defeat was \nnot an option.\n\nHe hoped that Shadow Wings sensors would malfunction so she wouldn&#39;t \nfind him. The possibility was doubtful at best.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She wandered into the eingine room.  She looked at all the damage \n&gt; that the ship has sustained.  She shook her head.  She wondered how \n&gt; they would ever manage to repair this much damage to the once great \n&gt; ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned the corner and saw Lunarpine laying on the floor all \n&gt; curled up.  He looked like he was lost in thought.  She stood there \na \n&gt; moment looking at him.  She always thought of him a majestic and \n&gt; regal creature.  She smiled while looking at him.  No matter what, \n&gt; she always felt safe with him.  Even when they sparred or just \n&gt; talked. She loved being around him.  She found that she couldn&#39;t \nhelp \n&gt; herself but care for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him and noticed something else.  She thought he \nlooked \n&gt; lonely.  Not for friends or anything, but the companionship of \nanther \n&gt; wolf.  She knew how he felt.  She too missed the commpany of other \n&gt; owls.  \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned and walked away.  She hoped that he had not noticed \nher.  \n&gt; She wanted to help him. She looked down at her body and thought a \n&gt; moment. Then a huge smile appeared on her face.\n&gt; She ran down the hall and into the repair bay.  If her landing pod \n&gt; could change her form into an owl, why not into a wolf.  She about \n&gt; the repair bay looking for an old pod with a form scanner still in \n&gt; operational order.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine curled up in the engine room, The Arks frame full of \n&gt; holes \n&gt; &gt; there too, much like the rest of the ship. He didn&#39;t know how the \n&gt; &gt; Maximals would set the timeline straight, but everything must \nhave \n&gt; &gt; turned out right, he still existed. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was later in the day, the sun wasn&#39;t beating down as much. He \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; lonely. A lone wolf in a pack, a duck without a flocking group to \n&gt; &gt; join. (It&#39;s a comparison, he didn&#39;t accualy turn into a duck.) He \n&gt; &gt; remembered his first day as a wolf, the pack recognized him as \n&gt; alien \n&gt; &gt; to thier group and chased him off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Theres gotta be others&quot; he said out loud to himself remembering \n&gt; &gt; Striker. If Striker existed then why not other wolves? If not for \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; pledge of loyalty as it was, to Ramulus he&#39;d set out right now to \n&gt; &gt; find his answers. Duty came first, before friendship, before \n&gt; &gt; information, even before his own personal feelings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She stepped out of the chamber.
