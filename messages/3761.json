Quickstrike crawled out of \nthe CR chamber and looked over his claws. Twice in one day wasn&#39;t his idea \nof getting around. He looked up to see Mantella. He narrowed his eyes at \nher, and said, &quot;That&#39;s none of yer business!&quot; He snapped his claws at her to \nback her up.\n\nHe transformed to his robot mode and walked out of the room. He paused, \nglaring at the room where they were holding Dark Mouse. Why should he care \nanymore? The Predacons---Megatron&#39;s Predacons had her. He could ask her \nlater. He walked away, down the corridor. He went the direction where Black \nArachnia had gone before he had been shot to slag eariler. He thought he \ncould make up with her. He wanted to talk to her, but Dark Mouse overrided \nhim logic circits.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
