What I am going to do\nis this. Go ahead and do what you will with the provisions you are\nhaving Tuscon hand out now.\n\nBUT!\n\nFrom this point foward, unless your character&#39;s function involves\ntransport, and when I say function, I mean the part of your bio that\nlists function, then your subspace pocket is just that - a pocket. It\nis basically the size of a transformer sized gym bag. You can carry\nyour weapons, maybe a padd or two, A book and a few small odds and\nends. But things should be related to your actual function in one way\nor another. IE: A medic could pull out medical supplies, a mechanic\nwould have tools, a thief would have lock picks ect. However a thief\nshould not be pulling out specialized mechanics tools that used to\nbelong to wheeljack 2 centuries that he preserved for just such an\noccasion, unless it has been stated in advance.\n\nThe sub space pocket is NOT suppose to be this huge area that you can\ncarry everything, and like a ladies big tote bag that carries\neverything but the kitchen sink :)\n\nWhat this does is it keep the characters interacting. The characters\nare suppose to need each other and depend on each other. or at least\nRP together to get what they need. And it is unfair that one character\ncan pull from subspace whatever is needed withou ever stating they\npacked it there and having no reason for it being there except that\nthey need it now. It short circuits the play.\n\nTo use an example if you have a sniper running for his life and he all\nof a sudden starts pulling out grenades and bombs and such, then what\nis the use for the person who&#39;s function is bomber? And why would a\nsniper have such things, since his fuction involves long ranged\nattacks? Now if the character were to state, and I pick up a few\ngrenades just in case, then it would make sens.\n\nDoes this make sense, can you see what I am aiming at?\n\nSo again, please feel free to hand out supplies as you need, this is\nwhat i am going with from this point foward.\n\nI hope I make sense, cause I am typing this out fast so I can get some diner.\n\nTTYL\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 8/11/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Actually, Tucson is distributing an emergency supply for now but they will\n&gt; need more.  By the way, Straight Shot is finding a new friend among the\n&gt; enemy.  Waspinator is the only bot comparable to her size, since she is a\n&gt; bit smaller than him.  Sort of like Silverbolt and Black Arachnia. They\n&gt; became lovers.  This time, Straight Shot is finding out that Waspinator is a\n&gt; great bot to talk to.  She hopes to keep the friendship a secret from\n&gt; Rodimus and Leo but they may find out eventually.  Which makes for a nice\n&gt; side story.\n\n"}}
