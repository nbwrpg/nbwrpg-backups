Still in the ventilation system, he kept crawling around.  Soon, he would have to bust out, and try to escape the Dark Avian.  Alive.  He continued crawling cautiously, trying to keep his stealth up.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Slaughter had heard more Decepticons come back.  This was excellent!  Yet, very dangerous.  Slaughter licked his lips, if he had any, with his big, long, slimy tongue.  Slime and saliva dripped from it, as well as just slime dripping from his whole body.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;I&#39;M HUNGRY!!  RAAH!&quot; Slaughter yelled in rage, snapping his pincirs a couple times.\n&gt; \n&gt;         The tall, freak mutant paced his way quickly around the Decepticon base(inside), looking for something to eat(in other words, something to kill).\n\n\n"}}
