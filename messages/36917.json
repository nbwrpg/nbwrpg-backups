I&#39;m not the commander here. Second, we did not get mopped. The CF has been through more battles than you can possibly imagine, and its a miracle it even held as long as it has.&quot;\n\nHe glances over at the rest of the Maximals, pausing on Klant and Torca. &quot;With every other faction on the planet fighting against us, its a bit hard to survive, but we&#39;re holding on. Iron Raptor is trying to change that, and is succeeding. But if you don&#39;t believe we can change, then go ahead and give up.&quot;\n\nWith a final growl, he turns around. &quot;And you call yourselves Maximals.&quot;\n\nIt wasn&#39;t in Prowl&#39;s character to get pissed off like that, but Iron Raptor had affected him more than he knew. He makes a mental note to learn how to control this new temper in the future as he walks back toward Maximal City.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Cliffjumper gritted his teeth. &quot;Don&#39;t you talk to me like that. You may\n&gt; have the name of Prowl, but you acted nothing like him on the battle\n&gt; field.&quot; Cliffjumper said accusingly. His eyes widdened with rage. &quot;I&#39;ve\n&gt; been around enough to know what will, and won&#39;t work, and you my friend\n&gt; don&#39;t work. You proved it with how you led the battle, and the maximals\n&gt; got mopped. Then you even helped nail some of your own, by letting the\n&gt; auto cannons fire, and other blunders like that. I don&#39;t believe you\n&gt; guys can change.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firedrill looked on, pain in his eyes. He couldnt stand to see this kind\n&gt; of thing, and was torn between a mentor, and a new friend.\n\n\n"}}
