He uses his current state=\r\n to his advantage, and screches his rubber on his tires, pivoting them quic=\r\nkly to maneuver away from the blasts. He had no sonar senses to guide him b=\r\nut he had his audo sensors and his sense of feel and touch, guiding him. Th=\r\ne system that Rat Trap was now holding merely augments his audio sensors an=\r\nd even though he could have used the device, he was now quickly getting use=\r\nd to not having it on him. And now, he could feel Rodimus&#39;s energy signatur=\r\ne. But first he had to get rid of Scorponok and Dark Hawk. He knew he did n=\r\not have enough energon in his main power core, but he did have a reserve st=\r\nash in his backup battery. He calculated that since he had hardly touched t=\r\nhis backup, it had close to ninety five percent capacity, yet it had to be =\r\nused sparingly. This meant deciding between vehicle and robot mode. He make=\r\ns a quick anaylasis of his systems.. Which would be able to concerve more? =\r\nVehicle or robot mode? \n&gt; \n&gt; The truth was, they were equal in ussage. But =\r\nhe knew he had to stick to vehicle mode, to make for a fast getaway if he d=\r\nid indeed find a way out of there.. Meanwhile, hidden not too far now, from=\r\n the torture chamber, Rat Trap who has made his way into a vent hole, right=\r\n over the chamber, spots Tucson. He then finds another bundle of wires and =\r\nfinds readable tags on them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s wheels, he&#39;s up&#39;n runn&#39;n.. Must be =\r\non a backup battery... That might last a few hours but that&#39;s about it. Oka=\r\ny, time for this rat ta be his rattiest!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He finds a tag that leads t=\r\no the chamber, and begins to knaw at the wires that are connected to it. He=\r\n snaps them readilly with his strong, buck teeth. The doors suddenly open i=\r\nn the torture chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHEELS, BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson could hear R=\r\nat Trap&#39;s voice and without questioning him, he spins his rear tires, creat=\r\nes a smoke screen and senses the wind coming in from the open doors. He tak=\r\nes this opportunity to get past Scorponok, via creating a low lying smoke c=\r\nloud, cloaking his chassse, and manges to get outside the chamber, stopping=\r\n in front of Rodimus. Rat Trap continues to knaw at wires, hoping that one =\r\nof them was another wire that would disable the security and weaponry syste=\r\nms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside, Tucson transforms into robot mode and in front of Rodimus=\r\n. This was it,he was face to face with his former leader.

Yet, the body of Optimus Prime holds his attention for a =\r\nmoment as he looks up to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wow, you must&#39;ve been one heck of a lea=\r\nder in your days. Rat Trap says he&#39;s with someone who&#39;s related to you. I w=\r\nish I could do something ta help you guys get back on your wheels, but I&#39;m =\r\njust a Maximal and I really don&#39;t know how to bring your men back ta life..=\r\n. That Autobot out there could sure use your help, looks like that Rodimus =\r\nguy really let you down and gave into those Predacons. I really can&#39;t judge=\r\n the guy because I wasn&#39;t there when it happened, but from what Rat Trap sa=\r\nys, I - dunno if I could ever respect a leader who weakens under pressure. =\r\nOkay, I gotta go, Lord Elder needs my help.

I AIN&#39;T GONNA ABANDON YA WHEELS, \nYOU DIDN&#39;T ABANDON ME SO IT&#39;=\r\nS HIGH TIME I RETURN THE FAVOR!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He didn&#39;t \nknow how to react. Rat T=\r\nrap may be small but his heart was definitely in the \nright place. If anyth=\r\ning was going to help the both of them, it was this newly \nfound friendship=\r\n that they developed in just a short amount of time. He gently \nputs a hand=\r\n on Rat Trap&#39;s head, and gives it a gentile rub.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Guess \nthere&#39;s no=\r\n changing your mind is there?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap smiles up to \nhim.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;W=\r\ne&#39;re in this tagether Wheels.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson&#39;s expression changes \nas he n=\r\now turns his attention to Rodimus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; You mock us because you think \n=\r\nwe&#39;re inferior. I beg to differ with you Rodimus. Because if you were as st=\r\nrong \nas you claim to be, you would not have fallen into such treachery. Th=\r\nere&#39;s \nsomething about this room you remember, it will always haunt you and=\r\n not because \nof the pain it may have caused, but the guilt you will always=\r\n feel, knowing that \nyou did not have the will to fend off your enemy when =\r\nthey overtook you. I did \nlook up to you at one time, I thought you were st=\r\nrong, resistant, and noble. My \nviews have all been altered now. I do not k=\r\nnow what happened, perhaps one day I \nwill understand, but now, I see the t=\r\nruth. Truth is, you don&#39;t want to be \nhelped, and you have turned your back=\r\n on your faction. Truth is, the only true \nleader of the Autobots was Optim=\r\nus Prime. I&#39;d do anything to see him back online \nonce again. You are not m=\r\ny leader anymore and you do not intimidate me. If I \nfall I fall, but at le=\r\nast I know I did my best to honor Optimus Prime as he \nwould have wanted me=\r\n to. No scrappling would ever have pledged his loyalty as \nRat Trap has tod=\r\nay. His heart is there, and it&#39;s more than I can say for \nyou.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat =\r\nTrap freezes for a moment. He had not expected Tucson to say \nwhat he said.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Wow, wheels ya really mean that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson \nnodds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;I =\r\ndo.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His expression turns stone cold.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I intend \nto finish w=\r\nhat I started, I will finish my mission, but after that, do not \nexpect me =\r\nto have the same amount of respect for you when this is all over \nRodimus. =\r\nBut now, is not the time for that. I see that what I accomplished was \njust=\r\n the first phase. I&#39;ve accomplished that thus far. I&#39;ve learned for myself =\r\n\nwhat needs to be done, and what needs to be done can&#39;t be completed today.=\r\n That \nwill have to wait.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap looks up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Wheels we gott=\r\na \nmove.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson listens to Rat Trap and transforms in front of Rodi=\r\nmus. He \nopens his driver&#39;s side door and lets him in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I believe t=\r\nhis is where \nyou step asside Rodimus, and let us pass.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He exclaims=\r\n while shotting at \na few more droids.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbw=\r\nrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, \n&lt;airly2002@.&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Perceptor/DarkHawk/&lt;WBR&gt;swarm \nbots:&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Perceptor Started to track furios the maximals and \nAutobot&#39;s si=\r\ngnature while the inner defences started to pop out and opening fire \nagain=\r\nst Tucson.

He uses his cu=\r\nrrent state to his advantage, and \nscreches his rubber on his tires, pivoti=\r\nng them quickly to maneuver away from \nthe blasts. He had no sonar senses t=\r\no guide him but he had his audo sensors and \nhis sense of feel and touch, g=\r\nuiding him. The system that Rat Trap was now \nholding merely augments his a=\r\nudio sensors and even though he could have used the \ndevice, he was now qui=\r\nckly getting used to not having it on him. And now, he \ncould feel Rodimus&#39;=\r\ns energy signature. But first he had to get rid of Scorponok \nand Dark Hawk=\r\n. He knew he did not have enough energon in his main power core, \nbut he di=\r\nd have a reserve stash in his backup battery. He calculated that since \nhe =\r\nhad hardly touched this backup, it had close to ninety five percent capacit=\r\ny, \nyet it had to be used sparingly. This meant deciding between vehicle an=\r\nd robot \nmode. He makes a quick anaylasis of his systems.. Which would be a=\r\nble to \nconcerve more? Vehicle or robot mode? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The truth w=\r\nas, they were \nequal in ussage. But he knew he had to stick to vehicle mode=\r\n, to make for a fast \ngetaway if he did indeed find a way out of there.. Me=\r\nanwhile, hidden not too far \nnow, from the torture chamber, Rat Trap who ha=\r\ns made his way into a vent hole, \nright over the chamber, spots Tucson. He =\r\nthen finds another bundle of wires and \nfinds readable tags on them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;It&#39;s wheels, he&#39;s up&#39;n runn&#39;n.. \nMust be on a backup battery...=\r\n That might last a few hours but that&#39;s about it. \nOkay, time for this rat =\r\nta be his rattiest!&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He finds a tag \nthat leads to the ch=\r\namber, and begins to knaw at the wires that are connected to \nit. He snaps =\r\nthem readilly with his strong, buck teeth. The doors suddenly open \nin the =\r\ntorture chamber.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;WHEELS, BURN RUBBER!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\nTucson could hear Rat Trap&#39;s voice and without questioning him, he spins hi=\r\ns \nrear tires, creates a smoke screen and senses the wind coming in from th=\r\ne open \ndoors. He takes this opportunity to get past Scorponok, via creatin=\r\ng a low lying \nsmoke cloud, cloaking his chassse, and manges to get outside=\r\n the chamber, \nstopping in front of Rodimus. Rat Trap continues to knaw at =\r\nwires, hoping that \none of them was another wire that would disable the sec=\r\nurity and weaponry \nsystems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Outside, Tucson transforms in=\r\nto robot mode and in \nfront of Rodimus. This was it,he was face to face wit=\r\nh his former leader. Rat \nTrap positions himself inside, at a peek hole, to=\r\n watch what&#39;s \nhappening.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, you wont&#39; believe t=\r\nhis, but, Tucson got \nouta there, and he&#39;s face ta face with Rodimus. I sur=\r\ne hope he gives &#39;em his \ncome uppn&#39;s. Lousey worthless piece of Scrap.. I h=\r\nope wheels drives you to the \nground&#39;n then some... &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At t=\r\nhe Ark and shuttle area...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quickstride looks around and f=\r\nocuses on the shuttle. Yet, the body of \nOptimus Prime holds his attention =\r\nfor a moment as he looks up to him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Wow, you must&#39;ve bee=\r\nn one heck of a leader in your days. Rat Trap says \nhe&#39;s with someone who&#39;s=\r\n related to you. I wish I could do something ta help you \nguys get back on =\r\nyour wheels, but I&#39;m just a Maximal and I really don&#39;t know how \nto bring y=\r\nour men back ta life... That Autobot out there could sure use your \nhelp, l=\r\nooks like that Rodimus guy really let you down and gave into those \nPredaco=\r\nns. I really can&#39;t judge the guy because I wasn&#39;t there when it happened, \n=\r\nbut from what Rat Trap says, I - dunno if I could ever respect a leader who=\r\n \nweakens under pressure. Okay, I gotta go, Lord Elder needs my help. Rest =\r\nin \npeace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He salutes the still form of Optimus Prime and =\r\ngets to \nthe shuttle. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;ve reached the shutt=\r\nle and I&#39;m now \nperforming preliminary take off proceedures.&lt;WBR&gt;&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogr=\r\noups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Preston \nCarroll &lt;supercyclonus@&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus had \nbeen standing just outside the torture c=\r\nhamber not sure if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he \nwanted to actually enter it. there was =\r\nsomething about this room&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nthat gave him the chills, especiall=\r\ny when he didn&#39;t need to go in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nthere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Instead he just stood in the shadows, \nlistening the words of the&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; others like Darkhawk, Scorponok and that \nAutobot Tuscon. there was=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something about that Autobot that seemed \nto grate on his ner=\r\nves.
