From here it is easy for\n&gt; Hy=\r\ndras to see that although Myrmidon may resemble an\n&gt; eagle, at close range =\r\nthe mechanical nature of his\n&gt; form is noticable. However despite what opti=\r\nc sensors\n&gt; may say, standard and long range sensors continue to\n&gt; pick him=\r\n up as a standard eagle of large size.\n&gt; Myrmidon flaps after Hydras, even =\r\nthough the booster\n&gt; pack on his back gives evidence of probrably greater\n&gt;=\r\n possible speeds if he chose to use them. \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Myrmidon resembles rea=\r\nl animals perhaps a little\n&gt; better then the G1 Predacons did, and in fact =\r\nhe looks\n&gt; much like them. (It almost looks as if he was made -\n&gt; at least =\r\npartially - in thier image.) His Eagle, Bull\n&gt; and Lion modes are much like=\r\n Divebomb, Tantrum (Minus\n&gt; the tanks) and Razorclaw, and his robot mode is=\r\n\n&gt; something like Predaking, although modified slightly\n&gt; and scaled down t=\r\no size. While in animal forms he\n&gt; &#39;appears&#39; to sensors to be just an anima=\r\nl of that\n&gt; type, although anyone getting a close enough look\n&gt; could obvio=\r\nusly see the difference. \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n_=\r\n____________________________________________________________________\n______=\r\n_________\n&gt; Catch up on fall&#39;s hot new shows on Yahoo!
