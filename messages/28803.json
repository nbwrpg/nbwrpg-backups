Dots that moved \nand made sounds, so were obviously alive and could be eated.\nHer stomach growled at that, remembering fool and eager to be full again.\nRage lifted her head from the sand and looked more closely at the dots, \nthinking she could build up speed and run them down when she ran down hill \nfrom the sand dune she was standing on.\nSwinging her tail she began to move slowly over the crest of the dune before \nher fet began to slide down and that triggered her to start running. Her \nhuge body lumbering and picking up spead as she tucked her arms under her \nchest and pumped her legs harder until she was moving at 20 mph.\nHer lips were parted as she ran, breathing through the spaces between her \nteeth, head pointed forward.\nShe was going to be able to eat tonight and she was looking forward to the \nblood, her huge form already closing in at half way to her targets.\n( Rion + Diana )\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
