Perhaps two individuals could fit in one chamber if that chamber =\r\nwere large enough.  As far as he knew, the last chamber he was in was large=\r\n enough to accommodate another mech, provided that his guest was not too la=\r\nrge.  In his case, Talon was just right.  He turns his head over to Stanton=\r\n and Quickstride with a gentile expression on his face.\n\n&quot; Thanks for the a=\r\nssist, I have Talon with me now, I&#39;ll be all right.&quot;\n\nQuickstride gathers h=\r\nis leaders intentions and steps back.\n\n&quot; Oh I see, sure, just be careful th=\r\ne rest of the way to CR.  And if you have any trouble, call us.   Well, Sta=\r\nnton, I think this is the part where we step back and allow our newest coup=\r\nle to have a little bit of alone time.  Rodimus and Nightlight aren&#39;t the o=\r\nnly ones who, you know..  Um yeah, I guess this means we could be seeing an=\r\n increase in members in the near future.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot catches up to Quic=\r\nkstride.\n\n&quot; C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go back, they need time ta themselves.&quot;\n\nSure enou=\r\ngh, Tucson escorts Talon into the CR chamber and feels his way to the large=\r\nst one, which he had used previously for his last session.  This time would=\r\n be more than just therapeutic.  With a feel of his hand over the control p=\r\nanel, he types in several codes that would allow for repairs and the presen=\r\nce of another individual at the same time.  \n\n&quot; I know you took quite a bit=\r\n of damage yourself.  I programmed the chamber to repair us both simultaneo=\r\nusly .  And that could take a while which will give us plenty of quality ti=\r\nme alone.&quot;\n\nAs his chamber opens, Tucson gently seats Talon down first and =\r\ntakes a seat next to her in a position where he could lay back and not harm=\r\n her in the process.  With a gentile coaxing he lays both Talon and himself=\r\n down on the comfortable repair bench.  There was just one minor formality.=\r\n  He had never invited a femme bot to partake in formal courtship, and had =\r\nno idea what it would entail.  With a playful look of bewilderment, Tucson =\r\ngives a light chuckle.\n\n&quot; I just realized something.  I have no idea what I=\r\n&#39;m doing.  I&#39;ve never engaged   in active courtship in my life.  You&#39;re the=\r\n first and only love I will ever have.  I may make a few mistakes so please=\r\n let me know if I do.&quot;\n\nThe door to the chamber closes and soon they are to=\r\ngether, alone at last.\n\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn =\r\nJul 24, 2011, at 3:54 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n\n&gt; Talon:\n&gt; \n&gt; Talon&#39;s face brighter and said soflty &quot;I want it&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n--Mensaje original----- \n&gt; From: Sandy\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, July 23, 2011 9:09=\r\n AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Changing times (Cue: All Ma=\r\nximals & Autobots)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson could sense Talon close to him and gives her=\r\n a heart felt smile and \n&gt; gently holds her hand.
