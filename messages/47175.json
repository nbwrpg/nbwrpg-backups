Since you have an email address (obviously), \nI&#39;m pretty sure you are capable of emailing privately, and thus \nnot &quot;be an ass&quot; over the group. =)\n\nThe council has long threatened to moderate people for posting too \nmany OOC&#39;s. We chose not to do that because it disrupts the flow of \nthe RPG. We&#39;ve been patient and lenient, but something needs to be \ndone. And something was done. You are entitled to your opinion, but \ngenerally speaking, why should we listen to you? You rarely post, \nand when you have posted, they were ooC&#39;s. In fact, only TWO POSTS \nof your last SEVENTEEN were IC. I&#39;d say that you are no more helping \nthe problem than Narrator was. Although I regret what I did, \nnecessity brings action.\n\nNow, as I mentioned, you have a private email and so do I. So, if \nyou wish to discuss whether what I did was correct or incorrect \nemail me. And DON&#39;T email the group. That&#39;s what the messageboard on \nthe website is for.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Really, rauq, you don&#39;t need to try and show off and be \nMr.&quot;I&#39;m a\n&gt; council member so I have to be an ass&quot; over the group.\n\n\n\n"}}
