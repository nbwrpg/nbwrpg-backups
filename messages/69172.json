Within a few moments a slow rumble could be \nheard\n&gt; as birds ros=\r\ne into the air and animals bellowed in fear as they \nreacted\n&gt; to sudden se=\r\nismic activity. The once calm, icy blue\n&gt; water water of the lake rippled a=\r\nnd then splashed as the activity\n&gt; became more forceful. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then with an=\r\n ugly hissing sound, smoke\n&gt; began billowing from the cave entrance that th=\r\ne minions had just \nexited\n&gt; from, the smell of sulfur filling the once pri=\r\nstine air. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yess,\n&gt; indeed.&quot; Marauder said softly as he watched the s=\r\nhow! Still in his\n&gt; starfighter mode he banked almost lazily away from the =\r\ndistant \nmountains as he activated his boosters. &quot;Come my minions! We will =\r\nsoon\n&gt; subjugate this ball of rock!&quot; Marauder said as he began to chuckle\n&gt;=\r\n lightly to himself. &quot;But first we will need an army!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He began\n&gt; to m=\r\nove off to the south, away from scene, away from the mountains, \nand\n&gt; onto=\r\n the new beginnings of the Minion menace on the Earth. \n&gt; \n&gt; Behind\n&gt; him m=\r\nagma began spewing out of the cave entrance as it fell steaming\n&gt; into the =\r\nwater below, looking like a molten water\n&gt; fall. White steam and vapors bil=\r\nlowed into the air as the water was \nquickly boiled away by the lava.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMarauder began to laugh as he picked up speed!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
