That would suck if we were, because we are\n&gt; better than the council.  And in a manner of\n&gt; speaking, we sort of are on the council, it&#39;s just\n&gt; that rAuq is too woman to admit he&#39;s part of the\n&gt; nWo.  And, about girls, I never thought girls were\n&gt; &quot;icky&quot;.  But I never had fantasies either.  Girls\n&gt; are girls, women are women, they don&#39;t mean a thing\n&gt; to me.  I don&#39;t want to share my life with ANYBODY,\n&gt; and I certainly don&#39;t want to share my future fame\n&gt; and fortune with anybody but my co-workers who will\n&gt; also be getting fame and fortune.  They know who\n&gt; they are.  In fact, some of my future co-workers are\n&gt; getting fame and fortune right now.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
