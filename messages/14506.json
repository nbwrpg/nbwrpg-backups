I hope Darkmouse and paralysis have gotten him.&quot;\n\n    Paralysis saw the battle outside, but easily made it into the cave with a \nlittle back door Darkmouse had informed him of earlier. The base was in \nshambles, soon there was going to be a cave it. \n He continued deeper into the cave when he heard Megatron and Waspinator \nyelling...\n    &quot;Get out there and defend the cave you insect!&quot; He bellowed, and \nWaspinator threw down his wepon.\n    &quot;No, Waspinator tir-&quot; Thats all he got to say because Megatron batted his \nhead off and then turned to the frog.\n    He glared, &quot;Aracnia sent you? Indeed....she should have come herself. No \nmatter. Soon you and everyone else on this planet will be dust, and I shall \nclaim triumph for the Decepticons once and for all! Yes!&quot;\n    Paralysis opened fire on the windbag, sending him flying into a dark \ncorner. &quot;You cant contact them with out a computer!&quot;\n    With that, he blew apart the computers in the room, bit by bit. Smoke \nfilled the area, and Paralysis realized that Megatron was gone. And then the \nfire eruppted.\n\n    Megatron took his chance, gathered up Waspinator and fled from the cave. \nIt would be gone soon....and now that he couldnt contact the Armada it was \nsure to leave. His minions, besides Waspinator, had grown quite bold and he \ncould do with out them. Besides, Kitkat was a far better leader.\n    Carrying Waspinator, he entered the swamps and ran as fast as he could. \nHe would have his revenge, One day.....\n\n    The Armada, with the link severed, began its return trip home. The vesske \nentered a warp corridor and vanished from view.\n\n"}}
