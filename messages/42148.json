The combatants could easily attempt to leave if \nthey wanted.\n\nOver the loudspeaker of this small arena, the official begins.  &quot;This match \nbetween Choran and Wolfgang is non-lethal.  The loser will be whoever yields \nfirst.  Begin the battle!&quot;\n\n(I&#39;ll take control of Wolfgang until War Barge returns)\n\n"}}
