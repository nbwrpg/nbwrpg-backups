Made true by transformer \n&gt; &gt; technology. I feed on energon, and need a fresh supply to keep me \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; working order. I don&#39;t know if pure energon will do, my creators \n&gt; &gt; never tested it on me, I was made to kill. Another thing about \n&gt; &gt; vampire&#39;s, they aren&#39;t alive, it&#39;s just a dead body. That&#39;s what \nI \n&gt; &gt; am, a dead body. I have no spark. Which is why I need Transformer \n&gt; &gt; juice to live. I hate it, I have never liked feeding on other \n&gt; &gt; Transformers, and I wish I could find a way to change me. Well, \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; it is, I&#39;ve never told anyone, and now I have. What do you think, \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote: ::Rodimus Prime:: He turns \nto \n&gt; &gt; the new arrivals. &quot;He is dead Condor, killed by the Predacon&#39;s. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; named me Commander.&quot; He then talks to Vampirtron, &quot;Welcome to the \n&gt; &gt; Maximals.
