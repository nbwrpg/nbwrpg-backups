Terrorsaur would be a good leader, but there was a \nproblem.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve got a conflict of interest here. Terrorsaur wants to go with \nthe Preds, but KitKat&#39;s last order was for us to go with the \nalliance. Personally I would choose the Alliance because of how they \nsaved us, but it is not my decision to make. So now what do we do? \nKet KitKat&#39;s last order stand or take Terrorsaur&#39;s first?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix pondered.\n\n&quot;Well......I think I can do it. It can&#39;t be so hard. Put you in \nstasis lock, open up your chest plate. Carefully remove your spark, \nremove Fliq&#39;s plate, and place it inside. Than your job would happen. \nWhen you&#39;re done take control of Fliq&#39;s body and tell me.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
