Wildfire made herself the \nshadows and the night, while Rowdy Wolf was spooky things. He fought \nback with mech fluid and violence, while she fought back with being a \nghost. \n\nShe kicked her hooves at the wolf&#39;s head, hearing the bark of a tree \nshatter. Pieces of bark went flying. She turned her body around, ears \npinned to her skull as she eyed the wolf down. Teeth flashed before \nher eyes. Mech fluid went flying from under her. Wildfire reared up, \nwhinnying in distress. \n\nShe cleared her mind within seconds, and when her hooves hit the \nground, she saw nothing wrong with her. The Vok wolf was playing \ngames. He learned hers. \n\nKill you, she said. She chased after him. Megatron and the others \ntook him lightly, and he was going to be proven danger.\n\n\n"}}
