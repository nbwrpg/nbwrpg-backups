The problem here is using a name that was \nin use\n&gt; already. For example what if someone wanted the name &quot;Black Zardus&quot; \n(ripping\n&gt; the japanese way of making sequel characters)... people would \nconfuse this\n&gt; new character with having some relation to &quot;Future Zardus&quot; and the \noriginal\n&gt; &quot;Zardus&quot; who were owned by one of the council members.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Hence to stop this confusion it&#39;s easier for a new player to just \nselect a\n&gt; different name. The problem arises however that there has been so \nmany bots\n&gt; on Earth (both currently in use and on the deceased/missing list) \nthat it&#39;s\n&gt; near impossible to generate an original &quot;transformer&quot; name.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 9:12 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: new trouble at the Chivtrons base\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My name is Kyle if another guy who happened to be named Kyle \nshowed\n&gt; &gt; up would you ban him because the name is taken?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dewboy, your &quot;oh so large&quot; mouth consider what it says, BEFORE \nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say anything.
