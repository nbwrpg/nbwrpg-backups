This wasn&#39;t getting anywhere. He leans \nforward again.\n\n&quot;I have a proposal for you,&quot; he says, taking another datapad and \nsliding it across the table toward Lady Hawk. &quot;The Destrons, allies \nof the Alliance, have sent me some information on technology that \nthey had developed to engeneer warriors. If you help me produce a \nsuccessful creation, working together with Squizzy possibly, I will \nlet you go. The datapad has some basic information on this.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk leaned back, sitting straight as if she were sitting in a \nthrone.\n&gt; &quot;I would do anything to protect that technology.&quot; Her royal stare \nmaking her\n&gt; eyes narrow,  &quot;Squizzy didn&#39;t understand the full potential of the\n&gt; technology, I couldn&#39;t afford to have her make a mistake and hurt \nus all.&quot;\n&gt; she shifted her gaze as Zardus gave instructions to Wheeljack, \nwatching the\n&gt; movements of the two bots carefully. &quot;I only seek science on this \nsorry\n&gt; ditball of a planet.&quot; The female bot used a monotone voice sounding\n&gt; uninterested in her science, and the planet where it was to be used.\n\n\n"}}
