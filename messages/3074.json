He feels lightheaded as his systems deal with \nthe depleted level of energy due to the repair.\n\nProwl leans sligtly away so that his optics could focus on Iron Raptor&#39;s \nface. His spark feels like bursting as he looks into her optics.\n\n&quot;Are you feeling better?&quot; He asks, concern and love mixed into his voice. The \nfact that he had accidently hurt her while kissing her was fresh on Prowl&#39;s \nmind, and it annoyed him greatly. He slides his hand on her side, making sure \nit was repaired.\n\n"}}
