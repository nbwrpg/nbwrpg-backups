He\nwas aiming his rifle at my head, thought Megatron, but with his energy\nlevels so low, it didnt matter if he died at the hands of an enemy robot,\nor enegron exaustion. This was his last chance, to survive. He forced\nhimself to his feet, every gear in him straining to support his weight,\nwhen his energon was so low. Ignoring his screaming computer warning\nsystems, he addressed the robot. &quot;I, huhhhhhhh, am Megatron, hhhh *cough\ncough*&quot;. He finished weakly, he then with all of his might raised his\nfusion cannon, to let the uknown robot get a good look at it, but he did\nnot aim it at Autofir, and even if he could aim it, he probably couldnt\neven fire a low powered blast anyways.\n\n\n\n"}}
