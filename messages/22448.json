The male bot \nwith wide optics suddenly stopped looking at her and turned his \nattention back to the one on the table. \n\nIt was a moment before he turned back to her. He wasn&#39;t saying \nanything to her. When she was about to say something, he spoke.\n\n&quot;Follow me.&quot; He picked up the dark armored bot on the table and \nwalked out. She gingerly followed, following him to someone&#39;s \nquarters. &quot;Wait out here,&quot; he said. \n\nHe left her by the frame of the door, in the hallway. He carried the \nspider bot to a bunk and layed her down. She wondered what was going \non. \n\nShe turned her head away and looked at herself in the reflection of \nthe metal wall. Her optics went wide. Her optics, and even body was \nmuch like the young male&#39;s. She studied her reflection, then his. She \nlooked back and forth. The spiderbot even reminded herself of her.\n\nShe lowered her brows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
