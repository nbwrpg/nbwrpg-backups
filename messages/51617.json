They don&#39;t really know you, so \nwhy would they make it personnal? The only thing anyone around here \ncan complain about is the posts you send.\nAlso, you should know that Rauq, Rudra and I are the three council \nmembers. We are here to enforce the rules and help people (even if \nsome think otherwise). When there is a problem case, we get forced to \nmoderate someone, and this means no posting for some time.\nRauq did send you a link to yahoogroups, but please also check \nwww.nbwrpg.com to check out the rules. If anything else, it&#39;ll help \nyou to role-play even better.\n\nFor everyone, please remember that this is a transformer rpg, not a \nreligious forum. I believe in my own way, but I respect what others \nbelieve. The point is that not everyone would like to hear about it.\nAnd please, if you have to tell something to someone, do so by private \nemail, even if it takes longer.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n"}}
