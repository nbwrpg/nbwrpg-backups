Anyway, Necromancer and Hell Drak were sent to\nEarth to fight alongside the maximals.  They looked around for two bots and\nthe scanners detected Dinobot and Tavatron close by, so they went to the\nlocation of Dinobot and tavatron and then Necromancer introduced himself\nand his sister.  Here&#39;s what Necromancer said to Dinobot and Tavatron:\n\n\t&quot;Don&#39;t pull out your weapons, we are not hostile bots.  My name is\nNecromancer, and this is my sister---&quot; Necromancer was interrupted by Hell\nDrak.\n\n\t&quot;The name&#39;s Hell Drak,&quot; she said.\n\n\tNecromancer continued, &quot;Anyway, we were sent to Earth to help you and the\nother Maximals.  Our scanners detected you two very close by so we decided\nto meet you.  The scanners say that you are Dinobot and you are Tavatron,\nam I correct?&quot; he asked, hoping that he and his sister could gain their\ntrust.\n\n\n"}}
