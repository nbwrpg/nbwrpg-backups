The other one begins heading toward it, but hits the bottom of \nthe CR chamber, making Reptilica trip out of the CR and fall on his \nface. He gets up, still a bit daze from the battle that had got him \nso much damage.\n\nHe looks around, seeing DevilDuer and a few other bots on one side of \nthe room. Walking to a console, he looks at it, seeing a pod ont he \nscanners.\n\n&quot;Hmmm...&quot; he says, walking out of the room and heading for the exit \nof the Alliance base.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blade Runner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; the signal got even more stronger. &quot;to anyone or anything this is \nBlade \n&gt; Runner my stasis pod is heavily damage I need help.&quot; the message \nkept on \n&gt; tansmitting over and over.\n\n\n"}}
