No \ndice, it&#39;s jammed.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; he grumbles, grabbing the emergency \nsurvival kit and stuffing it into the subspace compartment in his \nchest.  &quot;Better this hunk of junk than me!&quot;  Looking up, he targets \nhis twin shoulder turrets on the transparisteel panel above him and \nfires a pair of laser beams, shattering the canopy.\n\n&quot;Geronimoooooooooooo!&quot; he yells as he leaps from his burning shuttle \nand ignites his rocketpack.  The castaway gets clear just second \nbefore the ship&#39;s fuel supply ignites and detonates.  &quot;Whew!  Made \nit!&quot;  He spoke too soon, however, for as he descends into the lower \ntroposphere, a piece of half-molten metal from his craft strikes his \nrocketpack and burns a hole in it, sending him careening out of \ncontrol.\n\n&quot;YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!&quot;\n\n...\n\n\n"}}
