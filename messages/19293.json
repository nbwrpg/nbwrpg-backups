Nighteyes was there two, \nshe \n&gt; slipped inside in the confusion.  Shuffleing around he realized he \nhad been \n&gt; pulled into the ship. With a quick flick of his wrist he slide a \ndaggar out \n&gt; of his wrist and dug it deep into whoever was holding him.\n&gt;     &quot;AH, Starscream, alas Im sorry to have stabbed you but I have \nmy own \n&gt; agenda to execute. Good bye!&quot; He said, and fired two optic b;lasts \nat the \n&gt; bot, then running down the corridor insearch of what he needed.\n&gt;     Nighteyes looked at Starscream and then fired a missle after \nHell Beast. \n&gt; &quot;Starscream, are you ok? Dont worry, he wont last long in here!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron, now a safe distance from the autoguns thought the \nmessage over. \n&gt; And he agreed. A council was just the thing to end the MAximal \nreign of \n&gt; goodness. Predacon athorioty needed to be exercised.\n&gt;     &quot;Kitkat, Megatron here, I accept your offer....but, do return \nHell Beast. \n&gt; I would hate to have to destroy your ship to get him back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia, Rampage, Tankkor, and Paralysis made there way to the \nship. \n&gt; Aracnia looked around, &quot;Kitkat, were here.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
