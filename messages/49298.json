His livid \n&gt; expression resulted not only in the fact that he\n&gt; knew he would die, \n&gt; but on the disappointment of having killed no one\n&gt; before dying. Yet, \n&gt; he managed to take out his laser cannon and arm his\n&gt; multi-explosives. \n&gt; He unloaded everything he had at Shadow Star.\n&gt; \n&gt; While all this happens, Tyrael jumps swiftly\n&gt; upwards, avoiding the \n&gt; rocket and one of the blasts, but taking the last\n&gt; blast fully in the \n&gt; leg. He darted on the Predacon leader, shooting\n&gt; eigth shards at him \n&gt; and swooping with both talons directed at his\n&gt; enemy&#39;s massive chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: My place was granted to me as a reward for\n&gt; my competence! Not \n&gt; taken by giga-cycles of backstabbing! And besides,\n&gt; the very fact that \n&gt; you failed the first time you came to Earth proves\n&gt; that you are \n&gt; unworthy of leading anyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; A laser shot from his second in command told him he\n&gt; was not the only \n&gt; one to relish the glory of killing the renegade.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Shadow Star!

I managed to disarm it... the\n&gt; hard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way, and I&#39;m a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit damaged now.

There also appears\n&gt; to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writing on it, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly Vok, but I can&#39;t tell. There are also\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; &gt; small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; miscoloured squares in the center of three of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sides of it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He takes a look around the room, and spots three\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more sealed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; containers, identical to the one he&#39;d grabbed\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oddly shaped cube \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out of.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hold on, I&#39;m checking out three more containers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which are seemingly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; identical to the one which had this.. thing in\n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mumbles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Switchblade into the comm and he heads over to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next sealed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; container, his intrest smothering the pain of\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damages, and also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that Megatron was in the middle of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron.
