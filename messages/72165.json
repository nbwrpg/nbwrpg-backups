It was a way, to\n&gt; keep my processor off what hapepend each day.  And into each night, it would\n&gt; serve to give the others a fright.  It is what kept me strong, where I was\n&gt; when I didn&#39;t belong.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As the trio walked towards where UNUS was, WHEELIE tensed up again, but\n&gt; surreptisiously in the sense of any old veteran warrior scanning the area\n&gt; for a quick escape route if it was needed.  &quot;So, tell me about this UNUS.\n&gt; What has he or she done to give you such presence?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE glancing up at ASTRA and FIREHORN, &quot;So tell me, how you came to be?\n&gt; This world is strange, it is not quite home on the range.&quot;  Walking along to\n&gt; the door as he went silent upon noticing thier regalness, waiting for them\n&gt; to say he could enter.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from FIREHORN as he entered inside the door, the\nguards stepping back to let him pass. There was somehting ceremonial\nand even crisp in the movements.\n\nASTRA, noticing WHEELIE&#39;s hesitation, &quot;Unus will answer that\nquestion.&quot; she said as she gestured for him to come, her movments also\nbecoming a litle straighter and taller.\n\nOn the otherside of the door was a large chamber with other figures\nmoving about, all of them looking much like ASTRA and FIREHORN. They\nwere not quite clones, but they were variations on the same theme.\nSimilar colors, size and presumably abilities although there were\nslight differences for those who were observant enough to catch them.\n\nThe room itself was semiornate with precious gems of different sorts\nlining the walls, strange and exotic metals taking up the rest of it.\nPictures had been painted and placed in various places, and even\nornate flowers were allowed to grow around the room, the flowers\ncarefully placed to give the room an exotic look.\n\nThe intrior of the room was quite large with pillars placed\nstrategiaclly around the room, providing support for the stone ceiling\nof the room. There were no widows visible in the chamber although\nthere were doors leading to other parts of the structure.\n\nIn the center of the room was a figure who looked much like ASTRA and\nFIREHORN as well as the others in the room but he looked to be a\nlittle larger and massive as he sat on the throne that was positioned\nin the cetner of the room as well. He seemed to be listening to the\nreport of several figures before him.\n\n&quot;That is Unus.&quot; ASTRA said quietly as she directed her gaze to the\nfigure on the throne.\n\n(OOC: Assuming Wheelie enters the room)\n\nUNUS looked away from those who were talking to him as he spotted\nWHEELIE and gestured for him to come foward. &quot;Come come.&quot; he said\nencouragingly. The few other individuals who were milling about the\nroom stepping back so that Wheelie could venture foward to the throne\nif he chose. They all turned to look at him as if appraising him, as\nif they had not seen the one of his build and construction.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
