She smiled.  She was happy \nto see that he was alright. She stated to say somwthing when he \nhugged her.  She put her arms around him and hugged him back.  She \nwas enjoying his touch again.  She felt her spark race as he hugged \nher.  She had missed him and had been worried for him beyond \ncompare.  She whipsered to him,&quot;Glad to have you back.  You were \nmissed.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;            Dollen kept thinking about the crash, about GoldenEye, \nabout the\n&gt; Predacons.  Hmmmm.  Strange, he wasn&#39;t outside anymore.  Ah, yes.  \nHe knew\n&gt; where he was.  This was a CR Chamber.  He had been in one of these \nbefore.\n&gt; His body felt renewed, nothing ached, except his spark.  He wanted \nto see\n&gt; GoldenEye again.  He stepped out of the CR Chamber, looked, and saw\n&gt; GoldenEye.  He went up to GoldenEye, and hugged her.\n\n\n\n"}}
