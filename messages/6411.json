She knew that honey \ncan drip from a viper&#39;s tongue. She didn&#39;t trust him and her instinct \ntold her to leave this whole situation alone.  But she felt \ncommitted. She smiled to him, &quot;Thank you for the kind words Phobia.&quot; \nShe hoped this would give hima wrong impression about her and she \nmight be able to use this later on if the situation called for it.\n\nShe looked at the other two bots. She hoped that they were as wary of \nthis new bot as she was.  But then again, she didn&#39;t think so. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;My name is Phobia my dear, the scans I have are for the Maximals \nto \n&gt; view.&quot; He&#39;d already stated his name but figured the sight of a \n&gt; Predicon must have startled her. &quot;You are truly a beautiful \ncreature, \n&gt; a beast mode that seems to fit your beautiful spark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Complementing a Maximal put a bad taste in his mouth, he knew that \n&gt; these weren&#39;t friends, only temporary interests to get his job \ndone. \n&gt; One day they would be enemies again and he knew all to well not to \n&gt; make friends. One day he would have the order to delete them.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
