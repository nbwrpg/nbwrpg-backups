What are you doing here and \nhow did you know we needed parts like that? And most of all, How did \nyou know my name? Who are you?&quot; Now her voice had a hint of \nexcitement and curiosity. \n\n(Spears never made it to the pod with Ramulus. She had to go back to \nthe ark with Striker)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois pondered this. Could this bot help?

They didn&#39;t bother with introductions, they would come \n&gt; later. They ran right to Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq: Spears! I&#39;ve developped away for us to collect as much needed \n&gt; parts as possible. We can alter a pod and take it to the moon to \n&gt; collect wreckage from the ship we crashed on. It could make it \n&gt; completly re-built, except for the flying part. All we need is your \n&gt; go ahead, and we&#39;re set! What do you say?\n\n\n"}}
