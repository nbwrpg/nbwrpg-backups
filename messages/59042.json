Of course, this \n&gt; excludes December 17. So here comes the rest of the meteor charge. \n&gt; Remember that the minions are NPCs and are thus EXTREMELY \npowerful. \n&gt; However, they can be killed... theoretically... mwa hahahaha!\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Rockseeker was well protected by his rock hard shell. He was \nalmost \n&gt; oblivious to the shots that converged on him. However, His armor \nwas \n&gt; slowly blasting away, but he knew he could damage the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside, though, Yggdrasil Prime (remember him?) suddenly came out \nof \n&gt; CR and, through his various electronics, understood the situation. \n&gt; He rushed to the defense system and diverted all power to the \n&gt; shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rockseeker was only meters away when he was stopped by a massive \n&gt; energy surge as the shields came online. It caused him to yell in \n&gt; pain and to transform. He was thrown back in the battlefield.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade swooped down on that easy target. He breathed a jet of \n&gt; freezing air that covered and partly paralyzed the Minion. Still \n&gt; airbound, he swung his tail and sent him rolling.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: Kup! He&#39;s yours! I&#39;m going agaisnt that one!\n&gt; \n&gt; He took altitude and prepared for a gigantic duel...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: in the past couple Moves He and Rockseeker were getting \ninto \n&gt; it. He was on an intercepting course. They are battling infront of \n&gt; the Maximal base ams the Weapon he is using is a sword that has a \n&gt; Par, attack which renders the target parylized for a short period \nof \n&gt; time. See Ancient threw two daggers at Rockseeker and now is \nmoving \n&gt; to intercept rockseeker. Rockseeker was on a course as a meteor to \n&gt; the maximal base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:In a message dated 12/10/03 8:10:43 PM \n&gt; Central Standard Time, jeramej@y... writes:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ancient: Closes in on his target and Strikes with a parylizing \n&gt; Blow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Am I missing something there?
