He growls, diving quickly and firing at Arcangel.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Scavanger puts his hand up to protect his face as the flame hits \nhim,\n&gt; yelling\n&gt; &gt; in pain as the flame turns his skin black. He growls, firing back \nat\n&gt; &gt; Icedragon from his rifle.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Zardus flies up to the Alliance base, his head nearly getting \nblown off by\n&gt; &gt; flying debree from an autogun. He looks around, seeing Arcangel, \nIcedemon,\n&gt; &gt; Shocker, and Kamodia attacking the base. He looks down at his \nscanners,\n&gt; &gt; seeing the Alliance members dealing with some Maximals in the \ntorture\n&gt; &gt; chambers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Zergling, DevilDuer,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Get out here \nand help\n&gt; &gt; defend the base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that, he turns toward Kamodia, firing his plasma launcher at \nher.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; DevilDuer opens his eyes, looking down at himself. He wasn&#39;t in \ntoo good a\n&gt; &gt; shape, mechfluid leaking from his wounds and a headache in his \nhead. He\n&gt; &gt; growls as he hears Zardus&#39; transmission. Couldn&#39;t he get some \nrest?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DevilDuer gets to his feet, using a tree branch for support. He \nwalks out\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the forest and toward the Alliance base, firing at Shocker.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; &gt; Missing old school friends?
