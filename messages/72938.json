If there is a third assemblage of forces on\n&gt; this planet, with as extensive an army and a system as to set up this\n&gt; jamming zone, this underground facility, and also tracking us closely enough\n&gt; to capture our leaders, then for now they are a greater priority.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCRYOTEK nodded a frown on his face. CYCLONUS and SCOURGE were missing\nand HYDRAS had been taken, RODIMUS lost or at least seemingly so.\nThere was still no sign of any of them.\n\nAll of them knew most of the forces at play, well at least the big\nthree. The PREDACONS the MAXIMALS and the MINIONS OF UNICRON. However\nnow there seemed to be another force at work and that was this new\nenemy that they faced.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing then a moment, &quot;If the rodent remains with us, was he not a miner\n&gt; originally?  Perhpas he mgiht aid then in our explorations and digging.&quot;\n&gt; For had not his memory files given a vague recollection of Rattrap once\n&gt; stating he was the greatest miner in the Vega Cluster?\n\n&quot;Agreed.&quot; CRYOTEK said loking to see if he could spot RAT TRAP and\nQUICKSTRIDE the two annoying MAXIMALS who had been so silent, almost\ntoo silent the past few hours.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson lightens his expression but it soon turns to one of concern.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s all I wanted, thank you.  I&#39;ve made a misjudgement, I apologize for\n&gt; my assumption.   Yet I do believe we better be on guard as to how this rumor\n&gt; got started.  Leo, it could be possible that you have been cloned, and that\n&gt; clone could have started this.   It&#39;s only a guess, but it does fit from\n&gt; what you&#39;ve told me.  If Rodimus can be cloned, so can any of us.  Who\n&gt; knows, a black dragon could be out there tarnishing my reputation as we\n&gt; speak.  All right, I need to scan your systems and capture your schematics.\n&gt; Then I will attempt to seek out an outside match according to the intel I\n&gt; acquire from you.  I may not be blind but I still have my other senses that\n&gt; were there before I regained my sight.  It&#39;s a long shot but it should\n&gt; work.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME smiled as it seemed that finally TUCON was geting the point.\nThat is until he started talking about cloning and the need for a\nscan, and then a look of shock and even outrage was appearing on LEO\nPRIME&#39;s face. &quot;What you think that I was cloned? What, when?&quot;\n\nAs he talked there was a sudden commotion as the ground began to rumble . . .\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, DRILL BIT, and the others who had been hiding over\n&gt; underground trasnformed to robot mode and began racing forwards as fast as\n&gt; they could, without care for whom they might be trampling over in front of\n&gt; them!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gang way gang way gang way!&quot;  The group rushing forwards in disarray even\n&gt; as the cave seemed to be coming down about them!\n\nAs the cave in progressed large rocks and stone began to rain down on\nthe section of tunnel that the group was standing in. Tons of sand and\ndirt began to pour in quickly filling it. Any who did not quickly run\nfurther into the tunnel would quickly be caught in the wave of\ndestruction.\n\nNeedless to say CRYOTEK and PREDACON FUZORS were quick to make their get away.\n\nLEO PRIME looked around alarm registering on his face. &quot;Let&#39;s go\nMaximals!&quot; He cried out. &quot;Further into the tunnel!&quot;\n\n&quot;This could all be a trap&quot; WING CALIBER said as he dodge a rather\nlarge stone comming at him.\n\nLEO PRIME nodded as he also began running urging them forward, &quot;Yeah,\nbut at this point we have no choice.&quot;\n\nThe MAXIMAL FUZORS began to run forward as well. It was time to\nexercise the better part of valor and retreat.\n\nThe whole tunnel continued to rumble and shake dangerously!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
