We had to abandon the cave. They even \nwanted \n&gt; me to be leader. I did go to Black Arachnia&#39;s group. But I didn&#39;t \n&gt; last. I went off to find out what Megatron was up to. He had some \n&gt; kind of plan.&quot; He shrugged his wings. &quot;I didn&#39;t get much \ninformation \n&gt; that I wanted to. When I lost sight of Megatron, I left, and I \nthink \n&gt; I got frost bite on my wings on the way back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Big whoop,&quot; Quickstrike said sarcasticly. &quot;Coulda done better on \nthe \n&gt; spyin&#39; job.
