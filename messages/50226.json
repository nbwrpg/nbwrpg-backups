A spatial ripple streaks \nout from his chest towards its intended target.  (The subspace cannon \nis pretty much an impact-based weapon - if it connects, it knocks you \nflying.  Of course, if it DOESN&#39;T hit Talon, it&#39;s going to blast a \nvery large hole in the ground.)\n\nRiekan&#39;s attack is much more direct, dodging to one side so that \nSpike&#39;s ammo grazes his flank instead of swiss-cheesing his face.  He \nlaunches an explosive harpoon, with one of his fin-like boomerang \nblades following close behind.  (Whether he realizes it or not, \nSpike&#39;s going to have to deal with the latter coming AND going.)\n\nTorin doesn&#39;t attack at all, instead landing to check on his wounded \ncomrade.\n\nOOC: Ah, yes, the eternal paradox of the Rogues: ruthless and \ncompassionate at the same time.  I expect this will befuddle a number \nof characters as they try to pin some identifying mark on the \nstandard Rogue persona.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Spike rolled behind a large rock and transformed to robot mode and \n&gt; started to shot at the others that appeared out of nowhere using \nthe \n&gt; rock as a shield\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;well ss i suggest u get them out of here, we can&#39;t risk the slim \n&gt; chance they get captured&quot; talon said running towards spike firing \nice \n&gt; lasers trying to make a few ice transformers on a stick\n\n\n"}}
