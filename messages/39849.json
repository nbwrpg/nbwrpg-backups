Kyle, your post was, &#39;fraid to say, a large mode. *sigh* Now \nI&#39;ll list what you did wrong:\n\n1) Drones are not permitted to do battle or anything like that, \nbesides repairs at a base, and even then they are limited.\n\n2) Your pocket size drone is also illegal, it makes no sense at all.\n\n3) As Proto said, you can&#39;t control other people&#39;s bases, and that \nincludes the autoguns, shields, security systems, etc.\n\n4) There ARE bots in the Alliance base, and they&#39;d likely try to \nstop any intruders.\n\n5) If your cyber arrow can actually destroy a door, then it&#39;ll have to \nbe made illegal.\n\n6) A frequency jammer only prevents the bases scanners from \ndetecting an enemy signal, it doesn&#39;t prevent the cameras from \nseeing the bot, or anything else, depending on what the security \nsystems of the Iron Fist can do.\n\n7) You have done FAR too much in this post, as several people \nhave mentioned.\n\n\nI suggest that you re-read the rules, and consider all other RPers \nbefore posting something better suited for a story that you&#39;ve \nwritten. The council will dicuss this in more depth.\n\nYour post is officially illegal, and nobody has to post a response to \nit.\n\nHow long has it been since you played in the rpg? Your post \nsuggests that you&#39;ve been here before, and that your characters \nseem to have a strong dislike for the Alliance.\n\n\nOn 15 Jul 2001, at 16:07, Kyle Stewart wrote:\n\n&gt; I said check not check-mate so the &quot;Alliance&quot; can\n&gt; still try to stop the bomb.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
