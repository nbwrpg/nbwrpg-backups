He&#39;s not a moderator just so he\n&gt; can stand around \n&gt; &gt; and look pretty. Moderators are to be listened\n&gt; too, that way \n&gt; &gt; mistakes or misconceptions can be picked up and\n&gt; fixed before \n&gt; &gt; anything disasterous happens (we hope anyway). =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Whoah, way to point your finger in the wrong\n&gt; direction.  The only \n&gt; posts I made that had anything to do with the battle\n&gt; in the last \n&gt; couple of days were to clarify the weapon&#39;s\n&gt; function.  It&#39;s not like \n&gt; I kept shooting!  Jeez, just because you&#39;re a mod\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean you \n&gt; automatically know everything about a weapon someone\n&gt; else designed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not here to stand around and look pretty either.\n&gt;  If anyone needs \n&gt; an attitude change, it&#39;s the people who expect the\n&gt; new guy to not \n&gt; know shit about how RPGs work.  I&#39;ve had a ton of\n&gt; writing and \n&gt; roleplaying experience, thank you very much, and I\n&gt; know what I&#39;m \n&gt; doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; You ought to be a little more prepared for those who\n&gt; show up with a \n&gt; slew of ideas ready beforehand.  I&#39;m not saying all\n&gt; my ideas should \n&gt; go through, I&#39;m saying I have them ready for when\n&gt; there&#39;s an opening.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
