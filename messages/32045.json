All this OOC arguing reminded me that I have a message board\nready, made of pure and simple C++ (well, some C too, but I didn&#39;t\nwrite that part). Anyways, all I need now are some suggestions for the\ncoloring. THe colors I need are:\n\nPost background color 1 & 2.\nPost text color 1 & 2.\nWhat I should cover the walls of my room (that&#39;s the most crucial\none).\n\nAnyways, the post and text colors are like the ones on EZBoard and\nstuff. They alternate with every post in the topics. I think those are\nthe only ones I need. As soon as I get some suggestions, I&#39;ll put up\nthe message board, and then we can discuss Physics on that.\n\nPS. I just fixed my keyboard using nothing but a screwdriver and the\nsink, so it might not be working well. If there are any typos, its the\nsink&#39;s fault.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Enough with the OOC arguing.)\n\n\n"}}
