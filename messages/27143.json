He was a \nwalking pin cucjin, after all.\nBut she started to walk again as Rion got to his feet and started to walk \nalong with her, nudging him with her shoulder and looking at him to let him \nknow that she had seen his flying skills and wouldn&#39;t get away with showing \noff if he did it.\nShe wiggled her whiskers at him for a sec when he asked her to use her \nscanners, shrugging.*\n\n&quot; Yeah, I guess I could. But...I&#39;m kinda a beginner.&quot;\n\n* Diaia switched on her scanners, finding the program of them after \nsearching for a sec.\nShe hoped that she could just switch them on without searching, but she \nwould have to be more grown for that.\nIt wasn&#39;t long before there were a few blips on her screen, but they were \nVERY far away.\nDiana sighed.*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s lots of signatures...but they&#39;re ways away. Like...weeks away. And \ni don&#39;t think my comm-link is working. Hay! Let&#39;s run a ways. It could be \njust static ghosts.&quot;\n\n* Diana then went off at a sprint, her scanners getting fuzzy at every \nstep.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
