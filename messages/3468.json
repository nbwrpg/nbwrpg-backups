He gave a few quick glances at the other two \nbots in the room, Bazooka and Scorponok, then glanced back to Megatron, \nlooking him in the eyes. He crossed his arms over his chest. No. Trying to \nlook official, he put his long fingered hand on his hip. Better. At one \npoint he thought he was trying too hard, but he went on with it.\n\n&quot;Well, as ah was tryin&#39; to say, boss,&quot; he said. &quot;Ah got an idea. Ah sent two \nbots t&#39; go find uh stasis pod wit&#39; uh protoform an&#39; bring it back here \nb&#39;fore Hell Beast&#39;s troops sees it. What ah need t&#39; know boss, is do ya \nstill have them DNA from yer old troops.&quot; He sense of wonder came across \nQuickstrike, forcing him to turn his head. He made another glance at \nScorponok.\n\nWeren&#39;t you dead? he said to himself.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
