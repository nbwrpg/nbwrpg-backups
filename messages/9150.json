He \nglances at a screen as he takes his seat at the command chair, noting that \nthe defences were in bad shape. He frowns, looking at another screen.\n\nLeaning forward, the Alliance commander types a command on the console, \nreading flashing across the screen. It was a report of what the scanners had \npicked up from the Predacon attacks on the Cybertronian Fire. Zardus&#39; frown \ndeepens as he sees the readings from the attack. The Cybertronian Fire was a \nmighty ship, stronger than the Alliance base, there was no doubt of that. \nThey were also in a better position than the Alliance base.\n\nZardus activates his comm-link. He didn&#39;t like being in charge of a \nsecond-class base.\n\n&quot;All bots,&quot; he says into it, sending the transmission to all Alliance units, \n&quot;Return to base. There is some remodeling to be done.&quot;\n\nZardus pushes several more buttons, a view of the Alliance base and \nsurrounding area coming up on the screen.\n\n"}}
