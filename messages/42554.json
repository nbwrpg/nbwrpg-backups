If Ice hadn&#39;t stepped\n&gt; between them the blast would have hit him. He reached to draw his\n&gt; weapon when Ice rose her wings blocking his shot. &quot;Get down!,&quot; he\n&gt; yelled trying to take aim at the insane bot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;None of that in here.&quot; Ice yelled equally demanding, &quot;This is a\n&gt; place of peace and it&#39;ll stay that way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Grizzltron wasn&#39;t very happy that thier chat was inturupted. He\n&gt; fealt outnumbered and outgunned. His firepower was the only thing\n&gt; seperating him and the odds. Veratis wrapped his large bat wings\n&gt; around the bear bot and used his unseemingly strength to hold\n&gt; Grizzltrons arms at his sides. &quot;I already warned you once that that\n&gt; will not be permitted in my home.&quot; The old scientist bit down on the\n&gt; other bots shoulder draining enough energy to weaken him enough to\n&gt; force him into a CR chamber.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That should give him some time to cool down.&quot; Veratis says\n&gt; transforming back to his robot mode. &quot;Now then Mustex was it? Take\n&gt; Ice with you and bring your &quot;son&quot; to me and I&#39;ll take good care of\n&gt; him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ice didn&#39;t want to go that way, she wanted to return to Lunarpine\n&gt; and the others. She thought about thier times together and had to go\n&gt; with Mustex, She remembered all the times she&#39;d tried to help her\n&gt; love and ended up getting herself hurt and in one case nearly lost\n&gt; her spark. This time she&#39;d trust him to get the job done without\n&gt; worrying about her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
