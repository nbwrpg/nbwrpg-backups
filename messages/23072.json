Inside the three bots fratically \ntried to manuver the small ship into a safe position to land. They hurried \nto and fro. Trying despretly to find a safe place to crash if they couldn&#39;t \ncontrol the plumeting ship.*\n\n  Snow Tech mutters to all within muttering distance:\n&quot; Prepare for a crash landing ladies and gents. Please take the proper \nprocedures, make shure that you are succured properly, have all lose luggage \ntied down, then bend down and kiss your ass good-bye!&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat frowned towards her twin brother and smaked his arm.*\n\nShadow Cat:\n&quot; Don&#39;t be an ass Snow Tech, this is serious! Now find a clearing to crash \nin!&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech Doges the hit and smiles back at the teed off female bot, going \nto the screen, he quickly scans the local planet for a crash site.

The \nlight began to fall at greater speed, passing them with a sonic boom. The \ntwo little forest animals, being babies, where more curious than afraid by \nthis monstrous noise and flash. So, they walked towards the ship, following \nthier noses(Or beaks) in animal fashion.\nThey find a small ship in ruins, flashes and small explosions still kept the \ntwo from getting any closer. Suddenly, a yellow beam flashes outwards, \nscaring the two away, but not before they where anilized and fed into the \nships computer.*\n  * The pod door opens and a black leopard and a white leopard steps out \nfollowed by a small flying lynx with white wings.....*\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
