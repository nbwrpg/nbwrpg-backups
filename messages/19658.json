But then it hit her, like a thunderbolt to the spine!\nNo wonder this bot had so many lethal looking beast modes strewn al over his \nbody�he used them!\n\nZyber watched as the mouth to the cave was engulfed in fire, an entire \ncascade of rock sliding and collapsing in from the roof�to seal her inside \nwith this bot.\nThere were stretches of cave in there, but she had never explored it fully \nand knew no other way out. She was trapped!!\n\nSuddenly she snapped her head towards DeathScythe as he now aimed the weapon \ntowards her, the expression on his face telling her that no matter what she \ndid, he was going to get her in the end. But she still had a chance to get \naway, chance to go back into the cave and try to see if she could find \nanother way out! It was her only option, second to being blown to scrap.\n\nZyber backed up a few steps before she transformed into robot mode, knowing \nfull well that she had weapons but with her peaceful nature she usually \nrefused to use them. And she still did.\nIf worse came too worse she would use it, but she would find that opening \nfirst.\nShe quickly jumped to the left as DeathScythe fired at her, a shower of rock \npelting her as she took a few steps deeper into the cave.\nBut even as she looked up and into the eyes of the bot she had helped, a \nflood of fear and regret washed over her.\nThese just might be her last hours, and in truth she really didn�t want to \ndie.\nAnd she almost felt like kicking herself for being so nice all the time, \nnever even seeing that a bot like this could take her. But for what reason?\nZyber kept backing into the cave, always facing DeathScythe as she did so.*\n\n� W�why are you doing this?�\n\n* Her voice was a shutter, and after being surprised like this she knew that \nit had a right to be.\nDeath was standing right infant of her, and it�s name was DeachScythe.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
