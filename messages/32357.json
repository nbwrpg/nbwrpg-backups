I&#39;m very, very against \nracism.  I think its ugly, and if someone is going to harass someone just \nbecause they believe in a different religion or because their skin is a \ndifferent pigment than they&#39;ve got to be messed up.\n\nAnyway, over IM I told Dcoburn I was leaning towards atheism (the belief that \nthere is no God/gods) and gave him reasons.  Atheism doesn&#39;t mean I think \nreligion and everyone who is in it is bad.  Just means I don&#39;t believe in \ngods.  I don&#39;t necessarily think religion is good for society, but I don&#39;t \nthink of people who believe in a religion any less. Hey, my mom was a \nBuddhist and my dad is a Christian.  I even go to church on Sunday \noccasionally.  I usually even go to youth group on Mondays.  For the social \nreasons and because my dad wants me to and I respect his wishes.\n\nDcoburn, your comments about me being &quot;prejudice&quot; are very insulting and I \ndon&#39;t appreciate it.  I&#39;ve never insulted someone because of their religion \n(well, if you don&#39;t count satanic cults as a religion), or insulted someone \nbecause of the color of their skin or heritage.  And I never will.\n\n\n-Lord Unitron\n\n"}}
