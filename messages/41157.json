Further more did I say anything about disrupting \ntheir orbit. They can stay right there for as long time for all I \ncare. And it wouldn&#39;t be a battlecruiser becuse it CAN&#39;T MOVE. Not to \nmention for powers sake only a small part of the actual moon will \nprobably be used or they would&#39;t have the power to defend themselves.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Its big, its bigger then a battle cruiser, it wouldnt count as a BC \nsince its \n&gt; a moon and I believe that the moon s already taken as a base or a \nhide out. \n&gt; The ark is orbiting it is I recall correctly from the evens page.\n\n\n"}}
