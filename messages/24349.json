Her jaws snapping shut inches away from the bots face, \nthen yanking her shoulder free of the wicked blade.\nThe moved her body so that she could strike out again, bunching up her leg \nmuscles but remaining in her spot.**\n\n&quot; Bots have to eat too!&quot;\n\n** she roared, but then cocked her head to the side and looked at the bot \nagain, her shoulder burning.**\n\n&quot; Who are you? And what right do you have attacking me like that?&quot;\n\n** the pig at her feet twitched a bit, making sick liquid squeels.\nCarnage raised her hind leg and simply set it over the pigs throat, bringing \nher hind claw down quickly shutting it up.\nIf this bot left her alone then she just might get to kill the thing and end \nit&#39;s misserly. It wasn&#39;t right to let it suffer.\nBut...then Carnage remembered the boar by the tree that she still had to \nfinish, as well as the little headless pig to pick up.\nShe eyed the bot for a sec before before leaning down and collecting the sow \nin her mouth, the pig too big to simply pick up.\nBacking a step she growled towards the one who attacked her with the scyth, \nsinking her teeth into the sow a bit more.\nContinuing to move back towards the direction where the boar still lat \nsqueeling.**\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
