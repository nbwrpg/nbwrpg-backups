I was feeling really bad and couldn&#39;t wait to\nattack someone, and I should have kept my mouth shut about the spider\ncruelty thing. It may be a bit cruel, but it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s actually\nhurting spiders. (looks evilly and menacingly at Cyberwolf because of his\ncomment) Really, no matter what you kill in your posts you are going to\noffend someone. Probably unless it&#39;s a moquito or a cockroach, nobody likes\nthem for obvious reasons. It was a storyline thing, not a slaughter because\nof personal hatred towards spiders, so again, I say I should have kept my\nmouth shut. Sorry everyone, just the ill natured side of me was typing and\nwaiting to strike at someone to try and set his anger at ease. Should have\ntook my anger out on something else, I know, but I was rabid. Stupid me...\n\n\n"}}
