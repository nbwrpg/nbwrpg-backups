Its message booms in all of it so loud that every sleeping \nbot will be awakened. As Warhead hears it, he is filled with joy. \nCombat! After a year of drilling his team, they will finally get \ncombat!\n\nWarhead: HEAR THAT QUASACONS! WE WILL HAVE OUR TIME FOR BATTLE! WE \nSHALL FIGHT AND SLAUGHTER! Soon, we will depart for Earth and join the \nSadisticons. (He moves to the console near him) As soon as this \nslacker gets here...

We do not know what factions \n&gt; yet.  But we will and I mean Will attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    As UltraByte says these words the finally enter Earths \n&gt; Atmosphere.  Lobstruck, Lady Right, Lepord, Kan Kick, and Snake Eyes \n&gt; all listen attenitivly.  Lepord was getting a little impatiant.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &#39;I thought this speech would be all exciting and a box of \n&gt; Cybertron Gravy.&#39;  Lepord thought.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;We will land then blow up the engine.&quot;  UltraByte says.\n&gt; \n&gt;    With those words Lobstruck and Lady Right look up quickly in \n&gt; surprise.  &quot;What!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;I know you are all thinking I must be crazy but I know all of \nyou \n&gt; can defeat these bots.  We do not need to use the ship to blast \nthem, \n&gt; we can do it ourselves.&quot;  UltraByte says as he slams his fist down \non \n&gt; his chair.  That reminded UltraByte of the smudge earlier.  &quot;By the \n&gt; way, Lady Right, next time you clean my chair don&#39;t miss a spot.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lepord, Lobstruck, and Lady Right all enter the bridge(Hopefully \n&gt; &gt; followed by Void).  &quot;Okay UltraByte the Intruder is taken care \n&gt; of.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; Lobstruck says as he walks over to infront of the Big Chair of the \n&gt; &gt; bridge.
