However, \nthe tiny \n&gt; fur-=\r\nball was relitively new to her.\n&gt; Chuckling to herself as she sees Shadow C=\r\nat give her brother slag.\n&gt; They were bothing just like she remembered them=\r\n to be. Shadow Cat \nso serious \n&gt; at times and then have her own sense of h=\r\numor=85Snow Tech just \nseeming to be a \n&gt; walking joke.\n&gt; But when Shadow C=\r\nat turned to her she blushed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yeah, I guess I have.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Looking=\r\n at a whist of hair that fell over her eyes, simply moving \nit out \n&gt; of th=\r\ne way.\n&gt; Iron Raptor steps back though when the fembot moves towards her to=\r\n \ngive her \n&gt; a hug, never really seeming like one who liked them.\n&gt; In the=\r\n old days she had never liked sentimant, and now that she was \nwith \n&gt; Prow=\r\nl she really didn&#39;t think it was that bad. But she only didn&#39;t \nmind it \n&gt; =\r\nfrom him, everyone else=85she didn&#39;t think so. Then smiling while she \nfall=\r\ns \n&gt; and yells at her brother.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Hopeless.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She thinks to hers=\r\nelf.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t see Snow Tech get to his feet and dust himself on, \nlooki=\r\nng in \n&gt; surprise as he had grabbed her arm.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked at Snow T=\r\nech as if she thought he was crazy as \nhe spoke \n&gt; to Prowl, then her look =\r\nturned into a smile and she laughed at what \nhe said.\n&gt; This really WAS Sno=\r\nw Tech.\n&gt; She doesn&#39;t move to get her arm out of his grasp, knowing that he=\r\n \nwas simply \n&gt; joking around as usual.\n&gt; But then Iron Raptor&#39;s laugh dies=\r\n away to a chuckle and then \nnothing as she \n&gt; feels Prowls anger, simply l=\r\nooking at him in surprise as she feels \nthe anger \n&gt; coming from him. It ha=\r\ndn&#39;t numbed her like last time because she \nhadn&#39;t just \n&gt; come out of batt=\r\nle rage, it just come this time.\n&gt; But then Iron Raptor got a little edgy w=\r\nhen Prowl had taken a step \ntowards \n&gt; Snow Tech, wondering why he was acti=\r\nng to hostile to a silly joke.\n&gt; She saw him take out and point his wing mi=\r\nssiles towards Snow Tech, \nher \n&gt; expression turning angry as well but not =\r\nas enraged as Prowls.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; What do you think you&#39;re doing?&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; But then=\r\n Iron Raptor answers Prowls question.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; It&#39;s just a joke, love. He doe=\r\ns that all the time.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Her attention then caught by Snow Tech as he spe=\r\naks to her.\n&gt; But then as everything wore on she simply rolled her eyes and=\r\n shook \nher \n&gt; head.\n&gt; They were both turning out to be complete idiots=85.=\r\n\n&gt; Stepping out from between the shield that Snow Tech had just \nactivated =\r\nshe \n&gt; gave Prowl  look that said everything, he was acting just like a \nch=\r\nild along \n&gt; with her friend.\n&gt; Simply stepping off to the side and crossin=\r\ng her arms, looking at \nboth of \n&gt; them from under her bangs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Why do=\r\nn&#39;t you two just get into a pissing contest and get it over \nwith?&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bu=\r\nt she just stood there as Prowl simply walked over to her as if \nnothing \n&gt;=\r\n happened, sliding an arm around her.\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t impressed at all, by any=\r\n of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; I&#39;m waiting for my friends first, so we can get back to ba=\r\nse \ntogether.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor then looked towards Snow Tech, glad to at l=\r\neast have \nthe weapons \n&gt; put away and emotions not so powerful as before.*=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re going back to base now, Snow Tech, maybe Shadow Cat can fly \n=\r\nyou?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n_______________________________________________________________=\r\n_______\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
