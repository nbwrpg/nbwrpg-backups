Deep, in a restful sluber, she \ndreamed. There she stood in front of Tarantulas&#39; lair. The original aracnid \nthat made Megatron so angry. She went deeper and deeper into the cavern and \nthen saw him. He was in his transmetal form and looking over a few papers.\n    She turned to run away but was caught in a web. She turned and saw the \nface of Tarantulas right in front of her giving her a rashy laugh.\n    &quot;Witch! Did you think I was actually gone? Our mental link imprisoned me \ninto your subconscience while my clone was masquerading. Now that I have you \nin my little web...I will be restoring my body.&quot;\n    &quot;Your a psyco! My troops will find out!&quot; She screamed.\n    &quot;I think not. Im quite a good mimmick. Now rest. I will do the thinking \nfrom now on.&quot;\n    As he said that Aracnia felt herself slip away, and he body woke in the \ncontrol of Tarantulas.\n\n"}}
