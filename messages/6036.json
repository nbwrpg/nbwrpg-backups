I&#39;m not that bad. I just can&#39;t fly for a \nlittle while.  My wing will heal soon. Then I can fly. Just because \nI&#39;m grounded doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m totally helpless. Besides, why risk \nanother bot in this storm.  I can walk.&quot; The snow was easing up but \nthe lightening was more frequent now.  She started walking southward \nand headed for the base.  \nShe turned and looked at him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry that I am no fighter.  I&#39;m \nsorry that I was a dissapointment. But I can&#39;t go any furhter than \nwhat I was programmed to do. I Recon. And now I know that&#39;s all I&#39;ll \never be good for. If that even.&quot; She knew that he was a fighter and a \nsurviver. She knew he was more wolf than machine.  That he needed to \nbe with others of his own kind.  And she knew that she wasn&#39;t \nanything like him or what he needed a partner to be.  She turned and \nstarted walking again. She would be lucky to have him for a friend.  \nShe wanted to be better than she was.  And all she proved was that \nshe was less than what she thought she was originally.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; (This is for 5971 too)\n&gt; Lunarpine looked at her, she couldn&#39;t transform? things just kept \n&gt; getting better.(Sarcasm)\n&gt; &quot;How bad is it?&quot;Lunarpine asked with concern in his eyes. &quot;Can you \n&gt; still move yourself or do you need help?&quot;\n&gt; He wasn&#39;t disapointed at her for getting hurt, he was disapointed \nin \n&gt; her for running (Flying) away. He could tell this unit had no \n&gt; discipline, or order. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lunarpine to base, I found Shadow Wing, she&#39;s injured and we need \nan \n&gt; airlift home.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine now realized that this team wasn&#39;t a fighting unit but \nmore \n&gt; of a unit of friends trying to survive.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;OK Wing lets get walking, we&#39;ll meet our transportation half way.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
