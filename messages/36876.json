Ice transformed to her owl mode and perched at the\ntop of a nearby tree. &quot;It&#39;s been a while since the last time we were here\nhasn&#39;t it?&quot; she thinks remembering finding Lunarpine for the first time.\n\nLunarpine heard her thoughts and chuckled, &quot;Seems strange how we&#39;ve changed\nso much but this place hasn&#39;t.&quot; he remembered it like it was yesterday even\nthough it had been a year. This was one of the few places that hadn&#39;t been\ndisturbed by thier senseless war.\n\nIce flew low and aproached the cave, &quot;I&#39;m senseing something, he&#39;s in here.&quot;\nshe says landing near a mine.\n\n&quot;Ice get back&quot; The wolfbot warned to late as the first mine exploded sending\nher through the air to come crashing down at his feet. Lunarpine transformed\nto his half wolf mode and sniffed the ground, &quot;Theres more traps where that\ncame from, it seems that whoever we&#39;re tailing is expecting company.&quot;\n\nIce again transformed to her mutant robot form. A scanner rose from her\nwrist. &quot;I&#39;m getting Grizzly DNA, but it doesn&#39;t seem to match Rex. If the\nbot knows us we don&#39;t know it.&quot; She&#39;d learned her lesson, Lunarpines senses\nwere best suited for this neighborhood so she&#39;d let him lead.\n\n&quot;See if you can contact him telepathically&quot; the half wolf says as he tries\nto plan a way through the mines.\n\nIce opened her mind trying to locate Grizzltron, without him in her line of\nsight it proved difficult but not impossible. &quot;Can you hear me? You can come\nout, we&#39;re friends.&quot; she calls to the newcomer, Even though the two meant no\nharm they didn&#39;t know if the other bots intentions were the same.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Beast Wars &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 08, 2001 8:42 AM\nSubject: Re: Say Welcome to Grizzltron\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   Grizzltron notices on the scanner equipment he pulled from the pod that\nthere was to bots coming nearer to his postion.
