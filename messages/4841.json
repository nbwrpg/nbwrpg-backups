He was laughing at her and she knew it.  \nShe looked at Terrorsaur and back at Megatron.\nShe walked back to her computer and sat down and tried not to look at either \nof the two bots.  She realy wanted Scorponok there right then.  But this \ntime, she would have to fend for herself.\nShe looked at Megatron and said,\n&quot;Commander, if there is nothing else, I shall go to the lab and take care of \nthing.&quot;\nShe hoped Megatron would not command her to do anything and let her go to \nthe lab without hassel.\n\n\n\n\n--------Original Message---------\nFrom:   &lt;JP3884@a...&gt;\nDate: Mon Jun 26, 2000 10:01pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n::: With the arrival of the Newcomers, Hell Beast led the attack :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Predacons, attack!
