He shifted himself around to look\ndown, and he could see what was happening. &quot;Frag!&quot; he said as he saw\nthe tell tale signs of blindness coming from Tuscon, especially\nblindness without his head mounted sonar devices.\n\nKicking off from the side, Rodimus used his grappling line as a\nrepelling rope and slid all the way back down and retracted the line,\nas he pulled his weapon out with one smooth move, &quot;Perceptor, stand\ndown we don&#39;t have any time for this!&quot; he said, his voice all\nbusiness.&quot;\n\nThe distinctive wine of a weapon powered to full strength could be\nclearly heard from Rodimus as he glanced at Darkhwak and Tuscon while\nkeeping his weapon firmly trained on Perceptor, &quot;There&#39;s GOT to be\nanother way out of here!&quot; Rodimus said in frustration. &quot;If only we had\nthat Sonar.&quot; Rodimus said under his breath as he thought furiously.\n\n&quot;Leagcy!&quot; Rodimus said over the radio, &quot;After the last battle of the\nMinion invasion I believe that Scorponok and others, inclusing a few\nAutobots were able to escape through a tunnel that Scorponok dug. Did\nthat reach all the way here?&quot;\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Legacy&#39;s cold voice intoned. &quot;According to the record of the\nsame ordeal that Kup gave us, they came up several hundred meters in\nfront of the pool of lava.&quot;\n\nLegacy paused as his own formidable scanners went to work, analyzing\nthe underground network of tunnels. &quot;However there is a tunnel 11.57\nmeters beyond that wall.&quot; A beam of light shot out from Legacy and hit\nthe wall, displaying the location. &quot;For the moment it appears to be\nunused, and the tempature is currently just within tolerable range for\na Cybertronian to use for a limited duration. However I would not\nrecommend the use of explosive ordinance to excavate the tunnel since\nthe room itself is generally unstable and too large of a disturbance\ncould open open up fissures that could quickly flood the room with\nmolten rock.&quot;\n\nRodimus nodded, &quot;That&#39;s just what I wanted to hear.&quot; he said as a\nsmile appeared on his face, as his amber colored optics fixed on\nPerceptor. &quot;I have no interest in using explosives on the wall, not\nwhen we have someone here who can perform that task so much more\nefficiently!&quot;\n\n&quot;Then I would suggest that you expidite matters, it will only be a\nshort while until Hydras and his subjects find another way to attack\nus.&quot; Legacy turned his sensors to attempting to track the Decepticons\nand Predacons.\n\n(Summary: Rodimus jumps back down, and learns from Legacy that there\nis another possible way out, but they will need Perceptor&#39;s talent for\ndigging to utilize it. Legacy scans for any approaching enemy units.)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
