Alliance moved, Preds moved, and I think \n&gt; that should be enough. How about we say that Maximals have a base \n&gt; move left, and put this following rule into effect (I&#39;d like to \nhear \n&gt; everyone&#39;s oppinion on this):\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the mobile base rule has been really hazy lately, and since \n&gt; repealing it will lead to what was happening before it was put into \n&gt; effect, how about we ban anything mobile but one to three bot \n&gt; transports or the like. No shuttles, no subs, not flying bases, no \n&gt; space cruisers, only small transports. That way there&#39;s no way it \ncan \n&gt; be a base (how can a three man transport be a base?).\n&gt; \n&gt; How does that sound? It&#39;ll clear alot of confusion.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bell just rang, GTG.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK, well, then that just shot that idea out the window didn&#39;t it? \n&gt; OK, \n&gt; &gt; then what would you suggest we have happen at this point to keep \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; story line going? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (No mobile bases are the rules, whether they attack or not)\n\n\n"}}
