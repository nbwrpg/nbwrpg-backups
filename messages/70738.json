He was happy to see his comrade back on the mend. And now he was never go=\r\ning to allow anything else to happen to him. He takes his words into consid=\r\neration with a nodd of compliance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Understood Rodimus. I will not unde=\r\nrestimate Cyclonus by any means, but I will do my best to be sure that neit=\r\nher he or Hydras lays another harmful hand on any of the Maximals or Autobo=\r\nts ever again. And this time, I&#39;m very happy to have the help. I&#39;ll need it=\r\n, I may be a Prime, but I know even the best of warriors can do with having=\r\n good comrades on his side. Legacy, I will be grateful for anything you can=\r\n do to help Perceptor. And if Perceptor is comfortable with the extensive r=\r\nepairs, by all means, do try, but if it doesn&#39;t work, I will also understan=\r\nd. When I was last examined, I was also told that my damage may be far too =\r\nextensive to repair by normal means.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus looked at Tuscon nodd=\r\ning, &quot;There are two Primes now, those\nPredacons will never know what hit th=\r\nem.&quot; His words were firm and no\nnonsense. &quot;But we need more information on =\r\nthose insects before we go\nattacking them.&quot;\n\nRodimus got a thoughtful expre=\r\nssion on his face, &quot;I seem to have the\nimpression that the insects were old=\r\n. While I was connected to them, I\ncould feel that they are a race that is =\r\nnearly as old as the\ntransformers, but thier form was not always an insect =\r\ntype. I think\nthey are adapting to us in a way.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns=\r\n to Stanton.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stanton, I have something for Nightlight. I hope it will =\r\nbe enough to restore her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He opens his chest and reveals his pulsating=\r\n orb, which pulsates twice and forms a smaller version of itself. The small=\r\n orb of energy pulsates in time with his own. He presents it to Stanton.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot; This is what helped me to bring Rodimus back. It&#39;s a power that feeds o=\r\nff of compassion, hope, understanding, and kindness. The power of unity, an=\r\nd a simple force that we all possess to a level of degree. It&#39;s what drew R=\r\nat Trap to find me, and what drew me to Talon and all of you. And now, I wi=\r\nsh to extend this to Nightlight, in hopes that the compassion we all share,=\r\n will be enough to help her through this difficult time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot=\r\n smiles as her own heart spark beats within her chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Love is defini=\r\ntely something our enemy doesn&#39;t have. And there&#39;s no other force greater t=\r\nhan that.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSanton shook his head as he smiled at Tuscon, &quot;Thank you=\r\n.&quot; he said\ngravely, &quot;But that will not help here. Her problem is in her spa=\r\nrk.\nThat has the power to heal her physically, but not to restore her lost\n=\r\nmemories.&quot;\n\nBump nodded agreeing with Santon, &quot;Proceedures involving a bein=\r\ng&#39;s\nspark are always delicate and even dangerous.&quot; He glanced at\nPerceptor,=\r\n his optics clearly mistrustful and yet hopeful at the same\ntime, &quot;Maybe th=\r\nis is a way Perceptor can prove that he wants to be a\nMaximal. Help us undo=\r\n what he has done.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor sighted, he hoped tht he was abl=\r\ne to see again so he decided to\n&gt; take the risk&quot;I&#39;ll undergo that scan&quot;said=\r\n the male&quot;Let see if I&#39;ll be able\n&gt; to see again&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight was in dee=\r\np stasis but her face revealed the sadness and sufering\n&gt; of her painful ex=\r\nperience. Altough she had recovered a little under the care\n&gt; of Perceptor =\r\nand Rodimus, still she looked tin and fragile and her wrist and\n&gt; ankles sh=\r\nowed the marks of her restrain inside the pod where she had been\n&gt; most tim=\r\ne of her captivity\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy had been standing with Bump looking over =\r\nNightlight, &quot;I concur\nwith my collegues.&quot; he said, his voice as always cold=\r\n and clear,\n&quot;Clearly we have the greatest chance of success of repairing\nNi=\r\nghtlight with perceptor&#39;s help. After we have done this, then we can\nlook i=\r\nnto the efficacy of repairing Perceptor.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
