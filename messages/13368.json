He then made a decision to close the doors on the \ncave. He slid it over until they closed as good as he could get it. The \nMaximals out there would now have to deal with the acid rain alone. He \nlooked over. He needed repairs badly. He had damage from Rowdy Wolf, the \nDinobots, and the acid rain. He flew up and went to the CR tanks in the \nback.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
