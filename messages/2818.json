My computer has seemed to decide that it has a mind of its own and has not let me into the internet until now.)\n\n* Dinobot watched as Tavatron ran off in the direction of the Ark, actually marveling in the fact of how fast she had devoured her fish meal. He then shrugged but the fact of her quickness had never left his mind, it was unusually strange of how quickly a bot could eat their prey when they were famished.\nHe looked back over his shoulder when he had suddenly heard the sound of ripping flesh stop, giving the meaning that whatever had claimed his meal had either devoured the entire beast or had suddenly become full.\nBut when he saw was neither very interesting but did answer the question, the bones of the buffalo scattered and ravaged around the clearing by the brook.\nBut when Dinobot turned his snout back in the direction of the base he then noticed that Tavatron was a bit too far ahead and it was about time that he caught up, being left behind was a factor that he didn&#39;t wish to make a habit.\nDinobot took one last look around the brook clearing for any sign of the beast which took his meal but once he found no traces he then began to jog off towards Tavatron.\nIt wasn&#39;t long before he was side by side with the   she-wolf but then the thought of how fast she had eaten had occurred to him again...a small smile playing at the corner of his metallic lips.*\n\n&quot; You do not, by chance, have a fondness for mud puddles?&quot;\n\n* He couldn&#39;t really help the sharp comment, having spent nearly three years arguing with a vermin before he had died had made him more quicker to think of serious yet humorous ways of looking at events.\nAlthough it was a very rare moment that he ever expressed his opinions openly, this just happened to be one of those moments.\nThe comment at the current time was referring to a phrase in which he had known for quite some time but had never really cared to use, &quot; eating like a pig&quot; was just that comment.\nIn a sense he knew for a fact that if Tavatron caught the meaning she would surely act without reason.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
