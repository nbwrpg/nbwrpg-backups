It is and it isnt there. however\n&gt;the thing is battling the same thing of Blacknightmare. The hologram\n&gt;of the bamphomet cant be hurt however, whatever damaged that the\n&gt;blacknightmare hologram recieves it is duplicated by the pod to her\n&gt;body. When the final test was given all three were holograms.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Azure The Warrior&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Then why was it called hologram all the way long?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Legendarynemasis@a...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Infecticon tricks(ATTN: All of Darkfates Troops and\n&gt;Airly)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2001 11:46:58 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it isnt a hologram thing. Blacknightmare is in a simulation type\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thing where hjer body is actually in a capsule of sort.

Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at\n&gt;Darkfate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;They will work.

He was now once\n&gt;again\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission\n&gt;was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled\n&gt;somewhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before his message played over the comm lines of every single\n&gt; &gt; &gt;member\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Darkfates men.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Darkfate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is now our prisoner. If you do not do as we say, we shall kill\n&gt; &gt; &gt;him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are all to stop with whatever you are doing and are to\n&gt;come\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location of this transmission. You will recieve further orders\n&gt; &gt; &gt;from me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big\n&gt; &gt; &gt;whirlpool.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button.\n&gt;Back\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device\n&gt; &gt; &gt;activated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ledger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly shrank\n&gt; &gt; &gt;leaving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section\n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base.
