Plintissa sealed the door magnetically upon order from Tra=\r\nin Wreck, the Radicons were locked inside the room to sort out their proble=\r\nms. There was alot of banging, but it eventually stopped. Alot of name call=\r\ning, too.

Arrow stood up again, and started=\r\n pacing the room. Stronghold and Blender started to look in cracks in the w=\r\nall for something to drink, despite plenty of water in this room. Train Wre=\r\nck was discussing something with Arrow and Airbomber, and Stronghold and Bl=\r\nender joined them before long.\n\n                        &quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;=\r\ns really lonely sitting here with nothing to do, and--&quot;\n\n                  =\r\n      &quot;Shut up and get your ass over here!
