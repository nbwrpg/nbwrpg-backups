Perceptor you may think that you can cause darkness.  \n&gt; But you must remember, where there is fire.  There is light.&quot;  \n&gt; Flicking his arm back so that the pistol went towards Switchblade, \n&gt; his position known by thier internal link, he brough his other hand \n&gt; up, his massive sword coming out and igniting in flames lighting \n&gt; the whole room.  Then with a massive swing brought the sword \n&gt; down towards Perceptor his trail of fire following.\n\n\n"}}
