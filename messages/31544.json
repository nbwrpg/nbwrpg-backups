She squinted, seeing moving \nshapes along the front of a giant ship, much smaller then their own but \nstill a large ship.\nThere was a battle going on at the Maximal base, the place where she was \nsupposed to be stationed.\nWith her spark beating in worry Sublime picked up her pace to a run, moving \nalong the tall gress with a little trouble because she still hadn&#39;t quite \ngot her land legs yet.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
