You are a Predacon after all,\nand in your enemy&#39;s base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Cam::\n&gt; She nodded to Blackfang&#39;s comment. &quot;Sure we are. We&#39;re Maximals. That \n&gt; makes us the good guys right? So we have to be nice to everyone.&quot; she \n&gt; said with a big childish grin on her face plates. \n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat:\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t help but notice how Blackfang was tripping over his \n&gt; words. She smiled at him, trying not to laugh. She put her hand on \n&gt; her hip and let her tail slowly sway behind her as she stood. &quot;Are \n&gt; you actually inviting me to stay here? I am a Predacon.&quot; but she \n&gt; couldn&#39;t help it in liking the idea for recon purposes. She thought \n&gt; perhaps it might be a prime oppertunity. She smiled and took a few \n&gt; steps closer to Blackfang. She stood only two feet from him and \n&gt; looked directly into his optics. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from \n&gt; wishing he was on her side. &quot;Am I to be a guest or a well kept \n&gt; hostage?&quot; in a soft and gentle tone. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He wouldn&#39;t admit it, but the tone of her voice made him shudder \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; delight. However, he showed it a bit. He normally wasn&#39;t that shy \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; female Transformers, but with her, he seemed to have become a \n&gt; walking\n&gt; &gt; noodle-bot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: Well... Huh... I guess you could say that... But there \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; that one Terran tradition where they used to treat the wounded that\n&gt; &gt; were both friendlies and enemies... I guess that&#39;s a fine tradition\n&gt; &gt; with me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In his head, he was just wondering what he was saying at all. He\n&gt; &gt; usually made sense in his sentences!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: You know, if you&#39;d like to stay a while longer to make \n&gt; sure\n&gt; &gt; your injury is repaired, you&#39;re welcome. I mean, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; inhospitable, right Cam? We like everyone!\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
