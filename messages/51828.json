He would die. Soon.\n\nThey had left her guarded by only one guard because her ID were not \nvalid. Had they really known who she was, they would have placed her \nunder martial guard. And that is only because Maximals do not have \ndeath sentence.\n\n???: Huh... Sir, there&#39;s something I gotta tell you...\n\nHe didn&#39;t turn right away. She had bothered him for the last hour with \nunimportant details. She took profit of the time to play her first \ncard. Her arms became covered with blood red liquid for an instant, \nbut she left them in her back.\n\nGuard: What is it again, girl?\n\nAs a matter of fact, she didn&#39;t seem to be more than a young girl. \nAppearances, he would learn, were deceptive.\n\nShe took grab of his arms with her own, although hers were now thin, \nstrong and long. Before he could scream, she kissed him passionately. \nThat was the last kiss he got, though, as a liquid chainsaw ripped him \nin halves, destroying his spark.\n\n???: There. I&#39;m a Pred.\n\nShe left the small jail, taking the appearance of some ship pilot, and \ntook a small and fast racing corvette. She left Cybertron quietly, \naware that in a few hours, she&#39;d be one of the planet&#39;s most wanted. \nIt wouldn&#39;t matter.\n\n???: I&#39;m coming, you space-junkies, so you better freak now...\n\n\n"}}
