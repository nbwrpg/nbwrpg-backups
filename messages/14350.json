He could tell that Prowl \nliked her, but he had a slight crush on her as well. His eyes take in her \nform as she turns to him, shaking out of his trance as he hears her words. He \nwalks over to a console, tapping a few keys.\n\n&quot;The scanners report that the hull has caved in,&quot; he says after a few \nseconds, &quot;It&#39;s falling apart.&quot;\n\n"}}
