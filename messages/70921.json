Tell Quickstride to get into battle mode and prepare \n&gt; f=\r\nor combat immediately.  I need you to do the same, and get the shields up \n=\r\n&gt; and running at the Ark.

Shots ring out like \n=\r\n&gt; echoing booms as hydraulics hum with each recoil of the weapon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nigh=\r\nt Shift now tries to communicate with his leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hey, if I were you=\r\n, I&#39;d dish out the sonar waves, if ya know what I mean.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson gets N=\r\night Shift&#39;s transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I wonder..

If that is the case t=\r\nhen Quickstride is literally thousands of miles\n&gt; &gt; from the battle as it i=\r\ns on a different continent altogether. The battle \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; in Europe whi=\r\nle the Ark is on the North American continent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFrom the firing range, Night Shift could see that Tucson&#39;s ploy was\n&gt; &gt; wor=\r\nking, as Straight Shot works in unisen with Kup. With the arrows fired,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Straight Shot gives Kup the data he needs to make a direct hit, via using\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; her physical weaponry form, and her guidence systems. It was now up to =\r\nKup\n&gt; &gt; to do the rest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Nice firing Kup, it&#39;s working! I&#39;ll co=\r\nntinue to download the trajectory\n&gt; &gt; coordinates to you, and hopefully we&#39;=\r\nll get those plane brains to focus on\n&gt; &gt; something else other than the for=\r\ntress.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Looks good, they&#39;re buy=\r\nn&#39; it. I dunno if we should stay still though,\n&gt; &gt; they could get a fix on =\r\nus and then we&#39;re curtains. I vote we slowly \n&gt; &gt; change\n&gt; &gt; our locations =\r\nafter a few shots, so that way we can confuse the living \n&gt; &gt; heck\n&gt; &gt; outa=\r\n their processors.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From Tucson&#39;s vantage point, although unabl=\r\ne to see what was happening, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; keeps his com links open to his =\r\ncolleagues. And from what he could \n&gt; &gt; surmise,\n&gt; &gt; things were going acco=\r\nrding to plan. But yet he still had to think of the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What If&#39;s.&quot; There =\r\nwas always a chance that even a well thought out \n&gt; &gt; strategy\n&gt; &gt; could go=\r\n awry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;From what I hear,things appear to be going well. But we=\r\n can not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; discount\n&gt; &gt; the fact that events have a way of turning on =\r\nus abruptly. Continue on \n&gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; paths, but be cautious.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Rat Trap who was now with Windlord was happy to see that the jets were\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n being distracted away from the fortress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We copy that Wheels,=\r\n okay Windlord, I think we can make our move, the\n&gt; &gt; distraction&#39;s working=\r\n. I&#39;ll leave it up ta you ta find the best way in. \n&gt; &gt; You\n&gt; &gt; know this p=\r\nlace better than I do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson now continues to move in slowly.=\r\n He keeps to hidden areas on the\n&gt; &gt; land with low vegitation, and travels =\r\nby river beds, to be sure that his\n&gt; &gt; tires do not kick up any dirt or rub=\r\nble. His trailer keeps him from moving\n&gt; &gt; too fast, as he tries to maneuve=\r\nr it through the terrain. That however did\n&gt; &gt; not bother him in the least.=\r\n He had never been one for speed, even in his\n&gt; &gt; old SUV form. Things seem=\r\ned rather familliar to him now, the way the\n&gt; &gt; situation was playing out, =\r\nreminded him of older times, when Optimus Prime\n&gt; &gt; would lead his Autobots=\r\n against the Decepticons and how careful he was \n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; his strategic=\r\n skills. And now, it was Tucson Prime&#39;s turn to roll in \n&gt; &gt; Optimus\n&gt; &gt; Pr=\r\nime&#39;s tire treads. As Hydras was a cobination of Galvatron and Megatron,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Tucson Prime now comes to terms that Optimus Prime was now living within\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; himself and for all intensive purposes, he is now the new Optimus Prime=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; now sends a message to all Autobots and Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; Before I met up with all of you, my direction was unclear. I thought\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n that I&#39;d be fighting a losing battle by myself, and for a long time, it\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; seemed that way. But then, along my travels, I met all of you, and you\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; brought me home, to the Ark, where you showed me where Optimus Prime \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n rests.\n&gt; &gt; At first, I wished intensely that Optimus Prime could be brough=\r\nt back to\n&gt; &gt; life, and I believed that for the longest time. Then, as I go=\r\nt to know all\n&gt; &gt; of you, and realized the big picture of what was happenin=\r\ng, and then,\n&gt; &gt; recieving the power of the Matrix of Leadership, I have no=\r\nw come to \n&gt; &gt; realize\n&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s far better to look ahead at who is aro=\r\nund you now, and what is \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; happen in the future than to dwell on =\r\nthat of the past. All of that would\n&gt; &gt; not have been possible if I had not=\r\n met all of you. And for that I thank\n&gt; &gt; each and every Autobot and Maxima=\r\nl for putting me on the right path. And\n&gt; &gt; now, it&#39;s time for me to repay =\r\nmy debt to you all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; As O=\r\nptimus Prime stood firmly against Megatron and the Decepticon\n&gt; &gt; Faction, =\r\nI will firmly stand my ground against the Predacons and\n&gt; &gt; Decepticons. An=\r\nd by the end of this battle, we will show them that it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; unwise to unde=\r\nrestimate our factions as they have done so up until now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He i=\r\nnches closser into his position.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The sweeps continue =\r\nto close, their boosters flaring as they streak in,\n&gt; &gt; momentarily showing=\r\n up on thermal radar and then disappearing as they\n&gt; &gt; shifted back to anti=\r\ngrav engines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The four remaining sweeps are now far more wary of at=\r\ntacks from Kup and\n&gt; &gt; Straight shot and use their aerial agility and super=\r\nior speed to the best\n&gt; &gt; advantage. The circle around laying down heavier =\r\nand heavier fire as the\n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Tuscon soliloquizes about his=\r\n own state of affairs and how they affect\n&gt; &gt; his new status and thoughts, =\r\nit is almost as if the sweeps can hear him, \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; more then likely th=\r\ney can hear him talking into the radio. The Sweeps are\n&gt; &gt; said to be able =\r\nto locate a single ameba in the vast oceans of a planet,\n&gt; &gt; locating a sin=\r\ngle voice in the cacophony of battle would present no \n&gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; Two=\r\n of them peel off and begin to fire at Tuscon!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *          *        =\r\n  *          *          *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile as Windlord and Rat Trap approa=\r\nched and flew around they can see\n&gt; &gt; the desolation around the tower. Ther=\r\ne is absolutely no vegetation around\n&gt; &gt; the tower or within several miles =\r\nof it. There is only broken ground and a\n&gt; &gt; large lake several miles acros=\r\ns, filled with bubbling and broiling liquid\n&gt; &gt; rock! Flight sensors show t=\r\nhat the thermal updrafts from the lake would \n&gt; &gt; make\n&gt; &gt; the trip for Win=\r\ndlord difficult but not impossible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tower itself extends direct=\r\nly out of the magma itself and only the \n&gt; &gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; that it is crafted fr=\r\nom some sort of Cybertronian enhanced metal that \n&gt; &gt; keeps\n&gt; &gt; it from dro=\r\npping into the same liquid state as the magma around it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thermal se=\r\nnsors show that at its bottom, where the tower meets the magma, \n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n is nearly the same temperature as the liquid stone, but evidently the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n tower\n&gt; &gt; has been sitting raised for quite some time because the top of i=\r\nt is much\n&gt; &gt; cooler. While still extremely hot, it is possible that for a =\r\nvery limited\n&gt; &gt; time someone may be able to crawl around the upper most se=\r\nction of the\n&gt; &gt; tower. However to deposit someone there would mean they wo=\r\nuld have to fly\n&gt; &gt; over the large magma lake, and there is no cover of any=\r\n sort, they would\n&gt; &gt; almost definitely be seen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far there has b=\r\neen no response from the tower itself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: The tower looks somethi=\r\nng like the telescoping tower that rose up out\n&gt; &gt; of the ocean that the De=\r\ncepticons used in the 80&#39;s cartoon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
