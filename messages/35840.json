You must be telling a lie, nobody has ever\ncared about me, everyone uses me, then they try to screw me on my pay, then\nthey even try to arrange my assassination. How do I know you aren&#39;t\narranging it as well? You are probably just another commoner. Someone who\nwill abandon me. I once found someone who I thought cared, Lambda, was her\nname. I didn&#39;t care enough about her and I lost her.\n\nBurning Hammer stopped at that. He realized exactly what he was doing wrong.\nHis own words explained it. &quot;I didn&#39;t care enough about her and I lost her.&quot;\nHe suddenly felt dizzy.
