Void laughs as two red and \ngreen wings \n&gt; sprout from his back. In an instant the wings fold infront of him \nand then \n&gt; seemigly split and reform themselves into a new cloak. Quickly void \nlunges at \n&gt; and grabs the robot as a cloud of corrosive acid and gas encompasses \nthe \n&gt; robot and the area around it that eats away at his armor and super \nstructure.\n\n\n"}}
