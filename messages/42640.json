Before the mutant could act \nseveral shots\n&gt; struck him in the back. (What types of weapons are we dealing \nwith?)  forced\n&gt; off balance the Raptor wouldn&#39;t be able to use his forcefield and\n&gt; transforming to Wolverine was out of the question as well, his \nspeed was\n&gt; ineffective if he had no place to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elsewhere Foxfingers stayed to the shadows avoiding video cameras. \nHe knew\n&gt; that his position was vulnerable, he also knew that he was getting \nlow on\n&gt; toys. He&#39;d always been prepared for anything but this was one \nsituation that\n&gt; even the best preperation wasn&#39;t enough for the Black Fortress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside Lunarpine continued his Ballet of death (Dramatic isn&#39;t \nit?) On all\n&gt; sides he had something shooting at him. One by one he knew the \nrelays were\n&gt; being destroyed and the only thing keeping the defenses from \ngetting a lock\n&gt; on him wasthe dampner he was useing. The Bat probes weaponry was \nanoying at\n&gt; best, they were obviously designed as scouts and not fighters. He \nmanaged to\n&gt; pin one down for a moment, &quot;I tried to be diplomatic&quot; he said into \nit\n&gt; knowing that the Preds would be listening.  He leapt forward \navoiding\n&gt; another shot landing near a swooping bat, &quot;I tried to reach a \npeacefull\n&gt; solution,&quot;  The wolf spun useing his tail to swat the probe \nharmlessly away.\n&gt; The furious former Maximal was nearing a state of rage as the \nwelcoming\n&gt; comittee got ever close to him,  He snapped his head to the side \ngrabbing\n&gt; another probe damaging the wing, &quot;But if force is the only thing you\n&gt; understand then go ahead and destroy us, Turn the virus we carry \ninto a\n&gt; plague, You will end up destroying us but in the process you&#39;ll \ncontract the\n&gt; plague and wipe yourselves out as well and eventually wipe out the \nwhole\n&gt; planet.&quot; The wolf was exagerating about all of them carrying the \nvirus but\n&gt; the Preds didn&#39;t know that. Without samples of each of thier \nindividual\n&gt; energeon thre was no way of telling who had the virus. &quot;But if \ndestruction\n&gt; is what you want then enjoy.&quot; The bats signal ended with a crunch as\n&gt; Lunarpines teeth sank into it&#39;s functioning circuitry, those words \nwould be\n&gt; the last thing that the bat would ever send.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 8:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: thieves and trapped/Outside the BlackFortrress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; BlackFortress defences/Kali::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The blackfortress defences continue to shot against Lunarpine; \nKali\n&gt; &gt; was checking the computer, looking for the intruders and she saw\n&gt; &gt; thanks at the video camera that Ender was doing a deal with the\n&gt; &gt; intruders, she pressed several buttons and advice to Shivah, while\n&gt; &gt; she was telling hin what was going on all the doors, where Ender \nand\n&gt; &gt; the intruder were, closed and locked down -that doors had been \nmade\n&gt; &gt; in that way that a normal weapon couldn&#39;t damage them.
