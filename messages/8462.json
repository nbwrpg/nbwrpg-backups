Getting up, he \nfired off \n&gt; a blast from his sonic blaster at Firearm&#39;s left side tank treads, \nrolling \n&gt; out of the way of Brix, watching him fire like a mad man, his back \nnow \n&gt; towards Firearm.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Predator went to beast mode, firing off a single grenade at the \narea where \n&gt; Firearm&#39;s cannon begins to extend from the top half of his tank \nmode.\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran pulled out a missile launcher from subspace, a blast from \nBrix sending \n&gt; chunks of tree hitting against his left arm.  Raising his launcher, \nhe fired \n&gt; off a rocket at Brix&#39;s back.\n&gt; \n&gt; =======\n&gt; \n&gt; Koga Shuko yelled, a few bullets hitting his scaly side.

Or we execute him like the Maximal pig he is!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hades raised his missile launcher, a photon charge slamming him \ninto the \n&gt; battered hull of the Ark, a metal plate snapping off and falling to \nthe \n&gt; ground.  The Newcomer raised his missile launcher, firing a single \nrocket off \n&gt; at Hot Rod&#39;s pelvis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anubis ducks, several bullets striking his left arm, leaving cracks \nin his \n&gt; armor.  The Predacon fired off a rocket at Rhinox&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron entered the run-down bridge of the Ark.  He took out two \ngrenades set \n&gt; too explode on impact, throwing them into the bridge, jumping out, \nthe \n&gt; grenades going off.  Unitron then ran for the engine room, laughing.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Serpentor yelled, shoulder blasts knocking him back a few feet, \ndigging into \n&gt; his left chest.
