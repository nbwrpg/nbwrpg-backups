Yet, I suppose \npart of the old me is still not going to give up fighting for what he \nbelieves in.  And that&#39;s Freedom for all who deserve it.  And - justice for \nthose, who have taken it away.  That is all I want, and hope for.&quot;\n\nHe sighs while pausing.\n\n&quot; Eventually I - would like to see this planet become peaceful.  A world \nwhere no one has to worry about dictatorship or slavory. And most of all, \nnot have to worry about ever being wrongfully tormented by neither Predacon, \nor Decepticon.  I - trust Char is still an existing terrestrial planet...  I \nwill have to - research that in depth..  It - would be a fitting place for \nthe Predacons and Decepticons.

Geeze, you&#39;re losn&#39; energy really fast, where&#39;s the energy leak \ncommn&#39; from?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to him.\n\n&quot;His arm, Hydras bit him and now he&#39;s leaking battery fluid rapidly. But now \nhe&#39;s transformed so it&#39;s hard ta tell where it&#39;s coming from.&quot;\n\nRat Trap widens his eyes.\n\n&quot;Ohh scrap, a battery fluid leak is bad news.  Hey, maybe I can find it and \nkinda slow it down enough ta get the big guy back ta base. Hang on Wheels, I \nsaved ya once, I can do it again.&quot;\n\nHe scrambles out and looks for the leak.  He finds it at the head of \nTucson&#39;s right driver&#39;s side front wheel axle.\n\n&quot;Got it, Ohh it&#39;s a biggie.  I see a few severed lines down here, but I know \nI can patch these up temporarilly ta stop the leaks, until he gets back ta \nthe Ark for repairs.&quot;\n\nNight Shift drives up to him, and with a special grappler hook, he hands him \na special metallic tape.\n\n&quot;Need this?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Yep, that&#39;s the stuff, thanks Night Shift.

Even though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was whispering as loud as he could, his voice sounded weak as the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a shuffled movement could be heard in the darkness of Elita&#39;s room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Elita . . . &quot; Elder&#39;s voice sounded as if it were getting further \n&gt; &gt; &gt; away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OUTSIDE THE TOWER\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras started to move away, trying reach a safe distance; while he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing that he open com link with all Predacons and said &quot;TO ALL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PREDACONS LEAVE THE BLACKFORTRESS and sorrounding area,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NOW... FOLLOW MY SIGNAL!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Hydras gives the order the other Predacons transform into to Beast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to make their get away, the vast majority of them taking to the air! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; large door on the black Tower opens as Scourge and Cyclonus fly out,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of them already in their aerial modes, boosters flaring as they hit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skies!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However as they fly they can almost immediately make out the form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord as he carried Rat Trap in his claws, the duo began to change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their vector of flight, angling towards them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Cyclonus transmited over his radio to Hydras, &quot;The Maximals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempted to break into the Fortress are trying to make their get away\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well. Shall we terminate them?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They began to fly after Windlord, their superior speed in the air \n&gt; &gt; &gt; making\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it easy for them to begin to close the distance between them, rocket \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missile launchers beginning to glow as they targeted the flying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile on the ground,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torca nodded as Hydras and the other Predacons began to back off. &quot;We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fuzors don&#39;t have wheels and drive.&quot; He said to Nightshift as looked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around and then glanced back at Tuscon in vehicular mode. &quot;But let&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what we can do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;BANTOR!&quot; Torca called out, &quot;Beast Mode!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Maximal in question quickly transformed into the somewhat bizzar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alternate mode, becoming a cross between a baboon and a Tiger; looking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strong and powerful, even if unconventional.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that Torca transformed into his beastmode as well, that of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elephant and a Killer whale. He along with Bantor positioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the front of Tuscon. &quot;We won&#39;t be the fastest things, but we can get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home.&quot; Torca said as he waited to pull.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Above their heads Noctorro, Air Hammer and Silverbolt take to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; skies,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming an aerial escort to the injured Maximals and Autobots!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
