I can understand\n&gt; the sharing of the parent&#39;s sparks to make a whole new spark, but the\n&gt; form? I would think that it would have to be built since they are\n&gt; robotic and machanical. Even though they have organic outsides, does\n&gt; that mean the insides are organic too? In the G1 series, they had to\n&gt; have Vector Sigma install life and personalities.  They had to have\n&gt; forms build and put infront of Vector Sigma.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Of course, a transformer wouldn&#39;t turn out like a human baby.\n&gt; You&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; probably need a blank protoform or a stolen one. Somehow I bet the\n&gt; &gt; two halves of the &quot;parental unit&#39;s&quot; genes would make the spark.\n&gt; There\n&gt; &gt; might be more than one way to make a transformer.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike glared at Black Arachnia, his optics wide and still to\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; speechless stare. He locked his crimson optics onto hers. She\n&gt; sounded\n&gt; &gt; pretty serious.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He slowly snapped out of his stunned stare and blinked. Deep down,\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; was spooked. But the fact of her pregnant may have saved her life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He lightly nodded to her and put his cobra hand over her back. He\n&gt; &gt; looked at Hell Beast&#39;s direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What are we gonna do wit&#39; him?&quot; He frowned. &quot;Ah wanna kill &#39;im.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
