Fun!\n\nIC:\n\nAbove the island know as the &quot;Alliance Island&quot; a massive shadow falls \nover the dormant base as the infecticon warship &quot;The Oblivon&quot; now \nhovers overhead. Quickly within a barrage of firepower from its laser \nbatteries, and hyper mega particle cannons, the ship blasts away two \nof the large laser turrets on the island as well as the manual \nartillary. Inside of the warship the mysterious Infecticons sits i a \ncommand chair as the rest of the Infecticons sit at their respective \nconsoles overlooking various read outs.\n\nBlight: &quot;Any defenses that could have been used against us have been \nneutralized.&quot;\n\nFrostbite: &quot;The transporter has locked onto the energy signatures of \nthe people of this island. The dormant ones are going to be \ntransported to the stasis hold.&quot;\n\n????: &quot;Has there been anything that reads for why they initiated \nemergency stasis?&quot;\n\nHooligan: &quot;Negative, all scanner readouts are normal. There is \nhowever an unknown robot, scanners indicate he is not in what the \ncybertronians call stasis lock. He appears to be unconscious.&quot;\n\n????: &quot;Once we begin preparations for the &#39;purge&#39; I want you to bring \nhim aboard. We will see what we can do to get him up and about and to \nanswer questions as to what went on here.&quot;\n\nHooligan nods before he turns back to his console.\n\n????: &quot;Demonite, Diablos, I want you to to head the salvaging. I want \nyou to strip this base of anything that could be of use to anyone. As \nsoon as this base is picked clean by us it will be wiped off the face \nof the planet.&quot;\n\nThe mysterious infecticon cackles as some white beams fly down from \nthe infecticon ship to transport the &quot;frozen&quot; bodies of the alliance \nmembers...\n\n\n"}}
