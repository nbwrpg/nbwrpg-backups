The \nback part of the craft was made of two domes, and the front half was a \nsomewhat rectangular shape.  Numerous symbols covered multiple parts of the \nred and black painted hull of the craft.\n\nInside the bridge of the ship, Suka, stood up from his chair as a readings \nfrom long range scanners was displayed on the main viewscreen.\n\n&quot;Hmmm...quite good,&quot; he said, observing the readout on all power signatures \non the third planet from the sun in the Sol System.  &quot;Several major bases.  \nHundreds of warriors.
