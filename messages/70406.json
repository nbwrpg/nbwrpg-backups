He scans as\nhealthy and sleeping, but these cables have snaked their way through\nmany of his vital systems.&quot;\n\nBump doesn&#39;t even turn from his observation as he spoke, &quot;Fortunately\nthese cables are inert and are making no effort to stop us.

Santon looked up at\nLegacy as both he and Bump backed away slightly, &quot;We will need your\ncomplete report on whatever it was that did this.&quot;\n\nLegacy nodded as he started to walk further in the entrance and\ntowards the medical bay, Santon and Bump both following him.\n\nSilverbolt who had come to stand next to Kyp, looked at Rodimus his\noptics dim and thoughtful, &quot;He was a hero Kup, even if he had fallen\ninto the trap of a black hearted villain.&quot; He turned to look at Kup,\n&quot;He will pull through, that&#39;s what heroes do.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
