I will keep it short since we do not have \nmuch time. It was about 30 Earth years ago. I had just started The \nTrainers. It was myself, Hammer, Blaze, a bot named Blackstar, and \nthan there was Lightrade. Lightrade was special. We were very close. \nHe had been my best friend since I could remember. He and I always \ndid things together, and kept together in the good times and the bad. \nWe had been at war for awhile against another rogue faction named the \nBultak, lead by our current Trainer Bullet. We were fighting over the \nBultak&#39;s moon base, because it was very important to our domination. \nWe finaly went all out and attacked. During the battle, Bullet \ndamaged Lightrade immensly. There was nothing I could do to save the \nbody. But the spark.....I stored it. I put it in a life-sustaining \nand have been keeping it all these years. I told him the first chance \nI got a fresh body, I would put his spark back. I would&#39;ve put him in \nStriker&#39;s but Striker&#39;s spark was still there, it just needed \nprograming. I made Bullet pay the ultimae price: I captured him and \nwiped his memory, making him join us. Eventually he started taking \nover Blackstar&#39;s work, and she didn&#39;t like that so she left us. We \nmet Ignatius a few months later, and there we are. Our current \nTrau=iners. What do you think?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
