The organic side amplifies emotions far too much \nfor my \n&gt; liking.&#39; She pondered it a moment. &quot;I assume that all the Seekers \ncould see \n&gt; right through me when I am around Megatron?&quot; she kicked herself. \nShe had \n&gt; tried so hard for many millenia to not let any emotion show when \nshe was \n&gt; around Megatron. She knew she showed compassion around Megatron. \nPlacing him \n&gt; first & foremost above anything else.. including herself. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Or is this something you kept to yourself or recently noticed?&quot; \nShe glared \n&gt; at Empath. &quot;I&#39;m not one to allow emotions.&quot; she should know that. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glanced down then out over the land. &quot;If Hydras has seduced me, \nit is \n&gt; only i his mind.&quot; though she wondered. He was not fully Megatron, \nsince he \n&gt; was partly Galvatron. She didn&#39;t take kindly to Galvatron, since he \nwould \n&gt; rather destroy them all than govern them.  \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to Empath. &quot;Then... I suppose if you can still read my \nmind, you \n&gt; know what Hydras wants me to do.&quot; she looked at her, watching her.. \nto see \n&gt; her reaction. Remaining calm, she would see what Empath would do \nfirst. She \n&gt; had no intention at this time to carry out his orders... not yet.\n\n&quot;Only Skywarp and myself realized you had a crush on him - the rest \nthought you were just overloyal.&quot;  Empath puts her hands on her \nhips.  &quot;And you&#39;ve certainly picked an interesting way of killing me -\n are you trying to talk me to death?  It sure didn&#39;t work for \nMegatron.&quot;  She&#39;s teasing again.  &quot;You know, I could probably get \nWheeljack to short your emotion chips if you wanted.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
