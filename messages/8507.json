He\ncoughed\n&gt; and gasped now that whatever had him stopped shocking him. He slowly let\n&gt; himself rest on the ground. He knew that the wires were still on his arms\n&gt; and head; he could see feel it.\n&gt;\n&gt; By him, he could hear a loud clanking noise, like metal hitting rock. He\n&gt; slowly turned his head to the side and saw a huge metalic, strange looking\n&gt; wolf stomping towards him. Most parts of it didn&#39;t look like a wolf, but\nit\n&gt; had a wolfish head. It had wings and feathers in some spots.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike&#39;s eyes went wide. He struggled to get to his feet, but he was\n&gt; too weak to move. He could barely even scream.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
