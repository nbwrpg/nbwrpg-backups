With her thumb she wiped the mech fluid away just to get a glimpse of the damage before more fluid replaced the old, it wasn&#39;t too bad but if it wasn&#39;t treated then it could bleed half of Prowl&#39;s fluid reserves dry.\nIron Raptor then looked around and spotted something that could help clot the fluid and thus slow the bleeding, the tree was near and she just reached over and grabbed a fist full of moss and then applied it to Prowl&#39;s wound. Due to the wetness of the fluid the moss stayed there and began to soak up the liquid.\nShe had heard Prowl&#39;s question and looked up from his wound to answer.*\n\n&quot; Yes, I can. But I want you in a CR chamber as soon as you get that bot in holding, alright?&quot;\n\n* She pressed a little on the moss to make it stay a little more but then took her hands away from Prowl, she stood back and looked at the natural bandage. It would do until Prowl got back to base.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
