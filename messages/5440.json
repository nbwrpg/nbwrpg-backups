He had stepped out of the CR tank a few\n&gt; cycles ago, and now he was dizzy and his stomach hurt. He thought. A few\n&gt; days ago, his body was put to his limits. Perhaps his systems were telling\n&gt; him to slow down. But he didn&#39;t like that. Not to mention he had lost a\nlot\n&gt; of weight.
