It bright goldish color \nshined brightly. It was a half 3d sphere cut in half.(thats what it looks \nlike) The destrons saw there where no visible ways of entrie. &quot;Where  is the \ndoor.&quot;\n\n Magnus smiled&quot;Right here.&quot; he placed his hand on the door and the scanner \nscanned his spark.. He made sure to enter all the knew sparks that would be \nentering. He watched as the door slided open as from nowhere. The destrons \nproceeded to install all the autoguns in the non visible compartment in the \nship&#39;s outside hull. He then walked in. It was the chamber. Well his built \nversion of the oracal chamber. There was an alter in the middle. He hooked up \nthe shield generator. He pressed the button and dark sentinel came on-line.  \nHe put a self shield aroung the shield generator. It would only come off \nunless the bot answered three questions and also had the sprak signature of \nmagnus. It would not be fooled by clones or any sort of duplication for it \nwas always updateing its sensors to block anything of that type. So no one \nwas getting to that shield generator. He pressed the button on the side wall \nand the alter carrying the shield generator slipped under the floor. and \nthere was no visible compartment that may indicate it was there. He smiled \nand walked out of the chamber.\n\n"}}
