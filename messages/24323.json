Lightning \nstrikes the arm. Astral gives a mental order and Lavatron splits up \ninto the seperate five bots again.\n\n&quot;Lavacons, you know what to do!&quot; Astrall yells. The skies overhead \nbegin to get dark. (I&#39;m trying to match how Dcoburn originally \ntransformed the Lavacons into Dark Lavacons)\n\nLighting rained down, mixing in with the lightning fired by Shadow \nCat. After a dark flash, the Lavacons stand up. They were now the \nLight Lavacons (not light as in good, light as in lightning). Energy \njumped from the fingertips of the various members of the team, \nalthough that high energy level didn&#39;t last too long before returning \nto normal.\n\n&quot;LAVACONS, UNITE!&quot;\n\nThe Lavacons all jump in the air, forming various bodyparts again. \nLight Lavatron stretches to his full height. Clapping his hands \ntogether, the gestalt sends electricity streaming toward Shadow Cat.\n\n\n(Reading the Lavacons&#39; profile might help explain the transformations)\n\n\n"}}
