This time it was very serious, and I&#39;ve been trying to fix it ever since it crashed (laptop was at the university, so I didn&#39;t have a usable comp). It looks alright now, but I only have 5 gigs of undamaged space out of the 20 that were originally on it :-(.\n\nAnyways, I have work early tomorrow so I have to go, but I&#39;ll post tomorrow. I&#39;m hopefully getting a new hard drive soon.\n\n\n"}}
