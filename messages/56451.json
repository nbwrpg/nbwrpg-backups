I could hold them down massively by\ncausing them fear. It would at least slow them an make it easier for\nus to slaughter them.\n\nTyrael: This has merit...

I was successful because I don&#39;t waste resources.  It\nwill take \n&gt; two bots to eliminate Hydras.  I think Tyrael and the Dragoon are\nour best \n&gt; choices.  Call it a hunch.  Either way, your job is to follow\norders, not to \n&gt; be bitter that they were chosen for the prestigious assignment over\nyou.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        He continues to glare taking a step toward Synergy, a fierce \n&gt; determination glowing in his eyes.  &quot;Frankly, I know they aren&#39;t the\nbest \n&gt; warriors here, I am.  But they should suffice for Hydras.  The rest\nof the \n&gt; battle will be equally intense, I assure you.  Although their exact\nnumbers \n&gt; are unknown to me at this time, I am quite certain they will\noutnumber us.  \n&gt; That means you may well have to fend off two bots on your own,\nunless of \n&gt; course, you don&#39;t think you can handle it.&quot;  He finally turns his\ndark eyes \n&gt; back to Tyrael awaiting his analysis.\n\n\n"}}
