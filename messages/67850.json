De=\r\nspite his massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appearance, he managed to stay hidden most of the t=\r\nime. He was\nvaguely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; known, asa rumor in the hoodlums of the city.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Little by little, he approached Silver Wings throughout the city. =\r\nHe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spoke with them, listened to them. They had been ravaged by the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; uprising the Iron Skulls had lead and viewed Jotunn&#39;s demotion as a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; candy punishment. The perpetrators, the soldiers themselves, had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\narely been chastised for that, and resentment was strong because of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis inaction among the surviving population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He agreed with the=\r\nm, and told them they should get even in one\nway or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another. Like a p=\r\nrophet, people took him to heart and remembered\nhim.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was hope for =\r\nthe wounded, the hope of recovery and vengeance. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only asked them n=\r\not to speak directly of him. His influence grew by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *********************************\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Intelligence reports had=\r\n been scarce inside the city. Deadfur didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like that.

But, he didn&#39;t want to take decisions on\nthat\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself. He went to Razorwing and handed him the datapad that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nontained the report.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deafur: What d&#39;you make of that?
