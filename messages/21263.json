Speaking of damage, I&#39;d like to mention missiles, charges, and \ngrenades. On the show, some of those weapons didn&#39;t do too much \ndamage, but some did do alot. A missile launcher mounted on a jet \nfighter is most likely designed to do alot of damage (thet&#39;s why its \nlimited to 2 missile shots per char per post), and some people have \nbeen taking them like optic shots.\n\nRemember, the things are powerful, but akwuard. But if your char \nhappens to get a direct hit, please post accordingly.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Most people dont take much damage when I shoot the the 50cal.\n&gt; gattaling gun, so I&#39;ll explain about it. A 50cal. would be the kind \nof\n&gt; thing mounted on a helicopter or a jet fighter. It&#39;s big and \npowerful. A\n&gt; 50cal. can blow a 1 foot hole in a 6 inch thick stone wall. So will\n&gt; people please get hurt once in a wile. You dont have to do this when\n&gt; hit, but for the record, you would br loseing limbs if hit by this.\n\n\n"}}
