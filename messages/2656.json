A small sigh escaped her lips as she then leaned her back against the wall by the door, what was the point of being third in command when there was no team to lead? The Maximals didn&#39;t seem to be a team, just stray individuals with their own schedules to keep. Just like her in a way, she had wanted to be with Prowl when Liono had called. She didn&#39;t care what he told her to do, she didn&#39;t care if he called up ALL of the Maximals to a meeting...just being with Prowl.\nSo she couldn&#39;t blame them, not for being themselves.\nIron Raptor then looked down at the floor, her features so pleasant only moments before not growing gloomy and overcast.*\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
