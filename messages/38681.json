They reach the exit and zoom out of the \nopening, flying at an incredible speed.  The two fly for a few \nminutes, speech kept to a minimum when something catches \nBloodystyke&#39;s attention.  A very large area of land was burnt and \ndestroyed, yet there was no sign of anything that could of caused \nit.  The two bots were stumped, that is, until they decended onto the \npatch of land, only to be shocked by an energon field as strong as \nany of the two bots had ever felt.  They immediatly switched to beast \nmode, knowing that the energon wouldn&#39;t effect them as much. The two \nroamed around the large area, searching for any clue as to what could \nof caused the mass destruction.  Finnaly, the two were ready to give \nup, tired of searching for what seemed to be an invisible object.  \nThey planned to report the incident to Zardus, and hopefully, that \nwould be the end of it.  Their hopes were crushed when they stumbled \nover a large bot with a menacing face, a bot who intimidated both of \nthe warriors, for he was a force to be reckoned with.  That is, when \nhe was actually awake, for, the mighty warrior was in stasis lock.  \nThe two brothers looked at each other, shocked as they realised that \nit was their old leader, the mighty Wolfgang.  The two hoisted the \nvery large bot onto their backs and quickly transformed into bot \nmode.  They flew towards the Iron Fist, and were to arrive shortly ::\n\n\n"}}
