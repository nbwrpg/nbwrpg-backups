His eyes widened, trying to blot the image out of his\n&gt; &gt; mind, but not succeeding. Depth Charge&#39;s offer to help went unnoticed\n&gt; &gt; as Prowl backed up in the air.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;NO!&quot; Prowl yelled, now completely unaware of his surroundings. What\n&gt; &gt; was in his head was his reality. External no longer mattered, the\n&gt; &gt; battle was in his head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He struggled against the imaginary bonds, hate for Megatron beginning\n&gt; &gt; to fill him. But it wasn&#39;t because of that scene alone. Something from\n&gt; &gt; his past, something he couldn&#39;t remember, fueled it as well. He\n&gt; &gt; jerked, trying to break the bonds that prevented him from getting to\n&gt; &gt; Megatron. Some shots whizzed by him in the real world, but he didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; care.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As anger and a feeling of helplessness mounted, another conciousness\n&gt; &gt; began to rise up in Prowl, the same thing he had felt the first time\n&gt; &gt; he had transformed into his monstrous second beast mode, and it was\n&gt; &gt; happening again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In his mind, his body expanded, the bonds that held him to the wall\n&gt; &gt; groaning and then snapping as he grew. His wings shot out further\n&gt; &gt; behind him, and his body transformed to something like a blend between\n&gt; &gt; a human and a raptor, his back legs buffer than his front ones but\n&gt; &gt; about the same length. The head was part that of an owl, with a raptor\n&gt; &gt; jaw instead of a beak. Feathers stuck out of the cracks in between his\n&gt; &gt; armor. Prowl didn&#39;t realize that the same changes were happening to\n&gt; &gt; him in the real world.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He was now standing in the room, topping 20 feet and glaring down at\n&gt; &gt; Megatron. With an enraged roar, Prowl leapt forward, snapping at\n&gt; &gt; Megatron with his massive jaws. In reality, he was soaring toward\n&gt; &gt; Halucigen, doing the exactly same action that he was attempting to do\n&gt; &gt; on the imaginary Megatron.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I was going to let you do it but i think i will do it if that\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ok...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Halucigen::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Halucigen started entering horrid graphics into the mind of Prowl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finding it diffucult for his large mind control.
