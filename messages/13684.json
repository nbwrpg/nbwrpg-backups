There were plasma cannons,\nlazers, and even a limited missile complimate. The ship came through the\natmosphere, and passed the terminator, into day time. K-9, the bot\npiloting the ship, scanned the area. He found a battle raging, but\ndecided to ignore it. He located the Ark, and started heading for it.\nNot long after he picked up the Cybertronian Fire. He altered course,\nand headed for it. He opened a commlink, to them, on a coded Maximal\nchannel. He didn&#39;t want Predicons knowing a new Maximal had arrived.\n&quot;Maximal ship, this is the transport ship, Nova. I&#39;m heading your way,\nand will land out front. Over.&quot; He said, to the comm.\n\n"}}
