He \ndidn&#39;t mean it that way, he had just pointed out that it shouldn&#39;t be \ntaken lightly. -Allright, love. I never said you&#39;re stupid.- he \nthinks to her and shuts up, deciding that trying to make his point \nfurther would not be in his best interests.\n\nHe frowns, hearing her thoughts about second guessing. He was used to \nbeing a strategy adviser and giving advice; it was second nature to \nhim. Prowl also hears Iron Raptor&#39;s intentions of making the Maximals \nrival the Alliance. It could probably be pulled off, with a whole lot \nof organizing.\n\nProwl watches Shadow Cat and Snow Tech land. He was anxious to get \nback to base and help with the battle. For all he knew, the Maximals \ncould be dying right now!\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor had watched her firneds calm a bit, then place the \nsmall \n&gt; bundle of fur in her hands. Looking down at the little fuzz ball as \nhe \n&gt; stretched out to the contours of her hand. He was cute, she had to \nadmit.\n&gt; But now wasn;t the time to get a gushy. There were serious things \nto be done \n&gt; now, and number 1 was get back to base with her fiends in tow.\n&gt; But then Iron Raptor heardProwls thoughts on what she had said, her \neyes \n&gt; narrowing as she heard his commant on the idea.*\n&gt; &lt; And how am I supposed to take it? Like Snadow Cat and Snow Tech \nhandled \n&gt; the new of the advancing threat? I KNOW what the Alliance can \ndo,Prowl. I&#39;m \n&gt; not stupid! I just said that they could handle it until we got \nthere, and \n&gt; that&#39;s not long. So quit getting worked up. Being over anxious can \nonly lead \n&gt; to defeat.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked towards Prowl for a moment with a look that \nbasically \n&gt; backed up her thoughts.\n&gt; She was suck of being second guessed, and she wasn&#39;t stupid enough \nto not \n&gt; know that theCybertronian Fire and the Maximals under her command \nwere under \n&gt; attack.\n&gt; But Iron Raptors hands closed around the small bundle of life in \nher hands \n&gt; as he began to wriggle.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; They probably aren&#39;t. I detected a ship less then 100 clicks from \n&gt; here,new. Just landed. Probably where they&#39;re from.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Motioning with her head towards the crashing which had grown \ncloser.\n&gt; But then Iron Raptor watches as both of her friends disappear into \nflight \n&gt; and the sky...cocking an eye-brow.\n&gt; Wasn&#39;t it less then 2 min ago that they were the ones who were \ntelling both \n&gt; Prowl and herself to leave...and now they were leaving them behind?\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed. Those two could be so weird sometimes.\n&gt; But then a sound reached Iron Raptors ears as her friends \ndisappeared, a \n&gt; small hissing noise that was there and went away.\n&gt; She looked down at her hand where the small cat was laying, looking \nup at \n&gt; her with big eyes and licking her hand.\n&gt; Seeing the embarrasmant in his expression.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You little bugger....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She knew what he had done, and it wasn&#39;t very pleasent.\n&gt; Must be the food Snow Tech and Shadow Cat fed him.\n&gt; Iron Raptor doesn&#39;t move as Prowl comes up to her and slides an arm \naround \n&gt; him, still slightly peeved at him for his last commant.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; I know....&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She adds, simply standing sill and clutching the small fuzz ball \nto in her \n&gt; arms, ready to leave.\n&gt; But she was sick of all these attacks, and as soon as she got the \nMaximals \n&gt; into order after this, they would turn out to be a force that the \nAlliance \n&gt; would think twice about attacking next time.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
