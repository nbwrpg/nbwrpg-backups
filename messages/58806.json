Well before Pluto&#39;s orbit, a big, round planet hovers. \nIts existence will never be known by the inhabitants of its system, \nhowever.\n\nHatred, greed, power. Three words. They were embodied by a \ngargantuesque mechanical being named Unicron.\n\nThe planet never knew what hit it. Huge claws dug in its crust as \nUnicron grasped it and started devouring it. Mountains were shattered \nin a matter of minutes and the vibrant core at its heart was \nextinguished.\n\nUnicron was not happy. He sent a single message to his minions...\n\nUnicron: FIND THE MATRIX!\n\n\n"}}
