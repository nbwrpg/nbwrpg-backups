He landed in the water \nand started up toward the underbelly of the ship. He took one of his big guns \nout and shot at it. He hoped it would do enough damage to take down the \nsheilds (it does have those right? If not then to weaken the hull). He \nstarted to collect energy from around him. He was going to try and blast \nthrought the ship.\n\n"}}
