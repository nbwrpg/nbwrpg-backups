Why am I \nhere?&quot; She had to think about it.  SInce she was reprogrammed, she \nhad no idea why she even existed.  Her original boards were removed \nand with it, her mission assignments and logs. She looked at LadyHawk \nwith a dishearted look.  &quot;I...I don&#39;t know.&quot;  She turned and looked \nback at her papers. She had the feeling of being alone all of a \nsudden.  She didn&#39;t know why she was here or how she even got here or \nwhat her purpose was.  She just stared at the papers in her hand and \nsighed.  She couldn&#39;t even come up with a good reason for her \nexistants. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk knew therules of courtesy to well. Her father always \ntaught her\n&gt; that there were two things you didn&#39;t argue, religion and \nphilosophy. Both\n&gt; were subjects that held strong beliefs and a debate couldn&#39;t be won \neither\n&gt; way.\n&gt; \n&gt; She checked the results of the cell sample from the new bot \n(Nighteyes) and\n&gt; wondered about the possibilities it could bring. (What was \nNighteyes again?)\n&gt; Another successful aquisition of DNA. She was getting enough \nsamples for her\n&gt; father it would soon be time to return with her prize. the only \nproblem\n&gt; would be to lose her shadow. Or convince her to tag along with \nher. &quot;If we\n&gt; can divide the DNA samples in a bot then why not thier conversion \nchips as\n&gt; well?&quot; She pondered the moment. &quot;If a Maximal chip turns a \nprotoform into a\n&gt; Maximal and a Predacon chip turns it into a Predacon then there \nshould be a\n&gt; way to splice the chips together so that there isn&#39;t a \ndistinction.&quot; The\n&gt; hawkbot stared at the results more intently.  She stood wondering \njust how\n&gt; to ask the question so Squizzy would think that it&#39;s idle \nconversation\n&gt; instead of possible desertion. &quot;I&#39;m here because I need a place to \nwork.\n&gt; What&#39;s your reason?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, October 23, 2000 6:35 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: hawk and (mon)goose.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She nodded and checked the bot in the CR.  She pressed a few \nbuttons\n&gt; &gt; and the Chamber extracted a few cells off the bot.  She brought \nthe\n&gt; &gt; sample over to Lady Hawk and set them down on the table in front \nof\n&gt; &gt; her.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You have a point.  But then again, don&#39;t you think the Matrix had\n&gt; &gt; this planned out long ago? In order to have balance, the matrix\n&gt; &gt; created both Autobot and Decepticon.  Maximal and Predacon.  This \nhad\n&gt; &gt; to have happened for a reason. But what that reason is, I am not\n&gt; &gt; sure.&quot;  She went back to corner of the room as started looking at \nthe\n&gt; &gt; paper work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lady Hawk took it for granted that Squizzy would understand. Two\n&gt; &gt; facts were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant to her. &quot;Predacons fight because they are programmed as\n&gt; &gt; warriors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals fight because Predacons exist.&quot; She tried to explain \nthe\n&gt; &gt; source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her beliefs but found it hard to put into words without \ninstegating\n&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions. &quot;I&#39;ll take you somewhere where I can make it more \nclear\n&gt; &gt; to you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometime. &quot; she said trying to change the subject. &quot;I have work \nto\n&gt; &gt; do, If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you wish to assist me you can bring me a sample of this new bots\n&gt; &gt; DNA&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
