But the instant \nhis leg bent, he screamed. He leaned to the side and held his leg wounded \nleg out.\n\nThe next time he saw Sinester, he would shoot him for that shot for his \ndamaged leg. That was a lousy shot. And a shot for the new Predacon leader. \nHe now had to have more respect than that. He could have bots killed. By his \norders or always by himself. He preferred by his own &quot;hands&quot;. But killing \nsomeone now wouldn&#39;t work well, mainly because his body wasn&#39;t working well.\n\nHe needed to find his troops now. And most of all, he needed repairs. Badly.\n\nHe held his head over his lap and groaned loudly. He grumbled a few things. \nHe could again see the open wound on his leg. On the edge of the foot long \nwound, were singe marks. He didn&#39;t want to move now. That dumb bot Sinester \ncause him much inconvenice. That brace restricted some pain.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
