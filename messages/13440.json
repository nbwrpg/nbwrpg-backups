But first I&#39;ll ask Child. Child, I need to know \neverything about your father. I made an alliance with him just \nbecause he SAID he was for peace. I was rushing way into things. I \ndon&#39;t know him, I don&#39;t know what he does, I don&#39;t know YOU. How do I \nknow that you are only getting training from me so that you can use \nyour powers for evil uses. Once you&#39;re done, kill me, destroy the \nembassy and than you and your father go on to rule the Universe. How \ndo I know, Child?!? What proof can you give me that you are who you \nsay you are. And you Windrazor, are you really Soundwave&#39;s friend? \nHow do I know that you aren&#39;t just using the embassy as a base for \nsome evil plans. Battera, Cybershark and Soundwave each showed me in \nsome way that they trust me and believe in what I believe in. I need \nyou two to do the same, or this training is over.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
