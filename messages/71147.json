But Talon should \ngo now.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds and quickly wisks Talon to the CR chambers.  Tucson turns \ntoward Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Both medics down..  And an Ark in need of repair..  Hmm, I did a good \nportion of that damage with my sonar system..  First and foremost, are our \ncomrades.&quot;\n\nHe walks slowly to a door, which leads into the one room he never thought \nhe&#39;d enter.  His own private workshop.  Before becomming a Prime, he had \ntaken great pleasure in restorring old weapons and those in desperate need \nof repair.  And in some cases, he would also help to repair damages to other \ncomrades.  He opens the door with a code.  Straight Shot peeks in.\n\n&quot;Wow, it&#39;s just as you left it Tucson.  Everything is still there.  Your \nentire workshop, tools, materials, all neatly categorized according to form \nand function.  A little dusty in here but still workable space.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; True, but things must be kept clean.  And to properly conduct repairs on \ncomrades, I&#39;d rather be where they can be monitored safely.  I need some \ntools, and materials. I can get them here, and bring them to the medical \nbay.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me.  It&#39;s about time I actually \nput to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired from Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot; You really should have an assistant.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes.  Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you to assist me.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson flashes his headlights dimly in reply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Of course. But if you could, please, allow us to rest together. \n&gt; &gt; Knowing\n&gt; that she is with me, safe from harm, only then can I rest as well.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was rather obvious that his love for Talon grew ever stronger. He was\n&gt; not able to show her that due to being under such duress, but now, there \n&gt; was\n&gt; time to express his feelings for her. He was a bot true to his word. His\n&gt; love was real, and it would remain as such.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot knew him well. She knew what he meant and that made her \n&gt; &gt; very\n&gt; happy. Her big brother had finally found someone to be with and she only\n&gt; hoped that it would lead to something more special in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Aw, now how can ya refuse a request like that huh Perceptor? I think I\n&gt; know what this means.. And I hope one day, somewhere along the line, that\n&gt; they&#39;re both as happy as Rodimus and Nightlight, with a family of their\n&gt; own.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded as the others talked, taking his time to look around the\n&gt; room, trying to be absolutely sure that nothing critical is damaged.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Hydras and his team were little more than a dot in the skies as\n&gt; they moved away carrying their own injured with them. All around the Ark\n&gt; defensive shielding began to flicker into place on the heels of the\n&gt; Predacons and Decepticons vacating the area, weapons and guns began to \n&gt; twist\n&gt; and turn as they initialized and calibrated themselves â€“ another Predacon\n&gt; attack would not be so easy. In fact this one would not have been if it \n&gt; were\n&gt; not for Nightrazor sabotaging many of the Ark&#39;s systems and then the sonic\n&gt; wave that Tuscon had sent out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as the main systems were coming up, it would be some time before \n&gt; every\n&gt; systems was running again as they should.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy near the gigantic forms of Megatron and Optimus, even in death it\n&gt; seemed that these two were locked in some sort of titanic struggle. He\n&gt; looked around, his single optic taking in the entire vista and then he\n&gt; turned back to Tuscon and Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;For the moment the time stream would appear undamaged.&quot; Legacy \n&gt; pronounced.\n&gt; &quot;However it is difficult to know the full ramifications of even these \n&gt; small\n&gt; changes that have occurred, and if we have not inadvertently changed\n&gt; something that was.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at Legacy, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Rodimus came to stand beside\n&gt; Legacy, who had himself moved towards Tuscon. &quot;We need to find a way to\n&gt; secure this Ark. If it is damaged too much, or too many changes are made,\n&gt; then all this that we are fighting for would be for nothing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A call came in from Ramulus, &quot;Rodimus, Tuscon, our medics are both down. \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; holding them together with a med kit, but I am going to need some help \n&gt; down\n&gt; here.&quot; Ramulus&#39; voice was calm, and yet there was still an edge of \n&gt; something\n&gt; in his voice: Concern? Fear? Anger?\n&gt;\n&gt; From outside Leo II followed by Wing Caliber and the Fuzors. With the \n&gt; battle\n&gt; over, they definitely looked tired. Two battles in the space of a day \n&gt; would\n&gt; definitely tax anyone&#39;s reserves.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
