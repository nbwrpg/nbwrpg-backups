Then small teams attack differant point of their base,\n&gt; causeing their defense to spread at minimal capacity. Those teams \nalso\n&gt; keep moving. Attack quickly and move to the next point of attack. \nWhile\n&gt; this is happaning another team, most likely us Commanders, find a \nway\n&gt; into the base and extract DarkFate. Also this will have to be done\n&gt; quickly because we are not suited for water. I still say the best \nway in\n&gt; is from me drilling up from the elow the ocean floor and into the \nbase.\n&gt; The only problem is we need to know a little bit about that bases\n&gt; design.&quot;\n&gt; He looked to DarkFate with a look of &#39;What do you think?&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
