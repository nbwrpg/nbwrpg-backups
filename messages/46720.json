I backed off because when I get too into a battle, I become \nberserk. In the it has ended with the death of a decepticon, but also \nthat of my commanding officer. That is why I am on this planet right \nnow. I AM PROTOFORM Z, THE BROTHER OF PROTOFORM X! I AM A TRUE MAXIMAL \nBUT I CAN NOT CONTROL MYSELF IN A BATTLE!\n\nThis outburst of anger made him shake wildly. He fell to the ground. \nHe sobbed weakly. His shoulders came down and it was obvious he was \nmentally beaten.\n\nAzureBlade: We did not have to kill him that much... It... is \npathetic, right? I am a warrior, but I do not want to kill... The \ndragon is not resolved to kill the intruders... Can you even trust me?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Starcasm6@a... wrote:\n&gt; goth: YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE!
