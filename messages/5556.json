WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Wait, it has Predacon markings, and design.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Most likely a Maximal trick, open a channel now!\n\n::: Pheniox opened a channel, Gremlin, Jackle, Inferno, Rampage, Tankkor, \nScourge, and the other Predacons watched. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: This is Senator Hell Beast of the Predacon Allience. I am \nthe Commander of this important outpost on a covert mission. You presence \nhere is unexpected, but also welcome. Currently we are at a gruesome battle \nwith Maximals and other rouge groups that have arrived here. Your relief here \nwould be very appreciated. I hope you find a suitable landing spot and as \nsoon as you are settled I wish to hold a conference with you on this new \nsituation.\n\n::: With that, he shut off the Comm. :::\n\n::: Transanulas broke the silence that had filled the room durring the \nspeech. ::: Do you actually think another Predacon commander came here in \nthat giant ship to help us out? They came here to remove us!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Im a Senator. I know how Predacon politics work. And i do \nagree with you, spider. They probly did come here to get rid of us. It has \nbeen far past the deadline to get the energon back to Cybertron, but the ship \nis a bit unmoveable at the moment.\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: So we&#39;re just going to sit here and let them kill us?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: No, no. I will talk with them first, find out what there \nmotive is first. we will play it by ear for the moment. But I assure you, we \nwil not let these Predacons remove us from here.\n\n::: The Predacons gave chuckles and resumed work. :::\n\n"}}
