She stays on the \nground, and notices Nightlight being approached by Depp. A \ngrowing sense of doom builds as she gets to her feet and fires two \ndisks at Depp. Immediately after firing the disks, she puts her gun \naway and starts to sprint towards Depp thinking, &lt;&lt;I can&#39;t let this \nhappen...&gt;&gt; as she prepares for close combat mode. Her claws \nextend from her hands with a metallic ringing. \n\nAxis, not sure what to do, waits behind the pod, hoping that the \nheavy heat resistant re-entry armour on the pod will hold out for this \nbattle. Without looking, he yells, &quot;LOKK?&quot; Wanting to make sure \nthat Lokk is ok.\n\nLokk creaps around, weaving through trees. Exiting the forest, he \nhids behind a near by rock. Keeping low to the ground, he crawls \nalong still trying to get behind the enemy and he&#39;s almost there.\n\n"}}
