I shall investigate the cave and report back to \nyou.&quot; she said grinding her teeth.\nShe entered the cave and looked around.  She yelled back at Scorponok, \n&quot;Other than having room service clean up, and getting some noce drapes in \nhere,  it seams to be fine.&quot;\nShe checked out the back caverns and the other natural chambers.  Nothing \nwas found.  All the walls showed centuries old volcanic activity, but little \nelse.  She returned to Scorponok.\n\n&quot;Sir, nothing shows up as being a problem.  This appears to have been an old \nvolcanic vent at one point in time eons ago.  Nothing else.  The surrounding \nplant growth must have hidden it well enough for no one else to to have \nfound it before us.&quot;\n\n---------Original Message----\n&gt;From: crow_lord@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 23:45:48 -0000\n\n&gt;Scorponok\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Scorponok looks at DarkMouse. &quot;Thats better.&quot; Scorponok laugh, maybe\n&gt;this bot isn&#39;t that bad. &quot;Well investigate the Cavern, I&#39;ll stay here\n&gt;to make sure none appproches.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
