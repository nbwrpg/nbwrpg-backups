She stopped her selfish thoughts\nand reminded herself on why she was there. She was there to help her father\nfind a way to unite the factions, not hack files. Sheshut down the computer,\nstood up and started toward the door. &quot;I&#39;m on my way&quot; She hoped the bot\nwasn&#39;t to badly hurt she was a science bot not a doctor. It was just more\nDNA to her regaurdless of the bots faction it still had DNA and that made it\nworth helping.\n\n&quot; how bad is it?&quot; She asked as she entered the CR room, the bot didn&#39;t look\nto injured just a damaged leg. the CR chamber should be able to handle the\ndamage easy enough so she didn&#39;t worry to much. She aproached Squizzy with\ncaution knowing how mongooses loved Hawks.\n\n &quot;You know, the more I think about it, the more I like your idea of making\nthe bots to better suit  the eco system around here.&quot; Squizzy said as Lady\nHawk aproached &quot; but even with\nthe perfect body, it&#39;s the mond of the bot that makes me cringe. How can we\nmake a bot&#39;s mind so he or she will be nature oriented?&quot; The young bots\npoints were a valid concern, A concern that Veratis had thought of multiple\ntimes.\n\nLady Hawkchose her words carefully so she didn&#39;t reveal the full idea. &quot;That\nis the difference between who I want to obtain the technology and who would\nabuse the technology.&quot;  She watched the readings on the CR chamber wondering\nwhat the new bot knew about this war.&quot;If the technology was abused we&#39;d just\nhave a more violent form of war to fight. No instincts to induce fear means\nno fear to hold a bot back.&quot; she shuddered to think about what Zardus would\ndo with the technology but knew that when her fathers goal was reached there\nwouldn&#39;t be anything to worry about.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, October 21, 2000 9:13 AM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars..\n\n\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt;\n&gt; She had her head filled the ideas of creating a balance between\n&gt; nature and transformer.  Despite the smiling face she had kept up for\n&gt; Lady Hawk, she needed a breather.  She looked at Ladyhawk. &quot;I&#39;ll be\n&gt; right back.&quot;  She walkded out of the lab and down the hallway.  She\n&gt; passsed the entrance when she noticed a bot outside the entrance\n&gt; doorway.  She openend the door hatch and looked at the bot. &quot;Holy!&quot;\n&gt; She bent down and tried to pick up the bot, but being smaller than\n&gt; most Predacons, she couldn&#39;t.  She called to LadyHawk. &quot;HEY! I GOT AN\n&gt; INJURED BOT OUT HERE. I&#39;ll need your help on this. Like right now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Oops, missed that post.
