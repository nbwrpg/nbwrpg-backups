I thought it was an=\r\nother quake. Okay so what did Legacy do ta deserve another shout match with=\r\n Tucson?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks back to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The usual, he tried to go=\r\n against Tucson&#39;s orders. And you know what happens if we disrespect a Prim=\r\ne, right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ohh yeah, that&#39;s why I would never dare t=\r\na do anything like that, noooo waaaay, especially with Tucson. As far as I&#39;=\r\nm concerned, like Rodimus, what he says, goes. Legacy better watch his step=\r\n, that&#39;s two strikes against him now. And yeah, I&#39;ve been keepn&#39; count.&quot;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Straight Shot frowns.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s even still with us. Somethi=\r\nng about him so creeps me out it&#39;s not funny.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLord Elder watched a=\r\ns Legacy walked away and Tuscon and Talon began\ntalking. He sighed again an=\r\nd began walking to where the others were.\nHe could hear thier conversation.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Are you really counting?&quot; Lord Elder and Quickstride a curious look\non h=\r\nis face. His face and form looked a little bigger than before, his\nface cle=\r\nar and shiny, and yet he still managed to have a haggered look\non his face.=\r\n\n\n&quot;While you are counting, don&#39;t forget while everyone else was off\nfightin=\r\ng in the battle when Cyclonus and his drones were sacking\neveryone includin=\r\ng the Predacons that Legacy single handedly held the\nArk against 5 of Cyclo=\r\nnus&#39; most powerful cronies. When we had to go\nrescue Rodimus who was there =\r\nhelping, taking much of the damage and\nexpending his precious energon to sh=\r\nield you guys. That was Legacy.&quot;\n\nLord Elder frowned, &quot;Has anyone ever even=\r\n talked with legacy? Does\nanyone even know the first thing about him? He ar=\r\nrived here from\nPrimus knows where and no one even asked him anything. You =\r\ntrust him\nwhen the energon chips are down, but now you are ready to boot hi=\r\nm\nout.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are we Maximals or rabble. If we turn to fighting among\nours=\r\nelves then what are we?&quot; Lord Elder shook his head as he began to\nwalk away=\r\n. &quot;And before you go betting on who would win the battle you\nwere discussin=\r\ng, you might want to find out more about Legacy first.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
