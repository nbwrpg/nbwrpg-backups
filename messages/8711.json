She sat up and  \nlooked around the lab.\n&quot;What the? How did I get here? And where is here?&quot;\nShe got up and walked out of the lab and into the main room.\nShe looked around the main room and saw no one was around. &quot;No one at \nhome I guess.&quot;\nShe walked over to the console and stared at it with a quizzical look \non her face.  &quot;I wonder what this is.&quot;  She stared at the monitors \nand looked at the screens.  None of it made any sence to her.  She \nlooked under the console and saw a cage with a small rat in it.  She \nknelt down and stuck her finger in the cage.  The rat, Akura, put \nit&#39;s paw on her finger.\n&quot;Your a friendly litte guy aren&#39;t you?&quot;  She opened the cage and \npicked the rat up.  It ran up her shoulder and nuzzled against her \nneck.\n&quot;Hey, cut that out, those little whiskers of your&#39;s tickle.&quot; she said \nwit a slight chuckle and a smile.  She carried the rat with her to \nthe entrance of the cave.  She looked about arounf the entrance and \nsaw no one about.\n&quot;Hmm, this is very odd.  How is it that a whole group would leave a \nbase like this unguarded?&quot;  she shrugged her shoulders and looked \naround again.  No one was in sight at all.\n&quot;Well, If this place is deserted, I guess there is no reason for us \nto stay them.&quot; she held the rat in her hands and up to her \nface. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t ou agree my little friend?&quot; She smiled and put the \nrat back on her shoulder.\n&quot;Well, whick way to go from here?  I suppose that way is as good as \nany.&quot;  She started walking off into the forest with her rat on her \nshoulder.\n\nShe verntured a few miles and rested near a small stream.\n&quot;Things are looking up my little friend,&quot; she said to the rat,&quot; We \nhave fresh water, and look, fish.  We shall have lunch in no time \nflat.&quot;  \n\n\n"}}
