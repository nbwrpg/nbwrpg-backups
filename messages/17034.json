I will not intentionally scrap this pathetic femm.&quot;\n\nHe walks off after Prebon, growling at Spears as he passes her.\n&quot;Watch \nyourself,&quot; he says to her, continuing after Prebon.\n\nSoon, he will have a chance to kill... His lips curl in anticipation \nat the thought of murder, but he couldn&#39;t help hoping that a certain \nfemale was in Ramulus&#39; place.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus turns around, facing the other bots in the Ark. &quot;Allright, a \nfew bots from the Cybertronian Fire will be here soon,&quot; he says, \n&quot;They&#39;ll bring cloaking devices. I&#39;m supposed to meet him alone, but \nthis can easily be a trap. The cloaking devices will effectively hide \nyou from detection, radar or otherwise. If they open fire, we&#39;ll fire \nback.&quot;\n\nHe looks around at the bots there. &quot;Is that ok with everyone?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm and Proto exit the Cybertronian Fire, nearly crashing into \nSoundwave.\n\n&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Firearm asks curioustly as he picks up his \ndropped cloaking devices and puts them in various compartments.\n\nSoundwave shruggs, looking a bit bored. &quot;Just drug a bot to the brig, \nnothing to do now.&quot;\n\nProto cuts in before Firearm can reply. &quot;Great! You can come with us. \nI think we&#39;re heading into battle.&quot;\n\nThe other Maximal nods, walking out of the Cybertronain Fire with the \ntwo officers. Firearm activates his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Maximals,&quot; he says into it, wondering if any other bots might be \nbored, &quot;Me and Proto,&quot; he didn&#39;t know Soundwave&#39;s name, &quot;Are heading \nfor the Ark, anyone in need of a mission can report there.&quot;\n\nThe three Maximals fly into the air, heading for the Ark.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Spears::\n&gt; She nodded to Prebon and then looked at Slayer. &quot;I shall no longer \n&gt; fight you Slayer, under orders from Master Prebon.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She followed Prebon \n\n\n"}}
