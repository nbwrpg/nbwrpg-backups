And she was going to creat that bot. She said I was going \nto steal her experiments? I was going to assist her in the greatest \nsceintific experiment on this planet. How can she say that. I thought \nwe were friends. I thought she trusted me as I trusted her. And then \nshe attacked me.&quot; She paced the floor a bit. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this. \nTell Zardus that I&#39;ll give him the report and all the info I have. \nThen I&#39;ll maek these bots for him and show that little featherhead \nnot to backstab a mongoose like that.&quot; She rubbed the spot where the \nneedle had penetrated her side. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::FZ::\n&gt; \n&gt; FZ frowns, looking at Squizzy. &quot;She told me you wanted to steal \ncredit \n&gt; for her experiments and so she tried to terminate her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks at the remains of the two bots, the Iron Fist&#39;s computer \nand \n&gt; Zardus&#39; own memory working in his head, &quot;She doesn&#39;t sound like \nshe&#39;s \n&gt; telling the truth though.
