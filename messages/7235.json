But judging by the speed in which the fellow Maximal had been moving it wouldn�t have been much of an impact if he had, not even causing Dinobot to side-step to keep his balance. The advantages of being well-built and sturdy, to say the least.\nIt felt uncomfortable yet sensible when Prowl suddenly looked him over, almost as if he was expecting a clone to be there instead of his true self. But one could never be sure when an enemy was involved.\nDinobot catches the cloaking device with ease as Prowl tossed it to him, then looking it over in his clawed hands before transforming into robot mode, knowing that he would need to be in this state if he were to pull off this mission. \nIt was a simple device, nothing too ornate and complicated. Which meant that he would be the luckiest bot on the planet if it lasted 2 mega-cycles. But he hadn�t expected Prowl to grab the best supplies he could find, just something that would do the trick. And he had.\nThe second piece of equipment in which Prowl handed him was something in which he had not expected, something that he thought he would never have to wear. As he looked it over more closely he noticed it�s function but still thought of rejecting the device, not liking anything near his face what so ever. But he knew that they just might need it, having to communicate within the enemy base without being heard.\nDinobot had to commend Prowl on his choice of supplied, but he also had to curse him for communicating through the com-link earlier. For all they knew that Alliance could have picked up on Prowl�s last transmission, Dinobot�s coded one not being able to be picked up.\nBut this was no time to worry about such things; they had to get in and out as quickly as possible if they were to save the two fembots within. And slag knew what could be happening to them at this very moment.\nDinobot snarled and narrowed his optics as he looked at the device again, still not liking the idea of looking like something out of a poorly made science fiction movie. But there was no real choices in this matter either put on the equipment and go in or simply stay out here and hope for the base. His choice obviously being that to go in, not willing to leave the safety of Tavatron up to one bot alone. For, then there would be guaranteed failure.\nClicking the cloaking device to the side of his waist and hanging the silence device from it he then caught the other two pieces of equipment from Prowl, simply loading them into a compartment in his back for when they were needed, not even knowing if Tavatron was in any condition to wear the silencer. The cloaking device was a must and perhaps even the silencer but if she were unconscious then there would be no need for the second. But he kept it handy just in case.\nDinobot then looked off in the direction of the Alliance base, listening to the instructions in which Prowl relayed to him. But then it suddenly hit him, wouldn�t the Alliance predict such a move? To simply sneak in the front door. They must have cloaking detectors in such a place, their cover blown even before they had a chance.\nHe looked back towards Prowl, a determined look on his face. *\n\n� Negative. We would surely be detected by high level scanners if we were to enter by the front entrance. Even with the cloaking devices we would be detected.�\n\n*Dinobot then looked back towards the enemy base, knowing that there was no other real way to enter. Guessing that they would have to take their chances with the entrance scanners if they were to succeed. *\n\n� However, I can detect no further entrance in which would give better chances of success.�\n\n* He kept his optics in the direction of the Alliance ship, scanning over just what sorts of scanning relays were located around their chosen entrance. They were a simple sort, though only having less then a minuet to scan and then simply going through the data himself.\nThe scanners were not what he had expected for such a ship, their fields did not cover the whole of the entrance�only three quarters.\nThat could be useful knowledge, simply slipping in with their backs against the left wall where the relay did not reach. From there they would be fine, as long as they did not bump into anyone.\nThe cloaking devices made them invisible to any bot, but then did not make then as this as air.\nDinobot growled as he then began to move towards the Alliance base, knowing that he would have to activate the silencer before he got there. But from this distance they would be safe to speak out loud for another cycle or two.\nHis voice was stern but not really commanding, more of a sure and determined tone then hostile. *\n\n� Their scanning relays only cover three quarters of the entrench, the left side is free from such scans. We will move in there.�\n\n* It was then that he activated the cloaking device and slipped in the silencer, now coming within the detection distance of the enemy ship. *\n\n� Keep your back to the wall.�\n \n*Though Prowl would be able to hear and see him, no other could.\nHe snarled as she base came into view, a long mission ahead of them. *\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
