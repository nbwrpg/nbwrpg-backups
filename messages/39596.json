As it did and the energy barette came near \nHellpeon, he quickly twirled off to the side and smirked as he stood \nin the sand. His body began to pulse somewhat as his body began to \ncrackle with energy, his eyes began to glow red and his body an eery \nblack. \n\nHellpeon: &quot;You seem somewhat worthy of a fighter... but play time is \nover...&quot;\n\nWith that said Hellpeon began to gather a large amount of Chaochitan \nenergy into his palms, energy swirling into the orb as bits of the \nenergy from Hacha&#39;s remains flew into the ball as well. Then the ball \nseemed to begin to draw solar energy and evergy generated by the \nslight wind, and perhaps some energy from Ultimo.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; Ultimo took a step back &quot;Energy Barrette&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Online&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A long barrette of pure energy so condense it made a solid able to \nchange in shape.  Ultimo hit the sabre to the side then parried by \nhaving the  barrette extend towards Hellpeons sword hand.  With his \nother hand he threw  his shield in front of the blast but it knocked \nhim back a bit from the close range, also obscurring the attack of \nhis barrete causing Ultimo to swing his arm up the extended barrette \ngoing straight at Hellpeons neck from the chest area.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And as the flame came towards him it was quickly repeled by that \nbarrier of \n&gt; &gt; Chaochtian energy. And once again Hellpeon tried to skewer Ultimo \nwith his \n&gt; &gt; sabre before releasing a large blast at him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n\n"}}
