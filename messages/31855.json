Then, his optics pick \n&gt; up a large object, that seems to be destroying bots. He laughs to \n&gt; himself, &lt;easy target&gt;... or so he thinks. He fires four particle \n&gt; blasts at the bot, Prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rampage growls, and continues firing on Astral, and his party.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorclaw sees the perfect opertunity. Khonkolor was looking up, \n&gt; and firing at Divebomb. Razorclaw puts all of his effort of the \n&gt; moment into his action, he fires eight concussion blasts at \n&gt; Khonkolor.\n\n\n"}}
