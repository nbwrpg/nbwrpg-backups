You seem to want the =\r\neasy way out of everything. I&#39;m sorry but life does not usually work that w=\r\nay. Sometimes you must do something with great difficulty in order to achei=\r\nve your goals. And trusting Perceptor will be difficult for you but he is r=\r\newarding us with his kowledge and that alone can be priceless.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His ton=\r\ne similar to that of Optimus Prime, Tucson Prime tries his hardest to be pa=\r\ntient with the young maximal, knowing that he too, had been that young vorn=\r\ns ago.\n\nCheetor glanced over at Perceptor and then back at Tuscon, his opti=\r\ncs\ndistrustful, &quot;He is a Predacon, and he probrabaly helped come up with\nwh=\r\natever turned Rodimus, and now we are to trust him?&quot; Cheetor shook\nhis head=\r\n, &quot;How do you know that what he&#39;s doing is not some trap for\nus? That he&#39;s =\r\nnot looking at some other angle?&quot;\n\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We have to connect him to vi=\r\ntal support&quot;said sadly the male &quot;If we like to\n&gt; remove this... beings off =\r\nhim. Let&#39;s go to the lab, this must be done at\n&gt; hand&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The old Autobot =\r\nwas glad that Elita was sleep right now.\n\nSilverbolt nodded at Kup as he tu=\r\nrned to go towards the Lab, &quot;Come\non.&quot; he said, putting a comforting arm ar=\r\nound Kup, &quot;I know he was a\nclose friend of yours. Santon and Bump are among=\r\n the best we have, and\nLegacy . . . well he has a lot of knowledge about ma=\r\nny things.&quot;\n\nThey brgan walking towards the Lab, where Nightshift, Rat Trap=\r\n,\nLegacy, Bump and Santon were . . .\n\n&gt; Night Shift quickly assists in taki=\r\nng care of Rodimus as Rat Trap tries to get the CR chambers functionable fo=\r\nr use. After hearing Tucson Prime&#39;s words, he quickly looks over to Percept=\r\nor and wistles his way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey, you, Ex Pred, I&#39;m gonna need your smarts=\r\n over here, if I&#39;m gonna configure the CR chamber properly. I don&#39;t wanna m=\r\ness this up, especially when Rodimus is involved.&quot;\n\nAs Nightshift and Rat T=\r\nrap get to the CR chamber, Legacy, Bump and\nSanton are in the lab,  Legacy =\r\nis setting the wrapped up form of\nLegacy on a table.\n\nSanton, who is nearly=\r\n as large and bulky as Legacy turned to look at\nRat Trap and Nightshift, &quot;W=\r\ne&#39;re going to be closing off this room as\nwe work on restoring Rodimus prim=\r\ne.&quot; he said, refering to the lab to\nthe side of the CR chamber. &quot;Once we&#39;re=\r\n done we will need a fully\npower CR chamber ready for his use.&quot;\n\n&gt; Quick St=\r\nride guides Tucson into the Ark, not forgetting about his visual impairment=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Sir, whenever the repairs are complete on Rodimus, I bel=\r\nieve Tucson Prime could stand for a few himself. And so could his visual se=\r\nnsors.&quot;\n\nElder stood as Quickstride and Tuscon came into the Ark and came o=\r\nver\nto help bring him in. &quot;His optic sensors have gone back out again?&quot;\nEld=\r\ner shook his head, &quot;I was afraid of that. He will need medical\nattention as=\r\n well.&quot; Elder glanced over at a chair that he guides\nTuscon towards, &quot;I wis=\r\nh Rhinox was here, but he and the Dinobots are\noff still looking for Primal=\r\n.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
