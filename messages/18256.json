One more false accusation, and you&#39;re GONE.\n&gt; Got that? Now, I took the time out of my lunch half-hour to search\n&gt; through the posts and get KSL&#39;s last three that had firing. Please\n&gt; review:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot/Nemesis Enforcer/Dark One:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot watches as a few autoguns open fire on Sharpedge and\n&gt; Jeststorm,\n&gt; Scattershot descending a missile blast sending him plumetting into\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer blocked the blasts with his wings, which were badly\n&gt; damaged.\n&gt;  He fired off twenty-five rapid blasts at Jestorm, and 10 rapid optic\n&gt; blasts\n&gt; off at Jeststorm.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One, now turned around, fired off two missiles at Sharpedge.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Now, that&#39;s 25 rapid fire and 10 optics, and then two missiles.\n&gt; Anything wrong with that?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One/Scattershot/Nemesis Enforcer:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One barrel rolls, his wings getting clipped, though he still wa\n&gt; sin the\n&gt; air.  He awaited the chance to fire again as he started to turn\n&gt; around.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot sidestepped in the air again, barely dodging the\n&gt; missiles, the\n&gt; explosions sending him flying backwards.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer flew up, a few blasts hitting his legs and feet.  He\n&gt; fired\n&gt; off twenty-five rapid laser blasts from his rifle at Jestorm,\n&gt; followed by\n&gt; twelve rapid optic blasts at Jestorm&#39;s sternum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - 25 rapid fire lasers and 12 rapid fire optic blasts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot/Dark One/Shockwave:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer blocks with his wings, but is sent flying back,\n&gt; slamming to\n&gt; the ground,  firing 10 rapid optic blasts at Jetstorm&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot yelled as the missiles came, twirling through the air\n&gt; letting\n&gt; them pass, keeping a cool composure on the outside, the inside he was\n&gt; getting\n&gt; beat.  The shockwave of the missiles had almost made him lose his\n&gt; balance in\n&gt; the air and crash.\n&gt;\n&gt; But he was able to stay up.  Reaching into subspace, he pulled out\n&gt; two\n&gt; grenades, one for each hand.  He dropped both grenades down at\n&gt; Sharpedge,\n&gt; both explosives set to go off on impact.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One got a target lock on Diskus, but saw that Nemesis Enforcer\n&gt; was\n&gt; nearly beaten in his current situation.  Jetstorm (Dark One doesn&#39;t\n&gt; know who\n&gt; he is though) looked like a formidable opponent though.  Changing his\n&gt; course,\n&gt; he fired twenty-five rapid laser blasts off at Jestorm&#39;s back.\n&gt;\n&gt; The black jet fighter continued with on course, his missile launchers\n&gt; arming.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------\n&gt;\n&gt; Shockwave stepped out of the forest, looking at the battle and\n&gt; carnage.  Even\n&gt; if he could&#39;ve smiled, he wouldn&#39;t have.  His white right hand\n&gt; transformed\n&gt; into a long barrel.  The &#39;Decepticon&#39; looked around for a target,\n&gt; Alliance or\n&gt; otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - 10 rapid optic blasts, 2 grenades, 25 rapid laser shots.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, if you&#39;d notice, Unitron takes falling as an action. So unlike\n&gt; you or me, when one of his bots falls, or even turns, he waits for\n&gt; the next post to say it. Example:\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot sidestepped in the air again, barely dodging the\n&gt; missiles, the\n&gt; explosions sending him flying backwards.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; If that was my char, Scattershot would have jumped up, or regained\n&gt; balance and returned fire. But he didn&#39;t. I copy-pasted these emails\n&gt; in a hurry (I&#39;m running out of time), but if you can find ANY others\n&gt; that break the rule, forward away.\n&gt;\n&gt; One more false accusation though, and I&#39;m either going to moderate or\n&gt; remove you. I&#39;m getting sick of this. People have to learn to take\n&gt; defeat without whining.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. If you can&#39;t find any moding emails from Unitron, you will\n&gt; appologize to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
