She was through thinking about her dead friend and a new subject had popped into mind, after killing Megatron...what would she do?\nShe had thought long and hard about it but had come up empty clawed. The Maximals didn&#39;t seem to bad, besides the fact that she thought that their leader was either a coward and just plain under trained, the Predacons...that was just a joke! She had learned her lesson about the Predacons, they were cheats, murderers and scoundrels and she wanted nothing to do with them, but the Alliance. In order to become an Alliance member she would have to end up trying to kill both Maximals and Predacons...that wasn&#39;t her style.\nSo in plain, being Neutral was the best thing to stick with so far...so far.\nCarnage sighed as she came to a middle sized lake, she wandered over to the edge of it and dipped her snout in for a drink. The water was cool and she drank well, but just as she was about to pull her snout from the water she happened to look up and...\nShe saw Teltoli conversing with a Dragon and the Fuzor she had seen back at the Ark. (SilverBolt.)\nCarnage looked at the dragon carefully, for some particular reason she had a bad feeling about it.\nShe slowly backed into the brush in which she had come and slowly began to make her way towards the group, the Maxtrix forbid if Teltoli ever got hurt...she was her friend and that was the last thing that she wanted to happen.\nIt wasn&#39;t long before Carnage had made her way all the way behind the group and then crouched low in the bushes, she evened her breath to a low tolerance and didn&#39;t move a muscle. There was no chance in the Pit that any of them could know that she was there.\nIn truth she was only 50 metres away from the dragonbot and she didn&#39;t plan to get any closer, or hoped that it didn&#39;t come to her getting closer.\nShe waited, she couldn&#39;t hear their conversation so it couldn&#39;t really be called ease dropping.\nCarnage set her head on her front limbs and settled down, all things would come in time.\nBut until she was sure that the dragon wasn&#39;t threatening she wasn&#39;t about to leave either.\nHer friend&#39;s very life could be depending on it.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
