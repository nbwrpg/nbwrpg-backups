He comically shakes the snow from his paws as he walks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Now I know why cats hate water.  Talk about cold feet.  Slag, I sure got\n&gt; those all right.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s only going to get colder.&quot; WOLFGANG said as he chuckled from the\nrear as he bound up the path after them in his wolf beast mode, his\ntail wagging eagerly.\n\nAnd it did get colder as they climbed up the path as it swung around\nthe back side of the mountain. At times it got incredibly narrow where\neach one had to walk carefully, one after another, at others it was\nwide enough that POLAR CLAW and NIGHTSHIFT could walk shoulder to\nshoulder.\n\nAfter several hours though they finally make it to the top of the pass\nwhere PROWL was waiting for them. He was shaking his head, clearing\nsome snow that had settled on it, it was beginning to snow lightly\nhere at the higher elevation.\n\nOver the other side of the mountain there was the long path leading\nback down and a large beautiful lake. It&#39;s crystal clear waters\nperfectly reflecting the skies and landscape around it. In the center\nof it, sitting on what appeared to be a small island sat that tall\ntower that was CRYONOSIS.\n\n&quot;Look.&quot; PROWL said as he pointed with a wing over at the tower.\n\nLooking at the lake itself hundreds of feet back down the mountain,\none could see where there use to be a bridge that crossed the lake\nfrom the tower to the mainland, but it was largely destroyed. Only\nsmall sections of it remained standing precariously out of the water.\nIt could not be used to cross it.\n\nThen there was the tower itself. It looked to be made of some sort of\nblue and white materials, stone and metal that were once fused\nharmoniously together. Now however there were cracks and holes that\nmarred its once pristine surface as if blasted apart by weapons fire.\n\nEven the defensive weapons that had just recently fired at the shuttle\nlooked damaged even if still functional as they swayed in the winds\nthat were picking up.\n\n&quot;Slag&quot; said the normally silent RAMULUS as the snow was beginning to\nfall a little harder.\n\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
