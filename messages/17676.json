She pulled a quill out and ran towards \nRamulus as fast as she could.  She went to stab Ramulus in the chest. \nShe quickly drew another quill and went to stab him with her other \nquill. &quot;YOU DISOBEYED MASTER PREBON&#39;S COMMANDS! NOW YOU WILL PAY!&quot;\nShe attemped to stab him repeatedly. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Smokescreen/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus&#39; eyes narrow as he watches Prebon walk away from Spears. \nThis was \n&gt; perfect... A slightly non-Maximal plan formed into his head in a \nsecond.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as Prebon stepped away, Ramulus&#39; hand went to the anti-chip \nweapon at \n&gt; his waist, pulling it out faster than the optic could see and \nfiring it at \n&gt; Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;ATTACK!
