As I said, this might not please you very \n&gt; much, but neither am I hot to the idea. I was sent here to get \nyou, \n&gt; alive or dead. What I suggest is that you leave, in exile. You can \n&gt; still have contacts with your crew, which I do not necessarily \nwish \n&gt; to see evicted, but the main thing is that you are not on Earth \n&gt; anymore. We will not chase you or anything, unless you come back. \nIf \n&gt; you wish, you can negotiate to accomodate yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dreadplague looked at Tyrael with a struck air, then at Darkangel. \n&gt; Her voice came out so low that only her fellow warrior could hear \nher.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dread: Is he crazy?
