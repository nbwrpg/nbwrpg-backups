His suspension absorbs the shocks of \n&gt; the uneven terrain but his engine proves quiet enough so conversation was \n&gt; not lost during the drive.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be sure we are kept well guarded Perceptor. I&#39;d hate for anyone to \n&gt; fall into harm&#39;s way. And to answer your question Perceptor, her origin is \n&gt; somewhat like yours.  But like Talon, you too have risen from darkness. \n&gt; That is what is most important, rising from darkness and into the light. \n&gt; When we get back to the Ark, I too, will drive into the light, as soon as \n&gt; my optical sensors are brought back online permanently.  So good news \n&gt; Talon, you won&#39;t have to drive me for much longer hopefully.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He thinks for a moment about his disability, and the fact that Perceptor \n&gt; too, was blind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking this question Perceptor, but, if we could \n&gt; help you to regain your sight, would you allow us to do so?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon/Perceptor::\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;So&quot;said dryly the predacon&quot;hadnt she a maximal origin? have some \n&gt;&gt; maximals a\n&gt;&gt; diferent origins than autobots?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What you mean?&quot;said Talon while she use the wheel to lead Tucson to \n&gt;&gt; their\n&gt;&gt; destiny.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Some Predacons have diferent ancestor of Decepticons, due that they are\n&gt;&gt; carfully watched byt Tripeduc Council&quot;replied Perceptor&quot;due that \n&gt;&gt; situation\n&gt;&gt; in Ark must be monitored carfully for everyone&#39;s sake... i cant say\n&gt;&gt; Predacon&#39;s now &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sandy&quot; &lt;magicquartz@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, June 21, 2010 10:48 PM\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Into the LIGHT!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A bond was forming between Tucson and Perceptor, a powerful bond that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; predacon could ever break, the bond of friendship and compassion. He \n&gt;&gt; &gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also listened to Lord Elder and thought it was best to allow him to do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what he needed to do.  With Tallon and Perceptor in his cab, he was \n&gt;&gt; &gt; more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than content and rolls at a good reasonable speed with the two of them \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his cab.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Thank you Perceptor, I&#39;m honored to have you with us.  Now, this is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I call valuable, having friends among you through the best and worst of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; times, knowing that your comrades are willing to make a great effort to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; preserve what is most precious, is something even the most priceless of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; articles can never hold an ounce of wealth to.  Tallon, after hearing \n&gt;&gt; &gt; how\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you became one of us, it honors me to see how much you have evolved and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for that my compassion for you will never die.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment, about Hydras, and gathers his words carefully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I doubt very much that Hydras has any capacity to feel the compassion\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that all of us are capable of feeling.  I know that will be a downfall \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him, because without compassion there can be no loyalty, no honor, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; most certainly no assurance of victory.  And without those elements, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doubt very much he will be able to hold his place on the upper hand for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; much longer.  We have to gather our forces, come together as one, and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then will we be able to take back what is rightfully ours and preserve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what is remaining of our planet.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With his words he comes to a slow stop.  His sonar systems could only\n&gt;&gt; &gt; carry him to a certain range, but then realizes that he&#39;s out of range \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; proper echolocation system function.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Tallon, I&#39;m out of range for my sonar system.  Could you take my wheel\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for me?  I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone or any of you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson opens the passenger&#39;s side door for Perceptor, hearing that \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on that side. He was happy to have passengers, because to him, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; having\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comrades around was a great comfort.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As Tuscon opened his door to let Talon, Perceptor and Lord Elder in,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder just waved Tuscon on, &quot;No, I will need to talk Cheetor alone.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just because he has yet to come to know Perceptor here, does not give\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him leave to talk to you as he wishes is. I will pull him aside to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; talk to him. I&#39;ll get back to you.&quot; Elder chuckled, &quot;Cheetor should be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; okay, Ramulus is the one that may need more time than most. He has not\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; been one to trust anyone.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder turned aside to catch up with Cheetor who was walking off to one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; side, although sullen, still had a good pace. Elder was forced to jog\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for a moment and lay a comforting hand on the young Maximal&#39;s shoulder\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and pull him to a stop. The two began walking together at a somewhat\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slower pace talking in low tones.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
