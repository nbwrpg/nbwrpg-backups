First off, my list.\n\nBrix-Maximal\nFliq(this will be Octociz&#39; new name when he gets his new beast mode)-\nMaximal\nVulois-neutral\nTerminess-dead-suicide(planted explosives)\n\nNext I need a clairification. I know that their are 2 factions of \nPreds, and Megatron is trying to unite them all, but I&#39;ve been gone \nfor awhile(and will be gone next week. Sorry!) but are their two \nfactions of MAXIMALS? Are the Maxis at the Cybertronian Fire one and \nThe Ark the other? Please clairify.\n\nOne last thing: welcome back JP.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nVulois&#39; mind snapped back into his head. He couldn&#39;t believe he just \ndid that. In a few moments, that funny feeling ws gone and he was \nfully in the embassy. He was happy that The Matrix was giving him \nadvice, and was also hopeful that Rex would take into consideration \nwhat he said/ He decided he needed some frsh air.\n\nWhen he stepped outside, he saw some figures heading towards him. Or \nwere they? They were too far away to tell if they were coming to him \nor passing over him. But like all things, time will tell.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n&#92;\n\nOctociz looked at Ramulus. This was it. New body time. He just hoped \nRamulus could do this.\n\n&quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to give control to Brix and go off line. He is going \nto open the chest hatch and remove my spark, and place it in this pod \nand shut it. I&#39;ve programmed it to make me a protoform once the lid \nis shut. But&#39;s that&#39;s just as far I could go. Brix doesn&#39;t know \nmachines, and the automatic DNA Scanner isn&#39;t working. You have to \nuse these mangled controls to activate it. Ready?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
