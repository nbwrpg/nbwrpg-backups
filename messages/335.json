She tryed a number of times but she couldn&#39;t manage to\n&gt; catch a meal for her rumballing stomach!\n&gt; Rage then looked up at the structure that sat a fair distance away and\n&gt; sighed, perhaps there was easier food there?\n&gt; She got down to all fours and began to walk, her chest had begun to hurt\n&gt; from the waight of her back and walking on all fours helped ease it. She\n&gt; ambled along, looking from left to right as she walked towards the metal\n&gt; structure.\n&gt; Prehaps supper would be soon?*\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Good friends, school spirit, hair-dos you&#39;d like to forget.\n&gt; Classmates.com has them all.
