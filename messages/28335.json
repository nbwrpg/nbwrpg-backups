He runs a quick internal check, making sure that \nthe damage circuits were nothing major, and then activates the \nboosters on his left side. The ones on his right, along with most of \nhis right side, were missing due to his missing let.\n\nThe boosters cause Firearm to spin through the air, smashing into the \nground on the same stop that Beastbox had ended up.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Slag, this gonna hurt Beastbox&quot; Beastbox frantically grabs \nwhatever he can\n&gt; from the inside of Firarm (Wires chips, you name it), moving his \narms\n&gt; around quickly, and as he notices the speed of the ground \naproaching him,\n&gt; he tries to jump out from underneath, ripping whatever he grabs. He \ntries\n&gt; to use his feet (like hands because he is a gorrilla) and his hands \nto\n&gt; stradle around to the top side of Firearm&#39;s tank mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Yanshosh, you go ahead and tell me if any of this works, okay.\n\n\n"}}
