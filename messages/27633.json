Also, there are two airborne Maximals.\n\n::Prowl/Firearm::\n\nProwl had no trouble swirling out of the way of most of the shots \nfired at him, but several laser bolts hit him. He didn&#39;t slow down as \nhe flew right above Wildrider, leaving two missiles to head for the \nbot. Prowl flew back toward the sky, ready to make another path.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm shielded himself with his arms, various laser shots and a \nshot from Triggerhappy hitting him. He growled, feeling the stinging \nof his bleeding armor.\n\nFirearm smiled, watching Wildrider land. He swooped down toward the \nbot and muttered an activation code, transforming into his tank mode \nand flying down quick at the enemy. His heavy armor easily took the \nshots meant for it.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wildrider sees Triggerhappy being blasted, &quot;You want I should help \nhim, or\n&gt; do you wanna&quot; he asks to Drag Strip. &quot;Lets just gut them&quot; Drag \nStrip yells\n&gt; turning around, making a huge hole in the ground, and speeds towards\n&gt; Symphony to ram her. Meanwhile as hes going, his canons turn around \nand\n&gt; fire at prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wildrider lands and opens fire into the air towards the ariborn \nmaximal,\n&gt; again filling the sky with lasers.\n\n\n"}}
