He modifies his dorsal gun to nail\n&gt; gun mode and\n&gt; &gt;   fires 9 nails at Breakdown, 8 at Dark One, and 8 at Astral.  he\n&gt; sees Klant\n&gt; &gt;   crawling back to him::\n&gt; &gt;   Torca: You alright Klant? if not, get into a CR chamber, because\n&gt; you look\n&gt; &gt;   pretty beaten up.\n&gt; &gt;   ::Sky Lynx flies to escape the fireballs, but one hits him\n&gt; anyway.  He only\n&gt; &gt;   gets hit by one ion disk.  he dodges the shots from Ares.  He\n&gt; fired 2 missles\n&gt; &gt;   from one gun at Pyro, 1 missle from the other at Manterror, and 1\n&gt; missle at\n&gt; &gt;   Ares.  Ratchet transformed to robot mode and escaped most of the\n&gt; shots,\n&gt; &gt;   thoguh some hit him in the arms.  Ratchet jumped out of the way\n&gt; of the connon\n&gt; &gt;   blast, and ended up being hit by some of Fenox&#39;s laser bolts.  He\n&gt; fired 15\n&gt; &gt;   shots from each of his blasters at Scavenger and launched 1\n&gt; explosive tusk\n&gt; &gt;   blades at Sixshot, and one at Fenox.  Sideswipe escapes the sword\n&gt; blade.  He\n&gt; &gt;   got hit by 2 stinger missles and 5 optic blasts(between Injector\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;   Bumblebee). He fired 25 shots at Demon Wulf, 1 missle at\n&gt; Injector, and 1\n&gt; &gt;   missle at Bumblebee.  Orion destroyed the missles with ones of\n&gt; his own and\n&gt; &gt;   fired a missle, hoping to hit Double Punch.  He evaded the shots\n&gt; fr! om! Ares\n&gt; &gt;   and fired a missle at him.  He escapes the darts and fires 25\n&gt; rapid fire\n&gt; &gt;   optic blasts at Starlight::\n&gt; &gt;         eGroups Sponsor\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Click Here!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
