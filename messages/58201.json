It was a boring night, he \nhad \n&gt; &gt;solved all their problems and now the captain had been having him \n&gt; &gt;repair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting \nanother, \n&gt; &gt;he quickly sneaked out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill \nwhich \n&gt; &gt;was right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything \n&gt; &gt;interesting.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes to \n&gt; &gt;another mountain about 10 clicks south.
