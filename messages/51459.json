He then pulls Nightlight close to \n&gt;him, resting her head on his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rodimus Prime: I wish that these wars could end once and for all. After I \n&gt;destroyed Unicron and sent Galvatron to the other side of the galaxy in \n&gt;2005, I announced the &quot;End of the Cybertronion Wars.&quot; I actually believed \n&gt;it then. But I wasn&#39;t able to keep the Decepticons down and here we are \n&gt;today. Stuck in the past on Earth, Maximals and Predacons fighting as I saw \n&gt;Autobots and Decepticons do so long ago.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN.
