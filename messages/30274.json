He flies \nup from\n&gt; the trees, and in to plain view of all the Decepticons. Looking as \nMajestic\n&gt; as he can he questions, &quot;Dont you recognize me Motormaster? Ive \ncome back,\n&gt; to rule&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster dosent get it. His jaw hangs down low, his mouth wide \nopen from\n&gt; shock. They had not found the body of Megatron yet, to bring to \nlife. What\n&gt; was this, some kind off Maximal trick.\n\n\n"}}
