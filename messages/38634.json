The weapon is here because I think you might \nbe trying to trick me. Maybe you&#39;re really with Deemos, and want to \ntrap me here and kill me. Sorry about that, I don&#39;t really believe \nthat, I just don&#39;t know what else to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: Maybe we should just offer to help the Chosen Mafia out in \nexchange for them not trying to hurt us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarge: Are you out of your mind, boy? As soon as we have our backs \nturned Deemos will rip our sparks out through our eyes!\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow: I have to agree on this one. That&#39;s the stupidest idea I&#39;ve \never heard. If we try to side with them, they&#39;ll just wait for the \nopportunity to kill us all. If that happens, I won&#39;t be here, because \nI will have already left. I don&#39;t want to die until I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve \ndone everything I can to insure your safety, but if you want to \ncondemn yourself, Perplex, how about YOU be the one who ask \nthem? &quot;Hi, Chosen Mafia, I&#39;m Perplex, and I was wondering--&quot; BANG! \nI&#39;m sure we can get along without you Perplex, so go on. If that&#39;s \nwhat you want to do, ask them for an alliance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarge: Well said, soldier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: You&#39;re wrong, Arrow. I think that we can really side with \ntheir team the Alliance. It would mean joining the evil side, but we \ncan be rid of their attacks forever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarge: Boy, Deemos doesn&#39;t stop till he gets what he wants. If we \nside with the Alliance, then they&#39;ll kill us and walk off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: What&#39;s wrong with you anyway?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarge: You don&#39;t know how tough my life&#39;s been, boy.

Not a savage grudge, but \na law \n&gt;     announced. We will not kill like ancient transformeres.  His so \n&gt;     called, lackeys, also have a death sentence for protecting \naiding a \n&gt;     fellons escape.

This is all because I let him go the first time \nhe \n&gt;     &gt; attacked.  As \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; for you Sarge, I have just as much reason to kill him.  In \nour \n&gt;     last \n&gt;     &gt; fight I \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; lost an arm and a leg defending others.  I nearly died \nbecause \n&gt;     &gt; there were \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; bots in the battle that shouldn&#39;t have been there.  I \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt;     care \n&gt;     &gt; less \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; about his lackeys.  Now then, let&#39;s get to the meeting so \nwe can \n&gt;     &gt; finish it \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; and start planning our attack.&quot;  He stands tall glaring at \nSarge.\n\n\n"}}
