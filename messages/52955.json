I am\npositive that the Maximals here can&#39;t resist us, but I would like to\noffer a proposal simply to show them the honor they deserve. They are\ngood fighters after all and they deserve our respect. If they refuse,\nthen we shall proceed. But with Hydras still around, it is likely our\nboth factions are going to have the same goal. If we destroy him now,\nthere will only be two major powers here: Maximals and Tripredacus. Is\nthat a risk we can withstand?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kaiser::\n&gt;        He shrugs and looks at Blackheart doubtfully.  &quot;He has never\nfaced the \n&gt; kind of force we have gathered here.  He is no match for two\nTripredacus \n&gt; generals and a field commander (I forgot Tyrael&#39;s rank... oops).
