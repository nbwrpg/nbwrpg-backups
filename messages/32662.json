Im just gonna give you a summary though. Astroblast \nlanded, and Megatron, Motormaster and Switchblade exited him. \nWildrider told Megatron they had found this Decepticon (Cepta). \nMegatron orders the Decepticons to all stay here and wait for \nreinforcements, except for Cepta and himself, who wer to enter \nAstroblast. In all the excitement rAuq took off though, so If you do \ndecide to get on, you will have to wait till he lands.\n\n\n\n"}}
