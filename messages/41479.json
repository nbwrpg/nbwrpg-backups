It alerts Zardus of it.\n\nStill at the meeting, Zardus silently replies to the Iron Fist, telling it to analize the transmission&#39;s format and forward it to him. He looks at Orchestra, waiting for a reply from the other bot.\n \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; The minion worked hard in his lab. The base creaked from non use and \n&gt; ignorement. he was disgusted by it. If his master had been here he would   \n&gt; have never let it happen. The body was almost complete. It now only needed \n&gt; its fule. The blood of a few hero bots to bring it to full power. He felt the \n&gt; dark spark&#39;s precense. &quot;Its almost ready master. Do you wish to have all the \n&gt; weapons you had before?&quot; The dark sent a obvious yes to the bots frightened \n&gt; face. The dark spark pulsed over and over. He would soon be back and he would \n&gt; set fire to the entire world if he had to to bring about his enemies. But \n&gt; first he had to make a few allies. Brother Megatron had already been \n&gt; contacted. But another one he would soon need to speak with was Zardus. he \n&gt; sent a typed message to his opticals. For he yet to have form so a visual \n&gt; seems impossible. The typed message would read. &quot;Great leader of the \n&gt; alliance. I have never met you in person but we have spoken. I have long been \n&gt; very impressed by your skills as a leader. But defending the maximals I was \n&gt; quite surprised by that. Non the less I am very interested to work with you. \n&gt; Unfortunatly I am not complete but I will be soon. I will contact you then. \n&gt; Until then good luck.&quot; The message ended and the dark spark waited for his \n&gt; body to be finished. For when it was the world would never be the same again\n\n\n"}}
