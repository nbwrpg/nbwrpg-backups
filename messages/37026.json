He prepares to \nopen fire again when he hears the whistling sound of missiles and \nturns around to see Incarcinators right infront of him. All three \ncollide with him and cause a massive explosion to come about then \nsome autogun blasts and all 25 of Atillas shots strike the energy \nbeing while it is surrounded in the flame of the missiles. As the \nsmoke and fire clear, Hellpeon  seemingly floats there with a huge \nhole in his stomach as well as some in his arms and legs. The beast \nroars as it outstretches its arms and the wound in his stomach begins \nto regenerate hastily as the holes in his arms dissapear all \ntogether. The beast looks to Attilla as its eyes glow a bright red. \nQuickly the beast flys over to him and opens fire on him with 10 \nbeams of chaochitan energy until he is in a fairly close distance...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Autoguns continue fireing at the invaders.\n\n\n\n"}}
