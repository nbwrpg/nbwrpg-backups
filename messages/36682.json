The Photon torpedos detonated on impact shaking the\nbase, Ignatius was nearly paniced by the nightmares and the shaking base. He\nrushed over to the computer, &quot;Redirect all eccess shield energy into the\nrepulsor shields, direct it at that ship.&quot; His orders would leave the base\nas a potential target for the Predacons if that much energy was expended.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think so Ig!&quot; a voice called out over the speakers of the base.\n&quot;That would be a major tactical mistake..&quot;\n\nThe voice was familiar to the insane Trainer, it was one he hadn&#39;t heard in\nages, since it had ceased on the planet Hydrus 4. The fifth member of\nPrebons old unit  was in the computer. Prebon must have downloaded his spark\ninto the computer before they&#39;d left. &quot;I&#39;m taking over from here.&quot; he said\nscanning the situation. Ignatius tried to override the computer but was met\nwith unexpected force. The Stasis field changed frequency, it now held\nIgnatius trapped with the others.\n\nThe Repulsor shields let out a wave drawing energy from the very torpedos\nthat were trying to destroy it. the explosion  shook the trainer base even\nmore,  disabling the repulsor array. Now the Autoguns and variable freq\nshield were thier only defenses left. Autoguns continued fireing at the\nViolator. They had trouble locking on target so they couldn&#39;t aim for\nanything critical. The only thing they could do was aim for where the\nweapons fire was comeing from.\n\nOther weapons struck the shields. Two autoguns turned and fired three shots\neach three at Starscream and three at Incarcinator\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Legendarynemasis@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 06, 2001 10:47 AM\nSubject: Re: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\n\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have a few serious questions/comments concerning this post.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #1- isn&#39;t it illegal to fire eight missles/ procectiles from 1\n&gt; weapon?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #2- Cyanide is in a Stasis field so he wouldn&#39;t be able to scream\n&gt; anything.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #3 Theres already 1 seemingly indestructable ship in the battle, is\n&gt; it legal to bring in a second?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #4- The Trainer base has it&#39;s shields up so how could you teleport\n&gt; anything through them?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #5- I thought Teleportation was outlawed because of the abuse of\n&gt; power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #6- can I intercept the extra missles to lower the firepower down to\n&gt; legal standards?\n&gt;\n&gt; #1 theres 8 laser cannons on the violator. Therefore 8 singular blasts\n&gt; are legal.\n&gt;\n&gt; #2 Ill change that\n&gt;\n&gt; #3 both ships are going down soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; #4 Its a beam of light it goes through the shield like sunlight does\n&gt;\n&gt; #5 Its not teleportation its an advanced transport system.

A door opened below the ship and\n&gt; the scorpion\n&gt; &gt;   tank quickly entered as did Gemini 1 and two. Vile turns to Gemini\n&gt; 1 and 2\n&gt; &gt;   and growls.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Cyanide may be caught but now these fools will all be\n&gt; destroyed!\n&gt; &gt;   Goodbye Cyanide you haved risked yourself for us all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   And with that Vile opened a small compartment at his control\n&gt; console and\n&gt; &gt;   pressed it. Immeidately two Mega photon torpedoes, six photon\n&gt; torpedoes, four\n&gt; &gt;   laser cannons, the four multi phase laser cannons, and both mega\n&gt; cannons,\n&gt; &gt;   shooting 3 shots each opened fire on the triaer base followed by a\n&gt; massive\n&gt; &gt;   blast fired at the base from the Vile cannon. As this happened\n&gt; Vile shook his\n&gt; &gt;   head and began to walk away when the Violator was hammered by 8\n&gt; massive\n&gt; &gt;   blasts causing the ship to shake violently and throw Vile and\n&gt; Methos from\n&gt; &gt;   where they were standing. Vile then got up and growls as Gemini 2\n&gt; rushed to\n&gt; &gt;   his console and brought up a visual of a massive portal, with an\n&gt; infecticon\n&gt; &gt;   ship exiting it and hovering over the trainer base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Infecticons... prepare to open fire on that ship with\n&gt; everything we\n&gt; &gt;   have.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   On the Infecticon ship two black beings seemingly made of energy\n&gt; look at two\n&gt; &gt;   orbs in front of them, one displaying Predacon and X-Predacon\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt;   signatures as well as some unknown types. One orb begins to glow\n&gt; as in the\n&gt; &gt;   center of the large dark control room a bright circle of light\n&gt; appears. As\n&gt; &gt;   this happens, a column of light shines striaght down and into the\n&gt; trainer\n&gt; &gt;   base(dont worry this isnt an attack) and engulfs cyanide,  who\n&gt; immediately\n&gt; &gt;   goes into a panick.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Cyanide: &quot;No they&#39;re here! Help! Help!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   As cyanide screams 8 rings appear around him before he himself\n&gt; turns into a\n&gt; &gt;   being of light. Soon he dissapears with the rings forming a sort\n&gt; of bulge in\n&gt; &gt;   the column which quickly speeds up the beam of light and into the\n&gt; Infecticon\n&gt; &gt;   ship...\n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
