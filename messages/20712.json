I forgot how long Spears was with the Trainers..\n\n::Firearm::\n\nFirearm shruggs at her first question. &quot;I&#39;m not really sure, I wasn&#39;t \nworking on it from the beginning. You might want to ask Ramulus about \nit.&quot;\n\nHe frowns at her rescue suggestion. &quot;The Trainers probably know you&#39;re \nback. We won a battle and they retreated, Smokescreen got you back to \nthe Ark.&quot;\n\nHe remembers Spears&#39; preformance back at the Ark, &quot;Where you did a \ngreat acting job, I may add.&quot;\n\nFirearm&#39;s face turns serious again, thinking over her plan, &quot;But I \ndoubt the plan will work. They would probably know that the chip has \nbeen destroyed. Besides, from how Slayer showed himself at the battle, \nhe&#39;s not a bot that would be easily disabled.&quot;\n\nHe sighs, &quot;He killed Snow Cat and nearly took out Ramulus as well. \nWith four or five Maximals shooting at him.&quot;\n\nAs soon as the words left his mouth, he knew he shouldn&#39;t have said \nthem, but it was too late.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him and listened. &quot;I was with the Trainer for a while? \n&gt; How long was I with them? And how is it that I came back, but he \n&gt; didn&#39;t?&quot; She a million and one questions run through her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Does he know that I&#39;m back with you? If not, I may hav a plan to \nget \n&gt; him back. I can go back to the trainers, and pretend to still be one \n&gt; of them. Then I can get close to Striker, possably deactivate him \nand \n&gt; haul him\n\n\n"}}
