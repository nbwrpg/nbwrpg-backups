The other side was \ncompletely applaud that she could have ever had such modes in the first \nplace, even considering aborting them once or if she ever managed to gain \ncontrol of her functions again.\nBut even the thought of abortion brought on a more will for the modes to \nlive and act, which only urged them on to swamp out her systems more and \nmore each moment. However, they would never be able to get total control.\n\nThe creature was urged on to continue its acts as it hears Prowls arm snap, \nthe painful expression on his face rather satisfying. The mech-fluid only \nclarifying  itï¿½s sinful deeds.\nHowever, while the modes were distracted by their pleasure of Prowls pain, \nthe more logical and robotic side of her systems were slowly and surely \ninching for control.\nIt saw Prowl through the eyes of this mode, through the keen sight, which \nwas sure enough to miss nothing. And what it saw made its spark almost \nshatter in fear.\nIron Raptors beast modes were tarring up the only bot she had ever loved, \nand with no reason at all.\nHowever, little did she know that it was only the blood lust, which she had \nbeen keeping contained. which was being shown.\nNot enough time in the battlefield to ease the strain of two deadly and \nhorrific beast modes. And now, released and unable to be contained, they \nwere expelling their rages that would have been used in war.\n\nShe flexed her claws, only managing to sink them deeper into Prowls armor. \nHer weight baring down against him, wanting to push him to the floor and \nhave him off his feet. A vulnerable position for any stalked prey.\nBut then she heard it, something that brought a rather surprising reaction \nfrom her.\nLove? Did she know that word, did she know that name? Yes, yes she did. But \nwhere, how?\nThe beast modes were confused, but the logic knew better.\nIn one fleeting moment, as she looked into Prowls face, she knew just who he \nwas and why he was here. She remembered.\nAnd in that same moment, the logic took more control over the massive form.\nWith a heave of her body she moved from Prowl, still in a little confusion \nbut not as much as before.\nBut he was right, just WHAT was she doing? Attacking the only thing in this \nentire stinking world that she loved even more then her own self.\n\nShe stepped back and looked at him, mech-fluid ridden and in pain.\nSHE was the one who had caused this, had caused the pain which twisted his \nfeatures at that very moment.\nAnd at that moment, she was disgusted with herself.\n\nHer beast modes fought back to regain control, wanting to at least taste his \nfluid against its tongue once again. But there was no way past the logic \nnow, the logic which could not completely master control but enough to know \nwhat it was doing was wrong. Way wrong.\n\nSo, she simply stood there now, her mouth dripping mech-fluid and acidic \nsaliva, simply staring at Prowl with an expression which communicated her \nproblem. Her body stiff and alert, but questioning of its own reactions \nnow.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
