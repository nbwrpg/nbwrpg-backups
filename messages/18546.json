I am going to meet with the group known as the Destrons and \nsee if they will help me in my quest.\n     &quot;I would like the Maximals help as well. I relized that I was \nremoved of my goodness to take down the Alliance, anyway I can. The \nold Prime wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that. I belive that the \nOracle will let me have my Goodness back after this ordeal is over. \nIf I am not dead. But if I have to die to destroy the Alliance, then \nso be it, at least I will know that it was Destroyed.&quot;\n     He looked the two over. What they couldn&#39;t know was that the Key \nto Vector Sigma was still on him, and since it was basically a \nprogram he had put into himself, secretly. Now he could shoot it from \noptic blasts.\n\n\n"}}
