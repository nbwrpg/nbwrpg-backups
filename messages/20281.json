She knew that she was \noutnumbered\n&gt; and overpowered. She&#39;d let her gaurd down one to many times. Now \nwas the\n&gt; time for the tough act. &quot;Squizzy wanted credit for my expriments, I \nhad to\n&gt; do to her before she did to me.&quot; She squirmed a little moire trying \nto get\n&gt; at least her wings uncramped. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have done the same if \nsomeone\n&gt; wanted to steal your technology.&quot;  Lady Hawk was playing on Zardus&#39; \nlogic to\n&gt; escape this situation. &quot;I came to you alone and with technology \nthat could\n&gt; help you in your goals.&quot; Logic dictated that she&#39;d be stupid to \nchallenge\n&gt; the alliance one on all. &quot;Now that I&#39;ve answered you would you \nrelease me\n&gt; and at least grant me the dignitty of walking on my own two feet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- &quot;But you have two wingssss to fly too... &quot;Replied Najah, nd \nhe asked\n&gt; t Zardus &quot;Excusssss me Ssssir... if the birdie try to fly over the\n&gt; cage, can I kill her????&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Again Lady Hawk looked to logic for an answer. &quot;I&#39;m a hawk, of \ncourse I can\n&gt; fly&quot; She was really feeling offended now.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus nods, &quot;Of course. But she wont try to escape, not if she \nwants\n&gt; to live.&quot;, &quot;Correct?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady hawk thought the question was redundant. &quot; Wher would I go?&quot; \nShe knew\n&gt; that at 100 percent she could probably outfly any member of the \nalliance.\n&gt; But with her injuries she&#39;d either be caught or lead them back to \nVeratis.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 06, 2000 5:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Najah bites at Lady Hawk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m running into some trouble in my personal life right now, so I \nmight\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; a bit of an irregular posting rate.

Zardus looks back to Lady Hawk, &quot;Now, what were you \ndoing to\n&gt; &gt; Squizzy?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Havoc stops, nearing the flying portions of the Alliance base. \nFor some\n&gt; &gt; reason they had slowed, continuing ahead slowly. He activates his \ninternal\n&gt; &gt; computers, tapping into the computer of one of the shuttles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He nods, looking through the info he got back. The cargo section \nwas a bit\n&gt; &gt; too heavy for the shuttle carrying it, so they had to slow for \nnow.\n&gt; Another\n&gt; &gt; shuttle from the Iron Fist was on its way to soon help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He sighs, flying ahead to the Iron Fist.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
