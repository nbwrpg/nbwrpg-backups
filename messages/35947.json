It certainly looks like Slaughter is between \n&gt; a boulder\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; very hard place.  Since just entering the Decepticon \n&gt; base, he&#39;s went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; the frying pan into the fire!  I lost Skulletron once, I \n&gt; won&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; ressurected into Slaughter and be lost again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; IC:  Slaughter was getting desperately hungry, and had to \n&gt; eat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soon or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; would die, but he also had to avoid being blown to \n&gt; pieces.  Many\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; projectile\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; explosives were being shot at him.  Slaughter was hit by \n&gt; 15 rifle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; FireStrike, and this time only a few bits of flesh flew \n&gt; off, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slime\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; flew everywhere like normal.  Slaughter got away from \n&gt; Stratus.  He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; forward,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; but high enough, and stuck his pincirs into the ceiling, \n&gt; then acted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; their was sticky things on his hands, and quickly went \n&gt; across the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; ceiling,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; avoiding the mega missile, and the rockets, and all shots \n&gt; that were\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; headed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; at him(sorry for missing all those shots, but I didn&#39;t \n&gt; want my new\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; favourite\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; character to die!)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;     Slaughter jumped down from the ceiling, onto the \n&gt; floor again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;      &quot;HUNGRY!!!&quot; Was the only thing Slaughter seemed to \n&gt; be, and be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; say.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;       Slaughter lunged at Shokaract, opening his jaw to \n&gt; try and take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; bite\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; out of Shokaract.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
