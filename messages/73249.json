He widens his eyes and dives toward him, flying over his leader wi=\r\nth out stretched wings, acting like a shield to protect him and Nightlight.=\r\n  He looks down.\n\n&quot; Sorry, slight miscalculation, won&#39;t happen again.  I th=\r\nought the clouds held water but they don&#39;t .  If I knew there was water I c=\r\nould stop the ash and fire.  I must try to climb higher, beyond the smoke c=\r\nover.  But first your saftey is most imperative.  Get into my talons, you w=\r\nill be safe in there under my draconic armor.&quot;\n\nHe opens his talons to rece=\r\nive his comrades.  Ash rains down on his wings and back yet he ignores the =\r\nsting and burn of their impact.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclo=\r\nnus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Voice, like thunder, loud enough to =\r\nrattle the ground.. Thunder..  After\n&gt; &gt; thunder, comes rain.  But before a=\r\nll that, comes lightning.  Cast to the sky\n&gt; &gt; from the ground up..  Lightn=\r\ning causes fire, but it can also take it away.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He looks to everyon=\r\ne, being sure no one is within his radius.  He opens his\n&gt; &gt; mouth and conc=\r\nentrates.  Tiny bolts of lightning begin to come up from his\n&gt; &gt; gullet and=\r\n crackle out from his mouth.  He then roars, as it sounds like\n&gt; &gt; thunder,=\r\n rumbling across the ground.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I know what I must do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While=\r\n emerging out near the top of the mountain, Tucson spreads his wings,\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd beats them to lift himself upward into the smoke filled sky.  It takes\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; him great effort but he slowly starts lifting off the side of the mounta=\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; and into the air.  He now attempts to create enough static electrici=\r\nty to\n&gt; &gt; induce stormcloud formation.  If he could get it to rain, by usin=\r\ng that\n&gt; &gt; science and the power of the old dragon, he could at least stall=\r\n the magma\n&gt; &gt; enough to get everyone out of there in decent shape, and sto=\r\np the firey bird\n&gt; &gt; above.  Yet, he was exhausted.  Could he do this now, =\r\nin his physical state?\n&gt; &gt;  He had to try.  With great determination, dead =\r\nset in his eyes, the dragon\n&gt; &gt; now picks up his speed in the air, and flie=\r\ns after the bird.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Not this time, Magmatron, not this time!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; He opens wide, and concentrates with all his might, to breathe a bolt of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; lightning, just strong enough to attempt stormcloud formation and hope=\r\nfully\n&gt; &gt; a little rainstorm along with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; While TUSCON do=\r\nes not have the ability to call storms or to make any\n&gt; kind of weather pat=\r\ntern, it is conceivable that a lightning strike of\n&gt; the right modulation i=\r\nnto clouds that were already filled with water\n&gt; could indeed bring a down =\r\npour, and yes there were black clouds that\n&gt; were floating above the volcan=\r\no and the surrounding trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately it was not water that fille=\r\nd these clouds but instead it\n&gt; something darker!\n&gt; \n&gt; When TUSCON&#39;s strike=\r\n hit them they exploded and it was a down pour of\n&gt; burning soot and ash th=\r\nat began to fall on the ground below.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon!&quot; The fiery avian said a=\r\ns it winged its way over towards\n&gt; TUSCON&#39;s position - The voice sounded ex=\r\nactly like RODIMUS&#39; even his\n&gt; IFF signature was the same now. In his claws=\r\n was clutched NIGHLIGHT as\n&gt; he winged his way over, the fire coming from h=\r\nis body and wings\n&gt; protecting NIGHTLIGHT from the embers falling from the =\r\nskies - turning\n&gt; them instead to motes of smoke and fumes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What are =\r\nyou doing Tuscon?!?&quot; RODIMUS said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At this point, seei=\r\nn gthe new upgraded flaming PHOENIX of RODIMUS PRIMAL\n&gt; &gt; shooting up throu=\r\ngh the air, DINOBOT sent a message to any PREDACONS\n&gt; &gt; within his communic=\r\nations range - even assuming that he COULD communicate\n&gt; &gt; within a short r=\r\nange.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I suggest an expeditious retreat is in order./  We are outma=\r\ntched here, and\n&gt; &gt; there is nothing to gain from further combat..
