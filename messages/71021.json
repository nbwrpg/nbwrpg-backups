He would gladly take=\r\n the damage to protect his own.  He knew the urgency of their plight to lea=\r\nve, and he would definitely allow himself to be taken out of there, seeing =\r\nthat it meant to keep precious lives safe from harm.  He didn&#39;t care if he =\r\ndid not bring down Hydras.  He saw what was most important, it was all arou=\r\nnd him, his comrades, their saftey, and the fact that together they worked =\r\nvery hard to get where they were now.  It was what separated him from Hydra=\r\ns.  Neither angry or upset, rather more grateful than anything else, he too=\r\n first responds to Talon.\n\n&quot; Talon, you - took great risks for me.  I can n=\r\never - repay you enough for your bravery, and compassion.  We - may not hav=\r\ne taken Hydras this day, but we worked very hard together and we did cover =\r\n- a mile stone.    And I will gladly take the full force of damage, if it i=\r\ns to protect you and the others.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now rigs a towe line on Tucs=\r\non, with several hooks and dashes over to Kup and the others.\n\n&quot;Okay guys, =\r\nI got some towe lines here, and as long as Tucson&#39;s in neutral, we can towe=\r\n &#39;em back ta the ark.  It&#39;s a lot easier gettn&#39; &#39;em back in alt mode, than =\r\nin his robot mode.  At least this way he can roll on his tires which will t=\r\nake most of the weight.  All I need is some volunteers, besides Kup and mys=\r\nelf.&quot;\n\nTucson now sends a message to his comrades.\n\n&quot; Fellow Maximals and A=\r\nutobots, I want you to know - that your efforts here today, are gladly appr=\r\neciated, and even if - things did not work accordingly, all that is importa=\r\nnt, is that we are all making it back safely.  I thank each and every one o=\r\nf you for your efforts, and I - admit, I may have miscalculated a few thing=\r\ns.  In any event, I am proud of all of you and honored to have each and eve=\r\nry soldier serving our factions.&quot;\n\nHe sends a message back to Legacy.  \n\n&quot;L=\r\negacy, I - thought things over a bit.  If - you had any intentions - of cau=\r\nsing harm, you - would have started with me directly.  But that did - not c=\r\nome about.  I have misjudged you, therefore I revoke any alligations I had =\r\nagainst you.  So it is with this in - mind that I trust the duty of finding=\r\n the individual responsible for framing you, in your capable hands.  Once -=\r\n you find them, bring them to me.  I appologize for my assumptions.&quot;\n\nOutsi=\r\nde, Rat Trap holds onto Windlord tightly as he gets Tucson&#39;s message.

If you don&#39;t have an override code of\n&gt; &gt; some t=\r\nype I&#39;m leaving!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even in truck mode, Tucson co=\r\nuld hear Talon&#39;s scream of pain. And that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was enough to energize him =\r\njust enough to get him to roll quickly toward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon, as he opens his =\r\ncab doors right beside her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Night Shift, get - Talon into my c=\r\nab, now!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skyshadow laughed as he watched Talon fall,=\r\n &quot;Stay down!&quot; he said \n&gt; &gt; menacingly\n&gt; &gt; as he oriented his weapon on her =\r\ndowned form. &quot;This will only take a mome \n&gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; . .&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *&gt;&gt;BOOM!!&lt;=\r\n&lt;*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skyshadow is hit by a blast from Torca which sends him spinning =\r\ninto the \n&gt; &gt; air\n&gt; &gt; and sliding back several meters.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;YOU!&quot; he sa=\r\nid, hatred written clearly on Skyshadow&#39;s face. &quot;You and your\n&gt; &gt; accursed =\r\nFuzors!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Torca just smiled as he held his weapon on him, &quot;You heard=\r\n what your boss\n&gt; &gt; said, FLEE or face my wrath!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Noctorr=\r\no leaped inbetween the Predacons and Talon, catching\n&gt; &gt; Injector and Buzzc=\r\nlaw and sent them flying through the air as well! &quot;Go!&quot; \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; said, h=\r\nis vcoie deep and dangerous.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Without a backwards glance they took o=\r\nff into the air, fleeing after their\n&gt; &gt; master, Hydras! The other Predacon=\r\ns, seeing his flight began pulling out \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift is quick to follow orders, as he carefully places Tal=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Tucson&#39;s front seat. Tucson shuts his doors and secures her gen=\r\ntly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so she doesn&#39;t fall when he moves. It was just enough energy to s=\r\necure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her, as his engine slows and once again, is idol.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nTalon - I want you to - know that it will take more than just a shot =E2=80=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to my arm to stop me completely. Hydras will pay for what - he has =\r\ndone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to you. I promise you that.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Inside the tower*\n&gt; &gt; * *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord Quicly followed Rattrap when he reached th=\r\ne exit he took off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grabs Rattrap by his tail and quickly s=\r\ntarted to move away. Meanwhile \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackFortress count to zero=\r\n continues... 2 mins to Explotion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The way out of the=\r\n tower is apparently unguarded, Scourge is no where to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; seen, pr=\r\nobably having much better things to do like plan his own escape\n&gt; &gt; strateg=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any event the hole that Rat Trap and Windlord had used to ent=\r\ner was \n&gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; available, and when they looked out they could see th=\r\nat the Magma beneath\n&gt; &gt; the tower was beginning to froth and churn as if i=\r\nt was somehow beginning \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; boil deep beneath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile th=\r\ne female voice was continuing its count down. &quot;1 minute to\n&gt; &gt; destruction!=\r\n Minimum safe distance is 10 miles.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
