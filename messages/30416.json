There was\nno\n&gt; point to the scan now, except for the fact that she read a little amount\nof\n&gt; shock from Prowl when he looked over security, wondering to herself what\nwas\n&gt; wrong.\n&gt; The next thing she knew Angel Prime had entered and room, told her he was\n&gt; leaving and left, then both Epyon and Prowl ran out towards the front of\nthe\n&gt; ship.\n&gt; She sighed. What was wrong now?\n&gt; Without even hesitation Iron Raptor followed, though slower then any of\nthe\n&gt; others.\n&gt; She was in no hurry to find out what the problem was now, but she knew\nthat\n&gt; it must be important for Prowl to get involved.\n&gt; Leaving Firedrill to follow her if he pleased, she walked through the\nwalls\n&gt; of the CF, running a hand along them from time to time until the doors of\n&gt; the CF came into view.\n&gt; From there she walked alone, nothing destracting her as the doors drew\n&gt; closer. Finally, she paused at them and they both opened for her, walking\n&gt; past them as if there was nothing wrong and she was just coming out for a\n&gt; breath of fresh air.\n&gt; And from there there was more then just the landscape to look at, Maximals\n&gt; of all sorts had gathered around some other transformer, but one that was,\n&gt; for sure, no Maximal.\n&gt; Iron Raptor narrowed her eyes, her voice clear and carried over everyone\n&gt; elses.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; What&#39;s going on here?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ...................................................\n&gt;\n&gt; * Slick the water running from her form, Sublime stepped from the sea and\n&gt; onto the land, thinking how strange it was to fee earth under her feet\n&gt; instead of the smoothness of the liquid she had just came from.\n&gt; Shaking herself off a bit she set out towards her destination, the Maximal\n&gt; Base.(CF)\n&gt; There was no telling how the faction would react to meeting her and there\n&gt; was no telling how she would feel about meeting them. BUT she was\ndetermined\n&gt; to make a proper and complete study on them, just like the remainder of\nthe\n&gt; group was supposed to do with the factions they&#39;d hooked up with.\n&gt; But from here on there was no real amount of water that she could soak in\n&gt; until she reached the ship, making this seem like a very uncomfortable\n&gt; quest.\n&gt; But she was sure that the faction she was heading too had water, enough\nfor\n&gt; her to soak in for hours.\n&gt; Sublime looked back over her shoulder, half turning and looking out at the\n&gt; sea longingly. The smooth surface reflecting the last of the sun&#39;s rays as\n&gt; evening closed in.\n&gt; She would miss the sea, but she would return. She would always return.\n&gt; And with that she turned back towards the land, setting out towards the\n&gt; forests and wood, until she came to the grasslands that held the CF.\n&gt; But, just to speed up the process, her signature sent out a destress\nbeacon\n&gt; to all Maximal foces.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
