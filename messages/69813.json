Once again they had caught him just in time to pull him =\r\nfrom what could have been an emotional disaster.  He was thankful for that.=\r\n\n\n&quot; I guess I don&#39;t know the difference between being too self absorbed and=\r\n when it&#39;s all right to actually state how valuable one self is to a cause.=\r\n  I have to stop doubting myself as far as worth is concerned. I&#39;ll kick my=\r\nself in the aft to improve if I have to.&quot;  \n\nHe then thinks about his disab=\r\nility and pauses for just a moment.\n\n&quot; Well, now that I need to kind of cha=\r\nnge gears for a moment, I suppose I should see myself as an innovator, who&#39;=\r\ns self worth is rather valuable to the cause of turning things around for e=\r\nveryone and not just for himself.  I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m a God, and that to me=\r\n would be far too fetched.  But now, if I were to rate my self worth, I&#39;d s=\r\nay my role as an Autobot is valuable.  If I had not persisted in trying to =\r\nfind out what happened to Rodimus, not only would I not have found him, I w=\r\nould not have been able to stop the same thing from happening to others.  A=\r\nnd now that I do realize what&#39;s going on, and the fact that I could have ne=\r\narly fallen down the same path, which I hope never to do, thanks to all of =\r\nyou, and the voice I keep hearing, I can finally do some real good around h=\r\nere.  And I promise, I&#39;ll work with each and every one of you, to the best =\r\nof my abilities,\nand try to come up with new ways upon which to do so.&quot;\n\nAn=\r\nother pause.\n\n&quot; Now that I&#39;ve woken up a bit, I suppose I&#39;d like to be able=\r\n to see again, I just haven&#39;t really gotten around to asking someone on how=\r\n to repair my visual circuitry... Heh, truth is, I&#39;m one of the biggest pro=\r\ncrastinators on Cybertron.  I guess I&#39;ve just been putting it off too long,=\r\n after getting used to not having my sight, it just became second nature to=\r\n me.  And in some respects, perhaps I did not want to actually &quot;See&quot; the tr=\r\nuth of the situation.  And of course, major confession coming out here...  =\r\nAt the time, Ratchet was doing repairs and well I didn&#39;t want to burden him=\r\n with anything...  He had enough going on.  After a while I completely forg=\r\not and then another major war happened and before I knew it I lost track of=\r\n time..  But now there is time for the repair.  I just need to have my circ=\r\nuitry examined before it is repaired... I don&#39;t know the extend of my damag=\r\nes truthfully..&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not good at tolerating bad news, you prob=\r\nably already know that.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carrol=\r\nl &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What am I worth? How can I be worth so=\r\nmething when there are lives just starting out there that are more precious=\r\n than my own? And how can I say I&#39;m worth something when we have young aspi=\r\nring Autobots and Maximals just starting their careers as soldiers? They ha=\r\nve their whole lives ahead of them, and by Primus I&#39;m prepared to give back=\r\n what&#39;s been taken from them, THEIR FREEDOM!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All sentient being have=\r\n worth young Tuscon.&quot; comes that whisper again\n&gt; as Tuscon positioned himse=\r\nlf near to the body of Optimus. &quot;If you do\n&gt; not count your self as worth a=\r\nnything how can any one else see you as\n&gt; worthy of anything?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as=\r\n the voice spoke to Tuscon, Lord Elder chimed in, unknowingly\n&gt; agreeing wi=\r\nth the whispered voice, &quot;You know, you sound like Rodimus.\n&gt; He used to say=\r\n things like that. He would get depressed when he\n&gt; failed. Even if he won =\r\nthe battle, he would sometimes find things that\n&gt; he missed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes Tus=\r\ncon&quot; the whispered voice continued. &quot;Do not tie your sense of\n&gt; self to you=\r\nr successes, but to your efforts to achieve that success.\n&gt; Who you are def=\r\nines your value, not what you have you have achieved.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Another whisper=\r\ned voice, also presumably from the Matrix inside\n&gt; Optimus, &quot;Tell me someth=\r\ning Tuscon, we are not biological creatures\n&gt; but technological, yet you ar=\r\ne blind, why have you chosen to remain\n&gt; so? could it be because you choose=\r\n to remember the pain of loss or\n&gt; failure?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Another voice whispered t=\r\no Tuscon, this one sounding a little like\n&gt; Optimus himself, &quot;Do not make t=\r\nhe mistake that Rodimus has made. He\n&gt; lost the energy matrix and himself i=\r\nn that loss. He will need your\n&gt; help to remember his own value. Only then =\r\ncan the power of the matrix\n&gt; help him. But first *you* must see his value,=\r\n and your own.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
