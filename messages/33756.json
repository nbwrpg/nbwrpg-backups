He then raised his Cyclone gun,\n&gt;and took aim, perching it on his shoulder, then fired twice on\n&gt;Incinerator.\n&gt;\n&gt;Speedbreaker followed, climbing up beside him, and perching firing his\n&gt;breakdown gun four times at Incinerator.\n&gt;\n&gt;Wildrider just peeled out of the forest, and came to a stop, knocking\n&gt;Symphony off. He had heard the orders over radio link. &quot;Okay recruit,\n&gt;show us what you got,&quot; He said, pointing at Incinerator. Wildrider on\n&gt;the other hand didnt have patience for that. He took aim on a bigger\n&gt;target, and found one. He pulled his trigger laughing, firring a\n&gt;scattering eight laser beams at Lavatron, not caring if any by mistake\n&gt;hit Surgital.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
