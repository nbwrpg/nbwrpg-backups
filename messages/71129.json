Several more of the sweeps were blasted from the sk=\r\nies, the last one swinging up next to his master Scourge, almost as if for =\r\nprotection. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;=A0=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;The Predacons we=\r\nre looking decidedly more damaged and a bit more tired then before. Energon=\r\n looked to be looking a bit lower than before and the shots from Windlord a=\r\nnd Kup were building up on them, not to mention the firepower coming from t=\r\nhe fuzors as well as Leo II! Yes, the Predacons had breached the door, but =\r\ngetting further in would be an uphill battle indeed, and many of them did n=\r\not look to be in the best shape to fight it!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Outside, Qu=\r\nickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and assesses the situation. He t=\r\nhen looks around the parameters and then remembers a body of goop, that res=\r\nembled a tar pit, not far from the Ark&#39;s parameters.
