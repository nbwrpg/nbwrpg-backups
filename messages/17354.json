Other than that, I&#39;m not \nsure. Their mind controll weapon seems to be the biggest threat. This is a \nhostage negotiation, though. Only me and Lunarpine will be seen unless they \nopen fire. Then we can retaliate.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus carefully removes Squizzy&#39;s main proccessor as she asks her question.\n\n&quot;The new proccessor will hopefully reset her internal functions. Whatever \nsecurity programms are in there should be cleared, and then reprogramming can \ntake place.&quot;\n\nHe remembers that Battera had a bot in the CR chambers, activating his \ncomm-link.\n\n&quot;Unitron,&quot; he says into it. Unitron had appeared fairly smart in the halls, \nhe would be the most likely of the Alliance members to be able to reprogramm \na bot, &quot;There&#39;s a bot waiting to be reprogrammed. He&#39;s in the CR chambers, \ncan you bring him to the lab?&quot;\n\nZardus then picks up Soundwave&#39;s main proccessor, attempting to install it \ninto Squizzy.\n\n"}}
