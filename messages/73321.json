He k=\r\nnew Leo was right. They had to leave before they too became culprits of the=\r\n Earth&#39;s destruction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; To allow this planet to grow without our interv=\r\nention is the greatest gift we can give to it. In due time, those who evolv=\r\ne naturally will take great interest in conserving the planet they live on.=\r\n But first, Leo is right, we have to get everyone off this planet and retur=\r\nn to our rightful place, our own home, Cybertron. It wont be easy but we ca=\r\nn achieve this. The planet has already spoken up and it&#39;s time we listened.=\r\n For now we protect this world by subduing those who strive to destroy it. =\r\n&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then spots a bird who has just landed on his shoulder. He remains =\r\nperfectly still as it begins to chirp for him. He listens with a smile on h=\r\nis face. The bird flutters off after a moment and returns to the tree it ca=\r\nme from.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; After all, this is their world, we&#39;re just their guests, who=\r\n may have worn out our welcome. Then again... Maybe not... Look.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He ge=\r\nstures to a flock of tropical birds, who seem to be perched all around them=\r\n. The colors of their wings are displayed as the flutter them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshi=\r\nft gets up and limps over to the outside .\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait up guys, I just wanna=\r\n see what&#39;s out here.. Wow.. Check that out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sits down next to Tucs=\r\non. Straightshot joins them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m gonna miss this planet. Look how bea=\r\nutiful those birds are. We don&#39;t have anything like this back home. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Q=\r\nuickstride walks up and nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That makes two of us.
