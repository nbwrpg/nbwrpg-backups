If something\n&gt; were to jump out at them, he&#39;d be a bit vunlerable in vehicle form.  To keep\n&gt; in touch with what ever was out there, he sends a few more wide range sonar\n&gt; signals to see if any of them bounced off any objects or anyone who could be\n&gt; within the area.  The ping resonating from the sonar waves, comes back loud\n&gt; and clear.  It was straight ahead.  He keeps on his course, all headlights\n&gt; off, to reduce the chance of being discovered.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just like old times.  Except now, it&#39;s not the Decepticons we need to be\n&gt; concerned with.  I threw out a few more sonar waves, and the signal I got\n&gt; back was very strong.  Sounded as if the signal bounced off of a metallic\n&gt; object, maybe a structure, building, large aircraft, or vehicle for that\n&gt; matter.  But the signal is unfamilliar to me.  It sounded a tad different\n&gt; when it came back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of curiosity, he puts a hand out in front of him, and extends his palm\n&gt; to feel the currents of air going through his fingers.  It was his way of\n&gt; reading residual energy which may have been released along with the signal.\n&gt; Even though it wasn&#39;t visible, he senses a vibration in his hand.  The loss\n&gt; of sight also enabled him to touch things with more sensitivity than normal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m picking up an unknown energy signature through residual feedback.\n&gt; Ravenchief, Guardia, Talon, I don&#39;t have good feelings about this. I think\n&gt; it&#39;s best if you back me up, and let me go in first.  I can take a good\n&gt; beating if I have to.  All right, Lord Perseus is right, caution is a must.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He bravely takes slow and silent steps ahead of his comrades, and continues\n&gt; walking forward.  He loads the cross bow, and then keeps it at the ready.\n&gt; As an Autobot, he took an oath to protect the innocent. Even if it meant\n&gt; risking his own spark to do so.  He wasn&#39;t afraid to be obliterated if it\n&gt; happened so be it.  He felt better as to his decision to go in first, to\n&gt; ensure the saftey of his Maximal comrades.  After all, it was what Autobots\n&gt; did for centuries, and he was no different than any of them.\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon followed Guardia, with her blaster ready for anything.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC: sorry for suddenly pops her but I liked to start to come back to\n&gt;&gt; action right now\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Kraftlos\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 24, 2009 12:54 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: The Old Maximal Base\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Guardia toggled her radio and leaned slightly.  &quot;It appears we&#39;ve run\n&gt;&gt; into something.
