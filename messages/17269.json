From her own programming, \nshe had installed a reprogramming block in her internal systems.  It \nrecongnized the new programs as unauthorized and her origianl \nprograms tried to fight the new one being introduced by Feline.  Her \nbody started to convulse and shake wildly on the table.  \n\nFeline::\nShe looked up from the computer sceeen and saw that the program that \nZardus told her to install wasn&#39;t working and the mainframe was \nrerouting the programs.  She heard a banging noise and looked up to \nsee the femme going into convulsions. &quot;DAMN!&quot; She opened her link to \nZardus, &quot;I got trouble in the lab.  That new bot that you brought in \nhere is rejecting your program.&quot;  Feline tried to help the computer \nand possably just erase the bot&#39;s programs completely.  But the \nmainframe couldn&#39;t get threw the program blocks. \n\nSquizzy::\nHer internal programs were designed to fight off viruses and un \nauthorized programs from entering her main program core.  She had \nalso installed back up programs, so in the event that her programs \nhad somehow managed to be bypassed, they would upload all her orignal \nprograms and restore her to her original state. Her body struggled \nand shook under the straps. Her arms waved, her head jerked, and her \nlegs kicked as her programs tried to fight off the new program.\n\nFeline::\nShe worked as fast as she could to keep up kept rerouting the \nprograms. &quot;Zardus, I need you in here.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
