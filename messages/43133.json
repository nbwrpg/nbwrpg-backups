The \nsoothing light coming from the green lamp kept him drowzy. However, he \nwas back. He turned his head on his left and saw Daemos still \nunconscious. He reached for his comm system.\n\nBelthassan:\nTripredacus, report to me at once.\n\nMelchana arrived a few nano-cycles after. She had ordered Tankor and \nThrust to come as soon as they had finished a check of the security \nperimeter.\n\nMelchana:\nWelcome back, brother. How do you feel?\n\nBelthassan:\nIt matters not. I am online, and that&#39;s the point. Where is Gesper?\n\nMelchana:\nHe found something very interesting. Autobots.\n\nBelthassan:\nWhat? Here on Earth? And what action has he taken?\n\nMelchana:\nHe went to find a diplomatic way to approach them. Waste of time, if \nyou want my opinion... Oh yes, another thing. We received a \ntransmission from a group called the Angelions. Jetstorm volunteered \nto be our representant to a conference they are holding.\n\nBelthassan frowned:\nI leave you the base just a few mega-cycles and you manage to \njeopardize the mission... Let&#39;s just hope what will come will prove me \nwrong...\n\nMelchana:\nOh just shut up. If we can have Autobot allies, this will allow us to \nhave some kind of protection. We may be the Prophets of the Matrix, \nbut its power cannot be passed if we die. Besides, they have powerful \nenemies, and this means challenge for me!\n\nBelthassan:\nYou may be right. Prophecy, open a frequency with the Autobot base. \nAutobots, we are the Tripredacus. A member of our faction is en route \nto meet with you so we can know ourselves more deeply. Please reply.\n\n\n"}}
