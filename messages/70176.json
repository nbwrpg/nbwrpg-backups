I&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nShe Gasped, she saw the autobot&#39;s symbol in Rodimus&#39;s chest, she felt\n&gt; sur=\r\npriced and betrayed. Tears started to fell down, she loved him but he\n&gt; bet=\r\nrayed her faction; everithing that he told were lies. She just liked to\n&gt; m=\r\nove a way there, and ran, without realize towards the cell block area.\n\nAs =\r\nNightlight ran Rodimus quickly shifted into vehicular mode again\nand drove =\r\nafter her, using his superior speed to hopefully over take\nher.\n\n&quot;Nightligh=\r\nt!&quot; he said, calling her by the only name that he has ever\nknown her by. &quot;I=\r\nt is still me Rodimus, the one who has sworn on his\nlife to protect you fro=\r\nm all harm!&quot; Rodimus tried to swerve on front\nof and transformed again.\n\n&quot;I=\r\nt&#39;s me! Don&#39;t you still trust me?&quot; He said, pain obvious in his\nvoice, pain=\r\n from her dismissal of him, of her fear of him. &quot;I remember\nit all!&quot; he sai=\r\nd, his voice taking on a note of urgencey as he spoke,\n&quot;I know who you were=\r\n, and who you are, and most importantly who we are\nand what we meant to eac=\r\nh other.&quot; His words spilling over with\nconviction as he talked.\n\nHe gesture=\r\nd to her as if he would embrace her in a hug if she would\nlet him, &quot;I have =\r\ncome to fulfill a promise that I made to you not only\nearlier but the one I=\r\n made to years ago, that you and I would always\nbe one spark, and that noth=\r\ning would harm you as long as I lived.&quot;\n\nRodimus&#39; head lights brightened, &quot;=\r\nAnd there is another that would want\nyou to remember as well.&quot; A small imag=\r\ne began to appear in the midst\nof Rodimus headlights as a viewscreen appear=\r\ned. In it was a picture of\na young female Autobot: Elita.\n\nAs Rodimus spoke=\r\n chatter from the other Autobots could be heard . . .\n\n&gt; &quot; This is Tucson P=\r\nrime, I copy you Rodimus Prime. Although your words are encouraging, I must=\r\n say I meet them with a bit of apprehension myself. I will do everything in=\r\n my power to keep the peace among us, but do keep in mind, trust will be th=\r\ne most difficult thing to gain among our faction. You have turned against u=\r\ns in the past, served our enemy faithfully, and for that, many of us are le=\r\nary of your return to our side. You show a vulnerability to be easilly sway=\r\ned and in order to regain your status among us, you must prove you can over=\r\ncome this vulnerability. So it is with this in mind, that I request you pas=\r\ns a test of loyalty toward our faction. A test that only I can adiminister,=\r\n and a test only I can deem you worthy of passing. And until such time that=\r\n I have deemed you worthy of this task, leadership of the Autobots will be =\r\ndiverted to me, and none of my orders are to be disobeyed. Do I have your w=\r\nord and compliance Rodimus Prime?&quot;\n\n&quot;I copy you as well Tuscon.&quot; Rodimus&#39; v=\r\noice came over the transmission\nlines, that new sense of conviction transit=\r\nting loud and clear across\nit. &quot;We all have our tests to pass and fail and =\r\nI have failed mine,\nbut it is not just you or your worthiness that I have t=\r\no live up but\nall the Autobots and the matrix itself.&quot;\n\nRodimus paused as h=\r\ne looked at Nightlight wanting her to hear the\nwords he spoke to. &quot;Inside o=\r\nf all of us is a darkness and weakness and\nfear, any of which can be exploi=\r\nted if one finds the right key, the\nright leverage. To deny it is to forget=\r\n that we are living beings. We\nall have to focus and remember who we are an=\r\nd where we stand. I had\nforgotten that, but I shall not forget it again.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRodimus smiled at Nightlight, that smile also carried into his voice\nas he =\r\nspoke, &quot;Sometimes it is not our successes that teach us, but our\nfailures. =\r\nTuscon, you have led the Autobots well in my absence, and\nyou will continue=\r\n to do so I have no doubt. There is too much that\nstands between me and any=\r\n command right now.&quot;\n\n&quot;However I caution you, the mantle of the command wei=\r\nghs heavy on the\nhead of those who bear it.&quot;\n\nRodimus looked at Nightlight =\r\nas he wondered what she would do.\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
