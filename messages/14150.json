She\n&gt; started to spit up fluid.  She found out just how much she hated the\n&gt; taste of mech fluid.  She looked up at Testifier, who had a gun\n&gt; pointed at her.  She spoke in a soft voice and her breathing became\n&gt; more labored. &quot;She is dead.  She walked over to the maximals and\n&gt; surrendered.  They were.  &quot;she breaths for a moment,&quot; they were going\n&gt; to torture her.  They were going to make her suffer in ways\n&gt; unmaginable.&quot;she breaths and couchs,&quot; I couldn&#39;t let them do that to\n&gt; my friend.  I couldn&#39;t let them hurt her.  I wasn&#39;t going to let them\n&gt; cause her any more pain.&quot; She starts to cry and whine in wolf\n&gt; mode. &quot;Time Bomb had died.  We had lost a friend, but she had her\n&gt; spark broken.  The Maximals attacked and demanded her.  I tried to\n&gt; save her, but she sacrificed herself over to them. &quot;coughs and spits\n&gt; up some more mech fluid. &quot;they were going to torture her and make her\n&gt; suffer.  They wanted her to know pain in ways that are unknown to\n&gt; Predacon.  I will kill an enemy, never torture. &quot;she groans in pain\n&gt; and agony.&quot;I couldn&#39;t let that happen. She was my friend.  I cared\n&gt; for her like a little sister.  She was my friend.  I tried to save\n&gt; her.  I tried.  Then she sacraficed her self and left me with no\n&gt; choice.  They were going to torture her.  I had no choice. No choice.\n&gt; I had to do it.  It was the only way.  I couldn&#39;t let her suffer.&quot;\n&gt; She groaned and transformed into bot mode. She grabbed at her belly\n&gt; and doubled over in pain.  She got up on her knees and looked at all\n&gt; the holes in her body.
