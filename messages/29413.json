According to the comms they&#39;ve taken quite a bit of damage.\n&gt; It would\n&gt; &gt; take alot to get them to attack anyone right now.&quot; He thinks back\n&gt; to Slayers\n&gt; &gt; last meeting with the Maximals. &quot;Last time you visited the Maximals\n&gt; it cost\n&gt; &gt; you an arm and a leg to escape. Well a leg at least. I don&#39;t think\n&gt; they&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; welcome us with open arms.&quot; Ignatius&#39; reasons were governed as much\n&gt; by fear\n&gt; &gt; as logic, he knew that it would do Prebon, Blaze, and Bullet no\n&gt; good to get\n&gt; &gt; themselves slagged.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
