Firestarter, a Decepticon millions of years old.  Sixshot of \nthe Third Cybertronian War, a STAG, Solo Transformer Attack Group, a \nsix-changer.  Quite powerful and useful.  Ares, an average warrior \nbut also a triple changer.  And then the three Predacons, somewhat \noutdated warriors that were best used for gun fodder and menial tasks.\n\n&quot;Fellow Neo Decepticons it was earlier in this planet&#39;s rotation that \nthe Ramora&#39;s sensors detected a widely broadcasted transmission from \nthe Alliance&#39;s island base.  After taking the time to decipher it I \nhave learned the  Alliance member Nemesis Enforcer has evidently \ntaken control of the Alliance at least temporarily.&quot;\n\nThe somewhat monotone voice of the one-eyed Decepticon stopped for a \nmoment and began again.  &quot;I wish to know all there is about Nemesis \nEnforcer,&quot; he said, raising his left hand which was actually a barrel \nof a laser weapon into the air, &quot;begin now.&quot;\n\nThe three Predacons stepped forward, Double Punch obviously in charge \nof them.  &quot;Basically, he&#39;s an insane dolt with half a laser core.  \nZardus was smart, Nemesis is dumb.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; Manterror spoke up, &quot;he like talks to himself and stuff.  \nHe&#39;ll be running the Alliance into the ground in no time I&#39;d bet.&quot;\n\nShockwave watched the rest of the Neo Decepticons nodding in \nagreement, well those that were actually responding anyway, and \nraised his right hand which /is/ a hand.  &quot;Silence.  Comments like \nthose are important but to create a strategy based on them would be \nillogical.  The Alliance remained somewhat immobile except for aiding \ntheir Maximal allies.  What is the probability that this new Alliance \nleader will stay with those tactics?&quot; he asked, noticing that no one \nhad a real answer.\n\n&quot;If he&#39;s a loose cannon, chances are he&#39;ll attack.&quot; Unitron spoke up, \nemerald optic sensors seeming to be in deep thought.\n\n&quot;Very well,&quot; Shockwave began, &quot;I want Manterror, Injector, and Ares \nto begin surveillance on the Alliance bases.  Unitron and Sixshot \nwill begin surveillance on the Maximals.  Double Punch will remain \nhere to assist me in surveying this planet to gain information on the \ncurrent status of all the other factions here.&quot; the being ordered, \nall of them leaving except for Double Punch who took a place at one \nof the scanners.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
