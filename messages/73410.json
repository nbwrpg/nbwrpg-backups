Sufficient.&quot;  They could\n&gt; throttle the Spider later, but for now they were seemingly forced to obey\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; And, thanks tot he drugs no doubt being pumped over inot the CR Chamber\n&gt; which held VICE GRIP, he would undubitably be cooperative fully on his own\n&gt; now, if not entirely reprogrammed..  AGAIN.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nYes, TARANTULUS did seem to have all his bases covered. Guns and\nshields around DINBOT and SKYSHADOW, powerful reprograming drugs being\npumped into VICE GRIP. He had finally come into his own, or at least\nhe seemed to have. The only draw back of course is that if he leaves\nthe protection of the ship he would loose most of his advantages,\nunless he had somehting else up his proverbial sleeve.\n\nAs DINOBOT capitulated TARANTULUS nodded and the doors to the bridge\nslid open to reveal the FUZORS who appeared to be giving consideration\nto blasting open the doors and WASPINATOR.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Around this time WASPINATOR stumbled out, his head over on one of his bodies\n&gt; then, looking goggly-opticed, &quot;WAZZPINATOR has HEADACHE..&quot;  He went to hit\n&gt; his head and it spun around, &quot;All betterz now..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then seeing TARANTALUS, ANTAGONY, and the huge honkin&#39; blast cannons pointed\n&gt; around.  &quot;Errr..  Wazzpinator get goingz..&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt the same time CRYOTEK and the HORRORCONS behind him landed in the\nbay area and stalked through the ship, none of them looking too happy.\n\n&quot;What can I do for you . . . err Cryotek?&quot; TARANTULUS said rather\nnervously, despite the fact that he had several large cannons at his\ndisposal and energy fields in place.\n\n&quot;You can start by telling me what you have done with my ship!?!?!&quot;\nCRYOTEK said darkly. &quot;And what are you doing sitting in the command\nchair, where is Hydras?&quot;\n\nTARANTULUS smiled as he recovered his composure, &quot;Oh your ship&quot; He\ngestured languidly, &quot;I used it to upgrade my own. It was such an eye\nsore sitting out there. I thought I would find better uses for it.&quot; He\nchuckled evilly.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
