For the\n&gt; DINOBOTS =\r\nto follow GRIMLOCK was a foregone conclusion. It is obvious\n&gt; that they wer=\r\ne just attempting to smash the source of irritation or\n&gt; confusion of their=\r\n commander, and at the moment that was WHEELIE!\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE could n=\r\not fight off the rampaging DINOBOTS.  Especially GRIMLOCK.  He could not ha=\r\nrm them, he could not evade them, he could not escape them. He just wasn&#39;t =\r\nFAST enough to, his energon slingshot out and ready to fire bolts to itnerc=\r\nept GRIMLOCK!\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; GRIMLOCK roared as he looked at WHEELIE being at=\r\ntacked, watching him\n&gt; bounce off SLAG, and then something snapped. &quot;NO!!!!=\r\n!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SLAG, SNARL and SLUDGE  came to a reluctant and even a surprised ha=\r\nlt.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No?&quot; SLAG said obviously wanting to run WHEELIE into the ground, =\r\nhis\n&gt; optics, as like the rest of them clouded almost bestial. &quot;Slag say\n&gt; =\r\nsmash everything!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; GRIMLOCK roared again, &quot;Me Grimlock say I am leade=\r\nr and we no attack\n&gt; Wheelie-bot!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SNARL and SLUDGE looked back and fo=\r\nrth between SLAG, GRIMLOCK and\n&gt; WHEELIE, unsure of what to do, their optic=\r\ns flickering dimly,\n&gt; apparently they were in the throws of something goadi=\r\nng them.\n&gt; \n&gt; SLAG was still looking at WHEELIE as if ready to charge.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Meanwhile GRIMLOCK&#39;s optics were flickering between a bestial rage to\n&gt; so=\r\nmething akin to sanity.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE heaved a sigh of relief then ove=\r\nr as GRIMLOCK stopped his charge, his first comment thrown out to the DINOB=\r\nOT FIRETROOPER, &quot;No offense SLAG, but you sill always MAD.&quot;\n\nWHEELIE went t=\r\no relax then, forcibly looking up and locking his optics upon GRIMLOCK, &quot;Me=\r\n WHEELIE know something is wrong.
