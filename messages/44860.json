He comes from \n&gt; an alternate dimension apparently. Yep, and as for destroyng the \n&gt; evidence... well thats not going to happen. Very bad choice for a \n&gt; location to crash a ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; As Optimus Fury&#39;s ship heads towards what looks to be its \n&gt; destruction. A beam pierces the ocean and engulfs the ship and \n&gt; quickly balances it. A moment later the ship dissapears calmly \n&gt; beneath the water as it is dragged by the tractor to its source... \nAt \n&gt; the same time inside of the Oblivion, Optimus Furys signature \nappears \n&gt; on the screen since he decided to land on a deserted for now island \n&gt; that the massive ship happened to be off the shore of.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: So like they say my friends you lose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC: A shuttle from the future, in the Angelions time comes out of \n&gt; &gt; transwarp space. A beam shoots towards Africa and scans a black \n&gt; &gt; panther. Inside the bot is given this beast mode and REFORMATED. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; has the same weapons as Optimus Prime in BM except he can only \n&gt; &gt; partially absorb the weapons fire. He opens a com link to his own \n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bot: This is Optimus Fury. I am proceeding toward the inferior \n&gt; &gt; Angilions. They will agree to be reformatted or they will join \n&gt; &gt; millions of &quot;accidental&quot; deaths since the Maxis and Preds hunted \n&gt; down \n&gt; &gt; and destroyed Cheetor&#39;s team and killed most of there followers in \n&gt; &gt; attempts to deformat them. Because we are the Malacons. We live in \n&gt; &gt; secret, and destroy those inferior to us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Comm: Good. Don&#39;t return without a prize, reformatted or dead. \nSoon \n&gt; &gt; with a little elbow grease (lol) we will be 2% of the population \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; the Angelions will still be clueless about us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He proceeds to &quot;destroy the evidense&quot; by aiming his shuttle at the \n&gt; &gt; Atlantic Ocean and parachuting out over England.
