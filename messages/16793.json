There \nmust have been plenty, but he couldn&#39;t find what wouldn&#39;t be too \nboring. \n\nTaking another turn down his repeated trail, he jumped at the sight \nof a red and white bot. He calmed once he saw it was Terrorsaur.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;d ya come from from?&quot; \n\nTerrorsaur blinked with an odd look on his face. He pointed to \nhim. &quot;Hey, weren&#39;t you--&quot;\n\nQuickstrike shook his head. He knew that he was going to say. &quot;No, ah \nfaked it!&quot; \n\nTerrorsaur lowered his arm. &quot;You outta teach me that trick,&quot; he said. \nThe small Fuzor glared at him with a lowered brow.\n\n&quot;What brings ya here, then?&quot; Quickstrike asked, recalling that the \nflying reptile was with Megatron. &quot;Ah thought ya were Megatron&#39;s \nkiester kissers.&quot; A grim developed on his mouth plate.\n\n&quot;You little!&quot; Terrorsaur stepped forward, ready to grab him, when \nQuickstrike let his cobra arm hiss. The red and white bot stepped \nback with a frown on his face. Quickstrike chuckled. &quot;I followed \nTarantulas. Megatron&#39;s gang didn&#39;t seem like Predacons anymore.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh.&quot; Quickstrike took a step back. &quot;Ain&#39;t th&#39; same wit&#39;out me, huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be so full of yourself, half and half.&quot;\n\nQuickstrike groaned and eyed the bot harshly.\n\n&quot;I just want to get some quarters,&quot; Terrorsaur said.\n\n&quot;Try back there,&quot; Quickstrike said, pointing behind himself without \nlooking. Terrorsaur nodded and walked past him. Quickstrike turned \nhis shoulder to look at him. He spat. \n\n\n"}}
