Plintissa wasn&#39;=\r\nt moving. Dracona smiled and walked back toward her base. A dagger flew int=\r\no Dracona&#39;s back. She spun around and grabbed the dagger in pain. Plintissa=\r\n stood there.\n\n              &quot;You do not know when to give up, you fool, bu=\r\nt never mind that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t =\r\nbe able to be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand cove=\r\nred and flung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the le=\r\ng. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her do=\r\nwn. Dracona once again turned to her saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Draco=\r\nna fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dodged. Dracona started to burn everyth=\r\ning with fire beams. Plintissa still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good=\r\n fighter, but it wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life that she discovered h=\r\ner true fighting power. Plintissa beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s part=\r\ns were flung everywhere as Plintissa spun a simple stick through the air. D=\r\nracona raised the saw blade and sliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed=\r\n and sliced Plintissa several hundred times. Plintissa fell.\n\n             =\r\n &quot;Th weak move aside and die so the strong can survive. As ancient as the C=\r\nosmos, that has always been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintissa, you wer=\r\ne a good friend, but don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just business.&quot; Draco=\r\nna said.\n               \n              Dracona pulled back the saw blade an=\r\nd thrust it towards Plintissa. Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier and t=\r\nhrew it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as =\r\nshe did, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. D=\r\nracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first arived o=\r\nn the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces everyw=\r\nhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n              &quot;*Cough, =\r\nCough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Draco=\r\nna died smiling. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she wo=\r\nuld never leave her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere=\r\n and she got weaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. He=\r\n was crying, too.\n\n              &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.=\r\n&quot; Plintissa whispered.\n\n              &quot;Why are you leaving me, Plintissa? W=\r\nhy does everyone betray me?&quot; Artist asked.\n\n              &quot;Artist, there fl=\r\noats Dracona&#39;s spark, recover it, we can&#39;t part, she really was my friend.&quot;=\r\n Artist walked up and captured the extinguished spark as it tried to fly aw=\r\nay. He contained it in a capsule.\n\n              &quot;Plintissa, if you leave m=\r\ne, I&#39;ll...have no more reason to live, all my friends are gone, my helping =\r\ndays are over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n              &quot;Your helping days are never ov=\r\ner, and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n              &quot;This isn=\r\n&#39;t some lame thing about how you&#39;ll always be in my heart, is it?&quot;\n\n       =\r\n       &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Artist looked at Team =\r\nUltima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, that it was destroyed=\r\n by Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that originally built it. =\r\nAnd there it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks=\r\n at the base and sighs.\n\n              &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess w=\r\ne have to leave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.=\r\n\n\n              &quot;Blizzard, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister sai=\r\nd sadly.\n\n              Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly=\r\n burst from her and floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he ne=\r\neded to do. He opened his chest compartment and his spark was revealed. Art=\r\nist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.\n\n            =\r\n  &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. Plintissa told him she s=\r\ntill loved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plintissa was with him now, and now t=\r\nhey could never be seperated again. Artist, completely ignoring Blizzard an=\r\nd Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n              &quot;=\r\nArtist, now we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa said. (Reme=\r\nmber, only Artist can hear Plintissa now) Artist headed toward the Maximal =\r\nbase, there Dracona would get a new body, one she could not attack anyone e=\r\nver again in, and where she can always be helpful. Artist held up the conta=\r\nined, Dracona&#39;s spark still inside.\n\n              &quot;I love you.&quot; Artist sai=\r\nd seemingly to nobody.\n\n              &quot;I love you too.&quot; Plintissa said to A=\r\nrtist.

Plintissa grabbed her ar=\r\nm from \n              earlier and threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona=\r\n slammed it \n              into Plintissa, but as she did, the blade came l=\r\noose before it hit \n              Plintissa. The blade flew up.

The blade \n              sawed through Dracona and left =\r\nher in pieces everywhere. Her spark \n              extinguished.

Her mech fluid ran everywhere and \n=\r\n              she got weaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to \n   =\r\n           Plintissa.

It was destroyed, the funny \n        =\r\n      thing was, that it was destroyed by Dracona, the very one, along \n   =\r\n           with Plintissa, that originally built it. And there it was, \n   =\r\n           sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks at the=\r\n \n              base and sighs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we h=\r\nave to \n              leave.&quot; Sinesis says.

He opened his=\r\n chest compartment and \n              his spark was revealed. Artist combin=\r\ned Plintissa&#39;s spark with his \n              own, they became one.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Til=\r\nl all are one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. \n              Plintissa told =\r\nhim she still loved him.
