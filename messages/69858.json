They didn&#39;t get far before =\r\nthey started to battle, yet Nightshift was transmitting a message to Hydras=\r\n. His transmission range is extensive.\n\nOOC: Thanks, I appreciate the info =\r\n:)\n\n\n&gt; BIC: Tucson makes for a make shift, mid transformation sequence, as =\r\ninstructed by Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sorry about that Sir, I shouldn&#39;t have assum=\r\ned you had the capability. You&#39;re right, this should be convincing enough.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Half robot, half SUV, Tucson now falls to the ground, as if going unco=\r\nncious. Walking further ahead, with a slow limp, Night Shift puts a little =\r\ndistance between himself and Tucson before falling painfully to the ground,=\r\n waiting for help to arrive.\n\nLord Elder acknowledged Tuscon&#39;s transmission=\r\n with a single stroke on\nthe terminal. there was something funny about that=\r\n dot that\nperiodically appeared. For the moment it disappeared again, proba=\r\nbly\nbecause it had stopped moving again. His computer instruments were\npick=\r\ning up just barely, it was only the very slightest of distortions.\n\nHe glan=\r\nced over at Elita, &quot;Yes&quot; he said distractedly, &quot;A hologram. But\nI don&#39;t hav=\r\ne one. But maybe we all could build one later.&quot; he said as\nhe watched the s=\r\ncreen as his radar began picking up Scorponok&#39;s\napproach, &quot;Oh boy, here it =\r\ngoes&quot; he mumbled under his breath again.\n\n*********************************=\r\n**********\n\nMeanwhile . . .\n\nScorponok began his approach, his robot mode c=\r\nlearly visible. Like\nmany of the earlier built Decepticons, he had the abil=\r\nity to fly in\nrobot mode. Typically he saw no need to use it, but there wer=\r\ne times\nwhen it was useful, such as now.\n\nAs Nightshift moved across the gr=\r\nound, Scorponok moved in his\ndirection, his larger frame and massive dimens=\r\nion dwarfing your more\ntypical and even most of your larger framed mechs.\n\n=\r\nWith a deft use of boosters he landed on the ground a few meters in\nfront o=\r\nf Nightshift and looked around. He looked over at Tuscon&#39;s\napparently broke=\r\nn form in the distance. &quot;Interesting.&quot; he said as he\nturned his gaze on the=\r\n approaching Nightshift. &quot;Tuscon fell much\neasier to you than he did to the=\r\n others.&quot; Scorponok said thoughtfully,\nconveniently obscuring the fact that=\r\n he was there too.\n\n&quot;Hydras wants to see you.&quot; he said, his voice deep and =\r\nsomewhat firm,\nholding out a large clawed hand to steady Nightshift should =\r\nhe need\nit.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Keep in mind, due to the information being sent to=\r\n Cyclonus,\nHydras and anyone else in the command center can see and hear wh=\r\nat is\ngoing on here.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
