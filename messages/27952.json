So \nyour bots are either flying or swimming.\n\n::Zardus/Future \nZardus/Astral/Reptilica/DevilDuer/Fenox/Griplash/Havoc/Perndabot/Reckl\nessa/Repressor/Starlight/Diamond::\n\nZardus sighs, seeing two Predacons attack the Iron Fist. Their \nattacks were nothing to be worried about, but it still added to his \nsuspicions about Unitron and company. His eyes glance over to the \nscanner reports, watching something develop fairly close to Alliance \nisland. His comm beeps.\n\n&quot;Zardus, I&#39;m at the CF. There is a bot who looks just like Unitron \nhere.&quot;\n\nZardus growls, tapping a few buttons. This was enough. Three seconds \nafter a barely audable beep, the pipes blast open in the room that \nUnitron and his fellow bots were in, neuro-circuitry-destructive gas \nrushes to fill the room. The gas worked by seeping into any opening \nthey could find in a bot (optics, mouth, nose, joints, cracks in \narmor, spaces between armor plates, etc..) and attacking any \ncircuitry it touches, possibly completely destroying it. The blast \ndoors of that area of the base were all closed and airtight (blast \ndoor every 10 feet or so, as usual). Zardus activates his comm. \nJammers activate in the room, stopping any transmissions whatsoever \nfrom leaving or entering.\n\n&quot;All Alliance troops, there may be a revolt in sectors three through \nseven. Those sectors have been sealed off. Prepare for battle in case \nthe revolt gets out of hand. Don&#39;t rush to fight yet, those sectors \nare highly dangerous at this point, but be ready.&quot;\n\nThe announcement, of course, was not heard in the room where Unitron \nand co were. Zardus taps a few more buttons and the autoguns in the \nroom emerge, aiming at the crowd of bots and firing randomly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFuture Zardus looks around the battle at the CF, watching for any \nother suspicious behavior other than what he reported to Zardus a few \nseconds ago.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral runs out of his quarters at Zardus&#39;s transmission, his gun in \nhand and ready to be used. He wasn&#39;t too far from where the &#39;revolt&#39; \nwas taking place.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica sighs, looking to Zardus. &quot;If this don&#39;t stop, I&#39;m gonna go \ninsane from all the conflicts,&quot; he says to his commander, sitting \nback in his chair, bored.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer groans and activates his stun gun, preparing for any \npossible battle. He sits up and exits his quarters.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox jumps at the announcement of a possible revolt, her gun in her \nhand in under a second. &quot;You ready?&quot; She asks Vlad.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGriplash drags his sleepy self out of his quarters, both missile \nlaunchers ready for battle. From the next room, Recklessa emerges, \nalso ready to slag some bots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe practice bots dissapear as Havoc waves his hand after Zardus&#39;s \nannouncement. He looks to Demolition and Repressor.\n\n&quot;Well, we get to fight real life. Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nHavoc exits the training room, taking out his missile launcher. \nRepressor follows with both missile launchers drawn.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot takes out his missile launchers, remaining in his seat at \nthe bridge.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight yawns as she exits her quarters, her charge launcher armed \nand ready to go.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(I&#39;ve tried not using Diamond as much as possible, cause I don&#39;t like \nusing other people&#39;s chars, but Logo loaned her to me till she gets \nback, and this is a serious situation, so I&#39;ll RP her for now)\n\nDiamond jumps out of her bed, running out of her room with her poison \ngun ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Nighteyes screams, but is hit in the leg. She transforms and \nrushes to \n&gt; the protection of the island.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Craken arrives at the Allience Island, and begins to fire \nhis dual \n&gt; chain guns at the base, knowing he wouldnt do damage but this was \njust the \n&gt; beginning of the plan.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas rerouted power to the shields. &quot;Send the autogun \nfire, from \n&gt; behinde the shields, at the arriving enemies.&quot; He said to Klash.\n&gt;        She responded and did so. The autoguns, from behinde the \nshields, \n&gt; opened fire on the newly arriving bots.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Bezerker saw Craken arrive at the Allience base, and \nscenting Hell \n&gt; Beast on him, began to join the attack on the base.\n\n\n"}}
