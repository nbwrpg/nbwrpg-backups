She became the Commander so \nMegatron could take control. She would have to contact him and make the \narrangements for him to Command. And now the Terricons were agianst her! That \nwas laughable. Once Megatron got here, they would be sorry.\n    Entering the bridge she saw Paralysis alert, loading and fidgeting with \nhis pistol. &quot;Report.&quot; She said bluntly, taking the command chair.\n    &quot;So far, so good. Nothing really to report.&quot; He craoked, looking into the \nplasma chamber of his gun with one large green eye.\n    Aracnia shighed. If she was going to contact Megatron, she had better do \nit now. Taking the comm unit, she contacted Megatron.\n    &quot;Megatron, this is Black Aracnia. Please respond. We need to talk, its \nimportant.&quot;\n\n"}}
