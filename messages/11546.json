And he had well earned his, it was only proper for him to be shown the respect he was due.\nHis attention dwelled on Necromancer, awaiting him to either explains or demonstrates what their skills were.  But then he heard Hell Drak speak again, his optics snapping towards her at the sudden insult.\nMaximals? Babies?\nIf she was meaning to direct the insult at him then she had failed dreadfully, not even knowing a bot with a Predacon birthright when she saw it.\nHe was  Predacon with the Maximal title, the insult not phasing him in the slightest.\nDinobot simply lifted a brow-plate at Hell Draks words, a sudden look of amusement in his optics while his expression remained blank. His tail swaying calmly behind him.\nHe then heard Necromancer scold his sibling, not taking advantage of the opportunity of scolding the fembot himself. His optics shifting to the male bot as he turned to him with the apology of his sister�s foul words. Asking forgiveness for them in hopes that they would not anger him.\nDinobot listened to the small bots plea for forgiveness, simply crossing his arms but the amused look still playing behind his optics.\nThis was getting interesting.\nHe simply shrugged.*\n\n� There is nothing to forgive, I am only Maximal by title. Her mere words effect me not in the slightest.�\n\n* His voice was calm and collected, just as his posture was. However, his rage could be ignited quickly and in a moment�s notice. Whom or whatever causing the sudden blaze of temper not even knowing that hit it.\nBut he did not let Hell Draks words bother him, knowing that a sudden flare up of temper could be seen as a weakness.\nBut even with his spoken sentence he knew that there might be questions, ones that he would have to answer with the fact that he was truly Predacon, simply fighting along the Maximals side.\nBut then Necromancer did indeed answer his question, expressing that he was about to give a demonstration of his skills.\nDinobot watched with slight amusement as he pulled a laser disc shooter from his being and aimed it towards a far pair of trees, watching as the shooter fired and two sections of the trees parted and fell onto each other.\nThe watching with no interest at all as Hell Drak wandered over to the trees and stomped them in, watching the splinters fly in ever direction possible.\nBut, luckily for them, the trees were slightly away from the clearing, not disturbing it�s beauty one little bit.\nBut then, as he looked over the clearing his optics fell upon Tavatron at the water�s edge, thinking that from her lack of movement that she must have fallen asleep.\nWith a sigh he exhaled a large breath, thinking of just how he could use such a rest at the moment as well. But there was no time for that, deciding that he would just let her sleep until they had to leave.\nDinobot watched Necromancer walk back towards him, not really paying too much attention but enough that he knew what was going on.\nEven now he could feel the energy in which he had been powering up to save for the trip back dwindling, knowing that either mode didn�t help. He was going to lose power either way, there was nothing he could do.\nBut the time to move on neared and he was eager to get back to base where Tavatron would be safe and out of harms way, and he could repair as well as her.\nBut it was fortunate that there were more of the Maximal force, already knowing that they outnumbered the Predacons and Alliance alike and could take either easily.\nHe would mention that at the next meeting, if there ever was one. If not, the he would discuss it with Tavatron and then their commander.\nBut then Dinobot studied the new additions to the Maximal force with a more detailed optic, knowing that each had potential�even if some did have an attitude problem.\nBut then, with a slight growl he gestured towards Necroamncer with his chin. Leaning his back against a near by tree, his arms still folded across his chest.*\n\n� How long have you been here�and what are your beast modes?�\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
