This faction was disorganized and it \nwould take a reasonable amount of time in order to assemble it into a \nworkable force once again. Though the main hand problem in which he though \nwas the cause of all this was not the attitude of the transformers under \ncommand, but the shere number of them. There were too many of them!\nBack in his past life there had been a workable amount of both friend and \nfoe; just enough to pose a threat and keep a bot on his/her toes. But now \nthe numbers were simply too high and a battle could be won on number alone. \nThe ability to battle was no longer needed.\nFrankly...it disgusted him.\nThis was not a war anylonger. It was which faction decided which other one \nwould live to battle with another day. There were no warriors here. Just \nsheep ready for the slaughter!\nDinobot hardly noticed as Tavatron moved away from him, walking over to \nstand near their commander. His mind too set in seeing just which aspects of \nthis faction needed to be dealt with over others. Though the more he thought \nthe more he wondered just why he remained with this faction.\nThere was nothing keeping him there, nothing at all. Though he would never \nturn against them and join an enemy force. If he did leave he would go \nneutral. Besides, he felt no ties to the base or the Maximals. He would miss \nnothing.\nHowever, even that wasn&#39;t true.\nHe would miss the battles. And a warrior without battles to fight was not a \nwarrior at all.\nDinobot crossed his arms and locked his sight in on the enemy, though only \nhis eyes followed them all.\nSomething had to happen besides this waiting. Something, anything. It just \nhad to happen, and soon.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
