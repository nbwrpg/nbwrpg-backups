Both Rodimus and Cyclonus have ALOT of firepower, and it\nwould appear that firing everything at once will make that battle very\nquick and very messy. \n\nI guess I come from table top RPG&#39;s and MUSHes where attacks took place\nround by round, you defended once and attacked once and then let the\nother person do the same. In the toons it was rare for more then one\nkind of attack to come from a specific robot. \n\nDoes this make sense? Again this is not a rant but I am making sure I\nhave it right. If we are doing multiple attacks at once, then no\nproblem. But then I will have to adjust my fighting style here. If you\nnotice I have generally been doing one defence and one attack at a time\nper character. \n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet easy, one-click access to your favorites. \nMake Yahoo! your homepage.\nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n\n"}}
