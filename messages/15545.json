Time to even the odds.....&quot;\n\nPrebon sees Sideswipes missles comign towards him. He quickly grabs \nSpears by her pudgy little neck.\n\n&quot;Now you die!&quot;\n\nPrebon throughs Spears into the path of the missles.\n______________________________________________________________________\nIgnatius/Bullet\n\nIgnatius and Bullet saw the missles coming. Bullet popped ot his \nblast shield.\n\n&quot;Hide behind me!&quot; he yelled at Ignatius.\n\nThe first misslee hit the shield. It was a volent blast, but \neverything was alright. The second one hit, and the force this time \nhit most of the shield, but eventually broke it and the last bit \ndamaged Bullet. \n\n&quot;Aaaaahhh!&quot; He screamed. He looked at Bluestreak and Andromena with \ntorturous eyes. He got a wicked simle.\n\n&quot;Big mistake......&quot; Bullet fired 15 shots at Bluestreak and 10 shots \nat Andromena. Ignatius flew up into the sky and went to Eagel mode. \nHe than did what Eagle&#39;s do best, and dove at a high speed with beak \nopen right at Andromena&#39;s head.\n______________________________________________________________________\nHammer\n\nRatchet&#39;s shots hit Hammer&#39;s shoulder, causing a huge gash of mech \nfluid to pour out. Hammer never screamed. He simply summoned up all \nhis anger and let out a fearsome attack. He powered up energy in his \nhorns and let it loose on Ratchet.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBlaze\n\nBlaze dove out of the way of the optic lazers, which scarred her feet \na bit. She hissed and looked at Snow Cat. She got up and went to her \nbeast mode, a Bengal. She circled Snow Cat, looking her up and down. \nAt the last moment she pounced and lunged herself at Snow Cat.\n\n\n"}}
