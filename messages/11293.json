Ramulus \nwas out gathering technology, Ratchet was working on a way to \nreassemble the ancient ship, and the others were gathering equipment \nfor the journey. Maybe this plan had a slim chance after all.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She nodded and looked at him. &quot;I understand beloved.
