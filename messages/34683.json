That fight with FireBlade had taken alot out of her, but as\n&gt; long as it was one less enemy the Maximals had to be threatened with,\n&gt; who cared? Suddenly her muscles tensed and she turned on her heel, the\n&gt; claws of her foot armor grinding into the ground.  Her scanners homed\n&gt; in on a streak of pink heading towards her, her mind numb at what was\n&gt; going on. But nothing was controling her body this time, instead she\n&gt; felt a power pulsating from the very core of her spark. The Matrix had\n&gt; come to life! Power serged inside of her super structure, so much that\n&gt; it almost hurt.  Her hands shook, then the rest of her body followed\n&gt; and she nearly dropped her sword. And in one burst, silver flashed\n&gt; wings erupted from her back and stratched out behind her. The last of\n&gt; the dieing sun caught a glint off of them as a red light began to\n&gt; pulse at the flat of her chest. The light began to get brighter,\n&gt; always pulsating with the beating of a single spark. Though there was\n&gt; no helm, a face-plate detatched from neck armor and covered her mouth\n&gt; and nose. And in one swipe of a swords blade, the turrent sent from\n&gt; Megatron bounced away and exploded behind her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; MEGATRON!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * With ice blue eyes she glared at him. And with a voice directed by\n&gt; the Matrix itself, she spoke.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I AM ARKNESS PRIME!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Gripping the sword with both hands she raised it above her her, the\n&gt; tip pulsating with a bright red light.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; AND YOU WILL YEALD!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Flipping the blade so that it pointed down, with a will of\n&gt; commanders before her it was stabbed into the ground. Streaks of light\n&gt; erupted from theblade and slithered along the ground like bolts of\n&gt; lightening from a thindercloud, cascading towards Magatron. But just\n&gt; before reaching him they shot into the air in straight bars of pure\n&gt; energy by the Matrix&#39;s will. Around Megatron them sprouted, growing\n&gt; and reaching for the sky...the gap at the brink...beginning to shrink\n&gt; and close.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
