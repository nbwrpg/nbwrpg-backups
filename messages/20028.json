Tarantulas looked \nuninterested in aiding in this new assignment. He wasn&#39;t much on \nmaking ships self destruct, but a bot could learn. He just needed at \nleast some assistance. \n\nHe looked around the room. &quot;Say, Paralysis, wanna come wit&#39;? Might \nneed some help wit&#39; this.&quot;\n\nHe then took a step forward, towards Black Arachnia. &quot;Ya know, we \nmight be able t&#39; use that rat fer some of this. Make &#39;im work fer us--\nuse &#39;im fer bait, &#39;til it&#39;s over, then we&#39;s can kill &#39;im.&quot; He \nchuckled.\n\n\n"}}
