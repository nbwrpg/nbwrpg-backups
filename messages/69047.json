It began buzzing as it did its best to evade Darkhawk&#39;s blasts. Its shielding was barely enough to protect it, but the blasts were still sending it reeling. \n\nThen with a sudden blast of energy it fired a power disintegration beam! However this beam was not fired at one of the Predicons, but instead at the ground, creating a four foot wide hole in the ground! Then with a swiftness born of desperation the extractor flew into the hole it made, and disappeared from view, even as it continued to fire creating a tunnel.\n\nTAG: Hydras, Darkhawk)\n\n&gt; OOC: I sent you a mail Preston\n\nI sent one back.
