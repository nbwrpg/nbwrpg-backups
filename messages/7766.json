The Events page...I was \nhoping Yanshosh \n&gt; would take care of it, but that isn&#39;t the case.  So, that won&#39;t be \nupdated \n&gt; for the days I was gone.  Sorry.  \n&gt; \n&gt;     I plan on being back in da game tomorrow after having a nice \nlong chat \n&gt; with Yanshosh.  My dad and brother will be gone, so Junior Czar \nUnitron (me), \n&gt; will have ze whole house to himself.  \n&gt; \n&gt;     So, if you&#39;ve got any formal complaints with me, no offense \nintended, but \n&gt; it&#39;s midnight, I&#39;m kind of tired, &quot;Unhappily Everafter&quot; is coming \non, so you \n&gt; can shove &#39;em.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; &quot;Working for a better tomorrow, for himself.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
