She rolls onto her side and \nslowly gots up on her knees.  She grabs her last dagger and throws it \nat Ares.  She leans back on her legs. She groaned at the pain. \nLeaking mech fluid out of her back and sides. She looks up at \nLunarpine. She grabs his hand and slowly stands up.\n&quot;OK, I own you one.&quot;  She could barely stand, her legs screamed in \npain, but she didn&#39;t make a sound.

With the last \nof his \n&gt; energy he fired to more blasts at Shadow Wing. \n&gt; \n&gt; (this next move only counts if Unitron is a newcomer because i \ncan&#39;t remember)\n&gt; Unitron had been watching the battle from the side and saw that \nProwl was \n&gt; unoccupied. So he jumped up and fired on the unsuspecting \n(hopefully) \n&gt; Predacon.\n\n\n"}}
