She had promised herself she wouldn�t \nmove from this position until he either stopped breathing or woke up. She \ndidn�t break her promises. With a heavy sigh Tavatron slightly stirred, her \neyes opening in nearly invisible slits. She tightened her grip slightly on \nDinobot�s arm, no matter what happened he would always be her friend. A \nwarrior lived for the present, therefore the future had never really \nconcerned Tavatron, but now�\n\nNo, she was being foolish again. He was her friend, nothing more. Slag, he \nwouldn�t even let her touch him half the time! Maybe that was why she had \nher hand on his arm, perhaps she was hoping he would wake up just to tell \nher to stop worrying. A sudden, horrific thought crossed the wolf-�bot�s \nmind:\n\n*What if he didn�t wake up?*\n\nThe room seemed to spin  momentarily while Tavatron leaned forward, her \nhands clasped tightly about the edge of the table before her. The \nrealization of what she once considered the impossible had chilled her to \nsay the least:\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\nA low, defiant growl hissed through wolven teeth answered the unthinkable. \nTavatron leaned back in her chair and wiped the sweat from her eyes. He was \na fighter. Death wasn�t an option.\n\nThe low grumbling of an empty stomach reminded her she hadn�t eaten for \nquite a while. The feeling of emptiness in her gut was enough to distract \nher for the time being. When Dinobot woke up perhaps they could go hunting. \nTheir last excursion had been cut short by an emergency at the Ark. Now, \nhowever, they should be able to steal a couple of mega-cycles for a good \nhunt. The thought of hunting, of weaving betwixt hollow trees and leaping \nover fallen ones made the cold, harsh reality of the CF a little more \nbearable. The room blurred and blackened before Tavatron�s optics as she \ndrifted in and out of conscience.\n\nA banging of metal and scraping of claws awakened Tavatron from her partial \nslumber. Dinobot was moving! Now fully awake Tavatron stood beside him and \nwaited for the convulsions to cease. A look of surprise and then relief \nflashed across her face. The sudden noise from his internal computer caused \nher to reflexively pull back her ears in an attempt to dull the sound. It \nseemed everything was more or less in working order, including Dinobot�s \nmuch needed repair system.\n\nTavatron watched in child-like wonder as Dinobot�s spark cavity�s door slid \nback to reveal the pulsating light within. The soft glow of Dinobot�s repair \ncoils amazed her as they wrapped about his chest. She gently touched one, \nfinding it almost warm to the touch. Unfortunetly a sharp pain in her lower \narm caused Tavatron to pull away from the energy coils. She had forgotten \nwhat effect they had on a non-TM2 system. Pain.\n\nDinobot had repaired her using his own system one time. The pain had been \nimmeasurable, but well worth her life. She often wondered if he would have \ndone the same for another �bot. She had assumed at the time it had been an \nact of kindness, but then she got to know him on a more personal level, only \nto realize that kindness was not something Dinobot seemed capable of. He was \nloyal, and on occasion humorous, but most of the time he was all business.\n\nA muffled and somewhat strained groan brought Tavatron back to reality. She \nhadn�t been here for the initial insertion, so she was unsure as to whether \nor not she could remove the tubes yet. Dinobot seemed capable of sustaining \nhimself without the aid of all this equipment. Still, an uncertainty \nlingered in the back of her mind. The constant doubt and second guessing was \nbeginning to unnerve her. She resisted the temptation to pull the tubes from \nDinobot�s mouth.\n\nDinobot�s repair coils continued their work while Tavatron placed her hand \non the only part of his body she could without risking exposure to the green \ncoils, his face. Her fingers gently brushed his cheek as she gazed down at \nhim, waiting for him to fully awaken:\n\n&quot;The next time you do something this stupid I�m going to kill you myself. \nUnderstand?&quot;\n\nHer voice was somewhat stern, but in a friendly and lighthearted manner. \nRight now she was relieved just to see that he was awake.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
