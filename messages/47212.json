Unlike my twin, however, I am a \nstaunch defender of the Maximal cause, but like him I can feel through \nmy spark. I feel emotions, more precisely. And I felt confusion in \nMistra&#39;s spark. I came here to help her out.\n\nHe did held back some informations, but he thought Kali would be \nsatisfied with this. His expression revealed nothing of this missing \nelement. Besides, it was not very important.\n\nAzureBlade: I must also thank you for giving me some precisions on the \npact. I recognize that you deserve honor. I am eager to fight you on \nthe field of battle. You have my word, Predacon. I will tell no one of \nthis conversation.

She \n&gt; didn&#39;t like the way Kali talked of Azure&#39;s sense of honor either. \nSomething \n&gt; about the way she had said it...but...it was up to Azure really.\n&gt; \n&gt; But wouldn&#39;t the fact that your friend was still with you enough \nreason to \n&gt; try and rescue them..?
