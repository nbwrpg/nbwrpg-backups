He pulled \n&gt;the lid open and saw a pair of eyes looking back at him.  Malicous \n&gt;looking eyes.  He slammed the lid shut an locked it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He brushed off the side of the pod and found that this was one of \n&gt;the prisioners from the ship.  An especially violent prisioner \n&gt;because a few seconds later he began to try to break out of the pod.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I better call the Warden.

It was a boring night, he had \n&gt;solved all their problems and now the captain had been having him \n&gt;repair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting another, \n&gt;he quickly sneaked out.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill which \n&gt;was right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything \n&gt;interesting.  \n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes to \n&gt;another mountain about 10 clicks south.  When he arrived at the \n&gt;object he discovered that it was buryed about 80% of the way into \n&gt;the sand.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Its buried.....time to get out the old shovel....&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;(To be continued)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Get advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
