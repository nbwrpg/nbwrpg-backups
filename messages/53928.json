Her grotesque but terrible\nbeast mode had seen the shots being fired and the lone figure wreathed\nin light. That is where she went.\n\nThe sound of huge wingflap made Tyrael turn around. What he saw was\nnothing he had ever believed could exist. It was a large\ntechno-organic wyvern-like beast, all black and covered with sharp\nspikes covering its body. And it was his daughter.\n\nDreadplague: Major Tyrael, I am Dreadplague, Tripredacus warrior and\nyour daughter. I hereby swear my alligeance to you and the Tripredacus\nin our goals on Earth. Could we land?\n\nHe nodded and came down on the ground. She followed him and perched\nherself on a dead log, but she didn&#39;t transform.\n\nDreadplague: I had to ask you something... You designed me to be\nsomething more, didn&#39;t you?\n\nTyrael: Yes. I once had this fierce warrior under me, but he died in\none of his first battle under my command. I respected his will and\nused his material to create you. But with some Predacon secrets in my\nhands, I hoped to make even better than he was. You know you can. Show me.\n\nDreadplague complied. She transformed into something no one would have\nthought of (except Rauq!): a techno-organic helicopter, having her\nwyvern face as the cockpit and large spikes as the pales.\n\nDreadplague: You have made me something great, father. Not only am I\ntechno-organic, but my powers exceed those of most transformers. I am\na Techno-organic 2.\n\nAgain, she tranformed, becoming the large cloaked bot. The place\nseemed to darken and even Tyrael aura wavered. She let a long shriek\nout and drew her long sword. Her main weapon was now unleashed as she\nsent panic and distress in the minds of all who were on the battlefield.\n\n\n"}}
