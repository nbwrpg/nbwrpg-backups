Something in common if nothing else.\nBut before Prowl could do anything she walked a bit to the near wall and \nsmalled her damaged shoulder up against it with a sickening pop, meaning \nthat it was no relocated...but hurt like Hell!!!\n\nShe yipped a bit and growled, but that was it. Though, she was limping far \nmore worse now then before.\nWith a heaved sigh she simply moved towards Prowl again, not seeing the hand \nhe held out to touch her until it actually did.\nShe flinched a bit but she was so tired she didn&#39;t care...as long as he \ndidn&#39;t try and pick her up or anything.\n\nShe whimpered a bit as she just stood there, looking at the floor. She hurt \nand she didn&#39;t like it, and Prowl was hurt and she didn&#39;t like it.\nAnd most of all, she was so confused.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
