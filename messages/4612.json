I and Bazooka are some of the \noriginal Destrons. We have no connection to the Decpticons, although we did \nat one point. We all under went a procedure that will prevent the destruction \nof us if the Decpticons were destroyed in the past. This only went down \nrecently after we learned that the Maximals and Predacons were fighting on \npast Earth. Now if you decide to join me then I will have you under go the \nsame procedure It will remove all traces of Autobot or Decpticon within you. \nShredder, I can give you a beast mode if you wish for one, although you seem \nto not need one. Now as for you Mantella I can change your beast mode to \nsomething more powerful. Whatever you prefer.&quot;\n\n"}}
