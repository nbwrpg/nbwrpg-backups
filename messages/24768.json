He see&#39;s the attack...and the \nEnergonians.\n&gt;        &quot;Ominous Prime? He&#39;s returned? This is a rather interesting \nturn of \n&gt; events, yes.&quot; Megatron says, as he picks up speed to get a shot at \nKillfest.\n&gt;        He see&#39;s him throw Aerostreak as if he were a toy...and then \nblast him \n&gt; with two missles. Megatron brought his dino-arm shoulder blasters \nonline, and \n&gt; fired at Killfest. &quot;If you want revenge, Killfest, I suggest you \nget it while \n&gt; you can! Yes!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor drives as the two missle burst behinde him, sending \nhim \n&gt; stumbling forward a bit. He turns to see the reinforcements have \narrived. At \n&gt; least it brings a little relief. He raises his arm back at \nEndbringer, and \n&gt; begins to shoot off plasma blast after plasma blast at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Akron is sent flying backward from the shot, but quickly \ngets up as \n&gt; the energy from the shot rushes through her body like a jolt of \nenergy. &quot;Come \n&gt; on, big boy. Lets get tough!&quot; She says, and, taking out her energon \nriffle, \n&gt; begins to fire off shots at his face.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Putnam is hit by Goldeneye, but flies up above her and kicks \nhard. \n&gt; &quot;Give me the vermine!
