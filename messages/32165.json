Thank you all for \nbeing patient with me :)\n\nMantle watched most of his missiles fail to hit and sighed. These bots were \nmore than the normal attackers that he was used to fighting, but challenge \nwas always good.\n\n&quot;Whoa!&quot; he exclaimed when a shadow passed over him from a gestalt forming, \nthen another shadow from another gestalt. This was getting very interesting! \nHe saw Prowl transform into a big monster, and then decided to bring out the \nbig guns. &quot;Eletors, unite!&quot; he yeled the order and looked down to see the \nEletors reacting to the call. Aqua and Rubble transformed into legs, Cinder \nand Mist into arms, and Mantle, last but not least, into the torso and head \nof Element. The huge robot stretched to his full height, taller than any of \nthe others by two or three feet. The confident personality of the five \ncombined minds took control.\n\n&quot;You&#39;d better run now and save your life, Decepticon,&quot; said Element while \napproaching Abominus, the gestalt that was closest to him. A plate on each \nshoulder slid aside and a missile launcher emerged to cover the space where \nthe plates were. The two launchers locked onto Abominus and fired two \nmissiles each, mentally guided by Element to hit their target.\n\n\nCyndro saw that his weapon fire was getting close to hitting the Maximals, \nand eased off of the enemies that were close to friends. Instead, he \nconcentrated on the gestalts, using the missile launchers of the Element as \nhis main weapon. Two missile launchers locked onto each enemy gestalt, each \none firing two missiles. The missiles that were fired were radio-guided by \nCyndro to hit their targets. His other weapons focused on the lone bots that \nwern&#39;t close to Maximals. He sent three EMP blasts along with several laser \nshots at Divebomb, and the same barrauge of weaponfire at Rampage. His \njammers were still blocking any transmissions by anyone but the Maximals and \nthe bots that were assisting them, so the attackers wouldn&#39;t be able to send \nfor reinforcements or communicate with each other.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
