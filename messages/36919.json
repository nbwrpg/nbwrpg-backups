Stay in groups and work together. If the target is hit, the beams will back off a bit. They will also go for individuals more than groups, so work together.&quot;\n\nShe throws the ball into the beams, and it bounces off, heading for the group of Maximals. Iron Raptor backs up and watches them spring into action (hopefully), tapping a button to contact Cyndro.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm is the first to jump forward as the ball flies toward the group, hitting it toward the target. However, a beam hits it back and then rams Firearm, sending him down on his knees, gritting his teeth.\n\n&quot;Slagging things,&quot; he mutters as he jumps up and out of the way of a beam.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCledar and his group also get into action, the ball now flying toward Ratchet though. They spread out, however, ready to help out.\n\n\n"}}
