He then looked \naround\n&gt; him, noticing he was not in the most suitable position however. He \nhad\n&gt; accomplished their main objective however. He stopped swinging the \nmace,\n&gt; and his shoulder cannon emitting a blast of stored energy straight \nat\n&gt; the ground, pushing up the dirt, and creating a lot of smoke, \nencircling\n&gt; Megatron. He then glew out of it, and towards \nAstroblast. &quot;Astroblast,\n&gt; transform&quot; he ordered.\n\n\n"}}
