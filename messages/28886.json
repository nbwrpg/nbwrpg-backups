Had dinner with friends.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whimpers came from the kit when she couldn&#39;t feed, her tiny tummy \n&gt; grumbling \n&gt; &gt; with an empty sound.\n&gt; &gt; The sound of the thing that was holding her wasn&#39;t mommy and she \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; confused. Where was the warm side and milk her brain was trying \nto \n&gt; find?\n&gt; &gt; She was starting to make tiny yipps when she was suddenly washed, \n&gt; &gt; remembering how her mothers tongue use to run over her back and \nshe \n&gt; became \n&gt; &gt; quiet, thinking mommy had come back.\n&gt; &gt; And on reaction she tried to find the war side and suckle but \nthere \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; nothing there! Mommy was just there, where was she again?\n&gt; &gt; The she-kit turned a bit in Starice&#39;s arms, thinking that the \nwarm \n&gt; side was \n&gt; &gt; just behind her where it usually was when it wasn&#39;t in front.\n&gt; &gt; But it wasn&#39;t there either!\n&gt; &gt; Milk! Where was milk? Where there was milk there was mommy.\n&gt; &gt; By this time Starice had taken the kit to the lab, and all the \n&gt; sounds \n&gt; &gt; confusing the baby and making her mew/whine.\n&gt; &gt; (mews are little whimpering sounds for the baby)\n&gt; &gt; Now time passed and before and knew it something strange smelling \n&gt; was put by \n&gt; &gt; her nose (e-cubes + o-food). She didn&#39;t know what it was so she \n&gt; sniffed the \n&gt; &gt; cubes, the smell not registering in her mind as something she \ncould \n&gt; eat but \n&gt; &gt; when her nose touched a cube sitting on top another one the jerky \n&gt; movements \n&gt; &gt; of her body made it fall off, surprising her and she yipped.\n&gt; &gt; Drawing back into Starice&#39;s arms she cuddled into them, trying to \n&gt; hide from \n&gt; &gt; what made the scary sound. But soon she became brave since there \n&gt; was no more \n&gt; &gt; of the sound and moved in Starice&#39;s arms again, suddenly bumping \n&gt; her nose on \n&gt; &gt; her fingers.\n&gt; &gt; The shape of their tips reminded her of her mother&#39;s teats  and \nshe \n&gt; opened \n&gt; &gt; her tiny mouth, trying to suckle from them.\n&gt; &gt; Her mind thinking milk again. Her itty-bitty paws moved \nunsteadily \n&gt; towards \n&gt; &gt; the sides of Starice&#39;s hand, trying to massage the milk from \n&gt; mommy&#39;s side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
