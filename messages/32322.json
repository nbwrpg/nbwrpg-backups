I made a mistake and accused\n&gt; JP of moding, which he didn&#39;t do. That does not mean that everyone\n&gt; needs to jump up yelling at each other. If things arn&#39;t peaceful soon,\n&gt; everyone will be sent to their respective bases and we&#39;ll all have to\n&gt; sit like little kids and think about what we did. But seriously, lets\n&gt; calm down and play politely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, KSL, can you please post? I know not everyone you fired at has\n&gt; responded yet, but not posting is holding everyone up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
