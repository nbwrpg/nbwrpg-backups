But another group \nof \n&gt; &gt; Predacons turned up led by Galvatron - the mutated nutcase that \n&gt; &gt; Unicron made of the original Megatron.  He&#39;d been reformatted to \na \n&gt; &gt; Pred himself and the two got into a fight.  There was an \naccident, \n&gt; &gt; and the two fused.  Boom!  Instant super-robot!  And Hydras is, \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; what I&#39;ve seen, even crazier than his component parts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Standing still, she pondered & let sink in what Wheeljack \nsaid. &#39;Functioning? \n&gt; How?&#39; Last she knew.. they... he.. was terminated... gone. & \nanother \n&gt; Megatron. How could there be another? This made her far more \ncurious. \n&gt; Questions arose that she wanted answered. One way or another, she \nwould have \n&gt; them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Seemed she would find this Hydras & find out what was going on. \nBut... not \n&gt; show herself until she gained her old form back. Perhaps, if there \nwas any \n&gt; memories in Hydras of Megatron&#39;s & Galvatron&#39;s, then he would \nsurely know who \n&gt; she was. But for now... in this updated Beast Machine form, she \nwould \n&gt; observe. AS she would keep a watch upon the Ark. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I look forward to my reconstructed form soon. I shall return in a \nfew days.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She held out a clawed hand to Wheeljack to shake his hand. &quot;Thank \nyou. You \n&gt; have earned my respect.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hey, no problem.&quot;  Jackie shakes her hand firmly.  &quot;I earned a \nliving helping people.  It&#39;s a hobby.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
