Engage and kill all the invaders,&quot; he says to \n&gt; Scattershot, Nemesis, Serpentor, and Unitron as he takes careful \naim, \n&gt; firing his plasma launcher at Shockaract.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike flies in behind Shockaract&#39;s group, recieving Zardus&#39; \n&gt; orders. He takes out his rocket launcher, firing it at Airbomber.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer stops in his tracks, his face breaking into a smile as he \n&gt; recieves Zardus&#39; transmission. Battle was good, better than chasing \n&gt; some bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; He nearly crashes into the pod before he sees it, stopping a few \n&gt; inches in front of it (Airshadow&#39;s new char). He smiles, looking at \n&gt; it and waiting for it to scan a beast mode.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc nods, checking his internal scanner as he looks at Chaos and \n&gt; Minion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Gunfire! There&#39;s a battle at the nearest base,&quot; he suddenly says, \n&gt; his eyes lighting up at the thought of battle, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He transforms into his Ju 87 Stuka (German WW2 jet, the one with \nthe \n&gt; sirens), flying off toward the Alliance base. Repressor, \ntransforming \n&gt; into an attack chopper, follows after him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Burning Hammer ran outside and looked off and seen Shokaract&#39;s \nteam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Looks like they are just standing there, not doing anything, \nmaybe \n&gt; they are\n&gt; &gt; peaceful? I hope not.&quot; Burning Hammer says. Airbomber and Time \nWarp \n&gt; slowly\n&gt; &gt; walk up to the Alliance base, and come right up to Burning Hammer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I await orders good old fearless leader.&quot; Burning Hammer says \n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; commlink to Zardus. Time Warp started to say something and then \n&gt; fired a bolt\n&gt; &gt; into Burning Hammer&#39;s head. Burning Hammer falls and lays there. \n&gt; Time Warp\n&gt; &gt; aims at the base, but is knocked over. Burning Hammer is up and \n&gt; punching\n&gt; &gt; away at him. Airbomber points his gun at the back of Burning \n&gt; Hammer&#39;s head.\n&gt; &gt; Burning Hammer swings his hand and knocks it across the \nlandscape. \n&gt; Hefires a\n&gt; &gt; fireball into Airbomber and blasts him backwards.
