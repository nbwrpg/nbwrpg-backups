He was caught but he still had a small ace in=\r\n the hole.  He remembers the finger darts in his left hand, and quickly poi=\r\nnts the finger darts at a pair of eyes on Hydras&#39;s dragon head.  Small as t=\r\nhey were, they could still sting like crazy.  He was a pretty sharp shooter=\r\n with the finger darts, which happened to be one of his most favorite weapo=\r\nns.  He lets two darts fire, and also saves a couple for Scorponok&#39;s eyes a=\r\ns well, with a bit of fancy rapid firing.\n\n&quot; Not if I can help it.&quot;\n\nAt the=\r\n same time, he opens his com link to Lord Elder.
