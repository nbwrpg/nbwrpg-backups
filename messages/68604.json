A quick laser burst to his right shoulder. The force sends him flying in a spiral only to land hard and drop his weapons.

What he sees changes his face into a look of disgusted shock...&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Grimlock: R.. r... Rod-dee-mus...! Why you shoot Grimlock? Why you painted black?

He growls out in pain. All he can do it look on in horror at the bot that he once called Autobot Commander.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;The heavy black feet step close to the fallen Dinobot.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Rodimus: Silence you pathetic throwback.
