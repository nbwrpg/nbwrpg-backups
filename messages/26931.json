He reached out to intocate something but Iron Raptor only moved \nher arm so that he couldn&#39;t see past it and only could notice what was \nahead.\nIron Raptor heard/saw well just what Prowl was thinking the wondered if men \ncould get any denser. (no offence to males.) By Prowl&#39;s opinion it was \nalright to meet eachother one day and basically be in bed together a few \ndays later...which is basically what they did.\nHe had rights to his thoughts and so did she, so she said nothing of it.\nIron Raptor sighed when Prowl asked her the question she had been expecting \nsince she had thought up those opinions on their relationship so far.\nAnd she wasn&#39;t afraid to be blunt about it.\n&lt; No, I don&#39;t.&gt;\nShe openly regreated it. A mistake.\nShe didn&#39;t regret the love expressed, just that it was too soon and she \nbarely even knew him now. Besides, she could only read the parts of his mind \nthat he decided to show her, and those were the parts he thought about.\nIron Raptor glanced at Prowl.\nAll she knew was his name and what his part in the Beast Wars was.\nShe didn&#39;t know where he came from, though had a hunch that it was from \nCybertron.\nShe didn&#39;t know if he had any family, previouse lived, anything like that \nshe knew exactly Zippo about.\nBut he really didn&#39;t know her all that well either.\nNot where she came from, not what she was, nothing.\nIt was time to get to work on those sorts of things.\nShe did love him. Or what she thought she felt was love.\nIron Raptor sighed inwardly.\nFrom a manufactoring date she was lass then 11 years old, and that was new \nfor a prototype. But her mind was advanced not because it was programmed to \nbut because she had learned in a very quick amount of time, and so had a \nmature view of life from day 1.\nBut there was still so much to learn, like the emotions she was surrounded \nby every day and ones which clouded her mind all too often. So she wanted to \ngo slow, to get every detale, even in matters like love.\nAnd that&#39;s part of why that day was a mistake.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
