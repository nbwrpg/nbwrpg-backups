Again and again she \nhit the wall as hard as she could.  It sent out a vibrating noise through \nout the room and into the hallway.  She stopped for a moment and thought \nthings through.\n&quot;Get a grip mouse.  He&#39;s a high ranking commander.  Give up the ideas.  I&#39;m \nnothing more that a bot to command.  Get used to it. Besides, he&#39;s got a bot \nto himself and would never think of me as such anyway.&quot;\n\nShe sighed and sat o the edge of her bed.\n\n&quot;OK, let&#39;s get the logic circuits in order.  He has another bot.  I have had \nno contact with him until now.  He&#39;s my commander.  And I need to get a \ngrip.  Ok got find Megatron and gets some orders and find something to do.  \nThat will help.&quot;\n\nShe walked out of her quarters with her logic circuits straightned out and \nwhistled down the hallway out to find Megatron and gets something to do. She \nwas dettermend not to get involved with any bot as long as she lived.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
