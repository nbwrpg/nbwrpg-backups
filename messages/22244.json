You see, in the event \nof \n&gt; your unfortunate death, we can bring you back so to speak. It&#39;s \n&gt; wonder how we have the technology now a days. You see, if we can \n&gt; salvage your original spark chamber, we can bring you back. In a \nway. \n&gt; It&#39;s so that even in a horrible battle, we shall not lose our \ntroops. \n&gt; Say one of your team is killed. We can bring him back through a \n&gt; prossess called cloning. But we must extact living DNA and keep it \n&gt; untill that time. Without the spark chamber we can&#39;t do it either. \nSo \n&gt; your troops would have to die first, then we can bring them back.  \n&gt; It&#39;s not hard and I can show you the prossess if you wish.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
