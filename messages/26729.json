Those \nof you whom I talk to outside of this know my personal opinions but this is \nnot about those.  This is about tact.\n\n    I am a cynic and a skeptic by nature.  I am also emotionally detached \nwhen it comes to matters of death and opinion.  JP, you made a foolish \nmistake by saying that in front of his friends.  I am not saying you are \nright or wrong, I have no way of knowing.  However this will not be finished \nuntil there is mourning, appropriate or not.  And I, for one, do not here to \nsee depressing comments and petty arguments.\n\n    I would like to end this message with one last piece of advice: Do not \npity those who have died by their own hand, for they no longer must cope with \nthe problems of life.  Pity those who must live with the consequences of his \ndecision.  Pity those who are forced to live with the people who brought him \nto the point where suicide is possible.  And finally, pity those who brought \nhim to the point where suicide is possible for they will be forever filled \nwith guilt for this tragedy.\n\n"}}
