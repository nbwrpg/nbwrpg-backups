In 1998, the Beast Wars \n2 cartoon came out in Japan with a new set of Cybertrons and Destrons facing \noff on the planet Gaea for something called Angolmois energy.  The Cybertron \nleader was Lioconvoy, a lion, and the leader of the Destrons was a new \nGalvatron, who was a dragon.  All the other toys were repaints of Beast Wars, \nGeneratrion 2, and even Generation 1 toys.  There was kind of a &quot;nature \nversus technology&quot; theme in the show quite similar to what Beast Machines \nwould later do, with the &quot;good guys&quot; being animals and the &quot;bad guys&quot; being \nvehicles.
