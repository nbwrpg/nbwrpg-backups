They\n&gt; had been collectively checking their weapons and getting ready for a\n&gt; fight. Now they just glanced at Hydras, but none dared to voice an\n&gt; opinion to their leader - Hydras&#39; word was law to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Inferno stood closer to his leader ready to defend him, the rest of\n&gt; them bracing themselves for what may be a battle!\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile seven tanks move quickly in Hydras&#39; direction, they look to\n&gt; each be large and powerfully built. The are primarily black and silver\n&gt; with bits of crimson that seemed to almost glow eerily as the large\n&gt; vehicles close in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally they reach Hydras&#39; is location and the lead tank shifts into\n&gt; robot mode, a large soldier. If anything he is larger, with tracking\n&gt; lights on either side of his head, multiple rocket and cannon mounts\n&gt; on his massive chest and a large gun mount on his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am Tankor.&quot; The soldier said simply, &quot;You will be escorted to the\n&gt; city.&quot; The other tanks surround Hydras and the others, their muzzles\n&gt; pointed at the group making Tankor&#39;s command even more forceful!\n&gt;\n&gt; Inferno made as if to step between Tankor to defend Hydras as the\n&gt; others seemed ready to attack!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
