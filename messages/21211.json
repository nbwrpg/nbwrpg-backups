He \nwas stuck in a shuttle with some pompous pain in the skid plate, and \na bot with a lisp, who apperently didn&#39;t mind being blown up.\n\nHe puts away his missile launcher, taking out a rifle instead.\n\n&quot;Allright, a rifle shot wouldn&#39;t kill us all,&quot; he says, aiming the \nrifle at Lady Hawk&#39;s head. He knew she could throw Najah into the \nshot, and he wasn&#39;t about to shoot, &quot;And if you don&#39;t be quiet, I&#39;m \ngoing to take your head to Zardus, dragging your body behind me.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Najah::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yesss yessss&quot; said happily the snake &quot;Tht would be \nglouriosssss.... \n&gt; we blowing up in piecessssss&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk laughs at Repressors statement. &quot;And your mentality is \n&gt; &gt; likely to offline us all.&quot; she knew what would happen if he fired \na \n&gt; &gt; missle in such small quarters. &quot;Your missle would destroy the \n&gt; control \n&gt; &gt; system in this shuttle and send us all plumetting to our ends. \n&gt; except \n&gt; &gt; that the missle would have destroyed Najah and I first.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
