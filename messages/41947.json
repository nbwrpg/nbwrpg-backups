But my vacation was interesting.  My First week I \n&gt; was up in Montreat with some church retreat thing with 17 other high \n&gt; schoolers, and that was the best vacation of my Life. My second week \n&gt; I went fly fishing in the Rockies.  I hate Fly fishing.  It was the \n&gt; worst vacation of my life.  Well, I guess I should end this OOC \n&gt; before Yanshosh starts yelling at me about it.  Well anyway, can \n&gt; someone tell me what happen while I was chilling on the best vacation \n&gt; of my life and the worst vacation of my life.\n\n\n"}}
