The social intrigues of Pred=\r\nacon life was not his\n&gt; &gt; typical interest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Perhaps that is why T=\r\narantulus chose this moment to reveal her.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; SKYSHADOW said. &quot;She may be=\r\n able to get closer to Hydras or Cryotek\n&gt; &gt; then he could.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - DI=\r\nNOBOT&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a contemplative pause from DINOBOT.  &quot;Perhpas.  But t=\r\nhere aer too many pieces to this puzzle.  The Schemings of TARANTALUS, HYDR=\r\nAS, and CRYOTEK as well, and the ongoing schemes of each of their own under=\r\nlings.  This situation is too complex even within our own forces.  And we h=\r\nave the Maximals and the followers of UNICRON to deal with as well, and oth=\r\ner things.  We spend too much of our time dealing with internal issues.  Pa=\r\nh.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Walking along then as the trio stomped off towards TARANTALUS&#39; bay=\r\n.  &quot;And I am interested in finding out just how he was able to restore a pr=\r\notoform without the rest of us knowing, Yess..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nARANTULUS sighed as he looked at BLACKARACHNIA, for a moment his\n&gt; &gt; insani=\r\nty falling away to reveal the true malevolent intellect that\n&gt; &gt; drove him.=\r\n &quot;Sometime we must all do things that we don&#39;t want to do\n&gt; &gt; dear to survi=\r\nve. As for CRYOTEK, that is why you are here, find out\n&gt; &gt; what you can.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And then HYDRAS approached. TARANTULUS gave BLACKARACHNIA a knowing=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; look before he turned to face HYDRAS.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a smirk from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;I thought the addage was &#39;any p=\r\nort in a storm for the rats deserting the sinking ships&#39;?  If you&#39;re going =\r\nto do something you don&#39;t like, you can at least be accurate as to your own=\r\n circumstances.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And then of his instructions over she nodded.  &quot;So, d=\r\no you want to do this the old fashioned way or other then?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD - HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras:: &quot;Deal, my tutor&quot;hissed Hydras with a smile=\r\n and added to hid comlink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Inferno, report?&quot; The Hydras came in the r=\r\noom and looking at both spiders\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said harshly&quot;TArantulus how did you e=\r\nxplain this... unusual and non\n&gt; &gt; &gt; autorized Project????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD -=\r\n CRYOTEK AND COMPANY&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; CRYOTEK nodded as he followed behind HYDRAs,=\r\n seemingly content to walk\n&gt; &gt; in his student&#39;s shadow, his malevolent opti=\r\ncs staring balefully into\n&gt; &gt; the room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a dark and wicke=\r\nd chuckled from TARANTULUS, his apparent\n&gt; &gt; bout of lucidity gone in an in=\r\nstant as he turned to face HYDRAS, &quot;She\n&gt; &gt; is my project. I found her, I b=\r\nuilt her and now I have restored her to\n&gt; &gt; the perfection that she was mea=\r\nnt to be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TARANTULUS waved in the direction of BLACKARACNIA his h=\r\nand going from\n&gt; &gt; her shoulders to her hand, displaying her in much the sa=\r\nme way an\n&gt; &gt; artist might display his best most treasured piece of art. &quot;S=\r\nhe is\n&gt; &gt; everything she was meant to be and more.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; INFERNO who ha=\r\nd been with HYDRAS up this point turned to him, I am here sir.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW WASPINATOR/BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, as INFERNO came in escort=\r\ning HYDRAS and CRYOTEK, and TARANTALUS pointed over to BLACKARACHNIA, the f=\r\nirst to break the silence before any of the other officers was..\n&gt; \n&gt; WASPI=\r\nANTOR.  &quot;Oooh, Spider-Bot hazz radioactive Spider-Babe.  Wazzzpinator remem=\r\nberzz!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, there was a SIGH from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;The more =\r\nthings change..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning over to CRYOTEK and HYDRAS, and giving a lazy=\r\n twirl and pirouette, winking her optic unit over at CRYOTEK, &quot;A pleasure t=\r\no make your..  Acquiantance.&quot;  Giving a sultry drop of her vocalizer over a=\r\nt HYDRAS&#39; direction and then to CRYOTEK.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
