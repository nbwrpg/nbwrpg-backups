She closed her eyes and felt her\n&gt; skin start to tingle.  She felt the outside of her skin start to harden.\n&gt; Her eyes were glazed over as the scales changed from her normal scales to\n&gt; those about to be shed.  She smiled and then with one quick movement, she\n&gt; slit the top scales on her head with her claw and pulled the old skin off\n&gt; her body.  She stepped out of the skin and stood there, a renewed snake.\nHer\n&gt; new scales were jet black, soft and supple, shiny and seductive.  She went\n&gt; to the mirror and looked at her new scales. &quot;Hsssssss, I like thisss new\n&gt; ssskin. Perhapsss the othersss will admire it asss much asss I.&quot; And with\n&gt; that, she left her room and went to the main communications room.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Original Message--------\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Diamond::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She was bored out of her scales.
