He had to \n&gt; admit that for a Predacon &quot;B&quot; um I mean Witch she was atractive. He \n&gt; just didn&#39;t want to be fooled by another pretty face. &quot;You want to \n&gt; know why I broke in here? I don&#39;t even know that, It&#39;s my function, \n&gt; It&#39;s what I do.&quot; he knew that Name Function and online date were \nthe \n&gt; three things a POW could offer. &quot;Now what makes me so special that \n&gt; you&#39;d go so far out of your way to track me down just to let me go \n&gt; again?&quot; He wasn&#39;t used to the offer she was making him.

And I swore that no harm would \n&gt; &gt; come to you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She no longer really wanted this bot. For anything. She only \nwanted \n&gt; &gt; him to leave. She didn&#39;t see him as a threat. If anything, she \n&gt; hoped \n&gt; &gt; that she might gain him as an ally.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You intrieg me Fox. You came here, stole stuff from my lab. You \n&gt; &gt; obviously had a reason, and I wish to know that reason. I will \nnot \n&gt; &gt; harm you. Once you have ansered my questions,&quot; she looked down, \n&gt; &gt; knowing she would live to regret this,&quot;I will let you go. No \nharm, \n&gt; no \n&gt; &gt; fight.

He wasn&#39;t lieing, he had a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; detonator, he just didn&#39;t have the explosives to back it up. It \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gamble but he was quickly running out of options. His bag of \n&gt; tricks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was running low too. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; KitKat wanted him alive he wanted to know why. &quot;Whats so \n&gt; important \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about me that you&#39;d let me live?&quot; he asked directly.
