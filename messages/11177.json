He sat up and turned \nto the side of his bunk. He looked around, satisfied with his \nquarters. \n\nHe stood up and walked to the threshold of the room. He looked \naround, noticing the hallway was empty. He leaned against the frame \nof the threshold and watched for any sound or movement. This was the \nsetback of not being on the run without cover of a well guarded ship \nlike this one is that there were some dull moments. He had his many \nexperieances with Megatron&#39;s old ship.\n\nHe just idled there, ankles crossed and shoulder leaned against the \nframe until he thought of something or someone appeared.\n\n\n"}}
