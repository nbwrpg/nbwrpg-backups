She saw the trees go by in a blurr as \nshe ran past.  She had tears running down her cheeks as she ran.  She \nhad pain in her chest,  it ws from the hurt she had for Land Mine.\nShe tried to out run the pain.  She dodged trees and fallen logs.  \nShe really didn&#39;t know where she was going or even cared.  Her hurt \nand pain was driving her. Everywhere she looked, she saw Land Mine.  \nShe felt her face feel cold as the wind touched her tears as they ran \ndown her face.  \n\nShe kept running.  She had no idea where she was going, she just kept \nrunning.\n\n\n"}}
