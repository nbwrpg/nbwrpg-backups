So there&#39;s no way he coudl have =\r\nbeen there, and he wouldn&#39;t have gone back over to them! So will pose this =\r\nas taking place out in the ship corridors. Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I appreci=\r\nate your posting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how you have each and every charac=\r\nter of your&#39;s coming up, then doing something to me, then knowing each and =\r\nevery thing that happened to each adn every other one that did, and them al=\r\nl having the exact same opinions over on everyone as everyone else did. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, unless your characte ris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emph=\r\natically order him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere f=\r\nar else after you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to =\r\ngo back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s =\r\nnot especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well when =\r\nI posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him, please g=\r\nive me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two times you posed hi=\r\nm extensively going with your characters when it was not in character for h=\r\nim to do so.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; If your characters have had interactions with him in =\r\nthe past or things I should know of, let me know? As I have no idea where W=\r\nheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they would have remotely konwn of one =\r\nanother, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the past, =\r\nwhen I have no idea of that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So again, if they&#39;ve had interactions=\r\n as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic history so I can respond appropriately=\r\n. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a c=\r\nhance to respond appropriately if he does or not, or make it something like=\r\n a specific order in the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rather w=\r\neird how your characers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opini=\r\nnos and back one another up to the hilt on thier interactions and everythin=\r\ng. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by this.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand I&#39;m n=\r\new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather hemmed=\r\n in on the character with what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how thing=\r\ns operate, and how you have all of your alts congregating and making me fee=\r\nl pressed into a corner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bi=\r\nt too negative, thank you very much for the welcome here and for playing wt=\r\nih me and interacting with Wheelie.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;Back In Character&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; W=\r\nheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at him, &quot;What is this =\r\nwith all of you?

If that&#39;s what you want, that&#39;s fine by me, Wheelie.=\r\n&nbsp; But keep in \n  mind, it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a friend as well as a c=\r\nomrade by your side.

He heaves a sigh and kneels dow=\r\nn to \n    Wheelie.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; I was going to give you a lecture and=\r\n a warning \n    but I realize you just comeback online after many vorns . Y=\r\nou were not aware \n    of my change of status to Prime office and perhaps m=\r\nistook me for my \n    previous status. I&#39;ll let it go this one time, Wheeli=\r\ne but keep in mind that \n    a Prime is a Prime no matter who they are. All=\r\n right, you&#39;re free to roam \n    the Auto base now. Please try not to get s=\r\nent to my office again, \n    okay?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With a smile of unders=\r\ntanding, Tucson opens the door \n    to let Wheelie go on his way. Once havi=\r\nng let Wheelie free, he waits for \n    Talon with a light hearted smile on =\r\nhis face.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OOC - Uhm, I \n    posted Wheelie leaving your qua=\r\nrters and he never entered them in the first \n    place, then him heading o=\r\nut. So there&#39;s no way he coudl have been there, and \n    he wouldn&#39;t have g=\r\none back over to them! So will pose this as taking place \n    out in the sh=\r\nip corridors. Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I appreciate your posting, \n    but it&#39;s=\r\n sort of weird how you have each and every character of your&#39;s \n    coming =\r\nup, then doing something to me, then knowing each and every thing \n    that=\r\n happened to each adn every other one that did, and them all having the \n  =\r\n  exact same opinions over on everyone as everyone else did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, =\r\n\n    unless your characte ris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emphatically=\r\n order \n    him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere far =\r\nelse after \n    you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him t=\r\no go back to \n    Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing whe=\r\nn he&#39;s not \n    especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else a=\r\ns well when I \n    posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere w=\r\nith him, please give \n    me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s =\r\ntwo times you posed him \n    extensively going with your characters when it=\r\n was not in character for him \n    to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your characters have=\r\n had interactions with him in the \n    past or things I should know of, let=\r\n me know? As I have no idea where \n    Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or ho=\r\nw they would have remotely konwn of one \n    another, and you&#39;ve posted rep=\r\neaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the past, \n    when I have no idea of th=\r\nat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, if they&#39;ve had interactions as \n    NPC&#39;s, let me know=\r\n their generic history so I can respond appropriately. If \n    he&#39;s going t=\r\no be told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a chance \n    to res=\r\npond appropriately if he does or not, or make it something like a \n    spec=\r\nific order in the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rather weird \n =\r\n   how your characers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opinino=\r\ns \n    and back one another up to the hilt on thier interactions and everyt=\r\nhing. I \n    feel kind of wedged into a corner by this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand=\r\n I&#39;m new to \n    the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel ra=\r\nther hemmed in on \n    the character with what you&#39;re doing and am confused=\r\n as to how things \n    operate, and how you have all of your alts congregat=\r\ning and making me feel \n    pressed into a corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, sorry if=\r\n this is coming fof a bit too \n    negative, thank you very much for the we=\r\nlcome here and for playing wtih me \n    and interacting with Wheelie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;Back In \n    Character&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in th=\r\ne hall, gazes over \n    at him, &quot;What is this with all of you? You&#39;re back =\r\nand forth whatever I do. \n    This is what Prime is, just a rank? It seems =\r\nlike it&#39;s just sort of dank. We \n    had four of five in a room, that&#39;s not=\r\n a level of doom and \n    gloom.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, walking away from Tuscon, bu=\r\nt looking behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad \n    you&#39;re good with all of your friends, cong=\r\nrualtions on the promotion and to \n    whatever ends. But we, we were never=\r\n friends. We went back and forth in our \n    ways, and I respect your order=\r\ns for these days. But we&#39;re not here to have \n    fun, we&#39;re here to fight =\r\nand run and gun.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelie leaning against \n    the wall, &quot;I&#39;ll work =\r\nwtih you, if you do tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is \n    hell. I&#39;d pref=\r\ner to keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they \n    try and =\r\nbe nice. But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to \n    d=\r\no, or how you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew. So by al lmeans, give me some =\r\n\n    space, we&#39;re here to fight for the future of our race.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR: white=\r\n;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR: white;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-22--1042620721--\r\n\n"}}
