I will accept that absorbing thing however as for \nusing \n&gt; it to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy \n&gt; absorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in \n&gt; Blacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it \n&gt; suddenly &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also \nnote \n&gt; that energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since \n&gt; Blacknightmare isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is \n&gt; specifically created to be used solely by those he creates it would \n&gt; have a very bad negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed \nit \n&gt; and/or tried to use it to improve anything. I will not reply until \n&gt; you have replied to this. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: GREAT JOB Legendary Nemesys!!!!!  but let me ask you what&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; infectrons beliefs, if their balief are &quot;Peace&quot; why Zero is \nchasing \n&gt; &gt; them?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would \n&gt; fight; \n&gt; &gt; like the three ladies she could aborb any type of energy and use \nit \n&gt; &gt; against her enemies, but she has a diference: she could use that \n&gt; &gt; energy to improve herself.... but that happen rarely.
