Shortly before he was going to turn he spoted\na figure.  Probably and animal, but he wasn&#39;t sure. \nHe went to robot mode and a laser sword poped out of\nhis wrist compartment.  He dropped straight at\nNightshade.\n\nOOC: I had posted that when he was on the ground and\nNightshade was trying to flank him he planted a\ngrenade where he was likely to step on it as he moved.\n\n--- Jonathan &lt;jhogan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sunhawk:  Gotta&#39; get back to Talos....gotta&#39; get\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; troops... gotta&#39; finish the Predicons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Nightshade}\n&gt; \n&gt;     A swift and silent shadow darted across the\n&gt; landscape mirroring the bird\n&gt; bots path, her beast form ran silently as she bound\n&gt; behind and to the far\n&gt; left of Sunhawk. In the confusion of the general\n&gt; melee she had taken the\n&gt; opportunity to position herself apart from both\n&gt; groups to follow the maximal\n&gt; in the inevitable retreat he had to make.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Some cards had to be thrown on the table if the\n&gt; bot was the example of\n&gt; the maximals that were on their trail. Smiling a\n&gt; foxy grin she quickened her\n&gt; pace to make sure she didn&#39;t lose the flyer. She was\n&gt; careful to keep her\n&gt; signature masked so he couldn&#39;t detect her with\n&gt; sensors, unless he turned\n&gt; and actively searched the ground she doubted he&#39;d\n&gt; notice her.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
