FOLLOW MY SIGNAL!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As Hydras gives the order the other Predacons transform into to Beast \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to make their get away, the vast majority of them taking to =\r\nthe air! The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; large door on the black Tower opens as Scourge and Cyclo=\r\nnus fly out, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of them already in their aerial modes, boost=\r\ners flaring as they hit the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skies!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However as they fly th=\r\ney can almost immediately make out the form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord as he carried=\r\n Rat Trap in his claws, the duo began to change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their vector of fligh=\r\nt, angling towards them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Cyclonus transmited over his ra=\r\ndio to Hydras, &quot;The Maximals that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempted to break into the Fortres=\r\ns are trying to make their get away \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well. Shall we terminat=\r\ne them?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They began to fly after Windlord, their superior speed=\r\n in the air making\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it easy for them to begin to close the distance be=\r\ntween them, rocket and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missile launchers beginning to glow as they ta=\r\nrgeted the flying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile on the ground,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torca nodded as Hydras and the other Predacons began to back off. =\r\n&quot;We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fuzors don&#39;t have wheels and drive.&quot; He said to Nightshift as loo=\r\nked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around and then glanced back at Tuscon in vehicular mode. &quot;But le=\r\nt&#39;s see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what we can do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;BANTOR!&quot; Torca called out, &quot;Bea=\r\nst Mode!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Maximal in question quickly transformed into the =\r\nsomewhat bizzar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alternate mode, becoming a cross between a baboon and=\r\n a Tiger; looking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strong and powerful, even if unconventional.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that Torca transformed into his beastmode as well, that of an\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; elephant and a Killer whale. He along with Bantor positioned themselves=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the front of Tuscon. &quot;We won&#39;t be the fastest things, but =\r\nwe can get you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home.&quot; Torca said as he waited to pull.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ab=\r\nove their heads Noctorro, Air Hammer and Silverbolt take to the skies,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; becoming an aerial escort to the injured Maximals and Autobots!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
