It would be a short while before\nthe medical staff returned from their trip retrieving SILVERBOLT and\nTUSCON and then another while as they had to go back out and get the\nrest of the FUZORS.\n\nWING CALIBER turned to look at the PADD in his hand as he talked to\nNIGHTSHIFT, &quot;So who got the scan from Dark Rodimus? Is he still\nholding the matrix?&quot; CALIBER&#39;s voice had a knowing sound to it as he\nprobrably already knew that no one had yet. The PADD he was holding\nhad the current reports on it.\n\nHe turned to look at the shuttle as it was coming in for a landing the\nbay door already opening. &quot;Leo Prime I am sure will have a lot to to\ndiscuss with everyone, as he will probrably want to hear everyone&#39;s\nreport first hand.&quot; WING CALIBER stowed his PADD in subspace as he\nwalked towards the shuttle.\n\n&quot;Perhaps you should take Elita to her chambers?&quot; CALBER said as he\nshook his head ruefully. &quot;I believe that this debacle far from over. I\nhope Tuscon is ready for it.&quot;\n\nAlready SANTON and BUMP could be seen hovering over SILVERBOLT as they\nprepped to bring him in as the feeding tubes were retracting from\nTUSCON - He could get more once they got him inside.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
