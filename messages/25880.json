His from \narms/linms began to paw out towards the approaching land and his legs \ndangled down under him.\nLand! Land! That was all he could think about!\nD barked and growled, his fur bristling along his back and shoulders, ears \nlayed back against his head.\nHe had never actually seen a world before, always been in the scientific \nvessel and what black space was beyond it. This was new.\nThe color, the vastness...the NOISE!\nD kept struggling. He didn&#39;t mean to be rude and all by moving so much. He \njudt wanted down.\nThough it did pass through his mind that this woman, so the smell told him \nit was femm, might not know that all he wanted was to feel earth under his \npaws.*\n\n&quot; Down! DOWN!&quot;\n\n* He howled. His voice wasn&#39;t gruff when he spoke words; it was rather \nsmooth and young. But it was quite different when he made the sounds in \nwhich his creature form could make.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
