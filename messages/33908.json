Two of the shells hit him\nin\n&gt; the back, exploding with a loud blast of noise, and sent the\nDecepticon\n&gt; falling towards Shockwave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beastbox on the other hand was glad that Incinerator had turned his\n&gt; attention to Speedbreaker. He maneuvered himself towards the enemy\nnow,\n&gt; closing the gap between them. He fired again as he aproached.\n\n\n"}}
