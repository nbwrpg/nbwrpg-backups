Under him, the vast expanse of trees flashed by. He \ncould see the startled animals dive out of the way as he flew by. \nSwirling to avoid a high tree, the bot shot upwards, heading toward \nspace.\n\nHe had no idea where he was heading. He was simply flying. Something \npulled on the back of his mind. There was something he couldn&#39;t \nremember, something very important.\n\nSlayer yelled out as he felt a pain in his back. He spun around, \nlooking into the eyes of an wolf. Lunarpine.\n\nThe two wolves transformed into robot mode and hovered in the air. \nSlayer leapt forward, trying to tackle Lunarpine.\n\nThe mutant simply laughed and stretched out an arm. Slayer growled as \nhis body was suspended in the air. Lunarpine brought his hands \ntogether, the palms touching, and then suddenly moves them apart.\n\nSlayer yelled as pain shot through him. He looked down at his body, \nwhich was being torn apart by Lunarpine.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWith a roar, Slayer sits up on the table he had been layed on, ripping \nhis restrainta apart in the proccess.\n\nHe looks around. He was in a dark room, a familiar one. He had woken \nup here once before.\n\nSlayer gets off the table, readying his shoulder blasters and stepping \ntoward the door.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon was again sitting in his command chair.
