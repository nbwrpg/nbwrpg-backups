But she knew that she had to be a role model, \n&gt; and knew in her own heart, that Tucson wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and \n&gt; he was going to bring Rodimus back, no matter what was thrown in front of \n&gt; him.  She goes over to Elita, as Rat Trap follows her, wanting to help her \n&gt; out as well.  For a moment, they hold hands as they both smile into each \n&gt; other&#39;s eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot then goes to Elita, and puts a gentile hand on her shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; On Earth, there&#39;s this popular term known as &quot;The Knight in Shining \n&gt; Armor.&quot;  Who would ride into the occasion and smite evil demons when they \n&gt; threatened to cast darkness and dispair on the innocent.  Even though he \n&gt; doesn&#39;t ride a horse with fancy armor, and carry a lance and a shield, \n&gt; Tucson is one of those Knights.  He won&#39;t give up until the dragon or in \n&gt; this case, the insect is slayed and Rodimus brought safely back to \n&gt; consciousness.  He will win this battle for Rodimus, I know he will.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap thinks for a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ya know, she&#39;s got a point Elita, everything Wheels did up till now, and \n&gt; everything he actually succeeded in doing, that took real courage and \n&gt; determination and in those days, on Earth, that&#39;s what medevil knights are \n&gt; made of. So yeah, he&#39;s definitely one of them, a Knight in shining silver \n&gt; armor and when the lights strike against his paint job, he&#39;ll blind the \n&gt; eyes of those who aren&#39;t used to such light.  Your dad&#39;ll be saved, I know \n&gt; he will.  Wheels ain&#39;t gonna leave a fight unfaught.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift walks over to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Bet your rear bumpers he&#39;s not.  He&#39;s gonna kick bug aft big time, and \n&gt; when he does, he ain&#39;t gonna stop there, he&#39;s gonna fight hard until \n&gt; there&#39;s some sorta sense of peace on this planet. It&#39;s who he is and what \n&gt; he does.  And it&#39;s that drive that earned him his name in the first place. \n&gt; Eventually the Decepticons, Predacons and Unicronians are gonna definitely \n&gt; know who he is and what he&#39;s capable of doing.  Any decendent of Optimus \n&gt; Prime is gonna be sure the job gets done.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That gets a few heads to turn, as Quickstride, Rat Trap and Straight Shot \n&gt; look at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; What&#39;dya say?  No way, really?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Quickstride scratches behind an ear. Straight Shot and Rat Trap gawk.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wha?  Ya mean all this time I fought with Tucson in the past, and all \n&gt; along, come ta find out he&#39;s related ta Optimus Prime? Wow...  I - had no \n&gt; idea..  No wonder why he&#39;s got so much courage and determination and \n&gt; selflessness. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, that sure explains a lot.  I knew there was somethn&#39; familliar \n&gt; about &#39;em, but I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it till Nightshift said \n&gt; somethn&#39;.  Yeah, it makes sense, his alt form, a large truck with a large \n&gt; trailer, he&#39;s just as tall, body features almost like Optimus Prime&#39;s.. \n&gt; Slightly different but nearly the same.. And his voice, the patterns are \n&gt; almost like the big guy&#39;s..  But still I never really put that together \n&gt; until now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tucson doesn&#39;t know that I know about it.  I just so happened ta look up \n&gt; somethn&#39; in his file one day, when he asked me ta look over it for &#39;em and \n&gt; there it was.  Same molds used ta build Optimus.  Of course a lotta things \n&gt; were changed over the years, and Tucson came out different, color sceme \n&gt; and all, but he&#39;s definitely got Optimus Prime&#39;s attributes and physical \n&gt; strength.  Well, that came after he got the power of the Matrix..  But he \n&gt; sure had the back bone when he was just his normal self.  And Elita, you \n&gt; can count on him ta deliver, and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s gonna do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They all now gather around Elita to offer their reassurance.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PErceptor/Elita:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Amazing&quot; say dryly Perceptor while he senzed all that power&quot;None of all\n&gt;&gt; Predacons had held such power&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then his practical mind focused in wish Rodimus and tucson back and well,\n&gt;&gt; Kup prayed to PRimus for the comming back of their friends.

Straight \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Shot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was also showing tears in her eyes, as she holds Rat Trap&#39;s hand in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; support.  She could also see that Silverbolt was also pouring his heart\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out for Tucson and Rodimus to pull through, and with her free hand, she\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gently puts it into Silverbolts.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; If there&#39;s one thing Tucson Prime told us that I&#39;ll remember always, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the fact that we have something that no Predacon or Decepticon, or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Unicronian will ever possess.  A power so simple yet so powerful that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt;&gt; &gt; those with pure hearts possess it.  You&#39;re feeling it too, you have \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; power, we all do.  We just gotta tap into it, and let it be felt by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and Rodimus Prime.  If they can feel that we&#39;re pulling for them, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; they&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; &gt; find the strength to make it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap smiles back to them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;She&#39;s right Silverbolt, we can do this, we got what it takes, it&#39;s in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; our\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hearts, and no one can take that away from us, no one.  But if Wheels&#39;n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Speedy are gonna make it, we gotta show them that our hearts are pulln&#39;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for them all the way.  See?  Every time we put our hearts inta them, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; light pulsing in Wheels, it gets brighter&#39;n brighter. He knows  guys, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knows we&#39;re pulln&#39; for &#39;em.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Oh yeah, I&#39;m just noticing that now.  He knows we&#39;re pulln&#39; for &#39;em \n&gt;&gt; &gt; all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; right, he can feel our energy commn&#39; tagether.  We might not know that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we&#39;re radiatn&#39; somethn&#39; out at &#39;em, but he sure does.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With every hope poured into Tucson&#39;s success in recovering Rodimus, his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chest glows brighter and brighter with each pulsation.  It&#39;s as if he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; could actually channel the energy put out by his comrades in a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sense of being.  And on the table, even in slumber he lets them know \n&gt;&gt; &gt; just\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how he feels about their support.  He wispers.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I - will - not fail you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Silverbolt stood and watched as Nightshift, Elita and the others\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; poured out thier hearts out over Rodimus. He turned and looked at\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rodimus and Tuscon through the glass, his hands behind his back. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; felt rather than saw Torca and Bantor come to stand behind him, all of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them watching the struggle that was going on, on the others side.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; They watched as Santon, Bump and Legacy, perhaps the best technicians\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that they had available worked on Rodimus, thier movements swift and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; efficient. Silverbolt did not normally go in for the whole spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; side of things, but he could not help but to clench his fists and hope\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with ever fibre of his being that Rodimus would pull through.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
