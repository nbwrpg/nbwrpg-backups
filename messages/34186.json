The outside of the \nelement was slowly growing out. The nanobots were slowly eating apart the \nCybertronian Fire and building Maximal City around the Element. The room \nwhere they had come in through the underside was now totaly gone, and they \nwere quickly taking more from the ship. They would take the shield making \nthingies as soon as the shields ran out, and then repower them and use them \nin the Element.\n\n\nCledar saw Motormaster driving up. He carefully took aim and fired his \nfusion cannon right at Motormaster&#39;s front. The huge blast streamed out \ntoward the big vehicle, and Cledar looked to see if it had hit.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
