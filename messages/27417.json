Or what he remembered he looked like. After all, Von was a teen the last time he had seen him, obviously he would have change by now. The pictures upon the view screen were of transformers with beast modes, which Von had had none of back at their home. So, as beast modes changed faces and bodies�did they change metal characteristics as well?\r\nVlad sighed gruffly and looked at the rimes of the visual screen, seeing his dimmed reflection and noticing something for the first time. The way he looked with his beast mode. He looked�older then he was, yet still had the charming look which he was known for.\r\nBut then he saw it�something familiar that he knew for a fact reminded him of only ONE face in all those of Megatron�s group. That heavy brow, the same one he had now. Brown metal�same as his. And there was only one bot in Megatron�s group which appeared to own brown armor very similar to his.\r\nVlad�s optics snapped to the screen and located that one which looked very similar to himself, bringing up a file on that transformer and reading as quickly as he could and almost found himself lost from concentration as Fenox re-entered the area and spoke. He shushed and held up a finger towards her to be quiet, continuing to read and scroll down.\r\nThis was it, it had to be! The characteristics matched perfectly.** � Von I�ve found you!� **He spoke a little louder then he intended but this was spectacular. He had found Von, actually located him. After months of searching for his older brother he had finally located him. In yet, Vlad�s excitement has suddenly brought to a silent stand still when one single red word flashed upon the screen right below the last words of the profile.\r\nDECEASED.\r\nVon�was dead?\r\nThat was what deceased meant, dead.\r\nVlad knew for a fact that he had come here to destroy Von if he was alive�but when it really came down to it. Vlad was not only disappointed but stunned to find that his brother was already dead.  Yes, he had planned to kill him but he had somehow grown attached to what he remembered of his half-brother, and now that he had passed on it felt�felt like he had actually lost what he remembered what his brother, or what he knew of him was gone.\r\nVlad shook his head and glared at the screen, shutting it off and looking down at Shesta as she rubbed against his leg.   Was he really sad? He couldn�t be sad because of this, he didn�t really even know Von to begin with. But now HE was the only one left of their family. Vlad was alone now, to claim his mother�s land and also to live as he wished.\r\nSighing, Vlad leaned back and rubbed his neck, patting the soft head of his friend and glancing at Fenox.** � I�ve found what I needed, thanks.�  ** In his voice he was obviously shocked, sure that he would be glad that Von was dead if he found that out. But�he didn�t expect to feel THIS way about it.\r\nVlad was confused, and out of his own characteristics. He was never sad or showed personal concern, but Von and himself were the last of their family and the news that HE was now the last was very shocking indeed.**\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
