She saw \nlocked doors and a few open passageways.\n\nShe looked around and came to a small mass hall.  She walked up to \nthe food dispencer.  She pressed a few buttons and out came a small \nbowl of fruits and berries.  She looked at the food.  She wasn&#39;t \nreally hungry, but she knew she had to keep her strength up.  She \ntook the bowl and walked down the hallway back towards her room.\nShe wasn&#39;t really happy with her assignment.  Sure it was easy \nenough. But she still had yet to talk to the leader.  And she was \nmissing the company of Cybershark.\n\nShe opened the door to her room, stepped inside and closed the door \nbehind her.\n\n\n"}}
