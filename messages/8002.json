It was still a bit hard to believe that she was hearing his voice there and then, still not sure if she had been hallucinating or not.\nShe then suddenly saw an object fly towards here, Prowl�s voice telling her to catch it.\nWith ease she caught it, looking it over and not recognizing the design. But it WAS a cloaking device none the less, nothing more or less.\nWith no second thought she quickly placed the cloaking device onto her hip and activated, her vision slightly becoming wavy for a few moments before it adjusted.\nBlinking a few times she then focused on the area in front of her, nearly fainting in relief as her optics fell upon Prowl.\nHe HAD come to get her, to take her away from this awful nightmare and to safety! Her knight in shining armor had come!\nWith a sigh of total relief she flung her arms around his neck and basically clung to him, so happy that he was there that she didn�t realize just how hard she was hugging him. Though not to the point of choking, it was fairly close.\nShe had almost lost hope that Prowl wasn�t going to come, ready to accept her fate just as Nemesis was about to place the bug on her throat.\nIron Raptor breathed another sigh as she simply continued to cling to Prowl, a smile on her face. *\n\n� I�m alright�now.�\n\n* Her voice was quiet but was in a tone that let him know that she was happier then ever to see him finally come. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
