She looked up at Prowl for the first time \nand nodded to him. She had an uneasy expression on her face.  She \nshowed distrust in the male and uncertainty to Iron Raptor.  She \nlowered her head back down.\n\nShe said in a very quiet voice,&quot;I&#39;m alright, thank you.&quot; She wiped \nher face again with her hand.  She then looked up at the two bots.\nIn almost a whisper,&quot;What happens now?&quot;  \n\nShe still had her arms wrapped agound her, her tail was still just \nhanging there, not moving like normal.  She showed all signes of \ntension, uneasiness, uncertainty and some distrust.  She had been \nwith the Maximals that long them to trust her. Or her to trust them \nyet.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl raises an eyebrow at Iron Raptor&#39;s comment, a bit hurt of her \nopinion \n&gt; of him, even if he knew it was a joke.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I might be ugly,&quot; he says to Feline.
