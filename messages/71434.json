You were not aware of my change of status to Prime office =\r\nand perhaps mistook me for my previous status.

So there&#39;s no way he co=\r\nudl have been there, and he wouldn&#39;t have gone back over to them! So will p=\r\nose this as taking place out in the ship corridors. Thanks!\n\n      Also, I =\r\nappreciate your posting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how you have each and every=\r\n character of your&#39;s coming up, then doing something to me, then knowing ea=\r\nch and every thing that happened to each adn every other one that did, and =\r\nthem all having the exact same opinions over on everyone as everyone else d=\r\nid. \n\n      Also, unless your characte ris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to=\r\n emphatically order him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewh=\r\nere far else after you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for hi=\r\nm to go back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when =\r\nhe&#39;s not especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well =\r\nwhen I posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him, ple=\r\nase give me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two times you pos=\r\ned him extensively going with your characters when it was not in character =\r\nfor him to do so.\n\n      If your characters have had interactions with him =\r\nin the past or things I should know of, let me know? As I have no idea wher=\r\ne Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they would have remotely konwn of o=\r\nne another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the pas=\r\nt, when I have no idea of that.\n\n      So again, if they&#39;ve had interaction=\r\ns as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic history so I can respond appropriatel=\r\ny. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a =\r\nchance to respond appropriately if he does or not, or make it something lik=\r\ne a specific order in the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rather =\r\nweird how your characers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opin=\r\ninos and back one another up to the hilt on thier interactions and everythi=\r\nng. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by this.\n\n      I understand I&#39;m ne=\r\nw to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather hemmed =\r\nin on the character with what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how things=\r\n operate, and how you have all of your alts congregating and making me feel=\r\n pressed into a corner.\n\n      Anyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bit t=\r\noo negative, thank you very much for the welcome here and for playing wtih =\r\nme and interacting with Wheelie.\n\n      &lt;Back In Character&gt;\n\n      Wheelie,=\r\n having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at him, &quot;What is this with al=\r\nl of you? You&#39;re back and forth whatever I do. This is what Prime is, just =\r\na rank? It seems like it&#39;s just sort of dank. We had four of five in a room=\r\n, that&#39;s not a level of doom and gloom.&quot;\n\n      Then, walking away from Tus=\r\ncon, but looking behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with all of your friends, co=\r\nngrualtions on the promotion and to whatever ends. But we, we were never fr=\r\niends. We went back and forth in our ways, and I respect your orders for th=\r\nese days. But we&#39;re not here to have fun, we&#39;re here to fight and run and g=\r\nun.&quot;\n\n      Wheelie leaning against the wall, &quot;I&#39;ll work wtih you, if you d=\r\no tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is hell. I&#39;d prefer to keep my own advic=\r\ne, and I appreciate your friends, they try and be nice. But don&#39;t have them=\r\n ganging up on me and telling me what to do, or how you&#39;ll react, or on you=\r\n&#39;ll I chew. So by al lmeans, give me some space, we&#39;re here to fight for th=\r\ne future of our race.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0013_01CC3DE4.4413FC20\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none;

You were =\r\n\n      not aware of my change of status to Prime office and perhaps mistook=\r\n me \n      for my previous status. I&#39;ll let it go this one time, Wheelie bu=\r\nt keep in \n      mind that a Prime is a Prime no matter who they are. All r=\r\night, you&#39;re \n      free to roam the Auto base now. Please try not to get s=\r\nent to my office \n      again, okay?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With a smile of unde=\r\nrstanding, Tucson opens \n      the door to let Wheelie go on his way. Once =\r\nhaving let Wheelie free, he \n      waits for Talon with a light hearted smi=\r\nle on his face.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n      &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OOC - Uhm, I posted Wheelie leaving =\r\nyour quarters and he never \n      entered them in the first place, then him=\r\n heading out. So there&#39;s no way \n      he coudl have been there, and he wou=\r\nldn&#39;t have gone back over to them! So \n      will pose this as taking place=\r\n out in the ship corridors. \n      Thanks!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, I appreciate your p=\r\nosting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how \n      you have each and every character=\r\n of your&#39;s coming up, then doing \n      something to me, then knowing each =\r\nand every thing that happened to each \n      adn every other one that did, =\r\nand them all having the exact same opinions \n      over on everyone as ever=\r\nyone else did. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, unless your characte \n      ris asuperior offi=\r\ncer who&#39;s going to emphatically order him to do \n      something, please do=\r\nn&#39;t pose him going somewhere far else after you for a \n      setup. Since i=\r\nt&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to go back to Tuscon&#39;s \n      quarters tw=\r\nice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s not especially fond \n      of T=\r\nuscon, nor him following someone else as well when I posd him trying \n     =\r\n to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him, please give me a cahnce \n=\r\n      to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two times you posed him extensiv=\r\nely \n      going with your characters when it was not in character for him =\r\nto do \n      so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If your characters have had interactions with him i=\r\nn the past \n      or things I should know of, let me know? As I have no ide=\r\na where Wheelie \n      interacted with Tuscon or how they would have remote=\r\nly konwn of one \n      another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon kn=\r\nows him from the past, \n      when I have no idea of that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So again,=\r\n if they&#39;ve had interactions \n      as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic his=\r\ntory so I can respond \n      appropriately. If he&#39;s going to be told to go =\r\nsomewhere wtih someone, \n      either give me a chance to respond appropria=\r\ntely if he does or not, or \n      make it something like a specific order i=\r\nn the case someone is a superior. \n      And it&#39;s also rather weird how you=\r\nr characers come up from nowhere, all \n      have the exact same opininos a=\r\nnd back one another up to the hilt on thier \n      interactions and everyth=\r\ning. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by \n      this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I understan=\r\nd I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much \n      longer, I just feel=\r\n rather hemmed in on the character with what you&#39;re \n      doing and am con=\r\nfused as to how things operate, and how you have all of \n      your alts co=\r\nngregating and making me feel pressed into a \n      corner.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyways,=\r\n sorry if this is coming fof a bit too negative, \n      thank you very much=\r\n for the welcome here and for playing wtih me and \n      interacting with W=\r\nheelie.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;Back In Character&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wheelie, \n      having met =\r\nTuscon up in the hall, gazes over at him, &quot;What is this with \n      all of =\r\nyou?
