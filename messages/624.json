BrightBlade looked at Gangon and motioned with her head, they were\n&gt; to leave. Now!\n&gt; She turned towards the Predacons and bowed with extreme sarcasm...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Farewell, Traitors. I must now leave, orders. Hell Beast has called. And\nI\n&gt; would rather face the wrath of your weapons then the wrath of Hell Beast\nif\n&gt; I disobey him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * BrightBlade turned and transformed into her B mode, she flipped her tail\n&gt; up at the traitors and then began to scamper off towards the Maximal base.\n&gt; She looked back at Gangon to follow and soon disappeared into the brush.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3020/7/_/_/_/956887226/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
