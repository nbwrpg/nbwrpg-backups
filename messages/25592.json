I was told that the Alliance had started fighting on Angel \nPrime and \n&gt; stuff like that.\n&gt; Forget my last post with IR in it. I misunderstood a few posts. I \nguess \n&gt; that&#39;s what happens when you start posting when you&#39;re board out of \nyour \n&gt; tree.\n&gt; Plus I didn&#39;t know that FZ was having other nagotiation with other \nbots.\n&gt; This is a better post so just emit the last one.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor glared out towards the battlefield, her sword in hand \na ready \n&gt; for trouble.\n&gt; She knew for a fact that FZ wouldn&#39;t let any of the Alliance \nrelease \n&gt; Chordate and that this was a slight waste of time. All they were \ndoing now \n&gt; was running their collective mouths and trying to make themselves \nsound more \n&gt; intimidating then the other.\n&gt; But she knew that the Alliance had the upper hand and the CF was \ngetting \n&gt; closer and closer to simply falling apart just like the Ark had \nbefore it \n&gt; was repaired and sent into space. That was the last she had heard \nof it.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and leaned her weight on one leg, keeping her \neyes on the \n&gt; battle and watching over everything that was done.\n&gt; There was nothing she could do for Angel Prime, he had dug his own \nhole and \n&gt; he was adult enough to get himself out of it. She had given him the \nchance \n&gt; and he had ignored it. Even though she hated to admit it, she \nwasn&#39;t going \n&gt; to help him.\n&gt; Besides, it wasn&#39;t fair to the other Maximals to just order them to \ngo out \n&gt; there and risk getting their brains blown out just to save a bot \nwho \n&gt; couldn&#39;t save himself. But this wasn&#39;t only her call.\n&gt; Some of the Maximals behind her might be itching to fight while \nothers were \n&gt; praying that the Alliance would just leave.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked towards Prowl for a moment before glancing over \nher \n&gt; shoulder towards the remainder of the Maximals.\n&gt; There was nagotiations going on right now so attack was not an \noption, but \n&gt; simply standing here and doing nothing could get to a lot of \nMaximals that \n&gt; had been in a battle rage only moments before. But they would have \nto hold \n&gt; up. Just like her. &lt; We wait.&gt; she thought to Prowl. &lt; See just \nwhat they&#39;re \n&gt; up to, then maybe make our way to the CF to either get the captives \nor try \n&gt; and repair some of the weapons so we stand more of a chance.&gt;* Iron \nRaptor \n&gt; centered her stance.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We wait.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
