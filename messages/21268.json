He looks back at her face \nas she suddenly sits up, her hair flowing=\r\n around her. She was \nbeautiful, that was all Prowl could think.\n\nHe could =\r\nfeel her looking through his memory of the Matrix, realizing \nwhat the voic=\r\ne had meant. Feeling her thoughts and her feeling his, \nit wasn&#39;t bad at al=\r\nl. He nods as she looks at him and speaks his \nname, leaning in closer to h=\r\ner.\n\n&quot;Its me, love,&quot; he says, kneeling on the ground and running a hand \nth=\r\nrough her hair. He knew it was childish to be facinated by \nsomething like =\r\nthis, but he was indeed facinated by her.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;M=\r\negan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * A tiny ladybug crawled along=\r\n the length of her arm, its bright \nred and \n&gt; black shell shining in the s=\r\nun as it continued to walk.\n&gt; But soon the feeling of the small insects&#39; ti=\r\nny feet against her \narm woke \n&gt; Iron Raptor, opening one of her eyes very =\r\nslowly to see the little \nbug stop \n&gt; and look back at her. But she failed =\r\nto notice that what it was \nwalking on \n&gt; was the bare blue skin of her own=\r\n arm. All she saw was the little \nred bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; A ladybug &gt; was her thoug=\r\nhts, seeing how cute it was, her mouth \nturning in \n&gt; the corners to for a =\r\nsmile. But even though she could see the small \nbug, she \n&gt; wasn&#39;t complete=\r\nly awake yet, and also failed to see a whisp of \nshort white \n&gt; hair flow a=\r\ncross the bridge of her nose, a piece, which made up her \nbangs.\n&gt; Iron Rap=\r\ntor just continued to watch the little insect with her \ncrystal blue \n&gt; eye=\r\ns, not moving a muscle. But then, as she watched the ladybug, \nshe \n&gt; remem=\r\nbered just what had happened, opening both of her eyes as she \nwent \n&gt; thro=\r\nugh the events in her mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both her beast modes had merged and began =\r\nthe conflict, leaving her \nstuck in \n&gt; a black nightmarish mode which had b=\r\neen neither but both.\n&gt; Then her thoughts skipped to the merge, and remembe=\r\nred closing her \neyes=85but \n&gt; not opening them again until now.\n&gt; What had=\r\n happened during the time that she had been out?\n&gt; Just as sudden as mer mi=\r\nnd asked the question a flood of images and \nevents \n&gt; flushed into her min=\r\nd, making her sit up in a jerk and press her \nfingers to \n&gt; her temple whil=\r\ne supporting herself with her other arm. Her white \nhair \n&gt; moving in a flu=\r\nrry before settling around her shoulders once again, \ncovering \n&gt; her back,=\r\n chest and thighs.\n&gt; Iron Raptor closed her eyes as she tried to focus on t=\r\nhe images.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were millions of sparks, all around and everywhere. B=\r\nut \nBeyond the \n&gt; sparks=85beyond them was just darkness.\n&gt; But then, then =\r\nthere was a voice, gentle one that seemed almost to \nsound \n&gt; powerful at t=\r\nhe same time. Though, while also sounding as if it was \nmost \n&gt; knowledge a=\r\nble but also wanted to know more. Yet, still as if \nspeaking from \n&gt; a high=\r\ner plain. It spoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Welcome, Prowl.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl? It was then that sh=\r\ne could hear his voice, asking question \nafter \n&gt; question until finally it=\r\n all stopped and focused upon one feeling, \none, \n&gt; which made Iron Raptors=\r\n spark sink along with the feeling.\n&gt; Also hearing the words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl: &quot;=\r\n And Iron Raptor?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She hears Prowl ask, feeling almost as if her spark=\r\n sank as his did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice: &quot; She didn&#39;t end up here, &quot; they ( both her a=\r\nlong with \nProwl) heard \n&gt; the voice reply, &quot; But she died in your arms, Pr=\r\nowl.&quot; It finished.\n&gt; But only one whole word in that sentence lingered in h=\r\ner mind, ` \ndied&#39;? So, \n&gt; she had died? Or could it just be some sort of dr=\r\neam she couldn&#39;t \nremember \n&gt; having? No, this was all too real to be that.=\r\n\n&gt; Then what?\n&gt; But then it all went on; Prowls sadness, then both him and =\r\nthe \nMatrix? Was \n&gt; that it?\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt; Then, both him and it, no=85that, con=\r\ntinued to talk back and forth \nuntil some \n&gt; sort of deal was arranged, one=\r\n made so that she could live.\n&gt; But then, just after that, the image of the=\r\n blue sky came into her \nmind, \n&gt; after being thrown into a body again. Pro=\r\nwls body.\n&gt; Were these=85Prowls memories?\n&gt; Other images flashed in her min=\r\nd, ones of Prowls old friends and \nfamily, of \n&gt; when he had served under S=\r\ntriker. But then it all went black and \nthere was \n&gt; nothing, but then a fe=\r\neling, one she knew well.\n&gt; Love.\n&gt; Though, this feeling of love was accomp=\r\nanied by others as well; \nwonder, \n&gt; admiration.\n&gt; And then an image of=85h=\r\nerself?\n&gt; She could see herself, sitting, eyes closed. But it didn&#39;t look \n=\r\nlike herself \n&gt; at all, not like she remembered.\n&gt; What she was seeing remi=\r\nnded her of the forms of human women she \nhad seen in \n&gt; history files befo=\r\nre=85only this one was larger, and she had long \nwhite hair \n&gt; and blue ski=\r\nn, the same color as her own. But this woman wasn&#39;t \nwearing any \n&gt; cloths,=\r\n though all of the privet areas were hidden by the white \nhair, which \n&gt; fe=\r\nll from her head.\n&gt; She was pressing her fingers to her head, and just as I=\r\nron Raptor \nopened her \n&gt; eyes, so did the woman in her mind. But then some=\r\nthing occurred to \nher, was \n&gt; this herself that she was looking at? And if=\r\n so, then whose eyes \nwas she \n&gt; looking through at the moment?\n&gt; The image=\r\n of the woman disappeared as Iron Raptor brought her mind \nback into \n&gt; foc=\r\nus, lowering her fingers from her temple and then looking at \nthem in \n&gt; wo=\r\nnder. However, then she noticed white hair falling over her \nshoulder, \n&gt; m=\r\naking it so that she couldn&#39;t see the source of this love that she \nwas \n&gt; =\r\nfeeling.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then brushed the hair aside, looking up and then \nfi=\r\nnding herself \n&gt; gazing towards a=85fuzor? No, in her spark and mind she kn=\r\new who it \nwas.\n&gt; He just looked so=85so=85different.\n&gt; Iron Raptor turned =\r\nher crystal blue eyes towards the mans optics, \nher voice \n&gt; soft and smoot=\r\nh.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Prowl?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n_______________________________________________=\r\n_______________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmai=\r\nl at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create=\r\n your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
