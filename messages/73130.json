Heh.\n\nOOC: Ignore? Nahhhh!!! :)\n\n&gt; &lt;OOC&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As BLACKARACHNIA fought over against her adversary, her normal ability to\n&gt; use her hyperagility to defeat bulkier adversaries was fairly useless\n&gt; against an opponent who was equally skilled as she was!\n&gt;\n&gt; As KILLER PUNCH went ou twtih blows towards her, BLACKARACHNIA went to\n&gt; leap up in the air..  Intent on literally landing ON his shield, balanced on the\n&gt; edge of it with her hyper-agility to then try and blast his upper torso over\n&gt; with her energon draining webbing!\n\n&quot;Blasted bug!&quot; KILLER PUNCH said as he saw BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s leap onto\nhis shield, a move which caught him almost completely by surprise!\nWith a quick shake of his shield he attempted to dislodge her, a look\nof revultion moving across his faceplate as he did so.\n\nHe tried to spin as he saw her firing her webbing. However the very\narmor that protected him from blows also made it difficult to move as\nfast as he needed to and a few pieces of her webbing caught hold of\nhim for a moment and stuck!\n\nWith a quick move he cut it away, but some damage had already been\ndone as some of his energies had been drained away!\n\nKILLER PUNCH looked over at BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;Is that all you have?&quot; He\nsaid, his chuckle sounded a bit tired as he spoke. &quot;Come on, I can do\nthis all day!&quot;\n\nWith a clumsy swing KILLER PUNCH slashed out at BLACKARACHNIA with his weapon!\n\nCould KILLER PUNCH really be as tired as he looked, especially with\nBLACKARACHNIA having scored on him with her energy draining webbing\nfor a moment, or was this a feint to cause her to lower her guard?\n\nKILLER PUNCH was well known to be trickey.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
