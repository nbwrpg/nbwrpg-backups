She looked at Quickstrike and then at Megatron.\n\n&quot;Yes Megatron.  I agree with Quickstrike.  I can take Scorponoc and we can \ndo the recon.  Let Quickstrike go do what he has to do.&quot;\n\nShe could barely stand being next to him.  She wanted to get as far away \nfrom Quickstrike as possable just as soon as possable.  If Megatron ordered \nthem to work together, it would be a living hell for her.  She just wanted \nto get away from him, now if she could. More over, she wanted to find a hole \nand crawl into it.  What a fool she felt like. What made her do that? She \nfelt like she&#39;d throw up if she had to stand next to Quickstike one more \nsecond.\n\nShe walked over to Scorponoc. She said to him, &quot;So you want to go and do \nsome scouting around?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
