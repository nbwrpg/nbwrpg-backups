His scanners reported another bot near. He shuggs, looking \nback at Zardus.\n\n&quot;I came here for some help,&quot; he says, &quot;As you know, our base is one of the \nstrongest on the planet.&quot;\n\nZardus nods, &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent,&quot; the Millitron continues, &quot;Anyways, our faction is rather small, \nand I was wondering if the Alliance would like to join us, or rather ... \nassimilate us into their ranks.&quot;\n\nZardus&#39; eyes widen. He couldn&#39;t believe the bot was offering this! The Iron \nFist? On the side of the Alliance.\n\n&quot;And what would you want in return?&quot; Zardus asks, interested.\n\n&quot;Protection,&quot; Panzertron replies, &quot;SImply that. I&#39;ll give you the acces codes \nand everything. You&#39;ll be able to controll the ship.&quot;\n\nZardus chuckles. &quot;Excellent. Let&#39;s go to your ship, then.&quot;\n\nPanzertron nods, transforming into his tank mode and driving back toward the \nshuttle in which he came.\n\nZardus activates his comm-link, &quot;Gotron, Desmodus, return to base. I will be \nthere shortly. We might be moving soon.&quot;\n\nWith that, Zardus transforms into beast mode, flying off after Panzertron.\n\n"}}
