She leaked a little mech fluid \nfrom her shoulder.  She slowly got up on her knees and then stood up. \nShe looked at him and let out a low growl. &quot;I thought I said hit. \nLike as in punch, upper cut, and so on like that.&quot; She looked at the \ndamage done to her body. She sighed, &quot;But this wil work as well.&quot;  \nShe limped over to Skulletron.  She leaned over and kissed his cheek.\n&quot;Thanks handsome.&quot; She turned and took a few steps towards the ship.  \nShe turned and looked at him,&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it all be purrrrrfect.&quot; \nShe smiled at him and walked off.  She waved her tail at him in \na &#39;Bye&#39; motion as she limped her way to the ship.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Vorhees&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Skulletron::\n&gt; \n&gt;         Skulletron looks at Feline, puzzled, as she asks him to \nfire  on her a couple times.  That would be hard.  She was too \nbeautiful for him to do that.  But then, his mind went towards the \n mission and he Alliance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&quot;Alright then.  Anything to get this mission done!&quot; \nSkulletron sighed as he grabbed his ray gun.\n&gt; \nHe aimed it at her, finger on the trigger.  He clenched the \ngun tight, hands shaking.  Then he fired three blasts from his ray \ngun very quickly, shutting his eyes.\n\n\n"}}
