She looks \nat Vlad appolegetically.\n\n&quot;Exuse me for a moment, I gotta see what he wants.&quot;\n\nFenox taps a few extra keys, setting up a monitoring system to watch \nVlad. No acknowledgement came up on the screen for the command. Fenox \nturns and walks off toward the nearest room, walking in and waiting \nfor D to enter as well. All the rooms were soundproof, so they could \ntalk safely in there.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * D had growled at Vlad all along as he tried to get near to Fenox, \nand was \n&gt; astonished when she began to act towards him with equal enthusiasm.\n&gt; What was this?!\n&gt; First he&#39;s new here and now this male was trying to take Fenox with \nhis \n&gt; charme that D could tell was all fake.\n&gt; D snapps at Vlads back as he and Fenox walk past him, feeling \nslightly hurt \n&gt; that she had forgotten all about him. But he follows them into the \nship \n&gt; anyway, not trusting Vlad alone with this woman who was so kind to \nhim.\n&gt; D peeked over Fenox&#39;s shoulder as she activated some computer \nscreen, and he \n&gt; had seen many in his life so he knew what they were. Just not how \nto use one \n&gt; very well. That&#39;s what the people were trying to teach him before \nthey \n&gt; crashed, and he had been doing pretty well.\n&gt; There were images of other metal being showing up on the screen as \nD looked, \n&gt; growling at Vlad again and baring his teeth.\n&gt; D sat back a bit, looking like a huge wolf statue as his tail \nwrapped around \n&gt; his feet and he hunkered up his shoulders. The fur on the back of \nhis neck \n&gt; rising and his eyes glaring at Vlad whenever he decided to look at \nhim.\n&gt; How could Fenox trust this guy?! Everything about him was wrong!\n&gt; But D just sat there for a few more moments before getting up and \nmoving his \n&gt; mouth so that he tried to get Fenox&#39;s hand in his mouth to lead her \naway \n&gt; from him.\n&gt; Vlad was bad news, and he wanted her to be no part of it.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
