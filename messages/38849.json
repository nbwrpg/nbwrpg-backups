In its blissful calm birds chirped,\nas larger animals moved away from the crater ruins that lead for a few\nmiles, to a large alien craft. The Autobot&#39;s Hidden one, littered the\nprimitive natural apearance of the dirt. Beside it, a small clanking\ncould be heard. In another much smaller alien craft sitting only a few\nfeet away, a small robot figuere banged his fists against the winshield\nof the bi-jet. Caliburst, a nebulan organic creature bio engenired to\nbecome a weapon of mass destruction for a mechanic warrior race, tried\nto escape his binary partners unintentional tomb.\n\n&quot;W, WAKE UP SLUGSLINGER.&quot; he pleaded worriedly. Ussually he didnt show\nfear, as a famous actor he knew how to never show his real emotions, but\nlanding badly dammaged next to a huge ship carrying your mortal enemies\nwas a good reason to worry.\n\nFinally the Bi-jet cockpit glass gave way to the metal knuckles, as it\nshattered. Caliburst climbed from a blanket of glass, and looked around.\nThis bizzare planet reminded him of Nebula. The silence was ominous\nhowever, as he was sure that the Autobot ship was looking at him.\nNervously he turned around, and began to whisper. &quot;Get up Slugslinger,\nwe&#39;ve got to get outta here before the Autobots get it together. We&#39;ve\ngotta find Havotron, he will protect us,&quot; he thought, remembering back\nto Slugslinger threatening their leader.\n______________________________________________________________________\nInside the large golden craft, in the pilot area, a form began to move\nout of the rest of the fallen. &quot;Ohhhhhh man, that was a kick in the\nafterburner.&quot; the gruff voice commented, as a white Autobot pulled\nhimself up. Strafe, part of a group of five Autobot warriors who were\nbuilt by Grimlock to be the most versatile Gestalt ever, shook off the\ncobwebs, as his head shifted at what would be painful angles for a human\nbeing. As it went 180 degrees, and joint cracked, and a lose bolt popped\nout. He looked around, and shook a nearby Scattershot, but lost\ninterest, as he looked out one of the windows at smoking wreckage.\n&quot;hmmmmmmmm.&quot; he thought outloud.\n\n"}}
