Im=\r\nmense chains extending from both the ceiling and the floor held the helples=\r\ns figure with its arms and legs spread and pulled almost to the breaking po=\r\nint. From the pit dark energies seemed to boil as purple flames frothed and=\r\n flickered from the dark depths below - a strange smoke rose up seeming to =\r\nalmost caress the figure that was being held above it. \n\n&quot;Is he ready yet?&quot;=\r\n It was MAGMATRON, his voice imperious and powerful as he spoke, for the mo=\r\nment only his optics could be seen glowing malevolently in the deep gloom. =\r\n\n\nThere was a pause and SABERBACK spoke, &quot;Soon, very soon.&quot; He was floating=\r\n next to MAGMATRON, using some sort of antigravity technologies. &quot;We knew t=\r\nhat even once we collected what we needed it would still take time.&quot;\n\nThe f=\r\nigure dangling over the pit looked over at MAGMATRON and SABERBACK, its own=\r\n optics glowing dimly in the darkness. &quot;You will not succeed!&quot; There was a =\r\npause, &quot;You will be stopped.&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON chuckled as he looked back at the =\r\nfigure, &quot;Oh? And who will stop me, you?&quot;\n\n&quot;The Autobots . . .&quot; the figure p=\r\naused and started again, &quot;The Maximals will . . .&quot; \n\n&quot;The Autobots are a dy=\r\ning husk and the Maximals are nothing!&quot; MAGMATRON cut in. &quot;The sooner you u=\r\nnderstand that the better off you will be!&quot;\n\nThe figure fell silent, his en=\r\nergy reserves seemingly spent with his words. \n\nSABERBACK produced a small =\r\ndevice and directed it at the helpless figure, &quot;Yes, it is time for the nex=\r\nt dose.&quot;\n\nThere was a single nod from MAGMATRON, in the gloom the movement =\r\nnoticeable by the glow of his optics. &quot;Proceed.&quot;\n\nWith a seemingly simple w=\r\nave of SABERBACK&#39;s hand the fire and energy from the pit began to roll and =\r\nbrighten, tendrils of energy sparked and cascaded, until what seemed like b=\r\nlack and purple lightning bolts erupted from the pit!\n\nThe figure spasmed i=\r\nn pain as he arched his back and his head fell back in a silent scream as e=\r\nven the ability to make noise was ripped away from it!\n\nIt was only now in =\r\nthe dim flickering light of the arcing energy that the figures of MAGMATRON=\r\n and SABERBACK could truly be discerned, and that of their prisoner. \n\nOPTI=\r\nMUS PRIME\n\n(TBC)\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\n"}}
