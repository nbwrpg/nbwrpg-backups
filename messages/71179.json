He looks over to Perceptor with an encouraging grin.\n\n&quot;Heey, no worrie=\r\ns Perceptor, if we go eco, we&#39;ll be able to be at full power without actual=\r\nly draining any energy from this planet, therefore, it preserves our enviro=\r\nnment, and our base.&quot;  \n\nHe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Thank you sir.  Now that we=\r\n have your okay, I&#39;ll start drawing up some sketches and see which one actu=\r\nally fits the landscape.  We want it to be a little bit hidden from view, y=\r\na know what&#39;ll happen if it&#39;s visible, right?  Anyway, I&#39;ll get right on it=\r\n as soon as repairs are all done.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Rodimus and foll=\r\nows him.  Yet it was the first time she ever spent considerable time away f=\r\nrom Tucson which to her was a new experience.  For years they had stuck ver=\r\ny much together, being brother and sister, but also very close as target ma=\r\nsters.  Yet, Rodimus still made a very good impression on her as she gladly=\r\n trots up beside him.  Being as small as she was, it was rather difficult t=\r\no keep up with his stride.\n\n&quot; Sorry, I promise ta keep up with ya, it&#39;s jus=\r\nt hard &#39;cause of my size.&quot;\n\nQuickstride chuckles a bit.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll f=\r\norgive ya Straight Shot.  After all, this is something you&#39;re not used to.&quot;=\r\n\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m usually travelling on Tucson&#39;s b=\r\nack.  This is a first for me.&quot;\n\nEven though a little apprehensive due to he=\r\nr feeling of vulnerability, she keeps a content smile on her faceplate.  St=\r\nraight Shot was among friends, and she knew that sooner or later, she would=\r\n have to venture further than the holster on Tucson&#39;s back.  Quickstride wa=\r\nlks up to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Straight Shot&#39;s not used ta be&#39;n outside her holster =\r\nfor long periods of time.  She might seem a little shy at times, but it&#39;s n=\r\nothing personal Sir.  It appears that she&#39;s much more used to being holster=\r\ned behind Tucson&#39;s back than she is when she&#39;s in robot mode.  But I&#39;m sure=\r\n she&#39;ll open up in due time.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclo=\r\nnus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;LEt&#39;s go to work, Legac=\r\ny&quot;said dryly the male and looking at Rodimus said\n&gt; &quot;By the way, your child=\r\n is inside the med bay....
