Let&#39;s go to Zone 5!&quot; He said, ready\n&gt; to scrap any bot around.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Triggerhappy ran out and got Blowpipe,\n&gt; Blowpipe detransformed into Triggerhappy&#39;s\n&gt; compressed air cannon.  Triggerhappy looked up at\n&gt; Menasor.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Yes!  With their gestalt warrior, and\n&gt; Beastbox and Squalktalk soon-to-be merging into\n&gt; Squalkbox, we will be invincible!!!  Almost....&quot; He\n&gt; said.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Triggerhappy then noticed another one of\n&gt; his allies.  He ran over to Skullgrin.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey!!  Hmm, isn&#39;t there somebody who can\n&gt; transform into a Pretender??&quot; Triggerhappy said,\n&gt; trying to hint Skullgrin.  \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Skullgrin nodded.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Hahaha!  I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t think of\n&gt; that!&quot; He exclaimed.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Skullgrin transformed to robot mode, then, he\n&gt; began a transformation.  He transformed into\n&gt; Pretender mode, and had his double slagmaker laser\n&gt; ready to be used on something.  In Pretender mode,\n&gt; he was 12 feet tall and had brute strength, but his\n&gt; intelligence dropped greatly.  He fired 2 rounds\n&gt; from his deadly slagmaker(I like calling it the\n&gt; slagmaker ok?) at Hot Rod.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
