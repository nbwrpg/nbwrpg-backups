Wait for me!!!&quot;\n\n* She was so scared that her eyes were wet and tears nearly ran down her \nfluffy cheeks. She didn&#39;t want to be left behind with nothing behind her but \na monster that was all teeth!\nDiana ran as quickly as she could and with all four legs it didn&#39;t take her \nlong to catch up to Rion, nearly crying by the time she did so.\nShe kept her eyes on the trees ahead, seeing how slowly they got closer and \nsure that the beats was going to get them.\nShe wanted her mommy!*\n\n&quot; Get on!&quot;\n\n* She mannaged to get out, which was a surprise.\nBy running Rions speed she was keeping back from gouing faster then she \nwished she could go, but with him on her back she could run faster and try \nto get to the trees.\nShe just hoped that they could hide in there, but they were pretty far apart \nfrom eachother...plenty of room for passing monsters!*\n\n\n\n\n&gt;(Guess who&#39;s finally back?!

His feet slid out from under him, forcing him to all fours:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think so...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion turned in the direction Diana pushed his face, and froze. Whatever he \n&gt;had detected earlier seemed to have absolutely no problem with announcing \n&gt;its presence. Rion scrambled to his feet, automatically drawing his sword. \n&gt;His hands were shaking and nothing above the sound of his own pounding \n&gt;spark reached his ears. Rion swallowed, his stance unsteady and his eyes \n&gt;darting from side to side:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Um... RUN!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion nearly dropped his sword as he turned tail and fled toward the trees. \n&gt;He could barely summon the will to look back and make sure Diana was \n&gt;following.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
