I really don&#39;t want to lose him!&quot;\n\n*Snow Tech says, then, relizing that he had just addmited to his sister that \nhe liked the little fuzz-ball of cuteness, he stammered an exscuse,*\n\n&quot; Uh, i mean, after all. chicks dig guys with cute kids with them!&quot;\n\n* SHadow Cat just grinned and shot ahead and through the trees, almost \nrunning into Iron Raptor and the fuzz-ball. Suprised, Shadow Cat came to \nemergancy stop, putting on her brakes as hard as possible*\n\n&quot; Iron? What the.....? How&#39;d you get here? After me&#39;n Snowy left i thought \ni&#39;de never see you again! After all, it&#39;s been years.....&quot;\n\n* In her suprise and confusion, she did not warn Snow Tech that she had \nstopped, making the large cat-bot to promptely run into her, leaving them in \ntangled mess.*\n\n\n\n\n\nlove, Shadow Cat and Snow Tech\n\n                        A.J.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
