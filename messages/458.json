She knew he needed no compassion, much less from her, \nbut she had tried. His anger and hate for those who had wronged him was so \ngreat it frightened her.\n\nShe didn&#39;t understand why Dinobot had such anger toward his former comrades, \nbut it was not her place to ask. She watched the mech-fluid drip to the \nfloor, concern etched on her face. She frowned, such a pity. How could one \nso strong be so weak? Have such little control over his emotions? Tavatron \nsighed and walked over to Dinobot. She placed her hand on against his arm:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not tired. I&#39;m going to get some food, come find me if you want to \ntalk.&quot;\n\nTavatron walked out of the room and down the hall of the ark. She couldn&#39;t \nhelp being a little concerned. Showing compassion was something she had \nlearned to do a long time ago. Before than an anger and hate had consumed \nher world. She had sworn she would never again lose control of herself. The \ncost was too great.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
