I was in his cab with him as an on board scout, looking out=\r\n for possible ambush.  I saw someone in the skies far off behind us and I f=\r\nroze because he moved in really fast.  By the time Cyclonus moved in for th=\r\ne shot, I could barely say anything.  I was terrified.  Then that&#39;s when it=\r\n happened.

It was mine.  I should have never asked you toventure =\r\nout with me on such a dangerous mission.&quot;\n\nHe then looks to everyone.\n\n&quot; Ti=\r\nmes are about to get difficult.  In order to win the battle ahead we have t=\r\no work together, and we need to remain strong.  We will overcome as we have=\r\n for centuries.  Freedom is the right for all sentient beings.
