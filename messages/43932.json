By the way I would do this in polls but no one&#39;s \nanswering \n&gt; mine anymore and I want comments about your opinions. Would you be \n&gt; willing to have a char in a faction made entirely of proto-humans \n&gt; trying to banish the &quot;demons&quot; from their planets, and should they be \n&gt; allowed to use magic and energon spear and hammerheads to even the \n&gt; odds. If I get 3 supporting replies and no negative ones I&#39;ll do it \n&gt; (forget it Nemisis you don&#39;t count).\n&gt; \n&gt; A shuttle is crashing to earth.  It lands in North America. It scans \na \n&gt; small, black and white rabbit. A bot of 80 stellar cycles steps out \n&gt; (he was 8).\n&gt; \n&gt; Old Bot: I look almost as cute as I did when I was 20.
