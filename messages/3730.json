Getting a target lock, he fired four \nmissiles off at BH and Blastrage&#39;s skimmer.  \n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko &quot;grinded his teeth&quot; as he saw Shockwave open fire on one of the \nmost powerful weapons under his command for now.  Taking precise aim and \ncalculating, he fired three laser bolts, each digging into Shockwave&#39;s left \nwing, sending the Decepticon descending quickly, smashing into a forest, lost \nin the immense green.\n&quot;No one, messes, with Koga Shuko.&quot; he smiled, turning back to Cyber Claw, \nraising his missile launcher.  &quot;We&#39;ve told you what we know, our forces are \nnewly arrived, we don&#39;t know much about your petty feuds.  So be gone and \nleave us alone!  Or you WILL die, as will all who oppose us.&quot;\n\n"}}
