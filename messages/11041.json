She had Land Mine, Time Bomb, \nDrillbit, Phobia.  She wondered if she could talk to Terrorsaur about \njoining her.  She was getting fed up with Megatron.  She had lost her \nleg in the last battle because of his foolhearty plans.  Come to \nthink of it, he went into battle without a real plan or stratagy.\n\nShe was beginning to think that maybe she could run the Pred pack.\nShe had a broad grin on her face.  But now wasn&#39;t the time to act.  \nShe waould have o make sure that the group would follow her and not \ngo back to Megatron at the first sign of trouble.  She wondered if it \nwas even possable.\n\nShe turned to Phobia, &quot;You know, I was wondering, what would happen \nif we went and took the ship for Megatron without him knowing it. And \nthen hand it over to him as a surprize? I wonder if he would like \nthat?  I mean, he&#39;d then have the best ship around.  He could then \ndestroy the Maximals once and for all. And Megatron would be in \ncommand of the ship and he wouldn&#39;t have even gotten his hands \ndirty.  We would have done it for him.  I&#39;ll bet that would earn a \nlittle respect from him.&quot; She looked up at the ceiling with a wide \ngrin on her face. &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s be proud of us.  We could go and \nconquer the ship and just hand it over to him.  We do all the work \nand he gets the ship.&quot;\n\nJust the it clicked in her head, they did all the work now and were \ngetting nothing. A good crew must be paid well for thier efforts lest \nthey leave or turn on you.  A good pack leader must take good care of \na good crew.  Megatron wasn&#39;t doing anything but getting the group \nkilled off one by one.  They had already lost Quickstrike and \nDarkMouse.  Who knows who was next to go meet the Matrix.\n\n\n"}}
