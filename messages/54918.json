She looked \naround the trees and didn&#39;t see anything that looked familiar to her. \nShe started running along the stream, but it was still the other way. \nShe looked up at a bird when she felt the ground give way under her. \nShe fell down the embankment of a river. She she hit her head on a \nlarge rock and landed in the water. The fast pace of the river \ncarried her far down stream, down towards Hydras base.Her little fox \nbody washed up on the shore of the river near the base. Her little \nmaximal signature would have been picked up soon.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord saw that cam wasn&#39;t inside the base... then he sarched \nusing \n&gt; the circuits 10 yards out the base\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Cam:;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She was about 5 hundred yards away from the base at this point. \nShe \n&gt; &gt; gets up and walks along the side of the stream, getting further \n&gt; still \n&gt; &gt; from the base.
