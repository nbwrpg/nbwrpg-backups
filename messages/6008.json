He then opened a comm\nto\n&gt; the Iron Fist.\n&gt;     &quot;I will tell you one more time to surrender the ship, or I will\ndestroy\n&gt; it.&quot; Magmatron said. &quot;Mantella, go back to base and tell Bobertron to\npress\n&gt; the little red button in the locked glass case of my command chair. And\nafter\n&gt; that get some rest, you might be needing it.&quot;\n&gt;     Magmatron was prepared for the Nemisis herself. So he was hoping that\nif\n&gt; this ship was going to attack his base it would have similar armaments as\nthe\n&gt; Nemisis.\n&gt;\n&gt; (I need you guys to reply, I don&#39;t care how, just reply.
