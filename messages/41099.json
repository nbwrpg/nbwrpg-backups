The beetle then turnes. Then several missile \nlaunchers each\nholding 6 missiles come out of him. 2 out of his sides, 2 out of each \nof his\narms and legs,and 2 from under his wings. They quickly about-face and \noutrun\nthe explosions. After the missiles are used up they charged.\nBeetle:Beetlebot Terrorize.\nGrasshopper:Hopperrop Terrorize.\n They all meet in close range combat. They duke it out until it \noccurs to\nStallex to take tham back to the ship. He signals to Rhesus and they \nbegin.\nWhen they reach the ship Stallex puts his plan into action.\nStallex:Carnitron! Drain all transformers with predicon frequencies.\n 2 matalic tenticles extend from the front of the ship and wrap around\nthe 2 predicons. They are then filled with blue energy,and the \nPredicons\nscream. They then fall silent and the tenticules retract.\nStallex:How much power do you think we got.\nRhesus:Not even enough for a take off.\n The proto-humans then step out. A female steps forward and her \nspeach can\nbarely be reconized(this is one of the 2 cheetor educated).\nGirl:Thank you for help us.\nRhesus:Help you? Who helped you?\nStallex:This is a war. They were our enemies.\n She translates what she can,and the proto-humans start eyeing each \nother\nsuspicously.\nproto-humans:war...war...war...WAR...War...war,war,war.\n So they charge at each other and begin the first of millions of \nmindless,\nstupid,selfish,pointless,negociable wars in history(the one with the\npredicons was in self-defence).The 2 bots stare at the scene \nremembering\nthe human history they now  they have created.\nRhesus:You see anything.\nStallex:Nope,I was in the ship the whole time.\n The two race back into the &quot;Carnitron&quot;.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt;  Mustex miserably watches as the meter reaches 0 just as they touch \n&gt; down\n&gt; in the jungles of India. Now he has to get some energy. He will \nhave \n&gt; to\n&gt; hunt down some large animals. He knows it is not fair. It was the \nmost\n&gt; painful thing possible to an organic to have their energy sucked \nout \n&gt; of them,\n&gt; let alone to end only in death.\n&gt; Mustex:Carnitron is there any other way to get the power.\n&gt; Carnitron:Well actually there is a small Rocak generator near here \n&gt; capable\n&gt; of producing small amounts of Energon that might get us a little \n&gt; farther.\n&gt; Mustex:I&#39;m on it.\n&gt;  He runs out.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Mustex comfortably sits at the controls. The others had reported \n&gt; &gt; that the\n&gt; &gt; ship seemed difficult to control, almost wild, but it is so easy \nto \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; Several times it almost seemed that the ship read his mind. Soon \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; have to stop at India. It seems almost sad that at full power \nthis \n&gt; &gt; ship\n&gt; &gt; could destroy the Ark like it was nothing,but it couldn&#39;t now \neven \n&gt; &gt; fly around\n&gt; &gt; the world at 200 mph or 1 billionth of its maximum speed(no \ncurrent \n&gt; &gt; living\n&gt; &gt; being could survive its maximum speed although I may later try to \n&gt; &gt; negociate\n&gt; &gt; wormholes).\n&gt; &gt;  Suddenly he is in a darkness.\n&gt; &gt; Voice:Master...master...master...\n&gt; &gt;  Mustex approaches a strange purple creature.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:Who are you?\n&gt; &gt; Creature:I am Carnitron...Master.\n&gt; &gt;  Carnitron bows down to Mustex.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:Ca-Car-Carnitron.\n&gt; &gt; Creature:Yes that is what you christened me.

I am here to give you a \n&gt; present.\n&gt; &gt;  He raises his hand and sparks fly at Mustex. Suddenly he is \nawake. \n&gt; &gt; Stallex\n&gt; &gt; and Rhesus are there. Still,it is different. There are now \nstrings \n&gt; &gt; connecting\n&gt; &gt; both objects and ideas to each other. He can even vaguely glimpse \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; universes core which was both everywhere and nowhere.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:What happened?\n&gt; &gt; Stallex:Some kind of power surge. You look like a partial \n&gt; transmetal \n&gt; &gt; now. The\n&gt; &gt; ship&#39;s behaving better maybe you taught it some manners.\n&gt; &gt;  He had. Now that they had talked the ship knew who it could \ntrust.\n&gt; &gt; Mustex:Let me have a mirror.\n&gt; &gt;  He isn&#39;t a part transmetal he saw. That would have effected both \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; organics and some robotics,this change effected only his \nRobotics. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; what he is.
