However =\r\nCRYOTEK\n&gt; had made his way back to stand with DINOBOT and SKYSHADOW. &quot;We ma=\r\ny\n&gt; need them before we get to the end of this.&quot; CRYOTEK said\n&gt; thoughtfull=\r\ny. &quot;This is obviously a trap of some sort and unfortunately\n&gt; we seem to be=\r\n caught within it as much as the Maximals are.&quot; he said\n&gt; in a low voice.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; SKYSHADOW nodded, &quot;Unfortunately I have to agree.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK glanced=\r\n at DINOBOT, &quot;But go ahead and do what you can to keep\n&gt; them off balance. =\r\nWe can&#39;t have them ready to turn against us too\n&gt; soon.&quot; He grunted, &quot;Hydra=\r\ns has been taken from us, that seriously\n&gt; changes the balance of power her=\r\ne.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT nodded, &quot;As you say.  If there is a third assemblage=\r\n of forces on this planet, with as extensive an army and a system as to set=\r\n up this jamming zone, this underground facility, and also tracking us clos=\r\nely enough to capture our leaders, then for now they are a greater priority=\r\n.&quot;\n\nPausing then a moment, &quot;If the rodent remains with us, was he not a min=\r\ner originally?  Perhpas he mgiht aid then in our explorations and digging.&quot;=\r\n  For had not his memory files given a vague recollection of Rattrap once s=\r\ntating he was the greatest miner in the Vega Cluster?\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Active =\r\nsensors are down here inside the cave, however vibrations can\n&gt; be sensed b=\r\ny DRILLBIT, vibrations that center roughly about in the\n&gt; entrance chamber =\r\nwhere they first entered into the caves. Vibrations\n&gt; were very familiar to=\r\n DRILL BIT and but centered on that entrance way\n&gt; but spreading out to aff=\r\nect even the tunnels he was digging. . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Even above the rest of the MA=\r\nXIMALS and PREDACONS began to feel a\n&gt; rumble and then a shaking, the rumbl=\r\ning quickly being felt down the\n&gt; paths to where the rest of the MAXIMALS a=\r\nnd the PREDACONS stood.\n&gt; Anyone who had ever had any experience inside of =\r\ncaves or in\n&gt; underground setting knew what they were feeling.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ope=\r\nning tremors for a CAVE IN!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; The walls began to shake as stone and =\r\nrocks began to fall. The\n&gt; apparent only way to safety lay in further into =\r\nthe caves themselves,\n&gt; since, strangely enough, it was the cave through wh=\r\nich most of the\n&gt; MAXIMALS and PREDACON had entered this place was from whe=\r\nre it seemed\n&gt; to be extending from.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was like they were being pushe=\r\nd or herded forward!\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt this point, DRILL BIT, and the others wh=\r\no had been hiding over underground trasnformed to robot mode and began raci=\r\nng forwards as fast as they could, without care for whom they might be tram=\r\npling over in front of them!\n\n&quot;Gang way gang way gang way!&quot;  The group rush=\r\ning forwards in disarray even as the cave seemed to be coming down about th=\r\nem!\n\n\n\n"}}
