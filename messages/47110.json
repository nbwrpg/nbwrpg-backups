I dont remember hearing anything about this\nhistory with Hot Rod and the dragons. If you plan to have characters\nwith backstory that involves another owned char, you must check with the\nchar&#39;s owner. This is because the two backstories will most likely\ninterfear with each other. I know I never had Hot Rod leading any dragon\nMaximals. In fact in my backstory Hot Rod hadn&#39;t been seen since the\ngreat upgrade, untill just before he came to NBW.\nPlease email me to discuss your history with Hot Rod. And yes, you must\nget this checked out with me, its in the rules.\n\n"}}
