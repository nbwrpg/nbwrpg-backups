He thought to\n&gt; himself for a second. He didnt have quite the expertise of Ratchet, \nor\n&gt; Hoist. But he was better at this than he was at fighting. He opened \nhis\n&gt; chest compartment, and ordered his computer to convert some of his \nown\n&gt; energon into a cube. He then placed it into Redhot&#39;s hand, hoping it\n&gt; would be enough for now. He then activated his geological\nequipment, \nand\n&gt; monitered Redhot&#39;s head, for anything unusual, magnetic \ninterferance,\n&gt; mocrobes, etc.\n\n\n    ::REDHOT::\n\n    The look of desperation in Redhot&#39;s eyes when the energon was \nplaced in his hand spoke volumes. He weakly nibbled at it, resting \nbetween feeble laps. The energy helped him stabilize his\nconcentration \nand it gave him the strength to give Beachcomber a thankful smile.\n    He gathered some strength to study Beachcomber&#39;s geological \nequipment. He gave it a wary eye. The tools looked alien, but that\nwas \nlikely due to Redhot&#39;s condition. He wished he could see straight. \n    It was then he felt the energy around him. He gasped. He hadn&#39;t \ncovered his trail..anyone a world away could read his signature. He \ntried to will the trail away but it would not respond to his\ncommands. \nMaybe that was what the stranger studied. Either that or he was \npicking up Redhot&#39;s electromagnetic field. It was readable when he\nwas \nunder stress and was strongest in his head and shoulders.\n    Redhot sighed. He lay back his head and closed his eyes. He\nwished \nhis situation would go away.\n\n Northlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**************************\n\n\n"}}
