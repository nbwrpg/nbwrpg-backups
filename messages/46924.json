Even I don&#39;t \nremember \n&gt; where I left him.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Aerotaur/Terrataur/Pyrotaur/Aquataur::\n&gt;        He nods.  &quot;Nightlight, I want you and Trinity to stay here \nand keep \n&gt; the autoguns online as long as possible.&quot;  He turns to the others \nand thrusts \n&gt; a fist into the air.  &quot;Now is the time to strike!&quot;  He and the other \n&gt; Taurusoids run out of the base.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aerotaur takes flight attacking SS with a spiraling slash of \nhis \n&gt; double bladed staff.  He then whips around from the other side and \nfires 4 \n&gt; shots at him.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Pyrotaur unleashes a stream of flame at the ground troops, \nfollowed by \n&gt; a stream of water from Aquataur.  The rapid heating and cooling more \nlikely \n&gt; to cause damage through expansion and contraction than either one \nseparate.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Terrataur tunnels under the ground, just below the surface, \nunder the \n&gt; enemy bots.  She thus makes it likely to cave in after being shot if \nnot \n&gt; under their sheer weight.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Amperion::\n&gt;        In his travels, exploring the world he had finally come to \nthe western \n&gt; part of North America.
