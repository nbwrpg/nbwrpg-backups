A large form \nthen made its way through and flew towards the planet. It ressembled some \nkind of winged whale, but it was obviously not an organic being. However, \nthe very way it moved told of organic origins...\n\nInside the ship, three transformers operated the Shadow Destiny. They were \nthe Prophets, the elite Tripredacus Strike Force.\n\nGesper:\nWe are on final approach of Earth. Geostationnary orbit in 3,2, 1... stable \norbit achieved.\n\nThe ship&#39;s wings flailed in the void of space to keep it over a precise \ncontinent of the planet.\n\nMelchana:\nTarget in sight. I can fire whenever you wish.\n\nBelthassan:\nPrepare the key to vector Sigma. Fire when you have a lock.\n\nMelchana:\nWhat? We have the key with us? This is utter madness! You jeopardize this \nmission by bringing it with us!\n\nBelthassan:\nShut up, sister! The key shall be terminated as soon as we have no more use \nfor it, and that time will be right after you have fired it! Now stop \ndiscussing and do your job!\n\nMelchana reluctantly agreed with her elder brother, but she would never say \nit to anyone else. She knew it was necessary to the operation...\nShe fired and she looked through the monitors. The whole continent was being \ntechnologicized...\n\nBelthassan:\nNow, Melchana, fire the reformatting cannon...\n\nShe fired the gun once again. This time, the continent started to reflorish \nand it became techno-organic. Australia had become a fusion of organisms and \ntechnology.\n\nBelthassan:\nPrepare for atmospherical entry. Gesper, land the Shadow Destiny at the \nSoutheast point of Australia and prepare it for deployment. Melchana, track \nthe Hellgate and send a message to lieutenant Daemos concerning our arrival. \nFinally, jettisson the key to vector sigma and fire the reformatting cannon \non it.\n\nThe key, hit by the ray, started glowing brightly and exploded. Its light \ncould be seen from many places on the earth.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
