Each of them began wondering off to get back to\nwhatever duties they had before the meeting was called.\n\n\n\nSoon enough Hydras stood alone in the throne room. There was only him\nand the hum of machinery and monitors in the room around him. Even\nInferno, his most loyal troop had left the room, although he was\nstanding just outside of the door should Hydras have need of him.\n\nCyclonus sent back to Hydras, &quot;I will have Taratulus watch at all times.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
