She nodded and smiled sweetly \nat him.  He was starting to grow on her a little. She straightened \nherself up and stood up. She walked over to Megatron. She put a hand \non his shoulder. &quot;What do you think?  I could have sent him to your \nbase and your fighters would have never known the difference. I \nmanaged to fix the skin color problem. Now, &quot;she smiled at \nMegatron,&quot;Tell me, what do you think? Shall I send this clone into \nbattle while you stay safe? Or let you go into battle and leave your \nclone as your predessessor?&quot; She chuckled softly. &quot;I think I know the \nanswer to that one. And as far as trust goes between you and I, I \nshall give you the control of the clone. But not untill we find the \nresting place of the Allience ship. When we leave for battle, then \nyou will have your clone. The clone is so perfect, I want to make \nsure I am talking to you, and not your clone. Surely you can \nunderstand. For I think you would do the same thing in my place.&quot;\n\nShe walked over to Aracnia, flashing a smile at Destructor as she \npassed by him.  &quot;Aracnia, I will need a DNA sample in order to create \na proper clone of you. Then our clone will fight for us, and not put \nourselves in danger.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
