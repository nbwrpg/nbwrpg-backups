The blade \nstops as her left claw, that tried to deflect it, meets with Deemos&#39; \nhand (probably slice a bit or something, but up to you). Not really \nfeeling the pain yet, due to the battle craze, she stabs at Deemos&#39; \nshoulder (arm with machette) with her right set of claws.\n\n\nOn 30 May 2001, at 19:49, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n\n&gt; Train Wreck&#39;s sides were smashed open with large holes, but sitll he\n&gt; kept streaking forward crazily towards Windlord, his tires making\n&gt; hissing noises and one of them flying off.
