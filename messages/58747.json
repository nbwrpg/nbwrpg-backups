I&#39;m now the student \nteacher of 25 kids learning English as their second language in an \nintensive class. The whole thing is just great.\n\nHowever, it takes all my day off because I leave home at 6h15 am. I \neven have to work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so I am totally out for \nthese two days.\n\nSo, I&#39;ll try my best to post, but if my chars block the storyline, \neither make them do the small thing they need to do or ask Robo or \nAirly to play a key character if it&#39;s more important.\n\nThanks!\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
