She liked it, very much.\nBut when Prowl had suddenly dived to avoid further threat to both of them she could have sworn that she left her stomach back where they had just been, not to mention that the dive had almost caused her to grip her arms tighter around Prowl and even maybe squeeze him to hard!\nIron Raptor had closed her optics tightly as they had dove but had re-opened them when Prowl had caught that thermal and was in a safe glide, she had gasped/sighed when she had re-opened her optics...she was a ground soldier, not a aerial specialist!\nAs Prowl had begun to glide towards Shocker she had wrenched her head back again and got the same up side down view, she growled at the enemy and at the fact that she was basically useless in this position. But then it occurred to her, perhaps she wasn&#39;t!\nIron Raptor hated to do it but she managed to unwrap a hand from around Prowl and had opened her com-link, she spoke into it.*\n\n&quot; Iris, activate auto-guns and fire on target 6-1-7-5 (Shocker).&quot;\n\n* With that said she waited for a response from the moody defence system and was actually shocked at how slow it had taken Iris to respond.*\n\nIRIS: &quot;Transmission received, activating auto-guns and targeting.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor relaxed a bit more in Prowl&#39;s arms but did manage to wrap her free arm around him again, despite the slight comfort of the activation of the auto-guns the comfort and safety of being in Prowl&#39;s arms was greater. The reason, she did not know.\nShe watched as the Arks guns began to come online and turn towards Shocker, with a metallic sounding slam they locked into place and were set to fire, within second the guns began to send deadly charges towards the enemy with even deadlier force!\nIron Raptor looked up at Prowl and gave him a extra tight squeeze to get his attention, he had to get out of the way so that the auto-gun charges couldn&#39;t bring him down. They were aimed towards Shocker and only him but any bot unwise enough to get in their way was bound to get hit. She didn&#39;t want Prowl to get damaged any more then he was, she could feel the slickness of the mech fluid on his back and she didn&#39;t like it.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
