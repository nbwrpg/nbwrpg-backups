Here&#39;s the latest update:\n&gt; \n&gt; People running for council:\n&gt; \n&gt; rAuq (has all the support he needs)\n&gt; Roborick (has all the support he needs)\n&gt; KSLawdogg (has all the support he needs)\n&gt; Icedemon (has all the support he needs)\n&gt; Megan (has all the support she needs)\n&gt; Rudrak (needs one more supporter)\n&gt; \n&gt; People who other people supported, but who have not\n&gt; informed me that\n&gt; they&#39;re running (well, not after I announced it\n&gt; officially):\n&gt; \n&gt; Kinger\n&gt; Alloran (rumor has it you&#39;re not running, Alloran,\n&gt; but people are\n&gt; still supporting you)\n&gt; JP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So, if you got support and you&#39;re not running,\n&gt; please clear it up with\n&gt; everyone, and if you need more support, try to look\n&gt; for some. I think\n&gt; we should forget about the due date and keep this\n&gt; going untill its all\n&gt; figured out. The first time can be hectic.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
