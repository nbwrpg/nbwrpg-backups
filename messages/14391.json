He looks up, seeing the earth above him. Ramulus&#39; \neyes widen as he looks at the planet. This is the first time he had seen it \nfrom afar. He would never forget how it looked.\n\nSuddenly, a desire to see Cybertron flared in the Maximal. Irrationally, he \nwonders if the shuttle they had taken from earth could get all the way to \nCybertron. He shakes the thought out of his mind. He was needed here, in the \nwar, where he had been for the last many years. The Maximals needed him, and \nhe had fought to the death for the Maximal cause, and would again if needed.\n\nRamulus looks at Fliq. &quot;What does Cybertron look like?&quot; he asks curioustly.\n\n"}}
