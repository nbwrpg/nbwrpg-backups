Blast doors \n&gt; shut \n&gt; &gt; in various places of the Alliance base as panels split up, the \nbase \n&gt; &gt; beginning to seperate. A few seconds later, the base was laying \nin \n&gt; &gt; five pieces in the clearing. The left one was the residential \narea, \n&gt; &gt; the right one the labs and CR room, back one was the cargo holds \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; weapon rooms, and the front one was the bridge, training room, \nand \n&gt; &gt; other such facilities. In the middle sections were the power \n&gt; supply, \n&gt; &gt; shields generators, and the anti-gravity devices which had \n&gt; mobolized \n&gt; &gt; the Alliance base in the past (before the anti moble base rule). \n&gt; &gt; Since the base was disconnected from the power supply, it had no \n&gt; &gt; power, an all the facilities were shut off, except for the ones \nin \n&gt; &gt; the power supply section.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The four IF shuttles fly toward the sections of the base, the one \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; the clearing also flying up to help.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus smiles, taching each shuttle hatch on to a section of the \n&gt; &gt; Alliance base.
