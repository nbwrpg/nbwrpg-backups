She was \n&gt; dreaming of a home that no longer existed.  Her home planet of \n&gt; Kapaflax was once like Cybertron. Made of metal and home to \nbillions \n&gt; of bots. Then the plague came.  Now all that was left was a rust \n&gt; cloud that floated about in space.  She was put into a pod and \n&gt; evacuated from the planet by her parents before the plague could \nget \n&gt; to her.  She was 5 when she was put into the pod.  Now she was 9 \n&gt; years old.  She slept and dreamed of times gone by. She muttered \nin \n&gt; her sleep, &quot;Yes Mommy, I&#39;ll get Daddy to fix the subspace \n&gt; entertainment connection. The Heavily Injured Bots Emergency Bay \nis \n&gt; on tonight. It should be a good one tonight.&quot;  She rolled over in \n&gt; her sleep and smiled.\n\n\n"}}
