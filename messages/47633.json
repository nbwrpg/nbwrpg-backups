He looked around at the others\nstrewn about in the crash. Some he knew would never rise again, others had\nalready begun to move, to shake off the effects of the forced landing.\n&quot;Everyone who isn&#39;t deactivated sound off.&quot;\n\n    His words while commanding were spoken lightly, no need to shoutat them\nyet after the crash. Sitting up in his chair he reached out touching a comm\nbutton, frowning at the crackle and hiss as he opened the line to the\nthruster section of the frigate. Smacking the panel with his metallic fist\nhe was rewarded by the ping of connection, &quot;Engineering report, how bad&#39;s\nthe damage...can we lift off again anytime soon?&quot;\n\n    Shaking the last few webs of energon from his memory circuits he got a\ngood look outside the ships main window, or at least the massive shattered\nremains of the window. Outside the sky was clear and clouds covered the sky\nin fluffy patches. At least they didn&#39;t land in the middle of a desert,\nthat&#39;s all they needed, sand in their joints, or worse, snow....he didn&#39;t\nmind cold weather assignments so much it&#39;s just he disliked snow itself and\nthe cold that came with it....\n\n    Shaking his head again he frowned, that window needed repairing if they\nwere gonna lift off again, the blast doors that sheilded them could still be\nworking but flying based on sensors alone was always risky. Touching the\ncommunication button again, &quot;Engineering, status on thrusters and general\nship systems.&quot;\n\n(OOC)\n\n    Just to beat rauq to the punch the first post for the new beast wars...\n:)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
