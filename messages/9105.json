He would \nhave to learn to make peace with himself in order to continue on.  \nShe thought that if they were ever to have a chance, he would have to \nfight his own demons that plagued him.  This was one fight that she \ncouldn&#39;t help him with.  She shook her head and flew off.  She soared \nover the hills and looked about.\n\nShe came upon a clearing.  She perched and looked down.  She saw two \nbots standing next to each other.  One was standing while the other \nwas sitting.  One was holding some type of device with wires coming \nout of it and attaching to the other bot&#39;s head.  She used her \ntelescopic vision to look at the symbols. Predacons!  \n\nShe decided to just keep an eye on things.  She stayed perched high \nup in the tree and observed what was going on.\n\n\n"}}
