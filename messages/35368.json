Her blood already\nstained the floor of the Black Fortress. Blacknightmare was obviously a bot\nwho didn&#39;t take chances. Either that or the Predacon just loved to shoot her\nstungun. Silver Scout fainted out of  consciousness, her vitals were slowing\nas she lay in a lump on the floor. Shr had challenged her foe and lost. If\nshe didn&#39;t recieve help she&#39;d soon die.\n\nBlaze and Bullet stood over the still bot stareing at the bot. Bullet kicked\nit viciously to make sure it wasn&#39;t acting. &quot;We got it boss.&quot; he said\nturning to Blacknightmare.\n\nBlaze licked her lips at the sight of the downed hawk, &quot;Can we eat it?&quot; she\nasked hopeing for a good organic meal. The energeon rations that she&#39;d been\neating were adaquate for survival but tasted like battery acid compared to a\ngood organic meal. She transformed to tiger and started sniffing Silver\nScout. &quot;She&#39;s still alive.&quot; she stated in disapointment. &quot;Can I kill it?&quot;\nshe asked, as she took a lick of  the mutants energeon from the floor.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 22, 2001 4:23 PM\nSubject: Re: Happanings at BlackFortress\n\n\n&gt; Blaacknightmare:\n&gt;\n&gt; Blacknightmare ran towars Silverscout, aimed her stungun and said &quot;We\n&gt; capture you!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She fired 25 times against Silverscout, she knew that it will be\n&gt; enough to put her in stasis lock.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:&gt; Silver\n&gt; Scout was ready this time. she rolled to her feat jumping into the\n&gt; &gt; air causeing two shots to pass under her. the next shot pushed her\n&gt; back to\n&gt; &gt; the floor sending her sliding into the wall. the fourth shot went\n&gt; passed her\n&gt; &gt; and headed toward Bullet.
