This \nwas better than he had imagined. With a whole new group, especially \none with a gestalt, the Alliance could become quite alot stronger..\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he replies over the comm-link, &quot;We can talk more about the \nterms later, after the battle. Be careful if you&#39;re coming here. \nThere&#39;s a battle and the shields are up. I&#39;ll set the defences to not \nfire on you.&quot;\n\nZardus looks around, realizing that there were quite alot of bots \nfiring at Koj and Inu, something that wasn&#39;t really neccessary. He \ntaps a few buttons, putting the Mafia on friend for now.\n\n&quot;Alliance bots,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;The Mafia is coming \nhere, don&#39;t fire at them. They seemed to have changed their minds \nfrom war to peace.&quot;\n\nHe walks over to Squizzy, firing a few more shots at Koj. &quot;Is the lab \nready for the base to be moved? As soon as this battle&#39;s over, we \nneed to move out.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shokaract aproaches the Alliance&#39;s base in beast mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shokaract: Leader of the Alliance, we come in peace.
