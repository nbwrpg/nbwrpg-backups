Sorry it took so long, a good bit to\n&gt; make sure of. Oh well ...\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus continued to bath the forms in energy as they shift=\r\ned and were\n&gt; transformed by the now corrupted matrix! Then as soon as quic=\r\nkly energy\n&gt; started it stopped and the five forms lay before him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tw=\r\no by two, five pair of optics fluttered and then lit as life once\n&gt; again i=\r\nnvigorated their once apparently dead circuits. They sat up and\n&gt; nimbly cl=\r\nimbed to their feet. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings soldiers of Unicron!&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice=\r\n was rich and powerful\n&gt; as he regarded his progeny. &quot;You have awakened to =\r\na new world, a new\n&gt; universe. I am Cyclonus, herald of Unicron, Introduce =\r\nyourselves!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The first to step forward was massive with weapons fairly=\r\n ripping from\n&gt; his body. His most prominent features being the crimson cyl=\r\ninders of\n&gt; arm cannons that extended from massive red armored shoulders do=\r\nwn past\n&gt; his elbows. While there are touches of red at his fore arms, hips=\r\n and\n&gt; feet, the rest of his large form is dominated by gunmetal gray, with=\r\n\n&gt; only highlights of yellow at his chest and face.  &quot;I am DEEPSTRYKE&quot; he\n&gt;=\r\n says, the deep bass of his voice reverberating across the area.\n&gt; &quot;Superio=\r\nr firepower wins battles, superior intellect wins wars.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The next to s=\r\ntep forward was a female, tall and slender, she radiated a\n&gt; cold power and=\r\n confidence. She like Deepstryke was predominantly red,\n&gt; especially across=\r\n her torso, chest, hips and feet, but most of the rest\n&gt; of her was covered=\r\n in an ebony black armor. Her face is framed by four\n&gt; fin-like projections=\r\n sweeping back behind her head like some mask, and\n&gt; yet the look of her fa=\r\nce is almost achingly beautiful to behold.  &quot;I am\n&gt; PHOBIA.&quot; She smiled as =\r\nshe took her place behind the first. &quot;Your\n&gt; greatest fear is my greatest v=\r\nice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The third to step forward is a truly dark soldier, colored in de=\r\nep\n&gt; purple and black, his optics are almost furtive as he surveys the area=\r\n.\n&gt; The twin boosters positioned above his shoulders, the nosecone on his\n&gt;=\r\n chest as well as the wings that sprout from behind his shoulders and\n&gt; cal=\r\nves hint at his aerial alt-mode. He moved to stand to the other side\n&gt; of D=\r\neepstryke. &quot;I am NIGHTRAZOR.&quot; His voice was quiet, understated and\n&gt; calm a=\r\ns his optics focused on Cyclonus. &quot;Don&#39;t fear what you cannot\n&gt; see, fear w=\r\nhat do not expect.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The next to step forward is another female robot, =\r\nperhaps as tall as\n&gt; Phobia but not quite as smooth. She is wide shouldered=\r\n and slim of hip,\n&gt; her armor is nearly all gunmetal gray, save for the ite=\r\nms that betray\n&gt; her alt-mode. Large intake engines on her back, her face a=\r\nnd a nosecone\n&gt; like assembly on her chest all display her aerial mode. At =\r\nthe top of\n&gt; her intake jet though open to display rather large speaker-lik=\r\ne\n&gt; assemblies and the sound of her voice seemed to boom as much from them\n=\r\n&gt; as from her mouth. &quot;I am DECIBEL.&quot; Her voice is powerful as it echoes\n&gt; o=\r\nver the landscape. She quirked a small smile as her voice while\n&gt; assuming =\r\na more reasonable volume was still powerful nonetheless, &quot;The\n&gt; sound of my=\r\n music is death in your ears!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The last of the quintuplets to step for=\r\nward was something like\n&gt; Deepstryke. While not as tall, he was thick and w=\r\nell armored. The large\n&gt; intake jets that made up his chest were a deep blu=\r\ne as well as the\n&gt; cranial guard of is helm, parts of his fore arms, his hi=\r\nps, his lower\n&gt; legs and his feet. On his shoulder a large silver/gray cann=\r\non is\n&gt; mounted and in his left hand is an equally vicious looking rifle. H=\r\nis\n&gt; steps are heavy and powerful as he took up his place behind the rest.\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;I am TUMULT!&quot; His voice was that of a soldier, zealous and eager, \n&gt; &quot;Th=\r\ne greater the fight, the more glorious the Victory!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the five compl=\r\nete their introductions they unison drop to one knee,\n&gt; &quot;We are yours to co=\r\nmmand Lord Cyclonus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus, who had been smiling up to this time f=\r\nrowned, &quot;You are\n&gt; warriors of UNICRON! Never forget that.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whatever=\r\n you command Lord Cyclonus.&quot; They spoke once again in unison. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cycl=\r\nonus continued to frown, unsure if his point was taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus turne=\r\nd to look at Remus, &quot;Through the defeat of your leader\n&gt; you have been gran=\r\nted a stay of execution, that stay is at an end -\n&gt; follow us no longer.&quot; C=\r\nyclonus glanced skywards, obviously about to\n&gt; take off. He looked back at =\r\nRemus, &quot;But know this, without Rodimus\n&gt; Prime you cannot stand against us.=\r\n If your leaders choose to surrender\n&gt; we may consider it. Otherwise when n=\r\next we meet it will be as bringers\n&gt; of your destruction.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus s=\r\nmiled slightly, &quot;Until we meet again maximal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: If Remus remains s=\r\nilent than all will move skyward and quickly\n&gt; disappear. \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (=\r\nDa&#39;minion)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n_______________________________________________=\r\n_____________________________________\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
