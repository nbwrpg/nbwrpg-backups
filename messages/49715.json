I&#39;ve heard that story plenty of times, bub.  And it&#39;s always \na flat-out LIE.\n\nNow that you&#39;ve seen my knee-jerk opinion of your arguement, how \nabout something a little more thoughtful ...\n\nLet me remind you that I DID put a cap on the weapon&#39;s firing rate - \nalbeit belatedly.  Not to mention Wheeljack-X isn&#39;t the type of \nfellow to take advantage of a stasis-locked bot unless they did \nsomething to REALLY tick him off, which is a legendary feat in and of \nitself.  Depending on the size of the character, and the relative \nvulnerability to magnetism (there IS a difference between bots in \nthat regard, see below), and of course individual tendencies to allow \ndamage to characters, it could take three shots, or six, or ten, \netc.  This is the same with most other weapons, you know.\n\nAs I said, individual bots may have different susceptibility to \nmagnetic fields.  Those with plasma-based weapons are in real \ntrouble, as are those with more sophisticated circuitry.  (In case \nyou didn&#39;t know, plasma is easily affected by magnetism.)\n\nAnd a quick physics lesson for those who are in dire need of such \neducation: an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a rapidly-spreading \nburst along most or all of the electromagnetic spectrum.  A magnetic \nfield (note the obvious terminology difference: pulse vs field) is a \nset of force lines that loop back on themselves - affecting only a \nfew parts of the same spectrum.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Look, the main reason I asked to hold firing your new weapon was \n&gt; because I was not certain of wether it was in the bounds of \nlegality \n&gt; or not. The way I saw it was that the weapon could send a bot to \n&gt; stasis lock in no time. We&#39;d like to keep this rpg as fair to \neveryone \n&gt; as possible. That&#39;s all and there&#39;s no reason to say we don&#39;t like \nnew \n&gt; ideas just because of that.\n\n\n"}}
