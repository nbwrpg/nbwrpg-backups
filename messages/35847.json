She&#39;d been sitting in the CR chamber for\nshe\n&gt; didn&#39;t know how long.  She pounded on the door to no avail.  She began to\n&gt; overhear Burning Hammer&#39;s conversation with Nightlight and Zeni.  She\nneeded\n&gt; to get out of the CR chamber.  She finally realized she had a second gun\nand\n&gt; shot a hole in the door large enough for her to reach out and open it.\n&gt;\n&gt;     She stepped into the room rather melodramatically.  &quot;Burning Hammer.\nWhy\n&gt; do you lie to yourself?  Tell yourself that you must kill them because\nit&#39;s\n&gt; your job.  Because they didn&#39;t trust you after you tried to kill them.\nThey\n&gt; are not gods.  They don&#39;t forgive instantly.  You must know that by now.\nYou\n&gt; are not a stupid bot.  I suspect that you liked it here.  You should also\n&gt; know that they decided not to erase your memories because they wanted it\nto\n&gt; be your choice to stay.  Don&#39;t you understand that they aren&#39;t like any\nother\n&gt; faction in this war.  Fighting for members and imposing it on other bots.\nIf\n&gt; they were I would&#39;ve stepped out shooting.  Actually I wouldn&#39;t have\nbecause\n&gt; I&#39;d now be reprogrammed but I wasn&#39;t.  Now can you give me one good reason\n&gt; that you should do anything but thank and help these people?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
