I would love to keep in touch.  I \n  will now \n  &gt; tell my h=\r\nistory here, for those who don&#39;t know me as well as others. \n   One \n  &gt; da=\r\ny, a year and a half ago, i was on Ben Yee&#39;s message board.  I \n  came acro=\r\nss \n  &gt; a post talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.  I had been looking to joi=\r\nn \n  an RPG, \n  &gt; but none of them interested me, until NBW.  When i joined=\r\n, it was \n  just a \n  &gt; mailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of the =\r\ncurrent list of \n  members.  \n  &gt; Eventually, we became part of egroups (no=\r\nw Yahoogroups), and were \n  able to \n  &gt; gain a much larger amount of membe=\r\nrs.  When i joined, the council \n  was \n  &gt; Yanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, an=\r\nd Inferno371.  Soulstice was there \n  too, then \n  &gt; being called &quot;code,&quot; m=\r\nuch to his disliking.  The Maximals were led \n  by Liono \n  &gt; Prime, the Pr=\r\nedacons by Hellbeast.  The Alliance was there, but it \n  was far \n  &gt; small=\r\ner.  And so i began my long involvement.  I saw the tide turn \n  both ways =\r\n\n  &gt; in the war, and small custom factions spring up and then disapear.  \n =\r\n I saw my \n  &gt; fair share of idiots (ahh Icedemon), but there were also som=\r\ne great \n  posters.  \n  &gt; There was Dachande who started the Destrons, Logo=\r\n, who had the \n  hottest female \n  &gt; characters ever, my good friend shomin=\r\n, with his psycho \n  religiousness, \n  &gt; carnagedarkness, with (his/her? no=\r\nt sure) long, thinky posts with \n  Dinobot, \n  &gt; and many others.  And let&#39;=\r\ns not forget Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only \n  tragedy.  \n  &gt; For those of you=\r\n who don&#39;t know, Minime overdosed himself with \n  pills.  To \n  &gt; make matt=\r\ners worse, that bastard JP beleived that the tragic email \n  by his \n  &gt; br=\r\nother was fake.  Oh, and KSL, im not angry that your characters \n  murdered=\r\n \n  &gt; Soundwave, don&#39;t worry about it.  For those that didn&#39;t like me, \n  w=\r\nell then \n  &gt; good for you, but for my friends here, feel free to talk to m=\r\ne \n  whenever you \n  &gt; want.
