And you won&#39;t get\n&gt; pooped just because you make a mistake in your speach.  Besides, as\n&gt; far as I&#39;m concerned, you haven&#39;t done anything to get popped over\n&gt; for,&quot; she paused, &quot;except for cutting on yourself.  You cut on\n&gt; yourself and I will pop you. Got it.  No more self abuse unless I say\n&gt; so, got it? Good. Now, How is your arm feeling, it should be feeling\n&gt; better.&quot; she smiled and chuckled, &quot;But no more hurting yourself.\n&gt; Your too good for that.
