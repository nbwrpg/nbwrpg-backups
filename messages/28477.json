Hey, if he can&#39;t beat Triple H there&#39;s no \nchance in \n&gt; hell he&#39;ll beat the Great One.  That last Wrestlemania Rock lost to \nAustin \n&gt; was just a fluke, the Rock probably had a cold or something)\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark Claw/The Protectobots/Shockwave:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf turned, launching off four fire balls out of his mouth \nwith \n&gt; precise aim at the incoming missiles.  The EMP blasts hit, doing \nslight \n&gt; damage but the thick chest plating helped protect him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Brothers,&quot; he said into his commlink, &quot;it is time we leave.&quot; just \nas he \n&gt; finished the sentence a few bolts of laser energy struck him in the \nback.  \n&gt; More irritated than in pain he spun around on his heal, raising his \nsword and \n&gt; launching off a missile at Cinder as he made his way northward at a \nfast \n&gt; paced run.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper ducked as his scanners told him of missiles, his hands \nreaching \n&gt; up and grabbing two spears.  He turned quickly, throwing both \nspears at the \n&gt; same time at the two energy-signature seeking missiles.  Because of \nthrowing \n&gt; them he was in a strange position, and being that, the missile that \nhit him \n&gt; nearly toppled him over.  Regaining his balance, he formed a \nyellowish orb \n&gt; with the power of a grenade and threw it at Greven, running after \nDemon Wulf.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw&#39;s double laser cannons swerved, firing off a single bolt \neach, \n&gt; intercepting a missile from the Maximals and a missile from \nKillfest.  The \n&gt; other hit his armor but didn&#39;t penetrate into important systems.  \nThe EMP \n&gt; blasts did absolutely nothing against his thick armor plating.  But \na few \n&gt; more missiles and there would be no thick armor plating to protect \nhim, and \n&gt; Dark Claw knew it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transforming to biped mode at Demon Wulf&#39;s order, the Vok warrior \nran, \n&gt; turning slightly to form two black orbs of energy in both hands.  \nHe threw \n&gt; one black orb at Killfest, the other at Mantle.  Both orbs having \nthe power \n&gt; of a few charges.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot transformed to biped mode just in time to see Demon Wulf \nmake a run \n&gt; for it.  He slowly got up, jumping painfully up and grabbed onto \nBlades.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Go up!  He isn&#39;t getting away!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove watched the mess of the battle, and was still a little \nstunned at the \n&gt; landing of a ship.  He looked to Shockwave who attacked from behind \nwhile no \n&gt; one noticed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking out his photon pistol because he was to far away to use his \n&gt; vaporators, he fired off two bolts at the ancient robot&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades made a sighing noise and gained altitude rapidly, arming his \nsmart \n&gt; bombs.  &quot;I you know how I feel about using the missiles.  Can I \njust grind \n&gt; him up in my blades?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid pushed himself to his feet slowly, raising his welding \nlaser and \n&gt; firing off a small burst at Shockwave&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise was approaching Demon Wulf rapidly.  The impact was \nquick and \n&gt; sweet.  For the first millisecond.  Upon impact Streetwise felt \nmass pain as \n&gt; Demon Wulf&#39;s body made an imprint in his grill and hood, and \nproceeded to \n&gt; roll and smash into his windshield and smash it right open.\n&gt; \n&gt; Continuing despite the pain, Streetwise stopped suddenly, sending \nDemon Wulf \n&gt; flying out of the windshield and slamming to the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise transformed to his biped mode with a few crunches of \ninternal \n&gt; machinery adjusting to the structural damage.  When he was fully \nformed the \n&gt; windshield that made up most of his chest cracked badly as was most \nof his \n&gt; chest.  He staggered a moment, barely able to draw his photon \npistol.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave felt a welding laser strike him as it penetrated into \nhim.  He \n&gt; didn&#39;t let out a yell, but intoned instead.  &quot;Fools.&quot;  Photon \nblasts struck \n&gt; his chest plating and slighty cut into it.  It was time to leave.  \nThe \n&gt; Alliance Vok were leaving.  Raising the missile launcher he fired \noff  a \n&gt; rocket at Groove.  He began a run and leapt into the air, \ntransforming into a \n&gt; space fighter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Powering his engines to top speed he began to gain altitude rapidly \nand \n&gt; started to head in a northeastern direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; He got a target lock and launched off two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles \n&gt; down at EndBringer.\n\n\n"}}
