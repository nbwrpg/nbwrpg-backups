Mantle steps forward, the \nothers standing back.\n\n&quot;Hello, my name is Mantle and this is my team,&quot; he says, gesturing \nbehind him, &quot;We&#39;re a group of Maximals that were with Striker&#39;s \ngroup, and we&#39;ve been looking for him.

Hmm...who are you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris walked up beside Iron Raptor, sighing and shaking her head \nat the \n&gt; sight of Prowl&#39;s limp body.\n&gt; &lt; How praductable.&gt; she thought as she walked up to the base of \nElement.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You can put him down now. No more trouble will come from that \nman.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris turned back to Iron Raptor, glaring at her from under her \nhelm.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Shouldn&#39;t you be concerned about that meeting Angel Prime \ndisappeared to? \n&gt; He said that you should be there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor glanced at Iris, her hair slightly in her eyes and \nfalling \n&gt; down her shoulders.*\n&gt; &lt; There&#39;s something a little bigger that needs my attention.&gt;\n&gt; &lt; And what&#39;s that, this thing?&gt; Iris asked, gesturing towards \nElement.\n&gt; &lt; No, &gt; Iron answered. &lt; Something that the entire Maximals crew \ncan take \n&gt; part in...but I need Prowl awake first.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
