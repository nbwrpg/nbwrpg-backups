He falls to the ground, \njumping up a second later. This was obvioustly not working, a different \nstrategy was in order. He jumps upwards, his jets activating again.\n\nDeathScythe bursts out of the canopy, flying after SnowCat above the trees. \nNow that there were no trees in his way, he was going much faster, and his \nscanners were locked on to SnowCat&#39;s signature. The assassin calmly flies \nabove the forest, following SnowCat.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus frowns as he runs by a large tree, stopping and looking back at it. \nIt was splashed with mechfluid and dented: something obvioustly crashed into \nit, something big. The Maximal checks his scanners. The bot he had been \nfollowing was flying again, and there was a second signature running in front \nof it.\n\nRamulus takes off at a gallop for the second signature, activating his \ncomm-link.\n\n&quot;New bot,&quot; he says into it, addressing SnowCat, &quot;What&#39;s your alliegence?&quot;\n\n"}}
