They sat up and\n&gt; nimbly climbed to their feet. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings soldiers of Unicron!&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice was rich and powerful\n&gt; as he regarded his progeny. &quot;You have awakened to a new world, a new\n&gt; universe. I am Cyclonus, herald of Unicron, Introduce yourselves!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The first to step forward was massive with weapons fairly ripping from\n&gt; his body. His most prominent features being the crimson cylinders of\n&gt; arm cannons that extended from massive red armored shoulders down past\n&gt; his elbows. While there are touches of red at his fore arms, hips and\n&gt; feet, the rest of his large form is dominated by gunmetal gray, with\n&gt; only highlights of yellow at his chest and face. &quot;I am DEEPSTRYKE&quot; he\n&gt; says, the deep bass of his voice reverberating across the area.\n&gt; &quot;Superior firepower wins battles, superior intellect wins wars.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The next to step forward was a female, tall and slender, she radiated a\n&gt; cold power and confidence. She like Deepstryke was predominantly red,\n&gt; especially across her torso, chest, hips and feet, but most of the rest\n&gt; of her was covered in an ebony black armor. Her face is framed by four\n&gt; fin-like projections sweeping back behind her head like some mask, and\n&gt; yet the look of her face is almost achingly beautiful to behold. &quot;I am\n&gt; PHOBIA.&quot; She smiled as she took her place behind the first. &quot;Your\n&gt; greatest fear is my greatest vice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The third to step forward is a truly dark soldier, colored in deep\n&gt; purple and black, his optics are almost furtive as he surveys the area.\n&gt; The twin boosters positioned above his shoulders, the nosecone on his\n&gt; chest as well as the wings that sprout from behind his shoulders and\n&gt; calves hint at his aerial alt-mode. He moved to stand to the other side\n&gt; of Deepstryke. &quot;I am NIGHTRAZOR.&quot; His voice was quiet, understated and\n&gt; calm as his optics focused on Cyclonus. &quot;Don&#39;t fear what you cannot\n&gt; see, fear what do not expect.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The next to step forward is another female robot, perhaps as tall as\n&gt; Phobia but not quite as smooth. She is wide shouldered and slim of hip,\n&gt; her armor is nearly all gunmetal gray, save for the items that betray\n&gt; her alt-mode. Large intake engines on her back, her face and a nosecone\n&gt; like assembly on her chest all display her aerial mode. At the top of\n&gt; her intake jet though open to display rather large speaker-like\n&gt; assemblies and the sound of her voice seemed to boom as much from them\n&gt; as from her mouth. &quot;I am DECIBEL.&quot; Her voice is powerful as it echoes\n&gt; over the landscape. She quirked a small smile as her voice while\n&gt; assuming a more reasonable volume was still powerful nonetheless, &quot;The\n&gt; sound of my music is death in your ears!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The last of the quintuplets to step forward was something like\n&gt; Deepstryke. While not as tall, he was thick and well armored. The large\n&gt; intake jets that made up his chest were a deep blue as well as the\n&gt; cranial guard of is helm, parts of his fore arms, his hips, his lower\n&gt; legs and his feet. On his shoulder a large silver/gray cannon is\n&gt; mounted and in his left hand is an equally vicious looking rifle. His\n&gt; steps are heavy and powerful as he took up his place behind the rest.\n&gt; &quot;I am TUMULT!&quot; His voice was that of a soldier, zealous and eager, \n&gt; &quot;The greater the fight, the more glorious the Victory!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the five complete their introductions they unison drop to one knee,\n&gt; &quot;We are yours to command Lord Cyclonus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus, who had been smiling up to this time frowned, &quot;You are\n&gt; warriors of UNICRON! Never forget that.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whatever you command Lord Cyclonus.&quot; They spoke once again in unison. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus continued to frown, unsure if his point was taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus turned to look at Remus, &quot;Through the defeat of your leader\n&gt; you have been granted a stay of execution, that stay is at an end -\n&gt; follow us no longer.&quot; Cyclonus glanced skywards, obviously about to\n&gt; take off.
