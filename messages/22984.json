Sorry man.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;With the exhaust filling the Corridors, we wont have to \nworry about \n&gt; them getting in here. Now, Tarantulas, get control of the internal \ndefences. \n&gt; They have the Autoguns, so I want the shields.&quot; Megatron said, \nleaning over \n&gt; his shoulder and looking into the computer monitor.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aracnia saw it first, then Gremlin, the exhaust. Together \nthey ran as \n&gt; fast as they could. Ahead of them they saw the double doors they \nneeded to \n&gt; get into, and with the crossfire of the Autoguns and gas, it was \nmaking it \n&gt; rather hard. &quot;Quick!&quot; Gremlin yelled, grasping the middle of the \ndoors and \n&gt; forcing them open.\n&gt;        She rolled in and then pulled him in. Behinde them, the \ndoors snapped \n&gt; shut. They coucged hard and looked at their arms. It was tarnished \nfrom the \n&gt; gas. \n&gt;        &quot;Alright, now what, cough coucgh.&quot; Gremlin said.\n&gt;        &quot;We go down.&quot; Aracnia said, and looking down she kicked a \npanle of the \n&gt; elevators floor down. Beneath it was a long dark shaft, slowly \nfilling with \n&gt; the green gas. Slowly.\n&gt;        Taking some web, she tied it to the ceiling above, and \nrepelled down \n&gt; the shaft, followed by Gremlin.\n\n\n"}}
