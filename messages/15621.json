Of course they didn&#39;t.\n\n&quot;Long as we&#39;re being civil&quot; he pressed a button and the tank drained \nthe cylinder he&#39;d been held in opened. &quot;Now then tell me about this \ngirlfriend of yours.&quot; The question was direct and to the point.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s keeping me from tearing you a new exhaust port?&quot; Lunarpine \nwas furious at the change he wanted to test his new body right then \nbut the fact that he didn&#39;t know a thing about the machinery Veratis \nused.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve told you a few times now about courtesy, I asked a question, it \nis very rude of you to answer back with another question. I&#39;ll \noverlook it this once, I can either save your friend or she can fade \ninto the matrix with the other nonfunctional bots from this useless \nwar.&quot; He&#39;d let Lunarpine rattle him and he fealt a little weak, &quot;Now \ntell me about her.&quot;\n\nLunarpine took the next hours answering questions and getting the \nanswers he needed. for now Shadow Wings spark was safe and as long as \nLunarpine answered the questions asked to the wolfbots surprise the \nquestions didn&#39;t involve security or weapons they involved \nindividuality. Beast modes and bots, not soldiers and leaders. the \nlonger the two talked the more Lunarpine thought that he&#39;d misjudged \nthis bot.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt an odd sensation pass over her.  It frightened her.  She \n&gt; felt like she had lost her connection to Lunarpine.  She couldn&#39;t \n&gt; feel his presence like she had before. That scared her beyond \nwords.  \n&gt; She felt alone now. Alone and helpless to do anything.  She prayed \nto \n&gt; the Matrix that Lunarpine was alright.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine nearly lost control when he heard the mention of Shadow \n&gt; &gt; Wings name. He&#39;d already gone through the pain of failing her now \n&gt; &gt; this madbot&#39;s reminding him. He punched the front of his \n&gt; cylindrical \n&gt; &gt; (I like big words) prison trying to escape. His hand ached as it \n&gt; &gt; struck the immovable surface. He glanced down at the hand. It was \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; hand that he used to strike with but it wasn&#39;t his. Lunarpine&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; senses flooded with the realization of what had happened in his \n&gt; &gt; stasis lock. Not only did he get experimented on, he&#39;d switched \n&gt; &gt; bodies which meant he no longer carried Shadow Wings Spark with \n&gt; &gt; him. &quot;You monster&quot; he howled ferociously glaring at the bot who&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; changed him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;So it finally sunk through your thick skull.&quot; Veratis \n&gt; answered &quot;But \n&gt; &gt; you still haven&#39;t answered my question.&quot; Veratis turned his back \nto \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine as if to taunt him &quot;I&#39;ll wager a guess that you two \nwere \n&gt; &gt; close, and that hers is the second spark in your old body. Am I \n&gt; &gt; right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t have to answer, Veratis had pieced together the \n&gt; &gt; equation nicely and both of them knew it. &quot;Yes, You&#39;re right she \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; dear to me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Good now that you&#39;re being so talkative you may ask a question.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis was back to his kind self showing courtesy even with \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine his prisoner instead of his guest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Where&#39;s my old body?&quot; Lunarpine asked, without power her Spark \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; surely leave the body.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s been...&quot;Veratis paused trying to find the right \nwords &quot;Taken \n&gt; &gt; care of.&quot; There was no easy way to tell someone that thier old \nbody \n&gt; &gt; was chopped up into samples.&quot;But I placed the other spark in a \nsafe \n&gt; &gt; place. I can help you my friend but you have to tell me exactly \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; I ask for.&quot; Again he had Lunarpines hands tied.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
