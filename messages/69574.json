Heavily armored and seemingly bristling cannon mounts as well as communications gear, it appeared that he could act both as a communications and observation station as well as an orbital cannon. \n\nActing in the former capacity, Legacy&#39;s powerful scans hit the old Maximal base, attempting to penetrate it and discern what is going on within even as he once again opened communications, &quot;This is unit Legacy, I have arrived at your location. Initial scans indicate some structural damage as well as loss of power. I am detecting, in addition to Maximal and a lone Autobot energy signature, at least one Minion energy signature and a possible second which at the moment is more elusive.&quot;\n\nLegacy assumed a parked position in the air above the base as he continued, &quot;How may I be of assistance?&quot;\n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\nPreston\n(Legacy)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
