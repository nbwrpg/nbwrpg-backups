He was almost dissapointed,\n&gt; for if he could have got the old Firestrike to understand, he could have\n&gt; a very powerful warrior, of both mind, and body. But right now he was\n&gt; more curious as to what was going on. Somebody had to have mettled with\n&gt; Firestrike&#39;s mind, otherwise he was badly dammaged to continued acting\n&gt; so strange. &quot;Enter the ship.&quot; He commanded, as he thought of how to deal\n&gt; with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
