He follows his comr=\r\nade&#39;s signature until he arrives \n&gt; &gt; at his side.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;About time you =\r\nlistened to reason.  Welcome back.  Oh, by the way, be \n&gt; &gt; prepared, Night=\r\nshift and Rat Trap may not be so accepting upon your \n&gt; &gt; return. Anyway, w=\r\ne have to find Nightlight and Darkhawk, who is really \n&gt; &gt; Windlord.  I sug=\r\ngest you find Nightlight, I find Windlord and we get the \n&gt; &gt; pit out of he=\r\nre as fast as we can.  If we get separated, meet me outside \n&gt; &gt; the fortre=\r\nss by the front fascade, you&#39;ll know who to look for, big, \n&gt; &gt; silver miss=\r\nile truck, that&#39;s me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside Rat Trap gets the com link.  And as =\r\nTucson Prime would have \n&gt; &gt; suspected, he blows his stack, upon hearing Ro=\r\ndimus&#39;s words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Grrrrrr!  WHERE THE PIT HAVE YA BEEN ALL THIS TIME =\r\nSPEEDY HUH?!  WORKN&#39; \n&gt; &gt; FOR HYDRAS WERE WE?!  ABOUT SLAGGN&#39; TIME YA SNAPP=\r\nED OUTA YOUR LITTLE \n&gt; &gt; TRANCE PAL!

C&#39;mon Quickstride, let&#39;s get back ta the=\r\n ark.  I feel better now that \n&gt; &gt; I blew off some much needed steam.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Tucson could hear Rat Trap through his com link.  He glances back to \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Rodimus one last time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Err, I&#39;ll - see what I can do to resolv=\r\ne this little issue.. Like I \n&gt; &gt; said, it could take some time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\ne then opens his com link to Rat Trap.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rat Trap, it&#39;s me, Tucson P=\r\nrime, I&#39;m all right little guy, and believe it \n&gt; &gt; or not, Rodimus is resp=\r\nonsible for my jailbreak.  We&#39;ll see you guys soon, \n&gt; &gt; okay?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat =\r\nTrap responds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You got it Wheels, I almost thought you were done =\r\nfor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In his cell, Nightshift joins up with Kup, and gets Rodimus&#39;s=\r\n com link \n&gt; &gt; too.  Like Rat Trap, he also shows some signs of being a sli=\r\nght displeased \n&gt; &gt; about his recent alliance with Hydras.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I wond=\r\ner how long this is gonna last before he falls for another one of \n&gt; &gt; Hydr=\r\na&#39;s scemes?  I dunno about you Kup, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, \n&gt; &gt; Tucso=\r\nn Prime&#39;s my leader.  This whole thing about Rodimus, still creeps me \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nout.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He replies to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nightshift here, I got the me=\r\nmmo. But unless you want me ta be cool with \n&gt; &gt; ya, ya gotta prove ta us t=\r\nhat ya ain&#39;t gonna slip through the cracks \n&gt; &gt; again, and is this some sor=\r\nta trick ta put us down even deeper?  I dunno \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus, but after this,=\r\n I kinda don&#39;t trust ya.  I&#39;ll do as told, I ain&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; gonna disobey, but =\r\nI&#39;m gonna run those orders through Tucson Prime first, \n&gt; &gt; since he&#39;s been=\r\n able ta resist this slag ball&#39;s scheme with no problem. \n&gt; &gt; He never quit=\r\n on you and I ain&#39;t never gonna quit on him.  This is \n&gt; &gt; Nightshift, peac=\r\ne out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He replies his last phrase with a cool tone of voice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Yeah right, two years he serves Hydras, and all of a sudden he&#39;s all \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; high&#39;n mighty again.  Yo, Tucson Prime, Nightshift here, what&#39;s the next=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; phase of the plan?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson catches Nightshift&#39;s com link.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nightlight and Windlord still need to be recovered.  Windlord goes by=\r\n the \n&gt; &gt; name of Darkhawk, and it may be difficult to snap him out of his =\r\nshell \n&gt; &gt; program.  I suggest you proceede with caution, and if you find D=\r\narkhawk \n&gt; &gt; before I do, contact me.  Don&#39;t try to handle him yourself, he=\r\n may be \n&gt; &gt; rather crafty.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gotchya.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime senses a cool tone in his comrade&#39;s voice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nig=\r\nhtshift, are you all right? You seem a bit disturbed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift r=\r\neplies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I dunno sir, I hate ta say this but I dunno if I can trus=\r\nt Rodimus after \n&gt; &gt; two years of him workn&#39; for the enemy.  I can&#39;t trust =\r\nsomeone who&#39;s turned \n&gt; &gt; his back on his faction, it just ain&#39;t right.  An=\r\nd now he acts all high&#39;n \n&gt; &gt; mighty.  What next?  He&#39;s gonna turn his spoi=\r\nler on us &#39;n really slag us \n&gt; &gt; good?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime sighs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;I was afraid of this.  Our return to the Ark is going to be a rocky one. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I think a conference will be in order once we get back.  One between a=\r\nll \n&gt; &gt; of us.  I know what you&#39;re feeling and I can&#39;t blame you for your \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; apprehensions, and neither can I blame Rat Trap for his. I too wonder w=\r\nhy \n&gt; &gt; and how, but we have to get past this and at least try to rebuild o=\r\nur \n&gt; &gt; alliance with Rodimus who is now trying hard to redeem himself.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift replies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;ll try.  But don&#39;t expect miracles.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson smiles gently.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thanks Nightshift.  I appreciate it=\r\n.  Now, do you have any stasis cuffs \n&gt; &gt; available?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift t=\r\nakes inventory of his restaint supplies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;One pair.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson=\r\n looks in his possession as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Same here.  All right, actually=\r\n if you do find Darkhawk, try and get the \n&gt; &gt; cuffs on him if you can.  Bu=\r\nt don&#39;t harm him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift salutes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Copy that, Peace o=\r\nut Tucson Prime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not long before Nightshift goes to his dutie=\r\ns, as Tucson Prime \n&gt; &gt; reaches Kup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Kup, I know you&#39;re good at k=\r\neeping the peace.  I have a feeling Rat Trap \n&gt; &gt; and Night Shift are still=\r\n a bit steamed off at Rodimus.
