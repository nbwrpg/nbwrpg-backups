Stay cloaked, keep together, and don&#39;t engage if \nyou don&#39;t have to.  Torin, you and I are going to start repairs.&quot;\n\n---\n\nPhoenix starts as the locking mechanism on her door snaps into \nplace.  If the Rogues locked her in, then they must be in greater \ntrouble than she&#39;d originally thought.\n\n---\n\nRiekan and Jayde pause outside the ship.  Riekan transforms to his \nvehicle mode, a largish hover transport.  &quot;Hop on,&quot; he instructs.\n\n&quot;I can get around on my own,&quot; Jayde retorts, &quot;and faster.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gatara said stick together,&quot; the larger Rogue points out.  &quot;And I \noutrank you.  Get on.&quot;\n\nJayde open her mouth to complain again, but thinks better of it.  \nSullenly, she clambers aboard, and the duo set off, shimmering and \ndisappearing as their personal cloaking devices kick in.\n\n\n"}}
