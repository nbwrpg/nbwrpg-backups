One of the protoforms must have gone offline. \nThen he saw the Maximal insignia on Mustex and knew he had lost the \nprotoform. Worse yet the new bot looked like a BABY, it had to be \nweak now, but it could be a formidable opponent in the future if it \nwent through the same gradual upgrades as humans. He wouldn&#39;t allow \nit to happen. HE was the maost powerful bot in the universe, and it \nwould stay that way. He transformed to dragon mode and spit fire at \nthe 2 bots...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOCHeres a start to the time travel thing, I got him back and set \nup the\n&gt; conflict, now you can control him for the battle then I&#39;ll bring \nhim back to\n&gt; the future to continue the story.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC Megaton flew across the Atlantic much like the Pilgrims will \none day do.\n&gt; He lands on the shore and devises a plan to delete his Predacessor \nMegatron.\n&gt; Two units with the tyrants personality were two to many but \naccording to the\n&gt; mutants math there was only one to destroy. transforming to his \nfreakish\n&gt; robot mode from his dragon form cut his size by four. he scanned \nthe area\n&gt; and found a hidden cave nearby. He needed rest and the cave would \noffer\n&gt; enough concealment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once inside the mutant found the cave paintings from a youth,  from \nwhat he\n&gt; could tell the youth was human, a tribe of the useless fleshy, weak\n&gt; creatures must have migrated away and left only thier paintings to \nshow they\n&gt; were ever there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton reached out and touched the wall, a sudden charge of energy \nforced\n&gt; the large bot away from the wall. He held up his hand and scanned \nit for an\n&gt; energy signature only to find nothing had happened to him. The \nscanns did\n&gt; reveal one oddity though. A thin layer of berries, sap, and mud had \ncoated\n&gt; his fingers. The wall paintings were wet like they were drawn an \nhour ago\n&gt; instead of  years past.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mutant exited the cave ansd scanned the world. two pods weren&#39;t \nfar\n&gt; away. The beast transformed to his T-Rex form and went to \ninvestigate. once\n&gt; nearby he detected animals, three of them. from the looks of things \nthere\n&gt; was a mother, father and baby. A mighty swing of the monsters tail \nremedied\n&gt; the family situation killing the mother (leaving the baby and \nfathers DNA to\n&gt; be replicated.) After the two creatures ran away he continued to \nthe pod\n&gt; where he saw Stallex and Mustex, they weren&#39;t bots he recognized.\n&gt; \n&gt; BOOC He&#39;s all yours dewboy, try to return him in the same condition \nthat you\n&gt; borrowed him in.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 2:11 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: angry\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry I recheked you got him.

A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resemblance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his former mode might exist through the DNA replication. This\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; open a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rivalry between him and a few bots in the game. (Necromancer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veratis,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton, just to name three.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future \ntemporal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anomaly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young but \nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened to him yet.
