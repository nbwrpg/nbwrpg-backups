It is much\nsmaller than Atlantis, but many would perhaps recognize the fauna\ngrowing here, the feel of this place harkening one back to the days\nbefore Atlantis was built. \n\nCool winds carry fresh fragrances over sandy beaches, reaching\ndelicately into gently swaying trees and brush. In the distance a tall\nmajestic mountain looms, like a king surveying its kingdom. With a mix\nof browns and greens it reaches up into the skies, clouds wreathing its\nsummit like a crown. \n\nIce blue waves brush against the large flat beach, as bright avian\nshapes dip into sun kissed ocean waters, emerging with flailing fish\nthat are promptly flipped into hungry beaks. Except for the fleeting\ncalls of these sea birds and the gentle lapping of the seas, all is\nsilent and tranquil here .....\n\n     .....\n\n.....until the sound of a powerful motor of a boat breaks the\ntranquility, and the birds flee into the skies screaming their ire at\nthe intrusion. Even as the ship touches land and its passengers\ndisembark, screaming horde of blue and white hunter-terminator sweep\nover the area, their passage disrupting the crystal beauty and subtle\npower of this place. In the center of this two figures, one purple and\nsilver, the other blue and white hover and land nearby the boat. \n\nAs quickly as they came the hunters turn and sweep high into the air.\n\n     -----------------------\n\nCyclonus and Scourge hovered for a moment as Sweeps gathered from thier\nquick survey of the island, all satisfied there are no unseen dangers.\nThey rise up and away, leaving Cyclonus and Scourge alone. \n\nCyclonus watched Rodimus carefully, assessing him as an opponant, even\nas Scourge�s watchful optics scanned the beach, nodding in\nsatisfaction: Yes this land was level and open, perfect for a battle.\n\nWith a gesture from Cyclonus, Scourge stepped back much as Remus has\ndone, ready to come to the aid of his commander, but not daring to\nintervene in this battle. Above and out to sea the Sweeps now keep\ntheir distance as well, they are predators watching prey and yet held\nat bay by the word and will of Cyclonus.\n\nCyclonus also is on the ground, his feet planted firmly in the\nsandiness of the beach, he stands opposite the one time Autobot\ncommander, his optics continuing to glow with some internal energy. \n\n�Now.� He says, his voice radiating a cold and pervasive confidence,\n�the battle begins! Prepare yourself� Giving Rodimus scarcely the time\nto set himself, Cyclonus raises his hand and fires a laser blast of\nsearing power!\n\nThe battle begins!\n\nOOC: As far as I know only Rodimus, Remus, Cyclonus and Scourge are\nhere. The sweeps are here also but are flying off shore, somewhere\nbetween Atlantis and the island.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet easy, one-click access to your favorites. \nMake Yahoo! your homepage.\nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n\n"}}
