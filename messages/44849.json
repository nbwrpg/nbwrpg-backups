My life is getting\n&gt;   &gt; busier, it isn&#39;t fun \n&gt;   &gt;   for me \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; anymore, and i have lost my creative drive.  Any\n&gt;   &gt; of you may email me \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; privately, whenever you want.  I would love to\n&gt;   &gt; keep in touch.  I \n&gt;   &gt;   will now \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; tell my history here, for those who don&#39;t know\n&gt;   &gt; me as well as others. \n&gt;   &gt;    One \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; day, a year and a half ago, i was on Ben Yee&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; message board.  I \n&gt;   &gt;   came across \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; a post talking about Neo beast Wars RPG.  I had\n&gt;   &gt; been looking to join \n&gt;   &gt;   an RPG, \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; but none of them interested me, until NBW.  When\n&gt;   &gt; i joined, it was \n&gt;   &gt;   just a \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; mailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of\n&gt;   &gt; the current list of \n&gt;   &gt;   members.  \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Eventually, we became part of egroups (now\n&gt;   &gt; Yahoogroups), and were \n&gt;   &gt;   able to \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; gain a much larger amount of members.  When i\n&gt;   &gt; joined, the council \n&gt;   &gt;   was \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Yanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, and Inferno371. \n&gt;   &gt; Soulstice was there \n&gt;   &gt;   too, then \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; being called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking.  The\n&gt;   &gt; Maximals were led \n&gt;   &gt;   by Liono \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Prime, the Predacons by Hellbeast.  The Alliance\n&gt;   &gt; was there, but it \n&gt;   &gt;   was far \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; smaller.  And so i began my long involvement.  I\n&gt;   &gt; saw the tide turn \n&gt;   &gt;   both ways \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; in the war, and small custom factions spring up\n&gt;   &gt; and then disapear.  \n&gt;   &gt;   I saw my \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; fair share of idiots (ahh Icedemon), but there\n&gt;   &gt; were also some great \n&gt;   &gt;   posters.  \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; There was Dachande who started the Destrons,\n&gt;   &gt; Logo, who had the \n&gt;   &gt;   hottest female \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; characters ever, my good friend shomin, with his\n&gt;   &gt; psycho \n&gt;   &gt;   religiousness, \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; carnagedarkness, with (his/her? not sure) long,\n&gt;   &gt; thinky posts with \n&gt;   &gt;   Dinobot, \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; and many others.  And let&#39;s not forget\n&gt;   &gt; Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only \n&gt;   &gt;   tragedy.  \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; For those of you who don&#39;t know, Minime\n&gt;   &gt; overdosed himself with \n&gt;   &gt;   pills.  To \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; make matters worse, that bastard JP beleived\n&gt;   &gt; that the tragic email \n&gt;   &gt;   by his \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; brother was fake.  Oh, and KSL, im not angry\n&gt;   &gt; that your characters \n&gt;   &gt;   murdered \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Soundwave, don&#39;t worry about it.  For those that\n&gt;   &gt; didn&#39;t like me, \n&gt;   &gt;   well then \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; good for you, but for my friends here, feel free\n&gt;   &gt; to talk to me \n&gt;   &gt;   whenever you \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; want.  I&#39;ll always remember Neo Beast Wars RPG.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Another turning point\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; A fork stuck in the road\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Time grabs you by the wrist\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt;  Directs you where to go\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; So make the best of this test and don&#39;t ask why\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; It&#39;s not a question but a lesson learned in time\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; But in the end is right\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; So take the photographs and stillframes in your\n&gt;   &gt; mind\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Tattoos of memories and deadskin on trial\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; For what it&#39;s worth it was worth all the while\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; But in the end is right\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; It&#39;s something unpredictable\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; But in the end is right\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I hope you had the time of your life\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; ~Alloran\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;    \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
