She is now the Predacon Commander and \norders had to be given. She looked to her group in the back.\n    &quot;Thunder Hammer, and Quickstrike, go outside and help take care of the \nDinobots. Darkmouse and Paralysis start the manual weponry and try to scare \noff the Maximals, if not killing them. As for Rampage and the Terricons, you \ncan go outside and help or get off my bridge!&quot; She yelled, taking the command \nchair.\n    Now in control, Black Aracnia took the floating keyboard and began to \nstart up the old rusty missle turrets. Paralysis climed into a small cockpit \nshape chaber with two large canon that he could use to blast away anyone \noutside the ship. He targeted the Dinobots and fired.\n    Aracnia typed in the sccess codes and off whissed three heat seeking \nmissles, intent on making that body heat dead cold.\n\n"}}
