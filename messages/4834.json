He would soon\n&gt;get his revenge on Unitron. He saw Battera waiting for him beside the\n&gt;chamber. Curious little bot. Won&#39;t wait for anything. He spoke to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Come with me to Terminess&#39; lab. I will tell you the plan there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois than sends a secret com link to Soundwave.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Go to Terminess&#39; lab. We have important things to discuss.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois starts walking towards the lab.\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Terminess smiled and stared at what she had found.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Excellent. The pod that I crashed in. The one I used to outwit\n&gt;Optimal Optimus. This will be a great start to our ship.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Being a termite, Terminess may carry more than 10x her body weight.\n&gt;She easily hauls the pod onto her back and begins walking towards the\n&gt;Pred base.\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Brocno laughed at Iron Raptor&#39;s transmision. He sent one back.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Fool! I have nothing left. No family, no love ones, nothing to live\n&gt;for. Dieing would just be another part of life. And if you do hunt me\n&gt;down, you will become enraged, leaving your judgement  impaired. And\n&gt;as you told me, the actual commanders of the Maximals are gone. With\n&gt;them gone and you insane, who would lead the Maximals? Who would\n&gt;protect them from the Preds? The answer is no one. They would lose\n&gt;and they would die! I will give you one more mega-cycle. But since\n&gt;you have not arrived, you do not get the full Octociz. Listen to\n&gt;this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Bronco pulled out a machine he had made from scrap parts of his ship\n&gt;while Octociz had been unconcios. He stuck to Octociz&#39; chest, and\n&gt;began pulling back on the handle. Octociz began screaming. So loud\n&gt;that it could be heard through the com-link. In a few moments, the\n&gt;shell of Octociz had gone limp and dead. Inside the device was a\n&gt;sphere, filled with all sorts of DNAand things like that.\n&gt;\n&gt;It was the spark of Octociz.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;He will only live for another mega-cycle like this, so you had\n&gt;better hurry. And no funny things, because this device is keeping him\n&gt;alive. I can pull the plug on him. See you in less than one mega-\n&gt;cycle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Bronco shoved the body of Octociz into the sea to be laid to rest\n&gt;with the Axalon. He laughed.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
