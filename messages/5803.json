He \nwaited until she was close sped up a little and called \nout, &quot;Maximize.&quot;The cry wasn&#39;t necessary but it fealt proper. A \nbattle cry that brought all the different animals in the Maximal army \ntogether. The wolf became bot again, turned and grabbed her talons, \npulling her down. &quot;Lesson one, make your prey come to your \nstrengths.&quot; With those last words Lunarpine transformed back to wolf \nand started in the other direction.&quot;By the way, you&#39;re still it.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She dipped and rose again in the air.  She kept up pretty well.  \nShe felt \n&gt; the predator in her rising to the surface.  She saw him as her \ntarget.  She \n&gt; beat her wings harder and came within a few feet of him.\n&gt; &quot;Oh I&#39;m beast enough all right.&quot;  She grinned. Her spark raced at \nthe \n&gt; challange.  She was about to touch him when a gust of wind caught \nher and \n&gt; she rose a little too high to touch him.  She beat wing and flew \nafter him.  \n&gt; She was having fun.  This was a test of her endurance and skill.  \nAt the \n&gt; same time, she was enjoying the freedom of it all.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;And when I tag you, your cooking dinner tonight.&quot; She knew that \naminals \n&gt; didn&#39;t cook thier food, but she wanted to rib him back a little.  \nShe wanted \n&gt; to see if he could take what he dished out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----Original Message----\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed Jul 5, 2000 7:43pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine knew Shadow Wing had the advantage in tne air, all he \ncould\n&gt; do to avoid her was stay in the high grass and trees, he tried to\n&gt; keep her upwind so he could smell her. She swept low, he moved to \nthe\n&gt; side, trying his damndest to stay ahead of her. In the wild the \nbeast\n&gt; had to stay ahead of the hunter, or end up lunch. Even though they\n&gt; were only playing, he had to be a wolf, in both actions and \nreactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Catch me if you can Wing, If you&#39;re beast enough.&quot; Lunarpine had to\n&gt; rattle her chains a little, if she couldn&#39;t handle a little ribbing\n&gt; then she couldn&#39;t handle a real fight. The soldier in him had to \nknow\n&gt; for sure who he could depend on when the firefight began.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
