He rolls to his feet, a heavy-fire rifle \nin his hands instead of his missile launcher as he comes up and fires \nthree shots back at Reflector.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;We&#39;re reentering the atmosphere,&quot; Grimmler says as he checks the \nscanners, &quot;There&#39;s a battle near the CF, as we already know.&quot;\n\nHis eyes narrow as an idea occurrs to him. A smile slowly creeps onto \nhis lips.\n\n&quot;Ok, Fliq, buckle up and don&#39;t hold on to anything,&quot; he says after \nrelaying his plan to Fliq, &quot;This is gonna be a ride from the Pit.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm frowns, looking back at Prowl. He knew there was a battle at \nthe CF, and he knew that the Maximals might need some help.\n\n&quot;Prowl, can&#39;t this wait?&quot; he asks over the comm, &quot;We might be needed \nat the CF.&quot;\n\nHe watches Prowl turn around and hears the owl-bot&#39;s voice replying \naffirmatively over the comm. Prowl&#39;s jetpack activates and quickly \nbrings him level with Firearm.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Prowl says, both of them heading for the CF at top speed.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (I haven&#39;t gotten around to posting the revised profiles of the new \nbodies of \n&gt; the three Brotherhood members below, but anyone who fought them at \nthe CF \n&gt; prior to this battle, you should notice Sun Crusher and Reflector \nare a \n&gt; couple feet taller and all of them look a lot meaner\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, someone post damage for the base.  If not Firefox, then \nplease IR since \n&gt; she be in command)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement watched the few Maximals gathering  together.  Like \ninsects.  About \n&gt; to be crushed under Vehement&#39;s foot.  But suddenly Vehement felt \nsick and he \n&gt; hurt all over has his optics unvoluntarily focused in on Hot Rod.\n&gt; \n&gt; The blood colored optic sensors turned to a light emerald almost \nimmediately \n&gt; and Vehement knew he was no longer under control of his own body, \nthough he \n&gt; could watch from his optics and feel his limbs and everything else \nmove, but \n&gt; he couldn&#39;t control, almost like a dream.  He knew it was divine \nintervention.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You,&quot; Vehement heard his own body say in a voice like his only a \ntad bit \n&gt; deeper as a finger pointed at Hot Rod, &quot;will fight me now.  And \ndie.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; An eight foot long broadsword appeared in Vehement&#39;s right hand, \nand he could \n&gt; feel his hand close around it tightly as rage that wasn&#39;t his began \nboiling.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher watched an enemy fire upon Reflector but turned back to \nIron \n&gt; Raptor.  He could feel something inside of her.  Something of \npower.  Though \n&gt; Vehement had been taken over, Sun Crusher could feel a voice in his \nmind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; /BRING IT TO ME/ &gt;, &lt; /DO NOT FAIL, FOR THAT WHICH I GIVE CAN BE \nTAKEN \n&gt; AWAY, DIPLOMACY OR FORCE, NONE MATTER, SIMPLY GET IT/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice hurt, but not as much as it had in his weaker body.  He \nlooked to \n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s chest with a glare.  He had to get whatever it was \nthat was \n&gt; beneath it.  His master knew, but the servant didn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You.&quot; he said, moving his glare to Iron Raptor&#39;s optics.  &quot;You \nwill give me \n&gt; what is in your chest.  The source of power.  The...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; /THE MATRIX/ &gt; the voice roared in his head, causing more pain.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Give me the Matrix, heathen scum, and we will leave for good and \nnever \n&gt; return to this unholy place.  On our word as servants of the Chaos-\nBringer.  \n&gt; If not, your bodies will rest at our feet battered and broken \nbeyond \n&gt; recognition and restoration.  The choice for you is the easy path, \nor the \n&gt; difficult path.  But you heathens lack hope and intensity.  Thou \nshalt not \n&gt; win unless you give us what we want.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector had been busy, but he still seen Kluster come out of the \nbattered \n&gt; base with a weapon of war.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heathen fool.&quot; he muttered under his breath, firing off a single \nbolt of \n&gt; optic energy at one missile, the other one impact with his chest \nplate.  He \n&gt; flipped back through the air a few feet, straightening out though.  \nIn his \n&gt; old body he thought, he&#39;d have drawn mech-fluid like a pathetic \nheathen.  But \n&gt; now he was strong.  Sadly, the weakest of his cadre.\n&gt; \n&gt; His despair had been replaced with a deep unfathomles emotion that \nseemed to \n&gt; be hate and a hunger for destruction, death, and total chaos.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised a wrist mounted with twin barrels, a barrage of sonic \nwaves \n&gt; launching out at Kluster&#39;s midsection.\n\n\n"}}
