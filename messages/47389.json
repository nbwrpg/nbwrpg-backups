He wanted to tell her something, so, still in \nflight, he reversed on his back, goes a bit lower and under Mistra.\n\nAzureBlade: This was a natural thing. But... there is something you \nmust know... about who I am... and what I feel like...\nI noticed you looked puzzled when I mentionned my brother, so I take \nit you do not know him. He and I were created by maximal scientists to \nhave sparks as unbreakable as that of Starscream, the legendary \nimmortal Decepticon. However, X turned... wrong. He began rampaging \nand eventually destroyed Colony Omicron. I was part of the team who \ncaught him, but I went berserk and killed my commander. We were both \nsentenced to be marooned by the Axalon, and I woke up here, on Earth. \nI am constantly avoiding to fight because of this. I am trying to \nattone for my sins, and I hope that one day, I will be forgiven.\nAs for what pushed me to rescue you... I can feel the emotions of \nsparks, and when I saw yours... (There seems to be a lump in his \nthroat) I found it beautiful! I did not want to mention it in front of \nKali... Mistra, I think I fell in love with you...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; AzureBlade thought for a moment, She was more lost than him when \nhe \n&gt; &gt; first came online.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: I see. (He starts flying) It could be a problem either \n&gt; &gt; with your memory chips or your spark. As I said, we have some fine \n&gt; &gt; engineers at the base who can help you.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra smiled gratefully at Azure, flying after him &quot;That sounds \nwonderful.&quot; \n&gt; It&#39;d be nice to eventually just who she was...but as she&#39;d said, her \npast was \n&gt; like a dream. One she&#39;d just woken up from. Maybe now was a \nchance...to start \n&gt; things over? Like life continuing once a dream has ended?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;He takes on some speed, flying out of the forest, but not too \nfast so \n&gt; &gt; he does not lose her.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Speeding up, Mistra flew beside him. After a moment&#39;s pause, she \nsaid &quot;Thank \n&gt; you Azure...for everything you&#39;ve done for me so far.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
