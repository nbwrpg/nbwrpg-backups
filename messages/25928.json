He started to\n&gt; boil up with fury. He turned around and stared down at Perplex.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perplex: I heard your whining as you ran.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Serge: (Mumbles something not understandable)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perplex: I&#39;ll give you a head start, RUN!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Serge just stood there looking at Perplex. Perplex raised his hand,\n&gt; showing the disk he was powering earlier. He started to make it grow\n&gt; larger and glow more brightly and pulsate faster. Serge walked slowly\n&gt; backwards.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perplex: Run faster than that if you value life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Serge continued to move slowly, planning to duck the disk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Clash flew along, wondering why he had been forced to\n&gt; run by those fools back there. His arm was growing back now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Clash: How could I, it isn&#39;t possible, I am the ultimate being, the\n&gt; SUPREME being, I am perfection, I can&#39;t be beaten! It&#39;s not right,\n&gt; what happened? A hex? SOmething, something, huh, huh...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (At the Cybertronian Fire)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos: Shokaract, you fool! We were ordered to cease fire! I&#39;ve\n&gt; got to get out of here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos flew off away from the battle, contacting Sharpedge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos: Sharpedge, you&#39;re in command of my position, I can&#39;t stand\n&gt; to be there anymore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tarantopulous looked around him. Maximals, still firing, worse than\n&gt; him even. Why do they act this way? It was only a cease fire?\n&gt; Tarantopulous pondered this. After all, as soon as the Maximals get\n&gt; their guy back, then they could fire again, right? They were just\n&gt; making things harder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tarantopulous (To Kluster): Sir, they are all still firing. This is\n&gt; suicide. You have shown me the light, and I am most certain that they\n&gt; are killing  themselves! I can&#39;t take this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that, Tarantopulous ran from the battle, catching the\n&gt; attention of Deemos on his way...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
