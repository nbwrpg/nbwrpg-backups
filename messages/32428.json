He opens his comm-link to ask Tantrum his \ncondition, but only static rewarded him again. He looks around, \nseeing that the Decepticons wern&#39;t faring well. Megatron hadn&#39;t said \nthat they should destroy the Maximals, just attack and not lost \ntroops. Soon, he knew that it would be time to go back to base.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gestalt_menasor@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Okay, now i&#39;m back for good.

The damage he had taken from Lavatrons kick finally caught \nup \n&gt; with him, and his chest armor was ripped and burnt thanks to the \n&gt; carefully placed missile, &quot;Ghhnn, let&#39;sss get ....&quot; his computer \n&gt; finished the sentence for him. &quot;Unit Tantrum seriously damaged, \nreturn \n&gt; to base&quot; it hummed. Tantrum went limp.\n\n\n"}}
