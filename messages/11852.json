Take your time. Also, if you like,  can have \nyou placed in your quarters with a medical droid to watch over you.&quot;\n\n    Paralysis looked at the virtual map and saw that several Allience members \nwere assulting the skeleton of the once proud, but now shattered Ark. He \nslammed his fist down and cursed.\n    Aerostreak, Gunatix, and Grappler sat on the bridge, learning a few \nthings from Paralysis. They were as shocked as he was.\n    &quot;Black Aracnia! The Allience is attacking the Ark!&quot;\n\n    Aracnia stormed out of Darkmouses room without saying goodbye. Right now \nshe had extreamly important matters to deal with. She ran down the corridor \nand into the bridge. She saw firsthand what was going on.\n    &quot;Well well, about time the Allience finally grows a backbone and dose \nsomething! Send a transmission to Darkone telling him that you, Aerostreak, \nGrappler, Adrax, and Autofire will be joining them. I will maintain things \nhere and join you. Quickstrike will man the computers. Also, Atma, Decadel, \nand Hibichi..er..whatever, will join you as well. Hurry!&quot; She ordered, \nlooking to her crew.\n\n"}}
