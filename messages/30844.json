But I just want to make sure he won&#39;t injure \nor hurt the others in the pack.  But, with his wild side, he may be a \nbigger asset than originally thought.  Let&#39;s get him to a CR so he \ncan recover fully.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sorry Logo you&#39;re about 5 posts late, by now you&#39;re leaping on the \nback of\n&gt; an unconscious bull.

Consider yourself lucky that he&#39;s mellowed \na lot\n&gt; since coming to this planet.&quot; She wanted to side with Bullet under \nthe\n&gt; circumstances but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to side against the \nmajority.\n\n\n\n"}}
