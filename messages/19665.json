She could feel her form moving and changing. \nIt was about 60% complete.  Her body was was becoming covered with \nsoft, white fur. Her wings were growing and were a soft gray that \nlighted up to white at the tips.  She stood there wondering why \nLunarpine hadn&#39;t come back for her. She leaned against the table and \nclosed her eyes. She tried to picture in her mind where Lunarpine \nwas. She could almost feel his presence, but not see him.  She tried \nto hear his thoughts, but couldn&#39;t.  She sighed and lowered her \nhead. &quot;I can not find him. I don&#39;t know why, but I can&#39;t connect with \nhim.&quot; She looked up at Veratis, sorrow was in her eyes.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis stared at the form before him. It was large and powerful. \nThe best\n&gt; part was that it still wasn&#39;t completely finished. &quot;Shadow Wing you \nare\n&gt; truly becoming a beautiful creature. So graceful yet so powerfull.&quot; \nHe was\n&gt; still astonished at what she turned out to be. &quot;Lunarpine still \nhasn&#39;t\n&gt; returned and I can&#39;t communicate with him.&quot; He was wondering if her\n&gt; telepathy was still there or if it had stopped with her \ncompletion.&quot; Do not\n&gt; worry my dear, everything will be fine.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
