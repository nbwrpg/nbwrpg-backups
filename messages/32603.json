He let his wings go limp causing \nhim to drop to dodge the last shot but it was to late and he was \nnailed directly in the chest knocking him 30 m back through the air \nspinning rapidly until regaining his balance and flying up higher \ninto the sky. His tail whipped up above his head and fired of two \nhighly explosive rockets down toward RazorClaw while simultaneosly \nfiring four missiles from his wings trained on the rockets and at the \nright angle to nail the rockets to explode just as they reach near \nRazorClaws position.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Razorclaw::\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorclaw dives to the right, feather missiles and machine gun fire \n&gt; pelting around and into him. He quickly raises raises his arms \n&gt; pointing one at Khonkolor and one at Halucigen, then fires four \n&gt; concussion blasts at each, though concentrating more on \n&gt; Halucigen.\n\n\n"}}
