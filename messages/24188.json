Ultra Magnus, an idiot.  Kup, a weakling with no leadership ability.  \nHa, all pathetic.  You were just last one left standing.  In fact, the Matrix \ndidn&#39;t even pick you now that my thoughts flow more clearly.  You only stole \nit from Galvatron.  And even then, when you were Rodimus Prime, you had the \nchance to defeat the Decepticons numerous time, but kept losing.  How \npathetic.&quot;\n\nUnitron leapt forward, sending a foot flinging out towards Hot Rod&#39;s face in \na jump kick.\n\n"}}
