He looks them all over, with an air=\r\n of concern to be sure they were not harmed.  And then spots the remaining =\r\npiece of dart in Nightshift&#39;s leg.  With careful, clawed fingers, Tucson re=\r\nmoves the fragment and subspaces it to bring back for examination.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I=\r\n assure you, whoever has done this to all of you, will eventually answer to=\r\n me and will served punishment  as deemed by me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He transforms into d=\r\nragon mode with Nightshift in hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Come, I can fly us all back to t=\r\nhe Ark.  I&#39;m sure Lord Elder would like a full report and I&#39;m sure Talon mu=\r\nst wonder where I&#39;ve flown off to.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He could not help but think of Tal=\r\non on the side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who specializes in illustration, using tr=\r\naditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts. =\r\n Great for any occasion!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Need a great gift idea that is original?  N=\r\no problem!

But so help me Primus, if they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have hurt him =\r\nor any other innocent Maximal or creature, I will serve them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their co=\r\nnsequences.

In other words, they were in deed here at one =\r\npoint, they\n&gt; &gt; appear to have left the area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However TUCSON&#39;s bel=\r\nlow can be heard by PERCEPTOR as he burrowed\n&gt; &gt; through the intervening ro=\r\nck, leading the other MAXIMALS safely out of\n&gt; &gt; the trap they had fallen i=\r\nn to. Also the digging could be heard by\n&gt; &gt; TUCSON&#39;s keen hearing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; It was only a few moments before both groups were uited at the front\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nof the cave opening as PERCEPTOR&#39;s digging finally brought NIGHTSHIFT\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd WINDLORD out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
