He got out of his CR Chamber and \nlooked around. He wanted someone to notice him so they would change \nhis programming. He had to become part of the the Alliance if he \nwanted to free Battera and Cybershark. He walked down the hall, not \ncaring if hew as picked up by any cameras. He went down to the \nquarters section, thinking some bots must be there. The ones he found \nwere the unexpected ones. He saw Cybershark standing there, talking \nto someone in their quarters. He was going to go up to him and demand \nto be made Alliance. He got a bit closer and over-heard his \nconversation. He wanted to escape! Maybe he wasn&#39;t under there \ninfluence after all! He had to take a chance. He went up to him, and \nsaw that it was Battera he was talking too.\n\n&quot;Cybershark. It&#39;s me, Vulois. I think I can help get you out of here!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq follow the others.\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\n(I gave him a cloaking device, whether he uses it is up to you.)\n\nPrebon acknowledges Slayer, and looks up to the top of the cliff and \nsees him.
