I\nhave\n&gt; had to add and detete a few programs on my computer and doing so has not\n&gt; been the best.\n&gt; Though, I am glad to see you are back steph.)\n&gt;\n&gt; ** Carnage listened easily to Instrat, wondering if she could trust a bot\n&gt; which had tried to rip her head off one moment and be totally calm the\nnext.\n&gt; It just didn&#39;t feel right.\n&gt; Carnage backed up a step.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; So, you just go around trying to kill people just because they&#39;re\nthere?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** She had lowered her gun but she could aim it towards Instrat and fire\n&gt; more quickly then amy bot could blink.\n&gt; But then Carnage caught Teltili&#39;s little action of a lunatic and a tiny\n&gt; smile crossed her face, thinking that only this woman could be this\n&gt; lighthearted at a time like this!\n&gt; Carnage simply shrugged before she looked back towards Instrat...just in\n&gt; time to see a rather large glob of something white and green drop from out\n&gt; of nowhere towards his head.\n&gt; She looked up and spotted a rather large raptor( bird of prey) sitting\njust\n&gt; above the bot.\n&gt; A wide smile crossed her lips before the she looked back towards Instrat,\n&gt; covering her mouth with one hand and the side of her gun as she tried to\n&gt; keep herself from laughing. Doing a very bad job at it.\n&gt; That was SO funny!\n&gt; Perfect timing!\n&gt; Carnage finally gave up and began laughing, shaking her head and waving\nher\n&gt; hand at Instrat.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry! I...was just thinking of something funny!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** Of course she wasn&#39;t about to tell Instrat that there was a squish of\n&gt; poop plumiting towards his head.\n&gt; That would ruin the extremely funny outcome.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
