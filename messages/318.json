She tryed a number of times but she couldn&#39;t manage to \ncatch a meal for her rumballing stomach!\nRage then looked up at the structure that sat a fair distance away and \nsighed, perhaps there was easier food there?\nShe got down to all fours and began to walk, her chest had begun to hurt \nfrom the waight of her back and walking on all fours helped ease it. She \nambled along, looking from left to right as she walked towards the metal \nstructure.\nPrehaps supper would be soon?*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
