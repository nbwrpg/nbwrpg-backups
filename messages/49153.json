You will stay here to guard the base. Shadow \nStar, you will command group Tripod, with you and Burrock. You will \nattack the most northern base (ooc: maxies). Talon and me, as group \nTrian, will attack the nearest one (ooc: preddies). Remember, this is \na hit and run. Our objectives are to pinpoint them and hit hard if \npossible. Break off the engagement at any signs of heavy defense. \nEveryone ready?\n\nBurrock: An attack already... I think I might like you, lightbird! Any \ncasualties allowed?\n\nTyrael: Just as long as its not one of you, the more, the better.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;black_ben14&quot; &lt;black_ben14@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooc:sorry guys this will be my last post.After that I would like \nrauq \n&gt; to take me out of NBWRPG.I&#39;m giving my chars to whoever wants them.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:~Naga~\n&gt; \n&gt; He checked the scanner and after a few moment he turns to Tyrael \n&quot;Sir \n&gt; the scanner have found 3 bases(the Decepticon dont seem so alive).\n\n\n\n"}}
