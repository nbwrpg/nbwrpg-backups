But for a\nmoment I thought I saw a few strange readings.&quot; He apsued for a moment\nand then continued, &quot;It was almost a mechanical from a small few in\ntheir numbers. And it wasn&#39;t  from that one that was floating above\nthem either. I can&#39;t explain it.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the Predacons take a rest having expended large\namounts of energy fending off the Dinosaurs.\n\nCYCLONUS looked over at HYDRAS, the very numbers of Dinosaurs having\nfallen all around them, the area above them was already starting to\nstink. &quot;What shall we do now?&quot;\n\nAbove the Predacon&#39;s heads ancient breeds of vultures were already\nbegining to circle, it would be a true feast for them.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a momentary confused look as CYCLONUS glanced at HYDRAS, &quot;Of\n&gt; course sir.&quot; he said as he opened a communication channel to the new\n&gt; Predacon base. &quot;Fractyl, what have you got?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Came the quick reply. &quot;As I was telling Lord Hydras, who ever\n&gt; that is out there, he is generating some sort of harmonic pulse and I\n&gt; believe that is what is controlling the beasts. If we can generate an\n&gt; inverse of that it should cancel it out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; CYCLONUS was nodding as FRACTYL talked his optics still wearing that\n&gt; confused look on his face. &quot;Begin transmission.&quot; was CYCLONNUS&#39; reply\n&gt; as he closed the communication.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes sir.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as FRACTYL closed his side of the connection the affect was\n&gt; almost immediate. The Predacons had been firing on the dinosaurs and\n&gt; killing them in large nubers, but they had barley put a dent in the\n&gt; larger wave of oncomming flesh.\n&gt;\n&gt; Howver once CYCLONUS gave the command the dinisaurs began to change.\n&gt; They began to stumble.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Frag!&quot; came a call over from SABERBACK, &quot;This is your doing, isn&#39;t it\n&gt; Predacon!&quot; That last word was said with disdain and venom.\n&gt;\n&gt; SABERBACK continued to float above the mob of creatures, but the nice\n&gt; orderly run was quickly degenerating into chaos as the creatures began\n&gt; to run in all different directions. They had once been all moving\n&gt; towards HYDRAS&#39; base, but now many of them were running away from it\n&gt; or in a different direction completely. Most of them were ignoring the\n&gt; Predacons, and those that didn&#39;t were easily dispatched by the\n&gt; Predacons themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You were more intelligent than I gave you credit.&quot; SABERBACK\n&gt; transmitted over the comlink to HYDRAS. &quot;I had imagined that you\n&gt; Predacons would freeze in fear.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the distance SABERBACK stopped moving and just gazed at HYDRAS a\n&gt; cruel humor on his face. &quot;No matter, I have what I needed. We shall\n&gt; meet again, oh yes count on it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; SABERBACK was still several miles from HYDRAS, but those with\n&gt; telescopic vision could still make out him pulling out a small device\n&gt; and him manipulating the controls. Then in a small shimmer, he\n&gt; vanished.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile all around the dinosaurs were still continuing to flee in a\n&gt; chaotic rush, no longer a real threat to the Predacons. There were a\n&gt; great many lying dead on the ground, some due to predacon firepower,\n&gt; but also many from being over used by SABERBACK and their bodies just\n&gt; giving out.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n"}}
