It was a fuzzor \n&gt; most of his body was a Quetzalcoatlus (one type of Pterosaur), but \n&gt; some parts of his beast mode body (like his back, chest and wings) \n&gt; had metallic green-blue feathers. His neck was extremely long, his \n&gt; slender jaws were toothless and its head was topped by a long, bony \n&gt; crest. \n&gt; \n&gt; The bot started to screech due the light and for few seconds he \ncover \n&gt; his eyes with his wings, but few minutes later he tried to escape \nand \n&gt; he accidentally cut with his craws one cable and that did that the \n&gt; lights turn off in half ship...
