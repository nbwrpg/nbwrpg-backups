Running out of the base \nand transforming to Gound Assult mode he went as fast as he could. Soon he \ncould see the signal, it was Hot Rod. He really couldn&#39;t belive it.\n    &quot;Hot Rod!&quot; Primal called out to him. But what would he say? That he \npicked up his signal for no reason, and that it was powerful? That would have \nto do. &quot;Hot Rod, are you carring anything very powerful with you? I picked \nsomething up.&quot; He said pulling up under him.\n\n"}}
