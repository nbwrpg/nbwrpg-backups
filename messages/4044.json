Why? You don&#39;t even know me?&quot;\nShe looked down at the ground.\n&quot;I thank you sacrificing yourself like that for me.  I don&#39;t remember if I \nwas in the forest or not.  I know I was reprogrammed.  I don&#39;t really \nremember anything before the reprogramming. I have a few images, feeling, \nabout some things and that&#39;s it.  Scorpanoc erased practically everything \nfrom my memory banks.&quot;\n\nShe looked at him and smiled slightly at him.\n&quot;I want to thank you again for risking your life for me.&quot;\nShe leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.\nShe just then realized what she did. Her optics grew very wide and she had \nan awestruck look on her face plates.\n&quot;Uh, I&#39;m sorry commander.  I don&#39;t know what came over me.  I won&#39;t let it \nhappen again.&quot;  Her face plates turned a deep shade of red. She turned and \nquickly walked down the hall to where Megatron was.\n\n----------Original Mesage----------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 12:45:16 EDT\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\n&quot;Ah sav&#39;d yer life,&quot; Quickstrike said to Dark Mouse. &quot;That&#39;s why ya owe me. \nAnd ah coulda died fer it.
