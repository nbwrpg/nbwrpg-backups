Transanulas, \nJackle, and Gremlin follow him. The see there pursuers, but dont really give \na fuck anymore. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast, slumping Mosquitor down in a corridor, goes into his private \nCR tank, while the others go in crew tanks. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Black Aracnia smiled as she waded deeper into the muck of the swamp. She \ncould easily see that there was a stasis pod sticking clear up through it. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Thanks to you....fembots will rule Cybertron!\n\n::: She floats the pod to the sore and drags it behinde her. Thankfully, this \nneck of the swamp was just a mile away from the Predacon base, which was in \nfull view. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia, activating the ramp to one of the cargo holds, drags the \nstasis pod into the dark room, and closes the ramp. :::\n\n::: Demona, her hand resting on her baster approaches. ::: About time.\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Shut up! It was hard enough to get this thing here. \nNow, get ready to transfer the phetus data.\n\n::: Demona inserts a wire from her temple into the main computer to the pod. \nBlack Aracnia pours over the data and then the transfer begins. A blue bar \nappears on the monitor, and it slowly fills with the transfer. :::\n\n::: Demona ::: This hurts.\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Your memory banks are being stressed, its supposed to \nhurt.\n\n::: After a slow hour, the bar fills, the wire is detached, and they both \nstand to see what comes out. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Scince your a T-rex, and hell Beast is a reptile...I \nwonder what its form will be...\n\n::: Demona ::: Is it to late to program it to be a Raptor?\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: No....is that what you want?\n\n:: Demona ::: Yes. Yes it is.\n\n::: Black Aracnia makes the changes and the lid pops open. Stryfe climbs out. \nHis jade eyes search the room and lock on Demona. :::\n\n::: Stryfe ::: Excellent. The data transfer was a success.\n\n::: Demona ::: Now all you have to do is kill Hell Beast and take the title!\n\n::: Strye was tall, strong, warrior like. His visable wepons included a sub \nmachine, optic lasers, and seeker missles. :::\n\n::: Stryfe ::: Lets go meet dad.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Marine lay streached on the table of Ominous Prime. Rescued from the tar \npits, he was vastly damaged and almost unrepairable. Now, he implated the \nfinal data chip in his banks. :::\n\n::: Marine&#39;s eyes lit up just as a flash of lighting broke the cold winters \nnight. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: The fembot, she shot me!\n\n::: Ominous ::: Fembot? Dosent matter now. Your repaired.\n\n::: Marine ::: Your an enemy to the Commander!\n\n::: Ominous ::: Oh yes. This war has brought out the worst in us. I saw you \nin distress and chose to help you. Is there anything wrong with that?\n\n::: Marine shook it off, got up, and looked around the freakish lair of the \nscientist. What caught his eye was the vat of liquid energon that the bot \nthrived on. :::\n\n::: Ominous ::: Now, your to weak to leave here now. Its the dead of winter \nand this is the Artic. Its 85&#39; below zero outside. Your mech would freeze. \n\n::: Marine ::: Then...your helping me?\n\n::: Ominous ::: Yes. Im sick of this pathetic war. When your recovered I will \ntake you to Hell Beast and we will leave the planet.\n\n::: Marine ::: Leave?\n\n::: Ominous ::: He has enough enegon, and his mission is complete. We would \nbenefit from it. \n\n::: Marine nodded. He longed for Cybertron, and the wa was getting out of \nhand. Departure seemed the only way. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron returned and climbed into a CR Tank. When he emerged he turned \nto Kitkat for a full report. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Kitkat, Report!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThat whole ark being saved is the biggest Bullshit I have ever seen in this \nRPG.\n\n"}}
