Demise&#39;s claws sink into Rampage, the impact destroying almost \nevery circuit in the lower half of Demise&#39;s body. The ice gives way, \nplunging the two bots into the ice-cold water below.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the firepower coming at him. He \nfires severam missiles at it, managing to take out the missiles that \nTankorr fired, and to set most of the bullets off course. He stumbles \nback as energy discharges and optic lasers hit him, his tentacles \nsparking. His armor was designed to reroute external energy to his \ntentacles, but this was more than he was used to.\n\nHis tentacles jerk uncontrollably, smoke rising out of his torso at \nthe amount of energy running through him. One of the tentacles hits \nthe ground, senidng electricity flowing through all the melted snow \noutward from EndBringer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther growls as Inferno bites him, spinning in the air to try and \nblock Paralysis&#39; shots with his attacker. He manages to block several \nof the shots, some of them hitting him in the back and sides. His \ncharge launcher falls from his hand down to the ground below, the \ntrigger stuck and the weapon madly firing charges.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Rampage growls, and also sees the cliff edge. It could be \nnow, or \n&gt; never. Rampage uses all his remaining strenght, and pushes Demise \ncloser and \n&gt; closer, all the while the injuries in his back leave a trail in the \nsnow. \n&gt; &quot;Shall we go together?&quot; He says, because with Demises claws dug \ninto his \n&gt; back, thier is no escape. So, with a final push, both bots tumble \ndown the \n&gt; cliff headed towrd the river of ice.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Paralysis has no time to notice the water before he is \nknocked several \n&gt; times from above. The left side of his face is no longer present, \nand his \n&gt; innards are exposed.\n&gt;        Inferno rams into Scather, and sinks his fangs into the bot, \nchowing \n&gt; down and holding him tight at the same time.\n&gt;        Paralysis, or what once was him, drew his pistol in the air \nand fired, \n&gt; meanwile the mech drizzled down his chest, legs, and on to the \nsnow. Now it \n&gt; appeared if the battle was taking place on a giant dalmation.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor was enraged beyond anything describable. Endgame was \na \n&gt; difficult opponent. Tankkor was now going to use a large sum of \nenergy, but \n&gt; it would be worth it.\n&gt;        Suddenly, Tannkors optic laser, missles, plasma discharges, \nand turret \n&gt; bullets unleased in a spectical of light. All headed at Endgame.\n\n\n"}}
