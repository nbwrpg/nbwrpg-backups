Zardus&#39;s second missile hits him, and he begins to feel his\nenergy draining quickly. Autofire growls, loosing altitude. His energy\nlevels begin to recharge as soon as he&#39;s out of the draining field.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSupernova scans behind himself, seeing Autofire off his tail. His\nscanners also detect Abominus forming.\n\n&quot;Form Galaxor!&quot; he orders his team, the jet that comprised him, Scrap,\nand Slasys splitting into seperate bots, the other jet flying for a\nlittle while and then splitting up as well. The bots fall toward the\nground, transforming into bodyparts and combining on the way.\n\nGalaxor lands on the ground, making it shake with his weight. He looks\nahead at Abominus, lifting the large missile launcher that was in his\nhand and firing two missiles at the other Gestalt.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Always will be Soulstice.\n&gt; \n&gt; :::Hun-Grr/Abominus:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Hun-Grr, seeing that the rest of his team had transformed,\ntransformed into \n&gt; the main body of the robot mode.
