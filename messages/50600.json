He was admiring the \nMaximal&#39;s design of the ship, they almost seemed perfect, yet flawed \nas well.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Eventually he found his way outside, he transformed to beast \nmode and started to wander the wilds. About a mile away from the ship \nhe noticed a bird flying overhead, he did a quick scan and found that \nit had a Maximal signal*. So Vampirtron ran into a field and let out \na deep, long howl. After that he transformed to robot mode, and stood \nwith one knee on a big rock, watching the bird, to see if it would \nland.\n&gt; \n&gt; (*The signal is Condor)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; HotJobs, a Yahoo! service - Search Thousands of New Jobs\n\n\n"}}
