She scanned the \n&gt; area but couldn&#39;t get a reading.  She had snow piled up on her.  \nShe \n&gt; was nervous.  She wondered if she could even take this bot who was \n&gt; following her. She heard footsteps in the snow.  The bot was \ngetting \n&gt; closer.  Soon he would be right on top of her.  She held perfectly \n&gt; still.  She waited until he was right next to her.  She jumped up \nand \n&gt; aimed her gun right in his face. &quot;HOLD IT YOU!...&quot; she froze.  She \n&gt; saw Lunarpine standing there. &quot;What in the Matrix are you doing \n&gt; here?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The snow had gotten worse, even though the hail had nearly \nstopped, \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine&#39;s senses were on full, his nose to the ground. most \n&gt; scents \n&gt; &gt; were buried beneath the snow. He&#39;d lost the predicons scent a \nwhile \n&gt; &gt; back. The cold didn&#39;t bother him, being from the arctic north \n&gt; &gt; helped. &quot;A storm like this isn&#39;t normal anywhere.&quot; he thought, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; hot jungle below, would be destroyed by such a climate change.\n&gt; &gt; (Another temporal distortion perhaps.) Again he opened his comm \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; to get static. His senses weren&#39;t reliable around here so he \n&gt; &gt; transformed to bot and continued his search for Shadow Wing. For \n&gt; some reason he couldn&#39;t shake the fealing he was being watched.\n\n\n"}}
