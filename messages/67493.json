Never in his life had he feared losing control as he did\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; then.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I am honestly unsure how many of the Dragon Corp there ar=\r\ne, nor\n&gt; thier speed capabilities. Also I can only assume that since no one=\r\n\n&gt; responded before when I was verifying positions, everyone save for\n&gt; Cyc=\r\nlonus, Scourge, Rodimus, Remus, and the sweeps was still at Atlantis\n&gt; duri=\r\nng the battle??? Which would mean that all would have some distance\n&gt; to ma=\r\nke up before they would catch up with Cyc. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also I am having to assume=\r\n that Cyclonus and crew are being shot at\n&gt; BEFORE they fade from visual ra=\r\nnge, but they are moving fast. Cyc is\n&gt; not going to hang around. So please=\r\n consider my responses an amending\n&gt; of my last post.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; In =\r\nthe air, the fading from view but not quite gone Cyclonus is moving\n&gt; swift=\r\nly through the air. His body is digesting the new power it has\n&gt; recieved a=\r\nnd is enjoying it. Power flows through his circuits as his\n&gt; own systems me=\r\nrge with the now corrupted power of the matrix. His form\n&gt; seems to radiate=\r\n a new power, his fusion powered engines thrusting him\n&gt; foward at amazing =\r\nspeeds. He knew he would be able to hold this new\n&gt; power, his instructions=\r\n from Unicron had said as much, but the sheer\n&gt; power was almost intoxicati=\r\nng. Internally he smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was then that bullets from a gatling gun =\r\ncaught up with him, lightly\n&gt; scored his armor and then fell behind as the =\r\nCyclonus whipped foward!\n&gt; It was not that the guns lacked power, but simpl=\r\ny the speed that these\n&gt; ships were flying and the distance they were away,=\r\n by the time the\n&gt; bullets caught up they were as pebbles striking titanium=\r\n shields. \n&gt; \n&gt; Howerever Cyclonus did have a response as twin missiles err=\r\nupted from\n&gt; beneath his wings. For a moment the missiles seemed to hover \n=\r\n&gt; as they changed direction orienting on thier target. Then they burst\n&gt; in=\r\nto explosive movement, glowing with encapselated power. Rather then\n&gt; missi=\r\nles with flame behind them as Cyclonus&#39; missiles looked before,\n&gt; they were=\r\n now like twin suns as they fairly irradiated power and\n&gt; destruction as th=\r\ney moved toward the source of the bullets: \n&gt; \n&gt; As the missiles streak pas=\r\nsed, the sweeps fall in behind Cyclonus and\n&gt; Scourge, forming a protective=\r\n shield as they pick up speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the moment Remus is ignored as the =\r\nUnicronians moved foward,\n&gt; picking up speed!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n_______________________________________________________________=\r\n_____________________\n&gt; Be a better pen pal. \n&gt; Text or chat with friends i=\r\nnside Yahoo!
