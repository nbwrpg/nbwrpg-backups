The first being you posted for a \nfactions defenses and such when that is not allowed. You can make \nthings from a base pop up and fire at your char. Next the Alliance \nbase or the Infecticon base would have detected Mustex long before he \ngot on the island. Having your one bot single hadndidly dismantel the \nAlliance base is heavy godmoding and such. Ugh I wish the council was \nhere right now but most of it is gone... Perhaps we should all make a \ntemporary council until everyone gets back? Rauq gets back this \nsunbday but alot can happen in one day, such as Kyles post.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Eh?
