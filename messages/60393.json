He heard stories \nabout the Autobots defeating Unicron and his minions, so he wanted to \nsee how their decendants handled new and improved minions.\n\nUnicron&#39;s final minion strode through the insids of the Chaosbringer, \nbored.  She entered a chamber where the Sweeps stayed.  SHe, being \nthe new Sweep commander, was met with the Sweeps standing at \nattention as she walked past them.  She reached the other end of the \nroom and sat in a throne like seat.  She looked on over her hunters, \na smile upon her lips.\n&quot;As you were.&quot;\nAs the Sweeps returned to doing whatever they were a moment ago, the \nSweep commander activated a viewscreen.  On it the locations of her \nfive brethren appeared, and she watched over them, in case she \nactually needed to help.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No yet but be ready&quot;said cooly the femme&quot;We must to be patient if \n&gt; we like to strike in the right moment&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;The Ultimate Archfiend of Darkness, \n&gt; Devouring&quot; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Necross/ Splattercannon/ ????:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Transmission confirmed,&quot; Splattercannon responded, picking up on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; two Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Alright then.
