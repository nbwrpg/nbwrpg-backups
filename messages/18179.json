There is no main moderator. Power is \nspilt evenly among the council. Nobody does anything without everyone \ngoing for it. What you are saying is that you are basically in charge \nof the RPG, and Yanshosh and JP and whoever else is on the council \nare just your minions making smaller decisions. If you are going to \nbe saying that you have the power and if you are going to keep \nnagging to everyone about little rules, than I would be the first to \nplace my vote to get you off the council. I&#39;m sure there are others \nwho agree with me. If there are not, than I will be quiet. But I&#39;m \nnot going to just shut up and let you take control.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois&#39; face lit up with a smile.\n\n&quot;I would do anything to get back to Cybertron. It&#39;s better than \nliving here.&quot; He looked to Cybershark, &quot;Are you up to it?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream found Inferno and another bot talking. He decided to stay \nabove them until Drillbit arrived. No sense in going two on one. \nMaybe they could take them both back.\n\n\n"}}
