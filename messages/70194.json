He senses an interruption in sonar signal and quickly \n&gt; realizes that someone is able to fight it.  He switches it off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Right, Kup, Rodimus, you take Nightlight out of here ASAP. Meet up with \n&gt; Quickstride and Rat Trap and go as fast as you can back to the Ark. \n&gt; Nightshift, since you&#39;re small enough and fast on your feet, due to \n&gt; Ninjabot training, I need you to seize Darkhawk, and put him in temporary \n&gt; stasis until we can reverse his shell program back to Windlord.  Try not \n&gt; to damage him, just subdue him.  Once you do that, rejoin everyone back at \n&gt; the Ark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift salutes his leader.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Got it, but what about you?  What&#39;s your game plan?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Someone has to back you up and divert enemy fire away from his comrades. \n&gt; It might as well be me.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift&#39;s optics widen.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But, slag, that&#39;s one hell of a risk...  Look at what you&#39;re gon&#39; up \n&gt; against...  I dunno, I think ya better have Rodimus back ya up.  He&#39;s an A \n&gt; class gunner and you&#39;re gonna need all the gunn&#39;n you can get.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, Change of plan.  Nightshift&#39;s right.  I shouldn&#39;t try to do this \n&gt; alone.  And I know you wish to redeem yourself faithfully.  Well, this is \n&gt; where we begin.  I trust you&#39;ll be able to handle this with ease.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He alligns his missile launchers in anticipation of a shoot out.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; So, Hydras wants a fight, he&#39;s just got himself one.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight/kup/Darkhawk/perceptor/Hydras.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hdyras and perceptor started to recover; in other room Darkhawk felt an\n&gt;&gt; unverable pain.

Nightlight moaned with pain.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hydras and Perceptor Screamed in pain.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime looked over at Tuscon and then at the others as the wave\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of sensation swept over him. He could see the jerks of pain from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scorponok and Darkhawk as they fell down in pain, while the Autobots\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and Maximals seemed to be struggling to hold back the laughter, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then he felt it too. it was a wave of warmth that seemed to vibrate at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his relays, causing him to jerk slightly as he smiled and held himself\n&gt;&gt; &gt; silent.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However something was different with Scourge. He felt the wave pass\n&gt;&gt; &gt; over him, and like a wave of pain he staggered back a step, but it was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not enough to bring him to his knees.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scorponok glanced at Scourge with pain filled optics, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pain?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scourge glanced at him and then back at the Autobots, &quot;Because I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not built as a Decepticon but Unicronian, we are superior.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scourge tapped his radio as he held up his weapon defensively,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; realizing that at the moment it was only he against the Autobots as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his &#39;back up&#39; was on the ground. &quot;Sir!&quot; Scourge sent to Hydras and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, &quot;Tuscon is doing that wave thing again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ******************************************************\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Who: CYCLONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, NIGHTRAZOR, Hydras, Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Location: Black Fortress - Hallways\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Not far away, Cyclonus got the call and looked down as Hydras and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor were also down in pain, &quot;We are having the same effect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; here.&quot; Cyclonus said, as he like the other Unicronian based\n&gt;&gt; &gt; transformers could feel the wave, but its affects were far less\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pronounced and a lot easier to ignore.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Phobia looked at Hydras as she spoke to the others, &quot;I thought Hydras\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was Galvatron also? His Unicronian design should protect him like us?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; she looked confused and almost genuinely concerned.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus nodded, &quot;He is, but I believe that in taking on the Megatron\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spark and his more . . . um . . . terrestrial form, that he has become\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more Decepticon than we.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus gestured at Nightrazor, &quot;Use your noise cancellation field to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; negate this until we can figure out a better solution.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightrazor nodded as he began to cancel out the effects of the sonar.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As sonar is basically an operation of sound, Nightrazor begins\n&gt;&gt; &gt; generating a type of white noise to directly cancel out its affects.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is typically used to keep his movements quiet or to catch a foe\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at unawares, however this application of it was easily within his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; capabilities.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus nodded as he gestured to the others, &quot;Nightrazor, stay with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor and Hydras, it may take them a few moments to recover, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; they may need your field until this ends.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightrazor nodded as he stood close to Hydras and Perceptor, tying to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; keep the field up.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus straightened, &quot;Computer!&quot; he said as he looked around.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Working.&quot; said the cool computer voice.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Open fire on all Maximal and Autobot energy signatures.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; the computer voice came back, as internal gun units\n&gt;&gt; &gt; once again oriented on the Maximal and Autobot group and opened up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; again on Tuscon and his group!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Come!&quot; Cyclonus said to Phobia and Deepstryke, &quot;It is time to end\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this. Hydras will join us when he recovers.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cyclonus, Deepstryke and Phobia jogged down the hall towards the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Autobots and Maximals leaving Hydras and Perceptor to recover under\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the protection of Nightrazor&#39;s field.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
