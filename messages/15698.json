The Alliance would move into the Iron Fist, and then, \nfrom their new, more secure base of operations, they could function more \nefficiently. With superior scanning and state-of-the-art Predacon technology, \nthe Iron Fist would be a great asset...\n\nZardus glances down at his wrist comp, now connected to the main computer of \nthe Iron Fist as well as the Alliance base, looking at the scanners. The Iron \nFist&#39;s scanners reported that a location beakon had been picked up, \nobvioustly from a new bot on the planet (That&#39;s you, Thrash).\n\nZardus absently holds on to the nearest chair as the shuttle makes a landing \nat the Alliance base, stopping several feet from Reptilica and Starscream. \nZardus taps a few buttons on a console, walking toward the door.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica spins around as he is showered by dirt and rocks, looking at the \nshuttle and turning his head to the hatch as it opens, Zardus calmly walking \nout.\n\n&quot;Reptilica, a new bot has sent a location beacon. I&#39;ve programmed the shuttle \nto track him and go to him. Can you go with the shuttle and recruit this new \nbot? I think his energy signature is Predacon.&quot;\n\nReptilica nods. &quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; he says, walking into the shuttle, the hatch \nclosing behind him. The shuttle lifts off vertically, hovering for a few \nseconds before zooming off, showering the bots on the ground with more dirt \nand leaves.\n\nZardus turns to Starscream. &quot;Reptilica said that you wanted to talk to me \nabout something?&quot;\n\n"}}
