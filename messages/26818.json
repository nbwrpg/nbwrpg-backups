The boosters weren&#39;t \n&gt; strong enough to be any good in earth gravity, but they were perfect \n&gt; for space.\n&gt; \n&gt; He watches Astroblast avoid the LA2, seeing Koj on top of it. Aiming \n&gt; his EMP cannon, he fires at Koj.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What exactly are we looking for here?&quot; he asks Motormaster as he \n&gt; fires again.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Koj&#39;s eyes widen in surprise as an EMP shot hits his feet, making him \n&gt; lose the grip on the LA2 and fall off. He spins around, heading for \n&gt; Killfest with his sword ready.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; EndBringer exits behind Killfest, similar boosters emerging from his \n&gt; back, below his tentacles. Two missile launchers flip out of his \n&gt; shoulders, firing at Koj. Koj ducks under, but the missiles circle \n&gt; back, heading for their target again.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The LA2 shakes as shots hit the top and sides of it, blowing off a \n&gt; few panels.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Stay in the ship, Dark, I&#39;m going out to fight,&quot; Liono tells his \n&gt; brother, opening a hatch and jumping out, firing three shots at \n&gt; Motormaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the LA2&#39;s top smoking from the hit, Dark aims the cannons, \n&gt; firing at Astroblast again.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The stasis pods containing Key, Riona, and BlueStinger exit the \n&gt; atmosphere, heading for the Ark.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; With a flash, Scyther&#39;s shuttle exits transwarp, several dozen miles \n&gt; away from the Ark. He checks the scanners, seeing that Killfest was \n&gt; in a battle nearby.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah, it seems like we get our first battle,&quot; he says to the two other \n&gt; bots in the shuttle while he manuevers it closer to the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; Incarcinator, one of the other bots in the shuttle with Scyther, \n&gt; stands up. He was about a dozen feet tall, and the material that his \n&gt; body consisted of was translucent, so he was a bit seethrough. He \n&gt; smiles. &quot;Excellent. Out of prison and already slaggin&#39; bots!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Incarcinator takes out a large rifle from his back compartment. The \n&gt; rifle was a mean looking weapon, with many attachments on it. It was \n&gt; made of the same material as Incarcinator. With a silent command from \n&gt; the bot, Incarcinator&#39;s armor slowly turns completely black. He waits \n&gt; for them to get to the battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Yanshosh, would Motormaster&#39;s wounds be healed yet?
