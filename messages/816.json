She looked around and saw\nGangon\n&gt; trying to dig a hole under the Maximal base and then looked back at\n&gt; Tavatron, Gangon was her partner...she just couldn&#39;t abandon him!\n&gt; BrightBlade suddenly shot 4 charges in a row at Tavatron and then hopped\n&gt; down from the boulder, she kept firing at the boulder as she backed up\n&gt; towards Gangon. Finally she bumped into her partner and snarled down to\n&gt; him...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; There&#39;s an extra energy charge in my back compartment, I was saving it\nfor\n&gt; an emergency...this seems like a good enough one to me. Take it. It isn&#39;t\n&gt; much but it&#39;ll get you through the battle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She continued to fire upon the boulder as she opened her compartment so\n&gt; that Gangon could get to the energy reserve, she knew that he was her\n&gt; partner and her only real friend. It would be a shame and a waste if he\nwas\n&gt; to die now.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt;\n&gt; * Rage snarled in fright as she backed away from Scourge, this was so\n&gt; strange and scary! How could that attack do this to her, turn her into one\n&gt; of them?\n&gt; She was shaking a little from the shock of it all, how could this have\n&gt; happened? And what scared her even more was that she was beginning to\n&gt; understand the sounds that came from her attacker, beginning to understand\n&gt; his language!\n&gt; Rage snarled again, what was she going to do?\n&gt; She slowly got to her feet and stood in front of the Predacon, she was a\nbit\n&gt; unsteady but she was able to keep her balance.\n&gt; A question formed in her mind as she looked at Scourge with her grey\noptics,\n&gt; even sooner the question formed on her lips...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Who...who... you?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her voice was soft at that moment, no louder then a whisp of wind and\n&gt; twice as smooth. It wasn&#39;t the loud roar that she was used to but it was\nall\n&gt; she could make right now, and even though she could speak she still had\nmuch\n&gt; to learn about putting together a proper sentence.\n&gt; Rage looked at Scourge from head to foot, he was rather a big male and\n&gt; almost seemed to have a dominating environment around him.\n&gt; She almost seemed intimidated by him, but she wasn&#39;t about to show any\nsigns\n&gt; of submission yet.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving\n&gt; more each month?
