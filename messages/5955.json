Earth made a simple mistake, he skimmed through my mail. \nI don&#39;t \n&gt; mind that he returned to base, but he is not in control, yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Your services are welcome here Destrocons. I will allow you to \nchoose \n&gt; your quarters. They are down that hall and to the right.&quot; Magmatron \nsaid.\n&gt;     &quot;Now for Bobertron.&quot; He said as he saw them. &quot;Greeting \nBobertron. I am \n&gt; glad to see that you have returned to base. I will be away for a \nlittle while \n&gt; and I wish for you to run the base. There is an encoded message for \nyou in \n&gt; the event of my death. It will only be accessed if I am offline for \ngood. \n&gt; Good luck in running the Destrons.&quot;\n&gt;     He took his leave. Transforming to Beast Mode he flew to the \nIron Fist. \n&gt; He transformed to Robot mode. He starts to bring about a main \nweapon. An \n&gt; energy blast. It would no way destroy the ship, or even dent it, \nbut it would \n&gt; serve his purposes.\n&gt;     &quot;Iron Fist, I can destroy the ship. And I will destroy it if \nyou don&#39;t \n&gt; surrender utterly to me.&quot; Magmatron said. He knew that a bug was on \nhim, he \n&gt; also knew that it might help him.\n\n\n"}}
