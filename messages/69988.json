It was what he hoped to hear. Deep down he was hoping that somewhere a=\r\nlong the line someone like Nightstrike could turn over a new leaf. She was =\r\nproof of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Talon, I&#39;m actually happy you told me this. It actually=\r\n assures me that my intentions aren&#39;t as crazy as I thought they may seem. =\r\nRemember when we were fighting Nightstrike? How skilled he appeared to be? =\r\nHe gave us a run for our money, mainly me, but there was sheer talent in hi=\r\ns approach, sheer talent that would not have been at all recognized if I ha=\r\ndn&#39;t encountered him. I don&#39;t think Unicron would have ever appreciated him=\r\n for that, instead, he uses him as a puppet to do his dirty work, not at al=\r\nl giving him recognition for his efforts. And what does he do when they fai=\r\nl? Disposes of them. But what if someone else, who he thought was an enemy,=\r\n actually turned out to be a friend? You&#39;ve proven that it can happen, see?=\r\n It doesn&#39;t change how I feel about you. So, this time, I&#39;d like to try a d=\r\nifferent approach with Nightstrike. I&#39;d like you to be with me as well as D=\r\nepthcharge and the others, because I want them to see the same thing. If we=\r\n show compassion to those who are otherwise cast asside, because they aren&#39;=\r\nt good enough, we can make friends out of enemies. Okay, let&#39;s go see if th=\r\nis works. It might not.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He escorts Talon outside, holding her hand.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Okay guys, sorry about that.. I had a slow leak in two tires and I had=\r\n a heck of a time finding spares.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thought so. K=\r\ninda is hard ta find tires for a big guy like you.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson now looks =\r\nto the others as he also transmits to Lord Elder.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; First, I&#39;m also tr=\r\nansmitting to Lord Elder and Kup, and guys, sorry about earlier, I didn&#39;t m=\r\nean to scare you. Okay, everyone, this is what I hope to accomplish.. Night=\r\nstrike may be a minion, but Unicron doesn&#39;t value his minions like we value=\r\n each other. I doubt he&#39;s ever been shown appreciation for his talents and =\r\nabilities. And I have a feeling he&#39;s been given false promises. I&#39;d like to=\r\n try and talk to him, on a neutral basis, because even though he doesn&#39;t wo=\r\nrk for Hydras, he may just have some understanding about Predacon technolog=\r\ny that may come in handy if Night Shift isn&#39;t able to get the information o=\r\nn his end, due to the level of risk he&#39;s taking. I don&#39;t want him to go ove=\r\nr his head on something. If he needs to abandon the mission, please, inform=\r\n him that I have nothing against it. In fact, I hope he realizes when it do=\r\nes become too dangerous to pull out. So this way, if he can&#39;t get it, at le=\r\nast I might have a chance to get it on my end. I&#39;m begining to think that m=\r\naybe I may have to resort to plan B after all.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap swallows.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot; So, Night Shift might not make it?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson shakes his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nI highly doubt it. It was a very risky proposition and I don&#39;t know why I e=\r\nven let him do it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap salutes Tucson Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Tucson Prime=\r\n, I hereby volunteer my little rat aft ta a call of dangerous rescue duty. =\r\nIf I got ya outa there before I can do it for Night Shift.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson loo=\r\nks to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t ask you to do that Rat Trap. You almost lost your =\r\nlife back there, I can&#39;t have that hang over my head, absolutely not. We&#39;ll=\r\n see how it plays out. He may be able to get out of there, but if he puts i=\r\nn a distress call, I&#39;ll assemble a rescue team for the job. All right, let&#39;=\r\ns do this.
