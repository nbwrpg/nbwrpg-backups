Koj takes the ball and crushes it swiftly releasing a quick \ncolorless strong odor as he spins his lance extreme fast blowing it towards \nin Lunarpine. ((The odor will mess with everyones nose in the area it will \nmake your eyes water and nose if you have one burn like its on fire locking \nout any scent but spicy peppers.))Koj nose burns but he forgets the feeling \nas he enters battle mode his armor closes of all access to his joints for \nprotection &quot;Lunarpine if so much as try and smell me or Inu, I&#39;ll remove \nF**king nose!&quot; Koj thrust the lance into the ground to let him know this is \nno joke.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
