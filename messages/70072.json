Well, until Hydras sends his=\r\n goons out ta find us which is probably what&#39;ll happen.... Ooohh, bean pods=\r\n...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again he thinks of nothing but food and begins to munch on th=\r\ne bean pods.

I=\r\n will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not risk anyone elses lives here this day. Jhiaxus, you hav=\r\ne my word. All \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weapons are powered down and we will abide by Hydr=\r\nas&#39; commands.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Night Shift was not angry at his leader.

He&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; risked his spark=\r\n ta try&#39;n get ya back. That&#39;s right, he didn&#39;t come here \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for some=\r\n half baked power trip, he came back here because he really cares \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n about you. The least you can do, is return the favor&#39;n make some sorta \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effort ta come around&#39;n try and remember who you are, and what you s=\r\ntand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for. Because right now, I&#39;m just gonna have ta call ya Hot R=\r\nod. There \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ain&#39;t no Prime in there that I can see. Nope, not at al=\r\nl. Not one trace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; There, I said my peace, and now I&#39;m gonna do as=\r\n told.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson Prime does nothing to rebel against orders=\r\n.
