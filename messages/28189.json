Two optic blasts were sent to intercept the missiles, shrapnel \nstriking his abdomen.\n\nRaising his left arm, he launched two energy-signature seeking missiles at \nKillfest, and two more from the other arm at FZ.\n\n---\n\nReflector fired an optic blast at the jet pack before it even got three \nmeters from EndBringer.  Raising an arm, he launched a heat seeking missile \nat FZ.\n\n---\n\nUnicron raised an arm, launching two energy-signature seeking missiles.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher felt two missiles hit his armor, not penetrating the thick armor \nplating.  The mounted machien gun swerved, firing off 25 armor-piercing \nrounds at Greven.\n\nThe smaller cannon swerved, launching off a sonic arc at Greven&#39;s legs.\n\nThe larger cannon fired off another three sonic shells at the Cybertronian \nFire.\n\n---\n\nShockwave launched another two missiles down at the Cybertronian Fire, flying \nin an arc to get another shot off.  \n\n"}}
