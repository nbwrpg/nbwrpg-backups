Although I\nenjoyed both Northlight and Gunther&#39;s posts that responded to it, this\none was weak, and pathetic, and sounded nothing like Megatron, so if it\nis all right with Gunther and Northlight, I would like to turn back the\nweels of time, as I never wrote this, and would like to respond in my\nown way. Could both of you e-mail me and give me the O K\n\n"}}
