According to the wildlife and landscape. I&#39;m getting somewhere in East Africa. I believe the human origin was in South Africa, and Dinobot had to travel many miles with Tarantsulus to get to Megatron&#39;s location. And it took a few miles for the Maximals to get to Tigertron, since I would guess was in somewhere in Asia. I could go on with this....) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickstrike: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Quickstrike didn&#39;t appreciate the &quot;little tropper&quot; bit. It felt funny, but he kept his mouth shut. He listened as Tranansulas (hope I got it right), thinking of this war, with the bots he didn&#39;t know about and didn&#39;t care about. He missed his old comrades. He wanted out of this, but he didn&#39;t see it as possible. Silverstyke has said he had been dead, but he really didn&#39;t believe in that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Hell Beast&#39;s th&#39; one ah wanna slag!&quot; Quickstrike said. &quot;He ain&#39;t worth nothin&#39;. Right now ah&#39;m with Megatron, but ah really don&#39;t cares &#39;bout him. Ah&#39;m jus,&quot; he wiggled his large claw left and right rapidly. &quot;playin&#39; along. Ain&#39;t got no one ah trust.&quot; He had to admit, the time when the Maximals claimed the Ark as their base was weird. He was the lowest ranking bot there, he lost Blackarachnia to Silverbolt, and he was faced with power from those stupid transmetal twos that could blow his head off. He never liked them. He missed the time of his eariler days. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This clone sounded like he was up to something interesting. &quot;What ya got in mind?&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fuzor went to a little destruction and yanked a dead branch from a small tree. He measured it up to his foreclaw. It was just the right&nbsp;size. He set it down, then turned his head to the side and grabbed a two foot long leave from a form of a vegitation he couldn&#39;t identify. ---That was that he didn&#39;t &lt;EM&gt;care &lt;/EM&gt;to identify. He ripped it off, and held it with his one working pincher. He shook it to try to tear it in two, but with just one oversized claw didn&#39;t work. He moved his claw with the large leaf in his claw, saying, &quot;Could ya tear this in half?&quot; He didn&#39;t want to crawl around to bang the heck out of his damaged foreclaw. He placed the stick over his left  foreclaw to act as a brace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
