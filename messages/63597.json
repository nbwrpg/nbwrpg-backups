She stopped at the doorway just outside\nsince raised voices were over heard. No, now is not a good time to\ninterupt, she thought.  She turned and went to the observation point.\n She leaned on the rail and looked around. &quot;Why? I don&#39;t undestand.&quot;\nShe lowered her head and tried to think past the darkness that filled\nher past. All she knew right then was she held the biggest grudge\nagainst Decepticons and Predacons.  So far, they had not harmed her\nand an allience with them to soolve this one opponate that could wipe\nthem all out was a logical answer. But still, she could not understand\nher own rage. Only that she hated them. She sighed deeply and tried to\nfind answersm somewhere in the lost data in the back of her memory banks. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
