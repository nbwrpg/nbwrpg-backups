As\nMaxima swung around and began her course back towards Hydras&#39; location\nher long range radar could reported back that his location was near to\na large mining mining city complex.  Much of the surrounding ground\nwas dust, dirt and soot, most of the foliage and fawna habing been\nburned away by previous mining in and around the area. What had not\nbeen killed by thgat suffered from lack of light due to the have haze\nof smog that hung over the area like some sort of brown fog.\n\nMaxima could make out that the ground itself was broken in spots, deep\npits and craters dotted parts of the landscape looking like wounds in\nthe earth itself. As she was approaching sight range of the city she\ncould make out its walls and some of its defensive weaponry, but was\nmost notable was several jets which seemed to hover over the city like\ndark vultures, flying to and fro. Sometimes they dipped down for\nsomething, other times they hovered, thier movements agile and swift.\nHowever it is obvious they were in search of anything that would be\napproaching from the air.\n\nSo far it did not *appear* that they had noticed Maxima . . .\n\nJets: http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/attachment.php?do=fullview&attachmentid=2190\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
