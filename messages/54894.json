I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll repost it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cam::\n&gt; \n&gt; She emerged from the CR chamber and looked about. With no other \nbots \n&gt; around, she decided to have some fun and explore the base.  She \n&gt; followed her little fox nose around to the kitchens, past the \n&gt; engineering hangers, through the private quarters and to the main \n&gt; entrance.  She looked around and inhaled the fresh outside air. \nShe \n&gt; looked out and saw some white butterflies dancing on the breeze.  \nShe \n&gt; ran after them in an attemp to play with them.  She jumped around \nand \n&gt; leaped at them. But the butterflies were always just out of \n&gt; reach. &quot;Hey, how can we play tag if I can&#39;t tag you?&quot; she \ngiggled.  \n&gt; She stopped a few hundred yards from the base and got a drink of \n&gt; water from a small stream.  She sighed and sat down. She yawned \nand \n&gt; layed down.  She looked up and watched the soft fluffy white \nclouds \n&gt; pass by.  She saw different shapes in the clouds and started to \nname \n&gt; them. &quot;Bunny, transport pod, small lunar module, fish, a \nflower, &quot;  \n&gt; she stopped and sighed. &quot;Mom, I hope your listening. I am trying \nto \n&gt; be good here. And Dad, I still don&#39;t like eating meat. It tastes \n&gt; funny. Can I please stick with just the sweet energon?&quot;  She \nsighed \n&gt; and looked down. She rested her head on her paws and \nwhispered. &quot;Mom, \n&gt; Dad, wish you were here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Nightlight still is inside the base\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
