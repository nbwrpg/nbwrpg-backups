Seeing Double Punch, he let him in.  &quot;How&#39;s our guest?&quot; Double \nPunch asked with a smile.\n\n&quot;Just fine!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, getting up quickly, transforming to beast mode \nand surging forward, slamming Double Punch and Ramhorn aside, knocking them \nboth out.  Taking Injector&#39;s stinger missile launcher, he set his plan into \nmotion.  Taking out a hologram cube, he activated it.  His body suddenly \nbecame red and grey, his optics a bright crimson.  The Maximal symbols on his \nbody turned to bright yellow Predacon symbols.  The Ancient Cybertronian \nwriting on his chest was replaced by a picture of the original Megatron&#39;s \nface.  Walking out of the door after locking it, he put the stinger missile \nlauncher away, strolling through the corridors, towards the exit of the \nPredacon base.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee got out of his CR chamber, walking towards the bridge of the \nPredacon base.\n\n===\n\nNearly to the Alliance base, Counter Punch looked around, no one around.  \n&quot;Counter Punch, transform.&quot; Going to robot mode, he once again looked around \nnervously.  &quot;Puncherize!&quot; he yelled, transforming into Punch, no symbols on \nhis body unlike Counter Puch.  Transforming into Punch&#39;s beast mode, a \nkangaroo, he hopped twenty feet forward each &quot;hop&quot;, heading for the \nAlliance&#39;s base.\n\n"}}
