It will cover us \nfrom all \n&gt; thier sensors. We can leave ommiters in the base sending sensor \nghosts of our \n&gt; numbers. As if preparing for the attack. They wont know weve left. \nAt that \n&gt; point we&#39;ll be hiding in the forest and swamps to the south of the \nbase. We \n&gt; can attack them from behind. It may give us a chance! We will still \nbe \n&gt; outnumbers.&quot; He sent out a comm to the Rouges. &quot;This is Hydras we \nare in need \n&gt; of your assistance immediatly, and we will be in debt to you. \nPlease come to \n&gt; my base immediatly.&quot; Quilldart grabbed all the magnet bombs and he \nmotiont \n&gt; for proto and starstorm to grab all the disguisers and headed to \nthe base.\n\n\n"}}
