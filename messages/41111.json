He landed in a bush with a thud. Grimlock transformed, and\nstood up, getting ready to fire a rocket from his gun. He leveled it,\nbut got slammed in the chest by the distabyliser ray, which sent funny\nsignals into his brain, causing him to step awckwardly a few times. He\nstepped once to many, and began to fall backwards, then hit the ground\nhard, as the impact caused his rockets to go off, to his right, into the\npack of Autobots.\n\nCliffjumper eyes widdened when he saw one of the rockets heading towards\nhim and Pacifix, and jumped at Torca, trying to tackle him out of the\nway.\n\n\n"}}
