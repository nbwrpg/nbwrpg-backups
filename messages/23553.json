She smiled briefly at \nboth of them, and waited for the Alliance bot to make a move. \n\nAs Angel Prime landed and started fighting Dark Angel, she cheered \nand suddenly &#39;eeped&#39;, dodging a fireball. The back of her knees hit \nthe pod and she tumbled over, landing in a sitting position. She \nsmiled up at Aerotaur when he asked, and answered &quot;I&#39;m fine, just a \nlittle surprised at all of the company!&quot;\n\nThe huge shadow of Windlord fell over her, and still sitting in the \ndust, she looked up. After his comment of &#39;we have to save the lady&#39;, \nshe got a look on her face, and started to answer when she suddenly \njumped up as Angel Prime was blasted in front of them.\n\n&quot;Oh gosh, are you alright, sir?&quot; She asked, and quickly checked that \nhe was regaining energy. She snarled and turned towards Dark Angel, \ndrawing her rapiers and tackling him to the ground with a quick dash \nand a leap. Sitting on top of his chest, she hit him with the full \nstrength she could with her blades.\n\n\n"}}
