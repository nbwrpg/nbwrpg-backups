He set\nhimself to get a running lunge at the bird. He fealt as if he&#39;d only taken a\nfew steps when he fealt the pain of branches raking across his face. He\nturned around to the field where he&#39;d started, &quot;How&#39;d I get here?&quot; he\nwondered. Somehow his speed had carried him aproximately 400 yards in mere\nseconds. He was still hungry so he transformed to his somewhat robot mode.\nas he feared he was no longer the dinobot like figure he once was. Now he\nwas a raptor, arms, legs, body, and tail with a robots head. His sword and\nshield no longer existed. He transformed to full raptor and rushed into the\nfield scareing the bird away. he ducked his head down and began chewing on\nthe carrion before him.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: CYBERWOLF4 &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2001 12:08 PM\nSubject: Re: Reclaiming my chars. / tesosterone check\n\n\n&gt; OK Logo, I made mutant signatures different from Maximal signatures so\nIce,\n&gt; Razor Claw, and Lunarpine can&#39;t walk through the shields.\n&gt;\n&gt; the main reason was that I didn&#39;t want to give Megaton a way into the CF\nand\n&gt; have everyone complain.\n&gt;\n&gt; BIC Razor Claw walked around shakily in his new Wolverine mode. He was\n&gt; confused and made a mental note to ask Veratis what had happened. Somehow\nhe\n&gt; knew that he still had his raptor mode but didn&#39;t want to waste the\n&gt; opportunity to learn about his new form.\n&gt;\n&gt; A little outside Maximal scanners the chat between Lunarpine and Megaton\n&gt; continued, Megaton sensed Lunarpines lothing.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You fear my size?&quot; The dragon spread his wings again, stretching them to\n&gt; the peak of thier width. &quot;Maybe I can make you feal more comfortable.&quot; He\n&gt; quickly transformed to his warped robot/ T-rex/ Dragon form shrinking\ndown.\n&gt; Even in this mode he was about 4 feet taller than Lunarpine and still\nfealt\n&gt; superior.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lunarpine stood up straight as he could trying pathetically to look bigger\n&gt; than he was. &quot;I&#39;ve beaten bigger bots than you.&quot;The wolfbot boasted\n&gt; attempting to impress the other bot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Megaton raised his T-rex legs to full extension making him 18- 19 feet.\nThis\n&gt; severely limited his mobility and coordination but the cocky mutant was\nsure\n&gt; he could recover fast enough to destroy the smaller bot before any serious\n&gt; damage was done.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Logo morph &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 16, 2001 8:10 AM\n&gt; Subject: Reclaiming my chars.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::DarkMouse::\n&gt; &gt; In her room in the base, she stretched her arms and yawned. &quot;Oh boy,\n&gt; another\n&gt; &gt; day, another computer problem to fix.
