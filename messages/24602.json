He didn&#39;t get far enough, and \nthe shock wave of the explosion and some shrapnel impacted with his back, \nsending him flying forward a few yards, the robot slamming into the ground.\n\nHe shook his head slightly, getting up with a moan.  He&#39;d dropped his sword, \nand was now unarmed.  He reached into subspace, taking out his plasma rifle.  \n&quot;Enough games, there are more important things than you!&quot; he yelled as he \nfired off three bursts at the enemy Mutant.\n\n"}}
