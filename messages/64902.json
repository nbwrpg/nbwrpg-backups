Powered =\r\nby abundant\n&gt; geothermal energy and hidden just the same, Megatron\n&gt; had mo=\r\nved Hellplague, Malice and wolfblade there for\n&gt; safety.\n&gt; \n&gt; he figured so=\r\non the factions would seek to elminate\n&gt; people none of them could control,=\r\n so for their\n&gt; preservation they moved to the dark island of\n&gt; Hokkaido.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; As he was running routine security checks of the\n&gt; island and the surro=\r\nunding waters, he picked up a\n&gt; minion signal.  if it was unfriendly he wou=\r\nld have to\n&gt; quickly eliminate it, lest it lead to trouble. \n&gt; Leaving Hell=\r\nplague in the base, megatron transformed\n&gt; into vehicle mode on a catapult =\r\npad and was launched\n&gt; out of a sea side hanger, which was well hidden when=\r\n\n&gt; the tunnel was shut.  he flew only a few feet over the\n&gt; raging waters o=\r\nf the northern seas, making his way to\n&gt; honshu, where the minion signal wa=\r\ns coming from.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;I just hope its Blacknightmare.
