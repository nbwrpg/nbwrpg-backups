We were all\n&gt; fighting basically in a hallway, and that hallway was getting a might\n&gt; full! Sending missiles into such a confined space was bound to have\n&gt; interesting results, I thought this would be fun, plus it did get a\n&gt; chance to shake everyone up at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone that was in the fight, except those that were with Legacy\n&gt; should be down in the large chamber below.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did this also to create persepctive. Keep in mind that the bots are\n&gt; actually in an extremely dangerous position. Nearly all the Predacons\n&gt; and Decepticons are here, while the bots are spread out. You have\n&gt; Rodimus and Tuscon who are both Prime class, but you also have Hydras,\n&gt; Jhiaxus and Cyclonus who are each one nearly the same strength.\n&gt; (Legacy is also nearly in that class as well) However as the cons have\n&gt; others in the room: Deepstryke, Phobia, Nightrazor, Scourge, the bots\n&gt; only have Nightshift. also the cons also had the internal base\n&gt; defences firing as well, which made this whole battle interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully this shake up will give the bots a chance to regroup and\n&gt; decide what they are going to do while every one is recovering. If you\n&gt; want to stay and fight that is cool, however with the odds, I would\n&gt; seriously recommend get out of there as quick as you can. If this was\n&gt; a battle where we were using stats and rolling dice . . . well thing&#39;s\n&gt; would probrably not end well :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, game on!\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
