Ironhide turns his head to his side, and looks\n&gt; down,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the centre of the disturbance. One very large Autobot had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smashed his desk, and was standing at his full height, very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; upset.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ironhide knew he was in for trouble, &quot;Is there a problem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grimlock?&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked, knowing there is. &quot;YES THERE PROBLEM&quot; Grimlock\n&gt; yelled,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voice echoing very clearly throughout all of Iocon. &quot;THIS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BULLSHIT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; YOU SEND ROOKIES TO FIGHT IN WAR THAT AFFECT WHOLE GALAXY,\n&gt; EVEN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WHOLE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TIME.

He pulled out his energon sword, and in\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swipe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cleaved his whole rows podium straight in half. Grimlock\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stopped and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked up at the main council, his sword at his side, energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shimmering off it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ironhide sighed, how did he get a weapon in this room. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasnt the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first time this happened. &quot;Grimlock, you know that if one\n&gt; of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Predacons will be on to us,&quot; He said calmly. &quot;None of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can go&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grimlock looked back up, then crossed his arms, his sword\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; above\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his head, still shimmering, the energy intesifing the look\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his crimson eyes. &quot;Then I go to earth to&quot; he said quietly,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost not heard with the large amount of gasps that escaped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
