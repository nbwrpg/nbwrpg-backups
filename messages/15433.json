Two missile launchers swirl to \nfire 2 signature-seeking missiles each at Koj. 4 laser batteries, and the \nautoguns also open fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler exits the Cybertronian Fire, barely making out a bot crawling on the \nground. He growls. Its signature was Predacon.\n\nPulling out a heavy-fire rifle, Grimmler opens fire on the Predacon, aiming \ntwo shots at its head.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl exits the Cybertronian Fire, seeing Grimmler and the defences firing on \na bot.\n\n&quot;Can you take care of it?&quot; Prowl asks, flying up to Grimmler.\n\nGrimmler nods, continuing to fire. &quot;Yeah, go help Firearm.&quot;\n\nNodding, Prowl turns around, flying off toward the swamp.\n\n"}}
