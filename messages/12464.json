She kneels\ndown at looks at him. She picks some flowers up and frowns*\n\nTwister: &quot;A warrior than.....A warrior now......A warrior forever.......&quot;\n\n\n*Twister sits the flowers on Sinesis. She pulls her double bladed sword out\nand slighty touches Sinesis. Than she sits the sword next to Sinesis and\ncloses her hands together and presses her hands to her head*\n\n\nBlizzard: &quot;......Life was never fair to me.......&quot;\n\n*Blizzard says as she keeps crying*\n\nBlizzard: &quot;......stay with me in my heart......&quot;\n\n*Blizzard says as she puts her hand on Sinister&#39;s face*\n\n\n*Twister thinks about how she was toying around with Blizzard and didn&#39;t\nthink about helping Sinesis. She growls to herself and thinks about the day\nwhere Retroflame set that bomb and it was her fault that Retroflame got away\nwith it. She thought about how she never told anyone but Sinesis about that\nstory....She didn&#39;t even tell Blizzard. She felt sad for his death as a\npartner and a friend but Blizzard felt sad of Sinister&#39;s death as a partner,\na friend and a lover*\n\n\n*Twister thought about the fact of all that happened and decided she wasn&#39;t\ngoing back to being partners with Blizzard*\n\n\nTwister: &quot;This may be the last time we see each other....&quot;\n\n*Blizzard ignores Twister as she continues to mourn the death of Sinister*\n\n*Twister looks at Sinesis and sighs and closes her optics and shakes her\nhead*\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 18, 2000 5:50 PM\nSubject: Re: Really big problem\n\n\n&gt; Sinesis and Sinister look at each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re being drug now, and it&#39;s not cool.&quot; Sinesis said.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, we&#39;re going to die anyway, so let&#39;s settle out differences now.&quot;\n&gt; Sinister replied. Both of them raised their swords, hitting Lobstruck at\nthe\n&gt; same time and then stabbing each other. Sinesis seen Twister in the\n&gt; distance, he waved to her. Sinister didn&#39;t have to worry, he left a\nmessage\n&gt; for Blizzard on the computer, hopefully she could forgive him for dying\nlike\n&gt; this.
