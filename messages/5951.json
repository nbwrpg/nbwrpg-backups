She scanned the \narea but couldn&#39;t get a reading.  She had snow piled up on her.  She \nwas nervous.  She wondered if she could even take this bot who was \nfollowing her. She heard footsteps in the snow.  The bot was getting \ncloser.  Soon he would be right on top of her.  She held perfectly \nstill.  She waited until he was right next to her.  She jumped up and \naimed her gun right in his face. &quot;HOLD IT YOU!...&quot; she froze.  She \nsaw Lunarpine standing there. &quot;What in the Matrix are you doing \nhere?&quot;  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The snow had gotten worse, even though the hail had nearly stopped, \n&gt; Lunarpine&#39;s senses were on full, his nose to the ground. most \nscents \n&gt; were buried beneath the snow. He&#39;d lost the predicons scent a while \n&gt; back. The cold didn&#39;t bother him, being from the arctic north \n&gt; helped. &quot;A storm like this isn&#39;t normal anywhere.&quot; he thought, the \n&gt; hot jungle below, would be destroyed by such a climate change.\n&gt; (Another temporal distortion perhaps.) Again he opened his comm \nonly \n&gt; to get static. His senses weren&#39;t reliable around here so he \n&gt; transformed to bot and continued his search for Shadow Wing. For \nsome reason he couldn&#39;t shake the fealing he was being watched.\n\n\n\n"}}
