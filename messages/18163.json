There \n&gt; was over 200 messages to read, and only one had something to do \nwith \n&gt; my chars, and that was only Drillbit asking Starscream how long to \n&gt; go. And somebody said that there was a rule against building bases \nor \n&gt; something, but when I built the embassy nobody complained. And Koj, \nI \n&gt; know that you got rid of the chip, but my character Prebon doesn&#39;t. \n&gt; He&#39;s not done with you yet. Oh No. Not by a long shot. And \nSoulstice \n&gt; is right about KSL. All you do is complain if somebody does a \nlittle \n&gt; thing wrong. Half of your posts are telling somebody that they \nbroke \n&gt; the littlest of rules. You don&#39;t see any of the other moderators \n&gt; going after the rules like that. Too me it seems you find joy in \n&gt; taking the fun out of other people&#39;s post. So why don&#39;t you just \nkeep \n&gt; your mouth shut and concentrate on your own stuff.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois saw the look of joy come up on Battera&#39;s face, and than die \n&gt; down. She must have been thinking something would go wrong. He felt \n&gt; like that to, and he felt like he could not leave the Alliance for \n&gt; some reason. He also thought that the farther they pursued this, \nthe \n&gt; stronger those feelings would be. But they had to try.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Would their be anyway we could extract the information from me?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream answered Drillbit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know. I have to find him first.&quot; Just than his radar \nstarted \n&gt; beeping, and Inferno came on the screen.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Got him! Follow me!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream took off.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Is Inferno still talking with Darkmouse?)\n\n\n"}}
