Our (the council&#39;s) goal is to guard against moding, and that mostly happens with new weapons (that&#39;s why certain people are being bugged by us more than others). Mostly-storyline things (like reformatting Australia, which doesn&#39;t create a superweapon or anything, but creates an interesting area to RP in) are generally good.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; That Mean that I can do that?!!!!!! \n&gt;   rAuq &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote: Stop playing council member, LN...

I will accept that absorbing thing however as for using\n&gt; &gt; it to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy\n&gt; &gt; absorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it suddenly\n&gt; &gt; &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note that\n&gt; &gt; energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since Blacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is specifically\n&gt; &gt; created to be used solely by those he creates it would have a very bad\n&gt; &gt; negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it and/or tried to\n&gt; &gt; use it to improve anything.
