I&#39;m not controlling him.  You moving\nout\n&gt; of the way would be moding.  And it doesn&#39;t really matter if you&#39;re ready\nto\n&gt; loose Suukie.  I&#39;ve lost a few of my characters before I wanted to, but I\n&gt; didn&#39;t whine.  And blowing apart Suukie&#39;s gut wouldn&#39;t necessarily kill\nhim.\n&gt; So stop moding, and shut up.  The barrel is less than millimeter away, if\n&gt; Suukie had done the same to any of my guys, unless he was aiming at shield\nor\n&gt; they had a personal energy shield, I couldn&#39;t do a dang thing about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Failed tests, classes skipped, forgotten locker combinations.\n&gt; Remember the good &#39;ol days\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4053/10/_/_/_/959131956/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
