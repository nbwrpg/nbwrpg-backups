Her\nbeak glowed and fired another ball of energy depletion at Surgital.\n&quot;Combined strength and intelligence you say?&quot; She couldn&#39;t repress letting\nout a chuckle as she responded, &quot;unfortunately five times your intelligence\nstill ends up as a big fat ZERO.&quot; The mutant was afraid for her life but\ndeep down inside she knew that if she was going to command she couldn&#39;t let\nher feelings show.\n\nAlpa Dolphy was grabbed by the monstrosity before them, now what was the\nnewly self appointed leader of the Maximals to do? While scanning the\nsituation her train of thought was once again inturupted by the sight of two\nmissles comeing in her direction.  The mutant owl put up a telekinetic\nshield to deflect the missles. It didn&#39;t work the way she intended as the\nmissles struck her shield and exploded and Ice careened into the Earth\nbelow. Though the missles did little phisical damage she couldn&#39;t keep her\nshield up when she hit the ground. White feathers floated through the air in\nthe path Ice had taken downward. Again she forced herself to her feat\ntransforming this time to her Polar bear mode.\n\nFurious by now about the lack of concern the Bodicons had for life the angry\npolar bear used her right front paw and slapped away a sawblade that was\naimed to decapitate her. The sawblade spun into the ground near Ice leaving\na large gash through both her paw and the ground where it had landed. Her\npain was obvious to those around as she pushed herself forward determined to\nstop the carnage around her even at the cost of her own spark.\n\nThe corageous female stared up toward the giant snarling as she made eye\ncontact. &quot;Operate as one?&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;That is thier weekness.&quot;\nNot even the five shots from Perceptor could push her from her three\nremaining good paws as her determination grew.\n\nGlareing toward the Gestault like a mother protecting her cubs the polar\nbear concentrated her thoughts and mentally directed them into the thought\nprocessors of Surgital. Seperated she&#39;d only be able to hit one at a time,\ncombined she could hit all five at once. Though she could detect the serated\nthoughts of the five bodicons she could still sense that what one fealt\nthey&#39;d all feel. Concentrating as if her own life depended on it she\nbroadcast one thought, &quot;PAIN.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Samir Duran &lt;1641coburn@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 5:35 AM\nSubject: Re: Mutant vs Decepticons.\n\n\n&gt; ::Surgital::\n&gt;\n&gt; Surgital put one arm out and Alpha Dolphy&#39;s shots hit it and went &quot;ting\nting\n&gt; ting!&quot;.
