Forcefields seal off the area =\r\n\nwhere the Minions are. Autoguns swing into place and begin to fire.\n&gt; =A0\n=\r\n&gt; Rodimus lets out a small chuckle. He checks himself over as he \nruns. His=\r\n signature masker was still operating but the grenade blast \nhad fried his =\r\ncloaking device.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Finall he is coming up on an outer wall. Two rocke=\r\nts later and \nthere is just a hole. Rodimus leaps out, transforming to behi=\r\ncal \nmode. He lands on all screeching tires. Heading for Mt. St. Hillary.\n\n=\r\nInside the ship Scourge is running to chase down his fleeing prey, \nhis wea=\r\npons at the ready as his face wears a grim look of \ndetermination. Trailing=\r\n behind him where four other sweeps running \nlike soldiers in lock step wit=\r\nh thier commander. \n\nThey all screech to a stop, Scourge holding up a hand,=\r\n they looked \naround as they could all feel the sudden a force shield that =\r\nsprang \ninto place cutting them off from Rodimus. \n\nEven as the spun around=\r\n, standing back to back as they surveyed the \narea, guns came alive on the =\r\nwalls and began to orient on the \nminions, and cut into them with metal cut=\r\nting fury!!\n\nScourge grunted as the bullets burned into him! Although his a=\r\nrmor \nwas tough and designed for heavy combat, even he was not impervious \n=\r\nto the attacks. The sweeps were not doing as well as he was. Two of \nthem w=\r\nere cut down immidiatly, and the other two were looking worn. \n\nLooking up =\r\ndown he smiled as lubricant leaked from several wounds, \nfor he noticed the=\r\n age of the floors and the walls of this room. This \nship had been abandone=\r\nd for quite some time, and time had not been \nkind to it. The walls were ru=\r\nsting in spots and the floors were not \nmuch better. The fiasco with the gr=\r\neandes on the level above was \nproof of that!\n\nWith a feral gin Scourge poi=\r\nnted his weapon upward, &quot;The battle is \nnot over yet prey! We are comming f=\r\nor you!!!&quot;\n\nMost ship shields were designed to capture prisoners two \ndimen=\r\ntionally, foward, back and to the sides, Scourge on the other \nhand was cre=\r\nating a door the ship was not prepared to block. With a \nsmile he fired his=\r\n disintergration beams upwards, vaporizing the \nupward bulkheads. \n\nWith a =\r\nleap he and the two remaining sweeps with him leaped into the \nair, shiftin=\r\ng into thier sleeker, and better masked hunter-seekers \nmodes they few upwa=\r\nrds, thier weapons blasting upwards even as the \nship attempted to contain =\r\nfire on them as they moved!\n\nFinally, with a terrific explosion, one that s=\r\nent metal debris over \nthe side of the ship and into the surrounding area, =\r\nthey fairly \nerrupted from the top of the ship, not too far from where the =\r\nbridge \nsat. \n\nFloating in mid air, his sensor scattering armor keeping the=\r\n ship&#39;s \nautoguns at bay, now that they were free of the ship enviorns, he =\r\n\nlooked around as he assessed the situation. \n\nOnly two of the six sweeps h=\r\ne had brough with him had survived, and \nfrom the looks of things Rodimus h=\r\nad continued to flee. Scourge had \nfailed, and he knew it. \n\n&quot;Commander&quot; Sc=\r\nourge&#39;s voice crackled across the minion encrypted \nchannel, &quot;Rodimus has s=\r\nuccessfully fled the ship and is headed in \nyour direction, I failed to des=\r\ntroy him.&quot;\n\nAfter a pause Cyclonus&#39; calm voice transmitted itself to \nScour=\r\nge, &quot;No, your attack on him was a test, his destruction will be \nat MY hand=\r\n. Had you succeeded then he would be unworthy of me, like \nall the rest tha=\r\nt have faced me. It would seem there something of the \nPrime in him after a=\r\nll.&quot; \n\nThe voice of Cyclonus paused for a moment and then continued, &quot;Retur=\r\nn \nto my location, here you will find a way to redeem yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Ca=\r\nme Scourge&#39;s reply, the voice of an mech who had been just \nbeen given a st=\r\nay of execution. &quot;I am on my way!&quot;\n\nWith that Scourge and the sweeps shot i=\r\nnto the air, moving swiftly \nand silently in the direction of the ark!\n\nPre=\r\nston\n(Scourge & Sweeps)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
