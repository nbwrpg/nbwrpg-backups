I have a task for you.. Perceptor. If you cannot \nhandle it, \n&gt; then find Wheeljack-X. He was supposed to have started work on my \nold style \n&gt; form before I came here. This body is inadiqate. Until that new \nform if \n&gt; constructed... I need a better form.&quot; her words so confident.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  \n&gt; I am looking at first updating her form to a fuzor like form \nsimilar to \n&gt; Tigerhawk, it&#39;s a BW TM2 form, but we can make it more like a BM \nform. \n&gt; Then eventually, either sooner or later, she may go back to her \nold style \n&gt; form, the one that is more of a Gen 1 type. \n&gt; So.. somehow, time to make her a BW TM2/BM similar to Tigerhawk. \n&gt; TY\n&gt; Stac\n\n\n"}}
