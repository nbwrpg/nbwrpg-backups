She slanted a look \n&gt; at Carnage and crossed her eyes, making a discreet &#39;He&#39;s crazy!&#39; \n&gt; sign. She then stifled a smirk.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good Day? Well that really depends on your point of view&quot; She said \n&gt; sarcastically, and out of the corner of her eye, she saw Sabre (the \n&gt; bald eagle) sitting on the branch directly above Instrat, lifting his \n&gt; tail slightly. Her eyes brightened, but no one else noticed. \n&gt; \n&gt; If eagles could look mischevious, Sabre would have right then. He \n&gt; aimed perfectly, and dropped his &#39;poop missile&#39; on straight perfect \n&gt; aim towards the bots head, impossible to miss. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Fuzor kept her wrist dart aimed on Instrat&#39;s head, waiting for \n&gt; the bot to make a move.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
