I sure got that\n&gt; feeln&#39; right now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He slowly walks forward, and moves quietly, without disturbing anything\n&gt; along the way.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\nAs NIGHTSHIFT approached the main door, however it opened easily to a\ntouch from POLAR CLAW who was right behind him this time.\n\nThe room that was revealed was what one might consider as a foyer or\nbetter yet a waitying room. It was farily non-descript with walls of a\ngreyish white. There was a small monitor on the otherside of the room\nand seats along the wall. This was as far in as probrably most mechs\nwere allowed to go if they were not part of the watchers. Nothing\nsecret be seen here but anyone in here could be scanned and probed by\nthose on the inside.\n\nThere was nothing signifigant about this room except for the door that\nled further into the tower.\n\nPOLAR CLAW and the others followed in closely behind.\n\n&quot;We need to go through the door to the communication&#39;s section.&quot; POLAR\nCLAW said as he looked around. &quot;The back up antenna control should be\nthere.&quot;\n\nWOLFGANG nodded, &quot;But we are going to need power too.&quot; He pointed to\nthe monitors, &quot;I don&#39;t see any lights or power here.&quot;\n\nThe door to the outside slid closed as PROWL enetered keeping out the\nwinter weather. &quot;The generator is down a level not far from the\nstorage area. I bet a circiut blew when we blew the main antenna.&quot;\n\nPOLAR CLAW nodded, &quot;Nightshift, you and Prowl get to the communication\nsection. Wolfgang and I can get the power back on fairly quickly.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
