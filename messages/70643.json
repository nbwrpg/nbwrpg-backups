Meanwhile the insectoids continued thier\nrelentless attacks, on both Vestige and Tuscon!\n\nSuddenly the door slammed open, the sounds of buzzing insects could be\nheard, as a swarm of them flew into the room. Blue ones, red ones,\nsilver ones, black ones, each of all shapes and sizes. However in the\nmidst of that a female walked, the insects flying around her obeying\nher and yet giving her a wide birth at the same time. She was tall,\ntaller than any of the insects, her movements smooth and flowing. She\nwas black and red with large insect like wings sitting on her back,\ndesigned something like seeker wings on a transformer. Her limbs were\nsupple and femine, but there was no mistaking the strength and power\nthat was held within them.\n\n&quot;Tuscon, Tuscon.&quot; She said as she turned her gaze upon him, her eyes\nwere crimson multifaceted eyes. &quot;You believe that your leader was the\nwhat we wanted?&quot; She tilted her head, &quot;Ahh&quot; she said as just just\nunderstanding it, &quot;It is that singular thinking you have.&quot;\n\nShe chuckled as she looked over at Vesige, the insects were swarming\nover him, causing him to falter under thier onslaught. &quot;You have\ngotten this far only because I we have allowed it.&quot;\n\nAt a gesture from the larger female the swarm of insects that were\nattacking Tuscon and Vestige leaped into the air and began to hover\naroud the cieling of the room as the room itself began to warp and\nspin as if the very world around him was changing, altering, or\nperhaps returning to normal.\n\nThe last whisper of a voice, &quot;Perhaps you gave us exactly what we\nwanted . . . &quot; then there is laughter.\n\nThe world goes black . . . and then Tuscon is aware of the medbay as\nhis systems come back online. He can hear the voice of Santon, &quot;It is\ndone. Rodimus is comming out of it and Tuscon&#39;s systems are comming\nback to normal levels. We have done it, they are safe.&quot;\n\nA quiet laughter plays in Tuscon&#39;s head, or perhaps just a memeory of\nit, but it falls silent as the real world beckons for Tuscon&#39;s\nattention.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
