Weapons emerge from his \nsides and hood, but instead of firing he just flies(/falls) down at \nArty, his underside as armored as his sides.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Pacifix / Crossroads ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix keeps running after Grimlock, trying to catch up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads twists out of the drunk&#39;s hands as the drunk \n&gt; transforms. The shield and sword fold together and Crossroads&#39; \n&gt; robot form emerges as he falls away from the drunk. &quot;Try to get \n&gt; ontop of him, the extra weight will probably stop him from moving \nor \n&gt; shooting too much.&quot; He yells as he lands near the location that \n&gt; Pacifix had entered in.\n\n\n"}}
