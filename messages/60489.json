He drew his sword and prepared to strike \nthe final blow to Blacknightmare.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Without warning, the sixth minion sprang into action.  She dived \ndown on the bounty hunter and tackled him.  Both roll around on the \nground until they are a fair distance away from the rest of the \nfighting.  They rested, with the sixth minion sitting on top of \nMalice, and both trying to force the other away.  She leaned down \nuntil their faces were only inches apart.\n&gt; &quot;My, a powerful one.  And what is your name?&quot; she asked in a \nseductive tone.\n&gt; &quot;My name, is Malice, the single most powerful bounty hunter to \nwalk any world,&quot; the transmetal male said as he continued pushing \nagainst his opponent,&quot;and who are you?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;My name is Hellplague,&quot; she said, and stole a kiss before pushing \nherself off the hunter.  Said hunter stood and tried to wipe the \naction from his face.\n&gt; &quot;You ought to keep your face to your self, lady, it will get you \nin trouble one of these days.&quot;\n&gt; Hellplague smirked and giggled to herself, thenm both charged \nforward and engaged in another stalemate.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; blackNightmare  punched Malices face\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; the missiles struck Malice head on and he falls back, and lands \n&gt; near an energon deposit.
