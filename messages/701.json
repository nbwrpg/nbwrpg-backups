She sighed.*\n\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t know, we could try. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work too good.&quot;\n\n*Carnage looked at the flying island, no, it wasn&#39;t too far. But she had a \nweight to her that she was trained to have, a weight that was needed to \ncarry large weapons and win battles. The sort of weight an assassin needs in \norder to survive.\nShe thought that if Teltoli stayed in her beast mode and Carnage just hung \nonto her legs they just might be able to get to the island. But if it didn&#39;t \nwork then it would have to be Cyber Claw who took Teltoli the rest of the \nway and not her, Carnage would just have to give her the coordinates, that&#39;s \nall.\nCarnage sighed again, but there was no harm in trying.*\n\n**************************************************************\n\n*Dinobot snarls in surprise as Scourge&#39;s blade cuts across his face, right \nin the last place that Tavatron happened to slash in their training. An \neruption of mech fluid comes from  the wound on impact and sprays outward, \ncovering anything within a few steps.\nHe growled as he stepped back and shook his head, the mech fluid now seemed \nto spill from the wound and onto the ground. The wound was a large jagged \nslash from the top of his temple to a few millimeters from his chin, the \nmech fluid flowed down his neck, arm and chest.\nDinobot wiped the mech fluid from his optics as he looked Scourge straight \nin the optics, he could taste his own fluid and he spat.\nHe growled at Scourge as he took another step back, he had to think of \nsomething that he could do that would take this bot down!\nDinobot took a quick look towards Tavatron, she seemed to be unscathed by \nthe surrounding battle...him on the other hand.\nHe judged the distanse of Scourge from him and saw that he was only a metre \nor two away, he growled and took a step forward, targeting with his site and \naimed at the Predacon&#39;s optic again.\nDinobot then lept into the air and brought his claws down onto the \nPredacon&#39;s shoulders, with a quick action he swept them inward and towards \nhis enemies neck. He knew that it was a risky move but he had to at least \nstop this one from entering the Ark....at any cost!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
