Sunstreaker adds his two sense\ninto this, &quot;Well I think your making a mistake, Grimlock has a point,&quot;.\nSideswipe looks at his brother, &quot;Shut up, he&#39;ll do fine, thats why\nGrimlock is going along, to keep him on his toes,&quot;. &quot;Enough&quot; Ironhide\nsays, as he gets up and transforms, heading for the area of launch.\nSideswipe and Sunstreaker quickly follow suite. Then the image zooms in\nand out, then in again. Then in the rafters there is movement, and a\nclicking noise can be heard, then a transformation, as a camera turns\ninto three robots, and flies up through a hole in the cieling, followed\nby a bat. The four robots float through Cybertrons skies, away from the\nAutobot/Maximal zone, towards Predacon territory. Soon, they will arrive\nat their destination.\n\nIronhide Transforms when he reaches a large garage. Sideswipe and his\nbrother stay in their car modes. &quot;Come on Hoist, dont be late for lift\noff&quot; he yells into the garrage. Hoist walks out, bidding farewell to\nGrapple. &quot;You sure you want to go through with this?&quot; Ironhide asks.\n&quot;Sure Im sure&quot; he says, transforming into his tow truck, and zooming\nahead, then followed by Ironhide.\n\nGrimlock watches Swoop leave their domain. &quot;Come Dinobots, time we go,\nShow Maximals how you do Exploring&quot; he boasts, as he stands up.\n\n"}}
