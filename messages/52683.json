Still a few cycles left before it blew up. \nHe sent a comm signal to the CR bays and about two dozens stasis pods \nflew out of it. He would at least save them.\n\nHe turned and looked at the battlefield. Things were chaotic at the \nvery least.\n\nMeteara came down in front of the so-called Reaper. She seemed not \nimpressed one bit.\n\nMeteara: What is the matter, Cybertronian? You come for me, yet I have \nnever seen you. Do you really want to fight? Even after seeing that I \njust destroyed this ship?\n\nSanguine said nothing. She came closer and just punched Meteara in the \nface. She was thrown back a few feet away.\n\nSanguine: Shut up and fight, Junk!\n\nShe produced a heavy proton cannon and fired twice.\n\nThe Vok was caught unaware by the first shot but raised her pincer and \ncountered with her machine gun.\n\nSanguine was hit but she did not mind. She would kill the lady.\n\n\n"}}
