His mechanical tail\n&gt; was long and seemed like a heavy flail, his wings seemed to have been\n&gt; made to shred things up, and he seemed to look like a standing\n&gt; skeleton the way his armor covered him. His neck was extended, but\n&gt; not\n&gt; so much as theirs. His horns started drilling and he opened his jaws\n&gt; for a massive roar... followed by an equally massive blast of energy\n&gt; aimed at the leftmost enemy. Without waiting, he took the sword out\n&gt; of\n&gt; the Moon&#39;s rocky soil and brandished it menacingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: You amuse me Minions. You show yourselves as tough, but\n&gt; are really nothing like the real deal. You won&#39;t amuse me for long.\n\n\nOOC: Are you in the form of a dragon brandishing a sword, or something\nelse?\n\nAs the minions get closer, thier form become clearer. They do indeed\nresemble dragons at first: They have the wings, the tails and head, but\nonly the rear legs and small front legs. (Think wyvern or drake) Like\nshadows they streak through the skies even as Azureblade&#39;s death\ndealing breath scortches one of them, sending it spinning in long\nlooping circles, its armor crisping under the assault!\n\nAgile as birds and yet as domininat as lions the other two circle for a\nmoment and then one of them alights on the ground shifting form as he\ndoes so. Even as the other circles like a vulture waiting for its prey\nto fall.\n\nIn the intermittent light the new commer&#39;s armor is a reflective silver\nand ebony black. Standing a few arm lengths away his stance is large\nand agressive, red horns rising from his helm, as black wings flare\nfrom his back. Sharp spikes of armor extend from his shoulder plating\nas cannon mounts rest on his pectoral chestplates. In one hand he\nwields a wickedly curved sword nearly as large as he is a strangly\nreflective black!\n\n&quot;Your ammusment will fade with your life functions. You face Animus\nfirst blade of Vorpal.&quot; With a deliberate motion he points the sword at\nAzureblade even as his the outside calf plates of his armor open up and\nrelease a flurry of rockets at Azureblade.\n\nPreston\n(Animus)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
