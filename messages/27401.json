They dwarfed him.  He would still fight. \n He looked between them.  Vehement was focused on Hot Rod, whom he&#39;d seen \nfight, no sense in wasting time there.  Reflector and Kluster were also \nengaged in battle.  That left Sun Crusher.  Whistler stepped in front of Iron \nRaptor.  &quot;You are the commander.  I am expendable.  You are not.&quot;  With that \nsmall amount of explanation.  He extended his claws and leapt at Sun Crusher. \n (His claws are strange.  He has four that begin on the back of his hand and \ncurve along the fingers of his fist.)  \n\n"}}
