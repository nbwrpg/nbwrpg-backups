The kitten was gone.....just like that. His mission \nwas a joke, how was he supposed to do this, with one person. The senate \nmember who sent him here did it to get rid of him. This was a punishment, not \na privilage.\n    &quot;Gremlin.....we have left Black Aracnia. She is a fool. Now, we are going \nto find Megatron and help him. The Predacon Council will pay for sending me \nhere.....everyone will pay!&quot; He said with bitter hatred in his old gruff \nvoice.\n    &quot;Where are we going to find Megatron?&quot; Gremlin said, a loyal yes-man who \nwould follow his leader into the Inferno. &quot;And what makes you think he wont \nkill us?&quot;\n    The only place he could be would be in Ominous Primes lair. There are no \ntoher bases, old or new, he could be in. And Megatron isnt an outdoor bot, he \ncant rough it. He needs a luxury suite. Now, lets go.&quot;\n    And with that, Hell BEast and Gremlin set out towrds the great north \nartic region.\n\n    Aaracnia shighed. She wanted to join the Predacons together but it wasnt \nworking out. It was to much for one bot to do....it was time to get friends. \nShe was going to call Kitkat. If she would let her group join, they could \nmake one big Predacon group, and then others would join, and if they didnt \njoin they would be conqured and forced to join.\n    &quot;Paralysis, get Kitkat on the comm, I want to talk to her.&quot; She said, and \nthen turned to see Quickstrike and Cyber Claw enter the bridge. &quot;And what do \nwe owe the pleasure of this visit?&quot;\n\n    Paralysis called Kitkat, or her base at least. &quot;This is Paralysis, of the \nPredacons under Black Aracnia. She wishes to speak to you, its very \nimportant.&quot;\n\n"}}
