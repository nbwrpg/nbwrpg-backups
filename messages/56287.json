Name&#39;s \nKitKat, Predacon Warrior.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but notice his well \nbuilt physical attributes. She couldn&#39;t show it, but she was smiling \nlike  young wolf pup inside. &quot;I wish to thank you for fixing me. I \ndon&#39;t know what happened. One minute I&#39;m training battle techniques, \nthe next, I&#39;m walking through the woods with a belly ache and from \nthere, it gets kind of fuzzy.&quot;\n\nCam::\nShe walked up to KitKat and tapped at her other hand. &quot;Hey, I was the \none that found you. I&#39;m Cam. He just brought you here. I found you \nand wanted to keep you, but Blackfang said I had to ask.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe couldn&#39;t help but smile at the little bot. &quot;Oh really? You found \nme huh? Then I owe you a thank you.&quot;  She knelt down and patted the \nlitle bot on the shoulder, looking into the little one&#39;s \noptics. &quot;That was a very brave thing you did. A maximal wouldn&#39;t \nnormally approach a predacon like me. You are very brave and a very \nbold warrior little one. Keep it up.&quot;\nThen she stood up and looked at Blackfang. She couldn&#39;t figure out \nwhy they didn&#39;t just leave her to die. After all, that&#39;s what a \npredacon or decepticon would have done. She smiled at him, letting \nher optics show the gratitude as well as her face plates. &quot;So, I \nguess I owe you a thanks as well huh? Oh Maximal Knight?&quot; her voice \nsoft and light.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang stood up. He was even more impressed to see her as a bot\n&gt; than when she was a wolf. By Primus was she gorgeous! However, he\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure if she did wish to stay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Uh... I guess I didn&#39;t introduce myself. (he held his \nhand\n&gt; out) I&#39;m Blackfang, Maximal knight.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
