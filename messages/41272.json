I will not\n&gt;force you\n&gt; &gt; to endure the process, but it might bring a better understanding of\n&gt;our\n&gt; &gt; goals.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse\n&gt; &gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
