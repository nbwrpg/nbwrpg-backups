Hopefully, HotRod was\n&gt; reprogrammed now, after being repaired by Feline.  Yes, Skulletron\n&gt; just had to setup everybody in the right position, and then, victory\n&gt; would be achieved.  He would have Feline use HotRod to cause some\n&gt; chaos, and then, Skulletron would throw away Feline from his\n&gt; cabinet.  He would return to Zardus, and tell him the bad news of\n&gt; Feline not surviving.  Then, Skulletron just had to pick off of\n&gt; Zardus&#39; other followers, slowly, and then, Skulletron and Zardus\n&gt; would be the most powerful duo.  Skulletron and Zardus.\n&gt; Yesssss..Skulletron was heading to where Chordate was.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      He arrived.  He slowly, ever so silently, crept up behind\n&gt; Chordate, and then quickly grabbed his ray gun and swung it at\n&gt; Chordate&#39;s head, trying to knock him out.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
