I was under the command\n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the High Predacon Council.  I was desined and created as an \n&gt; assassin. \n&gt; &gt; I killed many high Maximal officials. but the one that got me\n&gt; almost \n&gt; &gt; killed was the assassination of Quantis.  I killed him and then \nmy \n&gt; &gt; leaders turned me into the maximal authorities.  I was to be \ntried \n&gt; &gt; and killed. But I escaped.  The last thing I remember was my ship \n&gt; &gt; getting sucked into a black hole. After that, I remember nothing \n&gt; &gt; untill I woke up in your arms.&quot;  she smiled at him, &quot;Which I aim \nto \n&gt; &gt; thank you properly for later on.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt; She tried her best to help all three of them to the lab.
