She saw Stringtra and Quickstrike talking.  \nShe didn&#39;t want to interupt them, so she walked by without saying \nanything to them.  She went inside and sat down at Darkmouse&#39;s \nconsole.  She wan&#39;t the best with computers, but she was wanting to \nget familar with the scanners.  She studied them and learned how to \nwork them.  She was hoping to crack the mouse&#39;s codes so she could \nrun the console as well if the situation called for it.  She found \nthe the mouse had put in security systems that she couldn&#39;t break \ninto.  She sat back and sighed a bit.  She was getting restless \nagain.  She needed a good hunt.  But Quickstrike had ordered no one \nleave untill Megatron returns. &quot;Oh what a yawn a minute day.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike looked at Stingtra. &quot;No, ah don&#39;t think we do,&quot; he \nreplied to \n&gt; her. He thought for a moment to think of what he could do for her. \nWhile \n&gt; thinking, he remembered the sporting game he and Tarantsulus played \nonce in \n&gt; a while. He laughed. The only way it could be described as was a \none-legged \n&gt; butt kicking contest. There were several times when he lost. It was \ndue to \n&gt; that he couldn&#39;t keep his balance. Having such large feet that he \nhad \n&gt; weren&#39;t easy with a sport like that. But when he did nail the \nspider, it \n&gt; hurt.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
