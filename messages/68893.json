We go &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered himself into position near the top of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; host.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Strangely the response for the approaching Decepticons and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Predicons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was a bit\n different - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no &lt;BR&gt;combat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was initiated. Instead Hydras recieved a call: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled over the communication &lt;BR&gt;lines &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatron, I can &lt;BR&gt;feel &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his essence within you, and I have felt it since you have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; approached. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ancient connection between us. Approach no farther and live, &lt;BR&gt;leave &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and you will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-562669277-1216178780=:80704--\r\n\n"}}
