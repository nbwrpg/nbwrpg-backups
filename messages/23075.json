Please take the proper\n&gt; procedures, make shure that you are succured properly, have all lose\nluggage\n&gt; tied down, then bend down and kiss your ass good-bye!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Shadow Cat frowned towards her twin brother and smaked his arm.*\n&gt;\n&gt; Shadow Cat:\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t be an ass Snow Tech, this is serious!

A bright light up ahead made them both look up. The\n&gt; light began to fall at greater speed, passing them with a sonic boom. The\n&gt; two little forest animals, being babies, where more curious than afraid by\n&gt; this monstrous noise and flash. So, they walked towards the ship,\nfollowing\n&gt; thier noses(Or beaks) in animal fashion.\n&gt; They find a small ship in ruins, flashes and small explosions still kept\nthe\n&gt; two from getting any closer. Suddenly, a yellow beam flashes outwards,\n&gt; scaring the two away, but not before they where anilized and fed into the\n&gt; ships computer.*\n&gt;   * The pod door opens and a black leopard and a white leopard steps out\n&gt; followed by a small flying lynx with white wings.....*\n&gt;\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
