Spinister,\nkneels, and grips for something, but shares the same fate, as his two\nguns unfold, and transform into their organic robot modes. Singe begins\n&quot;Ohhh no.&quot; in a worried tone. Spasma looks over, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s happening.&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nMeanwhile Strafe falls to the ground, cluching his chest. In the storage\nhangar Hoist suffers the same fate, as others fall around him, Grimlock\nlooks down at all the following Autobots in disgust, then buckles to one\nknee, but fights, as he crawls over to a window. He looks out, as his\noptics widden at the Worm hole open up. &quot;We in deep exhaust.&quot; He\nnotices, seeing to figueres fly beside them.\n______________________________________________________________________\nSlugslinger is having problems keeping in a straight path, then his\nengines die out, as he is sucked into the worm hole ungracefully,\nhitting the Autobot shuttle, and bouncing off of it through a wing, and\nthen his movement ceases. Caliburst looks from the inside. &quot;Whoa big\nguy, you better not be out of energy and stranded.&quot; he notes, as they\ndrift silently in the large void. Then slowly he is drawn foreward.\n&quot;What, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Caliburst asks, unveiling his uncaring demeanor\ninto one of fear for a minute, as he reads the instruments functioning\non emergency power. Gravitational force was pulling them down. He began\nto heat up, and burn as a ball of fire, as he descends quickly, his\narmour fizzling, until he bounces of the crashed autobot ship&#39;s wing,\nand the smaller ship lands, leaving a crater beside it. Caliburst opens\nthe cockpit, &quot;This dosent look good.&quot; he notes, looking at his enemies\nlarge base.\n\n"}}
