Dachande was in a frantic, he was \nblasting at the ground with all of his weapons, but it did no good. \nHe couldn&#39;t get her, so he used his spear to try and dig, needless to \nsay he wasn&#39;t sucessful.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Battera fell into the cave of Vukodlak. She caught herself on \nher wings, and coasted to the ground. Unfortunatly her will was not \nas strong as others, she could not resist Vukodlak&#39;s lure, there was \nnot even any resistance. She went and partook of his mech fluid. It \ngave her enhanced abilities, and made her somewhat eviler. She then \nburst from the ground ten feet from Dachande, and took off without \nDachande, he went to beast mode, as it were his faster form of \ntravel, but he was still losing yards to her.\n\n\n"}}
