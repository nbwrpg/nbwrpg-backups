As for your idea Malice, we need to make sure\nthat the theory about Unicron is correct. If it is\nthen destryoing him here would have minimal effect on\nour timeline. In short, we need more information\nbefore we can decide on a strategy. I must commune\nwith Primus. As for joining your team to recover the\nMatrix, I will go, as Primus has already given me its\nlocation. And from what I was told by him before being\nsent back from the Matrix.

If we\n&gt; harness enough energy, and we catch him off guard,\n&gt; we could shove him back through the rift.  Then all\n&gt; we would have to do is seal the instablility.&quot;\n&gt; He was worked up, the plan would work... if a few\n&gt; things happened right.  One, securing a large enough\n&gt; energy supply for Malice, two, a way to get energy\n&gt; to Malice, and three, get energy from said bounty\n&gt; hunter to the repulser.\n&gt; &quot;Please!
