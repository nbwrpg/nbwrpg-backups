I have \nallied us with the forces of Tyrael and Cygnar. We expect the \nPredacons to attack their base. Both those factions will defend that \nbase as we strike the nearly empty Predacon base. However this is all \ndependable on the Predacons. They could attack us first. If so, then \nTyrael and Cygnar&#39;s forces will back us up here. We will stand and \nfight. I want everyone ready immedietly. We are on red alert!\n&gt; \n&gt; Alarms sound through the base signaling for battle readyness.
