Something that would\n&gt; give th=\r\ne Autobots some sort of advantage over the Decepticons.&quot;\n&gt; RODIMUS flexed g=\r\niving a physical manifestation to the helplessness and\n&gt; sense of frustrati=\r\non and futility he felt. &quot;But that is what Megatron\n&gt; was trying to do for =\r\nthe Predacons.&quot; He sighed resignedly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know if we have changed=\r\n the future or not. We can only trust\n&gt; that we haven&#39;t since so far we hav=\r\nen&#39;t noticed anything.&quot; RODIMUS\n&gt; frowned, &quot;The question is, would we notic=\r\ne anything.

With us here and making our home on the range.  Whatever it=\r\n is, it shall come to pass.  We have already changed that, alas.&quot;\n\nContinui=\r\nng, &quot;What we know of the future, already in doubt.  We&#39;ve done too much her=\r\ne to reset it about.  If the Decepticons shall do it, the Predacons are wro=\r\nng, then perhaps we have to fight them, with our own sort of song.&quot;\n\nPointi=\r\nng over at one of the auxiliary screens of Teletraan One, &quot;Cybertron exists=\r\n here, at war and at peace.  Here in the past, they are starved for release=\r\n.  Would it it not be so simple, to just send a message?  To the AUtobots t=\r\nhere we can send a message of hope.  That Prime is still alive, the Matrix =\r\na trope.  Shockwave is a bureaucrat, useless, aghast.  Would we be able to =\r\nturn things about from the past?  For Megatron wants to rule..  Not Megatro=\r\nn that was, his own self to school.  So, he would not think of contacting S=\r\nhockwave.  So we could send for reinforcements and change the war laudwave.=\r\n&quot;\n\n\n"}}
