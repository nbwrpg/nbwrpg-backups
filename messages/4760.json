I didn&#39;t mean to make you \nangry.&quot;\nShe smiled.  She placed her hand on his cheek and slowly glided her hand \ndown his cheek and over his neck. She leaned forward and kisses him again.  \nShe was enjoying that energy running through her spark when she kissed him.  \nShe felt something inside her that she had never felt before and if felt \nwonderful to her.  She wanted to be with him.  She never wanted to leave his \nside. &quot;We can go for a wak in the forest if that will make you happy.&quot;\nShe smiled at him.
