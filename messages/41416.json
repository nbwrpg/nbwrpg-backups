If Quatro isn&#39;t even a TF then how the hell did he send a\n&gt; message to IR in the first place? Does he have a walkie talkie? In that\ncase\n&gt; IR&#39;s transmission should have reached him.\n&gt; Her frequency wasn&#39;t only open to Maximals or transformers. It was locked\n&gt; onto the same frequency as Quatro&#39;s form of communication.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Quatro, not recieving the message due to not being actually being a\n&gt; &gt;Maximal,\n&gt; &gt;and not even being a transformer, for that matter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Oh, nothing, I see you&#39;ve ordered for your troops to come back.
