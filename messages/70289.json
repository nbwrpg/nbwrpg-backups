Hold on, my gait isn&#39;t exactly the smoothest.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She holds on as he bolts toward the Ark.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Tucso=\r\nn Prime manages to get Talon&#39;s message.

I&#39;m in one piece, but I&#39;m not so sure about Rodimus.=\r\n I hope \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s all right.  Anyway, I&#39;ll look forward to a little down ti=\r\nme with you \n&gt; &gt; as soon as this is behind us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns to Percept=\r\nor.  Again more gears turn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Perceptor, I&#39;d like to thank you for =\r\nyour help and your willingness to \n&gt; &gt; return where you felt most intimidat=\r\ned.  To me, that is not the way of a \n&gt; &gt; Predacon, but the valor of a Maxi=\r\nmal.  And no, it&#39;s NOT an insult, it&#39;s a \n&gt; &gt; complement.  I&#39;m sorry you ha=\r\nve not had the experience of having a formal \n&gt; &gt; complement, and I promise=\r\n you what I say I mean.  Your help is valuable \n&gt; &gt; and I can not put a pri=\r\nce on it.  Speaking of your help...  Did - you by \n&gt; &gt; chance create the sh=\r\nell program?  If so, perhaps you know of a way to \n&gt; &gt; reverse it.  Anythin=\r\ng you can help us we&#39;ll gladly take, and we will \n&gt; &gt; protect you if need b=\r\ne, from Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime unlike Hydras, didn&#39;t need the power =\r\nof oppression to win his \n&gt; &gt; comrades, and he knew that he couldn&#39;t force =\r\nanyone to do anything they \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to do.  And he always expected =\r\nhimself to return the favors \n&gt; &gt; that are given to him. Perceptor&#39;s help w=\r\nas valuable he knew he&#39;d have \n&gt; &gt; quite a debt to pay to him once everythi=\r\nng was said and done.  He holds \n&gt; &gt; out a hand to Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Leg=\r\nacy, please note that from this day forth, although Perceptor is of a \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndifferent faction, he has helped us greatly.  Therefore, we must always \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; keep our doors open to him if he needs our help and our protection.  Enem=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; or not, he has risked his own spark to help us and that is something=\r\n we \n&gt; &gt; must all honor.  Perceptor, I would personaly like to shake your h=\r\nand in a \n&gt; &gt; show of peace and Neutrality.  You&#39;ve earned my respect as a =\r\ncomrade and \n&gt; &gt; shown us selflessness and the ability to cooperate with th=\r\ne opposite \n&gt; &gt; faction.  The choice is yours Perceptor, and I respect what=\r\n you choose.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carrol=\r\nl &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor looking to Legacy said, &quot;i dont know you, but I&#39;m going to go=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; down\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and bring the primes back, or at least one of them&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Legacy nodded, &quot;Come, we must do all that we can to secure the prim=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Without them then all is lost.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is a short moment bef=\r\nore Legacy and hopefully Perceptor are able to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; catch up with Tuscon at=\r\n the edge of the tunnel.
