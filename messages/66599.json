But someone less mobile\n&gt; had to=\r\n organize the ensuing assault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur: Silver Wing Platoons 1 and 2, =\r\nstand ready for break in on my\n&gt; mark!\n&gt; \n&gt; He prepared his own Uzi and a c=\r\nouple of grenades.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as he saw Remus and Razorwing get out the w=\r\nindow and he\n&gt; received confirmation, he got up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur: Soldiers, at=\r\ntack! We break the siege now! Get me that wall\n&gt; open now!\n&gt; \n&gt; A few of th=\r\ne heavy hitters concentrated fire on the outer wall and\n&gt; managed to tear i=\r\nt down in a matter of moments so that Deadfur and his\n&gt; detachment entered =\r\nswiftly. He threw a grenade inside and waited for\n&gt; the explosion before ge=\r\ntting in. Of the few bots still standing, he\n&gt; shot through them with decis=\r\nive force.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur: We mop up! Those guys are unconscious! Platoon 1, =\r\ntake the\n&gt; west wing and make sure they&#39;re all tied down when they wake up.=\r\n\n&gt; Platoon 2, same thing, east wing. Go!\n&gt; \n&gt; He paused for a moment. It ha=\r\nd actually worked, they were in and\n&gt; securing Parliament.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur: Ra=\r\nzorwing, we&#39;re in and sweeping after you. Seems like your\n&gt; bomb had the ex=\r\npected effect... for now.

The enemy\n&gt; &gt; rapidly realized who they we&#39;re, and =\r\nsoon rain of blast and missile\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;re exploding all over the place. Some=\r\n wall could give cover to\n&gt; &gt; Razorwing  and Remus but it was just a matter=\r\n of time before anyone\n&gt; &gt; get them. they had to be quick.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has Raz=\r\norwing took a small clock-looking device from under his wing,\n&gt; &gt; he starte=\r\nd to ignitiating it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razorwing: This device wont destroy the build=\r\ning but this will\n&gt; &gt; defenitly affect all the bot in the area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Re=\r\nmus: What?!?!Are you crazy? Just in case you didn&#39;t realized, WE ARE\n&gt; &gt; IN=\r\n THIS AREA!!!! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razorwing: Calm down, youre still to green, with t=\r\nhis technology. This\n&gt; &gt; was made to prevent minions attack. At max power, =\r\nthis toy can affect\n&gt; &gt; the spark of any bot from a five clicks range, but =\r\nrigth now it will\n&gt; &gt; be set for the parliament dimension: about an half-cl=\r\nick. An istead of\n&gt; &gt; turning off bots, it will knocked them off quite some=\r\n time. The core\n&gt; &gt; of the island will not be affected either, not at this =\r\npower level.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razorwing didn&#39;t tell Remus that this was just theori=\r\ncal : this\n&gt; &gt; situation is the first real test of this secret project.

The electromagnetic shock cause by the\n&gt; &gt; explosion was weak when Razo=\r\nrwing was hit by it. He landed slowly on\n&gt; &gt; the floor next to Deadfur. He =\r\nkne the effect wouldn&#39;t last long due to\n&gt; &gt; the small force in the bomb bu=\r\nt he was force to turn into best mode\n&gt; &gt; and offline for a short time.
