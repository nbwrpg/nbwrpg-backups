What he did not\n&gt; anticipate was the blast \n&gt; charge coming at his backthrusters. He was propelled\n&gt; a few meters \n&gt; farther, which made him lose his lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: I will kill all of you pretentious and\n&gt; arrogant Tripredacus! \n&gt; Milord Megatron shall never be taken by the likes of\n&gt; you!\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired his machine guns randomly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock, burned by the flames, lost hold of the Ant.\n&gt; He steadied his \n&gt; aim and shot several spikes at his enemy, all\n&gt; acid-coated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock: Whaddaya say now, Antie?
