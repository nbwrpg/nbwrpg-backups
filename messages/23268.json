It&#39;s just...I&#39;m so afraid of heights and with you doing \nall that stuff it nearly gave me a sparkattack. I...didn&#39;t mean to slap you \nlike that, I just guessed that you didn&#39;t read my thoughts before and that \nwas the onely way to get it through.&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor was just about to turn her head towards Prowl when she \nsuddenly heard a bumbling sound, her eyes then searching around the woods. \nWere there bees near by?\nShe snapped her head towards the sound just then, putting up her arms to \nprotect her face as she saw something rushing towards her, feeling a small \npresure and a clunk against her armor, then feeling a soft thud on her \nshoulder.\n\nIron Raptor lowered her arms, looking towards the direction the thing had \ncome from, then looking towards Prowl as she hears him move.\nHer eyes widened as she saw him aim his guns towards her, stepping back for \na moment.*\n\n&quot; What are you doing?!!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor keeps her eyes on the weapons for a moment before she looks to \nwhere Prowl was pointing it to. Her shoulder?\nThere, she saw some sort of tiny fur-ball, hearing it make some sort of \nsound.*\n\n&quot; What the Pit is this?&quot;\n\n* She lifted a hand towards the creature on her shoulder, running her finger \ndown the cats back and then feeling the wings, seeing that it probably \ndidn&#39;t bite.\nIron Raptor scanned it.*\n\n&lt; It&#39;s a bot, just a really...really little one. Like a child.&gt;\n* She thought to Prowl, simply then using her index finger and thumb to grab \nhold on the creatures scruff on the back of it&#39;s neck, moving to lift it off \nher shoulder and then dangle it in front of her to show Prowl.*\n\n&lt; Cute little bugger though, hmm?&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
