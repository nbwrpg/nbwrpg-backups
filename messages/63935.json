So, if we have those huge megacitites, we better have some people \nwith whom to speak. I guess you understand this.\n\nWhat I suggest is this: we classify NPCs in categories. Civilians, police, \nmilitary, scientific, diplomatic and government, Watchers, traders, \nindustrials, Corrupt (mafia-like), Cyberworld, and so-on. After that, we \nhand out those categories for the players to be in charge of. So, when \nBoybot wants to investigate on a slug that was used to kill a High Diplomat, \nhe either goes to see a scientist (controlled by Tankor, for example) or a \ngun expert investigator (controlled by someone else). These are the minor \nNPCs, those you&#39;ll meet once or twice and forget about.\n\nOf course, there are going to be major NPCs too. I think we can handle them \nwith the categories, and the players could also control them, with a few \nexceptions. The major NPCs are not characters and are thus killable. Sergent \nRoughbot, Maximal unit leader, may get in intense combat along with the unit \nthe PCs are in, but while the players&#39; chars will get out of the fight \nalive, Sarge will be killed by the frag grenade that hit too close. Also, \nthere must be no more than 1 or 2 major NPCs by category, meaning that they \nare both extremely rare and extremely valuable to the roleplaying \nexperience. Optionaly, the major NPCs could be dictated or partly dictated, \nmeaning that the design (or not all of it)  will not be left to the player. \nThis last point is more debatable because it&#39;s simply boring to have nothing \nto invent, but it could also be simpler. Another point about Majors: They \nhave to make the story progress in some way. Sarge up there died, but his \ndeath is taken as a declaration of war by the Silver Wings and they simply \nstart an assault on Pred units because of this.\n\nI send this to everybody because it will be simpler to explain in this way \nand also I want to hear comments, suggestions and corrections about this.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Airshadow Nightstar&quot; &lt;airly2002@...&gt;\n&gt;To: roborick007@..., gestaltproject@...\n&gt;Subject: Re: OOC: NBW IMPORTANT\n&gt;Date: Thu, 02 Jun 2005 17:17:30 -0500\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN� Calendar keeps you organized and takes the effort out of scheduling \nget-togethers. \nhttp://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-ca&page=byoa/prem&xAPID=1994&DI=1034&SU=http://hotmail.com/enca&HL=Market_MSNIS_Taglines \n  Start enjoying all the benefits of MSN� Premium right now and get the \nfirst two months FREE*.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_7b5b_4d2b_7d73\r\nContent-Type: message/rfc822\r\n\r\nX-SID-PRA: Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt;\r\nX-SID-Result: Pass\r\nX-Message-Info: JGTYoYF78jFjUgqZgOUCfwMA4ZhiR3zR6DlTt7M0EsY=\r\nReceived: from hotmail.com ([64.4.53.76]) by mc1-f35.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(6.0.3790.211);\n\t Thu, 2 Jun 2005 15:22:17 -0700\r\nReceived: from mail pickup service by hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC;\n\t Thu, 2 Jun 2005 15:17:30 -0700\r\nMessage-ID: &lt;BAY19-F26396B49C803FAAB048BF0A0060@...&gt;\r\nReceived: from 148.233.114.229 by by19fd.bay19.hotmail.msn.com with HTTP;\n\tThu, 02 Jun 2005 22:17:30 GMT\r\nX-Originating-Email: [airly2002@...]\r\nX-Sender: airly2002@...\r\nIn-Reply-To: &lt;20050602211605.16947.qmail@...&gt;\r\nFrom: &quot;Airshadow Nightstar&quot; &lt;airly2002@...&gt;\r\nTo: roborick007@..., gestaltproject@...\r\nBcc: \r\nSubject: Re: OOC: NBW IMPORTANT\r\nDate: Thu, 02 Jun 2005 17:17:30 -0500\r\nX-Priority: 1\r\nImportance: High\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed\r\nX-OriginalArrivalTime: 02 Jun 2005 22:17:30.0632 (UTC) FILETIME=[DE072880:01C567C0]\r\nReturn-Path: airly2002@...\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style=&#39;background-color:&#39;&gt;&lt;DIV class=RTE&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Well, You should know Azure that robo was updated about the BW&#39;s Project, I&nbsp;guess that the only thing to be solved should be re-start&nbsp;day and &nbsp;if rules should change or just a slighty update.
