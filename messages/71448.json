Quickstride wanted very much to stay put at the r=\r\niver bank, with Windlord , but duty did come first.\n\n&quot; I promise we&#39;ll go b=\r\nack there after the meeting is officially over.  I saw something there that=\r\n I want to investigate, a possible location for a portable wind powered ene=\r\nrgy turbine. &quot;\n\nUproar looks to Quickstride and Windlord. He was very much =\r\ninterested in the concept of generating clean and efficient power, without =\r\nharming the environment.\n\n&quot; Hey I&#39;m all for that if ya need help, guys. Wai=\r\nt a sec...  Quickstride, that idea of yours, do you realize how much power =\r\nthat turbine is gonna give us once you get it up and running?  Enough ta cr=\r\neate a sizable shield and weapon system for the Ark...  Dude, that&#39;s huge! =\r\n That&#39;s something the Preds don&#39;t have!  Go on, tell Leo Prime, man if that=\r\n turbine project is a go, like Rodimus said it is, imagine how many lives y=\r\nou&#39;re gonna save.&quot;\n\nHe nudges his equine friend with a gentile paw.  Quicks=\r\ntride nods and transforms into robot mode.  Usually a very modest fellow, h=\r\ne walks up to Leo Prime, with a holographic image of a wind turbine, comple=\r\ntely portable, resting. In a recessed rockface of a near by cave, etched in=\r\n a very tall mountain which is surrounded by dense forest land appearing un=\r\ntouched as the turbine powers itself with wind and uses a hydro turbine sys=\r\ntem as backup.\n\n&quot; Leo Prime, Sir, if I could I have something to show you, =\r\nthat could very well enable us to protect the parameter, environment, wildl=\r\nife, and  Natural habitats that have established themselves here.  All we n=\r\need are the energy resources to pull it off.  I think I have something here=\r\n that will enable us to do it all.  It&#39;s a turbine that runs on wind with a=\r\nn extension that runs on water as a backup power source when there isn&#39;t an=\r\ny wind being generated.  Best part is, it&#39;s completely portable and designe=\r\nd for quick disassembly so we can leave the planet as we find it, completel=\r\ny untouched.&quot;\n\nHe shows Leo Prime a simulation of the workings of his inven=\r\ntion.\n\nTucson Prime arrives with Talon, just in time to hear the proposed i=\r\ndea by Quickstride.\n\n&quot; A power source running only on wind and hydro electr=\r\nicity.  Simple, yet natural, without harming the ecological balance of this=\r\n planet.  And did I hear you correctly, Quickstride?  Could that turbine gi=\r\nve us enough power to protect and supply our reserves with enough natural e=\r\nnergy to fend off our enemies sufficiently? &quot; \n\nQuickstride grins modestly.=\r\n\n\n&quot; Well there is a lot of testing that&#39;ll have ta be done, but if it works=\r\n like I hope it&#39;ll work, it could, yeah definitely, it would give us the ho=\r\nme team advantage.  But as I show it in this simulation, location is everyt=\r\nhing.  I know where I need to position this system and all I need is some h=\r\nelp to transport and assemble the turbine system.  I made sure to design it=\r\n with light, but sturdy materials, just in case.&quot;\n\nTucson nods and turns to=\r\n Leo Prime.  \n\n&quot; I think this is something we should strongly consider.  Wh=\r\nen Rodimus and the others get here, we&#39;ll resume the meeting as you intende=\r\nd to,  Leo Prime.  Quickstride, what you have here is something highly valu=\r\nable.  Why didn&#39;t you propose this earlier?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Tucson m=\r\nodestly.\n\nWell, I didn&#39;t wanna interrupt Leo Prime or any of you guys.. &quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson shuffles Quickstride up front where all the leaders sit during impor=\r\ntant meetings.  Uproar gives his buddy a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; Way ta go Quickstrid=\r\ne.  You&#39;re part of the house now.&quot;\n\nTucson gives Quickstride his seat.\n\n&quot; N=\r\now as soon as Rodimus and the rest of the team gets here, I want them to se=\r\ne and hear your proposal for the turbine system you&#39;re designing.  And plea=\r\nse, don&#39;t be shy.  You have something Hydas doesn&#39;t have, a perpetual and n=\r\natural energy resource, plus the means to access it in a harmless manner.  =\r\nLeo, we need all the energy we can gather and this is our best shot of gett=\r\ning it.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Jul 12, 2011, a=\r\nt 3:42 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n    \n  Talo=\r\nn/Windlord:\n\n  windlotd sighed he didnt liked to to come back so soon but h=\r\ne didnt said anythinng and mount up.\n\n  ************************\n  Talon si=\r\nghed and she followed Tucson\n\n\n\n  From: Sandy Panico \n  Sent: Monday, July =\r\n11, 2011 12:33 PM\n  To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n  Subject: Re: Changing tim=\r\nes (Cue: All Maximals & Autobots)\n\n\n\n\n  Quickstride perks up his ears with =\r\na sheepish grin on his face, looking innocently forgetful about not going b=\r\nack to the meeting.\n\n  &quot;Oops!

All we need are \nthe energy =\r\nresources to pull it off.&nbsp; I think I have something here that \nwill en=\r\nable us to do it all.&nbsp; It&#39;s a turbine that runs on wind with an \nexten=\r\nsion that runs on water as a backup power source when there isn&#39;t any wind =\r\n\nbeing generated.&nbsp; Best part is, it&#39;s completely portable and designed=\r\n for \nquick disassembly so we can leave the planet as we find it, completel=\r\ny \nuntouched.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He shows Leo Prime a simulation=\r\n of the workings of his invention.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Tucson Prim=\r\ne arrives with Talon, just in time to hear the proposed idea by \nQuickstrid=\r\ne.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot; A power source running only on wind and h=\r\nydro electricity.&nbsp; Simple, \nyet natural, without harming the ecologica=\r\nl balance of this planet.&nbsp; And \ndid I hear you correctly, Quickstride?=\r\n&nbsp; Could that turbine give us enough \npower to protect and supply our r=\r\neserves with enough natural energy to fend off \nour enemies sufficiently? &quot;=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Quickstride grins modestly.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot; Well there is a lot of testing that&#39;ll have ta be done, but =\r\nif it works \nlike I hope it&#39;ll work, it could, yeah definitely, it would gi=\r\nve us the home \nteam advantage.&nbsp; But as I show it in this simulation, =\r\nlocation is \neverything.&nbsp; I know where I need to position this system =\r\nand all I need is \nsome help to transport and assemble the turbine system.&=\r\nnbsp; I made sure to \ndesign it with light, but sturdy materials, just in c=\r\nase.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Tucson nods and turns to Leo Prime.&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot; I think this is something we should stron=\r\ngly consider.&nbsp; When Rodimus \nand the others get here, we&#39;ll resume the=\r\n meeting as you intended to,&nbsp; Leo \nPrime.&nbsp; Quickstride, what you =\r\nhave here is something highly valuable.&nbsp; \nWhy didn&#39;t you propose this =\r\nearlier?&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Quickstride looks to Tucson modestly=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I didn&#39;t wanna interrupt Leo Prime or =\r\nany of you guys.. &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Tucson shuffles Quickstrid=\r\ne up front where all the leaders sit during \nimportant meetings.&nbsp; Upro=\r\nar gives his buddy a thumbs up.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot; Way ta go Qu=\r\nickstride.&nbsp; You&#39;re part of the house now.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;Tucson gives Quickstride his seat.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot; Now as =\r\nsoon as Rodimus and the rest of the team gets here, I want them to \nsee and=\r\n hear your proposal for the turbine system you&#39;re designing.&nbsp; And \nple=\r\nase, don&#39;t be shy.&nbsp; You have something Hydas doesn&#39;t have, a perpetual=\r\n \nand natural energy resource, plus the means to access it in a harmless \nm=\r\nanner.&nbsp; Leo, we need all the energy we can gather and this is our best=\r\n \nshot of getting it.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantl=\r\ny busy. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Jul 12, 2011, at 3:42 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &l=\r\nt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;airly2002@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;
