Then again Prowl never completed \nthe order so the wolfbot wasn&#39;t inclined to follow them. He followed \nProwls scent hoping to catch the odor of his attacker.\n\n&quot;Prowl are you functional?&quot; his answer came from the sound of a \npellet launcher firing from the location of Prowls scent.Both Shadow \nWing and Prowl were functional, that was all that mattered at this \nmoment.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Yes, Unitron is a Newcomer, but Prowl isn&#39;t a Predacon, Inferno.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Prowl/Zeus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl grins at Lunarpine, &quot;No can do, you&#39;re getting in a CR \nchamber whether \n&gt; you like it or n-&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shots from Unitron dig into the base of his wing, sending Prowl \ncrashing down \n&gt; to the ground. Prowl sits up, firing an acid pellet at Unitron.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zeus opens his eyes. He was in severe pain, complete with nearly-\ncritical \n&gt; damage done to his systems from the crash. He crawls slowly toward \nShuko.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir,&quot; he coughs out, &quot;I suggest we make a tactical withdrawl. \nWithout Ra, we \n&gt; cannot form Dark Messiah.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
