He\n&gt;\n&gt; uses sharp hearing to pick up the smallest of=\r\n sounds, even those deemed to\n&gt; be completely silent. He pays close attenti=\r\non to how the ground seems to\n&gt; vibrate under his feet, giving him indicati=\r\non that although hidden, he\n&gt; could\n&gt; tell where his opponent was. He slowl=\r\ny brings Straight Shot around. With\n&gt; one of his arms injured, he had to do=\r\n things in reverse. With the good arm,\n&gt;\n&gt; hold the weight of his weapon, a=\r\nnd with the bad arm, pull the trigger. He\n&gt; had often practiced alternating=\r\n between his hands, and was glad he had done\n&gt;\n&gt; so. Being ambidextrous was=\r\n an attribute. He loads an arrow specifically\n&gt; designed to be barbed and m=\r\nost difficult to remove. He knew that it was\n&gt; better just to disable his e=\r\nnemy rather than destroy him. He needed\n&gt; Nightrazor for questioning. Most =\r\neffective area of targeting, would be the\n&gt; knee joint Imbed the arrow in a=\r\n joint and his opponent would find it most\n&gt; difficult to abmulate, yet it =\r\nwould not kill or destroy him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now within striking distance, as determi=\r\nned by his sonar sensors, he sends\n&gt; out short pulse emissions to pinpoint =\r\nhis area of targeting. His reading is\n&gt;\n&gt; quick, yet, anything could happen=\r\n at this point. He aims, and attempts to\n&gt; launch an arrow deep into his en=\r\nemy&#39;s knee, if his calculations were\n&gt; correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Steady Straight Shot. =\r\nWe need to make this count.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot programs her mechanisms for =\r\noptimal effeciency.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Talk about a shot in the dark.

He was always ready to kick a &lt;br&gt;=\r\nfew enemy heads in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Miserable slag headed scrap heaps! If the=\r\ny think they&#39;re gonna get the &lt;br&gt;best of us, Wing Caliber, they&#39;re=\r\n wrong! C&#39;mon! We still have an Ark to &lt;br&gt;\ndefend!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He tak=\r\nes out his largest blast cannon, and quickly charges into battle, &lt;br&gt;hopin=\r\ng to wipe out a few unwanted pests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, deeper into the Ark T=\r\nucson uses his own charismatic stealth to &lt;br&gt;\nnavigate in the room, thinki=\r\nng what Night Razor may be thinking as well. He &lt;br&gt;uses sharp hearing to p=\r\nick up the smallest of sounds, even those deemed to &lt;br&gt;be completely silen=\r\nt. He pays close attention to how the ground seems to &lt;br&gt;\nvibrate under hi=\r\ns feet, giving him indication that although hidden, he could &lt;br&gt;tell where=\r\n his opponent was. He slowly brings Straight Shot around. With &lt;br&gt;one of h=\r\nis arms injured, he had to do things in reverse. With the good arm, &lt;br&gt;\nho=\r\nld the weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the trigger. He &lt;br=\r\n&gt;had often practiced alternating between his hands, and was glad he had don=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;so. Being ambidextrous was an attribute. He loads an arrow specifical=\r\nly &lt;br&gt;\ndesigned to be barbed and most difficult to remove. He knew that it=\r\n was &lt;br&gt;better just to disable his enemy rather than destroy him. He neede=\r\nd &lt;br&gt;Nightrazor for questioning. Most effective area of targeting, would b=\r\ne the &lt;br&gt;\nknee joint Imbed the arrow in a joint and his opponent would fin=\r\nd it most &lt;br&gt;difficult to abmulate, yet it would not kill or destroy him.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now within striking distance, as determined by his sonar sensors, he=\r\n sends &lt;br&gt;\nout short pulse emissions to pinpoint his area of targeting. Hi=\r\ns reading is &lt;br&gt;quick, yet, anything could happen at this point. He aims, =\r\nand attempts to &lt;br&gt;launch an arrow deep into his enemy&#39;s knee, if his =\r\ncalculations were &lt;br&gt;\ncorrect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Steady Straight Shot. We need =\r\nto make this count.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Straight Shot programs her mechanisms for =\r\noptimal effeciency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Talk about a shot in the dark. Okay, let&=\r\n#39;s do this.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Outside the Ark, Night Shift quickly scrambles=\r\n around the enemy fire, &lt;br&gt;brought upon by the Sweeps and is quick to cove=\r\nr Rat Trap who is also trying &lt;br&gt;to ellude them as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Woah=\r\n! Okay, that&#39;s not workn&#39;! Rat Trap we need a new game plan!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Rat Trap scurries out of the way of Waspinator&#39;s blasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&quot;Gahh! You&#39;re right! So, what&#39;dya suppose we do?!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Night Shift quickly dodges more fire and gets close to Rat Trap, &lt;br&gt;tran=\r\nsforming into SUV mode on the fly, as he gets his buddy inside his cab.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;First things first, slip inta somethn&#39; with more speed. Whew=\r\n, at least I &lt;br&gt;can dodge better on wheels.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rat Trap looks up=\r\n in the rear view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;They&#39;re gain&#39;n on us! C&#39;mon, wh=\r\natever it is you&#39;re plann&#39;n ta do ya better &lt;br&gt;\ndo it fast!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night Shift now eyes an area of canyon where it appears to be like a=\r\n tunnel. &lt;br&gt;Large enough for a SUV to speed through, but not large enough =\r\nfor a plane to &lt;br&gt;fly through safely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Heeeey, I got it.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Rat Trap catches on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Oooohhhh lure &#39;em in but the=\r\ny can&#39;t fly out.

Okaay, let&#39;s have some fun.&qu=\r\not;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rat Trap scurries to his roof, and gets into beast mode. He soon=\r\n starts a &lt;br&gt;\ntaunting dance to try and lure the enemy his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&qu=\r\not; HEY, AIR HEADS, DOWN HERE! WE KNOW YA WANT US, SO C&#39;MON, WE DARE YA=\r\n!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night Shift also starts his taunting gestures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;=\r\nI know you want a piece of my tailpipe, c&#39;mon, bet your ugly afts ya ca=\r\nn&#39;t &lt;br&gt;\ncatch me!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his wheels, he spins dust and dirt=\r\n into the air, adding smoke from his &lt;br&gt;dual exhaust system for added insu=\r\nlt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; In the computer control room Legacy continued to wor=\r\nk to keep as many of &lt;br&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt; main systems from being fried by =\r\nthe wave that had been coming from &lt;br&gt;&gt; Tuscon.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor continues working tr=\r\nying to insolate the most important parts &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of&lt;br&gt;&gt; the ark =\r\nand he said &quot;HYDRAS IS A COMPLETE FOOOL!!!!...

With a roar, he replies.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You =\r\ngot it Sir! Consider this creep as good as junk!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus looked at Uproar, &quot;I know you and Leo =\r\nII can handle it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; A call comes in to Rodimus from To=\r\nrca, leader of the Fuzors. &quot;Sir! We are&lt;br&gt;&gt; under attack by the Pr=\r\nedacons.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus nodded as he looked over at Ramulus,=\r\n Ramulus nodded back at &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Elita.&quot; Rodim=\r\nus said to his his little one. &quot;I will have to leave you &lt;br&gt;&gt; with=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ramulus so I can go defend the Ark.

He loo=\r\nks over to Wing Caliber while holding his chest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Whewww, ohh boy, talk about a major pulsator stopper. I could so fai=\r\nnt&lt;br&gt;&gt; right now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He catches his breath=\r\n as he wipes off his forehead.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I hope the r=\r\nest of our team&#39;s havn&#39; as much good luck as we&#39;re having.&quot=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;SLAG!&quot; Wing Calib=\r\ner said from the main console on the bridge. With a few&lt;br&gt;&gt; deft moveme=\r\nnts of his fingers he brings up the main view screen. &quot;Hydras &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; several sweeps are attacking.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Wing Cali=\r\nber turned to look at Quickstride, &quot;It would seem that this is &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; not&lt;br&gt;&gt; over yet.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Wing Caliber was attempting t=\r\no bring main external weapons online or the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shields, but at the mo=\r\nment nothing was working.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; A call came in from Legacy, &quot=\r\n;We are attempting to bring shields and/or&lt;br&gt;&gt; weapons back online, ple=\r\nase stand by.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Tucson too, approaches the ninja intruder, =\r\nand ignores that&lt;br&gt;&gt; little warning about his energy reserves going low=\r\n. He had dealt with&lt;br&gt;&gt; intruders of the dark many times, and being vis=\r\nually impaired, he knew how&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to unlock their secrets of steath. He =\r\nnodds to Legacy&#39;s reply.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Understood Le=\r\ngacy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus=\r\n, this is Tucson. I&#39;ve approached the area where the intruder is&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; located. I&#39;m hoping the doors close properly to ensure capture. I se=\r\nnse &lt;br&gt;&gt; this&lt;br&gt;&gt; enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting=\r\n Uproar and Leo ll in &lt;br&gt;&gt; grave&lt;br&gt;&gt; danger, I will take on the int=\r\nruder personally. He has crossed the line in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; my envronment, and it=\r\n&#39;s time he pays the price by someone who is as versed&lt;br&gt;&gt; in stealt=\r\nh as he is. I ask you to call back Uproar and Leo ll to prevent&lt;br&gt;&gt; fur=\r\nther harm to them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; His optics narrow. He dr=\r\naws Straight Shot in his hands, to begin his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; little game of cat an=\r\nd mouse.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus replied, &quot=\r\n;Uproar and Leo should be about there as well. I will &lt;br&gt;&gt; send&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n them a message. I am on the way out to protect the Ark!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; As Rodimus continued towards the door he sent a message to Uproar and =\r\nLeo,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Hold back!

The sweeps fan out, using their&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; superior maneuverability to its greatest advantage as they try to come a=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;&gt; the Maximals from all sides at once!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rat Trap an=\r\nd Nightshift&#39;s weapons fire back up into the air, although this&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n time it seems to be of no avail as the sweeps twist and turn to avoid &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; The sweeps are nothing if not smooth and agile!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; The sweeps come back for another run when Silverbolt and Noctorro =\r\nsweep in&lt;br&gt;&gt; from around one side, their weapon&#39;s fire cutting into=\r\n the sweeps, &lt;br&gt;&gt; damaging&lt;br&gt;&gt; one, and sending another falling to =\r\nthe ground with a plume of smoke and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fire trailing after it!&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The sweeps seemed temporarily stunned with the Fuzor&#39;s and t=\r\nhe Maximal&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; charge into the battle, that is until Cyclonus, De=\r\nepstryke and Waspinator&lt;br&gt;&gt; show up!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Waspinator angles=\r\n in, opening fire on Rat Trap, &quot;Waspinator say he getting&lt;br&gt;&gt; tire=\r\nd of blowing up Maximals!&quot; he chuckled as he said this, his wings&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; buzzing as he continued firing at Rat Trap. &quot;Then again maybe not!=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Meanwhile the floating mobile cannon slash weapons =\r\nsatellite floats in the&lt;br&gt;&gt; air, orienting its powerful main gun on Nig=\r\nhtshift and opening up with&lt;br&gt;&gt; bursts from his powerful ion blast cann=\r\nons!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; However last, but definitely NOT least Cyclonus float=\r\ns in, looking &lt;br&gt;&gt; majestic&lt;br&gt;&gt; and almost regal as he maneuvered i=\r\nn over the battle. In his jet mode he&lt;br&gt;&gt; looked to be like a hawk or a=\r\nn eagle, staring down at some bit of prey on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the ground, waiting f=\r\nor just the right time to pounce on it.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; There is a small cl=\r\nick from beneath his wings and then twin pylons drop &lt;br&gt;&gt; from&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nthem, their aft sends igniting and they take off targeting the Maximals&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; below!!&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *It would seem that this battle has begun in =\r\nearnest!*&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
