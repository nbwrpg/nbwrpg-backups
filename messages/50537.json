I \nassume the Maximals who followed you here have already set up base \nand are attempting to recapture your greatness.\n  I have openly been an admirer of yours for years, but I have yet to \ndo anything illegal, so the Maximals know nothing about me, not even \nif I&#39;m a Predicon or Maximal, infultrating them is as simply as \nchanging my icon and I can be your spy.\n  That on the other hand brings us to the issue of how I could \ncontact you.  I have studied psychic waves for a number of years, and \nfinally produced these 2 way radios which in theory work along the \nsame frequencies, hence they can cut through this annoying energon \nradiation, cannot be intercepted so the Maximals remain clueless \nabout my true mission, and can instantaniously send a signal from one \nend of the universe to the other.  With this I could be a perfect spy \nfor you.  All I ask is a position in the new Predicon order, and that \nyou will take care of my dear friend Phoenix, she refuses to fight, \nbut has great skill healing and might be willing to be a doctor.  \nDoes your greatness agree?\n\nHe looks hopefully at Megatron.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: Flicker flies in.

The Pred leader eyes the two but is hardly worried about \nany \n&gt; deceitful action; entrance auto guns would have made short work of \n&gt; Flicker and Pheonix had either of them left the area. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Flicker I presume. What exactly bring you to the Pred base?&quot; \n&gt; Megatron seems outwardly without a care as to why they may be at \nthe \n&gt; Pred base, but inwardly, he is slightly curious.\n&gt; \n&gt; He is interrupted by a commlink from Perceptor, &quot;Yes Perceptor, go \n&gt; meet the bot, and bring him to the entrance, I&#39;m there now, and so \n&gt; are two other bots.&quot; A small smiles creeps to his face; the \n&gt; Predacons forces were growing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before he can&#39;t say any more, another commlink is redirected from \n&gt; the central comm center, to him from another bot \n&gt; (Slaughter/Skulletron), &quot;This is Megatron, state your faction and \n&gt; why you are here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade stares at the floor for a bit, realizing that Megatron \n&gt; has either forgotten about him, or has become preoccupied. Not \n&gt; caring in the slightest what Megatron is and isn&#39;t doing right now, \n&gt; Switchblade heads for the exit of the lab. \n&gt; \n&gt; There was one last change that he needed to test out. In addition \nto \n&gt; transforming into a cassette, Switchblade had modified the cassette \n&gt; mode somewhat, giving it four spiderlike legs, one on each corner. \n&gt; The small cyber bug form was exceptionally weak to attacks, but it \n&gt; sort of made up for it in it&#39;s small size and admirable speed. This \n&gt; mode also allowed him to travel through the ship in the walls with \n&gt; ease.\n&gt; \n&gt; And so, Switchblade&#39;s form shrunk as he transformed into cassette \n&gt; mode. Metallic legs spurted from the corners of the cassette, and \nan \n&gt; optic sensor extended itself a bit from the top of the cassette. \nThe \n&gt; cassette then folded slightly leaving the remainder cyber bug a \n&gt; sleek black-green body, which proceeded to climb up a wall, and let \n&gt; itself into the ventilation. (I wonder if ships have ventilation. \n&gt; The ARE transformers... *shrugs*)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker flies in.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
