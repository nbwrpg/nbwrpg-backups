It was like he was slowly\n&gt; &gt; evolving beneath an old=\r\n skin. And as serpents do, his tail seems to grow a\n&gt; &gt; tiny bit longer wit=\r\nh the shedding of his old skin. Yet this was only\n&gt; &gt; happening in his beas=\r\nt mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Hmm.. Talon, could you scratch behind my neck for me?

Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, =\r\ndragons are thought ta breathe fire,\n&gt; &gt; but you don&#39;t seem ta do that huh?=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson shakes his head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; No, but I do recall being able =\r\nto produce some electrical particles using\n&gt; &gt; the same principle . And whe=\r\nn I roar, it mimics the sound of thunder. I\n&gt; &gt; suspect the old dragon was =\r\nsome sort of elemental master. He breathes\n&gt; &gt; lightning and roars out thun=\r\nder through his vocal chords. I&#39;m beginning to\n&gt; &gt; think he may have past t=\r\nhat down to me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar chuckles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That means when you and=\r\n Talon have a family, your offspring is gonna\n&gt; &gt; inherit that ability. Ya =\r\nnever know, your first kid might end up being a\n&gt; &gt; dragon, or ya might get=\r\n lucky and have one of each. But if it does take\n&gt; &gt; after dear old dad, be=\r\ntter make sure it&#39;s not a fire breather.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson chuckles and rubs =\r\nhis paw on Uproars head, messing up his fur in a\n&gt; &gt; playful manner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see, don&#39;t count the dragons before they hatch.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar c=\r\nontinues to laugh.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; No, seriously, dragons are known ta have more =\r\nthan just one offspring.\n&gt; &gt; They&#39;re like gators and crocs, they tend to ha=\r\nve a clutch of eggs that hatch\n&gt; &gt; into hatchlings. Reptiles and birds norm=\r\nally produce eggs that hatch when\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;ve fully developed. The only exc=\r\neption is, that some snake species\n&gt; &gt; actually bare live young. Now that c=\r\nould happen too, but for the most part,\n&gt; &gt; dragons lay eggs and so do bird=\r\ns. Soooo, you guys might just produce a\n&gt; &gt; small clutch of eggs that need =\r\nta be incubated over a course of time. I\n&gt; &gt; dunno, its just some intel I r=\r\nead on birds and reptiles.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s alright, I&#39;=\r\nve read that too at one point. You&#39;re correct, it could\n&gt; &gt; happen that way=\r\n. Which makes me curious as to other organic properties I\n&gt; &gt; seem to be ex=\r\nperiencing.. Like hunger... I admit, I snapped up a fish from\n&gt; &gt; a near by=\r\n water source and I consumed it in beast mode. And the other\n&gt; &gt; mammals fo=\r\nr some odd reason sparked my appetite. But I didn&#39;t have the\n&gt; &gt; spark to h=\r\nunt them. I merely got a meal from the water instead. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar nods=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Confession, I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mod=\r\ne of\n&gt; &gt; course. And it tasted really good too. I bet Stanton would know wh=\r\nat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; happening to us, right Stanton?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As TUCSON and NIG=\r\nHTSHIFT talked a troubled expression was on BUMP&#39;s\n&gt; face. He glanced over =\r\nat SANTON who only nodded.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You must be careful.&quot; SANTON said as he an=\r\nd BUMP carefully prepared\n&gt; NIGHTSHIFT in an effort to cure him of the spre=\r\nading metallic\n&gt; infection. &quot;Despite the fact that we have these beast mode=\r\ns we are not\n&gt; truly organic life.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BUMP nodded, &quot;We still have gyro s=\r\ntabilizers instead of fluid based\n&gt; inner ear chambers. We have energon pum=\r\nps instead of organic hearts.&quot;\n&gt; He shook his head, &quot;We are not truely beas=\r\nts with genetic codes who\n&gt; lay eggs and such.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a pause as B=\r\nUMP reached over to pull a sensor closer to\n&gt; NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;Just because the=\r\n natural animals do certain things\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that we do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; =\r\nSANTON said, &quot;We do not become animals, we only simulate them\n&gt; closely eno=\r\nugh that we become virtually indistinguishable from them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have ana=\r\nlyzed the infection.&quot; LEGACY said as he turned and faced\n&gt; the others foldi=\r\nng his arms behind his back. &quot;This &#39;infection&#39; is not\n&gt; trying to terminate=\r\n you Nightshift.&quot; LEGACY said in cold\n&gt; matter-of-fact tones. &quot;It is trying=\r\n to strip you of all your organic\n&gt; componants to make you completely Cyber=\r\ntronian.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-5D4B35B3-990F-4BCE-9165-472DCFD23940\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson nods in understand=\r\ning as does Uproar. &nbsp;He then turns to Legacy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&quot; It makes sense as to what is happening to all of us and especially Night=\r\nshift. &nbsp;I agree, we must remember what we are as well as who we are. &=\r\nnbsp;Perhaps it&#39;s best that we are all upgraded to transmetallic status. &n=\r\nbsp;It seems to already be happening to Nightshift, and if that is what is =\r\nintended for us then, we must not fight it. &nbsp;We have to accept it.&quot;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nightshift gives a nod.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; I=\r\n&#39;m game for that, sounds like the right thing ta do. &nbsp;I vote ta let th=\r\nis happen naturally, if that&#39;s what&#39;s intended for me. &quot;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson steps forward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; And I volunte=\r\ner to become one of the first to be converted to a completely trans metalli=\r\nc form.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Straightshot also comes forth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Me next, I vote in for the upgrade.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Rattrap joins her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Same here, I&#39;m in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uproar and Quickstride also come forth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; We want in on it too. &nbsp;It&#39;ll make us all the more formidab=\r\nle against our enemies.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson nods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; If I may, I want their wishes fully granted and acted upon. =\r\n&nbsp;Legacy I trust you know how to commence the trans metallic process, I=\r\n will leave that up to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local artist who specializes in =\r\nillustration, using traditional and digital media. &nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;I also specialize in hand made crafts. &nbsp;Great for any occasion! &nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Need a great gift idea that is original? &nbsp;=\r\nNo problem! &nbsp;Email me at this address and we will talk. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On May 15, 2012, at 9:44 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      =\r\n\n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson sits down on his bed, i=\r\nn dragon mode and rubs his head against&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Talon&#39;s shoulder.

And when I roar, it mimic=\r\ns the sound of thunder.  I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; suspect the old dragon was some sort of=\r\n elemental master.  He breathes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lightning and roars out thunder th=\r\nrough his vocal chords.  I&#39;m beginning to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; think he may have past t=\r\nhat down to me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Uproar chuckles.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tha=\r\nt means when you and Talon have a family, your offspring is gonna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ninherit that ability.  Ya never know, your first kid might end up being a&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; dragon, or ya might get lucky and have one of each.  But if it does=\r\n take&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; after dear old dad, better make sure it&#39;s not a fire breathe=\r\nr.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson chuckles and rubs his paw on Uproars head, mes=\r\nsing up his fur in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; playful manner.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see=\r\n, don&#39;t count the dragons before they hatch.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Uproar cont=\r\ninues to laugh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, seriously, dragons are known ta hav=\r\ne more than just one offspring.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; They&#39;re like gators and crocs, the=\r\ny tend to have a clutch of eggs that hatch&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; into hatchlings.   Rept=\r\niles and birds normally produce eggs that hatch when&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they&#39;ve fully=\r\n developed.  The only exception is, that some snake species&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; actual=\r\nly bare live young.  Now that could happen too, but for the most part,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; dragons lay eggs and so do birds.  Soooo, you guys might just produce =\r\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; small clutch of eggs that need ta be incubated over a course of =\r\ntime.  I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dunno, its just some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve read=\r\n that too at one point.  You&#39;re correct, it could&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; happen that way.=\r\n  Which makes me curious as to other organic properties I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; seem to =\r\nbe experiencing..  Like hunger...  I admit, I snapped up a fish from&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; a near by water source and I consumed it in beast mode.  And the other&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; mammals for some odd reason sparked my appetite.  But I didn&#39;t have=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spark to hunt them.  I merely got a meal from the water inste=\r\nad. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Uproar nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Confession, I took=\r\n down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mode of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; course.  And it =\r\ntasted really good too.  I bet Stanton would know what&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; happening=\r\n to us, right Stanton?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs TUCSON and NIGHTSH=\r\nIFT talked a troubled expression was on BUMP&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\nface. He glanced over at=\r\n SANTON who only nodded.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You must be careful.&quot; SANTON said as he =\r\nand BUMP carefully prepared&lt;br&gt;\nNIGHTSHIFT in an effort to cure him of the =\r\nspreading metallic&lt;br&gt;\ninfection. &quot;Despite the fact that we have these beas=\r\nt modes we are not&lt;br&gt;\ntruly organic life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBUMP nodded, &quot;We still=\r\n have gyro stabilizers instead of fluid based&lt;br&gt;\ninner ear chambers. We ha=\r\nve energon pumps instead of organic hearts.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nHe shook his head, &quot;We are=\r\n not truely beasts with genetic codes who&lt;br&gt;\nlay eggs and such.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nThere was a pause as BUMP reached over to pull a sensor closer to&lt;br&gt;\nNIGHT=\r\nSHIFT, &quot;Just because the natural animals do certain things&lt;br&gt;\ndoesn&#39;t mean=\r\n that we do.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yes.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We do not become animals, we on=\r\nly simulate them&lt;br&gt;\nclosely enough that we become virtually indistinguisha=\r\nble from them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I have analyzed the infection.&quot; LEGACY said as he=\r\n turned and faced&lt;br&gt;\nthe others folding his arms behind his back. &quot;This &#39;i=\r\nnfection&#39; is not&lt;br&gt;\ntrying to terminate you Nightshift.&quot; LEGACY said in co=\r\nld&lt;br&gt;\nmatter-of-fact tones. &quot;It is trying to strip you of all your organic=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\ncomponants to make you completely Cybertronian.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-5D4B35B3-990F-4BCE-9165-472DCFD23940--\r\n\n"}}
