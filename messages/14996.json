She opened her link, &quot;You can&#39;t save \nit Phobia, let&#39;s go.&quot;  She wanted to stay to make sure Phobia made it \nout safely, but she still had her other team mates to think about.\n She entered into the hatch and looked back one last time, &quot;COME ON \nPHOBIA! Let&#39;s get out now!&quot;\n\nShe closed her eyes and jumped out of the hatch.\n\nShe fell to earth.  If felt like an eternity before she hit the \ntrees.  She went craching down, through branches and leaves and \nneedles.  She hit the ground with a thud.  She lay there for a moment \nand looked up into the sky, &quot;Come on Phobia, come on.  Don&#39;t stay to \ndie, come on please.&quot;\n\nShe lowered her head and lay on the ground, wondering how many ribs \nshe broke on the way down.\n\n\n"}}
