He then extends his hand in\n&gt; greeting to Mach Kick and Break.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Noted Sir.  And it&#39;s good to meet both of you.  Hmm, from what I have\n&gt; already observed, Magmatron is a highly established strategist.  You&#39;re\n&gt; right, Big Convoy, getting past him will not be easy.  Then again, my\n&gt; comrades often have a hard time trying to figure me out.  I admit that some\n&gt; of my techniques are completely out of the box but so far, we&#39;ve all\n&gt; survived through some very difficult times.  Which has now led me here, to\n&gt; you.  I know this happened for a very good reason, and if I can get all of\n&gt; you out safely I will.  It&#39;s just going to have to be a little creatively\n&gt; done, if you know what I mean..  And I already have something in mind. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He steps closer to all of them.  As he spoke his voice was kept at a\n&gt; whisper. He continues but lowers it even further to the point where only his\n&gt; new found friends could hear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I noticed that as a Maximal, in beast form, I experienced strong urges to\n&gt; revert to my most primitive of animal instincts.  Mind you, dragons can be\n&gt; extremely aggressive and destructive as well as wise.  I&#39;ve also found my\n&gt; tail and wings to be rather strong.  But most of all, my voice. As the\n&gt; dragon, my roar has a sonic component to it.  This means that through proper\n&gt; harmonics I could stir up a sizable diversion, long enough to get you out of\n&gt; here.  Of course my little reversion will be controlled and as soon as\n&gt; you&#39;re free, I will join you.  If I don&#39;t make it out, at least I know that\n&gt; you will, and then you can rejoin Leo Prime and the others back at the Ark\n&gt; where you belong. This is a risk I am more than willing to take for your\n&gt; freedom.  So, all in favor, shake on it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He keeps his hand extended to his new comrades.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThey all extend their hands to shake TUSCON&#39;s.\n\n&quot;You do realize that there is a weapon suppression system in place?&quot;\nSaid the short dimunative figure of BREAK. &quot;We can use our weapons in\nthe arena, but they have shields up protecting the audience.&quot;\n\nThe somewhat taller MACH KICK bobbed his head up and down, he was a\nbundle of energy. &quot;yes, yes, true enough.&quot;\n\nBIG CONVOY looked around at the others in the room but still continued\nto speak quietly, &quot;I think even that roar of yours you spoke of would\nbe muffled somewhat.&quot;\n\nAs they spoke, one of the soldiers across the room waved at BIG CONVOY\nas if to hush him. Moments later a trio of MAGMATRON&#39;s soldiers walked\ndown the hall, weapons at the ready, their optics flashing as they\nlooked around. They were on the otherside of the caged wall from the\nrest of them, looking through the stout dars at the contents of the\nroom.\n\n&quot;You there!&quot; One of the guards said to TUSCON and the group he was\nwith, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; They looked a lot like SHARKTICONS.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1725501202/view\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
