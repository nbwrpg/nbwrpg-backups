He looked \ncompletly casual as he downloaded the Destron programs into the new \nbot. (If this is moding tell me and I&#39;ll change the post) He spoke as \nhe did this, &quot;There are more Destrons comming to make sure that this \narea has no tresspasors. I am new here, please tell me, are you \nallies of the Destrons? Or do I have to destroy you?&quot;\n     This was just the way he acted around non-Destrons, he didn&#39;t \ntrust them unless Magmatron told him too, he was created a Destron \nand will always be a Destron, for more reasons than just loyality.\n\n\n"}}
