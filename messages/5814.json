All he could think how he&#39;d under reacted to her \ntrick.\n\nThe wolf transformed to bot again and lunged forward pinning the owl \nto the ground.&quot;You let your gaurd down before confirming the game was \nover.&quot; He raised a claw to the owls throat. &quot;So what am I going to do \nwith a dead carcas? \n&quot; He lifted Shadow Wing into the ait claw still poised for the kill.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She knew that this game was more than a game.  It was a test.  She \nwas \n&gt; finding out what he could do.  And he was seeing what she was \ncapable of.  \n&gt; She really didn&#39;t like tricking him like that.  But she wanted him \nto know \n&gt; that She wasn&#39;t a feather brain.(bird joke) She wanted him to know \nthat she \n&gt; could think when she had to and let instinct take over when \nnessessary.  She \n&gt; stopped at a brach about 20 feet off the ground and perched for a \nmoment. \n&gt; She looked up into a tree near her&#39;s and saw another bird. It was a \nnice, \n&gt; fat crow.\n&gt; &quot;How do you like your crow? Rare, Medium or Well done?&quot;\n&gt; She didn&#39;t give him time to answer the question.  she swooped up \nand caught \n&gt; the crow that was sitting in another tree. She flew down and \ndropped it \n&gt; infront of Lunarpine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sorry for the dirty trick I pulled. I&#39;ll be &#39;it&#39; again if you \nwant.&quot;\n&gt; She pushed the crow closer to him. &quot;Peace offering?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
