They quickly began to carefully strip away\nthe tendrils or tentacle like things that sit on top of his frame.\nCarefully, one by one they scan each one and then carefully cut it so\nthat it do as little damage as possible to Rodimus.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; &quot; So now that the Autobots are few in numbers, you think you can just take\n&gt; over this universe as if you were an unstoppable deity. You&#39;ve harmed far\n&gt; too many of those I care for. And what you&#39;ve done to Rodimus,\n&gt; Nightlight, Windlord and Perceptor, are inexcuseable. You have no right\n&gt; to the power you seek, and I will see to it that you never get your hands\n&gt; on it. You think you are powerful just because you have Megatron and\n&gt; Galvatron&#39;s strength within your spark? That means nothing because you\n&gt; haven&#39;t got what truely matters, and that kind of power is not given, it&#39;s\n&gt; earned. I will face you Hydras, I swear by the name of Primus himself, I\n&gt; will face you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not one word comes out of Tucson&#39;s mouth, yet he begins to crack his\n&gt; knuckles audibly as he always does when losing his temper.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon talked Noctorro and Airhammer come walking into the\nobservation chamber, Noctorro having to bend his head slightly to\navoid hitting his horns on the top of the door frame.\n\n&quot;You will not face Hydras alone commander Tuscon.&quot; Silverbolt said. He\nhad been standing in the room from before Tuscon had entered, his\noptics never leaving Rodimus&#39; frame. His arms were crossed over his\nchest, his optics focused and bright as they looked through the\nwindow. He spoke without turning, &quot;We fuzors stand with you.&quot; he said\nquietly, his voice low with that air of dramatics that always seemed\nto be a part of him. &quot;The black villany that has been worked on\nRodimus must be avenged.&quot;\n\nNoctorro and Airhammer nodded as they stood next to Silverbolt.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; &quot;is all Alright?&quot;said dryly the Predacon whe sensed that something unusual\n&gt; was happening to Tucson Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup looked at Tucson and waited his answetr as well as Talon\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFrom inside the medical chamber a small alarm began to beep, and\nLegacy&#39;s voice could be heard, &quot;Rodimus Prime&#39;s vitals are continuing\nto decline. We need to move with greater haste.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am a doctor, not a miracle worker.&quot; Bump could be heard grumbling\nas they all began to work faster on Rodimus, some of the tendrils lay\non the floor, but many more still lay attached to him.\n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\n"}}
