No worries. Who knows, my dexterity\n&gt; could really improve after the upgrade.  Kinda hard ta be acrobatic when ya\n&gt; gotta work around a body shell of a sport utility vehicle. When I get inta\n&gt; my new form, I can show ya what I mean.  I used ta do a lotta night club&#39;n\n&gt; after hours, and believe it or not, that&#39;s where I actually met Tucson.  He\n&gt; was just out hav&#39;n a good time, bust&#39;n some pretty hot dance moves on the\n&gt; floor.  Oh yeah, we met at the Blue Diode.  Anyway one night we met up there\n&gt; with a couple of femme bots, one night and I tried ta play matchmaker, but\n&gt; Tucson was a bit shy around femmes.  Although he still had a good time with\n&gt; them, but just on a friendship basis, noth&#39;n serious.  Well one night we\n&gt; were just hang&#39;n out, and it was before I knew how good he really was on the\n&gt; dance floor.  He was modest about that too but, I dragged his aft out on the\n&gt; floor and I got him ta bust the moves and slag did he bust some serious\n&gt; moves out on that dance floor.  You should&#39;ve seen the looks on the faces of\n&gt; the hot rods when Tucson got his groove go&#39;n .  So I joined in on the fun\n&gt; and we&#39;ve been best buds ever since.  For the record, he can still bust the\n&gt; moves, and so can I.  When things calm down, I&#39;ll see what I can do ta\n&gt; gather some club tunes, so we can all have some much needed fun.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The ship moves, causing Nightshift to move painfully.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ow!
