The self \npreservation of the program dictated that she not go into stasis \nlock.  But she had no choise at this point.\n\nRight then, her body shook as the maximal program returned and took \nover.  She had little knowlage of the discussion about going into \nstasis.  She simply kept walking, and didn&#39;t reply.  But she was \nstarting to get worried about these momentary black outs.  While her \ntrainer side stayed ever alert to what was going on. But she \nremembered being told that she was going tothe Cybertron Fire just to \nget checked out.\n\n&quot;So how is Cybertron Fire. Hope everyone back there is ok.&quot; \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but its a security breach. You \nneed to \n&gt; be in stasis, and you&#39;ll need to have anti-scanning devices all \naround you if \n&gt; you wish to get into the CF. Its the Maximal base, and a known \nthreat can&#39;t \n&gt; be allowed in without precaution.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
