Without sound or warning his body became sharp metal sheet expanding 12 feet upwards right directly under the armpits of the minion.\n&gt; Malice/ Organics/ Hellplague/ Splattercannon:\n&gt; \n&gt; The bounty hunter dis engaged the cannon and returned it to it&#39;s \n&gt; sword state.  He held it at the ready and slowly approached the \n&gt; hostage takers.  His body continued to glow brightly, even though a \n&gt; signifigant amount of power went into his cannon blast.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Just hurry up and help!&gt; Organics thought as Nightlight \n&gt; acknowlegded.  She was injured, in enemy hands, and now almost \n&gt; unconscious.  Hellplague had her off the ground, her feet mere \n&gt; inches from the dirt.  Malice was on his steady advance, and stopped \n&gt; standing next to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Sweep commander sneered as Malice approached.  She tightened her \n&gt; hold on Organics&#39; neck, causing her more discomfort.  \n&gt; &lt;Soon, Unicron will have the Matrix Bearer, a new follower, and I \n&gt; will have my lizard as a pet.&gt;\n&gt; Hellplague chuckled, and leered down at Malice.\n&gt; &quot;Yes, come here.  Bow down before me, worship me, and I might spare \n&gt; your sister.  Become my servant, and all will be forgiven.&quot; she \n&gt; laughed.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Splattercannon took position behind the hostage takers, holding his \n&gt; gatling rifle ready to waste anyone who moved without permission.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight/BlackNightmare/Hydras/Windlord/Rodimus:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Windlord still was aimed to HellPlague&#39;s head and readi to take \n&gt; any \n&gt; &gt; chance to save Organics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus opened a com lin to Proto and said &quot;What ever you will do \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to hurt her&quot; after the com lik was closed he looked at \n&gt; &gt; HellPlague and tried to find out quickly what to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *********\n&gt; &gt; BlackNightmare was pleased with the idea of hostage and said &quot;Then \n&gt; &gt; we have to give this little gift to Unicron... perhaps he could \n&gt; give \n&gt; &gt; her a perfect use...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightstrike whispered &quot;Why not take Prime???? it&#39;s most wort than \n&gt; &gt; this one and it seems that he&#39;s most than willing to be a \n&gt; voluntary \n&gt; &gt; hostage...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Hydras picked up the com link and looking to MAxima said &quot;Come lil \n&gt; &gt; one... we will have some fun after all&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And leaves the base\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; **********\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nigthlight/Sedna picked up the com link and send aencoded message \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; Organics &quot;Hold on...
