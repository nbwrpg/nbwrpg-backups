Not, like, help you, like decorate!  \nI--&quot;\n\nThe Predacon stopped talking as he heard a loud whisting sound, two missiles \npassing by him, exploding against Injector and Bumblebee&#39;s chests, sending \nthem both crashing to the ground.\n\nScattershot gulped.  &quot;I&#39;ve decided to come help!&quot; he yelled, transforming \ninto his bald eagle mode, heading for the Alliance base, boosters engaged.\n\n---\n\nPyro cursed loudly, feeling something land on his cannon and go into the \nforest, the fires he started not fanning far enough out to stop them.  And \nthe heavy weight of the two Maximals had been on his cannon.  Luckily, it \nwasn&#39;t a long, somewhat thin cannon.  It was short and big.  If it had been \nany other way, it may have bent or got stuck.  \n\nTwirling his black cannon, he fired off three fireballs a few feet to the \nleft of the direction of Dinobot, the shots hitting a tree.  Driving forward, \nhe slammed into a tree, knocking it down.  \n\n&quot;I&#39;LL KILL YOU!&quot; he screamed, sending a wave of flames out to the side of \nhim, lighting up several trees.\n\n---\n\nPunch, Breakdown, and Hiss ran through the forest, seeing a scaly tail \ndisappear into trees, Breakdown firing a grenade at where the tail had been, \nthe Predacons fanning out.\n\n\n---\n\nShockwave transformed to robot mode, landing on the ground, looking around.  \nSeeing a green Predacon heading after the two Maximals that had been \nretreating.  Raising the laser weapon that took the place of his left hand, \nhe fired off two shots, each digging precisely into the back of Manterror&#39;s \nleft knee, sending him crashing down to the ground.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch leapt over Manterror, entering the forest, running as fast as he \ncould, getting a reading of where Dinobot was, not going to where he was \nthough.  He would cut them off, and try and chase them back to the Alliance \nmembers.\n\n---\n\nThe CR chamber slid open, Nemesis Enforcer stepping out, stretching slightly. \n &quot;Bon of a slag!&quot; \n\nHe activated his comm. unit on his wrist, speaking into it louldy.  \n&quot;REQUESTING ORDERS, SIR!!!&quot;\n\n"}}
