She glanced at the \nexternal monitor and saw that there were two bots at the ship&#39;s \nentrance.  She sighed and walked out of the lab.  She had a lot on \nher mind and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that LadyHawk was hiding \nsomething.  She finally got to the entrance and opened the hatch.\n&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; She looked down and saw a bot in bad need of \ncare.(LIFE)  She looked at the other one. &quot;If you can carry him, I&#39;ll \ntake you to the CR lab and we can get you both fixed up. By the way, \nI&#39;m Squizzy. Pleased to meet you. Now hurry, that one looks like he&#39;s \ngot one foot in the matrix already.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
