The score is 106 \n&gt; f=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; the Ballers and 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has been \nt=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University is 30 for \n=\r\n34 \n&gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 \npoints. =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; But can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the \nfirst=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; rank Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see what happens.  \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the \ngame. \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A bot wea=\r\nring a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes the ball in to \na \n&gt; &gt; bot wearing=\r\n a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the ball \n&gt; &gt; down the court =\r\nand passes it to a bot with a jersey that \nsays &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bob then pa=\r\nsses it to Bentals and Bentals passes it a bot with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; jersey that s=\r\nays &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals and \n&gt; &gt; Bentals passes it t=\r\no Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point line \nand \n&gt; &gt; jumps up making it l=\r\nook like a jump shot.  At the last second he \n&gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bo=\r\nt, which is by the goal, whose jersey \n&gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams th=\r\ne ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  \nBots \n&gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the b=\r\nall.  The bots jersey \n&gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a =\r\nbot with a jersey \n&gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)=\r\n  Rauq starts \n&gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when he trips over his ow=\r\nn feet.  \nThe \n&gt; &gt; ball leaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo=\r\n, who is \n&gt; &gt; standing behind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The =\r\nball \n&gt; &gt; sails into the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Court Side An=\r\nnouncer:  HOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n106.  \n&gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ W=\r\nIN!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Go=\r\nrzo jersey 5 years earlier was in \na \n&gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle.  He is Fl=\r\nying around Earth.  All of a \nsudden \n&gt; &gt; the right wing catches on fire an=\r\nd falls down towards Earth as \nthe \n&gt; &gt; shuttle falls down with the wing.  =\r\nThe shuttle lands near Mid-\nAfrica \n&gt; &gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys C=\r\nharacters are.\n\n\n"}}
