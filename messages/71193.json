Slight fluxuation in energy flow..  Means we got =\r\npower but not a stable supply...  Okay, that can be remedied.  Now, let&#39;s s=\r\nee...  I hope Wheeljack&#39;s lab is still useable, I don&#39;t think Tucson would =\r\nallow me in his..&quot;\n\nHe punches the code to access Wheeljacks&#39; old lab, and =\r\nnot surprisingly enough, it was a bit of a mess.\n\n&quot;Ohh boy.  Wow, I&#39;m sure =\r\nI&#39;ll definitely find what I need in here.  But first, to the drawing board.=\r\n.  Yeah, if I - can find it.&quot;  \n\nHe couldn&#39;t help but trip over things but =\r\nbeing careful not to break any of the materials and tools inside. Being rig=\r\nht next to Tucson&#39;s work lab, Straight Shot could hear him stumbling about =\r\ninside. She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, but she also knew that he could use =\r\na hand.  Yet, she did not want to leave Elita alone.  She brings the tiny c=\r\nub with her, and bravely goes where no bot had dared before.  Inside Wheelj=\r\nacks&#39; laboratory.\n\n&quot;Woah, what - a mess.  Quickstride, are you sure you rea=\r\nlly wanna work in here?&quot;\n\nHe looks to her, as something bonks off his head.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Ow.  Yeah, I&#39;m sure, I don&#39;t think it would be wise for us ta use Tucson=\r\n&#39;s lab, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d want anything touched.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Hey, he&#39;s the one who suggested making some of those changes.  I&#39;m sure he=\r\n wouldn&#39;t mind you using his lab.  Besides, it&#39;s safer and everything you n=\r\need is readilly available. Just make sure everything goes back where you fi=\r\nnd it.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;On second thought, yeah, maybe it is better i=\r\nf I work in his lab. Okay, let&#39;s do it.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot now works with Quic=\r\nkstride in Tucson&#39;s laboratory, while still holding Elita.  She shows the c=\r\nub where Research and Development happens, as Quickstride goes to work on d=\r\nrawing something up on the drawing board.\n\n&quot; See, he&#39;s just starting with t=\r\nhe development stage, and after that, once he draws up a few rough composit=\r\nions, he&#39;ll show them to Rodimus and the others, and the one Rodimus thinks=\r\n will work best, he&#39;ll develop further, and refine this into a blue print. =\r\n From there, blue prints turn into prototypes, and then prototypes are test=\r\ned, and if they work, then, more of the product is manufactured based on te=\r\nst results.&quot;\n\nQuickstride smiles while working.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, hopefully w=\r\ne&#39;ll come up with something... But I&#39;m a little lost as ta how ta start thi=\r\ns..  We gotta make it high enough but not conspicuous... We wouldn&#39;t want i=\r\nt to be shot down by our enemy..&quot;\n\nStraight Shot ponders.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that coul=\r\nd be a problem..  I remember physics..  We&#39;d have to construct something th=\r\nat functions yet fits to form..  There&#39;s a lot of high peaks around here an=\r\nd maybe we could take a look at which one would actually fit the device bes=\r\nt..&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;True.  We gotta see the area before we can actua=\r\nlly drum up something.  I know, why don&#39;t I try to get some mini probes out=\r\n there and see what they can photograph for us?  That way, we&#39;ll know how t=\r\no construct the alternate turbine and then take it from there.&quot;\n\nStraight S=\r\nhot nodds.\n\n&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot;\n\nQuickstride heads to Rodimus but is care=\r\nful not to be too noisy.\n\n&quot;Sir, Straight Shot and I are working in Tucson&#39;s=\r\n lab now, and before we can start, we need to get a geographical layout of =\r\nthe surrounding parameter.  It appears we need a high peak of some sort to =\r\ncarry the weight of the wind mill structure.  It would hide the device from=\r\n harm, and basically keep the environment the same without harming it. I&#39;m =\r\ngoing to send some mini probes out there to photograph the area.  Once I ge=\r\nt those back, I&#39;ll be able to draw up something.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quick=\r\nstride was happy to know that Rodimus approved his idea for the\n&gt; windmill.=\r\n He looks over to Perceptor with an encouraging grin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heey, no wor=\r\nries Perceptor, if we go eco, we&#39;ll be able to be at full\n&gt; power without a=\r\nctually draining any energy from this planet, therefore, it\n&gt; preserves our=\r\n environment, and our base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank yo=\r\nu sir. Now that we have your okay, I&#39;ll start drawing up some\n&gt; sketches an=\r\nd see which one actually fits the landscape. We want it to be a\n&gt; little bi=\r\nt hidden from view, ya know what&#39;ll happen if it&#39;s visible, right?\n&gt; Anyway=\r\n, I&#39;ll get right on it as soon as repairs are all done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ro=\r\ndimus nodded and smiled at Quickstride, &quot;Good you get on it. Give me or\n&gt; L=\r\negacy a progress report as to how it is going.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned to go t=\r\nowards the medical bay, eager to see his wife and\n&gt; child again after so lo=\r\nng. It may have only been a short while, but it felt\n&gt; like ages since he h=\r\nad seen his daughter last.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Rodi=\r\nmus and follows him. Yet it was the first time\n&gt; she ever spent considerabl=\r\ne time away from Tucson which to her was a new\n&gt; experience. For years they=\r\n had stuck very much together, being brother and\n&gt; sister, but also very cl=\r\nose as target masters. Yet, Rodimus still made a\n&gt; very good impression on =\r\nher as she gladly trots up beside him. Being as\n&gt; small as she was, it was =\r\nrather difficult to keep up with his stride.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Sorry, I promise ta =\r\nkeep up with ya, it&#39;s just hard &#39;cause of my size.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride chu=\r\nckles a bit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll forgive ya Straight Shot. After all, =\r\nthis is something\n&gt; you&#39;re not used to.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39; smile was=\r\n bright as he walked, he was about to see his family, the\n&gt; Maximals were s=\r\nafe, and perhaps they would have some time for repairs.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned as Q=\r\nuickstride walked up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Straight Shot&#39;s not used ta be=\r\n&#39;n outside her holster for long periods of\n&gt; time. She might seem a little =\r\nshy at times, but it&#39;s nothing personal Sir.\n&gt; It appears that she&#39;s much m=\r\nore used to being holstered behind Tucson&#39;s back\n&gt; than she is when she&#39;s i=\r\nn robot mode. But I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll open up in due\n&gt; time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nI understand.&quot; He said as he slowed the pace of his walk for the somewhat\n&gt;=\r\n shorter Straight Shot to keep up, he could not help but feel an urgency to=\r\n\n&gt; get to the medical bay. But instead of letting that show he just turned =\r\na\n&gt; bright smile on Straight Shot, &quot;I am sure she will do just fine Quickst=\r\nride.\n&gt; Just fine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This willbe a very easy task for =\r\nyou Straight&quot;said PErceptor with a\n&gt; slight\n&gt; &gt; emotion in his voice, It wa=\r\ns hard to say that if was sarcastic or not&quot;You\n&gt; &gt; will babysit Elita for a=\r\n while and after Nighlight is awake, you will\n&gt; &gt; babysitt the mom... For a=\r\n while any way&quot;and looking to Rodimus said\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ramulus, so far I remember,=\r\n had left Elita inside the Medical bay and run\n&gt; &gt; th the Battle &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPerceptor typed some buttons and tried to find ut where are all the bots\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; that were in stasis inside the Ark, he alse send instructions to the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncomputer to prepare the medical bay for all the stuff that they might\n&gt; nee=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A map appeared directing Perceptor to where the stasis p=\r\nods were located. It\n&gt; was not all that far from his current location.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The computer took in Perceptor&#39;s instruction and attempted to comply,\n&gt; ho=\r\nwever is some of its system resources were still down it would be some\n&gt; ti=\r\nme before it would be able to complete it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to Perceptor,=\r\n &quot;I will make repairs. Continue on your mission.&quot;\n&gt; He turned to walk off.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot smiles. She always loved to be around Elit=\r\na, and was happy\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; have the job.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, I&#39;d be very happy to l=\r\nook after Elita. Poor thing, she&#39;s been through\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; much.. And not to =\r\nworry, Perceptor, if any intruder dares to come anywhere\n&gt; &gt; near her or Ni=\r\nghtlight, they&#39;ll have plenty of arrows up their afts, trust\n&gt; me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus walked into the medical bay along with Perceptor and=\r\n Straight\n&gt; Shot he could see Ramulus sitting in one of the chairs, obvious=\r\nly he himself\n&gt; was in need of repairs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rodimus.&quot; Ramulus said as he =\r\nrose to his feet. &quot;I have to get to the\n&gt; recharge chambers, but your wife =\r\nand child are there.&quot; Ramulus pointed at a\n&gt; far bed where Elita lay sleepi=\r\nng on Nightlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus turned to look as Straight shot went over to=\r\n them . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds, as she gently takes E=\r\nlita into her own arms, cradling\n&gt; her body securely.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As St=\r\nraight Shot carried her out of the room, he could not help but give her\n&gt; a=\r\n sad look. He longed to hold his daughter in his arms and hug her himself.\n=\r\n&gt; But then his optics turned to look at Nightlight, &quot;Perceptor. How is she?=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus talked the lights in the room dimmed for a moment and the=\r\nn came\n&gt; back with more light. Obviously someone, probably Legacy, was maki=\r\nng repairs\n&gt; to some of the vital systems. Lights around the room began to =\r\nblink green,\n&gt; most of them were ready for use.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
