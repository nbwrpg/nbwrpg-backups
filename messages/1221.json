He didn&#39;t like \nher her tone for that moment. It sounded like an order, but he went along \nwith it. &quot;A fire is not needed.&quot; He hurried behind her and grabbed Striker \nfrom her arms.\n\nHe went to the far side of the cave, to where he had a few piles of furs. He \nhurled Striker&#39;s body onto the stoned ground. He hadn&#39;t treated Quickstrike \nthis way, but he already knew now that other bots were around that could \nmean harm to him and his freedom.\n\nHe shifted over and grabbed up a few blankets of furs, and put them over \nStriker. As he did so, he noticed the Maximal symbol on him, the one he once \nhad behind his heavy fur on his shoulder. He sighed, and went on.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a Maximal,&quot; he mumbled. He thought to himself, then said, &quot;Maybe I \ncould get some questions out of him.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
