She definitely sees \nthat Hydras is the main attacker. Wolfenstein is a threat too.\n\nKatya: What is the range of your weapons, Blackfang?\n\nBlackfang: My shotgun can fire up to mid-range, and my pulse laser \nonly to short range.\n\nKatya thinks a moment.\n\nKatya: Okay. I will make a hit-and-run while you remain covered and \ntry to take that wolfboy out. After that, go back in the trees.\n\nBlackfang nods. She starts running, still far from the Predacons and \nopens fire with her heavy large and medium lasers. She aims mainly \nHydras. Blackfang starts pumping four energy shots at Wolfenstein.\nHe then fall back in the trees.\n\nKatya: Star Colonel, the kills are yours. Skill, Ragnar!\n\nRagnar: Skill, Katya! Kup, Aerotaur, Windlord, Empath, concentrate \nyour fire on my targets, the main Pred force. Forget about honor, take \nall the targets you want.\n\nHe locks his missiles on Wolfenstein and lets them loose on him along \nwith a large laser, while he shoots the other large laser at Hydras as \nwell as a supersonic gauss slug.\n\nRagnar: Maximals, today, we rid this planet of the scum that stains \nit!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;d say we have to distract those goons before they knock the \n&gt; shields out.&quot;  Wheeljack indicates Hydras&#39;s group.  &quot;The defense \ngrid \n&gt; has all it can handle just fending off the Preds&#39; friends over \n&gt; there.&quot;  He points out Devilcat and Gatara, blazing away with \n&gt; repeated bursts from their weapons of choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CatMaster o&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Inferno was blasting whildly away with energy blasts against the\n&gt; &gt; maximal shilds while Waspinator fired explosive stingers from his \n&gt; hand\n&gt; &gt; held weapon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kenzo ran to join up with with Kup and Wheeljack-X &quot;You guys have \n&gt; any\n&gt; &gt; ideas?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pumpskin chortles as he blazes away indiscriminately with his \neye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lasers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Hydras landed and his body seemed to bolt out fire from every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vein.
