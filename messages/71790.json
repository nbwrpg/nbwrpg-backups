He could see the\ntension that was rising. SCOURGE had stood up as well as SKY SHADOW,\nboth of them ready to defend HYDRAS.\n\n&quot;Fire at his majesty and that will be the last move you make.&quot; The\nvoice was INFERNO, his blaster already in hand. &quot;Answer him, Now!&quot;\n\nTARANUTLUS smiled wickedly, &quot;Yes, answer him.&quot;\n\nCRYOTEK sighed as he looked back at HYDRAS, &quot;Alright then, for you my\nstudent I will answer.&quot;\n\nHe sat down again and under the watchful gaze of the others he began to speak.\n\n&quot;My generals were made from the core sparks that I had found.&quot; CRYOTEK\nlooked up, &quot;Honestly when I found them I didn&#39;t know what they were.\nBut when I scanned them I saw the power in them.&quot; He shook his head in\nsorrow.\n\n&quot;But as you built them you realized what they were.&quot; Taratulus said as\nhe leaned on the table looking at CRYOTEK. &quot;You knew it and ignored\nit.&quot;\n\nCRYOTEK looked as if he were about to get angry again but then with a\nglance around the table he just sighed, &quot;Yes. It was too much of an\noppotunity to pass up.&quot;\n\nWith a smug nod and smile TARANTULUS straightened and crossed his arms\nover his chest. &quot;And there is your connection Hydras. Cryotek&#39;s\ngenerals were Unicronian in origin and when we scanned Rodimus we also\nscanned something that resembled it too.&quot;\n\nSCOURGE nodded, &quot;And the sweeps were picking up some of it too.&quot;\nSCOURGE frowned as he stood up his chair falling back behind him. &quot;I\nhave just lost contact with the sweeps.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
