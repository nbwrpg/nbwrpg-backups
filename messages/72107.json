You may call me WHEELIE if you want this\n&gt; way.&quot;  Walking along with the two if they led him, but letting them go in\n&gt; &#39;front&#39; of him to lead.  &quot;And I must say, you speak weird to me this way.\n&gt; Which of us right, in what manner words come to light?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Keeping the two in front of him where, hopefully as he followed he could\n&gt; surreptitiously keep them &#39;covered&#39; wtih his weapon if they were leading to\n&gt; ambush, and have a moment if it came to worst he could disengage befor ethey\n&gt; could fire on him.  still playing up the role of the addled Autobot.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFIREHORN nodded and turned towards the building, seemingly having no\ntrouble walking in front of WHEELIE, in fact his leading WHEELIE\ninside would seemingly leave the gate unguarded, unless one turned\naround to see another figure, looking nearly identicle to FIREHORN\nstep out and take his place.\n\nASTRA walked along side WHEELIE looking down at him curiously. &quot;I\nwould thing that it is your speech that is strange.&quot; She said with a\nshrug, &quot;I have never heard one speak the like.&quot; She walked also with\nher axe, but she was using more like a walking stick, her position\nrelaxed and even curious.\n\nShe paused for a moment and then looked back, &quot;Yours is the\nstrangeness of speech, since I would think it would put some things\nout of reach.&quot; She smiled as she spoke.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you go aping him Astra!&quot; FIREHORN said as he reached the door\nway to the structure. &quot;He can&#39;t help that he speaks strangely.&quot;\n\nThe door slid open to reveal a large chamber inside. At the inside of\nthe door there were two other figures that looked like FIREHORN and\nASTRA, atleast in basic construction and form. They both also had\nlarge axes that were held straight up in cerimonial fashion, both\nhands grasping them firmly.\n\nThey nodded as FIREHORN and ASTRA, who nodded back, their movements\nstrangly regal and dignified.\n\n&quot;Unus is in here.&quot; ASTRA said to WHEELIE as she gestured for him to\ncome inside with them, no longer attempting to use his ryming speech.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
