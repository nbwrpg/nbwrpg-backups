She couldn&#39;t believe\n&gt; that a bot could live that long.  She couldn&#39;t help but feel a little\n&gt; respect for a bot that had survived all odds and made it. She would\n&gt; have smiled if she could. She knew that this bot could teach her a\n&gt; lot and she was willing to learn.  Then she heard him say he was\n&gt; going to leave. &quot;Oh no please, don&#39;t leave.&quot;  She had just found\n&gt; contact with another and didn&#39;t want to be left alone again. Not in\n&gt; her state, not without control of her own form. She hated this\n&gt; feeling of complete helplessness.  &quot;Please stay.  I have many\n&gt; questions for you. Please?&quot; She did have questions, but was more\n&gt; worried about being alone right now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis listened to Shadow Wing carefully trying to hear if she\n&gt; &gt; understood. he tried not to laugh. Shadow Wing was like a new\n&gt; child.,\n&gt; &gt; filled with wonder and curiosity.Everything was &quot;Why&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I began hundreds of years ago, back before the Maximals and\n&gt; &gt; Predacons began being so stubborn about thier titles and functions.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; was a scientist trying to figure out the advantages of\n&gt; colinization.\n&gt; &gt; I was at a potential settlement when we experienced a cave in. My\n&gt; &gt; scanners took over and located a bloodthirst nocturnal creature\n&gt; &gt; called a Veratis hence the name. My settlement continued in that\n&gt; &gt; cavefor over 100 years. When we were finally rescued I was sent\n&gt; &gt; elsewhere. I found a planet called Avaria. It was remarkable, plant\n&gt; &gt; and Animal life spread through the entire system. There were\n&gt; already\n&gt; &gt; Translife forms present, it was our job to help them adapt.\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately a plague of insecticons plundered through the system\n&gt; &gt; destroying all life they encountered. We had to do something to\n&gt; &gt; prevent Avaria from becoming a dead planet. We scanned the worlds\n&gt; &gt; that were destroyed and the planets they avoided. The biggest\n&gt; &gt; difference was a dominance of avian creatures. It turned out that\n&gt; &gt; these creatures thrived on insect life. The insecticons natural\n&gt; &gt; instinct to survive did the rest. I integrated the qualities of the\n&gt; &gt; avian creatures into the settlers DNA and they wiped the planet\n&gt; clean\n&gt; &gt; of insecticons. As a reward for my contributions ?I was given a\n&gt; &gt; member of the highest function to care for as an apprentice, a\n&gt; &gt; student. I learned to care for her as a daughter. (Lady Hawk)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I guided her in the study of courtesy, Status, and the words of the\n&gt; &gt; great leaders. I&#39;ve been studying the Destiny of Prime. The Great\n&gt; &gt; Autobot leader stated he would &quot;Leave us till the day when all are\n&gt; &gt; one.&quot; I believe that it&#39;s the day when cybertron and all the\n&gt; colonies\n&gt; &gt; realize that Maximal and Predacon, Autobot and Decepticon, Aviabot\n&gt; &gt; and Insecticon, the titles don&#39;t matter, only the robot seperates\n&gt; us\n&gt; &gt; from the beasts. I help because I believe in the day Prime\n&gt; predicted\n&gt; &gt; and I believe I have the capability to help it along.&quot; He paused to\n&gt; &gt; let his tale sink in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;One night I was relaxing in a district station waiting for my\n&gt; cargo\n&gt; &gt; to be aproved when a young Maximal(Foxfingers) bumped into me at\n&gt; full\n&gt; &gt; sprint. He&#39;d been hurt pretty badly by a Predacon named Termitron.\n&gt; &gt; The station as it turned out was under Pred law. I didn&#39;t want to\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; involved in a legal squabble but unfortunately the Predacons didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; care.Myself and the young Maximal took care of business and he was\n&gt; &gt; placed in my custody to be returned at my convenience. We&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; traveling the universe together since doing good on every planet we\n&gt; &gt; choose.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I detected a large amount of Translife forms on this planet and\n&gt; &gt; decided to investigate. Lunarpine found me and I agreed to help.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Veratis relaxed, the story and the stress causing problems to his\n&gt; &gt; system. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me I must rest.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She was relieved to hear that Luanrpine was alright. She still\n&gt; felt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cold and wasn&#39;t sure why.  She felt drained and almost exhausted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though she didn&#39;t know why.
