He is not the long winded sort, and so\n&gt; stays =\r\nlargely quiet in all of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahh yes, you were a Maximal at one time=\r\n weren&#39;t you?&quot; BANTOR said to\n&gt; the new and improved DINOBOT, &quot;First Predac=\r\non, then Maximal and now\n&gt; Predacon again?&quot; He said as he tilted his head i=\r\nn DINBOT&#39;s direction.\n&gt; &quot;You seemed to have had an upgrade or two.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BA=\r\nNTOR gestured at DINOBOT&#39;s frame, &quot;You look more like the old\n&gt; Megatron no=\r\nw, before he went all draconish.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile on the otherside of the cl=\r\nearing SKYSHADOW was still looking\n&gt; at HYDRAS awaiting his next words and =\r\nLEO was standing towards the\n&gt; middle of the clearing, a growing sense of a=\r\ngitation.\n&gt; \n&gt; WINGCALIBER, TORCA and SANTON were standing next to him, wai=\r\nting on\n&gt; the small sidebar conference to end while NOCTORRO was pacing aro=\r\nund,\n&gt; obviously letting his own sense of impatience get the better of him.=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThat erupted in a laugh over from DINOBOT, &quot;Oh, yes.  One memb=\r\ner of your team whom got a teammate killed, and another for whom is directl=\r\ny threatening the others.  You seem to have an excellent taste in comrades,=\r\n CONVOY.&quot;  Hissing over at the MAXIMALS.\n\n&quot;Regardless, make up your mind?  =\r\nWhat will it be, Maximals?  Will you be threatening us for every single wor=\r\nd exchanged and threatening to assault us while out of the other end of you=\r\nr vocalizer saying you need our help?  If you wish our assistance, decide w=\r\nhat it will be.  That requires you to eitehr cooperate with us and make a g=\r\nood show or you can go into the jungle on your own.&quot;\n\nDINOBOT was baiting, =\r\nattempting to drive a wedge between the MAXIMALS to either force LEO PRIME =\r\nto discipline them and undermine his authority, or letting them go on which=\r\n would probably lead to greater and greater tension in the field, and would=\r\n give the PREDACONS more changes for disruption should they find a way to a=\r\nbandon the MAXIMALS.  Or to get LEO PRIME to admit more of what was going o=\r\nn.\n\nFinally, DINOBOT went to up the escalation, taking over the cue of nego=\r\ntiation from HYDRAS.  &quot;And for our cooperation in this we have a price.  A =\r\nstasis pod with an intact protoform and a spark.  There will be no basis fo=\r\nr negotiation otherwise.  It would have been free given  the necessity,b ut=\r\n given your troops have not even entered the combat zone and are pointing f=\r\nully armed weapons at us and threatening assault when we have given no thre=\r\nat ourselves, there is now a price for our cooperation.  Since clearly we c=\r\nannot trust Maximal honor from a leader whom has no qualms about permitting=\r\n his own personal troops to do as they wish and threaten a parlay he himsel=\r\nf invited.  So, you wish our cooperation, pay our hand for it or go in on y=\r\nour own.&quot;\n\nOOC - Anyways, Hydras/Leo Prime, this is DINOBOT taking a cue to=\r\n try and drive a wedge further into the Maximals and Leo Prime&#39;s authority,=\r\n given they&#39;re giving him a rather significant opening, and given his data =\r\nfiles over on them.  He&#39;s going to try and bait them directly to either dis=\r\nrupt things for further chaos later.  IT&#39;s a more subtle and Predacon thing=\r\n to do, so I&#39;ll let you decide where to run with it.  And Hydras, request y=\r\nou let DINOBOT play it out then given you would probably trust him in this =\r\nand it humilaites the Maximals as well.\n\n\n"}}
