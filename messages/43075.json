We come from many centuries after the tenth great war. We \n&gt; Angelions are the children of both Maximals and Predacons. \n&gt; Transformers from our time live in peace and harmony altogether. \n&gt; However, since the discovery of transwarp technology, time has been \n&gt; altered. This whole war IS a disruption of its own.\n&gt; As for our weapons... they are inside us, parts of us like bones or \n&gt; veins. We demand that you trust us that we will not use them. \nShould \n&gt; this be a trap, however, it would be an illogical one. We are only \n&gt; two, and all the factions here are more than enough to obliterate \nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Ramiel made another call for the conference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramiel:\n&gt; To all factions, we are Angelions. We are organizing a conference, \n&gt; and we need one unarmed representant of each faction to join us.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Liono::\n&gt; &gt; Liono eyes grow wide as he thinks for a moment. &quot;Your here about \n&gt; the time \n&gt; &gt; disruptions?&quot; Liono&#39;s tone changes and grows a little more \n&gt; offensive as he \n&gt; &gt; uncross his arms. &quot;I&#39;m Liono guardian of the Ark and one of three \n&gt; Matrix \n&gt; &gt; masters. Cybertron should be grateful that they haven&#39;t suffered \n&gt; anymore \n&gt; &gt; than they have.
