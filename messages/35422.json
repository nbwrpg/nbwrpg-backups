Obviously\nCliffjumper disliked this leader, so he didnt want to get to attached,\nas he knew Cliffjumper well, and he had a certain know how to what\nhappens. After much thinking he decides to stay where he is, further\naway from the crowd. He leans over against a wall, and keeps an eye on\nwhat is happening.\n\nCliffjumper roared across the African terrain, thinking, blowing off\nsteam, and most importantly weighing his options. He was not sure what\nto make of this situation, and even less sure if there were any groups\nbetter than the Maximals. What has this universe come to, he asked\nhimself. He then noticed to strange robots (Klant, Torca). He quickly\nstops and transforms, pulling out his pistol, and keeping quiet.\n\n"}}
