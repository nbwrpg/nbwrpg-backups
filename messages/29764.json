He laughs when \nMegatron explains why he had come here.\n\n&quot;Right,&quot; he says, his tone indicating what he thought of Megatron&#39;s \nexplanation. &quot;You came here, nearly dead from lack of energon, simply \nto restore me to be a leader of a long-extinct faction. I&#39;m honored.&quot;\n\nHis chain gun flips to his hand again, firing off a round that barely \nmisses Megatron&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not a fool, Megatron, and I know you arn&#39;t one either. I will \nexpect the truth from you next time.&quot;\n\nHis chain gun flips back into his wrist. &quot;Now, would you care to \nrestate your reasons for being here?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron used one of his arms to stabilize (I dont know how to \nspell this\n&gt; one jeff, if your gonna tell me do it privately ;P) his cannon. He \nstood\n&gt; sideways looking Autofire over. Over his years he always made sure \nto keep\n&gt; track of every name that had joined his cause, but he had been \ninactive for\n&gt; over 300 years, and this one may have joined after that. But then, \nhe\n&gt; remembered as Galvatron, he had heard the name. Galvatron once sent \nthis\n&gt; one to assasinate the Autobot leader. &quot;You served the Decepticon \ncause\n&gt; well, when you where under Galvatrons rule, and that is very \ncomendable&quot; he\n&gt; said, obviously showing his distain for Galvatron. &quot; I sensed your \nsignal\n&gt; was here, and came to revive you for your true destiny, as a \nDecepticon\n&gt; ruler of this mudball&quot; he said, liying through his fusion cannon \n(thats\n&gt; just an expression).\n\n\n"}}
