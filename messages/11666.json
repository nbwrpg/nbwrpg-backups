She stayed there for a moment.  &quot;Hey Quickstrike, I \ngot a question to ask you. Are you still my friend and comrad in \narms?&quot; She had to ask it.  She wanted to know for sure if he ever \nconsidered her a friend. Nothing more, just a friend. She knew she \nwas programmed before. But now she was free from her program and was \nfinally able to ask the question. She had always thought of him a \nfriend and a kind of big brother. But she had to know if he felt the \nsame. She had to know who were her friends, and she hoped he was one \nof them.\n\n\n"}}
