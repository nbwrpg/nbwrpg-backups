Saticfied to \nhear the hiss of air being sucked in.\nWith a determined look she then hefted the welding gun, turning it on as she \nstuck the end of the scution hose into Dinobot&#39;s wound, hearing fluid being \ndrawn into the tube and out of his body.\nShe had to wait for a sec for the welder to get hot enough to melt this bots \narmor, simply doing a patch up job until Dinobots repair system could \nactivate and take over.\nIron Raptor shifted her weight we she waited but then, when the welder was \nhot enough, she lowered it into the woulnd and stopped just above the \ndamaged lung.\nThis was tense!\nOnly the pit knew what sort of componants were in the body of a TM 2, and \nshe didn&#39;t want to damage any of them more then they already were.\nBut, she still had to try.\nWith her arms, and her hands well inside Dinobots body, she spread the wound \nopen more to get more light...but it didn&#39;t work much.*\n\n&quot; I need light in here...&quot;\n\n* With the suction she began extracting the mech-fluid from around the \ndamaged lung, finally getting enough of it away to set the wender to work on \nthe rip.\nIron Raptor squinted to see where the tip of the welding gun pressed against \nthe top of the tare, slowly running it along to melt the armor and get it to \ncover the wound up.\nAt best, she guessed, there was probably still some fluid in the lungs, \nwhich meant that if Dinobot survived he would at least have a wet caught for \na bit.\nBut time was still running short, and now she had less then 4 min to get \nboth air and fluids back into his body.\nAnd the more help she could get, the better.\nIron Raptor watched her work carefully.*\n\n&quot; Prowl, I need over 2 leters of water and liguid energon, quickly. Hook it \nup to the IV stand next to the CR chamber over there and get the tube riged \nup to it. Then shove the tube down his throat and get it into his stomach. \nThe more fluids he can digest and reconform into mech-fluid the better.&quot;\n\n* she then watched as the armor above the wound began to slowly warm and \nsoften, hoping that it soon liquafied soon and covered the opening.*\n\n&quot; Depth Charge, grab a smaller tube and make a small slit in his throat \nright above the air way, sove the tub in there until I say to stop.\nThen grab a resporator and hook it up to the other end, but don&#39;t switch it \non intul I say, alright?&quot;\n\n* And with that she continued to work, hoping that Dinobot could hold on \nuntil they were through.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
