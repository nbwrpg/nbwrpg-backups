Something about her seemed familier, he stood \nand walked over to her.\n&gt; &quot;Do I know you?&quot; he asked simply.\n&gt; Organics stepped forward and peered into his red optics.  They \nmatched, his face and voice matched, his build despite having a \nMaximal bnody matched, but one thing kept her from believeing he was \nthe one she was looking for.\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps.  I am looking for someone, who is family.  He has a \nbrother fallen to darkness, and a long lost adoptive sister.  He was \na Decepticon, Autobot, and some now say he is a most ruthless bounty \nhunter.  Do you know of anyone like this bot?&quot;\n&gt; Malice stared the femme back, taking in everything she said.  Then \nit hit him like a freight train.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; This is his lost sister, Organics.\n&gt; &quot;Organics?&quot; the bounty hunter asked.\n&gt; The femme threw her arms around around his neck.\n&gt; &quot;Oh Neutronics!  Where have you been?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Where have I been?  You were the one who disappeared without a \ntrace.  How have you been in the past three hundred years?&quot;\n&gt; He realized he neglected to introduce everyone.\n&gt; &quot;Wolfblade, please meet my long lost sister, Organics.&quot; he said as \nhe wheeled around and presented his half sister to Wolfblade.  \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord walked inside and looking to the bots said &quot;Malice... \nHere&#39;s a person that wants, speak with you&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Their defenses are broken!
