I&#39;m not having it on my head for her \nto \n&gt; miss out on the perfect opportunity to solidify that bond.\n&gt; \n&gt; Closing her mind to all else in the world, Empath takes the Soul \nOrb \n&gt; from her subspace compartment and sets it on the table in front of \n&gt; her.  It calls to her briefly, then she shuts that out as well and \n&gt; takes out a tiny holo-projector.  When she flicks it on, a six-inch-\n&gt; tall image of a familiar black Seeker greets her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Skywarp, what do I do?&quot; she asks it, tears welling up in her \n&gt; eyes.  &quot;It seems like only yesterday that I saw you for the last \n&gt; time - and now I&#39;m falling for a Maximal, of all things.

There was a severe lack of fruit.  This might&#39;ve been \n&gt; because he \n&gt; &gt; never found the mess hall but that thought hadn&#39;t occurred to him \n&gt; yet.  \n&gt; &gt; Neither had the fact that he had been walking in circles through \n&gt; the crew \n&gt; &gt; quarters area for quite some time.  Well, on his umpteenth trip \n&gt; down one of \n&gt; &gt; the halls he happened upon the brooding Empath heading into her \n&gt; room.  She \n&gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t seen him of course although she should have sensed him.  \n&gt; Perhaps she \n&gt; &gt; was just too distracted he thought to himself.  Regardless he \n&gt; turned around \n&gt; &gt; and walked the other way searching for more fruit and maybe his \n&gt; friend too, \n&gt; &gt; but only if he wanted fruit.\n\n\n"}}
