That was a Predacon, not a Maximal that he had \nloved.  But his logic and neurological circuitry lost control, Grimmler \nstepping up to Bright Blade, only a few inches from walking into her.  He \nreached out, taking a hold of her right wrist, gently, rubbing it \naffectionately, the Maximal ignoring all of the warnings his &#39;mind&#39; was \nsending him.\n\n======\n\nSmokescreen nodded.  Grimmler was taking the situation under control.  He \ncouldn&#39;t see the other Maximal slightly rubbing Bright Blade&#39;s wrist.\n\n"}}
