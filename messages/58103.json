I won&#39;t be\n&gt; posting as a \n&gt; player for some times, but I might do something\n&gt; else.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll act as a player right now, but I\n&gt; stay active in \n&gt; the council. This also means the upcoming\n&gt; storylines.\n&gt; \n&gt; Airly and I have been talking about the storylines\n&gt; and we might start \n&gt; them really soon. A feature that would be included\n&gt; is Non-player \n&gt; characters (NPC) that would be council-controlled.\n&gt; Also, depending on \n&gt; the intensity of the fight, they would be quite\n&gt; killable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be on the look-out. These storylines will be there\n&gt; soon (actually, as \n&gt; soon as we can agree on them!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I&#39;m still in the council. Any technical\n&gt; question, I&#39;m there for \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nic\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
