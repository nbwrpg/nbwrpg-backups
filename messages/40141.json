Please stop it, guys. Mosts of us don&#39;t care about pokemon, toys, etc... That&#39;s what the message board is for. Alot of us have very little time for the RPG in the summer (ie, me with two jobs), and can barely catch up and post as it is, without reading 70 OOCs. So please, cut the OOCs. \n\n\n\n\n\nPS:\n\n\n\n\n\nJer and rAuq, can you summarize Decepticon and Autobot happenings for me please?\n\n\n\n\n\nKSL or WarBarge, can you fill me in on Alliance occurances?\n\n\n\n\n\nAirly or Robo, can you guys help me with Predacon events?\n\n\n\n\n\nI would read them myself, but the damage on my hard drive has spread to the root partition, where the vital system files are kept. It took me over 20 minutes to boot up today after work, and the hard drive is already beginning to fail again. My laptop is suffering from something it probably picked up at Defcon, and I can&#39;t use it until I figure out what&#39;s wrong.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I&#39;m taking back my Maximals now. Thanx for taking care of them, Robo.\n\nOh, and KSL, you got the 40039th post, not the 40038 :-)\n\n\n\n::Cledar/Forrior/Rixer/Blyer::\n\nCledar takes a few steps back as he fires (at whoever he was firing before), a plate sliding over his arm to cover the damage, though mechfluid seeped out from under it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nForrior growls and jumps up, transforming into a tank and landing on the ground. His turret aims at Unitron as he speeds up and rides toward him, firing a stream from his fusion cannon at the NDE bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRixer stumbles a bit aways from the battle, checking himself over for damage. He sends the two bees on his shoulders out to scout, taking out his missile launcher and preparing it while his repair system works on his damages.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBlyer jumps into the air, transforming into a jet and flying toward Firestarter. He lets two missiles fall from his wing, then activating them and watching them fly toward their target.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Where&#39;s Firearm?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Sorry, KSL!
