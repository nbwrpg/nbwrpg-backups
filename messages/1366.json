The lilies dangled from her mouth as she sniffed\nthe ground in order to find the plant in which she needed. It was late into\nthe night when she came across the herb that was the main healing source of\nthe mixture...devils club. She looked at the wicked sounding plant and\nsuddenly remembered a poem she had made up the first time she had run into\nsome. Literally!\n&gt; It went:\n&gt;\n&gt; Beware the stalks and yellow spines,\n&gt; prickly as a porcupine.\n&gt; The devil&#39;s club is a plant to fear,\n&gt; with shiny leaves and wicked spears!\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked carefully at the plant before her and set the lilies upon the\nground, with a silent command she transformed and brought out a small knife.\n&gt; With a single slash Zyber striped the bush of a few of it&#39;s prickly stems,\nwith a near by bit of bark she collected the devil&#39;s club and the lilies and\nbegan her way to collect the remainder of her herbs.*\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor shook her head then ran after Prowl, unarmed. She wanted to\nknow why Plintissa was heading towards the Predacon base without having to\nshoot her. It puzzled her as to why a bot like Plintissa wished to go to the\nPred base, there would be nothing but torture and pain waiting for her no\nmatter what the cause.\n&gt; Iron Raptor didn&#39;t was Plintissa, let alone any bot, to be tortured like\nthat. She called out over her intercom.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Plintissa! What in the Matrix are you doing?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Suddenly her scanners alerted her that there was more then just\nPlintissa ahead, there were two other signatures.( BrightBlade and Gangon)\nBoth Predacon!\n&gt; Iron Raptor growled as she sped up and took out her splatter gun, she\nmight have to be armed after all!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
