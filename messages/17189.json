And now here he was, low on energy but just as alive as \never before.\nIron Raptors&#39; fingers stroke along his jawline and train down his neck as \nshe listens to Prowls statement.\nShe nodds slightiny.*\n\n&quot; I think so too, love.&quot;\n\n*Carefully she rose to a crouch as Prowl went limp in her arms, wondering \njust what the benifits to being a TM 2 was if you always ended up so low on \nenergy.\nThough, she made a mental note to ask Prowl that after he was fully \nrepaired.\nIron Raptor picked Prowl&#39;s torso up, finally realizing just how heavy he \nwas.\nAnd HE was calling HER a truck?!\nShe almost chuckled at the thought but getting Prowl into a CR chamber was \nfar more important then humor at the moment.\nIron Raptor waited as the doors to a CR chamber opened, then quickly draging \nProwl into one.\nThis was the only way she knew that a bot could relax and energize at the \nsame time, which was just what Prowl needed.\nShe proped him up against the back of the chamber and then squated down in \nfront of him.*\n\n&quot; You&#39;ll be as good as new in a mega-cycle, love. Just relax and let the \nchamber do its thing. I&#39;ll see you in a bit.&quot;\n\n* With that she jently kissed him on the forehead and walked out of the CR \nchamber, looking over her shoulder as the door closed behind her.\nHe would be alright now, just needed a bit of time to repair properly.\nIt was just then that her internal computer alerted her of something, \nlocating and scanning the ship to find just what it was.\nHmmm.\nHer scanners varified just what it was...Dinobot was back.\nBut also, her scanners alerted her that Feline wasn&#39;t in the ship as well.\nIron Raptor sighed and looked over to the repair station the cat had set up \nfor Dinobot&#39;s return...looked like it was up to her now.\nThough, she wouldn&#39;t do it alone, she had also scanned Tavatron alongside \nDinobot...as well as a smaller bot.\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to Tavatron, time to get down to buisness.*\n\n&quot; Tavatron, this is Iron Raptor. I&#39;m glad to see you guys made it back in \ntime. I&#39;ve already scanned Dinobot&#39;s damage and I would like you to bring \nhim to the CF CR room, and we&#39;ll get down to work. Simply follow the arows \non the walls.
