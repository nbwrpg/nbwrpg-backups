I don&#39;t\n&gt; believe that the two of you posess the firepower to stop me if I\n&gt; really wanted to leave....but, it depends on what you wanted me to\n&gt; fix, and what I am going to get out of the deal.  By the way, which\n&gt; one of you is the leader?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron then assumed a relaxed position, pulled out a small piece \nof\n&gt; metal and started picking little pieces of sand out of a crack in \nhis\n&gt; arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 12 Oct 2004 08:07:09 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&gt; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, we can&#39;t let you leave now.
