A Predacon army in an impenetrable\nfortressversus a single bot with a bunch  of dummies. (Classic John Wayne\nsenario.) &quot;You&#39;ll have to come out to get it Predacon.&quot; he said calmly\nknowing that the Preds had as much trapped themselves inside the Black\nFortress as kept him out. &quot;And if you fail to produce Silver Scout I&#39;ll have\nall my friends reduce you to rubble.&quot;\n\nOne bluff had led to another, now all there was to do was add the final\ntouch. &quot;I hate to inform you that the signals you picked up inside were\nfaked, We had a unit slip in, plant explosives all through your base and\nslip out unnoticed.&quot;\n\nInside the Black fortress Foxfingers and Razor Claw stood helplessly huddled\nbeneath Razor Claw forcefield. Lunarpines message broadcast loud and clear\nto thier comms. A pannel opened on Foxfingers wrist and the thief pressed in\na sequence that set off one of the charges he&#39;d planted near the base.\n\nWith a sudden BOOM that sent debris into the lava pit surrounding the\nFortress.\n&quot;That should get thier attention.&quot; Foxfingers comments chuckling the whole\ntime.\n\nLunarpine smiled as his scanners picked up the explosion. &quot;They&#39;re alive,&quot;\nhe thought to himself, &quot;I should&#39;ve known not to doubt them. He returned his\nconcentration to his comm, &quot;THAT could&#39;ve been the top sections of your\nbase.&quot; He paused to let the Preds think for a moment. &quot;That WILL be the top\nsections of your base if I don&#39;t start seeing some compromises on your\npart.&quot; He closed the line cutting off the conversation, The ball was in the\nPredacons court now. If there was a civilized answer they would have to\nreopen the line to talk.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, August 14, 2001 11:52 AM\nSubject: Re: Ender/Mutants/Waitting/Blaze/Silverscout\n\n\n&gt; Shivah/Seven-batp robes::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Then you have gave me some reasons to kill her: first. your friends\n&gt; and you was allies of MAximals and we&#39;re mortal enemies to maximals.\n&gt; Second. you sent your spies and like spies they will die... if they\n&gt; aren&#39;t death right now.&quot;said Shivah &quot;and you INTRUDER, I you have\n&gt; three seconds to decide you fate and Silverscout&#39;s, gave me that\n&gt; antivirus and she and you won&#39;t die today!!! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The bats probes, who were outside scanning Lunarpine&#39;s signature\n&gt; hidding around the area, letting the externals defences of\n&gt; BlackFortress imed against him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (according to the sensors Foxfingers and Razor Claw already had a\n&gt; miserable death, Foxfingers is useing a dampening field to make them\n&gt; invisable to the scanners.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine answered Shivahs comment with &quot;You&#39;re partly right, I was\n&gt; at one point a Maximal, now my loyalties are to my friends as an\n&gt; independant.&quot; he knew he was pushing his luck but he&#39;d always been\n&gt; stubborn enough to push until it pushed back. &quot;As for the anti-virus,\n&gt; it is ours and will remain with us until we see Silver Scout exit.&quot;\n&gt; He knew it was in the Predacons best interests to keep Silver Scout\n&gt; alive, especially if any Preds were infected.\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: Airshadow Nightlight\n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Monday, August 13, 2001 12:06 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Ender/Mutants/Waitting/Blaze/Silverscout\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Shivah said to Ender &quot;Over that factions (Alliance and\n&gt; Destrons) who are the best to get an alliance? &quot;after that the male\n&gt; opend his comm link to Blaze and Silverscout &quot;Blaze and Silverscout,\n&gt; go to area 23&quot; and looking to Drillbit &quot;As soon as I end to deal with\n&gt; this pest, we can continue our businness &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Shiva opened com link with Lunarpine &quot;Why don&#39;t you give us\n&gt; the anti-virus and later we can chat about Silverscout?  if you don&#39;t\n&gt; do it I will kill her together your two friends that I&#39;ve have in my\n&gt; hands&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       BlackFortress External defences turned on and aimed to\n&gt; Lunarpine; the room where Razor Claws and Foxfingers were, the acyd\n&gt; level started to increase.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;I&#39;ve told you Lunarpine of MAximals -Yes I know that you\n&gt; have been in Maximal base due that I give you that name&quot; said\n&gt; Shivah &quot;I told you that I haven&#39;t humour this day, unless you give me\n&gt; that antivirus to cure Silverscout...
