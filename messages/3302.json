Uh, We are looking for Inny, I\n&gt; mean Iron Raptor. She is a long time freind of ours\n&gt; and we came from our planet to look for her, when she\n&gt; never came back. Uh, we see that she is kinda busy\n&gt; right now, so would you please tell us of this planet?\n&gt; Our computer on our ship didn&#39;t have sufficent\n&gt; information on it and we don&#39;t really know much about\n&gt; our beast modes either. If you would be kind enough to\n&gt; show us around and explain until, Er, Iron is\n&gt; finished, we would be very grateful.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
