We&#39;re going to help the Maximals out this time, so\n&gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; on anyone firing at you unless the Maximals open fire on us.

Him and the Galactors exit the base and take\n&gt; &gt; off, the shields flickering off for them as they pass through and\n&gt; fly\n&gt; &gt; toward the CF. Zardus looks behind him, checking to see if anyone\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; following, as they should be.\n\n\n"}}
