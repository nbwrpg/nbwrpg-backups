Soft Style: Means Koj kept to focusing on the mind and\n&gt; less on the muscle power to learned skills. Hard Style means Koj used the\n&gt; style to aquire raw muscle power like the Eagle Claw I used to break\n&gt; Prebon&#39;s sword is a hard style move. Lai Tai strike the Kendo swing that\n&gt; create a enegry blast is soft style. Rookies point of view maybe wrong!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Koj::\n&gt; &quot;Huh!?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Inu-Yasha::\n&gt; &quot;What I mean is people always give up things for people they love a person\n&gt; may even risk there life for another a person like that would care nothing\n&gt; for himself and gives up everything for anothers well being normally this\n&gt; caused by love for a lover or a parent or a friend what do you think Koj?&quot;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
