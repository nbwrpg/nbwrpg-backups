I almost missed it since it was in\n&gt; the same post as Tuscon =\r\nmoving into the Ark :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Night Shift keeps up with scorponok, as he ki=\r\ncks up dust beneath his tires while he rolls over uneven ground without muc=\r\nh trouble.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I dunno where that Matrix is now. I&#39;m sure Tucson&#39;s al=\r\nready figured me out&#39;n hid it somewhere else. It used ta be in Prime&#39;s ches=\r\nt, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where it is anymore. I know that bot Scorponok,=\r\n he&#39;s not stupid. If he feels that somethn&#39; ain&#39;t right, he&#39;ll go out of hi=\r\ns way ta make sure nothn&#39; goes wrong.

If anything, he probably has it hidden so=\r\nmewhere in a different grid all together.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scorponok grunted as he=\r\n moved swiftly over the terrain, his form\n&gt; easily able to traverse the une=\r\nven surface.
