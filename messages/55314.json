So right...\n\nHe transformed to hawk mode and flew back to the base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;        He nods grimly not entirely surprised by the revelation.  A\nspark of \n&gt; an idea flashes across his face but is quickly suppressed to keep\nOwlhawk \n&gt; from noticing.  He starts growling.  He jumps to his feet in a fury.\n &quot;HOW \n&gt; COULD YOU LET THEM TAKE HER!  BY THE PIT, ONE OF YOUR COMRADES DIED\nTRYING TO \n&gt; SAVE HER AND YOU LET THEM KEEP HER?!?&quot;  He growls more loudly this\ntime and \n&gt; throws one fierce right hook at Owlhawk&#39;s head before he transforms\nto his \n&gt; bird mode and flies into the night sky.\n\n\n"}}
