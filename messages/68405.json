As soon as the circuits\n&gt; were cut,\n&gt; &gt; he slowly applied an acidic compound to the line maneuvered the hands to\n&gt; &gt; peel it off, removing the draining circuits entirely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Success, I think.... she&#39;s not going to be hungry anymore.&quot; he said\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; others in the room.  &quot;Should I now de-fang her so she wont eat any more\n&gt; &gt; sparks?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, knowing her, he knew she would probably devour more\n&gt; sparks just\n&gt; &gt; for fun.  And it probably wouldn&#39;t be healthy now that she had no\n&gt; outlet for\n&gt; &gt; the energy.  He didn&#39;t even wait for a response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The vampiric circuits sucked spark energon directly from the mouth\n&gt; into the\n&gt; &gt; spark chamber.  He found the circuits went all the way up the body\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; mouth.  He detached the front armor plate and located the line,\n&gt; which was\n&gt; &gt; precariously located next to the computer and servos which control neck\n&gt; &gt; motion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;They don&#39;t make this easy....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he began to cut into the lines, he noticed that his tool was\n&gt; scratching\n&gt; &gt; the surface of the other lines.  He pulled the arms out and put on more\n&gt; &gt; delicate tools.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He slowly drilled under the line in places and lightly soldered while\n&gt; &gt; lifting up.  The line popped up after a few more seconds, but\n&gt; dislodged the\n&gt; &gt; other lines.  With about a foot of cable removed from each side, he\n&gt; then put\n&gt; &gt; everything back in order.  Parts of the lines necessarily had to remain\n&gt; &gt; inside her, but there was no longer any connection to the spark\n&gt; chamber.  He\n&gt; &gt; put all the panels back on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Finally, he checked the mouth to make sure there wasn&#39;t any strange\n&gt; &gt; equipment up there that might cause her problems...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I think I&#39;m done...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Let me know if there&#39;s anything up there, otherwise my next post\n&gt; &gt; Celeron will reactive her and see if his surgery was successful.\n&gt; Sorry if\n&gt; &gt; that last post was too technical and dry...
