It wanted him. Perhaps to\nkill\n&gt; him. It snarled and took a step closer. Its pawless legs stepped harshly\non\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf howled and transformed to robot mode. &quot;Leave him alone!&quot; he\n&gt; called out. He withdrew his rifle and aimed it at the Metal Beast. &quot;Go get\n&gt; him out of here! I&#39;ll deal with this! Go!&quot; He threw his arm out.\n&gt;\n&gt; He fired a shot into the Beast&#39;s shoulder, below its cannon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Above, Terrorsaur circled nervously.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
