Also it is OK to kill your enemies don&#39;t make the mercy the mistake I \ndid. Also if you guys win the war and I haven&#39;t returned go home without me \nI&#39;ll make back sometime. Stay out of my  quarters until I get back which will \nwhen I find out about this vok technology these can&#39;t be the only traces.&quot; \n\nTigerhawk Laughs &quot;When we find out about this vok technology&quot; \n\nLiono looks shocked &quot;what your coming too?&quot;\n\nTigerhawk grins  &quot;With your luck you&#39;ll get into trouble like always.&quot;\n\nLiono looks Prowl &quot;Tell the others something cocky and say I said it and give \nthis to Key.&quot; Hands a box to prowl ((I.E Yanshosh cut and paste this next \npart because odds of Blue checking her mail are slim and none.))\n\nIn the box there is two things a Ring with my Mom gave me this to give to the \nperson I planned to spend all of my days with and a Holocube.\n\nThe holocube cuts on to Keys touch turns into a full sized Liono Prime it \nSpeaks &quot;if your wondering when I&#39;ll  or if I&#39;ll be back Key stand up hold \narms spread your arms a little wider As long as you do this the holograms \nsteps in between her arms and hugs her and kiss her on the forehead I have a \nhome to return to so I&#39;ll be back unless you want to come with me. The \nHolocube shows a Map and a red beacon appears somewhere in Japan. Liono looks \nat &quot;This is where I&#39;ll be.We are a team so don&#39;t you dare get killed on me. \nThe Ring is a Signal put it on If your ever in trouble I&#39;ll be on my way in a \nflash just turn the ring to make the Lions touch. ((Send a private mail to \nYanshosh@... telling him and he&#39;ll tell me.))  I Love you very much. \n\nTigerhawk looks at Liono &quot;the Vok technology isn&#39;t really why you left \nnobody&#39;s here I want the truth.&quot; \n\nLiono laughs &quot;you saw past that huh I have to get stronger there something \nout there I feel it coming its a lot stronger than any threat we faced so far \nI just hope I make back in time.&quot;   \n\nTigerhawk looks at Liono &quot;This is something you might want to share.&quot;\n\nLiono look at Tigerhawk &quot;I don&#39;t have enough information to spook the team \nall I know is he will have Black Wings.&quot;  \n\n                                       As the two walk off into the horizon.\n\n"}}
