I didn&#39;t expect to control all maxis \nwith just the chip. I have other things. The chip is just the first \nstep. And they will fall. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;\n\nPrebon smiled as Spears curled up to him. This must be driving \nStriker wild! But than the unthinkable happened. Striker attacked! \nThe first shot Prebon was able to dodge partially, clipping him in \nthe side of the head, starting mech fluid to run down his face. He \ncried.\n\n&quot;No Spears!&quot; He flung her out of the way of the rest of the blasts. \nHe was overcome with rage.\n\n&quot;I was hoping I didn&#39;t have to do this! BECOME ONE OF US!&quot;\n\nPrebon pulled out The Tamer(Prebon provides the arms of Tamron, so \nThe gun is with him.). He pressed a few buttons and loaded a chip.\n\n&quot;Now serve your Lord Prebon!&quot;\n\nPrebon launched the chip.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream found the battle sight, and found a group of Alliance \nmembres.

COME AND HELP US INSTALL THE \nCOMPUTER BOARDS!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois set Child down on a small table, and than looked at The Sky \nScorchers.\n\n&quot;Come, bring the body into Windrazor&#39;s quarters. I will perform the \nburial there.&quot; He entered Windrazor&#39;s quarters.\n\n\n"}}
