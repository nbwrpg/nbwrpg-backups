Likewise, I could get to trust\nyou. If you are trustworthy to me, then even my commanders would have\nnothing to say about it, not even old Yggie. Now, the question is,\nwould you let me trust you?\n\nHe was looking intently in her eyes with a mix of hope and sadness.

I wanna cambat! I can \n&gt; do it this time I promise Blackfang!  I can take on the drones! Just \n&gt; Watch me. You&#39;ll See.&quot; she said with the biggest grin on her small \n&gt; face plates. \n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the little bot. She reminded her of \n&gt; herself at that age. Ready to show the whole of Cybertron that she \n&gt; was out to be the best pred out there. She shook her head slightly. \n&gt; &quot;Think you got what it takes huh kid?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; She shook her head up and down. &quot;Oh yeah! I can take them out. Easy. \n&gt; Blackfang showed me how. Just have to jump on the tops of them and \n&gt; hit the switch on the back. I&#39;ve been practicing. I&#39;m not as good as \n&gt; Blackfang yet. But I will be soon. I just have to get a little \n&gt; bigger.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She nodded her head. &quot;You know kid, you&#39;d make a good predacon one of \n&gt; these days.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; &quot;A Predacon? Aren&#39;t they bad?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &quot;Bad? Since when was a Predacon bad? All we want is the right to rule \n&gt; this planet as we are destined to. Predacons are supposed to rule \n&gt; over all the CyberLife. It&#39;s been told to us since the dawn of \n&gt; Cybertron. I just can&#39;t figure out why the maximals stand in the way \n&gt; of that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; She scratched the top of her head. &quot;Why are the Predacons supposed to \n&gt; make up all the rules? Why can&#39;t we just be friends? Like we are now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She looked at Blackfang and sighed heavily. She felt her welcome \n&gt; would be short lived. She turned and looked at Cam. &quot;Look little one. \n&gt; The matrix has set things into action. We Preds are going to fight \n&gt; for our right to rule. And the Maximals will forever stand in the way \n&gt; of that destiny. We will never get along. It&#39;s just not ment to be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; She walked up to KitKat and stood infront of her. &quot;But we&#39;re friends. \n&gt; If we are friends, then why can&#39;t the others just be friends like we \n&gt; are?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She knelt down and looked Cam in the optics. &quot;Because kid, no Maximal \n&gt; will ever trust a Predacon if his spark depended on it. No bot can go \n&gt; against thier own programming,&quot; she looked up at Blackfang, &quot;no \n&gt; matter how much they want to.&quot;  She looked back at Cam. &quot;Now, let&#39;s \n&gt; see you take on a drone by yourself.&quot; She patted Cam on the head and \n&gt; stood up. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang glanced shyly at Kitkat, then looked back at Cam.
