It was a strong posibility, if he was though, Megatron\ncould start to rebuild his lost empire, without that idiots medeling. He\nneared the Ice caps, and started to move towards the large bodies of Ice,\nhe needed energon badly, he would not survive long. He saw a large wall of\nice, that had strong readings of being rich in energon. But as he neared\nthe wall of ice, he noticed it looked like it had been freshly broken, and\nhis readings showed a faint source of already burnt energy. He thought long\nand hard to what it could be, and landed on the ground, almost falling from\ndepletion.\n\n\n\n"}}
