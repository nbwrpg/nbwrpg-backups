This \nmight&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never found the mess hall but that thought hadn&#39;t occurred \nto \n&gt; &gt; him \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither had the fact that he had been walking in circles \n&gt; &gt; through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the crew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quarters area for quite some time.  Well, on his umpteenth \n&gt; trip \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the halls he happened upon the brooding Empath heading into \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room.
