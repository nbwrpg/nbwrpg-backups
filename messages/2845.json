Just a few...scratches. Nothing big.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she then looked back over at Striker and Liono, it was time\nthat they got to that meeting that Liono had called earlier. Not to mention\nthat there was still the feud between Ramhorn and Plintissa to resolve.\n&gt; Iron Raptor knew that she was in no real condition to attend a meeting but\nshe had told Ramhorn and company that she would help solve his problem and\nshe wasn&#39;t about to let him down. The Maximals came before herself...always.\n&gt; With that look she then turned towards the base, the action causing her to\nclench her teeth and force back a particularly loud snarl. But with\ndetermination and a plain amount of force she then began to walk towards the\nArk...her progress slow and limping, the mech fluid from her side running\ndown her hip and leg but she tried to her best ability to ignore it.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We best be getting to the...meeting before the bots left there...scrap\nthe place.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her words were plain but pained, she just hoped that Prowl wouldn&#39;t rag\non her too much for not simply going to a CR chamber first.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
