All \nthe bots were near some base in the area. He sighs. Attacking bases \nsinglehandedly wasn&#39;t recommended for anyone who wished to live for \nany extended period of time. Not that Hunter wanted to live for too \nlong (he didn&#39;t), but he didn&#39;t want to die before he accomplished \nhis goal.\n\nHunter powers up his jetpack, flying up into the air. He picks a \nrandom direction and flies off, heading southeast.\n\n\n"}}
