I see.\n::Enertron::\n    &quot;Ack.&quot;  As Galvatron wraps his tail around his left arm he realizes what \nis about to happen.  He tries to use his right arm to slash the tail off of \nhim but finds it restrained as well.  In desperation he uses one finger to \nemit a beam to cleave off the end of the tail.  Even this is only partially \neffective as his left arm is dislocated already.  With his left arm free, but \nwounded, he howls in pain as the teeth rip into his shoulder.  The fire burns \nhis arm to a toasty brown and it falls limp and detaches from his side.\n\n    As he was reeling in pain he heard the knee guns fire near him.  He \nvaguely felt the impact of the shots tearing into his sides.  He quickly \nfocused and transformed back to his beast mode.  As it was much smaller he \nwas able to slip out of the crushing hold and fly a short distance.  His \nbeast mode was horribly mangled and weak so when he landed he returned to \nrobot mode.  He quickly slammed himself into the ground to relocate his \nshoulder and stood up rotating it to regain feeling. He braces himself, ready \nfor the next attack.\n\n"}}
