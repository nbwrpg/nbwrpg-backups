Glancing around for a second, he takes off \nrunning again. He was beginning to get lightheaded from lack of fluid, \nas well as from the constant pain in his arm and chest.\n\nHis eyes widen as he sees Iron Raptor hobble around the corner, Prowl \nrunning toward her, his eyes concerned.\n\n&quot;Are you allright, love?&quot; he says, breathing heavily.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * She plowed down the halls, turning corner after corner, but \nsomewhere in \n&gt; this maze of a ship she had gotten turned around. The halls didn&#39;t \nlook \n&gt; familier anymore, and she knew that she might have to retrace her \nsteps to \n&gt; get into the right one again. But to do that she would have to run \ninto \n&gt; Prowl again, and if he saw her barreling towards him he might not \n&gt; move...trying to stop her.\n&gt; Which wouldn&#39;t happen, that was a fact.\n&gt; She may not be too big but she was stronger then before, even her \nsecond \n&gt; beast mode couldn&#39;t handle the merged modes alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; But if she didn&#39;t find a way back to familier halls soon, she just \nmight \n&gt; have to pass Prowl. Which she hoped she wouldn&#39;t have to do.\n&gt; However, as she rounded a corner she planted her feet firmly...to \nprevent \n&gt; from smashing into the wall!\n&gt; DEAD END!!\n&gt; \n&gt; But she couldn&#39;t manage to stop herself in time and clenched her jaw \nas she \n&gt; slammed shoulder first into the wall...with the force of a being \nthrown my a \n&gt; 50ft tall transformer!\n&gt; Yes, there was a dent in the wall where she hit, and a little bit of \n&gt; yellowish mech-fluid as well. But she sound of the sickening CRACK \nas she \n&gt; hit was the worst of all.\n&gt; If it had been any other creature it would have died on impact...but \nshe had \n&gt; only dislocated her shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; She stepped back from the wall and turned towards the hall again, \nknowing \n&gt; that Prowl would be there any moment. And with this shoulder she \ncould make \n&gt; it at a bare run, but one slow enough that a bot could easily run \nbeside \n&gt; her.\n&gt; She watched for Prowl as she hobbled a bit on her bad leg, though \nlooking \n&gt; for a section of the walls which would due perfectly for relocating \nher \n&gt; shoulder.\n&gt; She may have the mind of a beast now, but she remembered her \nt\n\n\n"}}
