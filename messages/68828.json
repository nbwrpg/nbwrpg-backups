The sweeps move swiftly into \nthe air, rising abo=\r\nve the level of the immediate battle lines, almost \nas if calling for a cea=\r\nse fire, or at least a temporary cessation of \ncombat. ((OOC: although they=\r\n will keep firing if fired upon)) \n\nAll too quickly the reason for the ceas=\r\ne fire becomes all too \napparent as the large form of Cyclonus in his dread=\r\ned spaceship mode \nseems to almost materialize out of the clouds, flanked b=\r\ny two of his \nnew minions: Tumult and Decibel. \n\nCyclonus looks like he has=\r\n fared well with the power of the matrix \nand has been transformed by it! L=\r\nooking larger, well armed and \narmored, any sensor directed at him might pi=\r\nck up another startling \nchange. He is powered not by the nuclear power of =\r\nthe engines of a \nprevious incarnation, or even the fusion power of his las=\r\nt meeting, \nbut the full power of something akin to antimatter, and his wea=\r\npons \nmatch! \n\n&quot;You have fallen far too easily Cybertronians!&quot; Cyclonus&#39; vo=\r\nice \nthunders out over the battle field, &quot;I must admit I had not expected \n=\r\nit. Perhaps you were not worthy of my full attentions.&quot;\n\nEven as Cyclonus t=\r\nalked the sweeps took up formation around him as he \nbegan to rise higher i=\r\nnto the air ((OOC: assuming no one is attacking \nthem)). &quot;It would seem tha=\r\nt your brethren at the Ark were more \nsuccessful than you at thwarting my p=\r\nlans, I will be forced to take \nmatters in hand.&quot;\n\nIt is obvious that Cyclo=\r\nnus is about to leave . . . \n\n(Tag or TBC)\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
