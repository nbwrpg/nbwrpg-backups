By the way I would do this in polls but no one&#39;s answering \nmine anymore and I want comments about your opinions. Would you be \nwilling to have a char in a faction made entirely of proto-humans \ntrying to banish the &quot;demons&quot; from their planets, and should they be \nallowed to use magic and energon spear and hammerheads to even the \nodds. If I get 3 supporting replies and no negative ones I&#39;ll do it \n(forget it Nemisis you don&#39;t count).\n\nA shuttle is crashing to earth.  It lands in North America. It scans a \nsmall, black and white rabbit. A bot of 80 stellar cycles steps out \n(he was 8).\n\nOld Bot: I look almost as cute as I did when I was 20. Just in a \ndifferent way. From now on everyone can call me Cutie just like the \nladies did.  BEAST MODE!\n\nHe happily hops away.\n\nOOC: Does anyone know how I can make my dialogue less sketchy (shut up \nNemisis)?\n\n\n"}}
