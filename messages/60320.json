They had hurt him yes, but far from dead was he. Clinging \n&gt; to the walls of earth slowly the silver ooze climbed and climbed \n&gt; ever so slightly. Over the course of years it clung and scratched \n&gt; its way back to the sun. With a spurt liek an eruption of a gyser a \n&gt; shiny line of silver shot into the air. Hovering in the air it \n&gt; molded into a metallic ball. The sun gleamed against it showing the \n&gt; spark in its center. Its conciousness searched and searched for a \n&gt; memory a form it could manifest into. Suddenly it sprang forth arms \n&gt; and legs. It had transformed into Rodimus Prime. Lookign at his \n&gt; hands and feet his reformed memory circuts connected with his dark \n&gt; spark. The gangled voice that came forth was his spark in a \n&gt; projected form and not of Rodimus \n&gt; Prime..&quot;P..rrrrr....o...t...o..lives!&quot; Suddenly with a burst he \n&gt; transformed into Starscream&#39;s jet mode and blasted off towards the \n&gt; nearest Predacon base. &quot;Attention to any predacons please contact me \n&gt; and lead me to your base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
