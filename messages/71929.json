The only modification was of Hydras. I made him a\n&#39;Super&#39; on the order of Optimal Optimus since they both had the\ntwinned spark thing going. Maurauder is another in that group since he\nis actually a spark twin of Hydras with another thrown in the mix.\n\nSo at the moment you should only have 3 Supers: Optimal Optimus,\nHydras and Maurader. Vorpal would be an unknown as of yet since he has\nnot been seen. However we can assume that he is larger than anyone\nelse.\n\nQuestions, comments?\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
