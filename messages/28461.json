Looking around the battle, Mantle saw the \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighting. From the look of their base, things weren&#39;t good. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at his team, sending a message to their minds:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You guys go ahead, I&#39;ll battle from here.&quot; He looks up in \n&gt; time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see a big \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; robot reaching for something that looked like a bunch of \n&gt; metal. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His mind \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probed out, seeing that it was a robot. Mantle was a bit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised at all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rage that he could feel around him, as well as the pain \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but he was used to it by now. On his first several battles it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised him, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, and made him a bit less good of a leader untill he \n&gt; got \n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But he was used to it now, and no one was going to push the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals around \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while he was on this planet!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantle concentrated hard, making his mind reach out across \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; battlefield. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He flexed his mind and Firearm&#39;s body rose from the shields, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoiding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Menasor&#39;s grab. Mantle slowly lowered to the ground, his \n&gt; teeth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clenched. One \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the setbacks of his ability to use his mind to directly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; influence robots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was that it created a temporary link between those robots and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself. In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this case, Mantle could feel the pain that Firearm was \n&gt; feeling, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and it was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost too much. But he held on, flipping Firearm through the \n&gt; air \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind. Sweat poured down his forehead as he made Firearm&#39;s \n&gt; body \n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly fly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the air toward the Element.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Through nearly closed eyes, Mantle could see the rest of his \n&gt; team \n&gt; &gt; &gt; emerging \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the shield, still firing. He saw that Cinder was looking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; battle, searching for the bot she had been worrying about as \n&gt; she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fired more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at Deamon Wulf. His eyes drifted to the rest of his family, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing Rocky \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire two more missiles at Dark Claw. Aqua nearly tripped over \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; uneven \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground, causing one of his spears to dig into the earth, but \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; next three \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were aimed exactly at Flesh Ripper&#39;s head. Above him, Mist \n&gt; gained \n&gt; &gt; &gt; altitude, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; firing charges at Menasor&#39;s hand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at \n&gt; http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
