But with them exposed like \nthat they�re more vulnerable then ever. If we�re attacked we could both \ndie!�\n\n* Her voice was a growl but she knew that Iris would keep calm, even though \nshe did know how to pull the old programs diode.*\n\nIRIS: � Yes, that is a possibility�but you have to ask yourselves if it�s \nworth the risk. You could both end up dead�or Prowl could instead of you�but \nthat would mean that you would only die later on.�\n\n* Iron Raptor growled*\n\n� Thanx, just what I needed for an emotional booster��\n\nIRIS: � Slag with emotions, this in deadly serious, literally! You two \nreally have to put this into consideration.\nThis has only been tried once and both parties had died in the end�AFTER the \nmerge had been completed.�\n\n* Iron Raptor looked at Prowl for a moment and then back at the star in the \ncracked screen. Her voice telling her uneasiness.*\n\n� After?�\n\nIRIS: � Yes, after. The merge had been a complete success, but they couldn�t \nhandle the side effects�and they both died. I couple like yourselves too. It \nwas a shame, the woman had been carrying a fetus program( the program which \nmade a child). But they took the risk and paid the price, it was their own \ndoing.�\n* But then Iris turned her attention towards Prowl.*\n\nIRIS: � Words never do sound nearly as complicated as the actions. But in \nthis case it is fairly complicated, Prowl. You have to reconfigure your \nspark signature just the right way�and you only have one shot at this. One \nwrong setting and it won�t only delete Irons spark but your own�at the \natomic level. Which means your sparks will simply disintegrate very�very \nslowly�and nothing will be able to stop it.�\n\n* Iris then added, replying to Prowls other comment about relocating.*\n\nIRIS: � And a wide open area would be more suitable then a wooded and \npenned-in area�the shock along after merge is complete could level 100 \nclicks of forest land. If all goes well�.\nBut, yes�we should move.�\n\n* Iris sighed*\n\nIRIS: � Now�if you would be as so kind as to pick up this monitor and carry \nit with you, I can�t download myself into Iron�s program until this \nprocedure is complete.�\n\n* Iron Raptor shifted uneasily, looking around at the wreckage a bit before \ngazing back into the cracked screen.*\n\n� I�m not sure I like this. Not at all. Why drag Prowl into this when he�s \ndone nothing, and now has the risk to die along with me. It&#39;� not right.�\n\nIRIS: � So�you would rather die then bring him into this, even after he�s \nagreed to help?�\n\n* Iron Raptor growled*\n\n� That�s exactly what I�m saying. If dying now is my fate then I�m alright \nwith that, but�Prowl�it�s not even near his time and I couldn�t handle \nknowing that it was because of me if he died.�\n\nIRIS: � It�s all part of love. Dying for each other. Some may view it as \nfoolish and others may see it as the symbol of true love. There have been \npeople and bots alike who have lost one they�ve loved but stayed with them \nstill�even after death. Laid by the side of the long dead corps�all for \nlove.\nThis is no different. Everyone has their own way of expressing love, \nflowers, poems, songs, laying beside the corps of their loved one�but this \nis his way of expressing it, Iron. Dying for you would probably be his \nsparks greatest joy, expressing it to the fullest. Just as concern is yours.\nBesides, I�m sure that if roles were reversed YOU would be the one putting \nyour spark on the line.�\n\n* Iron Raptor simply nodded in agreement, knowing that Iris was right. But \nhow in the Pit did this program get so damned smart?!\nShe looked down at the star.*\n\n� So�where�s the perfect place to pull this trip off?�\n\nIRIS: � Exactly 200 clicks south from this destination�about half a days \nride. If we left now we should be there by�early evening tomorrow.�\n\n* Iron Raptor cringed and felt her shoulder throb: Ride? Great!\nShe looked over towards Prowl and then at Iris again, simply waiting now for \nwhen the both of them were ready.*\n\nIRIS: � And Prowl? About that reconfiguration of the signature�it has to be \nright on 603.5117, and it might take a while for you to set it just right so \nI suggest you begin now.�\n\n* So, now Iris was ready, and also inclined to answer any questions anyone \nmight have.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
