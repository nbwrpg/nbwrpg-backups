They have gotten \npounded in the face of an enemy he had sought to intimidate because of \nthe arrival of reinforcements, too much reinforcements. The journey on \nEarth would be a long one. Also, he held in his talon the last remain \nof one of his warriors, a single limp techno-organic tentacle.\n\nTyrael flew down to the transformed ship that was their base. He \nopened a general Tripredacus channel.\n\nTyrael: Every unit, gather on my signal.\n\nHe remarked the slithering form of Naga. His friend looked... \nsuspicious...\n\nNaga: How was the battle, Major?\n\nTyrael: We were beaten, but they shall taste defeat another day. What \nnews have you for me, Naga?\n\nThe snake frowned slightly.\n\nNaga: A lone bot came. I tried to convince him to join us, but he \nrefused, saying he preferred to stay unbound to duty.\n\nTyrael&#39;s fury started to bleed in his tone.\n\nTyrael: Just how much did you tell him?\n\nNaga: Well... huh... A lot, sir.\n\nTyrael: Too much, you treacherous viper! You do know that we have to \nkill anyone knowing about us! Find a pod and get in stasis lock!\n\nNaga was both relieved and shocked at the punishment. He would not \nperish, but nor would he see any more combat until they get back to \ntheir headquarters. He simply executed his order, silently.\n\nTyrael: Every other unit! Gather up now!\n\n\n"}}
