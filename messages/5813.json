It was a test.  She was \nfinding out what he could do.  And he was seeing what she was capable of.  \nShe really didn&#39;t like tricking him like that.  But she wanted him to know \nthat She wasn&#39;t a feather brain.(bird joke) She wanted him to know that she \ncould think when she had to and let instinct take over when nessessary.  She \nstopped at a brach about 20 feet off the ground and perched for a moment. \nShe looked up into a tree near her&#39;s and saw another bird. It was a nice, \nfat crow.\n&quot;How do you like your crow? Rare, Medium or Well done?&quot;\nShe didn&#39;t give him time to answer the question.  she swooped up and caught \nthe crow that was sitting in another tree. She flew down and dropped it \ninfront of Lunarpine.\n\n&quot;Sorry for the dirty trick I pulled. I&#39;ll be &#39;it&#39; again if you want.&quot;\nShe pushed the crow closer to him. &quot;Peace offering?&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
