I have said it before and I will say it \nagain.  Something is majorly wrong.  Megatron is one not to be \ntrusted.  With Anything. And I don&#39;t care if he hears me. Further \nmore, this ...thing.. is just allowed to walk in and do waht it \nwants, when it wants it and no one will stop it from doing \nanything.   Megarton is the only one who knows anything and yet he is \nnot telling you anything about what is going on.  If you want to \nsurvive, we had better do something.  I have served and died for you \nand Megatron in the past.   I died for Magatron.  I died for you.  \nNow I&#39;ll die for  no one.  Save one.  And he isn&#39;t going to ask.  So \nwhat do I care.  Either we do something and gain some sort of \nadvantage, or we get killed for nothing.  Not even trying to save \nourselves.  So let me know what you want and I&#39;ll help, but decide \nfast OK?!&quot;\n\n\nShe stood there fuming.  She was madd and getting madder.  She was \ngoing to die.  That much she knew.  But she wanted to die in battle \nand not just standing around.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Aracnia watches Darkmouse walk off. She saved her life, and \nthis was her \n&gt; payback? &quot;Leave. Go. Abandon us in our time of need. And once your \nout, dont \n&gt; bother coming back, or I&#39;ll sic Tarantulas on you.&quot;\n&gt;     Hell Beast now was looking into the opening, his scanners \npicked up  the \n&gt; oxygen catastrophy. But these bots bots were still here...and a \nthreat to any \n&gt; possible colonization efforts.\n&gt;     &quot;Your cleared from all charges. But, your presence here has \nbecome \n&gt; undesireable. You have 5 days to get every transformer off the \nplanet or you \n&gt; all will be destroyed.&quot; Hell Beast said with arrogance.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, I thought this would happen. I dont suppose killing you \nwould stop \n&gt; you then?&quot; Aracnia said as she raised her bowcaster.\n&gt;     &quot;No, in fact it would only make things much wor-&quot; He stopped as \nAracnia \n&gt; blew off his head. His body sank to the ground like a dead weight.\n&gt;     &quot;get rid of it. Tarantulas, we had better think of something. \nThese \n&gt; aliens are pissed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron returns to the Cave and see&#39;s its a mess, and battle \nis brewing. \n&gt; &quot;KITKAT! REPORT HERE AT ONCE! Waspinator, bring up communications, \nIm going \n&gt; to get back into that ship!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
