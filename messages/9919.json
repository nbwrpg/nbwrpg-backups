Match found.&quot;\n\nA bright light appeared inside the pod, where Brix had to shield his \neyes. When it ended, the pod started opening. He was about to see \nwhat  Octociz looked like. The pod finished opening and.....nothing \nwas there.\n\n&quot;Oh My God! The pod musn&#39;t of been stable enough. It killed him!!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;Brix over here!&quot;\n\nBrix turned around to see a giant Fox sitting on a tree branch.\n\n&quot;Octociz, is that you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it was me. I am Octociz, put that name doesn&#39;t seems right any \nmore. Call me Fliq. Fliq the fox!&quot;\n\n&quot;Man, that was fast, you just went right passed me and Ramulus.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know. Look at this!&quot;\n\nFliq started showing off, showing leaping and twirling tricks he \ncould do. He found a small tree and started clawing at it. within 5 \nseconds it had fallen over.\n\n&quot;Fliq MAXIMIZE!!&quot;\n\nFliq went to bot mode. He looked superb. All flashy, new metal. He \nchecked out his weapons. On one arm his paw peeled back to reveal a \nbuilt in grenade launcher. His other paw grew claws and on the bottom \npart and made a clamping device which can crush anything. Between the \nclamping device, a slit opened up in his paw and out came a chainaw. \nTwo Plasma Cannons were mounted on his shoulders. He also had Optic \nlasers. The end of his tail opened to reveal a jet engine.\n\n&quot;Thanks Brix, and Thank You Ramulus. But I think we need to get back \nto base now.&quot;\n\n(Yanshosh, I&#39;ll be sending you a bio for Fliq soon!)\n\n\n"}}
