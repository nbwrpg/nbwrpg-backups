The rain was still coming down hard, it was getting a little \ncold.\nBlackNightmare :  The femme huged him and said &quot;Yes I&#39;m&quot;\nMalice: &quot;That&#39;s good.  This storm is probably going to last a \nwhile.  Want me to find a heater or emergency blanket?&quot;  The \ninterior of the ship was cooling off through the cracks in the \nhull.  Steam was beginning to form off their bodies, being the only \nwarm things in the room.\nBlacknightmare: &quot;Let&#39;s go to find some blanket&quot; said the femme who \nstarted to shook due cold\nMalice:  The male sat up and began opening crates, sifting through \ntheir contents.  He didn&#39;t pay any attention to anything, it all \nseemed meaningless to him.  In a crate farthest away he found a \nheavy, wool like blanket.  Smiling, he walked back over to \nBlacknightmare and sat next to her, wrapping the heavy blanket \naround them.  &quot;There, that ought to help,&quot; he said smiling.\nBlackNightmare:  the femem moved close to him, her head rested on \nhis shoulder. She felt protected and happy\nMalice:  He put an arm around Blacknightmare, it was getting warm \nunder the blanket.  Which was good, because he hated the cold.  He \nsmiled, and began o nod off to sleep again.\nBlacknightmare: Black nightmare started to touch kindly Malice&#39;s \ncheek \nMalice:  The male reacted to the femme&#39;s touch.  he turned to ward \nher, and smiled.  &quot;That feels good.  Your hand is warm.&quot;\nBlackNgihtmare: &quot;Who could have  belived that&quot; said soflty the \nfemme&quot;Before met you I was a cold person... you teach me to have \nfeelings&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;I did that?  I have that affect on people,&quot; he said, \ngiving her a playful squeeze.\nBlacknightmare: &quot;You don&#39;t know how much&quot;said athe femme so kissed \nhim\nMalice:  Deepens the kiss, it would also serve to warm them up^^.\nBlackNightmare:  The femme moved close to him\nMalice:  The male pulled her closer, and continued he kiss, as they \nneeded no air.\nBlackNightmare: the femme broke the kiss and said &quot;Do you think that \nwe should go to know what&#39;s doing Hellplague? we haven&#39;t heard about \nher in a while&quot;\nMalice:  &quot;Sure, I guess.  I hope she is okay.&quot; He gets up and leaves \nthe blanket around Blacknightmare.\nBlacknightmare stood up and wraped the blanked around both, while \nshe said &quot;It&#39;s enought big to cover us&quot;\nMalice:  Smiles and leads Blacknightmare back to the front of the \ncraft.  Most of the lights were turned off.  He leaned over the \nchair and switched on an overhead light.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s see if the \nship has any sustanable power.&quot;  Starts checking guages.\nBlacknightmare: The femme was looking around, cheking computers and \ncontrols pannels\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
