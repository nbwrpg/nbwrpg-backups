Outside the Rogue Star, two identical panels open up \non both sides of the ship.

The launchers swivel around, and aim themselves along a \ntrajectory to intercept the Vindicator.\n\nOn the 3d visual display at the front of the control room, the \ntrajectory is shown and a lock has been established on the enemy ship.\n\n&quot;Lock established Commander.

His voice is raised slightly, but that is only to draw \n&gt; attention to the situation.  &quot;The Predacons are at it again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmm, interesting ...&quot; Devilcat considers for a moment.  &quot;Keep an \neye \n&gt; on things, I want to know the outcome.  In the meantime -&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This time the computer cuts him off: &quot;Alert, spacecraft now exiting \n&gt; temporal wormhole.  Profile matches that of Vindicator.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vindicator ... crewed by a group of vigilante heroes calling \n&gt; themselves the Forgotten Autobots, for months the Vindicator has \n&gt; dogged the Rogue Star persistently across space - and now time as \n&gt; well.  The mere mention of it is enough to curl a Rogue&#39;s lip.\n&gt; \n&gt; Devilcat&#39;s reaction is immediate: &quot;This time we&#39;re going to finish \n&gt; them off once and for all!  Noir, bring long-range weapons online \nand \n&gt; lock onto the Vindicator!&quot;  Rogue Star boasts several batteries of \n&gt; missiles designed for bombardment of ground targets from orbit - \nbut \n&gt; they work just as well going the other way.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; -- Noir --\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Noir nods, &quot;I see...&quot; She looks around the room, then back to the \n&gt; &gt; incoming video feed.
