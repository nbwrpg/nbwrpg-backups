They \nog up into the air and start doing a quick surveilance of any hurt \nPreds or Alliance on the ground. They find none, and enter Phobia&#39;s \nship.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\n&quot;Alright,&quot; said Brix, &quot;This should be enough hull. Let&#39;s go put it in \nthe ship and get out of here.&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq get pieces of the hull and head for the Iron Ram.\n______________________________________________________________________\nSavage\n\nSavage sees the quils coming. one or two hit him, but the rest are \nevaporated in the giant fireball that Savage shot right towards the \ntwo lovebots.\n______________________________________________________________________\nZava\n\nZava struggled to consioussness. She had been in Stasis lock for \nawhile, and the battle was almost over. She could see Deemos, still \nifghting alone. She struggled to her feet, and walked, always \ndirectly behind Deemos. When she got to him she whispered in his here.\n\n&quot;Deemos, look! Their escape ship is almost ready to leave. Give me \npermission to stow aboard, and I&#39;ll sabotage it. It&#39;ll be destroyed \nin huge flames. I have no problem&#39;s dying for the Chosen Ones.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nJust when things looked their bleakess, Vulois thought he saw light \nahead.\n\n&quot;Windrazor! Terradive! Come quickly! Light is ahead! That&#39;s the \nelectric system I installed. It gets it&#39;s power from the TM3 Machine, \nmade by our late friend Soundwave. If only I still had the driver. \nIt&#39;s probably still in Hell Beast&#39;s base, lying in his safety vault. \nBut anyway, let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\nVulois broke into a run at this hope.\n\n\n"}}
