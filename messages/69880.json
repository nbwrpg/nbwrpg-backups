He simply nodds in agreement.\n\n&quot;Yeah ya got that right Scorpono=\r\nk,looks like they were tryn&#39; ta cut back on fuel costs of somethn&#39;..  Fligh=\r\nt takes a lot outa a bot, and if the creators can skimp on Energon expenses=\r\n they will.  You can blame those miserable Quintessons for that, greedy sla=\r\ng balls they are.. I bet it was their idea ta skimp out on the flight capab=\r\nilities for future Decepticon generations.  One of these days I&#39;m gonna sho=\r\nve that one in their faces.. All five of &#39;em.&quot;  \n\nHe gets the remainder of =\r\nthe arrows out of his legs, and manages to transform into SUV mode.  All th=\r\ne while, Tucson still remaining still.\n\nNight Shift knew exactly what direc=\r\ntion to take as far as getting back to the Black Fortress.  It would be at =\r\nleast something that would save him from being suspected of treason.  He st=\r\narts his engine and waits for Scorponok.\n\n&quot;Ready when you are.  I&#39;m sure Hy=\r\ndras wants my full report, and I got plenty ta tell em.  Got lots ta tell y=\r\nou too.  Ohh yeah, some juicy gossip all right...  And it starts with Prett=\r\ny boy there, who&#39;s on the ground.  He ain&#39;t gonna be down&#39;n out for long, o=\r\nhh no.  He&#39;s got too much power behind him ta do that.  He&#39;ll be out of it =\r\nfor some time, but I doubt no more than twenty four hours. But lemme tell y=\r\na the good stuff when we get back ta the fortress.&quot;\n\nTucson unsuspectedly s=\r\nets up a two way com link between what&#39;s happening within his radius and th=\r\ne Ark.  He sends a text message back to Kup and Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; So far so go=\r\nod.  Mild suspicion but nothing significant yet.  I think they&#39;re buying in=\r\nto him.  When they go, and are well out of range, tell me, and I&#39;ll return =\r\ninside the Ark.  Night Shift&#39;s doing his part, now it&#39;s my turn to do mine.=\r\n&quot;\n\nHe pauses between text messages.\n\n&quot; By the way, be ready to light our da=\r\nrkest hour.  It&#39;s time.&quot;\n\nFor once, all the reservations, apprehensions and=\r\n anxieties Tucson had were all melting away.  He realized that there was no=\r\n going back to trying to correct the mistakes which he thought were already=\r\n made, but it was time to step forward and leave new legacies and bring new=\r\n hope to those who need it badly.  It was time to step up to the plate and =\r\naccept destiny for what it was and not as he thought it should have been.  =\r\nThe Matrix had once asked him what his self worth was.  And now, he could s=\r\nee it.  He was worth a great deal. Not just as a warrior but as an innovato=\r\nr, and a new light of hope for all Maximal, and Autobot kind.  Things did h=\r\nappen along the way, which he thought he could controll, but now as he lies=\r\n motionless, he realizes that some times not all situations can be handled =\r\nwithout some degree of difficulty.  There would be hard times, and Chaos wa=\r\ns the balance between Harmony and insanity.  Without it there wouldn&#39;t be a=\r\n planet to protect and a universe to save.   He sends one more message to L=\r\nord Elder.\n\n&quot; I believe I owe another visit to Optimus Prime.  The Matrix m=\r\nay be expecting me.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supe=\r\nrcyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yeah, fly, right.. I would if someone remembe=\r\nred ta install that capability in me. Apparently somehow I missed the boat =\r\nwhen that feature was ben&#39; built inta the Decepticons. Still kinda miffed a=\r\nbout it too. Unfortunately I&#39;m stuck stickn&#39; ta ground travel.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scorpo=\r\nnok nodded as a frown appeared on his face. &quot;You newer modeled\n&gt; Decepticon=\r\ns with no flight capability.&quot; Scorponok said, his voice\n&gt; colored by annoya=\r\nnce and displeasure.  &quot;What a waste.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Swiftly he shifted into his larg=\r\ne Scorpion mode. In this mode he was\n&gt; fully as large as an armored troop c=\r\narrier, his claws were large\n&gt; enough to engulf a warrior, At his rear a st=\r\ninger was mounted that\n&gt; could easily reach to his front, and could double =\r\nas a cannon, and\n&gt; multiple gun mounts positioned along his frame.\n&gt; \n&gt; He =\r\nflexed his claws a couple times and then began to move quickly away\n&gt; from =\r\nthe vicinity of the Ark and towards Hydras&#39; base, &quot;Come on.&quot; he\n&gt; said impe=\r\nriously.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have reached Nightshift, but he can&#39;t fly. Scorponok said =\r\ninto his\n&gt; radio link to Hydras, We will have to come back on the ground.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
