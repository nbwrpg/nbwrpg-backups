He\n&gt; holds the end of his right arm where the hand used to be as sparks\n&gt; fly from the wound.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus: Gahh! No honor among you... Then I&#39;ll do this your way!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimsu replaces the hand with the extending buzzsaw he has on that\n&gt; limb. He jumps at Cyclonus as if he was to slash him with the saw but\n&gt; it is a ruse. While close to his enemy, Rodimus activates one of his\n&gt; rockets which swings up over his right shoulder and launches at\n&gt; Cyclonus. Rodimus was willing to take himself out to stop Cyclonus...\n\nCyclonus almost laughs, &quot;You talk of honor? This from the AUTOBOT who\nthrows sand in the middle of battle?&quot; Cyclonus casually reaches up to\nblock Rodimus&#39; rather clumsy attack with the buzzsaw and he was about\nto say something else when Rodimus&#39; rocket catches him full in the\nchest, sending him sailing through the air! He lands on the ground on\nhis back and continues to slide, making a deep furrow in the sand. \n\nCyclonus rose from the ground, his chestplate cracked, dented and\nscortched from Rodimus&#39; attack. He nodded as he turned slightly and\npointed at Rodimus, &quot;You decieve yourself Rodimus.&quot; his voice is deep\nand powerful, easily filling the distance between them. His mouth\nquirked into a smile devoid of even the slightlest hint of humor, &quot;You\nare loosing yourself! Even now you are becoming what you strive to\ndestroy, a warrior who will stoop to any means to achieve victory and\nyou justify it by mere words.&quot;\n\nCyclonus shook his head almost in sadness, &quot;If I were Galvatron perhaps\nI would applaud you.&quot; His optics focused on Rodimus, &quot;but I am not so I\ncan give you only pity, and perhaps the only other thing of honor: A\nwarrior&#39;s DEATH!&quot;\n\nCyclonus fires a missile, it flares once, flames bursting from behind\nit as it streaks at Rodimus prime!\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better pen pal. \nText or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
