Lord Elder, inform me at once if you hear anything p=\r\nertaining to Rodimus and the others.  I know where I must go, but do not kn=\r\now what I will find. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He gives Talon a gentile rub on her face with h=\r\nis snout and does the same for his babies.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Stay strong for me, I wil=\r\nl return as soon as I can.

His armor shi=\r\nmmers brilliantly as it catches the light of the sky, appearing almost like=\r\n lightning as his long tail trails behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once in the air, he giv=\r\nes another beacon roar, even louder than the first, to see if Rodimus and t=\r\nhe others can hear him.  This intern sounds just like a boom of thunder whi=\r\nch has a habit of rattling the ground somewhat.  Yes there be a dragon soar=\r\ning over the skies as Tucsons shadow is cast over the entrance of the cave =\r\nwhere the Enemy was last seen.  Another booming roar confirms his arrival a=\r\ns he circles the area.\n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who specializes in illustration, u=\r\nsing traditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also specialize in hand made c=\r\nrafts.
