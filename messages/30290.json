With a full moon and \nseveral large \n&gt; lamp posts as there light, the mining area was visible and secure.\n&gt;        &quot;Hell Beast, we&#39;ve found the computer core. Its deep though. \nwere \n&gt; going to have to blast.&quot; Tarantulas rhasped to his commander, while \nholding a \n&gt; scanning pad showing the location of the core.\n&gt;        Hell Beast gave his authorization. The Predacons quickly set \nto work \n&gt; placing explosives and connecting fuses. Within an hour the blast \ncomponenets \n&gt; were complete.\n&gt;        A loud crack sounded the first series of erruptions of the \nblasts, \n&gt; followed by several smaller explosions. When the smoke cleared a \ngaping hole \n&gt; led them down into the ground where a portion of the ship had sunk.\n&gt;        Inside it appeared to be frozen in time. Everything looked as \nif it \n&gt; hadnt been moved at all. This section of the ship was most likely \nmade blast \n&gt; prof by the investors, for safety. Tarantulas quickly had the core \nlifted \n&gt; from the hole and set on a trailer pulled by Tankkor.\n&gt;        &quot;Excellent work. Lets head back now and get some rest.&quot; Hell \nBeast \n&gt; ordered as he boarded the troop transport. The troops follwed and \nthe lights \n&gt; power was cut. The mining operation was lit shortly by the red glow \nof the \n&gt; jet thrusts, but they faded and the site was in darkness once more.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Ominous Prime watched them go. The Neo Decepticon Empire was \nstealing \n&gt; materials....important materials. He needed to find out why. And was \nthis \n&gt; cause worth joining?\n&gt;        The Energonians were never going to be able to destroy all \nthe \n&gt; transformers on this planet. Not without altering history forever. \nAs much as \n&gt; Ominous hated to admit it, his small faction was going to have to \njoin some \n&gt; big faction or slowly dwindle into nothingness.\n&gt;        A meeting needed to be arranged, and soon.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Mortem wandered around Allience Island with Tal-X close in \npursuit, \n&gt; inside his tech skeleton body. The flora of the island was very \nwelcoming to \n&gt; a bot who had spent a month en route to this planet.\n&gt;        &quot;When will we see Zardus?&quot; Tal asked, his electric face \nbouncing on a \n&gt; digital screen.\n&gt;        Mortem didnt know. They walked inside the Iron Fist, and \nproceeded \n&gt; down a large corridor. &quot;I think the bridge is this way. he should be \nthere.&quot; \n&gt; Then she stopped. &quot;But I doubt we would even make it that far with \nsecurity.&quot;\n&gt;        She sent a message to Zardus to meet them soon, somewhere in\n\n\n"}}
