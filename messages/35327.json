He had served the original Autobots with Cliffjumper, and\nunderstood where he was coming from. Even thought the Autobots werent\nwarriors at the time, they still acted more professionally. He almost\nunderstood why Cliffjumper was so discusted with the higher ups of the\nMaximals. They all stood and looked at the larger group of Maximals.\n\n"}}
