Your probably wondering where the hell I&#39;ve \nbeen. Ya see, I&#39;m in the process of moving and my internet has been \ncut off, as well as cable tv...*sigh* Anyway I havn&#39;t been able to \nget on and do anything in any RPG, forum or anything else I&#39;m \ninvolved with online. I&#39;m only on now because I managed to get on a \nfriends comp. Hopefully I&#39;ll be online soon after the move. It&#39;s \ngoing to be a few weeks though. If you havn&#39;t done something already \nwith my charrs then the other council members should take them. If \nyou feel you need to find a council replacment for me then do so. I \nmiss RPing and everyone here. Untill next time NBW. Peace!\n\n~RoboRick\n\n\n"}}
