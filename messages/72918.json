He was a combat mech, usually sent into the\nmost dangerous situations and his team&#39;s job was to fix it. He was\nknown as a Rough and tough, and he was a well known MAXIMAL who had an\nexpert team, but one that very few had met in person and fewer still\nwho knew him personally.\n\nSHARPEDGE was shaking his head as he was helped into the room. &quot;What\nare you doing Guiledart?!?&quot; He asked.\n\nTaking a moment to manipulate controls on the panel in front of him\nGUILEDART finally turned to regard SHARPEDGE. &quot;I am helping you fool!&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?!?&quot; SHARPEDGE said, obviously not trusting GUILEDART.\n\n&quot;Because helling you helps Magmatron.&quot; He said in his deep tones.\n&quot;Something has happened to him, he is not acting like himself.&quot;\n\n&quot;And so you want us to take out your own commander?&quot; SHARPEDGE said\nincredulously.\n\nGUILEDART grunted, &quot;No. If you touch him I will be right behind you to\ndestroy you!&quot;\n\n&quot;Then what do you want from us?&quot; STAMPY said the white MAXIMAL finding\ncourage to speak.\n\nThere was a soft chuckle from GUIELDART, &quot;I want you to take out\nSaberback&#39;s machine.&quot; He said darkly. &quot;I believe that is what is\ncausing all of this mess.&quot;\n\nIn an energy door opened, one that would transport them to their destination.\n\n&quot;And why should we do this for you?&quot; SHARPEDGE said rising to his\nfeet, but still not quite raising his weapon against GUIELDART\nalthough it was ready.\n\nGUILEDART smiled wickedly, &quot;Because if you don&#39;t the machine will\ndrain your world of its last defenses against Unicron and then call\nhim to finish the job.&quot; he pointed at the energy door, &quot;Now go!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
