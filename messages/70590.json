Set the shuttle in the last know coordinates &quot;\n\nThere were many soldier already at the shuttle when Hydras arrived,\nInsecticon and Bruticus-X, both of whom had just finished being\nrepaired. The remaineder of the fuzors, Injector, Buzzclaw,\nTerrorgator, and Quickstrike. Lastly came the soldiers that had served\nwith the old Megatron - Terrorsaur, Waspinator, and Inferno.\n\nOnly Cyclonus, Scourge, Deepstryke, Blackrazor and Phobia stayed\nbehind, presumably to care for Hydras&#39; base, to be sure that it would\nbe protected. Hydras&#39; The shuttle quickly started up, and with a boost\nof power quickly took off in the direction of Skyshadow&#39;s last\ntransmission.\n\nAfter nearly 30 minutes of flight the ship was begining to come to the\napproximate location of Skyshadow&#39;s last known location, but so far\nall that could be scanned was a fading vapor trail. The sensors were\npicking up that the ship had flown through here at one point, but now\nwas no longer visible.\n\nA voice came over the communication band to Hydras&#39; shuttle, &quot;This is\nthe VMP Security Force, you are invading our airspace. You will state\nyour businiess or prepare to be engaged.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
