She knew she could read and project \nthoughts. \n&gt; But she wondered if she could do anything else.  She looked around \n&gt; the lab for a small object. The clipboard near Veratis would work. \n&gt; She closed her eyes and saw the clipboard in her mind. Then she \n&gt; openend her eyes and stared at the clipboard. She concentrated with \n&gt; all her strength. She tried to move the clipboard.  But it didn&#39;t \n&gt; move. She tried again. It still didn&#39;t move. She sighed and \nwondered \n&gt; if she was trying to pick up something too heavy. She looked at a \n&gt; sheet of paper on the console. She closed her eyes and envisioned \nthe \n&gt; paper in her mind. Then she opened her eyes and looked at the \npaper.  \n&gt; She focused her mind and envisioned an invisible hand, reaching out \n&gt; from her mind and grabbing the paper. Then she envisioned the paper \n&gt; being lifted up off the console. The paper giggled a little, then \n&gt; lifted off the console an inch. She smiled, but in doing so, it \nbroke \n&gt; her concentratin and the paper fell down onto the console, then \nslid \n&gt; off and onto the floor. &quot;Oh darn, almost had it too.&quot; she said \nloud, \n&gt; not worrying if Veratis heard her or not.\n\n\n"}}
