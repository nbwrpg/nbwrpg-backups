No\nwonder the satellite demanded a password.&quot;\n\nThere was a slight shrug from PROWL, &quot;I doubt though it was a\ntechnician who did this, they would have the knowledge to get around\nthe system better than that.&quot;\n\nNow it was WOLFGANG who grunted, &quot;It could have been those insect things.&quot;\n\nPOLAR CLAW leaned in his interest finally piqued at WOLFGANG&#39;s comment.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
