He didnt care that they were \n&gt; taller (it&#39;s not a big deal guys). He snarled, then grimaced.

He then quickly snarled, &quot;but when I \n&gt; want your opinion Fireblade, I&#39;LL GIVE IT TO YOU&quot; he yelled as he \nsent \n&gt; a flailing backhand towards the taller robot. With Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; strength, it didnt matter how tall the robot was.\n\n\n"}}
