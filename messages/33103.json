He ussually keeps fighting until all potential enemies are \ndead, or he is ordered. Big post here people. Also sorry Soulstice, \nsince you didnt post with him in a while, I didnt know you wanted \nsomething to do. Dcoburn, what happened to Surgital ?\n\nBIC:\n\nMegatron nodded to Autofire, &quot;Ah yessss, about your payment, I will \ntalk to you about that when you return with the potential soldier. \nThere will also be a bonus involved,&quot; He then turned his attention to \nDive-Bomb, &quot;Dive-Bomb, Razorclaw can handle that, acompany Autofire \nhere,&quot; he then turned towards the base. &quot;Triggerhappy, Skullgrin, get \nout here, I have a new job for you to do,&quot; He then turned to Cepta, \n&quot;Ahhh yesss, Welcome to the Decepticons, I am Megatron&quot; he said in an \nawfully ellegant and ettiquette, &quot;Would you like a tour of the base?&quot; \nHe asks.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFiredrill looked at First Aid funny, like he should know him, &quot;It&#39;s me \nFiredrill&quot; he said.\n\nCliffjumper first noticed Halucigen leave, and then turned around, \nAbominus was big time. He new that the gestalt fighting him would need \nto turn it up a notch to take him out. He still wasnt sure what to do, \nso he walked towards Beachcomber again.\n\nOOC: Thanks Kslaw, I was a bit confused.\nBIC:\n\nHeadstrong loomed over First-Aid, &quot;Well well *snort* if it isnt the \npacifist, you Protectobots sure can&#39;t cut it can you&quot; he mocked, as he \nraised his sword for another strike. Just then Firedrill leapt into \nhim, shoulder first. The force of the tackle sent them both back. \nFiredrill landed to his feet in front of the Predacon, &quot;Just like a \nDecepticon to attack a defensless robot&quot; he spat, showing discust. \n&quot;I&#39;ll tach you what a Decepticon is like *snort*&quot; Headstrong retorted \nfuriously.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
