Better to leave this mudball and return\n&gt; to Cybertron and ready for the next phase.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The gauntlet was thrown then, seeing how much was risen tot he bait DINOBOT\n&gt; threw out.  &quot;Endless little skirmishes over the timeline that never go\n&gt; anywhere.  Disruptions caused to casuality that cannot be undone.  We are\n&gt; better to go to our own ponit of origin and use our knowledge to our\n&gt; advantage and stop skirmishing with a superior enemy.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt was ANTAGONY that looked over at DINOBOT her optics narrowed,\n&quot;Don&#39;t you get it?&quot; She stalked towards him, &quot;Your precious little\ntimeline may already be changed. Your Cybertron may no longer exist!&quot;\n\nTARANTULUS stood up, &quot;What do you mean, speak quickly my patience is\nwearing thin.&quot;\n\nANTAGONY glanced back at TARANTULUS and then back at SKYSHADOW and\nDINOBOT &quot;I don&#39;t mean that Cybertron is gone . . &quot; She paused for a\nmoment and smiled as if that thought amused her, and then she\ncontinued &quot;But I mean that the Cybertron that you knew may have\nchanged.&quot;\n\nThere was a startled look from TARANTULUS as he frantically began\ntyping a message into one of his companels next to him, apparently\ntrying to contact someone on CYBERTON.\n\n&quot;And I take it that if we won&#39;t to make any changes back then we need\nto be the first to reach it.&quot; SKYSHADOW said calmly.\n\nANTAGONY turned to look at SKYSHADOW with dark optics and then nodded.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
