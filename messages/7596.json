I have\nturned\n&gt; over Commandership of the Predacons to Wild Dance Mare and I want him also\nto\n&gt; replace me on the council. Please, do NOT take me off the list, I enjoy\n&gt; reading the posts but I am unable to keep up with my responsabilities by\n&gt; writing them. I was one of the first members of this RPG, and after a year\nI\n&gt; am proud to say it is an excellent association. Thank you all for a\nwonderful\n&gt; time.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: The Decepticon vessle was complete. With the help from Transanulas and\n&gt; Gremlin they had killed alot of time. Now, they began to move equitment\nfrom\n&gt; Ominous Prime&#39;s lair into the ship. After the move, they began to seal the\n&gt; caveren and then the ship slowly exited the cave and was airborne. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Tell Hell Beast were coming to get him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Marine nodded and sent the message. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast shouted orders and had the Predacons that were leaveing\nwith\n&gt; him take important items and leave items for the next Predacon Commander.\n:::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Pheniox ::: The energon cargo holds are ready to be loaded on the\nshuttle.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast shighed. He was going to miss the Neo Beast Wars, but time\nwas\n&gt; gaining and he had to depart. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast looked at his crew ::: Pheniox, and Jackle, you will come\nwith\n&gt; me to Cybertron.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia spun around in shock, as did Demonaand a strange bot\nthat\n&gt; looked similar to Hell BEast who just entered. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: What? Thats not fair! I deserve to go!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast pointed his wepon level with her head, ::: You deserve to\ndie\n&gt; with the bitch Demona!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Suddenly, Stryfe aimed his gun at Hell Beast ::: Sorry, dad, but im\n&gt; taking command o-\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Jackle fired a single shot into his head, sending him into stasis. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Demona ::: No!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast fired on Demona, sending her down to the floor with a\ngroan,\n&gt; dead. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; :: Black Aracnia, in the confusion, transformed into beast mode and\nescaped\n&gt; the ship. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Bring my son with us, he can be reprogramed. Dump the\nbody\n&gt; of Demona is the antimatter chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~`\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: The Decepticon shuttle hovered over the Predacon base. Useing tractor\n&gt; beams in successfully transported the energon into its own cargo holds.\nThen,\n&gt; Hell BEast, Jackle, and Pheniox boarded. Transanulas, Gremlin, MArine and\n&gt; Ominous waited. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, I will miss it.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Gremlin ::: What of Megatron?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Good point.....\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Megatron glanced around his chamber, Ra had vanished, but Waspinator\n&gt; stayed. He felt a change going on. He knew Hell Beast was leaveing, but he\n&gt; would stay to corrupt the history of Cybertron as long as he could. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Set and Ra ran as swift as they could to the Decepticon shuttle.\nQuickly\n&gt; they boarded and explained themselfs. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Set ::: I cant stay here anymore! Im sure that they think Im dead and\nall\n&gt; my momey is being split up among my workers. I must go back and look after\n&gt; it. Ra, being my body guard, is coming with me.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast nodded. He didnt care as long as he was going to be able to\n&gt; leave. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: The shuttle rose higher and higher through the sky until it made a\nrather\n&gt; bumby orbit. Now, Hell BEast, Gremlin, Jackle, Pheniox, MArine,\nTransanulas,\n&gt; Ominous Prime, Set, and Ra all looked down at the prehistoic planet with a\n&gt; heavey heart. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: It was good while it lasted, but we must put the past\n&gt; behinde us. Everyone to your stations!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: They all wnet to there stations, pressed the correct keys, and a\n&gt; transwarp corridor opened before them. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell BEast, with a sound of victory in his voice that had been long\n&gt; missed, ::: Forward, set a course for Cybertron. The war agianst the\nMaximals\n&gt; and Autobots has just begun!\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: With the laughter of the crew, the small Decepticon shuttle passed\n&gt; through and the corridor and it closed. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia cursed. She was now stuck on this damn planet. All that\n&gt; remained was the Predacon base. She entered, set up the defences, and sent\n&gt; out a message. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: All Predacons, Hell Beast has left the planet for\n&gt; Cybertron. I encourage that Megatrons group come and join with Hell\nBeast&#39;s\n&gt; former group to make one powerful fraction. Sadly, I was left behinde but\n&gt; that isnt going to stop me!\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; Thats all folks. I have said my peace with my characters. The fate of\nBlack\n&gt; Aracnia and Waspinator and Rat Trap is up to Wild Dance Mare. Now, I want\nto\n&gt; write the future of my characters briefly in this next section.\n&gt;\n&gt;     After there return to Cybertron, Hell Beast resumed office as Senetor\nand\n&gt; eventually made his way on to the Council. With his supply of Energon, the\n&gt; Predacons made fantastic advancements in warfare.\n&gt;     Pheniox took command of her Anti-Maximal Terrorist group and took out\na\n&gt; fleet of ships by the time of her death in battle. A memorial stands in\nher\n&gt; honor on Cybertron.\n&gt;     Jackle went into the Espionage business and infiltrated several\nAutobot\n&gt; offices. He was caputerd on one such mission and imprisoned. After a messy\n&gt; and bloody escape his where-abouts are unknown.\n&gt;     Gremlin went into the military and turned out to make a fantastic\n&gt; Colonel. He invaded a Maximal colony and still holds it in occupation.\n&gt;     Transanulas, along with Ominous Prime, researched Liquid Energon and\nwith\n&gt; it made radical changes to fule. Entire fleets of Predacon ships now run\non\n&gt; it, and a whole new species of Transformer was created and called\n&gt; Energonians. Ominous got his wish. Transanulas, even though he is  insane,\nis\n&gt; a respected Scientist.\n&gt;     Set returned to his company to find it broken and spilt among his\n&gt; minions. He had them killed and resumed command of the largest Predacon\n&gt; franchise in the Galaxy. Ra is still his body guard, and also has a large\n&gt; part in the underworld of Cybertron.\n&gt;     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Hell Beast retired at his old age. On a small remote moon he built a\n&gt; manor house. He remembers the days of the Neo Beast Wars and smiles at his\n&gt; successes. Now, an old bot and out of date, he mostly spends his time\nwriting\n&gt; books on his experiences and gives advice to those who are in politics.\nWith\n&gt; his influence he has gained much respect.\n&gt;     Now, he sits at a window and stares out at a planet similar to earth\nand\n&gt; wonders what the fates of his friends, commrads, and enemy&#39;s were. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the end of the story of Hell Beast and the first crew of Predacons\n&gt; that fought in the NEo Beast Wars.\n&gt;\n&gt; The End\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/7081/13/_/_/_/964039176/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
