They had him all right, but he wasn=\r\n&#39;t about to just throw in the towel.  This made him extremely angry and whe=\r\nn he was just an Autobot, anger would often power his all wheel drive syste=\r\nm to do things far beyond his normal capabilities.  \n\n&quot; You think you have =\r\npower over my comrades and myself, right now it looks that way, but there i=\r\ns one thing we have that you will never have, and never will be able to att=\r\nain.  A power that only we know how to use, and a power that comes from wit=\r\nhin.  It&#39;s a force that even overshadows your own yet a power that is so si=\r\nmple that even the most sentient of beings are capable of using it.  You ha=\r\nve greed and greed is power, but nothing can ever overshadow the power that=\r\n comes from true compassion, caring, and love.   Yes, LOVE.  You are not ca=\r\npable of this power and never will be.  It&#39;s true as the old saying goes...=\r\n LOVE CONQOURS ALL!&quot;\n\nCarefully, in Vehicle form, Tucson is still stationar=\r\ny, yet his front hood begins to glow and pulsate even brighter than before.=\r\n  In this realm he could not transform, yet, in the other realm he was alre=\r\nady transformed. He uses an indoor port to hook himself up to Vestige, shar=\r\ning with him his power.  The power that pulsates from his heart and not fro=\r\nm the power of the Matrix.\n\n&quot; Our hearts are all but the same Vestige, we m=\r\nust combine our compassions for each other, and project it toward others wh=\r\no also have the ability to reach deep down in their hearts.  Only then can =\r\nwe save Rodimus from the grip of these demonic creatures.&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Tucson floors his gas pedal and pushes on at a rapid speed, even more =\r\nso than he was used to. He was determined to get through the crisis and fin=\r\nd Rodimus. His heart had shown him the way, and there was nothing anyone co=\r\nuld do to stop him. With Vestige in his cab, he keeps careful watch over hi=\r\ns newly found old friend, and secures him with a saftey belt around his sho=\r\nulders, to keep him safely in place on his seat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hold on Vestige, =\r\nthe ride may get rough, but we will make it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige makes no movemen=\r\nt, but with Tuscon&#39;s help he is securely held\n&gt; in the seat of Tuscon&#39;s cab=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a burst of power from Tuscon the powerful vehicle rushed foward=\r\n,\n&gt; pushing through the rest of the hall and powering through the frame of\n=\r\n&gt; the doorway. As Tuscon came into the room he was immediately ensnared\n&gt; i=\r\nn what would appear to be vines or perhaps more of those Tendrils\n&gt; similar=\r\n to the ones that had bound Rodimus before all this started.\n&gt; They attempt=\r\ned to snake thier way around his vehicular mode to hold\n&gt; him in place.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The walls and floor of this room were white, sterile and clean. The\n&gt; flo=\r\nor was crafted from some sort of metal as were the walls. In the\n&gt; middle o=\r\nf the room a single bed surrounded by all sorts of scanning\n&gt; and medical e=\r\nquipment. Three insect creatures were standing over the\n&gt; bed. They were ob=\r\nviously of the same race as the spider like creatures\n&gt; and the winged ones=\r\n that had been harrassing Tuscon before, but these\n&gt; were in a more humanoi=\r\nd mode, a &#39;robot&#39; mode if you will. All three of\n&gt; them were female, at lea=\r\nst they would appear to be if a human were\n&gt; looking on. On the bed a figur=\r\ne lay strapped down, the form blocked\n&gt; from view by the figures that stood=\r\n over it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You are too late Autobot!&quot; One of the three females said, t=\r\nhe taller\n&gt; of the two in the center. &quot;We have all that we need from this o=\r\nne, and\n&gt; even now your data will fill our banks with data, data that we ca=\r\nn use\n&gt; to bring about your destruction.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The tendrils that were strug=\r\ngling to hold on to Tuscon were begining\n&gt; to change not only color to matc=\r\nh Tuscon, but also thier texture and\n&gt; shape were modifying as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe larger female stepped away from the bed to walk towards Tuscon,\n&gt; &quot;The q=\r\nueen will want you for herself.&quot; The female smiled, &quot;We shall\n&gt; see that yo=\r\nu are prepared for her.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the female approached it was possible to s=\r\nee the figure on the bed,\n&gt; it looked like Hot Rod!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
