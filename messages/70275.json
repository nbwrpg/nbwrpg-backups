With senses twice as strong due \n&gt; to the compensation for his sight, the smell would prove over powering to \n&gt; a bot such as himself, yet, through the stench, his determination wins \n&gt; over replusion, and presses on, slowly so is not to injure Rodimus, and \n&gt; attempt a safe rescue.  He also keeps in touch with Lord Elder and \n&gt; Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Perceptor, I want you to know that if you were to chose \n&gt; between saving your own life, and the lives of your comrades, you would \n&gt; probably want to save your comrades instead of yourselves.  The compassion \n&gt; for a comrade has far out powered my better judgement for survival.  I can \n&gt; not deny what my heart spark tells me.  And it has told me that there is \n&gt; no greater power than that which is held by all Autobots and Maximals a \n&gt; like.  Rat Trap, I hear you too, I know this is upsetting you greatly, and \n&gt; if you had not extended your own heart spark to help me the first time, I \n&gt; would not have made it this far.  All of you who worry for me, take heart, \n&gt; I&#39;ve been through worse.  And please, understand that I failed Rodimus \n&gt; once, I will not fail him a second time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He transforms to robot mode, as he gets extremely close to Rodimus, so is \n&gt; not to cause too much damage due to the force of tires hitting the ground. \n&gt; He attempts to clear the rubble around him gently, and slowly with his \n&gt; hands.  As dark as it was, it appeared as if some light was not shining \n&gt; through.  He stops for a moment, and now sees blurry objects becomming \n&gt; more focused as the area around him becomes visible.  Again the power of \n&gt; the Matrix within him, could sense that he would need his eyes once again. \n&gt; He closes them for a moment, and re opens them able to see everything \n&gt; clearly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; By the Matrix..  Lord Elder, Legacy, Perceptor, I&#39;ve got my vision back. \n&gt; I can now see everything around me clearly.  Now, I can also hear Rodimus \n&gt; on the other end.  I&#39;m attempting to get through the rubble, but it may \n&gt; take a moment or so to do it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he continues to dig, he keeps an ear out for Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, if you can hear me, I need you to follow my voice and dig \n&gt; through the rubble on your end, to meet up with me.  I&#39;ve got my vision \n&gt; back and I am now fully capable of getting us both out of here safely. \n&gt; Please, respond.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; For Tucson Prime, it would be all or nothing.  If he couldn&#39;t get Rodimus \n&gt; out safely, he too, would remain behind to be burried beneath the rubble.\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Night Shift swallows hard as does Rat Trap who has his tail \n&gt; firmly in his hands in a tense posture.  Quick Stride&#39;s ears are forward, \n&gt; as he too appears nervous.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s Tucson for ya, Just like Optimus Prime.  Optimus would&#39;ve done \n&gt; the same thing, gone right back in ta get his man outa there alive.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks to Night Shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, they are related.  Like Ancestor, like predascessor.  And Optimus \n&gt; Prime always came outa tough situations in one piece.  I just hope Wheels \n&gt; can too.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride paws the ground nervously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Then again, I dunno if Optimus ever had ta storm Hydras&#39; fortress ta get \n&gt; his comrades outa danger.  This is a new challenge in Autobot History. But \n&gt; we gotta believe that Tucson Prime will make history when he gets Rodimus \n&gt; prime out of there in one piece.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift and Rat Trap nodd.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s a good hope ta have Quickstride.  We gotta believe in Tucson, \n&gt; guys.  That&#39;s our greatest power, believe in our allies and our friends. \n&gt; Somethn&#39; Hydras doesn&#39;t usually practice.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift turns to Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Belief is all we got gon&#39; for us now Legacy.  We gotta hold onta that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Rat Trap, Tuscon, Quickstride, Kup\n&gt;&gt; Location: Area outside of the Black Fortress\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wheels! Lord Elder, This is Rat Trap, Wheels was commn&#39; out with the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; others, but Rodimus told &#39;em ta go, he did, but he just turned around \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and now he&#39;s gon&#39; back in for Rodimus! I dunno if he&#39;s gonna be able ta \n&gt;&gt; &gt; come out in one piece!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Elder&#39;s voice came back on the same channel, &quot;What?!?&quot; Elder\n&gt;&gt; paused, obviously taking a moment to digest what had been sent to him\n&gt;&gt; in a few short words. &quot;Rodimus told him to go back? Where is Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; now, and where is Tuscon?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Tuscon?&quot; Elder said, trying to contact Tuscon directly, although Rat\n&gt;&gt; Trap could probably hear it as well, &quot;What is your situation?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Inside, Tucson&#39;s many wheels turn rapidly as he tries to reach Rodimus. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Because of his failure two years past, he tries to redeem himself by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; actually succeeding in bringing out his comrade alive. He knew the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; attempt could endanger his life as well, but by Primus he had to try. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; He sounds his horn three more times, hoping that Rodimus would hear \n&gt;&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon is quickly able to reach the wall of debris that stood between\n&gt;&gt; him and Rodimus. The wall looked to be quite thick and impenetrable,\n&gt;&gt; however not as impenetrable as it had before Tuscon had left the first\n&gt;&gt; time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dirt and stone and even bits of plant matter still filled the\n&gt;&gt; entrance, but it is obvious that the previous explosion had weakened\n&gt;&gt; the slide of debris in several places. The smell of sulfur was in the\n&gt;&gt; air, obviously coming from the other side of the slide.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, Hydras\n&gt;&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Throne Room\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The door to the throne room was flung open, and there standing in the\n&gt;&gt; doorway was the dirty and dented form of Cyclonus. He was covered from\n&gt;&gt; nearly head to toe in dirt, soil and other bits of immediately\n&gt;&gt; unidentifiable matter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Hydras!&quot; Cyclonus said as he spotted his commander and sprang into\n&gt;&gt; the room. &quot;What has happened?&quot; Cyclonus attempted to grab his scanner\n&gt;&gt; and then realized that he had lost it somewhere. He glanced around for\n&gt;&gt; a moment and then grabbed one from near the throne and began running\n&gt;&gt; over Hydras, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
