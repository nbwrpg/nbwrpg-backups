As=\r\nh and smoke billowed around him as the ground rumbled dangerously. \n\n&quot;Marau=\r\nder, Report!&quot; came an imperious voice over his internal coms. \n\n&quot;Yes, I am =\r\nhere commander.&quot; came the reply, Marauder&#39;s voice deep and yet  eloquent. E=\r\nven as he spoke it was if the still figured was returning to life. Winglike=\r\n protrusions that attached to his back ruffled slightly as his formed strai=\r\nghtened and went from menacing to more majestic for a moment. &quot;What are you=\r\nr orders Lord Vorpral?&quot; he continued, his voice almost aristocratic for a m=\r\noment. \n\n&quot;You are to assume command of the minion, and you are to report to=\r\n leader Unicron, and he will give you orders.&quot; Came General Vorpral&#39;s voice=\r\n over the channel. &quot;You are ready for our conquest!&quot;\n\nWith a simple nod Mar=\r\nauder leaped into the air, his form shifting and contorting until he assume=\r\nd a rather fearsome looking starfighter! \n\nWith a burst of power that rival=\r\ned the heat and fury of the volcanic eruptions around Marauder ripped into =\r\nthe skies above, a flaring fire into an already red sky. \n\n&quot;My Lord!&quot; Marau=\r\nder opened a channel to the world destroyer known as Unicron as he continue=\r\nd his skyward lift. &quot;I await your command. The time has come!&quot;\n\n&lt;TAG - Unic=\r\nron&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
