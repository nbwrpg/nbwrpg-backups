She wanted to go and hide.  She could hardly \nlook into Scorponok&#39;s eyes.  She just looked at the floor.\nShe whispered to Scorponok, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;\nShe didn&#39;t know what else to say.  She knew that she was very lucky this \ntime round.  But she knew that she would have to watch herself in the \nfuture. She just looked at the floor.  She felt to ashamed to look into her \nbeloved&#39;s eyes.\n\n-----Original Message-------------\nFrom:   &lt;JP3884@a...&gt;\nDate: Tue Jun 27, 2000 0:23am\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n::: Megatron nodded ::: Very well.
