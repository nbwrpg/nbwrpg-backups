I am \nalso saying that the Matrix MIGHT be with the NEW Omega Prime which \nwas created when the original Omega Prime was created in RID (thanks \nfor the abbriviation all the typing was hurting my fingers). It was \nsome kind of power surge, but if you like we could just say the Matrix \nstayed in the other demision. I just think Omega Primes cool.  The \nonly problem with that series is they call out there attacks. What do \nthey think transformers is Pokemon?  I won&#39;t be doing that if I can \nget this approved. And I might want to point out that all the \nTranformer Series I&#39;ve seen have been BW, BM, RID, and 1 episode of Go \nBots.  I don&#39;t know any others.  ALSO BM WAS MY FAVORITE SO STOP BAD \nMOUTHING IT!  BW WAS GOOD, BUT HOW IN THE HECK IS LOOKING LIKE ANIMALS \nGOING TO HELP YOU IF YOU&#39;RE STILL TOTALLY MACHINE.  FURTHERMORE WHY \nDID THEY EAT FOOD IF THEY WERE PURLY MACHINE.  AND I LIKED ALL THE \nINTENSE SCENES IN BM WHERE THERE WAS TO MUCH COMEDY IN BW!  LIKE I \nSAID BW WAS STILL GREAT, BUT IT CAN&#39;T MATCH BM!  UNDERSTAND NOW!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Dewboy... you apparently are highly confused and be;lieve bw, \nand RID \n&gt; are entirely different continuities. BW followed the G1 comic and \ncartoon \n&gt; continuity and in that, the Matrix was used up already. Not the \nMatrix \n&gt; dimension itself, but the device that used its powers. Which was the \nAutobot \n&gt; Matrix of leader ship. And as for everyone having portable DNA \nscanners in \n&gt; BM... BM was a piece of crap IMO as well as the opinion of tohers, \nit \n&gt; butchered the charachters old personalities as well as the old \ncontinuity. \n&gt; Now we have Robots in Disguise, RID is not in the same continuity as \nany of \n&gt; those shows. Its an en tirely independant show what was dubbed for \nUS \n&gt; Release. The toys and everything were changed and modified, it has \nno hold on \n&gt; the continuity. Besides the matrix is already present in the RPG \nwhich I \n&gt; think either prowl or Iron Raptor has... although I think it may \nonly be a \n&gt; small matrix device like that used by Big Convoy and Lio Convoy but \nim not \n&gt; fully sure. However the original matrix of leadership is gone and \ndestroyed...\n\n\n"}}
