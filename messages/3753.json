He dropped Dark Mouse and screamed. He went to drag\nhimself.\n&gt; He was so close to the base. He reached towards Dark Mouse. He rolled to\nhis\n&gt; knees in great pain. He lifted his left foot, trying to stand, but up fell\n&gt; back onto his chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back to see Ramulus and Ramhorn. He groaned, then commanded,\n&gt; &quot;Auto-guns--&quot; He ducked as he saw three bright balls of fire from a\nauto-gun\n&gt; fire at Ramhorn.\n&gt;\n&gt; He rolled his head. &quot;Get &#39;er inside!&quot; he said to Double Punch. &quot;Don&#39;t\nstall,\n&gt; don&#39;t let them Maxie&#39;s get &#39;er.&quot; After that, he lifted his chest. &quot;Beast\n&gt; mode.&quot; He transformed. His lumbering claws were a mess, one twisted and\nboth\n&gt; singed. &quot;Flank me, dang it!&quot; he called to Scorponok. &quot;Flank me!&quot; He\n&gt; skittered to the ramp of the ship.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Host your next egroup meeting live on Firetalk.\n&gt; Click here!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5478/10/_/_/_/961358582/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
