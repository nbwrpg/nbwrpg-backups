Also, there was no\n&gt; possible way of your chars going through that far without severe moding on\n&gt; your part. But as KSLawdogg pointed out, if RgDaN modes, it doesn&#39;t mean\nyou\n&gt; can mode. He has been spoken to, and is almost as close as you to being\n&gt; moderated. You can play out your storylines as long as they arn&#39;t filled\nwith\n&gt; moding. So stop arguing and start RPGing. If you have further arguments,\nsend\n&gt; them to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/958522298/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
