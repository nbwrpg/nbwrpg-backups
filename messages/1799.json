Ah don&#39;t trust \nya.&quot; It took a lot of nerve to say that. &quot;If ya want me t&#39; do somethin&#39; wit&#39; \nthat ship, ask me t&#39;, but ah&#39;s ain&#39;t gonna tell ya th&#39; codes. If that \ntin-horn, Hell Beast finds out, ah&#39;s gonna be uh dead bot. By th&#39; way, if \nthat butt kisser ya got by yer side wants t&#39; shoot me, he&#39;s gonna get shot \nright back by them auto-guns.&quot; He paused for a second, and commanded: \n&quot;Computer, target units Shredder an&#39; diagnostic drone.&quot; The auto-guns \nfollowed his orders and swerved around to the two Predacons. &quot;Fire on \nmovements.&quot; he said to it. He transformed to his beast mode, his left claw \nhanging at an awkward angle. He grunted at the pain of the shifting of \nparts. &quot;Tell me when ya wanna behave.&quot; he said, and clawed off to the \nentrance of the ship.\n\nThere was something funny about his code thing---there was none. The \ncomputer relied on him, and acted as the Darkside. It rejected commands from \nHell Beast&#39;s troops, and listened to Megatron&#39;s.\n\nNow there were plans to be had.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
