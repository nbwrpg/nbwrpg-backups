Have I failed Unicron?) \n\nA creak and then a crack broke his concentration as his armrest broke\nunder strain his his clenched fist. His optic scanned the room, as if\nfor the first time remembering that there were others in the room. \n\nHe looked at Nightstrike. &quot;Go!&quot; he said, in commanding tones. &quot;Go with\nthis Cyclonus and his sweeps. Help them, aid them in the name of\nUnicron.&quot; He paused slightly as his optics turned decidedly dark and\ndangerous. &quot;But if he does ANYTHING that is not in line with Unicron&#39;s\ncommand or objectives, you will let me know immediatly!&quot;\n\n \nPreston\n(NPC - Vorpal)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
