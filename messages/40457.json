However, there was a faction a long time ago \nin \n&gt; this RPG called the Energonians. They were energy beings much like \n&gt; yours, just they used energon energy instead of chaotican, and \nZardus \n&gt; had a long rivalry with their leader (who happened to be one of the \n&gt; bots that helped Zardus and Wolfgang make the Alliance), so he \nknows \n&gt; how to handle energy beings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And the guy who controls Mustex: how&#39;d Mustex get onto Alliance \n&gt; Island? The shields were up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/FZ/DevilDuer/Mosquitor::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus frowns, thinking Frostbite&#39;s transmission over for a \nsecond \n&gt; and then replying. &quot;I would preffer meeting in neutral territory. \n&gt; Would the peninsula near my base be convenient for you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He closes that link, and recieves Orchestra&#39;s transmission. &quot;This \n&gt; is Zardus, Alliance commander. I&#39;ll lower the shields so that you \ncan \n&gt; get through. I&#39;ll be outside, we can meet there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He walks toward the exit, looking at his wrist comp and tapping a \n&gt; few buttons, making a search for &quot;Infecticons&quot;. The search yields \nno \n&gt; matches. Zardus traces the Infecticon transmissions back to their \n&gt; origin, then makes a search for any bots that the Iron Fist&#39;s \n&gt; scanners detected traveling in that direction.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Interesting...&quot; he says to himself, watching video footage of \n&gt; Vampiza flying over Alliance Island, surrounded by Chaotican \nenergy. \n&gt; He zooms in, looking the bot over.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Uncanny resembalance to Energonians, he thinks to himself, \n&gt; activating his comm to Daemos: &quot;Daemos, can you report to my \nposition \n&gt; as soon as possible? I need you to accompany me somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus ends that transmission as well, exiting the base and \nseeing \n&gt; a bot firing. He frowns, tapping a few buttons to turn the autoguns \n&gt; off, and begin lowering the shields.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re either very brave or very stupid,&quot; he says, approaching \nthe \n&gt; shields on the other side of which was Chaostaur (whatever his name \n&gt; is). &quot;Attacking a military installation single-handedly is a very \n&gt; suicidal task.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; FZ nods, looking over the beasts once more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. I must admit I wasn&#39;t expecting you to accomplish this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns and walks toward the exit, the door opening. &quot;Would you \n&gt; like a shuttle to get back to wherever you are from, or would you \n&gt; rather fly by yourself?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; DevilDuer waits for Coput to get into the pilot seat, so that \nthey \n&gt; can get going and he can get away from these weirdos. :-)\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Mosquitor is hit by Hurricane&#39;s shots (post 38120. Sorry for \ntaking \n&gt; so long to reply), stumbling a bit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Traitor!
