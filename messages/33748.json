Personally she would rather forget it all, but\nthey \n&gt; were going ahead with all this whether she supported it or not.\n&gt; She had once thought she had mattered, but she didn&#39;t believe that\nanymore.  \n&gt;    Her troops were considerit but if they didn&#39;t fight or did what\nthey \n&gt; wanted they turned on her and left her to stand there alone.  It\nhurt, and \n&gt; bad but she never showed it. She couldn&#39;t because she didn&#39;t know\nhow.\n&gt; But the cold look in Prowl&#39;s eyes gave her the final indication and\nthen \n&gt; isolated and painful feeling that was growing in her spark flaired.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Then do it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She replied softly before turning her back on Prowl and the rest\nof them, \n&gt; walking away.\n&gt; It sucked feeling helpless. Hurt too, but she took in a deep breath\nand \n&gt; gathered her wits about her. That was, until she heard a backthough\nof \n&gt; Prowls. Wishing that she wouldn&#39;t be such a $%@# sometimes, and even\nthough \n&gt; her expression turned hopeless and eys turned empty, she held onto\nthe team. \n&gt; The Maximal team because, even though they didn&#39;t treat her the best \n&gt; sometimes, she could always turn to them. But she didn&#39;t know for\nhow much \n&gt; longer.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
