So Gangon wanted to defend his little friend. Very well. \nTavatron fired her optic lasers full blast at Gangon. She immedeatly dropped \nback into her previous position, behind the boulder.\n\nDinobot seemed to be holding his own, but she would feel a whole lot better \nif he was standing beside her. Something about being away from him didn&#39;t \nfeel... right. Tav sighed, no matter. She would worry about her feelings \nlater. Right now defending the ark was first priority.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
