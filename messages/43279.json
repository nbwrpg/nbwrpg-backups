He transformed to \nWolverine and shot out the door in a blur.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullet saw the mutant comeing out and tried to get in the way. A \nterrible collision followed which left both bots slideing across the \nfloor of the Black Fortress. Bullet forced himself to his feet, his \ntemper flared. The former Trainer transformed to bull mode, stomped \nhis hoof and readied himself to charge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Standing opposite the bull the Wolverine growled ready for a fight \nbut the sound of a comm echoed through both systems ending the \nconfrontation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Remember my favor.&quot; Blazes voice called through the comm getting \nBullets attention. &quot;We&#39;re near the confrence rooms Silver Scout with \nme and we&#39;re getting ready for a suicide assault against where \nthey&#39;re holding Foxfingers, you two interested?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The silence didn&#39;t last long as both the bull and the Wolverine \nagreed that a suicide mission sounded almost fun.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: CYBERWOLF4 \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 1:40 AM\n&gt;   Subject: others\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Blaze and Silver Scout continued wandering back toward Shivahs \nlocation when Silver Scout picked up a scent. &quot;Foxfingers?&quot; the scent \nwas strong, like he was close. &quot;Kit Kat and Drillbit were with him, \nhe&#39;s in trouble.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   The tigress travelling with the wolf transformed to get a better \nwhif of what the mutant was smelling. &quot;He&#39;s caught, there&#39;s nothing \nwe can do.&quot; she had given up hope of escape. By now her computer \naccess was probably cut off.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;We have to save him, I owe my creator that much.&quot; the wolf \nstarted off in the direction but was quickly stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Then fine, you won&#39;t die alone.&quot; Even without her computer \naccess she could still help, if she couldn&#39;t hack the computer then \nshe wasn&#39;t worth the function her motherboard was printed on. &quot;I&#39;ll \nsee what I can do.&quot; the tigress transformed back to her bot mode. The \nvirus was taking effect eact time she transformed back she could feel \nit impedeing her transformation. Quickly accessing a computer \nterminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still \ntrapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around here.&quot; \nsoon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
