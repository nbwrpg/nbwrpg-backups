And you gotta \nsettle down. This isn&#39;t permanent. It&#39;s just until KitKat gets \nrepaired and we confront that bastard Megatron.&quot; Starscream looked \naround and gave a speech.\n\n&quot;Now, I know I&#39;m not in command, but I&#39;ve got something to say. We \nall know where Meagtron is. Off somewhere with the other Preds, \ntrying to unify all of us into a super group. He&#39;s been spending all \nhis time with the others, while his loyal subjets he abandoned! He \nran away, and left us to die by the hands of the Maximals! Going with \nTarantulas will only play right into Megatron&#39;s hands, as if we \nforget him not fighting with us. So Phobia, this is your choice, but \nI plead with you. Take the Alliance help. Let us all turn our backs \nagainst Megatron. What has he got us? A blown up base. A destroyed \nspaceship. KitKat near death! Let us make our own base. Make an \nAlliance, with the Alliance. Beat Megatron to pods. Strenghten \nourselves under KitKat, and never forgive him for what he has done! \nWe have been fighting amongst ourselves. Four of us have already \nabandoned the group! If we go back to him, he&#39;ll take it as a sign \nthat we don&#39;t care, and make us the low ranks. For the sake of all of \nus, let us go with the Alliance.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
