As &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your plan, its interesting. A good idea. I should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; note that the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; possible instability of such a thing does worry me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a bit, but in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; these times risks must be taken.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Wolfblade:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Oh!&nbsp; Yes sir!&nbsp; Malice and I decided that it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; might be a good idea &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to have a back plan to the cannon already in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; construction.&nbsp; We plan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to use a high mass object and collapse it&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gravity, turning it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a black hole.&nbsp; We wanted to launch it in an area&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of spatial &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; instability.&nbsp; Once the black hole had served it&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; purpose, we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to open a time rift and send it through.&nbsp; The rift&lt;BR&gt;&gt; should &lt;BR&gt;&gt; neutralize &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the intense gravity, expanding it to original&lt;BR&gt;&gt; size.&nbsp; In theory &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anyway.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The femme beamed at her explainatio, then a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thought occured to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Where is Malice\n anyways?&nbsp; He went to do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; something, he said he&#39;d &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; come back.&nbsp; hat was mega cycles ago!&nbsp; Where did he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; go?&quot; she asked, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; masking her concern with annoyance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus: Thank you for reporting, Wolfblade.
