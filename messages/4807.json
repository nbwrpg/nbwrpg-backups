If\n&gt; you\n&gt; can, I would like to Set these machines up so that I can run a few\n&gt; things if megatron wants me too. Also later I&#39;m going to need a few\n&gt; Table&#39;s set up so that if I have to reprogram any other bots I can do\n&gt; so. But, I have one question for you, Will you be my Partner? I could\n&gt; use somebody to watch my back and from the work I seen you do, You\n&gt; could use someone to watch yours.&quot; But of corse that wasn&#39;t the only\n&gt; reason why Scorponok wanted to be parterns, He wanted to be partners\n&gt; so he could be close to her\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/_/_/961985753/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
