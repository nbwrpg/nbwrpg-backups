Multiple Maximal signatures outside \nof the Ark.  He rubbed his chin.  Rather interesting.  He activated his wrist \ncomm. unit.  &quot;Dark One,&quot; he spoke into the device, &quot;This is Nemesis Enforcer. \n Take the Oblitercons and spy on the Maximals at the Ark.  And that&#39;s all I \nwant you to do.  SPY.  Though, if they open fire on you, OBLITERATE them.&quot;\n\n&lt;Ha, ha, ha!&gt; Dark One&#39;s voice came over the comm.  &lt;Very funny.  My team and \nI will move out in 8 cycles&gt;\n\n&quot;Excellent.&quot; Nemesis Enforcer said, deactivating his comm., sitting back in \nhis chair.  Being leader of the Alliance wasn&#39;t that hard.  Maybe he&#39;d put a \ngun to Zardus&#39; head and blow it off when he came back and take over.  Yes.  \nThat was an interesting proposition...\n\n"}}
