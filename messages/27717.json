Looking up, he managed to fire a single bolt of optic \nenergy at one of five incoming grenades.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher ducked to a knee, yelling out in pain as he was hit by the \nexplosion, his burned back causing great pain with every movement.  He fired \noff three optic blasts at three incoming grenades, receiving inner monoluge \norders from the Chaos-Bringer.\n\n---\n\nReflector transformed to his biped mode, firing a two optic blasts at an \nincoming grenade, the explosion of the shuttle from behind sending him \nflipping once through the air, and landing painfully on his back.\n\n"}}
