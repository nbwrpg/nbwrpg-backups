It wasn&#39;t going to open.  And no \none on the other side was going to open it.  She walked back to her \nchair.  She sat in it and looked around.  Nothing in the room would \ngive her cover, except the bed.  She walked over to it and inspected \nit.  She shook her head. Not enought room to try to hide under it, \nshe thought.  She looked around some more and saw nothing useful.\nShe sat back down in her chair and watched the door.  If the maximals \ncame to kill her, then she would have to make a break for it.  She \ntried to figure out an escape plan.  But other than the front door, \nthere wasn&#39;t other way that she knew of to use for escape.\n&quot;The vent.&quot; she said to herself aloud.  She walked over and saw that \nthe vent was too small for her to crawl into.  It wasn&#39;t a main vent \nline.  She went ans sat back down.  She realized that if she must \ndie, she could at least ask to speak to the leader as a final \nrequest.  She sighed and slumped into her chair.  She shook her head \nfor she knew it was hopeless for her now.  She thought that since Rex \nhated Preds so much, he would just kill her and not worry about \nthings. As he said, he was used to fighting.  If he stoppped \nfighting, he most likely wouldn&#39;t know what to do with the rest of \nhis life, she thought.  She just sat there and waited for the end to \ncome.\n\n&quot;All this way to sacrifice myself for a good cause, and all I got for \nit was a bowl of fruit.&quot; She laughed alittle at herself for thinking \nlike that.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
