This is all because I let him go the first time he \nattacked.  As \n&gt;   for you Sarge, I have just as much reason to kill him.  In our \nlast fight I \n&gt;   lost an arm and a leg defending others.  I nearly died because \nthere were \n&gt;   bots in the battle that shouldn&#39;t have been there.  I couldn&#39;t \ncare less \n&gt;   about his lackeys.  Now then, let&#39;s get to the meeting so we can \nfinish it \n&gt;   and start planning our attack.&quot;  He stands tall glaring at Sarge.\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
