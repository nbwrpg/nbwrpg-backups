No. No one points fingers at anyone.  This is N=\r\nOT what\n&gt; this meeting is about.  I see I have my work cut out for me..  An=\r\nd under no\n&gt; uncertain circumbstances are any of you allowed to fight again=\r\nst each other.\n&gt;  If I hear anything about any fighting among the three of =\r\nyou, there will be\n&gt; greater consequences to follow.  Now, as of today, you=\r\n are a team, and you\n&gt; will work as a team.  Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap =\r\nand Straight Shot slouch in their chairs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot; Good.  Wheelie, you understand what I&#39;m telling everyone right?  I&#39;m n=\r\not\n&gt; singling anyone out, I&#39;m treating you all as equals.  I know you can a=\r\nll get\n&gt; past this, it will take time but you can do it.  Now, Leo Prime, p=\r\nerhaps you\n&gt; have an area you wish to assign them to?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot an=\r\nd Rattrap look at each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Trapped like rats.

This thought was manif=\r\nested in his next words, &quot;All of you have skills that lend themselves to a =\r\nsmall scouting party, but you would need to depend on each other to accompl=\r\nish it.&quot;\n\nLEO leaned in towards them, &quot;Can you do it?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
