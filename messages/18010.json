One dang carride from school, and 3 F&#39;ing acidents to hold me up! \nGuess Friday the 13th is unlucky after all.\n\nI don&#39;t like these moding accusations that are going on. Surge can eat rubber \nif he wants to (some bots can resist pain, as can some humans), and I don&#39;t \nsee how HotRod moded. So both of you stop accusing each other. This is an IC \nfight, not an OOC one. I will back neither up, in fact I will tell both of \nyou to shut up. THe next one to accuse the other one of moding (whether over \nthe RPG or complaining to me personally) gets moderated for the battle. I am \nnot in a good mood, so don&#39;t try me.\n\nAnd quit threatening each other too.\n\n::Zardus/Bloodystrike/The Oblitercons/Havoc::\n\nFlying in closer to Deemos, Zardus continues firing his plasma launcher, \nfiring at the bot&#39;s chest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing the battle between Surge and HotRod, Bloodystrike flies toward Surge, \nonce again taking out his rifle.\n\nHe takes carefull aim, firing two missiles at Surge&#39;s back.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPyro laughs as bullets hit his armor, making a few dents and scratches, but \nnothing major. He drives at Gigas, firing at him as he shoots fireballs at \nthe bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSpinning in midair, Dark One manages to avoid most of the shots, a few \nhitting him as he continues flying toward Horn Drill and firing at him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavanger shakes as shots hit him, the Oblitertron transforming into robot \nmode and dodging some more bullets, returning fire with his rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBreakdown continues to ride at Grenade, ignoring the shots hitting him as he \nfires two more missiles, again at Grenade.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss dives behind a tree, shots sailing over his head. The tree falls, nearly \nhitting Hiss as the Oblitercon returns fire, shooting at Shockaract.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Soon yes,&quot; Havoc replies to Demolition, diving out of the way of some shots. \nHe pulls up, nearly hitting the ground as he sails over Shockaract&#39;s head, \ngropping a bomb on the bot, &quot;But not yet. We&#39;ll do some damage first.&quot;\n\n"}}
