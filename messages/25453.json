At the base he lands and returns to his bot mode.  There he\nsees\n&gt; Nightlight and Perplex fighting with two unknown bots and a third unknown\nbot\n&gt; helping them, sort of.  He looks between them and decides that Perplex is\n&gt; fine.  He turns and leaps at Clash drawing his staff and slashing at his\n&gt; back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
