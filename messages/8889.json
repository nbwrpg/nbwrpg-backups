They were going to attack!\nWith a sigh she looked back at Prowl, she was getting SO sick of one attack after another. It was wearing her paitense thin!\nShe then heard him tell her that he was going to carry her, shaking her head as the very words were coming out of his mouth.*\n\n&quot; Really, Prowl. I&#39;m fine. Besides, I really need to stay on the ground. My stomach really has...&quot;\n\n* But then her sentance was cut off as she suddenly heard Prowl shout and then lift her into the air! She cryed out in surprise and wrapped her arms around his neck, nearly shaking with sudden surprise as she was lifted into the air.\nHer stomach turned and she fought to keep her last meal down.*\n\n&quot; As I said...my stomach really...hasn&#39;t been doing that good...lately.&quot;\n\n* But as soon as she forced her food back down he throat she tunred and looked down, a few Alliance bots hot on their tails. But then she looked beyond them and towards Tavatron and Dinobot.\nHer spark jumping with dread.\nEven though they were outnumbered she knew that Dinobot wouldn&#39;t run, and that Tavtron would probably stick by him if he chose to stand his ground. And the last thing that she wanted was two Maximal corpses thanks to bullheadedness and clouded judgement.\nShe opened her com-link to Tavatron, thinking of how much Dinobot would be too destracted to hear her.*\n\n&quot; Tavatron! You and Dinobot get out of there! Retreat back to base. Understand?&quot;\n\n* She waited for her response, nervously looking down as Prowl took her higher.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
