He spun so\n&gt; Demise&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; back would face the incoming twenty-five laser bolts.

Two black orbs formed in his hands, each with the power of\n&gt; a charge. \n&gt; &gt;  He threw one orb of energy at the CF, the other at Iron Raptor,\n&gt; this orb \n&gt; &gt; having a seeking ability.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dark One was done with Hiss, who wasn&#39;t out of stasis lock, but\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t die \n&gt; &gt; when this battle ended.  If undisturbed.  The Oblitercon commander\n&gt; looked to \n&gt; &gt; Breakdown.  He ran over to him.  &quot;You alright?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Breakdown lifted his head up rather painfully, and nodded to his\n&gt; commander&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; question.  &quot;Kind of.&quot; wtih that, he went into stasis lock, and Dark\n&gt; One began \n&gt; &gt; repairs on him.  But to bring him into fighting condition.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pyro laid on the ground, imagining a beautiful burning forest to\n&gt; take his \n&gt; &gt; mind off the incredible pains in his body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hiss, though in a stable condition, remained out of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scavenger same as above.  (told you I was tapped for time...)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hot Spot yelled out as a sword dug into his side, and collapsed,\n&gt; cursing \n&gt; &gt; Headstrong before he slammed to his chest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Groove was struck with a blast from Abominous, sending him flipping\n&gt; back and \n&gt; &gt; crashing down, a large gaping hole in his side.  He decided not to\n&gt; commit \n&gt; &gt; suicide and didn&#39;t fire on the gestalt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blades tried to avoid a blast from Abominous, but was struck and sent \n&gt; &gt; flinging downwards.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First Aid still only gave Firedrill a look of confusion.  &quot;Do I know\n&gt; you?&quot; he \n&gt; &gt; asked, repeating his question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Streetwise painfully began to get up, and noticed Decepticons were\n&gt; fleeing.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We--OW!&quot; he yelled, damaged circuitry flaring with pain, the Maximal \n&gt; &gt; collapsing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Imprisoner felt EndBringer wrap his tentacles around the cannon that\n&gt; had only \n&gt; &gt; moments ago fired upon him with rapid laser bolts.  Electricity\nsurged \n&gt; &gt; through Imprisoner from EndBringer.  A yell of pain came from\n&gt; Imprisoner&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; form, but nothing was badly damaged because of the rubber treads\nof the \n&gt; &gt; attack vehicle mode that acted like conductors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One cannon swiveled to point at EndBringer, firing two\nenergy-signature \n&gt; &gt; seeking missiles at the Predacon.  It would no doubt damage\n&gt; Imprisoner as \n&gt; &gt; well, but he noticed the Decepticons were treating and he didn&#39;t\n&gt; want to be \n&gt; &gt; fighting all these baddies by himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Predator jumped hard left, transforming into his tiger mode and\n&gt; avoiding all \n&gt; &gt; three missiles, though shrapnel dug into his tail.  Quickly\n&gt; transforming back \n&gt; &gt; to biped mode, missile launcher in hand, he fired off two rockets.\n One \n&gt; &gt; headed for Firearm, the other headed for the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Choran felt three laser bolts strike him and he took a step back,\n&gt; three dents \n&gt; &gt; in his chest.  &quot;Piece o&#39; slag...&quot; he raised his rifle, firing\n&gt; twenty-five \n&gt; &gt; laser bolts in an arc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ten rapid shots headed for Fliq, six for Atilla, and nine for\nGrimmler.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shockwave transformed to biped mode, weapons fire passing by him\n&gt; harmlessly \n&gt; &gt; because of the decrease of size.  He transformed to his weapon mode,\n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; was roughly the same size as him in biped mode.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He fired a long X-ray blast at Incarcinator that would strike in a\n20ft \n&gt; &gt; radius with Incarcinator in the center.  (Damages internally)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unitron&#39;s sensors detected two incoming missiles being destroyed,\n&gt; thanks to a \n&gt; &gt; small thing Unitron had no idea about (Beeline).  He fired off a\n&gt; seeking \n&gt; &gt; missile at an incoming missile, causing it to blow up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He fired on energy-signature seeking missile at Zardus.  Numerous\nrapid \n&gt; &gt; firing weapons struck Unitron and he transformed to his biped mode.\n&gt;  In space \n&gt; &gt; fighter mode he wouldn&#39;t have survived.  He let out a slight yell\n&gt; and looked \n&gt; &gt; to the retreating Decepticons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Cowards...&quot; he muttered, ignoring the fact that most of the\n&gt; attackers on the \n&gt; &gt; CF were slowly beginning to retreat, himself included.  He fired off\n&gt; ten \n&gt; &gt; rapid optic blasts at Hot Rod&#39;s left knee joint.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Firestarter let out a yell and launched two flares which exploded\n&gt; and blocked \n&gt; &gt; all weapons fire heading for him.  He armed two missiles, launching\n&gt; them at \n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Burn in hell, Maximal scum.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scattershot flew higher and higher, holding a large bomb.  He\n&gt; planned on \n&gt; &gt; &quot;accidentally&quot; dropping it on the Maximals.  He burst into evil\n&gt; laughter at \n&gt; &gt; the thought, dropping it down towards an NDE member and a fighting\n&gt; Alliance \n&gt; &gt; member.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Works either wa--OH MY GENTILE JESUS!&quot; he screamed, his optics\n&gt; enhancing and \n&gt; &gt; he now learned he had dropped the bomb down towards Nemesis Enforcer\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; Serpentor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Good job, Zardus!&quot; he yelled, looking around nervously.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Double Punch was struck with all three charges, his exo-skeleton\nalmost \n&gt; &gt; giving away.  Crashing to the ground he let out a small whine. \n&gt; Getting up \n&gt; &gt; slowly, his modifications were complete.  He painfully raised his\ntail, \n&gt; &gt; seeing the outline of Scyther.  He fired a smal spray of acid at the\n&gt; outline.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Injector took an aim with both launchers at the unsuspecting Dark\n&gt; One and \n&gt; &gt; downed Breakdown, but a dozen shots struck him and knocked him back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Pieces of slag!&quot; he yelled at the site of his cracked exo-skeleton.\n&gt;  He \n&gt; &gt; raised his left arm, firing off two stinger missiles SharpClaws and\n&gt; two from \n&gt; &gt; the other at Underground.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Manterror hit the ground after shots impacted with him.  He let out\n&gt; a yell of \n&gt; &gt; rage as he jumped to his feet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vehement looked to one missile, firing off two optic blasts at it,\n&gt; and turned \n&gt; &gt; to the other, firing off two rapid optic blasts at it, seeing from\n&gt; the corner \n&gt; &gt; of his optics their explosions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raised his left arm, firing two missiles at Hot Rod, and from the\n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; firing two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire.  Twenty five shots\nstruck \n&gt; &gt; Vehement dead on and sent him flying out of control downward.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reflector raised both arms, firing two missiles each that prematurely \n&gt; &gt; exploded and took out all shots heading for him.  He couldn&#39;t see\n&gt; through the \n&gt; &gt; flames of his resulting defense, and so waited until he could see a\n&gt; target to \n&gt; &gt; attack.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Serpentor had gotten the upperhand and continued to pummel Nemesis&#39;\n&gt; face \n&gt; &gt; until he heard a faint whistling sound.  Looking up he saw an object\n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; the size of three charges.  &quot;Right...&quot; he said, jumping back and\n&gt; transforming \n&gt; &gt; to his snake mode and slithering away, noticing the slow retreat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bomb struck a few feet away from Nemesis Enforcer, sending him\n&gt; flying \n&gt; &gt; through the air without the use of his engines or wings, his body\n&gt; burned and \n&gt; &gt; scarred, the robot himself screaming.\n\n\n"}}
