I have some piloting experience.  My greatest asset \nis my mind.  I can solve problems before most know that they&#39;re there.  But \nI&#39;m not a mechanic.  I can fight well and the last two bots to harass me \nended up dead.  I don&#39;t like to fight but I fight to win.  I&#39;m very good at \ngetting bots to tell me things and concealing things from bots.  I&#39;m not a \nPredacon.  I have no faction as of yet, but I will fight for the Predacons \nfor the sake of doing something.\n\n"}}
