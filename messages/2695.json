We cannot \nallign ourselfs with a Predacon fraction that wants to see all of us dead.\n\n::: Megatron frowned. Mabey Hell Beast and Zardus didnt want to join the \nNewcomers, but Megatron did. They had a plan, a motive, and minions to get \nthe job done. He only wished he had the kind of resources Set and Shuko had, \nthen mabey he could have gotten rid of the Autobots originally. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Well, I belive that my fraction would be-\n\n::: Marine ::: Your fraction consits of two other bots! Shredder and \nQuickstrike! I dont think we&#39;ll need you three at all, traitors.\n\n::: Megatron ::: I will not stand for this, I can here to help you...and it \nseems im getting the short end of the stick!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Enough! Megatron, ethier you join us, or surrender your \ncommand and minions over to us. We will not let you walk out of here a \npossible threat.\n\n::: Megatron sticks out his hand ::: I will join, yes.\n\n::: He knew this was only temporary. He would have to contact Shuko or Set. \nHe would see the downfall of the Predacons and Allience, from the inside. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Jackle and Pheniox combine fire towrds Mantella, hoping to stop \nQuickstrike. :::\n\n"}}
