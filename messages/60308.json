He had to use more\n&gt; conventional tools because the advanced reassembly chamber was \nstill\n&gt; trashed.  Next he restrained her arms and legs with to the table \nwith\n&gt; steel cuffs.  Then he set up the energy field.  It was a lesser\n&gt; version of the base energy shield.  He was a bit worried here, \nbecause\n&gt; he wasn&#39;t sure if a vork could pass through it or not, though it\n&gt; blocked other forms of energy such as laser beams and directed \nenergy\n&gt; weapons so theoretically it could prevent an energy being such as a\n&gt; vork from passing through.  He injected her with an antidote to the\n&gt; tranquilizer and rapidly switched on the energy field.  A blue glow\n&gt; formed around the table. \n&gt; \n&gt; He waited silently for her to wake.\n\n\n"}}
