His \nmotricity was still awful, but the call of the battle and the mockery \nof those Tripredacus were too strong. He managed to stand up, but \nputting one leg in front of the other was impossible.\n\nWarhead: If I can not stand, I will transform!\n\nHe went into his hovercraft mode, which was much more mobile. He made \nit out of the base and, seeing Spike, fired at him with machine guns.\n\nTyrael saw Spike too and greeted him.\n\nTyrael: Whoever you are, you are welcome with us Tripredacus. Now \nfight with us!\n\nAs he said these words, he received fully Quickstrike&#39;s energy blast. \nHe countered, after getting up, with two light blasts of his own.\n\nTyrael: Very well, Megatron. We shall have it your way. Know this, \nthough: the Dragon is a tough kill, but the Phoenix rises after dying! \nNow get out and fight me! Tripredacus! Attack now!\n\nBurrock, on his side, avoided the rocket shot by Inferno, but not by \nmuch. He got fried a bit from the blast, but was otherwise alright.\n\nBurrock: This sure beats those other absent clowns! NOW WHO&#39;S THE \nSMART METAL ASS WHO FIRED ON ME? YOU THE ONE?\n\nHe turned to Inferno and tried to grab him with his tendrils and crush \nhim.\n\n\n"}}
