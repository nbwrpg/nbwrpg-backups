Sanctuary.  That means you can live =\r\nyour lives freely without hinderence from the Autobots and if anyone tries =\r\nto violate your sanctuary, I promise to upold my end of the bargain and I w=\r\nill see to it, that you are left undisturbed.  As a matter of fact, we coul=\r\nd keep this part of the tunnels guarded at all times, and yes, if possible,=\r\n find a way to offer you energon as an alternate energy source.  That way, =\r\nyou wouldn&#39;t have to feed off of any of us.  Everyone wins in this scenario=\r\n.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, can&#39;t get any better than that, and that&#39;s w=\r\nay better than just getting a mass of shinny trinkets.&quot;\n\nTucson backs a way=\r\n slowly, to honorably uphold his end if the bargain.\n\n&quot;In return all we ask=\r\n is to have Rodimus returned to us.  Do this, and I can assure your sanctua=\r\nry.&quot;\n\nHe waits to hear the queen&#39;s answer.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nPreston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The &#39;Queen&#39; buzzed around in=\r\n the air for a long moment, the sound of\n&gt; her wings was loud in the chambe=\r\nr as she flew.
