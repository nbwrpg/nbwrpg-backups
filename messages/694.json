Looking back at the island (OOC: I&#39;ll just pretend I say it in the first place) and sighs. She knew Carnage wanted to get over there, but how?\n\nWhat if she herself carried her? Maybe in robot mode she might be strong enough? She hadn&#39;t had time to test her Robot Mode full abilities. She shook her head, she doubted she could do it. But maybe, just maybe, if she tried, she may be able to.\n\n&quot;Carnage do you think I would be able to carry you over there? It doesn&#39;t look.. that far away..&quot;\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
