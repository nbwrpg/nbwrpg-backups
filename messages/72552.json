I always liked the id=\r\nea of Dinobot being ihs &#39;student&#39; and everything, as they had quite similar=\r\n fighting styles.  And it&#39;s on Cybertron in a future timeline, the exact ci=\r\nrcumstances don&#39;t quite matter more than the knowledge, and Dinobot would e=\r\nxaggerate it ICly anyways for maximum pain.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, then roll on with it=\r\n! We can assume that Nightshift, Tuscon and\n&gt; Straightshot were away from C=\r\nybertron, perhaps even on their way to\n&gt; Earth when those events transpired=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds good to me.\n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; On 10/28/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magic=\r\nquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I like the idea that Tucson, Nightshift and Straight=\r\n Shot are not aware of\n&gt; &gt; Yoketron&#39;s death, that would make it interesting=\r\n. I think I&#39;d like to roll\n&gt; &gt; with that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perpetually on the move a=\r\nnd constantly busy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Oct 28, 2011, at 12:19 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;s=\r\nupercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically I am using a lot of the ani=\r\nmated events in the background\n&gt; &gt;&gt; events of Cybertron. Basically the worl=\r\nd went from G1/G2 to Animated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Beast Wars back on old Earth - Beast =\r\nMachines never happened.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So for Yokatron: (Yes I am stealing the =\r\nname Prowl-Z from Adam for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; name of the animated version of Prowl, =\r\nI hope he doesn&#39;t mind)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ***************\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yoketron is a wise o=\r\nld Autobot responsible for training the Autobot\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cyber-Ninja Corps at t=\r\nhe Cyber-Ninja Dojo, but more importantly, he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; protects the Autobots&#39; c=\r\nache of protoforms, which will have to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; activated if Project Omega f=\r\nails. He is a master of many martial arts,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; including Circuit-Su, Metal=\r\nlikato, Crystalocution, diffusion,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tekkaido, Tahtib-tron and Laser Lat=\r\nhi.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One of Yoketron&#39;s former students, Lockdown, betrayed him, st=\r\nealing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; most of the protoforms for the Decepticons, and leaving Yoketro=\r\nn to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; die. Prowl-Z returned during the aftermath, and he attempted to r=\r\nevive\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yoketron by transferring his spark to a protoform that had been =\r\nleft\n&gt; &gt;&gt; behind. Though Yoketron formed from the new Protoform, Yoketron\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; chastised Prowl-Z for not accepting fate, telling him he &quot;...must not\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; sacrifice a piece of the future to bring back the past.&quot; As he told\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Prowl-Z that he would understand when his time came, Yoketron\n&gt; &gt;&gt; relinq=\r\nuished his spark, and his new body grayed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; **************\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So=\r\n yes Yoketron is dead, killed by Lockdown, however that leaves\n&gt; &gt;&gt; several=\r\n things open - In who&#39;s employ was Lockdown, it could easily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have been=\r\n BLUDGEON. The manner of Yoketron&#39;s death has been kept from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the publi=\r\nc at large. In fact I would imagine that the story is that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; since he wa=\r\ns considered old, that he sucummed to the ravages of time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE=\r\n BELIEVE THIS STORY.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am unsure at what point Tuscon and Nightsh=\r\nift left the Dojo and came\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Earth, so he may not be aware that Yoket=\r\nron is dead, or if he is,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he may not know how. I will leave that up to=\r\n Sandy how much Tuscon and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightshift know and how much they may have =\r\ntold Straight Shot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However the revelation that Bludgeon could ha=\r\nve been behind it, or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; even part of of it at all would be new knowledge=\r\n. Most will not have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any knowledge unless they have some special conne=\r\nction to someone who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was in on matters, or was in it themselves.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I invite questions and/or comments.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
