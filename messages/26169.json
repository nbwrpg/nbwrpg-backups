He didn&#39;t \nwant to do what he had to do.  He activated the eject sequence, his cockpit \nshooting open and the pilot&#39;s seat following it, Chordate flying from his \nseat, not being strapped in, and hit the ground several feet from the seat.\n\nThe Oblitercon leader kept his weapons powered, awaiting FZ&#39;s orders to leave \nthe Cybertronian Fire and head back home.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown kept his weapon trained, stretching his legs, getting for the long \njourney home.\n\n---\n\nPyro transformed to his rather mutilated looking tank mode (thanks to \nmissiles) and powered up its engine, getting ready to go top speed in his \nbroken and battered condition.\n\n---\n\nHiss climbed up on top of Pyro, opening the hatch and jumping inside, \nshutting and locking the hatch after he got in.\n\n---\n\nScavenger stayed in his HUMVEE mode, revving up the engine.\n\n===\n\nHot Spot ignored the Alliance members and other Maximals, focusing in on his \nwounded.  He picked up Blades carefully, walking towards the CF.  &quot;Get First \nAid, VERY carefully.&quot; he ordered.\n\n---\n\nGroove grabbed First Aid by the feet while Streetwise got his arms and they \nslowly made their way towards the destroyed main entrance of the Cybertronian \nFire.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf transformed into his mutant wolf mode, clawing at the ground with \na snarl.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper stayed in his beast mode, the hyena making a laughing noise at \nChordate being slammed to the ground.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw remained silent in his attack vehicle mode, no noise coming from \nhim save his powerful engines.\n\n---\n\nSixshot leapt into the air, hovering several feet from the ground, keeping \nhis blasters at the ready.  He&#39;d rain hell down upon the Maximals if \nsomething happened.\n\n---\n\nAres kept his rifle at the ready, slowly walking closer to FZ.\n\n---\n\nUnitron stepped outside of the Cybertronian Fire looking around.  An \nimportant phase was complete.  He turned to Firestarter swiftly.  &quot;Locate \nShockwave and go to him and help him with whatever is needed.  I will handle \nthings with the Alliance.&quot;\n\n&quot;Understood.&quot; the pyromaniac said, transforming into his space fighter mode \nand launching off into the air towards the general direction of the antarctic.\n\nImprisoner looked to Predator and Choran, motioning for them to stay still.\n\n&quot;What of us?&quot;\n\n&quot;You will serve me.  I freed you, and I can kill you just as easily.&quot; Unitron \nsaid, walking towards FZ, the three ex-bounty hunters in tow, not really \ncaring.  Their ship could be signaled to come and retrieve them if needed.\n\n"}}
