Why?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SANTON scratched his head for a moment as he thought,=\r\n &quot;It looks like\n&gt; it is the same thing that happened to human strains of fl=\r\nu and other\n&gt; viruses. As they interact with the enviornment around them th=\r\ney change\n&gt; and modify.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a pause from BUMP, &quot;Does that mean =\r\nthat this strain is more\n&gt; resistant to the cure?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; SAN=\r\nTON said. He glanced up at LEGACY who had just\n&gt; finished entering his code=\r\ns. &quot;What do you think?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY stepped away from his panel as the prog=\r\nram executed. &quot;Unknown,\n&gt; this strain appears to be essentially the same.&quot; =\r\nHe said quietly. &quot;I\n&gt; have replicated the antiviral injection just as presc=\r\nribed and have\n&gt; added other additional medicines.&quot; He said coldly. &quot;I woul=\r\nd surmise\n&gt; that it would be at least partially effective. However to what =\r\ndegree\n&gt; is difficult to quantify.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a nod from BUMP, &quot;So it =\r\nmay cure them . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;. . . or it may do nothing at all.&quot; SANTON said=\r\n as he realized the\n&gt; import of their words.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a hissing sound=\r\n as injection guns rose from the beds of\n&gt; TUSCON and UPROAR. Efficiently t=\r\nhey fed both of them the &#39;cure&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY, BUMP and SANTON looked at the=\r\n vital signs readout and waited\n&gt; to see what the response would be.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
