He knew that going too fast could upset the structure even=\r\n weaken it to the point of breaking, which he did not want to do.  He conti=\r\nnues steadilly, sensing that Vestige was growing weak once more.  Gently, h=\r\ne begins to take control of his own wheel, and goes in the direction of whe=\r\nre he&#39;s being led.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s all right old friend, you have given me the cours=\r\ne, I can take it from here.  Rest now.  I promise we will reach the chamber=\r\n in time for you to be repaired.&quot;\n\nWith each word Tucson speaks, his voice =\r\nchanges ever so slightly, sounding more and more like Optimus Prime. Still =\r\nhe himself has no idea that he was ever related to the great Autobot leader=\r\n.  All he knew is that he admired him greatly not only as his commander, bu=\r\nt as a mentor during his younger years as a rookie Autobot.  Tucson could n=\r\now sense some changes within himself, not only on the outside, but on the i=\r\nnside as well.  He could have turned to fight whatever onslaught was follow=\r\ning him, yet he chose not to, and chose to save a life over taking one.  It=\r\n was a choice he felt very good about and had no regrets to his decision.  =\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson did not wish to wear Vestige out. Now that he w=\r\nas safely on his feet, he could transform into his vehicle mode and does so=\r\n readilly, gently opening his driver&#39;s side door for Vestige, and lowering =\r\nhis left wheels down to where the old Autobot could get into him easier.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; If you ask me, I think we&#39;ll get there a lot sooner of I take to th=\r\ne wheels instead of my feet. You can drive me to where we need to go, I don=\r\n&#39;t mind. And sometimes, trust just comes from the heart. And a heart that t=\r\nrusts, is a heart that&#39;s compassionate, and a heart that feels compassion i=\r\ns one that has true power. Nothing can overpower that, nothing. That&#39;s what=\r\n I keep telling everyone back at Autobot Headquarters. It doesn&#39;t matter if=\r\n you have powerful weapons, if you don&#39;t have what truely matters, then you=\r\n have hardly anything at all. You have more than that to go around old frie=\r\nnd, I can feel it. Now, let&#39;s get you to your repair chamber. Oh, if you fe=\r\nel weak, just let me know and I&#39;ll take over.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He waits for Vestige=\r\n to get in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige spryly lept into the seat inside Tuscon=\r\n&#39;s cab. He closed the\n&gt; door and took a moment to look around, glancing at =\r\nthe different\n&gt; controls that Tuscon had. &quot;You look like something I have s=\r\neen before,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t place where.&quot; Vestige look confused for a moment,=\r\n as his\n&gt; voice trailed off thoughtfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; After a moment he shook it o=\r\nff. &quot;We have to go that way.&quot; he said\n&gt; pointing down the hall. The hall ha=\r\nd gotten a little darker, as if the\n&gt; lights had been turned down a notch o=\r\nr two, but the way ahead was\n&gt; still clearly visable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vestige lay a ha=\r\nnd on Tuscon&#39;s steering wheel as he placed a foot on\n&gt; his accelerator, &quot;I =\r\ndon&#39;t know how much more time we have . . . I . .\n&gt; I . . have, so we have =\r\nto go.&quot; Vestige&#39;s voice was already getting a\n&gt; little shaky, but he swallo=\r\nwed it as he tried to engage Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; engines to start them moving.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOutside the vehicle the lights continued to slowly dim and the\n&gt; scraping n=\r\noises were getting louder and more insistant. It began to\n&gt; sound like meta=\r\nl blades sliding along steel shelled amor and in the\n&gt; background, almost i=\r\nmperceptable at first a slight hum could be just\n&gt; bearly heard - where it =\r\nwas coming from was difficult to tell.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
