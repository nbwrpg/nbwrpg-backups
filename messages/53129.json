Cardhead, WingedWarrior fill me in on what&#39;s\n&gt; happened to my chars.  Also I have a question that may\n&gt; take some debating.  I was thinking of introducing a\n&gt; new race of transformers not from Cybertron (no not\n&gt; the Junkions and I&#39;m not stupid enough to try to bring\n&gt; in the Minicons), but the char I&#39;m thinking of\n&gt; creating arguably breaks the no invincibility rule. \n&gt; See he&#39;s the textbook case prince hiding from his evil\n&gt; uncle who wants to take over his planet, but he has\n&gt; this mark on his right hand that proves he&#39;s heir to\n&gt; the throne.  The thing is when he&#39;s pushed to far the\n&gt; symbol glows, andhe becomes invincible with limitless\n&gt; firepower, speed, and strength, but it only lasts for\n&gt; about twenty seconds then he turns back into himself,\n&gt; except then he&#39;s barely concious from the strain. \n&gt; Still in that time he could take out three or four\n&gt; bots or render a bases shields useless.  So is this\n&gt; o.k. (please note this would be a rare occurance, not\n&gt; something that would appear in every battle).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Happy birthday Kyle!
