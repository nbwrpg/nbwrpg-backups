The war suit \ndesigned for him from K-9&#39;s body parts by Blaze was holding up nicely, \nbut he was still shedding some mechfluid where the suit had been \npunctured. He activates the infared goggles, looking around and seeing \nwhere the enemies were firing at him from better than before. What he \nneeded was a drill to get to Prebon, or....\n\nSlayer lowers in altitude, able to see his enemies and avoid most of \nthe attacks. The shots that did hit him didn&#39;t do too much damage, but \nhe tried to avoid them all anyways. Thanks to his scanners and infared \nvision, he could see the entrance to the tunnel that Prebon was in.\n\nSlayer aims a missile from each of his two shoulder-mounted missile \nlauncher at the two bots firing at him, letting loose two \nsignature-seeking missiles at each. He gets a lock on the entrance to \nthe tunnel, preparing two more missiles.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius stood outside the trainers base waiting for a sign from \nSlayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; . &quot;Hey, I wouldn&#39;t mind some backup over here,&quot;  comes over the comm \nfrom\n&gt; Slayer.
