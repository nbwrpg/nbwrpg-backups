I mimic the wrestler&#39;s really high kicks (or superkicks) on TV\nin every federation, and I have at least 10 of them or so. Can unleash them\nat any time, but I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to actually hit anyone with\nthem, but I feel the need to sometimes, when I get riled up. I doubt I&#39;d\nbreak anyone&#39;s arm, though, as I&#39;m purposely doing the safe version of the\nkicks like wrestlers do. Maybe you should have did that, Prodigy, then you\nwouldn&#39;t have broken his arm...unless you WANTED to break it, then I\nunderstand perfectly.   ; &gt;\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 14, 2001 11:10 PM\nSubject: Re: Retreat\n\n\n&gt; True, but unless your opponent is very inept at blocking, that kick\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t break their arm. However, I once did a spinning hook kick on\n&gt; a bag that someone was holding, and their arm nearly did break, so I\n&gt; guess there are exceptions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
