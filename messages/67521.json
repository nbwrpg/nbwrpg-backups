Deepstryke, Phobia, Nightrazor, Decibel\nand Tumult have all been posted on the wiki website for your viewing\npleasure. I am declaring them NPC&#39;s and can be used by anyone that\nwants to play a Minion, but would prefer not to make one up. I would\nsuggest of course posting your intent to use one if you so desire so no\none bumps into anyone else. The only two provisions I have are: (1)\nPlease don&#39;t don&#39;t try to deliberately kill him or her and (2) Please\ndon&#39;t change his/her faction or alligience from Cyclonus.\n\nQuestions and comments are always welcome!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
