He was horrified, and was screaming for help.\n&gt; Then,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he went forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came down!  They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started cutting at Decapitron.  All he could do was scream in\n&gt; sheer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pain.  Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol engraved on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading\n&gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; large box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol\n&gt; &gt; &gt; came down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went into the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and\n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and he\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting beaten and battered.  After the 10 minute torture process\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; done in the box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and\n&gt; stuff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were pouring like mad, and he was mangled and dislocated and\n&gt; stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, he was at the end, and was dumped off of the conveyer\n&gt; belt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and onto the ground.  The last thing he had seen back then when\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinisterly with evil\n&gt; eyes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and faces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Flashback Ends*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surgital was still...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
