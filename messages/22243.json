You see, in the event of \nyour unfortunate death, we can bring you back so to speak. It&#39;s \nwonder how we have the technology now a days. You see, if we can \nsalvage your original spark chamber, we can bring you back. In a way. \nIt&#39;s so that even in a horrible battle, we shall not lose our troops. \nSay one of your team is killed. We can bring him back through a \nprossess called cloning. But we must extact living DNA and keep it \nuntill that time. Without the spark chamber we can&#39;t do it either. So \nyour troops would have to die first, then we can bring them back.  \nIt&#39;s not hard and I can show you the prossess if you wish.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
