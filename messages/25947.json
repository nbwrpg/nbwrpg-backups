Leaving the \nrest of the shields up?&quot;\n\n* She spoke this and then waited, glancing at Cheetor again but was eased \nwhen he decided just to lay back and stay in line with everyone else.\nBut then Iron Raptor looked towards another voice, seeing that it was \nRhinox. It was strange sometimes how people asked for orders or commands, \nlike they want to be sent out to go and do something. Must be bord then.\nShe shook her head.*\n\n&quot; There are none to give out other then maintaining the cease fire and \nwatching the Alliance.&quot;\n\n* There was no telling just what the Alliance could do now and if they would \nleave once the captives had been released. But she hoped that they were just \nas tired of this battle as she was and ready to go back to their own base \nthat needed it&#39;s own protecting.\nBut then Iron Raptor suddenly remembered something, feeling rather guilty \nfor forgetting.\nThere was still the small kitten in her back compartment!\nShe reached back to get hold of him, trying to get a punch of neck fur \nbetween her fingers to pull him out. But it wasn&#39;t long before there was \nsome other sound which attracted her attention while she was trying to get \nthe cat. It was a musical voice, and it was greeted by her with a slightly \nannoyed sigh.\nIt was one thing after another.\n&lt; Could you reply to that, Prowl?&gt;*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
