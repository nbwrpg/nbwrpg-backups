The problem is that I don&#39;t know how to CONTROL it.  I&#39;ve got \nspecial energy regulators implanted that keep it in check, but that&#39;s \nit.  I&#39;m not sure where I got them - definitely not from the \nSisters!&quot;  She laughs, then gets serious again.  &quot;Do you think \nMegatron will be nicer than the Rogues?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker:  You were a member of a group of femmes called the \nSisters.  \n&gt; They believed in non-violence, and purity.  What they didn&#39;t know \nwas \n&gt; you have a mutant spark.  If you ever used it in battle you&#39;d be \nall \n&gt; but unstopable.  Both myself and the Rouges detected your spark and \n&gt; came after it hoping to gain a new ally.  But when I got there I \nwas \n&gt; damaged in a storm.  The sisters took me in and treated me.  Even \n&gt; though I found out which one of you it was you wouldn&#39;t come with \n&gt; me.  I could have just forced you, but I was weeeelllll begining to \n&gt; like you a great deal, and despite the Sister teachings against it \nI \n&gt; believe you may have mirriored this.  When the Rouges arrived you \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t defend yourselves, but I would.  I took out a few of them, \n&gt; but they finally got me.  They would have slagged me, but you \n&gt; surrendered youself at the last minute so they&#39;d leave me, and the \n&gt; Sisters alone.  That was the last I ever heard of you until I \n&gt; detected your spark recently and tracked you down.  I actually came \n&gt; here to help a Predicon I admire named Megatron.  And I hope I can \n&gt; convince him to help you.  Perhaps I should introduce myself.  My \n&gt; name, is Flicker.  Now come on, we need to get back to my shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; He knows he shouldn&#39;t be out in robot mode on this planet for long, \n&gt; but he starts walking towards the base just to savor the walk with \n&gt; her, and to allow more time for questions.\n\n\n"}}
