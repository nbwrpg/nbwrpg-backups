Paralysis was in command of the mission until \nthe arrival of Aracnia. He looked at his team. Aerostreak, Autofire, and \nAdrax would attack from above, Guantix, Grappler, and Himself would make a \nground assult. \n    &quot;Alright, you have your orders! Take down the Ark! And kill all \nMaximals!&quot; Paralysis shouted as Adrax, Autofire, and Aerostreak took to the \nskys, fireing rockets, lasers, pulse shots, and lasers at the Ark. Paralysis, \nGrappler, and Guantix ran into the battlefeild, targeting Maximals and taking \nthem down. Providing cover for there ally&#39;s.\n\n"}}
