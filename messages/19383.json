She was such a busy leader, \nwith so many obligations. A moment alone with her was hard to find. Looking \naround she thought about Megatron, the council, and Predacon rule. If they \ndid succeed....what was stopping them from breaking away completely from \nCybertron? They could make a manufacturing headquarters, where new Predacons \nwould be built and programed. The Predacons could pave over the useless trees \nand plants, and build magnificent cities. Not only Earth, but Mars and the \nMoon could be colonized too. A small Predacon empire could arise in \nprehistoric times, and by the time it reached normal time on Cybertron, they \nwould be so far advanced they could easily destroy what little opposition \nstill thirived there.\n    Aracnia smiled, things really were going to change.\n\n    Megatron looked to Hell Beast as he entered. The others had made it back, \nexcept for Nighteyes who was inside Kitkats ship. &quot;And what happened to you? \nDid you find anything out?&quot;\n    &quot;No, but Kitkat really wants you to join her council.&quot; He said, with a \nbit of malice in his voice.\n    Megatron smiled. Like a roach he would never truly be destroyed, but \nthrive in some kind of adaptment. This was one of those times.\n\n"}}
