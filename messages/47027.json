The problem here is using a name that was in use\nalready. For example what if someone wanted the name &quot;Black Zardus&quot; (ripping\nthe japanese way of making sequel characters)... people would confuse this\nnew character with having some relation to &quot;Future Zardus&quot; and the original\n&quot;Zardus&quot; who were owned by one of the council members.\n\n Hence to stop this confusion it&#39;s easier for a new player to just select a\ndifferent name. The problem arises however that there has been so many bots\non Earth (both currently in use and on the deceased/missing list) that it&#39;s\nnear impossible to generate an original &quot;transformer&quot; name.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 9:12 AM\nSubject: Re: new trouble at the Chivtrons base\n\n\n&gt; My name is Kyle if another guy who happened to be named Kyle showed\n&gt; up would you ban him because the name is taken?\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dewboy, your &quot;oh so large&quot; mouth consider what it says, BEFORE it\n&gt; &gt; say anything.
