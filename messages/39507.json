Maybe\n&gt;even while they were asleep?\n&gt;&lt; Not an easy choice.&gt;\n&gt;Her mind reeled...before: &lt; Just kill him.

So that I can stop you\n&gt;BEFORE such a thing can happen and assure that not only the sparks of the\n&gt;Maximals are safe but perhaps spare yours from exicution from a crime that\n&gt;could be prevented.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The expression on her face softened.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Though, to prevent their suffering at your hands I WILL terminate you if\n&gt;nesecarry.
