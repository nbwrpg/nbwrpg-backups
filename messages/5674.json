About our contract, same amount of \ntime and same pay?&quot; he asked, nodding his head to the four other Oblitercons.\n\nScavenger transformed into his HUMVEE mode, two crates loaded into the back \nof vehicle mode.\n\nPyro transformed to his tank mode, his hatch opening, three crates loaded \ninto that mode.\n\nDark One transformed into his jet fighter mode, a crate being loaded into his \ncockpit.\n\nThe Oblitercons left the base, talking to each other over a secure com.\n\n&lt;The craft we discovered won&#39;t be good enough to hide our energon.  We need \nto hide it where someone will never find it.  Where someone has no business \nbeing&gt;\n\n&lt;Like a desert?&gt; Breakdown suggested.\n\n&lt;Maybe...&gt;\n\n&lt;That huge plot of ice!  Antville?&gt; Pyro said.\n\n&lt;Antarctica!  Yes!  Wait...no...to unstationary.  It could melt.  We don&#39;t \nknow enough about Terran history.  I do remember a place we crashed at...&gt;\n\n&lt;The...Gobi Desert I believe.&gt; Hiss, the historian, said.\n\n&lt;Yes!  We&#39;ll hide it there!  Follow me!&gt; Dark One yelled, turning to the \nnortheast towards the Gobi Desert, his men following him.\n\n======\n\nAnubis and Hades ignored Gigatron, seeing Amobeous.\n\n---\n\nAmobeous ran with his rifle, jumping bakc in surprise as a golden robot, \nAnubis, leapt in front of him.  A golden leg sent Amobeous&#39; rifle out of his \nhands.  Punching, Anubis blocked and countered with a left hook, knocking \nAmobeous out.\n\nHades grabbed the Maximal&#39;s rifle, putting it into his subspace pocket.\n\nAnubis looked to Gigatron.  &quot;Carry him back to base.  He can tell us what is \nup with those blasted Maximals and their slagging space cruisers.&quot;\n\n&lt;It&#39;s Anubis, we have  him Master Shuko&gt;\n\n&lt;Excellent!  Don&#39;t let him get away, at all costs&gt;\n\n========\n\nChordate looked to Kluster.  &quot;Errr...sir, is it wise to let all these people \ncome and stay here?  What about the Ark?  We can&#39;t leave it there for the \nPredacons to get!  Or some other sick minded fool!&quot;\n\n========\n\nSmokescreen helped Ramhorn up, concern in his voice for Ramhorn, who had \nbecome a brother-like figure to him.  &quot;What in the Pit happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;Two Maximals knocked me down and left when they suddenly appeared in front \nof me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ok...do you need a CR chamber?&quot;\n\n&quot;No.  Tell Prowl though.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s not here, I don&#39;t think so anyways.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;A Maximal battlecruiser crashed, and it&#39;s in good condition.  A lot of \nMaximals went out to check on it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Those fools!  We&#39;re going to get smashed into guacamolli!&quot; Ramhorn yelled, \ngetting up and running for the bridge, Smokescreen following from behind.\n\n"}}
