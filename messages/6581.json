She was listening intently on \nPhobia&#39;s words.  She wondered what the catch was.  On the pride \nplains, a free peice of meat was usually a trap.  She wondered if the \ntidbit that Phobia was telling them was the bait and if the trap \nwould soon spring.  Her instincts told her to listen ad wait.  \nSomething about Phobia triggered her interest.  She still wondered \nwhat the catch was for him to come here like this.  Sure she would \nnot do as he was. Or would she if the situation was reversed?\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; (OK, I&#39;ll start with 6520, 21) sorry so long.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My dear lion, I have the information that will end the war, unless \n&gt; we do something to save it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia looks at the 4 Maximals seated, and standing at the \ntable,&quot;As \n&gt; a show of trust I will give you a little information about myself.&quot; \n&gt; The spider paused wondering if he was giving them to much \n&gt; information, then continued &quot;I was stationed on a warship sent to \n&gt; locate a colony on the planet Metallasis, when we arrived we found \nno \n&gt; evidence of a colony existing on the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sly Predicon observed the attentive looks on three of the \n&gt; Maximals faceplates.

I awoke on board \na \n&gt; trader ship. the traders already scavenged the warship and \nvirtually \n&gt; everyone on board.

I &quot;convinced&quot; the traders to let \n&gt; me &quot;borrow&quot;the ship to track the wave to it&#39;s source.
