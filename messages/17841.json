If there isn&#39;t enough space, you \nmay give my room to someone.  Right now, I care not where I sleep. I \nwill be in the lab if anyone needs me.&quot; She turned to \nDrillbit,&quot;Please help him find the space for everyone. I have a lot \nwork ahead of me.&quot;  She opens her hip compartment and pulls out the \nspark.  She walked down the hall looking at the spark. She still \ncouldn&#39;t beleive that is was a clone spark and not a real one. She \nwalked into the lab and sets the spark in a containment jar.  Walks \nto the console across the room and presses a few buttons on the \npanel.  A blue light shines down on the spark and starts to sort out \nthe componants of the spark.  She presses another set of buttons and \na small red beam starts to cut the spark into several pieces.  She \npresses the third set of buttons and small green beam starts to \nanalize the DNA, cellular structure and molecular composition.  She \nlet the computer work and sat in a chair near the console.  She propt \nher arm up and rested her head in her hand.  She was still very mad \nabout the fact that she had killed a clone and not the real Megatron.\n\n\n"}}
