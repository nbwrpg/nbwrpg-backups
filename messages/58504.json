Especially ones that appear when he doesn&#39;t expect them.  So as you can see, he is very difficult to deal with if you do not have an established relationship with him.  The best way to establish a relationship is to trade or negociate with him.\n\n__________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Message: 20\n&gt;   Date: Sun, 19 Oct 2003 05:28:21 -0000\n&gt;   From: &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Celeron-Roundup\n&gt;\n&gt;StarStorm:\n&gt;\n&gt;Starstorm lef her hideout ans said &quot;My bussines was the pod that you \n&gt;got... but it seems that I arrived late... who&#39;re you and what&#39;s \n&gt;your faction?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@l...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; After Celeron was done in the prision block, he went back outside.\n&gt;&gt; He decided to look at the pod now that he wasn&#39;t in danger.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He flew over the night-time desert, scanning all around for \n&gt;anything \n&gt;&gt; else interesting.  He dove down when he saw a metalic object about \n&gt;&gt; half-way between the pod and the ship.  He saw a dark figure....\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello?  What are you doing here?

He and \n&gt;&gt; Celeron met in mid-air about half way between the two places and \n&gt;&gt; they were both almost hit by the firepower of the angry prisoner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Why would you imprison somebody with their weapons still \n&gt;&gt; weapons?&quot; Celeron angrily asked Tigon (the warden).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tigon hadn&#39;t waited to listen to Celeron, he was already locked \n&gt;in \n&gt;&gt; a battle with the prisoner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; The prisoner fired a volley of three shots which hit Tigon in \n&gt;the \n&gt;&gt; chest.  Tigon blasted the prisoner with his main gun, and then \n&gt;&gt; kicked the prisoner out of the air.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron decided to sneak over to the pod and see what he could \n&gt;&gt; learn.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; The prisoner got back up and got up real close to Tigon.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You won&#39;t take me back!  NEVER!&quot; at that, he started firing \n&gt;&gt; violently.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tigon tried to shield his face with his arm; he tripped and fell \n&gt;&gt; over backwards down a hill.  The prisoner saw his chance and \n&gt;jumped \n&gt;&gt; on Tigon.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron decided to intervene (there would always be time to pick \n&gt;&gt; through the pod later) he charged up his arm cannons and sneaked \n&gt;up \n&gt;&gt; behind the raging prisoner.  Tigon was not moving and the prisoner \n&gt;&gt; was trying to break open the armor on his back.  Celeron fired \n&gt;both \n&gt;&gt; of his cannons pointblank into the prisoner.  He was blown back a \n&gt;&gt; few yards and fell into the sand.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron decided that if he didn&#39;t act now, he&#39;d lose too and \n&gt;could \n&gt;&gt; possibly die.  He grabbed a pair of handcuffs from Tigon&#39;s tools, \n&gt;&gt; and he shot at the prisoner to make sure he was down.  When cuffed \n&gt;&gt; the prisoner, the prisoner tried to break free.  Tigon reactivated \n&gt;&gt; just in time to see Celeron attempting to disarm the prisoner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;This prisoner has a protective field that keeps him from being \n&gt;&gt; disarmed.  The only way I could detain him, was to render him \n&gt;&gt; unconscious.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; The prisoner was still struggling, Tigon took a device from his \n&gt;&gt; kit and strapped it to the prisoner&#39;s neck.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Now we can momentarily control him.&quot; Tigon explained.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron kicked the prisoner who was now powerless to resist \n&gt;him.  \n&gt;&gt; Tigon glared at Celeron and Celeron immediately stopped.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; When they got back into the ship The Warden chained the prisoner \n&gt;&gt; to the wall and had Celeron guard him.  Tigon then prepared a \n&gt;&gt; chamber to keep the prisoner in.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey...isn&#39;t there some way to disarm him?&quot; Celeron asked.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I haven&#39;t found a way to.  I&#39;ve been trying for several years.  \n&gt;&gt; He has an energon field that is generated when someone tries to \n&gt;&gt; tamper with his weapons.  I&#39;ve given up trying&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron thought that this was a challenge worth trying.
