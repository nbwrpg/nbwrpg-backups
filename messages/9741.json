Predacon signitures. Origin \nunknown.&quot;\n    Black Aracnia&#39;s jaw dropped. She thought they were dead. And, if they \nwere Predacons now, mabey they could help this fraction out....\n    &quot;Computer, locate them now.&quot;\n    &quot;Whereabouts of Adrax and Autofire are unknow. Scanners last report them \nin sector 9-8.4.&quot;\n    She thought for a moment. That was where Ominous Primes old stomping \ngrounds were. No doubt they took shelter in his lair. Well, at least she had \nan idea of where they were now. But, now she had to deal with Megatron and \nhis lacky&#39;s.\n\n"}}
