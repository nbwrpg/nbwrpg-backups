However, I do need EVERYONE to resubmit \nthe char profiles AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! I won&#39;t put any chars that \ndon&#39;t have profiles up on the members and characters list, and I&#39;ll \ncontinue bugging people untill they submit them.\n\nAnyways, the new site is at (drumroll) http://nbwrpg.com or \nwww.nbwrpg.com! Check it out (this isn&#39;t optional, its mandatory), \nand submit your chars! I hope it looks cooler than the last one, \ncause I&#39;ve been working on it for a while.\n\nThe links and message board arn&#39;t up because the CGI scripts arn&#39;t \nready yet, and the members and chars pages arn&#39;t up because I need \npeople to submit their chars for that. So the sooner everyone submits \nchars, the sooner the site will be complete!\n\nSome info for filling out the join form:\n\n1. Be sure to include the @... in your email. Some \npoeple forget that, and the new script won&#39;t accept applications \nwithout a proper email adress.\n\n2. For alliegence, please don&#39;t put &quot;Brooder&#39;s Group&quot; (just an \nexample) or something, put the official name of your team (Chosen \nOnes, BrootherHood, etc..). If your bot&#39;s team doesn&#39;t have an \nofficial name, put Neutral.\n\n3. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CORRECT BEFORE SUBMITTING! For changes to \nyour profile, you&#39;ll have to ask me to delete it and then you&#39;ll have \nto resubmit it. I&#39;ll make a validation page later, but for now be \nabsolutely sure that this is how you want your bot&#39;s profile to look \nbefore submitting.\n\n4. Prepare for Yanshosh taking over the world. Err.... You wern&#39;t \nsupposed to hear that, forget I typed it!\n\nAllrighty, there. The reason I&#39;ve been posting less than usual is \ncause I&#39;ve been working on the site, and probably will be considering \nI&#39;ll hopefully get flooded with char submissions.\n\nI&#39;ll leave you all alone to submit your chars now.\n\n\n"}}
