Another \nscreen came alive, this one showing a visual of the base. Autofire \npresses a finger on the screen where it showed a shuttle being \nunloaded by two bots, and the camera zooms in, centering on that \nspot. Their Decepticon symbols stood out plainly.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re gonna be right over them soon. Do you want to try to contact \nthem?&quot; Autofire asks, knowing that the Decepticon symbols would mean \nthey might be friendlier to Megatron than other bots. On the other \nhand, it might mean that they might want to kill him more.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The computer screen comes allive, the radar showing the ships energy\n&gt; signature, and about six energy signatures inside.
