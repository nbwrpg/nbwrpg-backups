I&#39;ve seen \nthem. They walk together now all the time. They have plans. Their \ngoing to change the old base to a moving underwater base.&quot;\nShe smiled. &quot;Well, nowing a lot about computers and ease dropping \ndoes help once in a while. But you can&#39;t trust Aracnia. She&#39;ll tell \nMegatron everything.&quot; she had a worried look on her face. She felt \nthat something wasn&#39;t right with Quickstike. She knew he liked her, \nbut how much, she couldn&#39;t say. She didn&#39;t want to hurt him by \ntelling him this, but he had to know. &quot;Look, Aracnia and Megatron are \nworking side by side. I can&#39;t take the chance and trust her now. I \ngot left behind once, and was counted for as dead. I didn&#39;t return \nbecause I&#39;m sure she would have thought me a traitor or something. \nI&#39;m no traitor, but I got to do what I can to stay alive.  your the \nonly one I trust. I don&#39;t trust Megatron, Aracnia, Hell Beast, or \nKitKat. It&#39;s just you and me. I know KitKat&#39;s a good leader and all, \nbut she listens to her spark and not her head. She&#39;s bound to get \nkilled. When that happens, I&#39;m toast. So, what do you say, we stick \ntogether on this?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike grinned at Dark Mouse. &quot;Sure thing.
