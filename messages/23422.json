The sands were very hot \nand the small bug needed to get all 8 of it&#39;s tiny feet off of it and into \nthe shade.\nBut before the small spider could get to the shade Diana jumped at it, just \nto try and scar it off, spitting and hissing. Throwing a little sand towards \nthe spider but only managing to slow it down.\nThe little arachnid then resuming it&#39;s journey towards the pod.\nDiana jumped at it again but she jumped away as the spider raised it&#39;s two \nlegs and bared its small fangs, too eager to get to the shade to let the \nfaline keep it from it.\n\nSo Diana backed up into the scorching sunlight while the spider moved into \nthe shade of her pod and then scurried under it, looking at where it \ndisappeared for a moment before looking around herself with a small mew.\nAlready feeling the heat against her fur.\nBut then she hard something, snapping her head around and turning her ears \nthis way and that.\nSomeone was yelling!\nSomeone! She wasn&#39;t alone out there!\nDiana located the direction of the yelling, or what tshe thought it was, and \nbegan ti run towards it, her little white wings flapping in her hurry but \nnot big enough to lift her off the ground.\n\nShe had to find out who was making all the noise. Maybe they could help \nher.*\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
