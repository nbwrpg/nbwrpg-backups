He was once again filled with excitement as they plummeted \ndown toward the ground, missing Iron Raptor&#39;s thoughts in the \nproccess. He loved flying! Alot of his life was spent on his wings, \nit was when he was most alive.\n\nHe smiles as he lands, expecting a joke or something from her. THe \nsmile is whiped off his face as Iron Raptor&#39;s palm hits the side of \nhis face, his head recoiling one way and then the other as she \nfollows up with a hit from the other side. The Maximal blinks in \nsurprise, looking down as Iron Raptor falls.\n\nHe couldn&#39;t help but chuckle as he sees her cape fall on her head, \nthinking that she looked very pretty collapsed on the ground with her \ncape covering most of her face. He tries to feel sorry for scaring \nher half to death, but that had really been the coolest flight he had \never had.\n\n-I&#39;m sorry, love,- he replies, kneeling down in front of her, -But I \ncouldn&#39;t resist testing out these new abilities.-\n\nHe looks at her, trying to make his eyes look like puppy eyes. -\nForgive me?-\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * It was a little cold at the hight that they were, and with the \nwind \n&gt; whipping her cape behind her, it wasn&#39;t exactly warm. But at least \nher fromt \n&gt; was saved from the cold, but only because it was against Prowl.\n&gt; But her fear kept her from caring that she was chilling in the \narmor, \n&gt; keeping her eyes closed and her body well plastered to Prowls.\n&gt; She heard his thought, and knew that this was coming from a man she \ncould \n&gt; swear was born with wings...or at least a flying guide.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor whimpers again as she opens one eye, her cheek against \nProwl&#39;s \n&gt; chest. Looking down as they happened to weev away from a \nparticularly sharp \n&gt; looking mountain peek. Whimpering a third time as she squeezed her \neyes shut \n&gt; and clung harder.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t know it at the time, but she had been clinging so hard \nto Prowl \n&gt; the mechanical tendens in her hands had been standing out.\n&gt; Her jaw clenched shut.\n&gt; But then, just as she thought her spark might fail from beating so \nhard, she \n&gt; suddenly noticed something...she could hear the flapping of her \ncape.\n&gt; She could&#39;t before, mainly because it was plastered against her \neven more \n&gt; then she was to Prowl before.\n&gt; Iron Raptor opened her eyes and looked sown, feeling a softer \ncurrent of air \n&gt; flow against her and watching her cape flitter in the find.\n&gt; They were still very high...but at least she didn&#39;t really have the \nworry of \n&gt; being plastered to the side of a mountain.\n&gt; She relaxed her grip...slightly. Sighing in relief.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Thank youuuuuaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * This was her reply right when Prowl cut his boosters, Iron \nRaptors eyes \n&gt; going wide and her grip resuming as they seemed to hang in mid-air \nfor a \n&gt; moment.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *gasp!*\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that they began to fall, just as her mind trailed off in \nher \n&gt; thanking Prowl, secretly cursing him as they plumited towards the \nforests \n&gt; below.\n&gt; Her eyes squeezed shut and her teeth gritting, clinging on for dear \nlife. \n&gt; The white hot light of fear coming into her head once again.\n&gt; Slag! She hated this!\n&gt; Iron Raptor remained in this position, even as Prowl reactivated \nhis \n&gt; boosters and stabalized himself on the ground. Landing.\n&gt; With a sigh, letting the breath she had been holding, out, Iron \nRaptor \n&gt; opened her eyes...finally realizing that they were surrounded by \ntrees and \n&gt; on the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; She let go of Prowl a little, keeping a hand on him to make sure \nthat she \n&gt; could still stand. Her legs felt like jell-o!\n&gt; Iron Raptor then turned and looked at Prowl with a scowl on her \nface, the \n&gt; rest of her helm retracting to let her hair fall down her shoulders.\n&gt; Prowl had known that she had been scared, but he had pulled that \nlast trick \n&gt; none the less.\n&gt; Iron Raptor raised a quick hand and brought the flat palm down \nagainst Prowl \n&gt; cheek, hard! Then she swung her hand up and hit the other cheek \nwith the \n&gt; back of it.\n&gt; Her had just been bitch slapped.\n&gt; Her knees suddenly giving out under her right after, maing her end \nup cross \n&gt; leged on the ground where she had stood, sitting on her rear. She \nhad known \n&gt; she was going to collaps...she just wanted to give Prowl a piece of \nher \n&gt; mind...that he couldn&#39;t listen to with his own, before she did fall.\n&gt; But now she was saticfide, sitting there and shaking visably, her \nmind \n&gt; clearer now thought...the hits making them so.\n&gt; The cape seemed to ruffle down from her height moments before, \nfloting down \n&gt; and nestling itself right on top of her head, some down her \nback...mose \n&gt; covering her face.\n&gt; From under the red fabrik there was a sigh, partly of annoyance and \nrelief.\n&gt; One thought in mind, directed right towards Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Jerk....&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________________________________IRIS:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris only grumbles, just as an old woman might as she looks onto \na bunch \n&gt; of children roughhousing. Remembering the good old days.\n&gt; But Iris was far from old. She was just as young as Iron Raptor, \nbecause she \n&gt; was a part of her programming, but much more mature. In body and \nmind.\n&gt; Iris humphs.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve seen data process faster then that!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But she crosses her arms as Firearm transforms and drives up to \nher, \n&gt; looking him over before looking at him sternly.\n&gt; Though, she didn&#39;t mean to wreck his jolly attitude.\n&gt; Iris easily jumped on but then looked down at the armor plating of \nhis \n&gt; mode.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Just try it, sunny, and only ONE of us will make it back to base \nin one \n&gt; piece. And it will most likely be the one without the cannon....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
