He transformed to his massive bot mode\nand sat down near Maxima. Joining his hands, he closed his eyes and\nfocused on the spark before him.\n\nIt was almost appeasing to feel her spark. She was calm right now,\nfree of any worry. He wished he could feel the same, but it was not\nfor him, at least not for now.\n\nAzureBlade: Now you might hear me through your spark, do you? I am\nAzureBlade and I am here should you need any help. You are wounded,\nbut somehow, not as bad as when I first sensed you.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 6/6/03 8:32:36 AM Central Daylight Time, \n&gt; Proudwing500k@h... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seeing no one, the dragon focused again on his spark feelings to\n&gt; &gt; detect the bot. He concentrated, again seeing the estranged spark, but\n&gt; &gt; this time, there seemed to be a feeling of amazement too. Focusing\n&gt; &gt; even more, he discovered its nature... a decepticon female warrior...\n&gt; &gt; and he felt her location.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He got out of his trance and flew quickly to the sides of the wounded\n&gt; &gt; bot. He lowered his head as a sign that he was not here for war, but\n&gt; &gt; rather for help.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: You are wounded, are you not? If you can hear me, I am\n&gt; &gt; here to help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Standing at the base of the waterfall. She gazed at him for a\nmoment, not in \n&gt; confusion or awe, but in serenity. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wounded?&quot; she finally spoke. Her voice like as always, deep,\nsophisticated \n&gt; femme voice with a fine mix command & soft gentleness. \n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, the waters she was in were healing her. Slowly, though. Her\nwings \n&gt; however, would be a while to repair or they will have to be replaced. \n&gt; \n&gt; She only stood there, gazing at the blue dragon.\n\n\n"}}
