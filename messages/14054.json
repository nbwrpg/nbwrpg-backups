The wound was near the \nspark, but missed it by an inch.  She picked up GoldenEye and took \nher to the entrance of the cave.  She put her just inside the door of \nthe base, out of harms way.  &quot;Someone take her to the CR.  She&#39;s hit.&quot;\nGoldenEye sat slumped over near the entrance with bullet holes in her \nsides, chest, legs and wings.  She was leaking badly.\n\nKitKat ran back outside and continued to spray the Maximals with gun \nfire.  She took a few more hits in the shoulders and hip.  She \ngroaned in pain, but continued to stand her ground.  This was her \nbase and she wasn&#39;t giving up. She was leaking badly, but she didn&#39;t \ncare.  She wsan&#39;t going to let a slagging maximal drive her from her \nown base.\n\n\n"}}
