He entered the ca=\r\nve cautiously\n&gt; &gt; worrying if one of the organic creators of the planet cal=\r\nled it \nhome\n&gt; &gt; much like he was prepared to do.

The\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; range scanners were damaged in the crash, but the short ranged=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worked and they revealed nothing.
