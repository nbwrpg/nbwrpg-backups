Then he&#39;s really gonna be in a bad mood.  Trust me=\r\n, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; know.  Ratchet was the same way.  Like dad like son.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I know.&quot; LEO PRIME said over the radio &quot;But sometime=\r\ns things are far&lt;br&gt;\nmore important than his anger.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen NIGHTSHI=\r\nFT arrived at POLAR CLAW&#39;s location he was already&lt;br&gt;\nstanding with RAMULU=\r\nS and the group&#39;s tactical expert PROWL, they were&lt;br&gt;\nall in robot mode st=\r\nanding at the shuttle.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWOLFGANG was standing off to the side manip=\r\nulating something. &quot;Its&lt;br&gt;\nfueled up and ready to go.&quot; WLFGANG said as he =\r\nstowed an energon&lt;br&gt;\ndispensing unit in its holster.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Good!&quot; POLA=\r\nR CLAW said. he was easily the largest of the group. While&lt;br&gt;\nnot as tall =\r\nas RODIMUS or TUSCON were, he was still broad and massive,&lt;br&gt;\ngiving he ap=\r\npearance of great size and ferocity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPOLAR CLAW turned to look at =\r\nNIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You&#39;re here because you know&lt;br&gt;\nTuscon better than we.&quot; There=\r\n was a dismissive grunt as he glanced at&lt;br&gt;\na PADD he had in his hand, it =\r\nis ohviously the notes and mission&lt;br&gt;\nparameters he recieved from LEO PRIM=\r\nE.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;He&#39;s gone out alone. Sensors showed that he was going off in t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\ndirection of that jungle where Rodimus is suppose to be.&quot; There was&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nanother pause from POLAR CLAW, &quot;The same direction Wheelie took as&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nwell.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPOLAR CLAW lowered his padd as he looked at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;Ev=\r\nery scan we&lt;br&gt;\nhave of that place shows it is a dense jungle, his inhanced=\r\n senses&lt;br&gt;\nwill not help him much there.
