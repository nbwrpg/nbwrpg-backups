Nearly everything about it seemed new and fresh .\n&gt; The doors opened as he approached as sensors detected his presence.\n&gt; Everything responded quickly to any voice command that he chose to\n&gt; utter.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they got Cyclonus back to the medical bay Fractyl quickly took\n&gt; charge of things, far more comfortable and even somewhat assertive in\n&gt; this more familiar enviornment. He quickly ran scans over the\n&gt; Insecticon, Bruticus-X and Cyclonus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl looked up at Hydras, &quot;These will need some time in the\n&gt; recharge chamber, but will other wise be fine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stepping over to Scourge he ran the scanner over him and frowned, &quot;He\n&gt; on the other hand will require a bit more work.&quot; he said carefully.\n&gt; &quot;He appears to have been partially drained of energy in a way that I\n&gt; cannot yet understand.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus and Inferno stood off to one side, letting the others work.\n&gt; They were primarilly warriors and soldiers, this was not their field\n&gt; of expertise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deepstryke, Phobia and Blackrazor also stood and waited, each with\n&gt; troubled looks. In a way Scourge was family, and they took his fall\n&gt; seriously.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus looked at Fractyl, &quot;If you need an energon transfusion, I am\n&gt; ready.&quot; he said quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Fractyl said, &quot;I believe I can handle this. But Even if I did\n&gt; need it, you are in no condition to do that. You need repairs\n&gt; yourself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I will wait till he his finished before I get mine.&quot; Cyclonus said \n&gt; stubbornly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl looked at Hydras hopping he would get Cyclonus to get some \n&gt; repairs.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time Hydras gets a communication, &quot;Sir, this is Sky\n&gt; Shadow. We still have your spark under survellience. So far there has\n&gt; been no movement.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Sky Shadow&#39;s info can be found at:\n&gt; http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Sky_Shadow_%28BW%29\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
