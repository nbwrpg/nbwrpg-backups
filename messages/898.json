That damn owl had scrapped him pretty well. Doing a quick internal check, he sees that his regenerating procces had done enough for him to be fit to fight. He looks around.\n\nHe charges at the first maximal he sees, Tavatron, shooting anc spraying acid at her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nShredder comes to a stop. He had dropped back when Megatron had called them off to battle. He looks around and walks further into the forest.\n\nHis scanner beeps. He looks at it. That was strange. There was a fairly strong energy reading nearby. One emmited by a craft.\n\nHe walks in the direction the scanner points.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm&#39;s arm beeps. Opening his wrist comp, his eyes widen. &quot;Shit.&quot; he swears.\n\nHe activates his comm-link, &quot;Zardus I need to go check on something. I shall be back shortly.&quot;\n\nHe flies out of the base, heading for his ship.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl looks around as the klaxon lights go off. He looks at Rampage. No time for that. He turns and takes off at a run toward the controll room.\n\n"}}
