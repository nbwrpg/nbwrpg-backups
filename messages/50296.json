Owlhawk brought the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; newcomers back to Maximal City. They met Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both sides have decided to work together. However\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya challanged Owlhawl to an honorable tradition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see the warrior nature of the Maximals. Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk and Katya are fighting each other in a\n&gt; &gt; shoot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fight. I&#39;ll let you take back Owlhawk now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turned to Ragnar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah he is strong and very military like.
