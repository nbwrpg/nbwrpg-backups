He had been \nthere a while, crying and beating the floor.  He suddenly heard a loud crack, \nand opened his optic sensors.  Rolling to his back, he looked up.  He saw a \njagged piece of metal fall, as did the rest of the cieling.  The metal \nplunged into Ramhorn&#39;s chest, the Maximal pinned under over two tons of \nmetal, screaming.  He closed his optics as more metal fell, his world now \nblack and a total void.\n\n"}}
