He \nopened it and flew outside. He went a bit far out. Close enough so \nthat they can rush back later, but far enough that another explosion \nwouldn&#39;t hurt them. It occured to Starscream that he could kill \nDrillbit right now. Eject the Cockpit and and detonate it. KitKat \nwould start to mourn, and he would be there to comfort her, and they \nwould fall in love. And no one would know he had killed Drillbit. He \ncould explain it as a program malfunction. No! He promised that he \nwould leave them together, no matter the circumstance. He stuffed the \nurge to kill Drillbit away deep inside and hovered as the ship went \ncrashing. He talked to Drillbit.\n\n&quot;So what do we do now? We&#39;ve lost the base, we&#39;ve lost the ship. \nWe&#39;ve got nothing left. I read something about another Pred base \naround here, but I think it&#39;s from another faction. We&#39;re nomads, and \njust sitting ducks for the next Chosen One attack. What do we do?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
