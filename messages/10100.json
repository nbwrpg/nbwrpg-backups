He could tell \nthat she was sad, and he was a bit mad at himself for reacting that way. He \nsighs quietly. Why did he doubt that she was a sincere Maximal? He could tell \nshe had a good spark, and a good sence of humor. He had yet to see any \nPredacons with that quality. He walks closer to her.\n\n&quot;Hey, when you&#39;re out of the CR chamber at the Ark, you want me to give you a \ntour of our base?&quot; he asks, trying to change the subject. He was mad at \nhimself for reacting as he did, and hoped that she wasn&#39;t mad at him for it.\n\n"}}
