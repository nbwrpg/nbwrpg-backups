Just to be sure, she stood \nup and and walked around the room. Her body was now normal. She sat \nback down and looked at the glass again. She drank it down and \nsmiled. &quot;THat wasn&#39;t so.....&quot; Her smile disappeared as sparks lept \nfrom her neck and wrists. Her tail twitched wildly and her optics \nflashed wildly in various colors.  She twitched and sputtered a bit. \nAfter a few seconds, her body returned to normal. With a little mech \nfluid leaking from her nose and ears, she grinned. &quot;Ah, finally. \nsomething with a kick.&quot;  She looked at her empty glass. &quot;Got another \none?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice chuckled, a chuck that he got from his brother.  It was low, \nand sounded evil.  Much like the greatest Leader of the Decepticons.  \nHe served up a large glass for himself, he had nothing to fear.  He \ndesigned the waveform to affect a tolerance of standard Maximal \nthermal regulators.  His entire body was custom componants, plus he \nwas turned into Transmetal 2.  He guzzled the cocktail and slammed \nthe glass down.  He processed the alcohol and absorded the energon \ndirectly into his power system.  \n&gt; &quot;Satisfaction enough?&quot;\n&gt; He let a low evil chuckle slip out, he wasn&#39;t going to lose this \ndrinking contest, at any cost.\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC- A few refrences to Malice&#39;s family.  Lets see if anyone can \nguess who Malice&#39;s older brother is.  I&#39;ll bet its a suprise for you \nall.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She could tell that Malice was up to something. Her instincts told \n&gt; her to be careful.  She took the drink and sniffed it. &quot;Hmm, seems \nto \n&gt; be delicious. However, it&#39;s hardly fair for me to have two drinks \n&gt; when you&#39;ve only had one. Fix one of these for yourself and we&#39;ll \n&gt; keep going with this little game.  No fair that the bartender has \nan \n&gt; unfair advantage.&quot; She grinned at him with her usual charming \nwolfish \n&gt; grin. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice was a little hurt.  One of his most potent drinks \nflopped.  \n&gt; As far as he knew, no Maximal or Predacon could handle the energy \n&gt; waveform.  It was just not feasible.  Perhaps systems could be \n&gt; adjusted to tolerate just a little more, but this was ridicules.  \nHe \n&gt; could out drink any Seeker, Wrecker, Gestalt, Triplechanger, and \neven \n&gt; Supreme Commander.  This wasn&#39;t right.\n&gt; &gt; Then it hit him.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;She might be hiding the problems that stuff is causing her.  \nThat \n&gt; explains the optic color.  If so, then I&#39;ll catch her in the act.  \n&gt; Hmp, she should be an actress on Broadway or something.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he dove into a series of spare part compartments and drew from \n&gt; the liquors, he began to create a second energy format.  As he \nmixed \n&gt; a new drink in a new glass, he secretly added extra energy and \n&gt; manipulated it into this secondary waveform.  It did not affect the \n&gt; color, taste, smell, or texture, but it would cause a specific \n&gt; problem.  This attempt, was aimed at her thermal regulator.  In her \n&gt; current state, she would seek more than liquid refreshment.  Sure \nit \n&gt; was a cruel joke, but at least it wasn&#39;t going to harm her.  She \n&gt; could just run a diagnostic cycle on her systems and the problem \n&gt; would cease to be.  With a big smirk, he served his worthy opponant \n&gt; the new cocktail.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;See if this razes your regulators.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She took the glass and sniffed it. &quot;Hmm, smells delightful.&quot;  She \n&gt; &gt; downed it and grinned. Her optics flashed and glowed brightly for \na \n&gt; &gt; moment and then returned to normal. &quot;Hmm, not bad at all.&quot;  She \n&gt; &gt; smiled and remained sitting in a proper fashion.  What she wasn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; going to do was give him the satisfaction of knowing the that the \n&gt; &gt; drink overpowered some of her systems enough so that she couldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; stand up. As long as she remained sitting for a bit untill her \n&gt; &gt; systems returned to normal, she could pull it off. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am Des Wraith, the Archfiend of Flames.
