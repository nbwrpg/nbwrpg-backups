As far as Prowl could remember, he had never seen this bot in his\nlife, but he knew who Optimus Prime was, and the fact that this\ntransformer used to be him, and was still an Autobot, was a good sign.\n\n&quot;Um, ok. I think you picked kinda a bad place to tour this planet,\nthough, there&#39;s a war going on.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Scorpius (No last name)&quot; &lt;scorpiusis@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The new transformer looks at Prowl, something about his name makes him \n&gt; think. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again Prowl, the name&#39;s Optimal Prime,\nI use to \n&gt; be Optimus Prime but I was rebuilt like this after a transwarp\nexplosion. \n&gt; The wave even affected the matrix shell. And just so you know, I&#39;m\nstill an \n&gt; Autobot,&quot; he informs Prowl.\n\n\n"}}
