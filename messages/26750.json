However as I sit here and read my mail, I see the group \nbeing polarized.  This deeply upsets me.\n\n    I did not know Minime well.  In fact I hardly, if ever interacted with \nhim.  However we were instructed to remember him.  Do we honor this memory by \narguing amongst ourselves?  Will we slowly drive the members of this group \naway until we run out of targets and turn against each other?  Or will we \nstop the senseless bickering, honor him with a day of silence, and continue \non mourning and remembering in our own ways?\n\n"}}
