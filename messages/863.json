She didn&#39;t \nneed him to protect her, she was flattered but she could look after herself.\nBrightBlade stepped in front of him,took Gangon by the shoulders and pushed \nagainst them, she wanted to give him the hint to step back and lowed his \nweapon.\nShe smiled at him...*\n\n&quot; You have done enough, you need to rest. Leave this troublesome Maximal to \nme. Please, rest.&quot; she winked at him, &quot; For me.&quot;\n\n* It was then that she turned towards Tavatron and growled, nobot tried to \nhurt her partner and got away with it!!\nBrightBlade picked up her gun again and aimed it at the boulder that \nTavatron hid behind, with a wild yip she fired at the boulder and watched as \ndust and pebbles fly into the air.\nWithout warning she ran over and jumped on top of the boulder once the dust \ncleared away, she stared Tavatron straight in the optics and then squatted \ndown so that she was almost face to face with her.\nShe snickered in the Maximals face...*\n\n&quot; Pay-back&#39;s a bitch, huh?!&quot;\n\n* It was then that she fired her weapon at point-blank range at Tavatron&#39;s \nchest. Pay-back WAS a bitch, for her enemies!*\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
