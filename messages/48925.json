Other times the head would still be functioning (in \none case\n&gt; waspinators body got trash compacted and another TOTALLY dis-\nassembled) and\n&gt; be able to direct parts of the body to do whatever (ie waspinators \nhead\n&gt; crawling around by being attached to the wrist of a hand)\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically even without a head Inferno/warhead aren&#39;t going to die, \ndunno\n&gt; where you guys got this silly notion stasis lock = death for bots. \nRemember\n&gt; on the show Black arachnia went into extreme stasis lock and shut\n&gt; down....they tossed her in the CR chamber and she woke up (it was \nthe big\n&gt; romeo/juliet speech episode done by silverbolt). However again the \ndegree of\n&gt; damage a bot can take before they die varied. WAspinator could be \nutterly\n&gt; torn apart yet drag himself around to a CR chamber...dinobot gets \nbeat on\n&gt; for a day and literally dies.\nOOC:\nI think Dinobot died because of the cybervenom, first from \nTaranchulus then from Quickstrike. But what part do you need to bring \nto the CR chambor to heal them? \n\n\n"}}
