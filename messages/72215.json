He didn&#39;t know Magmatron but he figured there\n&gt; was ample time to learn about who he is and what he&#39;s up to.  Of course he\n&gt; was less than thrilled with the idea but sometimes everyone had to endure\n&gt; what they hated in order to find ways of dealing with them properly.  It was\n&gt; one of Master Yokitron&#39;s  finest of lessons and one of his most difficult.\n&gt; He keeps up with the group but twitches his tail as he appears in deep\n&gt; thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Magmatron..  Interesting.  I suppose I will just have to be patient and\n&gt; see what he has to say. &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt is indeed possible that TUSCON did not know much about the\ndecorated Warrior-General that was MAGMATRON, since he probrably came\nonline after MAGMATROn had disappeared.\n\nHe was a PREDACON and arose ouf of the ashes of the ancient\nDecepticons. He was in general known, at least to the few they did\nknow him, to be a warior of great cunning and skill. He was both\nhighly intelligent, with a very long military background. He was a\ngifted tactical genius and yet capable of great savagery as well. Some\nthought he had been defeated in some battle, perhaps assasinated by an\nup and comming Predacon. But yet here he was finally resurfacing after\nfive decades or more here on old Earth.\n\n------------------\n\nGUILEDART and his two henchmen led TUSCON to what atfirst appeared to\nbe a cliff face positioned on the side of a mountain side. It was as\nif some great force had sheered off a side of the mountain towards the\nbottom, leaving a smooth and very steep wall leading up perhaps\nseveral hundred feet. However that is not the direction that TUSCON\nwas being led.\n\nAs the the path they were on came up and over and met the cliff face\nthey could turn and see a huge valley opening up before them, a large\nriver running down from the surrounding mountains, along with large\ntrees and other assorted folliage.\n\nGUILEDART pulled out a strange device and oriented it just off the\npath ahead ihn a strange and obsure clearing then activated it. As he\ndid so a shimmering energy field appeared looking very much like a\ndoor, it was perhaps a thousand yards or so ahead of them.\n\n&quot;There.&quot; GUILEDART said as he pointed at it.\n\nThey continued walking on, HARDHEAD and HYDRA leading TUSCON with\nweapons still drawn. They seemed to have little or no regard for\nTUSCON&#39;s injured state as they moved quickly over the broken ground\nthat quickly sloped downward.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
