Suddenly coming to a halt he \nyelled &quot;WHO DARES TELL THE GREAT HAVOTRON TO STOP.&quot; \n\nAfter the dragon landed he listened contently.  &quot;You, may, join the \nranks of the D.E.D.  Decepticons for Earth&#39;s Domination....or \nDemise...  I am Lord Havotron, leader of the D.E.D, and future ruler \nof the universe. &quot;\n\nNeedlenose looked at the dragon eerily.  \n\nMeanwhile back with the Contstructicons.  Scrapper looked to the \nspeck in the distance that was Havotron.  &quot;Constructicons, listen \nto me....Havotron has not been fair to us, mad because one of our \nranks could not complete the joining into the gestalt.  Would \nMegatron, no I don&#39;t beleive so.  I have devised a plan, to bring the \nreal leader of the Decepticons back to power, we, the \nConstructicons will re-join with Megatron.&quot;\n\nOOC:  Cyberwolf, the D.E.D are another faction of Decepticons, \nwith the leader Havotron.  Thier base is inside of Mt Fuji, not with \nthe other Decepticons which base is now moving slowly through \nHudsons bay.\n\n"}}
