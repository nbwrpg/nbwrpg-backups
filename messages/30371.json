Under the new \nleader, she had her doubts. But for KitKat&#39;s sake, she&#39;d stick with \nthem incase they needed help. But for the most part, she was one \nmouse who looked out for number one, herself. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind crushing some Maximals, but many of are troops are\n&gt; still havn&#39;t returned from the attack on Hell Beasts base.&quot;\n&gt; He activated his comm.\n&gt; &quot;DarkFate, Killfest, we have a chance to attack the Maximals with \nother\n&gt; Predacons.
