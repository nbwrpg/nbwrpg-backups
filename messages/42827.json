Before I met Aerotaur I can&#39;t said a \nlot, I just can said that he&#39;s the guardian of the little Trinity. \nTell me, please, Do you think that Aerotaur is in danger due his \nleader? could he try to kill Aerotaur?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Terrataur::\n&gt;        &quot;Yes.  We chased him here after the incident and his ship \nwas \n&gt; destroyed in space.  We think a stasis pod containing his body \nlanded on the \n&gt; planet somewhere.  We haven&#39;t started tracking him yet though.  Can \nyou, \n&gt; perhaps, tell me what has happened to Aerotaur since he landed \nhere?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
