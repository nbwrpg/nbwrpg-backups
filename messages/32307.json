I&#39;ll continue from there)\n\n(and JP, that was so cheap!! Cyndro is blocking all enemy transmissions, so \nyour bots cant communicate!!!! i better not see you send another \ntransmission)\n\n\nElement turned, seeing Hell Beast and his troops enter the battle. He \ngrowled. Looking back at Abominus, he saw that Galaxor had engaged him in \ncombat by now, and attacking an already fighting bot was pointless. He \nturned toward the eastern bots and charged at them. Four missiles flew out \nof his two missile launchers and Element mentally guided one toward each of \nthe bots he was attacking (Aquarious, Black Aracnia, Bezerker, and \nQuickstrike).\n\n\nCyndro almost laughed as some morons positioned themselves between the CF \nand the Element (Hell Beast, Tankkor, Rampage, and Inferno). That was the \nmost stupid thing he had ever seen. Arming all his weapons (the ship&#39;s \nweapons :), he fired them all at this group of four dumb preds. Two \nmissiles, four EMP blasts, and four laser shots were fired at each bot. The \nround disk thingy on top of the Element, which was still jamming all enemy \ntransmissions, flashed and sent a shockwave at the four bots, strong enough \nto throw them off their feet and leave them defenceless against the oncoming \nweaponfire. The missiles were homing missiles, and the EMP blasts and \nlaserfire were very well aimed.\n\n\n\n\nA portal opened above earth and a fairly large ship with Maximal markings \nemerged from it, followed by heavy weaponfire. Behind it, a Predacon ship \nemerged. The two ships raced toward earth, though at every shot, Predacon \nweaponfire was getting closer and closer to hitting the Maximal ship. \nFinally, the Maximal ship returned fire, hitting the Predacon ship straight \non, but not before being hit in the engines with a Predacon shot.\n\nThe Predacon vessel exploded since the shot had gone through crucial parts \nof the ship, but the Maximal vessel angled toward earth and kept flying. \nInside, the crew scrambled to their escape pods.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
