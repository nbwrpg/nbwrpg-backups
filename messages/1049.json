He looks at the new \nbots and lowers his gun. If it came to a fight, he and Nemesis were severly \noutnumbered.\n\n&quot;This is earth, friend. Earth in it&#39;s prehistoric times. The alliance is \nsimply ... the superior faction on this planet. While lacking troops, we are \nthe best warriors. We&#39;re here to ensure the destruction of the other bots...&quot; \nZardus pauses, hoping that this information was enough.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl grins to himself, noting how Iron Raptor began to babble like Liono. He \nlooks at her.\n\n&quot;I suggest you don&#39;t give false encouragement. It can really get a bot down \nin the future. In truth, we fought like crap.&quot; He sigs and turns to Teltoli. \n&quot;Follow me, I&#39;ll show you the CR chambers.&quot;\n\nProwl walks off down a hallway.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm falls backwards with a surprised look on his face. Taking the \nopportunity, Shredder jumps up and runs off into the forest, going through \nbushes and dodging trees at full speed.\n\n&quot;Slag!&quot; DeathStorm mutters under his breath and runs off after Shredder.\n\n"}}
