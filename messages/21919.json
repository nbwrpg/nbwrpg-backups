THe speck grows, soon recognizable as a transport pod, with \nfour stasis pods attatched to it...\n\nKillfest frowns, watching the pod land near him, release the four \nstasis pods, and fly off again. He walks toward the stasis pods, \narming his wrist blasters as they begin to open.\n\nAn evil smile crosses Killfest&#39;s face as he sees his team, newly \nawakened, arise from the pods, walking to him.\n\n&quot;Welcome back,&quot; he says to them, the team nodding, &quot;We seem to be on \na planet. According to my scanners, one with translife, Predacons \namong them.&quot;\n\nThe Predacons were killers and good warriors, perfectly suiting \nKillfest. He activates his comm, sending a transmission to the \nCouncil Base.\n\n&quot;Predacons, this is Commander Killfest,&quot; he says. He was, after all, \ncommander of a terrorist group, a much depleted one, but a deadly \ngroup none-the-less, &quot;Me and my group are stranded on an island, \nperhaps you could send a transport pod to my location?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Killfest/Scyther/EndBringer/Demise/Greven/Crovax::\n&gt; \n&gt; The sound of guns filled the air, accompanied by screaming bots and \n&gt; laughing terrorists. Killfest ducked under a shot, firing back at \nthe \n&gt; bot that had fired and killing him with a well placed shot through \n&gt; the spark. He looked around and saw burning buildings, dead bodies, \n&gt; and scattered metal pieces everywhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; This was just a normal attack on a normal space colony, like so \nmany \n&gt; that he had led in the past. There was nothing different about \nit ... \n&gt; except for the fact that it marked the day of his defeat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest was the leader of a fairly large group of terrorists. They \n&gt; traveled through the vastness of space, pilfering, sacking, and \n&gt; razing many a peaceful colony, selling scrapp and weapons to other \n&gt; various terrorists. It was an easy life, especially when a group \nwas \n&gt; as equipped for fighting as Killfest&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; The terrorist leader jumped backwards as a bot&#39;s body flew past \nhim. \n&gt; He got a glance of it before it landed in the ruins of a collapsed \n&gt; building, seeing that it was missing its head. That was the work of \n&gt; Scyther, one of the bots in Killfest&#39;s group. Scyther was \nexperienced \n&gt; in undercover missions, possessing the ability to alter his robot \n&gt; mode, changing his appearance completely and making him virtually \n&gt; unrecognizable. That, along with cloaking, spark signature masking, \n&gt; and several other abilities, made him the perfect spy, and an \n&gt; excellent assassin. Killfest glanced over to where the bot had come \n&gt; flying from, watching Scyther slash off the head of another bot. \n&gt; \n&gt; Scyther preferred disabling opponents through decapitation and then \n&gt; stabbing them cleanly through the spark instead of splattering \ntheir \n&gt; guts everywhere. Killfest had always preferred to mutilate his \n&gt; enemies, but it was a matter of personal preference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing a group of enemy bots banded together and firing, Killfest \n&gt; stretched out his arms, pointing his fists at them. Two large guns \n&gt; emerged out of both his huge wrists, firing four blue beams at the \n&gt; ground near the bots. The beams hit the ground at precisely the \nsame \n&gt; spot, making a grenade-sized explosion that sent the bots flying in \n&gt; different directions.\n&gt; \n&gt; A loud scream of rage came from behind him, followed by multiple \n&gt; explosions. Killfest ducked as a mutilated bot flew over his head. \nHe \n&gt; glanced up at it, actually able to see through it from the damage \n&gt; done to its torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; EndBringer, Killfest thought to himself as he fired a pair of optic \n&gt; lasers at a random enemy, blowing off its head. EndBringer was \n&gt; another bot under Killfest&#39;s command. Unlike, Scyther, EndBringer \nhad \n&gt; no liking for a clean kill. Instead, he enjoyed mutilating his \n&gt; opponent as much as possible, leaving the body in pieces, and often \n&gt; completely unrecognizable as an ex-transformer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest glanced behind him at the form of the half-insane bot, \n&gt; seeing a few of the colony defenders ganging up on him. He watched \n&gt; with an evil smile on his face as one of the attackers jumped at \n&gt; EndBringer, flying back as one of EndBringer&#39;s four tentacles \n&gt; contacted with him, sending electricity through him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning back to the battle yet again, a missile launcher flipped \nover \n&gt; Killfest&#39;s shoulder as he saw a bot rushing at him. The bot jumped, \n&gt; but was blown to pieces by a missile before he ever hit Killfest. \nAn \n&gt; ear splitting scream flew across the battlefield, the terrorist \n&gt; leader chuckling as he heard it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Demise. Killfest glanced to his left, seeing the bot holding an \nenemy \n&gt; in one of his huge clawed, arms, a cable connecting the held bot to \n&gt; Demise&#39;s mouth. That was Demise&#39;s own special attack. The chord \nthat \n&gt; he launched from his mouth latched on to the victim bot, hacking \ninto \n&gt; their neural circuitry and sending unbearable waves of pain through \n&gt; them. Other than that, Demise had very weak optic lasers as his \nonly \n&gt; other long-range weapon, his hands being too large and accuard to \n&gt; hold anything else. Demise threw his now-twitching victim aside, \n&gt; swiping his claws at another attacker. Behind Killfest, a bot ran \nup, \n&gt; jumping at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest roared as a pair of hands wrapped around his neck, the bot \n&gt; obviously attempting to tackle him to the ground from behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest was much too large for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reaching behind him and simply grabbing the bot&#39;s back, Killfest \n&gt; swung the attacker over his shoulder, bringing up his knee and \n&gt; slamming the bot onto it. Sickening cracks sounded from the bot&#39;s \n&gt; torso, Killfest dropping him to the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest turned his head as another scream reaches his ears, \nquickly \n&gt; turning into a wet-sounding gurgling. He chuckled, watching a huge \n&gt; bot drop the crushed body of another one of the defenders onto the \n&gt; ground. The defender&#39;s torso was crushed, his head and limbs \nsticking \n&gt; out in strange angles. The huge bot was Greven, another member of \n&gt; Killfest&#39;s team. It was usually Greven and EndBringer who caused \nmost \n&gt; of the gore on the battlefield, being the two most violent bots on \n&gt; the team. Greven grabbed another bot, smashing a fist through its \n&gt; chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; A shot hit the terrorist leader in the back, Killfest turning \naround \n&gt; and frowning. He was seeing something that usually didn&#39;t happen on \n&gt; these raids. A colony defender was holding off a whole group of \n&gt; terrorists, about five or six of them. The bot was fairly large, \nbut \n&gt; then the terrorists were trained killers..\n&gt; \n&gt; The terrorist leader took a step forward as one of the terrorists \n&gt; jumped forward at the bot, a large shot blowing the terrorist back. \n&gt; The bot jumped back from another terrorist, the large cannon that \nwas \n&gt; attached instead of his left arm smoking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Growling, Killfest took off at a jog toward the bot, the other \n&gt; terrorists around the defender making it impossible to aim. He \n&gt; watched the bot jump up, his jetpack blazing. He fired a few blue \n&gt; optic shots, but failed to hit. He growled louder as the defender \n&gt; transformed into a tank and fell to the ground, crushing three of \nthe \n&gt; terrorists under his wheels.\n&gt; \n&gt; That was enough. Reaching into a storage compartment, the terrorist \n&gt; armed an EMP rifle. Aiming it at the enemy bot, he fired three \ntimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Energy waves flickered over the tank&#39;s armor as all three of the \nEMP \n&gt; shots hit him, disabling circuits as they contacted. Continuing to \n&gt; move for a few seconds, the bot finally stopped after running over \n&gt; the remains of another one of the colony defenders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest growled, looking at the tank and then glancing into the \n&gt; distance, looking at the other side of the colony. He smiled, \n&gt; watching a wave of destruction come toward his group. That was \n&gt; Crovax, his second in command, leading the other half of Killfest&#39;s \n&gt; group through the other side of the colony.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few hours later, the terrorists were gathered in a basement, \n&gt; counting their gains and losses. The bot Killfest had stunned was \n&gt; strapped to the table, now awake, swearing and yelling for them to \n&gt; let him go and fight him. He was too strong for metal bonds, so \nthey \n&gt; had to use energon ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly, the door blew in, a group of Maximals rushing in, weapons \n&gt; leveled at the chests of the terrorists.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re under arrest,&quot; one of them said, looking in disgust \n&gt; Killfest, &quot;Charged with murder. You can give us your weapons and go \n&gt; peacefully, or we can blast you to little pieces and take you back \nto \n&gt; Cybertron that way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest laughed, &quot;Maximals are putting me under arrest? How about \nwe \n&gt; use your pieces for scrap!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The terrorist leader brought up his EMP rifle, firing a shot at \n&gt; Kluster&#39;s chest. The Maximal ducked, firing back at Killfest. For \nthe \n&gt; next several seconds, the room was filled with gunfire, objects \n&gt; exploding and bots screaming. Killfest spun around after ducking a \n&gt; shot, his eyes widening as he saw the colony defender&#39;s cannon \naimed \n&gt; at him. The table had obviously been shot during the battle. \nWithout \n&gt; time to respond, Killfest was hit by an explosion, the room going \n&gt; black....\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Now, a little while later, Killfest flies through space in a prison \n&gt; pod, remembering that battle. After it, the Maximals had taken the \n&gt; survivors of the group to trial, and sentenced most of them to \ndeath. \n&gt; He could still remember the day that his own sentence was carried \n&gt; out....\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; He and the others in his group that weren&#39;t sentenced to death had \n&gt; been marched out to the spaceports, a crowd gathering to watch. \nTheir \n&gt; sentence was to be put in a pod, and sent out on a charted route \nthat \n&gt; would pass no major sectors, to fly through the vacuum of space \n&gt; forever.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other members of his group that had escaped death were Scyther, \n&gt; EndBringer, Demise, and Greven. They were not any worse than the \n&gt; others, in fact quite the opposite. Scyther didn&#39;t have any sort of \n&gt; record, as a bot like him was impossible to track. EndBringer, \n&gt; Demise, and Greven were brushed off by the record keepers as insane \n&gt; homicidal bots, and Killfest himself was very careful to conceal \nhis \n&gt; tracks. Due to lack of evidence, the Maximals had been forced to \nlet \n&gt; them live.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Maximal commander that had captured Killfest stood in the \ncrowd, \n&gt; watching, his team around him. The Maximal commander&#39;s name was \n&gt; Kluster, and his team included Rex, Proto, Grimmler, and recently, \n&gt; Firearm, who was the bot that had caused Killfest&#39;s defeat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest and the other terrorists were put in stasis pods, and then \n&gt; launched out to space. The crowd began to disperse, but one bot \n&gt; stayed hidden from view on the roof of a building, watching the \npods \n&gt; turn into small dots in the distance, the light of their escort&#39;s \n&gt; engine disappearing from view.\n&gt; \n&gt; This bot&#39;s name was Hunter. He was a bot whose desire to destroy \n&gt; Killfest outmatched his desire to survive. Killfest had taken all \n&gt; that was dear to Hunter on one raid on one colony, killing the only \n&gt; femm Hunter had ever loved. Hunter had been left alive by accident, \n&gt; and he had sworn to rid the world of the terror Killfest had \ncaused. \n&gt; His whole life had been dedicated to that since the moment he had \n&gt; discovered who had led the attack on his colony.\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing down at the planned route of the pods, a document that he \n&gt; had &#39;borrowed&#39; from the Maximal elders, he growls to himself. The \n&gt; Maximals might see it fit to escort the pods to a few lightyears \naway \n&gt; and then trust them to follow their course from there, but Hunter \n&gt; didn&#39;t. He would follow Killfest&#39;s pod, and make sure that it \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; waver from its track.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hunter was a loyal Maximal, and only respect for Maximal law \n&gt; prevented him for blowing Killfest&#39;s pod to smithereens as soon as \nit \n&gt; was out of scanning range from Cybertron. If the pod wavered at all \n&gt; from its course, though...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hunter turned, walking back to his small ship and lifting off, \n&gt; following the pods.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Flying through space in his pod that served as a prison, Killfest&#39;s \n&gt; thoughts dwell on that period in his life, his defeat. He clenches \n&gt; his fists in the pod, being able to stay conscious even through all \n&gt; the precautions. He had tracked his progress all the way from \n&gt; Cybertron, and he knew where he was. \n&gt; \n&gt; He also knew what had happened to his crew. They had been sent off \n&gt; along with him, but as soon as the escort left the pods, a ship had \n&gt; come out of transwarp, and when it was gone, so were the other \npods, \n&gt; and Killfest had been left alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; He&#39;d had plenty of time to think. Playing over the final battle \nagain \n&gt; and again, the face of that your colony defender had become the \n&gt; object of his hatred. To him, it meant defeat, weakness, everything \n&gt; that may have caused his downfall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest clenches his fists tighter as the pod comes across some \n&gt; turbulence, being diverted from its path by a transwarp portal. If \n&gt; only he got to see that bot again...\n\n\n"}}
