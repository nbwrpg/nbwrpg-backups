He spins around to \nsee several bots arrive at battle.\n\nAstral smiles. New targets..\n\n&quot;Lavacons, UNITE!&quot; he yells out. Fenox, Starlight, Griplash, and \nRecklessa all transform into various body-parts. Shots whizz past \nthem as they combine, forming the giant Dark Lavatron.\n\nDark Lavatron laughs. &quot;Feel my wrath, Maximal!&quot; He yells out in a \ndeep voice, stomping toward Snow Tech and Shadow Cat and firing \nmissiles down at them. A missile hits the ground, flames rushing \nacross the grassland. The ground shakes as his feet make large \nimprints in it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; *The little fuzz ball looked up at Iron Raptor, He understood what \nshe \n&gt; said,and would do what she asked.
