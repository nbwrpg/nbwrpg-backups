For example: \n&gt; What kind of blaster? Plasma? Laser?\n&gt; What does the boomerang look like (other than\n&gt; mettalic)? is it razor sharp? \n&gt; and describe the boa, (i&#39;m not sure what that is\n&gt; =P).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; O.k. here&#39;s your chance to approve some weapons\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; Shadow Star or not.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.
