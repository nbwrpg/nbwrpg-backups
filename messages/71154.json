He falls to one knee and then to the other.  The battery fluid loss h=\r\nad indeed taken him.  \n\nQuickstride and Uproar are quick to try and catch h=\r\nim.\n\n&quot;Woahh, Rodimus and Legacy have a point Sir.  It&#39;s time you took care =\r\nof your own needs.&quot;\n\nReplies Quickstride as he and Uproar now help him to h=\r\nis feet.  Tucson still had that apprehension.  Although he needed help, he =\r\nstill felt that the needs of his comrades had to come first.\n\n&quot; My - own ne=\r\neds - can wait.  The - others need help more than I do.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot cou=\r\nld see what was happening.\n\n&quot;Stubborn as usual.  C&#39;mon Tucson, Rodimus and =\r\nLegacy are right, you need ta take care of yourself! I know what happened i=\r\nn the past was hard for you ta take, but that wasn&#39;t your fault!  You got s=\r\ntruck from behind by Cyclonus, and there was no way of predicting that!&quot;\n\nT=\r\nucson sighs.\n\n&quot;I - could have prevented it though.  And I - can&#39;t - let it =\r\nhappen again.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot could see that Tucson did need help urgently.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Legacy, please get Tucson ta the CR Chambers ASAP.  And make sure he act=\r\nually takes your advice.&quot;\n\nTucson couldn&#39;t say anything else.  He knew his =\r\nlittle sister was right.\n\nStraight Shot looks to Rodimus now knowing why Tu=\r\ncson was acting as he was.  It wasn&#39;t out of revenge, it was out of compass=\r\nion, and guilt.  But a guilt he did not deserve to carry.\n\n&quot; He feels reall=\r\ny bad about what happened..  He thinks that your disappearence and abductio=\r\nn was his fault.  In all truths it was no one&#39;s fault but Hydras&#39;s.  Before=\r\n he became a Prime, he really took his job seriously and still does but bac=\r\nk then, for an Autobot, he was all dedication and didn&#39;t care what kind of =\r\nconsequences he&#39;d face while going above and beyond the call of duty.  All =\r\nhe cares about is his comrades, and even back then, his loyalty was soley f=\r\nor you and the others.  He was always so proud to be working with you, and =\r\nwould do anything to uphold the level of heroism that&#39;s always expected of =\r\nAutobot and Maximal kind.  Then, that day, the time you were taken from us.=\r\n.  That was the day he was trying to divert enemy attentions away from you =\r\nby doing what was highly uncharacteristic of himself.  Decoy work was alway=\r\ns deemed for those who were natural built speedsters, but he&#39;s no speedster=\r\n.  When he chose his form, he chose the working class vehicle, which is kno=\r\nwn more for strength and durability than speed. But out of desperation to t=\r\nry and save you, he did what he normally didn&#39;t do, and then, that&#39;s when h=\r\ne got shot by Cyclonus. It took him off line instantly.  He doesn&#39;t remembe=\r\nr anything after that.  I was taken off line at the same time, but, I did s=\r\ntay conscious enough to see the blast. Shortly after he went off line, I di=\r\nd.  But strange, I remember more than he does.  And that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting =\r\nas he is.  He&#39;s trying to sorta make up for lost time.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHe turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me=\r\n. It&#39;s about time I actually\n&gt; put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired =\r\nfrom Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; You really should have an assistant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes=\r\n. Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you to assist me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus=\r\n looked at Tuscon strangely. &quot;Tuscon!&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice had a surprised\n&gt; tim=\r\nber to it, the look on his face turning to full blown incredulousness.\n&gt; &quot;Y=\r\nou have just been through two battles, the first one nearly killed you,\n&gt; a=\r\nnd you still haven&#39;t recovered the energon from that. And now you are going=\r\n\n&gt; to start trying to repair others?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus shook his head, &quot;From wh=\r\nat I have been told Legacy has been one of\n&gt; the ones who worked on Nightli=\r\nght, why don&#39;t we let him continue to work as\n&gt; a medic until our two docto=\r\nrs are able to be recovered, assuming that is\n&gt; possible.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy&#39;s si=\r\nngle optic flashed as he looked at Tuscon and Rodimus. While he\n&gt; was face =\r\nwas as cold as ever, there was the impression of annoyance coming\n&gt; from hi=\r\nm. &quot;I have the sum total of Maximal and Predacon medical,\n&gt; technological, =\r\nhistorical and military knowledge up to approximately 57 of\n&gt; this planet y=\r\nears from now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Focusing on Tuscon Legacy continued, &quot;For you to attem=\r\npt repairs in your\n&gt; damaged state is both illogical and potentially detrim=\r\nental to your health\n&gt; and the health of those that you are desiring to rep=\r\nair. You cannot know how\n&gt; much longer your systems will continue with out =\r\nfailure. Should they fail at\n&gt; an inopportune moment it could have catastro=\r\nphic results.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor nodded and watched in silence=\r\n at the dormant figure of Megatron,\n&gt; &gt; after a large while he followed Tuc=\r\nson and said &quot;I offer mi asistance...\n&gt; &gt; and I have somne ideas to keep sa=\r\nfe the ark and with out changes for our\n&gt; &gt; time line&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord and=\r\n kup went inside the ark and closed it down, they walked\n&gt; towards\n&gt; &gt; the =\r\ncr chambers and windlord opened his comlink to Rodimus and Tucson\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wind=\r\nlord and Kup to the Primes... the Ark is locked down, we request\n&gt; &gt; permit=\r\nion to go to a Cr&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds to Perceptor with a sm=\r\nile of appreciation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you Perceptor, of course, you&#39;re welcom=\r\ne to assist me and I could\n&gt; always use some advice.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He opens the =\r\nchannel to Windlord and Kup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Permission granted Windlord and Kup. =\r\nRest easy my friends.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Windlord and Kup step into the re=\r\ncharging chamber, the fuzors also show\n&gt; up. From the damage on their frame=\r\ns they have the same thought in mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good battle.&quot; Noctorro said to =\r\nKup and Windlord, &quot;But I look forward to a\n&gt; time when we can live in peace=\r\n, and will not be battling the Predacons.&quot; He\n&gt; sighed as his CR chamber op=\r\nened. He turned and stepped back into it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other Fuzor&#39;s followed s=\r\nuit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;As long as Hydras is still around it won&#39;t happen!&quot; Bantor said\n=\r\n&gt; sarcastically.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca nodded sagely, &quot;There may yet come a time.&quot; He =\r\nsaid as he checked over\n&gt; his soldiers and then stepped into his own chambe=\r\nr. &quot;But until then we must\n&gt; be vigilant.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He nodded as the door of th=\r\ne recharge pod closed and he begins the proccess\n&gt; of being repaired.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n(TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
