He steps back, turning his head to look at Quake as the lizard \nenters.\n\nProwl nearly jumps at Arcangel&#39;s voice over his comm, grabbing his gun when \nhe hears that the Cybertronian Fire was under attack. He frowns. There was no \nshaking, and no sounds or fliquering lights, unlike at the Ark. He looks at \nKluster.\n\n&quot;Are we under attack?&quot;\n\nKluster nods, taking out his gun. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\nThe two Maximals run out of the room, heading for the exit.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Cybertronian Fire&#39;s computer acnouledges the attack, sicking the external \ndefences on the attackers. Two missile launchers each fire a signature \nseeking missile at Dark Lord, the autoguns continue firing at all three \nattackers, and the laser batteries let loose a few shots at Grim Reaper and \nRush.\n\n"}}
