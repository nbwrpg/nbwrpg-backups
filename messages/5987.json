Gangon looked in the mirror.\n\n&quot;Who is this?&quot; he asked. Dracona showed himit was a mirror. He realized he\nlooked different.\n\n&quot;Now nobody will reconize me.&quot; Gangon said. He transformed to beast mode, he\nlooked different there, too. He scurried outside of the base.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t follow me, I don&#39;t want to have anything to do with you, thanks for\nhelping me, but maybe you should have left me to die, now I don&#39;t know what\nI&#39;ll do. Dracona got this all the time back on Cybertron.\n\n&quot;Sure.&quot; She said. Gangon walked off. He seen BrightBlade suddenly! he walked\nup to it, transforming to robot mode. She disappeared. Gangon looked at a\nhologram machine. (I didn&#39;t control BrightBlade, it was a hologram.) Gangon\nlooked up and a vulture twice his size was staring him in the eyes. Gangon\nturned to run but felt a deep pain and fell. A knife stuck into his back. He\nhad just gotten healed and now he got this! Inzola snickered.\n\n&quot;This one will be good for spark doning! His spark can go into your healing\nmachine!&quot; Said the giant termite, Inzola.\n\n&quot;Yes! You have Lightmare&#39;s spark ready? It&#39;s time!&quot; Deemos said. Gangon\nscreamed as Deemos ripped his spark out. Deemos stuck it into a jar.\n\n&quot;Transmetal 2 style healing will be ours!&quot; Deemos said. Deemos and Inzola\nplaced the sparks into the machines they built, they were tiny devices.\n\n&quot;Now what?&quot; Inzola asked.\n\n&quot;Swallow them, they travel through you and afix to your spark!&quot; Deemos said.\nThey both swallowed the devices and they healing devices hooked onto their\nsparks and gave them the ability.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry about them, their sparks are helplessly floating, thay can&#39;t do\nnothing!&quot; Deemos said. Inzola nodded and they both leaned back and were\nhealed over 5 minutes, seeing as how their injuries were minute. They looked\nback at the Alliance base.\n\n&quot;I guess they don&#39;t want us.&quot; Inzola said.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll wait a bit longer.&quot; Deemos said.\n\n&quot;Hey, whomever is in charge, please come and judge us, we wish to join!&quot;\nDeemos called out...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, July 06, 2000 2:36 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt; She threw another rock into the air and shot at it.
