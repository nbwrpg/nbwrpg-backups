Techy took a step forward and went \nto follow Beserk at a safe distance. Sky Knight took a step back to \nBlazer&#39;s side.\n\n&quot;Coming around nicely,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s almost normal. But still, \nthings aren&#39;t all certain. We still don&#39;t know how he would react to \nthe public. Anyone he came in contact, he could try to kill.&quot; He \ncrossed his arms. &quot;I want to take him out, but I think I&#39;m just \njumping ahead. Beserk has a great curiosity. I like that. He&#39;s a fast \nlearner.&quot; He turned his face to Blazer. &quot;What do you think we should \ndo next? He trusts us like he&#39;s apart of our team.&quot; He lowered his \nhead thinking, then his crimson optics brightened. &quot;I got! Well, it \ncould be risky, and if something happens we would have to report it. \nI want to see him fight. I want to see if his skills still remain \nafter that operation.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nSlider sat on the couch of her and Eerie&#39;s barracks. They were \nroommates. Slider was a young Predacon, a fighter pilot. She had a \ngray coloring and a slim face. Errie was from a line of unknowns. She \nhad an accent and a wildside.\n\nShe sat watching the Cybertronian news on a monitor set up on the \nwall, while Eerie walked towards the sleeping area. She had returned \nhome with some damage and hungry. She had gone into two big busts in \none day with her bounty hunting team. She wanted to take a short nap \nto restore her energies.\n\nBut before she got to her sleeping area, she heard the name Beserk. \nAnd so did Shadow. Eerie spun around with her optics wide.\n\n&quot;What?&quot; she snapped.\n\nSlider stood up. &quot;Eerie.&quot; Eerie stepped to the metal couch&#39;s edge. \nThey both listened to the announcement:\n\n&quot;The team were happy to announce that the clone has made an excellent \nrecovery, and will be planned to be used against the Maximals. As far \nas is know about his original creators, they will be executed for \nconspiracy, murder, and use of a deadly weapon. Beserk on the other \nhand was given another chance...&quot;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; Eerie shouted. &quot;They can&#39;t do that! Ah killed that slaggin&#39; \nthing! Those sons of maintenance bots! They didn&#39;t even tell me! They \ncan&#39;t get away wit&#39; that! Ah&#39;ll kill them!&quot; She clentched her fists \nuntil they shook. &quot;So mah scanner wasn&#39;t goin&#39; haywire. Beserk is \nalive. Ah&#39;ll teach them bots uh thing or two!&quot;\n\n&quot;Hold up Eerie,&quot; Slider said and grabbed her arm before she took \noff. &quot;I know you. You&#39;re jus&#39; going to take off and track him down \nagain. You&#39;re get yourself kill. Maybe even arrested. Beserk might as \nwell be under secturity.&quot;\n\n&quot;He might break that security t&#39; get t&#39; me.&quot;\n\nSlider pulled on her. &quot;Wait. Maybe we should ask Shadow.&quot;\n\n&quot;She doesn&#39;t know anything! We jus&#39; found out! Ah&#39;m goin&#39; t&#39; find out \nwho th&#39; slag is behind this.&quot;\n\n&quot;They won&#39;t tell you anything,&quot; Slider said. &quot;I bet they see you as a \nthreat. I bet they know you want him dead and your going to bitch \nabout it.&quot;\n\nEerie looked at her and narrowed her crimson optics.\n\n\n"}}
