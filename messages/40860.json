He \nstruggles to stay standing and yells to his Autobots, &quot;If they are \nleaving, let them leave, we don&#39;t want to attract any unwanted \nattention.&quot; He goes to one knee, but slowly begins to recover.\n\nSwoop exits the base, and gains some altitude. He curves around \nand fires two missiles at Tremmor, then before he can fire another \nround, Pacifix&#39;s words hit him. Reluctantly, he heads over to \nGrimlock and remains airborn, circling around him. &quot;Me Swoop \nwant to crush Decepticons...&quot; \n\nAfterburner speeds out of the base, transforms and starts firing on \nCaliburst. &quot;I&#39;ll knock the idiot out of the sky.&quot; \n\nNosecone still hasn&#39;t gotten out of the base.\n\nScattershot runs out in time to here Pacifix&#39;s words, he motions for \nthe Technobots to ceasefire and return to base.\n\nCrossroads watches Grimlock but is reluctant to fire, he waits for \nPacifix to continue expecting someone to get a spy mission. He \ndoesn&#39;t know how Grimlock will react, but he expects the worst.\n\nPacifix doesn&#39;t dissapoint Crossroads. After recovering from the \ndestablizer, he gives new orders, &quot;Ok, sicne we&#39;ve been found, \nthere are new orders. Artemis, follow those two Decepticons to \ntheir base. As soon as you find their base, return to me and report. \nTechnobots, we need those base defenses up NOW. Grimlock, \nyou and your dinobots will be needed to make sure that the \nTechnobots get the defenses up quickly, and withough \nharrasement. Crossroads, you go with Grimlock. Repugnus, I want \nyou to hide on that mountain over there,&quot; He indicates one of the \nnortherly mountains surrounding the Autobot crash site, &quot;and act \nas a sentry until the base has been set up. Dion, watch the ship, \nand make sure that nothing sneaks in. Hoist is inside fixing the \nship&#39;s onboard computers and we need those up and running. JetV, \nare you ok?&quot; He quieries the damaged bot. Noticing Crotale&#39;s \nanxious looks, he consoles the bot, &quot;Don&#39;t worry Crotale you&#39;ll get \nyour chance later. Right now, you&#39;re with me, we&#39;re going to find \nout wha-- HEY!&quot; Pacifix spots Beachcomber and automaticly \nrecognizes him, for who is is. &quot;Beachcomber! We weren&#39;t sure if \nyou and your group were still here. Where are Firedrill and \nCliffjumper? Oh, nevermind,&quot; He says as he spots Cliffjumper. &quot;Are \nyou ok?&quot;\n\n\nooC: Note that those missiles in the episodes went into the water \nand didn&#39;t start already underwater at a significant depth.\n\nOn 23 Jul 2001, at 14:14, gunthers@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Crotale followed out behind Pacifix, eager to show his skill in \n&gt; battle.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Slag roared out right beside his dino bot leader. &quot;Lets burn them to\n&gt; shreds Grimlock. &quot;  He said shooting a blast of fire at Tremor.  \n&gt; \n&gt; JetV crouched behind a hill.  &quot;Aww, my back&quot; he said said, slowly\n&gt; taking out his rifle and shooting four blasts at Slugslinger.\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; \n&gt; Tremor looked at the bots coming out of hte ship. Not thinking \n&gt; about the odds he faced began shooting.  Firing fourblast of his\n&gt; Gyroscopic destabilizer at Pacifix, Artemis, Dion, and another stray\n&gt; shot whizzing at Slugslinger.  &quot;Die all of you , hhahaha&quot; he said as\n&gt; he fired his plasma rifle at the Technobots, one shot at each.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
