However as I sit here and read my mail, I see the group\n&gt; being polarized.  This deeply upsets me.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I did not know Minime well.  In fact I hardly, if ever interacted with\n&gt; him.  However we were instructed to remember him.  Do we honor this memory\nby\n&gt; arguing amongst ourselves?  Will we slowly drive the members of this group\n&gt; away until we run out of targets and turn against each other?  Or will we\n&gt; stop the senseless bickering, honor him with a day of silence, and\ncontinue\n&gt; on mourning and remembering in our own ways?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
