There \nwas far too much on her mind for cuddling now...though she wanted to now \nmore then ever.\nAnd at Klusters word of the Ark caving in, her spark sank even more and that \nlonely feeling seemed to grow an inch. In a sigh her shoulders sank, there \nwas so much to do in so little time.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
