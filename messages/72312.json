He then simply shrugs with his front\n&gt; haunches.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Excuse me, but that bone was in my way. &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe hooting and catcalling continued as TUSCON was led down the\nwalkways, if anyone noticed the bone breaking manuver, there was no\nvisible or audial sign of it.\n\nAs TUSCON moved he could see that there were aliens of different\ntypes, but also machine life forms as well. And it was towards these\nthat he was led, a large door parting to let them in. The guards that\nlet them in carefully kept their weapons on the ready as they passed\nthrough.\n\nGUILEDART stopped as he opened the last gate and gestured to TUSCON,\n&quot;This is where you will stay as you prepare for your battles.&quot; He\npointed for him to go inside. &quot;Your . . . &quot; He paused as if looking\nfor the proper word and then finally found one. &quot; . . . your trainer\nwill be inside.&quot;\n\nApproaching the gate from the other side was a large and imposing\nfigure of seemingly massive proportions. A few inches shorter than\nTUSCON himself he was thick at the shoulders and hips, huge horns of\nsome type jutting out.\n\nIt was the Maximal known as BIG CONVOY!\n\nA CONVOY!?!? The Convoy ranks higher than a Prime but less than a\nMagnus. There are very few Convoys, and they are considered to be flag\nrank and are typically used to assist the Magnus in his duties.\n\nBut what was BIG doing out here? Could this be one of the &#39;other&#39;\nreasons that LEO PRIME is out here, to look for BIG CONVOY, he was\nrumored to be a close friend of LIO CONVOY.\n\n&quot;Another one.&quot; He grumbled under his breath as he looked at TUSCON.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
