That energy, the=\r\n one commn&#39; from his chest...  I bet it can be channeled inta one bot from =\r\nthe other, via the chest port..  That power&#39;s tryn&#39; ta reach somethn&#39; and I=\r\n wonder if it&#39;s tryn&#39; ta reach Rodimus&#39;s core where his matrix was.&quot;\n\nBefor=\r\ne anyone could think, in his state of unconsciousness, Tucson extends his h=\r\nand out as far as he can, hoping that it will touch upon Rodimus&#39;s hand, ev=\r\nen if it were only his fingers.  He begins to talk in his sleep.\n\n&quot;Just - a=\r\n hand - a - way.  Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n\nHe fights hard to extend his arm f=\r\nar enough to attempt to feel Rodimus&#39;s hand.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca looked at Perceptor =\r\nfor a long moment, &quot;Yes.&quot; he said finally,\n&gt; speaking more to Kup than to P=\r\nerceptor. &quot;We shall wait for the repairs\n&gt; to be complete.&quot; He turned and l=\r\nooked at Kup and the others, &quot;Then we\n&gt; have many other things to discuss.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Bantor walked up the hall towards where Eilta and the others were\n&gt; s=\r\ntanding. looking at the repairs. It was becoming quite crowded in the\n&gt; obs=\r\nervation room, all these maximals crowded into it to watch the\n&gt; progress. =\r\nEven Lord Elder and Cheetor were watching, although they\n&gt; were simply moni=\r\ntoring it from the bridge of the ship rather than\n&gt; standing in the observa=\r\ntion room.
