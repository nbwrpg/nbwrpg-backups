I never \nactually said that he successfully did it. I put in\n&gt; &quot;He then Locks on the the Solar Flare and intesifyes it spout and \nDirects its  raw Force Towards Unicron&quot; Which means its raw force.\n&gt;  The Energy let off. That can be manipulated, Not the Flare \nitself. It is a Tech that almost anyone with training can do. In \nother words it is just the energy from the Flare. And I said that he \ndirected it to Unicron. In other words his target. He is taking \nenergy and Directing it towards Unicron. Now I did not say that I \nautomatically hit him. That is up to you guys to decide. But it \nchanges the Battle Field. It applies the use of energy to a new \nlevel. \n&gt;   And of this whole fighting thing. Well if you guys want to then \ni can resign. it is that simple. I Play Dungeons and Dragons so I \nknow the whole Psionics Class. It is the use of the mind and I know \nwhat the limits are.and if you remember in the post that I said &quot; I \njust want your assurence on me being born.&quot;  He is not in the \nBounderies of this univers yet. That is why he is getting a Remake. \nTurned from a Jet into a Beast warrior.thus giving him an physical \nessance in this world, Which would mean he needs to difuse his \nhigher powers to be brought in.

There&#39;s nothing to stop Primus from boosting\n&gt; his power temporarily, as I said, but then doing some\n&gt; internal damage as a result.  I know you guys are\n&gt; trying to avoid modding here, but at the end of the\n&gt; day, you can&#39;t have a realistic battle where two\n&gt; deities are actively involved without both deities\n&gt; manipulating things to their advantage. I&#39;m all for\n&gt; avoiding modding, but the thing is that here, if you\n&gt; take a black and white stance with it, you&#39;ll make\n&gt; this into a clash of the titans with kid gloves, which\n&gt; will just look and feel rediculous, and totally\n&gt; UNREALISIC. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; I don&#39;t sure, that will do the bot too powerfull, what\n&gt; do you think \n&gt; about that Azura and Robo?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Polar Claw\n&gt; &lt;cycodrone@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m not a GM but I couldn&#39;t help but noticing\n&gt; &gt; the thread.
