They must \ndestroy these\n&gt; &gt; two Minions qui=\r\nckly and go to the Black Fortress to aid the \nMaximal rescue team... \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd the Predacons. There was just one thing about Legacy&#39;s \nstatement that \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; took=A0over Elder&#39;s thoughts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elder: Corrupted Rodimus? What d=\r\no you mean? We thought that he \nand Nightlight\n&gt; &gt; were just being held cap=\r\ntive by the Predacons.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Legacy paused for a moment as he attempted t=\r\no put his historical \ninformation into succinct terms. &quot;THE AUTOBOT KNOWN A=\r\nS HOTROD, \nTHROUGH SOME UNKNOWN MEANS WAS RECONFIGURED INTO A BEING KNOWN A=\r\nS \nDARK RODIMUS.

With a coru=\r\nscating \nbeam of power he fired a radio wave blast at the duo, not attempti=\r\nng \nto destroy them in this maneuver, but to cut off communication&#39;s with \n=\r\nanyone else. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; ((OOC: I am not sure if anyone is familiar with Shock=\r\nblast =96 the \ncharacter Legacy is loosely based on, but he has the ability=\r\n to hack \ncommunications and shut off communications systems . . . among ot=\r\nher \nthings))\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Legacy)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
