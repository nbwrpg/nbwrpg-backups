He sees \nReptillica talking with a bot, and with close detail he sees that it \nwas Starscream, the bot that he had almost died with back at the Pred \ncave. No time to say hi. Gotron turned on his Jet pack and locked on \nto Dark One&#39;s position.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTamron and Savage\n\nStriker&#39;s missle deflects the microchip, making land on a small \niguana. It sinks into the skin, and becomes Tamron&#39;s slave. \nUnfortunatly it didn&#39;t last very long.\n\n&quot;Stupid lizard...&quot; Tamron stomps on it. He looks toward Sacage and \nStriker.\n\n&quot;Savage!! Let out all your anger on him! Kill him!&quot;\n\nSavage reached a new level of anger. He repeadidly swung his spiked \ntail and striker, hoping to pierce his body. Tamron turned back to \nthe other bots. 6 of them. But if he could bring one to his side.... \nHis thought was cut short as fire power hit his body, causing him to \nstumble. He had a grenade launcher in one hand and the Tamer in the \nother. He fired two greandes above all their heads and at The Ark, \nwhich caused a piece of the hull to collapse.\n\n&quot;I have a proposition! What I would personally like to do is just \nkill all of you and destroy The Ark. I don&#39;t care about time. Even if \nI didn&#39;t exist, it would be like me killing billions at once. But I \nwill leave, on one condition. I will withdraw Savage, leave The Ark \nalone and return to my base without killing any of ou, but.....One of \nyou must willfully take my micro-chip. Either that or have time \ndestroyed.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
