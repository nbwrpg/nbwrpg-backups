There was\na battle going on, he transformed back to his dragon mode and took flight\ntoward the battle. &quot;You Predacons are pathetic&quot;, he yelled broadcasting his\nvoice over the sounds of battle. His echoing voice resembled Megatrons\nvirtually exact, he spread his wings and blew a hurricane gust of wind\ntoward the battlefield to shake up the warriors. The great dragon breathed\ndeeply into his fire lung and spit towards Starscream. A fireball about four\nfoot in diameter hurtled toward the bot hot enough to incinerate it&#39;s\nengines. he swung his tail around at Tankor and EndBringer. &quot;Try not to\nscream to loudly as I destroy you all.&quot; Megaton had Megatrons cocky\npersonality but unlike his donor he had the power to back it up.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 13, 2000 9:27 PM\nSubject: Re: Battle in Antarctic\n\n\n&gt; Also, Megaton would be rolling boulders on no-one I think.\n&gt; EndBringer&#39;s group was engaged in combat with the ambushers, so they\n&gt; were on top of the mountain.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::EndBringer/Scyther/Demise::\n&gt;\n&gt; EndBringer smiles, jumping up as missiles destroy his &#39;padestral&#39;.
