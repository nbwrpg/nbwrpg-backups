Now his main goal is \n&gt; have\n&gt; their defences ready and working asap.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras hissed and said to Cyclonus&quot;No, we have to focus in stand in our\n&gt; position and make our faction stronger&quot; Hydras started to inspect his \n&gt; troops\n&gt; and asked to Cyclonus &quot;Any idea how to camuflage this base and made us...\n&gt; invibisible to enemie&#39;s detection? or do you suggest to have a better \n&gt; place\n&gt; where set a Fortress?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCYCLONUS turned to DEEPSRYKE first and gestured to him to dismiss the\ntroops. With the inspection over there was no need for them to be here\nto listen to all thier plans.\n\n&quot;Group dismissed!&quot; DEEPSTRYKE said in a firm military voice. and with\nthat the other Predacons broke ranks and began to move away from the\narea, most having other missions to perform.\n\nTurning back to HYDRAS there was a thoughtful look on CYCLONUS&#39;s face.\n&quot;This base can be as good as any other. But you have not told me what\nyou plan to do. I can better advise you if I know what you needed. I\nam not sure what you need.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
