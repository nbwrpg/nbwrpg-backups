By the time the quake reached the chivtron base,\n&gt; Starstomp was getting on the verge of getting to stasis lock. She needed\n&gt; help and fast. Since she was not used to her beast mode, she transformed \n&gt; and\n&gt; tried to see the status of the CR chamber. It was no use, though, \n&gt; because it\n&gt; was totally out of function for regenerative uses. Again she needed help \n&gt; and\n&gt; she needed it so slaggin fast!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Starstomp:\n&gt; I am the cybertronian named Starstomp and I request urgent assistance. To\n&gt; any sentient entities that are situated to the west of my position, please\n&gt; comply as fast as possible. I am currently bordering stasis lock and I am\n&gt; completely willing to help you!! Please assist!!!\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
