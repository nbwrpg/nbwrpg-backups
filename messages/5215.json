You shouldn&#39;t have gone, everything was under \ncontrol. But no matter,&quot; Magmatron said. &quot;You still need to be Destroned. To \nthe lab, that&#39;s an order.&quot;\n    Soon they were in the lab.\n    &quot;Maybe I should program you into listening to orders. But I&#39;m not going \nto.&quot; Magmatron said. Bobertron was now strapped to the table with triple \nreinforced adamantium (X-Men joke there) straps. There was no way he could \nget up. &quot;This will happen tonight, I am tired of you running around as a \nPredacon, you need to be a Destron, so just sit back and relax.&quot;\n    Magmatron began the process of changing Bobertron into a Destron. He \nwasn&#39;t going let him slip through his fingers again. Soon it was time for \nMagmatron to enter the DNA, but the Megalodon DNA was destroyed in the other \nlab. So he used a DNA from something he found. A hawk. Looking it up in the \nhistory records it was called a Red Tailed Hawk. He began grafting it onto \nBobertron. Soon there was nothing left of the Mosesaur and he was all Hawk. \nNow it was time to enter the final stage, Transmetal 2. This time he was \nready for the surge, it worked completely, his lab was in perfect working \norder and Bobertron was a new bot. He had the ability to cloak for a limited \nperiod of time and some other nifty features.\n    \n\n"}}
