Raising a pincher, cloaking quickly, he fired a regular missile off\nup\n&gt; at Sixshot, who was in the process of strafing once more.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee charged out of his quarters, raising both stinger missile\n&gt; launchers.  &quot;Hmmm...maybe I should sit this one out...&quot; he said to\nhimself,\n&gt; walking instead of running to an exit to the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===========\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer walked into the bridge of the Alliance base, waiting.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Each Oblitercon got out of a CR chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One looked around.  &lt;Zardus, where is my payment of 200 kilos of\nenergon\n&gt; located?  I wish to collect my payments&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ==========\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot opened fire, lasers tearing up Double Punch&#39;s incoming missile,\n&gt; causing it to explode before it hit it&#39;s intended target.  Sixshot\nchuckled.\n&gt; &quot;A cloaking device...to bad it won&#39;t do much good!&quot; he laughed, firing two\n&gt; missiles at where he had saw the missile eminate from.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron grunted as autogun fire hit him, firing two missiles into the\ncrowd\n&gt; of Predacons Marine was leading.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch yelled, two missiles sending him slamming back through the\nair,\n&gt; slamming into the hull of the Predacon ship, his cloaking device down,\n&gt; himself sliding to the ground unconsciouss.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Koga Shuko took out his missile launcher, firing an optic blast at an\n&gt; autogun, as autogunf ire bounced off his heavy armor, leaving scratches.\nHe\n&gt; fired off a rocket at the middle of the parade of advancing Predacons\nMarine\n&gt; was leading.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Anubis took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at the crowd of\n&gt; angry as hell looking Predacons.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Hades raised his laser rifle, firing three bolts, each at a seperate\nautogun.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor raised his plasma launcher, firing a powerful plasma blast off\nat a\n&gt; group of autoguns.  &quot;Myah, where&#39;s your Messiah now you backstabbing\npieces\n&gt; of slag!  This&#39;ll teach you to double cross me!&quot; Serpentor yelled, firing\nan\n&gt; optic blast off at the Predacon base.\n&gt;\n&gt; =========\n&gt;\n&gt; Beachcomber gently pushed Smokescreen off of him.  Getting to his feet\nwith a\n&gt; limp, he looked at his arm and yelped.  It was what the humans would call:\n&quot;a\n&gt; dislocated shoulder&quot;.  Or, at least a dislocated right shoulder.  &quot;Slag!&quot;\n&gt; Smokescreen yelled.  &quot;Hey...lady!&quot; he yelled to Fidget.  &quot;Give me a hand\nwith\n&gt; this guy.  I...can&#39;t use one of mine.&quot; he said, smiling slightly, gripping\n&gt; Smokescreen by the head, his palm gripping on the back of the fellow\n&gt; Maximal&#39;s head.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramhorn shook his head, waking up.  He had fallen asleep.  Slag waiting\nfor\n&gt; Plintissa!  Everything was going the Inferno!  The base was dead.  It\nmight\n&gt; be better just to sell it and buy a new one!  Of course...that was\n&gt; impossible...it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea if that ship&#39;s destruction wouldn&#39;t\n\n&gt; lead to the eventual destruction of Cybertron itself!\n&gt; &quot;Ramhorn...beast...mode.&quot; going to rhino mode, Ramhorn slowly (and I mean\n&gt; slowly) headed for the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Sign up for the free zZounds.com newsletter for the latest and\n&gt; greatest music gear savings, musician tips and hot contests.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3738/13/_/_/_/961928613/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
