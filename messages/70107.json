Of the three he was the\nmost physically massive, and seemingly riddled with weaponry. Four\ncannons sat on his broad shoulders as well as a rather large rifle\nthat he held easily in his hand. He was armor was thick and well\narticulated, hued in gray and red.\n\nThe second one was colored almost completely in black, with only deep\npurples and blues to break the rhythm. He was obviously a jet of some\ntype, looking almost like a remodeled seeker of some sort, he had\npatches of red on his wings that looked something like radar dishes.\nAlso his build was also much slimmer, his movements were also more\ngraceful and smooth, almost catlike as he walked and looked about.\n\nThe last one was a female, the only one of the trio. She was\npredominantly red and white, although there were traces of black along\nher shoulders and hips and legs. From the cockpit that helped form her\nchest, she was most likely a jet of some type, although the lack of\nobvious wings made the specific type not easy to determine. As she\nwalked into the room, her movements were crafty, observant, and in\ntheir own unique way seductive.\n\n&quot;Ahh Cyclonus.&quot; said the female, &quot;It has been so long since we have\nseen you.&quot; she said as she smiled at him as she looked him up and\ndown. She turned to look at Nightlight, &quot;And who is this?&quot; she said as\nshe crossed her arms over her chest.\n\nCyclonus only smiled coldly as he turned slightly to Nightlight, &quot;Lady\nNightlight&quot; he said gallantly, &quot;I would like you to meet Deepstryke.&quot;\nhe said pointing the larges of the three, the one with all the\nweaponry. &quot;And there is Nightrazor.&quot; Cyclonus said as he gestured to\nthe dark of the three. &quot;And the last here in all her glory is Phobia&quot;\n\nAt that point Phobia smiled sweetly as she continued to look\nNightlight up and down.\n\n&quot;And where is this Hydras?&quot; Nightrazer said, his voice hardly a\nwhisper as he talked.\n\nCyclonus gestured for them to step further into the throne room, &quot;He\nwill be here momentarily Cyclonus said, &quot;For the moment make your\nselves comfortable.&quot;\n\nEven as Cyclonus spoke he keyed a message to Hydras that the allies\nhad arrived in the throne room.\n\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
