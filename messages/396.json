He looked back at the \nArk and growled softly...*\n\n&quot; Perhaps.&quot;\n\n* The way that Tavatron looked at him was unnerving, she was trying to find \nsomething more then a warrior in him but there was nothing more to find. \nDinobot looked at the Ark but was lost in thoughts, he was a warrior and \nthat was all. There was no secret life, no bots that cared for him and no \nbots that he cared for, no excitement, nothing...but a warrior.\nOne who fought and protected...one who devoted his life to fight a war that \nseemed to have no end.\nIt may seem sad in a way but that was what he was, a soldier.\nPerhaps... one day he would find that he was something more?\nOne day.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
