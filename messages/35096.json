We&#39;ll see about that.&quot;  He uses the computer to take\na\n&gt; look at the program creating and controlling the shielding codes.\n&gt; &quot;Interesting work, I&#39;m almost impressed.&quot;  He then sets about a flurry of\n&gt; programing to duplicate the program.  It didn&#39;t take very long because he\nhad\n&gt; a template by looking at Grounded&#39;s program.  He then created four codes.\nHe\n&gt; connected himself to the computer and downloaded one code.  With that done\nhe\n&gt; sets up a fire wall so that only he can get at this new program.  He opens\na\n&gt; tight band com to Aerotaur, Perplex, and Windlord.  &quot;Please come to my\n&gt; position.&quot;  He was going to offer a code to Nightlight but he had seen her\n&gt; receive one from Grounded.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
