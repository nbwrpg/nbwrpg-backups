&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My orders will depends of the troops that are in good shape&quot; said Hydras\n&gt; whiloe he watched all the rebuilt that it must be done before to that \n&gt; place\n&gt; was fully fuctional &quot;Priorities, you know.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCYCLONUS nodded as he walked with his commander. �At the moment all\nunits have reported functional and ready.� CYCLONUS looked over at\nHYDRAS, �That is everyone except Terrorsaur. We have not been able to\nlocate him.�\n\nContinuing to walk in silence for a moment, CYCLONUS broke it as\nanother part of the update came to him, �Our examination of the battle\nwe were picking up on scanners was inconclusive. By the time our\nforces arrived there was nothing left to find. No bodies and no real\nevidence except for the damage done to the foliage and such. However\nthere was some sort of alien presence there, as well as Unicronian.�\nCYCLONUS pursed his lips thoughtfully, �And one of the sweeps believes\nthat he detected a single Predacon signature.�\n\nAs HYDRAS and CYCLONUS walked, the work on the base was becoming more\nand more evident. Lights and power appeared to be all over the ship.\nDoors easily responded to their presence, chirping once as it\nidentified their predacon signature and noted their name and rank. The\nholes in the walls were no longer present, and that smell of smoke and\ncharred parts was noticeably absent.\n\nThey came to a stop to the doors of the hanger bay, through the doors\nHYDRAS could see all nearly all of the soldiers in there next room,\nmilling around. DEEPSTRYKE was standing to the front keeping an optic\non things as BLACKRAZOR and PHOBIA both watched from the sides.\n\nBehind them stood nearly the rest of the crew: INSECTICON, BRUTICUS-X\n, IGUANUS stood together while TARANTULUS stood next to FRACTYL\nwhispering something sly into his ear. INFERNO kept glancing at the\ndoor as if waiting for HYDRAS to appear.\n\nIn another section the Fuzors stood. SKYSHADOW their leader and\nINJECTOR, BUZZCLAW, TERRORGATOR,  and QUICKSTRIKE. Standing in the\nmiddle of it all stood WASPINATOR he looked somewhat alone without\nTERRASAUR there to talk to.\n\nCYCLONUS looked at HYDRAS, �I have Scourge in the security section\nkeeping watch on our external defenses and the three remaining sweep\nare flying perimeter watch. Other than that all of your soldiers are\nhere.�\n\nGesturing at the door CYCLONUS nodded, �After you sir.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
