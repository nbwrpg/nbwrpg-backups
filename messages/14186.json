She \nknealed\n&gt; &gt; down to say a prayer to the Matrix.  She opened her \nlink. &quot;Drillbit.\n&gt; &gt; Just incase stiff happenes, I love you. And Drillbit&#39;s in charge,\n&gt; &gt; just in case.&quot;  She closed her link and prayed again.  She got up \nand\n&gt; &gt; aimed her rifle at the Chosen ones and the new comers.
