They let loose random \nshots, mostly at the lavacins, and a few at Starscream.\n    &quot;Royalty! The invaders have spotted us and opened fire! And there \nreinforcements are on the way!&quot; Inferno cried, and the looked to see one of \nthe blue clones burst in an eruption of fire. That was one soldier dead.\n\n    Megatron laughed, &quot;Inferno, keep them busy. We have other plans....yes.&quot; \nHe said and then broke the connection before a trace could be done. \nWaspinator laughed to as they glanced over to the table and saw the clone of \nMegatron leap up in pure fustration.\n    &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; The clone barked, just like Megatron. He \nwas a replica of the tyrant...except for his blue eyes. That damn \npigmintation was a hard problem to solve. With the slaming of his body, he \nhad broken the cloning data input. That was the end of the clones......\n    Megatron smiled, &quot;You have a mission to do. Once they kill you they wont \nworry about me anymore. Youre my scapegoat.&quot; He then pointed to a control \nthat Waspinator held. The insect pushed it and the clone went into a zombie \nlike state.\n    &quot;Now....go to the battle and relive Inferno and the remaining clones. \nYou, on the other hand, are to fight until your certian death. Understood?&quot; \nHe commanded, and the clone gave a blank nod, turned, and exited.\n    &quot;Excellent. Good thing we cloned Inferno first, I think a large blue \nclone of myself would give my plan away a bit to quickly.&quot; Megatron laughed. \nHe then turned to the broken cloning station and sighed. It was good while it \nlasted. This last ditch effort should prove effective, well, it would have to \nbe because he couldnt clone anymore.\n\n"}}
