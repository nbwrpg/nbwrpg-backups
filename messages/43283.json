Quickly accessing a computer\n&gt; &gt; terminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still\n&gt; &gt; trapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around \nhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; soon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
