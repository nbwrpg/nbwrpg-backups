In fact, he felt \nsorry for his older brother. His life had never been fair from the \nbeginning.\nBu8t now he was searching for Von, wanting to see him and perhaps get to \nknow the never brother he knew nothing about.\nVons last know location: Prehistoric Earth.\n\nBut this young man searching for his older half-brother had his own name, \none, which his mother said suited him well. His name was Vlad.\nThe pampered out of the two offspring.\nBut Vlad had other reasons besides a family reunion in order to find his \nbrother. Their mother had passed away less then 6 months prior to the \npresent and, surprisingly, left every piece of property to Von.\nSo, now Vlad, was left to locate his brother and supposedly inform him of \neverything which had happened. If Von was still alive. And if he was�Vlad \nwas sure he wouldn�t be for much longer.\nFrom what his mother had told him, Von was weak in mind and both spirit�a \nvery easy target if he wasn�t careful.\nThere had been no further reports on him after he had disappeared on \nPrehistoric Earth and only the Matrix knew if he was alive. And if he \nwasn�t, Vlad snickered, everything would go to himself!\n\nVlads personally owner Predacon StarHopper closed in on the time deplaced \ndimensional rift, which led to Prehistoric Earth, thinking of his actions \ntowards his brother if indeed he was alive.\nVlad couldn�t just keep what his mother had legally signs off as Vons, he \ndidn�t want to get in slag with the law.\nBut if he had proof that Von was dead, if he was, then everything was his by \nthe law. However, if Von was indeed alive then he would have to resort to \nanother way of getting what he wanted. As in returning with Vons death \ncertificate.\nBut for legal matters he wouldn�t do it himself, no. He would pay another or \neven a few others to snuff out Von for him.\nVlad knew that there were other bots on earth, he just needed to offer the \nright price to get what he wanted. As in ionized Energon. A perfect drug or \na very expensive and profitable  selling pieces.\n\nThe rift came closer and Vlad shifted the craft to autopilot, sitting back \nin the chair of the cockpit.\nAll he had to do was ride it out until he entered earth�s solar system, \nland, find the nearest Predacon faction, pay his assassin, and sit back to \nwait until he either brought back Vons badly decomposed body to prove he had \ndied, or freshly severed head�.\nVlad licked his lips as he leaned his head on his hand, being a Predacon was \nwonderful.\nA large dog/wolf-like creature resting it�s huge head on the armrest, \nwhining. Vlad knew it had never liked space travel, having the mutt ever \nsince he couldn�t remember.\n\nThe StarHopper entered slowly into the rift, eventually disappearing into \nits depths. Knocking out all of the ships systems as well as Vlad and his \nanimal.\nThe edge of the rift shimmering for a moment before settling, leaving it to \nlook as if no ship had ever passed through.\nLeaving nothing but the silence of space.\nThe hunt was on!**\n\n(20 min later)\n\n** The rift opened on the other side, spewing out the Predacon StarHopper, \nthe ship turning on its axes and sparking.\nThe force from being ejected from the rift sent the small ship sailing \ntowards Earth, shaking it nearly to pieces before there was a violent shake \nas it struck the atmosphere.\nThrowing the unconscious Vlad against the window as the ship�s outer hull \nturned into a large fireball, finally breaking the atmosphere and beginning \nits decent towards the ocean. The Alliance base less then 2 clicks away.**\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
