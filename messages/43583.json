We&#39;ve gone back in time.\n\nMustex desperately trys to get the life support systems back up.  He \nknows this things only chance is either to have his or Stallex&#39;s DNA \nscanners implanted (remember all bots have them built in since &quot;Beast \nMachines&quot;) or to live long enough to get back.  The only major peice \nof machinery around is the Shuttle.  Then he remembers the \nhover-cycles.\n\nMustex:  STALLEX!

It was an old capsule, about from the \n&gt; Great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; War. It entered the atmosphere, fire surrounding it. It went \ndown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about in central africa. The robot inside was still alive, but \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy would be out in just a few cycle. The capsule&#39;s computer \n&gt; sent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out a distress signal.\n\n\n"}}
