He then tosses Megatron back, and is hit in the back by Cutthroat.\nAs he falls to his stomach, the seecond blast hits Megatron, sending him\ndown too. For a moment no one moves.\n\nSpeedbreaker arrives back at base with Stratus, and lets him go on the\nground. &quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot; he questions, asking Dead End.\n\nMegatron then stirs, and is met by a fist from Motormaster. Grinding of the\nmetal fist against his jaw fills his audio modules, and pain fills his\nsensory receptors. Motormaster was always strong, he thought, but not\nMegatron. As he finished his thought, he sent his fist, plunging it into\nMotormaster. Motormaster&#39;s armor buckled under the raw power of the fist,\nand indented, and when he recovered Megatron was on his feet. Megatron\nmoved in, and locked Motormasters hands. They pushed back and forth,\nMotormaster teetering on the edge of the cliff. He then pushed back, and\nthey moved back from the cliff.\n\nMegatron wanted to finish this now, and put all his power into another\npush, the circuitry in both warriors hands crackled. Megatron freed one\nhand from the death grip, and send it into Motormasters face. The impact\nsent Motormaster backwards, and he slipped on the edge of the cliff,\nloosing his balance. Before he could fall, Megatron grabbed him by the\nshoulder. &quot;This ends now Motormaster&quot; he snarled, and sent one last fist\ninto Motormaster, and gravity pulled him down the cliff.\n\nHe picked up speed, and then hit a jagged rock at the bottom hard, and\nstopped moving. Megatron smiled, he hadnt felt battle in a long while, and\nenjoyed the strong fight against Motormaster.\n\n\n\n"}}
