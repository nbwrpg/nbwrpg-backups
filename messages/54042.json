Her body and her spark lay there, thought to \nbe lost somewhere in time.  But her spark was not to be forgotten.  \nHer optics fluttered and flashed as her spark was awakening again.  \nThe exposed wires in her shoulder sparked as her body lay there.  \nHer hand moved.  Her body shuttered and she cried out from under the \nrubble.  Her body resisted at first. But with the sheer will to \nlive, she started to make her way back up to the earth&#39;s surface.  \nHer hand broke ground and she could feel air movement.  Her optics \nsaw the sun and she screemed out at seeing the sun for the first \ntime in ages.  She climed up and stood on her feet once again.  \nThen, with a pained cry, she fell to her hands and knees.  Her body \ncovered in rust. Only patches of dull black were the only hint of \nher once glistening black body.    She fell and laid on the ground, \ntrembling.  Her power level was extremely low and would not last \nlong.  She opened her forearm compartment and activated a general \ndistress signal.  She prayed that somebot would find her in time.  \nHer insignia had rusted off.  Her should was still sparking from the \nexposed wires.  She looked like the pit and felt like it too.  She \ndidn&#39;t even think she had enough energy to transform into wolf \nmode.  She only hoped she would be found in time. \n\n\n"}}
