What waited for them was a \ngreat orb that was flashing pictures, They put there hands to it and saw what \nHerald had seen so long ago:::\n\n    a battle, Every spark on Earth was there, Mech fluid and bodies folded \nthe valley. The many Factions fought senselessly. Defection was in the mid \ntrying desperately to stop it all, DataStreaks body lay fallen and crumpled \nin the rising pool of mech. They looked to the sky and saw Countless angles \nBattling there was Heraldangle singing a song of peace that was nearly \ndrowned out by the bloodlust cries of the innocent falling and the untruthful \nprevailing then an explosion, defection had sacrificed himself for Hot \nRod.They saw Gigatron Fighting to get to defection and then seeing his corps. \nherald had just put himself in front of one of ArcAngles FireBalls saving \nProwls life.ArcAngle, In all of his glory had lost someone close to him. then \nall were dead, the Iliad of the bots had ended in complete and utter death. \nData Defection  and Herald Suddenly froze for 2 days. \n\n"}}
