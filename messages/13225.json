But, at least before she was able to move, not she \nfound that she couldn&#39;t.\nHer eyes flittered open to mere slits but she had to blink, the light of the \nneon lights overhead a bit too bright for her. Her bat senses reeling.\nSlag! What she would give for the warm caress of the dark.\nDesmonus tried to bring her hand up to her face to shield her sensitive \noptics with her hand but it wouldn&#39;t move, wondering if it was just her \nweakness that was causing this.\nBut something also felt strange, something just didn&#39;t seem right.\nIt was almost as if she had more programming in place of the bit that she \nhad lost in the crash to this strange place, it was there but not quite \nfinished.\nWith a weak sigh she closed her eyes to shield them from the light, so \nconfused at what was going on.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
