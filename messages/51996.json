They&#39;ve all seen things \nmuch scarier than an attacking tree-creature, regardless of its size.\n\nGatara, the closest Rogue (also the biggest), sees one tree headed \nfor her own noggin, but knocks it aside with a fist and squeezes both \ntriggers on her weapon, sending both a hail of magnum bullets and a \ngrenade at this ferocious enemy.\n\nDevilcat steps forward, allowing the falling timbers to bounce \nharmlessly off his force shield.  Then he retaliates with several \nenergy bursts from his laser sword.\n\nJayde yelps and scrambles back, looking for an opening to bring her \nown nailgun to bear.  Torin, Riekan, and Fury are out of reach for \nYggdrasil&#39;s initial attack, but they fight back anyhow: Torin fires \nhis plasma blaster, Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and Fury \n(after transforming) opens up with his cybervenom gun.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Seeing Gatara&#39;s gun pointing at him, Yggdrasil is taken between not \n&gt; moving and seeming like any other tree or moving and opening fire. \nHe \n&gt; can&#39;t exactly seem like any other tree because the shots will \nreveal \n&gt; that he has metal plates all over.\n&gt; \n&gt; Slag, he thought, they got me now...\n&gt; \n&gt; Unless...\n&gt; \n&gt; The huge tree moved.

He roared.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil planned to act on intimidation. Since his beast mode was \n&gt; bigger than his robot mode, and that he was 13 ft tall as a robot, \nit \n&gt; would be achievable. But he wanted to add some effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; He swung his arms around, breaking the other trees nearby and \nsending \n&gt; those tumbling down either in front of him or directly at the \nRogues.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, some of Gatara&#39;s shots had hit, but they had done no \nmore \n&gt; than light armor damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I want them converted to jamming beacons, then we&#39;ll place them \nat \n&gt; &gt; strategic points to knock out all enemy communications and sensor \n&gt; &gt; scans,&quot; Devilcat explains.  &quot;Right now, though, we have to \nresolve \n&gt; &gt; some border troubles of our own.

Gatara, take two steps to \n&gt; &gt; your left, turn around, and start shooting.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gatara blinks, then follows the suggestion - which puts Yggdrasil \n&gt; &gt; dead center in her crosshairs when she pulls the trigger on her \n&gt; &gt; machine gun!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t move, the huge tree bot thought to himself.
