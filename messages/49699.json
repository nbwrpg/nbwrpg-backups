The ship is \nabout the size of two cars.  It has a slight white/gray tint to it \nwith black windows.  It slowly moves towards the third planet from \nthe sun.  The planet is mostly Blue with a couple masses of green.  \nThe ship starts to shake as it enters the atmosphere.  \n\n   Inside the ship sits one bot behind the controls of the ship.  The \nbot can not be reconized because there is a shadow over him.  The \nshaking get even worse as the bot&#39;s right arm quickly reaches over to \nthe right as his yellow with black dotted arm flicks a switch.\n\n   The ship doesn&#39;t stop shaking as it gets closer and closer to \nearth.  All of a sudden the engine blows as flames are thrown from \nthe back of the ship.  The bot in the inside of the ship starts to \npunch the button he just touched.  A firey streak can be seen in the \nsky as the ship crash lands About 155 miles south of the maximal base.\n\nOOC: Sorry if it sucks first post in the past may months also with no \ncreated jucies flowing.\n\n\n"}}
