(if he gave you his permisison then no problem).  The\n&gt; minion\n&gt; base is a rumor and a mystery so far.  No action has taken place\n&gt; there.  I\n&gt; think it would be better if you let Nic introduce it since he created\n&gt; it.\n&gt; By the way, anyone can create minions, you don&#39;t necessarily have\n&gt; exclusive\n&gt; control over the minions, and it wouldn&#39;t be a problem for Nic to\n&gt; simultaneously play minions and someone attacking minions.  Those are\n&gt; just\n&gt; my thoughts.\n\nIn message 67223 Nic said &#39;Vorpal is a major NPC. I have no trouble\nabout someone else\ncontrolling him.&#39; So I am taking just taking temporary control. If Nic\nwants him then he is his to take at his leasure. Which is why I was\nasking all the questions.\n\n  \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
