The hull to the Maximal ship cracked and split \nlarge enough to allow the Predacons through. Marine, who made the shot, ran \nthrough first, followed by Inferno, and the burnt and smoking Rampage. :::\n\n::: Marine on comm to Hell Beast ::: Commander, we have made it into the \nMaximal base! We are victorious!\n\n::: Inferno and Ramapge sleeked through the corridor they were in, \nremembering the internal defense systems from last time. It was hard to walk \nbecause of all the firing from outside, but Inferno stumbled into a room \ncontaining CR chambers. :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: Hah! They wont be needing these any more!\n\n::: He sent a series of fire balls into the chambers, filling the room with \nfire and smoke which started to spread. :::\n\n::: Rampage ::: You fool! The ship is on fire!\n\n::: Inferno ::: It shall BURN!\n\n::: Rampage shighed and continued onward until the threesome came up to a \nheavy door :::\n\n::: Marine ::: This must be the bridge. Once we get inside....\n\n::: He stopped short with a large smile. Once inside they could take the ship \nfor real. It would be theres to control. :::\n\n"}}
