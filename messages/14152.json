She drew her rifle and pointed it at\n&gt; him.  &quot;Now, get out of my way.  Go inside the base and we will\n&gt; discuss this later.  If you kill me, you are no better than those\n&gt; maximals who had killed Time Bomb for the sport and were goint to put\n&gt; Land Mine through the most unspeakable tortures a bot could go\n&gt; through.  Now GO! NOW!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She got to her feet and walked towards the maximals.  They were more\n&gt; of them now than there were at the start of the fight.  She knealed\n&gt; down to say a prayer to the Matrix.  She opened her link. &quot;Drillbit.\n&gt; Just incase stiff happenes, I love you. And Drillbit&#39;s in charge,\n&gt; just in case.&quot;  She closed her link and prayed again.  She got up and\n&gt; aimed her rifle at the Chosen ones and the new comers.  She opened\n&gt; fire with everything she had.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
