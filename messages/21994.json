Let&#39;s make this a little better: Windlord, Nightlight, \nPerplex, \n&gt; and Termitron are far away from the ship near some caves.  Trinity, \nZeni, \n&gt; Gramps, Deemos, and Aerotaur are at the ship.  I know there are \nsome \n&gt; inconsistencies but if we leave them where they are now it will be \nless of a \n&gt; pain.
