Jagged however stumbles, and\nthen trips over Apeface as he lands face first, in stasis lock.\n\nApeface also falls over, trying to grab something to stabalize, but\nfails as he falls onto his back, transforming to ape mode, as his head\ndetaches, and transforms into a little robot, backflipping and landing.\nSpasma then turns towards the post Hook left empty. As a scientist he\nwas over curious at what was happening. He leapt up onto the chair, but\nsince he couldnt see, he then leapt to the consol, and looked at the\nreadings. &quot;Sir, this isn&#39;t good, as it is our ship may stall, in\nouterspace.&quot; He says in a worried tone.\n\n"}}
