Had to write fast.\n\n* Iron Raptor simply watches as Shadow moves up and out of her range, almost \nwishing that she knew how to use those two wings which were nestled inside \nof her back.\nBut she couldn&#39;t and so far the sword was all she knew of the weapons she \ncarried.\nBut seeing the grenade she didn&#39;t panic, already knowing that Prowl was on \nit. Watching the explosion in the air instead of at her feet.\nHer sword arem relaxing until the tip of the blade came to rest on the \nground, her eyes still on the sky.*\n\n&lt; I&#39;m fine.&gt;\n\n* She answered, still looking towards the retreating Shadow as he moved on.\nSo much for testing her body out. There was still so much she didn&#39;t know \nabout it.\nIron Raptor lowered her head from the clouds and turned it towards Prowl as \nhe walked up to her, simply looking at him through the slits of her visor on \nher helm, seeing Firearm pull up and then transform.\nDid he even recognize her? Probably.\nIron Raptor gave Firearm an absentminded wave before turning her attentions \nback towrds Prowl.*\n\n&lt; Why did Kluster call a meeting, is it because of the threat from the \nPredacons of attack?&gt;\n\n* She was ready to go, yes. But she wanted a few questions answered first.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
