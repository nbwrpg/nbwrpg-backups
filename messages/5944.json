I like that one.  It fits them to a tee. You \nknow, I wonder, are they really as good as they talk about, or just \nblowing hot air?&quot; She chuckled, &quot;enought hot air to lift a ship off \nthe ground.&quot;  She laughed.  Those two were abnoxious.\nShe liked Quictstrike.  She saw him as a mentor more than anything \nelse.  She figured she could learn a thing or three from him.  If \nwolves were good a one thing, learning was at the top of her list.  \nShe was a fast learner.  She figured the more she hung out with him, \nthe better she could be.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike chuckled at KitKat. &quot;Maybe yer right.&quot; He leaned back \nand \n&gt; watched as she threw up another rock and fired at it. Now it was \nhis turn. \n&gt; He wasn&#39;t that into it. After she threw another into the air, he \nwaited \n&gt; until it was a few inches from the ground, then he fired. The rock \nsplit \n&gt; into two, and pieces shattered from the side as they both hit the \nground. It \n&gt; wasn&#39;t his best, but it wasn&#39;t a real enemy. He was used to \nfighting with \n&gt; other bots, even to spar with.\n&gt; \n&gt; He wanted to do something to entertain himself. KitKat kept him \noccupied. At \n&gt; least she tried for conversation. He grin appeared on his mouth \nplate. &quot;Ah \n&gt; gotta idea, let&#39; give Sinester and Sinesis uh nickname. Ah&#39;m \nbettin&#39; on Dumb \n&gt; and Dumber.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
