Soon, a \nencrypted signal on the Maximal frequency starts coming from the \ntop of a mountain in the Rockies: \n# Maximals, I am Lynxiz and I am in need of assistance. I am not \nsure where I am othat than a mountain. You should be able to \nlocate me with your computers with the location. # \n&quot;Now I will wait.&quot; She finishes.\n\n"}}
