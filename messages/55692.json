She smiled and said &quot;You should \nbetter \n&gt; &gt; keep  your strengt&quot;said firmly but with a polite tone &quot;I&#39;m not a \n&gt; &gt; treat, I&#39;m a Predacon as you, I&#39;m Blackstorm... I&#39;m Perceptor&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; assistant&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima only gazed at Blackstorm. She never knew Blackstorm as the \nAutobot \n&gt; Nightlight. But there was still something about Blackstorm that \nmade her \n&gt; uneasy. For the time being. Of course, Maxima was leery of many \nuntil she \n&gt; knew them. That&#39;s just the way she was. Functioning for many \nmillenia, one \n&gt; had to watch their back to survive. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics slightly dimmed. Bording unconsciousness once more. The \nhealing \n&gt; was not working. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maxima struggled with what energy she had. Sitting up, she removed \nherself \n&gt; weakly & slowly from the CR.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Leaning against the CR, she looked up at Blackstorm. &quot;Where is... \nPerceptor?&quot; \n&gt; she breathed hoarsely.\n\n\n"}}
