You know that is the only thing that can remind me of the pleasure \n&gt; &gt;of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piloting since I have been reformatted. How are you, Mel?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She frowned slightly as he used her nickname. He surely knew about what \n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had done to her... She would not forget, though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Melchana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fine... but you know me... I could use a fight...
