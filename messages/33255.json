He stumbled back quite far actually, 5 \nsteps\n&gt; &gt;   is kinda far for a gestalt to stumble back from a normal \nheighted\n&gt; &gt;   warrior&#39;s perspective.  Abominus snarled meanly at Galaxor, then\n&gt; &gt;   fired 2 beams from the lazer from his lower chest.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;        Surgital heard the lightning bolt, and quickly turned \naround\n&gt; &gt;   and side-stepped just in time to avoid the lightning bolt by a \nspeck\n&gt; &gt;   or two.  Then, Surgital converted his hand into a saw blade \nagain,\n&gt; &gt;   and this time shot the saw blade at Lavatron&#39;s head.  (BTW, the \nblade\n&gt; &gt;   was shot vertical, so moving to the side gives a better chance \nof\n&gt; &gt;   dodging it.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
