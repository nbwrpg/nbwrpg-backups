Believe it or not I&#39;ve often\n&gt; defended such losing causes as evolution in the name\n&gt; of partial creationism (it means God worked THROUGH\n&gt; evolution and the seven days were symbolic)....o.k.\n&gt; you can flame me about that to, but like it or not\n&gt; evolution currently IS a losing cause, why, because\n&gt; there are NO holes in creationism, it&#39;s to simple to\n&gt; find holes in, just God made everything in a few days\n&gt; and everything looked old even then, so while\n&gt; evolution in my opinion is just as legitimate,\n&gt; whenever a tiny hole appears the pure creationists can\n&gt; beat both pure evolutionists and us partial\n&gt; creationists over the head with it for two or three\n&gt; decades until ninty percent of the world is on there\n&gt; side.\n&gt;   My defense of partial creationism against pure\n&gt; evolutionism is simple though.  Before the Big Bang,\n&gt; how did the so-called &quot;primortial atom&quot; get there.  I\n&gt; mean infinately dense particals billions of times\n&gt; smaller than normal atoms don&#39;t usually just pop out\n&gt; of nowhere do they.  The only person I&#39;ve ever heard\n&gt; answer that was some nutcase astronomer who said\n&gt; aliens from another dimension wanted to do a science\n&gt; project and overloaded a black hole to start the big\n&gt; bang, but then you can simply ask how did THEIR\n&gt; primortial atom get there, and yes I do believe the\n&gt; stories about alien abductions, but not that one.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Merry Christmas everybody and may your wishes come\n&gt; &gt; true!
