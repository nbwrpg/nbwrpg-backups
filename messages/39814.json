The scene was familiar, if \nsomewhat smaller.  The ships could, at most, fit three bots in them.  The \nships opened fire on each other, until one was disabled.\n\n    In the other ship Terrataur looks at the screen apologetically.  Under \nhis breath he mutters a matching apology to his commander.  &quot;Why did you have \nto go fiddling with his programming during his last repair job Pyrotaur?&quot;\n\n    Pyrotaur looks up from his station on the bridge and grimaces.  &quot;Hey, \nnow, it&#39;s not all my fault.  We all agreed that something needed to be done.  \nWe couldn&#39;t have a commander that was paralyzed by fear.  I gave him a little \nbit of aggression.&quot;\n\n    Aquataur steps out from the shadows and laughs.  &quot;A little bit of \naggression?  He&#39;s gone nuts, I even hear he changed his name to Chaostaur.  \nHe blew our comrade nearly to death and you call that &#39;a little bit of \naggression&#39;.&quot;\n\n    Terrataur steps in between them before they got too angry.  &quot;We both know \nhe&#39;s alright.  Chaostaur launched him towards here in a stasis pod a long \ntime ago.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.  Now Aquataur, start scanning for his \nenergy signature.&quot;\n\n    She begins scanning the planet from orbit and after a short while shouted \nwith joy.  &quot;I&#39;ve found him.  He&#39;s somewhere in the Northwestern part of the \nNorth American continent.  There seems to be a battle going on, my scans are \nbeing disrupted by the energy.&quot;\n\n    They set the ship down in central Canada and begin walking toward the \nChivtron base.\n\n    Meanwhile, in the other ship Chaostaur surveys the control panels and \nspotting an overload quickly stuffs himself into an overly large stasis pod.  \nThe pod launches and crashes down in the strait of Gibraltar, ominously close \nto the Alliance base.  The pod sends the standard distress call.\n\nOOC: Wow, that was surprisingly longwinded of me.\n\n"}}
