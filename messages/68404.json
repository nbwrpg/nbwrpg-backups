The largest\n&gt; &gt;  rumbled down a thourogh=\r\nfair, almost a block in shape. At it&#39;s bow\n&gt; &gt;  was a large barreled fusion=\r\n cannon wile the top portion contained two\n&gt; &gt;  secondary cannons on either=\r\n side of a twin missile pod. The second\n&gt; &gt;  aircraft; noticably faster, wa=\r\ns set apart by its air foils and two\n&gt; &gt;  precision beam rifles.

The wings and forward fuselage formed the upper\n&gt; &gt;  body and ar=\r\nms, with the wings forming two broad shields at the\n&gt; &gt;  shoulders.
