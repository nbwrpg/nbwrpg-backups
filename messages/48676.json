In\n&gt; fact one of the biggest complaints before the restart was that there\n&gt; were too many pointless battles.  To make it all about fighting would \n&gt; be a mistake. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and resubmit your idea to the\n&gt; council, I suggest you send it to the council.
