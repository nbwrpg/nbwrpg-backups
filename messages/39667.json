Blacknightmare \n&gt; could not here Darkfate, see him, or sense him. Back inside the \nroom \n&gt; the ball spins around and begins to glow yellow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ball: &quot;This first test is a question. Each of the three paths \nbefore \n&gt; you represent a cause for war. The path to the left signifies hate, \n&gt; the path to the right, greed, the one in the center signifies fear. \n&gt; Which Blacknightmare of these three causes is the true cause of \nwar? \n&gt; When you have selected your answer step onto its path.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Darkfate/Blacknightmare:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate followed Blight. Blacknightmare was calmed down and \n&gt; &gt; answered &quot;What are test&#39;s rules? What have I to do?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;Only one may take the test. It is not a written one. \nNow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then come with me and we shall begin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blight smirked as he walked through one of the walls which \n&gt; &gt; afterwards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opened for Darkfate to enter. Elsewhere, a crane slowly \ndeposited \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare in a room with no light or any fixtures of any \n&gt; kind. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However a moment later a blue orb flew up to him and three \npaths \n&gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lit up on the floor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ball: &quot;Hello, we are now here for you to take a test. Pass and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reward will be great, fail and you and Darkfate die.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate:::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I should take the test too&quot;Replied Darkfate &quot;it&#39;s a big \nrisk, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rewards is worthy...
