The trainer leader opened a link to his \n&gt; assailant. &quot;You have a choice to make, either keep attacking me and \n&gt; lose your prize or go catch it. What would your mighty leader say \nif \n&gt; you lost the bot that your friend was carrying?&quot; He already knew \nthe \n&gt; answer so he didn&#39;t expect a reply. He let his weapons do the \ntalking \n&gt; and fired two missles at Astral and five more blasts from his \nrifle, \n&gt; three at Starlight and two at the new bot. (Ruthless ain&#39;t I)\n\n\n"}}
