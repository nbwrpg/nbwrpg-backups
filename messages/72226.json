But if MAGMATRON had shown\n&gt; himself here, then what of the otehr?\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC - Not sure if the Beast Wars II character GALVATRON has shown up here,\n&gt; but it seemed appropriate to reference him in the same thought bubble as\n&gt; MAGMATRON.  Otherwise, either way it can be WHEELIE just being vastly\n&gt; unfamiliar with both and going by gossip, and not having personal experience\n&gt; with eitehr - they could have both been dead millenia for all he knew. ;)\n\nOOC: Nope he hasn&#39;t, but there is a chance that he will soon enough.\nThe Galvatron that is part of Hydras is the G1 Galvatron, although he\nhad a very similar dragon alt mode.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - WHEELIE&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, there was a confused..  Blink from WHEELIE.  Speaking\n&gt; quietly, &quot;What is this, what have we here?  How have you come to be without\n&gt; cheer?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing over RODIMUS, his old friend seemingly aged for the damage he had\n&gt; taken like KUP to WHEELIE&#39;s sensors, body seeming partially faded, even\n&gt; though the glow was still omnipresent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What has happened here, and what is going on?  You looked like you were at\n&gt; the bottom fo the foot, stomped on by Trypticon.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing and then continuing, &quot;Now, I am gald you are here, but a few things\n&gt; we have to know..  Something very wrong is in this area, and out of it we\n&gt; will have to go.  We cannot speak, we cannot sense, we cannot call afar.  It\n&gt; is as if we are cut off from existence here, like webbed up in a separate\n&gt; jar.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from RODIMUS as he struggled to sit up, causing one of\nthe Cornu, presumably a nurse to step in.  &quot;Now you know that you\nshouldn&#39;t be trying to get up yet..&quot; She said in warm and yet chiding\ntones.\n\nRODIMUS looked at her, &quot;Yes I know, but I must.&quot; He said as he\ncontinued to sit up in bed.&quot; I have been here too long as it is,\npeople need me.&quot;\n\nThe nurse stepped back, loking something like a mother hen, obviously\ntrying to hold him back, but not sure if she should.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s going on yet.&quot; RODIMUS said in a voice\nthat was getting stronger by the moment. &quot;All I know is that Cyclonus\nand I where following the trail that the dinosaur&#39;s left and then\nthree seekers attacked us.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS paused grunting as he pulled his legs over the side of the\nbed. &quot;We lost communications in there somewhere, we couldn&#39;t call for\nhelp. I think I downed one and Cyclonus was dealing with the other\ntwo.&quot; He paused for a moment as if trying to remember, &quot;I can&#39;t\nremember what happened after that.&quot;\n\nFinally RODIMUS looked up at UNUS, as if just his presence, &quot;Who are\nyou?&quot; He focused on ASTRA and then on FIREHORN, &quot;You two I think I\nremember.&quot; He scratched his head. &quot;But not much . . . it&#39;s a jumble.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, that was me.&quot; FRIEHORN said gruffly. ASTRA just smiled coyly.\n\nUNUS smiled, &quot;Rest my friend.&quot; He said, his smile warm and friendly.\n&quot;I think we all need to talk.&quot;\n\nThe nurse was running a scanner over RODIMUS, the look on her face was\nnot a happy one. &quot;You are not fully healed yet, you need more time to\nrest.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
