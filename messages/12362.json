She sat in \nher chair and folded her wings around her body.  SHe felt cold.  Not \nthat the room was cold, but an inner cold spreading over her. She \nstarted wondering why she was even here. Why was she even trying.  \nShe knew her time on the ship would have to be cut short with that \nWwolverine in the ship, it was no longer safe for her.  She wanted to \ntry to talk to him and make peace with ihm, but he would only try to \nkill her.  She didn&#39;t feel comfortable with any bot hating her.  She \nthought about it and slumped into her chair.\n\n\n"}}
