A large\n&gt; form &gt; then made its way through and flew towards the planet. It\n&gt; ressembled some &gt; kind of winged whale, but it was obviously not an\n&gt; organic being. However, &gt; the very way it moved told of organic\n&gt; origins... &gt; &gt; Inside the ship, three transformers operated the Shadow\n&gt; Destiny. They were &gt; the Prophets, the elite Tripredacus Strike Force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gesper: &gt; We are on final approach of Earth. Geostationnary orbit\n&gt; in 3,2, 1... stable &gt; orbit achieved. &gt; &gt; The ship&#39;s wings flailed in\n&gt; the void of space to keep it over a precise &gt; continent of the planet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Melchana: &gt; Target in sight. I can fire whenever you wish. &gt; &gt;\n&gt; Belthassan: &gt; Prepare the key to vector Sigma. Fire when you have a\n&gt; lock. &gt; &gt; Melchana: &gt; What? We have the key with us? This is utter\n&gt; madness! You jeopardize this &gt; mission by bringing it with us! &gt; &gt;\n&gt; Belthassan: &gt; Shut up, sister! The key shall be terminated as soon as\n&gt; we have no more use &gt; for it, and that time will be right after you\n&gt; have fired it! Now stop &gt; discussing and do your job! &gt; &gt; Melchana\n&gt; reluctantly agreed with her elder brother, but she would never say &gt;\n&gt; it to anyone else. She knew it was necessary to the operation... &gt; She\n&gt; fired and she looked through the monitors. The whole continent was\n&gt; being &gt; technologicized... &gt; &gt; Belthassan: &gt; Now, Melchana, fire the\n&gt; reformatting cannon... &gt; &gt; She fired the gun once again. This time,\n&gt; the continent started to reflorish &gt; and it became techno-organic.\n&gt; Australia had become a fusion of organisms and &gt; technology. &gt; &gt;\n&gt; Belthassan: &gt; Prepare for atmospherical entry. Gesper, land the Shadow\n&gt; Destiny at the &gt; Southeast point of Australia and prepare it for\n&gt; deployment. Melchana, track &gt; the Hellgate and send a message to\n&gt; lieutenant Daemos concerning our arrival. &gt; Finally, jettisson the key\n&gt; to vector sigma and fire the reformatting cannon &gt; on it. &gt; &gt; The key,\n&gt; hit by the ray, started glowing brightly and exploded. Its light &gt;\n&gt; could be seen from many places on the earth. &gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___ &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
