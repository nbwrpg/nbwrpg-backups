I admit I messed up!  But\n&gt; for the sake of Primus, can we put this behind us and just move on!?\n&gt; Tucson&#39;s out there with Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rodimus and now Nightlight!\n&gt;  Every astrosecond we waste here is one less we have ta find them and get\n&gt; &#39;em back safely!  And you got Cyclonus&#39;n Scourge ta worry about too!  So\n&gt; let&#39;s try and work together here and actually accomplish something!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Look, Dinobot, he&#39;s right, our comrades need us more than ever and we\n&gt; really can&#39;t afford ta let them down.  Magmatron is out there and unless we\n&gt; put our differences aside, like Tucson was attempting to achieve with all of\n&gt; us, we might as well hand the planet over to that monster and head for the\n&gt; hills.  None of us want that, we work too hard to defend what little\n&gt; territory we have.  Let&#39;s keep it that way. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She stands up on Quickstride&#39;s rump, on her hind legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tucson started this because he believes that unity is our best weapon\n&gt; against a formidable foe such as Magmatron.  If we fought separately, none\n&gt; of us would survive his onslaught.  He did this for ALL of us.  He didn&#39;t\n&gt; have to but he did, and it would be a real slap in the face for him if we\n&gt; let it fall apart now.  Please, we gotta try ta work together, because if we\n&gt; don&#39;t, we could end up being the losers.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is a watchful smile from AIRHAMMER as he watched the\nconversation go back and forth. He is not the long winded sort, and so\nstays largely quiet in all of this.\n\n&quot;Ahh yes, you were a Maximal at one time weren&#39;t you?&quot; BANTOR said to\nthe new and improved DINOBOT, &quot;First Predacon, then Maximal and now\nPredacon again?&quot; He said as he tilted his head in DINBOT&#39;s direction.\n&quot;You seemed to have had an upgrade or two.&quot;\n\nBANTOR gestured at DINOBOT&#39;s frame, &quot;You look more like the old\nMegatron now, before he went all draconish.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile on the otherside of the clearing SKYSHADOW was still looking\nat HYDRAS awaiting his next words and LEO was standing towards the\nmiddle of the clearing, a growing sense of agitation.\n\nWINGCALIBER, TORCA and SANTON were standing next to him, waiting on\nthe small sidebar conference to end while NOCTORRO was pacing around,\nobviously letting his own sense of impatience get the better of him.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
