He is thinking, planing, carefully analyzing his\nnext move. A careful chess player looking for the next step on his way\nto the inevitable checkmate against perhaps his most difficult\nopponant when . . .\n\nA commuciation line opened  and the clearing of a mechainic throat.\n&quot;Lord Cryotek . . . Sir you have a visitor.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean a visitor?&quot; There was a confused reply from CRYOTEK\nas he listened to JETSTORM, one of his servants. &quot;How could they get\nin here without being announced?&quot;\n\nThere was a pause, &quot;Sir, he just . . . appeared . . . &quot; JETSTORM&#39;s\nvoice stopped mid sentence and then the the sound of metal hitting\nmetal, an energon surge and then silence.\n\nCRYOTEK stood, his optics flaring in anger as he brought up the lights\nand pressed as button that would open the door that seperated him from\nJETSTORM.\n\nAs the door slid open to reveal the ante chamber there was a large red\nseeker with black and silver highlights standing, his optics\nglimmering in the dimmness of the room. JETSTORM was dropping to the\nfloor completely offline, some sort of puncture marks surrounded his\nspark chamber.\n\nThe seeker straighted as he looked at CRYOTEK, &quot;I am Animus, first\nBlade of VORPAL.&quot; As the seeker rose to his full hieght, he was nearly\neight feet tall. Not quite as tall as CRYOTEK himself, but clearly an\nimposing height.\n\nAs the seeker spoke of VORPRAL a look of fear went across CRYOTEK&#39;s\nface, only to be covered by mock disdain. &quot;And what does he want here\nSeeker?!?&quot;\n\nANIMUS smiled cruelly, &quot;You have stolen what is his and we are coming\nto collect.&quot;\n\n&quot;And you think you can just walk in here and just take them?&quot; CRYOTEK\nsaid as he opened his communicator. &quot;Obsidian, Tankor, Strika, report\nto my chambers, now!&quot;\n\nAs ANIMUS talked two other seekers much like him came in, one colored\nvery much like ANIMUS only it was blue with red and sliver and the\nother was mostly white with light blue and red on the chest and wings.\nEach of the seekers was carrying glowing spheres of energy.\n\nANIMUS shook his head, &quot;I do not think they will be answering you at this time.&quot;\n\nA look of fear finally showed own CRYOTEK&#39;s face, &quot;But . . but . . how?&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t think Vorpral left them without failsafes built in do you?&quot;\nANIMUS said as the other seekers took their place next to him. &quot;They\nwere as easy to retrieve as entering in an access code.&quot;\n\nThere was laughter from the other two seekers, cruel and wicked as\nthey looked at CRYOTEK.\n\nRaising arm cannons the seekers took aim on the draconic looking\nCRYOTEK, &quot;And now for Vorpal wished us to send you his greetings as\nwell!&quot; ANIMUS said with a certain amount of grim humor.\n\nWith that they opened fire on CRYOTEK and the whole room errupted in flames!\n\nAs the smoke cleared CRYOTEK was no where to be scene.\n\nWith a nod ANIMUS and the two other seekers vanished. ANIMUS himslef\nreached down to the form of JETSTROM with a device and a glowing\nsphere rose from him as well . . . his spark. He looked at it well\nsatisfied.\n\nAnd then he too vanished.\n\n(No Tags and No need to respond)\n\n-Preston\n\n"}}
