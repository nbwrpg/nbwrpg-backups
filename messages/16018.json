Her mind went wild and \nin a million directions at once.  She had her orders from Prebon, \nwhich she would obey completely.  But her head went spinning and she \nwas falling for Prebon.  She felt herself care for Striker less and \nless.  She now was wanting Prebon, and the longer the chip was on \nher, the more she wanted him.  She knew somewhere in the back of her \nmind, that it was worth giving everthing up, if that Striker would \nlive.\n\nShe kissed Prebon again. &quot;Thank you master Prebon.&quot; She kissed him \nagain.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon was surprised when Spears kissed him. The chip was having \nmore \n&gt; of an effect on her than it did not anyone. Or maybe she was trying \n&gt; to manipulate him within the boundries of the chip. He&#39;ll play it \n&gt; out. Mutiny would be punished later.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll have to have some of his memories erased, because he knows \nour \n&gt; plans. But I might let some of his more painful memories left.&quot; He \n&gt; kissed Spears tenderly back and lept escorting her out.\n\n\n"}}
