Perhaps\nhe would find out on his own from little snatches of information that escape\nher awareness or even have to pry it out of her, but at the moment their\nstomach were the important things.\n&gt; He came to the doors and looked at them, as the light reflected off of the\nsmooth steel he noted distinct figure prints on it, they looked familiar but\nnot so familiar that he could recognize them right off. He pondered about\nwho they might belong to but then decided to think about it later, he pushed\nopen the doors and stood aside for Tavatron to exit first...seeming to\nbecome a habit.\n&gt; Dinobot looked at Tavatron but keeping watch not to make eye contact with\nher, she had found out TOO much the last time she had looked into his eyes\nand it had made him uncomfortably was curios of what she found out when she\nhad last looked in him but decided to stick to the topic of hunting, he\nneeded to know where was the best place to hunt. Perhaps Tavatron knew.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Perhaps you are aware of a location where prey is abundant?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
