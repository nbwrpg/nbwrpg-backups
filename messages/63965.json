Because of\n&gt; &gt; that, =\r\nthey will be found by the Pacificus, the Bushidos, the Silver\n&gt; &gt; Wings, or=\r\n the Iron Skulls. The Watchers don&#39;t perform archeological\n&gt; &gt; searches; th=\r\ney have other business to tend to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) We&#39;ll also need to determine=\r\n where the characters are reactivated.\n&gt; &gt; After all, it will play a role i=\r\nn the reactions. Just imagine when\n&gt; &gt; they find out the new bot in Olympus=\r\n is a dreaded minion...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) If the council decides the randomness, =\r\nhow will their char\n&gt; &gt; distribution be random?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an idea tha tI h=\r\nave in order to increase the tention and\n&gt; &gt; creativity in this restart (to=\r\n name it some how). instead you choose\n&gt; &gt; the faction that you belong at f=\r\nirst, the election will be radmonly:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Example:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   1=\r\n.. Let give a Maxis number 1, Preds no 2, minions 3 and\n&gt; &gt; tripeducus 4. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   2.. You won&#39;t know what&#39;s the faction name under the number. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n   3.. You will said randmonly: Nighlight will go with number 3,\n&gt; &gt; Windlo=\r\nrd with munber 2 and Rodimus witn number 2. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   4.. All chars that wil=\r\nl survive and be found in stasis in Earth\n&gt; &gt; would be found by menbers who=\r\nse belongs the number.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   5.. You can do all rerprogramation and chang=\r\nes that wish.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why that? In order to burst creativity, tention and plo=\r\nts. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a bot is founded by members of a rival faction, can yo=\r\nu imagine\n&gt; &gt; what might happen?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course this is an idea \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Incase that this idea be aprobed, council members will share the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; code and what number belongs to each faction each other,  and they\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n will follow a similar proces. Same ida can be aplied to new chars made\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n for the &#39;restart&#39; but just for this time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After Re-star runs=\r\n, characters will goinf faction/creat one, as\n&gt; &gt; ussually have done.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think about this idea?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _____________=\r\n___________________\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
