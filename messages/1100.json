The \nprivate CR chamber in his suite was very quick and precise, but not taking \nany chances he went to a mirror and checked his face. It was perfect, \nflawless, and handsome....for a Predacon. He placed his gun in its holster \nand went to the bridge, :::\n\n::: He entered to discover PHENIOX, GREMLIN, JACKLE, and BLACK ARACNIA busy \non the computers and there tasks. But, RAT TRAP was also amoung them....:::\n\n::; HELL BEAST, his portly body in the command chair ::: Why is that rat in \nour base?\n\n::: GREMLIN ::: If it wasnt for him, MEGATRON would have destroyed the \nAuto-bots. I think we can trust him, now.\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: I find that very doubtful. Place him in a secure Brig \nuntil I decide what to do with him. Its bad enough Quickstrike is playing \nhavoc with our systems...\n\n::: RAT TRAP ::: HELL BEAST, I can help you get Quickstrike out. I know-\n\n::: HELL BEAST places a hand up ::: Silence. INFERNO, take him to the Brig at \nonce!\n\n::: He draws his attention to the small diagnostic drone floating above him \nin the command chair :::\n\n::: MEGATRON, with a disguised voice ::: Sir, there are still some Predacon&#39;s \nthat have not returned from battle. But I do not detect any major damages \ncoming from them.\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Excellent. What else?\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: Um, an aracnid wants to have a word with you. I belive he is \na clone of some kind.\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: What dose that damn spider want?\n\n::: TRANSANULAS chuckles from behinde HELL BEAST ::: Hahaha! HELL BEAST, you \nspeak so spiteful of me?\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Your a cheat and a liar, what do you want before I kill \nyou?\n\n:: TRANSANULAS :: Let me rejoin you, once agian. \n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Fat chance. Predacons, open fire!\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: No, wait! I can help you, please, let me join you!\n\n::: GREMLIN interrupts ::: Sir, I think we should give him a seconed \nchance...he will serve us, or he can die.\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Very well Gremlin, hes your response ability.\n\n::: TRANSANULAS smiles and tots off to communicate with Quickstrike. It was \nonly a matter of time before they took control of the ship agian. :::\n\n"}}
