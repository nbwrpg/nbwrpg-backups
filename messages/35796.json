Ice had seen inside Megatons mind and\ndidn&#39;t like what she had found. She&#39;d told the others about it on the way\nback to Veratis&#39; base. Razor Claw still believed in the legacy of Prime.\nEven more now that he had met a bot claiming to be him.\n\nLunarpine was a just bot, he wasn&#39;t the type to judge based on a one sided\nstory that came from a Megalomaniac like Megaton. He was willing to give the\nold bot the benefit of the doubt. He was still confused that the bot had\ndrugged him and then switched his body. Veratis had also given him back his\nreason to function, Shadow Wing. (Now known as Ice.)\n\nThier transport came to a hault in what appeared to be an ice cave. In\nreality it was one of many holds in Veratis&#39; ship. The hatch opened and the\nthree stepped out. Veratis was recharging so it was Foxfingers who greeted\nhim. &quot;Welcome back, it&#39;s good to see you again.&quot; the foxbot said in his\nusual straight face. &quot;I&#39;ve set up energeon and drink in your quarters if\nyou&#39;d like to rest.&quot; He stepped aside to allow the three weary travellers\npassage to the hallway.\n\nLunarpine watched the smaller bot carefully as he passed. He remained in\ntelepathic contact with Ice the whole way. &quot;Be carefull love, if Veratis\nintentionally gave the two of you his virus theres no telling what else he&#39;s\nwilling to do.&quot; His thoughts betrayed him though, Ice knew that Lunarpine\ndidn&#39;t believe what he was saying. The old bot had injected her with the\nvirus to stabilize her transformation, it was only safe to assume that he&#39;d\ndone the same for Razor Claw.\n\n\n"}}
