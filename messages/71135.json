He may ha=\r\nve retreated for now, but it&#39;s not enough.  I made a promise to all of you =\r\nthat tables would be turned.  I don&#39;t intend to go back on that promise by =\r\nany means.

He doesn&#39;t do that when he&#39;=\r\ns ticked off.&quot;\n\n&quot; You should consider yourself lucky that you&#39;re on my good=\r\n side Straight Shot.&quot;\n\nShe gives him a wry look and kicks a tire hard.\n\n&quot; O=\r\nw!&quot;\n\nStraght Shot leans up against him.\n\n&quot; You so deserved that and you kno=\r\nw it, hot head!&quot;\n\nHe replies back, a bit crestfallen.\n\n&quot; All right, I get t=\r\nhe message.  I was out of line.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smirks.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s more like =\r\nit.  Don&#39;t take it the wrong way Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s always had a nasty tempe=\r\nr, even when he was just an average Autobot. I can remember a lotta bar roo=\r\nm fights and all those times where he&#39;d smash a con&#39;s face to unrecognizabl=\r\ne smitherines.&quot;\n\nTucson also adds in his part.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s right, I never lost =\r\nmy temper around Autobots, only Decepticons.  But I would get agitated with=\r\n certain Autobots from time to time..  But that&#39;s as far as that went.&quot;\n\nSt=\r\nraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; I remember that.  Sort of what Ratchet was like back =\r\nin the days.  Great medic, Brilliant individual, but he also had a nasty te=\r\nmper. That kinda rubbed off on you big guy.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot; Before I bec=\r\name a warrior, I do remember helping Ratchet periodically with Supply runs.=\r\n I&#39;d get what he needed and deliver the goods safely back to the Iacon med =\r\nbay.  Then, I&#39;d actually watch him repair damaged Autobots.  When I wasn&#39;t =\r\nfighting, I was using my spare time to restore old weaponry and artifacts. =\r\n I got to learn a lot about simple repair work, simply by watching Ratchet,=\r\n and taking his good advice.  That was all before my unfortunate run in wit=\r\nh Cyclonus.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks up to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Of course, when he was =\r\nneeded on the battlefield, Tucson was always there, on time, no matter wher=\r\ne he was or what he was doing.  I guess his temper stems from the need to s=\r\nee a job well done all the way through.  Hydras is disrupting that sense of=\r\n stability, and that&#39;s what&#39;s really making Tucson angry.  If given the opp=\r\nortunity, would you allow him to face Hydras once again, to try and even th=\r\ne score?  I really think he needs that if he&#39;s gonna find personal closure.=\r\n&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perce alter itoptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That isnt possible&quot;said Perceptor by comli=\r\nnk&quot;We willbe altering the history \n&gt; and hydras would have a better chance =\r\nto capture Megatron&#39;s spark if he \n&gt; wants, as in Beast wars...

Of course, no harm will come to anyone=\r\n \n&gt; here, Legacy, Rodimus, excuse my actions, they were not done with the b=\r\nest \n&gt; of judgement.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson, and this time wit=\r\nh a concerned look on her \n&gt; face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ever since that day, you haven&#39;t =\r\nbeen the same.  I know, I was there, and \n&gt; lemme tell ya it haunts me too.=\r\n  Have ya ever thought ta open up about it \n&gt; Tucson?  Maybe that would kin=\r\nda help ya heal a little bit.  The wounds are \n&gt; still fresh, even though t=\r\nhat fight was a long time ago.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right.  Ro=\r\ndimus, Legacy, I&#39;ve been keeping something from you for a \n&gt; long time, and=\r\n that&#39;s not what a respectable leader does.  A leader may be \n&gt; strong but =\r\nhe too, must open up about the issues that weaken his state of \n&gt; mind.  It=\r\n all started on the day of that battle, that had Rodimus abducted \n&gt; and ta=\r\nken over by Hydras and his forces.  I fought in that battle as a \n&gt; soldier=\r\n. And being a Ninjabot myself, I knew of Nightrazor&#39;s properties, yet \n&gt; I =\r\nfelt that if I barged in on Rodimus, it would only land me with a case of \n=\r\n&gt; insubordination.  So, I refrained from doing so, but tried to divert enem=\r\ny \n&gt; attentions indirectly.  For the most part it worked and I was able to =\r\nfight \n&gt; my way through those who knew nothing about Ninjabot combat.  Yet,=\r\n there \n&gt; were seekers who were far more swift on their wings then I was on=\r\n my wheels. \n&gt; They were bearing down on the Autobots, to the point that I =\r\nfelt that if I \n&gt; did not step in, there wouldn&#39;t be an Autobot left to def=\r\nend the Ark or the \n&gt; planet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He pauses.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; From what I remember,=\r\n I transformed into my vehicle mode, and started to \n&gt; kick up dirt from my=\r\n tires, in hopes that a seeker would see what I was up \n&gt; to.  It worked, a=\r\nnd I grabbed the attention of several, although I couldn&#39;t \n&gt; see who they =\r\nwere because they were rather high up from me.  Then, suddenly, \n&gt; I was st=\r\nruck.  And I don&#39;t remember anything more than that.  A long time \n&gt; afterw=\r\nards, I was brought back online, and when I woke up, I could only see \n&gt; da=\r\nrkness.  At first, I thought it was a power outage, but then, I was told \n&gt;=\r\n that my optic sensors were completely destroyed by the cranial shot that I=\r\n \n&gt; had endured during that chase.  I asked about you Rodimus, but, no one =\r\ncould \n&gt; tell me what happened.  It was at that point where I knew that I f=\r\nailed you \n&gt; If only I had listened to myself the first time, and came in f=\r\nront of you \n&gt; when you were chasing Nightrazor that first time.  You would=\r\n not have \n&gt; suffered as you had, nor would your family. And since then, I =\r\npledged to get \n&gt; back on my feet, and never let my defenses down again, an=\r\nd if I had to, I&#39;d \n&gt; strike back harder than any Decepticon or Predacon co=\r\nuld ever fathom.  I \n&gt; failed you once Rodimus, and I pledged NEVER to let =\r\nthat happen again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson with a thoughtful ga=\r\nze.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wow, you never even told me all that before.  Well, since we&#39;re o=\r\npening up \n&gt; about it, I wish I could help you guys understand what happene=\r\nd, but I only \n&gt; remember a little bit more than he does. Right before he g=\r\not shot, I saw \n&gt; Cyclonus decending just a tad closser to us than the othe=\r\nr seekers that were \n&gt; following us.  I saw him take the shot and I screame=\r\nd, and that&#39;s when \n&gt; everything went blank.  I think what would really hel=\r\np Tucson now, is \n&gt; knowing that what happened, really wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Tucson now turns his head toward Megatron&#39;s body.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Having the Dec=\r\nepticons here amongst us is highly un nerving to me.  There \n&gt; must be a wa=\r\ny to separate them from the Autobots, and place them in a safe \n&gt; location.=\r\n..  Wait, I remember something..  The Decepticons had their own \n&gt; craft, T=\r\nhe Nemisis...  Why couldn&#39;t we return them to their rightful craft \n&gt; and s=\r\neparate them from the Autobots, where both factions would be safe from \n&gt; h=\r\narm?  Rodimus, due to circumbstances which I have just told you, for my own=\r\n \n&gt; emotional stability, I can not have these Decepticons here.  But I&#39;m wi=\r\nlling \n&gt; to help preserve them in a safe location away from the Ark.  Legac=\r\ny, if you \n&gt; could, I&#39;d like you to find out where the Nemisis is now locat=\r\ned and if it \n&gt; is within reach.  Once located, I want the Decepticons brou=\r\nght safely back \n&gt; to their own ship, where they can rest in peace, thus le=\r\naving the Ark to the \n&gt; Autobots to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot smiles=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s more like the Tucson I know.  I like that idea, I like i=\r\nt alot.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside the Ark, Uproar and Quickstride look to each other an=\r\nd just shrug \n&gt; off the event.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmm, oh well, would&#39;ve been fun ta see=\r\n them end up in the tar pit but, \n&gt; works for me, Uproar.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Uproar nodd=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ditto.  Okay, so, I guess we can go back inside.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They get in=\r\nto beast mode, and prance back into the Ark. Yet, Uproar could \n&gt; not help =\r\nbut look back with a perplexed look on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras did a final shot and send a secret message to Nightrazor &quot;Th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; door\n&gt; &gt; is open, time to leave&quot;and said in loud voice &quot;PREDACONS.=\r\n..

As a gua=\r\nrdian, it was his job, his internal\n&gt; &gt; directive to keep the Ark and all o=\r\nf its occupants safe, an imperative \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; would also include even t=\r\nhe Decepticons that were to wake up several \n&gt; &gt; million\n&gt; &gt; years later.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s single optic pulsed as he took in the scene, Hydras leaving=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon pointing a weapon at Megatron to ensure that he did so.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;NONE OF THE ARK&#39;S OCCUPANTS ARE TO COME TO HARM.&quot; Legacy said, fallin=\r\ng \n&gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; his old coldly logical voice.

All of her syst=\r\nems seemed otherwise in\n&gt; &gt; stable condition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus looked at Nig=\r\nhtlight and Elita, a soft look on his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s voice boo=\r\nmed through, threatening the Predacons. &quot;SLAG!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus said as he glan=\r\nced back at Elita, &quot;You stay here.&quot; Ramulus said.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to lock yo=\r\nu in and then go see if anything can be done for our\n&gt; &gt; medical staff.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus spoke as he quickly gathered up a few med packs and a scanner=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Danged daft Predacons, causing so much damage.&quot; Ramulus grumbled und=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; breath. Ramulus was no medic, but he did know a bit about f=\r\nirst aid. \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps\n&gt; &gt; there was something he could so for Santon and B=\r\nump who were still lying \n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; the floor of the corridors. Perhaps th=\r\ney were not as . . . hurt as they\n&gt; &gt; looked. He couldn&#39;t even bring himsel=\r\nf to think of them as dead.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a last look at Elita he left. The =\r\ndoor clicked as he locked it and \n&gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; the room that Elita was in w=\r\nent silent except for the computer monitors \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; were watching ove=\r\nr Nightlight.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the moment all was peaceful in the medbay.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; However outside the Ark was a very different matter!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and Kup keep their fire against Scourge and Deepstrike\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As the firefight continues Deepstryke took a hit, as did=\r\n Scourge, forcing\n&gt; &gt; them to break off their attack on the door and swing =\r\nup into the air to\n&gt; &gt; avoid any further and more critical damage. Several =\r\nmore of the sweeps \n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; blasted from the skies, the last one swing=\r\ning up next to his master \n&gt; &gt; Scourge,\n&gt; &gt; almost as if for protection.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Predacons were looking decidedly more damaged and a bit more tire=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; before. Energon looked to be looking a bit lower than befor=\r\ne and the shots\n&gt; &gt; from Windlord and Kup were building up on them, not to =\r\nmention the \n&gt; &gt; firepower\n&gt; &gt; coming from the fuzors as well as Leo II! Ye=\r\ns, the Predacons had breached\n&gt; &gt; the door, but getting further in would be=\r\n an uphill battle indeed, and \n&gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; of them did not look to be in t=\r\nhe best shape to fight it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Outside, =\r\nQuickstride quickly gets Uproar to his feet, and\n&gt; &gt; assesses the situation=\r\n.
