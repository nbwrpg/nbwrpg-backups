Screw the future, she wanted spark plugs!\nIron Raptor looked over her shoulder at the battle, spying Imprisoner firing \nat the shit.\nFrom her wrist a phaser emerged and locked into place with the grip in her \nhand, arm outstretched and auto-targeting the bot&#39;s chest plate.\nShe fired 4 splatter charges, ones that would explode on impact and could \nrip a bot to pieces.*\n\n&quot; Leave my ship alone!&quot;\n\n* With the autoguns programmed to fire on a mere thought, they swivled on \ntheir bases, targeting along with her own system and zoning in on \nImprisoner, fireing off a blast each before turning in unison towards \nPredator and firing towards him.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
