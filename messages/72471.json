And don&#39;t worry, I am sure the game came wait for a while\n&gt; longer. The l=\r\nand of make-believe should ALWAYS take a back-seat to the\n&gt; real one. :)\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; P.S. Sandy, I may have to try the recipe myself :)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; On 10/20/11, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I hope you feel better=\r\n soon.  I just made a block buster chicken soup from\n&gt; &gt; scratch to bring t=\r\no my friend&#39;s mom who was also  not feeling well.  And if\n&gt; &gt; you have some=\r\none to make it for you, here&#39;s what you do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ingredients:  One whole=\r\n chicken, three to four onions, a handful of parsley,\n&gt; &gt; five of six carro=\r\nts, several stalks of celery, and a pinch of salt,\n&gt; &gt; according to your ta=\r\nste.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Put the whole chicken in a large soup pot, and pour just enoug=\r\nh water over\n&gt; &gt; the chicken to cover it.  Then add onions, carrots, celery=\r\n and then season\n&gt; &gt; with salt according to your own taste.  Start the soup=\r\n on high until it\n&gt; &gt; begins to boil, then lower to a slow to steady simmer=\r\n for two to three hours\n&gt; &gt; or until the legs of the chicken are loose.  * =\r\nJust lift the chicken out of\n&gt; &gt; the pot with a pair of tongs and jiggle th=\r\ne legs* .  Once the legs are\n&gt; &gt; loose, you&#39;re ready to take the meat and v=\r\neggies out of the soup.  First\n&gt; &gt; discard the parsley, which is only there=\r\n for flavor, then in a sparate\n&gt; &gt; mixing bowl, you add the veggies and on =\r\na platter you put the chicken.\n&gt; &gt; Allow meat and veggies to cool and then =\r\nstart by cutting the veggies into\n&gt; &gt; bite sized pieces and put them back i=\r\nnto the broth of the soup.  Then you\n&gt; &gt; take the chicken off the bones, di=\r\nscard skin, fat and bones, and shred the\n&gt; &gt; meat into bite sized pieces an=\r\nd put that back into the soup.  Once this is\n&gt; &gt; done, turn off the heat an=\r\nd allow the soup to cool. Once it cools down the\n&gt; &gt; fat will rise to the t=\r\nop and it will solidify.  When you&#39;re ready to eat it,\n&gt; &gt; just skim the to=\r\np of the soup and remove the fat.  Heat to desired\n&gt; &gt; temperature slowly a=\r\nnd boil up your favorite pasta and most importantly,\n&gt; &gt; ENJOY.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns is our family recipe that comes straight from Florence, Italy.  Trust\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n me, you&#39;ll love it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;a=\r\ndamsafran@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; OOC - Sorry for the lack of posting, running a=\r\n fever and so I fear I won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be super active until it passes.
