The gestalts have been around in TF history since \n1985.  The Protectobots, The Terrorcons, the Aerialbots, the Stunticons, the \nCombaticons, and the Constructicons.  I think that is all of them.  I was \nborn in the early month of January in &#39;87, last year of the TFs.  Kind of \nstrange how I know so much of about them.  Anyway, once more, thank you for \nyour suggestion, but frankly, and no offense intended, you are one of the \nbest RPers in this entire RPG (I&#39;ve been wondering why you compelled to make \nyour posts so long, and I see it is habit), but you are wrong.  A mix between \nfantasy and science fiction has been a great success  numerous times.   Of \ncourse, as usual when I actually need it, my memory is lacking.  The only \nreal success I can currently remember was a cartoon called the Visionaries, \nand that was an extrodinary and popular cartoon.  Anyway, we aren&#39;t really \nmixing them anyway.  The Dieties possess no magical powers.  At first, they \nwere merely named after some of my favorite mythological gods, but a few \npeople made them look like what they were supposed to have (JP, which was \nrather entertainingly surprising).  So all we are mixing are the names and \nappearances, nothing more.  Maybe a few mentionings of events in Greek mythos \nby my part...:)\n\nBut, as long as I have a professional writer in my presence (not mocking \nyou), I was wondering if you could answer a few questions.  I myself am \ncurrently striving to become a good author, but I&#39;m only so-so, of course it \ntakes time.  But to get back on track, why is it that Earth and Humans aren&#39;t \nusually capitalized, I&#39;m pretty sure they are proper nouns.\n\nThanks,\nUnitron \n\n"}}
