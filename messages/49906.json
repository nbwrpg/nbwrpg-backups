It&#39;s not nearly as big as \na battleship, but the latter would have a rough time fighting the \nformer - Rogue Star bristles with assorted weaponry, not all of it \nCybertronian in origin.\n\n&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t care about the rubber duck.  You&#39;ll see her, all \nright,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but she&#39;s staying right here until exactly \nhalf your ship&#39;s cargo is aboard Rogue Star.  Riekan!  Jayde!  \nTorin!  Let&#39;s go, already!&quot;\n\nThe two males tramp out of the ship, with Phoenix between them, head \ndown.  She&#39;s a mess - she hasn&#39;t seen the inside of a CR chamber in a \nlong time.  There&#39;s no sign of the other Rogue.\n\n&quot;Well, where&#39;s Jayde?&quot; Gatara asks, irritated.\n\n&quot;Last I saw, she was in her sister&#39;s room,&quot; Torin explained.\n\nGatara rolls her eyes.  &quot;That explains it.  Alright, let&#39;s get this \nstuff unloaded.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker arrives and waits outside the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  O.k. you can take all this stuff as soon as\n&gt; I see the girl, it&#39;s just too bad I won&#39;t be able to\n&gt; get the rubber duck autographed.
