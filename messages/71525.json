It was all about speed, precision, balance, \ndiscipline, grace, and of course effectiveness.\n\nHe could see potential in her and turns his head in both Nightlight and \nBumps direction.\n\n&quot; Bump&#39;s right, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential \nfor train&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot.  You got the right moves, mody, and grace, and \nonce you&#39;re trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight.  Master \nYokitron once said, that a student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t \nrealize it themselves.  Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the \ntraining, just see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training \nprogram for ya.  Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too..  It&#39;s a \nperfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra training under your \nbelts.&quot;\n\nHe positions himself again.\n\n&quot; It would really help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta \npull on ya in the past.  The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \nthat Master Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what could \ncome down the pike.  Clear minds empty of thoughts are less likely ta get \ninfected by negative influences, simply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta \nhold onto.  Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark.  Bad stuff just goes in one \nway, and out the other.  You guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took \nyou.  And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be.  I bet my spark plugs \nthat if you and Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our level \nand that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side of the \ngalaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive.  This type of \nstrength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony.  A perfect \nbalance between spark, soul, and mind.  And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dexterity \naquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity that makes even Tucson \nPrime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Commander.  It&#39;s a \ndifference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the direction \nTucson is gonna take, and if you guys were trained in our art, so more power \nto ya.&quot;\n\nHe then looks to Bump, as the repair bench does its job to repair the \ninternal damages done to him.\n\n&quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that reminds me...  I need new hydraulic shock \nabsorbers, timing belt, and I know my struts need work, new tires, body \nwork, and Ty Rods fixed.  Oh yeah, need a new front and back end alignment \ntoo.&quot;\n\nTo repair the damgages to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehicle \nmode, to prepare for the rest of his repairs.  He also notices a busted \nheadlight on the left side.\n\n&quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for the left side, new bumpers, front, \nback, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up.  Probably because I \nsmacked that tree real hard in alt form. After this is all done, I am so \ngonna give those preds the bill, literally.  In other words, I need a total \noverhaul ta my alt form.  And if you can help it, I&#39;d like ta hold onta this \none for a while.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Stood up And leave her daughter in the bed, she smiled and \n&gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; to her daughter &quot;I be righ back in  no time, just remain here&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight smiled and she walked toward the interior of the cr, she \n&gt; &gt; looked\n&gt; &gt; to Bump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive skills that I \n&gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT quizzically, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He\n&gt; manipulated a few controls on his screen. &quot;If you are looking for a\n&gt; specific ability, I can see what I can do, but as far as skills, that\n&gt; is something you learn. I can&#39;t make you a sharp shooter or a lock\n&gt; pick. I can only give you the tools you need to make that happen. You\n&gt; will have to practice to get good at it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
