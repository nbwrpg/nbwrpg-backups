Zardus looks back to Lady Hawk, &quot;Now, what were you doing to \nSquizzy?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc stops, nearing the flying portions of the Alliance base. For some \nreason they had slowed, continuing ahead slowly. He activates his internal \ncomputers, tapping into the computer of one of the shuttles.\n\nHe nods, looking through the info he got back. The cargo section was a bit \ntoo heavy for the shuttle carrying it, so they had to slow for now. Another \nshuttle from the Iron Fist was on its way to soon help.\n\nHe sighs, flying ahead to the Iron Fist.\n\n"}}
