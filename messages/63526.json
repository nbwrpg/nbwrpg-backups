Too many factors to dictate which exact\none it could be. But of this I am certain, my recon and combat skills\nare intact.&quot;  She lowered her head as a momentaty recognition of a\nlost piece of data crossed her mental circuits. &quot;Oh, perhaps retrieval\nwould not be an ill-advised solution. I may be able to have my records\nrestored.&quot;  An image flashed through her  mind faster than she could\ncomprihend it. But a tear fell from her cheek, though she did n[t feel\nthe emotion, it fell from a long distant reaction.  She looked at the\ndrop of water that fell to her hand. &quot;Odd, perhaps I am in need of\nrepair.  I am leaking from my optics.&quot; Her tone of voice showed no\nemotion, perfectly monotone. &quot;So, I was sent to help the Maximals. BUt\nso far, my mission orders are lost.

She\n&gt;   semi-smiled at him.  She felt a little uncomfortable.  &quot;I am Silence.\n&gt;   Maximal from, ah, well, data banks are incomplete. Programmed am I\n&gt;   with many reconicence programs and battle sequences.  Night vision and\n&gt;   long range vision with audio anhancement technology. I am deamed\n&gt;   sniper and watchbot.&quot;  Her head lowered as she heard her own programs\n&gt;   spin in her head.  So many spaces, so much data lost. Scrambled were\n&gt;   things she felt she needed to know. Too much time in a pod with too\n&gt;   little power to sustain all her functions. She knew she spoke the\n&gt;   truth. To do so would be very detrimental to all those who put trust\n&gt;   in her. She looked back up at him. &quot;I am Silence. What orders do you\n&gt;   hace for this Captain of the Ranks?&quot;  Captain? she thought to herself.\n&gt;   Where did I come up with that rank. But some how, that felt rather\n&gt;   correct. It must have been her rank before she arrived here. If only\n&gt;   she could remember time before waking up in the pod.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
