She tried a new connection, one to the protoforms \nspine, and tried to make the bot sit up.  It took a lot of effort and \nenergy, but she finally got the bot to sit upright on the table. \n\n&quot;HOLY MATRIX!  I DID IT! I DID IT! YEAHHHHOOOO!&quot; were the words that \nappeared on the screen.  \n\nBut the connection drained to much energy and she lost the \nconnection.  the bot fell back onto the table with a loud bang.  \nShe felt a little energy drained, but happy at her accomplishment.  \nBut, the form didn&#39;t feel like it was apart of her.  More like a \nremote control.  She sighed and hoped that Lunarpine would return \nsoon.  She missed him terrably.\n\n\n"}}
