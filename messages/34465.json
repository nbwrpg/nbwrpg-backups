If not, he should have.\n\n::Cygnar::\n    He watched Magmatron leave the conference room.  &quot;Apocalypse, it&#39;s time \nto begin our battle plans.&quot;  He opens a com to Ramjet.  (If Ramjet&#39;s there \njust ignore this part.)  &quot;Ramjet, I need you in the conference room now.&quot;  He \nturns off the com and brings up the map.  He hits a few buttons and the map \nsplits into two smaller maps.  One shows North America, the other shows the \nMiddle East.  He then highlights the Destron bases on each map in blue.  The \nknown enemy base (Trainers) he highlighted in red.  The Destron&#39;s allies \n(Predacons) were highlighted in green.  The other two bases in North America \n(Chivtron and Decepticon) were highlighted in yellow because they were \nrelatively unknown bases.  &quot;My recommendation is to attack the Trainers, \nhere.&quot;  The red dot blinks.  &quot;Ramjet and I were planning a battle there when \nthe rest of the Destrons returned.  I think we could take them now but if we \nneed reinforcements we can always get the Predacons to back us up.  The \nreason I recommend attacking the Trainers is that they pose the greatest \nthreat to our bases.  There are no other bases near ours that are known \nenemies.  If, Apocalypse, you agree, then I will formulate a plan of attack.&quot;\n\n"}}
