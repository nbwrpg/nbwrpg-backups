He would have\nkilled the cruel commander that Land Mine and Time Bomb had.\n\n::Hot Rod::\n\nHot Rod was standing outside the Ark, when a rush of power went through\nhis body. He relized that the Maximal Matrix within him, had recharged.\nHe was now Rodimus Prime. Then a thought came to mind. In his last body,\nthere was no differance between Hot Rod and Rodimus. In this body he was\ntaller, and his alternate mode must have changed too. He wouldn&#39;t be\nable to hide the existance of the new Matrix from the Preds anymore.\n\nOOC: To anyone who updates the site, do not change the member, and\ncharacter page to be Rodimus, leave it Hot Rod. And to anyone who wants\nto bicker, there are several places to do it besides the RPG board.\nThere is:\n\n1)The EGROUPS NBWRPG chat room. 2)The main sites chat room. 3)The main\nsites message board. 4)And the message board on the RPG&#39;s &quot;backup&quot; YAHOO\nclub.\n\n"}}
