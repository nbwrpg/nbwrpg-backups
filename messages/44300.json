What happened to the really nice person that I met\n&gt; when I first started rpging. You were one of the first people who even\n&gt; bothered talking to me. How come you sound so bitter all of a sudden.\n&gt; Are you just upset at certain people, or on certain days?\n&gt;\n&gt; Your post is unacceptable, how come you can&#39;t send it private?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, your post wasnt totally illegal, in fact everything would have\n&gt; been legal if you spaced it out a bit more, in more than one post. We\n&gt; are still deciding what to do, but it&#39;s not gonna all be void.\n&gt;\n&gt; :)\n\n\n"}}
