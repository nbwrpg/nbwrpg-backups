We have come to a few conclusions, and have sent some people requests over private email. However, the public announcement is this:\n\nCyberdog&#39;s plan is ok this time around. We understand what he was trying to do, and he did alert me earlier, though his posts led people to believe that the generator was shorted out and stuff. However, next time we will be watching carefully. Don&#39;t lie IC unless its your chars speaking or something, people!\n\nAs I said, some people will recieve some stuff from the council. You&#39;re free to discuss it with us, but please don&#39;t turn this into a big argument. No one likes to scream at people.\n\n- Yanshosh writing on behalf of the council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUME!\n\n\n"}}
