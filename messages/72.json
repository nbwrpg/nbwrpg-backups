She looked him over more closely and suddenly \nsmelled confusion in his sent. She looked over at the distant herd of \ngazelle then back at Rowdy Wolf, still noticing his discomfort. Then it came \nto her, the reason why he was so nervous!\nHe thought that she was a real wolf who could talk, she smiled at this.\nZyber straightened her stance.*\n\n&quot; Zyber, Transform!&quot;\n\n* Within seconds she stood in her robot form, her white wolf hair falling \nabout her head, shoulders and chest while it also covered her lower arms and \nlower legs, making look as is she were wearing arctic wolf knee-boots.\nZyber bowed her head.*\n\n&quot; Pleased to make your acquaintance, Rowdy Wolf. It is the lack of prey in \nmy mountainous home that brings me here, I was hunting when your music \ncaught my attention.&quot;\n\n* Zyber looked up at Rowdy Wolf, he was a whole 3 inches taller then her. \nYet, now she could almost feel the tension draining from him, even just a \nlittle. She guessed that it must either be her peaceful and youthful \nappearance or her size.*\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
