She noticed that when the Dark One pushed her, \nZardus made no effort to defend her.  She also noiced that this \nDarkOne showed immediate displeasure with her.  She would have t \nrethink her stratagies.  She knew she had DevilDuer in her paws.  Now \nfor the others.  If she couldn&#39;t have Zardus, she would have the rest \nof the crew.  She didn&#39;t want to be the leader, but second in command \nwould suit her nicely.  She thought about Dark One.  he was a good \nlooking bot.  And he deffinately peaked her interests.  Him and \nZardus may be tough guys, but still guys.  she smiled to herself.  \nShe knew that all she had to do was push the right buttons.  And all \nshe had to do was bide her time and keep trying untill she found out \nwhat the weakness was.  \n\nShe purred aloud so the two could hear her.  She jumpd down and \nwalked over to Dark One.  She brushed up against his leg.  She looked \nup at him with her deep cat eyes.  Then she walked over to Zardus and \nsat next to him.  She moved his hand with her head indicating that \nshe wanted him to pet her.\n\n\n"}}
