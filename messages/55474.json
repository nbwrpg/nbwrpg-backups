Prime had\nto be stopped for the good of all Transformers, or at least directed\nback at the Tripredacus.\n\nEngaging his warp drive, he thought of where best to land. He\nconsulted his geographical data and found a very interesting place.\n\nHis ship went faster and faster. He knew he was going to crash land,\nbut he hadn&#39;t really expected to ever come back alive from this place.\nHe just checked that the security devices protecting his particular\npackage were functional and engaged the thrusters. On the horizon, he\nsaw the white of snow and ice.\n\nThe crash was horrible, but the ship&#39;s systems protected him well. He\nopened the canopy and felt the bitter bite of cold. The South Pole,\neven in his time, was not a very hospitable region. He had to deal\nwith it, and the new technologies would help him.\n\n???: Engage Environmental Adaptation Addition.\n\nHis body seemed to already accomodate the ice, and in fact even\ngenerated it. His wing became ice-like and his color changed to a more\npolar blue.\n\n???: That&#39;s already much better!\n\nHe opened a communication channel using Maximal and Predacon frequencies.\n\n???: Hello, Brethren. I am here on behalf of the Survivor Council to\nget rid of the abomination that dares to call itself Optimus Prime. I\nneed assistance and support. My name is Protoform Z... I am AzureBlade!\n\n\n"}}
