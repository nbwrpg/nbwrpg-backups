I have ALSO have come to understand that she \ndoesn&#39;t want this story line to continue. \n&gt; \n&gt; You say that it is too late to change everything just because she \nhad a change of heart, but... that isn&#39;t what I was said. I suggested \nthat you devise a new storyline to continue from where you are, so \nthat Airly can control her character. I didn&#39;t say you had to just \nlet BN go and then do something else, I wanted you to act and not \nreact...\n&gt; \n&gt; Live with the consequences? Don&#39;t dwell on the past, work on the \nfutur. Your ideas are good, but your method for implementation is \nwrong. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you say that BN cannot do anything about her predicament, then \nAirly had an equal right to say that Orchestra removes the device and \nthey are ok, or something along those lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I suggest that you repost, possibly suggesting what stuff BN \nmight be inclined to do. And one more thing, Orchestra has every \nright to remove BN&#39;s spark, and you can&#39;t just say that she&#39;s left \njust so that you retain control. Airly can determine whether BN \nfights back or not. I think that you would find the saying &quot;It&#39;s a \ndog eat dog world out there,&quot; quite accurate... others might not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finding the the post where Airly agreed to your scheme means \nnothing, that was the past and this is now. Deal with now, since the \npast cannot be changed.\n\n\n"}}
