It was \nher habit. She was always wary, and jumped at every shadow that could \nbe Predacon. \n\nBut now things could change. She would have to trust her own kind \nagain. She may be nervous for a moment, but she had to fight it. \nThere could be someone there to tell her to be calm.\n\nShe doubted that. It was rare when a Predacon care about the other. \n\nCyber Claw stopped in her tracks. There was a figure, a gray and gold \nfigure laying on the ground. She cocked her head and sniffed. It \nsmelt familiar. She lowered her head and walked carefully towards it. \nIt didn&#39;t move when she went closer to it. She soon found out that it \nwas Rattrap. She noticed somethings different about it, but it was \nstill that awful Maximal rodent. \n\nShe flexed her sickle claws and gaped her mouth. She snarled at the \ndamaged body. She spread her three digited fingers on her forepaws. \nShe made her presence known to him, as a threat, and still nothing.\n\nHe was in stasis lock. \n\nShe began to grin. She stood up tall and transformed to robot mode. \nShe tapped him with the tip of her foot, with no reaction. She then \npicked him up. Using the rat could be useful as an acceptance for the \nPredacons. She took off in flight mode.\n\n\n"}}
