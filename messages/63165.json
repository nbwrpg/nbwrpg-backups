He compulsively emptied all the\n&gt; cartridges and removed the gunpowder which he then quickly poured into\n&gt; some jar-like containers.  He used some spare parts to create a\n&gt; detonator, then some scrap metal to provide some shrapnel, finally\n&gt; tightly wrapping the makeshift devices in tape.  He now had six\n&gt; functional grenades that would prove very useful.  He found a little\n&gt; hiding space by the main hatch where he sat and waited with his\n&gt; grenades and riffle that was in less than perfect condition.  If all\n&gt; else failed he would resort to using his arm cannons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ready!&quot; he said, doubting she could hear him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?
