Lunarpines wolf instincts kept him alive \nin the wilderness. He sat in quiet thought for a moment, when \nsomething inside told him to scan internal functions. There he found \nit, &quot;comlink&quot; as plain as day, and he knew what came next.\n\n&quot;Comline online, scan incoming frequencies&quot;  He instructed in a \ndemanding voice.\n&quot;SCANNING&quot; he heard a voice inside his head\nLunarpine now picked up the signal from the unknown source\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She left her commlink open for the person to respond.\n&gt; &quot;I am talking through my comm-link.  It allows us to talk to one \nanother \n&gt; while being great distances away from each other.  Like, I can talk \nto you \n&gt; from 18 parsecs away with a link like this.  Or even contact \nsomeone 5 other \n&gt; quatrants away.  I&#39;m so used to it, I hardly notice it.  It&#39;s built \ninto my \n&gt; arm. It actives when someone uses the maximal frequency.  Or \nsomeone can use \n&gt; my frequency and talkt to just me. Why? Don&#39;t you  have a link?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -----original message---\n&gt; From: CYBERWOLF4  &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri Jun 30, 2000 4:02pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: (unknown)(The great north.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpin smelled the air, his systems were not yet fully online so \nthe\n&gt; wolf/bot could not hear the incoming transmission Shadow Wing was \nrecieving.\n&gt; &quot;Who are you talking too?&quot;Lunarpine asked with a puzzled tone to \nhis voice.\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t smell anyone nearby.
