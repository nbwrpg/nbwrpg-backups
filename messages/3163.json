He lowered his arm and then looked over at Tavatron with an expression so cold that it could have frozen fire, he had looked forward to slaging this new bot for it&#39;s constant annoyances but she had stepped in and stopped him...something that had disappointed him greatly.\nHe narrowed his optics at her and growled, he was in no mood do have other bots step into his battles and stop him from spilling fluid.\nDinobot then looked away from Tavatron and took a step back from Cyber Claw, it almost felt that she was commanding him to stand down and taking over....something that made him very uncomfortable and he wanted her to know it.\nHis hands balled into fists, his two claws digging into his palms and causing mech fluid to drip from them and onto the floor...all he could do to stop himself from slaging the new bot and Tavatron as well and , frankly, that scared him.\nBeing so engulfed in rage that he wanted to slag the very bot who had been brave enough to call him friend did, indeed, frighten him a bit, it wasn&#39;t natural but he had always been known for his aggression.\nDinobot looked away from both of the bots before him in hope that he would calm a bit, plainly glaring at the wall with a disappointed expression on his face.\nHe would have to talk about this even with Tavatron later.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
