He sits down and hangs his head low.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; you&#39;re right, war j=\r\nust never seems ta just go away.  It just keeps going no matter what we do.=\r\n  Anyway, you&#39;re about ta get grilled by Tucson or in for one of his lectur=\r\nes, depending on his mood.  Good chance he&#39;s still in a sour mood.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He=\r\n gets up and continues to escort Wheelie to Tucson&#39;s quarters.  They come t=\r\no a waiting area teaming with many masterfully restored Cybertronian artafa=\r\ncts personally restored by Tucson himself.  One such piece, an ancient cros=\r\ns bow lies displayed within a glass case.  The lighting in the room reflect=\r\ns off the weapon&#39;s frame.  Uproar stops to admire it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Wow....  I&#39;ve =\r\nnever seen this before, look at it, Tucson actually restored this a long ti=\r\nme ago.  And over to the left, an ancient Cybertronian time piece.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He=\r\n then points to other artifacts in the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; He restored all these t=\r\nhings.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like these.  It&#39;s like a window into the p=\r\nast.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n\nWheelie had allo=\r\nwed himself o be led over to Tuscon&#39;s quarters, and then as he stood outsid=\r\ne, and Uproar gestured to him to follow in, he quietly shook it, &quot;Thank you=\r\n, but it&#39;s his home, and we&#39;re alone.  It would be wrong to intake, without=\r\n his permission, or his walls they would break.  This is where he sets his =\r\nspark, to go in without his duress would be to set it apart.  Thank you for=\r\n your time, but I shan&#39;t wish to go in with just thine.&quot;\n\nThen, as he left,=\r\n giving a salute, going to transform to his small racer mode and began to d=\r\nart along the corridors of the Autobase.\n\n\n\n"}}
