He did so but the first\nshot, as calculated too, was by too quick and nailed Halucigen in the\nhead. He head snapped back and his mind went scrambled for a couple\nseconds. He whipped his tail trying to wrap one of Hot Rod&#39;s legs\nwhile firing four feather missiles from his wings that locked on to\nHot Rods head.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I can do that, like dcoburn said. If they were fighting before,\n&gt; then Hot Rod probably only walked like a step or two. You wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; had time to get up and fly away. Its not cheap its the way it is. Just\n&gt; take the hits.\n\n\n"}}
