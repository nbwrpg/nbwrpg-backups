She \ntook a moment to comtemplate this question.  She searched her spark \nand found the answer.  &quot;I am a Recon bot. I follow my spark as well \nas orders. No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a leader. At least I have had no \ncchance to lead yet.&quot; She looked at him for a moment.  She knew that \nin order to accomplish any type of training or gain in skills, she \nwould have to put her feeling for him aside. She thought that being a \nffighter was out of the question right now.  She knew that he was \nright about one thing, she would have to find herself before anything \nelse could happen for her.  &quot;I will return after a few hours.&quot;  \nShe started to walk to the entrance of the base.  She stopped and \nturned around. She looked at Lunarpine. &quot;And I will return this \ntime.&quot; She smiled and walked out.  She transformed into her\n owl mode and flew off.\n\nShe went to a small grove near the base.  She sat and meditated on \nthe words that Lunarpine had used. &quot;Fighter? No, that I am not. \nLover? That one will have to wait. Follower? Yes, that I am. I do \nfollow my commanders. Leader? No, that I am not.&quot;  She went through \nher systems and programming.  She downloaded a Scout program that she \ndidn&#39;t realize that she had.  She gained a little more confidence in \nherself.  She realized that all bots must work within the means that \nthey have.  She stayed perched in the tree and wathced the sun set.  \nShe was feeling better, about everthing.  Even though Lunarpine had \nnot taught her to fight, he taught her something about herself.  She \nsmiled at the thought.  She watched the sunset with a new attitude \nand better train of thought. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine knew the question would be asked sooner or later, he just \n&gt; wanted to hear her ask. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can, you seem distracted \n&gt; with me around.&quot; He wasn&#39;t entirely serious but she needed to be \nkept \n&gt; in place. Lunarpine sensed her feelings toward him, those would \nhave \n&gt; to be tossed aside before she could take him seriously.&quot;You can&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; taught, you already have everything you need, you just need to \n&gt; download it from inside yourself.&quot; The wolf in him knew he couldn&#39;t \n&gt; teach her to fly, but he&#39;d be slaged before he saw her quit on \n&gt; herself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The great leaders didn&#39;t get taught to be great, the great \nfighters \n&gt; weren&#39;t taught to fight, either it&#39;s there or it&#39;s not. I can&#39;t see \n&gt; your spark, so tell me, what are you, a lover, a fighter, a leader, \na \n&gt; follwer? WHAT ARE YOU?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That was the one question she had to overcome before she could \nreach \n&gt; her full potential.\n\n\n\n"}}
