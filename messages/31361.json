Megatron, but how, he had died over 300\nyears ago. He thought this robot was a myth, something that Autobots used\nto scare the younger soldiers. A boogy man of sorts. He was striken with\nfear, and didn&#39;t have a clue what to do. Cliffjumper did though. He\nclenched his fists in rage, and wanted to blast the frikin screen.\nBeachcomber sensed the sudden changes of emotion though, and put a\ncompforting hand on Cliffjumper, &quot;Ease up there Jumper, we&#39;ve just been\ngiven orders&quot; he finished, as he escorted Cliffjumper away from the screen.\n&quot;Come on junior&quot; he called, reffering to the panic striken Firedrill. He\ncouldn&#39;t blame him though. The kid had never met anyone as scary, Galvatron\nleft Cybertron before he was even programmed. And with his personal\nexperience he felt Megatron was worce. Cold and calculating, powerfull, and\nmerciless. Firedrill snapped out of it, and followed, keeping his eyes on\nthe screen, until they left, &quot;Uhhh, sure, sure thing comander&quot; he said,\nshakily. He would normally have been overjoyed to finally have been\nexcepted, but he couldnt shake the fear.\n\nThey arrived at the door, which led them out.\n\nOOC: Could someone who is largely cruicial to what is happening outside,\nexplain what my characters see please?\n\n\n\n"}}
