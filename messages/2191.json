I know the meaning to a powerful\n&gt;  character, and that&#39;s not the way to go. You&#39;re just going to write\nanything\n&gt;  you like, and confuse the heck out of everyone else. I don&#39;t watch\n&gt;  wrestling, so you will confuse me! Don&#39;t do that. You don&#39;t see me\nbringing\n&gt;  in a nighthorse from Rider at the Gate do ya? I like it, but I&#39;m not\n&gt;  introducing them to the RP. Because they have no place in Beast Wars.\nBots\n&gt;  wrestling, yeah right. Can we get back to the reality factor? &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s your choice Code, but its just a plainly dumb idea.  Kind of like if\n&gt; brought in a Mohammed Ali (the boxer) character.  Or if I brought in The\n&gt; Flash, Batman, or something else.  But, Talon, Cybertronians may wrestle\nfor\n&gt; a sport, that hasn&#39;t been proved or disproved though.  But a pro wrestler\n&gt; wanna be has no place in the RPG.  This isn&#39;t an RPG on Cybertron&#39;s\nwrestling\n&gt; position or WWF, it&#39;s about a little place called Past Earth to decide the\n&gt; fate of Cybertron and Earth, and the galaxy, losing will cause Cybertron\nto\n&gt; be destroyed, the Decepticons ultimately dying out, after the Autobots are\n&gt; all but dead.  Earth nothing but a dry dust ball with no energy, or life.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/959384683/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
