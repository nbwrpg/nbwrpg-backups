She wanted to go back home as much \nas Vulois did.  She looked at him, &quot;Ah,  We need to find a safe place \nto stay while we do this.  Uh, we can use the cave. So far as I know, \nwe are the only ones that know about this cave.&quot;  She thought about \nthe cord in her shoulder.  It would serve as a link connection, but \nshe hoped her programs would be able to stand up to Vulois.  If his \nanti-tamper programs were too strong, she wouldn&#39;t be able to get \nin.  She looked at Cybershark and smiled,&quot;Well, I guess then you get \nfirst watch huh?&quot; she tilted her head slighty and gave him  a warm \nsmile. She took a step forward and kissed his cheek.&quot; Thank you.&quot;\nShe then walked into the cave. She smiled and looked around,&quot;You \nknow, a few curtains, a little paint, a few more windows, and this \nplace would be down right cozzy.&quot; she said with a chuckle.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois&#39; face lit up with a smile.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I would do anything to get back to Cybertron.
