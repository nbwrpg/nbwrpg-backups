If your post abides by the rules then it can&#39;t\n&gt;   and won&#39;t be disregarded. You shouldn&#39;t need to worry about have any\n&gt;   illegal posts, most initial posts tend to be incorrect for various\n&gt;   reasons. You&#39;ll get the hang of it quickly. =) Take Soulstice&#39;s\n&gt;   start post for example.\n&gt; \n&gt;   WarBarge, don&#39;t encourage him! =P\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   On 17 Jul 2001, at 23:06, dewboy30816@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt;  Sorry I&#39;m putting alot of work into these and I hate any\n&gt;   possibility &gt; they could be dubbed illegal.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
