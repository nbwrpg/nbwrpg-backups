He listens to the bot&#39;s \nwords, his arm reaching behind him.\n\nDemise roars in pain as the missile explodes, making his body jerk as \nwell as destroying all the armor aroudn the spot where it hit, along \nwith a good portion of the circuits. Demise grabs Rampage and flings \nhim off.\n\nTrying to get to his feet, Demise realises that connections to his \nleft leg were non-existant. He growls again, beginning to roll toward \nthe edge of the mountain that they had come up.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer jumps over Tankorr&#39;s dive, kicking out his legs at the \nVehicon&#39;s head. EndBringer didn&#39;t fire any more missiles; he didn&#39;t \nlike being in the explosion range of his own weapons.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther jumps into the air, transforming and modifying his robot mode \nto include a jetpack. He powers it up, shots hitting his legs.\n\nScyther flies through the air, fireballs from inferno and an icebeam \nfrom someone overhead hitting each other, sending waters showering \ndown on Paralysis. Scyther arms his charge launcher and fires \ndownward several times.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Rampage leaps on top of Demise, the fallen bot had just skid \nacross \n&gt; the tundra from several of his shots. &quot;Ah, I want to savor your \nfear...breath \n&gt; it in...&quot; He says, and inhales deeply, seeming to get enjoyment out \nof the \n&gt; bots temporary pain. Rampage turns to his arm, once bloddy and \nbleeding, it \n&gt; is now frozen. At least he didnt have to worry about bleeding to \ndeath, the \n&gt; ice clot saved him from that.\n&gt;        &quot;And now, its time to end this playing.&quot; He said gruffly, \nraised his \n&gt; missle launcher, and fired point blank.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tankkor flipped three times, as far as he can remember. His \nright \n&gt; crawler was damaged so he transformed and turned once agian to \nEndbringer. \n&gt; More mech oozed its way out of his wounds and left silver puddles \nin the snow.\n&gt;        No more marching, now he was going to get this bot. With a \nsting in \n&gt; his knee, he ran as fast as his large body could go and dove at \nEndbringer, \n&gt; vast arms extended to keep the bot at bay.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Paralysis hears a thud. It must be Scather falling, finally. \nHe points \n&gt; his wrist at a dent in the snow, and fires. THe black liquid was \nsupposed to \n&gt; be his paralizing toxin, but due to the cold it&#39;s chemical compound \nwasnt \n&gt; going to be very effective. But, it would allow Paralysis to see \nthe bot.\n&gt;        As the liquid spry settled on the ground, he saw the faint \noutline of \n&gt; Scather lying on the snow.\n&gt;        &quot;Looks like we&#39;ve evened the odds a bit!&quot; Paralysis say, and \nwith a \n&gt; left broken arm moves forward, now with pistol in hand, and begins \na shoot \n&gt; out.\n&gt;        Inferno buzzes around the air, sees now Scather who was once \nvery \n&gt; invisable. &quot;Ah ha! The invader!&quot; He soars down and releases \nfireball after \n&gt; fireball.\n\n\n"}}
