He\n&gt; observes the Terrorcons messing with some Maximals, he sees\n&gt; and hears Megatron going for the big fish, and smiles, deciding not\n&gt; to bother Megatron till he is in need. He debates quickly about\n&gt; firing on the Element (S) then realizes the futility of the matter.\nHe &gt; decides on a closer, smaller, easier to destroy target,\nCliffjumper. &gt; He owed the bot anyways. He fires his Ionic Displacer\nrifle three &gt; times at the smaller bot. &quot;Haha, dance foolish\nAutobot!&quot; &gt;\n&gt; ----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Switchblade sees Fireblade in aparent trouble, and curses. He\n&gt; sneaks over to the battling bot, and attaches an unarmed charge to\n&gt; his back, in an easy to reach spot. He quickly leaps back to avoid\n&gt; gettin noticed, besides by Fireblade who can see him anyway. He\n&gt; continues on, dropping a Spider, and using it as a third eye.\n\n\n"}}
