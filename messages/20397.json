I am also curious as to why \nyou broke in here. I have no reason to let you live. But I gave you \nmy word that I would not harm you. And I swore that no harm would \ncome to you.&quot;\n\nShe no longer really wanted this bot. For anything. She only wanted \nhim to leave. She didn&#39;t see him as a threat. If anything, she hoped \nthat she might gain him as an ally.\n\n&quot;You intrieg me Fox. You came here, stole stuff from my lab. You \nobviously had a reason, and I wish to know that reason. I will not \nharm you. Once you have ansered my questions,&quot; she looked down, \nknowing she would live to regret this,&quot;I will let you go. No harm, no \nfight. Just answer my questions and you are free. You have my word, \nmy honor.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Foxfingers transformed back to bot mode and stayed crouched behind \n&gt; the engines. He pulled out a detonator knowing that a Preds \ngreatest \n&gt; weakness was self preservation. &quot;I have a detonator over here, \nwhats \n&gt; to keep me from blowing this whole place to little pieces?&quot; he held \n&gt; it out in the open for her to see. He wasn&#39;t lieing, he had a \n&gt; detonator, he just didn&#39;t have the explosives to back it up. It was \na \n&gt; gamble but he was quickly running out of options. His bag of tricks \n&gt; was running low too. \n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat wanted him alive he wanted to know why. &quot;Whats so important \n&gt; about me that you&#39;d let me live?&quot; he asked directly. There was no \n&gt; longer any avoiding the issues there were only questions and \nanswers.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
