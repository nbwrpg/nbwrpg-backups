At \nmost, SS could get on him.\n\nPerceptor&#39;s shots missed both Burrock and Tyrael, but blew a few \nnearby trees to splints. The stinger fired by Waspinator, however, was \nstraight on target. Burrock was thrown back a dozen meters, making him \nlose his grip over Inferno. He splashed in the water, but before \nanyone could track him up, he burrowed in the muddy pond&#39;s bottom.\n\nWarhead tried to aim at Shadow Star. He fired many small explosives, \ndoing not much damage individually, but devastating in group.\n\nWarhead: Cowardly foe! Do you think that you could be superior to \nMilord Megatron? Diplomacy will not prevent your death at my gun!\n\nAt the mention of ruling the universe made by his lieutenant, Tyrael \nfrowned. He was going to have a long strategic chat, but that would \nwait. Megatron was out now, and the true fight would start.\n\nTyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come. You will learn why \nthey call me the Blue Firestorm!\n\nHe showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts, no bigger than \nneedles.\n\n\n"}}
