But she could \nsee with her senses good enough for what she needed.\nIt was down there, she could smell it. Her meal.\nDesmonus could sense another food sorce right beside it, but it didn&#39;t smell \nquite as tasty as the other one.\nShe decended quietly into the forest around the clearing, folding her wings \nin beside her once her feet touched the ground.\nWith quietness she crept towards her intended prey. Keeping to the shadows \nto make sure that she couldn&#39;t be seen.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
