She \ndidn&#39;t want to see her fellow bots get thier tail pipes kicked in \nwithout a proper fight. Being a well trained warrior, she wanted to \nsee all the action. No fighting without her was her own rule. She did \nlook back at Blackfang and grin a bit.

Then he got an idea.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, Tripredacus guy!  Can you change your weapon so it will \n&gt; repulse him instead of damage him?  If we harness enough energy, \nand \n&gt; we catch him off guard, we could shove him back through the rift.  \n&gt; Then all we would have to do is seal the instablility.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He was worked up, the plan would work... if a few things happened \n&gt; right.  One, securing a large enough energy supply for Malice, two, \n&gt; a way to get energy to Malice, and three, get energy from said \n&gt; bounty hunter to the repulser.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Please! We have to try this!
