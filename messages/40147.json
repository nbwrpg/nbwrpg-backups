He then\nlooked at Dead-End&#39;s pecemistic view. &quot;Maybe, but at least he&#39;ll go out\nin a crash and burn.&quot; he said getting pretty worked up. Breakdown was\nlooking around nervously however.\n\nHe was nervously looking around, and when he caught Astrotrain&#39;s eyes,\nthought it best to speak. &quot;So we have to do some aquariaticral work?&quot; he\nasked Astrotrain.\n\nSinnertwin had found something, the sent of an animal perhaps, he\nthought to himself. He moved off away from the group, making a lot of\nnoise as he did. The hissing grunting and growling mass of yellow\nreptile made his way towards a forest. &quot;Smell from in there.&quot; one head\nnotted. The other nodded, &quot;Small creatures, lots of them.&quot; the other\nchimed in nervously. Then they both curled up backwards nervously, &quot;WE\nHATE.&quot; and heat began to build in both mouths, as they jutted their\nheads foward sharply, emmiting two streams of searing flame towards the\nbushes. Emidiatly when the heads were down, the cannon on his back\nflamed to life, and began spouting random balls of fire into the canopy\nof trees. The first few bushes immidiatly caught on fire, and began to\nspread, whereas the ones caught directly in the stream of inferno simply\ndisapeared in smoke.\n\n"}}
