She leaves him on the floor, goes into the room, and brings back \nsome sort of techno-organic &quot;metal&quot; box. She throws one at Anachronox.\n\nMelchana: Strap it around his chest and press your hand on it.\n\nShe straps it on Gesper, presses her hand and backs off one foot. The \ncold form of her brother, still in semi-stasis lock, is then filled by \nsome kind of warm energy. It is enough to break the lock and bring him \nto consciousness. He was not as strong as he usually was, but he was \nback.\n\nGesper: Where am I? What happened?\n\nJetstorm: Hehe! Nothing a good bath can&#39;t shake away!\n\nBelthassan, on the other hand, was cold too. He was not as bad as his \nbrother was but still...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: Sorry for not noticing that Gesper wasn&#39;t at the Autobot base \n&gt; anymore, but since I forgot about him the first time, I figured that \n&gt; Pacifix would forget about him for a bit. Then when it isn&#39;t soo \n&gt; hectic, he can do something about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this post is void, i&#39;ll find out when I read the rest of the \n&gt; posts.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Anachronox --\n&gt; \n&gt; Anachronox jumps up, and quickly strides across the ship. He hefts \n&gt; Belthassan gently, and turns to face Melchana, &quot;Melchana, lead that \n&gt; way, I won&#39;t allow Belthassan to lose functionality while I can \n&gt; prevent it.&quot; He looks around, but doesn&#39;t know where to go, so he \n&gt; just waits for Melchana.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan is at sea, holding Gesper. The Hellgate is right above \n&gt; them \n&gt; &gt; but they need help fast to get out of the water.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana looks around, trying to find some kind of vine. She sees \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; crane, but it is not long enough to get them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana: AAAAAARGHH! Stupid technological ship! You can&#39;t find a \n&gt; vine \n&gt; &gt; when you need one!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm is panicked. He was not prepared for this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Melchana! Why don&#39;t you do something?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana: And why are you not doing anything, Nutbrain?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Jetstorm, for the Matrix&#39;s sake! You&#39;re a hawk! Fly down \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; and pick them up!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Y... Yeah... That&#39;s right... I can fly...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He transforms to hawk mode and flies down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Bel! Hold on to my talons!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan: Finally! (He spits some water out) It was time one of \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; acted!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The waves were strong and violent. Belthassan had to use great \n&gt; stamina \n&gt; &gt; to keep his head out. He made a sweep with his hand to grab the \n&gt; talon, \n&gt; &gt; but missed it widely. Still holding his brother, he moved his legs \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; swam nearer. The second pass succeeded, and Jetstorm used his \n&gt; large \n&gt; &gt; wings to get back and into the ship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As soon as they were inside, Daemos closed the doors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana: Anachronox, help me get them to regenerative units! It \n&gt; won&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; get them to full health, but it will at least get them back in \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; sort of shape!\n\n\n"}}
