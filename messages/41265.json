I havn&#39;t been able to get online for the past two days (hence not posting). My hard drive finally died all the way, and I turned it in and got it replaced. I just now got everything installed (takes a while to set up a dual-boot Windows/Linux comp). I have caught up, but its 4:11am and I still havn&#39;t got to bed, so I&#39;ll post tomorrow as soon as I&#39;m concious.\n\nBTW! The council election has been over for a few days now (if anyone who could still vote tried to vote, they should get an error), but the new council is:\n\nrAuq@...\nRdahl@...\nBeastWars@...\n\nAnd me, but that&#39;s normal. Anyways, I havn&#39;t changed settings on the site cause my server isn&#39;t cooperating with me, but I&#39;ll do that tomorrow too. Alloran and Megan, its been great having you guys on the council. We wouldn&#39;t have accomplished as much as we did if you guys hadn&#39;t been on the team. I hope to see y&#39;all in future councils. Congratulations to everyone else that ran for council. It was a really close race.\n\nBut congratulations to the new council members! BeastWars is gone for two weeks, so I guess its just me, rAuq, and Rdahl for now. I&#39;ll get Rdahl councilized tomorrow (I have a feeling I&#39;ll regret that).\n\n\nAlso, the previous council has gone on for three months (partly because of incompetence on my part and partly because of the election being so close to August that it was just left up there to make things easier). Do you guys (all RPGers) want to extend the terms to three months, or do you wanna keep them at two months and make the first council an exception?\n\n\nOne of my jobs ends next week, and I&#39;ll have a bunch of extra time to RP and work on the site. I&#39;ll get it fully updated and complete the new login system as soon as I can. Should be pretty cool.\n\n\nG&#39;night everyone.\n\n\n"}}
