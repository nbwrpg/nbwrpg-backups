He&#39;s\n&gt; seen her before. He wanted to help her in that short quarrel, but his\n&gt; damaged limited him.\n&gt;\n&gt; As she approached him, he lifted his head, his left claw shaking. &quot;Course\nya\n&gt; can join,&quot; he said to her. &quot;Mentella, right? Mighty sorry that ah went\n&gt; spooky on ya back there in th&#39; forest. Recent days ain&#39;t been good t&#39; me\nas\n&gt; ya can see.&quot; He tapped his right claw against the side of his damaged left\n&gt; foreclaw. &quot;Ya damaged? Ah&#39;m goin&#39; t&#39; th&#39; CR chambers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then he thought of something. He commanded the computer: &quot;Computer,\nshields\n&gt; up!&quot; He then said to Mantella, &quot;We&#39;s be safe now, eh?&quot; He took a few steps\n&gt; forward. He received Silverstyke&#39;s transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; He said into his comm-link, &quot;Silverstryke? Sure! Ya can join. Ah&#39;ll send\n&gt; some tin-horn t&#39; come get ya.&quot; This may be a way in repaying him for\n&gt; bringing him back on-line.\n&gt;\n&gt; He shouted into the hallway, after Sinesis, &quot;Hey Sinesis! Ah need ya t&#39; do\n&gt; uh job! Want ya t&#39; find uh bot named Silverstryke and bring him here! He&#39;s\n&gt; one of us.&quot;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Buy Long Distance with your GROUP and SAVE!!!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4123/10/_/_/_/958791834/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
