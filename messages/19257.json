He lands \nnear the bot.\n\n&quot;I am Zardus, Alliance commander,&quot; he introduces himself, &quot;You&#39;re \nlooking to join?&quot;\n\nHe figured that since the bot wasn&#39;t firing, he was either neutral or \non the Alliance.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe missiles dig into WarMachine&#39;s chest, leaving smoking dents. The \ngestalt stumbles forward, but regainst balance.\n\nMaking his way back toward Minion, he fires at Surge and Shokaract, \nmissiles and lasser shots streaming out at them.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Hey, Shokaract just fired, Zardus is the one who made the arm \nblow off.\n&gt; And I&#39;m sorry, I got you mixed up with JP. I almost got kicked out \nfor\n&gt; making such a big gestalt, he was 30 feet tall and JP actually \nkicked me\n&gt; out. Well, he didn&#39;t remove me from egroups, and I just corrected \nthe\n&gt; mistake and backed up everything I did. And I can&#39;t RP a gestalt \ncorrectly?\n&gt; I have been doing it for some time, now...\n\n\n"}}
