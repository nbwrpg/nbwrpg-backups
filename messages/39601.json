Blacknightmare \ncould not here Darkfate, see him, or sense him. Back inside the room \nthe ball spins around and begins to glow yellow.\n\nBall: &quot;This first test is a question. Each of the three paths before \nyou represent a cause for war. The path to the left signifies hate, \nthe path to the right, greed, the one in the center signifies fear. \nWhich Blacknightmare of these three causes is the true cause of war? \nWhen you have selected your answer step onto its path.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Darkfate/Blacknightmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkfate followed Blight. Blacknightmare was calmed down and \n&gt; answered &quot;What are test&#39;s rules? What have I to do?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;Only one may take the test. It is not a written one. Now \n&gt; &gt; then come with me and we shall begin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blight smirked as he walked through one of the walls which \n&gt; afterwards \n&gt; &gt; opened for Darkfate to enter. Elsewhere, a crane slowly deposited \n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare in a room with no light or any fixtures of any \nkind. \n&gt; &gt; However a moment later a blue orb flew up to him and three paths \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; lit up on the floor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ball: &quot;Hello, we are now here for you to take a test. Pass and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; reward will be great, fail and you and Darkfate die.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate:::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I should take the test too&quot;Replied Darkfate &quot;it&#39;s a big risk, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rewards is worthy...
