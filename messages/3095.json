She doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make friends easily, but if you get close to her you\n&gt; will have a friend for life. She likes to fight, and\n&gt; she is good at it, armed with her Magna Pulse Cannons,\n&gt; (3 shots from one of those and your wasted!)she is\n&gt; always ready for battle, she doesn&#39;t learn to trust\n&gt; ppl quickly, and is suspicious about almost\n&gt; everything, Extremely intelligent, and always thinks\n&gt; things through! She is quick to help others, and\n&gt; beleives that a life lost for no reason is a waste of\n&gt; a creation.She likes to challenge herself, and be\n&gt; better than the best.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
