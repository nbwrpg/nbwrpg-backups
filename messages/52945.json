However, they sent me here to fetch Talos. As Talos is a great\nleader of men, I assume they needed him for either a large-scale\noperation or a military planning. Either way, I believe the so-called\nTripredacus are some important military guys, and I think they could\nbe aiming for Cybertron. What they&#39;re here for, though... Could be\nthey&#39;re seeking the Ark or the Nemesis, but your bet&#39;s as good as\nmine. I don&#39;t really know about them except as rumors as an\nunderground organization, but I don&#39;t think the Preds are with them,\nat least not in practice.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not wise to make demands of someone who could kill you out of \n&gt; hand,&quot; Devilcat warns.  &quot;But in any event, I&#39;m prepared to return you \n&gt; to your Maximal brethren - IF you can help us in dealing with these \n&gt; Tripredacus buffoons.

Our sensor records tell us that a second \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wave of Tripredacus forces have arrived on this planet.  In our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion, this is trouble.
