Surprised by the title? \nWell, I guess that it had to come to this eventually. I know I&#39;ve \nsaid &quot;I&#39;ll be with this RPG through thick and thin!&quot; but then I \nthought about it and realized what I had said and wondered...Why? Why \nshould I stay in an RPG that I just do not find as fun as I used to. \nWhy should I stay in an RPG when I&#39;m not even interested in \nTransformer&#39;s anymore, unless their G1. And why should I stay with an \nRPG like NBW when I have as much fun as I do in my own RPG, \nhttp://www.dbzsf.vze.com &lt;Shameless self promotion. I know nobody \nwill miss me, probably, because nobody ever really liked my posts. \nSo, like Alloran, and Zardus, and Jer, and Lurker, and many other \ngreats before me, I&#39;m retiring. Sorry it had to come to this. Let&#39;s \nsee here, what should I say in my speech? Well, here it comes.\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, thank you Alloran. You were what kept me in NBW over \nthe times, and all, and you were always fair to me and even became my \nfriend when I yelled out a horrible &quot;SCREW YOU!&quot; Which was just wrong \nof me, it really was. Alloran, I treasured the times we used to make \nfun of Liono and the things we used to say about JP! Oh, man! I had \nfun, true fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lurker, you are one of my greatest friends, too. At first I didn&#39;t \nunderstand you, but then I realized that we were so much alike that \nwe were meant to be friends. It&#39;s a twist of fate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jer, you da man! There, in your own words, even, Jer. You sure did \nmake me feel bad for not talking to you in a while when you put me at \nthe top of your mail. Well, you are one of the ELITE man. Seriously. \nIt&#39;s great to be your friend. JUME!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff, you were one of the greatest moderators this RPG has ever \nseen. Your brand of fairness and punishment is unrivaled by any of \nthe voted on Moderators. You were also a good friend, and I also had \nfun talking with you.\n&gt; \n&gt; RoboRick, you are similar to me in several ways. Except your RPGing \nskills were never as crappy as mine started out as. HAW! But really, \nit&#39;s fun talking to you and if you win your bid for Council Member, \nwell, congratulations, you deserve it. You are a good RPGer, and I \nhope that you have fun while I&#39;m gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus, you, I&#39;ve had a very unusual relationship with. I first \nreally met you when you called me an idiot for having Sinesis sweep \nup  your guy, who was it? I can&#39;t remember now, but the point is, \nthat we soon became friends. If it was not for Zardus, I would never \nbe the RPGer I am today, he showed me the way to do things, and I&#39;ll \nnever go back to the ALL CAPS NO SPACES NO PARAGRAPHS NO SENSE guy I \nwas before. I mean, I could only think about myself until I received \nthe ultimate tutor in Zardus. Besides that, Zardus was always fair to \nme, helping me out when I had problems with other RPGers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf, Airly, you 2 are cool with me. Cyberwolf takes the RPG \nvery seriously, and is a great RPGer. Airly, you&#39;ve been great, a \ngood friend. I&#39;m sure the 2 of you can keep NBW alive in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Logo: I don&#39;t really know what to say, besides that you were a \ngreat friend. I&#39;m sorry I never got one of my characters in a \nrelationship with one of yours. Truly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Minime_316. Thanks. RIP my friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I guess that&#39;s it. Anyone who wishes to keep in contact with \nme can e-mail me at my god awful e-mail address, thecode@p... Now, \nfor a list! A list of every character I&#39;ve ever had in this RPG! It&#39;s \ngoing to be beautiful! Here it comes!
