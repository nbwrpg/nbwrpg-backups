Rat Trap appeared, Tuscon\nrevived, Darkhawk was knocked down, and for a moment it seemed as if\nTuscon was going to drive right over him, but then he swerved, and\nafter a blast from Rat Trap that blasted open a section of wall they\ntook off down.\n\nZarak smiled as he sent a few shots from his energy rifle down after\nthe fleeing Autobot and Maximal!\n\nQuickly he leaped over to where the fallen Darkhawk lay as he opened a\ncommunication to Hydras and Perceptor, &quot;The prisoner has escaped!&quot;\nZarak looked back over at the hole that was blown in the door as he\nspoke, &quot;There were two of them. One of them was hiding on that Tuscon\nAutobot. He somehow freed him and they&#39;re driving through the base!&quot;\n\nEven as Zarak did quick scan of Darkhawk to check his vitals, a deep\nthunk of metal boots hitting thick deck plating could be heard from\nbehind him. A door slid open.\n\nAfter ascertaining that Darkhawk would live he stood and turned, &quot;Yes\nmy old friend, the time has come once again.&quot;\n\nTaking up the entire frame of the door was the massive figure of\nScorponok, Zarak&#39;s second body so to speak. At the moment it was\nheadless, giving it a strangely ghastly and yet vulnerable appearance.\nHowever that was easily rectified as Zarak leaped into the air and\nwith the tel-tale sounds of gears grinding he shifted into a head, one\nthat slipped perfectly between Scorponok&#39;s shoulders and clicked.\n\nIn his own form Zarak was short, even diminutive, but now joined once\nagain with Scorponok he was fully head and shoulders taller then most\nMaximals and Predicons! With a Decepticon purple frame and powerfully\nbuilt green limbs he radiated aggression and domminance! The cannons\nmounted on his shoulders and the massive claws that he had for hands\nwere mute testimony to the true destructive potential that lay at his\ncommand.\n\nHe transformed into his destructive crab mode and took off after Rat\nTrap and Tuscon!\n\nOOC: I think that Cyclonus and Scourge and the rest are somewhat\nseparate from all this for them not to be involved, so I will post for\nthem in a different letter.\n\nPreston\n(Zarak-Scorponok)\n\n"}}
