Unlike \n&gt; Maxima, Empath looks much like her original Seeker self.  (I doubt \n&gt; Maxima would forget Skywarp&#39;s old girlfriend.)\n&gt; \n\nShe twisted around in her transorganic form to see a Seeker. Her \noptics narrowed as it took a moment to register, her transorganic \nmind not as sharp as her totally metallic meta processor. But the \nvoice & form was familiar enough. A Seeker. She knew what they were & \nhow they were used & why. She had been at odds with Starscream for \nsome time. But the others, especially Skywarp & Thundercracker she \nhad deemed them to be good comrades. \n\nShe smirked evilly, sometimes a trait that she had when she had some \nplans in mind. &quot;Well, a Seeker. Empath, if I am correct.&quot;\n\nThen she was serious. &quot;I hope you haven&#39;t turned Autobot on us?&quot; If \nempath was still a Decepticon & a good Seeker as she was or currently \nis on Cybertron, then she could be trusted with what Maxima had in \nmind.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
