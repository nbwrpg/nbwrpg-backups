Her jetpack boosts her upward.\n\nAiming her missile launcher down, she fires two missiles at \nMotormaster.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;As you wish&quot; Motormaster growls transforming to his truck mode and \nstarts\n&gt; to back away in reverse. Then, abruptly he stops and starts to push \nhis\n&gt; engine hard as he heads towards the small group of robots, Head on\n&gt; collision on his mind.\n\n\n"}}
