I really don&#39;t like use DH, I just was using my\n&gt; snake)\n&gt;\n&gt; Najah fell far of Horn dril and didn&#39;t lose time and stand up his\n&gt; snake-like body, he spat his saliva towards Horn Drill. One of his\n&gt; shoot fell in a rock that burns (His Salive was acyd!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Without lost time, Najah changed at Robot mode  again and in his back\n&gt; appears a couple of rockects. So he took of and he started to shot at\n&gt; Horn Drill while he turned around his enemy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
