Won&#39;t happen \n&gt; again.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon watches the bot he&#39;s facing go into their Beast mode, and a \n&gt; new bot come out to attack him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re outnumbered. Time to even the odds.....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon sees Sideswipes missles comign towards him. He quickly grabs \n&gt; Spears by her pudgy little neck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now you die!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon throughs Spears into the path of the missles.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Ignatius/Bullet\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius and Bullet saw the missles coming. Bullet popped ot his \n&gt; blast shield.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hide behind me!&quot; he yelled at Ignatius.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first misslee hit the shield. It was a volent blast, but \n&gt; everything was alright. The second one hit, and the force this time \n&gt; hit most of the shield, but eventually broke it and the last bit \n&gt; damaged Bullet. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Aaaaahhh!&quot; He screamed. He looked at Bluestreak and Andromena with \n&gt; torturous eyes. He got a wicked simle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Big mistake......&quot; Bullet fired 15 shots at Bluestreak and 10 \nshots \n&gt; at Andromena. Ignatius flew up into the sky and went to Eagel mode. \n&gt; He than did what Eagle&#39;s do best, and dove at a high speed with \nbeak \n&gt; open right at Andromena&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Hammer\n&gt; \n&gt; Ratchet&#39;s shots hit Hammer&#39;s shoulder, causing a huge gash of mech \n&gt; fluid to pour out. Hammer never screamed. He simply summoned up all \n&gt; his anger and let out a fearsome attack. He powered up energy in \nhis \n&gt; horns and let it loose on Ratchet.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Blaze\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze dove out of the way of the optic lazers, which scarred her \nfeet \n&gt; a bit. She hissed and looked at Snow Cat. She got up and went to \nher \n&gt; beast mode, a Bengal. She circled Snow Cat, looking her up and \ndown. \n&gt; At the last moment she pounced and lunged herself at Snow Cat.\n\n\n"}}
