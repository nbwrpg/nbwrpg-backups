In a few seconds, there was a great white shark \nlaying inside Motormaster&#39;s trailer. Stratus opens his mouth to say \nsomething, realizing that he couldn&#39;t breathe. His organic mode \nneeded oxygen!\n\nStratus&#39;s fins flap, trying to get some oxygen into his gills, but \nthere was no water around. In several seconds Stratus transforms into \nhis robot mode, breathing heavily.\n\n&quot;That,&quot; he says, cursing water creatures under his breath, &quot;I don&#39;t \nknow what those are called.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Motormaster dosent bother to wait, as he closes the trailor door, \nand sets\n&gt; off towards the other shuttle. &quot;So, what&#39;s your alternate mode?&quot; he\n&gt; inquires to his passenger, through his speakers in his trailer.\n\n\n"}}
