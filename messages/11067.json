It\nfound \nvarious lifeforms, and randomly chose a beast mode from the list. \nThe \npod opened up, and out stepped a tall bot.  His name was Decadel.  He \nlooked around the area.  It was sandy all around.  But, there was\nsome \nvegetation, by a river.  The Nile River.  He had landed in Egypt.  \nDecadel was curious about what his beast mode was.  \n\n         &quot;Beast Mode!&quot;\n\n            Decadel&#39;s beast mode was....An earthworm!  He wriggled \naround a bit.  Then he went underground and popped up somewhere else. \n His beast mode mode may not be the most charming, but his stealth \ncapabilities were excellent in this form.  He also figured out he had \na vehicle mode, that could only be used underground.  He went \nunderground, and fired his plasma cannons above.  His vehicle mode\nwas \nperfect for ambushing or taking out bots unseen.  He went back to the \nsurface and looked around.\n\n            &quot;Decadel, Terrorize!&quot;\n\n           Yes, you heard him, terrorize!  He was destined to be a \npredacon, but didn&#39;t know it.  He still looks at the predacon\ninsignia \non his shoulders, and wonders what they mean.  He also wonders why he \ntransforms at his name and then the word of &quot;terrorize!&quot;.  He\nwondered \naround a bit, until he saw a base!  He saw a base!  He saw the \npredacon base, but, he didn&#39;t know it was predacon.  He ran up to it \nand observed it.  There must be other bots in there, obviously.  \nFriendly or not, he had to check it out.  He went up to the door and \nknocked.  Surprisingly, the outer defences weren&#39;t opening assault on \nhim.  He knocked on the door again and waited.\n\n                    Decadel\n             Beast mode: Earthworm   Vehicle mode: Subterranean Cannon\n             Bot mode: Sleek, shiny, brown plating.\n             Weapons: bot=two flamethrowers, two shoulder plasma \ncannons and optic lasers.  vehicle=hidden plasma cannons.\n             Side: Predacon\n             Function: Spy(best), Warrior(average)\n\n\n"}}
