Him and his team...\n\nStriker sighs. Prowl was the only one remaining from his group who was alive \nand in action. Him and Prowl. The two most elite members of his elite team. \nStriker&#39;s eyes cloud over slightly. Those had been the good old days... He \nand his team, cruising the galaxy in his ship, The Maximal Hope, going on \nvarious missions for the Maximal elders, meeting interesting bots, saving \nalot of them from Predacon domination.\n\nHe remembered when Prowl was first assigned to his group. The Mission was to \ninfultrate a Predacon fortification, gaining some data and rescuing a few \nMaximal hostages. With Prowl&#39;s planning, they had pulled it off perfectly, \naccidently detonating the fortress in the end...\n\nStriker looks blankly across the clearing, remembering the old days....\n\n"}}
