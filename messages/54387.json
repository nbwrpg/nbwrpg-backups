Step One: find an allie in our \nfight against Maximals. But few tribes offer good perspectives.... \nNWO and Rouges. Step two, Sandtorm plan will be perfect in the \nbattle, but we have to choose the battlefield before MAximals do it. \nStep three, we have to wait until we get news about our spy... &quot;\n\n&quot;But when he speak we us, we can&#39;t tell him  about sabotage the \nMaximal&#39;s shields&quot;replie Hydras.\n\n&quot;He did it&quot;said Perceptor &quot;He has... a lot initiative&quot; said devilish \nPerceptor\n\n&quot;What about the hostage...?&quot;\n\n&quot;We can use a closest of Rodimus anyway&quot;replied Perceptor&quot;Who will \nsuspect that one of the closest friends of Rodimus is a spy who was \nreprogramed to serve us....?&quot; ais Perceptor\n\nLooking to Predacons, Hydras said &quot;Any other suggestion?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;raccoon7679 &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt;&quot; \n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sandstorm thought about the question.\n&gt; Proto nodded. &quot;A cell thats easy, and itll be fool proof as well. \nAs for an \n&gt; alliance I am not one to answer that question since ive been out \nof the loop \n&gt; lately. I have only this to say if one thing is true all preds \nhate preds so \n&gt; if theyre are any other pred tribes out here try them.&quot;\n\n&gt; Sandstorm: If the Predacons have enough men, this could work. A \nfew of us could lead an equal amount of Maximals or more away, give \nthem the impression of dominance, then when they reach some suitable \nhiding places, the rest of us jump them. Eliminate a few Maximals at \na time, just until they catch on, and they&#39;ll soon he outnumbered. \nBut how to make them notice? ... With some of them we could play off \ntheir egos, perhaps, but I&#39;m sure there are those who are looking to \nbe heroes, taking out a Predacon alone would seem very &quot;tough&quot; of \nthem, after all.\n&gt; \n&lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She listened to the discusion.  &quot;I have a recommendation \nCommander. \n&gt; Why not try to attack from several differnt vantage points? First, \n&gt; let the spy think we will take out thier bases main power supply, \n&gt; there by misleading them for surely the spy will tell them of our \n&gt; plan. Then, we send another in to take a hostage. Not the one \nclosest \n&gt; one to thier leader, but the one with most knowlage of thier base \nand \n&gt; weapons and tactics. Then we reprogram that bot to our side. In \nthe \n&gt; mean time, we attack from the front and side with a main assault. \nWe \n&gt; do what damage we can to thier base and leave. With the hostage \n&gt; converted to our side we can find another way to create more \ndamage \n&gt; to them and possable bring them down for good. this is my humble \n&gt; opinion Commander Hydras.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
