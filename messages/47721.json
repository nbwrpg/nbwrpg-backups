The legendary Autobot, who had \ndescided to work on a Maximal ship, made his way to the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Bridge\n&gt; \n&gt; The maximal commander listened as the reports came in, the armory he \nimagined must have looked like a battle hit it. Sighing he righted \nhimself in his chair more fully turning towards the two bots that had \nwalked onto his bridge giving a nod of respect to Hot Rod, it had been \na relative honor to serve alongside one of the more key figures in \ntheir peoples histories.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other seemed to imply he was a criminal of some sort, he didn&#39;t \nreally care in any case. &quot;Armory is only shook up, but reports seem to \nsay the thrusters are off line and quite frankly scrap. We need to get \nexternal sensors up and see just what kind of planet we&#39;ve crashed \nourselves on, once we can see where the slag we are we can go from \nthere...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning he regarded the &#39;criminal&#39;, &quot;I don&#39;t know what in the Matrix \nyou&#39;re talking about. You appear to believe you&#39;re in trouble with the \nlaw but at this point I don&#39;t give a slag what you&#39;ve done. This ship \nis in bad shape, we have a mission to complete and I don&#39;t have time \nto assign personnel to guard you in a brig.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning he looked the bot in the eye, &quot;Help Hot Rod get our \nsensors up and running or report yourself to the CR chambers on deck \ntwo if you&#39;re too injured to help. But if you plan on sticking around \nyou&#39;re gonna help us, now get to it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Swiveling in the chair he regarded the com, &quot;Icedemon and \nArchangel get started on repairs on either the computers or Comm \nsystems. BlackKnight check the ship for any more bots whose comms \nmight be down, injuries to the CR chambers those not functioning, as \nmuch as I hate to say it, we&#39;ll worry about later, priority on the \noperational first.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning back to look out the shattered window he silently hoped \nMegatron was as bad off as they were, if the predicons launched a \npre-emptive strike he doubted the ship could take a beating after the \ncrash. Moving to the computers he began investigating the status of \nthe frigates weapons and defense systems, they weren&#39;t priority one at \nthe moment but he wanted at least something to re-assure the crew they \nweren&#39;t sitting blind and utterly defenseless.\n\n\n"}}
