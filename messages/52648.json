She let it \nall out there.\n\nThe shots entered through the cargo bay and down to the engine room. \nThe shock was terrible.\n\nComputer: Warning. Critical engine hit. Fusion reactor debalanced and \nprotection reduced by 64%. Shielding may hold a maximum of 4 cycles.\n\nTyrael was stunned. Nothing could have done this much damage and still \nbe mounted on any normal transformer. He opened the speakers of all \nthe ship.\n\nTyrael: Attention everyone. Abandon ship. We have sustained critical \ndamages. Abandon ship!\n\nTaking a chip out of the computer, he went at the emergency exit at \nthe back of the bridge and got out of the ship.\n\nSanguine saw the blue and white transformer-like being propelled on \nher jets. She knew what she was.\n\nShe transformed to her made-up robot mode. It was a tall and sturdy \none, which would not be easy to take down.\n\nSanguine: You Vok! I am Reaper! I come for you!\n\nMeteara turned halfway and looked down. It would be a clash to \nremember...\n\n\n"}}
