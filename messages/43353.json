Hell Drak&#39;s eyes\n&gt; were closed tight, waiting for death.  But nothing happened.  She\n&gt; opened her eyes.  Triggerhappy was hit, and fell to his knees, mouth\n&gt; wide open, shocked, and in pain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You.....&quot; Triggerhappy stopped to gasped for air, &quot;Pile of.......&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Triggerhappy fell down on his face, so he was laying on the ground.\n&gt;  Where his face was, a puddle of mechfluid appeared, and mechfluids\n&gt; started spilling from where he had been hit.  The punctures in his\n&gt; metal started to turn into cracks, and mechfluid came out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skullgrin, Jume, and Whee watched as Triggerhappy had been\n&gt; supposedly defeated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;NO!  MY DECEPTIPAL!&quot; Skullgrin shouted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skullgrin transformed into Pretender mode, and had his massive,\n&gt; freaky club.  He ran at AzureBlade and threw a lethal blow to\n&gt; AzureBlade&#39;s head.  Jume and Whee fired at AzureBlade.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;No!  Watch out!&quot; Hell Drak yelled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A light came into her optics, and then she quickly got up and dove\n&gt; at AzureBlade, trying to take him down, but out of the way of\n&gt; damage...\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Surgital suddenly felt something from Ice.  The mind thing.  Pain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;No........not this.......I thought I had forgot about this!&quot;\n&gt; Surgital said, but which Bodicon was saying it, nobody knew.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Surgital didn&#39;t feel physical pain, but a flashback showed up, and\n&gt; would be visible in the minds of both Ice and all the Bodicons.  It\n&gt; was a flashback from Decapitron!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Flashback:  Decapitron was tied to a conveyer belt, with some sort\n&gt; of energon rope.  He was horrified, and was screaming for help.  Then,\n&gt; he went forward, and a bunch of saws and stuff came down!  They\n&gt; started cutting at Decapitron.  All he could do was scream in sheer\n&gt; pain.  Each saw blade had the Autobot symbol engraved on it.\n&gt; Decapitron, still tied onto the conveyer belt, was now heading into a\n&gt; large box thing.  On the way, a heavy thing with an Autobot symbol\n&gt; came down and sort of crushed Decapitron&#39;s head.  Then, Decapitron\n&gt; went into the box thing, which also had an Autobot symbol, and then\n&gt; the doors of the box shut, and then Decapitron was stuck, and he was\n&gt; getting beaten and battered.  After the 10 minute torture process was\n&gt; done in the box, Decapitron kept going.  Mechfluid and oil and stuff\n&gt; were pouring like mad, and he was mangled and dislocated and stuff.\n&gt; Finally, he was at the end, and was dumped off of the conveyer belt\n&gt; and onto the ground.  The last thing he had seen back then when that\n&gt; happened, was Autobots around him, laughing sinisterly with evil eyes\n&gt; and faces.\n&gt; &gt; *Flashback Ends*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Surgital was still...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
