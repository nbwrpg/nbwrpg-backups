I doubt the poll of who \nshould land first will affect that.\n\nBIC:  Gracius (P.S. thanks for the name rAuq) floats a few feet from \nthe floor in the center of a room surrounded by his deciples.\n\nGracius:  Remember my children we are the messengers of peace.  \nSomeday the Maximals and Predicons will have destroyed each other.  \nWe must teach our children the ways of Peace (assuming bots have it \nthey have nothing against intercourse let alone girls joining up they \nwill make no destinction between Monk and Nun).  While fighting is \nneccessary in both bio and techno life killing is not.  That is why \nour code forbides the later, but not the former.  Do you have any \nquestions my children (in other words if you have a char post him \nasking a question so I&#39;ll know he&#39;s there Pegatron&#39;s the only one I \nremember being on board for sure other than Gracius himself).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackknight slightly touched his auditive sensor, where his \ninternal \n&gt; comm unit was. He nodded.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackknight: Roger. I&#39;ll get some detector and look around.\n&gt; \n&gt; He gets a detector, one looking for energy signatures, and managed \nto \n&gt; get out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackknight: Icedemon, Arcangel, I&#39;m going to check around. See you \n&gt; both later!\n&gt; \n&gt; He walks slowly towards the living quarters and activated his \nscanner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackknight: Anybody here?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He slowly starts to move again. The legendary Autobot, who had \n&gt; descided to work on a Maximal ship, made his way to the bridge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; Bridge\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The maximal commander listened as the reports came in, the armory \nhe \n&gt; imagined must have looked like a battle hit it. Sighing he righted \n&gt; himself in his chair more fully turning towards the two bots that \nhad \n&gt; walked onto his bridge giving a nod of respect to Hot Rod, it had \nbeen \n&gt; a relative honor to serve alongside one of the more key figures in \n&gt; their peoples histories.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The other seemed to imply he was a criminal of some sort, he \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; really care in any case. &quot;Armory is only shook up, but reports seem \nto \n&gt; say the thrusters are off line and quite frankly scrap. We need to \nget \n&gt; external sensors up and see just what kind of planet we&#39;ve crashed \n&gt; ourselves on, once we can see where the slag we are we can go from \n&gt; there...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Turning he regarded the &#39;criminal&#39;, &quot;I don&#39;t know what in the \nMatrix \n&gt; you&#39;re talking about. You appear to believe you&#39;re in trouble with \nthe \n&gt; law but at this point I don&#39;t give a slag what you&#39;ve done. This \nship \n&gt; is in bad shape, we have a mission to complete and I don&#39;t have \ntime \n&gt; to assign personnel to guard you in a brig.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Turning he looked the bot in the eye, &quot;Help Hot Rod get our \n&gt; sensors up and running or report yourself to the CR chambers on \ndeck \n&gt; two if you&#39;re too injured to help. But if you plan on sticking \naround \n&gt; you&#39;re gonna help us, now get to it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Swiveling in the chair he regarded the com, &quot;Icedemon and \n&gt; Archangel get started on repairs on either the computers or Comm \n&gt; systems. BlackKnight check the ship for any more bots whose comms \n&gt; might be down, injuries to the CR chambers those not functioning, \nas \n&gt; much as I hate to say it, we&#39;ll worry about later, priority on the \n&gt; operational first.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Turning back to look out the shattered window he silently hoped \n&gt; Megatron was as bad off as they were, if the predicons launched a \n&gt; pre-emptive strike he doubted the ship could take a beating after \nthe \n&gt; crash. Moving to the computers he began investigating the status of \n&gt; the frigates weapons and defense systems, they weren&#39;t priority one \nat \n&gt; the moment but he wanted at least something to re-assure the crew \nthey \n&gt; weren&#39;t sitting blind and utterly defenseless.\n\n\n"}}
