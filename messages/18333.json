He was starting to leak mech fluid.\n\nHis eyes narrow as he aims his launcher, firing it at one of the bigger \nautoguns.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike stops in the forest, being able to see a few of the autoguns \nthrough the trees. Pulling up his missile launcher, he fires a missile at the \nautoguns.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica stabalizes in the air, a few feet above the canopy and out of range \nof most of the shots. Seeing Zardus fire on the autoguns, Reptilica does the \nsame, two missiles flying at the Mafia base&#39;s autoguns.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nExcited at weaponfire, DevilDuer runs forward, stopping when he gets a \ntransmission from Zardus.\n\n&quot;DevilDuer,&quot; the transmission reads, &quot;Can you go back to the Alliance base, \nand get any wounded into the CR chambers? Take any of their wounded and put \nthem in stasis lock during and after repair.&quot;\n\nDevilDuer sighs, putting away his rifle.\n\n&quot;I have to go back to base,&quot; he says over his comm to Najah, &quot;Stay here and \nfight if ya want, I&#39;ll see ya back at base.&quot;\n\nHe turns around, running off toward the Alliance base.\n\n"}}
