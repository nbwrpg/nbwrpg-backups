She had no idea what this place was, and she really didn&#39;t care if \nit was the Maximal&#39;s ancestor&#39;s ship. She only cared about herself. That was \nthe way things went.\n\nShe looked among the Maximals around her. &quot;Primal,&quot; she said, in Dinobot&#39;s \nvoice. &quot;I must speak to Primal!&quot; She pounded her forpaw against the floor.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
