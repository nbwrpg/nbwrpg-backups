Seeing Striker, then Dark \nMouse, then two Predacons.  As well as Suukie.  Raising his gun, he felt a \ntap on his shoulder.  Turning, a swift punch sent him crashing to the ground.\n\n---\n\nManterror laughed as Injector knocked Ramhorn down.  Raising his weapons, he \nfired two ion disks at Dark Mouse from one arm, two others at Striker from \nthe other.\n\n---\n\nInjector punched Ramhorn twice in the face.  Then the Maximal scientist got \nhis feet up against the Predacon&#39;s chest.  Pushing forward hard with his \nlegs, Injector went flying back, crashing into the ground.\n\n"}}
