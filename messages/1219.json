He was in no fighting condition but the call of battle was stronger then the call of his own wellbeing, or it had been.\nBut there was no call now, just the empty and disappointed feeling in which was left after he had been cheated the thrill of a possible victory.\nDinobot looked off towards the Ark now, Tavatron had won. His systems were ready to give out and he was now running low on mech fluid, if he was on the field and fight a battle now he would fall...and fall hard!\nHe looked back at Tavatron and growled low, even though she was correct he was not about to surrender just yet.\nCovered in fluid, damaged and weak he stood and just glared at her, with an actually weak and shallow breath he spoke...*\n\n&quot; And...why does what I do and do not do disturb you so? You almost seem...worried about my welfare. Why?&quot;\n\n* He said this with weakness but a sharp edge was still present in his voice, he had a question and he wanted it answered...quickly!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
