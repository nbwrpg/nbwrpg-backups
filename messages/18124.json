Oh, and if anyone \nis wondering, I&#39;m leaving Nemesis Enforcer and Scattershot out for now \nbecause I&#39;m waiting for Alloran to reply)\n\nSerpentor/Punch/Unitron/Sixshot/Ares/Chaos/Minion/Demon Wulf/Flesh \nRipper/Dark Claw/The Oblitercons:\n\n\n\nUnitron&#39;s right side seared with pain from Stronghold&#39;s missile, and \nUnitron&#39;s mind was racing with evil thoughts of vengance.  Swerving the \ncannon to face Stronghold (Uni is currently a tank), he fired off a blast of \nenergy.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor catches the lightning blast in his back, sending him sprawling \nbackwards.\n\n-------\n\nPunch continues having the autoguns firing upon the Mafia.\n\n-------\n\nDemon Wulf, taking a step forward, is hit in the chest mid-step, falling back \na few feet.  Re-establishing a good stance, Demon Wulf fired off three optic \nblasts at Gigas&#39; abdomen.  \n\n---\n\nDark Claw raised a hand, Shockaract&#39;s blasts striking him the side, Dark Claw \ngetting down to one knee for support, firing off a blue blast of energy from \nhis left palm at Shockaract.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper lets the blasts knocking him back a few feet, taking quick aim, \nseeing the small skirmish between Serge and Burning Hammer, and Serge ending \nup on both knees.  &quot;Ha.&quot; Flesh Ripper said without emotion, firing off four \nblasts from his rifle at Serge&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nChaos transformed to robot mode.  &quot;I&#39;ve got to save my missiles for when they \nare really needed.&quot; he said quickly, an automatic rifle appearing in his \nhands.  He fired off 20 shells at the downed Rizopas.\n\n---\n\nMinion yells out as he jumps backwards, the explosion sending him flipping, \nslamming to the ground hard, Minion slowly got up, looking around to try and \nclear his thoughts.\n\n---\n\nDark One pulled up, loading two more missiles, getting ready to make a second \npass.\n\n---\n\nPyro took aim with his cannon (he&#39;s also currently a tank), firing off three \nmore fireballs at Diskus&#39; torso.\n\n---\n\nHiss, the only Oblitercon not in his alternate mode, fell to his back from \nShockaract&#39;s return fire.  On his back, Hiss returned fire with a single \nfusion blast at Shockaract.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown (now a cannon/artillery), fired off a mortar shell at Doom Ice.\n\n---\n\nScavenger transforms to his HUMVEE (I&#39;ve become uncertain about the spelling \nrecently) mode, not wanting to play the speed game.  Going into reverse, the \ntwo machine guns, one mounted on both sides, fired twenty rounds off each, a \ntwenty of forty rounds heading straight for Blender&#39;s legs, Scavenger going \ninto reverse.\n\n---\n\nSixshot sees Gigas fall down, and the STAG transforms into his wolf-creature \nmode (wolf with wings), and dives, his four inch claws outstretched and \npointed at Gigas&#39; back.  &quot;Have fun in the great junkyard in the sky!&quot;\n\n---\n\nAres yells out in anger.  &quot;STUPID IDIOT!  YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DIE!&quot; he \nscreams as anger that had been built up since Unitron crippled the Newcomers \nwas let out, Ares driving in his tank mode straight for Grenade.\n\nTargeting with his weapons, he fired off a total of nine laser blasts (three \nfrom three cannons) at Grenade.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
