I nearly crashed\n&gt; into him when I arrived.  Besides, I have a score to\n&gt; settle with him.  He is here to do what he attempted\n&gt; years ago: destroy the Autobot Matrix.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Organics stepped forward as her step brother brought\n&gt; the pilot with him.\n&gt; &quot;And Unicron has his minions in full force.  They\n&gt; managed to take our brother, a most powerful bounty\n&gt; hunter.  They took him with them, up there,&quot; she\n&gt; said, a little sad and point up, to Unicron.\n&gt; &quot;WHAT?!?&quot; the clone roared, clinching his fists.  \n&gt; Organics rushed to calm the Emperor clone, to some\n&gt; avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Fortuneteller&#39;s jaw dropped, &quot;UNICRON!!!!

He noted how\n&gt; &gt; small her hand was to his, but he wasn&#39;t the\n&gt; average\n&gt; &gt; transformer, and the thought entertained him\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; for a minute grin.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I think it would be best to get to a base.  With\n&gt; &gt; Unicron around, it is dangeous to remain out in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; open.  Perhaps my step sister could arrange\n&gt; &gt; something with the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He lead Fortuneteller to Organics and Ydrassil, to\n&gt; &gt; see both the Maximal&#39;s reaction and speak with\n&gt; &gt; Organics.\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
