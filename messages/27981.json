When the smoke clears, the wall is still there, but very \nbadly damaged and close to giving in. The autoguns target Unitron&#39;s \nhead and the heads of the two bots that he was now attached to. The \ngas filled the room, beginning to seep into any opening it could find \nand attacking the circuitry.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus calmly watched the damage report come up on the screen. He \nsmiles slightly to himself and taps a few buttons. Gas pipes explode \nin the rooms around the room that Unitron was in, flooding those \nrooms with the same neuro-circuitry-destroying gas. The base damage \nddin&#39;t really matter. With the blast doors in place, and considering \nthe size of the base, Zardus didn&#39;t see how Unitron could get out on \ntime. Of course, not seeing didn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t a way.\n\nZardus taps several more keys, half of the blast doors in the area \nlifting and gass filling the corridors inbetween the blast doors.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Unitron/Firestarter/Sixshot/Ares/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Injector/Bumblebee:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron received orders, and was intent on filling them out, \nespecially after \n&gt; this.  &quot;Zardus is a traitor.  If we do not survive this, we will be \nreborn.  \n&gt; I may do something strange my allies, but only focus on freeing \nourselves.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron and the rest got to a far corner of the room, two tendrils \nextending \n&gt; from his forehead, boring into the back of Sixshot and Ares&#39; heads.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter transformed to tank mode, letting loose three sonic \nshells at a \n&gt; corner of the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot took out a missile launcher, firing a missile at the same \ncorner.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares fired off three laser bolts from his rifle at the same corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch raised a pincher, firing two missiles at the same \ncorner.  \n&gt; Raising his tail, he fired off a burst of acid at the same spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror raised his left arm, firing off three ion disks at the \nsame corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector raised a missile launcher, firing two stinger missiles at \nthe corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bumblebee coughed, being the weakest, and was losing concentration.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n\n\n"}}
