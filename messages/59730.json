I mean at the end of the day\nwe&#39;re in an RPG that essentially is international. As\nsuch there are often MASSIVE time zone differences\nbetween some players. I mean I&#39;ve been trying to be\ndiplomatic about the issue, but to be blunt, this\nsituation is really starting to PISS ME OFF!!!!! I&#39;m\nat the moment in the middle of a scene where I can&#39;t\nfairly reply (the attn: maximals one) because people\nare posting 40 replies when I&#39;m either at work or\nasleep.  Airly, you say that the council should\ndiscuss this issue, well tell me, excatly WHEN you\nplan on doing this. The fact is that this is exactly\nin the vein of the split second posting and not\nposting for other characters rule. It effectively\nstops players from being able to play properly, and I\nfor one am getting SICK OF IT!!!!! So how about we\nbypass the discussion and use a little something\ncalled common sense and just be aware of any players\nwho aren&#39;t getting a fair chance to respond.\n\n*gets off soapbox*\n\n --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nI really think we should go with this way in the title\nof our posts. \nIt would make it all easier for everyone, and those\nwho wanted to do \nonly the posts where their chars are concerned could\ndo it much more \neasily.

Would be SOOOO much easier\nespecially on \nsomeone who \n&gt; doesn&#39;t particularly want to read TONS of email that\ndoes not \npertain to them \n&gt; since reading something I really don&#39;t need to know\ncan confuse. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Much appreciated, :: again bows a la Jack Sparrow:: \n&gt; Stac\n&gt; ~Maxima\n\n\nYahoo!
