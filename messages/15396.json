What me to kill &#39;er?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus walks through the halls of the Iron Fist, Panzertron explaining all of \nthe functions to him. So far, he had grasped everything, and had seen how to \nput it to his advantage. Moving the Alliance here would be very rewarding. \nThe only faction with an island base, and shuttles for transport. He could \nalready see a new era emerging...\n\nA comm message snaps him out of his thoughts, DevilDuer&#39;s voice asking him \nwhat to do with Lady Hawk.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t kill her, no,&quot; he replies after apologizing to Panzertron for the \ninterruption, &quot;But don&#39;t let her stay either. Just politely escort her out.&quot;\n\nZardus looks back at Panzertron, the two bots continuing on the tour.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer nods as he recieves Zardus&#39; orders, looking back at Lady Hawk.\n\n&quot;Nope, ya can&#39;t stay,&quot; he says, &quot;But your life ain&#39;t in danger. I was told to \nescort you out, I hope you cooperate.&quot;\n\nHe waves his gun dangeroustly, waiting for a reply.\n\n"}}
