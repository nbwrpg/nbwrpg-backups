He chuckled\nto himself, it had been a first to sabotage a base then have them leave. He\nsmiled, at least there would be none to dispute his new call sign and he\ncould infiltrate the Maximals like he had first planned to upon arriving.\n\n    Sitting down by a tree the panther bot watched the other transformers\nwarily to see what they would do now that the center of their focus was\ngone.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
