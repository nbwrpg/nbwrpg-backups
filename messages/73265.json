Yet his expression changes, one of grave concern.\n\n&quot; Yes, we will n=\r\need stronger defenses.  I don&#39;t think our fight with Magmatron is over by a=\r\nny means.  We won the battle this time by getting everyone to safety but, t=\r\nhere is yet the possibility of retaliation on the enemies part.  I guess yo=\r\nu could call it guardian intuition. The old dragon must have had the same a=\r\nttribute.  Only now, have events escalated and I sense that the reason for =\r\nthat, is because of the dragon&#39;s passing.  He somewhat kept the land free o=\r\nf harm, and not smaller creature dared to challenge him.  But with age, he =\r\nweakened, and even Magmatron who&#39;s strength always outshone his own, realiz=\r\nes that without the guardian, it&#39;s easy pickings.  Well, not anymore.  Now =\r\ninstead of one guardian there are many, and as guardians we need to step up=\r\n our protection. &quot;\n\nHe looks ahead toward home.\n\n&quot; This planet needs a chan=\r\nce to evolve.  And if Nemesis Prime thinks he can destroy this world, I wil=\r\nl not hesitate to show him that no one lays harm on innocent life forms wit=\r\nhout paying a price for their actions.  I&#39;ve been entrusted by the old drag=\r\non, to pick up where he left off, being sure NOTHING LAYS HARM TO THE PLANE=\r\nT HE VOWS TO DEFEND. &quot;\n\nTucson had also changed, he had realized why the dr=\r\nagon had chosen him.  Perhaps it was to help guide Rodimus and the other Ma=\r\nximals but, his primary purpose being the all around Guardian Prime of the =\r\nenvironment and the creatures that lived there.  Rodimus was ready now, he =\r\ngrew all the wiser and he felt that he could lead them to safety and beyond=\r\n.  \n\n&quot; And with that said, I know my purpose now.  Rodimus, the Maximals ha=\r\nve their leader and I am flying next to him.  But this planet needs a guard=\r\nian and I have been chosen to take that position.  I will always help you w=\r\nhen my help is needed, and I will help reinforce the defenses.  But when we=\r\n return I must take my rightful place, the cave that sits overlooking the A=\r\nrk, that is where I must reside.  That is where he stood guard and that is =\r\nwhere I must stand.   And when you hear my voice crack the sky like thunder=\r\n, you will be alerted to danger before it strikes you.&quot;\n\nEven though far aw=\r\nay, Tucson could now see the peak of the cave where he would stand guard an=\r\nd follow the footsteps of the Silver Dragon of the past.\n\n&quot; We have a ways =\r\nto go but, there ahead, we are approaching home.&quot;\n\nLocal artist who special=\r\nizes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n\nI also specia=\r\nlize in hand made crafts.
