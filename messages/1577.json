Wow, what \na fire works show.&quot;\n(She hoped he heard her)\n&quot;ALso I over heard a transmission that the guys in the ship are going to \narrest Hell Beast.&quot;\n(she left her link on in case he desided to respond to her.  She just \nwatched the fight.  The sky was bright and the sun was hot.  She could feel \na small bead of sweat trickle down the side of her face.)\n&quot;Ah well, better him getting fired at then me. hehe&quot;\n(she sat and waited)\n&quot;This little Pred isn&#39;t going to get her tail shot of with out a darned good \nreason.  And I&#39;m not in the habit of saving Maximals.&quot;\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Sinesis snuck away when nobody noticed.....he did not want to stick with \n&gt;that group......he wanted to actually be paid.....that&#39;s what he came here \n&gt;for.....he waled along......he realized that he needed a partner, a partner \n&gt;that would help him with his plan and acheive domination of all teams with \n&gt;him.......he walked on, looking for someone to team with him.....basically, \n&gt;his plan was: destroy the Protohumans, and take over....he needed to find \n&gt;someone that was like him, originally a Predacon.....he walked on........\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
