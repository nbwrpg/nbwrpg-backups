Balance is everything, it&#39;s the blood and\n&gt; heart of every planet, according ta Master Yoketron.  Upset that and chaos\n&gt; ensues.  We gotta stop the chaos before it takes this planet.  I think\n&gt; that&#39;s why that old dragon approached Tucson..  With his temper&#39;n strength,\n&gt; he can sure make a difference as ta how well this planet is protected.  The\n&gt; dragon is wise, strong, and steadfast.   He protects life as if it were his\n&gt; own.  That&#39;s it..  The dragons cave, I bet we can get a lotta answers if we\n&gt; visit the cave.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a smile from LORD ELDER as he shook his head, &quot;I am not\ntalking about the ship that just crashed, I am talking about one that\ncrashed almost a decade ago, the one that is the reason why we have\nthis new Beast Wars.&quot;\n\nELDER gestured broadly, &quot;You see, when that first ship crashed, all\nthe gaurds were killed and it took reinforcements from Cybertron to\nbring at least most of them to justice.&quot; There was a sad look on\nELDER&#39;s face, &quot;But it also started a colonization of Earth. Maximals\nand even Predacons came to Earth.&quot;\n\nFrowning again ELDER looked at POLAR CLAW who nodded back.\n\n&quot;You see.&quot; LORD ELDER continued, &quot;It was at this point that somehow\nMegatron arrived, and of course Optimus Primal and all the rest. But\nwhat we didn&#39;t know at that time was that Unicron also had his own\nminions here on Earth&#39;s moon, assigned to watch the Earth and wait for\na time to attack. And with the arrival of all these . . . &quot; ELDER\nwaved his hand in the air dissmissively, &quot; . . . colonists, they awoke\nand the Beast War began in earnest as now the Earth had a bold new\nenemy and we had a war now on three fronts.&quot;\n\nCrossing his arms over his chest he began to pace, &quot;That was when my\njob became more important than ever.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
