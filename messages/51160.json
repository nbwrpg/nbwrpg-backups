Geez, I wasn&#39;t trying to =\r\nimpersonate you!  I&#39;m not trying to have some sick sort of fun!  Also, I do=\r\n not even want to appear as a &quot;hacker&quot;, I have the decency not to do it.  A=\r\nnd I am no child, and my acts sure as hell aren&#39;t childish.  Do you even un=\r\nderstand why I used cardhead&#39;s, starcasm&#39;s and your email addresses?  First=\r\n of all, you guys never post, so I thought I&#39;d raise the horrible post coun=\r\nt we&#39;ve been getting.  Also, do you think it was &quot;fun&quot; for me to do this?  =\r\nNo, as I claimed before, it wasn&#39;t &quot;fun&quot;.  It was strictly business that ha=\r\nd to be done.  Maybe if you learn not to jump to conclusions and try to cre=\r\nate a picture about somebody who you will never know, you wouldn&#39;t have to =\r\nget angry.  And, if YOU have any decency, you&#39;ll be just like rAuq, cardhea=\r\nd, and Starcasm and not get all childishly fed up about it.  And until then=\r\n, go kiss the nWo&#39;s ass.\n\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\nThe preceding announcement has been p=\r\naid for by the \nNew World Order\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_005C_01C24B99.DCCD0B60\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2719.2200&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;BODY {\n=\r\n\tBACKGROUND-POSITION: left top; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #ff0000; BACKGROUND=\r\n-REPEAT: no-repeat; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#=\r\n000000 background=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;BGSOUND balance=3D0 \nsrc=3D&quot;cid:005a01c24bbb$63cde2=\r\n80$99c99d18@...&quot; volume=3D0 \nloop=3Dinfinite&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV align=3Dcenter&gt;I&#39;m surprised, Daniel.&nbsp; I&#39;m very surprised.&nbsp; Fi=\r\nrst \nof all, what the hell makes you think that there are people trying&nbs=\r\np;to seem \nlike hackers.&nbsp; Now, since you obviously don&#39;t understand th=\r\ne situation, I \nguess I&#39;m going to have to say that I, no surprises, am &quot;Da=\r\nve Finnamore&quot;.&nbsp; \nGeez, I wasn&#39;t trying to impersonate you!&nbsp; I&#39;m n=\r\not trying to have some sick \nsort of fun!&nbsp; Also, I do not even want to=\r\n appear as a &quot;hacker&quot;, I have the \ndecency not to do it.&nbsp; And I am no =\r\nchild, and my acts sure as hell aren&#39;t \nchildish.&nbsp; Do you even underst=\r\nand why I used cardhead&#39;s, starcasm&#39;s and \nyour email addresses?&nbsp; Firs=\r\nt of all, you guys never post, so I thought I&#39;d \nraise the horrible post co=\r\nunt we&#39;ve been getting.&nbsp; Also, do you think \nit&nbsp;was &quot;fun&quot; for me =\r\nto do this?&nbsp; No, as I claimed before, it wasn&#39;t \n&quot;fun&quot;.&nbsp; It was s=\r\ntrictly business that had to be done.&nbsp; Maybe if you \nlearn not to jump=\r\n to conclusions and try to create a picture about somebody who \nyou will ne=\r\nver know, you wouldn&#39;t have&nbsp;to get angry.&nbsp; And, if YOU have \nany =\r\ndecency, you&#39;ll be just like rAuq, cardhead, and Starcasm and not get all \n=\r\nchildishly fed up about it.&nbsp; And until then, go kiss the nWo&#39;s ass.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dcenter&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV \nalign=3Dcenter&gt;-----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Th=\r\ne \npreceding announcement has been paid for by the &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dcent=\r\ner&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New World Order&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STR=\r\nONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;IMG alt=3D&quot;&quot; hspace=3D0 \nsrc=3D&quot;cid:0=\r\n05901c24bbb$63c64160$99c99d18@...&quot; \nalign=3Dbase=\r\nline border=3D0&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_005C_01C24B99.DCCD0B60--\r\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005B_01C24B99.DCCD0B60\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;nWo Hollywood&quot;\r\nContent-ID: &lt;005901c24bbb$63c64160$99c99d18@...&gt;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005B_01C24B99.DCCD0B60\r\nContent-Type: audio/mid;\n\tname=&quot;nwo2.mid&quot;\r\nContent-ID: &lt;005a01c24bbb$63cde280$99c99d18@...&gt;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005B_01C24B99.DCCD0B60--\r\n\n"}}
