It was all about speed, precision, balance, \n&gt;&gt; discipline, grace, and o=\r\nf course effectiveness.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He could see potential in her and turns his =\r\nhead in both Nightlight and \n&gt;&gt; Bumps direction.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Bump&#39;s right, tha=\r\nt&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential \n&gt;&gt; for train&#39;n ya=\r\n as a Ninjabot. You got the right moves, mody, and grace, and \n&gt;&gt; once you&#39;=\r\nre trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Master \n&gt;&gt; Yokitron=\r\n once said, that a student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; rea=\r\nlize it themselves. Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the \n&gt;&gt; traini=\r\nng, just see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training \n&gt;&gt; progr=\r\nam for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt; pe=\r\nrfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra training under your \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n belts.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He positions himself again.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; It would really help b=\r\noth of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta \n&gt;&gt; pull on ya in the pa=\r\nst. The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \n&gt;&gt; that Master Yokit=\r\nron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what could \n&gt;&gt; come down t=\r\nhe pike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less likely ta get \n&gt;&gt; infected =\r\nby negative influences, simply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta \n&gt;&gt; hol=\r\nd onto. Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark. Bad stuff just goes in one \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n way, and out the other. You guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; you. And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be. I bet my spark plu=\r\ngs \n&gt;&gt; that if you and Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta ou=\r\nr level \n&gt;&gt; and that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side=\r\n of the \n&gt;&gt; galaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive. Th=\r\nis type of \n&gt;&gt; strength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony=\r\n. A perfect \n&gt;&gt; balance between spark, soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a =\r\nlotta dexterity \n&gt;&gt; aquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity tha=\r\nt makes even Tucson \n&gt;&gt; Prime a bit different then the traditional Autobot =\r\nCommander. It&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt; difference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off.=\r\n THAT&#39;S the direction \n&gt;&gt; Tucson is gonna take, and if you guys were traine=\r\nd in our art, so more power \n&gt;&gt; to ya.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He then looks to Bump, as th=\r\ne repair bench does its job to repair the \n&gt;&gt; internal damages done to him.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that reminds me... I need new hydraulic s=\r\nhock \n&gt;&gt; absorbers, timing belt, and I know my struts need work, new tires,=\r\n body \n&gt;&gt; work, and Ty Rods fixed. Oh yeah, need a new front and back end a=\r\nlignment \n&gt;&gt; too.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; To repair the damgages to his alt form, he now tr=\r\nansforms into his vehicle \n&gt;&gt; mode, to prepare for the rest of his repairs.=\r\n He also notices a busted \n&gt;&gt; headlight on the left side.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Scrap, th=\r\nrow in a new headlight for the left side, new bumpers, front, \n&gt;&gt; back, sid=\r\ne, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up. Probably because I \n&gt;&gt; smacked t=\r\nhat tree real hard in alt form. After this is all done, I am so \n&gt;&gt; gonna g=\r\nive those preds the bill, literally.

That hurt more than \nanything else.&nbsp; Still does, because soon=\r\ner or later I&#39;m gonna have ta do it \nall over again.&nbsp; I really don&#39;t w=\r\nanna do that but, if we&#39;re gonna get the \nedge on the cons, it may be up ta=\r\n me ta put on the pretender routine \nagain.&nbsp; But this time I&#39;m gonna h=\r\nave ta make it look real.&nbsp; And it \nmight involve me tak&#39;n out one of o=\r\nur own in order ta get back the trust of the \ncons.&nbsp; I really don&#39;t wa=\r\nnna go that route and I hope none of the bosses \nasks me ta do that.&nbsp; =\r\nI dunno if Tucson would ask but I got a funny feel&#39;n \nthat Leo or Rodimus m=\r\night.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out that way but I cant \ndo anything abo=\r\nut that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;He sighs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-spa=\r\nn&quot;&gt;&quot;

It was all \n  about speed, pr=\r\necision, balance, &lt;br&gt;discipline, grace, and of course \n  effectiveness.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;He could see potential in her and turns his head in both \n  Nightlight=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;Bumps direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Bump&#39;s right, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya \n  gott=\r\na learn, but I see a lotta potential &lt;br&gt;for train&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot. You =\r\n\n  got the right moves, mody, and grace, and &lt;br&gt;once you&#39;re trained, there=\r\n&#39;s \n  gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Master &lt;br&gt;Yokitron once said, th=\r\nat a \n  student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t &lt;br&gt;realize it the=\r\nmselves. \n  Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the &lt;br&gt;training, just=\r\n see me after \n  we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training &lt;br&gt;program fo=\r\nr ya. Hmm, maybe \n  Rodimus might wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s a &lt;br&gt;perf=\r\nect opportunity for \n  both of you ta get some extra training under your &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;belts.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He \n  positions himself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; It would really he=\r\nlp both of you out a lot, \n  see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta &lt;br&gt;pull on ya in=\r\n the past. The reason why it \n  didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is &lt;br&gt;that Ma=\r\nster Yokitron&#39;s training sorta \n  prepared us spiritually for what could &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;come down the pike. Clear minds \n  empty of thoughts are less likely ta g=\r\net &lt;br&gt;infected by negative influences, \n  simply because there&#39;s no though=\r\nt energy ta &lt;br&gt;hold onto. Clear mind, clear \n  soul, clear spark. Bad stuf=\r\nf just goes in one &lt;br&gt;way, and out the other. You \n  guys had a lot on you=\r\nr minds when Hydras took &lt;br&gt;you. And that couldn&#39;t be \n  helped, but now i=\r\nt can be. I bet my spark plugs &lt;br&gt;that if you and Rodimus \n  train with me=\r\n, I can get both of ya up ta our level &lt;br&gt;and that&#39;ll make you a \n  pair o=\r\nf the strongest Autobots this side of the &lt;br&gt;galaxy, but not the type \n  o=\r\nf strength most warriors perceive. This type of &lt;br&gt;strength is the strengt=\r\nh \n  of spirit, inner peace, and harmony. A perfect &lt;br&gt;balance between spa=\r\nrk, \n  soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dexterity &lt;br&gt;aquired in N=\r\ninjabot \n  training, the type of dexterity that makes even Tucson &lt;br&gt;Prime=\r\n a bit \n  different then the traditional Autobot Commander. It&#39;s a &lt;br&gt;diff=\r\nerence Hydras \n  has no inclination how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the direction &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Tucson is gonna \n  take, and if you guys were trained in our art, so mor=\r\ne power &lt;br&gt;to \n  ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then looks to Bump, as the repair bench do=\r\nes its job to repair \n  the &lt;br&gt;internal damages done to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot; Spea=\r\nkn&#39; of performance, that \n  reminds me... I need new hydraulic shock &lt;br&gt;ab=\r\nsorbers, timing belt, and I \n  know my struts need work, new tires, body &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;work, and Ty Rods fixed. Oh \n  yeah, need a new front and back end alignm=\r\nent &lt;br&gt;too.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To repair the \n  damgages to his alt form, he now tran=\r\nsforms into his vehicle &lt;br&gt;mode, to \n  prepare for the rest of his repairs=\r\n. He also notices a busted &lt;br&gt;headlight on \n  the left side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Scrap=\r\n, throw in a new headlight for the left side, new \n  bumpers, front, &lt;br&gt;ba=\r\nck, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up. \n  Probably because I &lt;br=\r\n&gt;smacked that tree real hard in alt form. After this is \n  all done, I am s=\r\no &lt;br&gt;gonna give those preds the bill, literally. In other \n  words, I need=\r\n a total &lt;br&gt;overhaul ta my alt form. And if you can help it, I&#39;d \n  like t=\r\na hold onta this &lt;br&gt;one for a while.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwr=\r\npg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Super \n =\r\n Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &lt;OLD&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight Stood up And leave her \n  daughter=\r\n in the bed, she smiled and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; said&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; to her \n  daugh=\r\nter &quot;I be righ back in no time, just remain here&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  &=\r\ngt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight \n  =\r\nsmiled and she walked toward the interior of the cr, she &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  l=\r\nooked&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; to Bump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive=\r\n \n  skills that I &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n  &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT quizzically, =\r\n&quot;What do \n  you mean?&quot; He&lt;br&gt;&gt; manipulated a few controls on his screen.=\r\n &quot;If you are \n  looking for a&lt;br&gt;&gt; specific ability, I can see what I ca=\r\nn do, but as far as \n  skills, that&lt;br&gt;&gt; is something you learn.
