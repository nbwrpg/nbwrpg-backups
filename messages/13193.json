Is he available?&quot;\n\n* Just then she noticed the two bots at the door, SilverSting and HotRod. \nSmiling that them and motioning for them to come over to the small groupe.*\n\n&quot; Welcome, Gentlebots. Can I help you?&quot;\n\n* She noticed that Prowl had sat down fairly close to her but she pretends \nnot to notice, knowing that now she had him right where she wanted him.\nOoo! She was going to make him squirm!\nIron Raptor leaned further back on her hands and crossed her legs the other \nway, all right in front of Prowl.\nHer optics narrowed a bit in a sly look, now her revenge began.*\n\n&lt; Call me a truck! No truck&#39;s got curves like these, babe.&gt; * her mind \nthought as she continued to look at SilverSting and HotRod.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
