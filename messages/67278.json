Also, the base&#39;s\n&gt; computers will\n&gt; detect the missles but they wont set of an alarm in the base, the\n&gt; security\n&gt; systems are not connected to the scanner.  I need to stress that the\n&gt; Pasificus base is really low-tech.  (that&#39;s not to say that Atlantis&#39;\n&gt; alarms\n&gt; might now be going off around the city - which I&#39;ll have happen in my\n&gt; next\n&gt; post).\n&gt; \n&gt; One last note, be careful not to write for other people&#39;s characters\n&gt; and\n&gt; property.  For example, the owner of Rodimus would have had to give\n&gt; you\n&gt; permission for you to tell us what he&#39;s seeing, same with describing\n&gt; what\n&gt; Trelos is doing and how the base reacts to the missile.  I have no\n&gt; problem\n&gt; with what&#39;s happening in the story, but this is one of the main rules\n&gt; of\n&gt; Play by Email rpg&#39;s; its called moding, and at one time was forbidden\n&gt; by the\n&gt; rules of this group.  You can say the missiles fly toward the towers\n&gt; or\n&gt; characters, but you cannot say the result of the attack in the same\n&gt; post.\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry that I haven&#39;t found a rules-section to place on the wiki\n&gt; yet.\n&gt; Again, no harm-no foul.   Just try to be careful not to overreach\n&gt; your\n&gt; scope.  :P\n&gt; \n&gt; On 10/25/07, supercyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   From the brightening side of the moon a large wave of something\n&gt; rose\n&gt; &gt; from its surface. Red like the landscape it flew from, it rose into\n&gt; &gt; the air. Then with a smooth twist of hue it turned black as the\n&gt; &gt; shadows of space enveloped it. Like some black fog hunter-\n&gt; &gt; terminators, or sweeps as some call them, along with their leader\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, gathered themselves under the direction of the mighty\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus. Then with lightening swiftness boosters flared turning\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; surface of the moon crimson for the briefest of moments before they\n&gt; &gt; struck out across open space, moving with precision and ease toward\n&gt; &gt; the unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside the pacifist Maximal base in Atlantis the computers\n&gt; continued\n&gt; &gt; to monitor the grounds, primarily attempting to keep track of the\n&gt; &gt; fleeing Trelos. But as always a few cones were pointed skyward,\n&gt; &gt; always on the look out for Minions. What they saw today the\n&gt; computers\n&gt; &gt; had no way to understand. Something that was there and yet not\n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; The slightest bit of distortion, that under normal circumstances\n&gt; &gt; would have been ignored, but in this case was large, and worse yet,\n&gt; &gt; it was moving. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisibility when he\n&gt; moved)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A yellow warning light began to go off in the pacifist command\n&gt; &gt; center, as the computer screen automatically projected course and\n&gt; &gt; heading. Approximated heading: Atlantis. Unfortunately no one was\n&gt; &gt; there to notice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the grounds of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as\n&gt; several\n&gt; &gt; Maximals attempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from his\n&gt; &gt; newest hiding spot, underwater. One boat is on the water obviously\n&gt; &gt; searching, while a floating car hovers over the waters doing its\n&gt; own\n&gt; &gt; search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd dot in the skies,\n&gt; &gt; one that he can see to be a Predacon eagle. He is pointing at it.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; even as he is doing this he notes something strange coming from\n&gt; &gt; behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and ripple,\n&gt; &gt; almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to the\n&gt; &gt; flashes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus pointing at\n&gt; &gt; him, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over open\n&gt; &gt; water, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In either\n&gt; case\n&gt; &gt; he is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming as his enhanced\n&gt; &gt; vision sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling\n&gt; &gt; flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin to go off as base computers\n&gt; &gt; do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Erupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the skies,\n&gt; &gt; vortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone shaped\n&gt; &gt; contrails. They slam into communication towers, and the towers as\n&gt; &gt; well as a few outlying buildings burst into flames.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the background, almost unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of the\n&gt; &gt; skies, the recipient of several laser blasts. Small gouts of flames\n&gt; &gt; flowing from him even as he impacts the water. Myrmidon sinks\n&gt; beneath\n&gt; &gt; the waves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And flying from amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises high into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; air.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The days you have known are over. All that you have belongs to us!\n&gt; &gt; Resist and be destroyed!! THE MINIONS OF UNICRON HAVE COME!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even Cyclonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming to almost darken the\n&gt; skies\n&gt; &gt; for a momsnt, disintegrator blasts providing bright flashes of\n&gt; light\n&gt; &gt; as they bath Atlantis and the Maximal base in war.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I am sure other Maximal and Predacon bases/HQ&#39;s will note\n&gt; &gt; something similar to what the Maximal base in Atlantis noted, feel\n&gt; &gt; free for anyone to jump in, if it makes sense.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The only thing of note is that the Sweeps and Scourge cannot be\n&gt; &gt; locked on to with sensors (check out their profiles on wiki). That\n&gt; &gt; should not affect most of you very much, since most of you shoot by\n&gt; &gt; sight anyways, unless you are using base sensors or some remote\n&gt; &gt; sensing capability.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also any Minions that chose to come with are in this group as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
