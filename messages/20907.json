The nine foot tall Vehement stepped out of the CR chamber, heading \nfor the bridge.\n\nVehement arrived on the bridge, looking to his two soldiers.\n&quot;What have you found so far?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Archbishop, there are several bases.  There is an area where two bases \nare together.  I believe that&#39;s where the strongest faction resides.  It&#39;s on \nan island also, and I&#39;m detecting over twenty-five different energy \nsigantures.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmm...that&#39;s many for Earth.  I&#39;m surprised.&quot; Vehement replied.  &quot;Go on.  \nIs anyone near us?  Where are we?&quot;\n\n&quot;We are in what will be known as Ulaanbaator, Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in \nthe continent of Asia.  There is no one that close to us.  We are surrounded \nby complete desert.&quot;\n\nVehement looked to Reflector and Sun Crusher.  &quot;Open up a comm. transmission \nto ALL frequencies.  I will speak.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, Archbishop.&quot; Reflector replied, going to his terminal and pressing in a \nfew commands.\n\n\n\n&quot;Attention, all residents of Past Earth.  I am Vehement.  My battlecruiser \nhas crashed on this planet as I&#39;m sure you know by now.  My base is badly \ndamaged and is in need of serious repair.  Any assistance would be thankful.&quot; \nhe signaled Reflector to end the transmission.  &quot;Play that continously for \nfive mega-cycles.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Sun Crusher said, walking over to Reflector&#39;s terminal and \npressing a few commands.  &quot;Done.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good.  What is the status of the base?&quot;\n\n&quot;Surprisingly,&quot; Sun Crusher said with a smile, &quot;all weapons are intact, all \nCR pools and chambers are fully functional, and our shields and other primary \nsystems are intact.  Energy reserves are down to 74% though, and there are \nseveral breaches in the hull.&quot;\n\n&quot;How long would it take to repair the hull?&quot;\n\n&quot;A mega-cycle.  They aren&#39;t bad.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do we have any solar panels?&quot;  \n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good.  Set those up.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;ll take two mega-cycles.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll keep defenses active while you do that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Understood.&quot; Sun Crusher acknowledge, him and Reflector walking out of the \nbridge.\n\nVehement sat in his command chair, smiling as the transmission continuously \nplayed to all bases and everyone on Earth.\n\n"}}
