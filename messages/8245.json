She must be \naround. He tried to focus his optics, still feeling drained and weighed \ndown.\n\n&quot;KitKat?&quot; he mumbled lowly. He slowly lifted his chest up, trying get up. He \nlooked at his arms and saw that there were black wires on them. His face \nfroze, staring at them.\n\nWhere on Earth was he? His mind paniced, now realizing that he was alone. \nStingtra wasn&#39;t with him. He looked around. There were trains of electric \nstreaming around the walls of the cave. There were pulsing sounds, lights \nhere and there, and markings on the ground.\n\nHe looked to the right of himself and saw of pile of scrap metal; some \nthings he reconized.\n\n&quot;What in--&quot; A painful surge of electric hit his body. He screamed, and his \nupper body was pulled up.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
