He was\n&gt; ecstatic about the change, yet he couldn&#39;t quite express that joy in front\n&gt; of Hydras, Cyclonus, Scorponok, or Rodimus, in fear of exposing his true\n&gt; faction.  Instead he makes a rather angry scowl.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slag!  Son of a Glitch! How&#39;d he do that?!  I swear I kicked his aft from\n&gt; here ta the next galaxy, I don&#39;t get it!  Look, I dunno how he did that, and\n&gt; when he did it, but he just snatched up the power from Prime&#39;s matrix!\n&gt; Should&#39;ve expected it though, seen&#39; he&#39;s actually related ta the bot.  Okay,\n&gt; so what I got ta tell ya is I think he&#39;s plann&#39;n an all out assault on you\n&gt; guys, like tryn&#39; ta take this place for the Maximals and Autobots.  Wants ta\n&gt; level the fortress ta the ground.  What I think we gotta do is beat &#39;em at\n&gt; his own game.  And he knows we&#39;re gonna try&#39;n get at the Ark, and if we go\n&gt; there, we&#39;re done for.  See? It&#39;s not easy gettn&#39; around the guy because he\n&gt; ain&#39;t your average scrap heap.  He don&#39;t think like an average Autobot.  So,\n&gt; if I were you guys, that shell program you got gon&#39; on, I think ya better\n&gt; have a bot make a backup of that&#39;n hold onto it.  Because he&#39;s gonna try&#39;n\n&gt; blow this place sky high, and everything with it.  And as far as I know\n&gt; he&#39;ll be barrelln&#39; in here with the rest of his posse any time now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course he was telling them a complete lie, hoping they&#39;d buy it.  His\n&gt; tone shows no indication of telling a fib.  Inside he was hoping that his\n&gt; idea mixed with Tucson&#39;s would take hold.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Speak&quot;said the male to Cyclonus\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Next to Hydras a small view screen came to life and began to show a\n&gt;&gt; short clip of a large truck like vehicle that was leaving the Ark,\n&gt;&gt; bearing a distinctive likeness to Optimus Prime, almost like a cross\n&gt;&gt; between his Earthen mode and his original cybertronian mode. There was\n&gt;&gt; the cab front and the trailer on back, the trailer sporting two large\n&gt;&gt; and fearsome looking missiles. The truck looked powerful enough and\n&gt;&gt; regugged enough to roll over the most inhospitable terrain without\n&gt;&gt; slowing. It was currently moving at a sedate 55 mph.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;From the reading I am getting that is . . . or was . . .
