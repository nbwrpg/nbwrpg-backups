Now, I will be back, but I=\r\n would like to show Talon the land outside&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ark, the =\r\nland we will now protect for all time. Nightshift, whoever did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; that to you will pay a price, I promise you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightshift nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Go=\r\ntchya. Slag this hurts...&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY and then BUMP and SANTON come over to examine =\r\nNIGHTSHIFT, all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of them running various scanners over his leg=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It is both tracker and scanner.&quot; LEGACY sai=\r\nd carefully as he examined&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the evidence his scanners were giv=\r\ning him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; SANTON nodded, &quot;Yes, but it is also c=\r\nonverting him into a more metalized form.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; BUM=\r\nP looked pensively at his own scanner, &quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t think that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; was its original pupose.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a c=\r\nautious look from SANTON and then a nod of agreement, &quot;It&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; loo=\r\nks like it was made to be used on standard Cybertronians and it is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; having trouble with the beast modes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LE=\r\nGACY looked down at NIGHTSHIFT and then over at RODIMUS and TUCSON,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &quot;If it was made for standard Cybertronians then what is it doing&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; here?&quot; He said curiously. &quot;I cannot imagine they could have&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; successfully stolen it from Cybertron.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; There was a snort from SANTON, &quot;And who were they intending to use on&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it on. It looks like in the end it was suppose to be a weapon.=\r\n&quot; SANTON&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; gestured at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;I think the only reason rea=\r\nson he is still&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; alive is because he was shot while in Beast m=\r\node.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; BUMP who was still kneeling over NIGHTSH=\r\nIFT nodded, &quot;Whatever you do,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; do not go back to robot mode ri=\r\nght now.&quot; He said to NIGHTSHIFT, his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tones grim.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email -=\r\n-&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-52BCBCB1-7972-4234-A6A0-341FBF8723CE--\r\n\n"}}
