Stay with me, do not leave \nme alone.&quot; the Hunter Killer said, trying to reach out for the voice \nof the femme with him.\n&gt; Fear was etched on his face.  He was a completely differant bot \nnow, once enjoyed solitude, now afraid to be alone.  But it will \npass, once he has recovered his former power.\n&gt; &quot;Stay with me.
