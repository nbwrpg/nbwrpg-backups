Step back, the form I have chosen is \nquite....interesting.&quot; He said and stepped back as the lid poped open.\n    The halwk looked at him. &quot;What is it?&quot; And then looked to the pod. (This \nis where the owner of the bot steps in...hint hint....)\n\n    Megatron saw the pod, and slammed is fist down. &quot;Damn it! There after \nthat pod! Argh!!!!!! I want that pod!&quot;\n\n"}}
