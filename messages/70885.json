I&#39;ve been waitn&#39; for this day for=\r\n a looong time.  Hydras will think twice before he messes with us again. No=\r\nw, I think our best bet, will be ta go off road, like Tucson says.  I know =\r\nthere&#39;s a river bed along the route, we keep ta that, we make no dust, and =\r\nwe leave no scent.  The water isn&#39;t too deep, so we got a shot at gettn&#39; a =\r\ngood distance without gettn&#39; our engines flooded.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot;=\r\nSounds like the best way ta go.  But keep in mind Night Shift, don&#39;t get to=\r\no ahead of us okay?&quot;\n\nNight Shift flashes a headlight.\n\n&quot;No sweat, I promis=\r\ne, I won&#39;t get too far ahead.  I&#39;m not much inta go&#39;n too fast anyway.  The=\r\n faster tires roll, the more dirt we kick up.  Like Tucson says, slow, stea=\r\ndy and silent.  Best way ta get the job done.  And hopefully we&#39;ll catch up=\r\n ta Cheetor.&quot;\n\nAs Rat Trap begins the next phase of the operation, he secur=\r\nes himself in Windlord&#39;s talons, looking around as well as straight ahead, =\r\nto their destination.\n\n&quot;Hmm, so far so good Windlord... But I can&#39;t help th=\r\ninkn&#39; that this could be too good ta be true..  Ya never know when a Pred&#39;s=\r\n gonna come outa nowhere for an unexpected ambush.  I&#39;ll keep my ears&#39;n nos=\r\ne peeled for trouble.&quot;\n\nTucson acknowledges Perceptor&#39;s reply.\n\n&quot; I copy th=\r\nat Perceptor.  You&#39;re doing the best you can, and that is all I expect from=\r\n you.  If things do not work out for some reason, do not blame yourself for=\r\n something you can not control.  This was all brought about by Hydras, and =\r\nI promise you he will pay the price for his torments.&quot;\n\nHe slowly moves int=\r\no position, rolling on silent tires.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m going to start moving in slowly=\r\n, behind Rat Trap, Windlord, Kup and Night Shift.  I have a feeling they wi=\r\nll need reinforcements.  Lord Elder, I need you to begin guiding me along t=\r\nhe river bed trail. Like the others, going off road is our best chance of g=\r\noing unseen and unheard.  But be careful, if you drive me into dense vegita=\r\ntion I will stirr up the brush and that will look suspcious.  Best bet is t=\r\no keep along the area of the river bed, where vegitation is sparce.&quot;\n\nBack =\r\nat the Ark, Quickstride keeps his eyes, ears, and nose peeled for pending d=\r\nanger.  He takes in the air with deep nostrills, yet appearing to be doing =\r\nwhat horses normally do, just simply grazing on the grasses, while keeping =\r\nan eye out for what&#39;s all around him.\n\n&quot; So far so good Rodimus, but ta me,=\r\n things look a little too quiet.. You would&#39;ve thought by now someone would=\r\n catch onto something..  Maybe the plan is working but losing Cheetor&#39;s sig=\r\nnal so early in the game, that&#39;s a little troubling... &quot;\n\nHe lifts his head=\r\n up while looking around.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightst=\r\nar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; KUP/Windlord/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup smiled and s=\r\naid to Nightshift &quot;It&#39;s time to go to our positions&quot; and \n&gt; with Straight s=\r\nhot in his shoulder he started to move.

What now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson rumbles his en=\r\ngine a bit, signalling a hint of anger, yet controlled. \n&gt; He knew if he ch=\r\narged and gave into his emotions it would blow the entire \n&gt; operation out =\r\nof the water.  He did not want to do that.  He thinks for a \n&gt; moment.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot; According to Cheetor, we have our work cut out for us.  We have a magma =\r\n\n&gt; chamber around the fortress, temperature enhanced armor around the tower=\r\n of \n&gt; the complex, which to many of us who can not fly, will not be able t=\r\no access \n&gt; easilly.  Talon, you can fly, thus you have a better chance at =\r\nreaching your \n&gt; destination than I do.  I think I need to reiterate this s=\r\ntrategy a bit. \n&gt; Talon, Wind Lord, if you can, try to fly Night Shift into=\r\n the fortress as \n&gt; soon as he&#39;s found a route that gets you close enough t=\r\no the fortress.  As \n&gt; soon as he is, he can gain access into the complex s=\r\ntill without being seen \n&gt; or heard.  But this may mean we have to find a w=\r\nay to cloak your own \n&gt; signatures...  And you may be out of range of my so=\r\nnar systems at that \n&gt; point..  Lord Elder, you will remain with me, I coul=\r\nd use your imput to \n&gt; guide us and I need a driver obviously..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat T=\r\nrap raises a paw.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheels, I think I got a better idea.  Instead of se=\r\nnding Night Shift, why \n&gt; not send me instead?  I&#39;m small enough and only o=\r\nne person has ta carry me \n&gt; in.  No offense, Night Shift, but I am a lot l=\r\nighter.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s cool, no, it&#39;s a good idea.  Be=\r\ncause if you can get in there before \n&gt; me, you could probably disable the =\r\ncontrols that alter the temperature of \n&gt; the fortress armor..  Yeah, that&#39;=\r\nll definitely work for all of us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson turns to Night Shift.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nI have to admit, that is a good idea.  It pays to listen to comrades.  All =\r\n\n&gt; right then, first, Windlord, if you could, carry Rat Trap in the most sa=\r\nfest \n&gt; possible route to the fortress, get him close enough to the complex=\r\n where he \n&gt; can be unseen and unheard.  From there he may be able to disab=\r\nle the \n&gt; software that controls the security system.  Perceptor, you will =\r\nbe needed \n&gt; to keep Rat Trap updated, so he can navigate properly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\nat Trap smiles as does Night Shift.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson then turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot; As originally planned, I will send word to you if things go awry. I have=\r\n \n&gt; learned that now is not the time to go on personal crusades, but time t=\r\no \n&gt; collaborate with others to become a greater force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He straigthen=\r\ns out his trailer, and positions himself at the exit door.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right,=\r\n now is the time.  Phase two.  Windlord, Rat Trap, depart.  And \n&gt; good luc=\r\nk to you both.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap Nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Okay Windlord, ready when you ar=\r\ne.  Geeze it feels good ta be back in \n&gt; action again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson now tur=\r\nns to Kup and Straight Shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Since we&#39;ve had to alter our plans some=\r\nwhat, you will move in with Night \n&gt; Shift, as soon as Rat Trap is able to =\r\ndisable some of the security systems. \n&gt; It will make easier passage for al=\r\nl of you.  Night Shift will alert you to \n&gt; pending danger, as is his fines=\r\nt attribute on the battle field.

His engine rumbles at the start yet runs quietly after being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; star=\r\nted, which was a signature trade mark of his previous vehicle form,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nho&#39;s engine was barely even heard when standing idol. Night Shift also\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; gets into vehicle form, opening his doors to Windlord and Perceptor. His\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engine silences after being started yet remains idol.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; N=\r\night Shift, as soon as Cheetor comes back, and relays the intel, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwill slowly advance into position with Perceptor and Windlord. Take your\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; time, we are not rushing into this because the faster we travel, the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; faster we will raise suspicion. Feel free to take any path you wish.

I also plan to send a mild sonar wave which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should mask all our sig=\r\nnatures, including those of Perceptors, by using \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; signal conf=\r\niguration code. I haven&#39;t tried doing that but I do know my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sonar sys=\r\ntem can work around various codes and configure a buffer that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will no=\r\nt harm anyone who isn&#39;t under our signature.

He sniffs t=\r\nhe ground and as part \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the illusion, nibbles at a few blades=\r\n of grass. Yet, his ears remain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused on the task at hand as does h=\r\nis eyes and nose.
