Megatron&#39;s toast right now (or will be soon), so \nOwlhawk couldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have been attacking him. =p\n\n--Megatron/Switchblade--\n\nMegatron&#39;s auditory cicuitry managed to to emit a short sound, &quot;Noo--\n-&quot;. The shearing white blade of immesurable energy slammed into his \nlarge dragonlike robot form. His armour was quickly destroying his \narmour, and bits of his inner circuitry. The bot was thrown \nbackwards a good 50 feet and the final fall tore his torso in two. \nAll that could be seen of Megatron was a charred, severly damaged \nheap of slag, consisiting only of Megatron&#39;s general form. Lucky for \nthe Predacon leader, the weapon didn&#39;t stay focused on Megatron \nlong, and it hit him above his spark, so the spark still survived.\n\nSwitchblade loses control of the artifact, and his circuits overload \nwith the intense release of energy. The artifact shatters into \npieces, one dropping to his feet, and the other three disappearing \nin what looks like a sort of translocation like release of energy. \nThey quite frankly were there one instant, and gone the next.\n\nSwitchblade crumples up into a heap as the artifact pieces finish \ntheir massive display. He hits the ground before the single \nremaining pieces does. The apparently fragile piece proves to be \nmore durable than thought as it hits the ground, and stops moving \nwith a clattering sound. Switchblade&#39;s sensors start recovering from \nthe overload, and his green eyes flicker several times before \nreturning to their usual erie dark greenish glow.\n\nHis systems stablizing, he speaks slowly, &quot;...uhh...whoa...&quot; and \nstarts testing out the funcionality in his legs and arms. Seeing \nthat they were fine, he gets to his feet, almost still in a daze. He \nlooks down and spots the single piece of the artifact. &quot;Hmm, I \nthought that I found 4 of them...&quot; He stoops down to pick up the \nremaining piece, then notices the larged slag like slashed hole in \nthe side of the storage room. He looks back at the piece of the \nartifact, and then back at the hold again. Shaking his head, he \nwalks over to the hole, and peeks through, and sees a path of \ndestruction cut through some trees, and such. He doesn&#39;t see \nMegatron, so he leaves the hole, and heads for the ship&#39;s exit.\n\n\n\n"}}
