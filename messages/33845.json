He looks around for any down and out robots,\nand sees Firedrill struggleing with Headstrong. He is torn to do his\nduty, but longs for the fight. But he pushes that behind himself and\nruns up to First Aid. He leans down, and grabs the damaged Protectobot\nwith both hands, and lets out a large grunt. He strains hardly, and\nbegins to drag Firstaid&#39;s body away from the chaos.\n\nFiredrill desperately holds on to Headstrong, but the raging Predacon is\nto much, and flips him of. Luckily he lands on his feet, and quickly\nswings his shielding on his arm, intercepting a swing from Headstrong&#39;s\nsword.\n\n"}}
