Aracnia was in control, Rampage was just going to \nhae to learn. But she would need a little more muscle if she was going to \ntake the throne....\n    She took a seat at the scanners, not even glanceing at the giant crab \nsitting on his lazy rear doing nothing.  She turned on the scanners to see a \nnew Predacon male, a large, very powerfuly armed, Predacon male nearing the \nship. \n    Her eyes lit up and she dashed from the ship, down the ramp. Armed with \nher bowcaster she made her way into the forest that surrounded the ship.\nOOC: Im not comfortable with the Predacon ship being in the desert. I would \nlike it somewhere with a little more dense foliage. On the edge of a jungle \nor somewhere.\n    Aracnia saw him. He was crimsom from head to toe, except he had black \nknee and elbow armor, and black armor on his chest. His eyes glowed like two \nemeralds in a firestorm.\n    \n    Paralysis saw the widow for a good five minutes sneaking around like she \nthought she was totally hidden from him. The toad was smarter than that. He \nused Invra-red scanning and found her ducking behinde a bsh, stareing.\n    &quot;Ah, a Predacon mistress. Now I can get some answers....&quot; He trailed off \nthudding closer to her tiny body.\n\n    She gasped, &quot;He must see me!&quot;\n    Black Aracnia grabbed her bowcaster and shot up through the leaves to \nfind Paralysis&#39; large muscular body looming over her, holding his pisol to \nher.\n    She hissed, &quot;Dont try anything! I have three others with me watching you \nright now!&quot; Her words were sharp and to the point.\n    The toad pursed his lips and laughed. &quot;Liar. Your alone. I know you are \nbecause my I.R. scanners didnt pick anyone else up.&quot;\n    Aracnia shighed and brought her wepon down, surrendering to this new bot. \nHe seemed to know enough, and was big enough to take out Rampage in a bare \nknuckle fist fight.\n    &quot;So, why are you stalking me?&quot; He asked.\n    Aracnia looked him over. &quot;I didnt want to scare you....or accidently kill \nyou.&quot;\n    He smiled and dropped his wepon into its holster. He put his rather large \nhand on her shoulder. &quot;Ah, I see. Well, prehaps you can take me to the \nPredacon base, if there is one?&quot;\n    Aracnia took her chance. &quot;Im the commander. Well, actually, Im the \nsoon-to-be commander. I just need your help.&quot;\n    His eyes widened at this news. &quot;Oh really?&quot;\n    &quot;Yes. Im going to need a little more muscle to take the thorne. Im the \nsmarter, more involved leader in the ranks. I deserve it.&quot; She said.\n    Paralysis began to move, now with his arms drapping her shoulder. &quot;Lets \nreturn to the base and talk more there. Its starting to rain out here and I \nwould like to see our base of operations.&quot;\n    Aracnia tightened her grip on her bowcaster as she shoved him away. \n&quot;We&#39;ll go to the ship, but touch me agian and you&#39;ll lose that arm!&quot;\n\n"}}
