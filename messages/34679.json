When decoded, the Autobots discovered that the \nDecepticons had spread out, and were trying to dominate other \nregions, and upset the fragile balance of power. The Decepticons \nhad gone to a planet, Earth. (the coordinates were in the \ntransmision) The Autobot Council was troubled. They needed to do \nsomething. The sole proposition to the council came from a young \ncourageous leader; Pacifix. He suggested that they Autobots send \na secret mission to the planet and even the odds, without telling \nthe Decepticons what was going on. That way no power struggles \nwould ensue. \n\nThe Autobot Council, after several long weeks of indecision, came \nto an agreement. The would send Pacifix as the group commander, \nand allow him to choose several bots that he feels are suited for \nthe task. Pacifix took the task solemly and began to pick bots he \nfelt were worth. He chose Jazz as his second in command, he \nchose Metalwarhawk, Bumblebee, Crossroads a strategist, JetV a \nscout. He was forced to leave his best friend, Crotale, behind.\n\nPacifix rose from his partial slumber and yawns. &quot;Hello world.&quot; He \nlooks solemly out the window, a world that he wouldn&#39;t see in a \ncouple of Cybertronian days. A world that he would regret having to \nleave, but the adventure! He had made sure the day before that \nCrotale knew that he was leaving, but he was surprised that he \nhadn&#39;t recieved a message yet. He conacted Crossroads and \nasked him to drop off another message for Crotale, &quot;Crossroads, \nwould you please drop off another message for my friend, Crotale?&quot;\n\nCrossroads, who was streaming down the Cybertron Freeway at \nthe time, gets Pacifix&#39;s, his new boss, message. &quot;Righto boss, I&#39;ll \nhave the message at his door in a sec.&quot; Crossroads downloads the \nmessage and heads on towards Crotale&#39;s last location. He inputs \nthe message into the message machine, as soon as he finds out \nthat Crotale&#39;s still missing. His engins roars to life, and he tears off, \nopening a commlink to Pacifix and relaying the news.\n\nPacifix curses. &quot;Ok thanks Crossroads, make sure to be back at \nthe spaceship in two days, after today, that&#39;s when we leave.&quot; He \nleaves his quarters, and transforms when he gets to the exit. He \nhas a important meeting with the Autobot Council about what he \nmight have to be prepared for.\n\n"}}
