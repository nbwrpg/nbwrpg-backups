Wolf was going to do this for me anyway before he left.  \nJust \n&gt; not quite like this.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:  All of a sudden a canaster of the mutant virus falls and \ninfects \n&gt; a protoform in the middle of the room.  It then comes on line and \n&gt; copies Protohuman and Eagle dna.  It also copies small amounts of \n&gt; Necromancer&#39;s and Veratis&#39;s dna although not enough to effect it&#39;s \n&gt; appearance plenty to give it new powers.  An angle suddenly flies \nfrom \n&gt; the pod and out the base before anyone can stop it.  Anyone got a \n&gt; problem with that?\n\n\n"}}
