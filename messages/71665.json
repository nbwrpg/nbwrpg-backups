I would imagine so in some\ncases. :)\n\nOf course I can&#39;t reveal all the hidden answers yet before the end,\nbut I figured I would open up the floor to anyone who had a question\nor comment I can answer to. Perhaps I can clairify something your\ncharacter does know?\n\nOne thing I can clairify is that when Tuscon seemed to think that when\nNoctorro said Seekers he was not talking of Scourge&#39;s troops. Seekers\ngenerally reference mechs that turn into Jets. Scourge&#39;s guys are\ncalled Sweeps and are different.\n\nBe careful of assumptions, they can lead you down wrong paths. This is\nnot a critism but just helpful advice since we all do it from time to\ntime :)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
