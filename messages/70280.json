I am not sure.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus paused as he looked over Hydras&#39; injuries as best he could,\n&gt; &quot;As for Perceptor.&quot; Cyclonus paused again as he looked at Hydras, not\n&gt; sure how exactly he felt about the Predacon scientist, &quot;Perceptor\n&gt; looked to be siding with Rodimus. When we found him he was in\n&gt; conversation with him, as if planning something.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus continued to help Hydras, &quot;There was an explosion, it looked\n&gt; like one of Perceptors&#39;.  That was how the bots escaped. The explosion\n&gt; blocked us from reaching Tuscon and the others. I absorbed what I\n&gt; could of it, but I don&#39;t know.&quot; Cyclonus shrugged painfully, the\n&gt; extent of his own injuries showing themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t see any sign of Rodimus after that, although the explosion\n&gt; opened up the tunnel that Scorponok had used to tunnel over here\n&gt; several months ago from the Ark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
