She \ncame to the bridge and sniffed around the door way.  She looked \naround and meowed.  She shrugged her shoulders and walked on past the \nbridge.  She slowly made her way to the mess hall.  She walked inside \nand sniffed around.  She smelled food, but was too short to see over \nthe counter tops.  She growled and then walked back up.  She walked \naround and then heard voices coming from a room.  She walked to the \ndoorway and peered inside.  She saw two bots standing over another \nbot who wa laying on a table.  She meowed softly and watched what \nthey were doing.  After a bit, she got bored and walked away.  She \nheaded back to the hallway were Koj had left her.  She layed down on \nthe floor and rested her head on her front paws.  She meowed again \nand looked around.    She wished her parents were there.\n\n\n"}}
