I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; thinking that if a missle can withstand reentry temperatures it can\n&gt; survive her weapon. I guess it is a little hard to grasp. Next time\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to get it right without breaking the rules.

He fired his cannons and\n&gt; another missle but his aim was forced upward causing him to blow a\n&gt; hole in the ceiling and sending the roof down on Arty and Pacifix.\n\n\n"}}
