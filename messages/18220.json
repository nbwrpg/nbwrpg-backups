He was the instrument of Hades. He walked past the bridge \nand saw a bot sitting in a chair. He had been taught how to invade a bots \ndatatracks with out any way of them detecting them doing so. Death lunged \nback as he saw the images of the wrongs he had done. In the customs of his \nfaith. He chose this bot to die. He had been taught by the one called Unicron \nthe art of silence. No one could hear or follow him. He was undetectable by \nthe naked ear. He glided onto the bridge...behind the bot. Not so close so he \ncould detect his presence. He put the  reaper 1 inch from the back of the \nbots neck. The reaper could cut through pure energon. He pulled it back very \nslowly. In full force he pushed it at the back of the bots neck.... proceeded \nto  cut off the bots head.......\n\n"}}
