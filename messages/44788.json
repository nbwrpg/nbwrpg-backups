If an RPG died because of it \nwould be \n&gt;   because no one wanted to go Cybertron (obvious there) or because \nit wasn&#39;t \n&gt;   done right.  Cybertron isn&#39;t really explored that much in the \nAmerican \n&gt;   Transformers cartoon, which is the only one I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d agree \nwith LN, \n&gt;   don&#39;t base it on Beast Machines.  Yuk.  \n&gt; \n&gt;   Also, on Cybertron, we could do more stuff.  In example, the first \ntwo \n&gt;   seasons of TFs, undoubtedly the best but I guess you could say \n&#39;restricted&#39; \n&gt;   to Earth and occassional visits to Earth.  Season three, \nundoubtedly not the \n&gt;   best, did have many episodes OFF of Cybertron and Earth.  Going to \ndifferent \n&gt;   planets, etc.  A good concept there, even if most art and writing \nwas...shall \n&gt;   we say lacking?  Again, season three wasn&#39;t the best but it had a \nLOT of \n&gt;   opportunities that this RPG would have as well.  Not to mention \nwe&#39;d get to \n&gt;   make our own Cybertron and, well, yeah, I went over that.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The biggest problem is we&#39;d have to make our own Cybertron.  I \nmean, we know \n&gt;   what Earth looks like, all the places, the geography.  Buuuut, we \ndon&#39;t know \n&gt;   that for Cybertron and we&#39;d need to create it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   As for the protohumans, early in the RPG people were equipping \nhuge gumby \n&gt;   squads of protohumans with weapons and using them as massively \ndestructive \n&gt;   armies so they were banned, as they should be.  The RPG&#39;s got \nalong fine with \n&gt;   gumbies that can&#39;t fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   -L. Unitron   \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
