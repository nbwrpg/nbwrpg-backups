An insult to\n&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BW/BM stands for?  Laughable, for it&#39;s the other way around.\n&gt; &gt; Transformer&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; came out as Roland, Code, or whatever new name has pointed out, \n12\n&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before BW squirmed its way onto the scene.  Hell, BW was to \ncheap\n&gt; &gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank Welker to do the original Megatron&#39;s voice for the thing \non\n&gt; &gt; the golden\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disk.  It&#39;s only good points were Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward,\n&gt; &gt; both having\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worked on He-Man which was a kick ass cartoon (Secret of the \nSword\n&gt; &gt; baby,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Staying on subject, Transformers: The Movie was an awesome \nmovie.\n&gt; &gt; I won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say it was perfect, it was pretty cheesy how they slipped in the\n&gt; &gt; gay new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Autobots.  But that&#39;s what happens when it&#39;s governed by toy\n&gt; &gt; sales.  Anyway,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the tactic with the ship was smart and served its purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They were trying to get the Dinobots in there because they \nwanted\n&gt; &gt; to get the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hell out of there, something about a new, fully-powered fleet of\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighters jumping on their tired afts.  And the Dinobots are \nstupid,\n&gt; &gt; what do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you expect?  Grimlock was a genius at one point in the third\n&gt; &gt; season, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s another subject for another time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why were they celebrating at the end?  How many stupid \nquestions do\n&gt; &gt; you have?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  They saved the planet from a giant MONSTER named Unicron that \nwas\n&gt; &gt; going to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obliterate the planet and everything else in the Universe.  That\n&gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worth being happy about, though it was stupid to say it was the \nend\n&gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Third Cybertronian War, I&#39;ll give ya that.  But they&#39;re \nAutobots,\n&gt; &gt; whaddaya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expect?  And in G1 the Matrix wasn&#39;t a gay Heaven like in BM, it\n&gt; &gt; was just a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; device that held the essences of all the past Autobot leaders,\n&gt; &gt; although the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Matrix of Leadership itself was stupid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would you want Spike?  That&#39;s almost as bad as wanting that\n&gt; &gt; fairy Daniel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or the iinfamous Wheelie?   See people, Dewboy is a PRIME \nexample\n&gt; &gt; of what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens when people polluted with Bob Skir&#39;s sheisse watch G1.\n&gt; &gt; They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amazingly forget that G1 came out about 20 years before BW and \nBM.\n&gt; &gt; Idiocy.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -L.
