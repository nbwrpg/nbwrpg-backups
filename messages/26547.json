I had an interesting idea yesterday and I&#39;m gonna share \nit \n&gt; with you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most new members, when they join, have no idea what factions like \nthe \n&gt; Alliance, the Chosen Ones, the Destrons (although more people know \n&gt; about the Destrons than the made up factions) are, so they end up \n&gt; joining either the Maximals or the Preds. My idea is to make an \n&gt; advertising system, to display ads on the bottom of the character, \n&gt; member, join, main, and other pages. These ads would be advertising \n&gt; the various factions and will be designed by the faction commander. \n&gt; The ads would link to a page describing the faction, which would \nalso \n&gt; be designed by the faction commander. Then new people can get \nvarious \n&gt; faction propoganda to persuade them to join factions other than the \n&gt; familiar ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll add a poll to the poll section, so vote on that. If enough \npeople \n&gt; want it, I&#39;ll pro\n\n\n"}}
