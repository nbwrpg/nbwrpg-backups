I was simply offering you\na chance to be repaired. If you keep flying the wing may be more damaged and\nyou may never fly again. I simply wish to help.&quot; CyberShark said as he was\nsettling to the tree tops. The bat had disappeared from his view, she was\nrunning from something but he didn&#39;t know what.\n    &quot;My name is CyberShark. What is yours?&quot;\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
