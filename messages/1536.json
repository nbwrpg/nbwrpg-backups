I have a plan.  Set, let Hell Beast and his minions \nenter.  I have a plan.  Then activate the outer intercom, deactivate all \nweapons, and ask the Maximals to hold their fire.  Open the hatch of the \nship, and invite them in, telling them over the intercom that we are from the \nTripredacus Council, here to arrest Hell Beast and bring the Maximals back, \nthat we are in a joint mission with the Maximal Elders, but only we possessed \nthe transwarp technology.  If they ask for an explanation, tell them we were \na little jumpy after the crash, and our sensors were malfuctioning, and gave \nus wrong data, and we didn&#39;t realize the folly until we sent men out to \ncounter attack.  Then quickly tell Hell Beast of our plot, and when the \nMaximals are dead, activate our defense systems and rush the Predacons!&quot;\n\n::Unitron walked up onto the bridge::\n&quot;Your orders, Shuko?&quot; Unitron asked, looking almost like a complete duplicate \nof Unicron, standing at 10 ft high, his body orange, white, silver, black, \nand red, two wings (skeleton like) resembling a bats extending from his back.\n\n&quot;Prepare our gestalt team.
