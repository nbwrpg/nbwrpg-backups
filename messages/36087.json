I forgot \nabout the extra weapon fire, how big is Arty? because Pacifix is \nstanding in the entrance to the hideout, if Arty is bigger than 14 \nfeet, Pacifix isn&#39;t in too much danger of being hit by friendly fire, or \nflame. What I&#39;m trying to get at is Arty is acting as a shield for \nPacifix.  =0\n\n\nOn 31 May 2001, at 15:07, CYBERWOLF4 wrote:\n\n&gt; As for unrealistic, during the gulf war how did american and Saudi\n&gt; missles destroy Iraqui Scud missles? as soon as a hissle was fired\n&gt; it&#39;s warhead would be active, virtually any impact would destroy it.\n&gt; (Optimal Optimus would have NEVER been able to deflect Rampages missle\n&gt; simply by useing his arm.) But the writers allowed it because it\n&gt; allowed them to destroy the Maximal ship so the Maximals wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; to defend it and the Ark at the same time, a war on two fronts\n&gt; would&#39;ve weakened the Maximals and since they didn&#39;t really have a\n&gt; qualified leader for the second front they would&#39;ve lost the Beast\n&gt; Wars.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone feels I abuse the rules then say so but since it&#39;s usually\n&gt; my characters that end up looking like the wrong end of a collision\n&gt; with a mack truck I personally don&#39;t feel I do. Blocking an attack\n&gt; should be legal as long as it doesn&#39;t end up being EVERY attack. She\n&gt; shot down two missles and an attack failed, logical solution- ATTACK\n&gt; AGAIN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve already posted that Brandeds flamethrower can heat up like a\n&gt; blast furnace, for those of you who haven&#39;t worked industry that would\n&gt; be anywhere from 2000 to 5000 degrees  (Nothing compared to &quot;Advanced&quot;\n&gt; Transformer technology.)  depending on whats being melted (Science\n&gt; note for those interested) Brass has a melting point of 1800 degrees,\n&gt; copper slightly lower.(Softer metal requires lower temperature.)\n&gt; \n&gt; One last question- How is it that Arty and Pacifix are engaged in hand\n&gt; to hand combat but Pacifix isn&#39;t being hit by any of the weapons fire\n&gt; being used against Arty? We&#39;ve got Slags flames, Artemiss&#39; automatic\n&gt; weapons fire, and whatever other attacks come his way. It&#39;s three on\n&gt; one people, IM each other and get your attacks organized. By all\n&gt; rights Arty Should be toast.

IMH it is\n&gt; &gt; much more interesting sometimes to intercept than to just dodge when\n&gt; &gt; you think you dont want to accept dammage. And Jeff, in the show\n&gt; &gt; they did intercept, ussually missiles with gun fire, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; more powerful rays against each other. Megatron and Dinobots laser\n&gt; &gt; war from Double Dinobot comes to mind. In the original series, Slag\n&gt; &gt; even ignited a missile with his flame breath before it reached him,\n&gt; &gt; and I&#39;m not sure, but I think Inferno did it too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
