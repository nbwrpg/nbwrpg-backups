That was good, but it also meant that she might attack.\nHe stayed right where he was but kept his claws ready just in case she decided that he was an easy match, not quite sure of how much power she would have behind her strikes if she chose to attack.\nIt was then that he noticed her muscles bunch and the next thing he knew her claws had racked across his chest in a shower of sparks, a slight pinching pain where the claws struck but nothing more.\nHe snapped around and just managed to see her land close to the door and near to Tavatron, a loud roar just dying away in his throat as hr then stormed towards her position with his teeth bared and claws ready. His tail slammed against the floor with such force that, where smooth flooring once had been, there was not a bent, then stopping beside Tavatron but then walking beyond her and towards the stranger.\nShe would escape without further comment if it was up to her but he wasn&#39;t about to let her do that, there was still a matter to settle.*\n\n&quot; Computer, magnetically seal door.&quot;\n\n* With a loud clang the door slid shut and the magnetic seal locked into place, thus locking the stranger and all of the other bot&#39;s inside.\nDinobot then approached the bot with a loud snarl but before it could react to his presence he then slashed towards it&#39;s back with his claws drawn, if he couldn&#39;t get to the throat the he would get to the spine!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
