He \n&gt; prefered to be fighting, hunting, pushing himself, and his opponent \n&gt; to thier fullest like he did with Shadow Wing. He also knew that he \n&gt; had a problem submitting to rage. It nearly cost him a friend, and \n&gt; later on his eyesight. His anger nealy got him into a fight with \n&gt; Ripper back at the Ark. It fealt like a battle was taking place \n&gt; inside of him between the wolf and the bot, he didn&#39;t know which \nwas \n&gt; winning, but he knew it had to stop. There were two possible \nendings, \n&gt; confront it or be deleated by it.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She transformed into bot mode and wrapped her arms around \n&gt; Lunarpine&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; neck.

I should be more \n&gt; careful \n&gt; &gt; in battle and not try to kill an entire army by myself. Besides, \nI \n&gt; &gt; got most of the moves from you anyway. Your a good teacher you \n&gt; know. \n&gt; &gt; Despite what you think, you&#39;ve taught me a lot.  About myself and \n&gt; &gt; about you.
