DeathStorm was very stupid to think he could possibly win this.\n\nZardus sets off toward the engine room, taking a different route from the one \nDeathStorm was using. While walking, he activates his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Nemesis,&quot; he says into it, &quot;Please meet me at the engine room imediately. \nArm yourself.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm walks through the corridors on his way to the engine room, \ngrinning to himself about his upcoming victory.\n\nAfter some thought, he had decided simply to destroy the Alliance instead of \ntaking over. The others would not accept him as a leader, and he couldn&#39;t \nhope to match Zardus&#39; leadership. He takes out a brown box from his storage \ncompartment, grinning to himself. An explosing in the engine room should take \nout the ship and give him time to escape.\n\nDeathStorm keeps walking toward the engine room.\n\n"}}
