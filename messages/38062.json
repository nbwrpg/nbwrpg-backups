The bot was crazy! He had just given Slayer away to the Predacons.\nIf they realized what was so plainly obvious, the Trainers had no hope.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Fool!

The Predacon attackers had him outnumbered, outgunned, and outout\nof luck. various shots struck the Eagle in flight sending him into a\ntailspin. He transformed to bot mode turning, ready to fire at the pursuing\nbots. In the distance he saw the smoke as the Trainers base burned to the\nground. He saw Slayer, even through the disguise he remembered him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You called me a traitor then bring this upon our unit?&quot; The bot was\nalone, afraid, looking for someone to blame for the damage. &quot;You brought\nthem here, you dropped the defences, you destroyed everything we had hoped\nto learn. He leapt in the air flapping his wings to push himself higher. The\nshots were hitting him hard but in his state of mind he could&#39;t have cared.\nHe lifted his talons fireing 25  shots from his talons, and two missles from\nhis left arm at the Trainer in disguise.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
