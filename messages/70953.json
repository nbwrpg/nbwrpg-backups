But before we go any further, ya better duck.  That light&#39;s at=\r\ntatched to an active camera, I&#39;ve seen that before.  Hmmm, which kinda give=\r\ns me an idea... Risky but it&#39;s an idea.. Where there&#39;s camreas, there&#39;s got=\r\nta be wires and without wires, no power, no cameras.   But if I just nibble=\r\n at one that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not a whole bunch of these around the com=\r\nplex..  We gotta follow these camera wires&#39;n see where they lead exactly.  =\r\nThere&#39;s sure ta be a control box that delivers power ta all the cameras on =\r\nsight...  Hmm, okay, crawl space is a little small but I know that&#39;s not go=\r\nnna be a problem for us.  Ready?  I dunno if I am but I&#39;m gonna go in anywa=\r\ny.&quot;\n\nOutside the fortress, Tucson continues to stand vigil, but fails to re=\r\nalize that when he had gone into battle, he had not quite allowed himself t=\r\nime to fully recharge.  It was taking a toll on him, as he listens to an au=\r\ndible power indicator  which indicates sixty percent power available.\n\n&quot; Do=\r\nwn to sixty percent in my power gauges.  I must have used more than I thoug=\r\nht. &quot;\n\nStraight Shot knew what she had to do.  She had always carried an au=\r\nxillary power source in her body.  She takes a power cable from herself, an=\r\nd connects it to an arm port on Tucson.  He raises an optic.\n\n&quot; Straight Sh=\r\not, no!  You&#39;ll go off line!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot continues to connect herself t=\r\no him.\n\n&quot; You need it more than I do, and besides, you still have my rechar=\r\nging dock on your back.  I&#39;ll be fine!&quot;\n\nShe gives him the power, to get hi=\r\nm to eighty percent. She quickly goes off line, as he&#39;s forced to send her =\r\nback to her recharging dock.  The dock covers itself with a metal box like =\r\ncover behind his back.\n\nHe shows no sign of retreat, as he now draws his bl=\r\nade instead of the cross bow.  He nodds to Talon and to Kup.\n\n&quot;Kup, remembe=\r\nr when you first trained me and you forced me to spar with my optics turned=\r\n off?   Well, I certainly learned a lot from that training.  It&#39;s time to p=\r\nut it to good use.  I assure you I haven&#39;t forgotten anything you taught me=\r\n.&quot;\n\nHe then smiles to Talon.\n\nWhen in doubt, resort to using what&#39;s around =\r\nyou to get the job done.  I learned that even without conventional weaponry=\r\n, a battle can still be fought well with good results.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s at this time =\r\nwhen one of the enemy&#39;s shots, strikes him on the shoulder.\n\n&quot; TAKE COVER!&quot;=\r\n\n\nNight Shift is quick to take cover, and reloads his plasma riffle.\n\n&quot;Son =\r\nof a slag ball scrap heap!  Where the pit did that come from?!&quot;\n\nHe spots t=\r\nhe wound on Tucson&#39;s shoulder, which now oozes lubricant.\n\n&quot; Woah, boss, yo=\r\nu&#39;re hit!&quot;\n\nTucson turns his head.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s nothing, I&#39;ve been through worse.=\r\n&quot;\n\nNight Shift feverishly scans the skies and tries hard to figure out how =\r\nto combat everyone without getting trapped by them.  \n\n&quot; That&#39;s it, these s=\r\nlag balls wanna play dirty, then so am I!  I got a few emp grennades in my =\r\nmanifold and I&#39;m not afraid ta deploy &#39;em!&quot;\n\nTucson narrows his optics.\n\n&quot; =\r\nHmmm...  If we disperse those accordingly, it may buy us some time.. All ri=\r\nght, I suggest you use one at a time, and space out the amount of ammo that=\r\n you use, don&#39;t use them all at once.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Right, Kup, Ta=\r\nlon, we can all do this.  Here, each of ya take one.  If we spread out we c=\r\nan cover more ground.&quot;\n\nHe gives them both a grennade, and shows them how t=\r\no deploy them.\n\n&quot;Like Tucson said, we use these one at a time at separate i=\r\nntervals.&quot;  Okay, let&#39;s do this.&quot;\n\nAt the Ark, Quickstride keeps his vigil =\r\ncontinuously.  He flicks his tail at near by insects, and then has an idea.=\r\n  Perhaps one that could &quot;Stink&quot; out the enemy.\n\n&quot;Wait a sec, that&#39;s it.. W=\r\nhen in doubt, stink&#39;em out.  What better way to expose the enemy than to cr=\r\neate an incredibly stinky environment...  Lord Elder, I suggest you get ins=\r\nide...  Things might get a little bit noxious out here.&quot;\n\nHe quickly scoops=\r\n up a mouth full of bean pods, and devours a large amount of them.  He rais=\r\nes his tail and releases a large amount of gas.\n\n&quot; Any time nowwww...&quot;\n\n---=\r\n In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWinlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quick Ratrap be ready for anything...
