RAT TRAP could make out the\nsound of laser fire coming from that hole, someone was in the middle\nof battle!\n\nDimly he could the voice of RODIMUS could be heard giving orders, but\nit was difficult to make out what. However he could definitely see the\nflashes coming from it! It looked like RODIMUS and probably PERCEPTOR\nwere under attack.\n\nThe hole was easily twice as big as RAT TRAP should he choose to go\nthrough the hole. He is Alomst small enough to slide through the bars\nof the cage, but it would hurt a little and he might loose a bit of\nfur.\n\nOOC: Keep in mind there were two tunnels dug by Perceptor. One was to\nget into the outer cave that held the mine shaft. Once you entered the\nmine shaft itself there was a tunnel. In the middle of that a cage had\nopened up to catch Nighshift a while back. Perceptor also dug a second\ntunnel around that one as well.\n\nRat Trap is at the opening of that second tunnel at the cage. On the\nother side of the cage and around the corner he can see the lights and\nsounds of some sort of firefight.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a hiss from DINOBOT, &quot;Acknowledged.  Predacons, mobilize.&quot;  He\n&gt; went to fly through the air, probably flanked by the rest of the TERRORCONS\n&gt; as they went to secure a perimeter!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT hissed, &quot;REmain quiet for now.  There is no sense in drawing out\n&gt; half the Maximal army to swarm over us.  Remain in Beast Mode.  If the\n&gt; Maximals assault, then deal wtih them.  Separate them into groups and\n&gt; isolate them.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nMeanwhile outside the cave opening DINOBOT and the TERRORCONS were\narriving, their IFF signatures cut down to nearly nothing. They were\nstalking forward and hiding.\n\nThen the sound of TUCSON&#39;s roar echoed over the landscape!\n\nHUN-GRR looked around as they other TERRORCONS were obviously startled\nbut kept it together.\n\n&quot;That was Tucson.&quot; CUTTHROAT said almost eagerly. &quot;Is he nearby?&quot; he\nsaid in gravely tones.\n\nRIPPERSNAPPER sniffed the air, &quot;No, but I would imagine he is at the\nArk from the sound of it.&quot;\n\nHUN-GRR nodded, &quot;You just don&#39;t go out there running half cocked\nunless I give the order, clear?&quot;\n\nCUTTHROAT grumbled something.\n\n&quot;I said clear!?!&quot; HUN-GRR said more forcefully.\n\n&quot;Clear.&quot; CUTTHROAT said reluctantly.\n\n SINNERTWIST was standing next to DINOBOT, his attention on some\nmovement, &quot;There are Maimals about.&#39; he said pointing at UPROAR moving\noff int he direction of the ARK.\n\nBLOT nodded, &quot;He came from there.&quot; He pointed with his clawed hand at\na tunnel opening. It loooked to have been recently excavated. He\nturned to scratch his ear sending noxious smelling oils falling from\nbeneath where is armpits would be.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
