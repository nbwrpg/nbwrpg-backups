Then I will rule supreme over two galaxies.&quot;\n     The comm to Zardus completed right after the word &quot;galaxies&quot; \nMagmatron spoke to Zardus. &quot;Alliance Commander Zardus, I think it is \nabout time you and I had a meeting, face to face. For me to see what \nhas become of my project, and how it has helped you. Magmatron out.&quot;\n     Because of time dilations, Magmatron and crew would have been \ngone much longer than it seemed. In that time Magmatron and an army \nor Xenomorphic Transformers had conquired the main planets of another \ngalaxy, breeding new types of Transformers. Magmatron knew that \nDachande and Cerberus had slipped through his fingers, but not for \nlong, at least with Cerberus. Dachande was of no use to Magmatron \nanymore, the prototype was outdated, and he was expendable. Shredder \non the other hand, well, Magmatron liked him. This would be a very \ninteresting war.\n\n\n"}}
