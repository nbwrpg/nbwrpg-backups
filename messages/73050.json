Who you working for this\n&gt; time?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dropping her cloak, and moving to whip out her pioson crossbow, going to try\n&gt; and fire a disabling array of stingers over at the trio to paralyze them. &quot;\n&gt; not htat I can&#39;t dig it out of all you myself, but that just takes less\n&gt; time.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a slight pause from the trio at BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s question . .\n. and that very pause from them allowed the ebony spider to get her\nweapons out and fire before the three, who already had their weapons .\n. . or at least attention, trained in her general direction, could\nfire back.\n\nBAZOOKA caught a blast in the side and stumbled towards the cover of a\nstout tree, trying to hold himself up.\n\nHowever KILLPUNCH and GUILDART were able to take cover behind other\ntrees and brush and returned fire, GUILEDART&#39;s Thunder Horn blaster\nripping into the air, its sonic concussive blast truly massive!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
