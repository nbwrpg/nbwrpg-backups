Slag.  Anyway I got a question for ya.\n&gt; I&#39;ve been think&#39;n about this alliance with the Preds.  Why are they\n&gt; cooperating so well?  It&#39;s like someone promised them the world if they\n&gt; played nice with us.  Something isn&#39;t right sir, something isn&#39;t right. &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLORD ELDER was watching the screen as NIGHTSHIFT worked.&quot;I have no\nidea why the Predacons do what they do.&quot; He said. &quot;Plus we don&#39;t know\nif they are still cooperating or not.&quot;\n\nELDER grunted, &quot;They could be peacemakers or they could have turned on\nLeo Prime. We won&#39;t know until we can restore communications, and I\nthink that the satellite might have enough power to punch through the\ninterference, or at least analyze it.&quot;\n\nThen ELDER saw the numbers for CHEETOR appear on NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s screen.\nHe glanced at LEGACY, PERCEPTOR and WINDLORD hoping one of themn had\nan answer for why a missing MAXIMAL&#39;s clearance code would be part of\na sabotage attempt against CRYONOSIS.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
