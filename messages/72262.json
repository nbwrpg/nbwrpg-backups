Tucson did as\n&gt; instructed but there was no way in the name of Primus that he was going to\n&gt; bow to Magmatron.  He snaps his tail and gives a thunderous roar, that\n&gt; sounds very much like the thunder of the heavens.  He swings his draconic\n&gt; head up while staring firmly at Magmatron.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I will not kneel to Evil!  And nothing you do to me will make me change my\n&gt; mind!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He slams his right front foot down hard as clawed talons scrape at the\n&gt; floor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Torture me all you want, I will NEVER SURRENDER TO THE LIKES OF YOU!&quot;\n\n &lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;I said kneel!&quot; Came a voice from behind TUSCON, it was HARDHEAD as he\nkicked TUSCON in the back of the knee forcing him into a kneeling\nposition while HYDRA still had his weapon trained on him.\n\nThere was a chuckle from MAGMATRON, &quot;You are a strong one, defiant\ntoo, I think you will do well.&quot; He turned his head slightly as one of\nthe doors had opened, depositing a familiar black and grey form into\nthe chamber. &quot;What do you think Dark Rodimus?&quot;\n\n&quot;Him?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he hooked a thumb at TUSCON, &quot;He may have\na new form, but he is the same old Tuscon, too busy blowing smoke to\nsee what&#39;s right in front of him.&quot;\n\nEvery move that DARK RODIMUS made, his intonations, his walk were all\njust like the RODIMUS of old, even the glint of humor he had when he\nturned to look at TUSCON more fully. What was different was the lack\nof remorse, the cold and heartless way he watched. He was the dark\nflame that once may have been RODIMUS.\n\nThere was a nod from SABERBACK, &quot;That may be what we need.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
