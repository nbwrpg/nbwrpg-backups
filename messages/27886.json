Raising his right arm, the sword it held shot out three bolts of \nlaser energy at Hot Rod.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher felt Dinobot&#39;s blast, which didn&#39;t do anything because of heavy \narmor.  Some shots from another robot dug into his armored form, but didn&#39;t \ndamage anything vital.  The large cannon of the turret turned to focus on \nDinobot, launching a single missile at the Maximal.\n\nThe small cannon on the turret focused in on the Cybertronian Fire, letting \nloose a large arc of sonic energy in the ship&#39;s general direction.\n\n---\n\nReflector fell to a knee from blasts, and looked over to the disguised \nUnicron, smiling.  He leapt into the air, a rifle forming in his left hand \nfrom subspace.  Raising the rifle, he fired a single long spurt of green acid \nat Firearm.  Raising his right arm, he aimed his rapid-firing missile \nlauncher, firing off two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nThe disguised Unicron charged up his optic sensors, firing off three rapid \nblasts at Prowl.\n\n---\n\nShockwave arrived on scene, sending an inner monologue transmission to \nUnitron and getting a response.  Receiving a target lock, the Decepticon \nwarrior let loose two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\nSending an inner monologue transmission to Hell Beast, his sing-song voice \nunforgettable.  &quot;Hell Beast, if we must retreat, head for the Brotherhood \nbase.&quot;\n\n---\n\nStreetwise transformed to his police car mode, Groove inside of him, and \ndrove out of the Cybertronian Fire, scanning for a target to bash.\n\n"}}
