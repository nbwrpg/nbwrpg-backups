We \nsteal the energon shelding device they&#39;ll inevitably have to use and \nforce them to stay in Beast Mode constantly.  Then while they sleep \nthe Beast Modes will take over leaving them helpless and at our \nmercy.  We can then use parts from there ship to repair our own and \nget the Pit out of here.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;black_ben14&quot; &lt;black_ben14@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Siref arrived in the CR room and took his BIG elephant form and \n&gt; switched for robot mode &quot;Yeah I like that.&quot; he said joyfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; ooc:about this rifle thing can I have two gun one with the trump \nand \n&gt; the rifle?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He sees the the external sensore were brough back.

The ship looks like \n&gt; &gt; slag. But could have been worse, we could have crashed on \n&gt; Quintessa, \n&gt; &gt; or into Unicron.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He laughed at the joke only he, and maybe history buffs, would \n&gt; get.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deck 2, CR Chamber room\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talos had moved through the damaged ship and ascended the \nstairs \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; deck two where the main generators and CR chambers were located. \n&gt; &gt; After recieving Sunhawks and Hot Rod&#39;s reports he nodded before \n&gt; &gt; moving to a communications hub that wasn&#39;t sparking and turned on \n&gt; &gt; ship wide broadcasting, &quot;Sensors have detected massive energon \n&gt; &gt; readings outside the ship, all personnel should report to the CR \n&gt; &gt; Chamber bay for alterate form protection, do not stray far from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; ship before you have done this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Closing the channel he moved to a console and began typing, on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; top of the ship a hatch slid open freeing an extending pole that \n&gt; &gt; began scanning the surrounding area for compatible forms.
