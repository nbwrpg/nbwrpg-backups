She was surprised to see Rizopas step in front of her\nand take the fireball. He goes down to both knees.\n\n&quot;Just go get your stuff, if we lost the base we need your talent of\nhealing.&quot; Rizopas says. Dooom Ice runs into the base, avoiding Minion&#39;s\nshots, to get her inventions and gadgets, which would prove helpful is they\nlost the base, particularly, her healing units. (Ever heard of CR Packs?)\n\n&gt; Flesh Ripper let the missile knock him to his skid plate.  He merely let\nout\n&gt; a hoarse laugh, firing off five rapid optic blasts off at Gigas&#39; chest.\n\nGigas didn&#39;t make a sound as the optic blasts cut into him. He merely\nwatched, even as his onboard computer was telling him to go into stasis\nlock.\n\n&quot;Shut up.&quot; He told the computer. He fired a single missile at Flesh Ripper,\nlocking onto his target.\n\n&gt; Sixshot in the air saw Serge open fire and take out Ares.  Activating his\n&gt; targeting computer, he fired down two missiles at Serge.  Ares wasn&#39;t as\n&gt; strong as Sixshot, but if things got bad in the Alliance, the STAG would\nneed\n&gt; all the help he could get.\n\nSerge laughed at the destruction he had caused. The Missiles hit him in the\nback. He stumbles forward and looks up. Without a word, he aims into the air\nand fires a single missile at SixShot.\n\n&gt; Unitron turned the cannon to target Rizopas, firing off a single energy\nblast\n&gt; in his tank mode at Rizopas.\n\nRizopas, kncoked down from earlier, was hit clear on and sparks start firing\nfrom his neck.\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t you go home and celebrate your victory, scumbags?&quot; Rizopas says.\nHe fires his blaster, just one shot at Unitron.\n\n&gt; Serpentor arrived on scene, seeing a few autoguns fire on him.  Ignoring\nthe\n&gt; shells that were almost piercing his armor, he raised his plasma launcher,\n&gt; firing off a blast at Doom Ice.  (NOTE: Plasma launcher is same as\nbazooka,\n&gt; only plasma energy instead of large explosive shell)\n\nDoom Ice ran into the base just as soon as the blast hit. Rizopas was\nblasted to the ground. He screams as he feels the pain of internal injuries.\nSerge didn&#39;t feel much of the effect, just being burned by the nearby blast.\nStronghold and Blender came from the base, targeting Serpentor, each of them\nfired 2 missiles.\n\n&gt; Chaos transformed to his missile trailer mode, firing off two missiles at\nthe\n&gt; Mafia base.\n\n(My post for all base damage is above)\n\n\n"}}
