Her instincts told her it was time to \nhunt.  She stretched her wings.  She took off silently through the base and \nout into the night.  She flew through the night air. It was cool and \nrefreshing.  She saw a mouse running in the tall grass.  She flew dowm and \ncaught it.  She took her time devouring the small rodent.  She took off \nagain looking for another meal.  She stopped at a tree and perched just \noutside the base.  &quot;Goodbye. I&#39;m sorry I failed you.&quot; she whipsered. She \nturned and flew northward. By morning, she would be far away from the \nmaximal base.  She had survived in the cold and almost barren terrain \nbefore.  Only this time, she didn&#39;t care if she made it or not. Her emotions \nwere her weakness.  But her weakness and her&#39;s alone.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
