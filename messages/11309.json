Im going to pick it up from the point to where they found the \nRadio and listened to it...........\n\n    Aerostreak, in his black and brown beast mode where his large wings were \ntucked behinde him making it look like a backpack, held the radio and \nexamined it in the sunlight. His red eyes looked over it, scrutinizeing it, \nobsorbing every detail. He looked to see that the symbol on the radio was the \nsame on his left breast. That was an important find, very important.\n    In his won hut, his own private place, he tucked it away under his \nmattress of palmleaves. His bed was more like a nest because all the natives \nslept in beast mode. When it was hidden from view he made his way out of the \nhut into the center of camp where a fire pit was, along with logs to sit \naround it. He came to find Nighteyes and Guanatix there. They were talking \nabout the weather while Grappler and Paddletail were finishing the final \nphase of Great Hall.\n    He continued past his to talkitive sisters, and two working brothers to \nfind Aquarious, the Dolphin, heading for the beach. Without water he would \ndie, hence that was why he didnt have a hut. Instead he slept in an \nunderwater cave beneath the island.\n    Aquarious locked his baby blue eyes on Aerostreak. &quot;Hello! Where are you \nheaded to this morning?&quot; The dolphin said egarly.\n    Aerostreak gave a sort of sneer. He saw that Aquarious&#39; symbol was \ndifferent than his. The dolphins was red, while Aerostreaks was purple with \nan insect like head.\n    &quot;Im investigating something. You wouldnt understand, go to the beach.&quot; He \ncommanded his brother. Aquarious wasnt bright, and often listened to \nAerostreak who was quite smart and very dominating.\n    Aquarious looked a little sadened by that command. &quot;Alright, but I sure \nwould like to help.&quot;\n    &quot;No. Now go! I have no time for this useless conversation.&quot; Aerostreak \nsaid and left. He made his way into the jungle, on the path, and went deeper. \nHe went so far to where the light no longer showed. He came to rest on a \nfallen tree, and waited.\n\n    Grappler, in his red Tarantula beast mode scurried into the jungle, on \nthe trail of Aerostreak. The spider smelt him and was following him. If \nanything he could get a meal out of this excurtion.\n    Now he watched as the bird to a seat on a fallen tree. Through the cover \nof sone ferns he watched Aerostreak. Soon, it became boreing to watch him \nthere so he emerged.\n    &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Aerostreak demanded.\n    The spider hissed back, &quot;Following you. Why did you come all the way out \nhere?&quot;\n    Aerostreak looked and saw he had the same symbol has him on his chest, \nand that sparked a revelation within his hidden, long lost Predacon soul.\n\n"}}
