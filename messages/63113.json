He compulsively emptied all the\ncartridges and removed the gunpowder which he then quickly poured into\nsome jar-like containers.  He used some spare parts to create a\ndetonator, then some scrap metal to provide some shrapnel, finally\ntightly wrapping the makeshift devices in tape.  He now had six\nfunctional grenades that would prove very useful.  He found a little\nhiding space by the main hatch where he sat and waited with his\ngrenades and riffle that was in less than perfect condition.  If all\nelse failed he would resort to using his arm cannons.\n\n&quot;Ready!&quot; he said, doubting she could hear him.\n\n\nOn Tue, 25 Jan 2005 21:17:49 -0800 (PST), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague was busy getting the ship&#39;s structural field tensor fields up and\n&gt; running, and projecting a partial shield over the hole in the wall of her\n&gt; room.

He goes to an old weapon&#39;s crate in the back and hoping\n&gt; to find weapons.  All he finds is an old rifle and a lot of weapons\n&gt; parts.  He takes the riffle, checks it to make sure it is still\n&gt; funtioning, then fishes around in the crate for some more parts.  He\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure if he had time to put together anything else, but he had\n&gt; to try.  He hoped that Hellplague was ok, as she haddn&#39;t responded to\n&gt; his earlier inquiry as he left the cockpit for safety.  He figured she\n&gt; had more important things on her mind right now, like avoiding getting\n&gt; shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?
