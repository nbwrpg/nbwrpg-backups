He couldn&#39;t wait long. The \nposion was gone, but his foreclaw was still badly damaged. It wouldn&#39;t serve \nhim any good. It worked as a leg, which he needed, and it was his second \ndefense. Only one worked. One was okay, but he still needed two.\n\nHe needed to get back to base, but he wasn&#39;t sure if it was safe. Maybe he \ncould talk to the computer in some way.\n\n--That wouldn&#39;t work. He couldn&#39;t communicate to the computer unless he was \ninside the ship. The only way was to travel back to base, and command it \nfrom there.\n\nIt was a plan, but alone wasn&#39;t a good idea. He was just one, damaged, and \nno one was there to back him up. He thought of it...again.\n\nHe opened contact through Megatron&#39;s troops, &quot;Can anyone here me? This is \nQuickstrike, ah need some back-up down here.&quot; Telling them his cooridination \nmight just cause trouble for him. Hell Beast&#39;s troops might come running.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
