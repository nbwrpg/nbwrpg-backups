She moved and twisted her arm a little, but \nnot enough to really free herself from him.  She screamed \nout, &quot;PLEASE NO! DON&quot;T KILL ME! NO! DON&#39;T SHOOT!&quot;  She added a slight \ntremble to her voice as she yelled. Tears started to roll down her \ncheeks. &quot;NOO!

She had to tell herself that she couldn&#39;t pounce \nnow without exposing herself to danger or getting Spears shot.  She \ndidn&#39;t make a sound, she just watched and waited to see what Ramulus \nwould do. But she trembled slightly at not being able to do anything \nabout the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
