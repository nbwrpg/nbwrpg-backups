Perhaps I have missed a\n&gt; post or two, but I thought Remus was still =\r\nback at Maximal HQ? I am not\n&gt; saying he cannot be here, but I just want to=\r\n be sure I know what\n&gt; happened so I can post the proper responses for the =\r\nsweeps and such he\n&gt; flew through, from the looks of it without stopping. I=\r\n would think he\n&gt; would have to be moving quite fast to know what Rodimus a=\r\nnd Cyclonus\n&gt; where up to and be able to react with the speed that he did. =\r\nRemember\n&gt; Cyclonus has only come to the water front last post - perhaps in=\r\n the\n&gt; last minute or so. Before that Cyclonus was in combat with Ravenchie=\r\nf,\n&gt; moving swiftly across the city. Again I am just trying to be sure of\n&gt;=\r\n the details before I post a response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minio=\r\nn)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; After Rodimus had spoken, =\r\na rain of laserfire swept at Cyclonus. A\n&gt; &gt; moment later, Remus calmly arr=\r\nived at the scene and interposed\n&gt; &gt; himself\n&gt; &gt; between the leader and the=\r\n hunter. He said nothing, but his eyes\n&gt; &gt; shone\n&gt; &gt; an unearthly yellow-go=\r\nld color.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do Y=\r\nou Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
