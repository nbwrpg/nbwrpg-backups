He pulled against it, \ntrying to swim for the surface. He couldn&#39;t see what had his leg, but he \ntried to slash at it with the fangs at the end of his arm. From the feel of \nit, it was metal, and smooth. He kicked at it. It wasn&#39;t too stable, like it \nwas flexable.\n\nHe didn&#39;t know how, but he mananed to get to the surface again. He coughed \nand screamed. He reached for Stingtra, but she was too far away. Another of \nthe underwater things grabbed him around the shoulder. It looked like a \ngolden segmented arm. The one on his leg and the one wrapped around his \nshoulder shoved him back down into the pitch black water. They pulled him \nfast into the water, barely able to fight against it. He felt another one \nbrush against him. There were more under the water--going for Stingtra. But \nhe couldn&#39;t do anything. After he saw the other arms, the blackness took \nover his vision. He knew they were pulling him to someplace.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Tue, 18 Jul 2000 20:13:34 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;*Stingtra follows Quickstrike and than stares* Stingtra:...slag....\n&gt;*Stingtra is sumerged under water and pops her head up* Stingtra:\n&gt;Quickstrike?

It was \n&gt;nearly\n&gt; &gt; pitch black at the end of it. He activated his infra red vision to make \n&gt;it\n&gt; &gt; easier to see. The farther it walked down, the more confusing it got. It\n&gt; &gt; looked like it went at a dead end.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stopped and tilted his head, musing at what was behind his optics.\n&gt;Below\n&gt; &gt; him, he heard the slight trickle of water. He looked down and saw at \n&gt;least\n&gt; &gt; an inch of water touching his feet, enough to make the ridges on the\n&gt;bottom\n&gt; &gt; of his feet disappear. He thought there must be a water source within \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; cave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just as he was about to step ahead, he went down. It felt like the \n&gt;ground\n&gt; &gt; had collapsed--with the splash. The puddle of water that filled the hold\n&gt; &gt; area turned into a pool. Quickstrike twisted and turned, trying to find\n&gt;what\n&gt; &gt; way was up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He righted himself and tried his luck. His head surfaced, coughing from\n&gt; &gt; surprise. After he got a breath, he felt something pull at him. There \n&gt;was\n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; tug, then a violent yank. He was again pulled underwater. But this time \n&gt;he\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t fight to get back up to the surface. Something had his leg,\n&gt;pulling\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Missing old school friends?
