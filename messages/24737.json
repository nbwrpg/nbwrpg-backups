He had his fix. He saw them come \ninto view. The one he had already taken dna sampale from the other was a new \none. But contained the skill he needed. He knew the dragon bot would regonize \nhim. So it would be easy to lure them away from thier friends.\n Apocalypse glared in disbeilf as the old foe zoomed over his head. He shook \nin fear as he passed. &quot;It cant be....he died.... I killed him.&quot;.......\n   Death looked at the bot fly over head. He looked at apocalypse and was \nsurprised by the fear in his eyes. &quot;Lets get him Death... follow me. Its us \nhe is after anyway. He fortold me this when I killed him the first time. This \ntime he will stay buried.&quot; Apocalypse suddenly took off after it. Death \nimmediatly following him but instructed the rest to remain. Whoever that was \ncouldnt be that tough........\n\n"}}
