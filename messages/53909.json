As she stepped \nforward \n&gt; closer, a wicked smirk upon her feline face. Her optics dancing \nabout, as she \n&gt; studied every square inch of the map & where the bases were. Such \ninvaluable \n&gt; information. Silently, she laughed, commending herself. He said \nthat she was \n&gt; cunning. Indeed.. one living for so long would have to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I thank you for such an insurmountable wealth of information. I&#39;m \nsure... it \n&gt; will come in handy.&quot; & indeed ... it will. Already she started to \nplot, how \n&gt; would she terminate Empath. True, her time was at an end. Not \nabiding by the \n&gt; oath that was taken as a Decepticon. Poor Empath. Had she not \nlearned that \n&gt; lesson when it happened to Octane so many years ago? Obviously \nnot. \n&gt; \n&gt; Silently padding around the table, her optics upon the map as she \nstudied \n&gt; everything. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I assume the map & the computer systems are voice activated?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
