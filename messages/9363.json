She ran after her and leaped in front of her, with her side to her. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Go back scorpion-bot, she said to her. Do you want to die? She imaged weak Quickstrike sitting in the CR chamber with KitKat, Stingtra and herself by him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quickstrike: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quickstrike scooted to the side of his sleeping area to a spot that was in the corner. His head hurt and he was still dizzy. He wished something could do something for his head. He covered his head and laid down. He cocked his leg out and slammed his heel against the wall of the cave. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
