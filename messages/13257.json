But \n&gt; when he prepared himself to fire. He saw Rowdy Wolf below.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh slag!&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s still around!&quot; He backed off, fast. He flew \n&gt; towards the cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf leaped away from Dinotron&#39;s optic lazers. He turned his \n&gt; body to the Dinobot. &quot;It&#39;s a waste.
