Shall we say so high up the command hierarchy, TARANTALUS.\n&gt; Have things been reordered over in my abscence, or is this somewhat of an\n&gt; impromptu self-promotion?&quot;  Then again, he and VICE GRIP were both total\n&gt; neophytes to the new PREDACON unit, CRYOTEK, HYDRAS, CYCLONUS, and SCOURGE\n&gt; were all missing, along with SKORPONOK...\n&gt;\n&gt; But, as summoned, DINOBOT went up and over towards the bridge as he was\n&gt; commanded.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nYes, there were many missing - JHIAXUS and SCORPONOK were both missing\nand have been for some time, but HYDRAS, CYCLONUS and SCOURGE were\nalso missing more recently and even CRYOTEK!\n\nIt was as if the PREDACONS couldn&#39;t keep a leader a round without it\nbeing lost or stolen!\n\nSKYSHADOW gave DINOBOT a &#39;look&#39; as he was just in the dark about\nTARANTULUS&#39; sudden self promotion.\n\nAs they came to the command center the large form of BRUTICUS-X was\nstanding at the door way in his dreaded CERBERUS beast mode, his three\nheads each looking around than at the group. He quietly stood as the\ndoor opened and allowed entrance to the bridge.\n\nhttp://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/3/39/RID_Bruticus_Toy.jpg\n\nThe bridge itself looked well apponted. It had a singular command\nchair with Navigation and Helm control towards the front of the bridge\nand other stations lining it along the walls.\n\n&quot;Greetings.&quot; TARANTULUS said as IGUANUS and SCAREM stepped aside so\nthat SKYSHADOW and DINOBOT could get a clear view of the new PREDACON\n&#39;commander&#39; &quot;I see you have met my staff.&quot; There was a wicked chuckle.\n\n&quot;Since when does the help sit in the command chair?&quot; SKYSHADOW said\nmenacingly as he stepped foward.\n\nThe high pitched sounds of weapons being charged up could suddenly be\nheard as IGUANUS and SCAREM took aim on SKYSHADOW and DINOBOT.\n\n&quot;You will mind your words Skyshadow.&quot; TARANTULUS said as he leaned\nback in the chair, confident and smug. &quot;Or I will show you the error\nof your ways.&quot; He chuckled as he rubbed his hands together\nmischieviously, yes he evidently had plans.\n\n&quot;It was me you came to meet.&quot; said a powerful contralto voice as a\nfemale in dark armor stepped out of a door that had just swished open.\n\nhttp://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/a/a2/BW_Antagony_boxart.jpg\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
