As soon as the engines died away, a rather large \nhatch opened.\n\nRamiel: So this is what Earth used to be...\n\nGogolan: It is beautiful... I just can&#39;t find out why things turned \nout so badly for this world...\n\nRamiel: We shall know soon enough. We need to make a conference table.\n\nHe turned and saw a huge tree, maybe as big as the ship. He smiled and \nstraightened his wings.\n\nRamiel: Power and Transform!\n\nHe transformed to a strange hybrid between an angel and a coyote. As \nsoon as he had done that, he rammed the tree. It fell to the ground.\n\nGogolan: I guess I&#39;m supposed to make the table, right? Aaah... that&#39;s \nnot fair... I always get the dirty work...\n\nAnd transformed too, into some sort of bulky metallic angel. The \npincer on his right arm became a huge claw with which he slashed \nthe tree. They now had a perfect table top.\n\nRamiel: Okay... To forgive myself, I&#39;ll get the anti-g motor...\n\n\n"}}
