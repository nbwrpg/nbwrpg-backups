The \nchances of finding a pod was unlikely.\n\n&quot;Fine, go ahead and try it. Thank you for your help. It seems thought \nthat my spark will have to go out. Let&#39;s just pray to The Matrix that \na pod has crashed unknowingly.&quot;\n\nVulois\n\nVulois sat down in the discussion room along with his friends. He \nbegan to tell them his tale.\n\n&quot;After Terminess and I blew ourselves up, I expected to awaken inside \nThe Matrix, not infront of it. It started speaking to me, saying that \nit wanted me to bring Organic life to Cybertron. It said I would \nreturn to Past Earth and attempt to unify those bots in bringing back \nOrganic life so that all bots could an organic form. With the sharing \nof this, it would bring everyone closer to peace. I was suppost to \nbring three chosen ones to aide me:Cybershark, Soundwave and Battera. \nThe Matrix also explained that it was the reason I came to the Neo \nBeast Wars in the first place, so that I could see how terrible \nPredacon life was. So it returned me to Past Earth, where I have \nspent the last two weeks hiding, building this place. Scraps of pods, \nships and other materials. Since everyone thought I was dead, no one \nbothered to try and notice this area. So, now you know my story, and \nthe mission we are all entrusted with. Now, The Matrix warned that we \nmay not succeed; some might even get mad at our attempts of peace and \nmay try to attack us. It also warned me that you may not want to \njoin, especially you Cybershark, who is such a warrior. So I ask you \nnow before we take the first step. This is your only chance to leave. \nDo you want to join me, or go back on your way?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
