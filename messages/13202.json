Hey Fliq, get up. I need you.&quot;\n\nFliq stirred and opened his eyes. Out of th efront of the shuttle was \nthe moon, looking gigantic. And on the surface could be seen the \nwreck of the Maximal battle cruiser Mosquition.\n\n&quot;I need you to plot the landing course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Huh?Wha?Oh yeah. Okay, I did this already...it&#39;s in here \nsomewhere...Aha! There you go. We land in the remnants of the crushed \ncrator, just to the right of the ship.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright. Ramulus you better hang on, cause if you thought take off \nwas harsh, the landing&#39;s gonna kill you.&quot;\n\nBrix tlted the ship towards the moon. Once he got a bit closer he put \nthe put the bottom of the ship exactly square with the landing site, \nand since it was on the bottom side of the moon, the bots fell like \nthey were upside down! Then Brix just dropped, or went up, depending \non the way you want to look at it.. It felt like they were going to \ncrash. But just before they hit the moon, Brix fired th engine sin \nthe other direction a small bit, and the floated down easily. Gravity \nover took them and the upside down feeling went away. Brix turned to \nlook at Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Now, the main things we need are hull, weapons and and computer \nboards. Which ones do you want to get?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
