Yet the water simp=\r\nly follows the flow of his arms rather than splashing on them.  And with th=\r\ne water came the compulsion to transform into his beast form.   And then as=\r\n warrior once again became the dragon, he embraces the element of water and=\r\n melds with its own natural forces and then, with his powerful tail, he str=\r\nikes the wall, attempting to finally break it to further weaken it.\n\nFire m=\r\nay not have been his theme but he embraces something far more significant t=\r\nhan simple flames.  The element of Thunder, and lightning and the raging to=\r\nrrent of rain water that follows the first clap of thunder.  He gives a dra=\r\nconic roar that sends a thunderous boom toward the Sharkticon guards, and t=\r\nhroughout the cavern.\n\nHe can hear Yoketron&#39;s phrases as he carries forth a=\r\nnd recites them to his enemies.\n\n&quot; Fire may be powerful and capable of mass=\r\nive damage, yet fire is not the most formidable element of nature.  For it =\r\nhas a weakness, water.  And even more powerful than water, is the storm tha=\r\nt spawns it.  Embrace the power of the storm, be at one with the tempest, a=\r\nnd bring forth the light that follows darkness. &quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s armor shimmers =\r\nas the glint on each metallic scale flashes like lightning. He stands his g=\r\nround and begins moving his wings, kicking up a slight breeze in the cave.\n=\r\n\n&quot; I am the storm, and I will not be easily stopped.  Your darkness will se=\r\ne light, like it or not.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;s=\r\nupercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson walks over to the wall =\r\nof debris, and examines it carefully.  By\n&gt; &gt; running a clawed finger over =\r\nit, he could tell how tightly packed it was.\n&gt; &gt; Touch would serve him well=\r\n, as he remembers training with just his hands,\n&gt; &gt; ears and sense of smell=\r\n to guide him.  And so he closes his eyes, going back\n&gt; &gt; to the days of hi=\r\ns training with Master Yoketron.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; The walls may seem an impossible=\r\n barrier, but the eyes can only perceive a\n&gt; &gt; fraction of what is really i=\r\nn front of you.  Embrace your other senses, see\n&gt; &gt; with your hands, ears, =\r\nfeet and nose, rather than with your eyes.  Feel what\n&gt; &gt; must be felt and =\r\nsense what must be sensed.  Yes Master Yoketron, I remember\n&gt; &gt; what you ta=\r\nught me. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He takes a slow step away from the wall of debris.  Take=\r\ns a few deep\n&gt; &gt; breaths. And with eyes completely shut, he puts his hands =\r\ntogether as if\n&gt; &gt; slipping into some form of deep meditation.  Straight Sh=\r\not looks to her\n&gt; &gt; brother and then to Leo and the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Guys,=\r\n step back, I&#39;ve seen this before, it&#39;s a maneuver Master Yoketron\n&gt; &gt; taug=\r\nht him and it&#39;s a doozy.  Gee I sure hope it works.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride an=\r\nd Rattrap move back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay, I definitely sense he&#39;s up ta somethin=\r\ng we haven&#39;t seen him do yet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With serene poise, and peaceful grac=\r\ne, Tucson begins with a form of Tai Chi,\n&gt; &gt; that appears harmless to those=\r\n who know nothing of Ninjabot training.  Yet\n&gt; &gt; if Magmatron knew of it, p=\r\nerhaps he may know what would come next.  Ever so\n&gt; &gt; gradually, Tucson beg=\r\nins to move faster and faster as feet seem to lift off\n&gt; &gt; the ground befor=\r\ne they even touch it, and then it comes.  He lifts his body\n&gt; &gt; off the gro=\r\nund and spin kicks the wall, with great force, attempting to\n&gt; &gt; weaken the=\r\n wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;THOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; TUSCON&#39;s hit was impressive! Great =\r\nfissures and cracks began to appear\n&gt; in the wall as almost immediately wat=\r\ner began to burst out in small\n&gt; sections as actual breaks began to spray f=\r\nrom the wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wall was not broken yet, but it was definitely weake=\r\nning!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time MAGMATRON was distracted with his own project a=\r\nnd\n&gt; apparently had not noticed TUSCON, being that he was at least a mile a=\r\n\n&gt; way or more. However SABERBACK seemed to be aware, his optics\n&gt; narrowin=\r\ng as he focused on them, even as he stood at the base of the\n&gt; flaming pill=\r\nar of energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pointing in TUSCON&#39;s direction SABERBACK was evidently g=\r\niving orders\n&gt; as the SHARKTICON guards turned to look at TUSCON and the ot=\r\nher\n&gt; PREDACONS and MAXIMALS.\n&gt; \n&gt; More SHARKTICONS stepped into view as we=\r\nll. in the end there were\n&gt; twenty one SHARKTICONS, each of them transformi=\r\nng into their shark\n&gt; mode and began to fly in the direction of TUSCON and =\r\nthe others with\n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look!&quot; TORCA said as he pointed back at the en=\r\nergy pillar or fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; From another opening another familiar figure coul=\r\nd be seen exiting,\n&gt; his identity obvious to them all, even if he was a mil=\r\ne away: DARK\n&gt; RODIMUS and he was carrying NIGHTLIGHT in his arms!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Th=\r\nere is more!&quot; BIG CONVOY said as looked as well, his fists tightly\n&gt; clence=\r\nhd in anger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind DARK RODIMUS were other SHARKTICON guards, two of =\r\nthem also\n&gt; carrying what appeared to be two other MAXIMALS: STAMPY and SHA=\r\nRPEDGE,\n&gt; neither of whom were moving.\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON smiled as OPTIMUS PRI=\r\nME began to scream again, the sound of\n&gt; his agony echoing throught the cav=\r\nern. However the cry was\n&gt; signifigantly weaker than before.\n&gt; \n&gt; Weaker an=\r\nd growing weaker with each passing moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
