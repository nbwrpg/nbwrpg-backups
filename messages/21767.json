Never!\n&quot;You are right, the Matrix has made my programing Maximal. The\nreprograming you did is gone. But one thing remained, my love for you!&quot;\nHe put his arm around her, holding her close.\n&quot;Thats why I&#39;m here, and not the Cybertronian Fire. My programing may be\nMaximal, but I&#39;ll do anything to be with you. That includes staying with\nthe Alliance.&quot;\nThat was an exageration. He wasn&#39;t sure if he would really work for the\nAlliance. He was torn between his Maximal/Autobot heritage, and his love\nfor her.\n\nHe looked at her wounds.\n&quot;You need a CR. The question is, the Alliance base, or the CF. If you\nask me you are more like a Maximal. You have a kind good natured spark.\nYou were serving the Alliance cause Zardus reprogramed you.(Thats what\nhappaned right?) That programing is gong now. You arn&#39;t a Alliance\ntemptress anymore. You and me are alike.\nI want to stay with you, no matter what. Now you have to decide between\nAlliance or Maximal. Just remember I&#39;ll stay no matter what you pick.&quot;\n\nHe put his hands on her cheeks, rubing away any tears.\n&quot;Omae o korosu,&quot; he said in Japanese.\nHe then kissed her, with all the love he felt for her.\n\n"}}
