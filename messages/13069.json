I&#39;e also been \nthinking about the emotional strain this mission is gonna cause. I \nmean, this was OUR ship. It&#39;s OUR dead friends were going to see. \nRemember Gekkidama? We were running to safety with him, and than that \nbanister fell on him. We watched him die! This.....if it wasn&#39;t for \nthe good of the Maximals, I wouldn&#39;t be doing it. But are you ready?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah...I guess...&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. Let&#39;s go find Spears and Striker.&quot;\n\nThe two go into the Ark and find them.\n\n&quot;Hey. We&#39;re taking off in about a mega-cycle. What parts do you need?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
