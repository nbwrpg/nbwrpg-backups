Much like Lord \n&gt; &gt; Elder&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was eff=\r\nective but the sweep disperesed, leaving \nhim \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or tw=\r\no out of the air at a time rather then \ndestroying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at =\r\na time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and=\r\n Rodimus all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approached from their different vectors, they could a=\r\nll see \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grim \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of the=\r\nm was staggering. \nAt \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; center of all this Cyclonus floated=\r\n a cold calm amidst the \n&gt; storm \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweeps that floated aroun=\r\nd him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To those who had been at the battle above Atlantis=\r\n the sight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brought \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although there were no=\r\nt as many sweep here \nas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclo=\r\nnus were several other minions: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Nightstrike as=\r\n well as three others which were unknown - \nA \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warning that this ba=\r\nttle may prove to be far more dangerous \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one bef=\r\nore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon att=\r\nack \nproved \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several swe=\r\neps and singed several \n&gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of =\r\nhis way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns open=\r\ning up on the \n&gt; &gt; rear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into t=\r\nhe skies as several \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many m=\r\nore came in to take their places. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled ar=\r\nound, absorbing the attacks from the \n&gt; would-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defenders,=\r\n in unison they began to open fire on Ark and \nLegacy \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well a=\r\ns Grimlock and the defending shuttle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At same time minions=\r\n were receiving orders from Scourge who \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself floating into=\r\n position and was more then ready to \nprove \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nigh=\r\ntstrike and Darkfate You are with me! \nWe \n&gt; go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroy =\r\nthe ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was =\r\nquick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered h=\r\nimself into position near the top of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; host.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\ntrangely the response for the approaching Decepticons and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predicons =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a bit different - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncombat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was initiated.

Many will die. The fate of everything in &lt;BR&gt;their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; existence could be changed by the outcome. He was happy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the sound of screeching tires Rodimus heads right into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; battle. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He vehical form leaps into the air and transforms. He lands on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; knee near the Maximal shuttle. Rodimus slowly raises to a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; standing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; position.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He looks up at Cyclonus and releases an all out assualt. Over &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shouler rockets, his rapid fire wrist mounts, optic lasers and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; duel weld machine pistols.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Kup::&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very far from the battle Kup was with Elita at the Watcher &lt;BR&gt;&gt; base. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; watched the readout screen in horror. In the last hour he had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; watched &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; all the forces of each battle converge at one point: the Ark! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was the big push and they had to push back. He knew what must &lt;BR&gt;be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; done.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Elita, you must do\n me a favor.

Using their agility and speed they turned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies &lt;BR&gt;with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bullets and energy!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy for his\n part pulled back, using the Ark as an &lt;BR&gt;additional &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweeps. Much like Lord &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Elder&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep disperesed, leaving &lt;BR&gt;him &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time rather then &lt;BR&gt;destroying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approached from their different vectors, they could all see &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grim &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. &lt;BR&gt;At &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; center of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; storm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweeps that floated around him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n To those who had been at the battle above Atlantis the sight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; brought &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although there were not as many sweep here &lt;BR&gt;as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several other minions: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Nightstrike as well as three others which were unknown - &lt;BR&gt;A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warning that this battle may prove to be far more dangerous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon attack &lt;BR&gt;proved &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps and singed several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Hydras approached\n from the rear his guns opening up on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rear &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their places. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark and &lt;BR&gt;Legacy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At same time minions were receiving orders from Scourge who &lt;BR&gt;was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself floating into position and was more then ready to &lt;BR&gt;prove &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are with me! &lt;BR&gt;We &lt;BR&gt;&gt; go &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE\n the Matrix!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered himself into position near the top of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; host.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Strangely the response for the approaching Decepticons and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Predicons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a bit different - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; combat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was initiated.
