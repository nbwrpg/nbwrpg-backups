You \nwould&#39;ve figured by now that someone would have succeeded. Tavatron \ntensed slightly at the sudden movement as Pyro(I think it&#39;s him) \nlifted her higher and held her suspended in mid-air for a moment. \nTavatron&#39;s eyes instinctively darted about the room, something wasn&#39;t \nright. Tavatron&#39;s body shook as several shots connected with her \nalready charred form, resulting in several very black spots of burnt \nfur. \n\nThe smell of her own smoking fur caused her eyes to water slightly. \nNow it seemed she was a living shield. This day just kept getting \nbetter and better. Tavatron&#39;s hind legs dragged on the ground as Pyro \npulled her into yet another room. Tavatron growled softly:\n\n&quot;Where the slag are we?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
