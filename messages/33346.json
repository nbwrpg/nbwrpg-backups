Of course you do! Okay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves well because it&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, it&#39;s where you are when you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime to leave the base, it&#39;s \nalso where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got all these cool computers and stuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s where we are right now! Isn&#39;t that a coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s a nice room maybe a little too dusty but then again maybe not and it&#39;s a good room because it has lots of room, and it \nleads into all of the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the biggest rooms, which is good, because everyone might try to come in at the same time, and if they do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be crowded and the base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might happen like \nsomeone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone will get shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t think I did, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong because I&#39;m right. Anyway, I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s your name, I&#39;m not calling you \nSquawktalk, that would be silly, wouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have a nice name, you probably do, but I still hope, because hoping can get you stuff sometimes, and anyway, it&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should be nice because my name is cool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I was trying to say \nis that maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to the next room? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and we&#39;ll be in the next one instead and I can talk to you in there just hurry up and don&#39;t take forever, okay?...\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
