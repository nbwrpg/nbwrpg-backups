I had insulated your section until you returned, so t=\r\nhat nothing would happen that you didn&#39;t want or expect. But that also mean=\r\ns that your players are largely in the dark :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The easiest thing to do=\r\n would be have your characters call in for an update since I am sure they a=\r\nre as curious as you are. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; From communication chatter your team woul=\r\nd have heard and/or deduced that Tuscon and some others went to recover Rod=\r\nimus once and for all using some ruse that he and Nightshift had cooked up.=\r\n Tuscon and others were eventually captured but then somehow got free, and =\r\nat first appeared successful at recovering Rodimus but soon after communica=\r\ntions were lost with Tuscon and his team as he attempted to make his way ba=\r\nck. \n&gt; \n&gt; He has since returned bringing back a heavily damaged Rodimus and=\r\n a Predacon. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sandy,\n&gt; \n&gt; You are exactly right, I was wondering why n=\r\nobody responded to my post. I can see where it was sent out, and all the ta=\r\ngs on my side said that it was, but I see nothing on the list. I guess now =\r\nI see :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I will resend. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
