He looks back at Ignatius.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They wouldn&#39;t terminate Prebon, but they might not know who he is.\n&gt; They might try to reprogram him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks back as the computer beeps, watching weapon stats come up on\n&gt; screen. The weapon he had been looking for had been found. Even\n&gt; though Slayer didn&#39;t know it, it was the weapon that had been used to\n&gt; convert Spears to a Trainer. It shot chips that stunned the bot and\n&gt; then gradually reprogrammed him into Prebon&#39;s slave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I think this is what we&#39;ll need,&quot; Slayer says, reading the\n&gt; specs, &quot;It was originally meant to be used by a gestalt, but I think\n&gt; we can modify it to be carried by two bots. I doubt the technology\n&gt; involved can be shrunk small enough for one bot to carry it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius was hurt but his internal repairs were compensating\n&gt; nicely. &quot;I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; be fine, what do you need me to do?&quot; he stared at the transmetal\n&gt; bot, almost\n&gt; &gt; amazed on how strong he was. &quot;I&#39;d bet that Prebons still alive, no\n&gt; faction\n&gt; &gt; would destroy such a high level hostage.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
