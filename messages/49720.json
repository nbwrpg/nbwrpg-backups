I made sure to have all \nthe neccesary supplies because I thought I&#39;d need to transport it to \nMegatron.  I offer half my cargo to you.  I suggest you send someone \nto decide what you need the most.  I have everything from energon \ncubes, obviously useless on this planet, to ship parts, to ammo, to \nweapons, to any other technical supplies you might need.\n\nFlicker began calculating strategies in case of a double-cross.\n\nFlicker:  Oh and whoever you send should bring Phoenix with him.  I \ndon&#39;t want to let her out of my sight.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: It was an intentional miss, but I guess reflexes still do \ntheir \n&gt; thing.  BTW, the base itself is also cloaked.  And if Flicker&#39;s at \n&gt; close range, he&#39;d have to look WAY up to see Gatara&#39;s face - she&#39;s \n&gt; twelve feet tall, remember.  The average BW bot is slightly less \nthan \n&gt; half that, from what I know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gatara laughs.  &quot;You know as well as I do that Phoenix is no \n&gt; Predacon.  However, since you seem so ... concerned for her \nwelfare, \n&gt; I will consider your offer.  What means, if any, do you have of \n&gt; transporting these supplies of yours?  They&#39;re obviously not here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jayde rolls her eyes and twirls her nailgun.  &quot;You actually had to \n&gt; SAY that?&quot; she chortles.  Gatara silences her with a glare, then \n&gt; turns her attention back to Flicker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Riekan remains nearly emotionless and seemingly apathetic.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: O.k.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:  Flicker dodges the grenade and transforms to robot mode, \n&gt; &gt; landing in the middle.  He holds a plasma rifle, not pointed at \n&gt; &gt; anyone, so it&#39;s not threatening, but the barrel is closer to \nGatara \n&gt; &gt; than any other Rouge.  He stares at her with contempt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  We Predicons have a reputation of backstabbing, her \nsense \n&gt; &gt; of loyalty is something few of us have.  I intend to show her I \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; learned at least a little loyalty from her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His voice remains calm, but a tear comes to his eye where it is \n&gt; &gt; plainly visable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  Now tell me.....what are your terms?\n\n\n"}}
