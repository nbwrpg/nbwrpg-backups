The sound \nsending chills down her spine, perhaps she had gone a little too far. She \nthen caught a look of anger in his usually emotionless eyes. Tavatron \ngrowled softly, this could definitely be a problem.\n\nTavatron saw Dinobot&#39;s muscles tense as he snapped just inches behind her. \nHis metallic jaws making a frightening snap as he nearly caught her tail. \nTavatron howled when he clipped her fur. Enough was enough, no one snapped \nher fur and got away with it! However, when Dinobot failed to do any real \ndamage Tavatron relaxed. If he had desired to do so Dinobot could&#39;ve easily \novertaken and knocked her to the ground. So, this was all some sort of \nelaborate game. She wasn&#39;t one to turn down a challenge:\n\n&quot;Or perhaps it is I that looks better than you!&quot; Tavatron spun around and \nsnapped at Dinbot&#39;s snout, centemeters from his own snapping jaws. She \npulled back and growled playfully as she ran towards the ark, the massive \ndoors looming before them. She pushed the door open with her front paws and \ndropped to the ground, edging her way into the ark through the partially \nopened doors. She looked behind her, waiting for Dinobot:\n\n&quot;We&#39;re late for the meeting...&quot; Tavatron thought for a moment, insults \nweren&#39;t really her specialty but she was willing to give it a shot. Tavatron \nthought back to how Dinobot had nearly clipped her tail just moments ago. \nClipperface? no, that was just stupid. No, not clipped, chop:\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon Chopperface. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Tavatron smiled and gestured toward the War \nRoom with her head. So it wasn&#39;t her best comment, it was better than \nnothing! Besides, Chopperface seemed to fit.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
