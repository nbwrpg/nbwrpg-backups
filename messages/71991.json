The ship was still\n&gt; in excellent repairs, everythin=\r\ng powered and ready to go, it being\n&gt; able to to everything but fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nKY SHADOW came to meet HYDRAS as he came to the entrance. &quot;Greetings\n&gt; sir.=\r\n&quot; he said in overly docile tones. &quot;It is good to see you have\n&gt; returned so=\r\n quickly and with new soldiers.&quot; It is obvious he had\n&gt; already seen VICE G=\r\nRIP as he was brought in and he looked over at\n&gt; DINOBOT as well. &quot;Good . g=\r\nood.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a pause from SKY SHADOW, &quot;Where is Taratulus? I though=\r\nt he\n&gt; went out with you, but I do not see him with you Lord Hydras?&quot; There=\r\n\n&gt; was a brief smile from SKY SHADOW, one that was immediately covered by\n&gt;=\r\n a look of (false?) sorrow. &quot;He wasn&#39;t damaged out in battle was he?&quot;\n&gt; \n\nO=\r\nOC - GUH, didn&#39;t realize they were outside of the base.  My bad, thanks for=\r\n going with it.\n\n&lt;NEW - VICE GRIP AND DINOBOT&gt;\n\nWith VICE GRIP still mostly=\r\n incapacitated, there was a feral looking grin from DINOBOT, &quot;I see that it=\r\n is still possible to indulge oneself in learning thier proper place.  Woul=\r\nd you deny your Master such simple pleasures now, Soldier?&quot;  As he walked a=\r\nlong wtih INFERNO back towards the base.\n\nThen pausing as he nodded over at=\r\n SKY SHADOW, &quot;We can only hope that wahtever damage he has had sustained to=\r\n himself has furthered his own level of incapacitation for now.&quot;  Then upon=\r\n seeing WASPINATOR&#39;s damaged shoulder, his optics flickered over..\n\nSomethi=\r\nng low and building in the air..  Finally, for a moment all was quiet as th=\r\ne new DINOBOT gave in and indulged himself, &quot;For old time&#39;s sake.&quot;  Movign =\r\nthen to assault WASPINATOR, trying to yank out his arm and then bonk him ov=\r\ner the head with it.\n\nOOC - Could..  Not..  Resist..  The amusement of maul=\r\ning Bugbrain further.  I&#39;ve been here nearly a month posting and he&#39;s not b=\r\neen blasted to pieces yet!\n\n\n"}}
