At long last the Autobots would be \ndestroyed....as \n&gt; would all the transformers on the planet, including his body. But \nit was a \n&gt; small sacrifice if that ment the Decepticons would be destroyed. \nHis plan, \n&gt; once in control of the Armada, would be to completely obliterate \nthe planet, \n&gt; the transformers, Predacons included, and humans. As for the \n&gt; Decepticons.....if Aracnia didnt hand them over then that would \ncomplicate \n&gt; things. But he was sure that one fraction would bring them to him \nif that \n&gt; ment that they could be spared. The bloodshed would be great, but \nit would be \n&gt; worth it.\n\n\n"}}
