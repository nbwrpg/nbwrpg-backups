How did Megatron manages lead us, he\n&gt; thought to himself. This one seemed to like to hear the sound of his own\n&gt; voice. But there was silence, ahhhh blessed silence. He looked around\n&gt; though, he couldnt see where the robot had gone. He looked down and saw him\n&gt; sitting on his foot. He strained himself hard, not to grab down, and mash\n&gt; the robot right away. They needed as many troops as possible. Maybe later,\n&gt; he thought to himself, as he violently kicked the leg that Switchblade was\n&gt; sitting on, to send him flying.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
