I thought they were still at the CF.\n\nAstral flies into the battle, firing twenty shots at Prebon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPrebon continues to fall back, as the shots hit his armor, It seemed that he\nhad underestimated the alliances forces. They still had a chance, so far\nthere were only about two- one odds, not much of a challenge for a team as\nskilled as the Trainers. Each member was programed for leadership, each knew\nthier places. He knew that the alliance weren&#39;t as invincible as they had\nclaimed. This attack was never meant as a conquering assault, it was meant\nto take the measure of Alliance technology. So far it was as he thought,\nthey were up against typical Predacon technology, Since it was typical it\ncould be defeated. Prebon fired five shots from his constrictor rifle at\nAstral and two missles at Fenox.\n\n\nFenox flies in behind her leader, firing several bolts at Blaze.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBlaze spread out away from Prebon, the only way to defeat an enemy like the\nalliance was to take them on directly. If her team let the alliance troops\ngather together they&#39;d have a major strategic advantage,. If they could keep\nthe enemy off gaurd they could force them to act unpredictably. She fealt a\nsudden breeze from behind her, she turned and saw Fenox making his move. She\nfired five shots from her disruptor disabling some of the bolts and\ncontinuing at Fenox. Bolts rained down on her like the weather during a\nplasma storm. She curled into a defensive position and put an energy shield\nabove her, it wasn&#39;t designed to cover her entire body so some of the bolts\nsnuck through striking her in the legs. The bolts wouldn&#39;t do much damage to\nher legs unless she let them continue to strike her.\n\n\nStarlight glides into the battle, firing three darts (with\ntranquilizer) at Bullet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBullets body was built to strong for the darts causing them to bounce off\nharmlessly. If the alliance was to do damage to the bot that turned into a\nbull they&#39;d have to use something a little stronger. &quot;What is this, Make me\nangry day? To bad you&#39;ll have to try a little harder.&quot; The horns on top of\nhis head glowed and fired a force bolt at Starlight.\nGriplash flies/falls with stile into the scene, firing two missiles\nat Iguanus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Iron Fist&#39;s defences keep firing.\n\n(What are the defenses and puick a target,)\n\nHammer moved forward when a blaster targeted him, the bot hadn&#39;t scanned far\nenough ahead to detect it. The shot hit the ground in front of him sending\nhim backward. Another shot hit next to him, if he didn&#39;t know better he&#39;d\nthink he was being herded somewhere. (Hows that for a hint?)\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, December 28, 2000 10:44 PM\nSubject: Re: attacking the alliance\n\n\n&gt; Where would you find limited cover? The only thing for miles around\n&gt; is the ocean. I don&#39;t think waves offer too good a protection.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, please don&#39;t post damage for my ship. It&#39;ll take alot more than\n&gt; what you&#39;re firing right now to weaken the shields to any really\n&gt; noticable. Remember, it took 30 Alliance bots over a week (real time)\n&gt; of battle to take down the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s shields, and the Iron\n&gt; Fist is stronger than the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; One last thing, please post for my Lavacons attacking your troops.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Havoc/Astral/Fenox/Starlight/Griplash/Recklessa/Slayer::\n&gt;\n&gt; The shots fired by the Trainers hit the shields, Zardus laughing.

The underwater defences of the Iron Fist begin to\n&gt; activate.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc smiles as the shots from Bullet&#39;s disruptor are intercepted by\n&gt; the shields. The shields let things out, but they didn&#39;t let them in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Havoc fires two missiles at Bullet, still laughing.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The Lavacons continue to fire at the Trainers.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK Yanshosh, since theres already been posts involving cover I&#39;ll\n&gt; say\n&gt; &gt; limited cover. As for distance, they&#39;re supposedly a superior race\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; miles is nothing to thier main weapons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bullet looks up, seeing havok, The missles head toward him faster\n&gt; than he\n&gt; &gt; can react. Suddenly the missles explode in mid air as a burst of\n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; strikes them down. Blaze stands, disruptor in hand awaiting further\n&gt; attacks.\n&gt; &gt; She aims at Hovok firing three shots from her disruptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius joins Slayer in his attempts to bring down Wheeljack. he\n&gt; fires his\n&gt; &gt; eyebeams at the Alliance bot, and two missles at the shields\n&gt; covering the\n&gt; &gt; power unit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hammer rises again and fires an energy beam across the battlefield,\n&gt; moving\n&gt; &gt; back and forth at Sharpedge and Godfather.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re taking abuse here&quot; Hammer calls out. With the limited cover\n&gt; he didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; feel such a small unit could be much effect.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prebon believed differently though as he continued to push for\n&gt; advancement,\n&gt; &gt; the disruptorblasts were doing thier job and weakening the shields\n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; still wasn&#39;t fast enough. &quot;Continue the advance, so far theres been\n&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; resistance, as long as they can&#39;t call for reinforcements we have\n&gt; the upper\n&gt; &gt; hand.&quot; Prebons inspirational words pushed the Trainers forward with\n&gt; the need\n&gt; &gt; for success or deleation. Failure was not a possability or an\n&gt; option.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
