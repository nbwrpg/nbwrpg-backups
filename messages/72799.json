Forgot all about that part. Of course, unlike the Preds,\n&gt; we come from derivatives of Primus, just as the Autobots did.  Cryotek&#39;s\n&gt; right, whoever it is, wants ta repeat history and do the Unicron thing.\n&gt; Yikes, that&#39;s unnerving .&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nINJECTOR, one of SKYSHADOW&#39;s FUZOR&#39;s turned to look at RAT TRAP, &quot;Are\nyou saying that you are the only offspring of Primus?&quot; His look was\ndangerous as he glared at the MAXIMAL.\n\nThere was a quiet chuckle from CRYOTEK, &quot;Who can say with Maximals,\nthey are like the old Autobots.&quot; He said to INJECTOR, &quot;They rewrite\nhistory as they see fit.&quot;\n\nLooking over at RAT TRAP he continued, &quot;Decepticons were built from\nthe same mold as Autobots but for a different purpose.&quot;\n\nINJECTOR nodded as he looked at the MAXIMALS, &quot;Autobots and\nDecepticons, Maximals and Predacons.&quot; he said firmly.\n\n&quot;Some say it was Quintessons who built all of us, &quot;CRYOTEK continued,\n&quot;others say Primus himself.&quot; CRYOTEK gestured at the rest, &quot;There are\nas many theories as there are atoms in the universe.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded, &quot;I believe that even Galvatron was Megatron at one\ntime who while evil to the core was still a product of Primus, until\nhe was twisted further by Unicron.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks up.  She seemed to have a different thought about what\n&gt; was going on.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s a test, I bet it is.  It&#39;s a test of unity and leadership.  This test\n&gt; was meant for ALL of us but I can&#39;t help thinking that this had ta happen\n&gt; just as Tucson becomes a Prime and how we lost Rodimus to darker forces for\n&gt; the second consecutive time in a row.  It&#39;s as if events are testing the\n&gt; future leadership of our faction and determining who will be worthy enough\n&gt; to carry the Matrix once it&#39;s recovered. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And if the chosen leader is strong enough to unify all against the forces\n&gt; of Unicron.  Tucson took that step when he brought us together.  He&#39;s taken\n&gt; a serious gamble by doing that.  And ta me, that was pretty darn brave of\n&gt; him.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded again, &quot;Perhaps you are right, who can say. In the\nend it is always a test of leader ship for anyone. To maintain order\nand unity among ones troops.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; An improvemewnt in scanning range in the dense jungle underbrush was still\n&gt; useless, given that if they were to come in under assault by the time an\n&gt; opponent was charging them they might get a resposne from it.  But still, it\n&gt; was less negligbly useless than before.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, using WASPINATOR to calibrate, BLACKARACHNIA was able to\n&gt; determine that HYDRAS was nowhere in the vicinity, with a muttered sense of\n&gt; the CYBERTRONIAN language equivalent of &#39;No Slag NIghtbeat&#39; going through\n&gt; her processor.\n&gt;\n&gt; And she listened to the commentary tossed out by CRYOTEK with extreme\n&gt; interest now.  He had a point.\n&gt;\n&gt; And who else had an unknown connection to Unicron..\n&gt;\n&gt; But Tarantalus?\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANTULUS&#39;s connection was rumored by some and guessed at by others,\nbut the full extent of it was unknown at present. Was he truely a\nspawn of the world destroyer or was it a rumor that TARANTULUS\nsecretely fostered to inhance his own agendas?\n\nQuestions, rummors, innuendoes - that was the province of TARANTULUS\nand it was a weapon that he wielded skillfully and with deadly affect.\nCould it be that HYDRAS has at last felt its sting or is some other\nwork afoot?\n\nOnly time would tell.\n\nLEO PRIME looked around, &quot;Where is Dinobot and Waspinator?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a thought of contemplation in the tunnels from VICE GRIP.\n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s some sort of jamming boundary or interference zone the deeper we\n&gt; go, the less range we have.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wondering if there was a lower &#39;sheathe&#39; to the jamming zone, he attempted\n&gt; to use his commsignal to try and &#39;bounce&#39; back the signal, as if using\n&gt; echolocation to try an dsee if he could locate the &#39;bottom&#39; of it, in any\n&gt; sense of the word.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVICE GRIP could quickly see a spike in the jamming of the signal as if\nthey were heading towards the source of it. The further he went down\ninto the tunnels, the more pronounced the affect.\n\nThe question was, would he continue on or would he return to the\nsurface and inform the others?\n\nHe began to hear a low level hum.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
