Don&#39;t \nexpect life to be easy; Rogue Star&#39;s defenses and sensors are fully \noperational and a single transformer has no hope in hell of breaking \nor sneaking through.\n\nTorin/Phoenix::\n\nFlat-out bored, Torin watches the screens.  Without replacement \nparts, the engines cannot be brought online.  The jack-of-all-trades \nbot feels a wave of frustration, knowing that Rogue Star has lost its \nmost crucial advantage - maneuverability - while leaving most of its \nother systems functional like a taunt.\n\nThen the scanners pick up a lone Predacon, making a beeline for the \ndowned ship.  Torin blinks.  How could they have penetrated the \nRogues&#39; cloaking technology so easily?  Concerned, he monitors the \ninterloper&#39;s approach, sending a coded alert to Gatara.\n\n-----\n\nPhoenix collapses to the floor in despair at her sitiuation.  If only \nshe could get the door open!  But all her efforts are in vain; \nnothing she can think of would budge the portal other than firing her \nincendiary rockets at it - and she lacks ammunition for her weapons.\n\nBurying her head in her arms, the prisoner cries herself to sleep.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker continued looking at the monitor.

IT&#39;S HER!\n&gt; \n&gt; He runs to a stasis pod and takes a firefly Beast Mode.  Then he \n&gt; opens the door and activates a fairly weak energy shield and sets \noff \n&gt; towards the Rouges base.\n\n\n"}}
