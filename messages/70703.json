He sighs, closes his eyes for a moment, and opens them, even thoug=\r\nh he could see nothing but darkness.  He gently holds Talon&#39;s hand with a s=\r\nmile.\n\n&quot;Thank you.  It - won&#39;t be long until I can actually see you with my=\r\n own optics.  Question is, can I wait for that period of time? I can feel h=\r\now beautiful you are, with my hands, but, it&#39;s nothing like being able to s=\r\nee your beauty for myself.  I can&#39;t wait to see what my hands have felt for=\r\n so long.&quot;\n\nHe gently embraces her hand.
