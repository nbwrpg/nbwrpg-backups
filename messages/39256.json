They also reported a bot approaching from behind, and by\nthe time the gattling gun was fired, Slayer manages to dodge most of it, the\nblast blowing off one of his back feet.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks back at the three bots behind him, growling and heading a bit to\nthe left, flying above ocean now, continuing to head south.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He arrives at Kali&#39;s position and transformes to bot mode.
