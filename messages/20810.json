She fell into a deep sleep. \n\nHer mind stilll focused on the cage. She had always been free. Free \nto move where the wind took her. Now with her new body, she could \nhave been free to roam the iced lands and wander where the land took \nher. But instead, this virus trapped her. She was a threat to herself \nand all those around her. She could see the cage of metal bars \nsurounding her and keeping her shut in.  She was no longer free, but \na prisoner. And one the might have to be destroyed. She roared out in \nher sleep as the thought of them having to kill her ran through her \nthoughts. Despite the seditive, she was in a fitful sleep. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOPS, tried to reply yesterday, guess it didn&#39;t go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine sensed fear from Ice, she was becomeing more terrified at \nevery\n&gt; moment. He set her inside the transport pod and set the coordinates \nfor\n&gt; Veratis&#39; base. The pod quickly sped back to the base in time to \nsave Ice.\n&gt; Lunarpine tried to make sense of her thoughts, they seemed mixxed \nup beyond\n&gt; comprehension. She wasn&#39;t afraid of the virus, she was more afraid \nof\n&gt; something else. he tried to focus, the visions made little sense to \nhim. Why\n&gt; would she be thinking about a cage at a time like this. Her roar \nechoed\n&gt; deafeningly in his head. &quot;Calm down.&quot; He shouted to her hopeing she \nhad at\n&gt; least a little comprehension. The cleaning drones helped the \nstruggling bot\n&gt; carry Ice back inside and into the lab. He forced himself to resist \nthe urge\n&gt; to scream as he placed her into her CR chamber. He hoped that this \nwould\n&gt; settle her. Almost immediately a sedative flooded the tank intended \nto calm\n&gt; her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis raced into the lab and activated the DNA sequencers. He \nhoped that\n&gt; the intervention of her origional DNA would counteract the virus. \nHe held\n&gt; his head as if it would explode if he let go. &quot;What happened out \nthere?&quot; the\n&gt; old science bot asked when the sedative took effect on Ice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;She paniced I think.&quot; Lunarpine answered looking on at her new \nform inside\n&gt; the chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; Veratis stated in an almost demanding manner \nas he\n&gt; pointed Lunarpine into the other chamber. &quot;We can&#39;t take the chance \nthat the\n&gt; virus may have mutated.&quot; Veratis watched the scanners as Lunarpine \nstepped\n&gt; inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers locked himself in his room while he waited for the viral\n&gt; emergency to calm down. He suddenly came to a paniced realization. \nHis\n&gt; samples were in the lab with the infected bots. If they were \ncontaminated\n&gt; thered be hell to pay.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
