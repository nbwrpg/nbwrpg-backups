Gas that was meant to put her into stasis until the enemy could \nfind her and remove the cloaking device.\nShe growled. Clever bastards!\nReaching into her leg compartment she took out a small air mask which \ncloaked her voice as well.\nHowever, it had to be programed to do so.\nShe lifted her snout so that it was above the rising gas, lifting her arms \nabove her head and watching her fingers as they fiddles with wires.\nThere! It was done!\nBrightBlade quickly snapped the mask over her snout and breathed in a sigh.\nThat was close!\nBut then her scanners allerted her, there was a bot heading towards the \nchamber. Signature told her that it was that Rex, bot.\nShe growled and readied her gun, she may not kill him, but she&#39;ll injure \nhim!*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
