It gave me the chance to make things interrestin=\r\ng. \n&gt; Remember Tucson&#39;s weakness?  Well, part of that is starting to surfac=\r\ne. \n&gt; He&#39;s lost his temper and Straight Shot picked up on it. But to cover =\r\n\n&gt; himself, he told her it was a pure bluff.  So it looks like he&#39;s bluffin=\r\ng to \n&gt; try to fool the enemy, or is it really a bluff? Did he mean everyth=\r\ning he \n&gt; said, and did he also intend to ram his foot into Megatron&#39;s fall=\r\nen body? \n&gt; This is a great chance for Rodimus to over come his self doubt =\r\nas his own \n&gt; comrade&#39;s emotional stability seems to be wearing thin.  And =\r\nnow, he \n&gt; threatens to put an arrow straight through the chest of the fall=\r\nen \n&gt; Decepticon leader, if the enemy does not stand down.  You could call =\r\nthis a \n&gt; fit of bottled up rage that he&#39;s had for a long time, since his o=\r\nwn \n&gt; unfortunate incident when he was shot down and taken off line, only t=\r\no fail \n&gt; in his mission to protect his comrades.  He doesn&#39;t take failure =\r\nvery well \n&gt; since that, and he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make sure =\r\nit doesn&#39;t \n&gt; happen again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot doesn&#39;t know the full scope =\r\nof Tucson&#39;s issues, it may be up \n&gt; to Rodimus to fill in the gaps for her.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as what happened, it was the day that Rodimus had been taken b=\r\ny \n&gt; Hydras, as Tucson desperately tried to fend off the enemy, by providin=\r\ng a \n&gt; decoy to get the enemy to focus on him rather than Rodimus.  He was =\r\ntaken \n&gt; off line by Cyclonus long before he could actually accomplish what=\r\n he was \n&gt; trying to do, and the only one who saw that shot, was Straight S=\r\nhot, who \n&gt; just shortly after that, was taken off line herself.  Tucson wa=\r\ns in vehicle \n&gt; mode when it happened, and can not remember anything of tha=\r\nt battle due to \n&gt; the cranial shot he endured.  This is what makes him so =\r\nangry.  The fact \n&gt; that he feels that he failed Rodimus and the others the=\r\n first time, and now \n&gt; he&#39;s in danger of failing them again.  You could sa=\r\ny that even though he may \n&gt; think he doesn&#39;t need help, he could really us=\r\ne Rodimus&#39;s support right \n&gt; about now.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I hope to be posting t=\r\nommorrow or so, so many things to catch up\n&gt; &gt; in so many places. But I had=\r\n a question :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How is Talon inside Tuscon? When Tuscon transforms b=\r\nack into robot\n&gt; &gt; mode he is roughly human hieght or slightly larger, the =\r\nsame height as\n&gt; &gt; nearly all the Maximals and Predacons are more or less. =\r\nTalon would be\n&gt; &gt; approximately the same size as Tuscon in this form - per=\r\nhaps a few\n&gt; &gt; inches shorter or so - seeing as Tuscon is a Prime an all th=\r\nat. But\n&gt; &gt; having said that, having Tuscon holding holding Talon inside, t=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; would be a bit . . . um . . . messy?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And I want to apologiz=\r\ne about Tuscon&#39;s arrow. It was not that it was\n&gt; &gt; ineffective, but it was =\r\njust that Nightrazor was not visable any\n&gt; &gt; longer. When I am crafting a p=\r\nost, I try to take into account just how\n&gt; &gt; much conversation or other act=\r\nions have gone on between each move. If\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon was tapping out his comm=\r\nunication to Rodimus and Straight Shot,\n&gt; &gt; then that gave Nightrazor time =\r\nto hide or make other choices. I was\n&gt; &gt; giving you a hint to that when I h=\r\nad Rodimus speak in short sentences\n&gt; &gt; and remind Tuscon that the intruder=\r\n would not wait for lengthy\n&gt; &gt; communications.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not trying to =\r\nbe mean. As a suggestion, imagine yourself saying\n&gt; &gt; the things Tuscon is =\r\nsaying in the middle of a battle or an intense\n&gt; &gt; scene and you will see w=\r\nhat I mean. Imagine how many things you could\n&gt; &gt; have done in the time tha=\r\nt it would have taken for Tuscon to\n&gt; &gt; communicate the information he did =\r\nin morris code to straightshot and\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, not trying t=\r\no be mean, just accurate and realistic as I can be\n&gt; &gt; in a made up world w=\r\nhere robots can transform and we break laws of\n&gt; &gt; physics with every strok=\r\ne of the pen :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 11, 2011 at 10:54 AM, S=\r\nandy &lt;magicquartz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Replying to Airly&#39;s=\r\n post first, going in that sequence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inside th=\r\ne Ark, Tucson puts his hand over his chest, and gently does as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon=\r\n had asked.

He knew he couldn&#39;t avoid=\r\n stumping his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comrades but he knew that in the long run it was the o=\r\nnly way to save \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them.

You okay&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstride pats him on the shoulder.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Just fine. Remember that pool of gunk I found a few clicks from =\r\nhere? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some sorta tar pit?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Oh=\r\nh yeah, that. Why&#39;dya bring that up now?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstride grins.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I got an idea. What if we did a fake surrender, and y&#39;know..&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I get it. Wonder if they&#39;d fall for =\r\nit? It&#39;s worth a try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickstride now approach Deep=\r\n Stryke and the others with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their hands up in submission. Quickstrid=\r\ne is the first to approach them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you g=\r\not us. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy way inta the ark hmm?=\r\n That way we all get what we want and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s happy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Far outside the parameters of the Ark, Night Shift and Rat Trap look up \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; in awe at the dinosaurs around them. Yet they keep quiet so is not to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alarm them. Yet, contact could not be helped as a young Stegasaurous=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; noses up to Night Shift, who is not in the least bit frightened by =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Woah, check this out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap gasps.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh geeze, let&#39;s hope it&#39;s parents ain&#39;t around here somewhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The baby dinosaur groans, and looks back into the brush. Night Shif=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; curiously follows it, and notices a larger stegasaurous standing t=\r\nhere \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a foot raised, with a large piece of wood lodged in it&#39;s l=\r\neft front \n&gt; &gt; &gt; foot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, don&#39;t go too close ta that thing! =\r\nWe dunno if it&#39;s friendly!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yelps Rat Trap, as Night Shift appr=\r\noaches it. He looks back to Rat Trap \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s oka=\r\ny, if it was gonna do somethn&#39; it would&#39;ve done it by now. Okay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; big =\r\nfella, easy. This is gonna hurt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With a swift hand he pulls th=\r\ne thorn out of the dino&#39;s foot. The dino \n&gt; &gt; &gt; roars slightly but is quick=\r\nly relieved of his pain. He&#39;s soon joined by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his mate, and it&#39;s clea=\r\nr to see, that this was a family of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stegasaurouses. He looks down to=\r\n Night Shift, and nudges his hand with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his nose gently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;It&#39;s okay big guy, no sweat, you go back with your family.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne stegasaurouses now retreat back into the forest, yet the little one \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; looks back once more thankfully and then retreats. Rat trap smiles as he =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watches them retreat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about meetn&#39; some pretty la=\r\nrge friends. I wonder if they&#39;d be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smart enough ta help us out if we=\r\n needed &#39;em?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Shift raises a brow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I dunno,=\r\n but judgn&#39; by the way they treated us, I bet they might just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rememb=\r\ner who we are if we came back this way.

Quo=\r\nckstride&#39;s large blast cannon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fires repeatedly into the air keepin=\r\ng the vicious Predacon at bay. One \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of his attacks catches him in t=\r\nhe fuselage sending Waspinator spinning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the air once more,=\r\n smoke trailing behind him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Waspinator hate all this!&quot; he =\r\nsaid as he sailed away!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windlor=\r\nd and Kup continue firing against Scourge and Deepstrike.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Windlord and Kup continue their firefight, Scourge =\r\nswung out around \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them, forcing them to change their attacks and sw=\r\ning with him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Deepstryke moved higher up and the other w=\r\nay, swinging his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiple cannon mounts around at the same time. H=\r\nowever instead of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; firing at Kup or Windlord he targets the door to=\r\n the Ark!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment. This was a great way to commun=\r\nicate because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor may not have any idea that Tucson was s=\r\ntill able to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communicate in this mode. He raises an optic and co=\r\nntinues to tap \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Don&#39;t take th=\r\nis the wrong way Rodimus, but it&#39;s the only way we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can communica=\r\nte in a way that Nightrazor has no notion of us doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so. Feel f=\r\nree to do the same, use the morse coding, it will help us \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unders=\r\ntand each other to apprehend him sufficiantly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Tuscon had his hands on Rodimus to pass the message he could =\r\nfeel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus move in the darkness, presumably nodding his head in =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Rodimus tapped back, knowing the code Tus=\r\ncon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was using.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Need move quick&quot; Rodimus tapped ba=\r\nck quickly, &quot;Intruder not wait us \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus m=\r\notioned for them to spread out, &quot;Your senses better, find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switch&quot; =\r\nhe tapped again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He stops to fe=\r\nel the vibrations of the floor. Then he puts out his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand to sen=\r\nse vibrations in the air. Through that, he could get a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faint ide=\r\na as to how the air circulates around various objects. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross b=\r\nreeze as stale as it was, would navigate him toward an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emergency=\r\n generator switch. He follows that breeze, and extends his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand =\r\nout to touch it, slowly comming to the device. With another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rais=\r\ne of the brow he carefully throws the switch and waits to see \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nat happens.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually as Tuscon was ju=\r\nst about to the generator control, but before \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he could pull it he =\r\nfound that he did not need to!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In moving he had stepped out=\r\n of the field of darkness and with a blink \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he could hear and his r=\r\nadar/sonar snapped back on, all sensors were a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However any scan back to where he came from would show that where he \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; was standing there was a large ball of darkness several meters across \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he could not scan, it was a globe of darkness and silence.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus stepped out of the other side of the globe blinking al=\r\nso \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously his sensors were coming back online too. He looked ar=\r\nound, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Where is the . . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;KABOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; With a deafening explosion the main door exploded off its hinges as =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the combined power of Cyclonus, Hydras, Deepstryke and several oth=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predacons blasted it! Fortunately the fallen bodies of the Auto=\r\nbots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Decepticons were too far away to receive more than a litt=\r\nle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rumbling and smoke, nothing that would significantly impact the=\r\nir \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slumber and their eventual awakening.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile=\r\n . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We must be carefull&quot;sai=\r\nd Talon with a moan, the pain was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unbearable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Can you set me in stasis???&quot;sais Talon with pain&quot;I donat know how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; much longer i could bear this pain...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Evidently whomever had placed Talon down had left Talon is a well \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shielded place, there was no damage to this Maximal as well. The \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; console that was between Talon and the door snapped off and was flung =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the room, but Talon continued to lay there, his systems \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merciful shutting him down, sending him into stasis lock.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor tried to seal all the corritors =\r\nthat lead to the sleep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decepticons and autobots.
