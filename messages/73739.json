He extends his\n&gt; talons out in an attempt to give Rodimus a claw out of the pit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; RODIMUS!  Grab my talons!  I&#39;ll get you out! &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS is pulled out by TUCSON and set down at a higher level where\nthe ground is more solid.\n\n&quot;What is that thing?&quot; RODIMUS said as he looked at the glowing object\nthat was still floating in the pit.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a manical grin from DINOBOT then, &quot;Rocks fall, everyMaximal\n&gt; dies.  Come, we must complete the rest of our mission now while they are\n&gt; suitably distracted.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Which was to secure a perimeter and then setup the sensor units for\n&gt; reinforcements to arrive.  Now with the MAXIMALS at the nearby ARK\n&gt; hopefully further distracted, they could accomplish this without further\n&gt; issue then as DINOBOT&#39;s optics flickered then, signalling to the\n&gt; TERRORCONS.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even better, the protohumans had scattered now, so they would hvae no\n&gt; issues hopefully wtih them acting as runners to alert the MAXIMALS to\n&gt; their positioning.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a confused communication from RIPPERSNAPPER to HUN-GRR,\n&quot;What was that?&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; HUN-GRR sent back. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that  the your explosion?&quot;\n\nThere was a pause, &quot;No.&quot; RIPPERSNAPPER said. &quot;We were about to when it\nall went up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Slag!&quot; HUN-GRR said as he looked back at the scene, what was going on\nhere, and what was that glowing thing in the pit.\n\nHUN-GRR sounded annoyed and frustrated, although none of it was aimed\ndirectly at DINOBOT.\n\n &quot;You got any ideas Dinobot?&quot; He said finally.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
