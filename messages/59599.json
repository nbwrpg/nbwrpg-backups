She figured she could \ndig with her sword, as her fireballs were simply inappropriate for \nthe rock, but then an idea hit her.\n\nShe concentrated and slowly, the slope she was on became darker and \ndarker, filled at first with shadow, but then with deep ink-like \ndarkness. She could see nothing, but thought she knew what was going \non. Even the sound could not escape.\n\nWhen she let go, exhausted, she marvelled at what she had done.\n\nA small opening in the rocky soil, one that tunnelled some feet deep \nin the ground, was now before her. All she had to do was to blow it \nup to get more space.\n\nShe sent the fireball and was soon propelled backward as the \nexplosion blew the rocks and dust up in the air. She smiled.\n\nDreadplague: Good! (She turned to her pred colleagues) Hey, Preds, \nhow are you doing?\n\n\n"}}
