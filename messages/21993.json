She picked up the clipboard and pen and \n&gt; started to jot things down. The clipboard floated in the air and \nthe \n&gt; pen was writing, but no one was holding it. Ice smiled as she \nwatches \n&gt; this. She was liking her new abilities.  She started to take notes \non \n&gt; her fighting and decided to try to find betters ways. She wanted to \n&gt; be a better fighter and not use her powers so much. It drained her \n&gt; when she over used them. She looked back at Razor Claw and \nLunarpine.\n&gt; &quot;You know, maybe you both can help me. I wasn&#39;t much a fighter \nbefore \n&gt; I became this new form.
