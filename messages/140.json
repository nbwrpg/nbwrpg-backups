His right optic was damaged to the \nextent that it no longer worked but his left optic still functioned fully!\nDinobot could not blame Tavatron for shooting him  directly in the face but \nthen she couldn&#39;t blame him for taking this practice to a whole new level! \nSurvival!\nIt had been YEARS since Dinobot had ever felt the pure rush of adrenaline \ncourse through his veins but that is what he felt now!\nIn fighting terms it was also known as &#39;Battle Rage!!!&#39;\nDinobot looked around with his one good optic and finally spotted Tavatron, \nhis target!!    He breathed in deeply and quickly then let out a roar so \nblood chillingly fierce that it could have made a rock run in fear!*\n\n\n&quot; RUN!!!&quot;\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
