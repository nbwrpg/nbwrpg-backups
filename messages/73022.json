Out of it how to get him I do\n&gt; not know, but remain this way he cannot go.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing up and running through his processor any conceivable way they could\n&gt; do.  They could not leave GRIMLOCK out here and abandon him to the jungle\n&gt; and recapture by whomever controlled him.  They could not take him with them\n&gt; in search and risk him attacking them each time his resistance was\n&gt; disrupted.  They couldn&#39;t do a processor jack-up out here in the field\n&gt; either to try and upload themselves to GRIMLOCK&#39;s central processor.\n&gt; Appealing to GRIMLOCk&#39;s pride only seemed to work as a part time blockage..\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, WHEELIE glanced at the others, &quot;All of you, go after who did this\n&gt; to him.  Here I will stay, with him.  I will try to keep him occupied, the\n&gt; rest of you free him for his pride.  Away from the scene, we shall go, wtih\n&gt; luck you shall be able to free him, how I do not know.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nGRIMLOCK stirred as he looked up his optics darkening, &quot;Me Grimlock\nsay we smash!&quot; He looked at the other DINOBOTS. &quot;Dinobots destroy\neverything!&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from SNARL and SLAG, their large heads nodding in\nagreement as SNARL swung with his heavy tail at the base of a large\ntree! He may not be as large as he once was, but he was still quite\nstrong.\n\nThe tree cracked and splintered and then began to slowly fall across\nthe center of the clearing they werre all standing in!\n\nBACKSTOP glanced over at WHEELIE as he spoke quietly. &quot;We were trying\nto lure them across that bridge.&quot; He pointed quietly as the trees that\nSWOOP had helped knock down a short while ago. &quot;Once they crossed that\nbridge and we knocked it away they would have been trapped on the\nother side.&quot;\n\nSWOOP nodded sadly as he glanced at GRIMLOCK. &quot;Me swoop only want to help.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile the DINOBOTS were turning to make their way back into the\njungle, walking away from the bridge BACKSTOP was talking about and\nback into the jungle itself.\n\n&quot;ROOAARR!!!&quot; The trees themselves swayed as GRIMLOCK&#39;s voice echoed out!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
