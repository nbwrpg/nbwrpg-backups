She found an updraft and rested a second gliding \n&gt; slowly trying to conserve her energy.  She had little left after \n&gt; manouvering throught the ice cannons.  She found a small tree \ngrowing \n&gt; on a hillside through the ice.  She stopped and perched for a \n&gt; moment.  She looked around for the Predacon, but didn&#39;t see it.  \nShe \n&gt; hoped she had lost him.  The wind blew arond her.  She felt cold \nall \n&gt; of a sudden.  Not from the artict temperatures, but from inside.  \nShe \n&gt; promised herself that if she made it through this, she would \n&gt; reprogramm herself into a better fighter.  She sighed and waited \nfor \n&gt; her spark to calm down before flying off again. She kept looking \nfor \n&gt; that pred on the horizon, but didn&#39;t see him. \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Orignal Message----\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine picks up the message from Perndabot, he scans the area \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the coordinates and swiftly moves toward them.

He frowns. \n&gt; &gt; Something was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong, he could feel it. He looks down at his hand, seeing that \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; was half \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transparent. No!
