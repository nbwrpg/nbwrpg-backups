He pulled against it,\n&gt; trying to swim for the surface. He couldn&#39;t see what had his leg, but he\n&gt; tried to slash at it with the fangs at the end of his arm. From the feel\nof\n&gt; it, it was metal, and smooth. He kicked at it. It wasn&#39;t too stable, like\nit\n&gt; was flexable.\n&gt;\n&gt; He didn&#39;t know how, but he mananed to get to the surface again. He coughed\n&gt; and screamed. He reached for Stingtra, but she was too far away. Another\nof\n&gt; the underwater things grabbed him around the shoulder. It looked like a\n&gt; golden segmented arm. The one on his leg and the one wrapped around his\n&gt; shoulder shoved him back down into the pitch black water. They pulled him\n&gt; fast into the water, barely able to fight against it. He felt another one\n&gt; brush against him. There were more under the water--going for Stingtra.\nBut\n&gt; he couldn&#39;t do anything. After he saw the other arms, the blackness took\n&gt; over his vision. He knew they were pulling him to someplace.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 18 Jul 2000 20:13:34 -0400\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;*Stingtra follows Quickstrike and than stares* Stingtra:...slag....\n&gt; &gt;*Stingtra is sumerged under water and pops her head up* Stingtra:\n&gt; &gt;Quickstrike?

It was\n&gt; &gt;nearly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch black at the end of it. He activated his infra red vision to\nmake\n&gt; &gt;it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easier to see. The farther it walked down, the more confusing it got.\nIt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked like it went at a dead end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He stopped and tilted his head, musing at what was behind his optics.\n&gt; &gt;Below\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, he heard the slight trickle of water. He looked down and saw at\n&gt; &gt;least\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an inch of water touching his feet, enough to make the ridges on the\n&gt; &gt;bottom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his feet disappear. He thought there must be a water source within\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cave.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as he was about to step ahead, he went down. It felt like the\n&gt; &gt;ground\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had collapsed--with the splash. The puddle of water that filled the\nhold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; area turned into a pool. Quickstrike twisted and turned, trying to\nfind\n&gt; &gt;what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way was up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He righted himself and tried his luck. His head surfaced, coughing\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surprise. After he got a breath, he felt something pull at him. There\n&gt; &gt;was\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tug, then a violent yank. He was again pulled underwater. But this\ntime\n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t fight to get back up to the surface. Something had his leg,\n&gt; &gt;pulling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Missing old school friends?
