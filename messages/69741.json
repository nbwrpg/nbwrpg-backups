Relay floats in the air above the great lakes, I imagine this being\non the ground somewhere near the shore of the lakes.  I don&#39;t think it has a\nconnection to the Beast Wars cartoon.  The few Silver Wings we had active\nwere chased out of the base by Jhaxius and they came to Atlantis.\n\nI imagine this being sort of a mine shaft design where the floor slopes down\nslowly from the entrance.  There might be a back exit tunnel that the minons\ncan use.  But it won&#39;t be obvious from the outside.\n\nOn Mar 6, 2010 4:58 AM, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\nHeya! :)\n\nSandy, if you want to post your characters arriving on scene, feel free to\ndo so. :)\n\nFor the old Maximal base, If I understand it correctly, and I am sure I will\nbe corrected if I am wrong, it is the Axalon&#39;s crash site, which was fixed\nup and utilized by the Maximals during the Beast War&#39;s cartoon.
