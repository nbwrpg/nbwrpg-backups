I&#39;d like it to be examined as a mode. What I mean, is that the energy is coming out of the sky, so basically you&#39;re saying that your take out someone&#39;s character, since I&#39;m sure that if it did minimal damage, Legendary Nemasis, you would feel offended, correct me if you wouldn&#39;t. All I&#39;m saying is that your attack is basically hitting, and I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s good. If Alloran is okay with it though, then I&#39;ve got no problem with the post, so I&#39;ll see what he says...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Legendarynemasis@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, July 07, 2001 12:15 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Regaining consciousness (Repost)/Nightlight and Termitron needs help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   As Banzai tron fires on trinity a massive beam of green light comes right \n&gt;   down on him, the beam is actually the non-pred friendly matrix energy.
