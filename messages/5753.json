All he had to do \nwas find out just how much more.\n\nHe set the ships controls for a high orbit to avoid any planetside \nsensors, and kept to the sunny side of Earth so sunspot activity \nmight hide any approaching ships. Three ships have arrived since he \ngot there, he didn&#39;t want to take the chance of a forth.\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, ddsg sdgfd &lt;earth2025abc@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Pantron watched as the ship landed.
