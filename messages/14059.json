The wound was near the\n&gt; spark, but missed it by an inch.  She picked up GoldenEye and took\n&gt; her to the entrance of the cave.  She put her just inside the door of\n&gt; the base, out of harms way.  &quot;Someone take her to the CR.  She&#39;s hit.&quot;\n&gt; GoldenEye sat slumped over near the entrance with bullet holes in her\n&gt; sides, chest, legs and wings.  She was leaking badly.\n&gt;\n&gt; KitKat ran back outside and continued to spray the Maximals with gun\n&gt; fire.  She took a few more hits in the shoulders and hip.  She\n&gt; groaned in pain, but continued to stand her ground.  This was her\n&gt; base and she wasn&#39;t giving up. She was leaking badly, but she didn&#39;t\n&gt; care.  She wsan&#39;t going to let a slagging maximal drive her from her\n&gt; own base.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
