All was clear now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dodging to the side of the sudden smash, WHEELIE went to do what he did\n&gt; best.  &quot;I thought GRIMLOCK was strong, but here you are playing to someone\n&gt; else&#39;s SONG!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dodging at long range, trying to get GRIMLOCK off balance, nto yet drawing\n&gt; his weapon, &quot;Here I see you out for play, under someone else&#39;s sway!  I\n&gt; thought the DINOBOTS were the strongest of htem all, not playing to someone\n&gt; else&#39;s thrall!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, firing his small energon slingshot with a bolt aimed at\n&gt; GRIMLOCK&#39;s &#39;nose&#39; in recreation of a long ago event, &quot;And here I thought you\n&gt; were mad, but this is all just really sad!  I thought I would see you great,\n&gt; not playing to someone else&#39;s skate!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE knew two things - that GRIMLOCK hated doing what anotehr told him,\n&gt; and that he got angry very easily.  So WHEELIE was hoping that by making\n&gt; Grimlock as ANGRY as the little bot (relatively) could, he could help\n&gt; GRIMLOCK shake it off..  OR DIE TRYING.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nGRIMLOCK roared, the sound of again echoing through the jungle. If\nthee were any animals left in the vicintity they wre taking off at a\nhigh rate of speed!\n\n&quot;Me Grimlock listen to nobody but Grimlock!&quot; He growled and roared,\nhis voice deep and powerful. He approached WHEELIE one lumberous step\nat a time, almost as if he were fighting himself.\n\nGRIMLOCK glanced back as he could hear SLAG, SNARL and SLUDGE about to\nburst through the underbrush as well into the clearing. The grasses\nand trees parting to allow their bulk to arrive into the clearing.\n\n&quot;Who is this?&quot; SLUDGE said. &quot;And why Grimlock no smashing him?&quot;\n\nSNARL looked at GRIMLOCK and then SLUDGE, &quot;Me don&#39;t know. Maybe\nGrimlock waiting for us?&quot;\n\nThe massive SLAG just stood there looking at WHEELIE, his optics\nangry. &quot;Me Slag say we smash and ask questions later.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, up and behind GRIMLOCK and the others, from a position\nwhere they could not quite be seen by the rampaging DINOBOTS there was\nSWOOP and TERRANOTRON, in the air hovering as they watched.\n\nWhile it was difficult to see from this distance SWOOP almost looked sad.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
