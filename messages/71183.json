He looks over to Perceptor with an encouraging grin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Heey, no worries Perceptor, if we go eco, we&#39;ll be able to be at full \n&gt; power\n&gt; without actually draining any energy from this planet, therefore, it\n&gt; preserves our environment, and our base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thank you sir.  Now that we have your okay, I&#39;ll start drawing up some\n&gt; sketches and see which one actually fits the landscape.  We want it to be \n&gt; a\n&gt; little bit hidden from view, ya know what&#39;ll happen if it&#39;s visible, \n&gt; right?\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ll get right on it as soon as repairs are all done.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Rodimus and follows him.  Yet it was the first time\n&gt; she ever spent considerable time away from Tucson which to her was a new\n&gt; experience.  For years they had stuck very much together, being brother \n&gt; and\n&gt; sister, but also very close as target masters.  Yet, Rodimus still made a\n&gt; very good impression on her as she gladly trots up beside him.  Being as\n&gt; small as she was, it was rather difficult to keep up with his stride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorry, I promise ta keep up with ya, it&#39;s just hard &#39;cause of my size.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride chuckles a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll forgive ya Straight Shot.  After all, this is something\n&gt; you&#39;re not used to.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m usually travelling on Tucson&#39;s back.  This is \n&gt; a\n&gt; first for me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Even though a little apprehensive due to her feeling of vulnerability, she\n&gt; keeps a content smile on her faceplate.  Straight Shot was among friends,\n&gt; and she knew that sooner or later, she would have to venture further than\n&gt; the holster on Tucson&#39;s back.  Quickstride walks up to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Straight Shot&#39;s not used ta be&#39;n outside her holster for long periods of\n&gt; time.  She might seem a little shy at times, but it&#39;s nothing personal \n&gt; Sir.\n&gt; It appears that she&#39;s much more used to being holstered behind Tucson&#39;s \n&gt; back\n&gt; than she is when she&#39;s in robot mode.  But I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll open up in due\n&gt; time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;LEt&#39;s go to work, Legacy&quot;said dryly the male and looking at Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &quot;By the way, your child is inside the med bay....
