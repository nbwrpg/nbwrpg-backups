We should be ok, if we just plot a path around \nit. A safety precaution worth taking. We&#39;ll be ok.&quot; He says the last \nbit mostly to convince himself of that untruth.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nAzafroth shimmers brightly, as the energy builds up, soon to be \nunleashed on the unsuspecting Autobots. He noticed that some \nother bots were following, and he thinks to himself, &lt;&lt;Those other \nbots will be of use as well. We will bend them to our will as \nwell...&gt;&gt; \n\nHe then sends a thought to the other Ikoto, &quot;Fellow Ikoto. Prepare \nyourselves for the unveiling of the time-warp Maelstorm.&quot; He \nfinishes connecting energy lines and a large spinning maelstorm of \ndarkness appears off in front of the Autobots and the DED. \n\nThe maelstorm is pure darkness, and isn&#39;t visible to optics. It is, \nhowever, visible to scanners. Immediately after the storm is \ncreated, it begins to pull the ships in to it&#39;s center. As the ships \napproach, they will begin to feel the effects of EMP weaponry \n(drained energy, weakness, computer failure), eventhough there are \nno EMP weapons.\n\nBack on the Autobot ship,\n\nPacifix&#39;s eyes widden as he views the scanners with JetV. He \nchecks the veiw port, then the scanners, then the view port, then \nthe scanners again. \n\n&quot;Uhh oh... JetV!&quot; He says in a command like voice, inform the crew \nthat something is happening, have them ready for an evac if neces--\n&quot; Pacifix starts to have trouble finishing his sentence. He feels \nweak but regains his strength, and struggles to go on, &quot;--\nnecessary. Do it quick!&quot; \n\nJetV leaves as fast as he can. He grabs a multi-room comm \ninstrument, and yells into it, &quot;HIDDEN ONE CREW, WE HAVE AN \nEMERGENCY, PREPARE FOR EVAC, MEET ME OUT IN THE \nSTORAGE ROOM.&quot; His weakened arm drops the comm, leaving it \nhanging and he runs to the storage room.\n\nPacifix sits down into his chair, hears JetV&#39;s call but ignores it and \nstarts to try to turn the ship around. &quot;Damn it... somethings funny \nhere...&quot; He watches the scanners&#39; energy level moniters start to top \nthe scale, as they form a flickering image of what looks like a... \nblack hole? He shakes his head, shrugging off an untimely bout of \ndizziness. He gets up, and starts heading back to the rest of the \ncrew. He motions for Grimlock, and anyone else he sees to follow \nhim.\n\nUnknowing, in a blocked off, locked storage container, Crotale \nstarts to feel weak. &lt;&lt;Whoa, what&#39;s happening here&gt;&gt; he \nwonders, &lt;&lt;Are we under attack?&gt;&gt; He starts to bang on his \ncompartement door, trying to get out.\n\nAway from the Autobots, the Ikoto shimmer in approval. Azafroth \ntriumphantly sends a thought to the other Ikoto, &quot;Yes! It is working, \nand soon we will begin the game, begin with additional players.&quot; \nHis shimmering figure goes translucent, and his shimmer gains a \nreddish tint, to match his mood. He and the Ikoto watch in revel as \ntheir creation proceeds to slowly drag two ships from this world into \nthe game death on the planet of pawns, Earth...\n\n"}}
