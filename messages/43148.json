She moved \ncloser to the maximal city.  She was now only a quarter of a mile \nfrom the outside walls.  She wondered how long untill the cannons \nwould come down on her. Little did she know the maximal chip inside \nher totally disguised her predacon signature. So when the automated \nsystems tracked her, they would only see a maximal and not a predacon.\n\n(OK, I&#39;ll need someone in the maximal city who just might be watching \nthe scanners or watching the perimeter to at least pick up the \nmaximal signal and attempt to talk to her. Thank you. )\n\n\n"}}
