She was not instinctively harsh or cruel, but \nher tone showed that she was to be listened to. Owlhawk may be a \nwarrior, but she was more. She was a Wolf Warrior, and she had to \nbreak him from the tactics and habits he was used to make him into \nsomething more.\n\nKatya: Neg. A Clan warrior that is not prepared, mentally or \nphysically is as good as the freebirth scum populating the bandit \ncaste. You must learn to be ready at all times.\n\nShe eased her tone. She had rebuked him, and now was the time to \ninstruct him.\n\nKatya: The Clan rituals have two goals; the first one is honor. The \nforces meeting in a Trial meet in a circle of equals. This way, we \nfight zellbringen, single combat. I admit that necessity may prevent \nus from always achieving single combat, but honor does not diminish \nthis way. The second reason for Trials is that it prevents waste. The \nClans have survived their birthing because they reduced wastes of \nall kind to a minimum. Remember that. Now... What do you do if a \nsuperior gives an order to raze a forest to make more place for a \nmilitary compound?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Sorry I thought they were going to wait until\n&gt; they talked to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:  Owlhawk moved over and stood at attention in\n&gt; front of her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Owlhawk:  I assume to prepare your warrior both\n&gt; mentally and physically for combat.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Katya: What are you doing, you freebirth slag?
