He shot \nout his wings and jetesoned upwards.  He was much larger then the bot do to \nhis dragon mode and was easy to move out of the way of such a small full body \nblast. He stared down the bot. Waiting for him to make the next move. This \nbot must be a new comer. It was not in his databanks of the known bots from \nApoicalypse or any of the dna strains he had collected. He thought of his  \nAbility from his taken DNA. The dna he took from Zadus would come in handy \nnow.  Unfortunatly it could onlt work in best mode. He had yet to try it but \nhe wanted to see how it would take the energy blast. He powered up and a \narmor with a sligt blue color covered his body. He had taken the quality of \nZardus&#39;s impressive armor. Though adapted to Galvatron&#39;s body had the smae \nstength and endurance. With a little power boost. He awaited the bots \napproach.\n\n"}}
