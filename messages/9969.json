She was with the losing team of \nPreds who were fighting with the ones in the ship. What is she doing, \nchanging sides? Well well, there may be some intelegence in that \nlittle snack.  I mean, why would anyone want to stay with the losing \nteam, Hmmmm. I dare say, it is time to make myself known. After all, \nwhy not go with the winning team?&quot;\n\nShe spread her huge, golden wings out and swooped down. She landed in \na tree near the ship and waited to see what would happen.  She eyed \nthe mouse.  She thought, if they don&#39;t accept the mouse, she will \nmake a nice meal.  She just waited and watched.\n\n\n"}}
