I&#39;ve had a\nstruggle for close to a decade now arguing that I had\na right to be called by my middle name (Kyle) instead\nof my first name (Robert) by the other students.  It\nwent something like this:\n\n&quot;My name is Kyle.&quot;\n&quot;No your name is Robert.&quot;\n&quot;My name is Kyle.&quot;\n&quot;No your name is Robert.&quot;\n&quot;My name is Kyle.&quot;\n\nYou get the idea.\n\n--- Legendarynemasis@... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;PRE&gt;If your only claim to fame is that you have a\n&gt; supposed above average \n&gt; intelligence, then that is really sad. using your\n&gt; intelligence as something \n&gt; to brag about is really shallow in itself and if you\n&gt; brag about it offline \n&gt; its no wonder that you ar so unpopular. You should\n&gt; try to lighten up and play \n&gt; with jokes when their made instead of complaining\n&gt; about it. Hey I believe I \n&gt; have an above average intelligence, but then again I\n&gt; have a good social life \n&gt; because I have fun messing around with people and\n&gt; cracking jokes, as well as \n&gt; doing the unexpected.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
