He couldn&#39;t help in the battle, but he could communicate \nwith them.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther flies out of the base, quickly heading for the fairly close \nTrainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBriner and Demise emerge from the base after Starscream flies out, \nand both head off to the Trainer base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator arrives at the Trainer base, seeing the ships fighting \neach other and instead firing two of his very fast and explosive \nshells at the base&#39;s shields.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ignatius sat back laughing, his next move didn&#39;t matter if he was \ntangled up\n&gt; or not. &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.&quot; The computer hummed back to life \nacrivateing\n&gt; a repulsor field around the base forceing the giant scorpion from \nit&#39;s hull\n&gt; and resetting the variable shields. Not more than a second later \nthe room\n&gt; glowed yellow magnetizing the floor and containing the entire room \nwith a\n&gt; Stasis field making ANY movement from the intruders IMPOSSIBLE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lets see here, I just caught Cygnar, Cyanide, Killfest, \nHalucinagen, The\n&gt; Destrocons, Drillbit,\n&gt; \n&gt; I sent Yan a message yesterday with my plans (Thanks for playing \nalong)\n&gt; Making this perfectly legal. Besides if  the Violator can have all \nthat\n&gt; power then I can have a trap.\n\n\n"}}
