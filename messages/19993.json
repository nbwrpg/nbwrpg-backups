He curls \nup into a fetal position until he hit the ground. Now both bots had a \ncritical wound that needed tending as soon as possible. If he took \nanother solid shot like that he might not make it back for repairs. \n(He was to busy fighting Slayer to notice how badly the Ark was \ndamaged.) But the same went for Slayer, if he didn&#39;t get back to \nwherever his base was he&#39;d gointo stasis lock too. The fight was \nmeaningless right now, if it continued both would cease to function. \nLunarpine transformed to full wolf mode to save energy and speed up \nrepairs. He took a defensive stance in front of Slayer and started a \nstareing contest. &quot;This is turning senseless. If we both stay out \nhere we&#39;re both dead if we go our seperate ways we might live to pick \nthis up another day.&quot; He stepped back a few steps ready to move at a \nmoments notice. &quot;We&#39;re to evenly matched, I see that now, how about a \nrain check till we meet again?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Skayer growls as Lunarpine&#39;s claws take out his shoulder cannons, \n&gt; sending both bots flying back from the impact.

Slayer seemed to know this. \nPride \n&gt; &gt; seemed to be the only reason this fight continued. Lunarpine \n&gt; refused \n&gt; &gt; to lose. He wasn&#39;t losing fluid nearly as fast as Slayer so he \nknew \n&gt; &gt; that he could outlast the bot even if it caust Lunarpine his own \n&gt; &gt; life. He wanted to save Shadow Wing but not if it cost the rest \nof \n&gt; &gt; the maximals thier lives by giving the traitor the chance to \nlive. \n&gt; If \n&gt; &gt; he left Slayer&#39;s weapons alone Slayer would continue fighting and \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine would have the opportunity to finish him. He had a \nbetter \n&gt; &gt; idea though. he leapt forward again slashing both claws at \nSlayers \n&gt; &gt; shoulder cannons and biting for his neck. If he got a hold on him \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; close range this battle would be as good as over with Lunarpine \nthe \n&gt; &gt; victor.\n\n\n"}}
