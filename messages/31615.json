The acid\npellets came towards FireBlade.\n&quot;Your attakcs are weaker and weaker&quot; he yelled as he slapped at the\nfour pellts easily with his sword. AS they hit they exploded and began\nto eat at the outer layers of the finely crafted blade. As he saw this\nhe went ballistic.\n&quot;MY SWORD!!&quot; he screamed at Prowl. He forgot about the peasly others\nshooting at him and focused on Prowl. He had never been this angry\nbefore in his life.  His sword still useful had lost it&#39;s gleam and\nedge he was so proud of.  He started running at Prowl once again and\nfired 20 shots of his PowerSurge at Prowl plus even tho he as to high\nto be effected three of his specialied fire grenades that would\nexplods shooting  liquid fire in a 15 m radius.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl spins in the air and pulls up, several shots hitting him and\n&gt; denting and cracking his armor. He feels a few rapid-fire shots hit\n&gt; him, but his focus right now was Fireblade, although he wasn&#39;t going\n&gt; to swoop down again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Taking out his old acid pellet gun, he fires four pellets down at the\n&gt; Decepticon. He hoped that Fireblade would try to deflect them with his\n&gt; sword, as they would release the acid on contact, and would eat\n&gt; through alot of metal if neccessary.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::FireBlade::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FireBlade smiles as the missiles fall to the ground....And an even\n&gt; &gt; larger grin comes over him as Prowl flies towards him. He deflects\n&gt; &gt; three of the laser blasts with his Blade but on knicks his other\n&gt; arm.\n&gt; &gt; He growls and fires 10 more PowerSurge shots from his rifle at the\n&gt; &gt; incoming Prowl still continuing to run for the base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He was now within 100 m of it.\n\n\n"}}
