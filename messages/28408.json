He looked to his master \nand lord, Unicron.  &quot;Orders, Chaos-Bringer?&quot;\n\nThe age-old being looked to all his fellow Brotherhood members and gave a \nslight smile.  &quot;Now, we crush these heathens who dare invade our territory.  \nThey dare attack our base and besmearch us by doing so.  And by doing so, \nthey attack me.  No one attacks me.  Kill all the heathens, take no \nprisoners, use any means necessary!&quot; he yelled.\n\nVehement raised both arms, each arms launching two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles.  Two of those missiles headed for Darkfate.  The other two of the \nsame type headed for Dragonfly.\n\n---\n\nUnicron raised both arms, an orb of black energy forming in his left hand and \ndropping downward towards Attilla, the orb having the power of a few charges.\n\nRaising his right arm he launched two energy-signature seeking missiles at \nOcipite.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher raised an arm, launching a seeking missile at one of the bat \nprobes, firing five optic blasts at another.  In his left hand a missile \nlauncher from subspace appeared.  The Brotherhood warrior moved that arm to \nthe right, pulling the large trigger of the weapon twice, a missile heading \nfor Shivah and another missile heading for Kali.\n\n---\n\nReflector smiled and waited until after his allies had fired and raised a \ndouble-barreled cannon attached to his right wrist, firing off a missile from \neach of the barrels.  One energy-signature seeking missile headed for Alecto. \n The other of the same type began a pursuit of a bat probe.\n\n---\n\nUnicron activated a commlink with Darkfate and made a guttural noise that a \nrobot could not make. \n\n &quot;Leave my territory or you shall die, your head resting on a pike as a \nreminder of what happens when you invade the Brotherhood&#39;s land and try and \ndestroy their property!&quot;\n\n"}}
