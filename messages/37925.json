He had seen something that scared him more than anything for\nquite a while, and was not sticking around to find out what that thing\nwas. Over the horrizon however, three other jets broke loose throught\nthe clouds. Apeface swerved to aboid hitting Slugslinger, and\ntransformed, completing his backflip, and landing on a spire in his Ape\nmode, clutching it with all hands. &quot;Excellent Slugslinger. Ready to go?&quot;\nHe asked, making it sound like more of an order. Sluglsinger double back\nand swooped by Apeface, &quot;Yeah, I found Quake, but...&quot; he was cut off.\n&quot;Quake, he would want to come. I&#39;ll go and pick him up, the rest of you\nget to base.&quot; Apeface ordered. Fine thought SLugslinger, as he continued\nhis flight. Apeface let go off the spire, and plummetted downard,\ntransforming back into Jet mode, and roaring towards the bar, using a\nradar to detect his old pal Quake.\n\n"}}
