Mutual benefit.&quot;\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD - SKY SHADOW&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKYSHADO=\r\nW stepped back as DINOBOT skewered WASPINATOR and he fell to\n&gt; &gt; the floor.=\r\n &quot;So messy.&quot; He said with distaste. &quot;What did that Maximal\n&gt; &gt; want?&quot; He gr=\r\nunted, &quot;It might have been useful to wait to see that\n&gt; &gt; before you choppe=\r\nd him down.&quot; Evidently it was not the temporary\n&gt; &gt; demise of WASPINATOR th=\r\nat SKYSHADOW found distasteful, but the waste\n&gt; &gt; of a possibly valuable in=\r\nformation source.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; FRACTYL walked along in silence, not at all sure=\r\n if he wanted to be in\n&gt; &gt; this conversation. Instead he just idly kept exa=\r\nmining the device that\n&gt; &gt; had been retrieved when DARK RODIMUS had escaped=\r\n their clutches. He\n&gt; &gt; held it balanced in his exceedingly nimble hands hi=\r\ns optics watching\n&gt; &gt; it as scanners on his palm went over it very carefull=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The meeting room was just ahead, the door was sitting open wait=\r\ning for\n&gt; &gt; HYDRAS to enter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile a few levels below, in the =\r\nmedlab, the recharging and repair\n&gt; &gt; chamber that housed VICE GRIP was slo=\r\nwly counting down until finally\n&gt; &gt; it beeped. He was ready to emerge and r=\r\neport for duty.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The door clicked and then rumbled and then slid op=\r\nen to release should\n&gt; &gt; he choose to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT AND VICE =\r\nGRIP&gt;\n\nDINOBOT merely nodded, &quot;Of course.  But the probabilities of eitehr =\r\nthem being glitched enough to directly contact Waspinator without ascertain=\r\ning his location, or the fact he was surrounded by us speaks either of a tr=\r\nap or a lack of thought in any notion related to an idea of what they wante=\r\nd.  As well as the fact the longer the communications channel laid open the=\r\ny would attempt to hack our signals, or otherwise listen about the base whi=\r\nle our encryptions were compromised.&quot;\n\nGoing on, &quot;I have given the Maximals=\r\n credit, oftentimes they are quite creative in utilizing this in playing up=\r\n such acts of wanton stupidity as greater guile.  However, one must also re=\r\nalize that on occasion the crass stupidity wins.  WHomever was contacting u=\r\ns on an open channel would be somewehre public, I would assume given the ot=\r\nher vocalizers we heard in the background, and I would wager an officer pre=\r\nsent would have put in a blocking to prevent us from listening in along the=\r\n channel.  Or attempted to put some sort of hacking algorihm to breach our =\r\ncommunications encryption.  Regardless, the chances of us gathering useful =\r\ninformation from them are outweighed by either them having no plan at all o=\r\nr it turning into an attempt to access our communications files.  So I acte=\r\nd preemptively.&quot;\n\nDragging the Waspinator parts along, as VICE GRIP popped =\r\nout of the CR Chamber, then dumping the majority of the parts into it, DINO=\r\nBOT dusted off his talons.\n\nVICE GRIP rose out from it and bowed low, final=\r\nly glancing over, &quot;What is our tactical situation and our current assignmen=\r\nts?&quot;  Towing the line now as he fell in behind the others and glancing to H=\r\nYDRAS.\n\n&lt;OLD - HYDRAS&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &quot;I will deal personally with this trouble!!&quot;Hiss=\r\ned annoyed the male whilehe opened his comlink in a maximal frecuency and w=\r\naitted for answer\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a glancing of confusion from VICE GRIP =\r\nover at HYDRAS&#39; actions, but he stayed silent otherwise, as did DINOBOT as =\r\nDINOBOT was more focused on watching CRYOTEK and SKY SHADOW.\n\n\n"}}
