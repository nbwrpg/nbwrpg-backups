If anything else he was there for support. He had hoped by doing s=\r\no, Rodimus&#39;s condition may change gradually. Yet he had time to respond to =\r\nPerceptor and Kup as they were leaving.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Do what you can to help Night=\r\nlight. I&#39;ll stay with Rodimus to be sure he remains stable.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In his lar=\r\nger body frame, it was a bit hard for him to make himself comfortable yet, =\r\nto him comfort was the last thing on his mind. He knew he needed Rodimus no=\r\nt only as a comrade, but as a friend. It was the one thing that Hydras didn=\r\n&#39;t have and a power he&#39;d never experience. The power of friendship.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; H=\r\nopefully you can hear me Rodimus. I promise you as an Autobot and a Prime, =\r\nthat I will NEVER give up fighting unitl the day comes when the wars finall=\r\ny cease. After the wars, restoration is in order. But if we&#39;re going to ach=\r\nieve these goals, the leaders of the Autobots and the Maximals must come to=\r\ngether as a whole and only then can we restore order on this planet. There&#39;=\r\ns just one problem, you&#39;ve slipped away on us, unintentionally of course, b=\r\nut without you we&#39;re not as powerful as we can be. But with you we can give=\r\n this planet what it desperately needs, new hope and the promise of new lif=\r\ne. Never give up your drive to restore order, for it&#39;s a drive that we all =\r\nshare and treasure and a drive that no evil force can ever bring down.&quot;\n\n&lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon entered the chamber where Rodimus Prime is laying he can\nals=\r\no see the familliar form of  Lagacy as he stood to the side of\nRodimus as h=\r\ne looked over several of the sensors that were oriented on\nRodimus&#39; prone f=\r\norm lying on the bed.\n\nHowever also in the room was Bump who while smaller =\r\nthan Legacy  but\nhe looked no less formidable in his durably contructed cri=\r\nmson colored\narmor and silver-grey chest plate plating. His beast mode was\n=\r\nprobrably some sort of reptile, an armadillo perhaps judging from\nhints aro=\r\nund his form. He glanced up as Tuscon entered a scalpel in\nhis hand as it h=\r\nummed with power.\n\nAlso was the rather large form of Santon the Maximal Doc=\r\ntor. He stood\nas tall as the Massive Legacy, his armor was thick and heavy =\r\nand was\ncolored primarilly in various shades of greys although his chest\nth=\r\nights and biceps were red. As with many Maximals it was easy to\ndetermine h=\r\nis beast mode was that of an elephant from the large tusks\nthat extended fr=\r\nom his helm.\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; He sits up trying to get in a comfortable position=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Then there&#39;s this little matter of Hydras.. Unfortunately he remind=\r\ns me of good old Megatron and Galvitron... If we&#39;re going to overthrow him,=\r\n we have to work together. That won&#39;t be easy, but I know we can do it. If =\r\nanyone should be wanting to thwart him, it&#39;s you. He did the most injustice=\r\n to you, and by right, you have presidence as to how his fate should ultima=\r\ntely wind up. Then, Cyclonus. I&#39;ll deal with him. Little by little we shoul=\r\nd free this planet. And little by little we can watch it flourish.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n\nSanton looked up, it was obvious that he was not happy with yet\nanother =\r\nintrusion on what could turn out to be an incredibly delicate\noperation. &quot;T=\r\nuscon Prime.&quot; Santon said, his voice carrying the full\nweight of acting chi=\r\nef medical officer, &quot;I will have to ask you and\nany others who wish to watc=\r\nh to wait in the observation room.&quot; Santon\npointed to the room easily visab=\r\nle on the other side of clear\nplexiglass. He looked back at Rodimus as he h=\r\neard a beep from one of\nthe sensors.\n\nLegacy spoke up from his position, &quot;I=\r\nt would appear that his life\nsigns are begining to decline, if we are to be=\r\ngin, now would be the\nbest time.&quot;\n\nBump glanced looked at the others in the=\r\n area his look obvious, leave\nso that they could begin.\n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
