His repair \nsystems started working, but he was losing alot of fuel.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon worried about the disappearance of Slayer, finally the scans \n&gt; got a lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon, I have a positive lock on Slayers position. he&#39;s buried in \n&gt; the mountains not to far from where his last report was.&quot; Blaze \n&gt; called out from his station.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Send Ignatius to retrieve him immediately.&quot; Prebon responded \n&gt; irritably slamming his hand on the wall. A tiny drop of mech fluid \n&gt; dripped from his hand. he caught it and squeezed it as if it were \none \n&gt; of his enemies. &quot;We need Slayers knowledge of the Maximals if we \nare \n&gt; to defeat them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A bald Eagle flew low to avoid Maximal scanners. He was close to \nthe \n&gt; ark and knew they wouldn&#39;t be happy to see him. he swooped low and \n&gt; located the nearly frozen Slayer in stasis lock. Slayer was missing \na \n&gt; limb as well as most of his mech fluid. Ignatius quickly \ntransformed \n&gt; and put his arms around Slayer. he lifted the injured bots head and \n&gt; checked it&#39;s status. The rescuer transformed and once again an \neagle \n&gt; floated above the ground. the great bird grabbed its prey and \nstarted \n&gt; flying back to the Trainers secret hideout.\n\n\n"}}
