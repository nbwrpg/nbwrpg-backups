Without a word \nTavatron took Dinobot&#39;s hand in her own and with much effort pulled herself \nto her feet. She sheathed her sword and leaned against Dinobot, barely able \nto stand as it is, much less on her own.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sun, 16 Apr 2000 21:14:36 PDT\n&gt;\n&gt;* Dinobot roared as he felt cold steel rip into his face and was blinded by\n&gt;the gush of mech fluid that erupted from the wound at the moment of impact.\n&gt;He let go of Tavatron and stepped back, he snarled and tried to wipe the\n&gt;mech fluid from his optic so that he could see but every time he did more\n&gt;replaced it.\n&gt;Dinobot roared in frustration as he dropped down to one knee and hung his\n&gt;head, he could hear his own mech fluid hitting the ground in wet splashes.\n&gt;He leaned against a near tree trunk and tried to use it to stand back up \n&gt;but\n&gt;his hand slipped in his mech fluid that had splashed on it and he ended up\n&gt;back on his knee, he&#39;s snarl softened until there was nothing but silence.\n&gt;He stayed there, not moving and not making a sound, just existing.\n&gt;A long and silent time had passed before Dinobot got to his feet and wiped\n&gt;the congealing mech fluid from his optic, we walked over to Tavatron and\n&gt;held out a hand to help her to her feet.\n&gt;Not a word came from his lips.*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
