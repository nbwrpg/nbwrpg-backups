He =\r\nsmiles.\n\n&quot; I can see how you got your name.  Highly perceptive of you.  Tha=\r\nnk you Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my questions.  Now tha=\r\nt I know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it.  First things first, Perce=\r\nptor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could do that I=\r\n&#39;d greatly appreciate it, Stanton.  Next, we have insectoids hiding beneath=\r\n the Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson about tamperin=\r\ng with what is not theirs.  And Hydras last of all, could use a lesson in t=\r\nhat as well.  Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away with it.  Espec=\r\nially when they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n\nHe turns his head toward Rodimus.\n\n&quot;=\r\n They caused great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your help,=\r\n that they get it back in return.  If Optimus Prime could fend off Megatron=\r\n, I&#39;m sure I can follow in his footsteps, and fend off the enemy at hand.  =\r\nBoth Hydras and Cylconus need to be dealt with accordingly.  Rodimus voiced=\r\n an interest in dealing with Hydras and so do I.  Two Primes against an evi=\r\nl leader is sure to topple even the most evil of warlords.  But our war doe=\r\ns not end with just us.  If we&#39;re going to send those Decepticons and Predi=\r\ncons packing, we&#39;ll need every Autobot and Maximal we have in our ranks to =\r\npull this off.  Lord Elder, I&#39;d like you to contact Lord Perseus, and assem=\r\nble a Maximal/ Autobot assembly.  The more we get together, the stronger we=\r\n&#39;ll be.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I know who it sounds like. We only knew Opti=\r\nmus for a short time, but I can&#39;t mistake his voice and you most certainly =\r\nsound like him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson shows modesty in his expression.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nMaybe it&#39;s just a cooincedence.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap looks to him intently.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, You know a lot about everyone, don&#39;t ya think Wheels sounds=\r\n a lot like Optimus? And by chance, could he actually be related to him?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned and looked at Tuscon, his single optic pulsing=\r\n for a\n&gt; moment, &quot;You come from the same construction line as the Autobot\n&gt;=\r\n leader known as Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy paused for a =\r\nmoment as if accessing some internal memories,\n&gt; &quot;You spark matrix accordin=\r\ng to the last scan record bears a striking\n&gt; similarity to Optimus Prime, U=\r\nltra Magnus, Convoy as well as Big\n&gt; Convoy. However here are those who pos=\r\ntulate that Spark Matriixes are\n&gt; attenuated by the actions one takes and t=\r\nhe desisions arrived at as\n&gt; much as by default construction specifications=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon shrugged, &quot;What he really means Tuscon is that you are built=\r\n\n&gt; along the same lines as him, and your spark is similar, but he&#39;s not\n&gt; s=\r\nure if that is because that is how you&#39;re constructed or because your\n&gt; act=\r\nions have made it that way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy glanced at Santon, &quot;I believe I ha=\r\nd already said that.&quot; he\n&gt; intoned coolly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, well sometimes your =\r\nwords are longer than a class 5 star\n&gt; crusier.&quot; Santon retorted smoothly.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy just turned back to Tuscon, pointedly ignoring Santon.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TA=\r\nG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
