You&#39;ll break your \nhand on the computer screen, though. The truth is, my Chivtrons would \nbe outnumbered and picked off one by one. Fact is, Sarge has no \nfighting skills, Zeni has no fighting skills, Perplex has no fighting \nskills, and that leaves Arrow and Burning Hammer. Burning Hammer is \ntotally confused, and Arrow is too protective of his kid. The battle \nbetween my characters to the death would no doubt, if I played \nfairly, leave at least one dead of my Chosen mafia or Maximals, but \nall of my Chivtrons would fall.

Just because your chars hate each \nother \n&gt;   doesnt mean you have to kill the chars of one faction off. Thats \njust \n&gt;   plain dumb its like saying &quot;Oh, I like this faction so all these \nguys \n&gt;   have to die now because I cant handle them attacking each other.&quot; \n&gt;   Look at Yan, he has the alliance against the Maximals, he doesnt \ngo \n&gt;   around killing his alliance chars and maximal chars simply \nbecause \n&gt;   they cant or wont coexist. ou should try to do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; OOC: Okay, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s the truth. My characters could \nnot \n&gt;   co-exist in the same faction like that, ad then what? Make them \nact \n&gt;   unrealistic? To keep them in character of course the Mafia would \n&gt;   attack the Chivtrons, and then  who would I have die? As much as \nI \n&gt;   like them, my Chivtrons would end up dying. It&#39;s not a threat, \n&gt;   honest, I&#39;m just pointing out what would really happen.

Now, for the (hopefully) final \n&gt;   commant on this:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   First of all: Soulstice, that was just plain cheap. Its \nthreats \n&gt;   like those that make people not want people&#39;s chars in their \n&gt;   faction. &quot;If you do this, I&#39;ll kill off my chars on your side&quot; is \n&gt;   exactly what makes faction commanders begin to rely on your chars \n&gt;   less and less, resulting in them being ignored.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Second of all: as Gunthers said, quit trying to predict what \nthe \n&gt;   Alliance is gonna do.
