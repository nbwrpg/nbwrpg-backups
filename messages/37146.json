Okay, get ready.  Okay, I say okay a lot.  Okay?  Okay!  Okay, here goes.  Okay, I said thay already, so I&#39;ll just say it all now.  Damn, I&#39;m serious, I cant stop saying okay!  DAMN!  *slaps self silly for 45 minutes straight!*  Whew, oka--THERE I GO AGAIN!   *holds breath for 20 minutes.....nearly dies*  No more okays!  Okay?  Doh!\n&gt; \n&gt;   See, Skulletron had a special mental ability, he had the ability to connect his mind with others&#39; minds, and see what they are thinking, without them knowing.  They wouldn&#39;t know that he connected with their minds unless he told them, or they figured out some other way like that.  And, here&#39;s the part that his ability is all about, or that he has mostly used it for.  Some of his victims have been Zardus(by request), and two other characters named Ga-I forget, and BrightBlade.  And also, Skulletron used it,(sorry I did that without notice guys, who remember that!) to sort of gain access to everything, codes, cameras, on the CF.  And now, I&#39;m gonna use it again, on Motormaster!  Muahaha!  Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not THAT devastating...Unless I made Skulle-er-Slaughter, make Motormaster commit suicide(or convince him.)  See, he can display images and sounds to try and change one&#39;s emotions and feelings about something or somebody.  He made two people fall in love by displaying images of hearts around one person, and stuff.  And, when Zardus asked him to, Skulletron eventually made Zardus give off a little giggle, by displaying (corny) humorous things.  Now, in my next post, tell what Motormaster feels.....\n\n\n"}}
