However he is not\ndisplaying typical bird-like behavior. So I suppose if your base\nscanners has advance behavior analysis capabilities they may note\nsomething strange, or someone could just get curious at the eagle\nflying in search patturns. In either case if someone can get a close\nenough look (IE: With binoculars) you would see that he is an eagle\nwith a cool boosterpack and small rocket launchers. He still has a\nslight distortion field wich shows him to be a typical avian to\nscanners/sensors.\n\nNote: Hot-rod in the TF:Movie had bionoculars, so I would suspect\nRodimus has them as well. I am not sure who would have them in your\ngroup. \n\nI hope this helps\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
