He realizes this will be the first time he\n&gt; takes actual flight.  With a sigh he shows a determined look as he prepares\n&gt; to step off the cliff with fully extended wings.  He had no idea what to do,\n&gt; since he was for most of his life, on wheels instead of wings.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, bare with me, this is my first flight.  Hold on!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He bites the bullet and begins with a strong beat of his wings, as he lifts\n&gt; his body off the ground.  By instinct he curls up his front and hind legs as\n&gt; he gets higher in the air.  The higher he gets the more draft he experiences\n&gt; until he is able to soar on outstretched wings without beating them.  He\n&gt; holds his long neck out straight and uses his long tail as a rudder which\n&gt; keeps him perfectly balanced in the air.  He finds himself speeding past his\n&gt; comrades which surprises him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime wasn&#39;t joking, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m capable of traveling this\n&gt; fast.  All right, I&#39;m gathering intel from the ground, and I believe we&#39;re\n&gt; on the right flight path.  Now let&#39;s give our query something that will\n&gt; cause them to turn their head.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he had done at the cave, Tucson releases a strong throated roar which\n&gt; could very well be heard by enemy forces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Back at the Ark, Rattrap and Quickstride hears the roar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; What the pit was that!?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap yelps as his comrade grins.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That? Oh, Tucson got a major upgrade.  Nice voice he&#39;s got huh?  Oh if ya\n&gt; see a big silver dragon, that&#39;s him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap looks up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow so he traded his wheels for wings.. Aww maan now he needs a new\n&gt; handle!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - RODIMUS, LEO, WING CALIBER&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON flew through the air, his giant wings beating the air\nRODIMUS was trying to hang on for dear life! Being a land bound mech\nhe very rarely got a chance to be in the air, except for the\noccasional shuttle ride. At the same time though RODIMUS couldn&#39;t\nescape a feeling of exhilaration as the wind tore at him and the giant\ndragon that was now TUSCON moved and turned.\n\n&quot;So where are we headed?&quot; RODIMUS said over comlink as he didn&#39;t think\nhis voice would carry well over the sound of the wind whipping past\nthem. &quot;From the reports, the dinosaurs were several hundred miles in\nthat direction.&quot; RODIMUS was Pointing in a generally eastward\ndirection.\n\nAll around them, as far as the optic could scan there were trees and\nrolling grasses. To the south a desert stretch was forming but it was\nsome distance away. It would take centuries for it to reach the area\nthey were located. There was a string of mountains that ran generally\nnorth to south with a stong branch running off to the west, places\nthat would one day be called the Cascade range and the Blue Mountains.\n\nThe skies were beginning to darken as well. Night was beginning to set\nin, the first stars were already making their appearance in the dusky\nskies.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
