She was \nstaring at the wall, her back to door. She was thinking about why she \neven opened her mouth in the first place. RULE 1, NEVER TELL ANYONE \nANYTHING, so why did she?  RULE 2, THOSE WHO KNOW ANYTHING, YOU KILL, \nso why hasn&#39;t she? She had thse questions running through her mind.  \nShe also was trying to figure out what programs where her&#39;s and which \nones were those of the council&#39;s.  She sipped her drink absent \nmindedly as she pondered her situation.  She wondered that if they \never found out that she had the plans to the whole cybertron council \nnetwork.  Including the plans for an energy extractor that could pull \nenergy from the planet core and make enough energon cubes to run \nCybertron for the next 12 eons.  She sighed and told herself over and \nover again, shut up, clam up and don&#39;t say another word to anyone or \nyour slagged and they will get the info.\n\n\n"}}
