Noiselessly, \nthey made their way through brambles and small trees. The little fuzz-nut \nbumbling along beside, above and behind them, bumping into things and making \na rukus. Just as Shadow Cat was going to grab him down and carry him the \nrest of the way, just so he wouldn&#39;t make anymore noise, the little &#39;un \nstopped and hovered in mid air, cocking his head left and right, listening \nto something they couldn&#39;t hear.\nHe flew in a little circle and floated up a little making a a small, cute,*\n\n&quot;Mew!&quot;\n\n* He shot off into the trees, making a small humming sound as he went, like \na bee, as his engines worked extra hard to make the small bot go faster on \nsmall wings. he was soon lost in the gloom of the trees, leaving Shadow Cat \nand Snow Tech stunned. They soon recovered, Running after him as fast as \npossible.*\n\n&quot; That little craper better not lead us on another goose chase or i&#39;ll \nde-wing the little bugger!&quot; Snow Tech growled to Shadow Cat*\n\n&quot; No you wont, i wont let you, he&#39;s cutter than you and your just jelouse \nthats all! Now hurry or we wont catch him!&quot;\n\n* The sprinted faster, trying to catch-up to the small object ahead of them*\n\n* The little tyke was going as fast as he could, dodgeing trees and \nboulders, stumps and branches, going where the sound of a new voice was \nheard. little bits of sun-light glared through the trees, momentarily \nblinding his sensative eyes, making him un-able to see Iron Raptor making \nher way back to base.8\n* He slammed into her armour, spinning him into a tree and onto her \nshoulder. he shook his head and looked up at her*\n\n&quot; Mew?&quot;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor was glad that at least Prow had gotten the main thing from\n&gt;that slap, but she only growled when she head him chuckle. The sound \n&gt;muffled\n&gt;from the cape over her head.\n&gt;Her shaking had stopped, her spark still pounded but not nearly as bad as \n&gt;it\n&gt;had. Calm taking over...and being replaced by annoyance.\n&gt;She hated heights the Prowl knew that, yet he still dropped like a rock \n&gt;from\n&gt;the sky and scared her out of her wits...AGAIN!\n&gt;\n&gt;Iron Raptor simply sighs deeply, lifting the cape from her eyes and head,\n&gt;throwing it back so that it would settle against the ground, then looking \n&gt;at\n&gt;the trunks of the trees a bit as Prowl kneels down and\n&gt;sends his thoughts to her.\n&gt;Her blue eyes turning to him in a glare.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; Well, next time when you decide to test them I&#39;M NOT WITH YOU!!!&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* She breaths another sigh  but keeps the glare, eventually getting to her\n&gt;feet and dusting herself off.\n&gt;Then noticing Prowls puppy eyes, only mannaging to get another glare from\n&gt;her.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; That&#39;s never worked on me...and NO!&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor leaned her weight on one leg as she continued to glare at\n&gt;Prowl, a look that a mother would give her son when she found out he was\n&gt;throwing things around in the house, breaking something that was of value \n&gt;to\n&gt;her.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; You know very well my fear of hights, but you STILL pulled that stunt! If\n&gt;you ever, EVER do something like that to me again I&#39;ll do way more then \n&gt;just\n&gt;slap you!&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* She then looked towards the forest.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; I&#39;ve also decided that I&#39;m walking back.I can&#39;t trust you anymore.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor didn&#39;t really want to hurt Prowls feeings or anything like\n&gt;that, but he had to get it through his head that he couldn&#39;t just joke \n&gt;about\n&gt;anymore.\n&gt;This was a war that they were fighting, and good humour was welcome, but \n&gt;not\n&gt;antics and showing off. If Prowl wanted to test his metal, he would have to\n&gt;do it on his own time.\n&gt;Iron Raptor thought this too, so he would get the picture.\n&gt;Turning towards the direction where the signatures of the ship was coming\n&gt;from, noticing three instead of just two. There must have been a stow-away,\n&gt;or even maybe a new Maximal for her to meet.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt; Now, we have to get to the ship, or what&#39;s left of it.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor then began to move into the forest, her cape, surprisingly,\n&gt;catching on nothing.\n&gt;Moving easily into the shadows, her armor soaking them up, or seeming to.\n&gt;But when she happened to pass under a ray of light which filtered in \n&gt;through\n&gt;the branches her air seemed to sparkle, her mind too focused on seeing her\n&gt;freinds again and making sure they were alright to notice.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get more from the Web.
