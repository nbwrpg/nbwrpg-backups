She felt the pain tear into her \nand it made her shake.  She looked and saw Striker down on the ground \nand not moving.  She looked up at Prebon.  Her eyes filled with water \nand her face with a pained expression. She could barely \nspeak, &quot;master Prebon, help him. please help him.&quot; She then closed \nher eyes and felt the tears roll down her face.  She looked back up \nat Prebon. &quot;master, help me...it hurts.&quot; She then closed her eyes and \nwinced as the pain sent shock waves through her body.  She finally \npassed out, laying in a pool of her own mech fluid. \n\n\n"}}
