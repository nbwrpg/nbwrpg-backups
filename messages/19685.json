Foxfingers plan had worked, unfortunately he was out of \n&gt; chips. He held still as he could hoping the autoguns would think he \n&gt; was destroyed. He knew Darkmouse knew he was alive so it wouldn&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; long till she corrected them. He had two options, either escape or \n&gt; find a place on the ship that didn&#39;t have autoguns. If he left the \n&gt; outside guns would reduce him to slag. He scanned the ship and \nfound \n&gt; an area of the ship without guns. He stayed close to the wall \n&gt; sneaking under a few cameras. He slowly worked his way to the safe \n&gt; spot.
