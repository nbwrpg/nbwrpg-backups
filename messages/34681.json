He feels his mind being\n&gt; overwhelmed by all the stuff that IR was experiencing, and flies\n&gt; backwards, resisting the urge to grip his head. Through half-closed\n&gt; optics, Prowl sees the emergy go at Megatron, and his systems begin \nto\n&gt; deal with the rush from IR.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks down at his mate to see her as Arkness Prime, feeling pride\n&gt; but also a bit sorry that she was now so much stronger than him. But\n&gt; it didn&#39;t matter. She was the maximal commander, and she deserved to\n&gt; be good.

Her scanners homed in on a\n&gt; streak of \n&gt; &gt; pink heading towards her, her mind numb at what was going on.\n&gt; &gt; But nothing was controling her body this time, instead she felt a\n&gt; power \n&gt; &gt; pulsating from the very core of her spark.\n&gt; &gt; The Matrix had come to life!\n&gt; &gt; Power serged inside of her super structure, so much that it almost\n&gt; hurt.  \n&gt; &gt; Her hands shook, then the rest of her body followed and she nearly\n&gt; dropped \n&gt; &gt; her sword.\n&gt; &gt; And in one burst, silver flashed wings erupted from her back and\n&gt; stratched \n&gt; &gt; out behind her.\n&gt; &gt; The last of the dieing sun caught a glint off of them as a red \nlight\n&gt; began \n&gt; &gt; to pulse at the flat of her chest.

But just before reaching\n&gt; him they \n&gt; &gt; shot into the air in straight bars of pure energy by the Matrix&#39;s\n&gt; will. \n&gt; &gt; Around Megatron them sprouted, growing and reaching for the\n&gt; sky...the gap at \n&gt; &gt; the brink...beginning to shrink and close.*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
