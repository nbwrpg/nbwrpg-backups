If an RPG died because of it =\r\nwould be \n  because no one wanted to go Cybertron (obvious there) or becaus=\r\ne it wasn&#39;t \n  done right.  Cybertron isn&#39;t really explored that much in th=\r\ne American \n  Transformers cartoon, which is the only one I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d a=\r\ngree with LN, \n  don&#39;t base it on Beast Machines.  Yuk.  \n\n  Also, on Cyber=\r\ntron, we could do more stuff.  In example, the first two \n  seasons of TFs,=\r\n undoubtedly the best but I guess you could say &#39;restricted&#39; \n  to Earth an=\r\nd occassional visits to Earth.  Season three, undoubtedly not the \n  best, =\r\ndid have many episodes OFF of Cybertron and Earth.  Going to different \n  p=\r\nlanets, etc.  A good concept there, even if most art and writing was...shal=\r\nl \n  we say lacking?  Again, season three wasn&#39;t the best but it had a LOT =\r\nof \n  opportunities that this RPG would have as well.  Not to mention we&#39;d =\r\nget to \n  make our own Cybertron and, well, yeah, I went over that.\n\n  The =\r\nbiggest problem is we&#39;d have to make our own Cybertron.  I mean, we know \n =\r\n what Earth looks like, all the places, the geography.  Buuuut, we don&#39;t kn=\r\now \n  that for Cybertron and we&#39;d need to create it.\n\n  As for the protohum=\r\nans, early in the RPG people were equipping huge gumby \n  squads of protohu=\r\nmans with weapons and using them as massively destructive \n  armies so they=\r\n were banned, as they should be.  The RPG&#39;s got along fine with \n  gumbies =\r\nthat can&#39;t fight.\n\n\n  -L. Unitron   \n\n   \n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
