She transformed into bot mode and pulled the cover off the \ndrain.  She then drew her quazar pistol and glared at them. &quot;OK guys, \nI&#39;ll give you a little credit. First you were nice enough to drag me \nfrom my burning ship. Thank you.  Then you offer to  fix me up. That \nwas sweet. but now you want to kill me. I can&#39;t blame you.  After I \nkilled the maximal leader Quantis at his home back on Cybertron, they \nwanted me dead too.  And I would have gotten away with it. but my \npredacon council leader decided to make a deal and turned me in. So, \nI guess I&#39;m just a wanted bot.&quot;  she sighed a very bored sigh.&quot;Now \ngentle bots, if you will pardon me. I must take my leave. Unless you \ncan think of one good reason for me to stay?&quot;  She smiled.  She knew \nthat if she could peak thier interest, she may have use for the one \nthat saved her.  She really liked him.  Her fangs itched, which \nusually was her instincts telling her something. She transformed into \nrattle snake and curled up around the drain. &quot;Well?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Jetstorm/Sharpedge/Gigatron/The \nSkyscorchers/Treadshot/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Jetstorm and Sharpedge see the retreat::\n&gt; Jetstorm: Jetstorm, AFTERBURN!\n&gt; ::he transforms into jet mode, Sharpedge climbs in, and they fly \ninto he \n&gt; forest after the others::\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------------\n&gt; ::Gigatron and the Skyscorchers get ready to land::\n&gt; Gigatron: I got quarters at the CF.
