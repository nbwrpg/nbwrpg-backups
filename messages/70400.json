He quickly called up a few displays as\nthe valley mine appeared on the screen. It was the city as shown from\na distance, obviously some sort of long range snap shot of it. The\npitucture showed the drab colored buildings, the haze of pollution\nthat seemed to settle over the city like some sort of sickening brown\nand black fog.\n\n&quot;I am not picking up readings of anyone in the same room with it.&quot;\nFractyl said distractedly as he continued to look, &quot;but since more\nthan a few of them posses the same signature masking technology as we\ndo, they could be just hiding their signatures from us.&quot; Fractyl\nshrugged as he continued, &quot;The signature is coming from some sort of\nwarehouse, so I would think that there would be some sort of defenses\nonline as the valley mine is not the safest place to be.&quot;\n\nIguanus nodded, &quot;Yep. That&#39;s what I&#39;d do, mask your signature, cover\nthe place so you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s who or even where.&quot;\n\nInferno stood next to Hydras as he also looked at the readouts, &quot;If\nthat spark is what you want lord sire&quot; Inferno said, &quot;Then with you at\nthe lead NOTHING can stand in our way!&quot;\n\nFractyl just glanced back at Hydras, waiting for his next command.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
