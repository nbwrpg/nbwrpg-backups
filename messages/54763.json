A lou=\r\nd bang could be heard through out the docking \nlevels and in the enginering=\r\n rooms.  She tried again and again, but \nthe vent cover would not move.  Sh=\r\ne sighed and went around looking \nfor another vent.  She found one and hope=\r\nd this one would let her \nout.  She Rammed it at full speed.  The vent cove=\r\nr gave way. She fell \n50 feet to the ground.  She rolled and landed in a bi=\r\ng shrub.  She \nlay there, dazed for a few minuted. &quot;uhhhh, that didn&#39;t feel=\r\n good \nmom.&quot; she said in a soft voice. She got up and started limping in fo=\r\nx \nmode away from the base.  She got to the main perimeter when she \nlimped=\r\n into the force field they had up to protect them from the \nplague.  She st=\r\narted to cry. &quot;I just gotta get out of here. I must \nkeep them safe.&quot;  She =\r\nlooked up at the sky. &quot;I&#39;m trying momma. I \nreally am.
