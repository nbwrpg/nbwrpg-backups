Her hands were\nresting on his shoulders as they stood there for a moment. Her optics\nmoved slightly to glance at his neck when she felt what she thought\nwas a slight twinge in his neck. Still mezmerized by him, her optics\nrefocused on his.  She felt absolute calm at that moment. All in the\nuniverse was well. Just him and her and that&#39;s all that mattered. Even\nin that perfect peace, she felt her spark start to break. She couldn&#39;t\nshow it to him, nor would she. She leaned up and kissed his lips\nagain. &quot;Come on, we should get going. Oh, and when we get back, I\nthink you may need a tune up.&quot;  She tilted her head to the side. The\nsame side his neck had twinged at. &quot;Or if you want, I can try to fix\nit later on. Perhaps back at my quarters?&quot; she said in a playful tone. \nShe let her hands glide down his shoulders and down his arms until her\nhands met his.  She let her right arm go and still held his right hand\nwith her left.  She stood there hoping they might walk the rest of the\nway hand in hand. She did however wonder why a bot&#39;s neck hydrolics\nwould move like that. His body was acting more like an organic in that\nrespect and less like a bot. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice::\n&gt;  \n&gt; he loved her smile, it warmed even the dark corners of his spark. \nShe had no intention to ever leave him, which was good.  She then\nreminded him of what they were doing out here in the first place, to\nfind a bot out here, and mentally berated himself for forgetting.  She\nthen suggested they wait and continue to share this moment, and joked\nthat they might have a search party sent after them.  An amusing idea.\n But if there was a search party people would worry needlessly, and he\ndidn&#39;t want to mess with it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I suppose we better get going,&quot; he said, with a kiss to her\nfaceplates and a smirk of his own.  &quot;We have time to cuddle after\nwe&#39;re done.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He stands up and and sets her on her feet, but lets his hands travel\nup her sides and arms.  He rested his hands on her elbows and\ncontinued to smile down to her, wondering if she felt the strange\nmuscle like movement in his neck.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
