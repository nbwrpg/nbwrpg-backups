Lol.\n\n=\r\nBic:\n\nTucson transforms and gestures to Straightshot who is still on Leo&#39;s =\r\nshoulder.  She replies back to him using the same language.\n\n&quot; He says you&#39;=\r\nre doing well, keep it up.  He&#39;s gonna lead us out through another tunnel, =\r\none he noticed when he was separated from us.  Be ready, phase two is now i=\r\nn action. And remind he says remind him ta teach you sign language when thi=\r\nngs quiet down.&quot;\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot; You want to arrest me?  Then you will ha=\r\nve to catch me first.  That&#39;s if you can catch me.&quot;\n\nHe makes a dash for th=\r\ne tunnel which he intends to show them the alternate route out of the cave.=\r\n\n\n&quot; I hope Leo is getting all of this.  It&#39;s the only way I know how to foo=\r\nl Magmatron.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straightshot rushes over to Leo Prime and =\r\nhops up on his shoulder.  She is\n&gt; &gt; quick to wisper in his ear what Tucson=\r\n is up to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorry, forgot ya didn&#39;t know sign language.  Here&#39;s the=\r\n deal, Tucson is not\n&gt; &gt; turning on us purposely, he&#39;s doing it so he can f=\r\nool Magmatron into falsely\n&gt; &gt; trusting him.  It&#39;s the only way he can get =\r\naround Magmatron without\n&gt; &gt; suspicion.  Pass it  along in a silent com to =\r\nthe others.  And play along\n&gt; &gt; with him.  It&#39;s the only way we&#39;re gonna ge=\r\nt outa this in one piece and if\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t then, it won&#39;t work.  So plee=\r\neease, try and make this work.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Leo Prime.  And the=\r\nn turns to Magmatron.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;  Hmmm, certainly a proposal worth taking yo=\r\nu up on.  All right, Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; and Leo Prime!  There can be only ONE lead=\r\ner among us!  And that leader is\n&gt; &gt; ME!    You cringe like cowards!  You&#39;r=\r\ne afraid to face me in a fight because\n&gt; &gt; you know you do not measure up t=\r\no my caliber!  None of you were trained by\n&gt; &gt; Master Yoketron, nor did you=\r\n take his training as seriously as I have!  Now,\n&gt; &gt; let that mistake be yo=\r\nur downfall!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the mean time, he sends an internal message to the=\r\n others, one that\n&gt; &gt; Magmatron can not hear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; If we are to get ou=\r\nt of this without suspicion or death, I need you all to\n&gt; &gt; play along with=\r\n me.  I am not really turning on you, it&#39;s an act that has to\n&gt; &gt; be played=\r\n just right or else it will fail miserably.  I need your FULL\n&gt; &gt; cooperati=\r\non on this and trust what I am about to do, even though, it looks\n&gt; &gt; diffi=\r\ncult to trust.  Rodimus, Leo, I need you to fight me with everything\n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu got, and take heart, if I fall, I understand why, and anything that\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nappens to you, I apologize in advance.   We can do this, Maximals, we can\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; be far better than Magmatron.  Now, time to put our plan into action.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Remember... FULL COOPERATION FROM ALL OF YOU OR ELSE THIS DOES NOT WORK.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson roars, as he turns to Leo and the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, it=\r\n&#39;s not polite to keep your opponent waiting!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As TUSCON attempted to t=\r\nransmit his message all he could back was\n&gt; static and internal feedback. I=\r\nt would seem that radios and comlinks\n&gt; were still down here in the tunnels=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; However LEO PRIME tunred to look at TUSCON, he nodded ever so slight=\r\nly\n&gt; to try ant let TUSCON know that he understood what was going on.\n&gt; Evi=\r\ndently STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s words were enough to give him a few clues as\n&gt; to wha=\r\nt to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, you are under arrest. If you are not willing to come=\r\n quietly,\n&gt; then you will have to come the hard way!&quot; LEO frowned in looked=\r\n only\n&gt; semi-believably. He was obviously not the best of actors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Howe=\r\nver none of that mattered as the whole rooom continued to shake as\n&gt; fire a=\r\nnd energy spewed itself up out of the pit, destrying the remains\n&gt; of the b=\r\nridge that was over it as well destroying all of the equipment\n&gt; that SABER=\r\nBACK and MAGMATROn had placed around it. Even the stone that\n&gt; had fell ove=\r\nr SABERBACK himself was blown away.\n&gt; \n&gt; All around the room vibrated dange=\r\nrously as the fire and energy\n&gt; scorched the roof of the cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATR=\r\nON looked at the fire and energy and then back at TUSCON and\n&gt; then his rem=\r\naing soldiers, &quot;Retreat!&quot; he called out. &quot;We have lost\n&gt; what we came for, =\r\nretreat.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON began to back out twards the caves that were comin=\r\ng out of\n&gt; the middle of center of the room, protected from the fire and en=\r\nergy\n&gt; only because they faced outward instead of inward.\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE wast=\r\ned no time in bolting, followed by the remining SHARKTICONS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even the =\r\nPREDACONS were looking at the tunnel. &quot;Skyshadow!&quot; CRYOTEK\n&gt; said, &quot;Leave t=\r\nhe Maximals to fend for them selves, we have everything\n&gt; we need.&quot; He glan=\r\nced around the room. &quot;Pick up our wounded and\n&gt; retreat!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The room was=\r\n beginning to heat up!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
