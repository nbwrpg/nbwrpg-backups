Her \n&gt; life-force was contained in the form of a\n&gt; transformer&#39;s spark, \n&gt; creating a bot with immense powers.  She is now\n&gt; starting to establish \n&gt; some measure of control over those powers.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kyle Stewart\n&gt; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; No, that was the only one, musta&#39; deleted it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I replied to your original email about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; character, saying I would back the idea.
