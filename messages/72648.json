I can remember watching Transformers in High\nSchool, rushing home to watch it along with Robotech - my two favorite\ncartoons, and probably what shaped my cartoon Scifi :) (I did like\nVoltron and Battle of the planets too btw)\n\nWhich types of transformer are you most familiar?\nI am mostly familiar with the G1/G2 80&#39;s cartoon as well as the US\ncomic. I also know Beast Wars, Beast Machines, TF: Antimated and TF:\nPrime.\n\nWhat are your favorite characters from the cartoons?\nFrom the cartoon, Soundwave, Cyclonus and Scourge. My all time\nfavorite though is Shockwave but from the comics that came out in the\n80-90&#39;s. I loved Shockwave&#39;s logic and intelligence, and turning into\na big gun wasn&#39;t bad either. He was an evil Mr Spock and I loved that\npersonality style and he well represents my logical side. Cyclonus is\nloyalty, honor and duty which I like as well and I believe is a big\npart of my personality. Scourge is aggression but he is also a hunter\nand a goal orientated person who wants what he wants. I like that\nsometimes.\n\nHow long have you been roleplaying, and where?\nWell lets see. I have been roleplaying since the mid 80&#39;s. I have\nplayed a great many different types of RPG&#39;s from D&D to Star\nFrontiers, Star Trek, various types of super hero games, we had even\nmade up a table top version of Transformers which was cool. I have\nbeen playing on a MUSH/MUX site in the mid to late 90&#39;s, although\nnothing recently. (MUSH/MUX are like big chat rooms where you can\nroleplay in real time.) I have played in games like this one, via\nemail, since 2000 or something like that, but the transformers\nversions of it I started I think in 2003 or there about.\n\nWhat do you like about Role playing, what are you looking for?\nI like them for relaxations. For me it is like a reading a book only I\nam writing it in collaboration with other writers. Battles are cool,\nbut the epic drama, the story lines, the personal growth, THAT is what\nkeeps me going. But most importantly I like having FUN!\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 11/13/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Okay, this looks fun actually.  For starters, I&#39;m forty one years old, and\n&gt; I&#39;m familiar with TFG1, Armada, Energon, Cybertron, Beast Wars, Beast\n&gt; machines and TF animated.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been role playing for about five to six years and I would have to say\n&gt; that one of my favorite characters from Armada is DEMOLISHER. He was\n&gt; considered the comic relief of the series.  In TF animated, I would have to\n&gt; say that my favorite was basically all of them, with the exception of\n&gt; Starscream being my ultimate favorite.  No matter what series, Starscream\n&gt; was the best. Especially in the Energon series, where he actually had a\n&gt; change of heart.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I like about role playing is that we can take on whatever character we\n&gt; want, within reason. I chose my characters based on my many aspects of my\n&gt; personality, and found it fun to break it up into various characters.\n&gt; Tucson represents my short temper while Nightshift portrays my reasonable\n&gt; side.  Then there&#39;s the casually comical side portrayed by Quickstride and\n&gt; Uproar.  Sarcasm gets portrayed by Rattrap and Straight Shot.  Put them all\n&gt; together and you have me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is worth more than family and friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 13, 2011, at 9:16 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here are a few questions that i asked Airly, and I think I will throw\n&gt;&gt; out in a public way. You don&#39;t have to answer them all if you don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; want to, some of us are private people, but they can give us a little\n&gt;&gt; background into who we are as players and what we like.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How old are you (You don&#39;t have to answer this one if you don&#39;t want to.\n&gt;&gt; Heh!)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which types of transformer are you most familiar? (80&#39;s Cartoon, 80&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; Comic book, TF: Antimated, TF: Prime, TF: Energon, Dreamwave Comics,\n&gt;&gt; ect.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What are your favorite characters from the cartoons?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How long have you been roleplaying, and where?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you like about Role playing, what are you looking for?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, you don&#39;t have to answer all the questions, but it gives\n&gt;&gt; something to think about, and helps us to get to know you. I will be\n&gt;&gt; posting my own answers as well in the next day or so :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
