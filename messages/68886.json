You could obt=\r\nain power that spans the universe, a name \nfor yourself greater than any Cy=\r\nbrtronian Autobot or Decepticon! The \nfuture is yours to make, here and now=\r\n! Join us!&quot;\n\nAround him sweeps manuvered, their movements agitated and aggr=\r\nessive \nas if they too knew of the tense offer delivered to the Predicon \nc=\r\nommander.\n\nDecibel floated nearby Cyclonus uncharacteristically silent, onl=\r\ny a \nlow chuckle coming from her vocators.\n\n\n\nGrimlock, Lord Elder, and Leg=\r\nacy fired at the incoming sweeps, their \nfirepower combined with that of th=\r\ne shuttle and Ark is great indeed! \nExplosions dotted the skies as many swe=\r\neps attempted to dodge the \nfire and are unsuccessful.\n\nHowever the sweeps =\r\nwere becoming more cagey as the fight continued, \nas if they were learning =\r\nfrom the deaths of the previous ones, \nbecoming more skilled, even seeming =\r\nto anticipate attacks! \n\nEven Scorponok and Zarak are feeling these repercu=\r\nssions. Their \nattack from the rear bit a large sized hole in the minion fo=\r\nrmation \nas the fusion cannon, rockets and machine guns rip into the mass. =\r\nYet \nfor the G2 Decepticons it was like shaking a bee-hive. At the first \nt=\r\nhey had not been attacked as the Sweeps had been ignoring \nDecepticons and =\r\nPredicons, but that changed with this attack! As more \nsweeps maneuvered th=\r\nrough the air to fill in the hole opened by \nScorponok and Zarak, disintegr=\r\nation cannons opened fire on them, the \nair filling with a slight burning s=\r\nmell!\n\n\n \nJhiaxus and Myrmidon headed into the mass of the sweeps, and the =\r\n\nsweeps enfolded them, twisting and turning. The jets were more agile \nthen=\r\n the sweeps, but the sweeps seemed to be well armored, and \npossesed a rath=\r\ner large numerical advantage. \n\nShots are fired on both sides, Jhiaxus and =\r\nMyrmidon both taking down \nseveral sweeps at a time, but these seem to be r=\r\neplaced by a \nseemingly endless number of them. \n \n\n\nAs Dark Rodimus arrive=\r\nd it was becoming obvious to the casual \nobserver that even though many of =\r\nthe sweeps had been destroyed, \nthere were still many of them in the skies.=\r\n The smell of burnt metal \nand alloy was begining to fill the air, as smoke=\r\n covered the ground \nobscuring vision of many. \n\nHowever even through all t=\r\nhat the aerial form of Cyclonus stood out, \nresplendent and majestic, like =\r\nan emperor looking over the land he \nwill soon conquer! \n\nAs Dark Rodimus&#39; =\r\nfirepower reaches into the skies, Cyclonus turned \ntoward it as if at the l=\r\nast moment detecting it, but it is too late! \nPower ripped through his syst=\r\nems as circuits are temporarily \noverloaded and his once pristine armor is =\r\nsinged, scorched and \npitted! \n\nInwardly Cyclonus smiled as he knew who it =\r\nwas that did this: Rodimus \nhad arrived!\n\nFlipping through the skies by the=\r\n power of the blast it took a moment \nfor Cyclonus to regain his bearing in=\r\n the air. As he leveled out, \nalready sweeps were rallying to his aid, brin=\r\nging their cannons to \nbear on Rodimus and opening up on him!\n\n&quot;NO!&quot; Cyclon=\r\nus called to them, his voice radiating power and \nauthority.  &quot;He is mine!&quot;=\r\n  he commanded as he launched twin \nincendiary missiles at Rodimus, ones th=\r\nat glowed like miniature twin \nsuns, as they seemed to almost glide foward =\r\ntoward Rodimus!\n\n\n\n&quot;It is time!&quot; barked Scourge across the minion communica=\r\ntion network, \neven as he watched his commander and friend get pulled into =\r\nthe fray. \nHis gruff voice crackled in the ears of Nightstrike, Darkfate an=\r\nd \nTummult. \n\nWith a single command sweeps pulled out and away, launching f=\r\nrom the \ncenter of the group. They did not target Rodimus or the Decepticon=\r\ns! \nInstead nearly a third of the remaining sweep moved at their primary \nt=\r\narget, led by Scourge, and Tummult (and Darkfate and Nightstrike??), \nwith =\r\ncannons blazing they pushed towards the ARK!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
