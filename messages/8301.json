She took another rock out and dropped it at him.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m no humming bird. But to be compared to such a flying gem is \n&gt; praise indeed. Though I lack the colors of a humming bird, I thank \n&gt; you for you kind words.&quot;\n&gt; She hoped that would get to him. &quot;I would love to spar with you my \n&gt; beloved friend. But as you can most likely tell, you have the upper \n&gt; hand.  Since I can not out muscle you, I an trying to make you use \n&gt; another muscle. One that you don&#39;t use very often.&quot;  She laughed \nout \n&gt; loud hoping that would get to him. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The rock bounced off a low hanging branch. By throwing the rocks \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; her beak she&#39;d lost much of her accuracy. It landed about three \n&gt; feet \n&gt; &gt; to his left. By hiding herself in the foliage she&#39;d given up most \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; her flying advantages. How to get up to where she was on the \nother \n&gt; &gt; hand, was Lunarpines main disadvantage. She thought out her \n&gt; strategy \n&gt; &gt; well this time. If he could teach her to use those skills in a \nreal \n&gt; &gt; battle she would easily survive every time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I&#39;d wanted to fight rocks then I wouldn&#39;t have needed a \n&gt; sparring \n&gt; &gt; partner. So Come out and fight you overstuffed hummingbird.&quot; he \nwas \n&gt; &gt; hoping to rattle her nerves, make her stop thinking for a few \n&gt; &gt; seconds. A wolf can&#39;t climb trees, but a bot can, all he needed \nwas \n&gt; &gt; for her to lose her temper and give him an opening.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
