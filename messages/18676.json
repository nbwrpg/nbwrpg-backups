Her optics already black,  her spark\n&gt; in it&#39;s finally beats.\n&gt; She whispered,&quot;Hotrod....HotRod..I...I..&quot; her spark\n&gt; flutters,&quot;I...loved...you...for...give....me.&quot;  a single tear ran\n&gt; down her cheek as the finall breath escaped past her\n&gt; lips.  &quot;HotRooooddd.&quot;  Her spark went to join the matrix.\n&gt; Her once beautiful body now lay in charred pieces on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (Please put Feline on the deceased list.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
