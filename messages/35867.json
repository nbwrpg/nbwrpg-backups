Yes, he knew this robot. It was an\n&gt; Autobot. He sighed. That meant it would be wrong to rip it apart. &quot;Me\n&gt; say are you...&quot; he was cut off as the two armor piercing shells hit him,\n&gt; and exploded, sending him falling on his side. He snarled, turned his\n&gt; head, and opened his mouth, letting loose a stream of laser fire at the\n&gt; attacker. &quot;Yeh, now Dinobots stomp.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
