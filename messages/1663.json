She\nwas through thinking about her dead friend and a new subject had popped into\nmind, after killing Megatron...what would she do?\n&gt; She had thought long and hard about it but had come up empty clawed. The\nMaximals didn&#39;t seem to bad, besides the fact that she thought that their\nleader was either a coward and just plain under trained, the\nPredacons...that was just a joke! She had learned her lesson about the\nPredacons, they were cheats, murderers and scoundrels and she wanted nothing\nto do with them, but the Alliance. In order to become an Alliance member she\nwould have to end up trying to kill both Maximals and Predacons...that\nwasn&#39;t her style.\n&gt; So in plain, being Neutral was the best thing to stick with so far...so\nfar.\n&gt; Carnage sighed as she came to a middle sized lake, she wandered over to\nthe edge of it and dipped her snout in for a drink. The water was cool and\nshe drank well, but just as she was about to pull her snout from the water\nshe happened to look up and...\n&gt; She saw Teltoli conversing with a Dragon and the Fuzor she had seen back\nat the Ark. (SilverBolt.)\n&gt; Carnage looked at the dragon carefully, for some particular reason she had\na bad feeling about it.\n&gt; She slowly backed into the brush in which she had come and slowly began to\nmake her way towards the group, the Maxtrix forbid if Teltoli ever got\nhurt...she was her friend and that was the last thing that she wanted to\nhappen.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t long before Carnage had made her way all the way behind the\ngroup and then crouched low in the bushes, she evened her breath to a low\ntolerance and didn&#39;t move a muscle. There was no chance in the Pit that any\nof them could know that she was there.\n&gt; In truth she was only 50 metres away from the dragonbot and she didn&#39;t\nplan to get any closer, or hoped that it didn&#39;t come to her getting closer.\n&gt; She waited, she couldn&#39;t hear their conversation so it couldn&#39;t really be\ncalled ease dropping.\n&gt; Carnage set her head on her front limbs and settled down, all things would\ncome in time.\n&gt; But until she was sure that the dragon wasn&#39;t threatening she wasn&#39;t about\nto leave either.\n&gt; Her friend&#39;s very life could be depending on it.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
