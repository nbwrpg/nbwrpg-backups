The moon went=\r\n from\nappearing on the east, rising up and over the intrepid Maximals and\nP=\r\nredacons and once again beginning to settle back down into the west.\n\nIn th=\r\ne mean time TUSCON has been able to hand out his reserve supply,\nsacrificin=\r\ng his energy reserves so that his Maximals are able to gain\nback a little o=\r\nf their strength. That is all except RODIMUS. Being\nthat RODIMUS rode on TU=\r\nSCON&#39;s back and really had not expended much in\nthe way of energon, plus he=\r\n was some distance away from the rest. He\nfelt that for him to return and r=\r\netrace his route would not be the\nmost cost effective and so declined.\n\nIns=\r\ntead RODIMUS and CYCLONUS continued their goal of following the\nroute that =\r\nthe Dinosaurs had taken to reach this location, their road\nactually surpris=\r\ningly smooth, owing to the fact that you had a large\nnumber of reptiles run=\r\nning over any foliage and obstacles that may\nhave once stood in the way. It=\r\n would be some time before trees and\nbrush would begin to reclaim the area =\r\nthat was lost.\n\n\n*        *        *        *        *        *        *   =\r\n     *\n\nAt the same time NIGHTSHIFT, STRAIGHT SHOT, WASPINATOR, SCOURGE and=\r\n\nELITA finish their sweep of the dinosaurs and have a pretty well\ndefinite =\r\nmapping perimeter of things. The dinosaurs covered at least\nthe size of a U=\r\n.S. state, although that was because they had ranged\nout so much. In actual=\r\nity they covered several miles from end to end.\n\nBy the time they have fini=\r\nshed their search FRACTYL&#39;s chemical formula\nhad been used to literally eva=\r\nporate the dinosaurs, leaving the air\nstill smelling putrid, but no longer =\r\nwas there any sign of the\nreptiles left - only fallen and crushed trees, sh=\r\nrubs and other\nassorted things.\n\nSTRAIGHT SHOT was at last able to zero in =\r\non the signal that she had\nbeen picking up, it had taken her the entire tim=\r\ne since the signal had\nbeen moving, it took her some time to actually reali=\r\nze that. Each time\nshe would think she had it, it would seem to be in a dif=\r\nferent\nlocation.\n\nFinally, now behind a clump of trees she thinks she has i=\r\nt, she could\nsee the dark shape of someone or something watching her with c=\r\nrimson\noptics. The shape even looks a little familiar to her, but it is\ndif=\r\nficult to make out in the darkness.\n\n=93Wasspintor don=92t like dark shadow=\r\n bot.=94 His wings began to buzz\nangrily as his stinger missiles began to g=\r\nlow with power. SCOURGE and\nhis sweeps fanned out as they prepared for an a=\r\nttack run.\n\n=93Wait.=94 SCOURGE said, =93That thing seems familiar.=94\n\nThe=\r\nre was a chuckle from the darkness as a dark figure stepped out\ninto view. =\r\nHe was black and muted silver, his armor solid and\npowerfully built. He was=\r\n immediately recognizable as he moved into a\nclearing. Everything was the s=\r\name . . . missile launchers on his\nforearms, a large rifle in his, the swag=\r\nger in his step and a\nfirebrand emblazoned on his chest =96 although this o=\r\nne was silver and\nblack instead of the familiar red and yellow.\n\n=93Shadow =\r\nbot is Rodimus?=94 WASPINATOR said as he almost dropped STRAIGHT\nSHOT again=\r\n but not quite.\n\n=93No!=94 SCOURGE said, =93He is Dark Rodimus . . . but ho=\r\nw?=94\n\nThe dark figure looked over at SCOURGE and the rest and chuckled as =\r\nhe\nmanipulated something on his arm.\n\n\n*        *        *        *        =\r\n*        *        *        *\n\n\nMeanwhile TUSCON waits for his promised back=\r\n up . . .\n\n. . .  and waits . . .\n\n                             . . . and w=\r\naits . . .\n\nFinally there is a call from LEO PRIME to TUSCON, &quot;Tuscon, have=\r\n you\nheard anything from the Fuzors? They have missed their last check in.&quot;=\r\n\n\nIn the distance a single dark shape moved toward TUSCON&#39;s position,\nits I=\r\nFF signature indicating that it was one of the Fuzors - NOCTORRO!\n\nThe Fuzo=\r\nr, even from this distance, did not look to be in good shape\nat all. His fl=\r\night was erratic and jerky as he approached.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
