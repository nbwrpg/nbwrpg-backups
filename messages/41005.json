He was ready to dodge the blast, but he doubted Hovotron would fire. The yell from Domnijoe made his smile grow wider, but he glances annoyingly at Firestrike as the dissident spoke, then returning his gaze to Hovotron.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Interesting faction you have. Who exactly did you say was the commander?&quot; Autofire asks, playing off of the uncertainty of the Constructicons and whatever was going on with the bot behind Hovotron. His smile shrinks somewhat as the Constructicons briefly form Devastator, but he smiles again as Devastator crumbles.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Your troops seem to be a bit out of shape,&quot; he comments.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nScavenger lands safely on the ground, transforming back to robot mode and looking around, seeing if anyone other than Hook was hurt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Sorry this took so long, and if you Constructicons don&#39;t mind, I am\n\n\n&gt; going to handle the merging. If that&#39;s not allright we&#39;ll make this post\n\n\n&gt; void. :)\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Hook looked around nervously still clutching his shoulder, about to\n\n\n&gt; protest to Havotron when he got a look at his leaders eyes. He then\n\n\n&gt; looked to the rest of his comerades, the confidence returning to his\n\n\n&gt; face, so as not to show the others his moment of weakness. &quot;We do as he\n\n\n&gt; says.&quot; Hook told Scrapper, leaping into the air, &quot;Constructicons,\n\n\n&gt; transform, phase one.&quot; he said, as he shifted in midair, his arms\n\n\n&gt; hooking in, his legs turning over, and his torso extending from his\n\n\n&gt; body, as his crane became apparant. He shrieked a loud cry of pain in\n\n\n&gt; his transformation, and landed on the ground in truck mode, creating a\n\n\n&gt; large thud from his mechanical weight.\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Scrapper knelt down onto his hands, as they too transformed, as he\n\n\n&gt; lowered to the ground in his steam shoovel mode, followed by Bonecrusher\n\n\n&gt; and Scavanger who also shifted. Longhaul and Mixmaster then finished\n\n\n&gt; their transformations as well. \n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Hook drove out to the front, very slowly, &quot;Transform phase two.&quot; he\n\n\n&gt; shouted, as Scavanger and Mixmaster both drove up, and transformed,\n\n\n&gt; their, Scavanger shifting to stand up on his shovel, as Mixmaster did\n\n\n&gt; the same, as they both shimmered in their transformations. Longhaul&#39;s\n\n\n&gt; truck form took off from the ground, and shifted in mid air, connecting\n\n\n&gt; to the two legs to form an impressive lower body, as he two shimmered.\n\n\n&gt; Hook followed, barrely making it to the body, and connectin as the chest\n\n\n&gt; part, and shimmering as well. Bonecrusher and Scavanger followed,\n\n\n&gt; hooking on the the sides of Hook, and begin to shimmer, but strangely\n\n\n&gt; Bonecrusher quickly stops shimmering, and falls off in a loud klang, as\n\n\n&gt; the rest of Devastator begins to crumble as well, (Okay, you guys can\n\n\n&gt; post now :).\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Hooks lands on his side, transforming, and screams clutching his\n\n\n&gt; shoulder.\n\n\n"}}
