Not above ground, but below it. Deep inside the planet in \na large military installation large ships are being built day in and day out, \npreparing for the day in which they may need to defend the final X-Predacon \nsafe place from the Infecticons. On another part of the planet a large ship \nsits, with X-Predacon troops all around it. Inside it, scientists stand \naround working on a massive machine that makes up approximately one half of \nthe ship. As they do the X-Predacon leader stands behind them waiting \npaitiently for their report. Finally one of the scientists walks up to him \nand salutes him.\n\nScientist: &quot;Sir, we have finished the device. With it this ship will be able \nto warp to any place in the universe during any time period. Might I add you \nalso made us place three times the firepower on this ship then you do with \nother ships this size. Im suprised theres still room for the crew and the \nVile Pods...&quot;\n\n????: &quot;Who cares what you think!? Now that you have finished with the device \nI want you and everyone else&#39;s monkey skid plates off this ship in five \nminutes before I lay the smack down on you!&quot;\n\nThe scientist nods and begins to step away slowly from the leader before the \nleader transforms into a hand and slams down onto the scientist. With the \nscientist pinned between its fingers the robotic hand fligns him into a wall \nwith a sickeding thud before two finger tips are sent at the scientist \nblowing him to tiny bits. The hand then transforms into robot mode as the \nother scientists just move back and away from him.\n\nGigatron: &quot;Why are you standing there you jabronies!? Get your monkey skid \nplates off this damn ship before I lay the smacketh down on you too!&quot;\n\nWith that all of the scientists all run out of the room and in a matter of \nminutes the ship is empty aside from Gigatron and the Vile Force.  Gigatron \nwalks back and forth infront of the Vile Force before he stands in front of \nthem again.\n\nGigatron: &quot;Now it is time for you jabronies to go back in time and layeth the \nsmackdown on all those Preds and Maximals back on Prehistoric Earth before \nthe timeline can be changed. I would go myself but I must lay the smackdown \non these new guys that have invaded our Galaxy. This ship has a transwarp \ncommunicator so you will be able to contact this base at any time. Good luck.&quot;\n\nThe Vile Force all nod and each member hits his chest quickly. Gigatron \nlaughs and then leaves the ship as its systems power up. The door to the ship \nsoon closes and the large ship rises into the sky and begins to glow. Inside \nthe ships cockpit Vile stands infront of Gemini 2 and Methos, two members of \nthe Vile Force and nods to them.\n\nVile: &quot;For Gigatron and our future!&quot;\n\nElsewhere Skywarp and Cyanide stand infront of the massive Machine that will \nallow the ship to travel through time and space with ease. And still \nmeanwhile in the cargo hold infront of a scorpion like machine, Gemini 1 and \nDestruction sit down playing poker. The cards begin to shake as the ship \nglows brighter in the sky lighting the ground below.\n\nGemini 1: &quot;Here we go!&quot;\n\nAnd just as that is said the ship dissapears from sight. Back in time, above \nthe Destructocons and Predacons assaulting the trainers base, a massive \nportal opens, bright light falling onto the base itself and the men outside \nit.\n\r\n--part1_c9.10b7e8b3.2849467a_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=arial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=3 FAMILY=&quot;SERIF&quot; FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; LANG=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Braxus 2, the dark desolate world that is being used by the X-Predacons as \n&lt;BR&gt;their secret base.
