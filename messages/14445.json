She couldn&#39;t help but wonder what was \n&gt; wrong with her.  She wondered what she could do to end her problem. \n&gt; She knew right them she had only two options left to her.  She could \n&gt; kill herself, which was out of the question.  She knew she would have \n&gt; to be reprogrammed. She looked at her body and saw the damaged.  She \n&gt; cried one last time and stepped out of the CR.  She saw Drillbit \n&gt; standing there. She looked at him with all the pain in her eyes.  \n&gt; She let the tears rolled down her cheeks as she looked at him.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;\n&gt; She walked up to him and looked into his eyes.  &quot;I..I think I know \n&gt; how to stop the pain.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She fell to her knees.  She whispered, &quot;I need you to reprogram me.&quot;\n&gt; She looked at the floor and wept. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
