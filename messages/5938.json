She faced high winds, hail and \nsnow.  She headed into the wind and kept a straight course.  She was \nhit by large hail stones.  One hit her wing. She flew down and \nlanded.  She transformed into bot mode.  With her wing damaged, she \nwouldn&#39;t be able to fly for a while.  It needed time to heal.  She \nkept walking with her face down to help block the wind and snow.  She \nstopped and stood still.  She realized her emotions had gotten her in \ntrouble again.  Here  she was, running away from one problem and \ngetting into another one.  She came to the conclusion that she would \nhave to go back to the base.  She would have to face Lunarpine and \ndeal with her feelings.  She hated her emotional side.  She wanted to \nget rid of it.  It always messed up her logic circuits.  She opened \nher comm-link. \n\n&quot;Hey Lunarpine. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll...Oh never mind.&quot;  She closed her link.  \nShe forgot about the bot trying to kill her.  She forgot about how \nany pred could home in on her signal.  She was too deep in thought.  \nShe started walking south, back to the mazimal base.  But since she \ncouldn&#39;t fly, it would take her a while. Especially in a storm. \n\n\n"}}
