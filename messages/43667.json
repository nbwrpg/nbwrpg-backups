The NBWRPG is more designed to be a story, so work out the story line with Airly. It is obvious that she doesn&#39;t want BN to have an elongated stay with the infecticons, so work why don&#39;t you talk with Airly, and find out what would work best for both BN and the Infecticons.\n\n[Airly&#39;s IDEA] -----&gt; [FINAL IDEA] &lt;----- [LegendaryNemasis&#39;s IDEA]\n\nThe above is a simple text picture to illustrate a solution that would accomodate both sides of the general though. =)\n\nThe &quot;disks&quot; storyline will be interesting, but make sure you talk to people to get a general idea of what will happen.
