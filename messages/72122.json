There were different figures hustling and\nbustling about the room, most of them not even paying attention to the\nfact that DARK RODIMUS and NIGHTLIGHT had arrived.\n\nHowever at the center of the room , two figures did notice.\n\nOne of them was sitting on an ornate chair, with proportions as large\nas he was! Larger then either DARK RODIMUS or TUSCON this figure\nlooked almost muscular the way his armor was set on his frame. He\nlooked to be as large as OPTIMUS PRIMAL was after he had became\nOPTIMAL OPTIMUS or as large as HYDRAS was now!\n\nThe second figure was smaller, standing maybe as tall as ChEETOR or\nsome of the other Maximals, but his presence is still powerful and\nsly. He was predominantly silver with purple armor at his shins and\nchest. He had wing like protruasions on his back and his cranial armor\nlooked almost like an Incan chieftain&#39;s headdress.\n\nThe large figure on the throne turned his head to look at DARK RODIMUS\nand NIGHTLIGHT, a dark smile upon his face. &quot;Ahhh yes, my black\nknight.&quot; He said to DARK RODIMUS. &quot;You have returned with a damsel in\ndistress have you?&quot; The figure&#39;s optics turned to regard NIGHTLIGHT.\n\n&quot;My lord this is Nightlight, my wife.&quot; DARK RODIMUS gestured to\nNIGHTLIGHT as he did so.\n\n&quot;Do you see lord Magmatron.&quot; The figure beside the throne said. &quot;Our\nknight thinks he has a wife now, isn&#39;t that quaint?&quot; he smiled at\nNIGHTLIGHT and DARK RODIMUS.\n\nMAGMATRON grunted, &quot;Quiet Saberback. We have serious matters to attend to.&quot;\n\n&quot;As you command Lord Magmatron.&quot; SABERBACK said as he leaned smiled at\nDARK RODIMUS and leered pleasently at NIGHTLIGHT.\n\nDARK RODIMUS stood slightly in fornt of NIGHTLIGHT in a protective\nmanuver as he watched SABERBACK and MAGMATRON.\n\n&quot;Why have you brought her here?&quot; MAGMATRON said, his voice deep and\npowerful. &quot;Have we not been enough of a family for you?&quot; He smiled,\nalthough with his teeth and expression it looked more wicked than\ncordial.\n\nThere was a pause as DARK RODIMUS&#39; optics glowed strangely for a\nmoment. &quot;She is my wife, I could not leave her behind.&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON nodded as he turned his powerful gaze on NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;You!&quot;\nHe said, his deep voice reverberating across the room. &quot;What shall we\ndo with you now?&quot; He began to chuckle wickedly, &quot;Should we let Rodimus\nkeep his prize, or should we dangle it in front of him while we keep\nit for ourselves? hmmmmm?&quot;\n\nBeside him SABERBACK began to laugh.\n\nMAGMATRON = http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/706257948/view\n\nSABERBACK =\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1016482216/view\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
