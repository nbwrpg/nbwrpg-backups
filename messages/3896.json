It obviously wasn&#39;t the \nsonic blast as she had previously thought. She took a quick look around the \nbattlefield, her optics finally soming to rest on Dinobot&#39;s dirt and fluid \ncovered body. Tavatron laid her staff on the ground beside her as she \nkneeled beside him. Tavatron growled to herself, he was going to get himself \nkilled! She was more angry at herself than Dinobot, he was always trying to \nsave her, perhaps if she was a better warrior than this wouldn&#39;t have \nhappened!\n\nTavatron gasped when she saw the green coil wrap itself about his body. \nTavatron breathed a sigh of relief, at least he wasn&#39;t offline... yet. She \nhad to get him out of here, now. Tavatron looked down at Dinobot, concern \netched on her dirt-streaked face as he slowly opened his optics and got in a \nkneeling position. She placed a gentle hand on his shoulder, unaware of \nObliteracon looming only a few yards away:\n\n&quot;Are you alright?&quot;\n\nSuddenly Tavatron&#39;s gaze snapped upward, finally realizing just how much \ndanger they were in. She took one quick look at Dinobot before shoving him \nto the left, out of Obliteracon&#39;s reach, while she rolled to the right. \nUnfortunatly she had failed to roll far enough to the right, and the \nshockwave from the force Obliteracon used to slam his foot on the ground \nknocked the already damaged Tavatron unconscious.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
