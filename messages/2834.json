She \nadmitted that she would miss him and his comments on her looks but she \ncouldn&#39;t compete with a bot who literally threw herself in his arms, a male \ncouldn&#39;t resist that...most.\nShe had lost even without trying, but she wasn&#39;t about to admit it. That \njust wasn&#39;t her way of doing things. She would brood about it on her own \ntime, as she had about other things that had caused her to become stressed.\nBrightBlade then opened her com-link to Gangon.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll just leave you and...your new partner to your...amusements. See ya \nback at base.&quot;\n\n* The last sentence was a bit bitter and harsh but she really didn&#39;t care, \nas long as she was understood.\nShe then walked away from the direct approach towards the base and soon \nbegan to take the longer way, a way that would give her enough time to \nthink.And a way that would give her great distance from the...pair.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
