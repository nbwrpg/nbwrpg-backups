Insolate the programs and install the other ones \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; partially unleash her memories; and speaking about her memories... If \n&gt;&gt; Kups\n&gt;&gt; observations are true then Her behavior could be a risk for herself and\n&gt;&gt; others; we couldnt afford sedate her again I dont know how much her \n&gt;&gt; health\n&gt;&gt; could stand it; If she Remembers you, you be able to calm her down enough \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; avoid any umpleasant situation cause she has strong emotional attachments\n&gt;&gt; with you and the other being that has stronger attachment is your \n&gt;&gt; Daughter\n&gt;&gt; and it&#39;s too young to put her in a risk... Speaking about risks, do you \n&gt;&gt; know\n&gt;&gt; if she still has my blaster? I gave her in one of the Maximals invations\n&gt;&gt; and she hadnt given it back&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded, a worried but resolute look on his face as he walked\n&gt; over to where Nightlight was laying, the scanning beam Bump and Legacy\n&gt; were running was still moving slowly over her form. &quot;She has been\n&gt; through so much.&quot; He said quietly.\n&gt;\n&gt; A part of him wanted to rage at Perceptor since it was he that did\n&gt; much of this to her, yet he could not escape the stabs of guilt he\n&gt; felt at his own hand in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Her personality subroutines appear to be largely intact.&quot; Legacy said\n&gt; as he watched the data from the scanning beam, &quot;However many of them\n&gt; are noncontiguous. They will need to be reorganized so that her\n&gt; cerebral cortex can access them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump nodded obviously in agreement, &quot;Yes, but that will take some\n&gt; time.&quot; He pointed to the screen, &quot;Some of these have degraded over\n&gt; time. They will need to be restored.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus reached out a hand to touch Nightlight, but stops just short,\n&gt; not sure if his touch would disrupt the scanning field that enveloped\n&gt; her. &quot;Can you help her?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump nodded gravely, &quot;Yes I believe when can.&quot; He turned to look at\n&gt; Perceptor, &quot;If we can get some help reversing some of this damage.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy remained silent, unwilling to venture a guess, there were far\n&gt; too many variable for him to make an unqualified answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
