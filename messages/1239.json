The cargo hold is this way in case you wish to see it.&quot; He says,\n&gt; pointing down a hallway.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl exits the CR chamber. It felt good to be repaired. He walks off\ntoward\n&gt; the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt; On his way there, he sees Iron Raptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Are you all right?&quot; He asks, looking her over to make sure she was fully\n&gt; healed.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Shredder listens to Quickstrike in disgust. &quot;Megatron is not dead. He just\n&gt; contacted me and told me I&#39;m in charge.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns as he sees Pyro, Hiss, and Breakdown land.
