Another of us left! That makes four. Who do we have left? Me, \nyou Drillbit, Phobia, Goldeneye, Dollen and a near death KitKat. All \nthat remains of Megatron&#39;s vicious army. And where is our great \nleader? HE SHOULD BE HERE!! HE&#39;S IN CHARGE!!!!&quot;\n\nStarscream walked off and sat on a rock, obviously upset. He looks up \nat the rest.\n\n&quot;5 of us....not including KitKat. My vote for Phoiba still stands. \nOur great leader flees, our second in command his near death, and her \nreplacement doesn&#39;t want the job. We have to pick between ourselves. \nFirst to receive 3 votes wins. No voting for yourself. In the event \nof a tie we all vote again but only for the people who tied. What do \nyou say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
