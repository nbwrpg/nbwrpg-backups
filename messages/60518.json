Deal?&quot;\nShe shot a glance to Blacknightmare.\n&quot;We may have to retreat for a while.  But If we can at least get a hostage, and strike when they least expect it, we can crush them.  If we can get Malice, we can pit him against his allies and he&#39;ll destroy them for us!  Think of the reward we would recieve from our Master?&quot;\n \nOrganics strained to keep conscious.  Hellplague had her off the ground in a headlock with the muzzle of a dsruptor in her face.  And Now Malice and the others had to surrender, just to save her.
