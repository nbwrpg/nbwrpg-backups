He figured that someone else would be better suited to move\n&gt; &gt; Hot Rod so he scampered in the direction of Prowl. &quot;Is your friene\n&gt; &gt; functioning?&quot; He yelled at the top of his vocal unit as he ran to\n&gt; &gt; help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You missed the small but important fact that Prowl is kinda\n&gt; flying\n&gt; &gt; 40 feet or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so up in the air, Carnage, but we can say he was on the ground.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Oblitertron/Prowl::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prowl&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the Oblitercons combine.
