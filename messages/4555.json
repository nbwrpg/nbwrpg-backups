The sky was full of white \nsparkling stars. The air blew gently through the cave, what could manage. He \nstood by the CR chamber, not waiting for someone in particular. Not even \nStintra. He was getting tired. He needed to find a quiet, safe place to \nsleep. He looked around.  There was no one to keep watch of the base. Except \nhimself. Slag those fools who left. He looked like he was the only one that \nwould keep watch.\n\nSo, he would wait until Stintra recovered for him to rest. He transformed to \nbeast mode, and continued to watch the horizon.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
