They true \nstreght is in the bonds among them, always all things are comming back to \nthe bonds.&quot;and he added &quot;Yes a rescue Party, is what Hydras Expected of \nyou... But he chew more than he could bite, he was too greedy this time; \nthree maximals should have been enough, but greed screwed all&quot; Perceptor \nsighed&quot;Always you must be more carefull in victory than in a defeat...

With \n&gt; Dark Hawk in towe he hopes not to endanger him any further.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Did it ever occur to you Perceptor, that he doesn&#39;t belong to the \n&gt; Predacons in the first place?  That&#39;s right, before Hydras took him away, \n&gt; he was one of ours.  A Maximal.  And he will always be a Maximal.  And his \n&gt; name is actually Windlord. Remember that Perceptor, remember that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His voice gets colder and an air of annoyance rolls over him.  His optics \n&gt; narrow and it would appear that his patience with Perceptor was running \n&gt; thin.  Yet he was guiding them out so he had to keep his cool, no matter \n&gt; how hard it was for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; So if anyone should be highly upset about everyhing, it really should be \n&gt; Lord Elder, Rodimus Prime and myself.  Your leader is the one who took our \n&gt; comrades away from us.

That&#39;s one lesson Hydras ain&#39;t learned yet.  Hmmm, he must really \n&gt; have a brain the size of a turbo rat&#39;s head!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson listens to Night Shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Shh...  Easy..

More and more he felt most\n&gt;&gt; &gt; confident in Rodimus&#39;s abilities to return to his leadership duties. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; had held back hoping Rodimus would make the right decision, to his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; assurance he had.  He nodds in agreement of getting out of there, and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; respects Perceptor&#39;s wish to have his feedom of choice.  And then he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; gets\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the all clear from Dark Hawk to help him.  Tucson Prime kneels down and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gently picks him up, and carefully, without hurting him, places the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; stasis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cuffs on Darkhawk.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; All right, Dark Hawk is sedated and securred.

He looks to Legacy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but my energy signature reading&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; just\n&gt;&gt; &gt; picked up the pressense of another Autobot.  Hmm, wonder who it is...&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He pulls of a profiler on his gauntlett device, and drums up Straight\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Shot.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Ooooh Primus, things are gonna get interestn&#39; at the Ark.

She had met him at one time, but did not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get the chance to really know him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Right?  It&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were \n&gt;&gt; &gt; introduced\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a while ago, but, maybe ya don&#39;t remember who I am.
