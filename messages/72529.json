If they can do that to him I&#39;m pretty sure the same has been\n&gt; done to the Dinobots, and possibly to Primal and Cheetor.  This situation\n&gt; has become increasingly severe.  I&#39;m sure Rodimus is on his way to being\n&gt; reformatted himself.   If only we had a way to copy Saberbacks intel, and\n&gt; transfer it back to Stanton, Bump and Legacy.  We could then try and trap\n&gt; our altered comrades and get them into stasis lock long enough to transport\n&gt; them out of here.  Big Convoy, how many sets of stasis cuffs do you and the\n&gt; others have on hand?  If we play our cards right, we might just be able to\n&gt; achieve more than one goal.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBIG CONVOY said nothing for a moment as he watched the guards continue\nto prod RHINOX towards the door they had originally come out of.\nSABERBACK&#39;s door stayed shut.\n\n&quot;Boyo we barely got the guns out.&quot; NIGHT VIPER said from his crouching\nposition. &quot;Plus we weren&#39;t comin&#39; for Maximals, we came to get\nMagmatron.&quot;\n\nCONVOY glanced back, &quot;I have four pair.&quot; he said quietly.\n\n&quot;What was that?&quot; LONGRACK said from his position next to TUSCON,\n&quot;Where did you get those?&quot;\n\nThere was a small grunt from BIG CONVOY, &quot;Let&#39;s just say I had hope\nfor Magmatron and a few on his team.&quot;\n\nLONGRACK nodded, &quot;But now what? I don&#39;t think we can walk in and just\nask Saberback for the information we need.&quot;\n\nThere was a grunt from STAMPY, &quot;Maybe we can just go in there and\ntake!&quot; He smacked a fist into an open hand.\n\nCONVOY was about to respond when SABERBACK&#39;s door slid open and once\nagain he stepped, this time he was accompanied by another seeming\nSHARKTICON, but this one, while looking identicle, seemed a bit\nsmarter or more aware.\n\nThey both began to walk towards the same door that the gaurds had used\nwhile proding RHINOX.\n\n&quot;Now Skybyte, let us check on our newest prisoners.&quot; SABERBACK said.\n\nThere was a silent nod from SKYBYTE as he walked with SABERBACK up the hall.\n\nBIG CONVOY frowned, &quot;Perhaps we can take it after all. But whatever\nwe&#39;re going to do, we need to do it quickly.&quot; He looked back at\nTUSCON, &quot;I believe that Saberback was talking about checking on the\nfew sweeps that had brought in, and you Tuscon.&quot;\n\n&quot;Slag.&quot; SHARPEDGE said, &quot;The steel is about to hit the furnace.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
