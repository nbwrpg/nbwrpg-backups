Iron Raptor was\n&gt;going to sacrifce herself but Prowl saved her. She wanted to calm\n&gt;Obliteron down but now Liono Prime is going to fire on him. Octociz\n&gt;sees that and is now firing on Liono even though They are both\n&gt;Maximals. As for the TM3 thing, Vulois found a TM3 driver that was\n&gt;created when Cheetor sabotaged Megatron&#39;s TM2 device in the real\n&gt;Beast Wars. Now Vulois, Soundwave and mayve Ramjet are planning to\n&gt;use it to start a new faction and win the Beast Wars.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
