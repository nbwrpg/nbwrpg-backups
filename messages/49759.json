The pieces from \nthe shuttle crash were scattered for hundreds of feet. Part of the \nright wing was 318 feet from a piece of the nose.  There was a fire \nfrom the engine to 200 feet behind the shuttle.  All the windows were \ncracked and smoke raised from the main portion of the shuttle.  The \nmain portion of the shuttle was still somewhat intact.  It was \ncrushed yet still large enough to hold a bot.  The bots arm was 67 \nfeet from the shuttle and the rest of the bot was nowhere to be found.\n\n   All of a sudden from inside the main portion of the ship the was a \nbanging.  Tick Tick Tick.  The sound of a fist against metal.  There \nwas screaming from inside the shuttle.\n\n   &quot;Slag!  Everytime I come to Earth there is bad things.  Like I \ndecided last time Earth will NOT be my grave.  The only problem is I \nam STUCK!!!&quot;  yelled the bot from within the wreck.  \n\n   Slowly the bot got his remaining arm out of the ship through a \nsmall hole.  He tried to squeeze out yet the hole was to small.  He \ntried to hammer his arm at the hole to make it bigger.  He tried to \nsqueeze through the hole again this time he got his head through.  \nHis face is silver with purple eyes and a purple forehead in the \nmiddle.  He has a tanish skinlike object on the sides of his face.  \nThis is face is reconized to be Cheetor&#39;s.  Cheetor then squeezed his \nwhole body through the hole.  After he squeezed his body through the \nhole, he look around and saw his left arm lieing 67 feet away.  He \nclimbed out of the crater and slowly dragged himself away from the \nship and towards the arm as mechfluid dripped from his wounds.  \nCheetor started to wonder how long it would be until someone would \nfind him.\n\nOOC:  Yes it is the loveable cat bot Cheetor, but what is his purpose \nto come back to Earth?  Do you care?\n\n\n"}}
