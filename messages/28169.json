I&#39;m sorry to have dissapeared for a long time. My life\n&gt; fell apart pretty fast and i didn&#39;t have time for the internet. but things\n&gt; have quieted down now and I have some time on the internet. I had yan fill\n&gt; me in on things, so I think i know whats going on. I won&#39;t be taking any\n&gt; characters that I left behind when i dissapeared, but i&#39;ll be bringing in\n&gt; some new ones. i took some writing classes when i could, so my writing\n&gt; should be better, but its hard to go to school when youre in my situation,\n&gt; so please don&#39;t be mad if its bad. i still have very little time, so yan\ncan\n&gt; post for me if i dissapear suddenly. I&#39;ll try to inform him so that he\nknows\n&gt; when to take over, but if you see him posting with my chars, its ok.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only people I still reconize are Yan, JP, and KSLawdogg (all meanies)!\n&gt; oh yeah, and yan gave me permission to copy his idea of the galators\n(sp?),\n&gt; so no one get mad at me for it! :)\n&gt;\n&gt; My post:\n&gt;\n&gt; Cinder, Aqua, Mist, Rubble, and Mantle were in a ship heading for earth.\n&gt; They were originaly part of the same team that Prowl (yan gave me\npermission\n&gt; :) came to earth with, but had been seperated while out on a mission. When\n&gt; they were coming back to Striker&#39;s ship, they saw it enter a transwarp\n&gt; portal, and followed. They overshot and ended up in the future, after\n&gt; Striker&#39;s crew had landed, but their hopes were high anyways.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cinder sighed, looking out the small viewport of the hall at the slowly\n&gt; oncoming little blue pretty planet. The Eletors, which was the name of the\n&gt; group that consisted of Cinder and her sibblings, were a new breed of\n&gt; Maximals. They were made after the maximals reached the same level of\n&gt; fighting technology that the predacons had used to make the galators.\nAfter\n&gt; they were tested for bugs and any bugs that had been found were fixed,\nthey\n&gt; were assigned to Striker&#39;s team. They went on many missions together, but\n&gt; the latest one had taken them far from Striker&#39;s ship, and that was why\nthey\n&gt; were now following them and hoping that there were survivors. Cinder heard\n&gt; footsteps behind her, knowing that it was one of her sibblings checking on\n&gt; her. She knew they were worried, and she couldn&#39;t blame them, but she\n&gt; couldn&#39;t help but worry about the condition of her friends on earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do you think he&#39;s still alive?&quot; she asked the bot that approached behind\n&gt; her. Her voice was as worried as her thoughts, and she kinda felt sorry\nfor\n&gt; worrying her brothers and sisters.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Us Maximals are survivors, Cinder,&quot; a male voice replied to her question.\n&gt; She knew that he knew who she was talking about. &quot;He&#39;ll be ok. We couldn&#39;t\n&gt; have overshot by more than a year, and they could easily survive that\nlong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cinder looked back at her brother Aqua, her eyes a bit wet from worrying.\n&gt; She had a sleek, well shaped body with two red stripes going up her sides\n&gt; and an orange one down her middle and back. Her hair was crimson colored.\n&gt; The ship had scanned the planet and detected energon a little whiles away,\n&gt; giving the Eletors beast modes to suit earth. Cinder had a long, bushy fox\n&gt; tail swinging slowly back and forth from her rear. &quot;I hope you&#39;re right,\n&gt; brother. I hope we&#39;re not too late.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Aqua walked up and hugged his sister. He was colored different shades of\n&gt; blue. His beast mode, a blend of a dolphin and a shark, contributed to his\n&gt; compassionate attitude and his excellent fighting skills. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,\n&gt; they&#39;re allright,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Do you want something to eat? Everyone is\n&gt; at the mess hall. You can take your mind off of the situation for the\n&gt; matter.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cinder nodded, returning Aqua&#39;s hug greatfully. She walked with him\nthrough\n&gt; the ship back toward the mess hall. They entered and walked to the main\n&gt; table, where the rest of the team was seated. Cinder looked around at her\n&gt; other brothers and sisters, managing a smile for them. She sat down on the\n&gt; chair that Aqua pulled out for her, and then watched him sit down near\nher.\n&gt; Aqua was the closest to her of all her family, probably closest to\neveryone\n&gt; else too. He always cared for people&#39;s feelings.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re almost in range to make a complete scan of the planet for any\n&gt; transformers,&quot; Mantle, the bot in charge of the group, said. He was\n&gt; officially the bot in charge but the eletors were more like a family, with\n&gt; Mantle acting a bit as the father, Mist as the mother, and the rest of\nthem\n&gt; as kids. Mantle was created first of eletors, then Mist, Rubble, Aqua, and\n&gt; finally Cinder. Being the youngest, Cinder was usually pampered, and she\n&gt; hated it. She never got to do anything fun! But right now everyone was\n&gt; looking at her to see how she felt about this, as usual concerned with her\n&gt; state of mind. They all knew why she was worried about the state of the\nbots\n&gt; on the planet, although she wished they didn&#39;t know. She nodded, looking\n&gt; down at her food and picking at it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be ok.&quot; Mist leaned over and patted Cinder on the\n&gt; shoulder, trying to confort her. Mist was almost as attractive as Cinder,\n&gt; although she was slightly older and wiser, and less entusiastic about\n&gt; things. Her body was a very light blue, lighter than Aqua&#39;s. Mist was\n&gt; compassionate to all her friends, not to the point that Aqua was, but\nstill\n&gt; very compassionate. She hugged Cinder and then went back to her food,\n&gt; glaring at Rubble for a second when Rubble burped loudly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rubble mumbled, going back to his food. He was a big, strong bot,\n&gt; his coloring ranging from grey to brown. Even though he was male to the\n&gt; core, he cared very much for his family, and would give his life for any\nof\n&gt; them. In a few minutes, Mantle stood up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ok, everyone, let&#39;s get the scan going,&quot; he said and walked out of the\n&gt; room. As he left he motioned for the rest to follow. Cinder and her family\n&gt; stood up, following him toward the control room.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Jen D :)\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
