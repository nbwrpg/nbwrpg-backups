However, \nhaving a base requires you to either land a ship on the planet and \ncall it a base, or to build it. Neither of which you have done. You \nhave to post for everything that you want to happen; leave nothing \nout. Say you have have a base, then people need to have seen it land \non the planet, and then they could go and investigate. There is \nvirtually no way that a whole ship can land on the planet withough \nbeing either seen or picked up on vast array of base scanners around \nthe world. =)\n\n2) Go to the following webpage, and read up on posting style and \nform. It helps for clarity of your messages, and also helps with the \nflow of the game itself. =)\n\nhttp://www.nbwrpg.com/~rauq/howto.shtml\n\nAlso, make sure you pay attention to other peoples posts for ideas \non how to roleplay your characters, and for various forms of \nposting. Everyone has their own style, so you aren&#39;t expected to \nhave a certain style. =)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hotgy69420&quot; &lt;Hottie4u2have1@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is Panthro and to all the catbots that wanna join us heres \nthe \n&gt; base location.Its 200 miles south of Maximal City.\n\n\n"}}
