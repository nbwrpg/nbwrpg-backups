She knew that keeping info from the Allience \nleader wasn&#39;t nice, nor would it build trust.  But she didn&#39;t want to \ntell the alliance leader that megatron was dead without being \nabsolutely sure that Megatron was gone for good. &quot;Gotron, as soon as \nwe can make sure that this is Megatron and that he is dead, call your \nleader and let him know. But I don&#39;t want to send false news. Please \nunder stand this. I want this to be megatron and that he is dead.  \nBut, I just got to make sure before I tell the Allience that megatron \nis gone for good.&quot;\n\nShe turned and walked slowly towards the cave.
