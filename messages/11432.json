A flame \nretardent device had been plugged.  It wouldn&#39;t do much.  Not enough for his \nconcern.  \n\nActivating his comm. to the Maximals outside the door BrightBlade was in, he \ngave himself a little chuckle for being so slagging clever.  Even if the \nintruder got away, he could merely change all the codes making that part of \nwhat they had learned useless.  Not to mention, now, he would just leave the \nsecurity measures on in the air venting system, making them unaccessable.\n\n&quot;All Maximals waiting outside of the intruder&#39;s door,&quot; he spoke into his \ncomm. unit, &quot;it&#39;s Chordate.  Motion detectors are detecting movement in the \nwater.  With the sprinklers and foam retardent on, you will be able to see \nwhere the intruder is at, abling you too shoot at it.  Sprinkler systems will \nbe activated in the halls, as well as autoguns, so you will have cover fire \nif the assailant runs.  I will be manually controlling the autoguns.  Move \nin, now!&quot; he yelled, pressing a button, the Bright Blade&#39;s door unsealing.\n\n---\n\nFirearm, the cannon on his left arm set to rapid fire, stepped forward, the \ndoor of the room opening automatically as it sensed his movement.  Firearm \nignored water that poured out of the room, and the autoguns that came out of \nthe cieling in the halls.  He raised his cannon, seeing the outline of a \nperson, the sprinklers showing where the person was (not to mention some foam \nwas on the assailant, though the sprinklers would&#39;ve washed most of it off, \nand then there&#39;s the outline of Bright Blade&#39;s feet in the water.\n\nFirearm charged, firing off 10 rapid plasma blasts at the intruder&#39;s outlined \nchest.\n\n\nRex looked to Skulletron.  &quot;I&#39;m going in, wait here with him.&quot; he said, \ntilting his head to Smokescreen.  &quot;If the person comes, open fire!&quot; he \nyelled, running into the room, firing off a few laser bolts at the area of \nthe knees, that low, the sprinklers didn&#39;t help that much.  &quot;Give it up, or \nyou&#39;re history!&quot; Rex yelled to the unknown intruder.\n\n\nSmokescreen nodded, looking up as water poured down his face, more sprinklers \ncoming on.  He raised his electro-disruptor rifle.  This was going to be \ninteresting.  Definately.\n\nGrimmler rushed into the room, looking for a target.\n\n"}}
