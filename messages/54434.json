The bot first starts finding regular diognostic annomilies. \nSmall annomilies at first but they soon grow to be quite large \nproblems. Then the bot starts having mental circuit malfunctions. \nRanging from minor headaches, loss of memory and ringing in the \naudio sensors to complete mental function failure. Then the bot has \noptical malfunctions. Sees things that aren&#39;t there or sees things \nin multiples. In the last stages, the bot starts to develope rust \nstains in the metal skin that appear as little dots. But the stains \ngrow and start eating away at the metal of the bot. Finally, the \nbot is covered in rust and has holes in the metal body which have \nbeen eaten away by the rust. The rust continues to eat away at the \nbot&#39;s metal body both inside and out untill complete system shut \ndown and spark failure. It is spread by a small Rust NanoInsectaCon.\nThe Rust Nano InsectoCon feeds off the rust particles created by \nthe Rust itself. If one of these bots bites another regular bot, \nthere is a 75% chance that the bot bitten will be infected. There \nis no cure for the plague. The plague affects bots as well as metal \nobjests like ships and pods. Any metal object can potentially be \ninfected. But for somereason, the plague will affect bots before \nother metal objects. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Kup : : \n&gt; Kup: Well if the computer sayd he is clear, then you can let him \nout.
