He grabs \nOrganics&#39; sword and drops his disruptor rifle so she may be able to \ndefend herself.  He reduces the light he gives off, but still enough \nto interfer with vision.  He tries to get up to Blacknightmare but \nis stopped by a hail of fire.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll show you how a real Decepticon REALLY fights!&quot;\n&gt; He shifts the sword to cannon mode.  The blade splits, as does the \nhandle.  The two halves grow in size, until the handle attaches to \nhis shoulders for support.  He aims the massive weapon on \nBlacknightmare, and begins powering up the cannon charge.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague decides to get Malice&#39;s attention by capturing \nOrganics.  She succeeds and wraps an arm around her neck and hoists \nher up.\n&gt; &quot;Alright Maximals!  Stop this foolishness or your little girlly \nfriend has a weapon accident!&quot; the minion says as she aims one of \nher disruptors mounted in her arm to the valkyrie&#39;s head.\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC: Malice is temporarily supercharged.  He has better speed, but \nendurance and dexterity have suffered.  He&#39;ll take more damage, but \nhe also has all that energy to attack with.  He can use the cannon \nmultiple times, so either evade him, or try and stop him from firing \nthe cannon.  It will be a big bang.  Also, try and get Organics away \nfrom Hellplague.  She is weak and needs help.\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rodimus/BlackNightmare/Darkfate/Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was surpiced and he didn&#39;t know what to say, know that one \n&gt; of maximals was Megatron&#39;s brother was very surpriced.
