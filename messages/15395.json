He came closer, stopped, saluted, and stood tall.\n    &quot;Royalty! I have come to inform you that Rampage awaits your arrival. The \nship is up and running and armed.&quot; He said, not stumbling over words and \nbeing very tact.\n    Aracnia shighed. &quot; Excellent, we are beginning the moving process now. \nUnfortuetly, Kitkats groups has declined my offer. I guess the bunker will \nhave to remain empty.&quot; She said looking around.\n    Inferno then looked around. THe bunker was big, but the ship was much \nbetter. &quot;Shall I do anything for you, my Queen?&quot;\n    Aracnia thought a moment. &quot;Yes, take the three Maximal prisoners to the \nship with you. Aerostreak, Paralysis, and when Tarantulas gets back, will \nhelp move the important equitment on a transport.&quot;\n    Inferno nodded and went to the brig to fetch the three Maximal prisoners. \nIn the meantime, Aracnia called Quickstrike and Darkmouse.\n    &quot;Quickstrike, Darkmouse, report to the command room now. I want you two \nto go to the ship while were moving. Got it?&quot;\n    She turned to Paralysis, &quot;Get Venomus and Solo, Atma, and Pursudeo on the \nComm too, I want them here!&quot; \n    Paralysis nodded and did as he was told.\n\n"}}
