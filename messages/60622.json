Hydras appeared? How could it be? \nIt \n&gt; &gt; was a electronic puppet what was identically Hydras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Following the same idea as Megatron of Beast Wars, Perceptor did \none \n&gt; &gt; to Hydras for one ocation as this. The control was simple: the \nchair \n&gt; &gt; picked up the signals of his torso and legs and send them to the \n&gt; &gt; puppet to move it. some special &quot;Gloves&quot; picked the signal of \nhis \n&gt; &gt; arms and hands, and as the &quot;Chair&quot; sent it to the puppet. A \nSpecial \n&gt; &gt; helmet trasmited to receptor what the puppet see and heard and a \n&gt; &gt; microphone let receptor sent his voice to the puppet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;AS you see &quot;hissed Hydras&quot;I was keeping this little puppet for \n&gt; &gt; ocattions of this... Now here are my commands: YOu Inferno and \n&gt; &gt; QuickStrike will follow this puppet and will act as normally, as \nif \n&gt; &gt; this thing is me... If this puppet it&#39;s destruyed you imediatly \ncome \n&gt; &gt; back base... Waspinator will remain here with me... I might need \nyou \n&gt; &gt; at hand... Understand????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; while he was giving his instructions he was sitting done in the \n&gt; &gt; chair and dressing the &quot;gloves&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &quot;No problem here.&quot; Quickstrike said giving the okay sign.\n&gt; &quot;Yes my Queen.&quot; Inferno answered bowing before Hydras.\n&gt; The two bots awaited the artificial Hydra&#39;s next move.\n\n\n"}}
