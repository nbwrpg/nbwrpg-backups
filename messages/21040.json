He had regained \nhis old \n&gt; memory, and thought about everything that happened in his life on \nthis world. \n&gt;  He remembered when he first came, a messenger from the matrix.  \nEvil.  He \n&gt; contacted Predacons to join his group.  The first to answer his \ncall was \n&gt; Soundwave.  Soundwave came to his mountain lair and became a TM3.  \nSoon \n&gt; Vulois and Soundwave became very good friends.  battera also joined \nhim.  \n&gt; After he failed his treachery against Hell Beast, he built an \nembassy and \n&gt; turned over a new leaf.  he decided to strive for peace.  By this \ntime, \n&gt; Battera had joined the Destrons along with Cybershark.  Soundwave \nwas left in \n&gt; his quarters, thinking that Vulois had died.  Vulois contacted his \nthree \n&gt; friends and they came promptly to him.  he then assigned them \nfactions for \n&gt; peace talks.  Battera went with the Maximals and became almost part \nof them.  \n&gt; Cybershark had very little luck with the Predacons.  Soundwave went \nto the \n&gt; Alliance.  While Soundwave was there, Vulois went into a meditation \nstate, \n&gt; and when he woke up, he discovered that Soundwave had been brutally \nkilled by \n&gt; the Alliance.  many things happened after that.  he trained a young \nbot named \n&gt; Child, the Skyscorchers joined him, Eagle Eye died, GuardienAngel \nand \n&gt; AngelNemises were destroyed, and many other strange things.  \nLeading up to \n&gt; him faking his own death and joining the Alliance.  Now he didnt \nknow how he \n&gt; feeled.  He opened up his comm::\n&gt; Vulois: Battera, Cybershark, would you please come to my \ncoordinates so we \n&gt; can discuss some things?\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------------\n&gt; ::Starscream was flying around, wondering what had happened to his \ncomrades.  \n&gt; Soon his energy signature detector went off::\n&gt; Computer: Kitkat&#39;s energy signature detected.\n&gt; ::He flies down and transforms to robot mode.  he walks up to \nKitkat::\n&gt; Starscream: Kitkat!
