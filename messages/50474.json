It seems like a very nice RPG, if you ask me. Most of the writers are very good, and their posts seem well written. I really do&nbsp;enjoy looking through the posts. Haha, I don&#39;t understand a lot of stuff, because I don&#39;t know much about Neo Beast Wars, but I do like how this RPG is built. You guys do an excellent job, and I thought you deserved to hear it from someone who&#39;s not really in the RPG. ^_^ All of you are quite lucky to have such a great owner who keeps the place in shape and together. But, what&#39;s an RPG without the members? ^.~ Well, before I end up writing a speech so long that you guys forget what I&#39;m talking about (hee hee, trust me, I can do it... ^_~) I guess I&nbsp;had better shut up. ^_^ You guys are terrific! Keep up the good work, and support each other so this RPG will last! I just know you guys can do it! *cheers* NBWRPG! NBWRPG!
