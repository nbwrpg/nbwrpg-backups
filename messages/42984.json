What follows is\n\nthe full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the\nCongressional Record:\n\n&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the\nAmericans as the  most generous and possibly the least\nappreciated people on all the earth. Germany, Japan and, to\na lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the\ndebris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of\ndollars and forgave other billions in debts.  None of these\ncountries is today paying even the interest on its remaining\n\ndebts to the United States.  When France was in danger of\ncollapsing in 1956,  it was the Americans who propped it up,\n\nand their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the\nstreets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When earthquakes\nhit distant cities, it  is the United States that hurries in\n\nto help.\n\nThis spring, 59 American communities were flattened by\ntornadoes.  Nobody helped.  The Marshall Plan and theTruman\nPolicy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged\ncountries.  Now newspapers in those countries are writing\nabout the decadent, warmongering Americans.  I&#39;d like to see\n\njust one of those countries that is gloating over the\nerosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.\n\nDoes any other country in the world have a plane to equal\nthe Boeing Jumbo  Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas\n\nDC10?  If so, why don&#39;t they fly them? Why do all the\nInternational lines except Russia fly American Planes? Why\ndoes no other land on earth even consider putting a man or\nwoman on themoon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and\nyou get radios You talk about German technocracy, and you\nget automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and\nyou find men on the moon -not once, but several times - and\nsafely home again.  You talk about scandals, and the\nAmericans put theirs right in the store window for everybody\n\nto look at. Even their  draft-dodgers are not pursued and\nhounded.  They are here on our streets, and most of them,\nunless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American\n\ndollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.\n\nWhen the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking\n\ndown through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.\nWhen the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went\n\nbroke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still\nbroke.  I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced\nto the help of other people in trouble.  Can you name me\neven one time when someone else raced to the Americans in\ntrouble?  I don&#39;t think there was outside help even during\nthe San Francisco earthquake.\n\nOur neighbors have faced it alone, and I&#39;m one Canadian who\nis damned tired of hearing them get kicked around.  They\nwill come out of this thing with their flag high.  And when\nthey do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands\nthat are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada\n\nis not one of those.&quot;  Stand proud, America!  Wear it\nproudly!!\n\nThis is one of the best editorials that I have ever read\nregarding the United States. It is nice that one man\nrealizes it.  I only wish that the rest of the world would\nrealize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never\neven get a thank you for the things we do.  I would hope\nthat  each of you would send this to as many people as you\ncan and emphasize that they should send it to as many of\ntheir friends until this letter is sent to every person on\nthe web.  I am just a single American that has read this, I\nSURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.\nGod Bless\n\n\nSuzanne Goad\nCapstone\nAcademic Support Programs\nAdmissions and Records\nSouthern Illinois University\n\n\n\n\n"}}
