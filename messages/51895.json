All Transformers \nwho consume energon have one. When we take in raw energon of any form \nit passes through this machine whick changes it slightly. After this \nmachine is done, the energon then goes and powers different parts of \nour bodies.\n&gt; \n&gt; He pauses as some sparks fly from the tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Vampirtron said that he could only have energon that \ncame from Transformer bodies. All he&#39;ll have to do is take any of our \nnormal energon and process it through this machine. Then it will be \nenergon that he can have. It will seem as if the energon had came \nfrom within a Transformer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Roddy turns off the tool he was working with.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Finished. Let&#39;s get this back to Vampirtron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Roddy grabs the processor and starts to walk back to the med bay.\n\n\n"}}
