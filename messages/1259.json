He knew Quickstrike was playing with it...but he didnt \nhave the codes to access any of the surprizes he left installed. Quickstrike \nwould have to get in here himself. And the whole Rat Trap situation was \ngetting worse. Megatron just wished he was in his old form so he could rip \nout his spark....but he had to stay hidden, for now. ::::\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: Damn this! Ill have to contact Shredder. Prehaps he has had \nsuccess in finding Quickstrike, however damaged he may be.\n\n::: Looking from left to right he sends a transmission to Shredder ::: Listen \ncarefully: Have you found QUickstrike? And If you have I need you to get the \ncodes from him...And what is this i hear of the Oblitercons getting involved? \nI never ordered that! Contact me soon. Megatron out.\n\n::: With a burst of static the transmission ended, and all Megatron could do \nnow was cater to HELL BEASTs demands. :::\n\n"}}
