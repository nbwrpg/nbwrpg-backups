He charged forward and put his claws to the \nRaptor. &quot;You can let him go now, he&#39;s not going anywhere.&quot;\n\nRazorclaw was pinned and without his feat to ground him he couldn&#39;t \nactivate his shield. &quot;Ganging up on me? I thought Maximals fought \nfair.&quot; he stared at Lunarpine hoping for the chance to escape.\n\n&quot;To bad we aint your average maximal.&quot; Lunarpine stared right back at \nhim, The Raptor knew he wasn&#39;t kidding and looked away. &quot;You win, I&#39;m \nyour prisoner.&quot; The Predacon thought he was a POW, he didn&#39;t know \nthat Veratis wasn&#39;t part of the war.\n\nVeratis stepped forward, &quot;Let him down Lunarpine, He&#39;s not \nresponsible for his actions.&quot; Lunarpine let go and stepped aside. &quot;I \nthink I have some explaining to do.&quot; He started his origin speech and \nRazor Claw listened.\n\n(Did I send you information on Veratis, Foxfingers, and Lady Hawk \nyet?)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She entered into Razar Claw&#39;s mind and saw him put up his shields. \n&gt; She still could use her abilities against him. She changed into \n&gt; griffen mode without realizing it. She concentrated and pushed him \n&gt; against the wall with her mind.  She would hold him there and not \nlet \n&gt; him go. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (His robot arms are his beast legs, His shoulders flip around to \n&gt; &gt; become his thighs resulting in the catapult jump he used.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Razor Claw put up an invisible shield to protect himself from her \n&gt; &gt; pecks. He remained still, waiting to see what Ice did next.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw the break in the action and took advantage. He \n&gt; &gt; transformed to his half wolf stage and dashed into the battle. \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers rolled out and began scampering toward Lunarpine. \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine grabbed the fox and pulled him to safety.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis watched as the stalemate continued. The virus seemed to \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; given Razor Claw extra abilities too. He catalogued each movement \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; each technique. Both were changed thanks to him, and both were \n&gt; deadly.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
