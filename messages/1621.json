He\n&gt; landed on his chest, supported by his arms. He groaned in pain and\nsquinted\n&gt; his brightly glowing crimson eyes. He stared down at the ground, trying to\n&gt; think how he was going to get himself out of this. How he was going to get\n&gt; his repairs. He could always sneek himself into the Predacons base. The\nship\n&gt; would never warn Hell Beast and his troops that he was coming.\n&gt;\n&gt; He turned himself on his back and looked at his horrific leg. He tilted\nhis\n&gt; head back until it almost touched the plate behind him. He was about to\n&gt; scream, but he forced himself not to. He couldn&#39;t warn anybody that he was\n&gt; here. He was alone again, scared, wounded, and skittish on who would come\nto\n&gt; kill him. The pain on his body made him feel like he would pass out. He\ndug\n&gt; the fangs on this left hand into the ground. He uttered a strange sound\nthat\n&gt; sounded like a growl.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why did that slag have to shoot his leg? Why couldn&#39;t he have gone for\n&gt; something else?\n&gt;\n&gt; Somebody help, he called out into his mind, but knew no one could hear\nhim.\n&gt; But maybe the clone of Tarantsulus could. So he called out into the\nambient\n&gt; of his mind: Transulas, get yer keister out here!\n&gt;\n&gt; He stayed by the trees, knowing if he was out in the open he would be\n&gt; killed.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Shop at gazoontite.com & breathe happier and healthier!
