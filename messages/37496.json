Frostbite \nmonitors a globe like obect with a map of the Earth. She looks at a \nred beep signaled a ship that had went down after it entered the \nplanets atmosphere. She then looks to a black bot standing in the \ncenter of the room.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;Vampiza, Our scanners indicate that a ship has crashed \nhere on the planet shorly after our arrival. Go, destroy the \nsurvivors and all there.&quot;\n\nThe tall bot looks to Frostbite and nods before it flys straight up \ninto the area and through a large hatch. Outside of the Infecticon \nship the top of the pyramid hums as a massive field is sent outwards \nand through the top of the ship pushing all the water around the \ncircumfrence of the field away creating a hole. At the base of the \nfield Vampiza emerges and spreads his demonic wings before its body \nis encompassed in an aura of chaochitan energy. The being then \nlaunches into the air through the makeshift tunnel like lightning. As \nsoonas it passes the field tursn off leaving the ocean to crash back \nin on itself as Vampiza heads off to the site where Blindchaos and \nDomnijoe&#39;s ship had crashed.\n\n\n\n"}}
