EMPEROR \nSHOCKWAVE!&quot; he intoned loudly enough for many on the battle to hear.\n\nThe NDE Emperor launched two energy-signature seeking missiles at Scavenger\n\n---\n\nUnitron hovered momentarily in his space fighter mode, knowing exactly who \nwould die.  Getting a lock, he launched off two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles at Zardus.\n\n---\n\nFirestarter flew low in a strafing run, twenty rapid laser blasts lancing out \nat the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch approached the base in his stealth mode, cloaked from sensors \nand view.  He raised his left pincher, firing off two energy-signature \nseeking missiles at Prowl, the right pincher raising to launch two missiles \nat the Cybertronian Fire.  While doing this, he launched his cyber-bee, \nBeeline, and ran hard left so he wasn&#39;t in the same place.\n\n---\n\nManterror took flight, gaining altitude rapidly.  &quot;It&#39;s payback, traitors!&quot; \nhe screamed, firing down four ion disks (two from each arm).  Two at Dark \nOne, the two others at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nInjector raised gradually into the air, raising both stinger missile \nlaunchers.  From the left one he fired two missiles at Blades, and from the \nright one he fired two missiles at Breakdown&#39;s back.\n\n---\n\nVehement hovered, looking at the battle.  &quot;Brotherhood, I detect incoming \nforces.  Arm your weapons, and until these new enemies arrive, lay waste to \nthe bases in the name of Unicron!&quot; he yelled, raising his right fist which \ntransformed into the shape of a cannon, firing two missiles off at the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher&#39;s right wrist raised, a cannon attached to it pointed at the CF.  \nTwo fusion blasts erupted from the depths of the weapon heading for the enemy \nbase.\n\n---\n\nReflector raised his left wrist, the twin-mounted barrel on it launching off \nfour missiles (two from each barrel) at the Cybertronian Fire.  &quot;Prepare for \ndeath, heathens.&quot;\n\n"}}
