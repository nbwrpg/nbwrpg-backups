His metal, jet-like wings \nmade \n&gt; &gt; him soar through the sky. Heading high up, he took some time to \nfeel \n&gt; &gt; the wind on his face. After staying still in the sky for a moment, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; came back down fast. He broke his fall near the treetops. Finding \n&gt; &gt; Mistra again, he decided to ask some questions. The emotions he \nfelt \n&gt; &gt; in her motivated him to continue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: Mistra! Over here! (he came down lower, but was still \nin \n&gt; &gt; middair) Can I ask you something? What do you remember about \nyourself?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm...&quot; Mistra thought as she pumped her own wings, lifting \nherself into \n&gt; the air nearby Azure. What DID she remember...? Her eyes closed for \na moment \n&gt; in thought as she tried to recover some sort of memory..anything. A \nmoment \n&gt; later she quietly sighed, ears back just slightly as she shook her \nhead &quot;It&#39;s \n&gt; as if...when I woke up on this planet, I&#39;d just woken up in the \nmorning. A \n&gt; dream you know you&#39;ve had...but what exactly it was is just out of \nyour \n&gt; reach...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
