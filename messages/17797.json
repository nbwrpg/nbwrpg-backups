He turns \ntoward the nearest Maximal (Whomever it may be) &quot;Help me get Ramulus \nback to the Ark, he needs immediate medical attention.&quot;\n\nFoxfingers finds his way to the weapons storage facility onboard the \nCybertronian Fire. The code was incripted for use by certain bots \nonly. He checked the system carefully trying to resist his function \nas a thief. His programming won out. &quot;I won&#39;t take anything, I&#39;ll \njust see if I still have the old touch. &quot; He removed a set of relays \nfrom his side pockets, switched his vision to infr red to track the \nenergy input. He placed a relay on each side of the alarm circuit so \nhe wouldn&#39;t trip anything. He studied the console before removing a \npair of tweezer sized grips from his wrist compartment. The sly fox \ntapped each wire trying to find the hotwire. Foxfingers rerouted the \nhotwire to the locking mechanism shorting out both. the door creaked \na little as it slid open. &quot;I still got it &quot; He thought.&quot;While I&#39;m \nhere I might as well look inside.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
