To then try and shoot each one of them rapidly wtih a triple\n&gt; strong dose of paralytic venom in each sparkcase (the point of their armor\n&gt; where the torso plating around theis spark chambers was).\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBAZOOKA, who had just regained complete control of his leg and hip\nactuators looked up at BLACKARACHNIA. He had just enough time to\nregister her attack! He open his mouth in protest as one of her darts\nhit him and sent him sliding to the ground in a heap!\n\nGUILEDART turned to look at the BLACKARACHNIA as well and was caught\nfull in the chest as well, the dart sliding in where his armor was\nweak. GUILEDART&#39;s optics flickered once and then a second time and\nthen he too joined his companion on the ground.\n\nHowever KILLPUNCH was nothing if not paranoid and he was fully\nexpecting an attack of this sort. He merly turned to one side and used\nthe device he had in his hand to smack away BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s dart,\nsending it flying into a tree - the tree immidiatly begining to wilt.\n\n&quot;Sooo!&quot; He said as he turned back to orient on the large ebony colored\nspider. &quot;We let you live and you decide to attack us?&quot;\n\nHe smiled as twin blasters flipped open from his shoulders. &quot;Consider\nthis an end to our ceasefire!&quot; He began sending round after round of\nenergized &#39;bullets&#39; at BLACKARACHNIA!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
