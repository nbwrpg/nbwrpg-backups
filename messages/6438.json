This location was familier to him, so familiar that he could walk right to the edge of the cliff with his eyes closed but still know when to stop�just in time to reach the edge.\nThis was the very cliff that the Axalon once stood, the Maximals exploration ship and had been his home for two years before his death.\nThose were times he greatly missed; somewhat simpler then times were now. Besides, the Maximals won every battle back then�now it seemed that their lucky streak had vanished to be claimed by the Alliance and Predacons.\nDinobot shook his head, what had the Maximals become?\nHe sighed as he came to the top of the cliff, quickly looking about before setting to work.\nWith the storm about him he knew that there was no chance in the Pit of him detecting the scent of anything without coming out with a snout full of dust, so he did the next best thing, scanned for distinctive footprints and mech fluid.\nThere was no wasting time as his scanners detected a vast amount of prints, just beginning to be whisked away by the swirling wind.\nWith those prints were Tavatrons&#39;, Iron Raptors and�three other bots.\nDinobot growled deeply, he had had a very strong hunch that something had happened.\nHis quick mind dated the prints as they began to disappear, the two fembot�s a bit older then the three others but then the time and date came together. Scuffled prints just as fresh as the others It seemed as if there had been a battle of some sort, on in which did not last all that long.\nBut what really confirmed his doubts was the fact that there had just been two areas in the dusty ground where two objects had fallen, to small to be heavy equipment but to large to be weapons. So there was only one alternative�two bodies. To small to be male it was obviously Tavatron and Iron Raptor, probably downed by the attack by the three bots in which had attacked.\nThere was no scent of mech fluid but there were small stains in the rock that suggested some blood shed, most likely from either of the two fembots.\nBut who had attacked them?\nTHAT was the fact that was yet to be solved, calling upon his knowledge of the robotic inhabitance in order to aid his investigation.\nThe dust storm soon began to fade occasionally small tendrils of dust and dirt flowing across or around his metallic ankles.\nWith an annoyed snarl Dinobot shook himself, knowing for a fact that sand between the joints was a feeling in which he had grown to despise and hate. The grinding simply got on his nerves.\nQuickly looking around the area he stood in he then saw something in which he had not expected shrapnel from some sort of weapon. Hesitation not at all he walked up to it and took it up in his clawed hands, turning it over and examining it. Some weapon had been damaged in the scuffle and had obviously shed a small piece of it�s outer layer, the thought of how poorly the weapon had then been made passing quickly in his mind.\nDinobot then sniffed at the hunk of steel in his grasp, noting the earthly scent of the previous sandstorm but then noticing something�fouler.\nWith a sharp growl and narrowed eyes he identified the scent�Alliance!\nHis toothed mouth again in a snarl he flung the piece of weapon away, it landing, teetering on the edge, then fell towards the depths of the waterfall below.\nIt was the Alliance that had them, that kept Tavatron from returning to the Ark�to him.\n\nHe now knew what had happened, piecing together the evidence in which this lofty cliff supported. Even finding more on his way up half of the rock formation.\nAfter the negotiations they had been returning when three Alliance members jumped them, obviously rendering them unconscious. But what of their bodies.\nSince there was little fluid about it was evident that they had not been destroyed, then the notion of being taken came into his mind.\nDinobot pondered over the possibility of the Alliance taking Tavatron and the other as a captive, for some negotiate purposes in which involved the Maximals.\nThe thought was interesting, devious, and well planned.\nThen it was obvious that Zardus had his motives, well thought out and strategically well organized.\nAs much as he now wanted to hear the satisfying snap of his clawed hands breaking the Alliance commanders� neck he had to admit, this was a fairly good idea in which the Leader of his enemy had concocted.\nBut NOW was not the time to think of such things, Now was the time to get to work.\nDinobot growled low in his throat as he faced the direction in which the Alliance ship lay, muscles tense and rage building every moment he stood there.\nThere was only one place in which they could have taken them, to their own base. With the defenses and completely intact scanning relays it would make an excellent post to keep two captives, no real hope of escaping�by themselves.\nWith a snarl Dinobot transformed into robot mode, his tail twitching occasionally in annoyance and anger.\nApparently he had to go and get them, but it would be suicide to go alone. He well knew that.\nBut as much as he knew that he would need back-up he did not wish to drag other bots into this situation, lives might be lost.\nBut there was something else that would have bothered him as well if he was aware of it, something that just happened to hit closer to home.\nHe didn�t know it yet, but he cared for her. \nHowever, not fully developed, not enough experience and bullheadedness keeping it welled in the back of his deepest of thoughts.\nBut as Dinobot stood there he seemed not able to think of such things the Alliance might be doing to Tavatron at this moment, the thought just to horrid for his mind at the time.\nHowever, the simple need to free her from whatever peril she was now in was the strongest feeling�the thought of back up emerging in his mind once again.\nDinobot growled as he opened his come link, if not he wanted back-up he knew that there was one bot in which had the RIGHT to be informed of the situation. (Does not know that Tigerhawk was back and not that the Ark is under attack.)\nWith an extremely serious tone he spoke, still gazing off in the direction of the Alliance base. *\n\n� Prowl, THIS is Dinobot. If you have not already noticed, neither Tavatron NOR Iron Raptor had returned from negotiations with Bronco�I now know the reason: I have EXTREME reason to believe that the Alliance has captured them. If there is any doubt in your mind of my words then come to my location, Grid Zark, and your doubts shall be relieved.�\n\n* With that he then simply waited for the fowls reaction, not knowing just how much time he could waste waiting. There were now two lives at stake; waiting was not much of an option. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
