Internal \nsystems were already starting to compensate, rerouting his scanning \nsystems to his sense of smell.\n\n&quot;If you wanna help then just point me in the direction of the nearest \nfunctional Predicon, that one learned the hard way not to frag with a \nwolf.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She emerged from the chamber fully healed.

She called out to him, &quot;Lunarpine, You \n&gt; alright?&quot; She flew to his side and transformed into bot mode.  She \n&gt; could see that his optics were damaged.  She grabbed his hand and \nput \n&gt; it on her shoulder,&quot;I&#39;ll be your seeing eye owl.&quot; She drew her \ndagger \n&gt; with her good hand and threw it at Ares.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine falls back in an immense amount of pain, he&#39;d stopped \n&gt; Ares \n&gt; &gt; from doing more harm, unfortunately the cost was 92% of his \noptical \n&gt; &gt; scanners. he no longer could see any details around him. just \n&gt; shapes \n&gt; &gt; and blurs of movement.his olfactory sensors were still \nfunctioning \n&gt; &gt; though after that last shot he yook he didn&#39;t know for how long, \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine transformed to wolf mode and used his sense of smell to \n&gt; &gt; head toward the ark. he was prepared to attack anything that got \n&gt; &gt; between him and the ark. he just hoped that it wasn&#39;t Maximal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lunarpine to maximals I&#39;ve taken heavy damage and need some \ncover \n&gt; &gt; fire. if you&#39;re close identify yourself, I don&#39;t want to avoid \nany \n&gt; &gt; friendly fire situations if I can.&quot; Lunarpines warning could be \n&gt; heard \n&gt; &gt; from both sides. he just hoped the enemy was to bust with the \nother \n&gt; &gt; Maximals to bother him.
