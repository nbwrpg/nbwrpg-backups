He walked \nup to her.\n&gt;    \n&gt;        &quot;I&#39;ve recovered from my wounds love.  Tell me, who was that?\n(Referring to KitKat)&quot; Orchestra asked.\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Composer went into the old Alliance base, and brought back \nan old, CR Chamber, and sat it on the ground.\n&gt;    \n&gt;        &quot;Yup, we&#39;re almost done,&quot; he said in reply to Wheeljack.\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Skullgrin arrived back at the base after a while.  He saw \nthe battle between Motormaster and Megatron.  This was obviously a \nbattle to decide who would be leader.  Skullgrin transformed to robot \nmode.\n&gt;    \n&gt;        &quot;MEGATRON!!!  Leader, it&#39;s you!!  Forget Motormaster, let&#39;s \ngo Megatron!!!!  I&#39;ve always been loyal to you!!&quot; Skullgrin cheered.\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Triggerhappy arrived quickly in his jet mode.  He landed \nand transformed to robot mode as well.  He didn;t say anything, his \njaw dropped as far as a transformer can drop their jaw.  Megatron!  \nWhat a great but also scary sight!\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Cutthroat arrived at the base.  He landed and transformed \nback to robot mode.\n&gt;    \n&gt;          &quot;Megatron and Motormaster here!  Me want fight!!!!!!&quot; \nCutthroat sneered.\n&gt;    \n&gt;           Cutthroat drew his weapon and fired a shot at Megatron \nthen at Motormaster.\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Quatro kept going in hoverbike mode until he found the \nMaximal base.  He stopped and transformed into robot mode.\n&gt;    \n&gt;          &quot;Transformer Faction:Maximals\n&gt;           Maximal Warship:Cybertronian Fire\n&gt;           Status:Crashed, Housing Maximals,&quot; Quatro said out some \ndata he found on the Maximals and there base.\n&gt;    \n&gt;            Quatro searched for more information on the Maximals, \ntheir enemies in particular.\n&gt;    \n&gt;            *General Maximal Enemies:Predacons,Decepticons* Quatro&#39;s \nresults stated.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;            *Some Specific Enemies:Hell Beast,Megatron,Drill Bit, \nKillfest, Darkfate* \n&gt;    \n&gt;            Quatro looked up info on Megatron.\n&gt;    \n&gt;             *Megatron:Decepticon Commander*\n&gt;    \n&gt;             Quatro was puzzled for 2 milliseconds, but then looked \nback up on the deceased Megatron he had scanned out.\n&gt;    \n&gt;             *Megatron:Predacon Commander*\n&gt;    \n&gt;             &quot;Hmm,&quot; Quatro thought to himself,&quot;I should be able to \nget just as good a reward for killing Megatron of the Decepticons as \nif I killed Megatron of the Predacons.  Ha!  For now, I should side \nwith these Maximals.  I may be able to collect more specific \npropaganda on my bounty.&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt;              Quatro searched his endless collection of data for the \nleader of these Maximals.\n&gt;    \n&gt;               *Faction Leader:Iron Raptor*\n&gt;    \n&gt;               Quatro opened a special communications link with Iron \nRaptor.(He doesn&#39;t need no special wrist device or anything, he has a \nspecial device planted inside of him, so he can talk like normal \nexcept over long distances and when he is engaged in a long distance \nconversation his eyes glow blue instead of green)\n&gt;    \n&gt;              &quot;Iron Raptor, leader of the Maximals, I am universal \nbounty hunter Quatro, and I came to Earth to kill Hell Beast and \nMegatron.  I was thinking that I could side with you for a while, and \nwe may be able to help eachother,&quot; Quatro said.\n&gt;   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Decapitron, Legtrap, Headshot, Gutclaw and Explobody \narrived back at the base.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;          &quot;It&#39;s Megatron!
