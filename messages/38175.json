We&#39;ve changed \nthe way this will run a little from last election, but it about 90% the \nsame. The new council will come into effect July 2, two months \nafter the first election. We require the following things from \ncanidates and supporters:\n\n1) If you wish to run:\n\tYou must find three people who support your running for \t\t\n\tcouncil.\n\n2) Email the council with those three supporters. Copy-paste the \t\n\tfollowing into the send field: \n\nrauq@..., yanshosh@..., TMRattrap@..., \nAlloran2@...\n\n3) Make sure the people who you mark down as supporters email \n\tthe council as well saying that they support you, and anyone \t\n\telse that they are supporting.\n\n4) If you&#39;re running, you can only support two people. If you&#39;re not \t\n\trunning, you can support three people.\n\n5) If you send $20 to each current council member, we will hook \t\n\tyou up. =) (wellll, maybe not... but please do send us \t\t\t\n\tmoney!)\n\nA slight difference from last election. This time we will elect two \nnew council members (instead of three). One council memeber \n(other than Yanshosh) will remain on the council. That member will \nbe chosen through a second poll. \n\n\n\t~NBWRPG Council\n\n"}}
