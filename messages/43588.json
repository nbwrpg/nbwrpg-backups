Apparently it can be used to \nupgrade other bots.  Also it exists in both Optimus and Ultra somehow \nalthough Omega wouldn&#39;t know this because my story says that Omega \ncame from their demision right after they fused the first time. So do \nyou approve.  I just wanted to keep everyone informed about the \nTransformers: Robots in Disguise storyline.\n\n\n"}}
