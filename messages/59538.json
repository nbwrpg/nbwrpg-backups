As for your idea Malice, we need to make sure\n&gt; that the theory about Unicron is correct. If it is\n&gt; then destryoing him here would have minimal effect on\n&gt; our timeline. In short, we need more information\n&gt; before we can decide on a strategy. I must commune\n&gt; with Primus.

If we\n&gt; &gt; harness enough energy, and we catch him off guard,\n&gt; &gt; we could shove him back through the rift.  Then all\n&gt; &gt; we would have to do is seal the instablility.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He was worked up, the plan would work... if a few\n&gt; &gt; things happened right.  One, securing a large enough\n&gt; &gt; energy supply for Malice, two, a way to get energy\n&gt; &gt; to Malice, and three, get energy from said bounty\n&gt; &gt; hunter to the repulser.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Please!
