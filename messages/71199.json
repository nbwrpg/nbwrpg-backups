Aw maan, fine time to be without Tucson..\n\nQuickstride looks to her.\n\n&quot;Hey, I&#39;ll be okay for a while, why don&#39;t you go check up on your brother?&quot;\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;Thank you Quickstride, I&#39;ll take Elita with me.&quot;\n\nShe now walks into the stasis area, where Tucson had gone to rest.  He \nlooked quite peaceful laying there, yet, he appeared to be stirring \nsomewhat.\n\n&quot;Wait a minute, he&#39;s stirring, that means he&#39;s coming around.  That can&#39;t \nbe, he&#39;s supposed to rest for a longer period of time than that.  What the \npit&#39;s bringing him out of... I bet he didn&#39;t turn off his com link, that&#39;s \nwhat.  C&#39;mon Elita, we better go see why your Uncle Tucson is cutting his \nstasis time a little short.&quot;\n\nTucson opens his eyes, and with a quiet sigh, he sits up on the table.\nStraight Shot eyes him and clears her throat.\n\n&quot;Ahem!  You do realize you have not rested for the ample amount of time it \ntakes to repair your systems right?&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot; I know.  And you&#39;re right, I left my com link on.  I&#39;m all right though, I \nthink I&#39;ve rested for a reasonable amount of time, just enough to get \nthrough our next crisis.  With most of our comrades in stasis, Rodimus is \ngoing to need substantial assistance&quot;\n\nHe now gets on his feet.  Straight Shot tries to stop him.\n\n&quot;Wait, maybe it&#39;s not such a hot idea.  You need your rest.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, really.  Is that Elita with you? I can hear her.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot chuckles.\n\n&quot;Nothing gets past your audio sensors.  It sure is.  Lemme guess, you wanna \nhold her right?&quot;\n\nHe nodds.  And is soon given Elita as he holds her gently in his own arms. \nStraight Shot smiles as he holds her.  He sits back down with Straight Shot.\n\n&quot;You know, I think you and Talon would make excellent parents.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles as he gets up again, and slowly walks out of the room with \nStraight Shot beside him, holding Elita in his arms.\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll see about that..  Right now I think she would really like to see her \nfather.  Uncle Tucson can&#39;t take all the attention away from your dad.&quot;\n\nHe gently rubs her head, and enters the room where Rodimus is.\n\n&quot; I know what you&#39;ll tell me, and you&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t be out of stasis \njust yet, but, I couldn&#39;t help thinking about what would happen if I wasn&#39;t \nthere to lend you support.  Oh, and I thought you might want to say hello to \nElita.&quot;\n\nHe smiles as he holds her close to Rodimus, waiting for him to hold her.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PErceptor scanned Nighlight and said &quot;Her body is all right, she can\n&gt; fuction by herself as soon as we bring her back her coma... it&#39;s the mind\n&gt; that worry me&quot;and add dryly&quot;this will be your part of the job, Rodimus: \n&gt; when\n&gt; I remove the stasis, she will awake and you will be there... I want to \n&gt; check\n&gt; her reaction to... Someone that she is attached of; if all works all \n&gt; right,\n&gt; she will remember you and we can evaluate her mind... In the worse case\n&gt; scenario, we have to subdue her and set her in statis one more time... I\n&gt; dont like that idea, but is for her own safely and ours&quot;a d he added &quot;Tell\n&gt; when you are ready&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus, who had not taken his optics off of Nightlight since he had \n&gt; entered\n&gt; the room just nodded to Perceptor. He sat down next to Nightlight, placing\n&gt; his hands on one of hers, taking it into his own.\n&gt;\n&gt; His face was both sad and yet concerned. Would she know him or remember \n&gt; him?\n&gt; It was as if an eternity had passed since they had really been able to \n&gt; spend\n&gt; any time together. The last time he had seen her she really had not\n&gt; remembered him, at least not completely. He wondered now if he would be \n&gt; any\n&gt; help at all. But he knew that no matter what, he would be here for her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride heads to Rodimus but is careful not to be too noisy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sir, Straight Shot and I are working in Tucson&#39;s lab now, and before we\n&gt; can start, we need to get a geographical layout of the surrounding\n&gt; parameter. It appears we need a high peak of some sort to carry the weight\n&gt; of the wind mill structure. It would hide the device from harm, and\n&gt; basically keep the environment the same without harming it. I&#39;m going to\n&gt; send some mini probes out there to photograph the area. Once I get those\n&gt; back, I&#39;ll be able to draw up something.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Please keep in mind that Tuscon&#39;s old lab and Wheeljack&#39;s room will \n&gt; be\n&gt; sized for full sized TF&#39;s. Tuscon and the rest have all been resized /\n&gt; reformatted for BW&#39;s sized characters. They will be much too small for \n&gt; most\n&gt; of the tools to be used easily.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded to Straight Shot but continued to look at Nightlight. &quot;Do\n&gt; what you can.&quot; He said to her. &quot;Check with Legacy if you need any\n&gt; assistance.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A call came in over his radio from Night Shift, and he sent back a quick\n&gt; response. He glanced over at Ramulus, &quot;Nightshift and Rat Trap are looking\n&gt; for Cheetor. See who is available to give them a hand.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus nodded as he turned to leave the room. He glanced at Straight shot \n&gt; .\n&gt; . .\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus on the other hand looked at Perceptor and nodded, &quot;I am ready. He\n&gt; turned to face his wife again, all thoughts of the missions and the Ark as\n&gt; he was concerned for her.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
