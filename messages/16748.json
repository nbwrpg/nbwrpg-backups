Remembering she shining place that he was really destined to be, the \nMatrix.\nThe more he remembered about his journey to the Matrix the more he realized \nsomething, important.\nWhich he unconsciously spoke out loud�**\n\n� Life is not appreciated until one no longer has it��\n\n** But even his metallic lips moved to the words, the real impact was within \nhimself.\nIt was all a lie. For him, once he had had it, he didn�t want to go back.\nHis previous life still haunted him, and locked him in the same attitude and \nways he remembered before.\nNothing had changed about him, other then his appearance.\nDinobot had at least thought that it would be different this time, that his \nspark wouldn�t be locked in the same shard of ice as before.\nThat he might be able to have a proper sense of life, learn to have fun like \neveryone else, maybe even learn to love.\nBut NO!\nHe was the same sparkless slag as he was before, and nothing, NOTHING had \nchanged.\nDinobot slammed his, now balled, fists into the scales of Necroamncer, his \neyes clenched shut in utter disappointment, shame and hate.\nHe wasn�t supposed to be here, not alive and breathing! He was supposed to \nbe in the Matrix, nothing more then a lost memory in this world. A story \ntold to others when asked, just a tale.\nBut NO!\nHe had been cheated! Tricked into believing that there was something beyond \nthis life, into believing that there really was a place for honored warriors \nlike he was to finally rest and disappear into oblivion.\nHis deed of saving the humans was worth THIS?!\nLeaving to journey to the Matrix, only to be forced back and to live again?!\nIt wasn�t fair, it wasn�t right!\nDinobot suddenly got to his feet in one abrupt movement, bit head snapping \ntowards the dimming stars with a roar of complete rage.**\n\n� What sort of SICK joke is THIS?!!�\n\n** He had been steaming over this ever since he had merged with this \ntransmehal 2 body, ever since he had returned.\nHe had lied to himself over and over again that it was great to be alive \nagain, when all he really wanted was to simply rest in peace!\nHe hadn�t returned to Earth willingly, even though he had never reached the \nMatrix.\nSomething had drove him back against his will, and now he was here fighting \nthe same slaging war that he had helped create.\nIt wasn�t fair!\nDinobots silver fangs gleamed in the dying star and moonlight, his sides \nheaving in the deep breaths he took.\nHis rage was rising again, and thus his pulse was speeding up.**\n\n� You brought me back here! WHY?!!!�\n\n** He was hoping that the Matrix, the very thing that he was question to \nfind, would hear his roars of rage.\nNot caring if a bot in this world thought he was crazy for speaking to the \nsky, though he knew for a fact that it heard him.\nEven though he didn�t know it, maybe the reason that he was always so \ninjured after battles was because he was secretly hoping that he would die \nagain.\nBut it wouldn�t even be half as honorable as his past death, the very death \nthat was supposed to grant him into the Matrix.\nBut even as he glared into the heavens, there was no answer.\nSimply silence�and the light flaps of a dragons wings.\nDinobot growled sharply and bowed his head, his clawed hands digging into \ntheir fists. Mech-fluid spilling and splattering onto the scales of \nNecromancer.\nHis silver face completely shrouded in shadow, only the red slits of his \neyes visible.\nIt wasn�t fair!\nAnd he was the one paying for it!**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
