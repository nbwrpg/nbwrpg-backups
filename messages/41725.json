She sat up in the \nchair and rubbed the moisture from her face. She had been haviing \nnightmares about her death and reanimation experience. She stod up \nand looked around.  She sighed and sat back down in the chair. &quot;Yeah, \nI&#39;ll get you Megatron. You sent me to my death and I was fortunate to \ncome back. Now it&#39;s my turn to send you to the Matrix.&quot; muttered to \nherself.  She paced the room a few mintues and tried to calm down. \nShe finally relaxed enough to try to sleep some more. She sat back in \nthe chair and closed her optics.  She snoozed for a while, but had \nfitful dreams.  She changed into mouse mode in her sleep and curled \nup in the chair. Her tail tucked in under her leg, her whiskers \ntwitching. \n\n\n"}}
