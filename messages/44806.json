What \ndo you think of playing on a colony instead of Cybertron. Cybertron \nseems all good and everything, but there are some general guidelines \nwe&#39;d have to follow.

I reacted that way I think \nbecause I&#39;m still upset about the death of NBMSSO. But then again, \nit&#39;s death may have brought for the life of DBZSF, since it made me \nspend more time on it. I&#39;m still actually one of the only ones in the \nRPG who prefers to do more talking than fighting, like what goes on in \nDBZSF.

I&#39;m in a MUSH, that takes place solely on \nCybertron.  And \n&gt;   it is way better than the NBW.  Cybertron would just require lots \nof \n&gt;   thinking.  Like the millions if not billions of civilians that \nwould be on \n&gt;   the planet, and since all we do in this RPG is fight we&#39;d have to \ntake that \n&gt;   into account.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Because most factions in the NBW have, if they&#39;re big, 20 \ncharacters, and 20 \n&gt;   characters would mean jack crap compared to a population of \nmillions or \n&gt;   billions.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
