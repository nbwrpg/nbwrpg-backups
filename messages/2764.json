But she had to hide it. She had been ever since she came sliding into the Arc. She wasn&#39;t going to give up now that the Big Tank of a rhino gave her secret away. She would keep her talent of imitation&nbsp;up.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Female?&quot; she said to Rhinox. &quot;Rhinox, my dear friend,&nbsp;why would you have any doubt about me and mistake me for a female.&nbsp;I am myself, Rhinox, do not worry.&quot; This was confusing as slag, but she had to manage. She always had. She was intellegent like her male double. Maybe he could smell her female scent just a little, and may be able to see the stressed darks under her eyes. &quot;What happened to&nbsp;Optimus? Don&#39;t&nbsp;tell me he was killed.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;No longer on his planet, she recalled.&nbsp;That sounded a little like he was&nbsp;in the Matrix.&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
