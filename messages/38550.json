The rpg isn&#39;t a side scroller video game where \nthe winner is the one who presses the button the most times. \nHopefully, the rpg is for acting out the personae of characters and \nhaving fun. If we all just tried to kill each other, then we (probably) \nwouldn&#39;t be having fun. Don&#39;t play by who is the strongest is the \nwinner. If so, you&#39;ve then effectively defeated the purpose.\n\n\n\nOn 29 Jun 2001, at 19:10, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Big words for a small team.
