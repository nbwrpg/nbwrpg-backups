Now he was really \ngetting nervous. He couldn&#39;t find Tarantulas or Black Arachnia. He \nwas getting a bad feeling.\n\nHatred appeared on his face. He bolted down the cooridor. Hell Beast \ncould have done something to them. He haulted, the sharp ridges at \nthe bottom of his feet lightly screeching. He looked around, getting \nanxious. \n\nHe opened his comm-link to Tarantulas&#39; and Black Arachnia&#39;s \nfrequency, &quot;Hey, where are y&#39;all? Somebody answer.&quot; If they didn&#39;t, \nhe was going to find Hell Beast.\n\n\n"}}
