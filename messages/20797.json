Cya all tomorrow.\n\n\n::Zardus::\n\nSeeing that no one had any questions, Zardus continues, opening his \nmouth before recieving Astral&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;Ah, excellent,&quot; he replies, &quot;If you could report to my position, \nright outside the Iron Fist, there is an attack going on soon, and \nlots of chance at destruction.&quot;\n\nHe turns back to the bots, continuing with his plan.\n\n&quot;The platform needs to be destroyed, and there are more than enough \nbots available here to do that. The Maximals might attack the \nPredacon base itself, and if they do, and we&#39;re successful at the \nplatform, we will attack after the Maximals retreat.&quot;\n\nThe hologram zooms out again, showing a view of the eastern \nhemisphere. &quot;Both the Predacon base and the platform are closer to \nthe Iron Fist. In case the Predacons are allied with the other groups \nof Preds, and they decide to attack here, there will be more than \nenough time to get back to base.&quot;\n\nHe looks around at the bots, &quot;I think its best to attack at the \nplatform, destroy it, and then go on to the Predacon base, if the \nMaximals arn&#39;t done with it.&quot;\n\nHe pauses, recieving the transmission from Koj&#39;s beacon. He frowns, \nlistening to it.\n\n&quot;It seems that the other Predacons are against us as well, so if they \nstart marching at the Iron Fist, the Alliance attacking forces will \nhave to either intercept them or return to base.&quot;\n\nHe looks at the bots around him, realizing Deemos&#39; group wasn&#39;t there \nyet.\n\n&quot;Deemos,&quot; he says, opening a channel to the bot, &quot;Can you and your \ngroup report to my position? I&#39;ll need you for this next mission.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
