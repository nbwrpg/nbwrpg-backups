It \nwasn&#39;t going to be easy but she would make sure that it was done, and right \nas well.\nBut as she thought about that ship she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what prowl \nwas up to and what he was doing at the moment, hoping that he was alright.\nThe last she had seen of him was running out to defend the ship with \nKluster, and she hadn&#39;t seen him since.\nShe just hoped he was OK.*\n\n________________________:)\n\nZyber:\n\n* The opening to her den was just to her right, hidden under the snow \ncovered branches of a pine that grew just outside the enterance.\nIt had taken her nearly three mega-cycles just to get this far, and if she \nhadn&#39;t had this stasis locked bot on her back she would have only been 1 \nhour instead.\nShe staggered into the confines of her den and looked around, noting that it \nwas more dusty then she had left it and needed to be cleaned.\nBut, first she had to get this bot off her back and she wasn&#39;t about to just \nleave him on the floor.\nZyber begin to slowly move towards the back of her cave where there was a \nsmaller one, one that she liked to call her bed chamber.\nIt took her a good 5 mins to get to the opening of the second cave, looking \naround and finding just the place she had planned to set him.\nIt was a raised platform of rock with a bit of a dip in the middle, even \nfurs placed along and over it to make quite a place to sleep on cold winter \nnights.\nShe finally made it over to her furs and then tilted her back, the great \nbulk of DeathSkyth ( don&#39;t mind if I spelled it wrong, please) sliding from \nher back and her sighing in relief.\nZyber hopped off the furs and quickly transformed into robot mode, moving \nthe great beast so that he would be more comfortable when he awoke.\nThen she quickly created a small fire in the center of the room so that it \nwould no longer be cold, and a stasis locked bot could always benifit from \nheat while damamged.\nOnce the fire was alight and moved from the room and began to tidy up her \nden a bit while she got a few things ready for DeathSkyth.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
