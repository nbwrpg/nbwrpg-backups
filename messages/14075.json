She \nstarted to spit up fluid.  She found out just how much she hated the \ntaste of mech fluid.  She looked up at Testifier, who had a gun \npointed at her.  She spoke in a soft voice and her breathing became \nmore labored. &quot;She is dead.  She walked over to the maximals and \nsurrendered.  They were.  &quot;she breaths for a moment,&quot; they were going \nto torture her.  They were going to make her suffer in ways \nunmaginable.&quot;she breaths and couchs,&quot; I couldn&#39;t let them do that to \nmy friend.  I couldn&#39;t let them hurt her.  I wasn&#39;t going to let them \ncause her any more pain.&quot; She starts to cry and whine in wolf \nmode. &quot;Time Bomb had died.  We had lost a friend, but she had her \nspark broken.  The Maximals attacked and demanded her.  I tried to \nsave her, but she sacrificed herself over to them. &quot;coughs and spits \nup some more mech fluid. &quot;they were going to torture her and make her \nsuffer.  They wanted her to know pain in ways that are unknown to \nPredacon.  I will kill an enemy, never torture. &quot;she groans in pain \nand agony.&quot;I couldn&#39;t let that happen. She was my friend.  I cared \nfor her like a little sister.  She was my friend.  I tried to save \nher.  I tried.  Then she sacraficed her self and left me with no \nchoice.  They were going to torture her.  I had no choice. No choice. \nI had to do it.  It was the only way.  I couldn&#39;t let her suffer.&quot;\nShe groaned and transformed into bot mode. She grabbed at her belly \nand doubled over in pain.  She got up on her knees and looked at all \nthe holes in her body.  She closed her eyes and hoped she could get \nto a CR chamber soon.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Ha! Like we&#39;d believe that!
