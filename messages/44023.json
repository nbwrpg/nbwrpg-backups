(an please refrain from\n&gt; the one line &quot;Bob \n&gt; looks around&quot; type posts :P)\n&gt; \n&gt; Dewboy, LN, The Beam, stop bashing each other nobody\n&gt; wants to hear \n&gt; it. You&#39;re just wasting your time and our time by\n&gt; even posting it. \n&gt; Consider what you post BEFORE you post it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dewboy. To improve your dialogue, read some novels\n&gt; and model your \n&gt; posting after them. You don&#39;t necessarily have to\n&gt; post in paragraph \n&gt; format, just use the dialogue from a novel as an\n&gt; example for what \n&gt; you would write. \n&gt; (Background for those who haven&#39;t read this: it&#39;s a\n&gt; dystopia where \n&gt; one person controls all of the negative and postive\n&gt; memories of a \n&gt; entire &quot;utopian&quot; community. It&#39;s an interesting\n&gt; book, and i recomend \n&gt; it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ie: (i&#39;ll quote a little from The Giver by Lois\n&gt; Lowery, then change \n&gt; it)\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Giver,&quot; he asked one afternoon following a day when\n&gt; he had been \n&gt; sent away, &quot;what causes you pain?&quot;\n&gt;   &quot;When the Giver was silent, Jonas continued. &quot;Ther\n&gt; Chief Elder \n&gt; told me, at the beginning, that the receiving of\n&gt; memory causes \n&gt; terrible pain. And you described for me that the\n&gt; failure of the last \n&gt; new Receiver released painful memories to the\n&gt; community.\n&gt;   &quot;But I haven&#39;t suffered, Giver. Not really.&quot; Jonas\n&gt; smiled &quot;Oh, I \n&gt; remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first\n&gt; day. But that \n&gt; wasn&#39;t so terrible. What is it that makes you suffer\n&gt; so much? If you \n&gt; gave some of it to me maybe your pain would be\n&gt; less.&quot;\n&gt;   The Giver nodded. &quot;Lie down,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s time,\n&gt; I suppose. I \n&gt; can&#39;t shield you forever. You&#39;ll have to take it all\n&gt; on eventually.\n&gt;   &quot;Let me think,&quot; he went on, when Jonas was on the\n&gt; bed, waiting, a \n&gt; little fearful.\n&gt;   &quot;All right,&quot; The Giver said after a moment, &quot;I&#39;ve\n&gt; decided. We&#39;ll \n&gt; start with something familiar. Let&#39;s go once again\n&gt; to a hill, and a \n&gt; sled.&quot;\n&gt;   He placed his hands on Jonas&#39;s back.\n&gt; ----------&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The above was simply an exerpt form The Giver. Now\n&gt; i&#39;ll switch the \n&gt; style and write a little transformer dialogue\n&gt; between say Lokk and \n&gt; Axis who are scouting a Predacon operation where\n&gt; three Preds are \n&gt; loading up a crate of something.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lokk,&quot; murmured Axis, &quot;Lokk!&quot; He nudges Lokk with\n&gt; his elbow, &quot;Look \n&gt; at what they are carrying.\n&gt;   &quot;Hmmm,&quot; thinks Lokk, &quot;It looks like explosives in\n&gt; boxes,&quot; he \n&gt; observes as the trio of Preds slowly and gently move\n&gt; the large crate \n&gt; towards they&#39;re transport.\n&gt;   Axis&#39;s eyes change colour as a magnification lense\n&gt; slides over his \n&gt; optics. &quot;I see some characters written on the\n&gt; crate... I see, an, A, \n&gt; an S, and U, and an S. Then there&#39;s a space, and A,\n&gt; a 7, an M, and \n&gt; another space, then a C, a P, and a U. Do you have\n&gt; any idea what \n&gt; that means?&quot; says Axis as he continues to watch.\n&gt;   Lokk frowns and pieces the letters together in his\n&gt; head, &lt;&lt; A-S-U-\n&gt; S__A-7-M__C-P-U... that sounds like computer\n&gt; equipment to \n&gt; me.&gt;&gt; &quot;Axis, I think that they have some new\n&gt; computer equipment or \n&gt; something. We might be able to capture it and bring\n&gt; it back to base. \n&gt; We have the element of surprise.&quot;\n&gt;   Axis nods, &quot;Yah, I think that we can do it, but\n&gt; we&#39;ll need Seekker \n&gt; as well.&quot; He looks at Lokk who nods.\n&gt;   &quot;Alright.&quot; Lokk opens an encrypted commlink to\n&gt; Seekker, &quot;Seekker, \n&gt; we need you, what is your position?&quot;\n&gt; ---------&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another simple way to write the same thing is the\n&gt; following:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------&gt;\n&gt; Axis: &quot;Lokk. Lokk! Look at what they are carrying.&quot;\n&gt; Axis nudges Lokk with is shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lokk: &quot;Hmmm, looks like explosives to me.&quot;\n&gt; Lokk continues to watch the three Preds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Axis&#39; eyes change colour as a magnification lense\n&gt; slides over his \n&gt; optics. \n&gt; Axis: &quot;I see some characters written on the crate...\n&gt; I see, an, A, \n&gt; an S, and U, and an S. Then there&#39;s a space, and A,\n&gt; a 7, an M, and \n&gt; another space, then a C, a P, and a U. Do you have\n&gt; any idea what \n&gt; that means?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lokk frowns and thinks about the lettering.\n&gt; Lokk: &quot;Axis, I think that they have some new\n&gt; computer equipment or \n&gt; something. We might be able to capture it and bring\n&gt; it back to base. \n&gt; We have the element of surprise.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Axis nods in agreement.\n&gt; Axis: &quot;We&#39;ll need Seekker&#39;s help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lokk also nods, and opens an encrypted commlink to\n&gt; Seekker\n&gt; Lokk: &quot;Seekker, we need you, what is your position?&quot;\n&gt; ---------&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you hadn&#39;t already realized it, all of what i&#39;ve\n&gt; been writing is \n&gt; straight from the Rules page, but with a different\n&gt; example.\n&gt; \n&gt; I already explained this to you before you were\n&gt; moderated as well, \n&gt; so you should look back in the posts and read that\n&gt; post as well. \n&gt; Also, reread the rules several times until what you\n&gt; know for sure \n&gt; that you can create a character or make anything up\n&gt; that won&#39;t piss \n&gt; someone (or anyone... or everyone) off. =P\n&gt; \n&gt; Another word of advice: NEVER write a dialogue\n&gt; before hand and \n&gt; expect to use it IC. It doesn&#39;t really work. Think\n&gt; of this: A static \n&gt; mind will never solve a dynamic problem. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; And for god&#39;s sake, let all of my typing that is\n&gt; trying to go to \n&gt; help you, go to waste... like before... =(\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
