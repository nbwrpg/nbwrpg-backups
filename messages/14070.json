The crisp smell\nof the nights frost reached her nose as she rose over a bluff, her paws \nmaking no sound as she padded along.\nZyber was indeed ready to reach the warm caress of her den and settle down \nafter such a long trek, her joints stiff and sore as well as her muscles \nstrained and ready for rest.\nShe stopped at the top of the bluff and shook the night frost from her fur, \na sudden scent reaching her snout.\nIt was strange to her, this new scent.\nShe lowered her snout to the ground and began to follow it, thinking to \nherself that she recognized this new scent but couldn�t quite place it.\nIt wasn�t long before Zyber finally found just what the scent \nwas�mech-fluid. Stale and old, but the next thing that she saw was the \nsource of the fluid and she shook her head at the sight.\nOnly a few yards away lay a bot in stasis lock ( I�m not sure if DeathSkyth \nis in beast mode and I�m sorry that I spelled his name wrong.)\nZyber walked over to the bot slowly but kept her distance for a moment \nbefore finally coming up beside him, her head low as she studied just how \ndamaged he was.\nWell, if she didn�t know anything else then she knew that he was far enough \ninto stasis lock to be near death and needed help quickly if he was to \nsurvive.\nHer head lifted for a moment as she began to think of a proper way to get \nhim back to her den, and just what she needed to tend to him once she got \nthere.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
