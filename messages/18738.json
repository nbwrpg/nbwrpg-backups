I just didn&#39;t show off by using them all right at \nthe start. As for the attack post it lacked basic logic Number 1 a lance \ndistance is at max 6ft a Missile Blast Raduis is about 10ft and lets not say \nwhat a grenades is. So unless you threw the lance at my throat your in your \nown blast zone and if memory is running right all your fighters behind me \nshot exploding or spread radius weapons((Fireballs)) so there is back blast. \nSo when Koj cut off his thrusters and dropped there attacks weren&#39;t seekers \nso the would have continued straight at Prebon sense you stationed him in \nfront Koj.\n\n                             ::Weapons School::\nAlso a lance thrust like that is sloppy at close range lances are staff type \nweapons and easy to parry by a well prepared fighter or one in a ((Defensive \nstance)) if not handled better or with more Knowledge of Lancer tactics. A \nthrust like the type you used would only be effective in a rushing attack by \nyou or if your enemy charged you. Lances are more skill type weapons than \nsword slash and gash weapons that why Koj fighters like a dancer with the \nFang. ((This is not trying to be a smart ass or pick a fight but just basic \ncombat and tactics.))\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
