Rage starts boiling up inside him. He knows what&#39;s \nhappening. He tries to hang on to his Maximal loyalty, but this time \nit&#39;s too strong. Brix begins to fade away.....and Bronco takes over.\n\n&quot;YES!!!!!!!! I&#39;m back, and without that damned loyalty. When the \nfight is over, That other will take over again, so I&#39;ve got to do \nthis. Where&#39;s that bot who woke up the other? I remember reading \nsomething about him becoming a fox....&quot;\n\nBronco looks over around the battle field and sees Fliq trying to \nattack Oinker.\n\n&quot;Hahahaha!!! Now it&#39;s your turn to die!&quot;\n\nBonco pulls out his rocket launcher and fires two right at Fliq.\n\n\n"}}
