I promised Rodimus Prime that if he needed me, \n&gt; I&#39;d be there, and before he ever fell into the depths of no return, I&#39;d be \n&gt; sure that my hand was down there to reach his and pull him up from the \n&gt; point of no return.  I will not back away from my promise to him.  I feel \n&gt; as if this is something that my extra power was meant to do.  I can&#39;t \n&gt; explain it really, but something else is within me, a power I can not \n&gt; describe.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He puts a hand on Talon&#39;s and he puts it to his chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Talon, do you feel that?  It&#39;s a power I can not describe, but it&#39;s here, \n&gt; and there&#39;s plenty of it to share.  And more than enough for you as well.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
