Though, I don&#39;t receive all e-mails, because eGroups kind \nof sucks, and it has happened before.\n\nLuna, side is obviously where ribs would be, not the thigh.  And it makes a \ndifference by the way.  If I hit you in the thigh, wow.  Hit you in the side, \nit hurts more and does more damage.  And I never said it would take you down, \nI&#39;d be surprised it if took you down!  It&#39;s just you did something stupid by \ncharge like an idiot, and I took advantage of it.  I&#39;m not whining, I&#39;m \ntelling you.  Post for the correct damage.  I&#39;m getting tired of all the \nidiots out there that don&#39;t do that. By the way Serpentor shot the plasma \nlauncher off at Luna&#39;s chest.\n\nWhy haven&#39;t I responded to Ice&#39;s attack?  I did!  The energy ball only \ntouched his foot and he shot off four bolts at Ice&#39;s chest is what I \nresponded with as well.  You want me to forward you the e-mail?)\n\n\nL. Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
