Unless you want to talk to flunkies, \nwe will not be going to your ship.  Zardus has disappeared.  He&#39;ll be back \nsoon though&gt;\n\n&quot;Follow me.&quot; Nemesis told Delta, heading back for the Alliance base.\n\n===\n\nRamhorn heard Archangle&#39;s transmission.  He sighed.  &quot;What a total retard!&quot;\n\n---\n\nKluster recieved Archangle&#39;s com transmission.  Kluster sighed, immediately \nactivating his com unit in his left wrist.  \n\n&lt;This is Kluster, to all Maximals.  I am currently in charge of the \nCybertronian Fire,  the Maximal craft that crashed onto the planet.  I urge \nyou not to follow this idiot Archangle.  Iron Riptor...or whatever, was \ncaptured?  Well, did you ever stop to think the plot of the people who \ncaptured him is to wait until you make a rescue party, attack, and they will \nattack back?  Or with allies?&gt;\n\nKluster sighed over the com.\n\n&lt;From what I understand, the Ark is in total shambles because you guys can&#39;t \nget your acts together.  We should wait until the Ark and Cybertronian Fire \nare repaired and have strong defenses before we go and attack anyone.  I may \nnot be in charge of the Maximals, but that is merely my opinion.  Rushing off \nto get killed isn&#39;t my idea of a compitent mission&gt;   \n\n"}}
