Also, mixing \nTransformers with Animorphs wouldn&#39;t be a good idea.  It would be fun \nprobably, but Transformers would kick their arses easy.  Oh, Andalite&#39;s have \ntailblades.  Heh, let&#39;s see how well they do against several feet thick of \nCybertronian armor and a big laser rifle.)\n\n"}}
