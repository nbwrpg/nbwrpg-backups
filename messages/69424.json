He suspaces his cross bow over his shou=\r\nlder, as the mechanisms over his back latch it in place. \n\n&quot;Sounds like thi=\r\ns could be important.  I better try to get to the tower, and see what the t=\r\nransmission is about. Sorry cross bow, you&#39;ll have to wait a while&quot;.\n\nWith =\r\nhis sight impaired, he turns to his sonar system atop his helmet, and throw=\r\ns off a sonar wave, which he hoped would bounce off the tower, and back to =\r\nhim, giving Tucson the exact coordinates in which to follow.  He also knew =\r\nthat being on wheels would be faster than trying to go there on foot.  Meta=\r\nl plates soon shift and within moments he is transformed into his vehicular=\r\n mode.  The compact SUV shifts himself into all wheel drive, and slowly rol=\r\nls toward the direction of the tower, which he obtains with sonar system ca=\r\npability.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Attention Maximals&quot; the radios suddenly blared.  &quot;This is Lord\n&gt; Perse=\r\nus, please assemble in front of the tower.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ravenchief and a team of m=\r\naximals pulled a large hovercart toward the tower.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Is that everything=\r\n?&quot; Salveo asked Ravenchief as they aproached the tower.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yessir, fortu=\r\nnately a couple CR chambers and about half our supplies\n&gt; survived the impa=\r\nct.

It had taken three weeks to cle=\r\nar the\n&gt; &gt; rubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a tot=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; loss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\n&gt; &gt; de=\r\nstroyed ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably be\n&gt; &gt; modifi=\r\ned to be used by the loca police.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked =\r\nthe mayor, already knowing the answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.  I&#39;ve come to the conc=\r\nlusion that our presence in the city\n&gt; &gt; merely aggrivates conditions.  Wit=\r\nhout us, this island would become a\n&gt; &gt; much lower priority for our enemies=\r\n.  Though I hope we can continue\n&gt; &gt; our research together; and I promise w=\r\ne will do anything we can to\n&gt; &gt; help the city.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So where will you=\r\n be going?&quot; the mayor asked after a moment of silence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perseus walk=\r\ned to the windows and sighed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We Maximals have been divided for to=\r\no long.  With this Unicronian\n&gt; &gt; threat, and our recent truce with Megatro=\r\nn. it would be apropriate for\n&gt; &gt; us to put our diferences aside and work t=\r\nogether.
