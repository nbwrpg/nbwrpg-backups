She smiled a bit, more out of \nembarressment, than anything. &quot;Uh...your welcome..uh..yeah.&quot;  She \nturned and took a few steps towards a tree where Megatron&#39;s body was \nlaying near.  She looked at the body. She knelt down and looked at \nthe forearms on the body.  She looked at the exposed wiring.  She \nsniffed the scent off the bot. It was that of Megatron. \nShe grabbed her side and winced.  She stood up and looked at Phobia, \nthen turned and looked at Starscream.  &quot;Starscream, I will need you \nhere for a moment.&quot;   She thought about taking the spark out of the \nbody for analysis back at Destructor&#39;s base. &quot;I need the spark out of \nhim.  Just to make sure. I know you can clone a body, right down to \nlittlest wire, but a real spark can never be truely cloned. I need \nthat spark.&quot;\n\nShe smiled again slightly. She chuckled quietly to herself.  She knew \nshe was ingaged to Drillbit, but she couldn&#39;t think it was a noble \ngesture for Destructor to kiss her hand like that.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  &quot;Thank you I look forward to surving you.&quot; He took her hand and \nkissed it..&quot; \n&gt; I will do as you command.&quot; He walked over to the gave.
