The computer-aimed weapon on his right\narm quickly locks onto the two missiles, destroying them both. His\nwrist missile launcher gets a lock on Unitron, firing two signature\nseeking missiles. The missiles reflected the light off of their\nfronts, just as they would reflect most laser blasts.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl spins, slamming the missiles with his large talons as they\napproach, making them explode and char his armor severely. He roars,\nseeing Divebomb diving.\n\nTucking his wings in, Prowl dives as well, gaining on Divebomb thanks\nto his weight, and lashing out with his talons.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/Double\nPunch/Manterror/Injector/Vehement/Sun \n&gt; Crusher/Reflector:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave armed his missile launchers getting a target lock.  &quot;ALL\nHAIL THE \n&gt; NEO DECEPTICON EMPIRE AND PREPARE TO FEEL THE WRATH OF THE EMPEROR! \nEMPEROR \n&gt; SHOCKWAVE!&quot; he intoned loudly enough for many on the battle to hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; The NDE Emperor launched two energy-signature seeking missiles at\nScavenger\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron hovered momentarily in his space fighter mode, knowing\nexactly who \n&gt; would die.  Getting a lock, he launched off two energy-signature\nseeking \n&gt; missiles at Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter flew low in a strafing run, twenty rapid laser blasts\nlancing out \n&gt; at the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch approached the base in his stealth mode, cloaked from\nsensors \n&gt; and view.  He raised his left pincher, firing off two\nenergy-signature \n&gt; seeking missiles at Prowl, the right pincher raising to launch two\nmissiles \n&gt; at the Cybertronian Fire.  While doing this, he launched his\ncyber-bee, \n&gt; Beeline, and ran hard left so he wasn&#39;t in the same place.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror took flight, gaining altitude rapidly.  &quot;It&#39;s payback,\ntraitors!&quot; \n&gt; he screamed, firing down four ion disks (two from each arm).  Two at\nDark \n&gt; One, the two others at the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector raised gradually into the air, raising both stinger missile \n&gt; launchers.  From the left one he fired two missiles at Blades, and\nfrom the \n&gt; right one he fired two missiles at Breakdown&#39;s back.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement hovered, looking at the battle.  &quot;Brotherhood, I detect\nincoming \n&gt; forces.  Arm your weapons, and until these new enemies arrive, lay\nwaste to \n&gt; the bases in the name of Unicron!&quot; he yelled, raising his right fist\nwhich \n&gt; transformed into the shape of a cannon, firing two missiles off at\nthe \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher&#39;s right wrist raised, a cannon attached to it pointed at\nthe CF.  \n&gt; Two fusion blasts erupted from the depths of the weapon heading for\nthe enemy \n&gt; base.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector raised his left wrist, the twin-mounted barrel on it\nlaunching off \n&gt; four missiles (two from each barrel) at the Cybertronian Fire. \n&quot;Prepare for \n&gt; death, heathens.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
