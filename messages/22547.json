I&#39;m on my way back.&quot;\nShe activated the cloaking device on the pod and gained altitude. She \npushed the pod high into the atmosphere and glided up near the \nenvelope.  She sat back and smiled at her work. &quot;Ah yes, a job well \ndone.&quot; Diamond, chuckled and grabbed a small container from the med \nkit under her seat.  She opened it up and spat into it.  It contained \nthe fur and mechfluid from KitKat that her fangs had picked up while \nbiting her. The mech fluid and fur contained her DNA. She was \npleased. She was one who liked to keep something from her kills. Even \nif it was something small and unglamourous.  Even this, was something \nto remember this kill by. She put the container in her hip comparment \nand relaxed back in her chair.\n\nShe looked out the window as she noticed that she was allready half \nway back to the Allience base. \n\n::KitKat::&#39;\nShe looked around the room.  Her eyes couldn&#39;t focus. Her vision was \nblurred and her neck was leaking where Diamond had bit her. She sat \nin the chair. &quot;Drill....bit....he..help..please.&quot;\nShe closed her eyes and sat there. She had to try to hold on and warn \nthe others. If Diamond was still in the base, they had to get her \nback for this.\n\n\n\n"}}
