I checked the origin of the transmission and it \nconcorded with the base where you are heading. I suggested they would \nmeet you there.\n\nDaemos: You have what? What if their intentions are hostiles? They \nwill have time to get ready for a forceful defense and we could suffer \ngreat casualties! You idiot!\n\nHe thought for a minute. Tankor&#39;s silence revealed his great \nembarassment.\n\nDaemos: On the other hand... If they truly wish to work with us... \nThis could make things easier... Hellgate over and out.\n\nHe thought. This operation was going to be either easier than \nexpected, or a total butchery. The homeworlds could not wait... He had \nto go on.\n\nDaemos: Jetstorm, Anachronox, get ready for vanguard drop. I have had \nnew data. Expect either great resistance or no resistance at all. \nThere could be a group of bots wishing to discuss. That&#39;s where the \nprophets will come in play. As soon as you three drop, you form \nProphetus and lead negotiations. The vanguard drop is in 5 cycles. \nUnderstood.\n\nThe Prophets looked at each other, worried, excited, thoughtful, but \nnonetheless decided to live up to their name.\n\nBelthassan: We are ready, Daemos.\n\nJetstorm: Anachronox, I want to pick the small and many ones. I leave \nthe big ugly ones to you, okay?\n\n\n"}}
