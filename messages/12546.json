Finish \nnow after a day or so of constant work without sleep. Aracnia was weak, her \njoints stiff, her eyes heavy. Tarantulas could leave her now, and she could \nsleep. Unfortunetly Aracnia knew when he was released that he would cause her \nsevere pain and suffering.\n    &quot;Alright you insane freak....here you go...&quot; She said sleeply. A small \ncord connecting her core conscience to Tarantulas&#39; core conscience suddenly \nhummed with power as the download began. Slowly she felt her head ease and \nthe pain stop.\n    With a beep it was done. She ripped the cord out of her head and began to \nback away slowly, with her bowcaster in her hand. She watched as his \ntransmetal body began to twitch, his fingers curled. His legs bent and he sat \nup with a graon.\n    &quot;Excellent work widow! I feel fantastic. To bad I cant say the same for \nyou. Hahahaha!&quot; He said in his raspy voice that sent chills over her.\n    Aracnia raised her bowcaster, that felt several hundred pounds, and waved \nit for him to get away. &quot;Dont come any closer! Now that you have your body \nyou have to leave, you promised! And I will kill you otherwise.&quot;\n    Now standing he towered over the female. His giant spider legs shot out \nfrom his back while his two large arms crossed his chest which heaved with \nevery breath. &quot;I lied. Your going to make a place for me in this ship, allow \nme access to all the ships functions, and, from within the shadows, run the \nPredacons.&quot;\n    &quot;Freak!&quot; She screamed and fired her bowcaster at the Archnid. Her body \nwas thrown a bit because she was so exhausted.\n    Tarantuals was hit dead on and fell with a smoldering scar on his newly \nconstructed body. With a low growl he cursed, got up, and began to thud \ncloser to the widow.\n\n    After the useless pursuit, Aerostreak, Adrax, and Autofire entered the \nbase where Paralysis, Guantix, and Grappler were. They gathered on the bridge \nwhere Quickstrike was in command.\n    Paralysis saluted Quickstrike and began to spout out the report on the \nassult of the Ark, and how they returned because ammunition was low.\n    Suddenly, a small rumble shook the ship. Paralysis looked to Aerostreak \nand then to Quickstrike. He pulled out his wepon and both bots ran towrds the \nsound.\n\n"}}
