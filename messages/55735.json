Make it so, \nPerceptor,&quot; \n&gt; she laid back on the table. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:\n&gt; Coolies. :) With some slight modifications, color & weapons. \nWeapons: 2 \n&gt; katana energy sabers, an energy whip from the tail. A high \nintensity laser \n&gt; pistol, a plasma pistol. As well as a vehicle like form that most \nof the TMs \n&gt; had that would make it look like some aircraft fighter jet or a \nfunky version \n&gt; of it. I&#39;ll let Perceptor have some fun with her upgrades as well \nif you can \n&gt; think of anything. Perhaps some revisions to what she once had, \nbut she won&#39;t \n&gt; have too much since her old form had the huge array of radar & \nscanners.\n\n\n"}}
