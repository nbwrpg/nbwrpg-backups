I have something else for you to do as well.&quot; He says,\n&gt; data downloading into a datapad from his datatracks. &quot;Can you build a\n&gt; small repair/recharge station on the island? You can use the CR\n&gt; chambers and other materials from the old Alliance base. Have the\n&gt; Lavacons help you build, they&#39;re available right now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He tosses the datapad to Wheeljack. On it were the basic specs, plus\n&gt; the places in the old Alliance base where he could get the CRs. The\n&gt; station was designed to be a quick recharge point during defensive\n&gt; battles. It was easilly accessable, and would be powered directly from\n&gt; the old Alliance base. &quot;Those are the specs and other info. Do you\n&gt; think you can do it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; :::Wheeljack/Banzai-Tron:::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::He finds Zardus::\n&gt; &gt; Wheeljack: Zardus, sir.\n&gt; &gt; ::he salutes::\n&gt; &gt; Wheeljack: Composer and i are pleased to tell you that the new\n&gt; defenses are a\n&gt; &gt; success.
