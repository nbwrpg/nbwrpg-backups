He flips to his \nfeet, stumbling but once again regaining balance. There was a large \namount of pain coming from his chest wound.\n\nFirearm manages to jump out of the way of Drag Strip, activating his \njetpack and launching into the air. He fires two charges down at the \nspeeding car.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I&#39;m back.
