Could you at least try, \nand \n&gt; I mean BOTH OF YOU, to calm down a bit and both stop moding? The \ngame \n&gt; isn&#39;t who started first, it&#39;s who will be moderated because of all \nthe \n&gt; pressure the other players are putting on the council! I mean can&#39;t \n&gt; you at least keep your war to private email? I like to see \ndevelopment \n&gt; in the storyline, yet you two only seem to bash as hard as you can \non \n&gt; each other&#39;s char! I am no council member, but I am so fucking tired \n&gt; of you two playing against each other and not alongside! And your \n&gt; constant reactions to your comments just make it worse! This message \n&gt; is also meant to advise other players thinking that this is getting \n&gt; out of hand to take up responsibilities and protest against it.
