If \nthis little factor stopped him from engaging in battle he would have to see \nto it that something like this never happened again.\nBut even as he made sure that he could stand on his own, Dinobot�s mind \ncould never get over the fact that Tavatron had abandoned him like that.\nAfter all he had done for her, after all the times he had been there for \nher�now she pulled this on him?\nIndeed, even now he was having second thoughts about attacking Tavatrons \nhonor as he did, but he still felt a slight�bitterness towards her, which he \nhad to admit he had not felt in quite some time.\nBut even the thought of this bitterness reminded him of the last time he had \nfelt it�which was when he was young and still living with his mother. After \nshe had had his younger half brother, he remembered the little brats fourth \nbirthday. Both his biological father and Dinobot/s mother had given him \nsomething; he couldn�t remember what, but it was something that Dinobot had \nalways wanted but had never gotten.\nBut when his birthday had rolled around he had gotten nothing, not even a \ngreat greeting from a single soul in the compound, but then his younger \nbrother�s day came that spoiled brat got whatever his little spark desired.\n\nDinobot growled deeply within his metallic throat. And that bitterness he \nfelt towards his mother in particular was what he felt now, only worse \nbecause he knew just what it meant now.\nHis mother had forgotten he had even existed, and even now he was afraid \nthat would happen again. But since he never showed fear it was transformed \ninto a feeling he COULD express, bitterness.\nBut even back then he had asked why that had happened, with no answer from a \nsoul�not even his own.\nAnd now he had been abandoned again? Or had he even been truly accepted in \nthe first place?\nThough, even as Dinobot thought that he knew that Tavatron had really \naccepted him, for whom he was as well.\nA growl flowed from his throat, and now�now had he ruined it, ruined it all?\nMost likely.\n\nDinobot glanced over at Tavatron.\nHad she ever had anything like his past ever happen to her? Did she knew \njust what the pain of abandonment could feel like? The gut ripping feeling, \nwhich was only fear, transformed into something a bot could handle? If so \nthen she knew how he felt right now.\nBut if she knew, she showed no signs of it.\nHowever, perhaps the reason he had assaulted her honor as a warrior as he \ndid was to make her feel that, make her feel as if she was never wanted and \nnever mattered. But if that was it, then it had worked.\nThough, even though he knew that his words was something in which was wise \nto reverse, he knew it was too late to say anything as he watched Tavatron \ntransform into beast mode. And the ice rimmed glare that she turned upon him \nbefore exiting almost shook that steel and unemotional look he wore into \nsomething more of shock. But he kept his stance and expression�the best he \ncould.\n\nDinobot didn�t follow or chase after Tavatron as she trotted out of the CR \nroom, simply crossing his arms and leaning back against the table. His \noptics hidden once again under his brow, giving him the look which would \nmake a Predacon think twice of bothering him now. But he knew that Tavatron \nwas upset, and even though her steps were steady until she was out of sight, \nhe heard them quicken to a jog and them a run until he could no longer hear \nthem padding against the hall floors.\nSo, now he was left along and in silence, not moving, but he mind spinning \nat 100 mph.\nBut it didn�t matter what he thought about or what he had in mind as right, \nit always turned out to be the factor that he had gone way too far this \ntime, but Tavatron was equally at fault.\nAnd why did females have to be so�so�emotional?\nIt just so happened that there was nothing he could do to change something \nlike that, but he always managed to forget that others really did have \nfeelings, even though he never seemed to, and their feelings could get hurt.\nWhich was what happened less then 20 cycles ago.\nAnd that was what now played on his mind, the fact that he had done \nsomething like this to Tavatron�even though she deserved it slightly. Just \nbecause she had�abandoned him�there was no reason to follow her example now.\n\nWith that Dinobot stood up straight, looking out from under his brow at the \nclosed CR doors.\nNo reason to follow her example at all�.\n\n( 30 min later)\n\n\nHer howl echoed over the forest which the cliff expanded over, never hearing \nsomething so plaintive and painful in his entire life.\nDinobot looked at Tavatron through the leaves of near trees he passed, not \neven knowing that in face he had followed her as quietly as possible in \nbeast mode.\nHe shook a bit as he walked closer, pain emanating from his lungs since his \nsystems were still not use to operating at such high levels yet. But it had \nbeen very painful just trying to keep up with this femwolf at a distance, \neven keeping with her pace. But now, thank the Matrix, she had stopped and \nsat still while he caught up, swearing quietly as a stitch began to develop \nin his side. Sweat trickling from the end of his transmetal jaws, both from \nhis overheating body�and trying to keep the pain down.\nDinobot growled and placed a clawed for limb over the growing stitch as he \nmoved on, seeing Tavatron finally stop her howling through the trees.\nBack in the CR room had had finally decided to follow her, even if it meant \napologizing to the fembot who abandoned him. He was worried that something \nmight happen to her but he also didn�t want to follow her example.\nEven though she might have left him when he need her, he wasn�t about to \nleave her if she needed him.\n\nAs Tavatrons howl died out Dinobot growled, finally and silently pushing \nthrough the last bit of bush before he stepped out a few feet right behind \nTavatron, grinding his teeth as the stitch flared up again.\nWatching her lay her head down on her paws he simply stood there, knowing \nfor a fact that she would know that he was there sooner or later.\nBut he wasn�t there just because he was worried about her, but also because \nhe still wanted to know just why she had left and maybe let her speak her \nmind while he could as well.\nThis had to be settled and soon, there was no way he was going to let her \nslip away this time.\nThis was going to be settled, even if he had to get down on his knees and \nbet her forgiveness first. Even though he hoped to the Matrix above that he \ndidn�t have to.\nIt took him just enough will power and courage to swamp an army just to get \nup the nerve to follow her, in threat that he had to apologize.  But his \nvoice was a growl, even though there was more pain behind it then \nannoyance.**\n\n� I swear, you have me�wrapped around your little�finger�.�\n\n** Still holding the stitch in his side.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
