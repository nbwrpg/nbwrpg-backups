Yes, he was a\n&gt; machine=\r\n who&#39;s very size and power commanded respect. Not only that but\n&gt; he had fo=\r\nrged a group of predators . . . of PREDACONS seemingly out\n&gt; the defeat tha=\r\nt had been dealt them by the Maximals at the end of the\n&gt; first Beast Wars.=\r\n Was he still MEGATRON and GALVATRON or was he\n&gt; something wholly different=\r\n and how would this affect the future of the\n&gt; Predacons? Only the future w=\r\nould say.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the group made their way to the meeting room there was in=\r\ndeed an\n&gt; open message link waiting for HYDRAS, although the signature was =\r\nnot\n&gt; that of STRAIGHT SHOT and instead of looking for WASPINATOR it was\n&gt; =\r\naddressed properly to the current Predacon commander HYDRAS.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We must =\r\ntalk.&quot; were the words that were waiting for HYDRAS as he\n&gt; arrived. LEO PRI=\r\nME&#39;s stern face appeared to look through the link and\n&gt; see not only HYDRAS=\r\n but those who were traveling with him, peering\n&gt; into his very secrets.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Of course that was not the case, since HYDRAS would have to\n&gt; acknowledg=\r\ne him first, and it would be up to him how much could be\n&gt; seen.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n\nAt this point, as VICE GRIP came online, the first thing he did is run a =\r\nscanner and update his files.  Upon running them over and updating his pers=\r\nonnel records, he paused quietly.  &quot;I assume that if LORD HYDRAS is going t=\r\no make a deal with the MAXIMALS, we should take this opportunity to attempt=\r\n to achieve some of our secondary objectives.&quot;\n\nPausing, &quot;We should send a =\r\nteam to our old base for a salvage operation, and keep some of our new pers=\r\nonnel in reserve, given I assume the MAXIMALS are not fluent wtih..  Myself=\r\n, DINOBOT, or BLACKARACHNIA.  While the main unit of known personnel goes t=\r\no the parlay, we can have our other teams achieving secondary objectives an=\r\nd ating as a strategic reserve should it become necessary.&quot;\n\nAnd also to ke=\r\nep an optic upon TARANTALUS and CRYOTEK.  Glancing over to HYDRAS and SKY S=\r\nHADOW for confirmatino of his suggestions then or secondary orders.\n\n\n"}}
