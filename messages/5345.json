Oh yeah. I&#39;ll go on ahead.&quot;\nShe transformed into her owl mode and flew up ahead.  She spotted the Ark.  \nShe couldn&#39;t beieve her optics.  The Ark was missing part of it&#39;s structure. \n  A huge hole had been blow out on the side of the Ark.  The ground all \naround was charred.  Mech fluid on the ground in patches everywhere.  &quot;What \nhappened here?&quot;\nShe flew in for a closer look. A large battle had taken place. She hoped \nthat the Maximals survived.  The Autoguns  did not fire on her as she flew \ninto the entrance.  She stopped just inside the door way and transformed \ninto bot mode.  She took a few steps and drew her gun.  She slowly walked \ndown the hallway. She kept out of sight incase someone other than Maximal \nwalked by.\n\n\n---Orginal Message---\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 30, 2000 10:19pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nThe sights,filled his optics, the sounds were all around him, echoing\nthrough the trees. The smells of animals he had yet to encounter, but\nseemed familiar.He assumed these were the Maximals. He caught traces\nof burnt trees, and chared earth from thier previous battles, but\nsomehow the wildlife didn&#39;t seem affected.\n\n&quot;I smell something out of the ordinary.&quot;\n\nHe didn&#39;t know ordinary but he knew what he smelled didn&#39;t belong.\n\nHow far till we&#39;re at the Ark? maybe you should call ahead to be sure.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
