But soon her look of shock turned to the look of stone, she was not impressed!\nIron Raptor growled at Plintissa.*\n\n&quot; You have...betrayed us?!&quot;\n\n* She was disappointed to hear that a friend had done this but knew that she was half right, Liono wasn&#39;t the best leader in the universe and she knew it. But he had more authority then her so she kept her mouth shut...for now.\nIron Raptor looked over at Prowl, she sighed.*\n\n&quot; Well, there isn&#39;t much that we can do here. I heard a desperate transmission a few hundred clicks away by a new bot named Grimlock, apparently he&#39;s under attack by a few Preds. I suggest that we check it out. But first I have to relay a report back to base, alright?&quot;\n\n* The transmission from the Maximal Grimlock was a considerable long ways away and off the island, in order to get to him she would need Prowl&#39;s ability of flight to get her there. She was a land creature, not one of the air.\nIron Raptor turned away from Plintissa and opened her com-link to Tigerhawk.*\n\n&quot; Tigerhawk, this is Iron reporting: Set the auto guns to target signature 31.6 (Plintissa), we have ourselves a new enemy. And Prowl and I are going to check out a scene in grid Raxen, there&#39;s a notification that a Maximal is in need of help there. Please stand by, we might need back up. And please keep the scanners on high to scan for new energy signatures, with the Predacon&#39;s outnumbering us it might be wise to get to new stasis pods before they do and gain new allies. Iron Out.&quot;\n\n* She then turned to Prowl, not bothering to even look at Plintissa any longer. Iron Raptor sighed.*\n\n&quot; Ready?&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
