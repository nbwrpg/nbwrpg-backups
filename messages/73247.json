Thunder..  After\n&gt; thunder, comes rain.  But before all that, comes lightning.  Cast to the sky\n&gt; from the ground up..  Lightning causes fire, but it can also take it away.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks to everyone, being sure no one is within his radius.  He opens his\n&gt; mouth and concentrates.  Tiny bolts of lightning begin to come up from his\n&gt; gullet and crackle out from his mouth.  He then roars, as it sounds like\n&gt; thunder, rumbling across the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I know what I must do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While emerging out near the top of the mountain, Tucson spreads his wings,\n&gt; and beats them to lift himself upward into the smoke filled sky.  It takes\n&gt; him great effort but he slowly starts lifting off the side of the mountain\n&gt; and into the air.  He now attempts to create enough static electricity to\n&gt; induce stormcloud formation.  If he could get it to rain, by using that\n&gt; science and the power of the old dragon, he could at least stall the magma\n&gt; enough to get everyone out of there in decent shape, and stop the firey bird\n&gt; above.  Yet, he was exhausted.  Could he do this now, in his physical state?\n&gt;  He had to try.  With great determination, dead set in his eyes, the dragon\n&gt; now picks up his speed in the air, and flies after the bird.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not this time, Magmatron, not this time!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He opens wide, and concentrates with all his might, to breathe a bolt of\n&gt; lightning, just strong enough to attempt stormcloud formation and hopefully\n&gt; a little rainstorm along with it.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWhile TUSCON does not have the ability to call storms or to make any\nkind of weather pattern, it is conceivable that a lightning strike of\nthe right modulation into clouds that were already filled with water\ncould indeed bring a down pour, and yes there were black clouds that\nwere floating above the volcano and the surrounding trees.\n\nUnfortunately it was not water that filled these clouds but instead it\nsomething darker!\n\nWhen TUSCON&#39;s strike hit them they exploded and it was a down pour of\nburning soot and ash that began to fall on the ground below.\n\n&quot;Tuscon!&quot; The fiery avian said as it winged its way over towards\nTUSCON&#39;s position - The voice sounded exactly like RODIMUS&#39; even his\nIFF signature was the same now. In his claws was clutched NIGHLIGHT as\nhe winged his way over, the fire coming from his body and wings\nprotecting NIGHTLIGHT from the embers falling from the skies - turning\nthem instead to motes of smoke and fumes.\n\n&quot;What are you doing Tuscon?!?&quot; RODIMUS said.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, seein gthe new upgraded flaming PHOENIX of RODIMUS PRIMAL\n&gt; shooting up through the air, DINOBOT sent a message to any PREDACONS\n&gt; within his communications range - even assuming that he COULD communicate\n&gt; within a short range.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I suggest an expeditious retreat is in order./  We are outmatched here, and\n&gt; there is nothing to gain from further combat..  Let the MAXIMALS deal with\n&gt; it.&quot;  Assuming, of course, anyone was within range and his radio worked!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nActually DINOBOT&#39;s radio was indeed beginning to work, and its range\nwas quickly expanding even as he talked.\n\nSKY SHADOW looked over at DINOBOT, &quot;Agreed.&quot; He transmitted back as he\nand his FUZORS rallied around them. &quot;It&#39;s time to return to base.&quot;\n\n&quot;If that&#39;s Rodimus,&quot; INJECTOR, one of the PREDACON FUZOR&#39;s said, &quot;then\nI wonder what happened to Magmatron and Optimus, and that black\nRodimus?&quot;\n\nThere was a grunt from TERRORGATOR, &quot;If he&#39;s alive.&quot; He hooked a thumb\nat the feiry RODIMUS in the air, &quot;Then there&#39;s no tellin&#39;&quot;\n\nSKY SHADOW nodded, &quot;Then that is all the more reason for us to leave.&quot;\nHe looked over at DINOBOT, &quot;Do you have everyone that came with you?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
