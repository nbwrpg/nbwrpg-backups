Just to be close like that.\n&lt; Any time. &gt;\nShe continues quietly towards the CF doors, leaving Prowl to take care of \nwhatever business he had with Epyon before she received the thoughts from \nProwl just before reaching the doors.\nSo, two members of his crew were missing, and he was starting to make plans \nto dismantle his ship. It must be for that idea that Prowl had before after \nthe first battle that they got back from.\n&lt; I�ll take care of it. &gt;\nIron Raptor looked over her shoulder at Mantle and his crew. *\n\n� Mantle, please select 3 members of your crew and prep them for possible \ndeparture.�\n\n* She then turned to face the doors of the CF again and passed through them \nas they opened for her.\n&lt; Prowl, contact Epyon and tell him to join me here in the control room. I \nwant to understand what�s going on before I send any of my soldiers out. &gt; ( \nshe doesn�t know Epyon�s busy helping angel prime.)\nIron Raptor opened a com channel to Histeria. *\n\n� Histeria, I need a Maximal wide announcement for all of the faction to \neither remain or return to base.  There�s going to be a few things going on \nhere and it involves everyone.�\n\n* And from there Iron Raptor disappeared into the shadows of the \nCybertronian Fire, her bulky armor making a siolette against the light of \ndistant rooms. A figure which was not to be reckoned with. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
