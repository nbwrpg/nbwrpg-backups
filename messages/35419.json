The three\nmembers of the table turned to face each other, as Reflector transformed\ninto his three parts, and Ratbat landed on his shoulder. They waited,\nand watched. &quot;Perhaps it is time to contact Motormaster. With the six\nDecepticons we sent, they will not be able to stop these Autobots.&quot; a\ngruff voice said. &quot;Agreed, but we must also not allow the Decepticons to\ngain any power, at our expense.&quot; another concurs. &quot;Yes, let us see if he\nis doing our bidding on planet earth, by eliminating the other\nunpleasant problems&quot; the third said. He turned to Reflector and Ratbat.\n&quot;You two, are free to go. We however will need another unit, who was not\nwilling to bend to our ideology, unlike you two. Go get subject 234&quot; he\nsaid with a drastic sounding tone. Reflector&#39;s parts all walked off down\nthe hall, while Ratbat flew over and perched on one of the council\nmembers shoulders. Content with their current actions, the Council lets\nout a dark, evil chuckle, which fills the hallways, at the Autobots\nexpense.\n\n"}}
