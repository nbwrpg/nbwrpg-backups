There is a \nproblem, but nothing that we can&#39;t repair.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n- Go through all messages before you start to reply.\n\n- Reply only once with each character, but try to incorporate a \nreply to every character he talked to.\n\n- try to keep your posting time to a reasonable distance when there \nare more than two people involved\n\n- Be mindful of others, please!\n\nThis is not something to drag you down, just to help you live with \neach other.\n\n\n"}}
