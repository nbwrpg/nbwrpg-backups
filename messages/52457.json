She cares \nabout only one target: Hydras himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Pumpskin sees the barrage from Katya and dashes to \nintercept her, drawing his twin leaf-blade scimitars as he goes.  As \nhe closes in from the side, the four lashing tentacles on his back \nsuddenly extend to a length of 20 feet and surround his much smaller \nadversary, attempting to trap her in their crushing grip.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Under the heavy foliage, Katya watches the scene.

I will make a hit-and-run while you remain covered and \n&gt; try to take that wolfboy out. After that, go back in the trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang nods. She starts running, still far from the Predacons \nand \n&gt; opens fire with her heavy large and medium lasers. She aims mainly \n&gt; Hydras. Blackfang starts pumping four energy shots at Wolfenstein.\n&gt; He then fall back in the trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Star Colonel, the kills are yours. Skill, Ragnar!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: Skill, Katya! Kup, Aerotaur, Windlord, Empath, concentrate \n&gt; your fire on my targets, the main Pred force.
