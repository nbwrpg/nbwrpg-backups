He found him \nin his office. He was hunched over a computer monitor typing something. He \nwalked around to see what it was. It was a diagram of a spider bug (Phobia&#39;s \nwork). He was reprogramming one of the little bugs.\n    &quot;I&#39;m glad you came Bobertron. I have something important to tell you.&quot; \nMagmatron said as he noticed Bobertron. &quot;I am leaving you in command of the \nbase well I&#39;m gone. I do not know when I will be back, and if I go offline a \nmessage will appear on the screen here.\n    &quot;Let Mantella go on some hunting missions, it will give here pratice of \nher new abilaties. Also let Shredder do the same.\n    &quot;If you recive a message from the Iron Fist or the Maximals respond to \nit. I am trying to make an alliance with the Maximals and I wish to destroy \nthe Iron Fist.\n    &quot;Be warned, there is an infestation of bugs on the ship, the cleaning \nsystems are not working, so please kill all that you find. CyberShark is \ndeveloping a relationship with the Predacon Battera, do nothing to interfere.\n    &quot;My plans are here on the computer, they will only respond to my \nsignature though. In the event of my untimly death they will be able to you. \nGood-Bye and Good-Luck.&quot;\n    With that Magmatron took his leave. Bobertron was quite stunned. He had \njust been given control of the Destron base, he didn&#39;t really know what to \nthink. But he knew he had to familiraize himself with the computer systems \nbefore anything. He sat down in Magmatron&#39;s chair, which was somewhat to big \nfor him and connected with the main computer (kinda like Dinobot in &quot;Code of \nHero&quot;). Information started to pour into his head. He now suspected he would \nbe more knowledgable of this ship than even Magmatron.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Cheetor/Primal Prime::\n\n    They were both heading back to the Maximal base. Cheetor looked around at \nhis surroundings, they all looked so familiar.\n    &quot;So, Primal, umm...how did you get into the Beast Wars?&quot; Cheetor asked.\n    &quot;I don&#39;t really know, I think I was from a stasis pod from the Axalon, \nbut I could be wrong.&quot; Primal replied.\n    &quot;The Axalon!, Hey that was my ship. It&#39;s how I got this spot on smooth \nfur coat.&quot; Cheetor said.\n\n"}}
