He was a little singed, as\nthe explosion was pretty blocked by the vines and walls between the room\nthey were in and the one with the bombs.\n\nBurning Hammer: I guess we have some repair work to do, now.\n\nArrow: How fun.\n\nArrow pulled Zeni up by an arm.\n\nArrow: Don&#39;t get knocked over so easily, the opponent would take advantage\nof it.\n\nPerplex came out of a CR Chamber.\n\nPerplex: Hey guys, battle over?\n\nArrow: No.\n\nPerplex: Then what are we waiting for?\n\nBurning Hammer: Perplex. Sorry for putting a tracking device in you.\n\nPerplex: What? How&#39;d you remember that?\n\nBurning Hammer: Just did.\n\nPerplex watches Burning Hammer cautiously, then turns to the door.\n\nPerplex: I want command over the shields so I can open them when I want to.\n\nArrow: Same thing I want, Perplex, but come here, first.\n\nArrow led Perplex to the weapons room. Everything was knocked over and\ndestroyed from the explosion, but the weapons seemed fine. Stranato did a\ncrappy job. Arrow pulled several weapons from the rubble and gave them to\nPerplex.\n\nArrow: You have to use these.\n\nPerplex: Arrow, I--\n\nArrow: Shhh! Zenith told me you were wary about weapons, but you need to\nforget that now. We&#39;re vigilantes, we have to fight to defeat evil like\nthose Maximals and Deemos. Now do what you must. You think you&#39;re strong\nwithout weapons, but you&#39;re not. We have to fight with everything we have.\n\nPerplex: Okay.\n\nHe takes the weapons and follows Arrow back to the door.\n\nArrow: Open the shields again, we need to return to the battle.\n\nZeni: Can I come?\n\nArrow: Are you going to fight?\n\nZeni: Yeah, I&#39;m really going to win.\n\nPerplex: Arrow, no.\n\nArrow: Come with us then.\n\nZeni: Yeah!\n\nPerplex: No!\n\nArrow: I said yes!

We won&#39;t let him get hurt too\nbad.\n\nPerplex: I can&#39;t let you do that, Arrow.\n\nArrow: You can&#39;t do a thing to stop me.\n\nPerplex: His death rests on on your shoulders, Arrow. I&#39;ll gut you like a\nfish.\n\nArrow: Relax, partner. I&#39;m the expert, remember?\n\nPerplex: Well--\n\nArrow: Shhh!
