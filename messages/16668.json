But I gotta play it out now.)\n\nTrainers\n\nPrebon laughed like a maniac as Striker stumbled to the floor with a \nhuge hole in his head. Time to play.\n\n&quot;Excellent! Now I can reprogram Striker to be my warrior without even \nputting a chip on him! Ignatius, get up! Your injury is nothing. We \nwill fix it later. Put Spears in a CR Chamber. I&#39;m taking Striker to \nbecome mine.&quot;\n\nBullet picked up Spears, and Prebon picked up Striker. They headed to \nthe bridge.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t really know Eagle Eye, but all I knew was he was determined \nfor our goal.
