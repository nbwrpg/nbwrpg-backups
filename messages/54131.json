Then the pod opened and \nout stepped a bot.  This bot was unlike some of the other bots. This \nbot was different. Like most bots, she had a spark, a body and a \nmind that wished to learn.  She was curious. Curious about her new \nworld and about her new surroundings.  This bot that looked at the \nnew world was somewhat new herself.  She was a small bot about 3 \nfoot high in bot mode and about 2 foot in beast mode.  She wasn&#39;t \nprogrammed for either maximal or predacon.  She was neutral for the \nmoment.  Her small body was somewhat childlike. For indeed she was \njust that, a child.  Her form in beast mode was that of a small \nfox.  She walked out of the pod and walked around her new planet. \nHer program was that to find out all she could about her \nsurroundinsgs and all she could about everything she encountered. \nShe walked away from the pod and started exploring.  She forest \naround her was teaming with life.  She started counting the flowers \nand trees. She started watching the birds flying above her.  She \nstopped for a moment and looked at a bunny chewing on a clump of \ngrass. &quot;Hi there little fella. My name is Cam. What&#39;s yours?&quot;  The \nbunny got frightened and hopped off. &quot;Gee, I just wanted to be \nfriends or something. I wasn&#39;t going to hurt you, you, what ever you \nare.&quot; she said as the bunny hopped off into the forest.  Cam just \nwalked along the path and just followed her curiosity.\n\n\n"}}
