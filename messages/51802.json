I don&#39;t see why you have to try to defend yourself against invisible attacks, Dewey. Are you that insecure? I&#39;d be busy telling everyone that the nWo robbed me and attempted to downgrade me and they must be destroyed, but you&#39;re more concerned about someone thinking that you&#39;re gay. When we say faggot, we&#39;re not talking about the &quot;gay&quot; faggot, but rather the &quot;I hate you&quot; kind of faggot. As for girls, I&#39;ve always respected girls. I&#39;ve always treated them like humans and actually think that boys are the gross ones. Hey, if I could have made a choice of what to start as, I&#39;d have picked a girl, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gay. In fact, playing with My Little Ponies doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gay. I dream about one day finding a perfect woman to love every day. I&#39;ve actually never thought about sex, though, aside from wanting to have children. I believe that pre marital sex is a top relationship buster, so I try to keep my mind off of such things. I consider myself a good clean person. Like anyone cares about me, though, I&#39;m evil. Oh, but I&#39;m evil is a good wholesome sort of way. Wait. What was this post supposed to be about again? If I made you feel &quot;dirty&quot; or gay, Dewboy, I&#39;m sorry, it wasn&#39;t my intention. My intention was to kick your ass for thrashing Airly for her language. She speaks English just fine, if you ask me, and I seen no mistake in her post. &quot;Long life to NBW&quot; made perfect sense. You can say to someone &quot;Long life to you!&quot; and it makes perfect sense.

That would suck if we were, because we are better than the council.  And in a manner of speaking, we sort of are on the council, it&#39;s just that rAuq is too woman to admit he&#39;s part of the nWo.  And, about girls, I never thought girls were &quot;icky&quot;.  But I never had fantasies either.  Girls are girls, women are women, they don&#39;t mean a thing to me.  I don&#39;t want to share my life with ANYBODY, and I certainly don&#39;t want to share my future fame and fortune with anybody but my co-workers who will also be getting fame and fortune.  They know who they are.  In fact, some of my future co-workers are getting fame and fortune right now.\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo! Terms of Service. \n\nYahoo!
