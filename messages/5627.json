The smell of food brought \nhim out of his anger enough to get him modivated. He heard the flapping of \nTerrorsaur&#39;s wings when he approached her. And at the corner of his eyes, he \ncould see the dactyl going for the meat that was set for him.\n\nHe wasn&#39;t going to have it. The instant the red dactyl came in arms length, \nQuickstrike threw his arm out and stuck his head. Terrorsaur&#39;s long beak \nmissed. He sqwaked from the hit, and flew towards the outside of the cave, \ngrumbling.\n\n&quot;Beat ya to it!&quot; the young Fuzor snapped at the dactyl, mocking him. &quot;Go get \nyer own!&quot; He laughed in a victorious way. &quot;Did ya see that?&quot; he said to \nStingtra. He was just too proud of himself.\n\nHe transformed to his beast mode and snatched the meat up. He crawled away \nfrom Stingtra and went to a place where he could eat.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
