He \nflies up near Prebon.\n\n&quot;I think I killed the femm that was with them,&quot; he says, frowning \nabout the thought of Spears coming back, &quot;There are much better \nwarriors than Spears, Master. We could recruit them instead.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA rocket hits Ramulus in the leg, nearly blasting it into\nsmitherenes. \nHe growls unconscioustly, his spark releasing repair coils and \nbeginning to work on the damage.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm nods. &quot;I&#39;ll take him,&quot; he says, walking over to BlueStreak\nand \nlifting him to his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Meet you all back at the Ark,&quot; he says, flying off.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProto walks over to SnowCat, kneeling to check on her damage. She was \ndead.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s dead,&quot; he says, standing up, &quot;Do we take her back to the Ark.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen reaches the Ark, entering and putting Spears in a CR \nchamber.\n\nHe sighs as he sits back and waits for her to heal, relaxing for a \nshort while.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon smiled evily.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Than let&#39;s make sure that he&#39;s dead.

It&#39;s not going to make him\none \n&gt; of us, but it&#39;s in his spark. It will make him go mad with anger\nand \n&gt; things, maybe attack the Maximals. It&#39;ll be great. And don&#39;t think \n&gt; that we are done with the Maximals yet. We have not forgotten \nSpears, \n&gt; and we will get her back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He continued back to the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Uh, Koj, did you say *Ki* in a post?
