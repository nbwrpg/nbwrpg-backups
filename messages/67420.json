Animus is close to\nthe ground, the minion is much higher up. \n\nAzureblade is able to outrun the rockets of the minion. The rockets\neventually loose power and fall away, leaving the Decepticon some\ndistance away. \n\n&quot;This is foolishness.&quot; He shook his head in derision. &quot;You run from\nbattle even as you call us weak?&quot; Gripping his sword in both hands he\nstands his ground as the full brunt of the firepower converges on him\nand detonates explosively. When the light and smoke clears there is\nanother crater, but in the middle of it Animus still stands, apparently\nprotected by some shield of power. &quot;Face me Decepticon!&quot; His voice\ncarries over the distance. &quot;Your antics are tiresome!&quot; With a\ndeliberate motion he directs his sword at Azureblade he fires a blast\nof power at him!\n\nPreston\n(Animus)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
