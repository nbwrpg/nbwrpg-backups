But getting \n&gt; their, with the damage now, is going to be hard. I take two \ntransport \n&gt; pods and rearrange parts to make them one big one, with alot of \n&gt; storage space. With double the engines, she can make it to \n&gt; outerspace. The problem would be that she would burn up entering \nand \n&gt; leaving the atmosphere. I would have to take a small piece of the \n&gt; outer hull of the ark to cover it up with. Except that would leave \nit \n&gt; even more disabled for a few hours. And their is the chance that it \n&gt; will still burn up and the mission will be for nothing. But by the \n&gt; looks of things it&#39;s our only hope. So this is what I suggest. You \n&gt; two start getting together troops. I&#39;ll start making the pod. I&#39;m \n&gt; almpost done working on the CR Chambers, so I could start the pod \n&gt; today. When my friend Fliq get out, he&#39;ll help me. In a few days \nwhen \n&gt; I&#39;ve put it all together, him and I will take it up, since it&#39;s our \n&gt; project. You two take the troops and attack, or hold steady and \n&gt; fortify, which ever you want. You give us a list of what to bring \n&gt; back, and we search for it. What do you say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
