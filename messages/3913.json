But his body ached beyond belief and he knew that he would not be able to move at the moment if he tried, just kneeling there dealing with the pain and trying to calm his racing spark.\nThe feel of Tavatron�s hand on his shoulder made him grow as a wave of pain washed over him from his shoulder and swept towards his chest, his teeth ground within him mouth as he bit back a yell of pain and smack her hand away�but he resisted.\nHe looked up at her with a glare that would have frozen fire but then looked away, biting back the sudden urge to yell at her for touching his shoulder�even though it was fairly gentle�on raw armor! He sighed away the comment as he then looked off towards the field; it really wasn�t her fault that she had hurt him�she didn�t know just how hurt he was. But she should have known that he was the last bot in the world that liked to be touched, from any bot for any reason! He wasn�t one of those huge types that liked to cuddle and all that, he was the type who liked to slag and the sight of blood better then the open arms of a loved one.\nDinobot growled at those thoughts, that was what made him so different. That�s what set him apart as a cold and unforgiving bot rather then a logically passionate one who made friends easily, but maybe that was also the reason why he felt a little alone at times but it was a good fact that those feelings passed quickly.\nBut then the sound of Tavatron�s voice brought him to reality and his thought, it�s tone sounding a little comforting�a lot more then when she had touched his shoulder.\nHe turned his face back towards her and was about to put her concerns at rest about how all right he was when her gaze suddenly snapped upwards, his optics following but not fast enough due to the throbbing in his head. He caught one quick look from Tavatron just before his world was suddenly thrown upside down by a sudden shove to the left.\nDinobot fell head over heals before coming to rest just inches away from Oblitertron�s foot as it slammed down right in front of his nose, his muscles going stiff and his tail almost going straight up into the air as he stared at his reflection in the foot armor of the Alliance behemoth. The shock nearly making him yell in surprise.\nWith a quick but fuzzy scan he surveyed the area about him as well as the giant transformer and found Tavatron�s body on the other side of the huge foot, the shock wave from the foots impact obviously knocking her out.\nWith a very painful snarl Dinobot got to his feet the best that he could and leaned against the giant ankle in front of him for a few seconds, his body needing to get used to the pain he was feeling and his limbs a bit stiff from a leaking servo fluid pump�the liquid running down the back of his shoulder�s from the joints.\nWith a heave of his weight and great will power he hurried his limbs to move over the foot of Oblitertron but not before sighting and grabbing Tavatron�s staff, thrusting it towards the robot�s main servo of it�s ankle as he traveled past and to the other side.\nHis limbs felt like falling off as he took the last step off of the giant foot and onto the ground on the other side, but then falling to his knees as he then tried to take another step. Quickly picking himself up he limped over to Tavatron and assessed her damage, his own systems� on the verge of failure as he picked her up in his arms and quickly got out of the way of the behemoth.\nKnowing that there was no cover what so ever around that could save them from the terrible might of the combined bots he then moved a fair difference off but then turned back towards Oblitertron, perhaps an apology was in order to ease their temper but he knew that he was no good at such things.\nDinobot�s systems began to fail slowly as he then looked down at the damaged Tavatron and then let out a pained sigh, if he didn�t do something then bot�s like her would be dead within no time what so ever.\nWith a growl he then looked back towards the robotic threat and struggled to remain on his feet and maintain his systems just a little longer, beyond all rage there was reason�it just had to be reached. *\n\n� Stop! It was a mistake, I�as well as many other Maximals did not know of the treaty!! We are aware now! All fire has ceased!! Can you not see?!�\n\n* With that then he stood his ground a few hundred meters from the charging Alliance terror, bots had logic circuits and as bad as he was at compromises and negotiations he knew that this had to stop.  But he felt a little naked and silly just standing there, a little bot in the wake of a tidal wave. * \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
