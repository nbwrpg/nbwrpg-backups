She saw the missles head right for \nher. She jumped just as the missles hit above her head.  SHe fell tot \nhe ground, a huge gash in her shoulders, neck, part of the side of \nher head was damaged, her body was filled with shrapnel.  She lay on \nthe ground, leaking mech fluid and shaking.  But slowly, her wounds \nstarted to heal.  In a few hours her wounds would be completely \nhealed, and she would be in fighing order again.  But for now, her \nglowling mech fluid seeped out of the wounds and onto the ground. \n\n(No this isn&#39;t a mode.  Black Aracnia brought her back from the \nmatrix. And instead of normal Mech fluid, it&#39;s mostly liquid energon \nthat she has in her body.  Because of the energon, her body heals \nvery quickly.)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Uh, Logo, that thing you&#39;re climbing over is on fire.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream weaved past one optic shot, but the other clipped hsi \nwing \n&gt; and a trail of blac smoke started to come from it. He winced, but \n&gt; than laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; All right mousey, he thought, I was only going to take you back to \n&gt; KitKat and find out how much you know.

But he didn&#39;t need to. The bot was done enough to try and \ngo \n&gt; through the fire. All she needed was a little help.....\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream loaded another missle and locked it on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My first kill in the new body......&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream fired the missle, heading straight for Darkmouse.\n\n\n"}}
