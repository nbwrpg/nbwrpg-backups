I apologize if this is any inconvenience.)\n\n* Dinobot Growled as he heard Prowl chuckle, not really thinking that his comment on the Alliance as fools was all that funny. But he was not an overly humorous bot, just one that had his opinions that some, apparently, thought funny at times. He shrugged, let the bot think what he wished. He had that right.\nBut then he almost smiled at the surprise that the bot Scattershot would have on his face if he suddenly shot at him, a charge seemingly to come out of nowhere. Dinobot then thinking that he would think that the base was haunted, already classifying Scattershot to have that sort of mind the way he babbled to that head.\nWith a sigh Dinobot then followed Prowl around the same corner in which Scattershot had taken, still not liking the fact that Prowl was in lead.\nThey both reached the door to the torture chamber together, Dinobot looking over the door carefully as Prowl mentioned that these just might be the doors in which they looked for.\nHe pressed and then ran a hand along the steel of the door, slightly pressing against it without a sound. It was not a particularly think door, thinking of how he should have given way a bit as he pressed against it.\nIndeed there had to be either something else on the other side of this door, something that reinforced it to the point that it would not give to his pushing. Dinobot pushed a little harder, confirming that it was inforced.\nHe growled. *\n\n� Suicide? Negative. This door is no longer passable in the simplest terms. Reinforced.�\n\n* He then heard the voice of Dark One and Nemesis and snapped his head towards the vent just as Prowl�s did, his optics narrowed and his teeth bared. Obviously they had gotten there just in time; the tortures were just about to begin. But whom was to be tortured first, that was the question that bothered him the most.\nDinobot then tensed as he heard prowl speak, still keeling his optics on the vent. But then just after Prowl asked him to help lift him towards the large vent a thought hit him, causing him to look towards Prowl with a puzzled look for a moment. Wasn�t Prowl a flyer? Couldn�t he get to the vent himself?\nDinobot shock his head and then looked towards the vent again, still thinking of what horrid things in which they could be doing to Tavatron at this moment. There was no time to argue whether Prowl could get to the vent himself or not, there was only the time to act.\nDinobot then moved so that he was directly under the vent, looking up then at Prowl. The fellow Maximal could climb to his shoulders by stepping on the base of his tail, then if he needed even more height then he could use his hands as well. Whatever worked.�\nHe then braced himself, though knowing that he was much heavier then Prowl and could take the weight. Mainly just doing so that the bird�s movements upon his back would not cast him unbalanced and sends then both sprawling to the floor.\nBut the vent was not all THAT high, surely both his height and Prowl would match it. Easily reached. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
