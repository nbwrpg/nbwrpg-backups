His optics narrowing slightly as she smiled before mentioning that their computer activity systems continued what information he could use to able him to locate Von.\r\nVlad smiled wickedly to himself, flashing a rather deadly set of teeth. However, he quickly righted himself in appearance and all evil aspects vanished from his features, leaving the smile of a charmingly handsome young man. Vlad leaned back, paying no such a mind to the wolf which seemed to wish to be picking his teeth with his super structure.** &quot; Sounds like perfection to my needs, My Lady.&quot; ** Vlad went into a slight bow.** &quot; As I am sure you are to the many eyes of preying men.&quot; ** He gave her a look which went along with his charm, but was in truth fake interest.\r\nVlad had a long history of using people to get what he wanted, no matter the cost. And a broken spark was easily patched when the other person found what could mend it.\r\nHe offered Fenox his arm so that she could lead him to a console where he could collect data on Von.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
