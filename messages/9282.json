It crouched down in the tall grasses and slowly \napproached the spot where Lunarpine was rolling.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine hears the low growl and knows he&#39;s being followed, he \n&gt; enters a patch of high grass and rolls around on the ground for a \n&gt; bit, the concentrated smell should confuse his stalker. He circled \n&gt; around and let out a high pitched howl, it would attract attention \n&gt; but it would also let it know that he knew that it was there.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
