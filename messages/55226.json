She rested \nagainst the wall next to the main entrance and searched for the \nstrength to get up.  She hauled herself up and went out the entrance. \nShe stopped at the small closet compartment just on the inside of the \ndoorway and grabbed an emergency ration of energon.  She tucked it in \nher shoulder compartment and went back to the battle grounds. \n\nIt took her a while, but she finally made it. Her internal life meter \nwas showing her power levels at 40%.  She groaned and continued on. \nShe made her way to the battle field. She stopped as she found the \nscent of Windlord. She smelled the air. Even in bot mode, her sences \nof hearing and smell were still very keen.  She followed the smell. \nShe could also smell three other bots with that one. She did not know \nwhat she would find, but she would be willing to take it on. She drew \nher pistol and followed her nose. \n\n\n"}}
