In this case, The maximals could hold the line\nhere while the Rogues go and destroy the remaining attackers at their\nbase. The preds tend to strike with all forces, but I don&#39;t know about\nthe Tripreds. Besides, their ship seemed to be quite well defended.\nThat would be very hard.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I understand that the Tripreds are much more dangerous,&quot; Devilcat \n&gt; points out.  &quot;But harsh experience has taught me never to discount an \n&gt; opposing force, no matter how weak it may seem.  If we focus all our \n&gt; attention on the Tripredacus forces, Hydras is free to strike as he \n&gt; chooses.  And I know from doing it myself how devastating that tactic \n&gt; is when done properly.  A better plan would be to wait for one or the \n&gt; other to make a move, then counter it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Alright, but remember I have to talk to you as one \n&gt; officer\n&gt; &gt; to another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil looked at Devilcat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I don&#39;t want the Tripreds to take hold here, but I hope \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; see why they are the real threat, not the Preds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus gets up, looking to the guests on the otherside of his \n&gt; desk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: If you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go deal with this \n&gt; pod\n&gt; &gt; problem.
