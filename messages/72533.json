Stampy, scan the\n&gt; room for invisible trip wires, and move in ac=\r\ncordingly to where they are\n&gt; located.  If you can get around them without =\r\nsetting them off, we have an\n&gt; excellent chance at getting out of here unde=\r\ntected.  Night Viper, its\n&gt; diversion time.  Perhaps we can cause a glitch =\r\nor two in the ships\n&gt; programming to get focus on that rather than us.  Tha=\r\nt will give us more\n&gt; time to work.  Big Convoy, I want you to go ahead wit=\r\nh the rescue effort, I\n&gt; will follow from behind. Now, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nA=\r\nt TUSCON=92s command there is dead silence in the hall. The only sounds\ntha=\r\nt could be heard was the sound of the door sliding open to admit\nSABERBACK =\r\nand SKYBYTE and then those same doors sliding closed again.\n\nNeither STAMPY=\r\n nor NIGHT VIPER move a micron except to turn and look\nat BIG CONVOY.\n\nLONG=\r\n RACK turned to look at TUSCON as he straightened, =93You do realize\nthat a=\r\ns a . . . =93\n\nBIG CONVOY cut off LONGRACK with a simple upraised hand. =93=\r\nIt=92s a good\nplan.=94 He said as he turned to look at LONG RACK and then T=\r\nUSCON,\n=93With some revision.=94\n\nFirst glancing down the hall to make sure=\r\n that they were alone now BIG\nCONVOY turned back to the group, =93Long Rack=\r\n, you have some engineering\nskills, take Sharp Edge and get into the comput=\r\ner system, see what you\ncan make happen.=94\n\nLONG RACK straightened, =93Yes=\r\n sir.=94 He said saluting. SHARP EDGE did\nnot look quite so happy but never=\r\n the less nodded.\n\n=93Night Viper, you and Stampy, see what you an do to ge=\r\nt into\nSaberback=92s room.=94 BIG CONVOY gestured at TUSCON, =93He=92s righ=\r\nt, the\nroom is most likely trapped and maybe even bugged.=94\n\nTurning to MA=\r\nCH KICK and SHARP EDGE, =93You are with us.=94 BIG CONVOY\nsaid, =93We can s=\r\ntill see if we can rescue Rhinox.=94\n\nFinally BIG CONVOY turned to TUSCON, =\r\n=93My mission and My team.=94 He said\nwith a tone of finality. =93Follow if=\r\n you like.=94\n\nAnd like a rubber band that has been pulled taunt and let go=\r\n, the\nentire team leaped into motion.\n\nMACH KICK lightly elbowed TUSCON, =\r\n=93You may be a Prime, but he is a\nConvoy.=94 And then he too moved into ac=\r\ntion.\n\nAnd MACH KICK was right, it was the same thing that LONG RACK was\ngo=\r\ning to remind him of. CONVOY=92s were a rare breed, and it is quite\npossibl=\r\ne that in his limited experience TUSCON had never really had a\nchance to wo=\r\nrk with one. They were soldiers who were at one point a\nPRIME, but were ele=\r\nvated to work with the MAGNUS or sent or\nspecialized missions =96 like this=\r\n one, to bring back war criminals to\njustice.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
