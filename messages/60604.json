He was alive and well, at least physically. He \ngrabbed the rim of the pod&#39;s hatch with one hand and pulled himself \nfree. In the other hand, though, he carried something... no, it was \nsomeone, or rather had been.\n\nTemplar got out, carrying in his arms the shell of Umbral, a slender \nwoman-bot, locked in pain through death. A massive blasthole was \ncentered on her chest, surrounded by smaller blaster shots on the \nrest of her body.\n\nThe bodyguard laid her down wordlessly and started piling leaves on \nher. After she was covered, he kneeled and started crying quietly...\n\nTemplar: Let this be your final resting place, dear Umbral...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Ok\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord Opened the door and looked the male inside and siad &quot;Are \n&gt; you... alright?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Templar is actually functional.
