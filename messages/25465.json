Hell Beast, who was still a bit \nill, slept mostly.\n    &quot;According to this screen Megatron, Killfests team is held up here.&quot; \nBlack Aracnia said. She stood before the viewscreen displaying the battle \narea. &quot;I believe is used to be yours and Kitkats former base.&quot;\n    Megatron thought a moment. Wht the hell would Killfest go to that heap? \nIt was decimated, destroyed. Surely he couldnt hope to settle himself and his \nforces there. But, prehaps he had a trick up his sleeve. Mabey he was looking \nfor something....mabey Megatron missed something very important that Killfest \nknew about.\n    &quot;Hmm, very interesting indeed. Mabey we shall put off the attack on the \nMaximals and hit Killfest and his men agian. Here.&quot; He pointed one large \ntransmetal purple finger to the rock quarry to the east of the cave. \n    &quot;If we got them there, we could finish them alomst.&quot; Tarantulas said, \nfrom behinde a computer terminal. &quot;But dont you think Killfest would be \nexpecting us?&quot;\n    Megatron did take that into consideration. Killfest was clever, but he \nand his men were damaged. Megatrons men had the advantage of being repaired. \nIf they did strike Killfest, Megatron and his men would have the upper hand.\n    &quot;I want to scout it out first. Nighteyes, and Waspinator, you will go and \nsend back any images you record.&quot; Megatron said, turing to them.\n    Nighteyes bowed her panther head. &quot;If Megatron says it, it is to be done. \nI will go.&quot;\n    Waspinator buzzed over to Megatron and began to praise his leader for \nsuch an important task. Megatron swatted them away and sent them to see what \nKillfest was up to. ...And if they were spotted, and Killfest did open fire, \nMegatron guessed he woul;d have no choice but to engage him agian. And after \nthat, agian, and agian, and agian.\n\n    Ominous watched his four troops enter the Orb. For now Quasar was in the \nship. She wouldnt get far, not in the Ord. It was like a giant energon \nreactor, one wrong move and she could vaporize herself.\n    &quot;Putnam, where is Darkmouse?&quot; He demanded, slamming his fist agianst a \nsmall side table. His tone of voice was angry.\n    Putnam held out his arms in defeat. &quot;They alluded us sir. Once we repair, \nwe shall go back. Mabey, under your leadership?&quot; He said.\n    Ominous waved them away in disgust, away to the Energon CR Chambers. He \nsupposed he would need to lead them into battle next time. ut, for now, he \nwas going to get that little arachnid Quasar.\n\n"}}
