Finally, with the soothing sounds of Starice�s speech, she \nmanaged to slip into a peaceful rest.\nIn what dreams a baby her size could ever have, there were clouds with stars \nin them and around them too. There was no moon, but soft music was all \naround. Soothing and slow. And from somewhere, the sounds of singing words \ncame, even beyond the blue/black sky that was all around the clouds.\n� Somewhere, secretly,\nwe�de all like to go.\nSomewhere safe in dreams,\nWhere no one else can go.\nAway from the crowd, where no one can find us,\nWith night all tumbling down. Where we tumble and slide on a magical ride.\nDon�t wake, you�d have to come down.�\nThat was mommy! The same soothing sounds even though the tiny one couldn�t \nmake out words yet.\nBut the baby remembered because it was the last thing she had heard that was \nrecognized as mommy. Well, almost. There was one last thing that her mother \nhad said to her.\n� Goodnight, my little Queen of the Meadows. My beautiful Eyebright.�\nAnd from there there was nothing else. Never again had she heard the song of \nher mother, or taste her milk, feel the warmth of her side or smell her \nscent. And never again would she know those things, and soon even, she would \nforget them. But one thing her tiny mind would hang onto and would always, \n��Queen of the Meadows, �beautiful Eyebright.�\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
