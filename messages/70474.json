A good friend always knows what his comrade is thi=\r\nnking, and no matter how saddened one is, he can always feel good that he h=\r\nas friends standing beside him.  It&#39;s very good to know I have you and the =\r\nothers for support. I should consider myself very lucky to be a part of a p=\r\nowerful merger of factions.  Now, Rodimus&#39;s health is declining, and I have=\r\n more than enough spark to share.  I think it is time that you allow me to =\r\nattempt a form of energy transfusion.  It may be his only hope of recovery.=\r\n&quot;\n\nHe establishes a com link to Stanton and Legacy.\n\n&quot;Stanton, Legacy, I am=\r\n more than honored to have you working so diligantly on saving Rodimus Prim=\r\ne, and now it is my turn to give something back in exchange for the undaunt=\r\ning dedication you are showing our factions.  My spark has more than enough=\r\n power to transfuse energy from my body into his.  Not to worry, I will not=\r\n go off line.  It may be our only hope of saving Rodimus Prime.  It is not =\r\na request, it is my order.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll=\r\n &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As everyone leaves the medical b=\r\nay itself Santon, Bump and Legacy get\n&gt; to work on Rodimus Prime. They quic=\r\nkly began to carefully strip away\n&gt; the tendrils or tentacle like things th=\r\nat sit on top of his frame.\n&gt; Carefully, one by one they scan each one and =\r\nthen carefully cut it so\n&gt; that it do as little damage as possible to Rodim=\r\nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; So now that the Autobots are few in numbers, you th=\r\nink you can just take\n&gt; &gt; over this universe as if you were an unstoppable =\r\ndeity. You&#39;ve harmed far\n&gt; &gt; too many of those I care for. And what you&#39;ve =\r\ndone to Rodimus,\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight, Windlord and Perceptor, are inexcuseable. =\r\nYou have no right\n&gt; &gt; to the power you seek, and I will see to it that you =\r\nnever get your hands\n&gt; &gt; on it. You think you are powerful just because you=\r\n have Megatron and\n&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s strength within your spark? That means n=\r\nothing because you\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t got what truely matters, and that kind of po=\r\nwer is not given, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; earned.

He\n&gt; had been standing in the room from before Tuscon had entered=\r\n, his\n&gt; optics never leaving Rodimus&#39; frame. His arms were crossed over his=\r\n\n&gt; chest, his optics focused and bright as they looked through the\n&gt; window=\r\n. He spoke without turning, &quot;We fuzors stand with you.&quot; he said\n&gt; quietly, =\r\nhis voice low with that air of dramatics that always seemed\n&gt; to be a part =\r\nof him. &quot;The black villany that has been worked on\n&gt; Rodimus must be avenge=\r\nd.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Noctorro and Airhammer nodded as they stood next to Silverbolt.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;is all Alright?&quot;said dryly the Predacon whe sensed that so=\r\nmething unusual\n&gt; &gt; was happening to Tucson Prime.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup looked at Tu=\r\ncson and waited his answetr as well as Talon\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; From inside th=\r\ne medical chamber a small alarm began to beep, and\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s voice could b=\r\ne heard, &quot;Rodimus Prime&#39;s vitals are continuing\n&gt; to decline.
