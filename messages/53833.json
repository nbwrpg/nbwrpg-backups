He watches\n&gt;Rodimus&#39;s worried look as Nightlight takes cover.  He launches another ten\n&gt;shots at Perceptor while still on the run.  He stops near Rodimus Prime.\n&gt;&quot;I&#39;m thankful for your aid, Maximal but your comrade is in greater danger\n&gt;than I.  And when I defeat these Predacon scum I&#39;m afraid you will be next \n&gt;if\n&gt;you choose to stay.&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharla con tus amigos en lï¿½nea mediante MSN Messenger:  \nhttp://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n\n\n"}}
