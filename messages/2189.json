I know the meaning to a powerful \n character, and that&#39;s not the way to go. You&#39;re just going to write anything \n you like, and confuse the heck out of everyone else. I don&#39;t watch \n wrestling, so you will confuse me! Don&#39;t do that. You don&#39;t see me bringing \n in a nighthorse from Rider at the Gate do ya? I like it, but I&#39;m not \n introducing them to the RP. Because they have no place in Beast Wars. Bots \n wrestling, yeah right. Can we get back to the reality factor? &gt;&gt;\n\nIt&#39;s your choice Code, but its just a plainly dumb idea.  Kind of like if \nbrought in a Mohammed Ali (the boxer) character.  Or if I brought in The \nFlash, Batman, or something else.  But, Talon, Cybertronians may wrestle for \na sport, that hasn&#39;t been proved or disproved though.  But a pro wrestler \nwanna be has no place in the RPG.  This isn&#39;t an RPG on Cybertron&#39;s wrestling \nposition or WWF, it&#39;s about a little place called Past Earth to decide the \nfate of Cybertron and Earth, and the galaxy, losing will cause Cybertron to \nbe destroyed, the Decepticons ultimately dying out, after the Autobots are \nall but dead.  Earth nothing but a dry dust ball with no energy, or life.\n\n"}}
