But Cygnar&#39;s suggestion made \nsense, even though it left the Phoenix hungry.\n\nTyrael: So what you talk about is no more and no less than a common \nfront against Hydras. My group is a small one though. Our firepower \nand battle ability is not feeble, but the Predacons are a ferocious \nlot. If we are to attack them, the Maximals will have to be the \nbackbone of the force.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;        &quot;Actually I&#39;m suggesting something quite different from both \nof \n&gt; those.&quot;  He looks at both of his fellow commanders intently.  &quot;You \nare after \n&gt; all both my enemies.  You always will be, you must understand that. \n I am \n&gt; merely suggesting that we put our differences aside to eliminate a \ncommon \n&gt; threat.  We will be allied until this battle is over.  Once Hydras \nis no \n&gt; more, we may discuss further agreements.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
