Some battle just\n&gt; don&#39;t go as planned. I mean, if every battle was easy, the maximals\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be around right now. So don&#39;t talk baddly about our leader\n&gt; like that. Besides, the only reason I&quot;m even thinking about this is\n&gt; to do this FOR Megatron. Got it? A warrior doesn&#39;t turn tratior on\n&gt; thier leader. No matter how bad it sometimes looks. &quot; She turned and\n&gt; faced the others. She smiled,&quot;Now then, first we need to see what it\n&gt; is we plan to take over. The ship it&#39;s self. We need to know the\n&gt; skematics of the ship and all the possable ways to get in and if need\n&gt; be, get out. Then we come up with a plan of attack.  First off, we\n&gt; need plans of the ship.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit:: turned towards land Mine.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Of course getting killed is bad.
