Anachronox could.\n\nThe large bot inside the renewal chamber twitched, then started to \nmove. Inside the chamber, Anachronox&#39; eyes opened to a blurry world. \nHis vision quickly clear and he realized that there was simply a \nbarrier between him and the what was beyond.\n\nMoving his arm, he bumps the covering. A tapping sound can be heard \non the outside. Anachronox frowns, glancing downward, he spots his \nlegs and slams one knee forward into the shell with no result other \nthat a heavy thud. Starting to become frustrated, his arms and legs \nsimultaneously hit the shell, this time the thud reverbrates around \nin nearby rooms.\n\nDeciding that alternate approach to freedom was necessary, his legs \ntense up, and four spikes lance outward, piercing the shell loud \ncrack. A fracture line appears moving up the shell to the upper \ntorso area. Anachronox smiles at this, &lt;a little more&gt; he thinks, \n&lt;just a little more&gt;. The spikes retract, then slam outward again, \nthis time shattering the lower portion of the shell and suficiently \nweakening the top half. Glass shards are sprayed everywhere. \nAnachronx then uses his upper body to spray the remaining piece of \nthe shell away from him and towards the unfortunate bot Belthassan \nwho was standing in front of the once complete renewal chamber.\n\nTaking his first steps, Anachronox pushes himself out, and crouches \nas best he can on the shard covered floor. Apparently oblivious to \nthe other bot he observs his surroundings, face pointing downward \nand still in crouch. His hematite black form shivers as he flexes \nhis techno-organic muscles, and twists his arms testing out his \nform. &lt;I have just been created... or have I? I can remember things, \nbut I am not in the memories...&gt; His thoughts are of confusion but \nhe appears statuesque as he ponders this question. He only utters \none word, &quot;Anachronox...&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Daemos: No, not for now. If you allow me, I will attend to those \n&gt; difficulties and contact you as soon as I am done. Shadow Destiny \nout.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few moments later, Belthassan heard a loud scream. Knowing \nsomething \n&gt; was wrong, he ran to the Renewal Chamber. When he arrived, he saw \nthe \n&gt; large form of the robot, though he did not recognize him. However, \nhe \n&gt; had his idea on the matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: Firedrill? Is that you?\n\n\n"}}
