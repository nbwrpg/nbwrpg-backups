It knocked her down \nand she gave a loud yelp.  She got up and tried to run as fast as she could \nthrough the trees.  She saw Quickstike behind a tree and got beind another \ntree near him and crouched behind it.\n&quot;You got a place we can go to? I&#39;m hit and you don&#39;t look so good yourself. \nYou OK? Can you still run or are we just going to stand and fght?&quot;\n\n\n-------Original Message----------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Quickstrike/Cheetor:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Quickstrike was surprised to see another bot coming out of the forest, \n&gt;going\n&gt;for the Maximal. She sounded Predacon, thank Primus. He gave her quick eye\n&gt;contact. She ran at the spot where Cheetor was twice. The third time, he \n&gt;saw\n&gt;him rush out. He heard him growl, throwing his legs out to run. That was\n&gt;Cheetor? But that thing was nothing but a pile of fur and spots.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;What in tarnation?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;But after a few seconds some of it made some sense. Before the youth had a\n&gt;flight mode, being all metal, he was once a pure cheetah.\n&gt;\n&gt;He ran after him. He fired at the youth, at his flank. But the shot went\n&gt;past him.\n&gt;\n&gt;He saw the youth spin around and transform. He withdrew a gun and fired at\n&gt;them. He fired at KitKat, then three times at himself. Quickstrike nearly\n&gt;stumbled. He almost lost his leg from the shot, but he managed to dash to a\n&gt;tree.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
