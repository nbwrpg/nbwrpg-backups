I approved finding Vector Sigma on\n&gt; Cybertron.  Bringing it here \n&gt; is something else entirely.  So Kyle, your post is\n&gt; void, however, LN although \n&gt; it&#39;s nice to know why a ship is coming and where\n&gt; it&#39;s coming from it isn&#39;t \n&gt; mandatory.  As for acting on my decision alone, the\n&gt; only reason I approved \n&gt; his request is because, I think there&#39;s precedent\n&gt; for Vector Sigma and the \n&gt; Organic Core, but I&#39;ll check that when I have some\n&gt; free time.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nCheck out Yahoo!
