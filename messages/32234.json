He fought hard against the effects forcing his body to\nmove to the side and turn jsut barely dodgeing hte income shots. He\ncontinued to fight the effects but to no avail as his body stopped\nmoving.\nHe looked to the bot that had shot him and focusing all his energy he\nwas able to send a surge of it to his shouldermounted grenade launcher\nand fired off three emp grenades before once again becoming immobolized.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ( Carnage: Wonderful to see your fingers pressed to the keyboard\nonce again, FireFox.)\n&gt;\n&gt; ** Dinobot&#39;s face was directed towards the battle, optics narrowed\nand obviously scanning the area for suitable and challenging targets\nwhich would be worth the wounds he might be inflicted with. However,\nit was this battle that he would try to remain clean from gashes and\nthe possibility of being gored.  With his attention now on the chaos\nall around him, he barely even acknowledged Tavatron&#39;s speech before\nmoving towards the Cybertronian Fire like he had instructed moments\nago. However, sensing that her presence wasn&#39;t near, his scanners\nwavered towards the Maximal ship, discovering her form before turning\nthem back towards the battle. Suddenly his instincts slipped, the\nultra-aggressive tendencies of his highly unstable transmetal 2 form\nzeroed in on the first of an enemy, which might catch his attention.\n&gt; Dinobot had not chosen this prey on his own, though his beast mode\nhad played too large a role in doing so then would be wise for\ncomfort. However, it&#39;s selection was nothing he could argue with, for,\nhe agreed fully.\n&gt; FireBlade.\n&gt; In yet, the dastardly creature was almost half way across the\nbattlefield from his current position, but distracted so Dinobot might\ngain the objective of surprise after all. Though he would never depend\non such luck, so any way to gain ground on that person was ticking\nthrough his mind.   With Tavatron out of the way for concern there was\nnothing stopping him from waging his own war, though he wanted to make\nit to FireBlade&#39;s position without having to contend with other\nenemies which might threaten to take his concentration away from his\ntrue objective.\n&gt; It was then that Dinobot began to move across the field, however, in\na way so that no others would notice him.\n&gt; Stealth was a prime factor, and it wasn&#39;t long before FireBlade came\nwithin firearm striking distance.\n&gt; Dinobot raised the weapon he held in his claws,yet, charged and\nfired the paralyzing effects of his optic laser before firing with the\ngun.  The enemy would be rendered defenseless before his ruin became a\nreality. **\n&gt;\n&gt; ( Carnage: If any of my post is not correct, please feel free to\nright my wrongs.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at\nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
