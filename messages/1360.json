There was somebot approaching! She looked back at\nGangon\n&gt; and growled as she motioned towards the south/west.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hay! There&#39;s somebot coming! Transform.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * BrightBlade looked off towards the south/west and saw a shape walking\n&gt; towards them, she transformed into robot mode and took out her weapon.\n&gt; As her and Gangon stood on a rise she aimed her gun at the approaching\nbot,\n&gt; it&#39;s signature telling her that it was a Maximal.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hay! You! Stop where you are or you&#39;ll be blown to scrap! Don&#39;t you have\n&gt; any clue that you&#39;re trespassing on Lord Hell Beast&#39;s land?! He wants none\n&gt; of your kind around here and frankly neither do I!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She began to make her way down towards the new bot and glared at her\nwhen\n&gt; she came close enough to shot at point blank range. BrightBlade looked at\n&gt; the Maximal (Plintissa) and growled, she scanned to see if Gangon was\n&gt; following her.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Drop what ever weapons you have and state why you&#39;re here before I get\n&gt; impatient and blow your slagin head of. Not one known for patients...or\n&gt; Maximals for that matter.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * BrightBlade brought her gun up to a height that if Plintissa decided to\n&gt; act funny she would be able to just as she claimed she would. She called\n&gt; over her shoulder to Gangon.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Get your butt down here, we got ourselves a Maximals straggler!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that said she turned her attention back to Plintissa.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/10/_/_/_/958250036/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
