It \n&gt; always worked, she had to give credit to that.\n&gt; \n&gt; She watched him roll over and sit up, but seeing him clench his jaw \nin pain.\n&gt; Iron Raptor simply shifted her position and looked towards him, \nseeing if \n&gt; there was any other damage. There was none other then a few \nscratches and \n&gt; his broken wing.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You hit a few branches, disconnected your processor and broke \nyour wing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But there was a tone of anger in her voice as well as concern. If \nhe \n&gt; hadn&#39;t tried to grab her this would have never happened.\n&gt; She growled.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And if you ever pull a stunt like that again it won&#39;t be branches \nthat do \n&gt; that to you next time!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then got to all four of her feet and glared towards \nProwl, her \n&gt; eyes narrowed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Now get back to base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
