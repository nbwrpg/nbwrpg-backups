None of this\npost\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; moding, Plintissa&#39;s memories are really how it happened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa walked closer to Iron Raptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Iron Raptor...Goodbye.&quot; Plintissa walked out of the room, walking down\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; the main room of the Maximal base, just standing in the center of the\n&gt; room.\n&gt; &gt; Apparently, Iron Raptor is in love. Plintissa cried, she was in love as\n&gt; &gt; well, but her love had changed, for the better in power, for the worst\n&gt; &gt; overall. Then Plintissa remembered what Suukie had once said to her, the\n&gt; &gt; memory echoed in her head...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In Plintissa&#39;s memory, the Maximals were all against her, and her only\n&gt; &gt; friend was also against her. Plintissa sat down in her base, Suukie in\nthe\n&gt; &gt; CR Chamber, the one sentence that started up their conversation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about those Maximal fools, I think your cool.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Once they grew to love each other, right before Plintissa left for the\n&gt; &gt; Maximal base, that was the next memory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I have to leave now Suukie, but I&#39;ll be back after I sort this out with\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor and that idiot Liono, I just wish that Iron Raptor would\n&gt; return\n&gt; &gt; my calls.&quot; Plintissa sighed and walked toward the door.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t be blue, I love you!&quot; Came Suukie&#39;s screwed up mind&#39;s rhyming\n&gt; voice.\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa smiled and walked out the door.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I love you too.&quot; Plintissa said as she walked out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa remembered and cried harder. Plintissa dropped to the floor,\n&gt; &gt; making a puddle of tears in front of everyone, since she had no room in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Maximal base, she never did have one, she was always trying to help\n&gt; out.She\n&gt; &gt; terribly missed Iron Raptor, Dracona sometimes was close to her, but\n&gt; Dracona\n&gt; &gt; was always so far away mentally that it was impossible for them to be\n&gt; &gt; friends. Plintissa remembered whan she first met Iron Raptor, and when\nshe\n&gt; &gt; first met Suukie.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey! I found a stasis pod out here! Doesn&#39;t anyone care?&quot; Plintissa had\n&gt; &gt; yelled. That&#39;s when she appeared. Iron Raptor. She came outside of the\n&gt; base,\n&gt; &gt; she was looking at a library, but was interupted by Plintissa&#39;s\nscreaming.\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa remembered what Iron Raptor had said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Temper, temper.&quot; Were Iron Raptor&#39;s first words to her. Iron Raptor and\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa joked around and they fixed the stasis pod. Out emerged a big\n&gt; &gt; plecostomus, Suukie. Suukie instantly ran off after saying hello to the\n2,\n&gt; &gt; running off to help someone, which Plintissa later learned were Dinobot\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Tavatron, who were now good friends. Iron raptor said one word after\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa ran away to join battle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You SQUID!&quot; Were Iron Raptor&#39;s words, Iron Raptor and Plintissa had a\n&gt; close\n&gt; &gt; encounter with Rampage, where Iron Raptor saved Plintissa&#39;s life, while\n&gt; &gt; Plintisssa passed out from pain. Iron Raptor was premoted to 3rd in\n&gt; command,\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa didn&#39;t even get a position in the Maximal army, but stuck\naround\n&gt; &gt; anyway. Plintissa had several run-ins with Liono after that, and had\n&gt; &gt; challenged him, but he did not accept, and like the coward that he was,\nat\n&gt; &gt; least to Plintissa, he ran from her and sicked Key on her. Plintissa\n&gt; ignored\n&gt; &gt; Key completely, she was angry. Plintissa then made her own group, and\n&gt; that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; where it all came in now, Suukie is dead, her group is dead, and her\n&gt; &gt; friendship with Iron Raptor was dead. In short words, Plintissa&#39;s long\n&gt; life,\n&gt; &gt; from Pred, to Maxi, to Populist, was now and forever, over. Plintissa\n&gt; weeped\n&gt; &gt; on the floor...\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, June 23, 2000 6:09 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Iron Raptor smiled as she saw Prowl&#39;s weak smile but concern\neventually\n&gt; &gt; made it&#39;s way to her optics, worried for the pain that his broken ribs\n&gt; &gt; caused. The kiss on her cheek reminded her of the same kisses that they\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; shared in her quarters only a mega-cycle and a half ago, wishing that\nshe\n&gt; &gt; could rewind time and try to prevent his damage. Half closing her optics\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; a way that meant that ,&quot;knowing&quot; way when he replied to her statement of\n&gt; &gt; not being able to handle her cure for pain. But she then saw Prowl\nnearly\n&gt; &gt; lose his balance and was ready to stop him from falling if needed, he\nwas\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; hurt and that fact hurt her just as much then.causing her casual look to\n&gt; &gt; become concern.\n&gt; &gt; Him then stumbling back as Shadow Cat came up to them causing her to\ncome\n&gt; &gt; closer to him in worry, how could a few broken ribs cause him to act\nlike\n&gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; Soon the pains of her own damage was over ruled by concern as Prowl\ntakes\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; step towards a CR chamber but doesn&#39;t quite make it! Seeing him almost\ncry\n&gt; &gt; out in pain Iron Raptor rushed to his side just in time to hear the hiss\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; pop of his damage, then seeing him slump to the floor and his repair\n&gt; system\n&gt; &gt; begin to activate.\n&gt; &gt; With a quick rush of movement she bent down to him and then took him\nunder\n&gt; &gt; the arms, with the full weight of his damaged body being to heavy she\n&gt; simply\n&gt; &gt; pulled him over to a wall beside a  chamber and then sat him up against\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; Iron Raptor put a worried hand on Prowl&#39;s cheek as she looked into his\n&gt; face\n&gt; &gt; and kneeled beside him, expressionless and without emotion as he stayed\nin\n&gt; &gt; his nearly unconscious state.\n&gt; &gt; She brushed her thumb over his lips before leaning in close and placing\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; own cheek against his other one, the act simply for comfort to let him\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; that she was there with him in his time of need. His repair system\n&gt; obviously\n&gt; &gt; working but the pain might not be fully gone yet, her own presence there\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; him to deal with that.\n&gt; &gt; Her free hand stoked his shoulder for a moment before resting on his\narm,\n&gt; &gt; her voice soft and smooth as not to cause him alarm or suddenly surprise\n&gt; &gt; him.not knowing if he even knew that she was there now.beside him. *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m here, Prowl.My Love. As I&#39;ll always be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Then with a slightly worried sigh but one of slight relaxation she\n&gt; stayed\n&gt; &gt; by his side, waiting for a positive response from the only bot she ever\n&gt; &gt; loved. *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; &gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; &gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
