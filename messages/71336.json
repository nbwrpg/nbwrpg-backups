Wheelie . . . didn&#39;t\n&gt; w=\r\ne . .  uh . . . &quot; He said after a stuttered pause. He seemed like he\n&gt; was =\r\ngoing to say something more to him, perhaps about the fact that he\n&gt; was su=\r\nppose to be at the shuttle guarding it . . . locked in securely.\n&gt; but then=\r\n as if he remembered he was up in front of a full meeting\n&gt; returned his at=\r\ntention to the crowd at large.\n\n&lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n\nAt ths point, Wheelie wave=\r\nd up at Leo Prime, &quot;Alone with the guards, they had me stay.  And then the =\r\nguards curled up and began to cry, and send me away!  So here I came, witho=\r\nut much to do.  Alone and wanting to help along with the rest of you!&quot;\n\nWhe=\r\nelie paused, and continued to contemplate, &quot;Along with a flying shark who w=\r\nrote a Haiku.&quot;  (OOC - Figured I oculd at least toss in a shot out to every=\r\none&#39;s favorite Sky-Byte there!  Not that he&#39;s actually here or anything..)\n=\r\n\n&lt;OLD - Truncated Leo Prime&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Mech&#39;s and Femmes.&quot; He said, his voice =\r\nresuming a measure of\n&gt; professionalism. &quot;You have all given many different=\r\n ideas and\n&gt; suggestions, but there are also things for us to think about.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; He took a moment to look at the different ones present an inviting\n&gt; =\r\nsmile curving upon his lips, &quot;However does anyone know just where the\n&gt; Uni=\r\ncronians are yet?&quot; LEO turned to look at the others in the room,\n&gt; &quot;Or what=\r\n are their current goals and strategies?&quot; There was no anger\n&gt; or a putting=\r\n of anyone down as he spoke, just helping them to see\n&gt; points. &quot;Does anyon=\r\ne know who even is in charge of their people, or\n&gt; even how many of them ar=\r\ne on Earth?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to a different group, &quot;What about the Predacons=\r\n. They are\n&gt; criminals. But I don&#39;t think even =96they- would want to endan=\r\nger their\n&gt; future.&quot; LEO PRIME gestured at the door of the ARK, &quot;Remember d=\r\nuring\n&gt; the battle, Hydras commanded that Optimus Prime and Megatron not be=\r\n\n&gt; hurt or hit. Perhaps he can be reasoned with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME turned to =\r\nthe audience to see what their reaction would be\n&gt; to his suggestions. LEO =\r\nwas not commanding this, but looking for a\n&gt; response.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n=\r\n\nWheelie glanced over and around at the room, listening to the plan of Leo =\r\nPrime, the mission assignment, and then over to the Unicronians, &quot;Chaos the=\r\ny want, chaos they attain.  Just by us being here, we alter what will happe=\r\nn in our name.  Each step in the past, we change the future to leave us agh=\r\nast.  By being here what will be shall not, but will we become what time fo=\r\nrgot?&quot;\n\nWhether that made sense or not, Wheelie plowed ahead, &quot;And remain h=\r\nere we must, for more I fear, what shall happen if we do not remain here?  =\r\nWith the Unicronians about, Chaos at it&#39;s best, shall we leave now they sha=\r\nll take charge of the cascading crest.&quot;\n\nAnd then, as to the plan, &quot;Well, i=\r\nf we don&#39;t know what they&#39;re going to do, then we&#39;ll have to work it out fr=\r\nom them, and so shall the rest of you!&quot;\n\nPointing his fingers about, &quot;What =\r\nthey seem to love is the leaping attack.  So we shall leave a prize out tha=\r\nt they want, and be there when they have a crack.&quot;\n\nWheelie tapping at his =\r\nchin, &quot;What Big Leo said, and Big Shot with him, the Essence of their Fathe=\r\nr calls them to skim.  We&#39;ll say we have some of their Dad, they&#39;ll come ra=\r\nging about. We&#39;ll have nothing of the sort, then we&#39;ll blast them about!&quot;\n\n=\r\nOOC - If we&#39;re using cameos from Beast Wars II and Beast Wars Neo, then tha=\r\nt certainly means some form of Angolmois is in existence - (http://tfwiki.n=\r\net/wiki/Angolmois).  Which if Leo Prime is the same character from Beast Wa=\r\nrs II/Neo, then he would know of it.  Which could basically (according to W=\r\nheelie&#39;s idea, at least), have the presence of (which I assume the Bots/Max=\r\nimals don&#39;t have any of), but the clues or information of having some dropp=\r\ned to try and lure Cyclonus et all into a trap.\n\n\n"}}
