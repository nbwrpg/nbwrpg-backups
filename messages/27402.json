Not in her chest...yet.\n\n* Iron Raptor looked over the enemy carefully before her attention was \nsuddenly grabbed by the feeling of somebot staring at her.\nLooking towards the direction the feeling was comeing from her eyes fell on \nSun Crusher.\nHe was glaring at her chest!\nBut slag where he was looking, with the way his optics seemed to be on her \nhe was probably sizing her up as some target. Her fingers itched to reach \nfor the handle of her sword, but with controle she kept them right where \nthey were.\n&lt; Let him make the first move. So I can collect energy.&gt;\nHer eyes were on his when he decided to look up from her chest and meet her \nown glare, her face fixed in a look of studied aggression under her helm.\nIf he and his fellow bots didn&#39;t take her advice and leave he&#39;d know what it \nwas to deal with a Maximal commander who would rather see them dead then \ninside of the brig.\nIron Raptor had a hate for her enemies, a hate that could lead to both \ntrouble or victory.\nBut she was kinda puzzled when he finally talked, ordering her to give him \nwhat was in her chest.\nHer spark?\nBut that couldn&#39;t be it, it basically had no power. It was her whole body \nwhich had the power.\nBut Sun Crusher&#39;s intensions were clear when he suddenly tomd her that it \nwas the Matrix he wanted and not her spark, still confusing her for a \nsecond.\nBut...the Maximal Matrix was in her leg, not her chest.\nShe glared at him.*\n\n&quot; As enemies of the Maximals your words mean nothing to me. Besides, the \nMatrix isn&#39;t in my chest, dolt!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor unlocked the hatch to her leg armor where the Matrix sat.*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s in...my.............&quot;\n\n* When she looked...it wasn&#39;t there!!\nThe Matrix wasn&#39;t there!\nWhere was it?!*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s gone!!&quot;\n\n* Panic struck her spark before her systems suddenly noticed that in the \npaniced rate of her spark there was something different.\nDifferent as in...something that wasn&#39;t there before.\n&lt; It IS in my spark! It has to be, otherwise what&#39;s that feeling?&quot;\nThe Matrix had somehow disappeared from her armor and was sitting snug right \nin the center of her spark where her life source sat.\nMysteries of the Matrix was a distent thought in her mind.\nHer panic ceased and she looked back towards Sun Crusher, looking him over \nwith a look on her face that expressed distaste...even though he couldn&#39;t \nsee it.*\n\n&quot; Yeah...right. Like I&#39;ll hand it to YOU. Now get lost before you annoy me, \nlittle man.&quot;\n\n* Her spark was still thudding with the panic as it wore off, regaining her \ncomposure. Her hands rested on her hips as she looked across the field at \nhim.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
