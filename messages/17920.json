She turned her back to her and worked on the \ncomputer, gathering the info.  She wasn&#39;t really happy with this bot. \nSomething about her felt fake. But she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. \nHer mongoose insticts told her that there was a snake near by. She \nglanced back at LadyHawk and smiled. Then turned back to the computer \nconsole. She watched as the printer printed up the sheets and she \nfolded them up and placed them on the counter for later on.  \n\nHer sweet, innocent, friendly nature would give her the advantage.  \nShe only played at being this little helpless bot that was just so \nhelpful.  She was still new enough to this group that she couldn&#39;t do \nanything.  She wondered seince she was no fighter, if she could work \nher way up through the ranks and see just how far she could go.  She \nwasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to stay with these bots yet or not.  Sh \nalso wasn&#39;t sure if they were the strongest group around. IF they \nwere the best, she would stay with them. If not, she would learn all \nshe could and then turn over the info to the strongest group. Her \nsurvival insticts were on full swing.  For her, insticts were a more \ninvolved thought proccess, not just a gut feeling.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk curled up in a corner with her wings folded around her. \nSquizzy\n&gt; might not be entirely incompetent after all, &quot;If there are any \nproblems wake\n&gt; me, with any luck you&#39;ll turn out to be a usefull lackey yet.&quot; she \nclosed\n&gt; two of her eyes, keeping the third one active and on Squizzy.\n\n\n\n"}}
