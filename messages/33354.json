Of course you do!\nOkay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves well because\nit&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, it&#39;s where you are\nwhen you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime to leave the base, it&#39;s\n&gt; also where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got all these cool computers and\nstuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s where we are right now! Isn&#39;t that a\ncoincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s a nice room maybe a little too dusty but\nthen again maybe not and it&#39;s a good room because it has lots of room, and\nit\n&gt; leads into all of the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the biggest rooms,\nwhich is good, because everyone might try to come in at the same time, and\nif they do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be crowded and the\nbase might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might happen like\n&gt; someone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone will get\nshot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t think I did,\ncorrect me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong because I&#39;m right. Anyway,\nI&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s your name, I&#39;m not calling you\n&gt; Squawktalk, that would be silly, wouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have a nice name,\nyou probably do, but I still hope, because hoping can get you stuff\nsometimes, and anyway, it&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should be nice\nbecause my name is cool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I was trying\nto say\n&gt; is that maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to the next\nroom? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and we&#39;ll be in\nthe next one instead and I can talk to you in there just hurry up and don&#39;t\ntake forever, okay?...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
