But then he decided to speed \nup the pace of this little meeting, Dinobot began to strike faster and not \njust at Scourge&#39;s head and chest. He struck at his legs and arms, his \nshoulders and his neck. Finally he drew back with one hand and sent his claw \ntowards Scourge&#39;s spark cavity, it was so fast that the air whistled as the \nclaw cut through it.\nDinobot growled deeply as he sent his claw for a deathly collision towards \nhis enemies spark, sooner or later he would have this bot&#39;s spark!\nHe had no time to let her know but he knew that Tavatron was only a few \nsteps away, just in the reach of Scourge!\nDinobot roared as he targeted with his laser site and fired at Scourge&#39;s \noptic, he&#39;d be to busy defending himself from his swipes to defend his optic \nfrom a sudden attack.\nHe didn&#39;t even want this tyrant near Tavatron, he was having trouble with \nhim, he didn&#39;t want her to end up dealing with the same thing!*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
