IT&#39;S NOT FAIR!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;legendarynemasis&quot; &lt;Legendarynemasis@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Whee, a long overdue post. This was approved by the council, so \n&gt; whee. Now then without further adu, the end of the Alliance island \n&gt; debate.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bamphomet looked to Blacknightmare for a moment as she addressed \n&gt; him as &quot;master.&quot; Immediately his visor began to glow red as the \nsmall \n&gt; Infecticon god seemingly became agitated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bamphomet: &quot;You now adress me as master when ebfore you would not. \n&gt; Your programming is setting in. But now you insult me by looking at \n&gt; me. No unworthy mortal has the right to look upon their god! Now \nlook \n&gt; away or I shall burn your optics out from where I stand and render \n&gt; you blind. As for you Chaostaur, I shall give you a demonstration of \n&gt; my creations powers and how your resistance is completely, and \n&gt; utterly futile.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the Bamphomet says this a viewscreen appears in the room which \n&gt; shows a birds eye view of the alliance&#39;s island base. Or whats left \n&gt; of it. The bamphomet then begins to glow a pale blue as back in at \n&gt; the Fury cannon main base, lucenite also glows a pale blue and then \n&gt; presses a red button. In the sky a massive pillar of energy once \n&gt; again rises from the see, evaporating whatever water and destroying \n&gt; anything that is in its path. At the same sime three seperate \nsmaller \n&gt; cannon sites at their respective locations all fire at the same \ntime. \n&gt; The three smaller cannon beams are the first to penetrate the earths \n&gt; atmosphere and enter space where they strike one of the dishes of \nthe \n&gt; Infecticon satelite and soon dissapear. The dish then enlarges a \n&gt; great deal as the massive pillar of energy from the fury cannon \n&gt; collides with it and is quickly absorbed. \n&gt; \n&gt; After a few tense moments of silence, the satelite then transforms \n&gt; yet again into a massive dish that sends out a gigantic beam fo \n&gt; eneergy barrelling down back at the Earth. On the view screen, the \n&gt; pillar of energy quickly encompasses the view and then from all over \n&gt; the world a bright flash can be seen before a gigantic explosion \n&gt; takes place, one so large, it can even be seen from space, and more \n&gt; importantly the sacriligious plague. All voer the planet, the \n&gt; scanners of various bases would pick up the massive blast. \n&gt; \n&gt; After the light dims, and the dust and smoke parts, all that is left \n&gt; of the island is a gigantic crater now burrowed into the oceans \nfloor \n&gt; as the water seems to part away from it. A second later the water \n&gt; then crashes into the now open space. The view screen now focuss on \n&gt; what was at one time the location of the alliances island, which is \n&gt; now nothing but endless waves. The screen then dims and the \nBamphomet \n&gt; chuckles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bamphomet: &quot;You see how easy we can exterminate life here? THere is \n&gt; no point to your resisting us. We are the only faction that will \n&gt; remain. You will either join us or die. If you join us we can \nenhance \n&gt; your body to make you stronger. The choice is yours. But just so you \n&gt; know, the purge has begun. The next target that will be obliteratd \nby \n&gt; my forces shall be what the cybertronians here call &quot;Maximal City.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
