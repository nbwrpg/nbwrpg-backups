She climbed in altitude.  She flet the cold wind \nblow \n&gt; against her face. She could see the light of the sun just creeping \nover the \n&gt; horizon.  She flew north and hoped she would be left alone there.  \nAl she \n&gt; wanted was to survive alone.  She knew she could.  She flew higher \nyet into \n&gt; the air.  She now was way above the mountains and soaring high on \nthe cold \n&gt; winds.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
