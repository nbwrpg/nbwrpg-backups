In it a bulky grey bot \nsits at the controls with an angry look on his face.  He looks over at \na vile of green stuff.  All of a sudden he has a flashback of an \norganic hand sticking out of a green foggish gas as the flesh falls \noff the hand leaving the bone exposed.  Then he sees a bot that looks \nexactly like him, except a Predicon insignia replaces the Maximal one. \nappear.\n\nCopy Bot:  Hello traitor.  Lol.  Still chasing after me.  Trying to \nblame your sins on your own brother.\n\nHe gets a frightened look.\n\nPilot:  ME YOU DID IT!\n\nCB: What did you expect I&#39;m a Predicon.  But a Maximal refusing to \nwarn inicent bystanders even though he had the information.\n\nP:  I THOUGHT YOU WERE MOCKING ME!  IF IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN YOU \nSHOULDN&#39;T HAVE TOLD ME!\n\nCB:  Face it your a Turntail.\n\nHe pauses.\n\nP:  So be it.  May that be my name until the day I kill you.\n\nCB:  You&#39;re just like me.  Lol.\n\nTurntail:  I&#39;M NOT LIKE YOU!\n\nHe slams his fist on the console and the plan crashes towards Africa. \nWhen it lands turntail takes a Rhino Beastmode.\n\n\n"}}
