She was mad. Not at him, but at herself.\n&quot;Look, you showed me how lousy a fighter I am.  How I&#39;m nothing more than an \neasy target.&quot; She was starting to let her emotions take over completely.  \n&quot;You could have killed me in the forest.  You could have shot me. I could be \ndead. You..you proved just how weak I am. How useless I am.  You opened my \neyes as to how I am so stupid in a fight. I tried to be something I&#39;m not.  \nI wanted to be a fighter.  I tried to prove to myself that I could be. And \nyou proved that I am no fighter.  Hell, I&#39;m not good at hiding even. You and \nthat Pred found me easily enough. Matrix knows how I survived in the forest \nby myself all that time.&quot;  She fell to her knees and wept.  Her was mad that \nher spark was so damned emotional.  She was more of her animal counterpart, \nthan a techno-logicle being.\n&quot;Please just take me back to the base and have me reprogrammed or scrapped.&quot;\n\n\n\n---Original Message---\n&gt;From: cyberwolf4@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n\n\n&gt;(Add to my last post) Me? you nearly walked into the hands of a\n&gt;Predicon trying to get away from me?\n&gt;\n&gt;Lunarpine was more confused than ever at this use of &quot;Womans Logic&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She stood there looking at him. &quot;OK, you explain why your on this\n&gt; &gt; recon and I&#39;ll explain why I&#39;m here.&quot; She stood there for a moment.\n&gt; &gt; She realized that her emotions were taking over again.  She sighed.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t be yelling at you like that. I came out\n&gt;here\n&gt; &gt; to get away from the base.
