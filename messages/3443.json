He is operable.  Do you still want to shoot \nhim.  If you reply yes in your next post, I&#39;ll take the damage in my next \npost)\n\n\nDouble Punch/Injector/Counter Punch/Double Punch/Bumblebee/Shockwave:\n\n\n\nDouble Punch smiled.  They hadn&#39;t noticed his stealth mode had been damaged \nand was now off until he let repairs fix it.  Speaking of repairs, who the \nslag was that purple freak that was shooting missiles?!  Raising both pinches \nas he Stegotron still standing he fired two missiles from each pincher.  Two \nat the middle of Stegotron&#39;s back, two at the back of Ultracon&#39;s left knee.  \n&quot;I&#39;ll have to use my stinger if this doesn&#39;t bring them to their knees.&quot;\n\n---\n\nInjector jumped to the left, firing stinger missiles at Stegotron as he \npassed by the near gone tree he had been using for cover, landing behind a \nsmall boulder that wouldn&#39;t last long under fire.\n\n--- \n\nCounter Punch ducked, a shot hitting his left shoulder.  Raising his photon \nrifle with his right arm, he fired off several shots at Ultracon&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee cursed.  Sliding through the air to the left, only one of Dark \nMouse&#39;s shots grazed his right side.  He didn&#39;t seen Triceradon&#39;s grenade.  \nLooking to it, it exploded, launching him through the air.  Regaining \nbalance, his body lightly charred and one of his optics offline and hanging \nout of its &quot;socket&quot;, he raised both launcher, firing three stinger missiles \nfrom each at Dark Mouse, and two optic blasts from his good optic at \nTriceradon.\n\n---\n\nAssessing the battle, Shockwave picked out the weakest of them all.  An \nalready damaged being.  If he was going to kill someone and help his own \ncause, logic would dictate it be a puny Maximal.  Taking out a missile \nlauncher, he used one hand to aim it, raising his laser weapon that was \nimbedded in his hand to give it extra support as he held it, he pulled the \ntrigger, a rocket surging out at Dark Mouse.\n\n\n"}}
