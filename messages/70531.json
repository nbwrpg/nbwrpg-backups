IF\n&gt; YOUR EYES HAVE FAILED YOU, REMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE\n=\r\n&gt; YOUR OTHER SENSES!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was no answer comming from Rodimus save=\r\n for the sound of buzzing\ninsects, there were near and approaching as Tusco=\r\nn moved as best he\ncould along the corridores and tunnels.\n\nThe area here w=\r\nas built like any transit system he was familiar with,\nwith long corridores=\r\n, and signs clearly showing the directions to get\nto one place or another. =\r\nHowever it would seem that the lack of\nmaintainance was taking its toll as =\r\nin some places the lights were dim\nor shut off completely due to lack of po=\r\nwer or quite simply the bulbs\nhad blown out.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; While in the dar=\r\nkness of the tunnels, Tucson could hear a faint voice recalling Perceptor&#39;s=\r\n words which were typed in on the computer. He knew he had to send a messag=\r\ne back to Perceptor to let him know that he was still all right, and well o=\r\nn his way to finding Rodimus. So he looks ahead, and wispers his reply whic=\r\nh can also be heard in the lab.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I will find him and I will bring him =\r\nto saftey. No Autobot abandons his comrades.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIn the tunnels ahead =\r\nTuscon is able to find a communication link as\nthey are seemingly spread ou=\r\nt for convientient use of all who need it,\nor atleast it would be convienie=\r\nnt if there was someone around to\nactually use it.\n\nHowever as Tuscon close=\r\nd the line he could hear the sound of matallic\nscraping sounding very much =\r\nthe same as the sound the spider like\ninsects made that he had met on the s=\r\ntreet. The sound was comming from\nfurther up the hall. The echo and reverb =\r\nalong the corridores made it\nit difficult to locate true positioning, but o=\r\nne thing was for certain\nit was getting louder, they were closing quickly o=\r\nn his location.\n\nIn his arms Vestige coughed, it would seem that he was tak=\r\ning a turn\nfor the worst. he would need time in a repair chamber.\n\n(TAG)\n\nP=\r\nreston\n\n"}}
