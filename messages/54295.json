The elder male \n&gt; meets her gaze and the pair of them stand there for just a moment, \n&gt; looking at each other.  Then Skyblaze walks over and gently takes \n&gt; Phoenix in his arms.  With the tenderness one would show a young \n&gt; child, he traces his finger along the charred lines of the nWo \nbrand \n&gt; on her chestplate.  As he touches the damaged areas, they glow and \n&gt; heal as if she&#39;d never been touched by the torch.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Bless you, child,&quot; he says to her, quietly.  &quot;I was beginning to \n&gt; think I&#39;d never find you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In the back of Phoenix&#39;s mind, memories stir.
