Celeron works to recessitate him.  It takes only ten minutes, finding a small cart in the room, he places the pilot into it and begins the slow trek back to the Captian&#39;s quarters.\n\n&quot;Where am I....?&quot;\n\n&quot;........&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Who are you?&quot;\n\n\n&quot;My name is.....Celeron....and I&#39;m going to...take you to the Captian.&quot;\n\n&quot;Captain?  Where?&quot;\n\n&quot;Up ahead.  Stay with me....&quot;\n\nHe arrives at the Captains quarters and feverously rings the doorbell.  After about 12 minutes of waiting and ringing, the captain opens the door.  He immediatly recognises his subordinate and runs to get is medical supplies.  Celeron wheels the cart in and dumps him on the floor, rather carelessly.\n\n&quot;His pod was running on 20% power, it was hurting him more then it was helping him.  Power has apparently only been off 200 hours.&quot;\n\nBut the Captian was apparently too engrossed in his work for conversation, so Celeron just stood there and watched.\n\n\n--\n\n--------- Original Message ---------\n\nDATE: 19 Jun 2003 09:29:11 -000\nFrom: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nCc: \n\n&gt;\n&gt;There are 6 messages in this issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;Topics in this digest:\n&gt;\n&gt;      1.
