Why didn&#39;t she herself think of that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Stepping off Instrat and flapping her wings, the Fuzor rose higher\n&gt; into the the sky and turned her cloaking on, so no-one could see her.\n&gt; Teltoli watched the trees with emerald eyes, hoping she could catch\n&gt; sight of her friend among the cover.\n&gt;\n&gt; Smelling a faint scent of animal blood, she dove lower and picked up\n&gt; the form of Carnage, lunching on boar. Teltoli smiled and turned her\n&gt; cloaking off, landing a few meters away and neatly folding her wings\n&gt; across her back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Um, sorry for that back there.. I kinda got carried away. This whole\n&gt; day has been so stressful! I mean, first I come out of my Ship, and\n&gt; get attacked by practically the whole Alliance fleet. Then I try go\n&gt; to Maximal Base for help, but they take soooo long in actually\n&gt; getting off their asses, and their ship is still getting attacked.\n&gt; So, I started another Alliance/Maximal war..&quot; The Fuzor sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And &#39;then&#39;, I come to find you, and this stupid bot starts\n&gt; attacking, and my rage just sorta bubbled over. You know how it is..&quot;\n&gt; She trailed off, slightly uneasy by the silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Teltoli shifted her front paws. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not mad at me for\n&gt; leaving before.. I did what I had to do..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Fuzor trailed off again, the end of her voice giving way to the\n&gt; sounds of the forest and her own breathing inside her ears.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
