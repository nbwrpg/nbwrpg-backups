Slaggn&#39; good thing I&#39;m in vehicle mode!&quot;\n\nHe puts h=\r\nimself into drive, spins his tires, and quickly finds Rat Trap, who is quic=\r\nk to jump up onto his hood.\n\n&quot;Heey, what&#39;s the rush?!&quot;\n\nNight Shift puts do=\r\nwn his driver&#39;s side window.\n\n&quot;I was sniffed out when I was in communicatio=\r\nn with Rodimus.  I dunno how the slag we got sniffed but we got sniffed.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRat Trap gets in and now looks into the rear view mirror.\n\n&quot; What the?!  Aw=\r\n maaaan, I hope you got enough gas ta get us outa here!&quot;\n\nNight Shift accel=\r\nerates quickly to try and get ahead of the horde.\n\n&quot; About a little less th=\r\nan a full tank, lucky for us, I had just fueled up before we left.

HOLD ON, I JUST BLEW A TIRE!&quot;\n\nHe swerves out =\r\nof control for a moment while Rat Trap does his best to try and keep the wh=\r\neel into the skid, hoping to find an opportunity to straighten Night Shift =\r\nout to the point where he can actually control him.\n\n&quot;Ease off the gas, and=\r\n let yourself slow down.&quot;\n\nNight Shift does as told, but not in time to avo=\r\nid a slight hit to his side fender.\n\n&quot;Ow!  Ughhh, what the pit did I hit?&quot;\n=\r\n\nRat Trap looks out the passenger&#39;s side.\n\n&quot;I dunno, but you got a nice den=\r\nt on your side fender buddy.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonu=\r\ns &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap squeaks out of su=\r\nrprise, but then realizes that the body is\n&gt; lifeless. Heaving a sigh of re=\r\nlief, he takes a moment to scan the area, and\n&gt; sniff the air. It wreaked o=\r\nf enemy signatures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like this.. Night Shift, we got defini=\r\nte Minion and Insecticon\n&gt; signatures all around this place. I got a feel&#39;n=\r\n that if we&#39;re gonna get\n&gt; Cheetor outa here, we&#39;re gonna need some backup.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He sends the feed back to Night Shift.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the duo=\r\n watches the feed the explosions begin to come faster and more\n&gt; furious as=\r\n the battle intensifies! You have mechanized insects of all sorts\n&gt; in the =\r\nair and on the ground, everything from armored bees performing\n&gt; staffing r=\r\nuns firing stinger missiles and laser blasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; You also have what appea=\r\nr to be armored lady bugs! However instead of\n&gt; fighting they appear to be =\r\nhovering at strategic points, observing the\n&gt; battle and directing matters.=\r\n Occasionally they fire blasts at the ground,\n&gt; targeting the enemy.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nrmored Locusts  and rhinoceros beetles are on the ground, in battle against=\r\n\n&gt; the insectile hordes, the smoke from their weapons and the wreckage they=\r\n are\n&gt; leaving behind rising into the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many Stag Beetles=\r\n also on the ground, weaving in among the battle,\n&gt; sneaking in to attack t=\r\nheir foes from behind and then sneaking back out.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of these metal f=\r\normed insects, insecticons if you will, have a definite\n&gt; MINION registrati=\r\non. However there are also the insectile creatures who they\n&gt; are fighting =\r\nagainst who are also putting up a good fight, as the wreckage\n&gt; of Insectic=\r\nons as well as Insectile aliens liter the landscape.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the middle of =\r\nthis, almost dead center the queen of the Insectile\n&gt; creature stands, stil=\r\nl in battle with the great multi-headed dragon.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Anyone who was t=\r\nhere at the old Maximal base may remember him as\n&gt; Marauder, the minion who=\r\n hovered over the base and demanded the release of\n&gt; Lamia I think it was.)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fool!&quot; The dragon said as it swung around for an attack on the queen=\r\n, &quot;You\n&gt; cannot hope to defeat us, you can only hope that we will let you l=\r\nive and\n&gt; serve US!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The queen, who looks to be some horrid combinatio=\r\nn of wasp, preying mantis\n&gt; and wasp, but with the size of an 18 wheeler sw=\r\neeps into the air! As she\n&gt; rose she filled the air with the sound of her w=\r\nings. &quot;All will fall before\n&gt; the horde.&quot; She said and them opened her mand=\r\nible and sent forth a\n&gt; destructive beam from her jaws!\n&gt; \n&gt; Marauder swung=\r\n to the side, allowing his armored frame to take the brunt of\n&gt; the blast! =\r\nWhile there were light scorch marks, he seemed to be lightly\n&gt; hurt.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nIs that all you have?!?&quot; He laughed as he swung around shifting forms from\n=\r\n&gt; his dragon mode into what looked to be an aerial fighter craft, &quot;Then you=\r\n\n&gt; don&#39;t have what it takes!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired a blast that caught her in the =\r\nabdomen, creating a burning wound\n&gt; along its side!\n&gt; Her wings fluttered f=\r\nor a moment before she swunf wide to come around on the\n&gt; suddenly far more=\r\n agile Marauder.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gotchya, woah, you&#39;re right. It migh=\r\nt take more than just us ta get &#39;em\n&gt; outa here. I&#39;m gonna try&#39;n connect wi=\r\nth Rodimus but I&#39;m not so sure we&#39;re in\n&gt; range.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stays in vehic=\r\nle form, and tries his long range radio system, to\n&gt; contact Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Night Shift ta Rodimus, over. Rat Trap and I are on a rescue mission, t=\r\na\n&gt; find Cheetor, and now, we got multiple Minion and Decepticon signatures=\r\n\n&gt; runn&#39;n rampant and there&#39;s only two of us here. I can transmit our exact=\r\n\n&gt; location right now, and hopefully you&#39;ll be able ta send some bots out h=\r\nere\n&gt; ta give us a hand. Night Shift over &#39;n out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus =\r\nresponds back to Night Shift, &quot;Most of our units are in stasis.&quot; His\n&gt; voic=\r\ne was calm and thoughtful. &quot;Have you actually seen Cheetor yet? We don&#39;t\n&gt; =\r\nwant to commit our forces until we are sure.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time as Nigh=\r\ntshift sent his transmission several Insecticon\n&gt; types seem to perk up as =\r\nif something had caught there attention! As Rodimus\n&gt; responded to Nightshi=\r\nft, two of them came flying over in his direction =96\n&gt; they looked like la=\r\nrge and metal armored lady bugs!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
