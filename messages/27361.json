And it did.\nHe leaned against her a bit, just liking the feeling.\nHe remembered that the people who he grew up with did this too, but they \nwere a bit far in his mind and he was gunna dwell on the scratching for now.\nD let out a deep sigh and then shock himself, stepping back a bit before \nrising onto his hind legs (looks like a warewolf.) He looked down at Fenox, \nwho was now shorter then his shoulders but taller then his waist.*\n\n&quot; Be careful.&quot;\n\n* He said in his smoth voice, then looking at the door to the room. A sign \nthat it was time Fenox left and checked up on Vlad. God knew what he was up \nto out there.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
