He remembered the last time he had left the planet....\n\nHis spark heavy, looks the planet over, picking out a particular sector on it and feeling his emotion centers almost overload. So many things he could have done differently, and yet it ended up like this. Him leaving Cybertron as a drunk. He could have still been an officer, if only he&#39;d been more careful.\n\n&quot;I need a drink,&quot; he mumbles to himself as he walks away from the viewhole after taking a last longing look at the sector that he&#39;d been staring at and burning the whole of Cybertron into his memory. There was nothing for him there anyways, though. He shouldn&#39;t have been feeling that way. He walks around the ship, looking for any sort of food/drink despencer.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., rauq@t... wrote:\n&gt; --- JetV / Pacifix / Ikoto / Soundwave ---\n&gt; \n&gt; JetV initiates the cloaking device on the medium sized stealth \n&gt; cruiser, and begins to increase the speed of the ship.
