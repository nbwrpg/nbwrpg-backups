Prowl could feel it. His beast mode, the owl, was a \nnocturnal animal, and as the sun was setting, his excitement was rising.\n\nAll of a sudden he stops, signaling Iron Raptor to stop also. Ahead of the \ntwo maximals, in a clearing, a damaged bot stumbles into view. The symbol on \nhis chest clearly showed that he was a predacon and the dents and gashes \nshowed that he was damaged.\n\nProwl hisses silently. &quot;That&#39;s Zenyak. Wait here,&quot; he says and jumps up, \ngrabbing a branch and climbing to the top of the tree that he had been \nstanding under.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZenyak&#39;s head jerks to the left as he hears some rustling coming from a tree \nnearby, but he relaxes when he sees nothing to cause alarm. He keeps walking \nthrough the clearing.\n\nWhen he is about half way through, an owl drops out of the sky, talons \nsmashing into Zenyak&#39;s shoulders, knocking him unconscious.\n\nProwl transforms back to robot mode and pulls out his gun, keeping it leveled \nat the predacon&#39;s head.\n\n"}}
