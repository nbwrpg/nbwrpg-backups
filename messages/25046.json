He knew that asking was useless because Firearm probably knew \nquite a bit more about the CF than Hot Rod did.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ twists out of the way of Angel Prime&#39;s sword, growling and letting \ngo of Prowl in the proccess. Prowl spinns around, swinging his staff \nat FZ. The staff hits, FZ falling toward the ground, clutching a \nglowing spot on his side. The glow was dissolving his armor, draining \nhis energy, and generating a slagload of pain.\n\n\n"}}
