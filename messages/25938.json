He \nfinally closes his mouth, waiting for Astroblast to talk himself out. \nWhen the bot finishes, Killfest replies.\n\n&quot;Base locations, numbers, and other recorded info can be found back \nat base,&quot; he says, stretching out a hand, palm up. &quot;I can, however, \ngive you a slight overview of the locations, and the numbers of \nPredacon troops.&quot;\n\nHis palm lights up in several locations, a hologram of Earth apearing \nbelow it. &quot;This is prehistoric earth, as you had said. There are \nroughly half a dozen major factions existing on the planet, some \nstronger than others.&quot;\n\nThe hologram of earth spins, showing a volcano in Greece. &quot;First of \nall, this is the base of my faction of the Predacons. Three groups, \nled by me, DrillBit, and Darkfate, are allied and reside in this \nbase. The other faction of Predacons is led by Megatron, and their \nbase is located in the arctics.&quot; The hologram spins again, showing \nthe location of Megatron&#39;s base.\n\n&quot;The two factions closest to being Predacon are the Destrons and the \nAlliance.&quot; Killfest was now reciting what he had read from the \ncomputer at the Council base before it was destroyed, and he hoped \nthe information was accurate. &quot;The Destron base is located roughly on \nthe other side of the planet from us, on a different continuent.&quot; His \nhologram once again spins, showing what would one day be called Mt. \nKatahdin, located in northern Maine. &quot;The Alliance base is located \nquite a bit closer, on the same continuent as us.&quot; Now the hologram \nspins to show an island three miles off of the south coast of \nSpain. &quot;Last, and quite possibly least, are the Maximals. Their base \nis located in the continent south of us, on the western part of that \ncontinuent.&quot; The hologram spins to show the deserts of Africa, \nhighliting a spot on the west side of it. Killfest turns the hologram \noff. &quot;To the best of my knowledge, the other factions don&#39;t have a \nfixed base, but they&#39;re there. For the numbers, we&#39;d have to return \nto base.&quot;\n\nHe pauses, waiting for questions from Astroblast.\n\n\n"}}
