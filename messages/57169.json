The sensation rushing through her. A\n&gt; wicked grin \n&gt; &gt; appeared upon her face....  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Scourge cried out as his body began to glow he curled up and \ntried to \n&gt; &gt; transform, but instead the armor plates began to fuse and soon a\n&gt; black egg like \n&gt; &gt; structure lay at the bottom of the pool, the matrix opened and the\n&gt; egg cracked \n&gt; &gt; and a small glowing ball shot out and flew right at Maxima... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Her form still arched, the matrix glowing as if to accept the \nball of \n&gt; &gt; light.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  The ball entered the matrix and the egg floated to the surface \nand\n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; cracks spread across the black object... the matrix cooled and\n&gt; sealed as it did it \n&gt; &gt; let loose a blast of power to maxima... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Her body jolted & arched as she cried out... &quot;uhhoh-AHHHHHH!!!!&quot;\n&gt; (Think of \n&gt; &gt; Heavy Metal War episode when Megatron gets all of the powers of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Decepticons). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The egg began to hatch and a single a pair of eyes peared out at \nher... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The power surged through her of the Matrix, as her crimson optics\n&gt; opened & \n&gt; &gt; glowed brightly. Then her form stood tall as her glowing crimson\n&gt; optics looked \n&gt; &gt; at the dark egg.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  The egg began to fall away as the figure stood, it was organic...\n&gt; but also \n&gt; &gt; machine... it growled and a low dark voice emerged. &quot;Who... am I?&quot;\n&gt; The figure \n&gt; &gt; stood and a werewolf like manbeast stood before her he had a thick\n&gt; black mane \n&gt; &gt; and in some places he had silver designs running over his body, \nand\n&gt; two blood \n&gt; &gt; red eyes... \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Her glowing crimson orbs gazed at him, as a wicked smirk \nappeared...\n&gt; &quot;You... \n&gt; &gt; are Scourge.... reborn.&quot; she purred with a hint of evil in her \nvoice. \n&gt; &gt; Her shimmering form stood there, watching the new reformat of \nScourge. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   He looked down at himself and he growled looking up at her... \nHis\n&gt; clawed \n&gt; &gt; hands opened and closed... &quot;Maxima....&quot; He looked up at her and \nthen\n&gt; clinching \n&gt; &gt; his fists looked back at her. &quot;What do you wish of me...&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Nothing .. for now,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Rest. For when the time \ncomes,\n&gt; we will \n&gt; &gt; make our mark upon our enemies.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Her optics glanced over at Azureblade. &quot;If you are with me, then\n&gt; reform in \n&gt; &gt; the pool. If you are against me, leave, never return & next we \nmeet,\n&gt; I shall not \n&gt; &gt; be merciful.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Then her optics turned back to Scourge. He was indeed different.\n&gt; The new \n&gt; &gt; form befit him very well. \n&gt; &gt; She grinned.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  He turned to her then looked back at Azureblade... he growled as\n&gt; his inner \n&gt; &gt; body boiled with hatred... suddenly his body changed and the \nwolfman\n&gt; changed \n&gt; &gt; the organics, and the mechanical parts changed and the form that\n&gt; loomed over \n&gt; &gt; Maxima and placed a clawed wing on her shoulder was a cross \nbetween\n&gt; a dragon and \n&gt; &gt; a venus flytrap... It nuzzled her cheek and looked at azure with a\n&gt; face mostly \n&gt; &gt; made of teeth... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  She felt both easy & uneasy about Scourge. It stirred her though,\n&gt; both the \n&gt; &gt; fact that he would listen to her, her spark & Matrix glowed as one\n&gt; as she felt \n&gt; &gt; the power boil. There was a stirring that Scourge created... was\n&gt; difficult to \n&gt; &gt; tell, as it was more than one type of stirring. \n&gt; &gt; she only stood there & smirked wickedly, a soft laugh boiled. \n&gt; &gt; But as her form restored, with the help of the lagoon & the \nMatrix, her \n&gt; &gt; memories returned.. one especially of a kiss....  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  The beast turned and looked down at her. It grunted as if to say.\n&gt; &quot;Whats \n&gt; &gt; wrong?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She hoped to gain Azureblade under to command. Not to command &\n&gt; rule, but \n&gt; &gt; just for the fun of it .... she didn&#39;t wish to best-\n&gt; &gt; Her optics widened.. Hydras! It was he whom she was loyal to... it\n&gt; was he who \n&gt; &gt; had kissed her.. why though... her memories then gave her that\n&gt; window. It was \n&gt; &gt; of love. She dared to love?! It nearly sickened her. But then ...\n&gt; she knew \n&gt; &gt; why. Hydras... was the combined form of both Megatron & Galvatron.\n&gt; Of the one \n&gt; &gt; she both did truly love & hate. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Our time will soon be at hand, Scourge,&quot; she stated simply. \nWhat she \n&gt; &gt; remembered, would only be to herself. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She looked up at Scourge, her crimson optics gazing up at him. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  the toothy face curled into a grin as he opened his great wings \nand\n&gt; let a \n&gt; &gt; jet of flame burst from his throat. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She grinned, his excitement was comforting. \n&gt; &gt; She broke away from him for a moment, leapt into the lagoon. \n&gt; &gt; As she floated through the waters, it helped her to repair & \nrestore\n&gt; her. \n&gt; &gt; As she resurfaced, she was repaired & restored. \n&gt; &gt; Stepping out of the waters on the opposite side of the waterfall,\n&gt; her form \n&gt; &gt; shimmering in the sunlight,\n\n\n"}}
