Liek I said, this is just a very modified version \n=\r\nof my previous post. Hopefully its a lil better at working my \ncharacter en=\r\ntrance. Much as I liked the other post, this has to be \ndone, if only to ma=\r\nke things better for the rest of you.\n\n(IC)\n   \nThe pod bore the heat of at=\r\nmospheric entry like a champion, ripping \nthrough the thick prehistoric air=\r\n of the planet Earth. Carried inside \nthe stasis pod&#39;s shell-like hull was =\r\na Maximal, stoic and courageous. \nHe had been sent in the stasis pod to pro=\r\nvide backup warriors to \nMaximal groups on the planet Earth, where advancin=\r\ng Predacon warriors \nare making their collection gambit a reality.\n   \n\nIt =\r\ncame in low, lower than the computers of Cybertron had predicted. \nOn its c=\r\nurrent path it was headed for a rocky section of land, near \nwhat seemed to=\r\n be a large settlement of some sort. The reading \nblinked up against perpet=\r\nual-thrust boosters of the pod, a relatively \nolder model. It was too late =\r\nfor stopping procedures. The pod was \ncertain to crash into a thick rock fa=\r\nce, a facet of a plateau. As the \nreverse thrusters ignited as they were au=\r\ntomated to do, the pod fell \ninto a spiralling tumble, uncontrolled and fas=\r\nt. The shuttlecraft&#39;s \ncomputers began to malfunction, hard. One by one, in=\r\n rapid \nsuccession, the pod&#39;s systems went awry. The boosters, the \nnavigat=\r\nion, the communication, even certain life support systems for \nthe spark of=\r\n the Maximal. The scanners of the vehicle exploded to \nlife amongst the ter=\r\nrible disconnections of systems, and the sensory \norb was launched from the=\r\n rear of the pod.\n    \n\nThe small orb was released from a hatch that slid o=\r\npen. It flew \nupwards, and two small metallic wings flipped out. It fell to=\r\n the \nearth below incredibly quickly. It crashed into the soft ground of a =\r\n\nwatering hole. The orb began lifting upwards, out of the water, and \npower=\r\ning up. Most of the suite was busted, very little or the device \nwas intact=\r\n or working. What was operational was the uplink to the \nstill-falling stas=\r\nis pod, and a very weak power core. It was about to \ndie and leave the prot=\r\noform inside the stasis pod stranded. \n   \n\nAt that moment, a herd of eleph=\r\nants shot by in a stampede towards a \nwatering hole. Caught in the scanner =\r\nbeam of the orb, a male bull \nelephant was passed over by a small yellow li=\r\nght. The orb&#39;s network \nto the pod which still tumbled across the Africa-As=\r\nia regions of \nprehistoric Earth activated and immediately beamed the DNA d=\r\nata to \nthe protoform itself, bypassing the computer systems. The robot \nin=\r\nside still lived.\n   \n\nInside the pod, a rapid transformation took place. T=\r\nhe transformer&#39;s \nbody was melded in a slick metallic form of beast and mac=\r\nhine. Many \nminutes passed as the pod shot into a rock face in Asia. The di=\r\nrect \nuplink had gone straight into the robot. It hadn&#39;t been done before. =\r\n\nWho was to know if the former Autobot would emerge deranged, \ndeformed, or=\r\n whether he would even emerge at all. Almost thirty \nminutes passed as the =\r\nprotoform to shape and did its best to filter \nout many unnecessary things.=\r\n \n  \n\n And then an eruption of fire exploded forth in a shower of energy \na=\r\nnd stone chips. A lone robot stood in a carved out section of the \nrock pla=\r\nteau, twin ion cannons in hand. With suddenness belying his \nlarge size, th=\r\ne bot shifted to beast mode with a spoken command. His \nbody formed that of=\r\n a huge grey elephant, and the large beast made \nhis way down the newly for=\r\nmed hill of rock. Lost in thought as he \nclimbed down carefully, the Maxima=\r\nl beast was amazed at the immediate \nqualities of his transformations, rapi=\r\nd and unstrained. The \ntransformer&#39;s amazing switch to robot mode was a cur=\r\niosity even to \nthe seasoned former Autobot. He shouldn&#39;t have been able to=\r\n switch so \nquickly after gaining a beast mode to his protoform, but in fac=\r\nt, he \ndid. \n   \n\nChalking it up to his age and stubbornness, for now at le=\r\nast, he \ncontinued down the crushed rock pathway he&#39;d created out of the \ns=\r\nhattered stone leveled by his ion cannons. He hopped from on large \npiece t=\r\no another at one point, and it seemed the impact shifted the \nrock. It slid=\r\n off its little crutch of stone and slid the rest of the \nway down.\n   \n\n&quot;C=\r\nonvenient.&quot;\n   \n\nLooking up and around, and marveled at the beauty of this =\r\nsmall \nworld. The Decepticon and Predacon forces on this world were going t=\r\no \ndestroy it if left alone. He couldn&#39;t let that happen, in his mind. \nAs =\r\nsoon as he found his commanding officer, a computer, and the \nmysteries of =\r\nhis change came a little closer to being solved, he \nwould eliminate as man=\r\ny as possible. \n \n\nOnly a half mile away, visible to the silvery savanna an=\r\nimal, was the \nAutobot base. Running towards it at full speed, he made a be=\r\neline for \nthe island stronghold. It would be up to him to discover what th=\r\ne \nbase was and who ran it. If it was Autobot or Maximal, maybe he could \nf=\r\nind help. If it was Predacon or Decepticon=85 well, Skullhammer would \ninde=\r\ned get to test out his robot form again. \n\n\n\n"}}
