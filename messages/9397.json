With only a few bots to \nguard the base, sending out the welcome wagon was not looking like a \ngood idea. She sighed with a heavy spark.  &quot;I&#39;m not a commander.  I&#39;m \nno leader.  I need a commander here who can do this.&quot; She said under \nher breath.\nShe turned and looked about.  She needed every able bot here to \ndefend the base.  She knew that there wasn&#39;t much choice.  She could \nsend Terrorsaur, but he would be needed here in case of trouble.  \nKitKat was out. THat was it. She opened her link to the wolf.\n&quot;KITKAT, I need you here at the base now.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\n&quot;I&#39;m busy.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\n&quot;NOW! We can look for Rowdy later. I need you here now!&quot;\n\nKitKat:: \nShe was getting annoyed by the pushy mouse.\n&quot;I&#39;ll return soon.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\n&quot;That&#39;s an order. Get back here now!&quot;\n\nKitKat::\n&quot;Oh and who died and made you leader?&quot; in her most sarcastic voice.\n\nDarkMouse::\n&quot;I&#39;ll report you if you don&#39;t get back here right now.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\n&quot;OK, I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;\nShe left the cave and headed back to the base.  She had been hit with \nMegatron&#39;s stun gun once. And that was enough.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve already begun landing proceedures, Thank you for your \n&gt; assistance Darkmouse.&quot; The spider said sarcastically.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Computer open the artilary crates.&quot; Phobia was weary that \nDarkmouse \n&gt; hadn&#39;t given him a number of bots to expect. He left the pilots \nchair \n&gt; and proceeded back to the cargo hold.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These should do.&quot; he said to himself as he drew two Decimator \nrifles \n&gt; from a crate.
