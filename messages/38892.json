After a while, all was\nsilent again, and the peaceful birds continued to chirp. Through the\nclouds a large metalic form with smoke rising up lay grounded. On closer\ninspection a robot lay dangling out the side. Then another large black\none hoisted him up. \n\nInside the ship he turned around, his younger brother, Jagged, over his\nshoulder, as he looked to Havotron. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; his ominous voice drifted\nout of his vocals. He did the normal military stance. &quot;Unit Quake\ntotally functional.&quot; he said nodding to Quake. &quot;Unit Jagged in need of\nrepairs. Unit Needlenose in stasis lock, Unit Apeface, half up, unit\nSpinister, uknown.&quot; he said, nodding towards Spinister, who lay beneath\nwreckage, but not moving. &quot;Unit Slugslinger out of sight, he was not\ninside the ship during the crash. He may however be outside.&quot; he\nwhispered. &quot;Jagged and I will need to adopt forms from this planet.&quot; he\ninformed his higher officer.\n\nSpasma leapt down towards his partner Apeface, and opened up a panel to\nthe chest. He realined a few circuits, then Apeface&#39;s body transformed\nto his gorilla mode. &quot;uhhhhhhh.&quot; he grunted, as Spasma looked up.\n\n&quot;He will be alright, and his wounds will heal normally.&quot; the Nebulan\nScientist informed Havotron.\n\nHook stood up, still clutching his shoulder, and patted Scrapper on the\nback. Another job well done, at least for this rable crew. Hook walked\ntowards the gaping hole of the ship, and took a step off, leaving the\nsecurity of solid ground, to wich he slowly fell a few feet, before\nhovering in mid air. He floated all the way to the top of the ship, and\nlooked it over. He would need Scavanger&#39;s abilities to better asses the\ndammage he thought. &quot;Scavanger, Mixmaster, joing me outside.&quot; he called.\n\n"}}
