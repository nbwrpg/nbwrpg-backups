How could the Alliance keep bots like that? He shook his head as he then looked back towards Prowl, not really liking the view one little bit.\nHe listened to Prowl�s talk about the difficulty of escape but as long as he got Tavatron out of there he didn�t really care, it being what he was really concerned with on this mission.\nHowever, knowing that it might be a little easier escaping the same way they had come in was a considerable option, but if they got caught then either end could be sealed and thus�sealing their doom.\nDinobot looked at the hole in the vent in front of Prowl again, ready to spring down and slag Dark One soon after Prowl had slaged Nemesis Enforcer. An action he was looking forward to.\nBut then he heard words that he suddenly became disappointed to hear, he couldn�t slag anyone on the way out?! Let Prowl do the talking? Dinobot just shook his head and concentrated on the opening again, he just had to get Tavatron out of there�that was all that mattered.*\n\n� Whatever.�\n\n* That was the only reaction to Prowl�s plan that he gave, and that was all he was going to get.\nIt was then that he saw Prowl move the vent cover aside, knowing that NOW was the time to move out. He watched as he silently slipped from the vent and onto the floor, coming up to the opening and looking straight down at him.\nWith nothing more then a quick thought Dinobot slipped through the opening without a single sound. Slowing his breathing as he came to the floor so that it couldn�t be heard, thinking of how one�s sound of breathing could wreck a stealth mission more easily then others could know.\nDark One was only a few feet away, right beside�Tavatron!\nDinobot walked up to the table that Tavatron lay sprawled out on, energon restraints viciously tight. He then looked at Dark One with narrowed optics and a snarl, not caring if he was the one doing this to Tavatron but knowing that he was going down none the less.\nWith one last glance at Tavatron he then looked across and over at Prowl as he approached Nemesis Enforcer, noting that he was close enough to strike the enemy down.\nHe gave a short not towards Prowl before looking back at Dark One, ready to slag him once Prowl took out Nemesis.\nBut if the Maximal didn�t get rid of Nemesis quickly he would begin to lose his patience, not a good thing if they wished to pull off this mission.\nAs Dinobot looked at Dar One he couldn�t help but think of how helpless Tavatron looked upon that metal slab she lay upon. Thinking that it was a shame for a warrior such as he to look such a way, yet knowing that she would soon stand tall again one they got rid of their tormenters.\nBut now he waited, ready for the very second that Prowl struck down his enemy for him to strike down his own.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
