She got up \nand stood at the side of the bed.  She walked back and forth holding \nonto the side of the bed.  she got to thinking about her hand and \nwondered if it was a fluke or if it was something that would happen \nevery time.  She looked around and saw Quickstrike jsut outside her \ndoor. (If that is correct, I thought the post said he was waiting \noutside Dm&#39;s room for BA)\n\nShe looked at the medical drone.  She looked and saw a sharp blade on \nthe drone. She picked it up and looked at it.  She put the blade to \nher hand and closed her eyes.  She pulled the blade and sliced her \nhand open.  She winced and opened her eyes.  she looked at teh cut \nand watched the glowing fluid leak out slowly.  Then the cut started \nto heal.  In a few moments, it was perfectly healed as if she had not \ncut herself.  She smile and looked at her hand.  She knew that all \nshe had to do was wait.  Once she was fully healed, she would be a \ngreat warrior, she thought.  She wondered why this was happeneing to \nher though.  Why not a braver bot? Why her?  She lifted herself back \nup on the bed and sat there pondering her new situation.\n\n\n"}}
