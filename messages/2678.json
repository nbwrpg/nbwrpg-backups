One of them is an\n&gt; owl, and the other is a lion that is part of Magnaboss. This Prowl is the\n&gt; owl, but he has a fairly strange history, probably different from the\ntoy&#39;s,\n&gt; and I&#39;d doupt he and Bluestreak could possible be brothers, but IM me if\nyou\n&gt; have any comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Prowl/Striker::\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl looks at Iron Raptor, as she places her hand on his arm. &quot;Actually I\n&gt; have no idea what I&#39;m doing. You&#39;re third in command, I was hoping you&#39;d\ntake\n&gt; over from here,&quot; he says, feeling slightly stupid. He turns to Rhinox, not\n&gt; hearing the sleepy murmurings from Cyber Claw.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have read about you in data logs back on Cybertron. There are plenty of\nus\n&gt; here, but they havn&#39;t got here yet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At that point, Striker walks into the room, nearly crashing into Cyber\nClaw\n&gt; in the proccess. He looks at her, surprised. &quot;Welcome, I don&#39;t believe we\n&gt; met.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free @Backup service!
