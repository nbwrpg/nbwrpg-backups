I finished working on the computer, I ask for the \nHistory than I call you on the com and I ask if I could scout so I could go \nlearn the land near here, so if we ever get in a battle here I can be a help \nto my team.  So why are you being so mean and rude?&quot;  Hugar was ready to \nshoot Blacknightmare, but he didn&#39;t.  He just stood there waiting for \nBlacknightmare to get over this feeling that he put a bomb down. How would \nshe know unless she is psychic or something.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
