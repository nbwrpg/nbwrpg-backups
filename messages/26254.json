But then her back bolted straight and she starred \nbug-eyed for a second before looking down at her leg.\nSnow Tech was attached to it and bawling his eyes out!\nIron Raptor expression turned to that of annoyance, rolling her eyes and \nthen looking over at Shadow Cat.\nHer suggestion was very acceptable at this point.\nShe looked down at Snow Tech with the same expression, a flat voice which \nshe was sure he knew well.*\n\n&quot; Let go...of my leg.&quot;\n\n* Just then she recieved the transmission from Hysteria, replying.*\n\n&quot; Just take your time, we can wait a few cycles.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
