If the names are no good tell me.\n\n\nBIC:\n=A7Prometheus=A7   =\r\n   =A7Epimetheus=A7\n\n\n     A space shuttle that holds two slowly creaks thr=\r\nough space as it \nheads to the blue and green planet known to its future re=\r\nsidents as \nEarth.  The shuttle looks something like a Bident but instead o=\r\nf two \npokers it has two lightning bolts.  It is a metallic silver/white \nc=\r\nolor.\n  \n     But enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique spaceship =\r\n\nwere two individuals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over their \nmetall=\r\nic though was more metallic but this is where the two \nindividuals looked d=\r\nifferent.  One was a shinny red metallic and the \nother was a shinny blue m=\r\netallic.  So for now they shall be known as \nRed and Blue.  Red was studyin=\r\ng a map of the world known as Earth.  \nBlue was sitting in the pilot&#39;s chai=\r\nr but instead of carefully \nplanning the course he had his legs up on the c=\r\nontrols and was \ntwiddinling his thumbs.\n\n     &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red said as h=\r\ne turned and faced his \ncomrade, &quot;What the Grease Bolting are you doing!  W=\r\nhy aren&#39;t you \nplanning our landing!  I don&#39;t want to crash.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n=\r\n\n      &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  Blue said as he let out a small \nchuckle=\r\n, &quot;You are suppose to move with the flow.&quot;\n\n      &quot;We need a landing vector=\r\n!&quot;  Red yells.\n\n      &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n\n      Poor =\r\nPoor Blue, if only he listen to his brother.  But he \ndecided to not listen=\r\n to his brother and decided to go with the \nflow.  Well now they are flowin=\r\ng on the mountains of the Northern \nContinent where they crashed.  Their ex=\r\nact location of the crash is \n(using the map on the events page) as far eas=\r\nt of the Predacon base \nas possible and about an inch up.  It looks like th=\r\nese two bots need \na rescue operation. (Hint:  I just making the rescue ope=\r\nration to see \nwhich groups are active and that is how I am going to decide=\r\n who to \njoin to rescue me.)  (So Bots, move out.)\n\n\n"}}
