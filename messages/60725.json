She\n&gt; &gt; laid within the small sleek craft, barely large\n&gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; for her slender form, and light equipment. In one\n&gt; &gt; hand she held her staff, she preferred to use it as\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; melee weapon, but it was quite capable of delivering\n&gt; &gt; energy blasts of moderate power. In her other hand\n&gt; &gt; she held twenty bolts. They were her power, by how\n&gt; &gt; they fell she could see the future to some extent. \n&gt; &gt; She was nothing to compare with Seer, Ex, her\n&gt; &gt; beloved\n&gt; &gt; Deus, or even Machina, but she had some skill, and\n&gt; &gt; had\n&gt; &gt; stolen some destiny energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She blew on the bolts, and asked them, &quot;What is so\n&gt; &gt; important about this `Organics&#39;, why does the\n&gt; &gt; destiny\n&gt; &gt; energy settle about her so. She threw them, and saw\n&gt; &gt; many patterns gather. Most of them were indistinct,\n&gt; &gt; representing the chaotic course of destiny, but one\n&gt; &gt; was quite clear, one bolt laying against another,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; a third before them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;A potential child,&quot; chuckled Fortuneteller, &quot;well\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll soon put a stop to that.&quot; She whispered to the\n&gt; &gt; bolts again &quot;Who is the father?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bolts were once again unclear, showing four\n&gt; &gt; separate possible candidates, but one was most\n&gt; &gt; distinct, taking ten bolts in his pattern. His bolts\n&gt; &gt; were chaotic, mad, but still of one pattern.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally she asked her final questions of the bolts,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is so special about this child?&quot; She gasped at\n&gt; &gt; the final pattern. The bolts were quite clear this\n&gt; &gt; time, while even without her there was no assurance\n&gt; &gt; the child would exist, beyond the child one future\n&gt; &gt; dominated seventeen of the bolts, and the other\n&gt; &gt; three\n&gt; &gt; lay scattered, in un-formed future. The possible\n&gt; &gt; timeline she would be stealing for the Deviners uses\n&gt; &gt; would be a very different one indeed. In fear of\n&gt; &gt; loosing the child the mother would put it onboard\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Ark in stasis, even putting his spark within an\n&gt; &gt; Autobot body. When the child awakened HE, not\n&gt; &gt; Optimus\n&gt; &gt; Prime would become the leader of the Autobots. \n&gt; &gt; Through some odd device the mother would both allow\n&gt; &gt; his spark to mature over the eons, and erase all\n&gt; &gt; possible memory of his former life. Under his\n&gt; &gt; guidance the Great War would be a massacre of\n&gt; &gt; Decepticons, a future in which only the Maximals\n&gt; &gt; existed. Her son would be the most ruthless, and\n&gt; &gt; brilliant transformer ever to draw energon, but such\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; great leader he would have no need of the Matrix. If\n&gt; &gt; she read them right he even discovered some way to\n&gt; &gt; destroy Unicron without opening it!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deus would reward her for this. She thought of her\n&gt; &gt; precious Deus, and knew as always he was just using\n&gt; &gt; her. She looked at her reflection in the forward\n&gt; &gt; shuttle window. She wasn&#39;t old, but worn with the\n&gt; &gt; fading beauty of mid-life. Deus was perhaps older\n&gt; &gt; than she, but his destiny energy kept him looking\n&gt; &gt; ten\n&gt; &gt; cycles younger. Still, she was his to command, and\n&gt; &gt; she would do as he bid, even to her own death.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She aimed her shuttle at the place where she sensed\n&gt; &gt; her pray, slightly beside the Maximal Base, but\n&gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; within their shields. She sent out a distress\n&gt; &gt; signal,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;HELLO! UNKNOWN BASE DO YOU COPY! I&#39;M OUT OF\n&gt; &gt; CONTROL AND I WILL HIT YOUR SHIELDS IF YOU DO NOT\n&gt; &gt; LOWER THEM!
