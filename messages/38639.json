After a few seconds, he realizes that his scanners couldn&#39;t detect her.\n\n&quot;Slag.. Rixer, stay here and get us more efficient scans as quick as you can. Blyer, Truttle, stay with him. Me and Forrior will go in, contact us when you get something.&quot;\n\nHe advances to the next hallway, seeing Hell Drak and Necromancer firing at something, then the cealing collapsing and a monster flying at them. He and Forrior instantly open fire, jumping into the hallway and rolling into a crouching position, their weapons set on stun, trying not to breathe in the green stuff that was coming out of the broken door.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRixer and Blyer stop, Rixer looking over at the nearest busted-up console and pulling out a few pieces from it. He kneels down at begins to improve his already advanced scaners, Cledar not having told him that they were no longer neccessary. Blyer stands watch.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAlready in the air, Prowl flies above the ship, trying to detect as much as he could with his mind. He knew he could use his and IR&#39;s mental link to locate her and find out her plan, but he doesn&#39;t cheat. Seeing a hole in the wall, he flies into it and lands in the ship, not too far from IR&#39;s position.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm walks down the opposite corridor from the rest of the Maximals, putting his weapon on as weak a power as it could go and keeping his eyes out for Iron Raptor.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * There was no way anyone could know exactly where she was in the \n&gt; holoroom...unless they saw her right out and plain.\n&gt; But that was hard to do...when she was up in the roof.\n&gt; In a smaller form of her SBM, one where she had to travel on 4 legs instead \n&gt; of two. It was easy going.\n&gt; But just to give a teaser to anyone that might be near...she peeked out and \n&gt; looked around.\n&gt; Clear.\n&gt; Slipping from the roof she skittered down onto the floor and down the hall a \n&gt; bit.
