Unfortunately, most of\nthe Maximals I have met so far have not given me a great feeling about\ntheir cause&quot;. Then the CR chamber opens, and Beachcomber and Firedrill jump\nto their feet to meet their long time partner.\n\nThe small red robot swaggers out off the chamber, &quot;ohhhhh my akin head&quot; he\nmusters. &quot;Cliffjumper, your alive&quot; blurts out Firedrill in happiness, but\nrealises now that all of his partners are up, that they need to do\nsomething. &quot;Come on Cliffjumper, Beachcomber, it&#39;s time for us to take\ncharge&quot;. They then start heading off in a random direction, since they dont\nknow their whareabouts. They lucky pass by the control room Iron Raptor is\nin.\n\n\n\n"}}
