Nearly everything about it seemed new and fresh .\nThe doors opened as he approached as sensors detected his presence.\nEverything responded quickly to any voice command that he chose to\nutter.\n\nAs they got Cyclonus back to the medical bay Fractyl quickly took\ncharge of things, far more comfortable and even somewhat assertive in\nthis more familiar enviornment. He quickly ran scans over the\nInsecticon, Bruticus-X and Cyclonus.\n\nFractyl looked up at Hydras, &quot;These will need some time in the\nrecharge chamber, but will other wise be fine.&quot;\n\nStepping over to Scourge he ran the scanner over him and frowned, &quot;He\non the other hand will require a bit more work.&quot; he said carefully.\n&quot;He appears to have been partially drained of energy in a way that I\ncannot yet understand.&quot;\n\nIguanus and Inferno stood off to one side, letting the others work.\nThey were primarilly warriors and soldiers, this was not their field\nof expertise.\n\nDeepstryke, Phobia and Blackrazor also stood and waited, each with\ntroubled looks. In a way Scourge was family, and they took his fall\nseriously.\n\nCyclonus looked at Fractyl, &quot;If you need an energon transfusion, I am\nready.&quot; he said quickly.\n\n&quot;No.&quot; Fractyl said, &quot;I believe I can handle this. But Even if I did\nneed it, you are in no condition to do that. You need repairs\nyourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will wait till he his finished before I get mine.&quot; Cyclonus said stubbornly.\n\nFractyl looked at Hydras hopping he would get Cyclonus to get some repairs.\n\nAt the same time Hydras gets a communication, &quot;Sir, this is Sky\nShadow. We still have your spark under survellience. So far there has\nbeen no movement.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Sky Shadow&#39;s info can be found at:\nhttp://tfwiki.net/wiki/Sky_Shadow_%28BW%29\n\n"}}
