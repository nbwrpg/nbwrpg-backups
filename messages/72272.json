To him ge was the enemy and he.\n&gt; Could not wait to face him head on.  Perhaps this would be a good time to\n&gt; figure out if he was the real deal or actually a clone.  All he would have\n&gt; to do is attempt to open his chest to find out.  So in a savage yet\n&gt; strategic manner he turns back to Magmatron, with a different expression on\n&gt; his face.  If he played the part he may find out exactly what he needed to\n&gt; know.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; On second thought, Lord Magmatron, if I may request so, perhaps I could\n&gt; have A few rounds with Dark Rodimus?  You may just like what you see and\n&gt; perhaps we may be able to strike some sort of bargain.  Before you stands\n&gt; two warriors, one of self doubt and lack of self confidence, and the other,\n&gt; steadfast, bold, strong, confident and outgoing. I&#39;m sure you would rather\n&gt; chose the warrior who is much more like me than him. Let me prove myself\n&gt; worthy and then we will talk again soon afterwards.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He them bows on his own.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; besides, a dragon is far more formidable than a warrior.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is a searching gaze from MAGMATRON as he turned his powerful\noptics on TUSCON then a powerful laughter. Perhaps nopt as loud as\nTUSCON&#39;s, but enough to fill the chamber with his own sound. &quot;Bravo\nsilver dragon, bravo!&quot;\n\nStepping down to the floor level with SABERBACK and DARK RODIMUS right\nbehind him he walked up to TUSCON his smile fading as he descended.\n\n&quot;You will have your battle.&quot; MAGAMTRON said with a warrior&#39;s tone, his\nvoice turning deadly serious as he stood looking at TUSCON, still\ntaller than he by nearly two feet even being on ground level, and his\nshoulders were wide and large indicating large amounts of strength and\nendurance.\n\nAgain with the searching gaze from MAGMATRON on TUSCON, his body tense\nand ready, &quot;But not yet.&quot; He said finally. &quot;This is not the proper\nvenue for any battle.&quot; He said, his voice deep and cool. Before you\nfight my dark knight you must prove your worth. Prove yourself worthy\nand you shall have it.&quot;\n\nBehind MAGMATRON the dark form of RODIMUS stood, his optics glowing\nwith internal light and energy, even the flame on his chest semeed to\nglow eerily. He bowed to TUSCON without taking his optics off of him,\nproper warrior&#39;s ettiquette. &quot;When the time comes, we shall meet.&quot;\n\nMAGMATRON nodded, &quot;Quite.&quot; He said. &quot;But now, to the pens with you\nTuscon.&quot; He laughed again, his seeming mercurial personality going\nfrom utter seriousness to humor. &quot;Your first battle will begin soon\nenough, prepare yourself.&quot;\n\nGUILEDART came up to TUSCON, &quot;Come on.&quot; he said with a little more\nrespect. Evidently the way MAGMATRON treated TUSCON granted him a\nlevel of respect from the soldier . . . but not too much, HARDHEAD and\nHYDRA still had their weapons on him.\n\nHe was being herded out of the room.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
