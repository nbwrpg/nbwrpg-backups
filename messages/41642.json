I&#39;m offended!! Monkey crap bots, huh?! Well that sack of \nnumb-nuts should look in the mirror some Goddamned day!!&quot;\nIron Raptor&#39;s expression turned almost instantly from blank to annoyed as \nthat comment that rang though her mind. And couldn&#39;t help but agree  as she \nlooked up at Devil Gigatron through the shaded visor that covered her eyes, \nonly to have it retract as she ran her index finger down the bridge of her \nnose from the center of her forehead. Closing her eyes with a strained sigh.\nThis wasn&#39;t a plea for an alliance anylonger. This was an insult that was \nonly growing larger by the second.\nUntil finally it was decided that this was going to stop.\nSilently turning to AzureBlade, Iron motioned him to follow before starting \non her own towards the gats to the Maximal City.\nLooking over her shoulder she waved to Devil Gigatron.*\n\n&quot; Get back to me when you&#39;re going to be a bit more respectful. Bye.&quot;\n\n* And with that her face turned back towards the great gates which stood \ntall and solid before her. Silently opening a cripted transmission to Cyndro \nwhich read: Fire if he tries anything. Otherwise, just keep the base \ndefences on full until he&#39;s gone.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
