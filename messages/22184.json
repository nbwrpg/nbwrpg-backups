She called stand down, \nsomething that told him to stop attacking, but she was a stranger. He \nwent on with the attack. He slashed at her with his sword just to \nscare her, then grabbed her around the neck with his free hand. He \nspun around and slammed her back into the wall.\n\n&quot;Where am I?&quot; he demanded. \n\n(Just a reminder, Berserk is a clone of Megatron except his armor is \ndifferent.)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; \n&gt; She jumped back and fired at close range, aiming for his \n&gt; shoulder. &quot;STAND DOWN NOW!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Berserk:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Berserk leapt into the air, flipping, avoiding the blast as much \nas \n&gt; &gt; he could.
