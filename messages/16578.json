Despite the \ndamage, he struggled the best he could to get back up to the surface. \nBeing a 400 pound robot wasn&#39;t making things easy. He pushed his arms \nand kicked his legs. \n\nHis head finally made it to the surface. He was afraid he would be \ndrug back under the water because of his own weight. And neither was \nthe water any good to his sytems.\n\n\n"}}
