Of\ncourse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, it&#39;s where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime to leave the\nbase,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got all these cool\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s where we are right now!\nIsn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s a nice room maybe a little too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dusty but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then again maybe not and it&#39;s a good room because it has lots of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leads into all of the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the\nbiggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rooms,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is good, because everyone might try to come in at the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if they do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crowded and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might\nhappen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t think\nI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong because I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right. Anyway,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s your name, I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calling you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Squawktalk, that would be silly, wouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you probably do, but I still hope, because hoping can get you\nstuff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes, and anyway, it&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should\nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because my name is cool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the next\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we&#39;ll be in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the next one instead and I can talk to you in there just hurry\nup\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take forever, okay?...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
