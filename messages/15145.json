He turned his\n&gt; head back to Drill Bit, who sounded naive enough to be annoyed with\n&gt; going with Tarantulas. How stupid.

He rolled his eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; He saw Cave-In still lying on the ground. She was newborn, needing\n&gt; guidance. He hopped over and grabbed her shoulders with his claws. He\n&gt; lifted himself into the air, flapping his wings to hover.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was ready to go.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
