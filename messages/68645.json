He was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; looking for prey. He saw Phobia trying to escape with Deepstryke.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Elder draws his bowcaster and removes the bow blade. He switches &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the weapon to plasma shots and takes aim. He fires three carefully &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aimed blasts at the Minion duo.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Phobia swung high into the air, her sudden movement unintentionally&lt;BR&gt;helping her to avoid the first shot. As the second shot streaks through&lt;BR&gt;the air she swung to one side, just barely avoiding the blast, but at&lt;BR&gt;the same time causing the trailing form of Deepstryke to swing widly on&lt;BR&gt;he end of her cable. So the third shot as it came, she was unable to&lt;BR&gt;avoid and it fried into her systems,\n causing her upward flight to level&lt;BR&gt;off, her systems struggling to ajust for the damage as she bearly&lt;BR&gt;stayed in the air. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;STOP!!&quot; Decible&#39;s voice boomed as she opened fire on the shuttle, most&lt;BR&gt;notably Elder who is firing on thier leader and Phobia who is carrying&lt;BR&gt;him. Twin sonic missiles manuever thier way through the air toward the&lt;BR&gt;shuttle as Phobia arced high preparing for another run.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tummult shot foward as he firepower rained down on the hover tank,&lt;BR&gt;trying to keep it busy as the minions attempted to make thier escape. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Legacy on the other hand seemed non-pulsed by the attack, his main&lt;BR&gt;cannon swiftly reoriented on Tummult as its business end glowed and&lt;BR&gt;then unleashed a powerful blast of energy on the flier. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tummult managed to avoid the majority of the blast, but even the little&lt;BR&gt;that caught him burned deep into his armor, blackening its one pristine&lt;BR&gt;blue surface. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Noting the success of\n that attack Legacy took a moment to line up on&lt;BR&gt;the two remaining minions, the only ones that have not yet elected to&lt;BR&gt;run. With his rear mounted twin cannons he turned and fired arcing&lt;BR&gt;blasts at Nightstrike and Darkfate, twin blasts searing into the skies!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Tag Nightstrike, Darkfate, Elder, Maximals)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;(Da&#39;minions &amp; Legacy)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _&lt;BR&gt;Be a better friend, newshound, and &lt;BR&gt;know-it-all with Yahoo!
