His estimates had been off, \nhe didn&#39;t have enough explosives to blow apart the mountain, much less \ncollapse it.  He&#39;d have to find a group to use for his own needs...but which \none?\n\nThe Maximals was out of the question.  He wanted nothing to do with them, \nother than opening fire on them.  The Predacons?  No...too disorganized.  The \nAlliance?  That was a good choice...small...yet powerful group.  He should be \nable to dupe them quite nicely...\n\nUnitron transformed into his space fighter mode, launching out of the \nvolcano, getting a course set for the Alliance base, his afterburners blasted \nto their full speed, launching him towards the Alliance base.\n\n======\n\nSerpentor was closing in on the Alliance base.  He truly didn&#39;t think Hell \nBeast would take him back, Megatron was a complete idiot, and the Maximals \njust plain sucked.  On the other hand, the Alliance HAD killed him until Koga \nShuko had cloned him.\n\nHe stopped.  He was just a clone!  He wasn&#39;t the real thing.  Serpentor was \ndead.  He was just a copy.  A very handsome copy, but still just a copy.  But \nthen again, he was just as good as the original Serpentor, but he wasn&#39;t THE \nSerpentor, or was he?  He shook his head.\n\n&quot;Slag that Unitron!&quot; he yelld.  The snake had planned on staying there for a \nlong time, until Unitron started killing everybody inside Shuko&#39;s base, then \nblew the slagging base apart!\n\nThe cobra-bot sighed, continuing to walk for the Alliance base.\n\n"}}
