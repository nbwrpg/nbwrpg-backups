Those angelions were mere \nmockery...\n\nThey both entered the control room where Daemos, Belthassan and \nAnachronox were. Melchana came in moments later.\n\nDaemos: Alright. We will start now, no need to wait for Strika... \nTripredacus, we are on the brink of a new age. In short time, we will \nstart to gather more and more energon, and send it back to Raiko-Fhi \n8. However, there are shadows in our skies. First, the Infecticons. We \nshall deal with them in their own time. Also, more concretely, we have \nto deal with a direct threat to our plan. Prophecy, display world map, \nenergon concentration and Spark location.\n\nThe computer complied.\n\nDaemos: Geological study reveals that fertile grounds for the energon \nfruits are in this area (points towards greece). However, There are \nmany transformers in there, more precisely inside the volcano named \nthe Etna. I do not know exactly who is there, but expectations are for \nworst, hopes for the best. Gesper will soon be recalled as to permit \nthe assistance of Prophetus in case of danger, so this means the \nProphets go. I shall go too. Anachronox will be coming as well as \nJetstorm. Tankor, you will be in charge of the Shadow Destiny until we \nreturn. Questions?\n\n\n"}}
