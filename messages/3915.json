He looks from Oblitertron to her as she walks closer to the alliance \ngestalt. If Oblitertron was mad, which he probably was, things could get \nugly, like they ussually do.\n\nProwl flies toward Iron Raptor, reaching her in time to hear her send her \nmessage to the Oblitercons. His eyes widen. He was not going to lose her, \neven if it meant fighting Oblitertron one on one. That was rediculous, he \nrealizes, landing next to Iron Raptor, a one on one between him and the \ngestalt would end in seconds, with him more that likely on the bottom of \nOblitertron&#39;s foot.\n\nProwl&#39;s optics widen as he hears her take take responcibility for something \nthe rest of the maximals have done. She was insane! He looks at her. She \nmight be insane, but she was beatiful, event through all the damage she has \nsustained.\n\nHe looks at her, his optics full of love as he walks up to her.\n\n&quot;If you&#39;re going to get yourself slagged,&quot; he says, &quot;I&#39;m going to be here \nwith you.&quot;\n\nHe stops near her. This was not just a useless gesture of love, it was a \nprecaution. If Oblitertron decided to attack, Prowl could get himself and \nIron Raptor out of there faster than she could have escaped herself.\n\n"}}
