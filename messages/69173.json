With a short burst of power they fired,\n&gt; &gt; cutting Scorponok free=\r\n, and severing his link to the base! Inside\n&gt; &gt; the screens that had been c=\r\nounting down the containment breech\n&gt; &gt; went black as thier feed was lost. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However the voice could still be heard from outside, &quot;10 . . . \n9=\r\n . . . \n&gt; &gt; 8 . . . 7 . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus glanced at Zarak, flashing him a=\r\nn ugly look, but quickly \ncomplied. Zarak turned back to look at the screen=\r\n, ignoring \nPerceptor&#39;s inaction. \n&gt; \n&gt; From outside the voice continued: 6=\r\n . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; With a rumble Skorponok came to life. Screens =\r\ncame to life in front \nof Zarak as he smiled to himself. Another rumble as =\r\nthe drill claws \nbegan to turn and with a push the giant crab began to push=\r\n its way \nbeneath the ground of the chamber, leaving it behind. \n&gt; \n&gt; Behin=\r\nd it the voice finished its count down: 3 . . . 2 . . . \n1 . . . \n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n . . .  and then the room exploded as large pipes burst and \ntrapped heat f=\r\nlowed into the chamber, and then quickly behind it \nmagma that liquifyed me=\r\ntal and stone. As it burst through the room it \npushed up the main chamber =\r\nand corridores that led out of it, ripping \nits way to the surface. Pushing=\r\n along the main corridore, but also \nfinding the pathway that had been crea=\r\nted by Megatron from above. \n&gt; \n&gt; Beneath all this Skorponok fled the scene=\r\n - Zarak, Cyclonus, \nRodimus, Scourge and Perceptor all held safely inside.=\r\n Beghind the \ndigging machine weapons opened fire, slagging the tunnel behi=\r\nnd it, \nclosing off the tunnel from the flow of magma as it dug its way \nto=\r\nwards the black tower, Hydras&#39; base, far in the distance. \n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG: Perce=\r\nptor, Any)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
