If Ice hadn&#39;t stepped \nbetween them the blast would have h=\r\nit him. He reached to draw his \nweapon when Ice rose her wings blocking his=\r\n shot. &quot;Get down!,&quot; he \nyelled trying to take aim at the insane bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nNone of that in here.&quot; Ice yelled equally demanding, &quot;This is a \nplace of p=\r\neace and it&#39;ll stay that way.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Grizzltron wasn&#39;t very happy that thie=\r\nr chat was inturupted. He \nfealt outnumbered and outgunned. His firepower w=\r\nas the only thing \nseperating him and the odds. Veratis wrapped his large b=\r\nat wings \naround the bear bot and used his unseemingly strength to hold \nGr=\r\nizzltrons arms at his sides. &quot;I already warned you once that that \nwill not=\r\n be permitted in my home.&quot; The old scientist bit down on the \nother bots sh=\r\noulder draining enough energy to weaken him enough to \nforce him into a CR =\r\nchamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That should give him some time to cool down.&quot; Veratis says \n=\r\ntransforming back to his robot mode. &quot;Now then Mustex was it? Take \nIce wit=\r\nh you and bring your &quot;son&quot; to me and I&#39;ll take good care of \nhim.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ice=\r\n didn&#39;t want to go that way, she wanted to return to Lunarpine \nand the oth=\r\ners. She thought about thier times together and had to go \nwith Mustex, She=\r\n remembered all the times she&#39;d tried to help her \nlove and ended up gettin=\r\ng herself hurt and in one case nearly lost \nher spark. This time she&#39;d trus=\r\nt him to get the job done without \nworrying about her.\n\n\n"}}
