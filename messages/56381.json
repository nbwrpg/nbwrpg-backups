If you so desire, return \nto the \n&gt; outer perimeter as well. But I would prefer not. It may attract \nattention. & \n&gt; that is the LAST thing I want to do.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Within her, she was so torn. She ached to return to the Predacon \nbase. \n&gt; Curious to know of Hydras. She had to admit it, but she would \nnever show it. \n&gt; Unless it was around him, privately.. no one else watching or \nnearby. \n&gt; Emotions were not something to have, specially for a Decepticon \nwarrior. \n&gt; \n&gt; But as her optics went to the frozen limp form of the original \nMegatron... \n&gt; the ache was worse.\n\n\n"}}
