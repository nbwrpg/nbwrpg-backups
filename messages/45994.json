Yet you seem to believe \nmy\n&gt; &gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reason for being here is to kill your charachters. Remember \ndewboy I\n&gt; &gt; was in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this RPG long before you were. And at least when I joined I \ndidnt\n&gt; &gt; mode by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world hopping and giving noone chances to respond to your posts. \nNow\n&gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t you grow up a little and stop provoking me as that is what \nyou\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing. If I wanted Dewboy I could have easily killed Mustex and\n&gt; &gt; stallex when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they were in gorzos sub since I controlled gorzo at the time. In\n&gt; &gt; other words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dewboy, just shut the hell up and stop making accusations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
