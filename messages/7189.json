He will give us the \nadvantage!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Gremlin shrugs, and the four raise up. They take shots at each \nof the \n&gt; Maximal bots, Smokescreen, Ramulus, Kluster, Striker, and Rex. \nTransanulas \n&gt; sends a small batch of five cluster missles at Rex, while Gremlin \nuses both \n&gt; optic lasers and a semi-automatic riffle to bring down Strriker. \nJackle, with \n&gt; an assult riffle fires at Smokescreen, and Hell Beast, armed with \nboth chain \n&gt; gun and a newly added shoulder missle launcer, fire at Kluster and \nRamulus. \n&gt; :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Megatron easily makes it into the skeleton which was once the \nArk. With \n&gt; his massive transmetal 2 body he glances around and spies what he \nhad been \n&gt; looking for. The powercore. He threw a detenator on it, and backed \naway from \n&gt; the core. He made his way into what was left of the bridge, \nrummaged throught \n&gt; some scrap and decided to threaten the Maximals on his personal \ncomm unit. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Megatron ::: Attention Maximals....I have a bomb on the Ark. \nEthier you \n&gt; surrender the Cybertronian Fire, or I will blow apart the Ark and \nsend us ALL \n&gt; into non exsistance. And belive me. I would love nothing more than \nto see \n&gt; Decepticons rule the galaxy, even if it dosent mean Predacons will \never be \n&gt; created. You have five minutes to surrender it, and no one can make \nit from \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire to the Ark in five minutes. \n&gt; \n&gt; ::: He laughs, and turns on the bomb and its five minute countdown \n&gt; begins....:::\n\n\n"}}
