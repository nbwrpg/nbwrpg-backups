He had seen a shred of life and then\n&gt; nothing.  He had always tried to keep his composure but he could not help\n&gt; but let a tear of despair run down his right cheek.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No!  Silverbolt, don&#39;t do this to me!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At first he doesn&#39;t answer Leo Prime.  Silverbolt was his priority now.  He\n&gt; quickly places a hand on Silverbolts chest and performs an energy\n&gt; transfusion from his body to Silverbolt.  Yet his own reserves were not at a\n&gt; hundred percent either.  He didn&#39;t care, all he cared about was getting his\n&gt; friend back to the shuttle with what life he could give him.\n&gt;\n&gt; As energy flows from his body into Silverbolts Tucson begins to falter a bit\n&gt; in mid air.  Yet as swift as he was in flight, he could see the shuttle\n&gt; ahead.  But would he make it in time before his own system shut down?\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just a little more.   Almost there.   Leo Rodimus is not respondent at\n&gt; this time.  I - have not received word as - of yet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He struggles to fight off the urge to make an emergency landing.  Instead he\n&gt; uses the last of his reserves to speed up his flight pace and is now just a\n&gt; few feet from the shuttle, but losing altitude while doing so.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Can&#39;t keep the altitude much longer.  I&#39;m coming in.  Have the - shuttle\n&gt; ready for boarding...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe energy infusion from TUSCON into SILVERBOLT, while leaving TUSCON\nextremely tired seems to have a beneficial affect. His optics light\nvery dimly. He is no where near conscious, but his spark energy\ncontinues to stay lit at a very low level.\n\n&quot;I read you.&quot; LEO PRIME says over the comlink. &quot;The shuttle should be\nreaching you momentairlly. Once you recharge we will need someone to\nmake absolutely sure that Rodimus is a Predacon now.&quot; There a short\npause as LEO&#39;s voice drops slightly. &quot;He deserves that, and I believe\nhe deserves our most earnest effort.&quot;\n\nEven as LEO stopped talking the shuttle can be seen on the horizon,\nits boxy shape was dark in the skies of early morning. The sun had not\nyet risen in the skies of ancient Earth but the light of it was making\nitself seen at last. A new day was about to be born, and hopefully new\nhope as well.\n\n&quot;We see you.&quot; SANTON said over a short range to TUSCON, &quot;The doors\nwill be open and ready for you when you arrive. We have the supplies\nyou need.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
