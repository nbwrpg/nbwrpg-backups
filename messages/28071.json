He knew that it was probably Iron Raptor&#39;s thoughts he was \nreading, but he didn&#39;t really care. He was acting on instinct. \nProwl&#39;s mind had never felt anything like this before, and now the \ncreature was in control, rage and instincts determining his actions.\n\nProwl replies to Iron Raptor with a roar, also beginning to toward \nMenasor. He got her thoughts, understanding them perfectly. Menasor \nwas going to go down.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Breath rasped in her lungs, snorting to clear them of the scent \nof the ash \n&gt; as her keen eye-sight penitrated the clouds that surrounded the \nfield.\n&gt; Her head had snepped towards the direction of a roar seconds after \nhears her \n&gt; left her throat, trying to see as far as she could and only \nmannaging to see \n&gt; a...feathery outline?\n&gt; But her thoughts told her who it was.\n&gt; &lt; Prowl....&gt;\n&gt; * Her logicle mind controled this mode, but the wild sense was \nstill there \n&gt; and was eager to get into the fight.\n&gt; There was a slight flash of light in the ash before she heard a \nvoice boom \n&gt; over the clashes of metal against metal and yells of angry bots.\n&gt; She snarled/roared when a stray shot sent from Menasor landed a few \nfeet \n&gt; away from her, sending dirt flying towards her face.\n&gt; Growling she backed away and then began to move towards his \nposition, \n&gt; glancing towards Prowls direction as she moved.\n&gt; She&#39;d decided on a target.\n&gt; Since she really didn&#39;t want to use speech right now she roared, \nwaiting for \n&gt; a reply from him.\n&gt; It was clear communications, explainign that a gustalt such as \nMenasor could \n&gt; be taken by them IF they moved together and in one songle unit.\n&gt; It was time to get to work.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
