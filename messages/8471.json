WIth a swipe of his hand, he knocked away \nthe quills, firing off a blast from his rocket launcher at Shadow Wing, as \nwell as three blue optic blasts at her left leg.\n\nHades yelled, a quill stabbing into his shoulder.  Raising his missile \nlauncher, he fired a rocket off at Spear&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nUnitron entered the control room, spotting Teletran-1.  Walking up to the \ncomputer, he smiled.  &quot;With the Ark in ruins, this is the last piece of \nequipment that needs be destroyed.&quot; Reaching into subspace, he took out two \ncharges.  Setting both on Teletran-1.  He then too out two grenades, getting \nto the doorway, throwing them, one in the middle of Teletran-1&#39;s charges, the \nother hitting Teletran-2.  The grenade set off the charges on Teletran-1.\n\nUnitron ran for where Koga Shuko was, chuckling.\n\n\n"}}
