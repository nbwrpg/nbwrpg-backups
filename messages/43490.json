He was lucky he \nhadn&#39;t\n&gt; been kicked out. But he had no choice but to kill his opponent, if \nhe\n&gt; hadn&#39;t, he would be dead now. He wondered about his next match. \nWould he\n&gt; see Epyon?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Epyon::\n&gt; \n&gt; He stood prepared for his next battle. He knew not to expect the \nease he\n&gt; found in his last match, but he was ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; (KSL, this free for all, do all of the round 1 winners just go at \nit?\n&gt; And will you officialy start it?)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::DrillBit/KitKat2::\n&gt; \n&gt; They both watched as the drones worked at extracting Foxfingers \nspark.\n&gt; DrillBit chuckled and KitKat had an evil smile on her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I might have missed the post but I dont remember a reply on this\n&gt; earlier Cyberwolf.

He was also thinking about his new position as Maximal\n&gt; Commander.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I dont know what Prowl was doing last, so I&#39;m starting off like \nthat.\n&gt; Also I need to know what the majority of Maximals are doing and what \nis\n&gt; happaning at Maximal City.
