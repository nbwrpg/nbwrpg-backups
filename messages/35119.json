He found himself wanting to kill her, but he manages to stop himself from losing his temper.\n\n\n\n&quot;I admit I acted without autorization,&quot; he says through his teeth, though now he was in the spotlight. He couldn&#39;t justify him going against IR&#39;s wishes by anything other than her not deciding quickly enough, which wasn&#39;t true because he hadn&#39;t talked with her too much about it, and on top of that, accusing her of anything was the last thing he wanted to do. In short, he couldn&#39;t continue that sentance, because it would either falsly accuse his mate of being a bad commander, or make him admit that he was a faliure as a soldier. For a split second, Prowl wished that he had dropped Iris into that creek that he and IR had riden by on their way to merge their sparks, back when Iris was still a computer program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * IR&#39;s thoughts suddenly turned red hot at Prowl.&lt; I KNOW! &gt;\n\n&gt; And that thought would hit Prowl like a slap in the face.\n\n&gt; IR had a little grain of hate for him for going behind her back like that, \n\n&gt; as well as a shaken trust.\n\n&gt; Though the fact that the city would help them weighed more then her emotions \n\n&gt; for it.\n\n&gt; In truth she hated this city with a passion, but instead of liking it, she \n\n&gt; simply put up with it because it made her Maximals lives a little safer.\n\n&gt; Though, if Prowl ever did anything like that again, she would do something \n\n&gt; not so pleasent.\n\n&gt; And Iris turned a glare at Prowl.*\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Iris: &quot; You did something without your commanders authorization.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * Iris walked up to Prowl so that her armor covered face was less then an \n\n&gt; inch from his.*\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Iris:  &quot;Weather they would have gotten the ship or not, it&#39;s your duty as a \n\n&gt; soldier to inform your commander of what actions you want to take and ask \n\n&gt; permission.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * She poked a finger at his chest.*\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Iris: &quot;You did no such thing.
