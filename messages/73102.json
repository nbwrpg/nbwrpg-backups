Both of them fall to\n&gt; &gt; the ground, their =\r\nsystems failing as they did so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However there are more right behin=\r\nd, ever ready to take the place of\n&gt; &gt; their fallen comrades. Horseflies ma=\r\ny indeed be an applicable\n&gt; &gt; illustration of their attack method, if Horse=\r\nflies were as large as\n&gt; &gt; you were and had large teeth that could easily p=\r\nenetrate your armor as\n&gt; &gt; well. However just like the proverbial horsefly =\r\nthey were easy to\n&gt; &gt; kill, but unfortunately there are always more!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; At the same RAT TRAP is also facing his share of these creaturs as\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhey were able to fly and swoop and maneuver in ways that they never\n&gt; &gt; see=\r\nmed to be able to do before.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; DINOBOT paused.  Th=\r\ne SHARKTICONS seemed to be barely sentient, but reliant\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upon a general=\r\n to give them orders ni battle and direct them.  However, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; GENERAL =\r\nseemed to be content to hold back, and fighting him directly would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; req=\r\nuire simultaneously engaging him AND his forces.  The DINOBOT of old\n&gt; &gt;&gt; w=\r\nould have relished such a challenge, but for this new incarnation, &#39;honor&#39;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the last thing on his processor.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Going to try and engag=\r\ne the SHARKTICONS group by gruop, attempting to thin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; down thier number=\r\ns with hit and run tactics, counting that the groups would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be trying t=\r\no pursue them to just overwhelm with numbers, and thus running\n&gt; &gt;&gt; into on=\r\ne another and messing up their formations with each hit and run\n&gt; &gt;&gt; attack=\r\n of his own, trying to thin the herd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT is re=\r\nasonably astute in his assessment of the situation, at\n&gt; &gt; least as far as =\r\nhe could see it. SKYBYTE did seem to be giving them\n&gt; &gt; general direction a=\r\nnd impetus. While he was not controlling them by\n&gt; &gt; remote control or on a=\r\nn individual basis, he was acting as a guiding\n&gt; &gt; force in matters, direct=\r\ning them to where the MAXIMAL and PREDACON\n&gt; &gt; forces were the weakest and =\r\nexploiting what he could.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Using his superior speed and armor DINOB=\r\nOT is able to begin the act of\n&gt; &gt; thinning their number as his hit and run=\r\n tactics are beginning to have\n&gt; &gt; an impact on the SHARKTICONS!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was of a different mindset, just goin=\r\ng to charge in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; directly over towards SKYBYTE!  Of course, this would l=\r\nead his charge right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; through the main cluster of SHARKTICONS, and give=\r\n them a golden opportunity\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to dogpile (or sharkpile) on him..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n SKYBYTE blinked as he noted VICE GRIP moving straight through the\n&gt; &gt; SHAR=\r\nKTICONS coming straight at him. In a quick move he has the\n&gt; &gt; SHARKTICONS =\r\nconverge on his position in an effort to pile up on the\n&gt; &gt; approaching VIC=\r\nE GRIP!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However that maneuver also has the affect of further thinn=\r\ning out the\n&gt; &gt; ranks as they focused on the center. It is at that point th=\r\nat the\n&gt; &gt; MAXIMAL FUZORS begin to act, their teeth and claws ripping throu=\r\ngh the\n&gt; &gt; SHARKTICONS, spreading out and attacking left and right creating=\r\n an\n&gt; &gt; explosion of confusion that SKYBYTE was having trouble directing.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson continues to step forth to face=\r\n Magmatron.  With no fear,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; just the courage he was programmed with, he=\r\n takes a brave step forward.  He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; holds his hand back to Leo and Big Co=\r\nnvoy.  It was clear that he wanted to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fight him on his own, knowing th=\r\nat it was his idea to come this far and he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; alone had to complete the j=\r\nourney.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; Leo, Convoy, help Optimus, I will deal with Magmatron.=\r\n  I started this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; journey, now I must complete it.    Very well Magmatr=\r\non you have your\n&gt; &gt;&gt; battle. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; He takes his Martial Arts stance=\r\n, and prepares to go one on one with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Magmatron.  And hopefully win bac=\r\nk what the Silver Dragon had fought for so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many years .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY nod, =E2=80=9CBe careful. . . he is probrably the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; most dangerous foe here and I would guess the most dangerous one you\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; have ever met.=E2=80=9D They quickly take off towards OPTIMUS!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\neanwhile MAGMATRON smiled, =E2=80=9CSo you sent off your backup?
