He really didn&#39;t want to leave Battera, \nbut knowing where Pantron was he didn&#39;t want to bring her either.\n    &quot;Battera, if you wish you can return to my base and hang out untill I \nreturn. I have to go to Hell Beast&#39;s layer to retrive a fallen comrade. I \nwill be back.&quot; CyberShark called out ot Battera.\n    He zommed away toward Hell Beast&#39;s base. As soon as he was in radar range \nhe cloaked. He went in and fired everything he had at Sniper. He knew it \nproboly wouldn&#39;t kill him, but it would make him think about attacking the \nDestrons again. He landed and picked up Pantron. He then lifted off and flew \noff to the Destron base.\n\n"}}
