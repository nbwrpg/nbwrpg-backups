She lifted her head and looked \n&gt; around. Her shoulder was becoming extremly painful. She winced and \n&gt; layed her head back down. She was thinking about how Lunarpine had \n&gt; reacted to her. She was certain that he wasn&#39;t happy with her new \n&gt; form. She sighed and stood up. She smelled that scent again. She \n&gt; looked and saw a form coming towards her. She didn&#39;t think anything \n&gt; of it and kept walking. Leaving a puddle of blood in the snow where \n&gt; she had layed down at. Her bandaged was soaked and was falling off. \n&gt; She shrugged her shoulder and let out a pained roar. THe bandage \nfell \n&gt; to the ground and she sniffed it. It smelled aweful and acidy. \n&gt; \n&gt; She walked on, as the snow fell to the ground a little harder. \n\n\n"}}
