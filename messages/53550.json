S=\r\netting \n  &gt;   the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly\n  &gt; tapping =\r\nthe bars \n  &gt;   persuaded the birds out, setting them free. Well,\n  &gt; that =\r\nexplained the \n  &gt;   empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor\n  &gt;=\r\n began to tell\n  &gt;   &gt; this story.  One day Satan and Jesus were having\n  &gt;=\r\n a conversation. \n  &gt;   Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and\n  =\r\n&gt; he was gloating and \n  &gt;   boasting.  &quot;Yes, sir, I just caught the world =\r\nfull\n  &gt; of people down \n  &gt;   there.

Why, yo=\r\nu don&#39;t want them \n  birds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mister.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; They&#39;r=\r\ne just plain old field \n  birds. They don&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; &gt; They ain&#39;t even \n  pretty!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &quot;How much?&quot; th=\r\ne pastor asked \n  again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; The boy sized up the past=\r\nor as if he were \n  crazy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; said, &quot;$10?&quot;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; The pastor reached in his pocket and took out =\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ten&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; dollar bill. He placed it in the =\r\nboy&#39;s hand. \n  In&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a flash, the boy &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; was gone. T=\r\nhe pastor picked \n  up the cage and gently&lt;BR&gt;&gt; carried it to the &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp;&nbsp; end of \n  the alley where there was a tree and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gra=\r\nssy spot. Setting \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cage down, he opened the door=\r\n, and by softly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  tapping the bars &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; persuaded =\r\nthe birds out, setting them \n  free. Well,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that explained the &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp; empty bird cage on \n  the pulpit, and then the pastor&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; began to tell&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  this story.&nbsp; One day Sata=\r\nn and Jesus were having&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a conversation. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat=\r\nan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  he was gloating an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; boasting.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, sir, I just \n  caught the worl=\r\nd full&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of people down &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; there. Set \n  me a trap,=\r\n used bait I knew they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t resist. Got &#39;em \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; all!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &quot;What are you going to do \n  with them?=\r\n&quot; Jesus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; asked.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Satan replied, &quot;Oh, \n  I&#39;m =\r\ngonna have fun! I&#39;m&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gonna&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; teach them how \n=\r\n  to marry and divorce each other,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how to hate and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; \n  abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; curse. I&#39;m gon=\r\nna teach \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; them how to invent guns and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; &gt; \n  bombs and kill each other. I&#39;m really gonna have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  f=\r\nun!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; &quot;And what will you do when you get done \n  wi=\r\nth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Jesus asked.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n \n  &gt; &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kill &#39;em,&quot; Satan glared proudly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt=\r\n; &quot;How \n  much do you want for them?&quot; Jesus asked.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Oh, you \n  don&#39;t want those people. They ain&#39;t no&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt=\r\n; good.

He asked \n  again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Satan looked=\r\n at Jesus and sneered, &quot;All \n  your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blood,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;=\r\n tears and your \n  life.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Jesus said, &quot;DONE!&quot; Then=\r\n He paid the \n  price.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; The pastor picked up the ca=\r\nge he opened the \n  door&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; he walked fro=\r\nm the pulpit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo! \n  Groups Sponsor \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  ADVERTISEM=\r\nENT&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; Your use of Yahoo!
