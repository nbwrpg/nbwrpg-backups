It seemed stratigically sound at this \npoint. &quot;Open a \n&gt; channle to Killfest. ...Killfest? This is Commander Ominous Prime \nof the \n&gt; Energon forces. I am willing to aid you if you allow us some \ncontrol over \n&gt; what will become of the Autobots, or the Ark. Our energon based \nweapons are \n&gt; excellent, and after enough bombarding we can slice right through \nthose \n&gt; shields. Do you agree to the terms?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
