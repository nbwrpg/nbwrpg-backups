Having your base that far down under is a tradeoff I guess. I toned your weapons list down without realizing the depth, but with all the complaints I&#39;ve been getting I think a good tradeoff (and physically possible) would be to have almost no defences since its that far down.\n\n\n\nAlso, LN, the council&#39;s been recieving complaints about you acting like a council member. You&#39;ve been telling members what they can and cannot do, and you&#39;ve made quite alot of people&#39;s RPGing experience much worse. Please stop this instantly. The council has the job of policeing the RPG, and we&#39;ll call a mode if we see it. Until such a time when you are on the council, though, please refrain from attempting to moderate the RPG.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt; Ignatius looked up still wondering how he&#39;d got beaten on this badly.
