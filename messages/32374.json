Unfortunatly it would be quite hard to lift him\nto face elvel for he is already 14 and half feet tall. He reached for\nthe hand of Dinobot with his left hand wile thrusting his sword at the\nmidsection of Dinobots body.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; OOC&quot; 1. those were emp grenadades with a 15 foot radius...meaning your\n&gt; power levels would be low from the emp effects...2. FireBlade is 15\n&gt; and a half feet tall so i am thinkin you won&#39;t have to lift him to\n&gt; face hieght\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ** An evil smile crept across his reptilian lips when he saw just\n&gt; what his attacks had done to the intended prey, moving to approach\n&gt; FireBlade when he suddenly detected movement. At the sighted angles of\n&gt; the enemy body, internal systems and years of hardcore war experience\n&gt; tracked which positions FireBlade&#39;s body would be in next and warned\n&gt; Dinobot of impending danger.  He knew that every attempt that the\n&gt; enemy made to resist the effects of paralysis were futile and he\n&gt; dodged his attack easily, however, the missiles had not missed the\n&gt; ground in which he had stood second before and on impact they sent\n&gt; shrapnel spiraling in every direction. A rather large piece piercing\n&gt; the armor which covered Dinobot&#39;s biceps before falling to the ground.\n&gt; &gt; The transmetal raptor snarled at the small trickle of mech-fluid\n&gt; which emanated from the wound, only glancing at it before continuing\n&gt; on his way to the location of his downed prey. Approaching FireBlade\n&gt; from behind he looked the robot over, optics narrowed and searching\n&gt; for any movement which might betray this beings current state.\n&gt; Satisfied that this transformer was defeated yet alive, Dinobot\n&gt; clipped his weapon into a hip holster before leaning down quickly and\n&gt; going to grab the back of FireBlade&#39;s head with his clawed hand, then\n&gt; moving to pull back and lift so that the enemy would be lifted to face\n&gt; height. **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at\n&gt; http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
