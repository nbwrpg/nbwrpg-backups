The war suit\n&gt; designed for him from K-9&#39;s body parts by Blaze was holding up nicely,\n&gt; but he was still shedding some mechfluid where the suit had been\n&gt; punctured. He activates the infared goggles, looking around and seeing\n&gt; where the enemies were firing at him from better than before. What he\n&gt; needed was a drill to get to Prebon, or....\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer lowers in altitude, able to see his enemies and avoid most of\n&gt; the attacks. The shots that did hit him didn&#39;t do too much damage, but\n&gt; he tried to avoid them all anyways. Thanks to his scanners and infared\n&gt; vision, he could see the entrance to the tunnel that Prebon was in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer aims a missile from each of his two shoulder-mounted missile\n&gt; launcher at the two bots firing at him, letting loose two\n&gt; signature-seeking missiles at each.
