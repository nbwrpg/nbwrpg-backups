HOw does it feel to be square?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wheelie glanced, listening, &quot;Well, then tell me what you do, if you can say\n&gt; who made you too?&quot;  Listening softly, &quot;Who made you all the way out here?\n&gt; Without anyone else knowing the cheer?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This sounded very peculiar to him, as he knew that even with the Maximals\n&gt; focused on the Predacons, they were hardly going to have missed a large\n&gt; facility wtih a large grouping of units within it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Much less where all of thier equipment and weapons had come from. W hile\n&gt; Wheelie had seen many &#39;escaped and abandoned&#39; colonies, they were not\n&gt; remotely as well equipped as this place was.\n&gt;\n&gt; Feeling a bit worried, &quot;Can you tell me who it was, that said this thing\n&gt; because?&quot;  Poitning at the symbol, &quot;What was his name, and where from did he\n&gt; came?&quot;  Walking along then, not sitting, &quot;And thank you, but I must know..\n&gt; Where was he from, where did he go?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a thoughtful frown on UNUS&#39; face as he looked at WHEELIE.\n&quot;As to who made us?&quot; All joy leeched from his face as he spoke, being\nreplaced by solemnity or even perhaps anger. &quot;It was Magmatron, or\nbetter yet his wicked servant Saberback.&quot;\n\nASTRA slightly nodded from her position from beside UNUS but otherwise\nmaintained her dignified standing. There were other short nods of\nassent from around the room as well.\n\n&quot;We were among the first of his experiments.&quot; UNUS spoke in low tones,\nhis voice hard as his optics blazed slightly. &quot;But we were more than\nhe had anticipated and were able to escape our captors and found our\nway here.&quot;\n\nHe gestured at the building around them, &quot;It is we who have built this\nstructure and we who stand firm against they who would control the\njungle.&quot;\n\nReturning his arm to his side UNUS looked squarely at WHEELIE, &quot;As to\nwho it was that spoke to us about your coming, we have no name for\nhim. He told us a few small things about himself and then was overcome\nby his injuries.&quot;\n\nThere was slight smile, &quot;However we have repaired him. My physicians\nwere just informing me that he had awakened when you arrived. This was\na most serendipitous event indeed.&quot;\n\nUNUS gestured, &quot;Come I will take you to him.&quot; His gestures were to one\nof the side doors leading further into the structure. &quot;Perhaps he will\nhave answers for you as well.&quot;\n\nASTRA and FIREHORN made to follow as well.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
