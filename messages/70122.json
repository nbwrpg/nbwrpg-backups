We had a little glitch in our battle pla=\r\nns... Tucson Prime told us ta stay outside the fortress, and we did, and wh=\r\nen he went inside with Kup ta try&#39;n get Nightshift out, he got captured, ag=\r\nain. But this time I think he wanted ta get captured.. Some sorta new strat=\r\negy he&#39;s tryn&#39; out. As for us... I - dunno but Quickstride&#39;s got that look =\r\nin his eyes.. He&#39;s itchn&#39; for a fight. Normally I would just stay out of it=\r\n, but, ya know somethn&#39;, I&#39;m itchn&#39; for some payback too. Wheels is in ther=\r\ne and he&#39;s givn&#39; it his all! The least we can do is return the favor and do=\r\n our part out here. We&#39;ll keep the com link open sir, so that way ya know w=\r\ne&#39;re still with ya....\n\n&quot;WHAT???&quot; Elder said, surprise making the word loud=\r\ner than he had\nintended, &quot;They&#39;re all captured?&quot; He said as he stood up and=\r\n leaned\nover on the control panel in front of him. &quot;FRAG!&quot; he said as he\ncl=\r\nosed his optics and rubbed his head in frustration.\n\nIt was about at that t=\r\nime that little Elita came in the room . . .\n\n&gt; eliat Woke up and walked to=\r\nwards command room, she still had her teddy bear in her arms, then she came=\r\n in and saw Lord elder\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord elder, where is my uncle?&quot;said worried the=\r\n girl\n\nElder turned to look at Elita as he sat down, attempting to push the=\r\n\nfear and panic out of his voice and expression.\n\n&quot;He . . . He is on a miss=\r\nion Elita.&quot; Elder said as he hoped that the\nsmile he plastered on his face =\r\nwould look convincing enough.\n\nAs he talked  Elder pushed the mute button s=\r\no that Elita couldn&#39;t hear\nthe plan that Rat Trap and Quickstride were atte=\r\nmpting.\n\n&quot;I hope . . . I mean . . . I&#39;m sure he will be home soon.&quot; Elder s=\r\naid\nas he walked over to the young Autobot, &quot;Did you need help getting\nback=\r\n to sleep?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
