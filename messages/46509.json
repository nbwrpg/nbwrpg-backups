He had no optics \navailable, and didn&#39;t want to spend the time to make them, so he had \nimplanted a infrared sensor to do for the moment.\n\nHe places the head onto Perceptor&#39;s upper torso, and brushes off his \nhands. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; His precise hands open Perceptor&#39;s chest \ncompartment, and he attaches several cords to specific locations. He \nthen connects those cords to a machine that resembles an electric \nchair. Switchblade sits in the chair, and draws a few more cords to \nhim and attaches them to the back of his neck, and to his chest.\n\nA few of Nightstrike&#39;s strong thoughts of escape nudge at his \nconcentration, but he shrugs them off, &lt;Later Nightstrike, I&#39;ve got \nmore important things to attend to...&gt;.\n\nA few key memories need to be deleted from Perceptor&#39;s mind. \nSwitchblade was about to dive in, and make the necessary \ncorrections. The green glow leaves his optics, and the battle of the \nmind begins between Perceptor and Switchblade.\n\n\n"}}
