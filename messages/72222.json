It was clear that she\n&gt; was upset and a little offended at the same time.  But only Rattrap knew why\n&gt; as he stands beside her with a paw over her right front haunch, minding the\n&gt; quills on her shoulder blades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry Prickles, I&#39;ve had faith in your brother since the first time\n&gt; I saw him.  It ain&#39;t every day I save a stranger but, I saw something in\n&gt; him, something different, and something not everyone could see.  He was sure\n&gt; worth the risk, look where he is now, he&#39;s a leader, and yeah he&#39;s new ta\n&gt; the job but, he still has that special something that ya don&#39;t see every\n&gt; day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot turns to him with a smile and a heart felt hug.  Rattrap\n&gt; smiles as he returns the hug.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Know something Rattrap?  Looks like us rodents gotta stick together. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Definitely.  Since a certain feline seems ta be missing the big picture\n&gt; here, you&#39;re absolutely right.  I bet he&#39;d learn a thing or two if he got a\n&gt; few quills stuck in his paws. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot tries not to comment but listens.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That would definitely get to the point but I dunno.  To me, solving\n&gt; differences happens when you ask to speak to someone privately and try to\n&gt; come to a reasonable resolve.  But I sure do dislike the fact that Leo has\n&gt; no personal relation skills.  I mean, seriously, if you want your comrades\n&gt; to respect you but, the leader has ta also show a little compassion if he&#39;s\n&gt; to be properly respected.  And that&#39;s what&#39;s bothering me.  Is it that hard\n&gt; to be nice as well as authoritative ?  Tucson does that and more and he\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even try to. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorta like what your pal Ratchet was like.  He had a temper but he gave it\n&gt; his all ta save the lives of those who needed saving.  In fact, all those\n&gt; times he put his life on the line for everyone, just like the old CMO would\n&gt; do.  He&#39;s also got Ratchet&#39;s expressions..  You guys may be more connected\n&gt; ta the old medic in more ways than one.  You too.  You got his heart and so\n&gt; does your brother.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She looks to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait are you saying that Ratchet might have been our- our dad?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Might be, I&#39;m sure we got plenty of intel on it.  I&#39;m sure Legacy will be\n&gt; able ta do a search for us because it is your right ta know.  He could&#39;ve\n&gt; been family and it&#39;s your right ta find your roots.  I actually wonder if\n&gt; Lord Elder might know a little bit about that...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSANTON nodded as he took in the information. &quot;I am sure that LEO will\nlet us know soon enough.&quot; He pulled out his storage pack, checking to\nmake sure that any medical supplies that should be needed were there.\nInterestingly enough there were no offensive weaponry in any of\nSANTON&#39;s gear, although that might make sense bing that he is a doctor\nan not a soldier.\n\nWINGCALIBER on the other hand listed to RAT TRAP and STRAIGHT grumble\nabout LEO PRIME&#39;s leadership skills. &quot;What do you find so trying about\nLEO PRIME?&quot; WINGCALBER said as he walked up to RAT RAP and STRIGHT\nSHOT, his tone more curious than anything else.\n\n&quot;I have noticed that Tuscon and Leo Prime have different goals, whoch\nis most likely to be the case, since they are different people, but\nwhat else do your see as different?&quot;  like a teacher who paused to try\nto puzzle out a problem that a student was having with homework.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
