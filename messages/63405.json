She swept down and landed on the ground. Transforming into bot\nmode, she checked her scanners.  Two clicks north were two bots on her\nscreen.  She double checked the readings, they appeared to be\nMaximals.  She changed back into owl mode and took to the skies.  It\ntook her no time at all to track the signal.  After a few minutes, she\ncould see two figures on the edge of the woods.  Yes, the signals were\nMaximal.  But why did they look like they had thier face plates fused\ntogether. She wondered what kind of bot world she had found herself\nin.  She turned her wings and flew back to her tree.  She remained\nperched and waited. She wasn&#39;t going to leave things to chance. If\nthese two bots made it to her pod, then she knew things might be\nalright. But for now, the beacon was still going and it could attract\nfriend and foe alike.  She would not give her position untill she knew\nit was safe. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
