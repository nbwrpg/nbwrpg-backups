But today felt strange, as if he had a\n&gt; feeling that he needed to stay on his patrol just a bit longer.  It was\n&gt; intuition playing a strong roll and he begins scanning deeper, sensing\n&gt; something is not quite right.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmm?  Why do I have the feel&#39;n something&#39;s out here that doesn&#39;t belong?\n&gt; I better cover all my bases this time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So onward the black cat skulks, perhaps coming across something or someone\n&gt; who has no business being around the property.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nHave you ever had the feeling that you&#39;re being watched . .  .??\n\nLike someone or something was watching, waiting . . . out in the shadows . . .\n\nThe area around the ark itself was covered in broken stone and rock.\nIt looked like it had been in several battles and the resulting damage\nhad broken down much of the surrounding stone, crushing a lot of it to\nsand and various kinds of dirt.\n\nShrubbery and fauna was only now beginning to reclaim its hold on the\narea as small bushes and scattered wild grasses were beginning to\nsprout up in different places.\n\nAt the moment there was nothing yet to find, but there did seem to be\nSOMETHING amiss. And to add to it, night was starting to fall.\n\nUnder to cover of darkness many things could happen.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Going along then, stealthily along the area, BLACKARACHNIA ponders.  She\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to risk a firefight yet with the MAXIMALS, but she has to\n&gt; bypass thier patrols..  So how to best go about that?\n&gt;\n&gt; She settles back to watch, waiting for the pair to be &#39;relieved&#39;, figuring\n&gt; that at the moment the two are watching the next group coming out on guard\n&gt; duty, she can sneak past both distracted groups, and head on in to her\n&gt; prize..\n&gt;\n&gt; The ARK.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs NIGHTSHIFT does not appear to be taking any pains to hide himself\nBLACKARACHNIA can plainly see the MAXIMAL as he stalks along obviously\nlooking for something.\n\nWhile he has yet to find her, he also happens to be between her and\nthe ARK. She would have to find a way around.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
