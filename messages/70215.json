He quickly looked around doing a quick check of the room.\n&quot;Great.&quot; he said as he noted that there was no other exit but the one\nabove them.\n\nMeanwhile above things were seemingly going well for the Decepticons\nand Predacons who appeared to be further away from the hole, that is\nuntil Cyclonus and Deepstryke noticed something.\n\n&quot;Sir?&quot; Cyclonus said to Hydras as he looked at the hole in front of\nthem and then at the black Autobot tank that had just burst through\nthe door, &quot;Um, perhaps we should not still be standing here the rest\nof the floor is not stable . . .\n\nDeepstryke, rather than firing at those in the hole began firing at\nthe tank, however his shots could not penetrate the shielding,\nalthough he could clearly see the shield beginning to weaken under\ntheir sustained fire. Phobia followed suit.\n\nRodimus from below watched as Tuscon and Nightshift attempted to use\nsome sort of ninjabot training. He shook his head, wishing he had paid\nmore attention to those classes. However he did remember one thing as\nhe looked upwards, &#39;always be prepared.&#39;\n\nRodimus&#39; hand retracted and in its place was a grappling hook which he\nfired upwards, and with a click it latched onto something above. As\nfast as he could he began to climb out of the hole, while still\ndodging the firepower that was coming from above!\n\nRodimus swung around as he felt a blast of heat as several shots came\nclose to hitting him, one causing him to spin as his shoulder was\nclipped! &quot;We are clay pigeons down here!&quot; Rodimus grunted as he\ncontinued to climb.\n\nLegacy oriented his main cannon at the Predacons and Decepticons, his\nintention was not to hit them, but to destroy the floor beneath their\nfeet, and send them tumbling down into the hole as well! The front of\nthe tank glowed as energy was built up, and then a beam of light and\ndestructive energy was fired from the great cannon muzzle vaporizing\nthe floor!\n\nLegacy&#39;s voice intoned over the radio, &quot;Then I would suggest vacating\nthis location as soon as possible.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
