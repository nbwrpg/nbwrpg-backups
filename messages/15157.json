Phobia thought he could lead better \nthan Terrasaur but hadn&#39;t functioned for so long by taking the \nleadership responsibilities. His place was at the leaders side, and \nwhen that leader had worn out it&#39;s usefullness the spider would \nweasle his way into the next ones side.\n\n&quot;A fine choice he told KitKat.&quot; And since Terrasaur had decided to \ntravel with Terantulis then the others should follow, at least until \nKitKat recovered.\n\nPhobia turned to Terantulis, he knew the other spiders reputation all \nto well they were to alike not to. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet a bot \nwith such a wonderful beast mode.&quot; he said. Those were the only \nappropriate words he could think of. Phobia could think of alot of \nother things he&#39;d like to say but none seemed appropriate at this \ntime.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She lifted her head. &quot;Terrorsaur will lead.

His attempt at \n&gt; being a\n&gt; &gt; hero blew up in his face and it cost KitKat some serious damage\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Phobia turned and saw the injured Starscream. &quot;I&#39;m alright but we \n&gt; must get\n&gt; &gt; to a secure area.&quot; He watched as Starscream collapsed again. \nMaybe \n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; good could come of this situation after all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Theres only one fair way to do this and since the Predacons \nrairly \n&gt; settle\n&gt; &gt; for diplomacy I say we have KitKat name her successor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; There was a time for diplomacy in the Predacon ranks and that was\n&gt; to \n&gt; size up\n&gt; &gt; your opponent until they turned thier back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Phobia knew the rules all to well. Starscream could be more \nheavily \n&gt; damaged\n&gt; &gt; than they realized that would make him to much a liability, Dollen\n&gt; &gt; Goldeneye, and Drillbit were to close to this emotionally to \nallow \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; decisions that could lead to sacrificeing one of the teamates, \nAtma \n&gt; seemed\n&gt; &gt; to have some personal grudge against Drillbit making him \n&gt; unacceptable as the\n&gt; &gt; leader.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;But if I must vote I think Terrosaur will suffice until either \n&gt; KitKat is\n&gt; &gt; back on her feat or until we find someone more appropriate.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
