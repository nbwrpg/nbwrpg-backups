Slowly, he forces his hands to release the grip on the chair, \nundoing the seatbelt and getting shakily to his feet. Slowly, forcing himself \nto take steps, he walks over to the fire extinguisher type device, grabbing \nit off the wall and going to work on the flames, trying not to think of the \nfact that they were a very long distance up, with the back of the shuttle on \nfire.\n\n"}}
