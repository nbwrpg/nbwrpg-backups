Switchblade just\n&gt; finished making the \n&gt; auto \n&gt; &gt; guns and other base defenses. Otherwise it&#39;s a\n&gt; sitting duck. The \n&gt; &gt; armour however is heavy, and can take quite a bit\n&gt; of punishment \n&gt; &gt; before hurtin too much. =p (read the ooC at the\n&gt; end as well)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- Megatron --\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron grumbles as the Predacon base is splayed\n&gt; with weaponfire \n&gt; &gt; from two sides. &quot;Note to self, repair sensors, and\n&gt; set up base \n&gt; &gt; defenses.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He starts into a brisk walk as he heads to the\n&gt; base exit. He opens \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; commlink to Switchblade, &quot;Switchblade, look around\n&gt; in the storage \n&gt; &gt; bay, there might be something we can use down\n&gt; there. We&#39;re in a bit \n&gt; &gt; of a pinch right now.&quot; He reaches the exit, and\n&gt; stops short.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron frowns as he opens a basewide commlink,\n&gt; &quot;Preceptor, \n&gt; &gt; Waspinator, Inferno if you&#39;re active, Quickstrike,\n&gt; Warhead, and all \n&gt; &gt; other Preds prepare for battle, this could get\n&gt; messy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The outer sensors pick up Tyreal&#39;s ultimatum.\n&gt; &quot;Hah!&quot; Megatron \n&gt; laughs \n&gt; &gt; sarcasticly, &quot;Turn myself in... of course I&#39;m not\n&gt; going to agree to \n&gt; &gt; that slag...&quot; He switches to external speakers, &quot;I\n&gt; don&#39;t care who \n&gt; &gt; you are. Who would agree to such terms...\n&gt; Bewarned, if you stay \n&gt; here \n&gt; &gt; and bother me, your lives are forfeit. You get one\n&gt; warning before \n&gt; &gt; death, so I hope you choose wisely.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He closes the external comm, and opens another\n&gt; comm to \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade. &quot;Switchblade, found anything yet?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade grumbles when he gets Megatron&#39;s first\n&gt; comm, &quot;Ya ya, \n&gt; i&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; looking.&quot; He fiddles around with the nearest\n&gt; sealed container, \n&gt; &gt; hacking the passlock, and disableing the\n&gt; protections. Inside he \n&gt; &gt; finds a bunch of energon pulse weapons, a newer\n&gt; Tripred design, \n&gt; &gt; although he&#39;s unsure how effective they are. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He moves onto the next sealed crate, and is about\n&gt; to open it when \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; gets Megatron&#39;s second message. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m\n&gt; looking, so lemme \n&gt; &gt; alone for a bit. You&#39;ll know if i find anything.&quot;\n&gt; He starts working \n&gt; &gt; on another sealed crate, wondering why his hacking\n&gt; process is \n&gt; taking \n&gt; &gt; a little longer than before...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ooC: One more thing, the Preds are few right now,\n&gt; so without \n&gt; &gt; intervention, they may get a sever ass kicking. =p\n&gt; I&#39;d like to \n&gt; &gt; propose starting a base storyline which starts\n&gt; with the artifacts \n&gt; &gt; which are located in the Predacon storage bay\n&gt; right now. The ones \n&gt; &gt; which none of the bots know about, or what they\n&gt; are. Something that \n&gt; &gt; would involve triggering an effect of the\n&gt; artifact, which would \n&gt; &gt; cause the Predacons to win the battle, but maybe\n&gt; the artifact could \n&gt; &gt; switch hands, and then a sort of power struggle\n&gt; would ensue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
