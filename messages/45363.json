I don&#39;t even like racing\ngames, but for some reason that&#39;s what my parents got\nme (F-Zero).  Still the graphics and sound alone were\nenough to keep me enticed (none of those crummy little\nspeakers). Gamecube is just to keep Nintendo fans from\nrioting.  This thing is as good as my old SNES.  By\nthe way do you realize I made this before Zardus\nbanned me for 2 months?\n\n--- nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; We would like to remind you of this upcoming event.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Birthday \n&gt; \n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 16, 2001 \n&gt; Time: All Day\n&gt; \n&gt; OH OH!
