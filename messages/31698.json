He had conked out after flopping onto the bed, easily relaxing and falling into a peaceful slumber. Shesta, on the other claw, was still amusing herself sniffing around the place, checking out corners and cracks. Typical dog.  Sitting up he stretched and yawned, reaching for his cape where he thought it to be and finding only empty air. End of the bed! With a yell he realized that he had leaned out too far, falling off and striking his shoulder upon the ground.  Vlad rolled onto his back and looked up at the ceiling. Today was turning out to be rotten. Getting to he feet he quickly located the cape and swung it around his shoulders, clasping it into place before heading towards the door, Shesta barking and following.\r\nVlad exited into the hall and scanned the area, finding that half the robots that were there before were missing, though, when scanning further he discovered that those mission were located on the land around the Cybertronien Fire.  Most of the Alliance was there, and he thought that he might as well join them just to see what was happening and perhaps join in on the gathering. However, there was a problem: how was he going to get off of the island in order to get there? Swimming was out of the question, he wasn�t that desperate to get there.  Vlad pondered the thought and turned it over in his mind, finally deciding to locate and contact Fenox to see if she could locate him some sort of hover craft. Being the only person he actually had associated with on this island, she would be the first choice.\r\nGoing from a walk to a trot he passed by halls, moving towards the holo decks, remembering to have heard the wolf and Fenox agree to go there. So, indeed that would be the first place where he would look.  It wasn�t long before a row of doors were visible to Vlad, slowing to a walk and stopping to knock on each.* � Hello?� * He did this to each door, listening after to hear if there was any response.*\r\n\r\n( Carnage: If Fenox and D have left the holo rooms I am not aware, so may you please correct me if they have?)\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
