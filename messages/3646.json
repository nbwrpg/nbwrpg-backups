She had the worst timing. That, or time or luck was never on her side. Nothing ever was. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;If you must,&quot; she said to Dinobot. &quot;But when this is---&quot; She thought to herself. She was in a control base, with CR chamber, along with hospitable bot that cared somewhat. It had been a long time since she had been in a fair battle, fighting side by side with someone. But she rarely cared about fighting side by side with someone; it more more like &lt;EM&gt;fighting &lt;/EM&gt;someone that she liked. \n&lt;P&gt;The Predacons were attacking the Maximal base, and that meant if she was quick enough, or them dumb enough, she could nab one and get some information from them. Perhaps she didn&#39;t need Dinobot after all. \n&lt;P&gt;She shot ahead, flying past Dinobot, going down the corridor, following the sounds of battle. She reached an area where the open ramp was---or where it should be. She soared upwards, trilling loudly so the fools of Megatron could hear her. She withdrew her fighting staff from her back and hovered, getting a surveillance of the choas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
