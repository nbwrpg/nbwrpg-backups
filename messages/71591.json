His health was failing\n&gt; him and he passed on his draconic properties to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot transforms into robot mode and remains on Talon&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hey if we&#39;re gonna map out a field grid from up here and down there, we\n&gt; need ta send a group of recon specialists ASAP .  I can go with Waspinator,\n&gt; since we happen to be smaller bots, which appears less of a threat to\n&gt; anyone, while other groups of smaller bots fans out on the ground.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Good.&quot; CYCLONUS said. &quot;Scourge, go with them. You may not be as samm\nas they, but your sensors are better.&quot;\n\nThere was a grumble from SCOURGE but nothing intelligable as he and\ntwo of his sweeps went down towards the remains oif the burning\ndinosaurs,\n\nWASPINATOR buzzed around to one side, &quot;Me Waspinator always get the hard jobs.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Good point.  Leo Prime, it&#39;s me, Tucson.  It has come to my attention that\n&gt; an alliance with the enemy is imperative.  For now we work together until we\n&gt; have dealt with the threat.  Please meet us at our current location on the\n&gt; ground.  I will fill you in when you arrive.  Tell the others what is\n&gt; happening so they are aware of the situation.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll do Tuscon.&quot; There was a moment of hesitation in his voice as if\nhe were about to say something else but then thought better of it. &quot;Be\ncareful.&quot; he said as he closed the connection.\n\nRODIMUS, still being on TUSCON&#39;s back looked around. &quot;We can see a lot\nfrom up here too. What about searching where the Dinosaurs came from.\nPerhaps that can help.&quot; RODIMUS pointed to the long path of\ndevastation that the dinosaurs had created as they traveled.\n\nThere was a pause from CYCLONUS, &quot;Yes, we had just been considering\njust such a course when you showed up.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who ever this Saberback is, where did he get these Dinosaurs, and\ndoes he have more?&quot; That comment from DEEPSTRYKE, ever the pragmatic\ntactical unit.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Said SKYSHADOW as he drifted back over into the conversation.\nHis green form looking like a cross between an iguana and a dragon fly\n- his wings buzzed eeriely as they held him in the air. &quot;Another\nquestion does he have any further plans?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
