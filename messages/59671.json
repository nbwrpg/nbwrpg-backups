Perhaps you will have better luck with \nthis. I&#39;m no parent bot.&quot;  And tried to hand off the kid to Malice.\n\nCamoflage:\nShe felt her body shift, water in her optics, she didn&#39;t see.

One was critically injured.\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll get you to the CR chamber immediatly!  Wolfblade, grab the \n&gt; other and follow me!&quot;\n&gt; Malice gathered up the striken bot and stompe through the halls \ninto \n&gt; the CR room.  He opened an empty chamber and put the miserable bot \n&gt; inside.  He close the chamber, and turned to see if Wolfblade was \n&gt; with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She transformed into wolf mode and ran down the hall, passing \n&gt; &gt; him, &quot;Slow poke.&quot;  She transformed back to bot mode and looked \n&gt; around \n&gt; &gt; for the door open button. &quot;Where in the pit is the door button in \n&gt; &gt; this place?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
