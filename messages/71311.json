Can be one of the reinforcements and such sent in.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WHEELIE\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Faction: Autobot/Maximal\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; QUOTE:  Look there, over there!  Friends find, look behind!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PROFILE:  An Autobot by the name of Wheelie grew up on a crashed ship,\n&gt;&gt; surviving for an unkonwn period of time on Quintessa.  Found by Autobots\n&gt;&gt; during the first Unicron crisis, he soon joined them and was a stalwart\n&gt;&gt; part\n&gt;&gt; of their forces going alon gwith the first Maximal Imperium after the war.\n&gt;&gt; A loner often forming strong bonds adn freindships and with a unique sort\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; personality from his time spent in isolation and having to fight to\n&gt;&gt; survive,\n&gt;&gt; Wheelie is often accompanied by his scrounger friend Gnaw, operating with\n&gt;&gt; local groups that cna tolerate his infmay as he moves on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ABILITIES:  A permanent glitch in his vocal processor developed by his\n&gt;&gt; long\n&gt;&gt; period in isolation upon Quintessa, Wheelie&#39;s vocalizer tends to vocalize\n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; ways in whatever linguistic dialect that are often translated as &#39;rhymes&#39;.\n&gt;&gt; These tend to be high pitched, grating, and annoying, and prolonged\n&gt;&gt; exposure\n&gt;&gt; is held to be extremely damaging to one&#39;s circuits, much like Cosmic Rust\n&gt;&gt; and Fire Suppressant Foam.  As such, the sight (or sound) of Wheelie on\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; battlefield is often enough to drive many Predacons or Decepticons to flee\n&gt;&gt; and abandon the area.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wheelie is armed with a small energon slingshot with a close range high\n&gt;&gt; capacity load that is capable of inflicting significant damage on larger\n&gt;&gt; Cybertronians.  His small alt mode of a Cybertronian racer has a top speed\n&gt;&gt; of 180 kilometers per hour and a range of over three thousand kilometers.\n&gt;&gt; Wheelie himself is heavily energon efficient, even by Maximal standard,\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; his bodyframe is capable of extended independent functioning without\n&gt;&gt; refueling or repairs (which is the way many Maximals would profess to like\n&gt;&gt; it), and is quite simplistic to maintain that even Wheelie can keep\n&gt;&gt; himself\n&gt;&gt; basically functional without medical supervision.  His small bodyframe is\n&gt;&gt; also quite agile and difficult to hit, combined with his long vorns spent\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; surviving have made him quite surprisingly adept at escape and evasion,\n&gt;&gt; guerilla operations, and reconaissance in urban or organic areas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Weaknesses:  Wheelie has much of a reputation, deserved or not, among\n&gt;&gt; Autobots and Decepticons.  While he can count some as staunch friends, his\n&gt;&gt; ability to seemingly inflict insanity to those in constant presence of his\n&gt;&gt; chattering has made many Autobots and Maximals wish to avoid prolonged\n&gt;&gt; interactions with him, and can lead to his constant solo operations in the\n&gt;&gt; field without backup.  This has also lead to a constant but\n&gt;&gt; unsubstantiated\n&gt;&gt; threats of violence to be inflicted upon him by his own faction, depending\n&gt;&gt; on how casual the company is.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Wheelie&#39;s form, while agile, is very small and very vulnerable, and lacks\n&gt;&gt; power.  He is weak physically, and his primary weapon (an energon\n&gt;&gt; slingshot)\n&gt;&gt; has a very limited range, and even low powered energy weapons can inflict\n&gt;&gt; significant damage upon him.  In a hand to hand fight he is seriously\n&gt;&gt; vulnerable to damage and can take few hits.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; History:  Wheelie spent unknown thousands of vorns as the only survivor of\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; crashed ship upon Quintessa, where upon his rescue he became a stalwart\n&gt;&gt; part\n&gt;&gt; of the AUtobot forces, most often operating on long range reconaissance\n&gt;&gt; missions or as backup to his friends.  After the Autobot/Decepticon War\n&gt;&gt; ended, and many of his friends went into retirement, Wheelie was not\n&gt;&gt; upgraded along with teh initial wave of Maximal upgrading, preferring to\n&gt;&gt; keep his original body as a memory to those whom had been lost in the war.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pending the end of the war, Wheelie&#39;s whereabouts became much fo a\n&gt;&gt; mystery,\n&gt;&gt; with various stories at any point theorizing he had been killed in a back\n&gt;&gt; alley by Autobot/Decepticons (most often accompanied by &#39;I&#39;LL DRINK TO\n&gt;&gt; THAT!&#39; in Maccadam&#39;s) to that he was working with th Maximal Security\n&gt;&gt; Administration.  One theroy even stated that he had been part of the\n&gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt;&gt; Experimentation Program that had produced Protoform X, simply stating that\n&gt;&gt; he was what had driven the unit that would eventually call itself Rampage\n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; total sociopathy and nihilism simply from being locked in a cell for the\n&gt;&gt; experiments!  Many would explain their decline to believe in Primus by\n&gt;&gt; saying &#39;He made that guy, didn&#39;t he?&#39; and gesture to the MiniBot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (Un)fortunately, Wheelie has been still functioning over the era, living\n&gt;&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; Cybertron, often going on trips to search the galaxy and find more\n&gt;&gt; information.  While there, he would spend much of his time in Little Iacon\n&gt;&gt; remiscing of the old days.  Upon attemptimg to join a craft, according to\n&gt;&gt; scuttleaft a Maximal hit upon the idea of sending him along with Leo&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; reinforcement crew to Earth.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Further scuttleaft was hoping that by sending him several tens of\n&gt;&gt; thousands\n&gt;&gt; of vorns back in time and to active military conflict would &#39;get the\n&gt;&gt; little\n&gt;&gt; cans to be recycled&#39;, but were never actively confirmed as transfer orders\n&gt;&gt; were sent.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
