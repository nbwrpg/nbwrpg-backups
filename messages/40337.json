He received Rainchark&#39;s \ntransmission and opened a comm. link with him.  &quot;We are still in a position \nto cause damage to the enemy.  The Decepticons shall withdraw soon when the \nbattle becomes strategically unsound.&quot; the Emperor intoned.\n\nUnitron&#39;s scanners read a great deal of weapons fire coming towards him so he \ntransformed to his biped mode, leaping into the air, the boosters in his feet \nrocketing into the air, the laser blasts and the ice beams missing, as well \nas the missiles, but the resulting explosions sent him flying high, and \ncrashing down into the ground.\n\nFirestarter transformed into his biped mode, smaller now then he was in his \nspace fighter mode.  Using the boosters in his feet he was able to continue \nflying, dodging the shots that had been shot at him.\n\nHe raised his flame cannon, firing off three fireballs at Cledar.\n\nThe only space fighter of the NDE in the air, Sixshot, avoided both missiles \nand the pot shots easily, mocking them in his mind.  He fired off twenty-five \nlaser bolts from his nosecone, five at Rixer, five at Blyer, and fifteen at \nFirearm.\n\n"}}
