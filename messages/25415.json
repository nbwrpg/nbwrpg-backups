It had been dl&#39;d into Drill Bit&#39;s mind by War. It was a secret \ncomm hidden in the bots brain. It turned on. &quot;Drill Bit.... this message \ncomes with sorrow. If you are hearing this I am dead and so is the council \nbase. But hope still lives. The base destructor came in is still here! he \nonly hid it from his enemies with a flashy light show and a fancy cloak \ndevice. Unfortunatly it&#39;s defences can only be put on-line by his hand. But I \nhave a solution to that. I dl&#39;d something in the computers after his death. \nHere are the coordinates of the base. Grid 7-5 alpha. All you have to do is \ncopy destructor&#39;s voice wich I have dl&#39;d into this comm. You will find it \nhelpful it will decloak the base and open the main door. Go to the main \ncomputer counsol and hit the green button. That will solve the defence \nproblem. I wish you good luck. And long live the predacon empire!&quot;\n\n"}}
