And I got a story ta tell that might answer\n&gt; it for ya.  One time, Master Yokitron was holding some basic training in\n&gt; Ninjabot combat, and Rodimus, who is already an established hot shot\n&gt; warrior, was attending one of those training exercises.  At the same time,\n&gt; so was Tucson, who actually continued his Ninjabot training, shortly after\n&gt; the brief session he attended.  Okay, gett&#39;n back ta the story, Rodimus\n&gt; didn&#39;t pay too much attention ta Master Yokitron and never went on with the\n&gt; training.  He was kinda not with it and liked his warrior style of fighting\n&gt; a lot better. Well, Master Yokitron wanted ta see just how important his\n&gt; training was and asked him ta spar with me.  I said okay and I did as\n&gt; Yokitron asked.  Wouldn&#39;t ya know, I had Rodimus knocked off his feet in the\n&gt; first ten minutes of the first session?  He&#39;s an awesome fighter as a knight\n&gt; but it didn&#39;t serve him too well going up against a Ninja.  Warriors are\n&gt; smart, strong and steadfast.  A Ninja is smart, swift, strong, and\n&gt; dexterous.  A perfect balance of skill and agility.&quot;  I hope that clears\n&gt; things up for ya.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWOLFGANG gave NIGHTSHIFT his full attention while the story was told,\nleaning back in his chair as the story spun to an end.\n\n&quot;Hot Shot, an established warrior by that time?&quot; That comment coming\nnot from WOLFGANG but from PROWL. &quot;No, that was not the case. Hot Shot\nmay have fancied himself to be one but he had not the training or\nexpireince to be called that.&quot;\n\nThere was an eager nod from WOLFGANG, &quot;A sword is no better than a\nmace on the field of battle.&quot; WOLFGANG said comparing a knight to a\nninja with weaoons they may carry. &quot;Only the skill behind them and the\nstrength that wields them determines the outcome.&quot;\n\nWOLFGANG gestured at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;You have been trained to be a ninja,\nand your training has afforded you certain skills and you have focused\non your craft and you may have succeeded.&quot; He shrugged slightly as he\nsaid the last.\n\n&quot;But a punch is still a punch and a sword thrust is still a thrust and\nthey can all be fatal if done right. The ninja and the knight are only\nas good as their training and to assume that either one is as good or\nbetter on the battlefield just because one has had a different\ntraining or title then the other is . . . &quot; He smiled again as he\ngestured lazilly in the air, &quot;Now that would be the hight of\nfoolishness.&quot;\n\nAs WOLFGANG came to an end the ship touched down, the cabin jostled\nonly slightly. Judging from the silence of the others this was a\nconversation they have all had with WOLFGANG at one time or another.\n\n&quot;All right let&#39;s disembark!&quot; POLAR CLAW said as the shuttle door began\nto open and a ramp extend down. &quot;Keep your optics on full and your\nweapons at the ready!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
