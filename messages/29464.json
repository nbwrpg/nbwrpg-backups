HAHAHA! \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m kinda in an euphoric mood right now, my hockey team just won \n&gt; league champions, after eight overtimes of play. Overtimes were \n&gt; 4-on-4 for 5 mins, then 3-on-3 for 1 min, then 2-on-2 for one min, \n&gt; then 1-on-1 for one min then it repeated. In the eight overtime, \n&gt; 1-on-1, our captain (GREAT guy) made the other team&#39;s player and \n&gt; goalie look foolish to score with about 10 seconds left on the \nclock.\n&gt; GOAL! THE CROWD GOES WILD!\n&gt; \n&gt; Damn referee... gave me 2 mins for submarining a guy with my \n&gt; knee (submarine in hockey = making the other player do a flip, and \n&gt; taking out his legs.) and he was trying to hit me!
