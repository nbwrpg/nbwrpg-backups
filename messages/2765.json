Whatever was between the jaws of his cobra hand, he slammed it into\nthe\n&gt; floor and pinned it there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike was in the process of panicing.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Failed tests, classes skipped, forgotten locker combinations.\n&gt; Remember the good &#39;ol days\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4053/10/_/_/_/960160982/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
