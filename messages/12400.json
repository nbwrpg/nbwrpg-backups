Here&#39;s a \nhint of advice: Don&#39;t open file attachments! You can open them if the \nperson told you they were sending you something before-hand. exe. are \nespecially the ones that hold viruses. You should have your anti-\nvirus system updated. You could go to the norton anti-virus website \nor the microsoft website, or what ever anti-virus system you use.)\n\n\nRattrap:\n\n\n\nRattrap holed himself in a homemade den. Several days passed without \nincident with other bots, thank Primus. No sightings meant that they \nweren&#39;t going to report that Rattrap was around, so they wouldn&#39;t \ntake that to Hell Beast. \n\nRunning was his only option. It wasn&#39;t his best idea, but it got him \naway from the torcher chamber. He sniffed around the exit-way of his \nlittle den, shaking his whiskers, testing the air, making sure no one \nwas around, then he pulled his body out of it. He looked around. All \nclear, just like everyday.\n\nHe went deeper inside of the forest where he found more edible \nberries. Those things were the only thing keeping his stomach from \naching from hunger. He stood up and leaned on the branched, pulling \nthe red berries off with his front teeth.\n\n\n"}}
