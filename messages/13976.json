I am looking for Magmatron, my &quot;Nookie&quot; \nkey to the Destrons. I spent hours tracking across the world, eating \ncheezits, smelling my armpits, inspecting robots for &quot;sensetive areas&quot; and \nhaving a jolly bally time. There are new planets evolving. One is called \n&quot;Powerpuff Squirel, my very own destron bang central. Well, The journey \nwas....cheesy. I am here as I enter destron base, only to find cheezits, \nshredder, and that magmatron has left. So I speak flirtingly to shredder. \n&quot;your heating up my metal parts, honeytron&quot; I say.\n\n"}}
