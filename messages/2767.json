Then she see&#39;s the blasts heading towards\nQuickstrike, Alot of stuff was going through her mind when she jumped in\nfront of Quickstrike and took the two missiles. She then her side in more\npain from where the missiles hit her. she still stood but stumbling some,\nshe then started rapidly shooting eye lasers at Injector, Double Punch and\nManterror* (And don&#39;t say I&#39;m moding because other bots are allowed to take\nthe shots to save other bots) Mantella: DRAZOM!

He had attacked me earlier, him\n&gt; winning the fight.  Upon Suukie&#39;s arrival, Suukie ignored the pleads,\ngripped\n&gt; Stinkbomb by the throat, then threw him back to the ground.  Stinkbomb\nthen\n&gt; opened fire, obviously confused, unfortunately so did Stuukie, and they\nboth\n&gt; fell.  I then left to the CR chambers, crawling.  When I got out and got\nsome\n&gt; weapons from the armory just in case, I came to find Suukie opening fire\non\n&gt; an unconscious Stinkbomb.  Afraid for my friend&#39;s life, I opened fire on\n&gt; Suukie, who had somehow been repaired from powerful laser blasts to the\nhead,\n&gt; then that weirdo,&quot; he said, referring to Plintissa, &quot;came in and &quot;rescued&quot;\n&gt; him.  Helping him escape justice.  Justice not being killing him, I was\n&gt; trying to knock him down so I could try and restrain him.  And I&#39;m sorry\nif I\n&gt; got confused, but  when arriving here, there weapons drawn, and facing\nyou,\n&gt; and that other person, I jumped to the conclusion you two were under\nattack,\n&gt; ma&#39;am.&quot; he said, pointing to Zenyak (not knowing he was a Predacon), still\na\n&gt; little amazed at the ginormous beast mode.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/960161534/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
