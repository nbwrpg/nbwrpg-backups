He bends down to pick up his \nfallen arm, smasing it into the stump on his wrist. Wires and plates bend as \nhe jams it in, the hand non-functional but at least now there.\n\nHe turns around, looking down at the group of Maximals.\n\n&quot;You still want that one on one, Maximal?!&quot; the giant bot yells, stepping \nforward and firing his optics at Firearm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm ducks under a shot, looking up at the towering gestalt. He growls.\n\n&quot;Perhaps I do!&quot; he says in return, jumping up, his jetpack sending him flying \nup to Oblitertron&#39;s level, firing charges at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl looks up in surprize as Firearm flies off, the feathered Maximal \ngrowling. He looks over at the woods as Proto emerges, his chest melted and \nthe rest of him full of dents from hitting the ground.\n\nLooking at Koj, Prowl nods.\n\n&quot;Yeah. Dinobot will need help getting out of here,&quot; he says, knowing that \nDinobot would probably object, but there was no time for childish pride. He \nlooks at the rest of the Maximals, &quot;All of you get back to base. Me and \nFirearm will catch up later on.&quot;\n\nWith that, Prowl launches himself into the air, flying up to help Firearm. \nProto reaches the group, limping.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; he says, looking around, &quot;Who here can fly?&quot;\n\n"}}
