There&#39;s some big ga=\r\nps in his prints which indicates a bit of acrobatics were at play here.&quot;\n\nR=\r\nattrap studies the tracks further.\n\n&quot; Yep he was off the ground a few times=\r\n, I can tell.  But fancy flight work didn&#39;t help the big guy all that much.=\r\n&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nods.\n\n&quot; No, it didn&#39;t .  But let&#39;s hope he&#39;s still in one=\r\n piece.&quot;\n\nDon&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things y=\r\nou already posses.

Look at the ground, debris is kicked\n&gt;&gt; up all over the pl=\r\nace, Rattrap found one of Tucson Prime&#39;s scales, mangled,\n&gt;&gt; and there&#39;s a =\r\nbit of battery fluid on the ground.

Tucson used to work\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nwith him vorns ago, and they seemed to work well together.
