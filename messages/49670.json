It \n&gt; could have been put a little more politely perhaps. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t feel I was pointing in the wrong direction\n&gt; (not sure what I \n&gt; was pointing at either), and nor do I expect you to\n&gt; get the RPG \n&gt; right away. I also didn&#39;t automatically know\n&gt; everything about your \n&gt; weapon. I understand the function of the weapon\n&gt; based upon what you \n&gt; wrote earlier. My post was more refering to what was\n&gt; said in the \n&gt; upper paragraph of this post. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wasn&#39;t intending to say that your weapon wasn&#39;t\n&gt; appropriate for \n&gt; the rpg. I did speak my mind saying that perhaps a\n&gt; reduced number of \n&gt; shots was preferable after reading your suggestion\n&gt; that you would \n&gt; fire it at a rate of 2 shells per post. The whole\n&gt; misunderstanding \n&gt; started by me forgetting to bring up rule changes to\n&gt; the rest of the \n&gt; council to be reviewed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I fully understood the attitude/new guy\n&gt; comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; How would you prepare yourself for new people who\n&gt; come in with lots \n&gt; of new ideas? If our system is lacking, I want to\n&gt; use your knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are 3 moderators because we&#39;re human, and are\n&gt; quite capable of \n&gt; mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; aerosmith: \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that I said &#39;don&#39;t post while I am\n&gt; gone&#39; (though my \n&gt; mistake if it seemed like it). I was suggesting that\n&gt; it would be \n&gt; more logicial and reasonable if when in battle,\n&gt; people regulated \n&gt; their posting frequency so that everyone fights the\n&gt; battle, not just \n&gt; a few people. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; off topic, now that Galvatron is present, is he\n&gt; going to be a loner? \n&gt; or is he going to join the Predacons?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle: \n&gt; Ya, it was more like 4-5 days at a minimum. \n&gt; Where exactly are you coming from? If a moderator\n&gt; didn&#39;t have power, \n&gt; would that person really be a moderator? I&#39;m wrong\n&gt; quite often, and \n&gt; I have openly admitted it. There are however,\n&gt; occasions when I don&#39;t \n&gt; believe that I&#39;m wrong, and therefore I won&#39;t admit\n&gt; to being wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; *sigh* the criticism that comes with being a\n&gt; moderator is \n&gt; unquestionably considerable. Too bad I&#39;m not\n&gt; perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whoah, way to point your finger in the wrong\n&gt; direction.  The only \n&gt; &gt; posts I made that had anything to do with the\n&gt; battle in the last \n&gt; &gt; couple of days were to clarify the weapon&#39;s\n&gt; function.  It&#39;s not \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; I kept shooting!  Jeez, just because you&#39;re a mod\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean you \n&gt; &gt; automatically know everything about a weapon\n&gt; someone else designed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not here to stand around and look pretty\n&gt; either.  If anyone \n&gt; needs \n&gt; &gt; an attitude change, it&#39;s the people who expect the\n&gt; new guy to not \n&gt; &gt; know shit about how RPGs work.  I&#39;ve had a ton of\n&gt; writing and \n&gt; &gt; roleplaying experience, thank you very much, and I\n&gt; know what I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; doing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You ought to be a little more prepared for those\n&gt; who show up with \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; slew of ideas ready beforehand.  I&#39;m not saying\n&gt; all my ideas \n&gt; should \n&gt; &gt; go through, I&#39;m saying I have them ready for when\n&gt; there&#39;s an \n&gt; opening.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
