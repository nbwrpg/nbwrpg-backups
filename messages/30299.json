She \nsaw the new controls and liked the upgrades.  She was in the matrix \nwith her computers around her.  She checked the scanners and \nfrequencies.  She tried to pick up on the maximal calls, but nothing \ncame it.  She sat back in the chair, put her feet up on the console, \nher hands behind her back and leaned back in the chair.  She was in \nutter delight. \n\n\n"}}
