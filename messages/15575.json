I&#39;ll rewrite my post. The part about Savage attacking Striker \nis still valid, same with the shots hitting Tamron, but the whole \nIguana thing, the chip being defelcting and Tamron&#39;s little speech I \nam re-writing. I think I might like this story-line, though. Striker \ncould go through hell trying to get Spears&#39; back, and Savage hates \nStriker so eventually they could have a climactic battle. Who wins? \nWe&#39;ll have to play it out.)\n\nTamron\n\nTamron watched as the micro-chip sinks into Spears. He lets out a \ngood laugh.\n\n&quot;Hahahahaha! Hold your fire, or your friend is done for. I have the \npower now to even force herself to self-destruct. Now, you, what is \nyour name?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
