I have been told that \nthe battle at the CF is over, and currently the CF is not under attack.)\n\n\nHysteria/Tavatron/Swyft(New Character)\n\nHysteria lay sprawled out on her stomach atop the CF. She painstakingly \nworked on trying to keep the shields from failing all together:\n\n&quot;Just a few more...&quot;\n\nHystera yelped as a small jolt of electricity ran through her body.\n\n*****\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron groaned softly, her hand instinctively clutching her injured side. \nThe armor had not only been melded to her circuitry, but ripped from her \nshoulder as well. The result was a mechfluid loss that left her lightheaded \nand feeling extremely tired. Tavatron slowly sank to one knee. She just \nneeded a few moments to regain her strength. Only a few...\n\nTav chuckled in the back of her host&#39;s mind. How pitiful she must look, \nkneeling in the midst of a battle. The hate and anger that echoed with each \ndemented thought would have chilled even Dinobot&#39;s cold spark if he had been \ncapable of sensing it. However, Tavatron was. She could only moan softly, \nthe mechfluid forming a growing puddle of silver liquid at her feet. \nTavatron sat back a bit, leaning against her free arm for support. There she \nsat in a puddle of fluid that had begun to slow in its growth, but still \ngrew.\n\n&quot;Shut up...&quot; Tavatron whispered weakly.\n\n*****\n\nFrom deep within space flew a stasis pod. It crashed through stray rocks and \npecies of metal as it flew past the previous site of the Ark battle and hit \nthe Earth&#39;s atmosphere at a fantastic speed. It&#39;s rate didn&#39;t slow, but in \nfact increased until it was nothing more than a burning blur in the sky. The \npod would have quickly overheated if it had not broken through the \natmosphere and foud it&#39;s way to a great body of water. It crashed and sank \nnearly to the bottom before its flotation device activated and it began to \nresurface.\n\nThe pod bobbed on the surface of the rippling water, the DNA scan active but \nfinding nothing suitable. Then a small creature cried out as it dove toward \nthe pod. THe blue bird quickly realized that the new addition to its habitat \nwas not eadible, and pulled up as it flew out of site. That was enough, \nhowever, to provide the &#39;bot within the pod a form.\n\nThe pod opened with a lou HISS as the bot within sat up and stretched. She \ntook a moment to realize where she was before turning to gaze at the large \nbase beside her.(The Iron Fist)She then turned her attention to her \nreflection in the  now still water:\n\n&quot;Now this, I can live with.&quot;\n\nSwyft smiled as she continued to admire herself in the glassy water.\n\n(See the characters page for Swyft&#39;s stats)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
