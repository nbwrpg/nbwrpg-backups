She tried to stand, holding onto \nhim with a firm grip. She was able to stand on her feet, but she was \nshaking.  She moved her left leg and took a step.  Her leg started to \ncollaps and she held herself up by clinging to Quickstrike.  She was \ngetting rather upset at all this.  She wanted to walk and by the \nMaxtrix, she was going to. She took another step. She looked up at \nQuickstrike and smiled. She looked down and took another step. She \nwas hanging on to him but at least she was starting to walk again.\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s a start.&quot; she chuckled, &quot;Mind if I just hang on here \nwhile you take me to my new room?&quot; she said with a slight smirk.  She \nhoped he would just let her hang on and slowly walk her to her room.\nShe was getting tired already from all this.  She would be exhausted \nby the time she got to her room at this rate.\n\n\n---Original Message-----\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t give me that slag!&quot; He grabbed Dark Mouse under her arms \nfirmly and \n&gt; lifted her up. &quot;Now get up, dang it! Ya ain&#39;t gonna give up! Ya \never see me \n&gt; give up b&#39;fore? Move yer dang legs!&quot; He kicked at her closest foot, \ntrying \n&gt; to move it. &quot;Move!&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
