It&#39;s the \nfact that\n&gt; your taking a name that&#39;s already taken. I have a Predacon that has \nthe name\n&gt; Venomous. I know it&#39;s not spelled the same but it says the same \nthing. The\n&gt; rules clearly read that you can&#39;t take a name tha has been taken. \nSo, please\n&gt; change that.

Fangs that inject venom. Venom will \nsend\n&gt; &gt; most average BW bot into stasis, but not kill.\n&gt; &gt; Alliegance: Predacon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She was made on Cybertron, by the Predacon Council.  She was \ndesigned\n&gt; &gt; to be a spy and assassin.  Her moto, SEEK,SEDUCE,DESTROY.  She had\n&gt; &gt; killed many Maximal officails on Cybertron and was working her way\n&gt; &gt; around to the top leaders.  She was the best in her field.  The\n&gt; &gt; Predacon Council had made other bots for the same purpose as she, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; she had out done them all.  But because of her skill, a few of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon leaders felt she might become a threat to them.  She knew\n&gt; &gt; too much and they now wanted rid of her.  She had just killed one \nof\n&gt; &gt; the Maximal Council leaders and was then turned in by one of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon Council members.  She had to flee Cybertron or be \nexacuted.\n&gt; &gt; But her programs of killing and information gathering were still\n&gt; &gt; strong and for the Predacon cause despire the fact they betrayed \nher.\n&gt; &gt; She stole a small transport ship and sped off from Cybertron.  She\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know if she would ever return, but for now, the further \naway\n&gt; &gt; she got, the safer she felt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She was deep into space, when a black hole opened up infront of \nher\n&gt; &gt; ship.  Seconds later, her ship was sucked into the vortex of \nspace.\n&gt; &gt; She tried to fight, but the ship couldn&#39;t break free.  She blacked\n&gt; &gt; out from the g-forces of the black hole as the ship was sucked in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her ship finally flew throught the hole in space and ended up near\n&gt; &gt; the solor system on Earth.  Her ship had lost power and engine \ndrive\n&gt; &gt; while in the black hole.  The only systems that remained active \nwere\n&gt; &gt; life support.  She was in stasis lock at the helm of the ship.  AS\n&gt; &gt; the ship drifted past the planets, it was hit by space debre and\n&gt; &gt; rubble.  Small meteors collided and smashed parts of the exterior\n&gt; &gt; drive system and parts of the navigational systems.  The ship\n&gt; &gt; evertually drifted near earth, where the gravitational pull had\n&gt; &gt; started to pull the ship into the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  The ship \nfell\n&gt; &gt; from the sky and landed  100 yards from the Allience base.  The\n&gt; &gt; transport ship was about the size of the NASA Space shuttle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Venomess was still out cold, her body slumped over the control\n&gt; &gt; console.  Her body bruised but for the most part, undamaged.  The\n&gt; &gt; ship had sustained a lot of damage and would never fly again. \nSmoke\n&gt; &gt; poured out of the tail and engine rooms.  The wings were torn off\n&gt; &gt; upon impact.  One wing flew off and hit against the Allience ship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
