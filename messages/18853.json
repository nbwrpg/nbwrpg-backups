His momentum still carried him straight at Slayer. He quickly\ntransformed to bot mode attempting to tackle the opposition. His strategy\nhad to purposes. If he could tackle Slayer he would have an advantage and be\nclose enough where Slayer would be hit by friendly fire if the other\ntrainers attemped to step in.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, October 21, 2000 12:11 PM\nSubject: Re: Destroying History\n\n\n&gt; ::Slayer/Ramulus/Proto/Smokescreen::\n&gt;\n&gt; Slayer nods as he recieves Prebon&#39;s orders, spinning around and firing a\nfew\n&gt; shots at Lunarpine as the bot jumps at him off of the tree.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus sees two missiles fly out of nowhere, followed by some chips.
