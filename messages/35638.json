No matter.  Apocalypse decided to leave \nwithout picking you up.  I don&#39;t know why.  And since your message was to him \nno one else answered it.  Here&#39;s the plan.  You tunnel under the shields of \nthe Trainer base.  Most of us go inside and blow the living hell out of them. \n A few will stay outside to bombard the shields while we attack from behind.  \nSimple plan really.  Now come along. We&#39;re regrouping at the Syria base.&quot;  He \nopens a com to Ramjet.  &quot;Ramjet.  We&#39;re staging at the Syria base.  Report \nthere ASAP.  Cygnar out.&quot;  He takes off for Syria.\n\n"}}
