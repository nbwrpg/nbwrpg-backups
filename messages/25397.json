At the base he lands and returns to his bot mode.  \nThere he sees \n&gt; Nightlight and Perplex fighting with two unknown bots and a third \nunknown bot \n&gt; helping them, sort of.  He looks between them and decides that \nPerplex is \n&gt; fine.  He turns and leaps at Clash drawing his staff and slashing \nat his \n&gt; back.\n\n\n"}}
