Cutie is on earth right now. The amoeba \nthingy definately won&#39;t work, so ditch it. To hopefully end \ndiscussion of this, Cutie is, by the IRON HAND of the council, now a \ntranslucent, transparent ghost on earth, awaiting a blank protoform \nto posses. He will start in mid Africa, and you can take if it from \nthere. How Cutie finds a protoform is up to you, but make sure that \nit is reasonable. (if you are unsure, ASK!)\n\nRead the following and comply:\n\nNO MORE OOC POSTS. I&#39;m going to ban the next person who makes a \nviolation. (note: there are exceptions)\n\nTry to refrain from posting more than 10 times a day, OMG is it \nfrustrating to read through each post, especially when several of \nthem are pushing our limits for moding.\n\nEVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO READ ROLEPLAING 101A and 101B IN THE \nnbwrpg.com messageboard. NO BUTS. I&#39;m tempted to create a quiz to \nmake sure everyone has read it. I&#39;m also tempted to create a quiz \nabout the rules, cause they are important, and I don&#39;t feel like \nreciting them to each person who decides that they don&#39;t need to \ncheck them.\n\nThere is also going to be another vote on restart vs sequel. We urge \npeople to really think about which would be BETTER FOR THE RPG. I \nthink you&#39;ll find that a restart is a better choice.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (OOC)\n&gt; \n&gt; /rant mode on\n&gt; \n&gt; To clear things up a bit before the kindegarden rejects get sent \nto the corner:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) a single celled anything would not have a pupose. To have \npurpose you have to be self aware which said organisms are not.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) No a single celled organism could not exist in space. While it \ndoesn&#39;t need to breath it still needs to absorb material to survive. \nSpace dust is not going to keep it alive...if the radiation in space \ndoesn&#39;t kill it instantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) If you&#39;re going to have a &quot;ghostly&quot; entity floating about at \nleast do some research on previous occurances. Starscream happens to \nbe the prime example of this type of character. His spark for \nwhatever reason did not join the matrix when his body got slagged on \nmultiple occassions. His spark roamed space &quot;possessing&quot; bots. This \nis the closest sensible thing I could compare this cutie crap to.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Last but certainly least can you guys ever just agree to \ndisagree and let the council settle an arguement instead of \nsquabbling like spoiled children? I know rauq and the others must be \nbusy but getting 50 odd emails, 90% of which is a bitch fest back \nand forth is annoying.\n\n\n"}}
