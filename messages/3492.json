She sees herself draw a sword and start to attack.  \nShe draws her own sword and starts fighting with herself.\n\n&quot;Why are you doing this.&quot; She asks her other.  The other replies,&quot;You have \ngone against your Predacon training.  Why did you go against the Predacons?&quot; \n  She responds,&quot;Because they kill without reason.  They kill just to kill.&quot;\nHer other hits her and yells,&quot; You once killed for the thrill of killing.  \nYou used to revel in the fact that you had the power over life and death.&quot;\n&quot;Well, I don&#39;t anymore.&quot; She responded.\nHer other stopped and stood next to her. &quot;You might once again feel as you \ndid.  Your a Predacon.  It&#39;s in your programming.  You will be a Predacon \nonce again.&quot;\n\n*DarkMouse yelled in her slumber*\n&quot;Noooo.  I will not give up.
