Stop this foolishness or your little girlly friend has a weapon accident!&quot; the minion says as she aims one of her disruptors mounted in her arm to the valkyrie&#39;s head.\n \nOOC: Malice is temporarily supercharged.  He has better speed, but endurance and dexterity have suffered.  He&#39;ll take more damage, but he also has all that energy to attack with.  He can use the cannon multiple times, so either evade him, or try and stop him from firing the cannon.  It will be a big bang.  Also, try and get Organics away from Hellplague.
