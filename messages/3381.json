Hitting the ground, he cried out in pain, rolling to take away some \n&gt;of\n&gt;the pain, facing down so it didn&#39;t continue to burn inwardly of him.\n&gt;\n&gt;----\n&gt;\n&gt;Counter Punch laughed as the Maximal (Triceradon) had fallen from his \n&gt;attack.\n&gt;  Beginning to turn, numerous shots sent him flying back 5 feet due to his\n&gt;unstable standing (from having one foot up, and one foot down while \n&gt;walking).\n&gt;\n&gt;----\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector had seen Counter Punch fall from Stegotron&#39;s attacks.  Raising his\n&gt;optics so Stegotron was in perfect view, he fired a single green optic \n&gt;blast\n&gt;at Stegotron&#39;s chest, simultaneously firing three stinger missiles from his\n&gt;hand-held launcher.\n&gt;\n&gt;----\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror was laughing, but stumbled back, falling on his butt when Striker\n&gt;opened fire.  &lt;Double Punch, get your skid plate over here!  To many \n&gt;Maximals\n&gt;are arriving&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;~Acknowledged~ Double Punch replied, getting out the bridge of the Pred \n&gt;ship\n&gt;and charging off towards Manterror&#39;s location, cloaking into his stealth \n&gt;mode.\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror saw Striker turn to open fire at Mosquitor.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; his\n&gt;cracking into a smile.  Raising his arms, he fired two ion disks at \n&gt;Striker&#39;s\n&gt;side.  Simultaneously firing a single ion disk at Dark Mouse&#39;s torso (the\n&gt;torso counts as the head, chest, and abdomen, abdomen is the region of the\n&gt;body that the stomach is in).\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
