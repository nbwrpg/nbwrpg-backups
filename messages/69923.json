He knew that keepi=\r\nng up with four tires on two legs was next to near impossible, unless of co=\r\nurse the robot chasing you had the same capabilities. Accidentally his tire=\r\ns kick up some dust as they spin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Whoops, sorry about that. Caught a s=\r\nlippery spot. Hmm, time ta change the tires I think.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He moves forward.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nAs the dirt and such are kicked up, several of Scorponok&#39;s\nauto-cannons=\r\n orient themselves on Nightshift&#39;s form, and although they\ndo not open fire=\r\n, their tips glow for a moment before once again going\ndark. It is obvious =\r\nthat it was only a last minute force of will that\nstopped him from opening =\r\nfire.\n\n&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure that it was.&quot; Scorponok said in highly sarcastic and\n=\r\nsuspicious tones. He was about to say something else when a message\ncame in=\r\n from Hydras . . .\n\n&gt; Hydras send a message to Skorponock telling him that =\r\nkeep and eye in the visitor and discretly interrogate him, and send a secre=\r\nt orders do Perceptor.\n\nScorponok sent a silent acknowledgement back to Hyd=\r\nras as he and\nNightshift were entering the throne room. The room was curren=\r\ntly empty\nas Hydras had not yet arrived.\n\nScorponok stopped and shifted for=\r\nm, assuming his massive robot mode.\nAs he was once a city-former Scorponok =\r\nstill  maintained tremendous\nsize relative to most. Although still human he=\r\night, he was near the\ntop end at nearly 8&#39; tall, towering over your more av=\r\nerage mechs.\nScorponok&#39;s armor was thick and powerful, and although it look=\r\ned\nsomewhat blocky he moved easily within it.
