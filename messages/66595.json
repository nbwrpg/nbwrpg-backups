I am interested in your history because I&#39;m kinda trying to put together a history page on the wiki as a sort of side-project.  I&#39;m a friend of THECODE or Hollywood Narrator as he was later called, though I haven&#39;t talked with him in about half a year.  I remember he used to be quite the arguer, he and Lurker_Abyss used to raise quite a ruckus at times.  (I haven&#39;t seen lurker online for at least 2 years).  Anyway, I&#39;m interested in getting as much history as you&#39;re willing to provide! ^_^ \n\nAgain, my apologies in the delay in getting your character active in the group.
