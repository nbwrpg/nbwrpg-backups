The robot he \nhad looked at right after was Bleeder, Shadow Star&#39;s superior officer. \nThey had both talked, and Tyrael had explained his reason&#39;s for his \nchoice. Bleeder had been in agreement. Now, Tyrael had to announce it \nto the principal interested...\n  He went to the junior officer&#39;s quarters. He hoped the young officer \nwas there. After searching for a few minutes, he found the bot&#39;s door, \nand pressed the button announcing him.\n  Tyrael: I am Colonel Tyrael. I have come to meet with you, Shadow \nStar.\n\n\n"}}
