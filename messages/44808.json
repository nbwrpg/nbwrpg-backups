We send some chars to \nCybertron only a year or two after their original time, to find that a \ngiant metor had devestated the planet leaving only small groups of \ntransformers no more than two or three hundred per group. That way it \nwon&#39;t matter what the capital city was called, we won&#39;t denig BM, and \nwe can still get plenty of new chars out of the small groups (not to \nmention we&#39;ll have alot of work to do to get the planet ready for BM \nto happen in 300 years cities to build and everything its just I&#39;m \nplanning to bring in a char from the future and he revolves around the \nfact that BM DID happen). Furthermore I still say we need a seperate \nOOC message board.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; no.. your wrong\n\n\n"}}
