It was as if she&#39;d never landed let alone changed \nbodies. he was impressed by his acomplishment. he could tell she was \ntoo. All that was left was to wait till Lady Hawk, Foxfingers, and \nLunarpine returned with the DNA samples they&#39;d found.\n\nGot to get some sleep before going to work tonight, it&#39;s been fun, \nwe&#39;ll chat later.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She went outside and was bombarded by scents and sights that she \n&gt; never thought possable. The sky was the brightest blue she had ever \n&gt; seen. The air carried so many different scents and smells. She \nmoved \n&gt; around in beast mode and tested her new body.  She loped around the \n&gt; clearing and felt her new paws on the grass. It was like she had \njust \n&gt; been born again. She spread her wings. She lifts off the ground a \nfew \n&gt; feets and feels the wind under her wings. She knew that it felt \nlike \n&gt; to fly, or thought she did. It was like she was just set free. No \n&gt; cares or worries, she felt free.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis wanted to keep her inside until she sniffed him. He knew \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; newly formed protoforms tended to have a feral aspect about them. \n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; was to his advantage to let her out and see what she was capable \n&gt; &gt; of. &quot;Alright, you can go out but stay close I don&#39;t want you \nhaving \n&gt; &gt; any problems with your new form.&quot; he led her to the door and let \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; out. It was later in the day than he was used to. He needed some \n&gt; &gt; rest. he couldn&#39;t rest though, not with Shadow Wing still \n&gt; adjusting. \n&gt; &gt; He had to be awake in case anything happened to her.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
