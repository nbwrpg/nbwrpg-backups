Slayer \nsees two shadows above him, knowing they were more bots.\n\nActivating his jetpack, Slayer erupts from the water. His scanners \nreported that Prebon was already in the Predacon base. It was too \nlate. Slayer growled, baring his teeth.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here. Its too late. Meet me at base and we&#39;ll plan \nthese bots&#39; demise,&quot; he says over the comm to Ignatis as he blasts off \ntoward the Trainer base. He would take a different route so that the \nPredacons couldn&#39;t follow as easilly, and he would stop at several \nlocations in case they did follow. Those bots would pay for taking his \nmaster, they would pay dearly...\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Elecktra/Attilla/Luzbel::\n&gt; \n&gt; The under water cannon shot against Slayer (25 times), Elecktra \n&gt; appeared in robot mode(She had used other place to leave the \nbase)and \n&gt; she had in her a sort of staff.
