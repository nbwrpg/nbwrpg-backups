Fired shots to try and block as many shots as he \ncould. With \n&gt; Dark mouse still in his arms. Galvatron turned around and fired a \nfew energy \n&gt; blasts and zoomed straight up. and back towards the base dodgeing \nthe fast \n&gt; moveing bot. They were close to the base. Were a nice surprise \nwould wait for \n&gt; them.\n\n\n"}}
