She \nwondered \n&gt; if he was going to do the same to her. She lowered her hand on her \n&gt; gun as he turned to her.  She noticed how he addressed her as \nmaster \n&gt; and relaxed slightly. But she wasn&#39;t sure just how this bot would \n&gt; react or how he would fight. But what she had just witnessed, he \nwas \n&gt; good. She nodded to him and smiled slightly, trying to hide her \n&gt; emotion over Destructor&#39;s death. \n&gt; &quot;Yes, it appears we do have things to discuss.

It was not familiar but he knew \n&gt; destructor and it \n&gt; &gt; could only mean an advantage. All the horsmen created eachother. \n&gt; Once again \n&gt; &gt; reunited. Destructor also said hello. Suddenly the origanal 5 \n&gt; looked up in \n&gt; &gt; pure terror. They all looked at the tm2 dragon landing at thier \n&gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Apocalypse!&quot; those would be the last words of the once great \n&gt; &gt; destructor....Apocalypse grabbed him by the throat and proceeded \nto \n&gt; rip off \n&gt; &gt; his head. Apocalypse wiped the mech fluid of his hands. He turned \n&gt; to Kit Kat. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;My name is apocalypse. We have much to discuss. Destructor was a \n&gt; weak being. \n&gt; &gt; Now the real war can begin.&quot; all the horsmen bowed on all fours \nto \n&gt; thier new \n&gt; &gt; master.
