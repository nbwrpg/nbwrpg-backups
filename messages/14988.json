The only thing we can \n&gt; do is use the pieces of hull we took off and....Wait! I&#39;ve got an \n&gt; even better idea! Ramulus, can you shout down the liftoff count? \nThis \n&gt; thing is gonna go in a few minutes, and when it does we&#39;ll be stuck \n&gt; and liq will burn up in the atmosphere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix headed over to Gekkidama&#39;s dead body and picked it up He \npressed \n&gt; a few buttons on his arm, and his back plate popped off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Portable shield....Don&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t use it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Br5ix shoved the shield into the hole.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This shield was designed to take huge beatings. I think it will \nhold \n&gt; the re-entry. Shut down the countdown, I &#39;ve got to go somewhere \nfor \n&gt; a sec. Even though Gekkidama tried to kill, he was really insane \nfrom \n&gt; lac of contact. He still desrves a proper burial(In the show, did \n&gt; Dinobt have a burial, or did they just blast him into space?). I&#39;ll \n&gt; go cover him in some of the ship wreck.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix picked up the body and walked away.\n\n\n"}}
