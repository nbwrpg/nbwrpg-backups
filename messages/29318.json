Loony is not to be confused with Moony although a \n&gt;Moony\n&gt;is typically considered a religious nut.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Aerotaur::\n&gt;     As he stands watching this he thinks to himself *Oh good we got \n&gt;another\n&gt;loony on our hands.  And a religious loony at that.*  &quot;Perplex.  Take a \n&gt;break\n&gt;inside.  The last thing we need right now is for you to go insane too.&quot;  He\n&gt;looks at the exposed energon.  It wasn&#39;t a large amount.  &quot;Windlord, \n&gt;Perplex,\n&gt;clear out.&quot;  He flew upward and fired one shot at the energon detonating \n&gt;it.\n&gt;The ensuing explosion wasn&#39;t enough to kill anything that wasn&#39;t right on \n&gt;top\n&gt;of it, but it would do some minor damage to the base.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
