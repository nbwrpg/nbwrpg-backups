Well it wasn&#39;t exacty \nstanding.  He\n&gt; &gt; just happened to be upright on the floor.  He had no way of \nmoving.  He\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; acctually quite bored.  He needed someone to talk to or fight \nwith or\n&gt; &gt; something.  He could still breath and his mouth was open but he \ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; properly form words.  As a young bot he had practiced the lost \nart of\n&gt; &gt; ventriloquy.  He decided to try his hand at it again.  &quot;Is hare \nany way to\n&gt; &gt; hurn his off?&quot;  (I figured it out, this can be said easily \nwithout moving\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; mouth or tounge.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
