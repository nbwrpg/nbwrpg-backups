Kaiser, your opinion is welcome anytime you want to give\nit to us. The goal here will be to kill the Predacons on the spot.\nAlready, I have sent Deathsteel as an infiltrator in their ranks. He\nwill make it easier for us to get them. I was planning to use everyone\nhere to rip them apart. Anyone wants to back up now?\n\nDreadplague shakes her head.
