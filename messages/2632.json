Iron \nRaptor and Prowl.  Those two had been gone for several mega-cycles.  Suddenly \nRamhorn&#39;s mind got an idea.  If those two had actually been there, or if any \nother Maximal other than the renegade (and psychotic in his pro. opinion) \nSuukie had been there, Stinkbomb would&#39;ve lived.  But no.  The pathetic \nMaximal forces lead by that fool Liono Prime did absolutely nothing.  \n    &quot;That&#39;s it!  I&#39;ve had enough of this!  I won&#39;t stay here just to make \nmore friends, and literally watch them die!  I&#39;m out of here...these idiots \nhave already slagged up the timeline almost beyond repair.  I won&#39;t take any \npart of this.&quot; Ramhorn yelled.  Going to his quarters, he gathered his few \nbelongings.  Tapping into the light source of his room, he was able to gather \nsome spare energon.  Walking down to the bottom of the Autobot craft, the \ndoors slid open.  Looking to Prowl and Iron Raptor, who were kind of in his \nway (though he could&#39;ve walked around).  Surging forward he shoved (don&#39;t \nmean to mode) through between them, swearing at them and calling them vulgar \nnames in ancient Cybertronian, heading east in the direction of Africa.\n\n===================\n\nDouble Punch watched Jackle and Pheonix pass him, at a fast pace.  \n&quot;Hmmm...let us help them.&quot; he said, looking back to Manterror and Injector.  \nBoth Predacons nodded with evil smiles, all three running off after the two \nother Preds.\n\nUpon reaching where they had followed Jackle and Pheonix, they spotted \nMantella, and Quickstrike.  Guns raised from Jackle and Pheonix.  \n&quot;I&#39;ll cover Quickstrike, you two cover that Mantella freak.&quot; Double Punch \nyelled, cloaking in his steath mode, moving a dozen feet so he didn&#39;t stay in \nthe same area, raising an invisible pincher, 10 feet away from Quickstrike.  \nTwo energy-signature seeking missiles targeted at the Fuzor&#39;s chest.\n\nAt the same time, Injector and Manterror raised their weapons at Mantella, \nstinger missiles and ion disks aimed at the other Predacon.\n\n&quot;What seems to be the problem?&quot; Injector yelled, to Jackle and Pheonix, \nhoping there was going to be a fight.  He&#39;d prove he was the best of the best \nin the Predacon forces.\n\n======================\n\nKoga Shuko mumbles inaudibly, calling Set an idiot.  &quot;Next time, come to me \nand talk.  I&#39;m busy planning our next attack.&quot; he said sternly leaving the \nthe room, cycles later entering the lab.  Walking up to the evident cloning \ndevice, he looked at the computer part.  89% complete.  Looking over the \nfigure, it looked like it would be over 7 feet tall.  From the feet to the \nmiddle of the chest was completely re-animated.  &quot;Ah, you will be a valuable \nasset indeed.&quot;\n\n===================\n\nAnubis looked to Hades.\n&quot;This is boring.  We should do something constructive.&quot;\n\n&quot;Like what?&quot; Hades asked.\n\n&quot;Repair the hull.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh.&quot; he replied, a little discouraged.  &quot;Aright.&quot;\n\nActivating his com, Anubis spoke.  &lt;Koga Shuko, Anubis,  Hades and I will be \nfixing the hull of the ship.  If you require anything let us know&gt; he spoke, \nKoga replying that was a good idea.  Both Predacons chuckled, heading for the \ncargo bay of the craft to get the necessary parts and tools.\n\n\n"}}
