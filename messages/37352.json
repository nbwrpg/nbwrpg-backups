Well it wasn&#39;t exacty standing.  He \njust happened to be upright on the floor.  He had no way of moving.  He was \nacctually quite bored.  He needed someone to talk to or fight with or \nsomething.  He could still breath and his mouth was open but he couldn&#39;t \nproperly form words.  As a young bot he had practiced the lost art of \nventriloquy.  He decided to try his hand at it again.  &quot;Is hare any way to \nhurn his off?&quot;  (I figured it out, this can be said easily without moving the \nmouth or tounge.)\n\n"}}
