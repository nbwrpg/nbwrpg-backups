Before they get killed!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She knew she wouldn&#39;t have enough time to even try, but she hoped \nthe\n&gt; &gt; others would be closer to them to try to save them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SAB + 1 walk out of the woods, they just walk out into a field,\n&gt; &gt; playing nicely since they were drunk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Meeting you guys was the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Rizopas says. He pours a beer on his head. Blender laughs and \npours a\n&gt; &gt; beer on Rizopas&#39; head. He looks around to make sure nobody is\n&gt; &gt; watching them. Stronghold leans up against a tree, making funny\n&gt; &gt; sounds and peeling an apple down to nothing with his finger!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Land Mine and Time Bomb leave the base in shame, why did this\n&gt; &gt; always happen to them? Whatever, they had to find KitKat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;KitKat left because of us, I know it!&quot; Land Mine said. She was\n&gt; &gt; crying again. Time Bomb growled and walked on. They both walked\n&gt; &gt; through the field that SAB were in in their search for KitKat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We need to apologize to her, she thought we loved pain, but\n&gt; &gt; really, we just need it to bring back the memories and because we\n&gt; &gt; deserved it.&quot; Time Bomb said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Right on, brother!&quot; Stronghold said. They both look at SAB and\n&gt; &gt; Company.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Brother?&quot; Time Bomb asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not your brother, skank!&quot; Blender yelled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Who is my brother?&quot; Rizopas asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;My brother is dead, I kill he!&quot; Stronghold said with a laugh.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Kill these 2, yes?&quot; Rizopas asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, lets kill those pansies.&quot; Stronghold said. Blender and\n&gt; &gt; Stronghold stood up, Rizopas stood up and walked in front of them.\n&gt; &gt; Time Bomb and Land Mine both stared helplessly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ilike Rizopas alot more than I liked Arrow, so let&#39;s let \nRizopas\n&gt; &gt; live!&quot; Blender suggested to Stronghold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, we just kill the 2 pansies!&quot; Stronghold said, pointing at\n&gt; &gt; Time Bomb and Land Mine. Land Mine opens her commlink, she didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; think of this before.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;KitKat? I&#39;d like to say that me and Time Bomb are sorry, we \nhad to\n&gt; &gt; say it now, because we&#39;re about to die, don&#39;t bother sending help,\n&gt; &gt; these 3 guys will have us in a million pieces by the time help\n&gt; &gt; arives.&quot; Land Mine said, she sent that message to KitKat and \nclosed\n&gt; &gt; her eyes.
