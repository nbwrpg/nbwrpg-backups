Autobots!&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice boomed out. &quot;There are only\nthree of you against all of us!&quot; Cyclonus continued as he gestured to\nthe obvious disparity in numbers.\n\nCyclonus&#39; shoulder mounted cannons glowed but were not firing. &quot;If you\nsurrender now perhaps Hydras will have mercy on you and end your\nexistance quickly. To fight on is only an exercise in futility.&quot;\n\nScourge as per his habit stepped up behind Cyclonus to back him up.\n\nDeepstryke turned his weapons on Tuscon and Rodimus simultaniously,\nalthough with Cyclonus pausing, he followed suit.\n\nPhobia leaned against the wall present as small a profile as possible\nas she looked for an open shot.\n\nNightrazor on the other hand, after taking a moment to observed\nshimmered and then vanished from sight.\n\nOn the otherside of the fight, standing near Tuscon, Rodimus glanced\nat Nightshift and then over at Tuscon, &quot;If you have a plan we had\nbetter get it moving. This is going south fast.&quot; he said in a fierce\nwhisper to Tuscon.\n\nRodimus looked back at the Decepticons and Predacons as he held his\nweapon steady on Hydras, &quot;If we fall,&quot; Rodimus said quietly to himself\nunder his breath, &quot;then Hydras falls with us.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
