Dewboy, care to tell me how \nthirst \n&gt; broke free when a claw was imbedded in his back?\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; \n&gt; The kick met its mark and sent Void spinning in the air before \nhitting the \n&gt; ground. He then rose to his feet and staggered as he held the side \nof his \n&gt; face that was kicked, a neat imprint being present. Void scowled and \nthen \n&gt; drew his blaster once again and fired several more blasts at Thirst \nas his \n&gt; cloak then opened and one of those flying creatures once again flew \nout and \n&gt; then exploded a few inches from Thirst, the explosion also sending \nVoid \n&gt; sprawling to the ground given their close proximity.\n\n\n"}}
