List all tran=\r\nsformers separatly according to Maximal & Predicon affiliation.&quot;  As the co=\r\nmputer lists all the transformers on the planet, Fracturcon is shocked by o=\r\nne name that is listed on the screen.  &quot;Dinobot?!?!  How is that possible? =\r\n I thought the clone was destroyed along with the Nemesis?  Computer, scan =\r\ntransformer Dinobot&#39;s spark & identify.&quot;  After a few moments of the comput=\r\ner scanning it responds, &quot;Spark identified as Dinobot.&quot;  &quot;What!?!&quot;, Fractur=\r\ncon says in disbelief.  &quot;How is that possible?  Computer reley location of =\r\nDinobot.&quot; No sooner does Fracturcon receive the coordinates from his main c=\r\nomputer that he immediatly activates his booster rockets & flys out of his =\r\nnew base.  &quot;Computer activate parimeter shield & defense grid,&quot;  Fracturcon=\r\n tells his computer as he flys on a direct intercept course to where Dinobo=\r\nt is at.  How can he possibly be alive, was his sparks actually cloned itse=\r\nlf?  The barrage of questions flow through Fracturcon&#39;s processor like ligh=\r\ntning but the one main question remains....How can this be the one & true D=\r\ninobot, who sacrificed his spark to save this planet&#39;s inhabidents? Fractur=\r\ncon knew the answer to his question was not that far away.\n\n*****Internet E=\r\n-Mail Confidentiality**********************************\nNotice:  This e-mai=\r\nl may contain information which is privileged and confidential.
