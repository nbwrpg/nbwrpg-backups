But it was all happening, it was all for real.\nIron Raptor nearly jumps out of her armor when she feels something touch her \ncheek, opening her optics in time to see Prowls fingers touch her cheek.\nShe takes his hand and holds it as it relaxes and finally goes limp, looking \nover to look into his optics with hope that he was feeling a little better \nnow, and would live.\nBut with his energy so low, she knew that that was hoping for a bit too \nmuch.\nIron Raptor held Prowl closer to her, her optics looking sadly into his.\nShe watched as her love tried to speak, and heard his fading voice.\nMore tears ran from her eyes as she sat there with him, very well being \ntheir last moments together.\nHer voice was a whisper, but held more love then ever possable.*\n\n&quot; I...love you too.&quot;\n\n\n* She could feel Prowl slipping farther and farther away from her now, \nalmost as if all he wanted was to tell her he loved her, and was ready to \ndie now.\nIron Raptor watched as Prowl leaned his head back and looked up at her, \ntheir eyes meeting and her seeing his filled with love.\nShe stroked her fingers gently along his cheek and neck, realizing that this \nwas probably it. The last moment they would ever be together.\nWith her spark aching and her eyes wet she leaned close to him.*\n\n&quot; You&#39;re in my spark, Prowl...forever.&quot;\n\n* And with that she kissed him gently on the lips, then deepening it with \nexpressions of her love for him.\nFor, this would be their last.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
