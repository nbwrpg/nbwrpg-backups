A \nheavily armored sub that can take a lot of damage is one thing.  Just a sub \nas big and powerful as a base, that&#39;s a mobile base.  What has done to the \nAlliance Base is not mobile.  We can&#39;t have it fly around and shoot people, \nor retreat.  We had the five pieces in shuttles with a small escort.  We had \nto DISASSEMBLE the base.  We didn&#39;t activate any engines.  We&#39;re lucky no one \nattacked the shuttles, they probably could&#39;ve caused one to crash and hinder \nour plans greatly, but no one did.\n      True, we are locked on a island with a base and nice defenses.  But \nhey, how the hell is the Alliance supposed to get into the Cybertronian Fire? \n We could bust through the shields after being bombed by missiles, EMP \nblasts, and autogun fire.  Then blow our way through the doors.  And then \ndeal with the autoguns and flamethrowers in the halls, and the autoguns in \nrooms.  But that&#39;s the challenge!  That&#39;s what makes the game so fun.  You \nhave to be clever.  Or you just wait until you outnumber your enemy.  \n    Ally up with the Maximals or something.  Let the Maximals go in and take \nall the fire while you come in with your sub, wait unti the shields are down, \nsurface, deploy your troops, and dive.\n    Finally, the thing about knowing your plan.  We don&#39;t.  If we knew you \nwere going to make a sub, we&#39;d wait until we were sure of the location, and \nattack with all our men, or just strafe you with our jet people.  See, the \nway I see it, after you left, the Predacons got seperated and weak, while the \nAlliance just twiddled their thumbs and go strong enough to push anyone \naround.  Now you&#39;ve come back, and coincidently a short while after you \nreturn the Preds are united and already plotting bigger things.  \n    Luck smiled upon us.  But, JP, I&#39;d be an idiot to tell you ways of \nbringing down the Alliance bases, or weaknesses.  But, here&#39;s a hint.  I&#39;ve \nplayed a little game called StarCraft for a long time.  I&#39;ve noticed, when \nI&#39;m vastly outnumbered and outgunned, constant, strong attacks tend to weaken \nenemy forces.  To the point where my attacks don&#39;t kill mass troops, but they \nstart destroying buildings.  Then the opponent gets weaker.  I destroy more \nbuildings.  Until the point where I merely have to search and destroy the \nremnants.  There&#39;s my two cents)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...  \n\n"}}
