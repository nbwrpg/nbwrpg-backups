As has been stated several times \nalready, there are TWO groups of artifacts.  The cubes found aboard \nthe Pred ship - and subsequently scattered to several places, \nincluding Tripred HQ - were parts of a drive core belonging to a race \nat war with the Vok.\n\nThe Soul Orbs were here since Primus-knows-when, and belong to the Vok \nthemselves.  (Attention, Meteara!)  Empath&#39;s discovery of one has \nactivated the other two on-planet, and potentially attracted more from \nthe depths of space.  Each Orb contains the souls of up to a thousand \nVok, hence the name.\n\nIf it&#39;s still not clicking, maybe we need a new mod.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Huh...
