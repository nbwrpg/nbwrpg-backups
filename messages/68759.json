First on=\r\nly a few sprinkled amidst the \n&gt; skies like soot, but then all too quickly =\r\nthey grew in both number \n&gt; and size!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then two bright lights seemed to=\r\n streak from the group, like \nshooting \n&gt; stars bursting from amidst the cl=\r\nouds. As they passed through the \n&gt; group the motes of black are briefly li=\r\nt, revealing the distinctive \n&gt; oblong shape of Scourge&#39;s hunters, trackers=\r\n and killers! Many \n&gt; centuries from today humans will dare to call them so=\r\nap-dishes with \n&gt; cannons, but today they have arrived and are intent upon =\r\n\ndestruction!\n&gt; \n&gt; As the twin lights pass out into the open skies they onl=\r\ny become \n&gt; brighter and more powerful as their pod like shapes reveal thei=\r\nr \ntrue \n&gt; character: MISSILES!! Like twin suns they streak forward, direct=\r\ning \n&gt; their destructive power down upon Hydras&#39; base, even as the rest of =\r\n\n&gt; the approaching host continues inexorably onward!\n&gt; \n&gt; The Minions have =\r\narrived!!!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
