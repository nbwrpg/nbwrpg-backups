She unleashed the three fusion rays at the \n&gt; Maximals base. The shields, already damaged by Rockseeker&#39;s \nkamikaze \n&gt; attack, were further reduced to a total power of 15%.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade barely had time to avoid the blasts . He transformed to \n&gt; jet mode and went straight to the hude station that Lunekill was. \nShe \n&gt; was already charging her cannons for a second attack, but she never \n&gt; saw the attack coming.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Maximal dragon-jet fired in the central cannon. The charge in \nit \n&gt; blew up and ripped the cannon to splinters. However, the counter-\n&gt; attack took him out of the sky and he fell like a brick to the \nground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the base, Yggdrasil tried to coordinate the attacks. There \n&gt; were only two attackers, but he couldn&#39;t even realize how \npersistent \n&gt; they were.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: All units, Azureblade has been hit. The frozen one is \nback \n&gt; in the fray, and the shields won&#39;t hold out much longer.
