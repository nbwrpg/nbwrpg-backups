The energy barrette having been blown apart \nin the blast. As soon as the explosion dissapears Hellpeon just \nstands there as a smile traces his face.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;You are a fool... you think this training thing was for me \nto fight you? No my friend it was to weaken you. Two of your weapon \nthings are gone. Only one left. You are no longer a threat to me. But \nnow I think I will make you fully realize this.&quot;\n\nHellpeon smirked as his wings spread, and as they spread seemingly \nthree others follow. A moment later he darted off to the side at high \nspeeds two more things that look exactly like him following. In a \nbrief moment he springs into the air as the other two spring forward \nand glow before each turns into a ball of intense Chaochitan Energy \ndirected to slam into Ultimo, at the same time two eyes seemingly \nappear within Hellpeons shoulders before each fires a beam of \nChaochitan energy at Ultimo.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Ultimo smiled as well.  &quot;Once again, you have shown your fatal \n&gt; flaw, you think I give a damn!&quot; Ultimo said as he unattached the \n&gt; shield.  &quot;Do you feel anything Guarda?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Umm yea, my insides are expanding, the energy within me is \n&gt; uncontrollable, it&#39;s going to blow, help me Campeon.&quot;  the shield \n&gt; cried out.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmm, all right, for once I will help you.  I will give you a quick \n&gt; death.&quot;  With that Ultimo threw the shield at amazing speed at \n&gt; Hellpeon.  The shield zipped through the air and a few feet infront \nof \n&gt; Hellpeon it exploded as a energy barrette ripped through it.  The \n&gt; blast spread out and was immense.\n\n\n"}}
