She was not instinctively\n&gt; harsh or cruel, but \n&gt; her tone showed that she was to be listened to.\n&gt; Owlhawk may be a \n&gt; warrior, but she was more. She was a Wolf Warrior,\n&gt; and she had to \n&gt; break him from the tactics and habits he was used to\n&gt; make him into \n&gt; something more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: Neg. A Clan warrior that is not prepared,\n&gt; mentally or \n&gt; physically is as good as the freebirth scum\n&gt; populating the bandit \n&gt; caste. You must learn to be ready at all times.\n&gt; \n&gt; She eased her tone. She had rebuked him, and now was\n&gt; the time to \n&gt; instruct him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya: The Clan rituals have two goals; the first\n&gt; one is honor. The \n&gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a circle of\n&gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; fight zellbringen, single combat. I admit that\n&gt; necessity may prevent \n&gt; us from always achieving single combat, but honor\n&gt; does not diminish \n&gt; this way. The second reason for Trials is that it\n&gt; prevents waste. The \n&gt; Clans have survived their birthing because they\n&gt; reduced wastes of \n&gt; all kind to a minimum. Remember that. Now... What do\n&gt; you do if a \n&gt; superior gives an order to raze a forest to make\n&gt; more place for a \n&gt; military compound?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC:  Sorry I thought they were going to wait\n&gt; until\n&gt; &gt; they talked to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:  Owlhawk moved over and stood at attention in\n&gt; &gt; front of her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Owlhawk:  I assume to prepare your warrior both\n&gt; &gt; mentally and physically for combat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- warriorazure &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: What are you doing, you freebirth slag?\n&gt; Move\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your circuits over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; here!
