He fealt it necessary to make sure that he reached the Black\n&gt; Fortress before they did.He was to the SouthEast of  Greece when he\n&gt; detected two signals moving in his direction useing his personal\n&gt; frequency. He stopped, curious about how and why bots on this planet\n&gt; would be useing such basic frequencies. &quot;Go on ahead, I&#39;ll catch up\n&gt; to you.&quot; He radio&#39;d back to Attilah and Kali.
