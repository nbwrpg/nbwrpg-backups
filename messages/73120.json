She kne=\r\nw the face was\n&gt; most vulnerable and hoped to hit him there.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Seriousl=\r\ny?!  Get real!  STRAIGHTSHOT MAXIMIZE! &quot;\n\nThe quills that STRAIGHTSHOT fire=\r\nd launched through the air like\nminiature missiles! But instead of being fi=\r\nlled with explosive\nordinance they were sharp and barbed darts that sailed =\r\nat SABERBACK,\nhitting him full in the face!\n\nHowever instead of inflicting =\r\nthe massive amount of damage that they\nshould have inflicted, they just cau=\r\nsed SABERBACK to stumble back for\na moment as he reflexively defended them =\r\nagainst her onslaught. And so\ninstead of penetrating his faceplate, they me=\r\nrely bounced off the\nshielding he had put into place and fell harmlessly to=\r\n the ground.\n\nSABERBACK shook his head as he laughed menacingly, =93I am pr=\r\notected\nagainst your barbs.=94 He said darkly as he pulled out his weapon a=\r\nnd\noriented it on STRAIGHTSHOT and was about to pull the trigger when a\nbla=\r\nst sent him spinning to the side!\n\n=93Pick on someone your own size!=94 The=\r\n voice and the author of the blast\nwas TORCA as he waded through broken SHA=\r\nRKTICONS to reach STRAIGHTSHOT\nand SABERBACK!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride&#39;s st=\r\nomach begins to rumble rather loud as the Sharkticons\n&gt; continue to come at=\r\n him.  He makes an awkward face with ears up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uh Ohhh..  I think I ove=\r\nrdosed on those bean pods...  INCOMING!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His tail raises as a huge clou=\r\nd of green smog is released in the Sharkitcons\n&gt; direction.  Rattrap holds =\r\nhis nose as he fends off his enemy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; PU!  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m mostly down win=\r\nd of that.  But those creeps might not be\n&gt; so lucky.   Sheesh, that&#39;s wors=\r\ne than tear gas.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSeveral of the SHARKTICONS veer off to the side i=\r\nn order to avoid the\ncloud of green the wafts up into the air. However as t=\r\nhere is no\nbreeze to speak of, being that they were in a cave rather than t=\r\nhe\nopen air of outside, it stays right there, a big cloud of stink!\n\nThe SH=\r\nARKTICONS, despite their original aversion to it, seem to\naffected only sli=\r\nght as they streak through it trying to tear at\nQUICKSTRIDE and RAT TRAP wi=\r\nth long sharp teeth!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson manages to elude Magmat=\r\nrons sword with a quick crouching\n&gt; maneuver, and then a series of leaps an=\r\nd backflips.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Again you don&#39;t seem to understand Magmatron. Size is no=\r\nt everything.\n&gt; But cunning can be.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While in flight, Tucson breaks off=\r\n a stalactite and attempts to lodge it in\n&gt; between Magmatrons sword arm, a=\r\nt the shoulder joint!  While doing so he\n&gt; soars over the larger warrior wi=\r\nth great agility.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nMAGMATRON laughed, =93Ahh yes, you are full of al=\r\nl the platitudes of\nyour mentor!=94 He slapped away the stalactite with his=\r\n blade sending\nthe pointed piece of rock spinning through the air and then =\r\ncrashing\nto the side falling to the ground in pieces.\n\n=93But don=92t you s=\r\nee I have size AND cunning!=92 He laughed again as he\nleaped into the air, =\r\nmatching TUSCON flip for flip and landing on the\nground next to him and aga=\r\nin slashing out with his sword, this time in\na far more expert manner!\n\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nOLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight mad an effort to move but she fell more exausted. she d=\r\nidnt know\n&gt; how longer she could resist without fell in stasis, she feared =\r\nthat because\n&gt; she didnt have a chance to get out of her enemies hands.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; nightlight made a quick movement and tunr off the cover diver that disgu=\r\nide\n&gt; her signature, now any alli could have the chance to track her if Sab=\r\nerback\n&gt; takes her prisioner\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt the moment no one is paying much at=\r\ntention to NIGHTLIGHT as\neveryone around her is apparently engaged in comba=\r\nt! STRAIGHTSHOT=92s\nquills fall around her harmlessly, the ones that had mi=\r\nssed SABERBACK\nand tumbled away from his shield block.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT=\r\n let out a series of blasts, trying to prevent the SHARKTICONS from\n&gt; effec=\r\ntively using their vast swarms, even these upgraded models had to rely\n&gt; on=\r\n numbers, rather than ability to win!  Firing his heavy tail cannon at\n&gt; th=\r\nem, trying to use their numbers agaisnt them!\n&gt;\n&gt; All the while, wondering =\r\nif SKYBYTE was acting as their field general, or\n&gt; there was something amis=\r\ns here and something he was misreading, but for now\n&gt; focused on thinning t=\r\nhe herd!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe =91herd=92 was indeed continuing to thin as the SHARKT=\r\nICONS fought to\nswirl back in the direction of SKYBYTE, who at the moment d=\r\nid appear\nto be orchestrating events. The blasts from DINOBOT were eating i=\r\nnto\ntheir numbers as more and more of them were falling to the ground; But\n=\r\nnot only from his blasts but also from the MAXIMAL FUZORS as they also\nleap=\r\nt into the fray, teeth, claw and talon slicing into the\nSHARKTICONS as well=\r\n.\n\nIn the middle of all of this SKYBYTE stood smiling now as he watched\nthe=\r\n battle progress. Several SHARKTICONS landed next to him acting as\na set of=\r\n bodyguards. Lifting up his arms he directed others to\ncontinue their attac=\r\nks against DINOBOT and the others as well.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, VICE GRI=\r\nP went down over in the huge pile.  His superior strength\n&gt; and skill wer e=\r\nonly good..  To a point.  As the huge pile went on top of\n&gt; him, his heavy =\r\narmor was dented, rended, stirpped away as the PREDACON\n&gt; WARRIOR tried to =\r\nsmash, split, bash, blast, and blitz his way up through the\n&gt; pile, but he =\r\nseemed to be piled even deeper now.\n\nThere looked to be a small storm over =\r\nVICE GRIP as they piled. There\nwas confusion over him as the SHARKTICONS we=\r\nre falling into a frenzy\nof sorts! Teeth and powerful jaws were gnashing at=\r\n him as they\nattempted to rend his armor plates from his chassis.\n\nMeanwhil=\r\ne at the dead center of the room was the pit over which the\nstill silent fo=\r\nrm of OPTIMUS PRIME still hung by chains that stretched\nhigh over head and =\r\nfastened to the ceiling of the chamber somewhere.\nThe pit itself was perhap=\r\ns 40 feet wide traversed by a small yet\nsturdy stone bridge.\n\nAt the same t=\r\nime DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS had fought their way onto\nthe bridge, both of =\r\nthem looking banged up, their armor pitted,\ndented, scratched and blasted. =\r\nYet neither of them seemed to notice it\nas they pummeled at each other!\n\nBe=\r\nneath the bridge smoke began to rise as red, yellow and orange\nflames licke=\r\nd their way up out of the pit themselves and began to\ndance beneath it.\n\nFr=\r\nom a few meters away SABERBACK paused in his conflict with\nSTRAIGHTSHOT and=\r\n more recently TORCA as if he felt something. He\nglanced over at OPTIMUS PR=\r\nIME, =93NO!=94 He said. =93It cannot be!=94\n\nHanging from the chains, his b=\r\nody now black and seared, OPTIMUS\nPRIME=92s optics flickered once and then =\r\ncame back on line. However\ninstead of their normal white or yellow hue they=\r\n were crimson!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
