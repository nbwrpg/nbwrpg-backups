He made sence. She would have to take \nsome time off away from them and sort things out on her own. But not \nnow. Now she had a wat to focus on and her pack to help survive this \nwhole mess.  She sighed and looked at War. &quot;I thank you with all my \nspark for your council on this matter.&quot;  She turned and walked out of \nthe lab.  She stood just outside the door way and looked at the \nwall.  She was very confused and getting scared.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  War saw her face. &quot;Do not think of this as a bad thing. Do what \nyou want. \n&gt; Just bec drillbit proposed first does not mean a thing. Destructor \nwas not \n&gt; around then. So how will you ever know. But all I can do is tell \nyou this. \n&gt; Think of who makes you happy. Who you can see as your protector \nyour love and \n&gt; your life. I know i cant help you make this desicion. No one can \nhelp you. I \n&gt; suggest you take some time away from both of them and think. Do not \ntell \n&gt; drillbit yet of what has happened for I fear what he may do. I \nleave you know \n&gt; to protecte destructor. I owe him that much. He is the noblest bot \nI have \n&gt; ever meet.&quot; He walked away and stood infront of the cr holding \ndestructor \n&gt; standing guard.\n\n\n"}}
