A dusty wreckage covered bot coughs. The bot thinks to \nherself, &lt;Where are you Lynxiz?...&gt; Her optics pick up trace amounts \nof light filtering towards her. She clenches her fist, then starts to \nwiggle her way into a more convenient position.\n\nNoticing that she&#39;s half covered by a sheet of armour, she grabs the \nedges and comences to push the plate upward, till her legs are free. \nRising to her feet, still holding up the plate, Lynxiz forces it \nupward, till any debris still covering her had slid of the plate. She \nmoves backward a bit, drops the plate, and leaps forward into a roll \nto avoid any other hazards.\n\nAfter regaining her sense, she opens a commlink to Prowl. &quot;Commander \nProwl, Lynxiz reporting. I was buried outside... I think that i took \nsome of the blast.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
