Finding \nout about the two mutants would probably be a good idea, but would it \nbe worth helping this Predacon? Probably not, but it would depend on \nwhat he wants.\n\n-Then ask him,- Prowl&#39;s thoughts sound in her head. She growls \nmentally (in her mind).\n\n-I can think for myself, Prowl,- she replies, feeling an apologetic \nthought from Prowl in return.\n\n&quot;What exactly do you mean by &#39;our cooperation&#39;?&quot; Iron Raptor asks \nMegaton. She was leaning toward telling this bot to get out of her \nface. While she talks, her comm replies to Quatro&#39;s message.\n\nThe message to Quatro, inaudible externally other than by comm, \nread: &quot;Hmm. If you wait for a while I&#39;ll be right with you. I&#39;m \ntaking care of something important right now.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; continuing last post\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton wasn&#39;t surprised at the results of this meeting, he knew it \nwould\n&gt; take alot more than a few words and some &quot;good intentions&quot; to win \nthem over.\n&gt; He couldn&#39;t go back to the Black fortress like this, he couldn&#39;t \ntake no for\n&gt; an answer. &quot;Perhaps I could convince you another way.&quot; he saw that \nhe&#39;d have\n&gt; to raise his bid to convince them. &quot;I&#39;ll give you copies of any \ninformation\n&gt; at my disposal in return for your cooperation&quot; the offer was on the \ntable,\n&gt; the die was cast. &quot;Even a little history on these two.&quot; He pointed \nat the\n&gt; two bots from Veratis. Thier silence had just become his weapon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine wanted to lash out and silence the beast in freaks skin \nbut he\n&gt; knew that would raise to much suspicion. he lowered himself to \nIce&#39;s side\n&gt; thinking to her, &quot;Well what do we do now?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
