The two weakest bots were the\norigional targets so he remained fixxed on scrapping them first.\n\nArty noticed that Slags attention was turned away from him. he raised his\nright arm and fired a sidewinder from the winglike attachment mounted at\nit&#39;s side. his left hand found his mini launcher. he drew it from his\nholster and fired an impact grenade toward Crossroads. His equilibreum\ncaused dizzyness and he stumbled backwards his weight carrying him towards\nPacifix.\n\nSwitchblades optics began to blurr as Repugnus&#39;s waves took thier effect. He\ntried to adjust his optics to compensate but it was no use. he flew backward\nslowly until he could feal the building behind him. he dug his feet into the\nside hopeing that the effect would wear off shortly.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 28, 2001 9:54 PM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n\n\n&gt; ::Repugnus/Slag/JetV::\n&gt;\n&gt; Repugnus continues running at Switchblade while emitting color waves to\n&gt; disrupt the bots optic sensors.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Slag::\n&gt; Slag spits another wave of fire towards Dogged.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; JetV arrives at the battle scene some bit away.
