And what about \nthese dieties....I have no clue what Shuko is talking about. ( and more \nimportantly, do I RP one of them?) \n\n::: He turned to the main counsol and began typing in several codes. He \nincreased the shileds by a few points, and re-routed available power to the \nmain auto-guns. That was all he could do from inside the ship. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron could see Hell Beast and Jackle from across the hallway. Al he \ndid was stare them down, without saying a word. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Are you just going to stare at me the entire time?\n\n::: Megatron ::: Im sure my troops are outside right now. When they free me, \nI will kill you, both of you.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Last time I checked, you left your troops to die, and \nQuickstrike was being used as a pin cusion.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Silence. I have a deal with Set. He will deliver me the \ntransmetal 2 tech box, and I will give him the location for the vein of \nenergon youve been mining for the past year.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: That is if we get out of here.\n\n::: Megatron nnodded. They were both trapped, and from what they could hear, \nthe ship was getting pounded. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Very well. Once we get out of here, we go our seperate ways. \nNo betrayals.\n\n::: Hell Beast gave a grim smile ::: Of course.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: The collasal armored turtle marched through the woods followed by \nTransanulas who looked like a midget next to his counterpart. They came \ncloser to Quickstrike, only to see another bot with him. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: Is that your idea of an army?\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Uh-no. They must have...dispersed.\n\n::: Before Marine could respond, a huge explosion of gunfire echoed through \nthe forest. It was the battle at the newly fallen ship. :::\n\n::: Marine ::: I do belive I have just found a battle. I will go there, \ngather the Predacons together, and overcome there foe!\n\n::: Transanulas ::: You sound like somekind of twisted Silverbolt...all this \nglory and honor!\n\n::: Marine ::: I am a general...and Im suspecting youre a traitor.\n\n::: The spider entered the clearing with Quickstrike. Marine went after the \nother bot while Transanulas took out a med pack to fix up Quickstrike. :::\n\n"}}
