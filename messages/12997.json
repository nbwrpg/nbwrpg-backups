She wiped \nher face and tried to dry her eyes.  She looked up at them and nodded \nher head. Then looked back down at the floor.   She still kept her \narms wrapped around herself. She wasn&#39;t going to move any closer to \nthem and tried to get back further into the corner, but she was \nalready against the wall.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor gave Feline a small pat on the shoulder when she \nthanked her, \n&gt; just trying to calm her to the point that she wouldn&#39;t be\nsobbing \nany \n&gt; longer. But when she suddenly got up and walked over to the corner \nagain \n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and shook her head, the fembots actions drawing \nmore \n&gt; sympathy from her.\n&gt; She looked over towards the open door and a smile came across her \nface, glad \n&gt; as ever to see who was standing there.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed again and shook her head at the shaking fem, \nknowing that \n&gt; she didn&#39;t just trust anybot. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry. He&#39;s on our side.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She spoke with a smile to prove herself right, gesturing towards \nProwl \n&gt; with her thumb. But then her optics narrowed and she looked towards \nhim \n&gt; without turning her head. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Even if he IS a bit ugly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The smile remained on her lips, and she knew that Prowl would get \nher back \n&gt; for that later. Iron Raptor then looks at Feline with a reassuring \n&gt; expression on her face, letting her know that it was all right to \nsit back \n&gt; down. But then she thought of something that might calm the femm, \ngesturing \n&gt; towards Prowl. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Feline. This is Prowl, our military strategist and field\nsoldier. \nProwl. \n&gt; Feline, a new bot to the Maximal forces.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She finished with a gesture towards the fembot. Just hoping that \nthis \n&gt; would ease the fear that Feline felt, even if just a bit. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
