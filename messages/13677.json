That little dog \nwas supposed to have settled this thing. He went out, and opened fire.\n\n    Waspinator soars down from the sky and dives right into the bunker \nopening like a flash. He jets down the tunnle, and sets down in the Triangle \nroom.\n    &quot;Hello mouse bot!&quot; He said to Darkmouse, and then walked past them to \nBlack Aracnia.\n    &quot;Megatron wants to know why you cut of communications. Hes very mad....&quot;\n    Aracnia shook her head. &quot;Tell him to come here, now that the communicator \nis broken. Take Atma and his ally with you to assist in the battle. Ok?&quot;\n    Waspinator nodded and turned to Darkmouse. &quot;Bub bye mousey. Hehehe.&quot; And \nthen flew away.\n\n"}}
