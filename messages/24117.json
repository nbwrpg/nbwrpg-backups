AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Ok, my power has been out for over 57 hours.  It \nisn&#39;t the first time, and it won&#39;t be the last.  Also had to do some major \nclean up at home.  Throw away a lot of stuff from the fridge and freezers.  \nClean up the kitchen.  Stuff like that.  Then had to wrestle control of the \nphone line from my brother and father.\n\nOk, so anyway, I checked all the e-mails yesterday at my dad&#39;s work, but I \ncan&#39;t access those anymore.  So, I&#39;m going to have to try and remember what \nhappened.  Sorry if I don&#39;t reply to everything, I&#39;m trying to remember what \nit all is.\n\nAlso, about the Cybertronian Fire, and the area that surrounds it.\n\nTHERE ARE NO TREES NEAR THE CF!  NONE!  NOTTA!\n\nAlso, there is no where to hide!  It&#39;s all flat grasslands, and the grass \nisn&#39;t even a foot high!  So please, please, pay attention ta that.  \n\nThank you.  I will be replying shortly soon.  I&#39;ve got a lot of other online \nresponsobilities right now.  Other RPGs and crap.  Also, I&#39;ve gotta get all \nmy character profiles (Thanks Zardus, enjoy your last night of living before \nChyort rips your throat out and rips you limb from limb :) .  So, I&#39;ll try \nand get back to ya&#39;ll as soon as possible.  But I noticed a lot of people \ndidn&#39;t respond to the attack I made before my power went out.  I&#39;ll ignore \nthat since I held up the game a little.  )\n\nL. Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
