Ya know, bots like Tucson and I aren&#39;t\n&gt; usually associated as bots with swagger.  Nope not us but we showed the hot\n&gt; rods a thing or two when we went cubb&#39;n at the Blue Diode.  Ohh yeah we were\n&gt; all over the swagger thing.   And even now, heck, we still got it.  Well as\n&gt; soon as I get a make over I will.  Can&#39;t wait ta slip inta some cat like\n&gt; reflexes, and be&#39;n able ta land on my feet a hundred percent of the time.\n&gt; Oh yeah, nine lives would be good too.
