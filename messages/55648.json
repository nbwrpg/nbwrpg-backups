She couldn&#39;t help but \nwhimper and whine a bit, thinking of her mom and dad. The repairs \nwere complete, yet she stayed inside.  A whimpering noise could be \nheard from outside the chamber. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; windlord caught the little fox and  said glenty &quot;You&#39;re happy \nlittle \n&gt; one, a new friend...
