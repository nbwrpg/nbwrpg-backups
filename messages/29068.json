I had to go \nto this awards banquet for day school and changed my Internet provider. The \nreason none of my characters have Bios is because for a while me and friend \nhave be reading books on animation and studying it in my art class. So I \ngoing to Try ((Try Being the key word)) to animate a 3 minute short for my \nbios one for each characters. But to see if this works the way I want I&#39;m \ngoing to try to do a general music video for the Neo Beast Wars. This is \nlong time taking process which means with day school, night school, work, \nand mischief, the two of us will be working on this in our spare time. But \nbefore I start I want to ask permission to animate and draw your characters \nfor the general Music Video. The characters that get picked we will be \nlisted and we are picking by the Bios you posted on the Web site if your bio \nreads well enough to draw you then your character may get picked. If you \ndon&#39;t want to be drawn say so and you will not be picked. Characters that \nare drawn will be drawn in a drawn by Gene in Transformers G1 style or with \nstrong anime edge by me. Before I start if I make this and it is decent will \nyou add it to the page Yan?))\n\n\n::The WildCats::\nAll of the Wild C.A.T.S enter stealth mode and fall back to Cats Layer.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
