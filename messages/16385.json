I want to get my Vulois story on with.\n\nStarscream/Gotron\n\nStarscream got Phobia&#39;s messages.\n\n&quot;Yeah, no problem. I told Zardus all we know about Megatron, and he&#39;s \nwilling to help. I&#39;ll try to see if I can get a battle ready.&quot;\n\nStarscream turned to Gotron.\n\n&quot;Looks like battle time. You in?&quot;\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t miss it for the world, as the humans say.&quot;\n\nStarscream sent a comm to Zardus.\n\n&quot;Zardus, it&#39;s Starscream. I hate to disturb you again but something \nbig has just come up from my group. It is a neccesity that I meet \nwith you. Please respond.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\nPrebon shook his head.\n\n&quot;I only said one possibility. You could capture me here and force me \nto free Striker. No. I will be at the spot in 2 mega cycles. I will \nbring both prisoners. If you are not there, they will both die. Let&#39;s \ngo.&quot;\n\nThey all turned back, Hammer and Ignatius dragging Spears back. \nIgnatius went to Beast Mode and put Spears on his back. He took off \ninto the sky as Prebon and Hammer walked back to the base. Ignatius \nspoke to Spears.\n\n&quot;You better hope Ramulus shows, or Striker gets the chip.&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq both got pissed.\n\n&quot;Damn it! You know, before we left for the moo, I shook hands with \nStriker and told him I&#39;d see him again if I made it. He assured me I \nwould. Now he&#39;s the one who isn&#39;t going to make it. I say we show up \nat the quadrant, but WE show up and toast that guy!&quot;\n\n&quot;Easy Brix. You&#39;re letting Bronco get to you. It&#39;s Ramulus&#39; decision. \nWhat are we going to do?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
