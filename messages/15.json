He played the first notes \nlike a gather of leaves racing across a field of long grasses, then he \nslowed the notes like drifting cherry blossoms. The heavy fur at his \nshoulders wavered with the wind. He played his song to the dying sun, as he \nsometimes did. He had this little instrument ever since he came on-line. It \nwas there, a little piece of his history that he didn&#39;t understand. Maybe he \nwas some sort of musician in his freetime, because he knew how to play it. \nHe knew many songs, and played them to let the wild hear it. The wild was \nthe only one that could. There was no bot out here to tell him if it was \nbrilliant.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
