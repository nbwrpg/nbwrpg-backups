The wolf didn&#39;t want to play his hand yet. This wolf wanted to\ntest Slayer to the fullest without giving away his abilities just yet. Logic\nwould dictate to Striker that he could be sensed so Slayers logic circuits\nwould probably do the same. Lunarpine had to be ready to move and move fast.\nTransmetal Wolf  (Or is it TM2)VS Adjusted Wolf soon both would learn which\ntechnology would reign supreme.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, October 18, 2000 4:15 PM\nSubject: Re: Spears and Darkmouse\n\n\n&gt; Once again, if any of this is moding to Spears, it is void.

If she woke up and ran off, it wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be too good.\n&gt;\n&gt; He enters, raising an eyebrow when he sees Kluster standing with a\n&gt; wheeled pallet behind him. The pallet had reinforced arm leg, and\n&gt; head straps, and had a strange device above the &quot;pillow&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Most of the crew are out on missions, so I&#39;m stuck with the fetching\n&gt; jobs,&quot; Kluster explains as Firearm puts Spears on the pallet, &quot;That\n&gt; device will block out transmissions and also acts as a scan jammer.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Firearm looks at Kluster like the bot had finally snapped. &quot;Sir, I\n&gt; have been on this ship for a while now, I&#39;m not one of the new\n&gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster smiles, realizing he had been explaining something to Firearm\n&gt; that Firearm probably knew everything there was to know about.\n&gt; &quot;Sorry, hosting a factions isn&#39;t exactly easy on the nerves, you\n&gt; know.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Firearm nods, moving the pallet and heading over toward the lab with\n&gt; it. &quot;Do you know if we have a bot specialist on this ship, sir? My\n&gt; knowledge of surgery and reprogramming might not be enough for this.\n&gt; Its pretty limited.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;All right, it&#39;s game time,&quot; said Prebon, &quot;Slayer, you start us\n&gt; off.\n&gt; &gt; Stay in cloak and hunt down the wolf. As soon as you open fire on\n&gt; &gt; him, we will attack the Ark. I think we will stay in cloak, and it\n&gt; &gt; will make them confused and by Blaze more time. Okay Slayer.
