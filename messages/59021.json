All bots concentrait your fire on that one. \nWe have to stop him to save the base!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup started unloading plasma shot after plasma shot at Rockseeker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus and Darkangel exited the base at that time. Rodimus \ncalibrated his forearm blasters and optic rays, unleashing eight \nsteady photon beams at Rockseeker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkangel aimed the tips of his swords at the incoming Minion, \nwhich shot photon blasts of his own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully the combined firepower could slow Rockseeker, maybe even \nstop him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunekil&#39;s slow form had her come into fireing range a little after \nher brother. The &quot;DS9&quot; form rotated before fireing a blast of \nunknown energy at the first bot who attacked her brother, Ancient.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Azureblade was entranced, but not oblivious. He could feel them. \nTwo \n&gt; immense forms of energy rippling through the Matrix. These were \n&gt; going to be devastating.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: No Kup. This won&#39;t be like any battle. If we have to \n&gt; die... let&#39;s make them regret every millimeter in our sparks they \n&gt; kill!\n&gt; \n&gt; He changed in dragon mode with a roar aqnd headed outside.\n&gt; \n&gt; AzureBlade: Activate all the defenses you can! We have one chance \nto \n&gt; survive, so let&#39;s not blow it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rockseeker was closing in fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rockseeker: This is it sister. Take care of the bugs, I destroy \n&gt; their hive.\n&gt; \n&gt; He changed in meteor mode and picked up more and more speed. \n&gt; Ancient&#39;s daggers hit him and got stuck, but his rocky hide did \nnot \n&gt; convey anything of it.
