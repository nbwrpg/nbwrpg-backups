It&#39;s engines barley work. If it \nwasn&#39;t for the two Decepticons hard work, the ship would have fallen \napart a long time ago.\n    Domnijoe was piloting, her temper foul.\n    &#39;Who couldn&#39;t you have picked a better piece of garbage?&#39; she \nsnapped, glaring at her companion. He was busily welding a tattered \ncomputer unit together. \n    &#39;It was all I could find,&#39; Blindchaos said, surprisingly \nunoffended. His cheerful grin grew wider to the dismay of the \nCybertonian Jet.\n    Domnijoe snorted, furious that she was stuck with an almost \nuseless ship. They were lucky if it made it to Earth&#39;s moon in one \npiece.\n    &#39;Slaaaaaggg....what a stupid piece of.....&#39; she muttered. She \npushed herself away from the consol and set the ship to autopilot. Or \nwhat was left of it. She turned to Mindchaos, her red eyes \nsmouldering. \n    She and Blindchaos had broken from one of the few gangs left on \nCybertron. They planned to search for more Decepticons. It had been\nan \nobsession of Domnijoe&#39;s since an alien mining vessel had aroused her \nfrom her stasis pod. She had been left for dead by her comrads and,\nin \nher searches to find her breatheren, found Blindchaos. Domnijoe \nremembered when Decepticons occupied a small planet called Earth and \nhoped the original coordinates handn&#39;t erased in her memory. It felt \nlike a long time ago, when Megatron had commanded the Earth-based \ntroops. He was a lot better than the morons Domnijoe left behind on \nCybertron. She was tired of the petty bickering on her home planet. \n    Thus the reason she dragged Blindchaos along. To look for Earth. \nThey had stolen a ship, but were trailed and shot down. They took \nrefuge in an old Maximal outpost until the threat had left. That had \ngiven Blindchaos time to uncover and repair an ailing scout ship.\nThat \nled them to their present situation. More than a dozen times they had \nstopped and welded the stupid thing together. The whole scam was \nirritating to Domnijoe. At least Earth wasn&#39;t far from here...maybe a \nday&#39;s flight. \n    &quot;Stay together for one more lousy day, garbage heap.&quot; she said, \nsmacking the consol. Part of it&#39;s frame loosened with a screach and \nfell to the floor with a clang. \n    Blindchaos looked up with a start.\n    &#39;Be gentle, deary.&quot; he said, returning to his work.\n    &quot;BE GENTLE???? I aught to trash this thing myself!!!&quot; Domnijoe&#39;s \nscream echoed loudly in the near empty ship. Most of the metal plates \nthey had brought had been used to patch holes.\n    Blindchaos sighed in his typically good natured way. \n    &quot;We&#39;re not going to make it to Earth if you insist on breaking \nthings.&quot; he said. &quot;Be Gentle.&quot;\n    Domnijoe slapped her head. It was going to be a long flight....\n\n************\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n*************************************\n\n\n"}}
