His optic sensors still not \nrecieving anything.  Then all of a sudden his whole body shook, or so it \nseemed.  All of a sudden he knew where everything was all around him, \nthe bot carrying him, Trinity walking beside him, the walls.  Even \nthough he could not see any of it.  It was there.  Then it dawned on \nhim, he had inherited one of the many skills of a mole.  To feel \nvibrations like no other can.  With his sight now gone this was \nhightend.  And it felt great.  He was still to weak to do anything other \nthan sit and think.  This awoke a memory from thousands of century&#39;s \nago. Of a bot made to destroy organic life, and a bot to protect it. \nAnd the wars between them. The there was nothing.  Once again he entered \nstasis lock.\n\n\n"}}
