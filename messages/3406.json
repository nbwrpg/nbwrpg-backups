After \nfiring at the Maximals attacking that fool Injector, and a Predacon he&#39;d \nnever seen, he leapt from the bushes, raising  both pinchers, he fired a \nmissile at Stegotron&#39;s back, and a missile at the back of Triceradon&#39;s left \nknee.\n\n---\n\nRamhorn got up slowly.  Taking out a laser pistol, he fired two shots.  At \nthe same time a photon blast skinned his hand.  Dropping the pistol, he \nnoticed a small hole in Counter Punch&#39;s stomach.  Right were he had been \naiming for.  Charging forward, he leapt through the air, attempting to tackle \nMosquitor.\n\n\n"}}
