He was getting pist and \nbored.  He reached in his leg carpartment and grabed a small bomb.  He \nwalked over to a tree and placed the bomb next to it.  He set the bomb to 5 \nseconds and walked away. He got just out of range when the bomb blew up.  He \nwas sure someone in maximal city could hear the bomb go off.  He found a \nrock and sat down on it wating for someone to notice him and let him in \nmaximal city.\n\n\nOOC: will some maximal check the radar and notice Hugar outside or can a \nmaximal relize that no one is checking the radar, and check it.  Please.  \nOhhh Jume, come on, Please...\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Beast Wars AKA Proto&quot; &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: When will the maximal become brilliant???\n&gt;Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2001 19:25:03 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt;�Hugar�\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hugar waited outside the base, if no one noticed him soon he was going\n&gt;to set a bomb.\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
