She looked at the soil, \ntears stringing at her eyes. \n\nDamn those automatic tear ducts. She couldn&#39;t cry now! Not in front \nof someone! Her father had always given her hell for even -looking- \nsad.\n\nShe blinked them away angrily, and looked back up. &quot;Okay fine, I&#39;m \nselfish. I can&#39;t be trusted. I am totally dishonost&quot; Her voice \ncarried undercurrents of hopelessness. &quot;Is that what you want to \nhear?&quot;\n\nHer voice cracked at the last sentence. She couldn&#39;t believe she was \nargueing with Carnage! This couldn&#39;t be happening. \n\nBut in the back of her mind, something nagged at her. This anger \nhadn&#39;t all come from her just leaving. Well, yes, quite a lot of it \nwas aimed at her, but there had to be something else. Maybe she \nshouldn&#39;t ask..\n\n&quot;And no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to leave someone behind. Okay, \nfine, so you won&#39;t forgive me. I&#39;ve said I&#39;m sorry, and that&#39;s all I \ncan do, short of making it up to you. Tell me what I can do to make \nit up, and I&#39;ll do it. Anything, I don&#39;t care. Grovel, Go up against \nthe Pred army, anything. Please Carnage, I want to be friends again \nbut we can&#39;t be friends again like this&quot;\n\nDepressed. That was the only word that sprang to mind when she tried \nto think about herself. Wow, she hadn&#39;t felt that emotion in.. ages. \nTeltoli found herself wishing that a huge big hole would come up and \npull her into it, but she had to face this.\n\n\n"}}
