Hmm..&quot; Autofire says, deciding not to try and \nmake Megatron understand the difference between opressing opposition \nand fighting it. Leaders never understood that anyways. &quot;No, I want a \ngarauntee of payment.&quot;\n\nAutofire keeps his gun aimed at Megatron, thinking something \nover. &quot;For now, I will work for you as long as you provide me with \nequipment and anything else I may need. However, with you alone, I \ndoubt you can provide even that.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He new Autofire would respond this way, as a Mercenary, he had \nworked for\n&gt; the Autobots, a move that outraged galvatron, but Galvatron did \nlittle to\n&gt; remedy this, but Megatron was desperate. &quot;Even when I rule, there \nwill\n&gt; always be someone who steps up with heroic nonsense, and the people \nwho are\n&gt; ruled have to be kept under our heel. It would be more \ninteresting&quot;. This\n&gt; robot was dangerous, Megatron noted, he would have to watch out for \nhim. &quot;I\n&gt; am here to rebuild what Galvatron destroyed, and as far as I know, \nI am the\n&gt; only Decepticon left. What do you want? Just a promise of payment \nfor your\n&gt; services&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
