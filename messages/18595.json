She saw at one end of the room, saw \nsomething sparkling.  She walked closer and saw what looked like a \nspark gettig cut with a lazar.  She wondered what or who&#39;s it might \nhave been.

She swallowed hard. \nThen speaks in a very hushed voice,&quot;Megatron, if it is his spark, \nthen he must be dead. Inferno was right.
