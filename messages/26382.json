It didn&#39;t matter to him. \nOptimus Prime could arise if he wanted.\n\nHe looked at Motormaster, waiting for the bot to speak.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer, Demise, and Greven also hearing the voice. EndBringer \nsmiles. This meant that there was another bot out there to kill!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDarkmouse nearly jumps up as she hears the voice. &quot;What the?!&quot; She \nlooks down at DrillBit and Dollen. &quot;Did you guys hear that??&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWalking through the corridor&#39;s of Darkfate&#39;s base, Goldeneye spins \naround at the voice, looking at the hallways with a surprised \nexpression.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dark Prime--&gt;Optimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He had been wandering for days, not caring if he returned to \nNod. Suddenly he got a feeling that something wasn&#39;t right in the \nUniverse. There were too many evils, and and age old riverly could \nnot be brought to a close.\n&gt;     Galvatron was alive. Optimus Prime was stuck within the \nEvilness of Dark Prime. They would not be able to fight both being \nevil. Primus needed to be sated.\n&gt;     The Time Gateway (remember that?) Glowed with a firey reddness. \nThe source of Prime&#39;s evil and his lust for the power of Cronus was \nseated there. The Gateway exploded, shattering into thousands of \npeices.\n&gt;     Dark Prime fell to his knees. His body was wracked with pain. \nHis chest panel opened of it&#39;s own will (well, not really) and the \nAutobot Matrix emerged. It floated out from Prime&#39;s chest and then it \nopened. Releasing all of Prime&#39;s goodness back into him, but leaving \njust enough evil to get the job done. Prime&#39;s body went through a \nchange as well, from his knees to his feet became Blue, his upper \nlegs became white, his arms and chest became the familiar Prime Red. \nHis mouth plate became silver, along with much of his face, the \nhelmet that surrounded it bacame blue, his hands also became Blue.\n&gt;     As the Matrix went back into his chest a giant light emitted \nfrom him, it covered the entire planet (got permission) everything on \nthe planet saw this light.\n&gt;     A voice boomed over the planet, all bots could hear this as \nwell, no matter where they were. The voice said, &quot;Arise, Optimus \nPrime.&quot;\n&gt;     Dark Prime had died, Optimus Prime was reborn, with a new drive.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Please add Dark Prime to the Matrix)\n\n\n"}}
