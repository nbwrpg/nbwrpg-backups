I like him alot but I better start thinking about someone else. it would work better if he liked me but I guess help save him two times just isn&#39;t enough. He never thanks me and someone does for anything I do. If I&#39;m staying than I&#39;m ignoring Quickstrike. I&#39;m not doing him anymore favors so he can give a damned angry look. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;*Stingtra says to Windfire* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Talon Harvilicz &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: nbwrpg@egroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, July 31, 2000 10:08 PM &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wildfire: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wildfire slammed her head against Stingtra&#39;s shoulder, but not enough to knock her off balance. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Why? she asked. Seems to me that you were fine with them a few megacycles ago. Even with Quickstrike. You even thanked me for helping him.

She ran after her and leaped in front of her, with her side to her. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Go back scorpion-bot, she said to her. Do you want to die? She imaged weak Quickstrike sitting in the CR chamber with KitKat, Stingtra and herself by him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstrike: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstrike scooted to the side of his sleeping area to a spot that was in the corner. His head hurt and he was still dizzy. He wished something could do something for his head. He covered his head and laid down. He cocked his leg out and slammed his heel against the wall of the cave. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;-----------------------! ------------------------------------------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
