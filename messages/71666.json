I&#39;ve watched all the G1 series epis=\r\nodes so I do know that.  The Seekers are far more sentient than the Sweeps =\r\nand to me far more intelligent.  So one question does remain, is Dark Rodim=\r\nus a living extension of Rodimus that somehow remained after he got rescued=\r\n?  And is there a possibility that Tucson will have to face off with the re=\r\nal Rodimus to get him to realize that he has a serious demon to get rid of?=\r\n  And could there be a demon to slay on Tucson&#39;s end too?  After all he isn=\r\n&#39;t without his weaknesses too.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is, could this be a=\r\n sort of test for both Rodimus and Tucson Prime, who seem to suffer from la=\r\nck of self confidence and anger management?  And can they actually help eac=\r\nh other overcome these weaknesses and win a victory in the name of their fa=\r\nctions?  Just curious about the storyline in general.\n\nPerpetually on the m=\r\nove and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 14, 2011, at 9:07 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;The temptation to form premature theories =\r\nupon insufficient data is\n&gt; the bane of our profession.&quot; - Sir Arthur Conan=\r\n Doyle\n&gt; \n&gt; Heya!\n&gt; \n&gt; Just thought I would throw that out there before we =\r\ncontinue to far.\n&gt; Is anyone confused by anything thus far?
