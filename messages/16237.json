As it \ndesended, it looked like a falling star, heading to the earth&#39;s \nsurface.  It fell to the ground and left a large impact creater.  The \npod took several hours to cool.  By midday, the DNA scanners had \ntraced over an animal and encoded the bot inside to that animal. The \nbot inside did not emerge.  It&#39;s aliegnment chips and memory had been \ndamaged in the crash.  It was in reconstruction and internal repair \nmode while inside the pod.  The pod landed four miles from the \nAllience base.  The bot inside the pod was female.  She lay there, \nwaiting for her programs to sort out and to awaken her.  \n\n\nName: Squizzy\nBeast Mode: Mongoose\nBot Mode: Female,  polished crome skin.\nFunction: scientist, bio-techno enginer, programmer.\nWeapons: one quazar pistol, optic lazars, crossbow.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
