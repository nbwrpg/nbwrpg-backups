Here is the message in full.\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras snakes watched the suspisious behavior of Sky Shadow and said in loud\n&gt; vouice &quot;Sky Shadow! Come here !&quot; and looking at Leo Prime said &quot;If you\n&gt; excuse me few moments Leo Prime, I have to... exchange some words with Sky\n&gt; Shadow&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; the male moved some feet away and waited for Sky Shadow\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a grunt from LEO PRIME as he turned away, &quot;Make it quick.&quot;\nHe said, &quot;We have a mission to get to.&quot; He began to walk towards the\nfront of the group, his feline tail flicking in the air.\n\nMeanwhile SKYSHADOW glanced at HYDRAS and then walked over to him.\n&quot;What is it sir?&quot; He said, his voice full of innocence. &quot;I thought you\nwere ready to begin.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, DINOBOT and CRYOTEK were obviously escorting HYDRAS, and it\n&gt; was unknown to DINOBOT if LEO PRIME had managed to detect the two stealthed\n&gt; PREDACON units of VICE GRIP and BLACKARACHNIA.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing then, and taking note of the MAXIMAL AERIAL ESCORTS.  While the\n&gt; escort of MAXIMALS was too heavy for a plotted assassination attempt, but\n&gt; with communications seemingly down according to what was being said over the\n&gt; area, if the MAXIMAL LEADER LEO PRIME could be split apart from his escorts,\n&gt; then perhpas he could be overwhelmed..  AT the ver least, an amusing thing\n&gt; to contemplate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, in the trees BLACKARACHNIA kept her myriad optics in her spider\n&gt; mode peeled, glancing up at the aerial Maximals while she languidly thought\n&gt; about how she could disable thier wingspans.  But, quite simply they were\n&gt; too BIG for her to take out even from ambush and with luck on her side and\n&gt; cut off from support.  LEO PRIME had chosen his backup well, and there would\n&gt; be nos neak strike.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just what would they find over out there, and what would they be going after\n&gt; now?  SHe would watch and wait carefully before revealing herself.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSo far everything and everythig was on high alert. MAximals and\nPredacons working together never was an easy thing. Neither side\ntrusted each other, and the tesnsion in the air could be cut with a\nmicroserated blade.\n\nAt the moment the communication lines were still open, including the\none between BLACK ARACHNIA and TARANTULUS, but very soon, as they\nwould venture further towards the forest, that too would cease to\nexist. They would all be cut off from outside help, and they would\nhave to rely on their own skills and instincts, and even each other.\n\n&quot;I expect a full report when you get back.&quot; TARANTULUS transmitted\nthrough his link with BLACK ARACHNIA, &quot;But for the moment I will have\ntime to keep an optic on Hydras&#39; base while he is gone.&quot; There was a\nsoft chuckle from TARANTULUS as if he were already contemplating some\nsort of mayhem.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
