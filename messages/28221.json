You had Rattrap fire two shots, and then 25 rapid shots.  \nThat is a total of 27 shots, two shots over the limit)\n\nUnicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Shockwave/Demon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh\nRipper/Streetwise/Groove:\n\n\n\nUnicron saw a bolt coming, and fired off two optic blasts before it was \nseveral feet away from Angel Prime.  Flying up quickly, he avoided most of \nthe shots fired on him but two plasma charges hit him square in the chest \nknocking him back a foot in mid air, the robot only laughing.\n\nHe fired off five rapid optic blasts at Rattrap and raised both arms, \nlaunching an energy-signature seeking missile at Starwind from one, and a \nmissile of the same type at Angel Prime.\n\n---\n\nVehement dodged the EMP blasts and a missile, the other exploding against his \nchest armor but not piercing it.  He sighed as his chest singed painfully, \nraising an arm and launching an energy-signature seeking missile at Killfest, \nfollowed by a single optic blast.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher gained altitude rapidly, escaping two missiles, the ion disks, \nand the fireballs, two optic blasts intercepting one missile, the other \nknocking Sun Crusher backwards in the air a few feet.  He raised a wrist, the \ncannon attached to it firin three fusion blasts at Greven.\n\n---\n\nReflector watched Endbringer land and jump into the air in Reflector&#39;s \ndirection, but didn&#39;t even get close since Reflector was around a hundred \nfeet up.  \n\n&quot;These heathens grow dumber by the day.&quot; he laughed, raising a wrist and \nfiring down two missiles at the Predacon scum.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf almost fell because of Streetwise&#39;s precise shots, but he growled \nand fired off three optic blasts at the Maximal&#39;s sternum.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper felt the blasts strike and laughed at Groove, forming an orb of \nenergy in his left palm with the equal power of a grenade and throwing it at \nhim.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw felt a fireball strike him, but in his heavily armored mode it \ndidn&#39;t do any harsh damage.  He launched four missiles off at the CF.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise yelled out, the grenade-like orb sending him flying back in the \nair and crashing to his back, a small hole in his cheset armor.  He coughed \nup some mech-fluid and began gathering strength to get up, until the rapid \nblasts from Shockwave pierced into his already wounded chest.  Getting up \nwasn&#39;t on his mind for now.\n\n---\n\nThe force of the optic blasts twirled Groove, who let out a sigh of anger and \nducked down, firing of two photon blasts at Demon Wulf&#39;s right knee joint, \nand three optic blasts up at Shockwave.\n\n---\n\nShockwave rolled in the air, avoiding the laser blasts, and launched two \nmissiles down at the Cybertronian Fire, soon followed by twenty-five rapid \nlaser blasts.\n\n"}}
