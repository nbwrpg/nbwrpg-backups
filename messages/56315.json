She flew higher to \ngain a better view. She still didn&#39;t see the bot but her scanner was \nstill showing it. She sighed and wondered if her scanner was acting \nup. She did a barrel roll to change her course a bit. As she did, she \nsaw another bot flying above her. Her scanner was not showing a pred \nor maximal signature. Her scanner was just a tad out of date. She \nmade the mental note that when she got back to base, to have that \nfixed.  She flew up towards the bot, hoping for a friendly encounter. \nNot a mechfluid bath. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Hevn::\n&gt;        He continues to fly at a much higher altitude.

He had only heard her voice in the \nPredacon base \n&gt; and hadn&#39;t taken the time to look at her.  He knew he recognized \nher from \n&gt; somewhere but he couldn&#39;t quite place her.\n\n\n"}}
