But as we know, appearances can be\n&gt; deciev=\r\ning as his watchful optics carefully examining HYDRAS&#39; talking\n&gt; heads, a c=\r\nalculating glint in his other wise subservient appearing\n&gt; optics, as his r=\r\night &#39;hand&#39; which was more lioke some large claw\n&gt; &#39;clacked&#39; against each o=\r\nther.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT merely nodded over at the orders then.  There was no =\r\nsense in disobeying HYDRAS then.

After all, a girl&#39;s allowed her own fun.&quot;  NOt a direct lie=\r\n, she wouldn&#39;t have to tell Tarantalus personally - he was already listenin=\r\ng in, after all!\n\nPouting softly, &quot;And I&#39;d want to hear the sort of..
