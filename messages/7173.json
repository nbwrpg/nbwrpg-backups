It in a grassland.\n\nJason Lind, not only are 30 missiles overkill, but its illegal. Check the \nrules, they specifically say two missiles per character per post. The rules \nare a bit flexible, but not THAT flexible.\n\n::The Cybertronian Fire/Rex/Kluster/Ramulus/Striker/Smokescreen::\n\n&quot;You&#39;re late, Predacon!&quot; Rex yells excitedly, seeing Hell Beast run in, \n&quot;Can&#39;t even keep an apointment!&quot;\n\nRex lifts his missile launcher, firing it at Hell Beast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster sees Hell Beast and his troops enter the battle. Finally! He takes \naim, firing several shots from his rifle at Hell Beast.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve been wondering if you&#39;d ever grace us with your presence, Hell Beast!&quot; \nKluster yells over to Hell Beast, continuing to fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus looks at Hell Beast&#39;s group. So they finally decided to show up.... \nHe takes aim with his slagmaker at Jackle, firing three shots at the Pred.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen and Striker spin around as Hell Beast and his group make their \nappearence, both firing at Gremlin.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Cybertronian Fire&#39;s defences detect the new arrivals. Two missile \nlaunchers target Hell Beast, both firing a missile at him.\n\nTwo laser batteries shoot at Gremlin, the other two firing at Jackle. The EMP \ncannons, now recharged, pop up again, firing their paralizing beam at Hell \nBeast, then returning to recharge.\n\nThe autoguns pop up, swirling around to fire at all the attackers.\n\n"}}
