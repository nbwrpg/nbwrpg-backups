That means she is on her way to talkng to the Maximals. I \njust don&#39;t know what Cybershark is up to.(Vulois than sees Child come \nup in the corner of his eye.) Oh! Excuse me Optimus, but I&#39;m going to \nhave to ask you to leave now. I have a studetn waiting to be trained.&quot;\n\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq walked into the bridge of their old ship, so stunned at \nseeing all their old history to bother looking at Ramulus. They \nheaded over to the main computer.\n\n&quot;Well, here it is. Ramulus, I&#39;m sure you know how to remove a \ncomputer. You can show us how without destroying it. Ramulus? \nRamulus? Oh Man! He didn&#39;t follow us! He could get lost in the ship. \nGo find him Fliq.&quot;\n\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream looked at Megatron, and realized that he was the Megatron \nfrom the Beast Wars. Maybe their still was a chance of being accepted \ninto the Predacons. He bowed before Megatron.\n\n&quot;Megatron, I ask to be enrolled into your service. I no longer crave \npower, only destruction. My record speaks for itself, as I have won \nevery battle in my life except for Galvatron. Please Megatron, allow \nme to be your warrior.&quot;\n\n\nFliq ran out of the bridge and began looking for Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Ramulus! Hey, where are you buddy?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
