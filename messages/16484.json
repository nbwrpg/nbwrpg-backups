Prebon relieved Bullet.\n\n&quot;Go now. We have this under control. Hammer said he might have \nsomething you should look at. Wait infront of the base for him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Bullet left. Prebon gazed intot the cell and saw Striker.\n\n&quot;Look at him. Good news! You are going to go home soon. Just a quick \nlittle surgery and you&#39;ll be set to return. I&#39;m not going to put you \noffline for this operation. More fun watching you scream. But Spears \nwants to say something to you.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Hammer arrived to meet Bullet.\n\n&quot;Look at the scrap I found from a bot I killed! It&#39;s mostly intact, \nwith some good weapons!&quot;\n\n&quot;That means....&quot;\n\n&quot;Right! You can probably make the HB1 again!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, but it will still be different. We&#39;ll call it the HB2. The \nHammer Bullet 2. It&#39;ll be the greatest war suit anyone has ever worn.&quot;\n\n&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get started!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream tried to contacr Zardus again.\n\n&quot;Zardus! I&#39;ve got an emergency. I just need to ask you a quick \nquestion: How many of your soldiers would you be willing to spare to \njoin our army to fight Megatron? Bloodystrike is already there, and \nGotron said he would join, but is their anyone else I can take back \nwith me?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix yelled to the rest of the group.\n\n&quot;Snowcat, Ratchet, Andromena, come on! Help us install these computer \nboards until Ramulus gets back!&quot;\n\nBrix adn Fliq re-enetered the Ark and went back to work.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois/Eagle Eye\n\nVulois had to think of a strategy. He saw Eagle Eye try to attack, \nand made it look like he almost wanted to die, so he had a plan. He \ncalled Eagle Eye over.\n\n&quot;Eagle Eye, would you anything to keep the mission alive? Even at the \npoint of your own death?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes I would Vulois.&quot;\n\n&quot;Than so be it. Good-bye Eagle Eye. You have surved with true loyalty \nto the mission.&quot;\n\nVulois de-activated Eagle Eye and opened up his chest plate. He \ncrefully removed the Spark and dropped Eagle Eye&#39;s lifeles body to \nthe ground. He raised the spark above his head.\n\n&quot;Now Nemesis, meet your greatest threat! I have the power of myself \nand Child with me, and the Sprak of an honest and true bot. You can \nnever win now.&quot; Vulois began to channel energy, almost all he had, \ninto Eagle Eye&#39;s spark, &quot;NOW MEET YOUR DOOM!!!&quot; Vulois through the \nspark with huge force right at Nemesis, hoping to make contact.\n\n(This will probably kill Eagle Eye when it touches Nemesis. You can \neither say killed by Vulois or Nemesis. It doesn&#39;t really matter.)\n\n\n"}}
