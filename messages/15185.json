But I still stand firm on what KitKat said. She \nwants to go to the Alliance. She doesn&#39;t trust these Preds. They \nworked for Hell Beast, Megatron&#39;s enemy. When she recovers she&#39;ll \nwant to leave. I see no point in going when we would just leave \nagain. But, it is still your decisioon Terrorsaur. And make it \nquickly. KitKat&#39;s life hangs in the balance.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
