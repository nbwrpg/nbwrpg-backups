He knew Maximal honor made them do wild \nthings sometimes, but this..\n\n&quot;Foolish Maximal. Do you think I am Zardus? You&#39;re mistaken. I am \nwhat you might call his &#39;clone&#39;, a copy of himself made to help \ncommand. The real Zardus is at the Iron Fist fighting off a Trainer \nattack on the base.&quot;\n\nHe shakes his head. &quot;Do you think Zardus rose to power by fighting \none on one battles? No, he rose through cunning and intelligence, \nsomething you should consider upgrading in yourself. One on one duels \nprove nothing, they are a fancy made up to please the blood. Well, \nfight amongst your own team, as you seem to enjoy doing. Disagree \nwith your leader and challenge her. Look around you, Maximal! My \ntroops are ready to destroy your base and your team at my word. Even \nif you win a duel you will succeed at nothing but your own \ndestruction. Your leader holds the only key to life for you, and that \nis a cease fire. I have bots in your base right now. Do you know how \neasy it would be for them to find the power source and destroy it? \nThe explosion would whipe out the base beyond repair, regardless of \nwho wins a few petty one on ones.&quot;\n\nHe smiles, going on with his little speach. &quot;I know why you \nchallenged me, Maximal. You believe that if you would defeat me, you \nwould prove that your way is right, and you can rise up above Iron \nRaptor as leader. You would make an excellent Predacon. Cut right out \nfor evil, perfectly. But as I have just said, your leader holds the \nonly key to your survival. If you wish to throw away the lives of \nevery single other Maximal here right now, which I believe is almost \nevery Maximal on your planet, go ahead and attack. I do not garauntee \na one on one, but I do garauntee that a cease-fire is the only way to \nlive. Make a choice, Maximal. Stand down and your team will live, or \nfight and they will all die. There are still reinforcements that can \ncome from the Alliance base at a moment&#39;s notice, and Maximal troops \nare in worse condition than Alliance. Make your choice. Obey your \nleader and let the Maximals live, or fight and condemn them to death.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Angel Prime\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he lands not to far from FZ.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;where were you Ironraptor when we needed you huh? when shocker \ndied were \n&gt; you anywhere in sight and when was the last time you actually did \nsomething \n&gt; to help the maximals? lead us to great things not to bad loss. Ohh \nyeah \n&gt; Zardus I got something for you 1 on 1 combat. if you when I agree \nto your \n&gt; terms. if  I win you all leave and give back the maximal and get to \nsee the \n&gt; look that you were deafted at your best. so do you take it? are you \na coward \n&gt; who needs other transformers to fight your battles because you are \nto weak. \n&gt; are you a true warrior. no guns just blades and fists. do you \naccept?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
