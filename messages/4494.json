Then Deemos came close and stabbed Plintissa in the back while Liono\nlaughed. Plintissa woke up when she had heard the kinds words from Iron\nRaptor. Could it be that Plintissa was important once again?\n\n&quot;Sure, anything for you, old friend.&quot; Plintissa stood up, she felt pretty\nbad, but it was time to fix the problems in her heart. Plintissa followed\nIron Raptor. Artist followed too, he secretly wanted to get in on something\nto prove he was the Maximals savior. Dracona smiled.\n\n&quot;There goes a worthy Maximal, and a somewhat worthy hero, with the squids\nbest friend. Dracona looked at Artist carefully as he left. He was Suukie,\nno doubt, but why did he change, hurting Plintissa so.\n\n&quot;Maybe I could help!&quot; Dracona called after Iron Raptor. Dracona pushed a\nbutton on a little box and had it grow bigger into a futuristic tool set.\nDracona walked off begind Iron Raptor and Plintissa with her inventions...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 24, 2000 8:08 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n\n\n\nSorry if it&#39;s long, People. I was bored and had nothing better to do.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor sighed with the feeling of Prowl&#39;s hand brushing her cheek but\nthen looked concerned again as it dropped, perhaps he was not as well as she\nhad first thought. The sight of his repair system retreat into his chest was\na relief due to the fact that it meant that he was fully healed; though she\nknew that he would be weak because of the energy used.\nIron Raptor watched his optics close and then re-open, the look of love in\nProwl&#39;s optics then made her relax and return the look.replacing the concern\nwith love.\nShe nuzzled against Prowl&#39;s hand as he then stroked her cheek again, then\nletting his hand push her lips towards his and then lock in a kiss. The\nnotification of knowing that he was strong enough to kiss her gave her more\ncomfort then anybot would ever know.\nIron Raptor raised to her feet as he did his own, ready to catch him just in\ncase he was still a little weak and couldn&#39;t walk on his own.  She heard his\nwords but knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to simply repair, the base was\nbeing attacked again but this time by the Predacons.something that needed\nher attention.\nShe walked closer to him and put a hand on his chest where his spark cavity\nwas, then sliding the hand around to his back so that she was holding him in\nan embrace. With a sigh of complete relaxation she laid her head on his\nshoulder as she held him, nice to have him in her arms again after such a\ntroubled event.\nIron Raptor closed her optics as she relaxed against him. *\n\n&quot; I can&#39;t repair, Prowl. I have too much stuff to do. But if it makes you\nfeel better I won&#39;t battle until I do.&quot;\n\n* With her other hand she then stroked his neck but then opened her optics,\nit felt good to hold him like this but it couldn&#39;t last forever. With a\nreluctant sigh she then leaned back, the thought of being apart from him\nmaking her side flair up again. Growling she then bunched the muscles in her\nside, a silent command then causing a plate to emerge and cover the damage.\nWith a smile she gave him an extra squeeze. *\n\n&quot; See? No problems.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then suddenly heard Plintissa&#39;s soft &quot;good bye&quot;, the realizing\nthat her old friend had been there. She glanced behind Prowl but couldn&#39;t\nsee Plintissa, wondering where she could have gone.\nWith a shrug she then looked back at Prowl and kissed him quickly before\ndeparting from the embrace, her hand lingering in his before letting go.\nWalking off towards the damaged quadrant of the ship she then looked over\nher shoulder but then back ahead, since she wasn&#39;t battling then she might\nas well help with the repair.and thus help Prowl.\nOn her way towards the damaged side she then heard weeping, with a cautious\napproach she then looked in to the main room of the Ark and saw Plintissa.\nWhy was she crying? But then it hit her, feeling a bit stupid of why she\ndidn&#39;t know in the first place. It was because of all the ill fortune that\nhad happened to her. Iron Raptor sighed but then smiled to herself, maybe\nshe could lighten things up a bit. *\n\n&quot; Hay! Plintissa! Why don&#39;t you come help us all repair the ship? You know?\nLend a.tenticle, or two?&quot;\n\n* She stepped closer a bit but then stopped, not sure if it had helped or\nnot. With a sigh she then shook her head and looked back towards the\nscrapped area of the ship. *\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry if I seemed mad and all before, I was just.confused. You&#39;re\nstill my friend, you know. Just rough times, that&#39;s all.&quot;\n\n* With that she then looked back at Plintissa and then towards Prowl, but\nthen began towards her intended destination. Then waving her hand towards\nher to let both of the bots know that they should follow. ( Prowl and\nPlintissa.) They had to get a move on if they were to repair the ship and\nget everything on line. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\naddress on the Net!\nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
