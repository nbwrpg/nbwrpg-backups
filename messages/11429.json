With now bots about it almost seemed as if the base was deserted, but she knew better. There were other�s around; the ship was just so big that most of them were dispersed around.\nShe sighed as she reached the Conference Room door, it opening and her walking through without slowing her pace.\nThe door closed behind her and she walked in deeper into the room, spotting Arhangle, Silverbolt and Brooder sitting about a table.\nProwl had said that they had had ideas about the Ark, something that definitely concerned her. But with Prowl gone she had her full attentions on the tasks ahead, knowing that she had a bit to catch up on.\nIron Raptor walked up to the three bots sitting at, stopping just before her hips hit its edge. She looked at each one of them in turn, her face serious but also curious. Wondering just what they wished to share with her. *\n\n� So, what was it you wanted to speak with me about?�\n\n\n* She calmly waited for them, or one of them, to answer. *\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
