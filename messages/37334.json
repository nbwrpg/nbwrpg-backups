We intercepted a suspicious Decepticon signal, decrypted it. \n&gt; We then discovered that the Decepticons had been landed on Earth \nand \n&gt; were gainging power. They were dominating the planet, and we cannot \n&gt; let any Decepticons get away with any sort of cruelty. We also \n&gt; discovered that they weren&#39;t the only ones there. There are a few \n&gt; factions who the Pred Council figured would be able to stand for a \n&gt; while before falling to the supposed Decepticon might. The Autobot \n&gt; Council has since started this project to send a ship secretly to \nthe \n&gt; planet to balance the power and, if possible, grab the Decepticon \n&gt; foot before it stretches too far around the globe. I am Sub-\nCommander \n&gt; Pacifix, and in charge of this mission (In the presence of \nIronhide, \n&gt; Pacifix is Sub-Commander). I ask you again, will you join our \ncause?&quot; \n&gt; He watches the two bots reactions impassivly.
