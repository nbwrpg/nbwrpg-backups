She was \ncommunicating with the scanner, she was moving the Protoform what \nnext telekinetic powers? Veratis noticed the DNA sequencers go online \nscanning for compatible material, they were searching long range now, \nthe rejected DNA was somehow being altered to fit the bots needs it \nwould take some time to adapt he could only hope that Lunarpine would \nreturn on time.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She tried again to raise the protoform up.  It took a lot of effort \n&gt; and energy, but she finally got the form to sit up again.  She \ntried \n&gt; to connect to the optics of the bot, to try to see.  The optics on \n&gt; the form flickered as she tried, but then they went dark.  She \n&gt; couldn&#39;t find the right connection.  She didn&#39;t want to give up \n&gt; though.  She had the bot sitting upright on the table.  She tried \nto \n&gt; move the legs, but it was proving to difficult to do too much at \n&gt; once.  She didn&#39;t feel like she was apart of this form.  More like \n&gt; just at the controls, but not inside it like her old form.   She \n&gt; stopped and just fucused on the bot sitting up.  It stayed in the \n&gt; possision.  She typed up on the screen for Veratis to read,&quot;Hey, I \n&gt; think I&#39;m getting the hang of it now.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
