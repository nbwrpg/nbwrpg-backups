She could tell that this maximal wasn&#39;t about to \ntrust her. &quot;It&#39;s not an ambush.

Your leader gows to the \ntalk and I will stay here. If anything happens to him, you may kill \nme.&quot;\nShe looked Rex dead in the eyes.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex frowns, looking at Battera. &quot;Allright, so let me get this \nstraight,&quot; he \n&gt; says, grabbing yet another fruit, &quot;A &#39;very special&#39; Pred is hosting \na peace \n&gt; meeting.
