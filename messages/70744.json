At least 3 of my soldiers will \n&gt;&gt; follow\n&gt;&gt; me or Blackout have to come here... I know that you have your orders, but\n&gt;&gt; remember that seguriy is ffirst and I refuse to take an unecesary risk&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tankor&#39;s shoulder mounted weapon began to hum as he directed power to\n&gt; it, his optics began to glow fiercly. &quot;You will comply with my orders\n&gt; or you will be terminated.&quot; Tankor said as the other drones also\n&gt; turned thier weapons on Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile the predacons with Hydras also charged thier weapons and\n&gt; faced them at the drones. Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and\n&gt; Quickstrike raised thier weapons almost in unison even as Terrorsaur,\n&gt; Waspinator diud much the same. Tarrantulus looked decidedly nervous as\n&gt; he spoke quickly into a small radio and pulled out his wwapon. Inferno\n&gt; stood before Hydras much like a lone bodyguard protecting his master.\n&gt; &quot;Come any closer and I will show you termination.&quot; he said in low\n&gt; tones to the nearest drone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;WAIT!&quot; said a voice over a loudspeaker in the chamber they were in,\n&gt; it sounded like Breakout, the security officer Hydras had spoken with\n&gt; earlier. &quot;Tankor, stand down. Hydras, I have accepted your offer,\n&gt; choose your three.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
