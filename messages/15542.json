Hmmm..Foxfingers could wait, he served no use.  Hot Rod \nwas down.  Yessss.  Excellent.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Feline, I think this is our chance to cause some real \nchaos!!!  The Maximal named Hot Rod is down.  We can reprogram him, \nand tell him that his main goal is to exterminate the one named K-9 \nand friends.  We might even be able to spread gossip that K-9 killed \nHot Rod intentionally!!  Then we&#39;ll cause chaos!!!!  So, what do you \nthink, beautiful?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
