HE stands silently and looks outside a nearby window \n&gt; and sighs thinking of Cybertron and what was happening on the \nplanet. \n&gt; He goes into a daze as he remembers the events that transpired a \n&gt; short time before his arrival... He was running... running from a \n&gt; menace unlike anything the cybertronians had faced, they were small \n&gt; robotic arachnids that were given the name replicators by their \n&gt; original creators who the Infecticons had destroyed. They \ntransported \n&gt; the things to Cybertron during a great battle between the Maximal \nand \n&gt; Predacon fleets. There they used the very metal the planet was made \n&gt; of to Replicate. Before anyone could notice there was over a \nbillion \n&gt; lurking in the depths of Cybertron. Zero recalls the sky of \ncybertron \n&gt; when the Infecticons broke through the combined Maximal and \nPredacon \n&gt; fleet... they were red with fire, all over ships of energy and \nmetal \n&gt; we slamming into buildings, and if that wasnt enough the \nReplicators \n&gt; made their presence known on the southern half of the planet and \n&gt; quickly overtook it. Zero himself was on the planets equator. Above \n&gt; him an Infecticon Marauder with several Deathgliders and Abyss&#39; \nwere \n&gt; chasing down a squadron of Maximal Blurr fighters. Before he knew \nit \n&gt; he was surrounded by Infecticon Infantry each firing plasma blasts \nat \n&gt; him and his Partner. Both bots began a mad dash for a bunker that \nhad \n&gt; been established in the city as a last defense against the \n&gt; replicators and ground troops. However before they could get there \n&gt; they were blocked off by Replicators. They both ducked into another \n&gt; alley but were faced with dead end. Zero watched helpessly as his \n&gt; friend panicked beside him and ran out of the alley only to be cut \n&gt; down by an uncountable number of blasts, the only part of him left \n&gt; was a hand. Zero Turned and activated his boosters which were \nblasted \n&gt; a sometime before hand and were severely damaged. He slowly rose \ninto \n&gt; the air when a bright flash erupted from beneath him. A portal. \n&gt; Before he knew what was happenening he was blasted from behind and \n&gt; sent barreling down into the portal. That was where his day dream \n&gt; ended.. and upon its conclusion Zero fell to his knees and clnched \n&gt; his fists in anger as he placed his ehad against the wall trying to \n&gt; supress the memory...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Arrow: I killed them.
