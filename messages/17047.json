I can understand \nthe sharing of the parent&#39;s sparks to make a whole new spark, but the \nform? I would think that it would have to be built since they are \nrobotic and machanical. Even though they have organic outsides, does \nthat mean the insides are organic too? In the G1 series, they had to \nhave Vector Sigma install life and personalities.  They had to have \nforms build and put infront of Vector Sigma.)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Of course, a transformer wouldn&#39;t turn out like a human baby. \nYou&#39;d \n&gt; probably need a blank protoform or a stolen one. Somehow I bet the \n&gt; two halves of the &quot;parental unit&#39;s&quot; genes would make the spark. \nThere \n&gt; might be more than one way to make a transformer.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike glared at Black Arachnia, his optics wide and still to \na \n&gt; speechless stare. He locked his crimson optics onto hers. She \nsounded \n&gt; pretty serious. \n&gt; \n&gt; He slowly snapped out of his stunned stare and blinked. Deep down, \nhe \n&gt; was spooked. But the fact of her pregnant may have saved her life. \n&gt; \n&gt; He lightly nodded to her and put his cobra hand over her back. He \n&gt; looked at Hell Beast&#39;s direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What are we gonna do wit&#39; him?&quot; He frowned. &quot;Ah wanna kill &#39;im.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
