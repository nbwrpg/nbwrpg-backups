She drew her \ngun and fired at close range at Airbomber, aiming for his head.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron roared in absolute anger as Airbomber began to shoot \nup his \n&gt; already messed up lair. He stomped forward and wrapped his tail \ngun&#39;s claw \n&gt; around his neck and pulled him close.\n&gt;     &quot;You will regreat ever wakeing up!&quot; Megatron hissed, letting a \nfew \n&gt; spitlets hits his face. He squeezed harder, sinking the ridges of \nhis claw \n&gt; deeper into Airbombers throat. With two glareing optics, he looked \nto Kitkat \n&gt; to finish the intruder off. \n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis looked to his commander and apologised. &quot;Forgive me, \nSir. Shes \n&gt; in the bunker but said to call her on your comm. Is there anything \nelse I can \n&gt; do for you?&quot; He said to Quickstrike, saluting.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tarantulas was puzzled over the strange writings of the aliens \nthat were \n&gt; scattered about, dead and rotting. The Triangle room was indeed the \n&gt; Operations Center of the bunker. It was complete with computers, \n&gt; Communications devices, and an odd kind of screen. \n&gt;     He tried another set of decodeing programs, but to no avail. \nThe language \n&gt; of the aliens was very complicated. It made the Vok&#39;s language look \nlike a \n&gt; walk in the park. Fustrated he slammed down his claw on the table.\n&gt;     The spider hissed, &quot;OH! These aliens are very crafty! But I \nhave another \n&gt; card up my sleeve......&quot; He then reached for one of Hell Beast&#39;s \ndisks. The \n&gt; one that had told them where this place was might tell them \nsomething about \n&gt; this language. \n&gt;     He put the disk in and the odd runes on the screen suddenly \nbegan to \n&gt; change into Predaconese. He could completely understand it now. \nHell Beast \n&gt; must have decoded them.....\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, excellent. Now to find out what happened here, and why.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia pushed open one of the sealed doors, now open of \ncourse. The room \n&gt; was warm, and dark. She changed her optics into Nightvision and \nentered.\n&gt;     In the center of the room was a large cylider like object. She \nguessed it \n&gt; was the powersource for something.....but what? As she got closer \nshe saw the \n&gt; control panel, but didnt understand a word on it. \n&gt;     She turned a left. This room was a mystery, but as soon as \nTarantulas \n&gt; decoded the runes, she would unlock this mysterious puzzle.\n\n\n"}}
