He debates quickly about\nfiring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Element (S) then realizes the futility of the matter.\n&gt; &gt; He &gt; decides on a closer, smaller, easier to destroy target,\n&gt; &gt; Cliffjumper. &gt; He owed the bot anyways.

He &gt; sneaks over to the battling bot, and\n&gt; &gt; attaches an unarmed charge to &gt; his back, in an easy to reach\nspot. He\n&gt; &gt; quickly leaps back to avoid &gt; gettin noticed, besides by Fireblade\nwho\n&gt; &gt; can see him anyway.
