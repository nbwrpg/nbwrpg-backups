But there was something about \nher that drew his attention, that just made him want to know more \nabout this strange place and her included. But all in good time.\nD shifted his weight from paw to paw, looking towards the Iron Fist \nas Fenox pointed towards it.\nSo that was called the Alliance Base? Interesting name.\nHe focused back on the woman ahead of him, shifting again and feeling \nhis muscles move under his skin.*\n\n&quot; Alliance here...&quot;\n\n* He gestured towards ground.*\n\n&quot; Iron Fist there...&quot;\n\n* Then gestured towards the ship. In his mind, the Alliance was the \nground which the Iron Fist stood on. But he could be mistaken.\nD move out away from Fenox a bit, his head slightly lowered towards \nthe ground, his shoulders moving and expressing just what sort of \nProwl his creators had leashed inside of thos being.\nD may seem like he knew nothing but it turned out that he knew more \nthen anyone could know, but not of this world.\nHe began to move off towards the Iron Fist, wanting a closer look at \nit but not quite sure if it was safe.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
