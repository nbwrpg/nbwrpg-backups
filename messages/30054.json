She had the DNA \ncollector on \n&gt; her side, just in case.  She spotted three animals and transformed \ninto \n&gt; leopard mode.  She ran and caught two of them.  Grabbing the DNA \ncollector, \n&gt; she retrieved the samples as ordered and went back to her \nbike. &quot;Hmmm, I \n&gt; wonder what the commander had in store for these samples.
