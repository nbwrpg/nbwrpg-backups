And as a relative of Optimus \n&gt;&gt; Prime, I too, am ready to embrace the vows he once took upon recieving \n&gt;&gt; the Matrix of Leadership. I&#39;m ready Matrix, I&#39;M READY TO LIGHT OUR \n&gt;&gt; DARKEST HOUR!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as Tuscon finished speaking the door from the interior of the Ark\n&gt; opened as Lord Elder came through.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time a voice could clearly be heard speaking to Tuscon,\n&gt; �Boldness may be needed.�\n&gt;\n&gt; Another voice spoke, �A darkness is coming, when the light of all of\n&gt; us maybe needed.�\n&gt;\n&gt; As the voices spoke, there was a click, then a rumble as Optimus\n&gt; Prime�s chest plate split down the middle and then slowly opened. From\n&gt; inside a light blazed out, and the sphere that was the matrix rose up\n&gt; in a sea of blue white light that spread out and filled the entire\n&gt; chamber, lighting the room like a miniature star.\n&gt;\n&gt; �Arise, Tuscon!� came another voice, this one sounding much like Optimus \n&gt; Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; The matrix positioned itself above the fallen leader of the Autobots\n&gt; as if observing the room for a moment. Then it oriented on Tuscon.\n&gt;\n&gt; �We cannot give you the matrix itself, but the power that we have we\n&gt; bequeath to you.�\n&gt;\n&gt; From the center of the Matrix a beam of pure energy lanced out and\n&gt; struck Tuscon, bathing him in a nimbus of coruscating light and power,\n&gt; changing him, enhancing him, filling him with the energy and wisdom\n&gt; that was the Autobots.\n&gt;\n&gt; �We have given you the embers Tuscon, and its power has changed you.\n&gt; However to light our darkest hour you must ignite the flames of that\n&gt; which have gone out.�\n&gt;\n&gt; With those words the ball dimmed as it slowly dropped into Optimus\n&gt; Prime�s chest. With a click the matrix settled back into place as\n&gt; Optimus� chest cavity and slowly the plates slid shut, and the room\n&gt; returned to its dark hue.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Tuscon Prime has arrived!!!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
