He could approach what seemed to be\n&gt; GRIMLOCK coming along with whatever else, and announce his presence.  But\n&gt; this would risk that GRIMLOCK was not in his right frame of processor, that\n&gt; his friend had been reprogrammed or otherwise was with PREDACONS or other\n&gt; escorts who would be hostile to him anyways.  And yet if he hid and GRIMLOCK\n&gt; noticed him, any chance he had of approaching in friendship would be\n&gt; nullified if he took hostile actions, and by the DINOBOT standards,\n&gt; stretched as they were by whatever had made them attack other MAXIMALS as he\n&gt; had been told..\n&gt;\n&gt; Steeling himself, WHEELIE decided that the least he could do was put himself\n&gt; at risk in the same way the DINOBOTS had always done so for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Putting a &#39;dead&#39; charge in his slingshot, and firing it up and into the sky\n&gt; over like a flare to announce his presence then, the charge empty of energy\n&gt; and only visible in teht hick fauna for a few hundred meters, and with no\n&gt; pulse of power to signify as an attack..\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking out then, holding his weapon at half mast then to show he did not\n&gt; mean any hostiles, he called out&lt; &quot;Me Wheelie meet Him Grimlock.  Me Wheelie\n&gt; remember and call him Grimlock Friend.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nEven as WHEELIE was stepping out into a clearing of sorts to\n&#39;confront&#39; GRIMLOCK the trees and brush were already parting. However\nwhat came through them was not GRIMLOCK, but it was another smaller\nflier moving with great agility through the trees, most of the time\njust under the thicker canopy where the tree limbs spread out.\n\nThe flier looked much like SWOOP or the others who had just flown off,\nbut he was predominantly red and grey.\n\nWith almost unbelievable nimbleness he flipped around WHEELIE and then\nconverted quickly into robot mode, &quot;Run!&quot; He said quickly his optics\nquickly going to WHEELIE&#39;s faction symbols for a moment. &quot;Grimlock is\nalmost here!&quot;\n\nIn the meantime the sound of GRIMLOCK could still be heard\napproaching! &quot;Me Grimlock hear pesky TERRANOTRON! Me Grimlock crush!&quot;\nHe was about to burst through the brush much as TERRANOTRON had just\ndone!\n\nBehind GRIMLOCK, further back by the sound of it, were other roars,\nSLAG, SNARL and SLUDGE presumably.\n\nTERRANOTRON looked ready to dart off in the direction of the &#39;bridge&#39;\nthat SWOOP and the others had made.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
