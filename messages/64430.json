Only a few dozen workers\nlived there, and most of them worked for the New Source Company, a\nprospection agency that tried to discover new energon veins. It was\nnot very important, but it was profitable enough for the company to\ncontinue developping it.\n\nThe evening shift was just finishing and a group of miners was coming\nout of the mine, telling raunchy jokes and laughing.\n\nIt all happened suddenly. The bombardment alert came on, and someone\nfrantically warned about a meteor shower falling down, warning the\nPentatron office at the same time. The bots scrambled, trying to get\nto cover, but it was too late.\n\nMeteors were falling like a hailstorm. Most of the bots were crippled,\nand one even received a burning crystal rock in the back, a massive\ncrystal jutting out of his chest. Then, a huge one fell, entered the\nmine and created a huge energon-boosted explosion. The\nmeteor-traversed worker turned around, and saw a rolling fire wave. He\nsaw the sparks of his comrades leaving them, yet his did not go. Why?\nThe fire engulfed him, then formed a vortex all around him. The sparks\nwhirled down the spiral and lodged themselves in his crystal. He was\nlosing himself, yet becoming something else.\n\nWho was he?\n\nAn answer came.\n\nWyldfire.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
