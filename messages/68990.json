I am having to\n&gt; squeeze in probably several weeks=\r\n of battling back and forth into \none\n&gt; post, so for me it feels really rus=\r\nhed. But hopefully it will have\n&gt; good results :)\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: \n&gt; \n&gt; The skies=\r\n crackled around Decibel and the sweeps that were with her,\n&gt; like a storm =\r\nbrewing and exploding across the skies! Weapons fire\n&gt; spewed out from her =\r\nand the sweeps, forcing Hydras and his team to\n&gt; back up slightly. With the=\r\n full force of her team of sweeps, \nDecibel&#39;s\n&gt; fire power rains down on th=\r\ne trio of Hydras, Perceptor and \nDarkhawk. \n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor finds it difficu=\r\nlt to actually target the sweeps directly \nas\n&gt; their sensor-scattering arm=\r\nor makes them appear like ghosts to him,\n&gt; visible only as they fire, and t=\r\nhen disappearing again. \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, somewhere in the midst of the batt=\r\nle Myrmidon holds off \nthe\n&gt; sweeps that come at him, even as his self repa=\r\nir circuits quickly\n&gt; bring him to a battle ready status! \n&gt; \n&gt; Jhiaxus sli=\r\nps through the skies, his sturdy armor repelling all but\n&gt; the strongest hi=\r\nts from the sweeps, and yet those few strikes are\n&gt; beginning to tell on hi=\r\nm as his armor is becoming slowly whittled\n&gt; away. With the loss of Tumult =\r\nas a target he once again takes aim at\n&gt; the sweeps and begins the long and=\r\n tedious process of taking them \nout\n&gt; of the skies a few at a time. He is =\r\nremarkably effective at this, \neven\n&gt; if it does draw the attention of the =\r\nsweeps to him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Below Scorponok holds his own, using his massive firep=\r\nower to strike\n&gt; in several different directions at once: fusion cannons, l=\r\naser\n&gt; batteries and his impressive physical strength all work their power =\r\n\non\n&gt; the sweeps that harry him like hyenas on some massive black bear!\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Shard&#39;s weaponry against the sweeps works well as several of them\n&gt; explo=\r\nde in spectacular displays of fire, smoke and debris that\n&gt; scatters across=\r\n the landscape. However even as he destroys several, \nit\n&gt; seems that this =\r\narmy is never ending as more and more come to fill \nthe\n&gt; places of their f=\r\nallen brethren.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock and Lord Elder find themselves hard pressed t=\r\no stand firm\n&gt; against the onslaught of the sweeps. Their numbers seem almo=\r\nst\n&gt; overwhelming, even with the help of the shuttle. Without the ark, \nand=\r\n\n&gt; with Kup disappearing into the confines of that large black sphere\n&gt; tha=\r\nt covers the ark, there is little that they can do but attempt to\n&gt; hold th=\r\ne lines against what would seem to be an unrelenting foe!\n&gt; \n&gt; As they sett=\r\nle in to hold their line, firing their weapons with\n&gt; seeming abandon they =\r\nrealize it is not just against the sweep they\n&gt; fight. Power and energy cra=\r\nckle once again as the power of Scourge,\n&gt; Cyclonus&#39; powerful and cagy seco=\r\nnd in command makes itself felt\n&gt; against their defenses!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, i=\r\nnside that sphere of blackness around the Ark Kup and\n&gt; Legacy are harried =\r\nby the machine that floats in the air. It fires\n&gt; swiftly and then dodges w=\r\nith a grace the seekers of old would have\n&gt; envied. Savage strikes hit the =\r\nground and the area around Legacy and\n&gt; Kup but they are ready to defend th=\r\ne Ark with their sparks if \nnecessary. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus and Cyclonus on the ot=\r\nher hand seem oblivious to everything\n&gt; but their battle and each other! Ro=\r\ndimus, the once leader of the\n&gt; Autobots and ex-holder of the Matrix agains=\r\nt Cyclonus, once second \nin\n&gt; command of the decepticons, now Unicron heral=\r\nd and new bearer of the\n&gt; now corrupted matrix - stand pitted against each =\r\nother in a seeming\n&gt; battle to the death!\n&gt; \n&gt; Blows and strikes fly throug=\r\nh the air; as they move swiftly through \na\n&gt; dance of hits and feints, fist=\r\ns and laser cannons! Strike, hit =96 \nhit,\n&gt; dodge, the sound of unrelentin=\r\ng metal striking unyielding armor \nrings\n&gt; out over their small battle fiel=\r\nd, and neither Cyclonus nor Rodimus\n&gt; shows signs of falling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet one =\r\nmust!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus takes one hit, and then another as Cyclonus opens up wha=\r\nt is\n&gt; possibly one of the most powerful weapons in his arsenal =96 his ble=\r\ned\n&gt; back receptors. With a look almost of sorrow Cyclonus begins turning\n&gt;=\r\n the very fury of Rodimus&#39; weapons against him. His punches, kicks \nand\n&gt; f=\r\nirepower seem to have little effect on Cyclonus as his palms glow \nand\n&gt; th=\r\ne very power aimed at him is redirected and channeled against \ntheir\n&gt; crea=\r\ntor: Rodimus!\n&gt; \n&gt; Falling to one knee Rodimus looks at Cyclonus a smile sp=\r\nreading \nitself\n&gt; across his cracked and pitted face. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You smile Rodi=\r\nmus? You have been beaten. You cannot stand against \nme&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus slowed,=\r\n wary at this new tactic of his opponent. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have not lost at all!&quot; R=\r\nodimus snarled. As he struggled slowly to\n&gt; his feet Rodimus&#39; optics begin =\r\nto glow as he gathers himself for one\n&gt; last assault. &quot;It is you that has b=\r\neen defeated, by your own pride \nand\n&gt; power!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As if with an indrawn b=\r\nreath Rodimus fires an optic beam at \nCyclonus -\n&gt; however instead of being=\r\n its typical yellow or red it is black with\n&gt; tendrils of yellow running th=\r\nrough it. It is not a laser, but\n&gt; something else. \n&gt; \n&gt; Reflexively Cyclon=\r\nus reached up to block it and yet he was still\n&gt; caught by it. It was not a=\r\nn attack, but instead it was a \ntransmission!\n&gt; The very same code that was=\r\n used to break down Rodimus&#39; own\n&gt; personality a few days ago, it is this s=\r\name virus that Cyclonus \nhas =96\n&gt; by the power of his Bleedback receptors =\r\n=96 allowed in to infect his\n&gt; systems, almost without resistance. \n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne effect on Cyclonus was immediate as his arms dropped to his \nsides\n&gt; as h=\r\ne and Rodimus locked gazes! Around them the sweeps seemed to\n&gt; almost pause=\r\n as they could feel the infection spreading through \ntheir\n&gt; leader. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;NO!&quot; a scream ripped out, not from Cyclonus but from Scourge as he\n&gt; too c=\r\nould feel the bond that held he and Cyclonus together being\n&gt; ripped from h=\r\nis being! With a burst of energy he and several sweeps\n&gt; tore through the b=\r\nattle lines, leaving their battle with Lord Elder\n&gt; and Grimlock, as they f=\r\nlew to Cyclonus&#39; side - even as the minion\n&gt; commander fell to his knees an=\r\nd slumped over!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;YOU!&quot; Scourge raged at Rodimus, &quot;You will die for thi=\r\ns!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus merely smiled as he too fell to the ground, his own wounds=\r\n \nand\n&gt; the depletions of his own reserves claiming his consciousness. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Growling Scourge stepped over to his leader&#39;s fallen body as his\n&gt; sensor=\r\ns pickup the faintest readings of life. Bending to one knee\n&gt; Scourge looke=\r\nd down at Cyclonus, &quot;Leader, you will live!&quot; a small\n&gt; smile traced itself =\r\nacross his face as he tried to pull Cyclonus \nup. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus turned to =\r\nface Scourge, his optics not the purple hue of\n&gt; command but black and male=\r\nvolent. With a viciousness they spewed out\n&gt; energy, much as Rodimus had fi=\r\nred, its power less then it was, but\n&gt; still potent. &quot;No!&quot; Scourge screamed=\r\n out as he fell over, his \nsystems\n&gt; shutting down. \n&gt; \n&gt; Around them the b=\r\nattle raged, but without Cyclonus or Scourge to \nlead\n&gt; it, the battle quic=\r\nkly became a route as the sweeps fell before the\n&gt; combined forces of Lord =\r\nElder and the Maximals as well as Hydras and\n&gt; the forces he led. \n&gt; \n&gt; Qui=\r\nckly the scene of the battle quiets leaving only the fallen\n&gt; Cyclonus, Sco=\r\nurge and Rodimus at its core, the rest having either \nbeen\n&gt; destroyed or f=\r\nled!  Even the black sphere that was over the ark has\n&gt; vanished, leaving o=\r\nnly a black scortched earth around it, and a\n&gt; harried yet not quite defeat=\r\ned Legacy and Kup, standing ready to\n&gt; defend the ark against a foe that is=\r\n now fled!\n&gt; \n&gt; The battle is over!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
