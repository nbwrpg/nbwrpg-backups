(See there can be more appropriate \nphrases instead of vulgarity.) What&#39;s the ships condition?&quot;\n\nThe ship replied &quot;Power to all systems fadeing, shields will be down \nwith the next hit if appropriate measures are not taken.&quot; The \ncondition of the ship was already beat up from the last battle, now \nit was hanging together by a paperclip and a wad of chewing gum.\n\nHe hated to admit it but he had to lower the shields range. &quot;Decrease \nshield range to surround the ship, cut power to weapons and rerout to \nthe engines.&quot; His actions would either fly them to safety or tear \nthem all to ribbons.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Decadel::\n&gt; \n&gt;       Decadel saw Deemos crawl away and the rest of em go to the \nMaximal\n&gt; base.
