So \nI&#39;m going to make to bad apples. This is the first one. It brings up \nthe question of: What did they do with the second blank after reviving \nOptimus Primal.\n\nAfter all this time the blank protoform still sits there where the \nMaximals have left it.  Finally, something clicks and the scanners go \nonline. It takes a lizard beast mode. Then from deep in the pit a dark \nforce, the Inferno himself arises to claim the body. A new spark forms \nin it, Pure Black. Then the Maximal chip starts to work. The power of \nthe Inferno overrides it, but not totally. The spark turns blood red. \nA new bot arises. He is engulfed in flame. He turns into a fairly \nhandsome, red eyed, muscular bot, of pure evil. He can sense others \nwith black hearts on this planet. Soon he will have servents to obey \nhis every wim.  He walks a few feet and stops.\n\nBot: SHADOW STAR, BLACK DRAGON MODE!\n\nHis size increases from 10 ft. to 20 ft. as he turns into a dragon \n(o.k. I confesse I&#39;m sorta coping Cyberwolf). He flys toward a dark \nforce.\n\nOOC: We need to get a few things worked out for this one. For starters \neven if he gets servants I don&#39;t want the chars. Next, if some chars \nagree to serve him will he be allowed to alter their beast modes like \nwith himself (if you say yes their owners could decide how and \nnaturally they&#39;d change back if they broke up with him), and I can \nassume more servants means he&#39;s more powerful, and by the way is there \na spot open in the Pack it&#39;s hard enough to form one Faction he&#39;ll \njust try to take over the Pack one by one, oh and I don&#39;t think Kitkat \nor Drillbit would like him becaus he has a girl problem (as in rapist) \nbut might take the guise of controllability.\n\n\n"}}
