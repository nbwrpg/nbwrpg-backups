Michael had been having a \nlot of social problems in the last few weeks, and I&#39;m sad to say that \nabout 2 weeks ago my brother took his own life. He overdosed on a \ndrug. I won&#39;t say which one. He left a message for all of view. He \nwanted to thank you for being his friends, because he would have done \nthis awhile go without you. He wants to which The Council weel, and \nhis friends Kingler, Logo, Alloran and Soulstice to remember him. \nThough he said not to weep for him, just remember him. I didn&#39;t join \nhis club to RPG, just to let you know my brother has finally reached \npeace in his soul. Thank You.\n\n\n"}}
