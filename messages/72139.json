A dot representing NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s signature i=\r\ns shown to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; inside the ark, and then flying out of it, and =\r\ntravelling some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; distance. Her signature landing nearly 100 mi=\r\nles away in a loney&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; isolated area.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &quot;What is Nightlight doing out there?&quot; LORD ELDER said, obviously not&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; aware of what has been happening.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nORCA looked similarly confused.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEO held up hi=\r\ns hand, &quot;Just a moment.&quot; He said as he looked at LEGACY,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Spe=\r\ned us up until we come to the present or until something happens.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY nodded and the scene sped up and then slowed dow=\r\nn again as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; something like RODIMUS PRIME showed up on the scre=\r\nen, or atleast an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; energy signature that looked much like his.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the screen the small dot that represented =\r\nRODIMUS approached the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; dot that represented NIGHTLIGHT. They =\r\ninteracted for a moment and then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; they both vanished.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A teleoprtation device?&quot; TORCA said as he looked at t=\r\nhe screen.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY peered at his console. &quot;Perh=\r\naps.&quot; he siad in his typical cold&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; voice. &quot;The signature at th=\r\neir disappearance resembled a space bridge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; signature but on a=\r\n much smaller scale and there were differences in it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; as well.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; TORCA grunted, &quot;And that was probrably that =\r\nDark Rodimus again.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEO PRIME nodded to TORCA=\r\n and then looked around the room.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Suggestions on how to find=\r\n Nightlight now?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-9-110619499--\r\n\n"}}
