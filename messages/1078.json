I\n&gt; must&#39;ve missed it, sorry!)\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron growled at Sinesis, the pain in her stomach had increased, but\nnot\n&gt; by much.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Dinobot?! What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; Tavatron knew something was definitely wrong\nthis\n&gt; time. Dinobot didn&#39;t just drop his weapon, something had to be seriously\n&gt; wrong. Tavatron fired her optic lasers at Sinesis&#39; chest. She unshesthed\nher\n&gt; staff and held it in a fighting stance.\n&gt;\n&gt; She knew Dinobot was trying to protect her, and she appreciated it, she\n&gt; really did. No one had ever cared enough about her to risk their own\nwelfare\n&gt; in exchange for her safety. It was... nice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron snarled at Sinesis and fired her optic lasers at him multiple\n&gt; times.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/10/_/_/_/957660473/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
