I&#39;m sorry to have dissapeared for a long time. My life \nfell apart pretty fast and i didn&#39;t have time for the internet. but things \nhave quieted down now and I have some time on the internet. I had yan fill \nme in on things, so I think i know whats going on. I won&#39;t be taking any \ncharacters that I left behind when i dissapeared, but i&#39;ll be bringing in \nsome new ones. i took some writing classes when i could, so my writing \nshould be better, but its hard to go to school when youre in my situation, \nso please don&#39;t be mad if its bad. i still have very little time, so yan can \npost for me if i dissapear suddenly. I&#39;ll try to inform him so that he knows \nwhen to take over, but if you see him posting with my chars, its ok.\n\nThe only people I still reconize are Yan, JP, and KSLawdogg (all meanies)!  \noh yeah, and yan gave me permission to copy his idea of the galators (sp?), \nso no one get mad at me for it! :)\n\nMy post:\n\nCinder, Aqua, Mist, Rubble, and Mantle were in a ship heading for earth. \nThey were originaly part of the same team that Prowl (yan gave me permission \n:) came to earth with, but had been seperated while out on a mission. When \nthey were coming back to Striker&#39;s ship, they saw it enter a transwarp \nportal, and followed. They overshot and ended up in the future, after \nStriker&#39;s crew had landed, but their hopes were high anyways.\n\nCinder sighed, looking out the small viewport of the hall at the slowly \noncoming little blue pretty planet. The Eletors, which was the name of the \ngroup that consisted of Cinder and her sibblings, were a new breed of \nMaximals. They were made after the maximals reached the same level of \nfighting technology that the predacons had used to make the galators. After \nthey were tested for bugs and any bugs that had been found were fixed, they \nwere assigned to Striker&#39;s team. They went on many missions together, but \nthe latest one had taken them far from Striker&#39;s ship, and that was why they \nwere now following them and hoping that there were survivors. Cinder heard \nfootsteps behind her, knowing that it was one of her sibblings checking on \nher. She knew they were worried, and she couldn&#39;t blame them, but she \ncouldn&#39;t help but worry about the condition of her friends on earth.\n\n&quot;Do you think he&#39;s still alive?&quot; she asked the bot that approached behind \nher. Her voice was as worried as her thoughts, and she kinda felt sorry for \nworrying her brothers and sisters.\n\n&quot;Us Maximals are survivors, Cinder,&quot; a male voice replied to her question. \nShe knew that he knew who she was talking about. &quot;He&#39;ll be ok. We couldn&#39;t \nhave overshot by more than a year, and they could easily survive that long.\n\nCinder looked back at her brother Aqua, her eyes a bit wet from worrying. \nShe had a sleek, well shaped body with two red stripes going up her sides \nand an orange one down her middle and back. Her hair was crimson colored. \nThe ship had scanned the planet and detected energon a little whiles away, \ngiving the Eletors beast modes to suit earth. Cinder had a long, bushy fox \ntail swinging slowly back and forth from her rear. &quot;I hope you&#39;re right, \nbrother. I hope we&#39;re not too late.&quot;\n\nAqua walked up and hugged his sister. He was colored different shades of \nblue. His beast mode, a blend of a dolphin and a shark, contributed to his \ncompassionate attitude and his excellent fighting skills. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, \nthey&#39;re allright,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Do you want something to eat? Everyone is \nat the mess hall. You can take your mind off of the situation for the \nmatter.&quot;\n\nCinder nodded, returning Aqua&#39;s hug greatfully. She walked with him through \nthe ship back toward the mess hall. They entered and walked to the main \ntable, where the rest of the team was seated. Cinder looked around at her \nother brothers and sisters, managing a smile for them. She sat down on the \nchair that Aqua pulled out for her, and then watched him sit down near her. \nAqua was the closest to her of all her family, probably closest to everyone \nelse too. He always cared for people&#39;s feelings.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re almost in range to make a complete scan of the planet for any \ntransformers,&quot; Mantle, the bot in charge of the group, said. He was \nofficially the bot in charge but the eletors were more like a family, with \nMantle acting a bit as the father, Mist as the mother, and the rest of them \nas kids. Mantle was created first of eletors, then Mist, Rubble, Aqua, and \nfinally Cinder. Being the youngest, Cinder was usually pampered, and she \nhated it. She never got to do anything fun! But right now everyone was \nlooking at her to see how she felt about this, as usual concerned with her \nstate of mind. They all knew why she was worried about the state of the bots \non the planet, although she wished they didn&#39;t know. She nodded, looking \ndown at her food and picking at it.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be ok.&quot; Mist leaned over and patted Cinder on the \nshoulder, trying to confort her. Mist was almost as attractive as Cinder, \nalthough she was slightly older and wiser, and less entusiastic about \nthings. Her body was a very light blue, lighter than Aqua&#39;s. Mist was \ncompassionate to all her friends, not to the point that Aqua was, but still \nvery compassionate. She hugged Cinder and then went back to her food, \nglaring at Rubble for a second when Rubble burped loudly.\n\n&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rubble mumbled, going back to his food. He was a big, strong bot, \nhis coloring ranging from grey to brown. Even though he was male to the \ncore, he cared very much for his family, and would give his life for any of \nthem. In a few minutes, Mantle stood up.\n\n&quot;Ok, everyone, let&#39;s get the scan going,&quot; he said and walked out of the \nroom. As he left he motioned for the rest to follow. Cinder and her family \nstood up, following him toward the control room.\n\n\n\n- Jen D :)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
