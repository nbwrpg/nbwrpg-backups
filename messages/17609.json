She smiled and chuckled. &quot;Yeah, call me \nnames, but your dead.&quot;  She looked around at her allies. &quot;HE&quot;S DEAD! \nMEGATRON IS DEAD!&quot;\n\nThen a thought crossed her mind. Megatron was way to easy to kill. \nSomething was wrong, but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. She \nmuttered to herself,&quot;that was too easy.  He should have been more of \na challenge to destroy like that.&quot;\n\nShe looked around for Drillbit, &quot;Check your scanners.  See if there \nare are any more of Megatron&#39;s friends about.&quot;\n\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe looked at Inferno. &quot;By the Matrix! What are you doing here? You \nlook upset. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Inferno fell to the ground with his face scourged by the fumes \nof Star \n&gt; Scream. He got up and looked over, the last of the clones fell to \nthr ground. \n&gt; He was all that was left. Taking out his gun he made a tactical \nwithdrawl \n&gt; until he saw Megatron, the clone.\n&gt;     &quot;Royalty! You have come for me! Together we shall destroy these \n&gt; invaders!&quot; He cried with enthusiasm. He began to run towrds \nMegatron, but \n&gt; stopped as a grenade landed right between his feet. &quot;Royalty! Look \nout!&quot;\n&gt;     The clone looked down at the grenade, cried out, and blew to \nscrap before \n&gt; the ees of Inferno. His head landed on the ground and rolled over \nto \n&gt; Kitkat....&quot;You......little.....bitch.....&quot;It said with its last \nounce of \n&gt; energy, and then died. The head blanked out, a rather perfect \ntrophy.\n&gt;     &quot;No! The Queen! .....You shall pay for this!&quot; Inferno cried, \ntook to the \n&gt; sky, and went as fast as he could fly. He saw a small being beneath \nhim in \n&gt; the forest and went down. Apon landing he saw it was Darkmouse...a \nfimiliar \n&gt; face.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Excellent. Everything is going to plan. When Inferno arrives, \nand \n&gt; Terrorsaur, we can begin phase two. Hahahahahahah!&quot; He bellowed \nsitting on \n&gt; his Command Chair.\n&gt;     &quot;Your a freak!&quot; Adrax cried, who now resided within a steal \ncage \n&gt; suspended above a pit that was rather deep. He dangled back and \nforth.\n&gt;     Megatron turned, &quot;Silence! Your only alive because you know the \naccess \n&gt; codes. Now shut up!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
