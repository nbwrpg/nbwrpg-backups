Speaking of him did Winged Warrior ever\n&gt; respond to my last post for him?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; All right in response to the new powers of Empath,\n&gt; &gt; the council has felt it \n&gt; &gt; necessary to regulate telepathy for the first time. \n&gt; &gt; (And before you get \n&gt; &gt; offended Cardhead, no we&#39;re not concerned about you\n&gt; &gt; abusing these powers. \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s people with less self control making similar\n&gt; &gt; characters and abusing \n&gt; &gt; these powers that we&#39;re worried about.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Telepathy requires a great deal of energon and\n&gt; &gt; thus may not be used \n&gt; &gt; repeatedly or for very long. i.e. you may not\n&gt; &gt; paralyze multiple bots at once \n&gt; &gt; or keep one paralyzed for an indefinite amount of\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Telepathy may not be used very often.  i.e. you\n&gt; &gt; may not paralyze a bot \n&gt; &gt; then move on to another bot without recharging for a\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) No direct harm of another bot without expressed\n&gt; &gt; consent.  Someone on the \n&gt; &gt; council must receive a notice from the victim sent\n&gt; &gt; before the post where said \n&gt; &gt; harm is to occur.  Note: This does not apply if you\n&gt; &gt; are harming another of \n&gt; &gt; your characters.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Whomever shall use telepathy to paralyze must\n&gt; &gt; accept any reasonable \n&gt; &gt; attempt to escape said telepathy.  Note:  &quot;He was\n&gt; &gt; paralyzed but shook it \n&gt; &gt; off.&quot; is not a reasonable attempt.  Put some thought\n&gt; &gt; into it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) ANY new telepaths with the ability to influence\n&gt; &gt; others through their \n&gt; &gt; thoughts must be approved by the council.  This\n&gt; &gt; includes any upgraded by Soul \n&gt; &gt; Orbs.  There must be a plausible reason for them to\n&gt; &gt; have this kind of power \n&gt; &gt; before they will be approved.  (Soul Orbs are one\n&gt; &gt; such reason.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your time.  Any questions, comments,\n&gt; &gt; complaints, concerns, \n&gt; &gt; insults, etc., should be addressed to the council\n&gt; &gt; not the group as a whole.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
