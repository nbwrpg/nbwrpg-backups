YOU ARE BACK!!! I MISSED YOU SOO MUCH!!&quot;said a childish voice,\n&gt; Nightlight Huged tightly her daughter and and tears of happines started to \n&gt; appear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My Elita... My sweet daughter...&quot;whispered Nighlight with a smile\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I was really Impattient to see you mom; I really... Really missed you&quot; \n&gt; said\n&gt; ELita with a wide Smile &quot;But my dad and Perceptor...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;WHAT????&quot; said shocked Nighlight while she watched Rodimus\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oppssi&quot; said Elita while she lowed her ears\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS had been smiling broadly as ELITA and NIGHTLIGHT were being\nreunited. He had even leaned back a little to allow the two to hug and\nshow affection. That is until ELITA�s last statement and he could see\nthe look on NIGHTLIGHT�s face.\n\nSmiling warmly and nodding RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT�s hand. �Yes,\nPerceptor has been instrumental in your recovery.� Leaning back in he\ncontinued to smile at her, hoping to wipe away her fears if he could.\n\n�From what we can tell, Perceptor has joined the Maximals.� RODIMUS\nrubbed ELITA�s head giving her reassurance and affection as well.\n�Just like our daughter here has said.�\n\n******************************************\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor walked close to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; highly unlikely that that happens &quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, as he observes the private code\n&gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess Tucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; Nightlight.  I wonder if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; some day?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nELDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. If he\nwere human it might even seem like a blush. �Who can say Uproar, who\ncan say? I would imagine that that is something that we may all want\nto do at some point.�\n\nTORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large forms\nswaying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heavy\nas their metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n\n�We still must talk.� TORCA said looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\nresigned. NOCTORRO was tapping out a small message as they talked, but\nhe looked up and nodded in agreement as well.\n\nELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. �Uproar,\nwhy don�t you show Perceptor around the base and help him get settled\nin, I would imagine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\nrecharging chamber coded to his requirements.�\n\n******************************************\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thinks for a moment before\n&gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  Once she had an idea of\n&gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, with an air of sincerity \n&gt; she\n&gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted ta \n&gt; let\n&gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you&#39;re\n&gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  He&#39;s\n&gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a \n&gt; defense\n&gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe that&#39;s \n&gt; why\n&gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, at times.\n&gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside the box?  Is \n&gt; there\n&gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor a moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\ninto STRAIGHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n\n�I do not understand all of the colloquialisms than you have\nutilized.� He said at last, �But I ascertain that you are attempting\nto explain your sibling�s actions to me and inquiring as to why I will\nnot allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime�s chassis.�\n\nLEGACY�s optic flickered for a moment. �I appreciate your intent.� He\nsaid his words clear and well articulated. �But I do not require an\nexplanation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do so\nwould be an inefficient use of my time.�\n\n�However to answer your question I will replay something for you.�\n\nTurning to the screen that was standing behind LEGACY he fired a beam\nof energy at it. But instead of it exploding into shards of glass and\ndebris it simply changed to show a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\nthen the volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It was obvious from the\nmotion that the events were being speeded up for ease of viewing.\n\nSoon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up from the\nArk and began to travel away from it and after a while return. After\nanother short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\nMEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\nDecepticon seekers, obviously having been repaired by the device. They\nall land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\nblast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n\nInside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\nalso is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n\n(OOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\ncons fell to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n\nThe scene fades to black.\n\n�These sequence of cannot be disrupted.� LEGACY intoned coldly.\n�Without the Autobots none of you would be here.� LEGACY turned back\nto face STRAIGHT SHOT, �And without the Decepticon�s attack on the Ark\nthe Autobots will not survive.�\n\nLEGACY folded his arms behind his back, �There can be no disruption of\nthe time flow.�\n\nThere was a small beep on LEGACY�s panel causing him to look over at\nit. �Interesting.� He said curiously. �It would seem that I am\nrequired on the bridge.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
