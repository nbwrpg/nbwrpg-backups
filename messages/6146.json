He had to be near!\nShe ran over the giant roots of the great pine in which she passed, the smell of the forest welcoming to her.\nIt was then that she heard his reply, the single howl echoing between the trunks of the ancient forest. It was a sound she liked to hear, the familiar and welcoming howl of a fellow wolf giving his position.\nShe sped up her pace a bit so that she would reach Rowdy faster, not wanting to keep him waiting for too long.\nRowdy&#39;s scent got even stronger as she rounded a bend in the forest, clearly stating that he was very near now.\nWith a sigh and intake of the fresh night air she slowed, her paw steps then slowing to a simple trot and then to a medium walk.\nZyber put her snout to the ground and took in the scent of the fallen pine needles, the fresh scent of her male counterpart there as well.\nShe then lifted her head and looked about, finally rounding a bush and spotting Rowdy off in a clearing a bit.\nWith a second sigh she then approached him but with her head a bit low, a sign of respect for wolves.\nBut tonight was different, she, more wolf then bot. Thus, beast mode&#39;s instincts were dominent...and they told her to show respect.\nZyber approached Rowdy Wolf further, waiting for him to notice her.\nLike real wolves always did.*\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
