With a roar, he replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You g=\r\not it Sir! Consider this creep as good as junk!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson too,=\r\n approaches the ninja intruder, and ignores that\n&gt; little warning about his=\r\n energy reserves going low. He had dealt with\n&gt; intruders of the dark many =\r\ntimes, and being visually impaired, he knew how\n&gt; to unlock their secrets o=\r\nf steath. He nodds to Legacy&#39;s reply.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Understood Legacy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He repl=\r\nies with a silent message over the com link, to keep himself from\n&gt; making =\r\nany noise. He switches his sonar systems to conscentrate on the\n&gt; intruder.=\r\n He was very close now. His blips getting stronger. With Hydras not\n&gt; too f=\r\nar behind, he realized he had to do what he had pulled on the old\n&gt; abandon=\r\ned base while working with Lord Perseus. When in doubt, resort to\n&gt; isolati=\r\non. He concentrates, listens, and deciphers that the ninja is within\n&gt; his =\r\nrange, in the same area. The dark was his element as well, as he soon\n&gt; fin=\r\nds a manual control to shut the doors sealing himself and the ninja\n&gt; insid=\r\ne. With a narrow of his brow, he slaps his hand against it, and then,\n&gt; wai=\r\nts to see if it works.\n&gt;\n&gt; His intent was clear, he wanted that ninja.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson. I&#39;ve approached the area where the intruder is\n&gt; =\r\nlocated. I&#39;m hoping the doors close properly to ensure capture. I sense thi=\r\ns\n&gt; enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting Uproar and Leo ll in =\r\ngrave\n&gt; danger, I will take on the intruder personally. He has crossed the =\r\nline in\n&gt; my envronment, and it&#39;s time he pays the price by someone who is =\r\nas versed\n&gt; in stealth as he is. I ask you to call back Uproar and Leo ll t=\r\no prevent\n&gt; further harm to them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His optics narrow. He draws Straight=\r\n Shot in his hands, to begin his little\n&gt; game of cat and mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt; Outsid=\r\ne the Ark, Night Shift quickly transforms and charges the enemy with\n&gt; a pl=\r\nasma riffle in hand, firing rounds, hoping to strike at least Scourge or\n&gt; =\r\nCyclonus, in hopes to disable them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We got some serious bolts ta pick=\r\n with you punks!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap also fires his own weaponry.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah!

There were times when\n&gt; they were successful, but there were also=\r\n many other times wHere sparks flew\n&gt; because a system was either shorted o=\r\nut or the fluctuation tripped some sort\n&gt; of breaker, causing cascading pow=\r\ner failures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Interesting.&quot; Legacy intoned as obviously like Perpec=\r\ntor his acute\n&gt; senses were being similarly affected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. &quot;=\r\nThe bridge seems\n&gt; largely unaffected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. It must because =\r\nit has shielding in\n&gt; place.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside the ark, Tucson holds his position and his wa=\r\nve. A look of\n&gt; sheer determination floods his face. He had not answered Ku=\r\np right away, but\n&gt; needed not to, as his body langauge fortells that of a =\r\ndetermined Autobot,\n&gt; sworn to duty, and prepared to go as much distance as=\r\n needed. In the midsts\n&gt; of the wave, he picks up a blip. He detects the in=\r\ntruder inside, and with\n&gt; that wave, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t=\r\n about to tell anyone what\n&gt; he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still un=\r\nderway, he approaches the ark\n&gt; calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. T=\r\nhe only one who would know what\n&gt; he&#39;d be up to, would be Legacy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar systems have picked up the intruder. I know of his\n&gt; l=\r\nocation and I&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to\n&gt; transm=\r\nit. Can you give me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;One moment.&quot; Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the front=\r\n\n&gt; door to the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You should have complete ac=\r\ncess\n&gt; to the Ark, as does everyone else.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Tuscon moved forward =\r\nthough low energy reserve alarm signals began to\n&gt; go off in Tuson&#39;s head. =\r\nHis wounds, his own energy loss over his trip back\n&gt; finally beginning to c=\r\natch up with him. While his wounds were bound so he\n&gt; leaked no further ene=\r\nrgy, he had yet to get to a recharging chamber, and the\n&gt; tremendous amount=\r\ns of energy that he was putting out to maintain his wave\n&gt; was further depl=\r\neting his already low energy reserves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot; Owww.. That wave is really hurting my relays.. Wait a sec, my radars\n&gt; ar=\r\ne picking up activity all over the place. We need ta amplify that wave of\n&gt;=\r\n yours.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks down to her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full pow=\r\ner already Straight Shot. Unless of course, Legacy can\n&gt; rig up an amplifie=\r\nr within the Ark to supplement my sonar attack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot =\r\nnodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m asking a f=\r\navor on Tucsons\n&gt; behalf. His waves are strong enough to pick up enemy forc=\r\nes in wide range,\n&gt; but he wants to take it up a notch and see if he can im=\r\nmobilize them at a\n&gt; further range. Kind of put them in a stall for now. Ca=\r\nn you set up an\n&gt; amplifier signal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It =\r\nwould be greatly\n&gt; appreciated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice =\r\ncan be heard over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;Many of the Ark&#39;s\n&gt; systems are also bei=\r\nng affected by the wave you are transmitting. At the\n&gt; moment Perceptor and=\r\n I are minimizing the damage by reallocating power from\n&gt; down systems to t=\r\nhe few that are still running. I have no resources\n&gt; available to comply wi=\r\nth your request.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Night Shift =\r\ncatches something on his radar, and begins\n&gt; to pick up a little speed, buz=\r\nzing a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunting dog\n&gt; fixated on it&#39;s target.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;!

Ya won&#39;t believe it, but Wheels was right on=\r\n\n&gt; the money this time! They&#39;re out here, and I bet they&#39;re around the othe=\r\nr\n&gt; parameters too!

He narrows\n&gt; his optics dangerously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and seek... Been there, done that a millio=\r\nn\n&gt; times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I know you&#39;re out there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: K=\r\neep in mind, it was ONLY the intruder inside the Ark who&#39;s stealth\n&gt; shield=\r\ning went down. Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted by\n&gt; Tusc=\r\non&#39;s wave. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is of a different sort and at the moment\n&gt; i=\r\ns unaffected by it. However that is water under the bridge with unfolding\n&gt;=\r\n events :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As the Maximals creep forward in an attempt=\r\n to locate the Predacons,\n&gt; Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont touch the ark but ATTACK\n&gt; =\r\nTHE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Six sweeps fly into the air, followed by th=\r\neir leader Scourge! As soon as\n&gt; they leave the vicinity of Hydras, the Pre=\r\ndacon leader looses the advantage\n&gt; of their stealth and immediately begins=\r\n showing up on Maximal radar screens!\n&gt; However the sweeps still maintain t=\r\nheir stealth, and only those who can\n&gt; physically see them are aware of the=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a viciousness all their own, they begin to open fire on the=\r\n\n&gt; Maximals!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon receives a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I am rece=\r\niving readings of a\n&gt; single Predacon in your area, his IFF signal identify=\r\ning him as Hydras.&quot;\n&gt; Although there was a certain level of urgency in his =\r\nvoice, Legacy was still\n&gt; calm and reserved as he made his tranmission.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Back inside the Ark the intruder frowned as he realized that h=\r\nis bomb had\n&gt; not gone off. With a whispered curse he continued to try to a=\r\ndapt his\n&gt; stealth shielding to Tuscon&#39;s wave. With a worried look he began=\r\n to run down\n&gt; the hall, if he couldn&#39;t sneak out, he would BLAST his way o=\r\nut!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--90e6ba53a594bf5958049e9d88fa\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Just a quick question: Is Tuscon still emitting his wave while he is d=\r\noing all this?

Consider this creep as good as junk!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Tucson too, approaches the ninja intruder, and ignores th=\r\nat little warning about his energy reserves going low. He had dealt with in=\r\ntruders of the dark many times, and being visually impaired, he knew how to=\r\n unlock their secrets of steath. He nodds to Legacy&#39;s reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&q=\r\nuot; Understood Legacy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He replies with a silent message over =\r\nthe com link, to keep himself from making any noise. He switches his sonar =\r\nsystems to conscentrate on the intruder. He was very close now. His blips g=\r\netting stronger. With Hydras not too far behind, he realized he had to do w=\r\nhat he had pulled on the old abandoned base while working with Lord Perseus=\r\n. When in doubt, resort to isolation. He concentrates, listens, and deciphe=\r\nrs that the ninja is within his range, in the same area. The dark was his e=\r\nlement as well, as he soon finds a manual control to shut the doors sealing=\r\n himself and the ninja inside. With a narrow of his brow, he slaps his hand=\r\n against it, and then, waits to see if it works. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;His intent was cl=\r\near, he wanted that ninja.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson. I&#39;ve a=\r\npproached the area where the intruder is located. I&#39;m hoping the doors =\r\nclose properly to ensure capture. I sense this enemy is much like myself, a=\r\nnd instead of putting Uproar and Leo ll in grave danger, I will take on the=\r\n intruder personally. He has crossed the line in my envronment, and it&#39;=\r\ns time he pays the price by someone who is as versed in stealth as he is. I=\r\n ask you to call back Uproar and Leo ll to prevent further harm to them.&qu=\r\not;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;His optics narrow. He draws Straight Shot in his hands, to begi=\r\nn his little game of cat and mouse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside the Ark, Night Shift qu=\r\nickly transforms and charges the enemy with a plasma riffle in hand, firing=\r\n rounds, hoping to strike at least Scourge or Cyclonus, in hopes to disable=\r\n them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot; We got some serious bolts ta pick with you punks!&quo=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rat Trap also fires his own weaponry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yeah!

He could sti=\r\nll smell something familliar, and enemy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;W=\r\nhoever was in this area, is still here, I can smell &#39;em. They&#39;re no=\r\nt too far off. Question is, who and what are we dealing with?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Uproar and Leo II are both pacing an=\r\nd sniffing their senses on hyper alert. Who ever it is, there are skilled a=\r\nt keeping themselves hidden and hiding their scent. But even with that ther=\r\ne is the faint odor of Predacon or even Unicronian in the air, it is coming=\r\n from down the hall in the direction from where they had come. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Elita lowered her ears an=\r\nd said &quot;He almost caught me, dad... I&#39;m not so strong... He said t=\r\nhat he will come back for me... And I couldt stop him... What if he hurts m=\r\nom trying to caught me... Lord Elder!!!!! He&#39;s Hurt, badly hurt.... Dad=\r\ndy!!! We have to go to help him... HE&#39;S THERE!!!&quot; said elita while=\r\n the cloack device briefly fall she was able to see it .&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus&#39; face went dark as Elita told him =\r\nabout her near capture by the intruder, his arms holding her firmly as she =\r\ntalked. &quot;That will never happen my little one.&quot; He said, his voic=\r\ne confident and sure as he spoke. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus looked in the =\r\ndirection that Elita was pointing but could not see anything since the intr=\r\nuder was still a few halls away and several walls were standing between him=\r\n and the intruder. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;LEO, UPROAR!&quot; Rodimus said,=\r\n his voice once again full of command. &quot;Go retrieve this intruder. It =\r\nis time to have a few words with him.&quot; There was old confidence in Rod=\r\nimus&#39; voice again as he stood tall and protective over his young daught=\r\ner. &quot;Ramulus, go with them. I want him captured!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor t=\r\nried to cut of the main lead, stop the explosion and save the ark!!!!!!! Th=\r\nen He yellss in pain, what ever Tucson have done, it really hurted. but Ove=\r\nrcoming the pain contined working and trying to insolate the Autobots and d=\r\necepticons from the main mess.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; As Perceptor worked Legacy also struggled to keep different systems onli=\r\nne, rerouting power from one system to the next. There were times when they=\r\n were successful, but there were also many other times wHere sparks flew be=\r\ncause a system was either shorted out or the fluctuation tripped some sort =\r\nof breaker, causing cascading power failures. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Inte=\r\nresting.&quot; Legacy intoned as obviously like Perpector his acute senses =\r\nwere being similarly affected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. &quot;The bridge see=\r\nms largely unaffected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. It must because it has shiel=\r\nding in place.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the ark=\r\n, Tucson holds his position and his wave. A look of sheer determination flo=\r\nods his face. He had not answered Kup right away, but needed not to, as his=\r\n body langauge fortells that of a determined Autobot, sworn to duty, and pr=\r\nepared to go as much distance as needed. In the midsts of the wave, he pick=\r\ns up a blip. He detects the intruder inside, and with that wave, pinpoints =\r\nhis location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone what he&#39;d be up t=\r\no next. With transmission still underway, he approaches the ark calmly, wit=\r\nh an alert stride to his walk. The only one who would know what he&#39;d be=\r\n up to, would be Legacy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar =\r\nsystems have picked up the intruder. I know of his location and I&#39;m ver=\r\ny sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to transmit. Can you give me a=\r\nccess into the Ark at this time?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;One moment.&quot; Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon,=\r\n and then the front door to the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You s=\r\nhould have complete access to the Ark, as does everyone else.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As Tuscon moved forward though low energy reserve alarm signals =\r\nbegan to go off in Tuson&#39;s head. His wounds, his own energy loss over h=\r\nis trip back finally beginning to catch up with him. While his wounds were =\r\nbound so he leaked no further energy, he had yet to get to a recharging cha=\r\nmber, and the tremendous amounts of energy that he was putting out to maint=\r\nain his wave was further depleting his already low energy reserves. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &q=\r\nuot; Owww.. That wave is really hurting my relays.. Wait a sec, my radars a=\r\nre picking up activity all over the place. We need ta amplify that wave of =\r\nyours.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson looks down to her.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power already Straight Shot. Unless =\r\nof course, Legacy can rig up an amplifier within the Ark to supplement my s=\r\nonar attack.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;=\r\nm asking a favor on Tucsons behalf. His waves are strong enough to pick up =\r\nenemy forces in wide range, but he wants to take it up a notch and see if h=\r\ne can immobilize them at a further range. Kind of put them in a stall for n=\r\now. Can you set up an amplifier signal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar sys=\r\ntem? It would be greatly appreciated.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice can be heard over Tuscon&#39;s radi=\r\no, &quot;Many of the Ark&#39;s systems are also being affected by the wave =\r\nyou are transmitting. At the moment Perceptor and I are minimizing the dama=\r\nge by reallocating power from down systems to the few that are still runnin=\r\ng. I have no resources available to comply with your request.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Nigh=\r\nt Shift catches something on his radar, and begins to pick up a little spee=\r\nd, buzzing a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunting dog fixated on it&#39;s targe=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;S A =\r\nPRED SIGNATURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;re not far from our targets Kup, I can fe=\r\nel &#39;em!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap too, senses them.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;He&#39;s right! I got the pred signature and i=\r\nt&#39;s locked&#39;n loaded! Ohhh Wheels was right! He was right! They&#39;=\r\nre still here!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets a hold of Rodi=\r\nmus and the others at the Ark.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Rat=\r\n Trap ta base! Ya won&#39;t believe it, but Wheels was right on the money t=\r\nhis time! They&#39;re out here, and I bet they&#39;re around the other para=\r\nmeters too! Keep your sensors out for &#39;em, &#39;cause ya never know wha=\r\nt those creeps are gonna be up to.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Back at=\r\n the Ark, outside, Tucson holds for word, but with sonars at full blast, he=\r\n picks up activity happening all around the Ark. He narrows his optics dang=\r\nerously.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and s=\r\neek... Been there, done that a million times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I kno=\r\nw you&#39;re out there.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; OOC: Keep in mind,=\r\n it was ONLY the intruder inside the Ark who&#39;s stealth shielding went d=\r\nown. Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted by Tuscon&#39;s wav=\r\ne. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is of a different sort and at the moment is unaf=\r\nfected by it. However that is water under the bridge with unfolding events =\r\n:)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; BIC: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As the Maximals creep forward i=\r\nn an attempt to locate the Predacons, Hydras chooses this moment to attack!=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &=\r\nquot;dont touch the ark but ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Six sweeps fly into the air, followed by their leader Scourg=\r\ne! As soon as they leave the vicinity of Hydras, the Predacon leader looses=\r\n the advantage of their stealth and immediately begins showing up on Maxima=\r\nl radar screens! However the sweeps still maintain their stealth, and only =\r\nthose who can physically see them are aware of them. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Wit=\r\nh a viciousness all their own, they begin to open fire on the Maximals!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Tuscon receives a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I am receiv=\r\ning readings of a single Predacon in your area, his IFF signal identifying =\r\nhim as Hydras.&quot; Although there was a certain level of urgency in his v=\r\noice, Legacy was still calm and reserved as he made his tranmission.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Back inside the Ark the intruder frowned as h=\r\ne realized that his bomb had not gone off. With a whispered curse he contin=\r\nued to try to adapt his stealth shielding to Tuscon&#39;s wave. With a worr=\r\nied look he began to run down the hall, if he couldn&#39;t sneak out, he wo=\r\nuld BLAST his way out!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT: 0px; C=\r\nOLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--90e6ba53a594bf5958049e9d88fa--\r\n\n"}}
