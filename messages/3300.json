Uh, We are looking for Inny, I\nmean Iron Raptor. She is a long time freind of ours\nand we came from our planet to look for her, when she\nnever came back. Uh, we see that she is kinda busy\nright now, so would you please tell us of this planet?\nOur computer on our ship didn&#39;t have sufficent\ninformation on it and we don&#39;t really know much about\nour beast modes either. If you would be kind enough to\nshow us around and explain until, Er, Iron is\nfinished, we would be very grateful.&quot;\n\n \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
