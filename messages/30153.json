A pity, I had plans for them.  My \nminions, we must act quickly now.  We must plant the seeds of destruction in \nthis Neo Decepticon Empire.  They will be our puppets, and we will control \ntheir strings.  Emperor Shockwave is on his way.  Vehement and Reflector, \nintercept and escort him to Rana Kao and follow through with the plan.  Sun \nCrusher and I will talk with Hell Beast.&quot;\n\nVehement and Reflector gave a slight bow, leaving the room and heading for \nthe nearest way out of the ship.\n\nSun Crusher looked to Unicron.  &quot;What do you have in mind, mighty \nChaos-Bringer?&quot;\n\nThe ancient being smiled, which wasn&#39;t a wholesome sight.  &quot;We must give the \nNeo Decepticons a guiding push to make them strong.  For now, we need Hell \nBeast&#39;s numbers to act out another piece of our plan.&quot; he finished his \nsentence with another evil smile, activating his comm. system.\n\n&quot;Hell Beast, this is the leader of the Brotherhood.  I wish to discuss an \nimportant matter with you.&quot;\n\n"}}
