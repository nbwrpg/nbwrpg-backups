But he was still pray none \nthe less.\nShe was about to resume wrapping around him when two grenades sent him \nflying towards her...sword tip first.\n&lt; Ak!&gt;\nHer mind quickly calculated exactly what sort of damage that sword would \ncause before it even reached her.\nWould it pierce her armor plated exo-structure?\nBetter believe it!\nWould it damage any vital circuits?\nNo.\nHow deep would it go in?\nNot far, but enough to cause a good sized scar after the fight.\nSo the sword wasn&#39;t a concern, but to minimize the damage IR moved the best \nshe could so that the blade would hit her shoulder...leaving FireBlade&#39;s \nbody vulnerable to attack.\nAnd so it struck, the blade going in only a quarter of the way to contact \nthe thick plating of her shoulder that kept her circuits safe. It was hard \nenough that if the blade struck too hard it would either bend or crack the \nblade.\nShe had been built well by her creators, and twice as well by the Matrix.\nIron Raptor then looked over her shoulder at FireBlade, swinging her head \naround so that it would be less then an inch from his.\nHer large, clawed hand came to try and grab at his arm that held the sword, \nintended on ripping it free from it&#39;s socket or at least making him let go \nof the sword.\nShe bared her silver 7 inch long teeth.*\n\n&quot; Big mistake!&quot;\n\n* Her voice boomed as she spat acid at FireBlade&#39;s face.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
