Maybe she didn&#39;t like him. Maybe she did, and didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to show it. Quickstrike was dumbfounded about it. He went on about\n&gt; &gt;himself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and captured a last fish. He went back to the shore and ate both of\n&gt; &gt;them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Afterwards he transformed to his robot mode and jogged back to the\n&gt; &gt;Predacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cave. He knew she would be there. He thought of asking what went\nwrong.\n&gt; &gt;He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ought to, maybe it was something unconscious he did, and he would\nremind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself never to do it again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He had forgotten about his fatigueness, and at the entrance of the\ncave,\n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; legs went out on him.
