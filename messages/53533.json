She knew \n&gt; the Ghost Bear had overheard.  &quot;I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re complaining \n&gt; about, Maxima.&quot; she says.  &quot;They scrapped your old, highly \n&gt; inefficient body in favor of a top-of-the-line model.  I&#39;m quite \n&gt; happy the way I am now.  But, if you really want to find Teletran-\n1, \n&gt; be wary.  The Tripredacus forces would gain even more of an \nadvantage \n&gt; then they have already if the Ark were destroyed, and they know \n&gt; this.  You must be careful not to lead them to it by accident.&quot;\n\nShe glanced down. The idea of the Ark destroyed didn&#39;t bother her \nmuch. It was the fact that Megatron would be in danger that did alarm \nher greatly. &quot;I have to try, Empath.&quot; Pausing a moment. &quot;I won&#39;t risk \nMegatron&#39;s termination. Hence why I think that I need to go... to \nprotect it. If they were as intelligent as they say they are, then \nthey already know the location. All they have to do is go there & \ndestroy it.&quot; then she thought. &quot;Then again, if they did, there would \nbe none of us now. Well, except for you & I since we were not aboard \nthe Ark.&quot; She felt she had to protect her comrades in stasis on the \nArk.  \n\nThen she looked up. &quot;As I see it, this transorganic form is weaker \nthan my old form. For one... I can&#39;t fly.&quot; she smirked. She wondered \nif that was a touchy spot for the old Seeker considering if she was \nanything like the other Seekers, flight was the ultimate in freedom & \nconquest. \n\n\n"}}
