The walls are bacially bare rock.\n\nThe sound of some sort of stone on stone hammering can be heard echoig\nfrom deep within.\n\n(TAG)\n\nOOC: Airly, please keep in mind that Perceptor is detecting the\nradiation from something that could be Uranium. The radiation is\nsomething that could be used for an energy source, but there is\nnothing refined or being used actively as an energy source. At least\nnot anywhere in sensor range.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
