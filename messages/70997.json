I hope that helps.\n\nPreston\n\n\nPreston&#39;s Posts (70985 & 70986)\n\nRe: Wicked Blades in the Dark!!\n\n\nNear to the Black Tower:\n\nAs Tuscon and the rest lay down their weapons, the other soldiers move\nto encircle the Maximals and the Autobots. Insecticon, Bruticus-X, and\nIguanus moved in almost eagerly to pick up the mighty weapons that\nTuscon has dropped, while Inferno, the self proclaimed bodyguard of\nHydras watched Tuscon carefully, his optic ready to spot treachery.\n\nQuietly a short message is sent to Tuscon, �Tuscon.� The deep voice of\nNoctorro, the leader of the Maximal Fuzors can be heard, �My team is\nhere. Rodimus sent us to aid you. None too soon it would seem.�\nNoctorro�s words are grim, a soldier�s humor in them. �We await your\nsignal.�\n\nAt the same time Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike move\nto do the same with Kup, Nightshift, Straightshot, Talon and the\nothers. Skyshadow, the leader of the Predacon Fuzors just watches with\na gloating look on his face, it is almost as if he wants them to\nattack and keep the battle going.\n\nMeanwhile Phobia and several sweeps keep an eye on things from the\nair, while Terrorsaur and Waspinator landed, ready to help out as\nneeded.\n\nAt the same time Legacy processed Tuscon�s command for him to leave\nthe Ark. There was a long pause, and then the temporal guardian�s cold\nvoice comes across the channel, �I will not comply with your command.\nI have been tasked with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n\nDeepstryke transmits to Hydras, �Hydras. I am picking up an encrypted\ntransmissions to and from Tuscon, he is attempting to communicate with\nthe others. I am generating a radio dampening field now in this area.\nOnly the Predacons will be able to transmit.�\n\n\nMeanwhile inside the Black Tower:\n\nWindlord�s attempt to open fire on the Scourge was met with a measure\nof futility. Scourge just stepped away from the opening that Windlord\nfired out from and let the shots go harmlessly into a bulkhead,\nscorching it only slightly.\n\nHowever that slight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time\nto scurry further into their crawl space and find an interior bulkhead\nto hide behind.\n\n�Scrap!� Scourge�s voice said from the outside. There was a pause and\nthen, �Cyclonus, they have fled into the walls.�\n\nThere was another pause, and then Scourge chuckled, �Of course. I will\nbe ready for them.�\n\nFrom further inside the crawl space the sounds of chittering could be\nheard, and then several groups of optics could be seen in the distance\ncoming towards Rat Trap and Windlord. In the darkness their shapes\ncould only be barely made out, but they looked like black metallic\nspiders, Hydras� wall guardians!\n\n(OOC: Rat Trap may recognize them from last time. Also keep in mind\nthat Rat Trap and Windlord should be in beast mode. They would have to\nbe to fit inside the crawl space. In the toon the Beast Modes did not\nhave offensive weaponry, except for teeth and claws)\n\nOutside the Ark:\n\nRodimus was positioned in a small grove of trees, ducking down behind\nseveral large rocks. He gives Quickstride a quizzical look as the\nequine Maximal sniffed him.\n\n(OOC: Quickstride�s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n\nHe was about to let Quickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar\nappeared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar�s conclusion\nthat it was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn�t know\nthat much about Legacy, having only seen him briefly while being\nrescued and repaired, there was nothing to hint that this attack was\nLegacy�s doing. He was about to say something when Uproar ran towards\nthe Ark to be let in . . .\n\n&gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n\nAs Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed like a round bolt of\nlightening appeared, sending Uproar flying several yards through the\nair, to land heavily on the ground! Evidently the Ark shielding was\nstill in place, and it was not allowing anyone in.\n\nRodimus frowned, �Uproar! Get over here! If we are going to get back\nin, then we need to work together. That shield is supposed to hold off\nall the Predacon forces. We are not going to get in by brute force.�\n\nAs Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed to almost materialize\nout of the underbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n\nThe first was Wing Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an\nold Maximal stratagist and military teacher, who from the brownish\nfeathers along his frame turned into some sort of eagle.\n\nThe next was Leo II,\n(http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg )\nthe adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked much like him, and who\nhad obviously picked up many of his mannerisms. His body was\npowerfully built and heavily armored. He looked to turn into a lion.\n\nThe third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like\nthe others been on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying\nto keep it free from Predacon invasion.\n\nThey also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the\nother two, �What now sir?�\n\nRodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, �Well let�s get out of\nsight, and then we can discuss it.�\n\nMeanwhile Inside the Ark:\n\nPerceptor had received Tuscon�s message and sent attempted to send a\nmessage to Lord elder, however at the moment there was no answer from\nthe elder Maximal.\n\nAt the same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with\nthe others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n\n�It would seem that Nightlight�s vital systems are being held at\nminimal levels.� Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel\nnearest Nightlight. A small light blinked, indicating her spark was\nstill online, but that there was not enough power to reboot her\nsystems.\n\nHe turned to look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness, lit\nby his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised\nhis right hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin\nto emit light from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the\nroom was illuminated. He casually looked around, �Perhaps we could\nlocate a back out or reserve power system . . . �\n\nLegacy paused as Tuscon�s message came in. He turned to look at\nSanton, Bump and Perceptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing\nacross his face.\n\nLegacy straightened as his cold voice comes across the channel, �I\nwill not comply with your command. I have been tasked with  . . . .\n&gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;  . . . the protection of the Ark as well as that of the\nMatrix. I will not knowingly leave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in\nthe hands of another.�\n\nLegacy turned to look at his console as he understoodf what happened.\nCommunications had been cut part way through his message. He turned to\nlook at the others, his single optic cold, �It is illogical to believe\nthat I would attempt to harm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from\nthe Maximals.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: Please keep in mind that radio/video communications from the\nbattle field around the Black Tower have been severed for the Maximals\nand Autobots. Those at the Ark however are free to communicate with\neach other if they choose.\n\nSandy&#39;s Message: (Message #70992)\n\nTucson now recieves Notcorro&#39;s message. He thinks of a way to signal him\nwithout drawing attention to himself or the others. It was critical. He \nkeeps\nhis weapons down, and sends an encrypted message back to Noctorro.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not exactly perfect, and help would gladly be \nappreciated.\nI have an idea. While I have you on an encrypted signal, I best let you know \nto\nstart moving in now. But try to remain unseen, move in gradually, and \nquietly.\nIf you can, send in several fuzors in at a time, and in phases, send in \nothers,\naccording to their skills and expertise. I will continue to hold my position\nhere.&quot;\n\nNight Shift and Straight Shot keep quiet. They could tell Tucson was in \nthought,\nand somehow thinking up a strategy to get them out of their bind. He now had \nto\nsend a message to Legacy.\n\n&quot;Legacy, if you can hear me, I strongly suggest that you heed my demands and\nvacate immediately. You are endangering the lives of Nightlight and the \nothers,\nand those who endanger my comrades, deserve not to be among them. Although, \nI\nwill be willing to meet with you privately in a remote location of your \nchoice.\nBut not now. Now is not the time. Heed my words now and things will not be\ndifficult.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Uproar hears Rodimus, and trots over to him, looking a bit\nconfused. Quickstride looks over to him as well.\n\n&quot; Sorry for the fuss, hey, what&#39;s go&#39;n on? Why won&#39;t the Ark open for us?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks over to him.\n\n&quot;Legacy is holding the Ark hostage, I think, or at least that&#39;s what I got \nfrom\nthe last message from Lord Elder.&quot;\n\nUproar looks to the Ark and back at Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Whew, I&#39;m glad you stopped me, Sir. No tell&#39;n what kind of attack I \ncould&#39;ve\nmet up with. Okay, I&#39;m definitely in on helping you out. But how are we \ngonna\nget the Ark back without getting blown ta scrap?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Yeah, what he said, how are we gonna get outa this mess? This is something\nneither one of us has ever encountered.&quot;\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
