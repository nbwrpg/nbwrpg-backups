His eyes narrow further as \nIguanis enter the cell, Striker&#39;s eyes glancing for a second at the cell \nguns. He takes a step back.\n\n&quot;Whipe your own memory,&quot; he says calmly, suddenlu croutching into a fighting \nstance as one shoulder blaster opens fire on Iguanis, the other one firing at \nthe cell guns.\n\nAs he saw it, the Trainers had two choises. They either knocked him out, and \nhis internal computer would self destruct, or he would win and got away. \nEither way, they&#39;d have one less hostage. He activates his comm-link, sending \na quickly-formed transmission.\n\n&quot;Ramulus, you&#39;ve been a good friend. The meeting&#39;s a trap, but get Spears \nback somehow! Perhaps we will meet again sometimes, maybe in the Matrix. I \ndoubt I&#39;ll live through this,&quot; the whole transmission took his computer a \nsecond to formulate and send, all silently as Striker crouches, ready to \nfight.\n\n"}}
