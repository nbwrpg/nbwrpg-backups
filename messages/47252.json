Do you want to go to my base and meet the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; others, or would you prefer to stay here for some times? Either \n&gt; way, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be with you.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mistra was quite glad all had gone well with the encounter. She \n&gt; smiled at \n&gt; &gt; Azure, glad to hear he&#39;d be with her no matter what she decided. \n&gt; &quot;Whatever \n&gt; &gt; you think would be the best desicion, Azure.&quot; She trusted her new \n&gt; friend&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; judgement by now. Either way, he&#39;d be with her he had said.\n\n\n"}}
