She looked a the sphere \nwondering what was going on.  She saw the bot, who looked like \nHellBeast step out of the ship.  She felt a twinge of fear and anger \nflow through her.  Why was this bot the one to decide who lived and \ndied?  Why was he the one playing the Matrix?   She wanted to turn \nhim into scrap.  But she knew she had better hold tight and wait to \nsee what happened before jumping into something.   Megatron was one \nthing, but this was something totally different.\nShe stayed in mouse mode and twitched her whiskers.  She didn&#39;t like \nthis at all.\n\n\n"}}
