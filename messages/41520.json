There was now a large metal sheet that would retract \nto allow people inn and another one at the base of the mountain.He \nopens a link to Apeface.  &quot;Apeface, Tremor here.  I have SLuggy \nand, well he is kinda dead, I think.  You wanna let us in. &quot; Tremor \nthen looks around as he hears t he faint sounds of a jet. but \ndoesn&#39;t see  anything.\n\nJetV sees the ground ahead and dives down into the water \nshooting back up quickly and transforming to his ATV mode.  He \ndrives through the trees to the base of the mountain, just out of \nsight of the entrace there.\n=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nDreadwing comes to a complete stop in mid air as the farage of \nbullets whiz in front of him.  The missiles had a different idea \nthough as they slammed underneath him.  He went into a crazy \ndive straigh at the ship then pulled up leveling along the ship.  \nLetting two missiles whiz at the missile launcher before circling a \nway.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nSeekker followed.  Seeing Lokk looking for some bullets he runs up \nto him pointing one of his miniguns straight at his face.  &quot;I&#39;vre got \nbullets, ya want some, huh, do ya?&quot; he said in a gansta voice.  \n\n"}}
