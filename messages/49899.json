He hadn&#39;t yet met\n&gt; Spike, formally at \n&gt; least. He pushed down his anger and took a deep\n&gt; breath. Even though he \n&gt; did not truly breathe, the techno-organic\n&gt; arrangement of his body made \n&gt; this motion relaxing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: You must be one of our new warriors. I am\n&gt; Major Tyrael. Please \n&gt; tell me about you. Talon, can you install\n&gt; auto-defenses on the base? \n&gt; You are free to go to CR right after that. I want\n&gt; this to get done \n&gt; with as soon as possible. And where in the name of\n&gt; Gamma is Shadow \n&gt; Star?\n&gt; \n&gt; He transformed and took Burrock&#39;s remain to a DNA\n&gt; containment capsule \n&gt; inside the ship.
