Puts a CD in the computer record this fight I \nneed to gather all the data on the other fighter.&quot;  Tigerhawk Spins around in \nthe command chair &quot;Heres the plan in 2 steps. &quot;Tigerhawk Pulls up layout of \nZardus ship. &quot;odds are that the alliances holding cell are here a red light \ngoes off in the center of the ship.&quot; \n\n&quot;Step.1 Autoguns and shields.  \n&quot;Me and the Radicons can generate a high enough energy level to Draw off the \nautoguns. While Archangel will break through the shields&quot;\n\nTigerhawk Tosses a weird shaped grenade to Archangel &quot;this Pure Water a \ndevice which a hole in the shield pure water is water with the electrolytes \nremoved so it cannot carry electricity and a shield energy is mostly \nelectricity so it will give you some time to get in.&quot;\n\nStep.2  Split into teams and search the ship. \nGet Iron and hall ass back here and get ready to defend against a counter \nattack. Hands all the people going a holocube \n\n&quot;This our chance to get the preds and alliance fighting each cube will make \nus look like a pred of your choice. Tigerhawk turns on his cube and looks \nlike hellbeast.\n\nComputer &quot;pred  alert pred alert autoguns online.&quot;\n\nTigerhawk cut off the cube &quot;It will mask out energy signals. Any questions ?&quot;\n\n"}}
