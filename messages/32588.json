He hesitated a \n&gt; moment....should he pursue the badly damaged bot? Finish him off?\n&gt;        The thought coursed through the Vhicons mind until he came to\na snap \n&gt; descision. He would remain at his present location, bombarding the\nCF. He \n&gt; would send Prowl a package.\n&gt;        Two missles errupted from the turrets on Crakens underside. They \n&gt; sailed downaward for Prowl&#39;s signiture. The Vhicon watched from above, \n&gt; waiting to see the final blast of that Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Marine grabbed his hip in pain, but there was only an open wound \n&gt; spouting mech fluid. The fem had taken a good chnck of his side out.\nThe \n&gt; sensor circuts for pain were registering this at full. His eyes blinked \n&gt; several times as Marines internal repairs kicked it. The mech began to \n&gt; minimize its flow into a small trickle.\n&gt;        He didnt stall, his next move would be brutal, but before he\ncould \n&gt; counter attack, Ominous Prime and Quasar sent 15 shots each of pure\neneron \n&gt; energy at Iron Raptor&#39;s backside. The blasts exited from the\nenergonians \n&gt; palms, and sailed across the air in fast blue streaks. the crackle\nof the \n&gt; energy made Marine stop. It was a terrible sound, and the effects of\nthe \n&gt; blasts on a bot, especially in beast mode, would be merciless.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Jackle saw Marine&#39;s side explode off of him as IR attacked\nhim. He \n&gt; raised his plasma riffle and sent 15 blasts wizzing for the Maximal\nleader.\n\n\n"}}
