Raising a pincher, cloaking quickly, he fired a regular missile off up \nat Sixshot, who was in the process of strafing once more.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee charged out of his quarters, raising both stinger missile \nlaunchers.  &quot;Hmmm...maybe I should sit this one out...&quot; he said to himself, \nwalking instead of running to an exit to the Predacon base.\n\n===========\n\nNemesis Enforcer walked into the bridge of the Alliance base, waiting.\n\n---\n\nEach Oblitercon got out of a CR chamber.\n\nDark One looked around.  &lt;Zardus, where is my payment of 200 kilos of energon \nlocated?  I wish to collect my payments&gt;\n\n==========\n\nSixshot opened fire, lasers tearing up Double Punch&#39;s incoming missile, \ncausing it to explode before it hit it&#39;s intended target.  Sixshot chuckled.  \n&quot;A cloaking device...to bad it won&#39;t do much good!&quot; he laughed, firing two \nmissiles at where he had saw the missile eminate from.\n\n---\n\nUnitron grunted as autogun fire hit him, firing two missiles into the crowd \nof Predacons Marine was leading.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch yelled, two missiles sending him slamming back through the air, \nslamming into the hull of the Predacon ship, his cloaking device down, \nhimself sliding to the ground unconsciouss.\n\n---\n\nKoga Shuko took out his missile launcher, firing an optic blast at an \nautogun, as autogunf ire bounced off his heavy armor, leaving scratches.  He \nfired off a rocket at the middle of the parade of advancing Predacons Marine \nwas leading.\n\n---\n\nAnubis took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at the crowd of \nangry as hell looking Predacons.\n\n---\n\nHades raised his laser rifle, firing three bolts, each at a seperate autogun.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor raised his plasma launcher, firing a powerful plasma blast off at a \ngroup of autoguns.  &quot;Myah, where&#39;s your Messiah now you backstabbing pieces \nof slag!  This&#39;ll teach you to double cross me!&quot; Serpentor yelled, firing an \noptic blast off at the Predacon base.\n\n=========\n\nBeachcomber gently pushed Smokescreen off of him.  Getting to his feet with a \nlimp, he looked at his arm and yelped.  It was what the humans would call: &quot;a \ndislocated shoulder&quot;.  Or, at least a dislocated right shoulder.  &quot;Slag!&quot; \nSmokescreen yelled.  &quot;Hey...lady!&quot; he yelled to Fidget.  &quot;Give me a hand with \nthis guy.  I...can&#39;t use one of mine.&quot; he said, smiling slightly, gripping \nSmokescreen by the head, his palm gripping on the back of the fellow \nMaximal&#39;s head.\n\n---\n\nRamhorn shook his head, waking up.  He had fallen asleep.  Slag waiting for \nPlintissa!  Everything was going the Inferno!  The base was dead.  It might \nbe better just to sell it and buy a new one!  Of course...that was \nimpossible...it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea if that ship&#39;s destruction wouldn&#39;t \nlead to the eventual destruction of Cybertron itself!  \n&quot;Ramhorn...beast...mode.&quot; going to rhino mode, Ramhorn slowly (and I mean \nslowly) headed for the Ark.\n\n"}}
