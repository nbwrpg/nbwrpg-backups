Of course, establishing\n&gt; a perimeter was a \n&gt; priority, but making certain that they were at the\n&gt; right place was \n&gt; more important.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Cancel your present orders. We have to know\n&gt; where we are \n&gt; first. Shadow Star, activate a stasis pod as soon as\n&gt; you have taken a \n&gt; beast mode. Once you are done, come and see me. Naga\n&gt; and Talon, check \n&gt; the long range scanners for any thermal sources\n&gt; other than geological. \n&gt; Try to see if you detect any energy signatures.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I&#39;ll take the new bot, and anyone else who is\n&gt; interested by a \n&gt; new char, just let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
