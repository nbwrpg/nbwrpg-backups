BLACKARACHNIA still poised\n&gt; in the shadows of the trees, keeping locks on the numerous Maximals as VICE\n&gt; GRIP had disengaged slightly, working over now with DRILL BIT in digging\n&gt; underneath the ground and burrowing.\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT smirking, &quot;Why, is taht not your own soldiers upon your orders who\n&gt; are continuosly harrassing us now?  Truly, I expected some semblance of\n&gt; dignity, at least from the Rodent.  Him I expected to have a smidgen of\n&gt; awareness of the crisis.  But, if he is quite happy to mock us when you have\n&gt; called us, then I doubt there is any crisis at all if he&#39;s quite happy to\n&gt; instigate a fight and back up those who do.  You wish to cooperate, keep\n&gt; your own force sin line.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO stood facing DINOBOT, his face serious his own anger obvious in\nhis bright optics, but held at bay by the force of his will.\n&quot;Maximals, stand down.&quot; he said again. He looked at DINOBOT, &quot;You will\nkeep your troops in line as well.&quot; He glanced up as the other\nPredacons were moving in. He glanced over at HYDRAS, wondering when or\neven if the PREDACON leader would do anything about his troops.\n\n&quot;With me.&quot; LEO said with a dramatic flare worthy of a PRIME. He turned\nand walked back towards the center of the clearing where they had\noriginally been having the discussion with HYDRAS, perhaps distance\nwould allow things to simmer down.\n\nLEO PRIME was having the distinct impression that this truce was not\ngoing to last, and he was not sure if he could hold it together long\nenough to get to TUSCON. At least so long as HYDRAS refused to keep\nhis men in check.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
