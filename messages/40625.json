This is an RPG board, not a general\n&gt; discussion board. If you want to discus something, do it over private email or on the message\n&gt; board on the site.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the completely pointless OOCs on the\n&gt; RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great RPer. Now shut up and take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW\n&gt; RPG. The moment I see a char with even a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, you&#39;ll regret it. In\n&gt; adition, stop moding. You can&#39;t make other people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for Mustex\n&gt; even attempting to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you have no part in the past\n&gt; of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no logical way of knowing about Zardus or\n&gt; Veratis, and its moding to have them have that insight. Either explain how they know or drop\n&gt; that storyline. It makes no sence. Also, you never even landed that lowlife seller or whatever\n&gt; of yours on the planet, and I&#39;m not going to write your profiles for you. Shape up. Read the\n&gt; rules and act by them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting on every post. The council will\n&gt; catch it if its moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t post at all. I&#39;m very sick of\n&gt; coming home from work and reading through 100 or so damn OOC posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate\n&gt; anyone who sends an OOC ever again. I won&#39;t, but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the verge of turning\n&gt; into a very mean person.\n&gt; \n&gt; From now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the site&#39;s message board. DO NOT clog\n&gt; up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of it, as I said like 10 times already in this post.\n&gt; \n&gt; There. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC messages stop. Its very hard for me to\n&gt; keep up with posts as it is, and all this pointless crap is starting to convince me not to even\n&gt; bother.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nREPLY SOON          HARLEY PARRY FROM ST.THOMAS\n\n_______________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet your free @... address at http://mail.yahoo.ca\n\n"}}
