Apparently there is a\n&gt; rash of accounts being broken into on yahoo.   Before it happens to you,\n&gt; there is something you can do to prevent intrusion.   And here it is:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1:  Sign into your account info.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2: Scroll down to SECOND SIGN IN VERIFICATION.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3: Click on that, it will send you a verification number and give you the\n&gt; option\n&gt; Of sending that number to another email, other than yahoo, or through your\n&gt; mobile phone, which is ten times safer by the way.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4:  If you have a mobile number, click on the option to just send it through\n&gt; there rather than the email.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5:  The verification code will need to be verified on the computer.  Type\n&gt; the number exactly how it was sent to you and then you&#39;re done.\n&gt;\n&gt; What this will do is make it impossible for hackers to access your account.\n&gt; If they try an unauthorized login they will fail miserably.  There&#39;s more\n&gt; info related to this in your account profile section.  It&#39;s really worth the\n&gt; time investment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
