She\nraised\n&gt; her head as she sniffed the air, her animal instincts beginning to take\n&gt; over. Her eyes closed to meer slits as she slowly stalked through and\naround\n&gt; the trees in a very wolf-like fashion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her tail stopped twitching and her steps were sure and calculated. She\n&gt; looked as if she knew what she was doing, and perhaps she did, for once.\n&gt; Tavatron growled under her breath as she caught a scent, something wounded\n&gt; was nearby. She watched as Dinobot headed in the direction of the scent,\nso\n&gt; he had scneted the wounded beast as well. Tavatron stopped walking as she\n&gt; came to the stream, her com chirped and beeped as Iron Raptor&#39;s voice\nechoed\n&gt; through the forest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron sighed, partially in relief but in actuallity was dissapointed\nthat\n&gt; the hunt had been cut short, again. The same thing had happened last time,\n&gt; always when they were trying to eat! Tavatron activated her wrist unit:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re on our way, Tavatron out.&quot; Tavatron then turned to Dinobot, he was\n&gt; moving along the bank towards the wounded creature, just thinking about it\n&gt; made her mouth water, she really was hungry. Tavatron activated her com\n&gt; again, so much for hunting:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Looks like we&#39;re gonna have to cut our hunt short, we&#39;ve been ordered\nback\n&gt; to base.&quot; Tavatron gazed at herself in the still waters, perhaps she could\n&gt; still come away with something...\n&gt;\n&gt; Tavatron plunged her head into the icy water and closed her jaws about a\n&gt; rather large trout. She tossed it on the bank, her head dripping with\nwater.\n&gt; She placed one paw on the flopping fish as she waited for its movement to\n&gt; cease. She looked over at Dinobot, maybe she couldn&#39;t hunt but fishing was\n&gt; another story!\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving\n&gt; more each month?
