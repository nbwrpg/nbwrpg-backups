We must return to our rightful residence where our\n&gt; children will be safe from further disturbance .&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets onto all fours , scoops up a baby into his left paw and cradles it\n&gt; gently while walking out on three legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; As soon as he sees no one around, he shifts into robot mode while holding\n&gt; his child and scoops Talon and the other baby into his powerful arms.  He\n&gt; smiles down to all of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can hardly wait to see Lord Elder&#39;s face when we return with our new\n&gt; family . Ten to one he will be all over them the moment he sees them. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His walk back to the Ark doesn&#39;t take long as he arrives home with Talon and\n&gt; babies in tow.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDISCIPLE backed up and allowed TALON and TUCSON the chance to leave\nundisturbed, his head is bowed and his eyes respectful. &quot;I hear you\nold one.&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You are no more and I understand now and\nso will Arcane.&quot;\n\nHe nodded respectfully, &quot;We will leave you as you left this place.&quot; he\nlooked up at the skies, &quot;However we must find a way to leave.&quot;\n\nAs TUCSON and TALON leave the area and arrive back at the ARK there\nwas a thoughtful almost sad look from DISCIPLE as he looked at the\nother dragons present. &quot;The call from ARCANE is for all dragons, That\none has made his choice.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;You know what must be\ndone.&quot;\n\nThe other dragons nodded as they carefully looked around, as if\nlooking at the land one last time. Then, like a flock of large\npredatory birds they took to the air and began to fly off, leaving\nnothing left of their existence, save for the bones of the OLD ONE.\n\nIn the air the other dragons quickly disappear from sight, leaving\nonly a single large silver and black armored plate glinting in the sun\nas it lay on the ground as if driven in like a sword or a nail.\n\n(No TAGS)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
