It was a \nperfect place to rest. When Megatron was through with his battle, they could \nalways find him, calling him through comm-link. He looked around at first, \nwatching for Hell Beast&#39;s soldiers and the Maximals. He was already tired of \nthis. All he wanted was: rest and repair. He didn&#39;t like being on the run. \nThat slagging ship! If the shields were strong enough they wouldn&#39;t be in \nthis mess. She was nothing compared to the Darkside. The Darkside was a ship \nhe was used to.\n\nHe quietly entered the forest, watching where he stepped his many legs. He \nwas careful not to make any loud cracks with the dry, dead branches. He \nvisioned spun and his head went light.\n\nNot again. He didn&#39;t want to pass out. Someone could catch him. He looked \naround for a place to shelter until all of this passed. He kept moving, \nstepping to the side unexpectedly with his bad balance with the dizziness. \nWhat was this poision?\n\nHe eyed a large tree lying on its side. He crawled over to it. He went to \nthe bottom half of it and saw that the center of it was hollowed.\n\nIt was perfect. It was large enough for him to fit his body into it and rest \nthere. He poked his head into it, to make sure there wasn&#39;t any little \nanimal ready to bite his face. It was empty and dark inside. With his \nsomewhat poor sense of smell, he sniffed. He didn&#39;t smell anything that \nseemed threatening. It was just a dirty, moldy smell.\n\nHe crawled inside, a little too easy, since he hadn&#39;t had anything to eat in \ndays. He was loosing weight...fast. He never got to grab anything for \nhimself since his return from Asia. He was starving. But for now, all he \nwanted to do was rest. Food would come later.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
