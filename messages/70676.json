As\nMaxima came down two large birds flew up, protesting her sudden\npresence in thier area and they began to circle her. However after a\nmoment they flew back over to a large well built nest positioned on\nthe edge of a branch. Small &#39;cheeping&#39; noises could be heard coming\nfrom within.\n\nAs Maxima scanned, sensors reported back primarilly virgin landscape.\nBeyond the broken ground from the mining activities of the city, the\nrest of the landscape was rolling forests and hills. A few rivers\nflowed through, and in the distance animals could be detected creeping\nback into the edges of the devestated area.\n\nAround the city were the occasional patrols of tanks, jets,\nmulti-wheeled, and even a chopper or two, but for the most part it was\nquiet. As Maxima was at the edge of things most of this did not come\nin her direction. If she chose Maxima would be able make out the\ndistant forms of Hydras, Terrorsaur, Waspinator, Tarantulus, and\nInferno, as well as the fuzors that were with him: Injector, Buzzclaw,\nTerrorgator, and Quickstrike. Around them were several tanks, one of\nthem, apparently they were attempting to take them into the city.\n\n(TAG)\n\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
