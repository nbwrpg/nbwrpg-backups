He \nwalks to a console and presses a few buttons, the programm cutting \nitself off.\n\n&quot;Interesting,&quot; he mutters, reading through a log of the procedure, \n&quot;She isn&#39;t accepting the new programming...&quot;\n\nTapping a few keys, he brings up further reports on Squizzy. Her \nsystems were designed to ressist new programming? Zardus growls, \nlooking across the room at the skinned body of Soundwave (Scattershot \ntook the outer armor).\n\n&quot;Some surgery is in order here...&quot;\n\nHe walks over to Soundwave, detatching part after part untill he \nholds up a computer board.\n\n&quot;The main proccessor,&quot; he says to Feline, walking back to Squizzy, \n&quot;We&#39;ll simply replace her main functions.&quot;\n\nWith that, he lays the proccessor on a table nearby, proceeding to \ntry to open Squizzy&#39;s torso.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; The program was running through her body. From her own programming, \n&gt; she had installed a reprogramming block in her internal systems.  \nIt \n&gt; recongnized the new programs as unauthorized and her origianl \n&gt; programs tried to fight the new one being introduced by Feline.  \nHer \n&gt; body started to convulse and shake wildly on the table.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Feline::\n&gt; She looked up from the computer sceeen and saw that the program \nthat \n&gt; Zardus told her to install wasn&#39;t working and the mainframe was \n&gt; rerouting the programs.  She heard a banging noise and looked up to \n&gt; see the femme going into convulsions. &quot;DAMN!&quot; She opened her link \nto \n&gt; Zardus, &quot;I got trouble in the lab.  That new bot that you brought \nin \n&gt; here is rejecting your program.&quot;  Feline tried to help the computer \n&gt; and possably just erase the bot&#39;s programs completely.  But the \n&gt; mainframe couldn&#39;t get threw the program blocks. \n&gt; \n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; Her internal programs were designed to fight off viruses and un \n&gt; authorized programs from entering her main program core.  She had \n&gt; also installed back up programs, so in the event that her programs \n&gt; had somehow managed to be bypassed, they would upload all her \norignal \n&gt; programs and restore her to her original state. Her body struggled \n&gt; and shook under the straps. Her arms waved, her head jerked, and \nher \n&gt; legs kicked as her programs tried to fight off the new program.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feline::\n&gt; She worked as fast as she could to keep up kept rerouting the \n&gt; programs. &quot;Zardus, I need you in here.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
