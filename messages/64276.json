This was the first attack in a\nnew War, the first blow. At the same time, he feared what the\nPredacons, all of them, would do. For now, though, he had no other\nchoice. He had to show the Minions that the Silver Wings were not\ngoing down... or at least not alone.\n\nRazorWing: Shieldings Battalion, prepare to board for immediate low\norbit intervention. Shieldings Battalion, prepare for immediate action.\n\nThe Shieldings battalion was not the fastest nor the strongest the\nSilver Wings had mustered, but they were a vigorous and resistant\nunit. Razorwing trusted their abilities to defend the station.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, the Blackfeather warship was launched. It was\ngoing to engage the minions, then unload the troops it transported to\noffer a maximum resistance.\n\nThe Silver Wings, however, had kept hidden their starship development\nprogram. Razorwing knew he would hear it from the other Lord.\n\nBut he had other business to do, and they would have to answer too.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
