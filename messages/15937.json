Rizopas watched Sharpedge while he left.\nDeemos ordered Plintissa to come. It was in her mind that she had to come,\neven if she didn&#39;t want to, which she didn&#39;t, she had to. Deemos was\ndelighted to see Plintissa come with them. He would rather have her than\nGangon. Tesifier laughs as he finishes his rehearsal for the killing of\nKitKat and follows the group.\n\n&quot;Serge, where are you?&quot; Deemos asked through comm.\n\n&quot;Fighting with a Predacon, a new one.&quot; Serge says back. Doom Ice stands back\nand lets Serge have his fun. Airbomber and Time Warp watch them go.\n\n&quot;They have so much fun that they never include us in. Is it because we&#39;re\nsmall?&quot; Time Warp asks.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s because we aren&#39;t loyal.&quot; Airbomber says. They both watch these bots\nleave.\n\n&quot;Hey!
