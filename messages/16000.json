Watching Spears kiss him must \nbe \n&gt; making Striker lose all hopee. Prebon eally had no interest in \nSpears \n&gt; because he had a bot back home, but he would do anything to see \nbots \n&gt; suffer. And on top of that, Spears didn&#39;t even realize that she was \n&gt; hurting Striker.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, let us go to the bridge, so we can map out how to get \nRamulus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He kissed her on the cheek, laughin on the inside about Striker, \ntook \n&gt; her by the arm and started walking towards the bridge.\n\n\n"}}
