He was beginning to get very bored.  He looked at Condor.\n&gt;    \n&gt;          &quot;Hey buddy, I don&#39;t like this either, but apparently, I&#39;md doing it for the good of my health.  So just do as your expected here,&quot; He warned.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;            Skullgrin arrived at the Decepticon base, tired from constantly switching back and forth from walking to driving in tank mode to walking and tank mode.  He went into the Decepticon base.  Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t be found as an enemy to anybody here.  He roamed the base, when he saw \nTriggerhappy.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey!  You!!  Triggerhappy!!  Nice to see you!  Haven&#39;t seen you for several hundred years!&quot; He greeted.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Triggerhappy laughed for a few seconds, then looked at Condor, then at Skullgrin.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;What&#39;re you doing right now?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Skullgrin looked at Condor in the cell, then got a grin.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;Well, how would you like it if I said I was relieving you of guard duty?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;              Triggerhappy grinned a grin of relief.\n&gt; \n&gt;              &quot;Would you?  Thanks, now I can do other stuff!&quot; He said, walking away.\n&gt; \n&gt;              Skullgrin went up to the cell, and sat down, but had his gun ready to fire at this Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &quot;You Maximals could really turn out to be pests.  Listen, so-called Autobot descendant, when you&#39;re around me, you better fear me.  It is a sign of respect, but more importantly, it is perfectly logical.  I am one of the most evil Decepticons you&#39;ll ever meet, so you better sleep \nwith one eye open!  That is, if you live long enough to get some sleep,&quot; He said, in a truely evil tone.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Orchestra nodded slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Hmm, if we can disable this enemy&#39;s shields, I can sneak into their base and hopefully retrieve valuable propaganda,&quot; He said,&quot;Sound like a plan?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
