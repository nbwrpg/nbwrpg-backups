Them having good times together as they get older. =\r\n And then, DrillBit&#39;s death is shown.  And images of Wolfenstein grieving e=\r\nxtremely, so much sadness.  Skulletron then begins to bring out the voices =\r\nand images combined.  Multiple voices in Tyrael&#39;s mind, telling him that th=\r\nis battle is pointless, telling him that its murder, telling him about peac=\r\ne, about sadness, and to make an alliance.  The voices and images show happ=\r\niness among the Tripreds and Predacons together.  All in attempts to sway T=\r\nyrael&#39;s emotions and convince him to call this battle off and join for peac=\r\ne and happiness...\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0058_01C255F1.F666B280\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2719.2200&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;: : Skulletron : \n:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dce=\r\nnter&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\nalign=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Skulletron suddenly shudders, an=\r\nd is \ndistracted from what he is doing.&nbsp; The Soul Orb&#39;s call strongly =\r\nenters \nSkulletron&#39;s mind.&nbsp; After struggling to make sense of it, it f=\r\ninally quits \ntaking its toll on him.&nbsp; However, in recieving the call,=\r\n he also had \nvisions.&nbsp; Visions of the Orbs, visions of Empath, and un=\r\nexplainable \nvisions.&nbsp; He looks over at Wolfenstein and Tyrael, and th=\r\nen prepares.&nbsp; \nHe connects his mind with Tyrael&#39;s mind.&nbsp; After ex=\r\nploring his mind a little \nbit, Skulletron gets down to the dirty work.&nbs=\r\np; He starts to send strong \nimages to Tyrael&#39;s mind.&nbsp; Pictures of tra=\r\nnsformers battling mindlessly flow \ninto Tyrael&#39;s mind.&nbsp; And then, Sku=\r\nlletron starts to send visions of \nTyrael&#39;s past into Tyrael&#39;s mind.&nbsp; =\r\nAnd then, pictures of Wolfenstein come \nin.&nbsp; Wolfenstein and DrillBit,=\r\n as young bots, playing like brothers \ndo.&nbsp; Them having good times tog=\r\nether as they get older.&nbsp; And then, \nDrillBit&#39;s death is shown.&nbsp; =\r\nAnd images of Wolfenstein&nbsp;grieving \nextremely, so much sadness.&nbsp; =\r\nSkulletron then begins to bring out the voices \nand images combined.&nbsp; =\r\nMultiple voices in Tyrael&#39;s mind, telling him that \nthis battle is pointles=\r\ns, telling him that its murder, telling him&nbsp;about \npeace, about sadnes=\r\ns, and to make an&nbsp;alliance.&nbsp; The voices and images \nshow happines=\r\ns among the Tripreds and Predacons together.&nbsp; All in attempts \nto sway=\r\n Tyrael&#39;s emotions and convince him to call this battle off and join for \np=\r\neace and happiness...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0058_01C255F1.F666B280--\r\n\n"}}
