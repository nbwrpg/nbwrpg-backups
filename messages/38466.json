Meshes of wire overlapped some remaining armour.

He brought his other hand overtop, and\n&gt; closed it around Slaughter&#39;s head, a hand capable of excerting over 100\n&gt; tons per square inch of pressurs, and waiting for the word. He hand\n&gt; engulfed the top of Slaughter&#39;s head.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
