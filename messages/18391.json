Not enough time to \ndive under it, the Alliance commander puts up his hands to block the shot, \nhis launcher overloading and shutting down.\n\nCalmly, he replaces his broken weapon with an automatic rifle, firing two \ndozen bolts at the big autogun.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTwo missiles hit trees near Bloodystrike, the Alliance bot diving for cover. \nHe looks at Sharpedge through the foliage, firing a missile at the bot.\n\nOne missile left in the missile launcher, Bloodystrike puts it away, taking \nout his rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica flies upward, a few optic shots hitting his legs but the majority \nof the firepower passing under him.\n\nHe turns to look at Jetstorm, firing two missiles at the bot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer emerges from the forest at the Alliance base, looking around.\n\n&quot;Hey,&quot; he says, walking up to Serpentor, Nemesis, and Scattershot, &quot;There&#39;s \nstill a battle goin&#39; on at those guys&#39; base. If yer not too damaged, you can \nhelp. Zardus asked me to clean up here, though.&quot;\n\nHe turns his head, looking at Vampra&#39;s body on the ground. Walking over to \nher, he picks her up, entering the base and heading toward the CR chambers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWarMachine flinched as Mobster&#39;s shots dug into him, leaving scorch marks. He \nwas starting to lose mechfluid at a fast rate, as well as quickly running low \non energy.\n\nAiming his gun at the bot&#39;s chest, he pulls the trigger, a couple of missiles \nalong with alot of plasma shots streaming out toward the enemy gestalt&#39;s \nchest.\n\n"}}
