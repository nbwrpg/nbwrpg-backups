No threatening people over the RPG mail string or over email in \ngeneral, because #1 even if you say you are into witch craft, im guessing \nabout umm almost everyone doesnt believe you. #2 Its email, how can you \nthreaten a person through email? &quot;Oh Im gonna kick your ass!&quot; Yeah sure,  \ncome on down to the east coast spend a thousand a dollars or so and show up \nat my door with a bat and then MAYBE i&#39;ll take you seriously, or I might just \nthink your a delusional psycho and have your ass shot by either cop that \nlives about 2 seconds from my house with a walk.
