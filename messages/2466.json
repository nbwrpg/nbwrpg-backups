They almost looked clumsy and awkward but in the air they were acrobatic marvels, or so she had learned from watching Prowl a few times.\nShe sighed but nodded, he had his point.\nBut then she thought of how he would catch her, obviously Velociraptors weren&#39;t made to dangle from an owl&#39;s talons by their own clawed hands. She looked up at Prowl but then glanced back, it was then that she suddenly thought of a way. She watched her tail twitch a but and the thought formed even more, Prowl could swoop down and grab hold of her tail!\nIron Raptor then almost seemed to winch at the thought of how uncomfortable that would be but if she then swung up and grabbed her tail in her claws then maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt so much. Maybe.\nShe then looked up at Prowl in the tree closest to her, there was no harm in trying. But if it failed then the worst thing that would happen was her landing straight on her snout! She then narrowed her eyes at that thought, not something that she&#39;d prefer but they were wasting time just standing around like this.\nBut then she suddenly looked back at her tail, what if it couldn&#39;t handle it? What if she was to heavy for it to keep her up and suddenly...tore off?! That thought caused a shiver to flow down her spine and then the idea of simply hanging from her clawed hands looked a whole lot better! That was it, claws it was to be.\nNot to mention if she happened to fall then she would be landing on her feet.\nIron Raptor looked up at Prowl but then turned away from him so that he caught her so she could look straight ahead. She shook out her arms and flexed her claws, they had to get going before the meeting started.*\n\n&quot; Sounds good enough. Whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
