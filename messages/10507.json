She was a little \nworried.  She only had her optic lazars.  All her other weapons were \ngone.  She remembered her lock pick set and burglery kit.  But that \nwouldn&#39;t be much help in a battle like this one was turning into. She \nlooked up at Quickstrike and whispered,&quot;Good to be fighting with you \nagain commander.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Black Aracnia leads the way down the hall. Behinde her \nParalysis, \n&gt; Quickstrike, and Darkmouse follow. She was headed for the bridge to \ntake over \n&gt; once and for all.\n&gt;     The doors slide open and Black Aracnia enters. Paralysis \nsignals to the \n&gt; others to stay put until Aracnia said what she needed to say. &quot;Wait \nhere. \n&gt; Aracnia is gonna tell him off.&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia stands before Rampage. &quot;Now, Rampage. I have control of \nthis \n&gt; ship, and several armed associates that will fight along with me. \nLet me rule \n&gt; the Predacons with Megatron now, peacefully, or refuse and die. I \nhate to be \n&gt; so blunt...but were short on time.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
