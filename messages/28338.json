His only alternative now was to get up and get some repair. \nInternal systems were damaged, as well as the extra damage that \nBeastbox had just done, which had taken out another armor plate. \nFirearm transforms into robot mode, flying up at full speed. He \npoints at Beastbox with his arm cannon, firing two explosive charges.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; All Beasbox could see was the looming shadow of the tank about to \nhim him,\n&gt; he fire up as many times as he could, but the shadow grew very \nlarge over\n&gt; top of him. He tried to leap out of the way, but the huge tank \nlanded right\n&gt; on top of him. A sickening thud resounded all around. (He isnt \ntotally\n&gt; flat, so Firearm will be sort of on a small bump)\n\n\n"}}
