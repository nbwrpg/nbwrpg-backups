I don&#39;t think you should be sad about that.)\n\nOn top of the mountain top, Soundwave had done it. He had built the \nmachine to create the TM3&#39;s. Vulois was already in it. Artificial \nlighting struck and the process began. You could hear howls and \nscrams coming from Vulois which probably could&#39;ve been heard around \nthe planet. Once it was done, you could see the difference. His Beast \nmode was vague. It was more of a shape than actual organics, but it \nwas enough to protect from energon. He had sharp claws, and rows of \nteeth.  He tried out his flying skills. He could make turns better, \nand was alot faster. He decided to try out his new mode.\n\n&quot;Vulois, Tank Mode!&quot;\n\nHis neck went forward and snapped back. The body went into the form \nof a large square and sprouted wheel. The neck went into the position \nof the large cannon, which could launch missles loaded with \nexplosives. He then transformed to Robot Mode.\n\n&quot;Vulois, Terrorize!&quot;\n\nYou could see his new strength. Everything about him was bigger. He \npulled out his two blasters, which could now had two holes to fire \nout of. He also had jets at the back so he could fly in robot mode.\n\n&quot;This is terrific. Your turn Soundwave.&quot;\n\nHe entered the pod and Vulois started pressing the buttons. In \nmoments the process was finished, and out stepped the new Soundwave. \nHe looke like.....(I&#39;ll let you finish that Alloran.)\n\n\n\n"}}
