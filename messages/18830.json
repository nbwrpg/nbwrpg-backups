She could \ntell that something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t tell or see what it was.  \nShe yelled again,&quot;HEEELLLPPPP! SOMEONE HELP!&quot;  She wiggled under the \nstraps and tried to move, but the straps were too tight.  She was \nstarting to panic.  Then she stopped moving as she heard the walls \naround the lab groan and whine.  The lab wasmade of re-enforced \nbeamed and usually the last thing to go in a ship.  Now she was part \nof a beam fall from the ceiling and watched it fall, missing her and \nthe table by a few inches, then a loud crash as it hit the floor.\nShe screamed out again and hoped that someone would hear her.   \nShe tried to move her head up to cut throught the straps with her \noptic lazars, but her head was atrapped down to the table.  She \nstarted crying out of fear.  Being a warrior meant being brave in \nbattle, but the warrior trainer&#39;s manual never mentioned anything \nabout staying on a table, waiting to die.  She shook under the straps \nand yelled out again.  Then part of the wall started to come down.  \nIt fell on top of her,tipping the table over on it&#39;s side.  She was \npinned between the table and a cabinet.  She was hit all over from \nfalling debrie and metal as the room came down around her.  She was \nhit in the head by a large chunk of metal from the ceiling.  She was \nknocked out cold. Still strapped to the table, now on it&#39;s side. \n\n\n"}}
