If she wishes to talk, then we shall talk.&quot;\n\nShe made the detour to the bridge and looked at the console.  It was \nsimilar to waht she had used in the past.  She pushed a few buttons \nand brought up the commlink onto the console speaker. &quot;Alright, where \nand when does Black Aracnia wish to hold this talk?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sorry I have been outta town and havent really had time to \npost...and of \n&gt; course I lost all the things I wanted, like Trinity, and Darkmouse.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hell Beast cursed. The kitten was gone.....just like that. His \nmission \n&gt; was a joke, how was he supposed to do this, with one person. The \nsenate \n&gt; member who sent him here did it to get rid of him. This was a \npunishment, not \n&gt; a privilage.\n&gt;     &quot;Gremlin.....we have left Black Aracnia. She is a fool. Now, we \nare going \n&gt; to find Megatron and help him. The Predacon Council will pay for \nsending me \n&gt; here.....everyone will pay!&quot; He said with bitter hatred in his old \ngruff \n&gt; voice.\n&gt;     &quot;Where are we going to find Megatron?&quot; Gremlin said, a loyal \nyes-man who \n&gt; would follow his leader into the Inferno. &quot;And what makes you think \nhe wont \n&gt; kill us?&quot;\n&gt;     The only place he could be would be in Ominous Primes lair. \nThere are no \n&gt; toher bases, old or new, he could be in. And Megatron isnt an \noutdoor bot, he \n&gt; cant rough it. He needs a luxury suite. Now, lets go.&quot;\n&gt;     And with that, Hell BEast and Gremlin set out towrds the great \nnorth \n&gt; artic region.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aaracnia shighed. She wanted to join the Predacons together but \nit wasnt \n&gt; working out. It was to much for one bot to do....it was time to get \nfriends. \n&gt; She was going to call Kitkat. If she would let her group join, they \ncould \n&gt; make one big Predacon group, and then others would join, and if \nthey didnt \n&gt; join they would be conqured and forced to join.\n&gt;     &quot;Paralysis, get Kitkat on the comm, I want to talk to her.&quot; She \nsaid, and \n&gt; then turned to see Quickstrike and Cyber Claw enter the \nbridge. &quot;And what do \n&gt; we owe the pleasure of this visit?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis called Kitkat, or her base at least. &quot;This is \nParalysis, of the \n&gt; Predacons under Black Aracnia. She wishes to speak to you, its very \n&gt; important.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
