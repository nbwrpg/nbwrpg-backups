Some 120K families were out of electricity, and I&#39;ve been 40 hours without electricity.  And I still am without power.  I&#39;m at my dad&#39;s work, and I&#39;m checking my mail at the CS webpage.  I&#39;ve noticed a lot of incoherent posts.\n\nFor one, THE CYBERTRONIAN FIRE IS IN A HUGE WIDE GRASSLAND!  THE GRASS IS RATHER SHORT BY THE WAY IN THAT AREA!  THere&#39;s no where to hide!  THere are no trees!  No bodies of water!  It&#39;s all level!  And you can stab jets in the back with a sword.\n\nSo, I expect to be out of power for about 16 hours.  Then I won&#39;t be on for probablya nother 4.  So, I&#39;m going to ask Yan for the first itme to officially pause the battle.  Because I&#39;m gonna have to read 300 e-mails, and not to brag, but I play a rather important role in this battle.\n\nExcuse me for the spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes, but I&quot;ve got to go now.  So Yan, please, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS UNHOLY, PAUSE THE BATTLE!\n\n\nL. Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\nPS: Can I borrow a generator?  Thanks.\n\n"}}
