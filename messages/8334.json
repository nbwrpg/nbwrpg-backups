She backed up and \nturned, running. She kicked up her hooves. Behind her, she left a lingering \nimage of a blanket of darkness. It was her way of hiding herself when she \nmade her retreat.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
