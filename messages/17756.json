In fact this bot may even know more about \nwhat they were doing than she did. Lady Hawk decided to play with \nthis for as long as she could. &quot;This equipment is primative compared \nto what I&#39;m used to, maybe you can be of use to me after all.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; She felt upset that this bot would treat her so rudely after just \n&gt; meeting like this.
