I highly doubt Dinobot or=\r\n anyone else wants ta get tangled up with my brother when he&#39;s in a bad moo=\r\nd.  If he was here right now, just one look into his narrowed eyes would im=\r\nmediately halt the behaviors we just saw right now.   Leo knows him best so=\r\n he doesn&#39;t usually lose it around him but if he was here at this moment, h=\r\ne would have a lot of us turning a nice shade of white right about now.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yeah, true.  Leo , Sir, I think this ain&#39;t gonna wo=\r\nrk too well without the big guy here.  We really need ta find him.  No offe=\r\nnse but, he&#39;s the one who put this together and I don&#39;t think Hydras can ke=\r\nep things in line without that extra boost from Wings.  Two dragons are bet=\r\nter than one, and right now we need that balance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot raise=\r\ns a brow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Two dragons are better than one....  Master Yoketron once =\r\nsaid that when he was training my brother and Nightshift.  Leo, That&#39;s it! =\r\n Rattrap&#39;s right!  We need ta find my brother before all else!  Hydras!  Yo=\r\nu&#39;ll think I&#39;m off my rocker but believe me if Master Yoketron said this it=\r\n&#39;s gotta be true!  Two dragons are better than one.  One representing good =\r\nand the other representing evil.  One balances out the other and together t=\r\nhey form a power which can stand to be undefeated.  It&#39;s an old tale but it=\r\n applies here.  Leo, please trust me on this, because it could really depen=\r\nd on how things play out.  You gotta find my brother and bring him back her=\r\ne.. ta Hydras.  Hydras, you and Tucson are those dragons.  Together you can=\r\n form a powerful bond that no other force can defeat.  Not even Magmatron. =\r\n Okay that might be pushing it but it&#39;s so worth a try.&quot;\n\n\nThat earned a la=\r\nugh from DINOBOT, &quot;Oh, waht is this about DRAGONS?  WOuld not your sensei h=\r\nave told you that is it not the alt mode, but the spark wtihin?  An alt mod=\r\ne is merely a shell of what is.  To be changed as necessary,b ut no more us=\r\neful than any other.  A dragon..  Is a popular but a sign of weakness.  For=\r\n it is a sign of one who thinks bigger is better.  But it is a sign of weak=\r\nness.&quot;\n\nGrinning, &quot;And you Maximals seem to lose sight so easily, upon gett=\r\ning orders within nanoclicks you are back to baiting again.  And what would=\r\n your sensei think of a pack of you going around like addled protoforms?&quot;\n\n=\r\nGrinning, &quot;And yes, Yoketron.  I believe my own..  Teacher knew him well.&quot;\n=\r\n\nLaughing, &quot;Right before he tore out the senile old one&#39;s spark.  Knowledge=\r\n of many styles, master of none, he fell so easily in the end.&quot;  Whether a =\r\nmore blatant baiting or not now..\n\nGrinning, &quot;And I believe BLUDGEON sent h=\r\nis regards when his shredded old carcass was sent to whatever Pit you Maxim=\r\nals dig up your useless warriors from and asked for a refund.  He was hardl=\r\ny a fight.&quot;\n\nWhether hte words were true or not, the name of BLUDGEON, the =\r\nDecepticon Pretender Overlord, the Master of Metallikido..  \n\n&quot;I believe Bl=\r\nudgeon said &#39;send my regards to those whom you will be joining I have alrea=\r\ndy sent, and he met his oblivion&#39;.&quot;  Grinning ferally as he gave a mocking =\r\nbow.\n\n\n"}}
