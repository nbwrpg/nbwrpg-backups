It was timr for the main event, and as soon\nas Stone Cold Steve Austin&#39;s music hit, the transmission was interupted.\nThe IGL message played. A smile came across Epyon&#39;s face. This was\ninteresting. He set the comp he had been watching to communication mode.\nIt recorded a message and sent it.\n&quot;This is Captain Epyon. I am from Iron Raptor&#39;s Maximal group. I would\nlike to enter into your regular competition.&quot; The message was relayed\nover and over back to the IGL ship.\n\nEpyon thinks for a sec, and then opens a comm to Hot Rod.\n&quot;Hey Hot Rod, come to my location. There is something you might be\ninterested in seeing.&quot;\n\n::Hot Rod::\n\n&quot;Epyon, I&#39;m kinda in a training session right now.&quot;\n\n&quot;It will just take a few minutes,&quot; Epyon says.\n\n&quot;Ok, Ok. I&#39;ll be there in a minute.&quot; Hot Rod turns to Iron Raptor.\n&quot;Please excuse me.&quot; He walks out and follows the signal from Epyon, and\nheads to the room.\n\n"}}
