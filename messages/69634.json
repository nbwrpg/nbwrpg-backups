Hydras reply comes as a shoc=\r\nk to the Autobot, as he gives a blank look all of a sudden.  He could not a=\r\nnswer his question without hesitation in his voice.\n\n&quot; As - as far as I kno=\r\nw, I - I...  I - don&#39;t think I&#39;m related to him. I deeply admire him, yes, =\r\nbut I honestly do not think I&#39;m related to him.&quot;\n\nHis deeply hidden power o=\r\nf his spark recedes and quickly returns him to his regular height.  He had =\r\nno notion of how to control it, nor had he known what it was.  As it revers=\r\nes, he suddenly feels a good portion of power leave his body, yet, he was n=\r\not about to abandon the act of defending himself against Hydras or Rodimus =\r\nfor that matter. \n\n&quot; Power or no power, you&#39;ve abducted one of my own, and =\r\nturned him into your evil pawn.  No matter the consequence, I will stand my=\r\n ground and do whatever it takes to rightfully return my leader to his role=\r\n as the commander of the Autobots.  Even if I have to saccrifice my own spa=\r\nrk to accomplish my mission.  That is why I&#39;m here, not for power, not for =\r\nlust, not for domination.  I&#39;m here because know it or not, someone who was=\r\n once very close to me, needs my help and I never turn my hand away when a =\r\nfellow comrade is in grave danger.  I&#39;m sure you would do the same for one =\r\nof your own.&quot;  \n\nHe turns to Rodimus.  \n\n&quot; If I do not succeed this time, I=\r\n will suffer my defeat honorably.  I will fall many times if I have to.  Bu=\r\nt rest assured Rodimus, when the time is right, and you finally reach out t=\r\no me, I promise my hand will be there to reach out to you.  And when I do, =\r\nI won&#39;t let go. I promise, I will not abandon you or this cause.  As dark a=\r\ns you are now, you may not understand, but hopefully one day, you will.&quot;  \n=\r\n\nHe then turns back to Hydras.\n\n&quot; All right Hydras, I&#39;ll let you decide how=\r\n you wish to fight.  After all, this is your domain, and I am an intruder h=\r\nere. &quot; \n\nDeep down Tucson wished he could avoid a scuffle.  He wished he co=\r\nuld just bargain with Hydras but after seeing that he was a combination of =\r\nMegatron and Galvatron, that made for a different situation all together.  =\r\nTo him, Decepticons were still his enemies.  He was however still taken aba=\r\nck by Hydra&#39;s question.  While he looks to Hydras he thinks to himself once=\r\n more.\n\n&quot; Me? Related to Optimus Prime?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;a=\r\nirly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; Hydras stood up slowly in a non treaten =\r\nway, and camly walked a round the Scene watching the battle when Tucson loo=\r\nked like more like Optimus and he said &quot;Yesss, this will be like the old go=\r\nod times... tell me Scrappling, what&#39;s your relation with My old Pal, Optim=\r\nus Prime?&quot; said  hydras with a remarcable ironic mocking tone in the word p=\r\nal \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Super Cyclonus \n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 19, 2010 1=\r\n1:24 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: Recovering Rodimus/Bla=\r\nckFortress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; The battle was not what it seemed . . . \n&gt;  \n&gt; The =\r\npunch Rodimus had thrown, the one that was so easily blocked by Tuscon, wou=\r\nld have shocked Rodimus had it landed. He would have been glad to be rid of=\r\n this annoyance, yes, but it would have been somewhat disappointing as well=\r\n. \n&gt;  \n&gt; So when Rodimus was spun around by Tuscon, the Autobot may have mi=\r\nssed the wicked smile on his face, When Tuscon tried to ram Rodimus into a =\r\nwall, he may not have noticed that the sound of crunching metal was not Rod=\r\nimus&#39; but the reinrorced wall shearing and tearing under the force of the a=\r\nssault. It was not the sound of Rodimkus&#39; defeat that resonated through the=\r\n room, but it was something else!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many of the same teachers that had =\r\ninstructed Tuscon had trained a young Hot Rod as well -  Jazz, Prowl, Brawn=\r\n, Kup, even Optimus himself! And while Rodimus no longer clearly remembered=\r\n all these ones and what they had meant to him, thier lessons were still gr=\r\nound into him, and his reflexes that had been honed over the years of battl=\r\ne! \n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, this was no young Hot Rod that stood there before them, but=\r\n a figure shapped by the energy of the matrix into a character of leadershi=\r\np, power and ability. He no longer had access to the knowledge and wisdom o=\r\nf the matrix, the energy having been stripped from him. But that power that=\r\n had been imparted was still there, reconfigured by the power of the predac=\r\non shell program! He was faster, stronger and far more durable then Hot Rod=\r\n ever was, he was DARK RODIMUS!\n&gt;  \n&gt; So when Rodimus hit the wall it was n=\r\not truely pain that he felt, but the elation that a true battle was in the =\r\nmaking. He felt that charge that all warriors felt when they faced a foe th=\r\nat had some metal! It was an eagerness twisted by Predacon programming into=\r\n something dark and loathsome. \n&gt;  \n&gt; So when he stood and turned around it=\r\n was not defeat in his stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a =\r\nPrime do you, scrappling?&quot; Rodimus said his tone still mocking as he raised=\r\n his arm, smiling as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what y=\r\nou got!&quot; With a thought he fired a blast of plasma energy from his arm moun=\r\nted cannon at this new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the moment appeared t=\r\no be posturing for Hydras!\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC: Remember, the matrix that is housed w=\r\nithin Rodimus has no energy of its own, only the housing. It does not have =\r\nthe power to reach out and transform anyone, although I do have some ideas.=\r\n I am not sure if you want to redo your post, or let it go as it stands. \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Dark rodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
