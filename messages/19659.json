Slayer gliding \nin closer, his shoulder blasters take aim again.\n\nHe hesitates before firing again, unable to give the command to \ndestroy this bot. What was wrong with him? Why couldn&#39;t he kill a \nnormal Maximal?\n\nRoaring in frustration, Slayer aims a laser rifle at Lunarpine, \nclenching his fists as hard as he could to pull the trigger, bolts \nstreaming out toward Lunarpine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Fool, I do compare to the pit!&quot; Slayer growls\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine laughed. that was the first thing the two wolves agreed \non since\n&gt; Slayer was Striker. Lunarpine crossed his claws again blocking the \nlasers\n&gt; Slayer fired at him.\n&gt; &quot;I agree, you are like the Pit, you keep going on without end. but \nenough\n&gt; about your talking I&#39;m still waiting for you to atack. Or is this \nthe best\n&gt; you got?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine soon ate his words as a missle struck his crossed claws \nknocking\n&gt; him off balance. A second missle struck him in the shoulder causing \na gaping\n&gt; rip in his frame. The bot stumbled to the ground holding his wound.\n&gt; Lunarpine knew that beast mode would heal him but would leave him \nvulnerable\n&gt; for another attack. he had to stay in bot mode to fight. Slayer was\n&gt; hesitating, Lunarpine didn&#39;t know for sure why but decided to act \ninstead of\n&gt; dwell on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wolfbot curled up trying to protect the wound. &quot;Come on \ntoughbot live up\n&gt; to your name. Prove how tough you are. FINISH ME or I&#39;ll come \nlooking for\n545846&gt; you, I have your scent and I WILL FIND YOU!!!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
