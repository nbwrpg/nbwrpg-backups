He raised his launcher, firing a \nrocket off at Icedragon&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nPyro fired off three fire balls, two at the first rocket coming towards him, \nthe last at the other one, the heat possibly able to overheat the rockets and \ncause them to prematurely explode.  He rolled to the right several feet just \nto be cautious.\n\n\n---\n\nDark One laughed as his cockpit glass cracked, deciding this fight was \nworthless.  He dived down, firing off two missiles downward at Steel.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown fired off a grenade set to explode on impact at Shocker&#39;s torso, \nlaughing.\n\n---\n\nScavenger swerved, a few shots digging into his side, missing anything vital \nby inches.  He fired off 20 shells from each machine gun, a total of 40, as \nhe charged Icedragon at full speed, the fourty shells heading for that \nMaximal.\n\n\n===\n\nPunch hopped off of Oinker&#39;s tractor mode, missile launcher at the ready.  He \nfired off a rocket at the Ark.\n\n---\n\nZergling hopped off Oinker.  &quot;For Zardus!&quot; he screamed, taking out his \nrapid-firing laser rifle, firing off twenty bolts at Shadow Wing who was in \nthe air.\n \n---\n\nOinker transformed.  &quot;Finuhly, a challenge for me.  I reckon we&#39;ll kick Maxi \ntail.&quot; he said, firing off three laser bolts from his laser rifle at a \nsemi-repaired autogun.\n\n\n"}}
