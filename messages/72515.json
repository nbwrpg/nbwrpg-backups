Most thought he was\n&gt; dead, =\r\nkilled in a war that seemed to end so long ago. Others thought\n&gt; he gave hi=\r\ns life to end the hate plague, lying in a memorial tomb\n&gt; endlessly floatin=\r\ng through space. Other thought he had risen since\n&gt; then and is still wagin=\r\ng a war against the forces of evil somewhere in\n&gt; the galaxy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trut=\r\nh was far different.\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS PRIME turned and looked around the room a=\r\ns his internal memory\n&gt; proccessors strove to recover his fragmented memory=\r\n of recent events.\n&gt; &quot;I remember the rumors that Grimlockj and his team had=\r\n to be\n&gt; re-educated.&quot; His optics brightened, &quot;But I had no idea that it wo=\r\nuld\n&gt; have meant incarceration. A lot of us had trouble adjusting to\n&gt; peac=\r\neful life, but being locked up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shaking his head RODIMUS finally rose=\r\n to his feet as he disengaged\n&gt; from the medbed. &quot;We have to find them.&quot; RO=\r\nDIMUS said, &quot;We need to see\n&gt; what has been done to them.&quot; RODIMUS began to=\r\n pace across the room,\n&gt; &quot;If there are attacking Autobots or Maximals, then=\r\n I think something\n&gt; has happened to them.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE could not sa=\r\ny what had happened to the legendary OPTIMUS PRIME.  Whether he had retired=\r\n, whether he had been exiled, whether he had become one with the Matrix, ro=\r\n gone off throughout space in search of Decepticons still seeking to harm o=\r\nthers.  All he could say was that Cybertronian society had rapidly turned i=\r\nn the same directions it had at the end of the previous war.\n\nFinally shaki=\r\nng his head, WHEELIE said, &quot;You are in no shape to go.  That I can say, tha=\r\nt I do know.  If you honestly think that we must find out, Iw ill leave and=\r\n go out about.  You can barely walk, much less get itno a fight and talk.  =\r\nI will go loko for the DINOBOTS.  You should join the Maximals and their ta=\r\nlks.  Out of here you should be ready, for in a fight you cannot remain ste=\r\nady.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
