She stalks out of the room \nand down the hall, coming to a stop only when she reaches the main \nentry hatch, where the other Rogues - except Riekan and Jayde - have \nalready gathered.\n\nThose two soon show up as well, Jayde having to jog a little to keep \nup with Riekan&#39;s much longer strides.  Devilcat smiles as he sees the \ngroup fully assembled.\n\nThe Rogue leader quickly outlines his plan. &quot;Here&#39;s the bit.  Torin, \nyou and Jayde keep an eye on the ship - and our &#39;guest&#39;.&quot;  Jayde \npouts at being left behind; Devilcat ignores it and continues \non.  &quot;If you want, you can work on those jammer beacons.  In the \nmeantime, things are coming to a head at the Predacon base.
