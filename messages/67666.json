He had been\nswimming in the giant freshwater lakes for several days when he\nnoticed a disturbance.\n\nLooking up into the sky from underwater, a dark shadow loomed\noverhead.  He swam up fast and as he surface, he flew a good 10 meters\nin the air before his body re-organied and sprouted rockets.  Now in\nflight mode, he could clearly see the shape of a massive floating\nplate with buildings atop it.  He sped up and began flying toward it.\n\n&quot;Hmmmm....&quot; he said, in a tone conveying his intrigue.\n\nOn 11/26/07, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Underwater just offshore from a mighty river in the eastern oceans of the\n&gt; Southern Hemisphere, the earth shifts and a pile of rocks and silt begin to\n&gt; slide.  Several boulders are hurled to the ocean depths and a ghostly figure\n&gt; emerges from the debris.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alive?&quot; exclaimed the voice, turning around to the pile and scanning it\n&gt; feverishly.\n&gt;\n&gt; After a few minutes, he gives up his obsessive scanning, content that what\n&gt; he is looking for is no longer here.  Low on energy, he transforms to beast\n&gt; mode, a metallic manta-ray, and quickly swims off.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
