She felt down.  She could sence \nhis disapproval in her manner of helpfullness.  She just wasn&#39;t sure \nwhat to do.  folow the Predacon sode and let him die out here alone \nand all.  Or pass up the opertunity for some companionship and \nconversation,even for a little while.  She jsut didn&#39;t know what \nwould be better.  She helped him hobble along seeing him get weaker \nas they went.\n\nShe sighed and looked at him. &quot;If you need some energy,I can give you \nsome of mine. We have a long way to go.&quot; she said in a soft and flat \nvoice.  She didn&#39;t know why she even offered. Hadn&#39;t she helped this \nstranger enough?  Appearently not, she thought.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Ya I didn&#39;t think GoldenEye knew BrightBlade)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;          Dollen hoped someone knew of the beautiful fem bot he kept \nseeing\n&gt; in his mind.\n&gt; \n&gt;            &quot;Well, for now, I just want a CR Chamber and get some \nrest.
