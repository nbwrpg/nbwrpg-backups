You\n&gt; two work together&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is a momentary confused look as CYCLONUS glanced at HYDRAS, &quot;Of\ncourse sir.&quot; he said as he opened a communication channel to the new\nPredacon base. &quot;Fractyl, what have you got?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; Came the quick reply. &quot;As I was telling Lord Hydras, who ever\nthat is out there, he is generating some sort of harmonic pulse and I\nbelieve that is what is controlling the beasts. If we can generate an\ninverse of that it should cancel it out.&quot;\n\nCYCLONUS was nodding as FRACTYL talked his optics still wearing that\nconfused look on his face. &quot;Begin transmission.&quot; was CYCLONNUS&#39; reply\nas he closed the communication.\n\n&quot;Yes sir.&quot;\n\nEven as FRACTYL closed his side of the connection the affect was\nalmost immediate. The Predacons had been firing on the dinosaurs and\nkilling them in large nubers, but they had barley put a dent in the\nlarger wave of oncomming flesh.\n\nHowver once CYCLONUS gave the command the dinisaurs began to change.\nThey began to stumble.\n\n&quot;Frag!&quot; came a call over from SABERBACK, &quot;This is your doing, isn&#39;t it\nPredacon!&quot; That last word was said with disdain and venom.\n\nSABERBACK continued to float above the mob of creatures, but the nice\norderly run was quickly degenerating into chaos as the creatures began\nto run in all different directions. They had once been all moving\ntowards HYDRAS&#39; base, but now many of them were running away from it\nor in a different direction completely. Most of them were ignoring the\nPredacons, and those that didn&#39;t were easily dispatched by the\nPredacons themselves.\n\n&quot;You were more intelligent than I gave you credit.&quot; SABERBACK\ntransmitted over the comlink to HYDRAS. &quot;I had imagined that you\nPredacons would freeze in fear.&quot;\n\nIn the distance SABERBACK stopped moving and just gazed at HYDRAS a\ncruel humor on his face. &quot;No matter, I have what I needed. We shall\nmeet again, oh yes count on it.&quot;\n\nSABERBACK was still several miles from HYDRAS, but those with\ntelescopic vision could still make out him pulling out a small device\nand him manipulating the controls. Then in a small shimmer, he\nvanished.\n\nMeanwhile all around the dinosaurs were still continuing to flee in a\nchaotic rush, no longer a real threat to the Predacons. There were a\ngreat many lying dead on the ground, some due to predacon firepower,\nbut also many from being over used by SABERBACK and their bodies just\ngiving out.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
