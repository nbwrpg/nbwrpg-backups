Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to go back =\r\nto Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s not espe=\r\ncially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well when I posd h=\r\nim trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him, please give me a=\r\n cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two times you posed him extens=\r\nively going with your characters when it was not in character for him to do=\r\n so.\n\n  If your characters have had interactions with him in the past or th=\r\nings I should know of, let me know?

If he&#39;s going to b=\r\ne told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a chance to respond app=\r\nropriately if he does or not, or make it something like a specific order in=\r\n the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rather weird how your charac=\r\ners come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opininos and back one ano=\r\nther up to the hilt on thier interactions and everything. I feel kind of we=\r\ndged into a corner by this.\n\n  I understand I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve=\r\n been here much longer, I just feel rather hemmed in on the character with =\r\nwhat you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how things operate, and how you hav=\r\ne all of your alts congregating and making me feel pressed into a corner.\n\n=\r\n  Anyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bit too negative, thank you very m=\r\nuch for the welcome here and for playing wtih me and interacting with Wheel=\r\nie.\n\n  &lt;Back In Character&gt;\n\n  Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, ga=\r\nzes over at him, &quot;What is this with all of you? You&#39;re back and forth whate=\r\nver I do. This is what Prime is, just a rank? It seems like it&#39;s just sort =\r\nof dank.

But we, we were never friends. We went back and forth in our ways=\r\n, and I respect your orders for these days.

I=\r\n&#39;d prefer to keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they try an=\r\nd be nice. But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to do, =\r\nor how you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew.
