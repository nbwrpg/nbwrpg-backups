But he had another dream.  \n\nEverything was black, until the great Autobot hero, Optimus Prime, came in \nfront of him.  &quot;Nemesis Enforcer...the Matrix must speak with you!&quot;\n\n&quot;I thought the Matrix was called: &quot;The Autobot Matrix of Leadership&quot; and it \nheld all the knowledge and such of Autobot leaders, not storing every life \nforce of the Cybertronians?&quot;\n\n&quot;Errr...well...oh...ummm...let&#39;s see...&quot; Optimus said, putting a hand against \nhis chin.  &quot;The Matrix will answer your questions!&quot; Optimus disappeared, a \nview of Cybertron far above.  The view closed in, going through underground \nsectors.  Finally, Nemesis ended up in a dark underground &quot;cavern&quot;.  \n\nIt was indeed a strange place, only a grand staircase visible, carpeted in \nred and purple.  He looked ahead.  He had heard osmething like a loud, \nbooming voice, only it wasn&#39;t like a yell.  It wasn&#39;t even a voice \nreally...it just seemed to come into his head.  Nemesis pondered.  Was this \nthe Matrix, which had been a rumor?  Or just one of those random voices that \ncame up every few blows to the head?\n\n-=YOU ARE NOW INTERFACING WITH THE ORACLE, WHERE THE SPARKS OF ALL WHO LIVED, \nOR ARE GOING TO LIVE MEET.  WELCOMES VULOIS=-   \n\n&quot;Wait, I thought you, the Matrix, held all people&#39;s &#39;sparks?&#39; &quot; Nemesis \nasked, confused.\n\n-=JUST SHUT THE SLAG UP!  I&#39;M NOT PERFECT=-\n\n&quot;Sorry...&quot; Nemesis, beginning to lose.\n\n\n-=Let The Oracle explain. What you saw before, in your last moments of \nconsciousness had a purple. You were not sent to Past Earth as \npunishment, but for a reason. We want you to be our abassador. We \nwant all of Cybertronians interested in making Cybertron organice, dead!  You \nmust unite all the factions, and crush Vulois and the others!  Cybertron has \na tron on the end for a reason!  Unite, and bring the organic lovers to their \nknees!  Forming a new peace.  We want one faction, living inorganically. You \nand two others are too start our peace group. You must build a bomb on \nneutral ground, and hold meetings \nto &quot;return to Cybertron under one organic faction that all \nCybertronians will become&quot;. The four that you should kill with the bomb are \nSoundwave, Battera, Vulois, and Cybershark. They might not die, but you \nmust slaughter them.=-\n\n&quot;What about that bastard Serpentor?  Will he die?&quot;\n\n-=He has not finished outliving his usefulness.  He, and Scattershot will be \nthe ones to start the Third Golden Age of Cybertron=-\n\n&quot;Then I will do it!  Bloodshed...yeess...send me back to the past date I was \nin on that dirtball called Earth!&quot;\n\nNemesis felt like he was going at a super fast speed, until covered him, \nNemesis disappearing.  \n\nWhen he regained sight, he was back on Earth, in the past, in a big dark box \nit seemed.\n\n&quot;This must be where I&#39;ll build the bomb!  Then I&#39;ll kick organic loving skid \nplates!&quot;\n\n"}}
