He had discovered that he could transform to a\n&gt; being\n&gt; &gt; of this planet...but because of the emergency state of his stasis\n&gt; pod\n&gt; &gt; he had be given a form of a plant.  There were many advanteges tho\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; this new being....He transformed into a plant and decided to test\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; abilities...First he tried his defense...With a single thought he\n&gt; grew\n&gt; &gt; to an enormous tree..Planted hard in the ground unable to move\n&gt; &quot;Great&quot;\n&gt; &gt; he thought. I am a frikkin tree.  He shrunk back down to a small\n&gt; &gt; plant...He could control his roots through the ground and he sped\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; through the ground 200 m in all directions and then they\n&gt; &gt; stopped....not a bad limit....he then popped into the ground leaving\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; small hole and instantaneously grew 200 m away from the ends of one\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; his roots....He then agian shot his roots back to where he had come\n&gt; &gt; from and went back....He transformed to a bot. &quot;I should set some\n&gt; &gt; defence up and find out about this planet. He walked around in a\n&gt; &gt; perimeter around his dead pod sticking his finger in the ground\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; times every ten meters. Where his finger had gone in grew 1: a weed\n&gt; 2:\n&gt; &gt; a rose adn 3 : a dandilion.....that should be good enough he\n&gt; thought.\n&gt; &gt; He went back to the pod and startd ripping it apart.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The new bot came too as he realised that he had landed on a new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planet. As soon as his optics logged on he saw the statis pod\n&gt; drop.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The emergency beacon slowly dimmed lighter and lighter. &quot;Shit...&quot;\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said looking at his pod....&quot;All my equipment is ruined.&quot; He got up\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked at himself. He was about 5 feet tall and not very large at\n&gt; all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But he could feel he had incridble speed. He reached to his side\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grabbed two tubes from his hips. He held them both in his hands\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once a firm grip was on thim Energy Whips formed from the\n&gt; end...&quot;Well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I like this....&quot; He then closed his optics off and entered his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brain...he searched for all his new abilites.....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
