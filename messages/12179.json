She sees \nthe Predacons and the Allience team up and try to arradicate the \nMaximals and their base.  She soars high up in the air currents and \nobserves the battle.  She knows she was build as a Predacon.  But \nuntil now, she was still deciding where she should go and who she \nshould join.  She knew that in order to survive, she would have to \npick the strongest group.  And the Maximals were not it.  They were \ngetting destroyed down there.  She felt a little sorry for them.  \nThey were a brave group of bots, willing to die for what they \nbeleived in.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s just what they were doing, dying.\nShe stayed in the upper air currents and just circled above the \nship.  \n\n\n"}}
