It crashes in the \nthick trees and hanging vines of the deep jungle.  The pod scanners \nopen and scan the area for life forms.  After scanning several, the \ninternal pod computer picks the best one from all the life forms \nscanned.  it fashoins the bot inside to fit the form chosen.  The pod \nopens and out emerges a large,tan and spotted feline form.  She steps \nout of the pod and looks around. She had no program as to what she \nwas.  She wasn&#39;t maximal or predacon.  She reached into the pod and \nturned on a homing beakon.  Who ever showed up first was the group \nshe would join.  She contained the programming for both, but had to \nchoose.   She wasn&#39;t able to decide so she left it up to fate to \nchoose for her.  She jumped onto a tree limb. She reclined there and \nwaited for fate to show her the way.  \n\n\n\n\nName: Feline\nFaction: None yet.\nFunction: Fighter,Recon,Computer Systems.\nBot Mode: Has sleek, shiney tan metal skin.\nBeast Mode: Leopard.\n\n\nWeapons:\nLazar optics, Claws, Teeth, botmode=gun mounted on left forearm.\n\n\n"}}
