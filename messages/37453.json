Well it wasn&#39;t exacty standing.  He\n&gt; just happened to be upright on the floor.  He had no way of moving.  He\nwas\n&gt; acctually quite bored.  He needed someone to talk to or fight with or\n&gt; something.  He could still breath and his mouth was open but he couldn&#39;t\n&gt; properly form words.  As a young bot he had practiced the lost art of\n&gt; ventriloquy.  He decided to try his hand at it again.  &quot;Is hare any way to\n&gt; hurn his off?&quot;  (I figured it out, this can be said easily without moving\nthe\n&gt; mouth or tounge.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
