There would be=\r\n neutral\n&gt; ones also where shadowy dealings could be made&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also NPC&#39;s=\r\n chars are including in this idea that will change this RPG.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Question=\r\n is that I  need to know who will post at least once a week, &#39;cause\n&gt; this =\r\nwill help to delevelop to this idea. This and the new plot will affect\n&gt; al=\r\nl chars involved in this RPG and will let a major interacion among chars\n&gt; =\r\nand result a major fun\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; :)\n&gt;  \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;  \n&gt; ********=\r\n****\n&gt; *   Airly   *\n&gt; ***********\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ______________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; Yahoo!
