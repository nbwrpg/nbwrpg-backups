The ground shook as he stepped back a few\n&gt;times\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   to keep his balance after avioding the blade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;LurkerAbyss&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; ::Abominus/Surgital::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;     Abominus moved a little, but was still hit in the head and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   chest by the missiles.  He stumbled back quite far actually, 5\n&gt;steps\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   is kinda far for a gestalt to stumble back from a normal\n&gt;heighted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   warrior&#39;s perspective.  Abominus snarled meanly at Galaxor, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   fired 2 beams from the lazer from his lower chest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;        Surgital heard the lightning bolt, and quickly turned\n&gt;around\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   and side-stepped just in time to avoid the lightning bolt by a\n&gt;speck\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   or two.  Then, Surgital converted his hand into a saw blade\n&gt;again,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   and this time shot the saw blade at Lavatron&#39;s head.  (BTW, the\n&gt;blade\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   was shot vertical, so moving to the side gives a better chance\n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   dodging it.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
