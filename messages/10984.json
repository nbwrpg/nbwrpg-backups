She looks to the monitor to see Brightblades \nsigniture by the Maximal cruiser.\n    &quot;Ah, Brightblade! If you dont know already, Im the current Predacon \nCommander until MEgatron takes command. Im going to download the information \nnow.&quot; She says, very kindly, unlike her true nature.\n    Paralysis begins the download while Aracnia turns to Thunder Hammer. She \nlooks him over, &quot;Ah, for now you can take a break. Take the time to go into \nyour beast mode and hunt, or something. Scout around and see if you cant talk \nto Megatron for me.&quot;\n\n"}}
