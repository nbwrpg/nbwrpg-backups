He didn&#39;t know where it would drop\n&gt; &gt; him off but h=\r\ne knew he had a job to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; All right, it&#39;s time I picked up where=\r\n the old dragon left off.  I have a\n&gt; &gt; planet to help guard and protect AN=\r\nD NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME OR ANYONE\n&gt; &gt; ELSE EVER AGAIN!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With h=\r\nis last words he throws out a thunderous roar.  His pace quickens upon\n&gt; &gt; =\r\napproach of the portal.  He also hoped that if there was anyone on the othe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; side that his voice carried through to the other side, as he roars on=\r\nce\n&gt; &gt; again with even stronger magnitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; TUSCON&#39;s roar ec=\r\nhoed everywhere! Even the walls and floor seemed to\n&gt; resonate with the sou=\r\nnd of it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Having approached the portal, TUSCON was standing inside a r=\r\noom\n&gt; looking at what appeared to be a door way. However instead of it bein=\r\ng\n&gt; constructed of iron and steel it was composed of energy. It appeared\n&gt; =\r\nsimilar in construction the one that he himself had went through when\n&gt; he =\r\nwas being brought into this base.\n&gt; \n&gt; The room itself was fairly non descr=\r\niptive, basic gun metal grey\n&gt; walls, a few monitors and consoles around th=\r\ne room and, besides the\n&gt; door that TUSCON entered, there were two others. =\r\nOther than that the\n&gt; room was barren and quiet, only the slight humming fr=\r\nom the portal\n&gt; could be heard.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVOY, BREAK and MACH KICK entere=\r\nd slowly behind TUSCON their\n&gt; weapons out as they watched TUSCON&#39;s back.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;There are more guards approaching your position.&quot; LONG RACK said over\n=\r\n&gt; their comlink. &quot;What ever you&#39;re going to do you&#39;d better do it\n&gt; quick.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How many?&quot; BIG CONVOY said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All of them?&quot; LONG RACK came back.=\r\n Of course that was probably an\n&gt; overstatement, but one can gather that a =\r\nlot of SHARKTICONS were about\n&gt; to rush through the door soon. However the =\r\nalarms were still going\n&gt; off.\n&gt; \n&gt; CONVOY looked over at TUSCON, &quot;Seems li=\r\nke we got a choice to make. We\n&gt; can face the fire here, or we can take our=\r\n chances through that.&quot; He\n&gt; pointed at the portal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Niether choice see=\r\nmed to be a good one. Not even TUSCON or BIG CONVOY\n&gt; could stand against M=\r\nAGMATRON&#39;s full forces, especially if MAGMATRON\n&gt; himself showed up.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
