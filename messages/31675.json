I think Cyndro is a full bot, except for his body\nis a ship instead of a robot, so he would be able to see who&#39;s helping\nand who&#39;s hurting, and fire on the ones that are hurting. Ask Jen,\nthough, I don&#39;t know much about her ship.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: But there is so much going on, and its all chaotic, how can you\nbe\n&gt; sure you might not hit a wrong target with so many on the field.\nAlso, if\n&gt; they are big and guns, then there is a chance of the blast hitting\npeople\n&gt; that are close.
