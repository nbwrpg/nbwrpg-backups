Some \ninfiltrator she had turned out to be.\nAnd what information she had gathered was now useless, and the Predacon ship \ndidn�t even register on her scanners anymore.\nWhat she knew was enough to make her cringe anyway; the Predacons were being \nlead by far too many new commanders now, and even Hell Beast served instead \nof led now. So, was there any place left for her in the Predacon forces? She \ndoubted it.\nBut for now it was time to rest.\nBrightBlade breathed deeply, finding her spark beat calming down a bit so \nthat she could actually stand straight.\nShe looked back along with Perndabot at the Cybertronian Fire, still \nwondering just how the heck they could have made it out of that hell hole \nalive.\nBrightBlade nodded at Perndabots words.:\n\n� Yeah�about time to! I would have gone nuts if I was in that slag pile a \nmoment longer!�\n\n: BrightBlade uncloaked  and then took the device off her hip, feeling it \nhot from overuse she simply slipped it back into her leg compartment. \nLeaning back against a tree she sighed and put her hands behind her head, \nfailing to see the large Alliance bots optics move over her body before \nlooking at her in disappointment.\nLooking up at him as he asks if she had to return to the Predacons now.:\n\n� I don�t think so. So much has happened while I was gone I don�t think \nthere�s a place for me in their forces anymore.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
