He is a friend of Quickstrike.  We\n&gt; shall return shortly commander.&quot;\n&gt; She looked at Rowdy, &quot;He doesn&#39;t sound happy, let&#39;s get the lead out.&quot;\n&gt; She ran at her top speed for the base.  She got zapped by Megatron\n&gt; once, and didn&#39;t want to happen again.\n&gt;\n&gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt;\n&gt; She stood up as Megatron entered the base.  She offered him an\n&gt; energon cube. &quot;Sir, Quickstrike and Stringtra went out and shall be\n&gt; back soon.  I over heard a transmission from Quickstrike that he\n&gt; found something that might interest you greatly.  KitKat and\n&gt; Terrorsaur will return shortly.  Dracona came here, but we have\n&gt; authorization for access, so I denied it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t afraid of Megatron, she was more afraid of his temper.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::: Hell Beast, with Mosquitor slung over his shoulder who so\n&gt; conveniently\n&gt; &gt; went into stasis during the battle, made his way to the ship.\n&gt; Transanulas,\n&gt; &gt; Jackle, and Gremlin follow him. The see there pursuers, but dont\n&gt; really give\n&gt; &gt; a fuck anymore. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Hell Beast, slumping Mosquitor down in a corridor, goes into\n&gt; his private\n&gt; &gt; CR tank, while the others go in crew tanks. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia smiled as she waded deeper into the muck of the\n&gt; swamp. She\n&gt; &gt; could easily see that there was a stasis pod sticking clear up\n&gt; through it. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Thanks to you....fembots will rule Cybertron!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: She floats the pod to the sore and drags it behinde her.\n&gt; Thankfully, this\n&gt; &gt; neck of the swamp was just a mile away from the Predacon base,\n&gt; which was in\n&gt; &gt; full view. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia, activating the ramp to one of the cargo holds,\n&gt; drags the\n&gt; &gt; stasis pod into the dark room, and closes the ramp. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Demona, her hand resting on her baster approaches. ::: About\n&gt; time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Shut up! It was hard enough to get this thing\n&gt; here.\n&gt; &gt; Now, get ready to transfer the phetus data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Demona inserts a wire from her temple into the main computer to\n&gt; the pod.\n&gt; &gt; Black Aracnia pours over the data and then the transfer begins. A\n&gt; blue bar\n&gt; &gt; appears on the monitor, and it slowly fills with the transfer. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Demona ::: This hurts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Your memory banks are being stressed, its\n&gt; supposed to\n&gt; &gt; hurt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: After a slow hour, the bar fills, the wire is detached, and\n&gt; they both\n&gt; &gt; stand to see what comes out. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: Scince your a T-rex, and hell Beast is a\n&gt; reptile...I\n&gt; &gt; wonder what its form will be...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Demona ::: Is it to late to program it to be a Raptor?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: No....is that what you want?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; :: Demona ::: Yes. Yes it is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Black Aracnia makes the changes and the lid pops open. Stryfe\n&gt; climbs out.\n&gt; &gt; His jade eyes search the room and lock on Demona. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Stryfe ::: Excellent. The data transfer was a success.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Demona ::: Now all you have to do is kill Hell Beast and take\n&gt; the title!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Strye was tall, strong, warrior like. His visable wepons\n&gt; included a sub\n&gt; &gt; machine, optic lasers, and seeker missles. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Stryfe ::: Lets go meet dad.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine lay streached on the table of Ominous Prime. Rescued\n&gt; from the tar\n&gt; &gt; pits, he was vastly damaged and almost unrepairable. Now, he\n&gt; implated the\n&gt; &gt; final data chip in his banks. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine&#39;s eyes lit up just as a flash of lighting broke the cold\n&gt; winters\n&gt; &gt; night. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine ::: The fembot, she shot me!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Ominous ::: Fembot? Dosent matter now. Your repaired.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine ::: Your an enemy to the Commander!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Ominous ::: Oh yes. This war has brought out the worst in us. I\n&gt; saw you\n&gt; &gt; in distress and chose to help you. Is there anything wrong with\n&gt; that?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine shook it off, got up, and looked around the freakish\n&gt; lair of the\n&gt; &gt; scientist. What caught his eye was the vat of liquid energon that\n&gt; the bot\n&gt; &gt; thrived on. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Ominous ::: Now, your to weak to leave here now. Its the dead\n&gt; of winter\n&gt; &gt; and this is the Artic. Its 85&#39; below zero outside. Your mech would\n&gt; freeze.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine ::: Then...your helping me?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Ominous ::: Yes. Im sick of this pathetic war. When your\n&gt; recovered I will\n&gt; &gt; take you to Hell Beast and we will leave the planet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine ::: Leave?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Ominous ::: He has enough enegon, and his mission is complete.\n&gt; We would\n&gt; &gt; benefit from it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine nodded. He longed for Cybertron, and the wa was getting\n&gt; out of\n&gt; &gt; hand. Departure seemed the only way. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron returned and climbed into a CR Tank. When he emerged\n&gt; he turned\n&gt; &gt; to Kitkat for a full report. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron ::: Kitkat, Report!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That whole ark being saved is the biggest Bullshit I have ever seen\n&gt; in this\n&gt; &gt; RPG.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Life&#39;s too short to send boring email.
