He noticed that Alliance memberes were\n&gt;there, but Hot Rod was with them. He went to the controle room for his\n&gt;meeting with Iron Raptor. He needed to get the two memberes of his crew\n&gt;back. He sat down.\n&gt;&quot;Hello,&quot; he said to Iron Raptor.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Well we could probably use some extra hands in repairing the ship. Your\n&gt;welcome to help.&quot;\n&gt;He began working on small sections where the CF had been damaged.\n&gt;\n&gt;::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt;He arrived where DarkFate  was after locking onto signature.\n&gt;He then transformed back to bot mode.\n&gt;&quot;DarkFate, what we do now?
