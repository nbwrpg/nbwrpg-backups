Ignatius put Spears in one CR Chamber, \nand than put himself in another. Prebon laid Striker on a table. He \ncalled to Blaze.\n\n&quot;Where are Bullet and Hammer?&quot;\n\n&quot;They are in the cargo room, building a new war suit.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh. You knw how to do this though, right?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, I did it a few times before I met you, and the only time I \ndidn&#39;t when I was in your command was for Bullet. He didn&#39;t see your \nvision.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good. It&#39;s time for Striker here to join us. I want all his programs \nrevised so that he gives all loyalty to me. And when that&#39;s done, put \nhim n the CR. He&#39;ll need massive repairs.&quot;\n\nBlaze got to work re-programming Striker, while Prebon ent and looked \nout the main screen. He would have to revise his plan. He would have \nto find another way to control the Maximals. When Ramulus comes, they \nwould ambush him and kill him. Than, with the Maximals all confused \nand scared, they would attack, with their new warrior Striker had the \nlead. They would be no match for this surprise attack, and they would \nfall, and they would all be re-programmed or given the chip. Either \nway, Prebon wins. He let out a maniacal laugh and walked away.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\n&quot;Gotcha!&quot; he said to Zardus, as he went to jet mode and targeted \nAstral. He went up into the air, and than dived straight down with \nhis lasers firing at Astral.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\n&quot;Alright! Come on, let&#39;s get moving.&quot; Gotron started galloping \ntowards the Probe.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois took a small vile of liquid that was sitting on a shelf. He \npoured it on Eagle Eye&#39;s body, and the body began to melt and merge \nwith the rock.\n\n&quot; It is sad. Their will be no Matrix for Eagle Eye. His spark was \ndestroyed when he touched the evil Serpent AngelNemesis. But atleast \nhis body can merge with this world, that he tried to bring peace too. \nHow many of my friends will have to be lost before my mission is \ncomplete? HOW MANY!?!&quot; Vulois left the room and entered his, locking \nthe door.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq inserted their chips and looked at the group.\n\n&quot;Alright! Who&#39;s ready to kick some trainer butt!&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
