We discovered his group on the far \nsid=\r\ne of the galaxy. Apparently back during the second Great War \nseveral Decep=\r\nticons either left on their own or were exiled by \nGalvatron. They all band=\r\ned together for all these centuries in that \nsector. Eventually Starscream =\r\nshowed up there in the form of his damn \nundestructable &quot;ghost&quot; spark. They=\r\n gave him a new body and formed a \nnew empire. With all their advances they=\r\n are known as the Generation \n2 Decepticons. Their co-lead by Starscream an=\r\nd Jhiaxus. I&#39;m not sure \nwhy but Jhiaxus has some kind of grudge against Ro=\r\ndimus dateing back \nto the Great War.
