On surprisingly light feet, even as painful as his injured foot=\r\n was, he barely touches the floor long enough before executing an impressiv=\r\ne display of acrobatics, as he now gets behind the predacon who had shot at=\r\n him, quickly performing a perfect front sweep.

Still, in the same vicinity as Scourge, =\r\nCyclonus and Rodimus, he manages to keep himself out of sight, using the sk=\r\nills which had been taught to him by Prowl. Quietly he stands up against a =\r\nwall in a dark crevace of the room, making no sound. He thinks for just a m=\r\noment at how cowardice this must seem. To try and make a move and then rece=\r\nde into darkness like a spinless glitch. That he was not. He could feel the=\r\n hold Cyclonus had over Rodimus and it enrages him to the point where he gr=\r\nips his fists in anger. He thinks to himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve come this far, I =\r\njust can&#39;t give up and turn the other way. Rodimus, whether he knows it or =\r\nnot, needs my help. But how to go about this? This is something Kup nor Pro=\r\nwl trained me to do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He puts his hand on his chest. His actions were =\r\nof his spark, not of his mind. His spark was telling him to continue on and=\r\n not give up. \n&gt; He remembers the good days when Rodimus was very close to =\r\nall his Autobot comrades, and how many battles were won thanks to him and h=\r\nis guidence. And now, it appeared that Rodimus was the one who needed to be=\r\n rescued. He closes his eyes in thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Optimus Prime, what would y=\r\nou have done if you were in my position? If there were a time when I needed=\r\n your guidence, it&#39;s now. Rodimus needs me but how? How can I pull this off=\r\n? I&#39;m just one Autobot with only his bare spark leading him...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; In th=\r\nought he tries to go back to a time, when he had met Optimus Prime as a you=\r\nng rookie in training. He flashes back to one particular moment when he act=\r\nually got the opportunity to talk to the great Autobot leader. He remembers=\r\n how he was told that no matter how dim a situation was, there was always a=\r\n light to guide them through. It comes to him, the very verse Rodimus had s=\r\naid when he first took up the Matrix of Leadership.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Light our Darkest=\r\n Hour.&quot; He thinks to himself at first.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s it. That&#39;s what Optimus=\r\n Prime would have done. But instead of the Matrix it&#39;s up to ME to light ou=\r\nr darkest hour. Of course, I awoke first, it must mean something. All right=\r\n, Tucson get off your sorry aft and make this happen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He gathers the =\r\nstrength to walk into where he could be seen, judging by the heat that ligh=\r\nts were giving off, as faint as the lights may be. He stands before Cyclonu=\r\ns, and Scourge unarmed, yet ready to defend himself if need be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes,=\r\n you do have someone here. And that someone is me. I don&#39;t know if you reme=\r\nmber me or not, we may not have even met. My name is Tucson and I&#39;m proud t=\r\no say that I am a member of the Autobot faction.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He then senses Rodi=\r\nmus not too far away.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; All right, Rodimus, I have a question for you,=\r\n and you may answer at will. What was the very verse that brought the Matri=\r\nx of Leadership to life, thus giving you the power of its spark? I know you=\r\n know this, and right now you may be hating my sorry servos, but I think I =\r\ncould use a refresher on what it was. Can you tell me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was now pre=\r\nparing himself to get the bolts beaten out of him. This would either make o=\r\nr break things. It was a heck of a gamble yet Tucson knew it was his greate=\r\nst Trump Card and he was not afraid to use it. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Hydras&#39; extended=\r\n his invitation to Cyclonus, and Scourge, Rodimus was surprised for a momen=\r\nt, but then just leaned back against a support beam, his arms once again fo=\r\nlded across his chest. He was about to say some thing really clever about t=\r\nhis when he thought he heard something . . . \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Rodimus.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Dark Rodimus jerked up. He was not sure what he heard, but it sounded like=\r\n some sort of ghostly whisper of his name. He glanced around . . . \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;What was that?!&quot; Scourge said, instantly on the alert, his hyper keen se=\r\nnses also keying in on the strange whisper. He whipped his disintergration =\r\nrifle out and began to look around, his optics narrow and watchful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;What was what?&quot; Cyclonus said, obviously unaware of the whisper, but he=\r\n too grew more watchful, trusting Scourge&#39;s senses. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;This is Per=\r\nceptor, We may have a posible intruder...&quot; The Sgurity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Drones are rel=\r\neased to start a search party&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;An intruder&quot; Scourge almost hissed=\r\n as he began to move around the room, his weapon was once again drawn and r=\r\neady. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus, his quarrel with Cyclonus and Scourge all but forg=\r\notten as this new situation developed had already drawn his weapon as well.=\r\n There would be time enough for thier fight once this was over. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nWhat is it?&quot; Rodimus said, his voice tense but ready.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scourge grun=\r\nted, &quot;I had it. It smelled like an Autobot&quot; Scourge continued to prowl arou=\r\nnd the room, his optics glowing as he probed different areas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ahh=\r\nhh . . .&quot; Scourge squated down to run two fingers on the ground and hold it=\r\n to his nose, &quot; . . . But he was here.&quot; Scourge chuckled darkly. &quot;And we sh=\r\nall find him, yes we shall, we have prey.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras when he heard=\r\n his security chief warning said &quot;Every one take \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a search PArty and =\r\nseek every inch of this base&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus nodded as he watched, &quot;Hydr=\r\nas, I shall help coordinate the seaerh from here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dark Rodimus gl=\r\nanced back at Hydras and then at Scourge and Cyclonus, &quot;And I&#39;m going to ca=\r\ntch that intruder!&quot; His voice all business now. &quot;Whatever it is we&#39;re going=\r\n to catch it, and dismantle it . . .&quot; Rodimus energized his weapon, &quot; . . .=\r\n The HARD way!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scourge stood up saying nothing, looking off in th=\r\ne direction that his powerful tracking sensors told him were small droplets=\r\n of lubricant, and his quarry. With smooth and whisper silent strides he to=\r\nok off at a jog, followed quickly and somewhat more loudly by Rodimus!\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
