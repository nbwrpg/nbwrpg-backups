He was a highly saficticated and highly adaptable cybertronien biped that just happened to be a Transmetal 2, also a highly trained warrior which specialized in melee combat and was a master weaponsbot who could identify any weapon anybot placed under his nose! He was NOT a clone! But there was also one other factor that simply and easily identified him as his true self, his spark signature. \nThe signature of a bot told the information of , not only, their super structure but also their originality and mech fluid type, it explained every circuit in their body down to the finest detail�but it could also be replicated.\nDinobot narrowed his optics at Cyber Claw and took another step towards her, only this time it was a stance that had one meaning to it and ONLY one meaning�if you want to carry on with this sheraid then your skid-plate is mine!\nHe was getting very sick of this argument and it was clearly visible in the way that he carried himself and his stance as he locked his optics on Cyber Claw, the scent of the stranger�s slight panic and worry very clear to him�but that was also another thing that could lean this argument in his favor. It was still clearly obvious that this bot was a female by her scent if not the way that her beast mode�s curves were shown, not exacticaly identical to the way his own used to be in his past life but more smooth. But he could care less if her curves were the smoothest any bot had ever seen, all he cared about was either proving that this bot was a fraud or ripping it limb from limb!\nHe then looked back to Striker but did not turn his head again, the chance of this bot escaping from realization to great to let his guard down. Also noting that Tavatron had placed herself between the bot and the door but then realizing that if this stranger wanted to leave then there was nothing that Tavatron could do to stop it. Him giving her a meaningful glance in hope that she would catch it�s meaning and know the fact, for all her knowing it could mean life or death!\nDinobot then looked back at Striker, his expression cold and emotionless. There was only one word in which he needed to say to draw the Maximal�s attention towards the fact that this bot before them was, indeed, female�*\n\n� Sniff.�\n\n* If Striker�s senses were of any value at all then they would clearly point out that the scent in the room was none other then a new female and coming from the bot, who claimed to be male, in front of them  all. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
