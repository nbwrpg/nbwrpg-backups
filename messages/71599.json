It was not his place to shift the\n&gt; winds of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was not his place to shift the wheels of what would come or what might\n&gt; come.  No matter how much eh wished, he could not change what was to pass.\n&gt; That was for someone higher, wiser than himself to decide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hearing the sound of the Maximals leaving the Ark, Wheelie stayed quiet, and\n&gt; stayed behind.  Watching the group as they readied themselves for whatever,\n&gt; he reamined in his place.  War, strife, fighting, was the destiny of the\n&gt; Trasnformers.  And all he could do was play his part.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a period of quiet and solitude as WHEELIE looked at the\nstars and wondered at the futures for all those left on the Earth.\nThen again one could not be too sure about what surprises that UNICRON\nmight bring. His mad insanity seemed insatiable, and he seemed at the\nmoment to have little care for what his ravaging could have, his\nminions always seeming to watch, looking for the right moment to\nattack.\n\n&quot;What are you doing out here.&quot; LORD ELDER said as he stood just\noutside the light of the Ark looking in WHEELIE&#39;s direction. Ever\nplaying the role of guard and Guardian it was he and LEGACY that often\nstood the long vigils over the Ark and all that were held inside.\n\nELDER&#39;s voice was gentle and concerned as his keen optics swept over\nthe area and then smiled at WHEELIE. &quot;Tuscon and Rodimus have left and\nit looks like Leo and some of the others are about to leave soon too.&quot;\nELDER&#39;s voice was wise and concerned as he approached. &quot;What draws you\nout here to look at the stars. I would have thought you would be\npreparing to go with the others.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
