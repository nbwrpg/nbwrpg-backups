She yelled out as she \nran,&quot;I&#39;ll tell Master Prebon you said Hi.&quot;  She was getting over \nconfident, thinking that she had a good enough lead that they \ncoulnd&#39;t catch her.  She kept running, hoping to out run them and \nmake it back to the trainer base.  She had only gotten about half a \nmile away from the Cybertron Fire, but she wasn&#39;t going to let them \ncatch her and chop her up.  Then, her maximal program took over.  She \nstopped running and let her body shake.  She looked around and \nwondered how she even got so far from the ship when only a moment \nago, she was so close to the entrance.  She stood there a moment, \nconfused and worried.  She saw Firearm and Lunarpine off in the \ndistance.  She took a few steps closer to the base.\n\nThen her trainer program took over.  Her body shook and she turned, \nand started running towards the trainer base.\n\n\n"}}
