Even though his dam=\r\nages caused him slight pain, he did not want to come across as a bot with a=\r\n low tolerance.  The more he sat there, the more he began to get in touch w=\r\nith his sociable side.

I sure do miss him.  I can&#39;t =\r\nremember much about what really happened and how I got separated from the o=\r\nther Autobots. I know I was hit, and I got severely damaged by an unexpecte=\r\nd blow to my processor..  I wish I could remember where that blast came fro=\r\nm and who it was from.&quot;  \n\nHe tries to get up but weakness takes its toll o=\r\nn him.\n\n&quot;Ughhh, yeah, that hit definitely took a lot out of me.  Tell Lord =\r\nPerseus that I&#39;m going to need a little road side assistance.  Let&#39;s see. I=\r\n - think it&#39;s best that I try to transform, that way, it&#39;s easier to wheel =\r\nme out of here.  \n\nSlowly he manages to transform into his vehicle mode and=\r\n barely makes it as several metal plates shift with a bit of a lag.\n\n&quot; That=\r\n&#39;s - better.  Kup - warned me there&#39;d be - days like this.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Understood, let&#39;s set =\r\nup shop in the command center.
