He was running the show, at least for the moment. \nQuickstrike needed to give the codes over...if he didnt then they would never \nbe able to control the ships functions, and then the battle outside would be \nfor nothing. :::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS, in his lab ::: Hah, Soon HLL BEAST will know who his \nsuperior is...and then I will kill him.\n\n::: He was pouring over computer data when he recived the message from the \nOblitercons. Quickly, he sent a reply----::::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: Tell Quickstrike this is Transanulas, the clone of \nTarantulas. I need him alive and safe until I can smuggle him into the ship \nto use his codes. He is a skilled warrior and I cant lose him, not now. \nPlease hurry.\n\n::: He sighed, and went back to work. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: BLACK ARACNIA stared at her computer in disbelife ::: Ah, HELL BEAST, \nthere have been numerous encrypted messages coming and going from Transanulas \nlab.\n\n::: HELL BEAST, with a frown looks at her screen ::: What in the \nblazes....your right. Magnetically lock him within his lab while we decrypt \nthese messages. I want to know what that spider is doing. JACKLE, GREMLIN, go \ngaurd the door.\n\n::: The two Predacons get up and march off the bridge. HELL BEAST then \nwatches PHENIOX and BLACK ARACNIA work on decrypting the messages. Once he \nfound out who he was sending them to.....:::\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: GANGON, BRIGHTBLADE! Go and patrol he perimiter. Look for \nanything suspicious. We still dont know where our former commrads are hiding.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: MEGATRON buzzes into the clearing with currently alot of activity. He \njets right up to Shredder :::\n\n::: MEGATRON, using a quite pissed off voice ::: Transanulas is black mailing \nme! we must eliminate him now. Quickstrike, how are you? And can you give me \nthe codes? We must hurry before HELL BEAST finds out!\n\n::: He says very quickly, and nervously. He bounced around frantically \njumping from one idae to another :::\n\n"}}
