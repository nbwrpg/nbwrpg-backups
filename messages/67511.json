Keeping as safe distance he stared at=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus with stange mix of rage and serenity in his eyes. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; R=\r\nemus was speaking calmly and firmly : Then ...

There is the smell of newly turned earth as if so=\r\nme\n&gt; digging has been done recently. It is also obvious that Cyclonus is\n&gt; =\r\nbenefiting from the Matrix, his optics glowing as he radiated some new\n&gt; po=\r\nwer, and most horrifying of all, there was no hint of the earlier\n&gt; damage =\r\nhe had recieved in his battle with Rodimus.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus stood before fi=\r\nve cybertronian forms, warriors from their\n&gt; build and weapon distribution.=\r\n They each lay on the ground and looked\n&gt; to be in stasis lock due to exten=\r\nsive damage, but otherwise repairable.\n&gt; From the look of them they had rec=\r\neived this damage quite some time\n&gt; ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus turned to look at Re=\r\nmus, and for the briefest of moments a\n&gt; strange mosaic of emotions passed =\r\nfleetingly across his face -\n&gt; enlightenment? anger? frustration? wonder? i=\r\nt is difficult to define,\n&gt; but then all too quickly disappear as he spoke,=\r\n &quot;You speak of things\n&gt; that you have no knowledge of Maximal. Silence woul=\r\nd be your ally now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As Cyclonus spoke several Sweeps in robot mode=\r\n stepped up to Remus from\n&gt; the sides and rear, weapons trained on him, the=\r\ny reach out to hold him\n&gt; in place. At the same time Cyclonus turned away f=\r\nrom Remus to gaze upon\n&gt; the forms before him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I did not allow your =\r\npresence here to bandy useless words with you.&quot;\n&gt; Cyclonus&#39; voice is clear =\r\nand powerful as he directed his words to\n&gt; Remus, &quot;No doubt you have report=\r\ned our position to your comrades, but\n&gt; it is of no consequence, they will =\r\narrive too late.&quot; Cyclonus gestured\n&gt; at the warriors before him, &quot;However =\r\nyou will be able to report this to\n&gt; your superiors. Let them know the gift=\r\n they have given us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus stood still for a moment as more Sweeps=\r\n stepped to Remus&#39; side\n&gt; to hold him in place. Then as if in an exhalation=\r\n Cyclonus began\n&gt; bathing each of the forms in a scintillating cacophony of=\r\n power,\n&gt; vaguely reminiscent of the power so recently shared between he an=\r\nd\n&gt; Rodimus, but darker and more sinister.
