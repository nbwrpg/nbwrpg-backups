He transformed and rolled towards where the smoke was\n&gt; clearing. &quot;Get him in&quot; he said when he found Speedbreaker, and he \nopened\n&gt; his trailer. Wildrider picked him up and carried him in quickly, \nthen\n&gt; started leaving, and heard Speedbreaker, &quot;Bastich&#39;s wrecked my \npaint&quot; or\n&gt; something like that. He leapt out, and transformed into his car \nmode,\n&gt; and roared off, as Motormaster closed his trailer and followed.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Sinnertwin swerved back and forth, avoiding a lot of projectiled, \nand\n&gt; continued on his path.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron got out of Astroblast. &quot;Well Astroblast, go and tell \neveryone\n&gt; to get repaired, we begin shortly&quot; he said, as he waited for the \nrest of\n&gt; his troops to arrive.\n\n\n"}}
