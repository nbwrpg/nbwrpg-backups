He couldn&#39;t see Iron Raptor anywhere in the \nbathroom. Either that creature had eaten her whole, which was rather \nunlikely, or ... that creature was Iron Raptor?\n\nProwl backs up even more, his gun aimed at the creature and ready to fire, \nbut not unless it was neccesary. He narrows his eyes. The creature did \nresemble Iron Raptor a bit.......\n\n&quot;Doors, close and lock,&quot; he says, the doors to his quarters obeying his \ncommand. He looks back at the creature.\n\n&quot;Iron Raptor?&quot;\n\n"}}
