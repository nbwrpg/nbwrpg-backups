He aims his rifle, firing three very fast, and very explosive, shells at him after the bot turns to go off after someone else. An autogun shot then hits him in the side, sending him flying away from the base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise takes off at a run away from the base, shots hitting all around him. A few hit his armor, but don&#39;t do more than denting it.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; the autoguns continue to fire at the three.\n\n\n"}}
