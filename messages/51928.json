Uhnnn. Oh, my aching head. \nWhat hit me?&quot;  She looked down in her lap to see tools laying there \nas well as on the console and floor. &quot;Great, of all the rotten luck.&quot;\nShe checked the scanner next to the homing beacon. Nothing showed on \nit. Plus the auxilury power supply was running low. Soon the beacon \nwould stop sending it&#39;s signal.  She sighed and slowly walked up the \nship, holding onto chairs, side railing and floor slats to climb \nup.  She made her way to the main entrance hatch and opened the \ndoor.  The air smelled sweet and fragrant.  Birds chirped and \nbutterflies floated on a gentle breeze.  She breathed in deep and \nsighed. &quot;Well, at least there aren&#39;t any space pirates around. So \ncount my lucky starts and hope it gets better.&quot;  She climbed out of \nthe door, lost her hold on the rim and tumbled  to the ground.  She \nlay in an undignified heap for a moment and then got up. She looked \naround to make sure no bot saw that.  Feeling certain that she was \nquite alone, she surveyed the damage to her ship. &quot;This pile of \nruble will never fly again.&quot;  She pulled a reading meter from her \npocket and checked the energon readings. &quot;Hmm, still stable and \nundamaged so far as I can see.&quot;  She turned suddenly as she thought \nshe heard something out in the forest.  She shrugged her shoulders \nand turned back to the ship.&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s nothing. Just a wild \nanimal or something.&quot; Still to be precausios, she reacted for her \nplasma pistal and turned the safety off. &quot;But just to be on the safe \nside.....&quot; she muttered to herself.\n\n\n\n"}}
