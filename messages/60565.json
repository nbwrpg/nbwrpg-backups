Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero \ntempatures \n&gt; of space.  The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing the \n&gt; airlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the \nground.  \n&gt; Hellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a room, \n&gt; someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.  His left shoulder \nwas \n&gt; nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of semi \n&gt; organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.  Hellplague look \n&gt; disapprovingly at the sight and then turned to Splattercannon.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you can \n&gt; repair him.  I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.  For a \nmoment \n&gt; they both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before them.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; Necross \n&gt; said before turning to leave.\n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before \n&gt; addressing him.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.  For whatever purpose, \nshe \n&gt; wants him alive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his \n&gt; companion&#39;s grip.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Not my problem.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon fumed a moment as Necross set off for parts of \n&gt; Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon storage.  He \n&gt; gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s new \n&gt; residence.  He dumped them all around the hunter and went to the \n&gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \nsomewhat, \n&gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.  He \n&gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \nsettled \n&gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to it, \n&gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder immediatly \n&gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, but \n&gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \n&gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and scooted \n&gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \n&gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back onto \nthe \n&gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles and \n&gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on his \n&gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \n&gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his arms \nand \n&gt; legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and straddled the\n&gt; &gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting herself \nwith \n&gt; her arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little lizard \nand \n&gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a devious \n&gt; smirk.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
