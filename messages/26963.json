Completkey defenceless Galvatron\nPicked the bot up wrapped him up in his tail\nimoblizing his arms and legs with his gigantic tail.\nGalvatron flew off back into the destron base because\nit was so close to the battle it took a minute to\nreach. He entered holding his prisoner. &quot;I was hopeing\n(he said in a comm to Magma) you could find a way to\nmake this bot useful. Say a mind contro, chip of some\nsort. Im sure Guiledart as a couple to spare. &quot; He\nused the sharp end of his tail to slash across the\nbots throat. &quot;There no more trouble.&quot;\n--- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt; ::Amperion::\n&gt;     After the battle at the CF Amperion wandered off\n&gt; into the distance \n&gt; crossing Africa into Asia.
