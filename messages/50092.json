She&#39;s too small to be of any assistance \ninstalling the new engine components, or not strong enough, or not \nskilled enough in mechanical matters, or whatever.  So she is reduced \nto pacing restlessly.\n\n&quot;Look,&quot; Gatara finally tells her, &quot;if you&#39;ve got that much energy, \nwhy don&#39;t you go out on patrol?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure!&quot; Jayde dashes for the exit.\n\n&quot;And stay out of trouble!&quot; the larger femme calls after her.\n\n&quot;Stay out of trouble?&quot;  This puts Jayde in an even worse mood.  \n&quot;Jeez, does she think I can&#39;t fight or something?  Ooooh, I&#39;ll show \nthem!&quot;\n\nShe races past Torin, barely taking the time to call &quot;Patrol!&quot; in his \ndirection before changing over to rocket-skiff mode and blasting off.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; While the others are working on moving the gear, Torin is \ndismantling \n&gt; the transport.  Finding the bomb Flicker had planted, he smiles.  \n&gt; &quot;Sneaky little bug, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  Disarming the device takes \nseveral \n&gt; minutes.\n\n\n"}}
