He \nwonders \n&gt; silently why Grounded shot at Deemos when he was so close.  He \nspots the \n&gt; knives flying at Trinity and he deftly sprints in front of them.  \nHe manages \n&gt; to deflect on with his wing but the other imbeds itself in his \nshoulder.  \n&gt; &quot;YOU WILL DIE!!!!!&quot;  His left arm hangs limp from the knife in his \nshoulder.  \n&gt; He reaches up and yanks it out of his skin.  Mech fluid sprays onto \nthe \n&gt; ground.  Using only his right arm he flings the knife back at \nDeemos.  &quot;He is \n&gt; mine Grounded.  This is an old battle.  Keep Trinity safe.&quot;  With \nthat said \n&gt; he launches himself at Deemos.  He begins slashing at his head with \nhis \n&gt; energy-bladed staff.\n\n\n"}}
