She knew that either this bot had a spy device, or was \ntold. And since he mentioned Destructor, that might be a good place \nto start.  She walked into the lab and looked at Destructor. &quot;So, \nwhat is going on here?&quot; She turned and saw DarkMouse trembling there, \nas she stood near Destructor.  She smiled and chuckled. &quot;Hello \nDarkMouse.  It has been a long time since  I saw you last.  I thought \nyou had been killed by Aracnia by now? Last I saw you, you went into \nthe ship with Quickstrike to get inside Aracnia&#39;s base.  By what \nmiracle of the matrix did you make it out alive?&quot;\n\nShe looked at Destructor. She wanted to ask him why he had been \nspying on her or waht tretchery he was planning.  But then again, her \ninstincts told her that Destructor was loyal and to trust him.  She \nlooked from DarkMouse and back to Destructor. &quot;What is it that \nrequires my attention at this time?&quot; \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  &quot;I am Sphink. I will contact you again when you and dstructor meet \nin the \n&gt; lab. How do I know you are planning to meet there. We&#39;ll you&#39;ll \nhave to ask \n&gt; him.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
