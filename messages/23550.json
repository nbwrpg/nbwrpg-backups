I would say I&#39;m new here, but I&#39;m not exactly, I&#39;ve bene here\nbefore, some of you might remember me.. I hope. LOL Umm anyway, I&#39;m just\nsaying Hi! to Zardus and Airshadow Nightlight!! *waves madly*.\n\nAlso, could someone, like, find me? LOL I don&#39;t exactly wanna start out an\nRPG with no-one to RPG -with-. :D\n\nI&#39;ll attach my profile down the bottom.. *_*\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nThe gentle silence of the night was broken sharply by the sound of a Status\nPod suddenly zipping through the sky and crash landing on the soft Earth.\nBirds squawked and flew off, startled, and flapped their way to a possibly\nmore peaceful area.\n\nThe moonlight reflected off the polished metal, only marred by a slight dirt\nscrape. The DNA scanner opened the panel and slid upwards, sending out an\nelectronic wave.\n\n::DNA found:: It reported, and slid back into the Pod. It clicked and\nwhirred for a few minutes, then the lid cracked open with a hiss. A shadow\nclimbed out, it&#39;s movements cautious.\n\nWhat little light there was showed a dark black panther, with silver/black\nwings attached to it&#39;s shoulder blades. Her emerald green eyes glittered in\nthe low light, and she darted a few quick looks around her to make sure she\nwasn&#39;t going to be attack or anything like that.\n\nA glimmer of light caught her Maximal mark, but she found herself wondering\nwhy she was with the Maximals. The last time she was here, they had bene led\nby Liono Prime. The bot smirked a little, and sat down in her Panther/Hawk\nmode, waiting a little before she could travel.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nName: Teltoli SilverWing\n\nGender: Female\n\nBeast Mode Characteristics: As a Panther/Hawk Fuzor, Teltoli has the body of\na panther, with silver &#39;socks&#39; on her four paws. Her eyes are emerald green.\nFrom her shoulder blades are two large wings, also black with silver marks.\n\nBot Mode Characteristics: In her Bot mode, Teltoli is also black with green\neyes, and silver on her arms that look like elbow-length gloves, and silver\nringlets on her ankles. She is very pretty, in a girlish sort of way. Her\nfaded gray Maximal mark is on the outside top of her right leg. Her face is\nfaintly cat-tish, with the two rounded ears on top of her head, and faint\nwhisker marks. Her black wings also stay on her back in Bot Mode, so she can\nfly.\n\nWeapons: The panther tail turns into a whip with a long scythe-like blade at\nthe end. From her wings, come two long rapiers that she can use with deadly\naccuracy.\n\nPersonality: Teltoli is a kind, caring Bot, easy to love and be loved with\nall her heart, and acts a lot like a small child in the way of innocence.\nBut sometimes that gets her in trouble when she&#39;s in battle. However, once\nshe is fired up for a fight, she will go down to the end for her friends and\nleader.\nHer father was a great warrior, and taught her many of his moves, and her\nmother taught her others things, like healing with herbs when one was\nrunning low on power.\n\n------------------\nTeltoli SilverWing\nPanther/Hawk Fuzor\n\n\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
