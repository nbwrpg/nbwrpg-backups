Violate my demands and=\r\n there will be consequences. I do not trust you or any stranger who assumes=\r\n they can just drop in unannounced. The old dragon was wise not to trust yo=\r\nu. Something about you makes me rather unsettled. Now go, give him that mes=\r\nsage and bother me no more until I ask for you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; He recedes back into the cave, with a growl of warning. Immedi=\r\nately, he rejoins Talon and his babies, reassuring them all with gentile sn=\r\nout rubs to all of them. Again he could not help but cradle his offspring i=\r\nn his front paws, and give them both a gentile kiss on the head. He then ke=\r\neps an eye at the foot of the cave. He keeps his word as parental instincts=\r\n kick in.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Local artist who specializ=\r\nes in illustration, using traditional and digital media. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts.
