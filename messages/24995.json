It took a long \ntime. Too long, since he flunked out more than once and took the \nwhole thing over again so many times. But he finally got it right, \nand went to assist the Maximals in this war. He looked for a clear \nplace to land, and decided that a fine place would be near that base \nwith the fight going on. It just may be the Maximals, maybe they were \nattacking someone. He started in for a landing. Diskus looked up and \nseen the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diskus: Diskus came in ship. Not one that big, but big. uzz, Mr, \nheeheehee...\n&gt; \n&gt; Klant, still carrying Orion, stayed clear of the battle, but he \nstill seen the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Klant thinking: Great, some new Alliance guy coming, probably, the \nMaximals, how shall they survive this? They can&#39;t survive such an \nonslaught. He would have to try and jump the Alliance member after he \nlanded, he&#39;s fresh and new and perhaps even powerful, and I can&#39;t \njust stand here and let the Maximals down.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship tried to maneuver past the gun fire, and the pilot thought \nit would be best to land a short distance from the battle, he started \nlanding in what seemed like a good spot. Thus begins the story of \nTarantopulous...\n\n\n"}}
