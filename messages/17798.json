He \nstopped to see the Lavacons firing on Hell Beast, Gremlin and \nWaspinator. He yelled.\n\n&quot;NO! Stop firing immdiatly! That&#39;s an order! We will have a battle \nsoon enough!

It&#39;s not going to make him one \nof us, but it&#39;s in his spark. It will make him go mad with anger and \nthings, maybe attack the Maximals. It&#39;ll be great.
