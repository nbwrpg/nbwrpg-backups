I live in Oakville Ontario \nCanada, and maybe some of you know from the news, and I&#39;m pretty sure \ndcoburn knows cause he&#39;s canadian too, but this week in Oakville is \nthe PGA Canadian Open, where all the golf stars come for a \ntournament, and this year TIGER WOODS came, for the first time in 3 \nyears, and the last time he came the thing was in Montreal so I \ndidn&#39;t see him but anyway I got his autgraph and shook his hand, and \nwe had a conversation about how he played the round. I still can&#39;t \nbelieve it. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH TIGER WOODS!!!!!! Sorry, I was \nscreaming all the way home. Damn it, I&#39;m acting like a school girl.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois lead Windrazor and Terradive deeper and deeper into the \nmountain.\n\n&quot;Um.....Now I don&#39;t knwo if this is the right way, and it&#39;s too late \nto turn back.&quot;\n\nVulois continued to go down the tunnel in faint hope.\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq/Brix\n\nThe space travellers continued to remove the hull, when Brix piped up.\n\n&quot;So, Ramulus, like that view of the earth from up here? Beautiful, \nain&#39;t it.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron/Starscream\n\nGotron was unnoticed in the battle, so he quietly snuck into the Pred \ncave. The Preds maybe willing to retreat, but Gotron wasn&#39;t ready \nyet. He stood just inside the door. He would probably die because of \nthis, but he might knock off Deemos in the process. He waited for the \nChosen Ones to claim their prise.\n\nStarscream heard the word to retreat.\n\n&quot;No way! Predacons never die down! I will not retreat!!!!!&quot;\n\nStarscream entered the Pred cave, but immediatly was caught by a \nright fist. Gotron and Starscream met eyes, and each thinking the \nother was a Maximal, started firing with blasters. Most of the shots \nwent wide, hitting, and destroying the Pred cave.\n______________________________________________________________________\nNoble/Savage\n\nNoble was wandering around a valley, regaining strength, we looke dup \nto a cliff and saw too bots(Spears and Striker). Another chance to \nkill bots, he thought. He forced his anger under control, and worked \nto the bottom of the ledge. There he transformed into Savage. He flew \nup to meet them, and as soon as their eyes met he fired a large \nfireball.\n\n\n\n"}}
