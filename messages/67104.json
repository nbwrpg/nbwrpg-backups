I&#39;m HYDRAS&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;      There is a long pause over the radio as the\n&gt; pu=\r\nrple and black raptor swings over the area once\n&gt; more, its large wings cup=\r\nping thermals as swings\n&gt; lazilly in large elipses.

Instead it contains only the calm confidence\n&gt; of a s=\r\noldier with a hint of arrogance, some of which\n&gt; becomes a little more pron=\r\nouced with his next four\n&gt; words: &quot;I await your orders.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Keep in=\r\n mind, Myrmidon is speaking accross the\n&gt; old Beast wars Predacon channels.=\r\n ANY of the Predacons\n&gt; may be able to hear him if they choose to. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pr=\r\neston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; \n_____________________________________=\r\n________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Need a vacation?
