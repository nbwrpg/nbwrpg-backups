He tended \nto do that when he was in deep thought, which wasn&#39;t too often for him. \nQuickstride watches.\n\nIt was almost as if the curious cat was trying to bring out his resourceful \nside, which to him was a bit difficult.  He then looks to fallen rocks on \nthe ground, of different sizes.  Quickstride gives him and Rodimus and the \nothers a perplexed look.\n\n&quot; Well, that&#39;s really nice of you guys to be concerned..  Hmm, umm, I dunno \nwhat Uproar&#39;s up to.  Not like him ta be fixated on tiny objects like \nthat...&quot;\n\nUproar looks up to everyone.\n\n&quot;Oh, sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to go into wierd mode.  I&#39;m lookn&#39; at these rocks \nbecause, some of these may be comrpised of different minerals and alloys. \nMaybe one of them has an alloy that&#39;s resistant to the force shield.. And \nwhat if one of these was batted into the field...  And maybe, if there is an \noutside pannel that controls it, could that rock be swatted at the controls, \nand disable the field long enough ta get us all through without a hitch?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Leo#2, and the others.\n\n&quot; Heeey, guys, he&#39;s onta something.  Rodimus, do you know if the Ark&#39;s got \nan external control pannel for the force shield?  If so, we might just have \nthis problem solved.&quot;\n\nUproar demonstrates his knack for swatting at rocks, as he swatts one in an \nopposite direction a good distance away from the group.\n\n&quot;See?  What&#39;dya think?&quot;\n\nInside the Black Fortress, Rat Trap heaves a temporarry sigh of relief, \nknowing that it&#39;s clear sailing for Windlord and himself.\n\n&quot;Whew, we&#39;re off the hook for now, but we&#39;d be better off if we could get a \nlittle further away from here. I can&#39;t wait ta get home, where it&#39;s safe, \nand we don&#39;t have ta worry about gettn&#39; our tails toasted.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Night Shift didn&#39;t care how long it would take the Furzors \nto help Tucson, he was just very happy to get the assistance.  He looks to \nTorca with a smile of appreciation.\n\n&quot;Heey, whatever you can do for us, works, speed or no speed.  Okay Kup, \nthat&#39;s it, but don&#39;t strain your engine, okay?  Time for me ta start pulln&#39; \nmy own weight too.&quot;\n\nHe gets into his vehicle mode, and zooms up to Kup as he works beside him.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry Tucson, we got you.&quot;\n\nTucson clings to consciousness as best he can.\n\n&quot;Thank you.  I appreciate everyone&#39;s help.  But - please, do - not strain \nyour systems on my - account.&quot;\n\nSensing Talon inside, Tucson tries to regulate the climate inside his cab, \nto help make her feel more comfortable.  Even that was quite a chore, as he \ntries to deliver a good amount of Air filtration and conditioning to cool \nthe atmosphere, yet deliver enough oxygen to clean it as well.\n\n&quot; Talon, are - you all right?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita/Perceptor /Kup/Nightlight/Windlord/Talon/Hydras\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita poped up behind Lord Elder and sayd in low voice &quot;I&#39;m here... i&#39;m \n&gt; hunting Predacons... Do you want to join me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *******************************\n&gt; Perceptor sit down and started to meditate while the breath of Nightlight \n&gt; became slow and rythm. Perceptor just got lost in his own mind and tought \n&gt; a lot of things about his past and posible future.\n&gt;\n&gt; Beep... beep... beep\n&gt;\n&gt; The machine continue cheking the Nightlight&#39;s vitals signals with no \n&gt; change.\n&gt;\n&gt; *********************************\n&gt; In the Battle field Windlord speed up himself in order to leave the \n&gt; explosion area and time was running out. Hydras said with an cold voice \n&gt; &quot;We dont have time to... have some fun; we must survive to fight another \n&gt; day&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup conceus that they didnt have time to loose he speed up, pulling Tucson \n&gt; outside the explosion area.

No we need you two here with us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus paused as he got a call . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor opened his comlink to Rodimus and said &quot;Less than 2 mins...\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight is free; we will sedate her, I have an idea to see if\n&gt; &gt; reprogramation actually worked, but i need you here&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I read you.&quot; He said as he looked back at the others, holding up his \n&gt; hand, it would soon be time. Rodimus glanced at the Ark, &quot;Just a little \n&gt; bit more.&quot; He said as he held out his signature scrambling device, ready \n&gt; to use it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Leo II, Wing Caliber and Ramulus tensed up, ready to dash when Rodimus \n&gt; gave the signal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK\n&gt;\n&gt; As Perceptor communicated with Rodimus on the outside, Legacy, Bump and \n&gt; Santon continued to oversee the reboot of Nightlight, Bump and Santon \n&gt; giving a visible sight of relief as her systems were beginning to come up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy carefully positioned a device over Nightlight&#39;s chest and delivered \n&gt; a sedative, one that would keep her systems stable but would also keep her \n&gt; unconscious.\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon glanced over at Perceptor and then back at Nightlight, shaking his \n&gt; head, obviously uncomfortable about the whole thing, saving Nightlight by \n&gt; working with the very being who had subjected her to this in the first \n&gt; place. However for the moment he was content to let things lie.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Ark,\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Elita! Elita!&quot; Lord Elder&#39;s voice could be heard near by. Even though he \n&gt; was whispering as loud as he could, his voice sounded weak as the sounds \n&gt; of a shuffled movement could be heard in the darkness of Elita&#39;s room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Elita . . . &quot; Elder&#39;s voice sounded as if it were getting further away.\n&gt;\n&gt; OUTSIDE THE TOWER\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras started to move away, trying reach a safe distance; while he was\n&gt; &gt; doing that he open com link with all Predacons and said &quot;TO ALL\n&gt; &gt; PREDACONS LEAVE THE BLACKFORTRESS and sorrounding area,\n&gt; &gt; NOW... FOLLOW MY SIGNAL!!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras gives the order the other Predacons transform into to Beast Mode \n&gt; to make their get away, the vast majority of them taking to the air! The \n&gt; large door on the black Tower opens as Scourge and Cyclonus fly out, both \n&gt; of them already in their aerial modes, boosters flaring as they hit the \n&gt; skies!\n&gt;\n&gt; However as they fly they can almost immediately make out the form of \n&gt; Windlord as he carried Rat Trap in his claws, the duo began to change \n&gt; their vector of flight, angling towards them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir.&quot; Cyclonus transmited over his radio to Hydras, &quot;The Maximals that \n&gt; attempted to break into the Fortress are trying to make their get away as \n&gt; well. Shall we terminate them?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They began to fly after Windlord, their superior speed in the air making \n&gt; it easy for them to begin to close the distance between them, rocket and \n&gt; missile launchers beginning to glow as they targeted the flying Maximals.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile on the ground,\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca nodded as Hydras and the other Predacons began to back off. &quot;We \n&gt; Fuzors don&#39;t have wheels and drive.&quot; He said to Nightshift as looked \n&gt; around and then glanced back at Tuscon in vehicular mode. &quot;But let&#39;s see \n&gt; what we can do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;BANTOR!&quot; Torca called out, &quot;Beast Mode!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Maximal in question quickly transformed into the somewhat bizzar \n&gt; alternate mode, becoming a cross between a baboon and a Tiger; looking \n&gt; strong and powerful, even if unconventional.\n&gt;\n&gt; With that Torca transformed into his beastmode as well, that of an \n&gt; elephant and a Killer whale. He along with Bantor positioned themselves to \n&gt; the front of Tuscon. &quot;We won&#39;t be the fastest things, but we can get you \n&gt; home.&quot; Torca said as he waited to pull.\n&gt;\n&gt; Above their heads Noctorro, Air Hammer and Silverbolt take to the skies, \n&gt; becoming an aerial escort to the injured Maximals and Autobots!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
