Discusting \nmemories return of what the gas can do.  Just then the computer screen \ncomes on.  It shows a ship near the moon.\n\nComputer:  Lutienent we have deteched a transformer vessel near the \nmoon.  We have also deteched close to 300 transformer signitures on \nthe planet.\n\nL:  There&#39;s no way ny brother could have beaten me here and gotten so \nmany transformers in one place.\n\nC:  Not all read Maximal.  Some are Predicon, Autobot, \nDeciticon, Neutral, and some factions we&#39;ve never heard of.\n\nL looks at the ship on screen.\n\nL:  That&#39;s the Ark.  Our victory is at hand. I&#39;VE GOT TO GET ON BOARD! \nCOMPUTER QUICKLY!\n\nThey attempt to manuver to the Ark but Bob&#39;s ship (or whatever rAuq \nsaid it was gets in the way and they get caught by the moons gravity.\n\nL:  Oh well plan A after all prepare the gas.\n\nC:  I&#39;m afraid we can neither break the gravities hold nor dump the \npoison from this far away from the atmosphere.  Transwarp is out  \nbecause of the Asteroid belt.  It could take months to estimate the \nright timing and directions.\n\nL: DANG! Oh well you said Predicons and Decipticons.  I&#39;m sure they \ncan help.  Prepare the escape pod. And fire whatever weapons we have \n(just 4 small laser cannons) at that thing.\n\nHe heads toward Eastern Asia.  And each cannon fires on Bob.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: This is going to sound a heck of alot like fanfic.  Also rAuq \nis \n&gt; the only one I&#39;ve discussed this with (since I didn&#39;t need to unban \n&gt; anything just make sure it wasn&#39;t banned to start with), but he may \n&gt; notice I changed a few details.  He&#39;ll start interacting when he \ngets \n&gt; to Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:  A Pred lutient that looks like TT stands infront of a large \n&gt; tanker (not to be confused with tankor).  A green gas is pumped into \n&gt; the holding area.  A general walks up to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  You sure you want to fly this alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  So long as I&#39;m one step ahead of my brother whose to stop me.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  Don&#39;t underestimate your brother.  If he thinks there&#39;s a chance \n&gt; to stop you he&#39;d fight even if it meant civilian casualties.\n&gt; \n&gt; L: He has no idea where Earth is anyway.  It&#39;s not like he&#39;s just \n&gt; going to get lucky and crash there.  And what&#39;s so hard about \ngetting \n&gt; into the orbit of a planet and dumping a biological weapon in there \n&gt; atmosphere to wipe out all organic life and make sure the \nDecipticons \n&gt; win the great wars.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  You do realize you were a Maximal Protoform.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  The Autobot fight to  the death hero&#39;s on the Ark aren&#39;t related \n&gt; to me, and the ones back on Cybertron would hopefully surrender to \nthe \n&gt; decipticons.  Me and my brother would be one big happy Pred family \nin \n&gt; our own time.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  After seeing what this did to those Tranconians I have no doubt \n&gt; this gas can do the job.  If something goes wrong just get into the \n&gt; escape pod and land remember.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  What could go wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  I don&#39;t know.  They just teach us high up officers to say stuff \n&gt; like that if we want to be popular and to say fight to the death if \nwe \n&gt; want to be remembered in history as that great General who sadly \ndied \n&gt; young possibly in a Mutiny.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  Once there aren&#39;t any humans to back up the Autobots we win.  \n&gt; What&#39;s so hard about that.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  Well when I visited Megatron in prison and he gave me this \n&gt; information it sounded like it had been pretty tough for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  That was because of that Dinobot idiot.  After the tribes \n&gt; scattered he didn&#39;t have the weapons or tech to wipe them all out so \n&gt; he just went for the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; G:  Well then you better be off.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  Goodbye.\n&gt; \n&gt; He get&#39;s in and pilots it to Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I know I should have saved this a while longer, but I have a \nplan \n&gt; to keep the threat to Earth without carring it out.\n\n\n"}}
