Guilty or Innocent, either way it ment no difference to me. The \nTrasformer would die at the hands of the Sharkticons, which would be why I \nhad chosen CyberShark as one of my warriors.\n    &quot;Hot Rod and Kup were to be on trial next, this was during the time that \nUnicron was trying to destroy Cybertron. I presumed them innocent, and had \nthem killed. They turned this into an advantage and destroyed most of my \nSharkticons. Then the ones known as the Dinobots came and turned my own \nSharkticons against me! I fled, but it was to late, I was caught and nearly \nkilled. Unicron, the Dark Master of all Quientessions, retrieved me. He, over \ntime created the Destrons, desendants of the Quientessions. As a matter of \nfact, I do belive that the Tripredacus council was Destron, or as close as \none could get. Do you understand now where I have been?&quot;\n\n"}}
