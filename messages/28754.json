Inside the spacecraft were 5 bots, all of Decepticon allegiance, and all belonging to a sub-group known as the Bodicons.  They landed near the Dark Avian.  The \nship&#39;s hatch opened up, and out stepped a bot who looked like the leader.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Muahaha!  I, Decapitron, leader of the Bodicons, arise once again to fight for the Decepticons!!!!!&quot; He shouted in pride.\n&gt; \n&gt;       4 other bots stepped out of the small spacecraft.  Their names were-\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Gutclaw, at your service!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Legtrap, ready for battle sir!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Explobody here!  Ready to blow up some Autobots!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Autobots, prepare to face the wrath of Headshot!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       Decapitron grinned.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Glad to see that you&#39;re all up and ready,&quot; he credited them.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Decapitron saw the Dark Avian, and then he saw the Decepticon troops going out to battle.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Well, they&#39;re Decepticons, but I&#39;ve never met them.  I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind if we watch \nthis base for them,&quot; he said.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Explobody and Gutclaw, go join those Decepticons, and ask them about this rock, Headshot a\nnd Legtrap, let&#39;s go inside the base, see how much information we can get on our new fellow Decepti\ncons,&quot; Decapitron gave orders.\n&gt;     \n&gt;       Decapitron, Headshot and Legtrap went inside the base.  Meanwhile, Explobody transformed to\n Bird Bomber mode, and flew off following Cyclonus and co. and Gutclaw followed in Mechanical Veloc\niraptor mode.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt;       Inside the Dark Avian, Decapitron, Legtrap and HEadshot went into the control room.  Bots h\nad been in this room not long ago.  Decapitron had experience with controls, and pressed a button t\no show messages that had been recently sent or recieved over the com.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;The Stunticons are here?  Wow!&quot; Headshot exclaimed, looking at the names.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Constructicons were here, or the Terrorcons,&quot; Decapitron sai\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Decapitron and Headshot sat down and relaxed, watching the radar, and waiting for any messag\nes that might come.  Legtrap went to the mess hall, and came back to the control room with a glass \nof energin.  \n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Hey, Legtrap, bring me some energon cubes!&quot; Decapitron demanded.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Go get it your......&quot; Legtrap said, but Decapitron glared at him,&quot;Uh, yes sir!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       Legtrap went to the messhall again, and brought back an energon cube for Decapitron, and a \nglass of energin for Headshot.  They sat in the control room with their refreshments, and talked an\nd waited.  \n&gt; \n&gt;      Explobody and Gutclaw continued to follow Triggerhappy, Skullgrin, Cyclonus and co. to where\nver they were heading.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
