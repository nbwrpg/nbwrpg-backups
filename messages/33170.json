Allright, the only reason I&#39;m replying to this is\nto argue that statement. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite that ignorant to\nforget the history of a faction that my character had a major part of\ncreating, and had led ever since. As I remember it, my version is\naccurate, and if you can tell me what&#39;s wrong about it, I&#39;ll admit my\nmistake. But I&#39;ve been with the Alliance about 20 times longer than\nyou, UnderT, so I would know its history very well.\n\n::FZ::\n\nFZ nodded. &quot;You can say that, yes.&quot;\n\nHe wasn&#39;t sure whether Wolfgang would try to take control or not, but\nif he would ... well, there were three armed troops loyal to FZ in the\nroom, and the Iron Fist had very good internal defences.\n\n&quot;Its been a long time after you were last online, Wolfgang. How are\nyou feeling?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
