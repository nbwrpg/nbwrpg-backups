But I can not control them \nfully.  You might want to reprogram them to follow you. That is how I \ngot them to follow me here. But The chip won&#39;t let me control them \nfully.  You may wish to reprogram them so they will be more loyal to \nyou.  Also, HotRod was a maximal in the Cybertron Fire for a long \ntime.  He has all the codes, passwords and scematics of the ship.  \nYou can retrieve them from his memory banks if he won&#39;t give them to \nyou willingly.&quot; She smiled and purred.  &quot;Oh, I am sorry about \nSkulletron.  WE got seperated and I couldn&#39;t find him.  He may still \nbe on the Cybertron Fire.  That is, if he is still alive.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus frowns, thinking over Unitron&#39;s words as he led the new \nrecruits to \n&gt; their quarters. The defences were watching them carefully, but \nUnitron was \n&gt; right, it would not be a good idea to trust them with anything \nimportant. \n&gt; Zardus silently chuckles to himself. He didn&#39;t trust anyone too \nmuch. That \n&gt; was why all the Alliance base&#39;s functions had a direct link to his \nwrist \n&gt; computer, so he could keep watch and regulate any trouble back at \nthe base.\n&gt; \n&gt; He stops by a set of doors. &quot;This one is yours, Hot Rod,&quot; he says \nto Hot Rod, \n&gt; pushing a button to make a door slide aside, revealing the typical \nAlliance \n&gt; quarters. He turns to the door across the hall, opening it as well, \n&gt; &quot;Cybershark, this one is yours.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The rooms were about the same size, and had furnishings from \nReptilica&#39;s and \n&gt; Bloodystrike&#39;s old base (Hot Rod and Cybershark, you guys can \ndesign them as \n&gt; you wish).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You can make yourself at home or explore the base. But be \ncarefull, the \n&gt; defences are watching you. Any weaponfire or sudden cloaking will \nresult in \n&gt; lockdown in the area, and injury or death. If you have any \nquestions, contact \n&gt; me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus turns to Feline. &quot;I believe you have information for me... \nCome.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns around, walking off toward the CR chambers.\n\n\n"}}
