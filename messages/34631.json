He was in his second beast mode,\nbut he had control this time, &quot;Maximals, your commander is Iron\nRaptor. We can&#39;t give up now. They&#39;re attacking our base, and we must\nfight back. Listen to Iron Raptor and we can get through this.&quot;\n\nHe was very mad at Tigerhawk for mutinizing like that, plus ordering\nthe Maximals to retreat to a ship that he didn&#39;t even control, but he\nwould take it up with him later, if IR wished. For now he just hoped\nthat Iron Raptor would make some good orders, like telling the injured\nMaximals to go to CRs. But if they retreated like Tigerhawk wanted,\nthe Decepticons would just go on to the Element, and the battle will\ncontinue a little more than 100 yards from here.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., icedemon101@h... wrote:\n&gt; [ok lets just say depth charge got out of there. and please next\ntime \n&gt; wait for me to post cause depth charge was inside.]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor/Tigerhawk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he walked between Ironraptor and Fireblade. &quot;He is almost dead. \n&gt; Maximals don&#39;t kill unless in self defense.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tigerhawk open a com to all maximals. &quot;Everyone I am taking command \n&gt; for now. everyone retreat we have nothing to fight for. head to the \n&gt; element base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
