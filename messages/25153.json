(Smiles\ndementedly as he types)\n\nBIC: Train Wreck and Arrow touch down on Prehistoric Earth. The trip didn&#39;t\ntake as long as they thought. Instrat walked through the SWAMP right up to\nthe ship. (Remember, Team Ultima base was in the swamp) Near where they had\nlanded was the remains of the old People&#39;s/Ultima&#39;s base, and nearby it was\nthe ship the Radicons originally came to the planet in. Train Wreck ran up\nto the ship. Arrow sees the Ultima base in ruins and laughs.\n\nArrow: But...I know Stronghold and Blender survived. They&#39;re just like that,\nsurvivors.\n\nInstrat: Who are you?\n\nArrow: Arrow, and Train Wreck.\n\nInstrat: I&#39;m Instrat.\n\nArrow: Yep.\n\nArrow aimed his tiny but deadly blaster at Instrat.\n\nTrain Wreck: Wait!\n\nArrow: What?\n\nTrain Wreck: What did she do?\n\nArrow: Nothing, that&#39;s why it&#39;s great to kill her!\n\nInstrat looked on in fear as they argued, but quickly changed to angry mode.\n\nTrain Wreck: But she&#39;s so nice looking.\n\nArrow: Oh, great, now you&#39;re pulling an Airbomber!\n\nTrain Wreck: Huh?\n\nArrow: Never mind.\n\nTrain Wreck: Say, Instrat, would you like to hang around us?\n\nInstrat: Is he going to try to kill me?\n\nTrain Wreck: No, not anymore.\n\nInstrat: I thought I wouldn&#39;t have any friends, those 2 back there weren&#39;t\nnice at all.\n\nTrain Wreck: Well, if we ever come across them again, we could kill them.\n\nInstrat: Well, I don&#39;t really want them dead, I had fun with them.\n\nTrain Wreck: They sound awful to me. Like our good old friends who killed\nus.\n\nInstrat: Killed you? But...\n\nTrain Wreck: Long story.\n\nArrow: But when we find them again, they won&#39;t catch us off guard, they&#39;ll\npay.\n\nArrow thinks in his mind about how much fun it would be to kill Stronghold\nand Blender, then thinks about the fun it would be to kill Instrat&#39;s 2 old\nfriends...(Carnage and Teltoli)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, January 09, 2001 8:53 PM\nSubject: Re: Avoiding the Storm\n\n\n&gt; ** Carnage watched it all, but it was a reliefe to see Instrat go...even\n&gt; though she could smell the sadness in the air when she had turned away\nfrom\n&gt; them.\n&gt; In that case, it almost mannaged to make her feel bad...almost. But\nInstrat\n&gt; had attacked them, then seemed to become friendly, then finally decided\nthat\n&gt; she hated her guts!\n&gt; For all she cared, a bot that couldn&#39;t understend what people had to go\n&gt; through to have friends, didn&#39;t need any friends at all. And with\nInstrat&#39;s\n&gt; attetude, she didn&#39;t know if she would ever have any. But, like she had\n&gt; thought she would be alone forever, sometimes things worked out.\n&gt; Carnage continued to walk as Instrat walked away and Teltoli joined her in\n&gt; the direction of the swamps.\n&gt; She knew that what Teltoli had done wasn&#39;t really right, but where they\nwere\n&gt; going Instrat wouldn&#39;t like anyway.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
