I had an interesting idea yesterday and I&#39;m gonna share it \nwith you.\n\nMost new members, when they join, have no idea what factions like the \nAlliance, the Chosen Ones, the Destrons (although more people know \nabout the Destrons than the made up factions) are, so they end up \njoining either the Maximals or the Preds. My idea is to make an \nadvertising system, to display ads on the bottom of the character, \nmember, join, main, and other pages. These ads would be advertising \nthe various factions and will be designed by the faction commander. \nThe ads would link to a page describing the faction, which would also \nbe designed by the faction commander. Then new people can get various \nfaction propoganda to persuade them to join factions other than the \nfamiliar ones.\n\nI&#39;ll add a poll to the poll section, so vote on that. If enough people \nwant it, I&#39;ll pro\n\n\n"}}
