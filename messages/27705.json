Thanx for telling me, Rdahl.\n\n::Firearm/The Galactors::\n\nFirearm grunts as Wildrider crashes into him, leaving a large crack \nin Firearm&#39;s armor and sending the tank skidding forward slightly. \nFirearm transforms, stumbling back and nearly falling but being able \nto regain balance. He looks down at his beat-in chest plate, looking \nback up and firing two charges at Wildrider. It hurt to move, but \nFirearm was a warrior, used to pain.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe jet that was Supernova, Scrap, and Flare appeared on the horizon, \nheading for the Cybertronian Fire. A cloaked jet, consisting of Vicyr \nand Slasys, was following it. In seconds, the jets cleared the \ndistance to the CF and could now clearly scan the fighting bots \nthrough the ashes.\n\n&quot;All Alliance bots, this is new Alliance warrior Supernova. We are to \nassist the Maximals at this battle,&quot; he says over his comm to any \nAlliance members that happened to be at the battle, and then opens \nhis comm to the Maximals.\n\n&quot;Maximals, me and the other Alliance members are here to help. Do not \nfire on us.&quot; He ends the transmission and then barks a short order to \nthe Galactors. The bigger jet (Supernova and co) seperates and then \nforms again using only Flare and Scrap, leaving Supernova to land on \nthe ground and continue toward the Cybertronian Fire on foot.\n\nThe jets get into range of the CF, one of them firing two missiles at \nAstroblast and the other four heavy-plasma shots at him. Supernova \narrives at the battle, firing his laser rifle at Wildrider.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Motormaster smacks his head with his hand at the new noise of \nSquawktalks\n&gt; voice.

Drag Strip, coasts on the \nair &quot;well\n&gt; sir, many Maximals have joined the fray, and we are outnumbered, \nbut their\n&gt; defences are weak from an attack that&#39;s already hapened, this is our\n&gt; chance&quot;. &quot;Good&quot; Smiles Motormaster, &quot;Stunticons, transform and \nattack.\n&gt; Squawtalk, Beastbox&quot; he barks tossing out Beastbox, &quot;pick off the\n&gt; Straglers&quot; at that Motormaster Speedbreaker and Dead-End jump out of\n&gt; Astroblast, and soar towards the ground, a bit away from the battle.\n&gt; Astroblast follows them.\n&gt; \n&gt; The small pink cassette of Beastbox transfroms into his Gorilla \nmode, but\n&gt; starts to plummet like a rock, (he cant fly, hint Soulstice).\n\n\n"}}
