He looks around, seeing Arcangel,\n&gt; Icedemon,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shocker, and Kamodia attacking the base. He looks down at his\n&gt; scanners,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing the Alliance members dealing with some Maximals in the\n&gt; torture\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chambers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Zergling, DevilDuer,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Get out here\n&gt; and help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defend the base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that, he turns toward Kamodia, firing his plasma launcher at\n&gt; her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DevilDuer opens his eyes, looking down at himself. He wasn&#39;t in\n&gt; too good a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shape, mechfluid leaking from his wounds and a headache in his\n&gt; head. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; growls as he hears Zardus&#39; transmission. Couldn&#39;t he get some\n&gt; rest?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DevilDuer gets to his feet, using a tree branch for support. He\n&gt; walks out\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the forest and toward the Alliance base, firing at Shocker.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Missing old school friends?
