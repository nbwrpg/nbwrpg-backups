Ultimo hit the sabre to the side then parried by having the  barrette extend towards Hellpeons sword hand.  With his other hand he threw  his shield in front of the blast but it knocked him back a bit from the close range, also obscurring the attack of his barrete causing Ultimo to swing his arm up the extended barrette going straight at Hellpeons neck from the chest area.\n\n\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; And as the flame came towards him it was quickly repeled by that barrier of \n&gt; Chaochtian energy.
