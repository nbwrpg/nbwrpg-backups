The =\r\nshuttle looks something like a Bident but instead of two \n&gt; pokers it has t=\r\nwo lightning bolts.  It is a metallic silver/white \n&gt; color.\n&gt;   \n&gt;      Bu=\r\nt enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique spaceship \n&gt; were two indi=\r\nviduals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over their \n&gt; metallic though wa=\r\ns more metallic but this is where the two \n&gt; individuals looked different. =\r\n One was a shinny red metallic and the \n&gt; other was a shinny blue metallic.=\r\n  So for now they shall be known as \n&gt; Red and Blue.  Red was studying a ma=\r\np of the world known as Earth.  \n&gt; Blue was sitting in the pilot&#39;s chair bu=\r\nt instead of carefully \n&gt; planning the course he had his legs up on the con=\r\ntrols and was \n&gt; twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red said =\r\nas he turned and faced his \n&gt; comrade, &quot;What the Grease Bolting are you doi=\r\nng!  Why aren&#39;t you \n&gt; planning our landing!  I don&#39;t want to crash.  Plan =\r\nahead.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  Blue said as he let out a sm=\r\nall \n&gt; chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with the flow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;We nee=\r\nd a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue ye=\r\nlls back.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Poor Poor Blue, if only he listen to his brother.  But=\r\n he \n&gt; decided to not listen to his brother and decided to go with the \n&gt; f=\r\nlow.  Well now they are flowing on the mountains of the Northern \n&gt; Contine=\r\nnt where they crashed.  Their exact location of the crash is \n&gt; (using the =\r\nmap on the events page) as far east of the Predacon base \n&gt; as possible and=\r\n about an inch up.  It looks like these two bots need \n&gt; a rescue operation=\r\n. (Hint:  I just making the rescue operation to see \n&gt; which groups are act=\r\nive and that is how I am going to decide who to \n&gt; join to rescue me.)  (So=\r\n Bots, move out.)\n\n\n"}}
