Yes those \nwere the days tons of moding but it was all good and fun because many \nwere expeirimenting and had no Idea what they were doing... \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I agree. I never had the rules explained to me when I first \njoined a year ago. I was new to the Internet and didn&#39;t know how to \nact, and besides that I started off as just a bad RPGer. Kyle \nStewart, you start off as a good one, but with the same flaw as I \noriginally had. Not knowing the rules. Of course, back then the rules \npage sucked, and it is nowhere near the grand spectacle it is today. \nIt&#39;s not very descriptive and informative. But back to my point, I \nmoded alot without even noticing it, and did things very similar to \nyou, Kyle Stewart (if that&#39;s what you like to be called). I once even \nbusted into a base and played around inside in one post because I was \nbored, and didn&#39;t know what I did wrong until months later!...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: robertdahl \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 1:45 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Kyle Stewart\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC: Cool of Legendarynemasis. He&#39;s new, and it takes a while to \nget the\n&gt;   rules, you above all should know that. Now you said that your a \nhot\n&gt;   head, so you should know it&#39;s not smart to go off yelling at \npeople.\n&gt;   Kyle, don&#39;t worry, everyone&#39;s moded once or twice, but we&#39;ve just\n&gt;   learned from our mistake. Again, talk to the council. Also, \nwelcome to\n&gt;   the RPG :)\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to \nhttp://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n"}}
