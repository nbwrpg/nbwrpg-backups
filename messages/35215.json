His eyes are blue, and he wears a small \n&gt; mask over his mouth. Most of the time he hunches over, and honks \n&gt; a little red horn at people. He has a small yellow flower about two \n&gt; inches squared on the left side of his chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob has several weapons. He has a automatic pie launcher, \n&gt; capable of making an interesting slat in the face of any \n&gt; unsuspecting person. His small chest flower squirts acid up to 5 \n&gt; meters. Bob frequently uses his fists to do mock battle with other \n&gt; clowns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bob is a very outgoing bot. He likes to bug and tease other bots \n&gt; that he knows, and doesn&#39;t know. This trait has often gotten him \n&gt; into trouble, and once it got him beat up. He was in the CR for \n&gt; three days.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above was an example, and a quick one at that. =P\n&gt; That or less (without the personality section) would do nicely on \n&gt; the page. PLEASE make your short character bio&#39;s as soon as \n&gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 19 May 2001, at 22:12, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, I think I can go over and submit some stuff, but I won&#39;t be\n&gt; &gt; able to get the bios done anytime soon, sadly...\n\n\n"}}
