Soon, after \nsneeking around the forest, she found the cause of the scent. She saw \nsomething that made her optics grow wide. She peered out from under a \nthick bush. Another wolf bot, playing with a robot and a small fox \nbot.  She rubbed her optics with her paws. Then refocused her optics \nand knew they were not decieved. She lay under the bush, her scent \nstill down wind from them. SO they would not smell her. She watched \nthe black wolf train a small child like fox. For a moment, her mind \nwandered into an old dream of wishing to see such things. Predacons \nnever were alowed to enjoy such pleasures in life. Nor is a warrior \nallowed to have such things, it would give the enemy something to \nhold over the warrior. She let out a soft sigh and continued to watch \nin fascination.  She was about to leave her stomach once again acted \nup and she was forced to lay on the ground, under the bush. Panting \nhard and wishing the pain would just go away. In wolf mode, she lay \nthere.\n\n\n"}}
