Her logical side telling her that she \nshould lash out and give him a good whack across the face, but the new \nthoughts planted in her mind were stronger and they told her to let him come \nclose to her.\nHer mind was in tangles but still the new thoughts bloomed and swamped out \nthe logic, her mind slowly clearing but with the thoughts planted within it \nand not her own.\nHe was a Maximal but her spark was growing to love him, but her mind also \ntold her that she was a Maximal as well.\nIt was so confusing but also made perfect sense.\nShe watched him walk up to her and stop only inches away, yet so close that \nshe could feel the heat of his body.\nBrightBlade slowly lifted her head and looked at him square in the face�and \nblushed.\nTo her he seemed so handsome and so kind. She was quite taken by him.\nShe blushed deeper as he took her right wrist in his grasp, his fingers \ngently rubbing against it. He was so gentle.\nLifting her gaze from her wrist to his eyes she suddenly found herself lost \nin them, her mind giving out a last desperate cry of extreme warning before \nbeing swamped by the new feelings.\nBrightBlade brushed her own fingers against his and looked down at them, \nstill not quite sure what to make of this.\nShe felt shy, even though her body was still wracked with shivers and \ndamage.\nHer voice was soft and barely a whisper. *\n\n� Why��\n\n* That was all she could manage to say, knowing that he seemed to love her. \nShe just guessed that she wanted to hear it from him, her new thoughts \nwanting to hear the words from his throat to solidify themselves. *\n\n( BB: That�s OK, CODE. Gangon can break free and find a body. It might even \nbecome interesting.)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
