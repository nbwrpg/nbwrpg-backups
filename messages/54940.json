She decided to fly down for a closer \nlook.  She swooped down and landed in a nearby tree. She hung upside \ndown and looked at the bot who seemed to be fighting with another \nbot.  She saw the one bot run through a cloud and start to faulter. \nshe sighed. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know who this bot is, but for my \nprogramming, I must help.&quot;  She released the branch she was hanging \nby and gracefully opened up her leathery wings. She swooped down and \ngrabbed the bot (KUP) by the shoulders and started to take to the \nsky. &quot;Relax, your safe now. I won&#39;t hurt you. So I would greatly \nappreciate it if you wouldn&#39;t try to hurt me.&quot; She used her huge \nwings to gain lift and rose over the trees. &quot;Any place you want to be \ndropped off at?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; The Autobot drill seargent didn&#39;t have time to react.
