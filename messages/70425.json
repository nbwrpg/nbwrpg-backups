I just wish I could take all of you somew=\r\nhere where we&#39;ve all never been before, but without my visual sensors, I&#39;m =\r\nafraid my journeys are a bit restricted to sonar range.  I promise all of y=\r\nou though, that as soon as I am repaired, I would like to explore this plan=\r\net with all of you, after we settle this crisis we&#39;re undergoing now.&quot;\n\nHe =\r\nhad forgotten to talk to Perceptor not only as a leader, but as a friend.  =\r\nThis was a great opportunity to do just that.\n\n&quot; Perceptor, I&#39;ve been meani=\r\nng to tell you something for a while, and I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t right away.  =\r\nBut we have some time now, and I want you to know that I don&#39;t want you to =\r\nfeel enslaved under my command, I want you to know that you can always talk=\r\n to me as a friend, and formality isn&#39;t a must around me.  All I ask is tha=\r\nt you do your best, and if you don&#39;t succeed at something, do not hold that=\r\n against you.  Everyone comes to a road block sooner or later, but those ro=\r\nad blocks end up being learning experiences and when you come to it again, =\r\nyou learn how to get around it.  That&#39;s how I want you and everyone else to=\r\n feel.  Of course, the only thing that will bother me, is malice among comr=\r\nades.  Other than that, I am by no means the punnishing type.  And if I&#39;ve =\r\nforgotten to say this, I&#39;m saying it now.  Welcome to my aliance.

But bringing them all \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; together under one banner would be most difficult especially to a new \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Prime who was just starting out.  He uses his sonar systems to follow \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ramulus, Cheetor and Lord Elder, transforms into truck mode, and rolls at=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; a reasonable speed up to Lord Elder, and rolls slowly beside him.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Your words are very wise Lord Elder.  Bringing everyone together wil=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; not be easy, and I admit, I don&#39;t know everything either.  But I do =\r\nknow \n&gt; &gt; that I sense great strength among our group, a strength I&#39;ve neve=\r\nr quite \n&gt; &gt; sensed before.  A strength to overcome differences and to be a=\r\nble to work \n&gt; &gt; together under one roof.  We just need to learn how to tap=\r\n into that \n&gt; &gt; strength and we haven&#39;t quite gotten that far, at least, I =\r\nhaven&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stops and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Get i=\r\nn, wheels work faster than feet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Pr=\r\neston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Must we always assume t=\r\nhe worst Cheetor?

If he w=\r\nere to turn his back on us, he would have done \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that vorns ago. Now,=\r\n I will not hear another negative word about \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor.

He has risked his life for us, and now \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we must do him the=\r\n respect of showing him our thanks for his efforts. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now, enough bic=\r\nkering, we have a tunnel to seal off and Rodimus Prime \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to bring bac=\r\nk online.

He had been helping\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rhinox, perhaps it was time for him t=\r\no return to that mission. Too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much time around the Ark never made him =\r\nfeel good. he prefered the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wide open out doors, not to be confined to =\r\nand one spot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, ya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta s=\r\nee, but he sure knows \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his words of wisdom. Definitely what Optimus =\r\nPrime would&#39;ve done.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lord Elder watched Cheetor walk back to the=\r\n Ark as well, as he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; listened to Quickstride. Elder folded his arms beh=\r\nind his back as he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; turned to look back at Quickstride, &quot;Is it?&quot; Elder =\r\nasked.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Trust cannot be demanded or commanded only earned.&quot; He sa=\r\nid quietly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor was not with you to watch the events that you saw=\r\n that caused\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you to come to trust Perceptor, how can he be expected to=\r\n trust\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without it?&quot; Elder&#39;s voice was not accusatory but calm and reas=\r\noning.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor only knows what he sees here and now, and that is a Pr=\r\nedacon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that he has fought against for a long time. It will take time t=\r\no get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; over that, to see him as a companion, perhaps one day as a frien=\r\nd.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder turned to look back at Perceptor, &quot;And it will take Per=\r\nceptor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time to come to realize his new role here, and that the life th=\r\nat he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has known has ended, he has a new part to play.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder=\r\n looked at Cheetor and Ramulus for a moment, watching each one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; walk aw=\r\nay in different directions. &quot;It is Tuscon&#39;s job now to bring us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; togeth=\r\ner, unite us under a common banner.
