Oh well that changes everything I mean I \nmyself have the \n&gt; controller for it. Its a special button with the windows sign. And \nyes there \n&gt; is arule against declaring the moon as a giant robot you want to \nuse against \n&gt; the base. Its called stating it without asking the council about it \nsince \n&gt; there is a rule about bringing in Battlecruisers(Which are a \nhelluva lot \n&gt; smaller then the moon) and asking the council about bringing it in.\n\n\n"}}
