He knew the basic layout of the ship, so he had no trouble\n&gt; getting to the CR chambers and getting Groove and Streetwise into\ntwo\n&gt; of them. He turns around and exits the Element, flying toward\nanother\n&gt; group of Maximals.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler lands near the group of injured Maximals, but a stray laser\n&gt; blast sends him down to the ground. He jumps back up, looking around\n&gt; and spotting Headstrong fighting Firedrill. Assiming that Headstrong\n&gt; had fired at him, he runs toward the Decepticon, discarding his\n&gt; missile launcher (out of missiles), and taking out a pistol, firing\n&gt; four shots at Headstrong&#39;s head.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster reaches the group of stasis-locked Maximals, taking Ratchet\n&gt; and Orion and jogging toward the Element.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther smiles, watching EndBringer attacking Double Punch. He then\n&gt; takes aim and fires two charges at Injector, and puts away his\ncharge\n&gt; launcher, with was out of ammo.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Firearm watches another tank begin to help him out (Forrior). He\nfires\n&gt; two missiles, both of them heading for Predator (not seeking, of\n&gt; course).\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica recieves Zardus&#39;s orders, and fires two missiles down at\n&gt; Vehement, flying down toward the big bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise stands up, rubbing his head but then running at Injector\n&gt; without wasting any time.\n\n\n"}}
