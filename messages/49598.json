Burrock, on the other hand,\n&gt; received many shots \n&gt; throughout him and his acidic gland got blown up.\n&gt; The result, however, \n&gt; was more dire.\n&gt; \n&gt; The worm-like robot, started tilting forward and\n&gt; fell on the ground, \n&gt; in the midst of battle. Then, he started bulging up,\n&gt; chemical \n&gt; reactions inside him tearing the techno-organic\n&gt; tissues and circuits \n&gt; apart, then frying the whole body. The tripredacus\n&gt; finally exploded \n&gt; with a forceful blast, spraying sharpnels, flesh and\n&gt; a lot of acid on \n&gt; everyone around the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing his new warrior die so prematurously, Tyrael\n&gt; got angry. He \n&gt; transformed to phoenix mode, grabbed the remains of\n&gt; Burrock and flew \n&gt; up high.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Tripredacus! We retreat now! You shall see\n&gt; more of me, \n&gt; Megatron! Few have ever escaped me, and you will not\n&gt; be one of them!\n&gt; \n&gt; He started flashing, his light glowing brighter and\n&gt; brighter, until it \n&gt; became like a sun a few meters from the base. This\n&gt; would perfectly \n&gt; cover the retreat...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
