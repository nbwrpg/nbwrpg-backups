Raising his \nmissile launcher, he fired off a rocket at the space between Gremlin and \nJackle.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor chuckled, feeling mass flames cover his body, barely able to keep \nfrom screaming, firing a plasma blast from his plasma launcher off at \nRampage&#39;s face while he was in tank mode.\n\n---\n\nSixshot swerved to the left in the air quickly from above, a few shots \nscraping against his cockpit.  Bringing up the targeting computer, he fired \none missile off at Scourge, another at Rampage&#39;s left tread, and 20 rapid \nlaser bolts rained down at Black Arachnia.\n\n---\n\nUnitron dodged Transantulas&#39; shots, but the autogun fire left numerous small \ndents on the bottom of his space fighter mode.  Getting a target lock, he \nfired off two missiles at a group of autoguns attached to the Predacon base.  \nOpening a shaft on the bottom of his current mode, a 5 ft long, 3 ft wide \nbomb dropped, descending rapidly towards Transantulas.\n\n---\n\nHades slammed into a rock, slipping to his skid plate, firing off three optic \nblasts \n\n---\n\nAnubis rolled to the left, a few shots hiting him in the side.  Raising his \nmissile launcher, he fired a rocket off at Marine&#39;s abdomen.\n\n"}}
