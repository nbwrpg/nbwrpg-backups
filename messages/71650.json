She jumps up=\r\n to catch a hanging branch and like a skilled acrobat, she manages to swing=\r\n herself up higher into the trees.  From there, she could see a large branc=\r\nh severely cracked, hanging right over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.     She then sp=\r\nots a large tree root at the edge of what looked like a tar pool.  How conv=\r\nenient was that?  And she certainly was fast enough to dart out of the way =\r\nif she had to.  But if she could only break that branch without falling out=\r\n of the tree herself.  \n\n&quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda pred=\r\nictable..  So why not try something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;=\r\n\n\nShe examines the crack in the branch.  She finds that with just a strong =\r\nhit with a sharp object, the branch would definitely come down. She raises =\r\na brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the branch.  She hi=\r\nts her target as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from the damaged tre=\r\ne with a loud creaking noise.  She hoped her first plan of attack would wor=\r\nk.  Phase two would also prove difficult as she waits to see how the chips =\r\nfall, literally. \n\n&quot; Timber..&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Tucson quickly catches Noctorro =\r\nas he puts his body beneath his to support him.\n\n&quot; Easy I got you.  Seekers=\r\n?  But how? They&#39;re out scouting the parameters, I saw them myself.  Someth=\r\ning is very wrong here. Leo Prime, it&#39;s definitely not Hydras and I&#39;m almos=\r\nt certain a greater evil is at play here.  I suggest we send rescue efforts=\r\n to the Fuzors immediately. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of who, it&#39;s a =\r\nmatter of what is causing such chaos.&quot;\n\nHe looks to Hydras.\n\nYou haven&#39;t de=\r\nployed any seekers have you?  If you gave that order to attack the Fuzors o=\r\nur alliance ends here.&quot;\n\nHe scowls at Hydras.\n\n\nMeanwhile Nightshift watche=\r\ns from a good distance as Straight Shot attempts to play decoy with Dark Ro=\r\ndimus.  Yet seeing him seems extremely disturbing to Nightshift.  He rolls =\r\ninto view and looks to the dark imposter.\n\n\n&quot; So that&#39;s it, huh?!  First yo=\r\nu make us believe you&#39;re all over the evil thing and now you go right back =\r\nta be&#39;n an A class Aft.  Nice, real nice.  Elita hate ta say it but I think=\r\n your dad just turned tail on us.  That&#39;s it, I take orders from Leo and Tu=\r\ncson but that&#39;s about it.  Consider yourself on my do not trust list.  Peac=\r\ne out.&quot; \n\n\nHe turns around to drive Elita to safety.\n\n\n&quot; FROM HERE ON OUT, =\r\nI ONLY TAKE ORDERS FROM REAL PRIMES, NOT OVER RATED HOT ROD WANNA BE AFTS L=\r\nIKE YOU!&quot;\n\n\nHe secures Elita on his drivers side seats.\n\n\n&quot; Sorry Elita but=\r\n your dad really is act&#39;n like a real aft right now&quot;.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPerpetually =\r\non the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 12, 2011, at 5:00 PM, Airshadow N=\r\nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n    \n  Elita/Talon/Hydras:\n\n  &quot;Wh=\r\no is he??&quot;said Elita while she looked the dark Rodimus and hide&quot;looks \n  li=\r\nke my dad...

Straight Shot looks to Waspinator=\r\n with a\n  &gt; frightened expression. Just like him she did NOT like the sight=\r\n of Dark\n  &gt; Rodimus.

We see the other Rodimus too.=\r\n . . . how?&quot;\n\n  There was a knowing smile from DARK RODIMUS as he reached d=\r\nown and\n  picked up something off the ground, He looked back up at STRAIGHT=\r\n\n  SHOT, &quot;Maximals are always so predictable, you all want to shoot me,\n  a=\r\nnd these Predacons won&#39;t shoot me because they are not sure who I am,\n  and=\r\n you . . . &quot; He chuckled, &quot;You might shoot, but you will only try\n  to main=\r\n me.&quot;\n\n  DARK RODIMUS laughed as he was looked at all of them. &quot;Don&#39;t you k=\r\nnow\n  it might already be too late?&quot;\n\n  &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Meanwhile, Tucson c=\r\natches Noctorro but he senses something wrong.
