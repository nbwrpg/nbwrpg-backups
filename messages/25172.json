He fired off two sonic arc blasts from his sonic blaster at\n&gt; Tarantopulous.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro remained submerged in the mud, now six feet under, the pressure\n&gt; stopping.  But Pyro couldn&#39;t move.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss fired off four fusion blasts from his cannon at Tarantopulous.  A\nblast\n&gt; of freezing struck his arm, the right shoulder joint freezing up and\n&gt; unmovable for now.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger transformed to his biped mode, running over to Pyro and plunging\nan\n&gt; arm into the mud, wrapping his arm around his comrade&#39;s wrist and tugging.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Hot Spot transformed to his biped mode, the blue robot turning around and\n&gt; making a run for Blades and First Aid, his sensors reporting First Aid\nnear\n&gt; death.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Groove lowered his weapon, running after Hot Spot for Blades and First\nAid.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Blades reached First Aid, putting pressure on First Aid&#39;s neck wound and\n&gt; chest wounds, blocking the flow of mech-fluid from those areas.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; First Aid remained unconsciouss, slipping into darkness slowly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Streetwise kept his stance, covering the other Protectobots in case of\nsudden\n&gt; attack.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf looked up to Iron Raptor, silently walking over to Future\nZardus.\n&gt; The Vok warrior kept his sword pointed at the ground.  But he got a sensor\n&gt; lock on IR if she tried to run.  He would hunt his prey if the Maximal\n&gt; faction of the Cybertronians attempted anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper lowered his rifle, transforming to his hyena mode and padding\n&gt; over next to Demon Wulf, transforming back to biped mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw transformed to his beaten up attack vehicle mode, remaining\nwhere\n&gt; he was and arming his missile launchers just in case.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Beeline descended rapidly down towards the Alliance warriors.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch received FZ&#39;s transmission and had ordered everyone around\nhim\n&gt; and the cyber-bee to stand down.  He held out a wrist, Beeline landing on\nit\n&gt; and attaching to it.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror slowly got up, hearing the last bit of FZ&#39;s orders.  He made his\n&gt; way for Double Punch.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We won this round.  But we&#39;ll win the next.&quot; he laughed, transforming to\nhis\n&gt; badly damaged biped mode and landing on the ground next to FZ, stinger\n&gt; missile launchers in hand but missing missiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee continued hovering in the air, his arms akimbo and the missile\n&gt; launchers pointed at the sky.  He looked at the carnage around the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire and the damage caused to the CF, and wondered if the\n&gt; Maximals considered this a victory.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot transformed to his winged wolf creature mode, taking flight and\n&gt; preparing for the next attack.  He&#39;d known Autobots as well as Maximals to\nbe\n&gt; stupid.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Ares waited, weapons pointed at the ground.  Hopefully negotiations\nwouldn&#39;t\n&gt; work and he could get back to slaughtering Maxis.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Receiving a transmission from FZ, Sun Crusher raised an arm towards\nReflector\n&gt; and pointed towards the CF.\n&gt;\n&gt; The second-in-command of the Brotherhood powered up the boosters in his\nfeet\n&gt; to full power and took off for the bridge of the CF.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Reflector nodded at Sun Crusher, tossing his rifle into subspace and\nheading\n&gt; for the CF as he flew through the air at full speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Minion stopped, sliding across the ground at the sudden stop while going\nover\n&gt; 100 MPH.  He transformed while still moving, his biped mode crashing to\nthe\n&gt; ground, the War Machine jumping up quickly, jogging for Chaos.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Chaos had four more missiles armed, but transformed to biped mode, a\n&gt; double-tubed rocket launcher in hand.  He lowered it, looking to Minion as\nhe\n&gt; approached him.\n&gt; &quot;This may be interesting.&quot; he laughed, charging his optic weapons to full\n&gt; power if he needed to open fire quickly and take people down.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis was only a few meters from Blades and First Aid, but stopped his\n&gt; crawl when he saw two other Protectobots run over to their comrades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slag...it.&quot; he coughed, looking up to see Scattershot land by him.\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt;\n&gt; Vehement cursed at FZ&#39;s order.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Cowards.  That Warrior of Light shall not survive-\n&gt;\n&gt; He walked over to the opened part of the bridge, seeing Reflector and Sun\n&gt; Crusher heading for him.  The cannons on the ends of his arms took the\nforms\n&gt; of hands once more.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron landed on his feet, rather happy with the deal FZ had made.  His\n&gt; plans hadn&#39;t been disrupted in the slightest.  It had in fact saved him\n&gt; trouble.\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodded to Firestarter.  &quot;Stand down.  We will get what we want either\nway.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Firestarter gave a crooked grin.  &quot;Excellent.  I hope Shockwave fairs as\nwell\n&gt; in his mission.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
