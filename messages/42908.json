Hopefully the Council wont\norder us to stop these OOCs, this is an important, and historical day.\nAlthough for all the wrong reasons. The words of the President after the\nattack on Pearl Harbor work here, this is a day that will live in\ninfamy.(My spelling may be off, but that is not important) I have been\nfollowing this all day, in school and out. The images of the planes\ncrashing into the WTC Towers, and the towers collapsing, as well as a\nside of our Department of Defense HG, the Pentagon destroyed, are truely\nevil. I hope that the United States of America respond quickly with\nlethal force. The Department of Defense taped into messages to Bin\nLadden, saying that they had hit two targets. This is proof enough for\nme. The sites may not be named by name, but we know what they are\ntalking about. These people must die. And terrorists all over the world\nmust die. As you can see, i am talkative on this subject, and I&#39;m\nwilling to talk to anyone who wishes to discuss this. God bless, and\nlong live the United States of America.\n\n"}}
