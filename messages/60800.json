In \norder to defeat him, and regarding that I haven&#39;t your wise opinion, \nI tought that was good idea set a temporaly peace with them and work \ntogether to defeat him... After that I was thinking destroy them or \neven use the peace to do a plan where I can destroy Unicron and at \nthe same timekill most maximals as can...
