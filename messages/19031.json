She knew she had to use her wits.  This bot seemed \nvery intelegent and possably could make a strong ally.  He had said \nhe was high up in the ranks. This opened a window of opertunity for \nher.  She transformed into bot mode and walked over to Devilduer.\n\n&quot;Very well, I shall accompany you to where ever you need me.  I am in \nneed of a cr.&quot; she said, looking down at her burn marks and leaking \ngun shot holes. \n&quot;I shall join you.  You said earlier that you were high up in the \nranks? That you make you...what..second, third in command?&quot;  She \nbowed and showed proper respect to a higher ranking officer. On \nCybertron, he wuld have been bowing to her, but then again, she \nwasn&#39;t on Cybertron.  &quot;I shall follow you commander.&quot;  she stood up \nand looked at him.  Taking a few steps closer to him, she said in a \nhushed voice, &quot;And I meant what I said earlier, we would have made a \ngood team back home.&quot; She smiled at him and then started to walked \ndown the hallway. Then she turned and faced him, &quot;Ah, which way to \nyour CR room?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Motioning Threadshot and Catgut to be quiet, DevilDuer steps around \n&gt; the corner, looking at Diamond and seeing the drain. He was a bit \n&gt; surprized, he had had no idea that there were any drains whatsoever \n&gt; in the base that he had spent most of his life on earth in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright,&quot; he says, putting away his gun. He knew it would be \n&gt; useless to try and hit something so small anyways, and there were \n&gt; always autoguns and Threadshot and Catgut in case of trouble, &quot;I \n&gt; gotta admit that yer good, but I neve&#39; said that I wanted ya dead.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He frowns at the drain, &quot;And don&#39;t bother with that thing, a \ncommand \n&gt; from me can lock it up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In truth, he had no idea if the drain even had a locking system, he \n&gt; had never seen it before.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Anyways, you look like yer a bot who knows what she&#39;s doin&#39;. I \nthink \n&gt; I said before that the Alliance is the superior faction on the \n&gt; planet, I think you&#39;d do well with us. Ya got my word that I ain&#39;t \n&gt; gonna shot at ya no more if you come along peacefully. If ya give \nme \n&gt; a fight, I&#39;m gonna shut that drain, sick the autoguns on ya, and \n&gt; we&#39;ll see where we get from there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
