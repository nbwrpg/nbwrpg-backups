Hydras reply comes a=\r\ns a shock to the Autobot, as he gives a blank look all of a sudden. He coul=\r\nd not answer his question without hesitation in his voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; As - as f=\r\nar as I know, I - I... I - don&#39;t think I&#39;m related to him. I deeply admire =\r\nhim, yes, but I honestly do not think I&#39;m related to him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His deeply =\r\nhidden power of his spark recedes and quickly returns him to his regular he=\r\night. He had no notion of how to control it, nor had he known what it was. =\r\nAs it reverses, he suddenly feels a good portion of power leave his body, y=\r\net, he was not about to abandon the act of defending himself against Hydras=\r\n or Rodimus for that matter. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Power or no power, you&#39;ve abducted one=\r\n of my own, and turned him into your evil pawn. No matter the consequence, =\r\nI will stand my ground and do whatever it takes to rightfully return my lea=\r\nder to his role as the commander of the Autobots. Even if I have to saccrif=\r\nice my own spark to accomplish my mission. That is why I&#39;m here, not for po=\r\nwer, not for lust, not for domination. I&#39;m here because know it or not, som=\r\neone who was once very close to me, needs my help and I never turn my hand =\r\naway when a fellow comrade is in grave danger. I&#39;m sure you would do the sa=\r\nme for one of your own.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He turns to Rodimus. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; If I do not suc=\r\nceed this time, I will suffer my defeat honorably. I will fall many times i=\r\nf I have to. But rest assured Rodimus, when the time is right, and you fina=\r\nlly reach out to me, I promise my hand will be there to reach out to you. A=\r\nnd when I do, I won&#39;t let go. I promise, I will not abandon you or this cau=\r\nse. As dark as you are now, you may not understand, but hopefully one day, =\r\nyou will.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He then turns back to Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; All right Hydras, I&#39;l=\r\nl let you decide how you wish to fight. After all, this is your domain, and=\r\n I am an intruder here. &quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Deep down Tucson wished he could avoid a sc=\r\nuffle. He wished he could just bargain with Hydras but after seeing that he=\r\n was a combination of Megatron and Galvatron, that made for a different sit=\r\nuation all together. To him, Decepticons were still his enemies. He was how=\r\never still taken aback by Hydra&#39;s question. While he looks to Hydras he thi=\r\nnks to himself once more.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Me?

He would have been glad to be rid of this annoyance, yes,=\r\n but it would have been somewhat disappointing as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when R=\r\nodimus was spun around by Tuscon, the Autobot may have missed the wicked sm=\r\nile on his face, When Tuscon tried to ram Rodimus into a wall, he may not h=\r\nave noticed that the sound of crunching metal was not Rodimus&#39; but the rein=\r\nrorced wall shearing and tearing under the force of the assault. It was not=\r\n the sound of Rodimkus&#39; defeat that resonated through the room, but it was =\r\nsomething else!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many of the same teachers that had instructed Tusc=\r\non had trained a young Hot Rod as well - Jazz, Prowl, Brawn, Kup, even Opti=\r\nmus himself! And while Rodimus no longer clearly remembered all these ones =\r\nand what they had meant to him, thier lessons were still ground into him, a=\r\nnd his reflexes that had been honed over the years of battle! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Als=\r\no, this was no young Hot Rod that stood there before them, but a figure sha=\r\npped by the energy of the matrix into a character of leadership, power and =\r\nability. He no longer had access to the knowledge and wisdom of the matrix,=\r\n the energy having been stripped from him. But that power that had been imp=\r\narted was still there, reconfigured by the power of the predacon shell prog=\r\nram! He was faster, stronger and far more durable then Hot Rod ever was, he=\r\n was DARK RODIMUS!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when Rodimus hit the wall it was not truely =\r\npain that he felt, but the elation that a true battle was in the making. He=\r\n felt that charge that all warriors felt when they faced a foe that had som=\r\ne metal! It was an eagerness twisted by Predacon programming into something=\r\n dark and loathsome. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when he stood and turned around it was no=\r\nt defeat in his stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy yourself to be a Prime d=\r\no you, scrappling?&quot; Rodimus said his tone still mocking as he raised his ar=\r\nm, smiling as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well let&#39;s see what you got!=\r\n&quot; With a thought he fired a blast of plasma energy from his arm mounted can=\r\nnon at this new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the moment appeared to be po=\r\nsturing for Hydras!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Remember, the matrix that is housed withi=\r\nn Rodimus has no energy of its own, only the housing. It does not have the =\r\npower to reach out and transform anyone, although I do have some ideas. I a=\r\nm not sure if you want to redo your post, or let it go as it stands. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Dark rodimus)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
