I thought it was another \n&gt; quake. Okay so what did Legacy do ta deserve another shout match with \n&gt; Tucson?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks back to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The usual, he tried to go against Tucson&#39;s orders. And you know what \n&gt; happens if we disrespect a Prime, right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ohh yeah, that&#39;s why I would never dare ta do anything like that, noooo \n&gt; waaaay, especially with Tucson. As far as I&#39;m concerned, like Rodimus, \n&gt; what he says, goes. Legacy better watch his step, that&#39;s two strikes \n&gt; against him now. And yeah, I&#39;ve been keepn&#39; count.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot frowns.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s even still with us. Something about him so creeps me \n&gt; out it&#39;s not funny.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLord Elder watched as Legacy walked away and Tuscon and Talon began\ntalking. He sighed again and began walking to where the others were.\nHe could hear thier conversation.\n\n&quot;Are you really counting?&quot; Lord Elder and Quickstride a curious look\non his face. His face and form looked a little bigger than before, his\nface clear and shiny, and yet he still managed to have a haggered look\non his face.\n\n&quot;While you are counting, don&#39;t forget while everyone else was off\nfighting in the battle when Cyclonus and his drones were sacking\neveryone including the Predacons that Legacy single handedly held the\nArk against 5 of Cyclonus&#39; most powerful cronies. When we had to go\nrescue Rodimus who was there helping, taking much of the damage and\nexpending his precious energon to shield you guys. That was Legacy.&quot;\n\nLord Elder frowned, &quot;Has anyone ever even talked with legacy? Does\nanyone even know the first thing about him? He arrived here from\nPrimus knows where and no one even asked him anything. You trust him\nwhen the energon chips are down, but now you are ready to boot him\nout.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are we Maximals or rabble. If we turn to fighting among\nourselves then what are we?&quot; Lord Elder shook his head as he began to\nwalk away. &quot;And before you go betting on who would win the battle you\nwere discussing, you might want to find out more about Legacy first.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
