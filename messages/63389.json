You could say I have muscles. \nI guess you felt them in my neck.  I&#39;m not totally this way, the\nmuscle sections in my chest and waist are meant to section for\ntransformation, and I use nanobots for repairs and system maintence.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He reached over and took her other hand and put it on his right\nupper arm, to feel the somewhat soft and forgiving exterior and the\nsynthetic muscles in his arm.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
