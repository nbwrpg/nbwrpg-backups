Luckily he wasn&#39;t \nbeyond the repairs internal repairs could fix up.  He looked around, and by \nhis scans, he and the four other Protectobots were the only ones alive on the \nbridge.  He should&#39;ve figured.  None of the other Maximals were as armored as \nthem. None of them had been prepped for battle.  A shot from a laser pistol \nthe chest would&#39;ve probably killed them off.\n\n&quot;GET UP!&quot; he yelled, checking the scans. \n\nGroove slowly got up.  &quot;I hate Predacons!&quot; he yelled.  &quot;We should kill them \none by one!&quot;\n\nHot Spot was just a tad bit surprised at this.  Usually Groove was relaxed \nand happy, and he was a known pacifist.  But evidently, the death had changed \nhim for the moment.  Understandable.\n\nBlades looked at the other Protectobots.  &quot;Groove is right!  I say we kick \nPred skid plate!  We&#39;ve been nice neighbors long enough!&quot;\n\nFirst Aid checked the main scanners.  &quot;Every Maximal is dead on this ship \naccording to my readings.  We can&#39;t let this go unpunished.&quot;\n\n&quot;I say we thrash all the Preds we find.&quot; Streetwise sighed, making sure his \narm wasn&#39;t damaged.  When he concluded it wasn&#39;t and it just hurt, he looked \nto Hot Spot for an answer.\n\nThe Protectobot leader sighed.  &quot;Is there a battle?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;d say so!&quot; First Aid yelled.  &quot;There&#39;s a gargantuan of a battle at \nthe...Cybertronian Fire.  It&#39;s the CF!&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve found it.&quot; Hot Spot smiled.  &quot;Let&#39;s roll out!&quot; he yelled, transforming \ninto his blue fire truck mode, driving out of the ship and towards the CF.\n\nGroove transformed into his police motorcycle form and followed, thinking of \nrevenge, which wasn&#39;t like him.\n\nFirst Aid transformed to his ambulance mode, following Hot Spot at his top \nspeed.\n\nStreetwise transformed to his police car mode, folloiwng.\n\nBlades ran after them, not being dumb enough to transform into his alternate \nmode indoors.  When he stepped out onto the grass, he jumped up, his body \nshaping into a helicopter, the blades twirling quickly, the Maximal gaining \naltitude and flying at the same speed as his comrades below him, all heading \nfor the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n"}}
