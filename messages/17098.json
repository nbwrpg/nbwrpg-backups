SnowCat had already spotted him. \nLunarpine\n&gt; nearly paniced  as her questions flew at him. &quot;I&#39;m Lunarpine, \nMaximal\n&gt; Nocturnal recon specialist, previously stationed here before my \nunexpected\n&gt; leave of absence&quot; He looked her in the eyes glareing as if in a \nstareing\n&gt; contest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine followed the echoing halls to the room Ramulus was in. A \ntable\n&gt; with what appeared to be weapons sat next to him full of a new form \nof gun\n&gt; he couldn&#39;t quite recognize. He listened to the conversation \nbetween the Ark\n&gt; and the Cybertronian fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If it&#39;s reinforcements you need just turn around.&quot; The new body of\n&gt; Lunarpine stepped into the room curious as to what his comerade in \narms\n&gt; would think and how he&#39;d react to the remodel.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 04, 2000 7:11 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Old memories die hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Kluster/Grimmler/Slayer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus glances at the weapons on the table once more, \nnodding. &quot;Allright,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll ask the Cybertronian Fire for reinforcements and equipment, \nthen\n&gt; we&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; be ready. If this breaks out into a battle, we can&#39;t be \nunprepared.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He taps his comm-link, sending a transmission to the Cybertronian \nFire,\n&gt; &gt; requesting troops and a dozen or so cloaking devices.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Kluster turns around to face the console as Ramulus&#39; transmission \ncomes\n&gt; in.\n&gt; &gt; He sighs, tapping his comm-link.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Firearm, Proto,&quot; he says into it, &quot;Your assistance is needed at \nthe Ark,\n&gt; &gt; quickly. Bring a dozen cloaking devices with you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;On my way,&quot; both Proto and Firearm respond, both of them running \noff\n&gt; toward\n&gt; &gt; the equipment rooms.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Grimmler nods, contacting Kluster to verify what this bot was \nsaying.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;There&#39;s a bot here that says \nyou told\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; to go with him. His name&#39;s Valtron.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah,&quot; Kluster&#39;s voice replies, &quot;I told him to go. Report to me\n&gt; &gt; periodically, I want to know what&#39;s happening.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Grimmler looks back at Valtron. &quot;Allright, I guess I&#39;m going with \nyou,&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; says, ready to follow Valtron.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Slayer recieves Prebon&#39;s orders, walking toward the bridge, his \nsuit still\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He enters, his red optics scanning across the bots in the room, \ngrowling\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; he sees Spears. Slayer turns to Prebon, bowing slightly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am ready to kill this Ramulus, Master,&quot; he says, glancing \nthreateningly\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; Spears as he does so.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
