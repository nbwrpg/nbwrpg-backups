It was all about speed, precision, balance, \n    disciplin=\r\ne, grace, and of course effectiveness.\n\n    He could see potential in her a=\r\nnd turns his head in both Nightlight and \n    Bumps direction.\n\n    &quot; Bump&#39;=\r\ns right, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential \n    f=\r\nor train&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot. You got the right moves, mody, and grace, and =\r\n\n    once you&#39;re trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Maste=\r\nr \n    Yokitron once said, that a student often shows potential even if the=\r\ny don&#39;t \n    realize it themselves. Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya wan=\r\nt the \n    training, just see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a t=\r\nraining \n    program for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it t=\r\noo.. It&#39;s a \n    perfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra trai=\r\nning under your \n    belts.&quot;\n\n    He positions himself again.\n\n    &quot; It wou=\r\nld really help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta \n    pul=\r\nl on ya in the past. The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \n   =\r\n that Master Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what cou=\r\nld \n    come down the pike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less likely t=\r\na get \n    infected by negative influences, simply because there&#39;s no thoug=\r\nht energy ta \n    hold onto. Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark. Bad stuff=\r\n just goes in one \n    way, and out the other. You guys had a lot on your m=\r\ninds when Hydras took \n    you. And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can=\r\n be. I bet my spark plugs \n    that if you and Rodimus train with me, I can=\r\n get both of ya up ta our level \n    and that&#39;ll make you a pair of the str=\r\nongest Autobots this side of the \n    galaxy, but not the type of strength =\r\nmost warriors perceive. This type of \n    strength is the strength of spiri=\r\nt, inner peace, and harmony. A perfect \n    balance between spark, soul, an=\r\nd mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dexterity \n    aquired in Ninjabot traini=\r\nng, the type of dexterity that makes even Tucson \n    Prime a bit different=\r\n then the traditional Autobot Commander. It&#39;s a \n    difference Hydras has =\r\nno inclination how ta fend off.

It was all \n    about speed, precision, balance, &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;discipline, grace, and of course \n    effectiveness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He could see=\r\n potential in her and turns his head in \n    both Nightlight and &lt;BR&gt;Bumps =\r\ndirection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Bump&#39;s right, that&#39;s \n    somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but =\r\nI see a lotta potential &lt;BR&gt;for train&#39;n ya as a \n    Ninjabot. You got the =\r\nright moves, mody, and grace, and &lt;BR&gt;once you&#39;re \n    trained, there&#39;s gon=\r\nna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Master &lt;BR&gt;Yokitron \n    once said, that a=\r\n student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t \n    &lt;BR&gt;realize it thems=\r\nelves. Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the \n    &lt;BR&gt;training, just=\r\n see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training \n    &lt;BR&gt;program =\r\nfor ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s \n    a &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nperfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra training under \n    y=\r\nour &lt;BR&gt;belts.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He positions himself again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; It would really=\r\n \n    help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta &lt;BR&gt;pull on =\r\nya in \n    the past. The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthat Master \n    Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what=\r\n could &lt;BR&gt;come \n    down the pike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less =\r\nlikely ta get \n    &lt;BR&gt;infected by negative influences, simply because ther=\r\ne&#39;s no thought \n    energy ta &lt;BR&gt;hold onto. Clear mind, clear soul, clear =\r\nspark. Bad stuff just \n    goes in one &lt;BR&gt;way, and out the other. You guys=\r\n had a lot on your minds \n    when Hydras took &lt;BR&gt;you. And that couldn&#39;t b=\r\ne helped, but now it can be. I \n    bet my spark plugs &lt;BR&gt;that if you and =\r\nRodimus train with me, I can get both \n    of ya up ta our level &lt;BR&gt;and th=\r\nat&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest \n    Autobots this side of the &lt;BR&gt;g=\r\nalaxy, but not the type of strength most \n    warriors perceive. This type =\r\nof &lt;BR&gt;strength is the strength of spirit, \n    inner peace, and harmony. A=\r\n perfect &lt;BR&gt;balance between spark, soul, and \n    mind. And yeah, there&#39;s =\r\na lotta dexterity &lt;BR&gt;aquired in Ninjabot training, \n    the type of dexter=\r\nity that makes even Tucson &lt;BR&gt;Prime a bit different then \n    the traditio=\r\nnal Autobot Commander. It&#39;s a &lt;BR&gt;difference Hydras has no \n    inclination=\r\n how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the direction &lt;BR&gt;Tucson is gonna take, \n    and i=\r\nf you guys were trained in our art, so more power &lt;BR&gt;to ya.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He \n  =\r\n  then looks to Bump, as the repair bench does its job to repair the \n    &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;internal damages done to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that \n   =\r\n reminds me... I need new hydraulic shock &lt;BR&gt;absorbers, timing belt, and I=\r\n \n    know my struts need work, new tires, body &lt;BR&gt;work, and Ty Rods fixed=\r\n. Oh \n    yeah, need a new front and back end alignment &lt;BR&gt;too.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To=\r\n repair the \n    damgages to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehic=\r\nle &lt;BR&gt;mode, to \n    prepare for the rest of his repairs. He also notices a=\r\n busted &lt;BR&gt;headlight \n    on the left side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Scrap, throw in a new =\r\nheadlight for the left side, \n    new bumpers, front, &lt;BR&gt;back, side, and a=\r\nwww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up. \n    Probably because I &lt;BR&gt;smacked that=\r\n tree real hard in alt form. After this \n    is all done, I am so &lt;BR&gt;gonna=\r\n give those preds the bill, literally. In \n    other words, I need a total =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;overhaul ta my alt form. And if you can help \n    it, I&#39;d like ta hold =\r\nonta this &lt;BR&gt;one for a while.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, Super \n    Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight =\r\nStood up And leave her \n    daughter in the bed, she smiled and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to her \n    daughter &quot;I be righ back in no time, just =\r\nremain here&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &gt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight \n    smiled and she walked toward the =\r\ninterior of the cr, she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to Bump and =\r\nsaid &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive \n    skills that I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT quizzically, &quot;What do \n    you mean?&quot; He=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; manipulated a few controls on his screen. &quot;If you are \n    looking=\r\n for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; specific ability, I can see what I can do, but as far \n    a=\r\ns skills, that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is something you learn.
