They\nwere both dwelling on their own thoughts to an extent. Mantle, Aqua,\nand Rubble were in the holo-rooms training with the rest of the\nMaximals.\n&quot;So did you get to talk to him?&quot; Mist asked her &#39;daughter&#39; when they\nstopped near a console to check on the status of the city. Cinder\nshook her head a bit sadly.\n\n&quot;No. They went straight to training.&quot; She said and tapped a few keys.\nThey stood there in silence, and then Cinder got bored with all the\ninfo that the computer was telling her and the two women walkeed on.\n&quot;I wish they could get some rest though. I don&#39;t know about them, but\nI&#39;d get bored always fighting.&quot;\n\nMist nodded in reply, and her and Cinder heard voices up ahead near\nthe exit to the city. They sped up and headed toward them.\n\n\n\nCyndro had taken care of all the rest of the configuration from the\nextra parts that were added to the Element from the Cybertronian Fire\nto make Maximal City. His nanobots were cleaning up the field where\nthe old ship used to be, and there was barely any trace of it\nanymore. The ground was being smoothed over and blast marks and scrap\nmetal were being removed. The nanobots carried in new grass molecule\nby molecule and there was now new greenery growing around the city.\nThe solar panels were sunning themselves successfully, and Cyndro\ncould feel his power rising to full after the battle.\n\nChecking the scanners, Cyndro realized that he had missed the fact\nthat several bots were standing outside the city. He made a mental\nnote not to slip up like that again, and then proceeded to meet them.\n\nThe large entrance hatch to Maximal City opened and a screen detached\nfrom the cealing, carried by a few metalling beams out of the city.\nOn the screen was a boyish bot&#39;s face, smiling at all the bots\naround. He counted ten in all.\n\n&quot;Hello, everyone,&quot; he said with a friendly tone, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to keep\nyou waiting, but getting a city set up is a bit hard.&quot;\n\nHe then looked around, and the screen turned so that he could look at\neveryone through the cameras on its corners. &quot;I&#39;m Cyndro. The city&#39;s\nmind. Its nice to meet you.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
