She spins, and it glances off of her \n&gt; shoulder plating. Lynxiz begins to fall, and is forced to break her \n&gt; fall by placing her hands on the ground, and pushing herself back \n&gt; up into a standing stance. She backs off slightly, keeping her eye \n&gt; on Stranato. She circles, snarling and holding her left upper chest \n&gt; wound, taking a defensive stance. She prepares to either attack or \n&gt; dodge.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 22 May 2001, at 16:16, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The rifle was knocked from Stranato&#39;s hand and his left arm was\n&gt; &gt; slashed.
