It\n&gt; never fully fixed, but i \n&gt; read the message board to find out the mails ive\n&gt; been missing. In other \n&gt; words, just because your mail didnt reach my mailbox\n&gt; does not mean i havent \n&gt; read it. I hope that staightens things out.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
