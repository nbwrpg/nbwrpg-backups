It is \nnow, your duty to kill him, Aerotaur.  Not a savage grudge, but a law \nannounced. We will not kill like ancient transformeres.  His so \ncalled, lackeys, also have a death sentence for protecting aiding a \nfellons escape.  Does this suit you both.&quot;\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Trinity::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When wiull we started to train Uncle Aerotaur?????&quot; said Trinity\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;I&#39;m sorry Grounded but Deemos has hurt us too many times for \n&gt; me to let \n&gt; &gt; him live.  This is all because I let him go the first time he \n&gt; attacked.  As \n&gt; &gt; for you Sarge, I have just as much reason to kill him.  In our \nlast \n&gt; fight I \n&gt; &gt; lost an arm and a leg defending others.  I nearly died because \n&gt; there were \n&gt; &gt; bots in the battle that shouldn&#39;t have been there.  I couldn&#39;t \ncare \n&gt; less \n&gt; &gt; about his lackeys.  Now then, let&#39;s get to the meeting so we can \n&gt; finish it \n&gt; &gt; and start planning our attack.&quot;  He stands tall glaring at Sarge.\n\n\n"}}
