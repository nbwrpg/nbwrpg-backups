A possable end to the fight.*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t we all?&quot;\n\n* She relaxed and sighed.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve alread sent a transmission out to the Maximals to cease fire, if they \ndo as they&#39;re told then you can get you men back. Provided that you don&#39;t \njust turn around and start firing at us again.\nWe have more important things to do then fight, like repair the damage to \nour ship and so on. You have a battle at your own base to deal with, so I \ndon&#39;t think you need this fight too.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor shifted her weight onto the other leg*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s been a long day for all of us. Enough is enough. As soon as the \nMaximals cease, we&#39;ll start. How does that sound?&quot;\n\n* She waited calmly for his answer, just wanting everything to get done and \nover with. But her stance was still broad shouldered and straight, giving no \nsight to any weakness, but her voice was not firm, but normal.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
