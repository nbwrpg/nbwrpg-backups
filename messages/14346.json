She walked \ntowards Testifier, growling. &quot;Do you know what those sick, blood \nthirsty maximals would have done to her had I done what I did? Thye \nwould have put her through the worst kind of torture ever thought of, \njust for fun.  They would had made her suffer unspeakable pain and \nmisery and then let her die a slow death.  I did her a favor and \nended it before they could have hurt her any more.  You take about \npain, I know pain.  Every time I close my eyes, I see her.  She \nhaunts my dreams and my mind every waking moment.  No matter what, I \nhave to live with this pain for the rest of my life.&quot;  \n\nShe was angry  and almost to the brink of tears. She growled and \nyelled at Testifier.\n\n&quot;I did what I had to do because she was my friend.  Because I cared, \nI did what I had to do.  I cared enough to save her pain and \nsuffering at the hands of our enemy.  And if you can&#39;t understand \nthat, then tothe pit with you.&quot;\n\nStood there for a moment looking at Testifier with pain and hurt in \nher eyes.  Just before she broke down, she transformed into wolf mode \nand ran out of the base.  She ran through the forest, trying to out \nrun her pain. \n  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tesifier gets up, charging towards Drill Bit and KitKat.
