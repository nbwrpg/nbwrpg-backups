So, just so that we don&#39;t have to go back and change \neverything from the last few days, Vulois found parts from the \noriginal device to use the TM2 and constructed his own. He turned TM3 \nand then the rest goes as I had. Sorry about all this. I&#39;ve screwed \nup everything and I apoligize. I will try to be better in the future.)\n\nVulois can&#39;t move. Up in the raptors he is being shot at by numerous \nPredacons, including one that seems to be very dominant. This must be \nHell Beast. The Bat Pred still sits idly by. Maybe he had gotten \nthrough to her. Maybe she does want to leave the preds. Before that \nthought can go any farther, a transmission comes in from Soundwave. \nVulois responds back, whispering so the preds can&#39;t hear him.\n\n&quot;Soundwave, I want you to use the machine on the mountain top to turn \nyourself TM3 and than join me at the Pred base. It seems through my \ncareless action of not charging my masker enough, I have almost \nruined our chance of forming a new breed. Maybe later, but not now. \nBut I still have a way we can both benefit from this. Become a TM3 \nand join me at the Pred base. Vulois out.\n\nVulios finds a large space close to him and ducks the fire of the \nPreds. He TF&#39;s to Robot Mode and pulls out one of his blasters, just \nfor protection. He yells down to them.\n\n&quot;Hell Beast, I wish to propose a deal. I have something you want and \nyou have something I want. It is very simple. I will give you the \nsecret of TM3 technology, plus return this invention to you, if \nSoundwave and I are both promoted to joint second in command. We \nwould both have the same luxiuries, and have to answer only to you. \nWhat do you say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
