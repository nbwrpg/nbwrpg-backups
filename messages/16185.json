Sorry! Sorry! I din&#39;t mean to upset you Necromancer! I don&#39;t like \nhaving people mad at me, so I just wanna say I&#39;m really, really sorry! \nSorry!)\n\nTavatron snarled softly under her breath. The sudden arrival of Necromancer \nhad startled her. The current situation coupled with the past circumstances \nhad left her rather edgy. She needed something to direct her anger at, \nsomething she stood a chance of destroying. Tavatron pulled her ears back in \nanger. She really was upset. She was mad at the Alliance for what they had \ndone to her, her commander, and this beautiful glade.\n\nTavatron&#39;s vision had begun to grow progressively worse, but she could still \nsee well enough to battle. Tavatron turned back to Dinobot as he turned \ntowards her. He was sparking, but nothing nearly as serious as she thought. \nIt was the mech-fluid loss that had really worried her.\nHer own shoulder still sparked occasionally, but had stopped bleeding a \nlittle while ago. Suddenly, out of nowhere and with absolutely no warning \nwhat-so-ever Dinobot began yelling at her! A low growl began to form in the \nbase of her throat. This was the last straw. She had reached her limit, \nDInobot&#39;s sudden outburst was all she needed to send her into a fit of rage. \nShe wasn&#39;t a child! SHe was a warrior!\n\n&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be talking! I&#39;m not the one whose missing half my armor!&quot;\n\nShe truned from DInobot and focused her gaze on Necromancer:\n\n&quot;Take Dinobot back to base, he needs repairs. I feel like walking today.&quot;\n\nShe cast one lst glare in Dinobot&#39;s direction before setting off, only to \nget blasted in the side by Catgut&#39;s shots. She rolled for a few seconds \nbefore righting herself and returning his fire with several optic blasts of \nher own.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
