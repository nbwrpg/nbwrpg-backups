The ground beneath her body was surprisingly cool, despite \nthe amount of time she had spent upon it. Part of her never wanted to wake, \nknowing that once she did Dinobot would insist they return to the base for \nrepairs. The other part, however, knew she was only at 65, 70% power and in \ndesperate need of repairs. These thoughts, however, seemed to be nothing \nmore than a dream themselves, slipping from her mind like sand running \nthrough her fingers.\n\nHer mind drifted back to a more carefree time. A time without rules or \nboundries, just fun. She remembered wandering the streets as she scanned the \ncrowd for an easy target. Once spotted she raised her sword high above her \nhead so as to reflect the morning light. On cue a small &#39;bot ran across the \nstreet, bumping into the intended target. He continued on his way. He was \nonly a kid, not much older than Tavatron. Most &#39;bots just ignored him or \nyelled some single-word insult at his fast departing form.\n\nLife had been like this for as long as they could remember.

They had stolen from \nthe wrong &#39;bot in a desperate attempt to feed themselves. They were offered \na choice, join the forces or be placed in seperate homes, never to see each \nother again. The choice seemed clear at the time. They did what they had to \ndo to survive. They always had...\n\nWith much effort Tavatron managed to finally pull herself from her deep \nslumber. She blinked multiple times before finally realizing where she was. \nShe stretched silently before standing, gazing at her still reflection in \nthe water. So much had happened since then. So many battles, so much death, \nit all blended to become her life, a life she had grown to love despite \nherself. The life of a warrior. Her heart had thawed over time, making her \nappear weak in the eyes of some. Tosome, however, her weakness was seen as \nher greatest strength. With a sighe she raised her head to the sky:\n\n&quot;We should get going. They must be worried about us.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
