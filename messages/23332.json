Anything \nenclosed in --&#39;s in my posts is &#39;thought speach&#39;, and Shadow Cat and \nSnow Tech (and anyone else) wouldn&#39;t even know it was going on, much \nless hear it. Prowl and Iron Raptor share sparks in a way, and with \nthrough that share emotions and thoughts.\n\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl calmly watches Shadow Cat trip over Snow Tech and then yell at \nhim. He looks over at Angel Prime as the bot drives up.\n\n&quot;I..&quot; he begins, when he hears Snow Tech&#39;s comment. His eyes narrow as \nhe turns his head toward the new bot. He feels the anger flare up in \nhim. This new body was very eager for battle, and seemed to preffer \nthe more raging emotions.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says in a calm and deadly voice as he takes a step toward \nSnow Tech, &quot;_I_ am Iron&#39;s lover, and if you have a problem with that, \nthere&#39;s a simple way to work it out.&quot;\n\nHis wing guns level themselves with Snow Tech&#39;s head and chest (two \nmissile launchers and two rapid-fire laser guns). Prowl had just \nchallenged the bot to a duel.\n\nThe sound of laughter reaches his audio receptors, but Prowl&#39;s \nattention was focused on this new bot. His wing orbs probe the area, \npicking up Aerotaur&#39;s position and keeping track of all the other \nbots. He&#39;d be aware of anymovement.\n\n-What in the pit is this maniac talking about?- He thinks to Iron \nRaptor, keeping his eyes on Snow Tech.\n\n&quot;Take your hand off her. Now,&quot; Prowl orders. If the bot didn&#39;t \ncomply... Well, good Christmas ornaments were always welcome.\n\nProwl could almost hope that Snow Tech would rebel. That way Prowl \ncould test this new body....\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Shadow Cat and Snow Tech dislodge from their tangle of limbs. \nShadow Cat \n&gt; jumps to her feet, embarrased that Snow Tech would humiluate her \nthis way*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; God you can be SO dumb Snow Tech. You do have brakes, don&#39;t you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked at prowl how had just then spoken, and nodded*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yeah, old friends. We where best buds back on the home planet, but \nwe had \n&gt; to leave on a scouting mission and where gone for a long period of \ntime, \n&gt; when we got back, IR was gone. Since we couldn&#39;t ask the mission \ncontrol \n&gt; unit where she went, we broke into their computer system and tracked \nher to \n&gt; this sector. It was then all up to chance to find out where she \nwas.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *She turns her head to Iron Raptor and speaks*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So, i&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve changed since we&#39;ve last met. Er... It&#39;s, um, \n&gt; different, thats for shure!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She smiles and goes to give Ir a hug, for old times sake, triping \nover \n&gt; Snow Tech, who had not risen off the ground since he fell, but layed \ntheir \n&gt; and watched every-one from his ground view.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;SNOW TECH! YOU ASS!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Tech smiles and gets to his feet, dusting himself off and \nwalks over \n&gt; to IR, grabing her arm, causing the little &#39;un to lose his sence of \nbalance. \n&gt; the little &#39;un twists out of ir&#39;s grasp and flies to Prowl, curious \nto what \n&gt; this thing was. Meanwhile, Snow Tech turns to Prowl*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hi, I&#39;m Iron&#39;s Lover. &#39;Scuse me while i go make\n\n\n"}}
