The bubble begins to \nclimb higher in the water till it reaches its destination, a large \nMEtal struture that seems to be spidering out into other structures. \nOutside along each building multiple construction drones work \nbuilding towers of energy, the entire place glowing ominously. The \nbubble slows its speed and soon enters a large building at the center \nof all this, all water being cut off by an energy field. Once inside \nthe bubble fizzles out and drops Darkfate onto the floor as an \nOrangish bot walks up to him accompanied by what appears to be a \nblack skeleton with a large green energy field built around it.\n\nHooligan: &quot;Summon your men...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
