Seeing Breakdown and Hiss he sighed.  \n-Predacons,- he thought, noticing their shape, size, and colors, -I guess the \nArk has been conqured-.  Raising his laser rifle, which came from subspace, \nhe took aim at Breakdown.\n\n--------\n\nSmokescreen came from the foilage, his electro-discharge rifle ready.  \nLooking around he saw a few craters.  &quot;Rather deserted.&quot; Smokescreen \nactivating his com to the giant ship.  &lt;This is the Maximal unit, \nSmokescreen, respond please&gt;\n\n-------\n\nRamhorn jumped a little, hearing Smokescreen message suddenly.  &lt;This is \nRamhorn, welcome, Smokescreen.  I guess you could say I&#39;m temporarily in \ncommand, defense wise at least.  Go to the door in front of you and enter.  I \nwill be there to great you shortly after&gt;\n\n-------\n\n&lt;Alright...&gt; Smokescreen said slowly over his com, ending the comlink.  \nWalking to the door in front of him, the massive orange-yellow door slid \nopen, Smokescreen entering the doors shutting and sealing behind him.\n\n--------\n\nBeachcomber was about to pull the trigger, but decided not too.  There could \nbe mass reinforcements from the Ark if he attacked.  Jumping from the \nfoilage, he slammed he rifle across Hiss&#39; face, sending the Predacon merc. to \nthe ground, mech-fluid trickling down his face.\n\nBreakdown laughed, uppercutting, sending Beachcomber slamming to his back.\n&quot;Worthless Maximal.&quot; Breakdown said with a smile, jumping downwards at \nBeachcomber.  Beachcomber raised his feet, Breakdown landing on them, \nBeachcomber yelling out in pain as the Alliance member hung in the air \nmomentarily, but with all his strength the Maximal sent Breakdown flying into \na tree behind him.\n\n"}}
