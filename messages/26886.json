She briefly \nwondered why he was reacting like this. Perhaps he knew something she \ndidn&#39;t? Maybe Vlad was a threat? But she doubted that. A bot would \nhave to be suicidal to do anything threatening in an enemy base, \nespecially one like the Iron Fist.\n\nShe looked back at Vlad, waiting for him to speak.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * D kept his eyes trained on Vlad, glancing down at his little \nwolf-dog as \n&gt; she walked up and seemed to nuzzle Fenox for attention.\n&gt; In his mind it was only natural for females to recognize each other \nso it \n&gt; didn&#39;t bother him, but Vlad did.\n&gt; D was new there but Fenox had been the first person he met and was \nnice to \n&gt; him so he felt it his duty to watch out for her and protect her, \neven though \n&gt; his beast mode senses tried to take over sometimes and made him \npossessive \n&gt; of her.\n&gt; D took in a breath and let it out quickly as Fenox have him a \nreasuring pet, \n&gt; not moving and his eyes still triened on Vlad.\n&gt; He just didn&#39;t trust him.\n&gt; But it made D growl again when he looked at Fenox again and saw her \nsmiling \n&gt; at him, making him feel possessive again and bare his teeth at \nVlad.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://w\n\n\n"}}
