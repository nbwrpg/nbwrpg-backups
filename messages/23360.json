His eyes narrow, but then he laughs.\n\n&quot;Overprotective and ugly, eh? You&#39;re not exactly beautiful yourself, \nkitty.&quot;\n\nHe chuckles at Snow Tech&#39;s next comment. &quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t injure Iron \nRaptor. I&#39;m a very good aim, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get along \nanyways.&quot;\n\nThis was not like him at all, but there was something about this bot \nthat made Prowl want to open fire. Prowl&#39;s logic circuits override \nthat urge, and he makes a mental note to remember to learn how to \ncontrol this new body&#39;s emotions.\n\nProwl doesn&#39;t flinch as the little bot covers his eyes and starts \nscratching through Prowl&#39;s thick armor. Two plates slide down to \ncover Prowl&#39;s optics. The bot&#39;s attempts were futile, as Prowl was \nneither blinded nor hurt. He could see, or rather sense, through his \nwing orbs. His wing guns remain aimed at Snow Tech&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;And tell the furball to lay off. I can see perfectly whether he&#39;s \ncovering my eyes or not.&quot;\n\n-Do you want to clear this up or should I take him out?&quot; Prowl thinks \nto Iron Raptor.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Alten Gould&quot; &lt;beastwarsaddress@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Shadow Cat whirls around to face the laughing Aerotaur. She \nwasn&#39;t used to \n&gt; being caught by suprise, usually she can sence the emotions of \nothers before \n&gt; they have reached her or Snow Tech. she unconciously rasied her arm \nto \n&gt; protect herself, sheil extending from it&#39;s energy form.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; What the Inferno.... Who are you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She keeps her shield raised and places her hand next to her \nlightning \n&gt; blaster for a quick retrival if he was an enemy. Mabey her \ninternals where \n&gt; busted up, she needed to find out why she could not sence his \narrival.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *Snow Tech glances at the barrel of Prowls gun, a half smirk on his \nface. He \n&gt; turns his head to IR and speaks out of the side of his mouth so \nonly she \n&gt; could hear*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; My, your tastes have changed since last we talked, now you go for \n&gt; over-protective and ugly? Jeeze, i thought i taught you better than \nthat!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He looks back at Prowl, knowing that if he said anything wrong, \nthis new \n&gt; bot would kill him, and probally blow of Ir&#39;s arm. And Snow Tech \nwas too \n&gt; good of a friend to let that happen. He touched Iron Raptors \nshoulder and \n&gt; spoke gentley and firmly to him,*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Iron and I are good friends, if you must know, and I was just \njocking, you \n&gt; moron, if you hadn&#39;t noticed. And, if you do not lower that gun \nfrom my \n&gt; face, we will not get along. Plus, if you shoot me, you have a \nchance of \n&gt; hitting Iron. And then i don&#39;t think she will love you much then, \nnow will \n&gt; she?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Tech had taken his hand from Iron Raptors shoulder and \nplaced it on \n&gt; his Ice-beam shooter, magnetically un snapping it from it&#39;s \nfastening and \n&gt; placing it into his hands, just in case this bot was a nut case and \nwould \n&gt; shoot him. He also put his energy sheild on hold so in a nano, it \nwould \n&gt; activate and save him and Iron from major damage.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So, just chill dude,&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * He placed his arm with his sheild on it in front of Iron Raptor, \nhis first \n&gt; concern. Snow Tech did not know what new weapons Iron had now, but \nhe wasn&#39;t \n&gt; taking any chances.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And put DOWN your weapon!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Snow Techs last request sounded with athourity, rarely heard \nthrough his \n&gt; juviniell lips, but when sounded, he made shure they new he ment \nbuissness.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * The little &#39;un was watching all this from the top of Prowls head. \n&gt; Confused, he watched the bot he had choosen to inspect aim a weapon \nat his \n&gt; friends who had saved him from harm a while back. His hackeles \nbegan to \n&gt; raise and his claws dug into the bots head. Before Snow tech could \nsay no, \n&gt; he placed himself on top of Prowls eyes, effectivally blinding him, \nand \n&gt; began to attak with little sharp claws, prowls top lip.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Mew, Fhtttt!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
