Until then, happy posting!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria, not recieving a reply from IR, assumed the situation had \nbecome \n&gt; rather extreme. She reinforced the shields with what little extra \npower \n&gt; remained and turned to run down the hall just as the ship shook \nfrom the \n&gt; force of The Brotherhood&#39;s combined attacks:\n&gt; \n&gt; CF comp: Shields at 85% and holding\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria stopped midway down the hall and opened a compartment \nneatly \n&gt; concealed behind a large panel. She grabbed a box of equipment and \ntook off \n&gt; down the CF. The pitiful mew of something caught her attention. SHe \nknew she \n&gt; didn&#39;t have the time to stop, but looked up anyway. It was the \nkitten IR had \n&gt; been carrying earlier. Hysteria sighed, then shouted up to it:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon cat. I&#39;ll take you to IR.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hysteria cast it one last glance over her shoulder and then \ncontinued down \n&gt; the hall. It was up to the cat whether or not it followed. She \neventually \n&gt; made her way up several levels until she came to a ladder. She \nclimbed up, \n&gt; and hoisted the large case over her head as she simultaneuosly \npushed open \n&gt; the hatch leading to the top of the CF and climbed out.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
