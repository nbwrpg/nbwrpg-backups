Just alert me and I\nwill ajust as I can.\n\nBIC:\n\nThe skies above Atlantis are positively littered with sweeps, like some\nhorrid mechanical insect plague, lasers and cannon fire almost buzzing\nas they rip into the grounds below. As the new defenders arrive on the\nscene the sweeps are only too happy to turn their firepower on the\napproaching ships, even as the sweeps are tagged by shooters and cut\ndown by artillery fire. \n\nTowards the Maximal base: \n\n     Scourge watches the Maximal (Ravenchief) rocket out of the line of\nfire unscathed yet again. He frowns, or he would if he had a true mouth\nin this form. Suddenly his attention is taken by a form (Remus) that\nstreaks through the skies, flying through clouds of sweeps somehow\nunmolested. �Hrm. We can�t be having that, now can we?� he muses to\nhimself. With a violent thrust of power he and the sweeps with him move\nin pursuit!\n\nMeanwhile around the Maximal Base:\n\n     The two remaining sweeps are still at the maximal targeting the\nshield, struggling to fulfill the last orders given them. Six charred\nscorch marks on the ground and fragments of sweeps are mute testimony\nto the defending skill of Guardia and the turrets. The sweeps are\nnearly startled for a second as the frame of Ravenchief comes barreling\nover the shield. They had been so busy plugging away at the shield, and\nstaying at the far side or out of the firing arc of the base defenders\nthat they had almost missed him. However they turn eager cannons on him\nand open fire, happy at last to have something to fire upon instead of\na force field!\n\n\nWith the arriving defenders:\n\nJotunn�s attacks are effective, although gatling gun takes a few hits\non each one to penetrate their armor he is able to take down a few.\nElder is also effective in raking damaging hits on the sweeps and a few\nof them also fall to the ground in explosive fireballs of destruction.\nEven as they do this more sweeps are moving in to attack, lasers\nburning through the air!\n\nGrimlock attempts to ride a few sweeps to the ground and discovers that\nsweeps do not make for willing surfboards. With an agile twist they\ndump him, allowing him to plummet towards the unyielding ground! With\nan amazing agility the sweeps turn and sweep back on their would be\nrider opening up with disintegration cannons!\n\nOn the ground:\n\nPeresus�s reprieve continues for the moment as the sweeps pull back,\ndistracted by the arrival of the defenders! However a figure runs out\nof the darkness and runs towards the group of militia, �Wait! Wait!� it\nyells, its voice definitely male. As he comes nearer the intermittent\nlight from laser fire shows him to be militia and heavily damaged. A\nhand is gone part of his faceplate and his armor is burnt. He appears\nto be coming from the far side of the city, from the area of the first\nsweep attack. �They are taking them! You have to ... *Cough* � help ��\nHe stumbles �. �You have to stop them ��\n \n\nAt the water front:\n\nAbove Cyclonus sweeps continue to pour over the railing like water\nmoving to assist their commander in whatever he needs. But so far they\nare just circling, waiting for the next command. \n\nBelow Cyclonus is eying Rodimus Prime his hands held out in front of\nhim. It is then that a spray of bullets slams into him, causing him to\nspin. But dancer smooth he quickly comes to a stop, quickly reorienting\non Rodimus below and the new attacker who has so foolishly positioned\nhimself in front of him. Cyclonus was about to respond when proximity\nalarms went off as four missiles approached at great speed! Cyclonus\nalmost smiled.\n\nIf anyone thought Scourge was fast it is here that Cyclonus put him to\nshame. Cyclonus, whether in jet mode or robot was made for the air �\n\nLike a skater he swung behind Remus as the missiles approached only at\nthe last moment jetting to the side allowing him to take the brunt of\nat least one of them. Quickly Cyclonus shot towards the cliff face\nbehind him and then to the side and up as another missile, not agile\nenough to make the turn impacted it and exploded! The last two rose up\ntowards Cyclonus as he turned to face them. As they climbed the last\nfew meters to his position, Cyclonus opened up with a terrific burst of\npower from his dual pulse cannons, converting the housing of both\nmissiles from armored metal into oxygen and simultaneously releasing\ntheir power into the air! \n\nFor a moment Cyclonus is surrounded by a terrific nimbus of energy as\nsmoke and fire occupy the position that he once flew �\n\n     � and then quite suddenly it does not!\n\nCyclonus floats regally with both hands extended, fingers opened and\nspread, the palms filled with what would appear to be black holes that\nseem to leech the damage of the explosion, filling his systems with it.\n\n\nThere is a pause as Cyclonus dropped his hands to his sides as his\nbleed-back receptors close and he seemed to almost breath the new\nenergy in.  \n\nAbove them and around the city the sweeps as a whole rise into the air\nand swirl through the air, looking like a massive storm in the skies.\nThey swing and loop and yet for the moment not firing unless fired\nupon. \n\nCyclonus looked down at Rodimus Prime, his optics also now filled with\nsome strange new light as he floated in the air. �AGREED!�\n\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
