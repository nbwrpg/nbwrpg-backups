He picks up a small holograpic projector and looks \nsadly at it.  He sits down and begins to meditate.  He turns on the \nprojector. A picture of a girl bot comes up. The projector starts \nplaying a recording of a woman singing the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; theme:\n\n\n                I don&#39;t know\n                what words I can say.\n                The wind has a way\n                to talk to me.\n                Flowers sleep\n                a silent lullaby.\n                I pray for reply.\n                I&#39;m reeeeaaaaady.\n                (I forget how the next verse goes and that&#39;s actually \na traslated version they sing twice in the series not the one they \nsing at the end of each episode in Japanese).\n\n\n\n During this Rhesus has flashbacks (hey I needed to introduce some \nconflict).  A small out post with the girl, Mustex, Stallex is born, \nthey constantly try with there few resorces to figure out why Stallex \nhas to constantly upgrade like organics to adulthood over the last 10 \nmonths (I just dicided to say he ages 12 times faster than human kids \nalthough it will stop after 20 months and return to normal), then an \nattack, fighters are everywhere, they four of them are running to the \nshuttle, 20 ft. away she&#39;s grabbed from behind, she&#39;s held around the \nneck by a large shadowy bot he can&#39;t quite make out, she screams at \nhim to go, he screams he won&#39;t but pushed the button to close the door \nanyway like a coward, and the shuttle takes off.\n\nHe stands up crying. He stops still looking sad.  He gets his tools \nand gets back to work on the cannons.\n\n\n"}}
