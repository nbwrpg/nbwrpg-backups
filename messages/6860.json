This history lesson was a bit interesting,  \nbut boring and time comsuming.  She wanted to get to the point \nfaster.  Her patients was just wearing thin.  And how, she wondered, \ndoes one get a ship off the grouhnd without engines?\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;The council considers Predicons as expendable tools. Tripredicus \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have the sense of fellowship and morality you Maximals \nhave. \n&gt; If they want something to happen losses are irrelevant. Especially \n&gt; losses that won&#39;t exist after the missions completed. Megatron, \nHell \n&gt; Beast, Tarantulis, Galvatron, thier all Predacon leaders with the \n&gt; desure to overthrow the council and take control themselves. they \n&gt; were given these types of assignments to remove them from \nopposition, \n&gt; permanently.&quot; so if they want us deleted then theres noyhing we can \n&gt; do but succeed or die.&quot; The spider can speak of his own kind that \nway \n&gt; because he sees the same aspects in himself. He didn&#39;t care about \nhow \n&gt; many Maximals or Predicons lost thier sparks, as long as he \nsurvived \n&gt; is what mattered.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;These are the files I&#39;ve obtained on the Predicon ship, I also \nknow \n&gt; through reliable sources that Magmatron&#39;s out to either capture it \n&gt; for himself or destroy it.&quot; Phobia sets files on the table between \n&gt; the others. &quot;The Cybertronian Fire may have the firepower to turn \nthe \n&gt; tide of battle. Besides, a ship of this magnifficence should be in \n&gt; space, not stuck on this primitive planet.&quot; Phobia knew what \nquestion \n&gt; would come next, he just wanted to hear Kluster ask.\n&gt; (If you don&#39;t know the question it&#39;s how can we get this ship off \nthe \n&gt; ground without engines?)\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
