He could also hear snapping, \nsomething that sounded like fire. Something inside his head screamed: fire!\n\nHe forced himself to jerk his head out of the drifting, in order to save his \nlife. He knew it was near-by. He shifted his body to the side and \ntransformed to his robot mode.  He could see embers at the hole where he \nentered the dead tree. He crashed his good leg against the inside of the \ntree and broke through. He hit it a few more times. He slipped out of the \nnew hole, watching where he put him busted leg. There was a fire!\n\n&quot;Slag!&quot; he cried out. In the distance, he was Jackel and Pheniox escaping \nthe firey scene. He was mad. Why couldn&#39;t they leave him alone?\n\nHe stood up and limped on one leg, away from the flames. He fell twice, \nlanding hard on his leg. He cursed each time, mad that he had these wounds \nto handicap him.\n\nHe transformed back to his beast mode and skittered fast away from the \nflames.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
