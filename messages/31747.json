Like a large\nfootball, he\n&gt; spirals toward the ground, leaving a large crater. He pulls himself\nout,\n&gt; one of his horns was cracked, but he didnt care, he was kicked in\nthe head,\n&gt; the strongest place in his body, and now he was M...A....D. He spat\noil on\n&gt; the ground, rubbed his hoof against it, and set out in another\ncharge\n&gt; towards Lavatron.\n\n\n"}}
