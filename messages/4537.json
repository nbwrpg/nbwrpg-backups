He turns around, heading for the next room.\n\nThe door opens as he aproaches, revealing a protoform laying on a table. The \nprotoform was massive, looking like a living weapon, except for it wasn&#39;t \nliving. Not yet, anyways. Zardus enters the room, carrying the box with the \nspark with him.\n\nHe aproaches the table, looking at a computer screen to make sure the \nprotoform was ready. It was. All the fail-safe systems were in place. The bot \nwould not revolt.\n\nIt had been a project from the early days of the Alliance, a project which \nhas been delayed quite a long time. Zardus opens the box, taking the spark \ncarefully into his hand, and lowering it toward the protoform. He releases \nthe spark as it sinks into the protoform&#39;s chest, the chest plate closing \nover it. Zardus flips a switch on a comp panel, activating the new protoform.\n\nHe grins evilly and takes a step back as the protoform&#39;s optics light up.\n\n&quot;Arise .... Delta!&quot;\n\n"}}
