A heart can still talk to a heart and get through, it&#39;s the one thin=\r\ng that separates us from our enemies.&quot;\n\nHe rolls in as Rat Trap nodds to Lo=\r\nrd Elders&#39; statement and then looks to Cheetor.\n\n&quot; Oh? And I suppose you kn=\r\now about this computer pussycat?  Oh well, if ya ask me this thing&#39;s due fo=\r\nr some major upgrades.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks back at Cheetor.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s gotchya =\r\nthere kiddo.  He&#39;s right, this stuff goes back vorns ago, it could do with =\r\na sizeable upgrade.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Airhammer.\n\n&quot;Gotchya, no hard feeln&#39;=\r\ns, we&#39;ll talk later!&quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts.\n\n&quot; Patience isn&#39;t one of Noctorr=\r\no&#39;s strong points is it?&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Got that right, and that co=\r\nuld hurt &#39;em sooner or later.  Now, about Rodimus..  Looks like Tucson can&#39;=\r\nt get through ta his radio &#39;cause it&#39;s off line. &quot;\n\nRat Trap anaylizes the =\r\ntendrils.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s gotta have somethn&#39; ta do with those tendrils.  But if we =\r\nrip &#39;em off, we&#39;ll do more harm than good.  Truth is we have no idea what w=\r\ne&#39;re dealn&#39; with and I don&#39;t wanna make things worse.&quot;\n\n&quot; Hmmm, maybe a lit=\r\ntle encouragement from familliar comrades will sort of get &#39;em gon&#39;under th=\r\nere. Night Shift, as far as ya know, Wheels worked really close ta Rodimus =\r\nright?&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;Sure did.  Although, they had their disagreem=\r\nents now&#39;n then.  Rodimus ben&#39; a hot rod, and Tucson ben&#39; an off roader, wh=\r\no always put saftey before speed, and Rodimus with his habit of speedn&#39; on =\r\nthe roadways...  Oh yeah, that kinda did annoy Tucson a little bit, but oth=\r\ner than that, they&#39;re close.&quot;\n\nRat Trap listens.\n\n&quot;Okay then, maybe if Whee=\r\nls was here, talkn&#39; ta him, that might spark somethn&#39; without him havn&#39; ta =\r\ngive up his spark ta save &#39;em. Wait here, I&#39;m gonna go get Wheels.&quot;\n\nAs he =\r\ndarts out to find Tucson Prime, he nearly bumps into Lord Elder, but catche=\r\ns himself, as he approaches Tucson Prime.\n\n&quot;Tucson Prime, sir, your radio i=\r\nsn&#39;t gettn&#39; through ta Rodimus, and truth is we dunno what will.  Our guess=\r\n is that if you could stay in the room with us  and start conversn&#39; with &#39;e=\r\nm, that might just spark somethn&#39; in &#39;em ta try&#39;n come back online and figh=\r\nt off whatever hold those tendrills got on &#39;em.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes=\r\n, Perceptor just told me.  Lord Elder, I&#39;ll be in the CR chamber room, look=\r\ning after Rodimus with Night Shift and Rat Trap.  I strongly believe that P=\r\nerceptor and Rat Trap&#39;s idea will hopefully get something going.&quot;\n\nHe drive=\r\ns Talon in with him as well as Perceptor, as he comes to a halt in the very=\r\n room where Rodimus is lying in a coccoon of Tendrils.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, I&#39;m here,=\r\n and I have a message for you.  Nightlight and Elita desperately need you, =\r\nand truthfully so do I.  We are strength in numbers, and without you that s=\r\ntrength can not hold. You are sadly missed my friend, and I will not have y=\r\nou be missed for long.  Do you hear me?  You&#39;ve faced worse, you can overco=\r\nme this, I know you can.&quot;\n\n  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carro=\r\nll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap taps feverishly on the=\r\n computer to try and get it to desist firing on Perceptor, at the same time=\r\n he was happy to know that Lord Elder had said something to Tucson Prime.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;UGHH! C&#39;mon computer, if I say somethn&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay! It ain&#39;t =\r\nlike I&#39;m gonna bug ya with a virus! Perceptor&#39;s a pred but he&#39;s changn&#39; sid=\r\nes! Stupid piece of outdated hardware! Well, at least Lord Elder said somet=\r\nhn&#39; ta Wheels, I don&#39;t wanna ever hear him try&#39;n ta put his spark on the li=\r\nne ever again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; The computer readily responds to Rat Trap&#39;s wi=\r\nshes and shuts down its\n&gt; attack sequence. The shield&#39;s drop and the weapon=\r\ns go back to stand-by\n&gt; condition. However on Rat Trap&#39;s console the comput=\r\ner continues to\n&gt; register the fact that there is a Predacon signature in t=\r\nhe area\n&gt; although all other alarms shut down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord elder looked aroun=\r\nd the command center, his stance calm and\n&gt; relaxed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; he said=\r\n consolingly to Rat Trap, &quot;We have lost\n&gt; too many already, I am not lookin=\r\ng to loose Tuscon so quickly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor came up and stood next to Rat T=\r\nrap smacking him on the back in\n&gt; a friendly gesture, &quot;You think you got th=\r\ne computer under control\n&gt; now?&quot; he said teasing the smaller Maximal as he =\r\nsmiled, &quot;You look like\n&gt; you couldn&#39;t handle it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrid=\r\ne and Night Shift try to deal with Noctorro, but his prodding was getting o=\r\nn the Autobot&#39;s nerves more than anything else.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Look, we&#39;re don&#39; t=\r\nhe best we can, and we really don&#39;t know what we&#39;re dealn&#39; with here, this =\r\nis completely alien ta all of us and you&#39;re gonna have ta show some patienc=\r\ne.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride snorts and looks over to Noctorro.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, =\r\ngive us some breathing room will ya?! Geeze!.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Noctorro loo=\r\nked like he was about to go off for a moment, his optics\n&gt; looking a defini=\r\nte crimson as he locked gazes with Quickstride.\n&gt; However Airhammer stepped=\r\n in the middle of them and looked back at\n&gt; Noctorro, &quot;Maybe we can go find=\r\n out. It&#39;s obvious they have much work\n&gt; to do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Noctorro nodded and l=\r\naughed as he rubbed the back of his head with a\n&gt; nervous almost embarrased=\r\n gesture, &quot;Sure.&quot; he said looking definitly\n&gt; sheepish. &quot;You&#39;re right, let&#39;=\r\ns go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Airhammer looked at Quickstride and Nightshift, &quot;He get&#39;s that=\r\n way\n&gt; sometimes, but he means well.&quot; he said quietly as they turned to lea=\r\nve\n&gt; the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside, Tucson Prime acknolwedges the readin=\r\ness to come aboard.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Tucson Prime to Lord Elder, I&#39;m commin=\r\ng back to the Ark as you requested. And let&#39;s see what the medics can do, i=\r\nf they need my help I&#39;m here to give to them. Perceptor, Talon, don&#39;t worry=\r\n, you will not be losing me any time soon, I assure you. I wonder if I can =\r\nget a link up with Rodimus remotely. As an Autobot we should be able to com=\r\n link with each other.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He attempts to connect with Rodimus&#39;s com l=\r\nink, hoping to get through to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder responds from the command cen=\r\nter, &quot;I will pass that on to them.\n&gt; I am sure they are working as hard as =\r\nthey can.&quot; Elder said, trying\n&gt; keep the peace, and yet trying to keep Tusc=\r\non from jumping headlong\n&gt; into sacrificing himself again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuscon atte=\r\nmpts to connect with Rodimus but get&#39;s no response. It is\n&gt; as if his radio=\r\n is offline or not responding. Perhaps it has something\n&gt; to do with the fa=\r\nct that Rodimus is completely wrapped in the strange\n&gt; alien metal tendrils=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
