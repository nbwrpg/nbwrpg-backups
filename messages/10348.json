But I\n&gt; would like to look back on the &#39;old days&#39;.  Whenever someone new comes,\nthey\n&gt; have a bumpy start.  I&#39;ll you that even the council has had days when they\n&gt; made bad plots or moded.  No offense to everyone here of course.  I say we\n&gt; all tell what happened on our very first post so we can laugh at eachother\n&gt; and ourselves.  How about it?  I&#39;ll start:\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Torca burst into the room and pointed his dorsal gun at Quickstrike,\ntrying\n&gt; to extinguish his spark::\n&gt;\n&gt; :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
