It was no concern to Reptilica whether\nPsuedo\n&gt; would be hit or not, because Psuedo wasn&#39;t an Alliance bot, but if Deemos\n&gt; blocked with Psuedo, he&#39;d be caught in the blast also.\n&gt;\n&gt; Having fired the two missiles, Reptilica flies back up, seeing the\nPredacons\n&gt; retreating. He opens his comm-link. &quot;Hey, Preds,&quot; he says into it, sending\nit\n&gt; on a Predacon frequency, &quot;What are you doing?
