I landed here not too long ago.  I can&#39;t \nremember anything before that.  I landed next to a transformer who seemed \nevil so I killed him (Typo Demon).  I sent out a general message and \nMagmatron summoned me to the Sulaco.  There I was reprogrammed into a \nDestron.  I don&#39;t remember what I was before, nor do I care.  My loyalty is \nto the Destron cause now.&quot;\n\n"}}
