WHAT IS MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT SIR!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos nodded at Sunhawks report. &quot;Get some rest\n&gt; Sunhawk, you too Condor.\n&gt; You&#39;ve both done enough for today. Report to the\n&gt; mess hall and relax, both\n&gt; of you.&quot; Turning back to the console the maximal\n&gt; commander sifted through\n&gt; the reports, reading the somewhat grim reports of\n&gt; exactly what kind of shape\n&gt; the ship was in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tomorrow he&#39;d have to figure out exactly what to do\n&gt; further, the east and\n&gt; western sensor arrays would have to be setup of\n&gt; course, the north and south\n&gt; provided an extra range for their scanning\n&gt; equipment. They&#39;d also have to\n&gt; setup energon collectors, the mess hall supplies\n&gt; while in no real danger yet\n&gt; would need restocking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going through the list he moved scouting and patrols\n&gt; towards the top, most\n&gt; likely jobs for the two fliers that have proven\n&gt; their value so well the\n&gt; first day, probably send Grimlock out with them, the\n&gt; dinobot could benefit\n&gt; from a bit of Sunhawks military training...he\n&gt; doubted the two would mix any\n&gt; better than paint and oil but it would be worth a\n&gt; gamble.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking through the list of available maximals and\n&gt; autobots he sat back\n&gt; planning the duty roster for tomorrow...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
