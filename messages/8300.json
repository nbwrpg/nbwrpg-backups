Thank you for your help. It seems \nthought \n&gt; that my spark will have to go out. Let&#39;s just pray to The Matrix \nthat \n&gt; a pod has crashed unknowingly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois sat down in the discussion room along with his friends. He \n&gt; began to tell them his tale.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;After Terminess and I blew ourselves up, I expected to awaken \ninside \n&gt; The Matrix, not infront of it. It started speaking to me, saying \nthat \n&gt; it wanted me to bring Organic life to Cybertron. It said I would \n&gt; return to Past Earth and attempt to unify those bots in bringing \nback \n&gt; Organic life so that all bots could an organic form. With the \nsharing \n&gt; of this, it would bring everyone closer to peace. I was suppost to \n&gt; bring three chosen ones to aide me:Cybershark, Soundwave and \nBattera. \n&gt; The Matrix also explained that it was the reason I came to the Neo \n&gt; Beast Wars in the first place, so that I could see how terrible \n&gt; Predacon life was. So it returned me to Past Earth, where I have \n&gt; spent the last two weeks hiding, building this place. Scraps of \npods, \n&gt; ships and other materials. Since everyone thought I was dead, no \none \n&gt; bothered to try and notice this area. So, now you know my story, \nand \n&gt; the mission we are all entrusted with. Now, The Matrix warned that \nwe \n&gt; may not succeed; some might even get mad at our attempts of peace \nand \n&gt; may try to attack us. It also warned me that you may not want to \n&gt; join, especially you Cybershark, who is such a warrior. So I ask \nyou \n&gt; now before we take the first step. This is your only chance to \nleave. \n&gt; Do you want to join me, or go back on your way?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
