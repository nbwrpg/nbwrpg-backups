They needed more information on \n&gt; the insectoids before they could actually do anything about them. He had \n&gt; learned that first hand himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I agree Rodimus, they will not know what hit them, but in order to create \n&gt; such an impact, we must know more about the insectoids we encountered.  I \n&gt; too got that impression, when we were dealing with them.  They seemed \n&gt; extremely wise as heartless as they were.  Perhaps a recon mission is in \n&gt; order..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then continues to give the spark to Stanton.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I see Stanton, you know best but if this can help Nightlight physically, \n&gt; please give it to her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap raises his paw with a serious look on his rodent face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll do it Sir, I&#39;ll do the recon mission.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift raises his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ditto.  You want Intel, I&#39;m will&#39;n ta help.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot raises her hand as does Quickstride who replies for them \n&gt; both.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, looks like we&#39;re in too.  You&#39;ll need backup guys, and we&#39;re just \n&gt; as good as anyone for that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s very brave of you to offer.  Rodimus, and I can guide you through \n&gt; the tunnels, and as soon as you learn anything, report back to the Ark as \n&gt; soon as possible and do not try to form an attack on your own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They all reply.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head back to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can not see, and you can.  Can you remember the geological layout of \n&gt; those tunnels?  Rat Trap and the others will need those for recon \n&gt; purposes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson first holds Rodimus&#39;s hand gently with a smile on his face. He \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was happy to see his comrade back on the mend. And now he was never \n&gt;&gt; &gt; going to allow anything else to happen to him. He takes his words into \n&gt;&gt; &gt; consideration with a nodd of compliance.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Understood Rodimus. I will not underestimate Cyclonus by any means, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; but I will do my best to be sure that neither he or Hydras lays another \n&gt;&gt; &gt; harmful hand on any of the Maximals or Autobots ever again. And this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; time, I&#39;m very happy to have the help. I&#39;ll need it, I may be a Prime, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; but I know even the best of warriors can do with having good comrades \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on his side. Legacy, I will be grateful for anything you can do to help \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor. And if Perceptor is comfortable with the extensive repairs, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; by all means, do try, but if it doesn&#39;t work, I will also understand. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; When I was last examined, I was also told that my damage may be far too \n&gt;&gt; &gt; extensive to repair by normal means.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon nodding, &quot;There are two Primes now, those\n&gt;&gt; Predacons will never know what hit them.&quot; His words were firm and no\n&gt;&gt; nonsense. &quot;But we need more information on those insects before we go\n&gt;&gt; attacking them.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus got a thoughtful expression on his face, &quot;I seem to have the\n&gt;&gt; impression that the insects were old. While I was connected to them, I\n&gt;&gt; could feel that they are a race that is nearly as old as the\n&gt;&gt; transformers, but thier form was not always an insect type. I think\n&gt;&gt; they are adapting to us in a way.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He then turns to Stanton.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Stanton, I have something for Nightlight. I hope it will be enough to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; restore her.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He opens his chest and reveals his pulsating orb, which pulsates twice \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and forms a smaller version of itself. The small orb of energy pulsates \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in time with his own. He presents it to Stanton.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; This is what helped me to bring Rodimus back. It&#39;s a power that feeds \n&gt;&gt; &gt; off of compassion, hope, understanding, and kindness. The power of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; unity, and a simple force that we all possess to a level of degree. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s what drew Rat Trap to find me, and what drew me to Talon and all \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of you. And now, I wish to extend this to Nightlight, in hopes that the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; compassion we all share, will be enough to help her through this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult time.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot smiles as her own heart spark beats within her chest.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Love is definitely something our enemy doesn&#39;t have. And there&#39;s no \n&gt;&gt; &gt; other force greater than that.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon shook his head as he smiled at Tuscon, &quot;Thank you.&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; gravely, &quot;But that will not help here. Her problem is in her spark.\n&gt;&gt; That has the power to heal her physically, but not to restore her lost\n&gt;&gt; memories.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bump nodded agreeing with Santon, &quot;Proceedures involving a being&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; spark are always delicate and even dangerous.&quot; He glanced at\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor, his optics clearly mistrustful and yet hopeful at the same\n&gt;&gt; time, &quot;Maybe this is a way Perceptor can prove that he wants to be a\n&gt;&gt; Maximal. Help us undo what he has done.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor sighted, he hoped tht he was able to see again so he decided \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; take the risk&quot;I&#39;ll undergo that scan&quot;said the male&quot;Let see if I&#39;ll be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; able\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to see again&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight was in deep stasis but her face revealed the sadness and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; sufering\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of her painful experience. Altough she had recovered a little under the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; care\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of Perceptor and Rodimus, still she looked tin and fragile and her \n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrist and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ankles showed the marks of her restrain inside the pod where she had \n&gt;&gt; &gt; been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; most time of her captivity\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy had been standing with Bump looking over Nightlight, &quot;I concur\n&gt;&gt; with my collegues.&quot; he said, his voice as always cold and clear,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Clearly we have the greatest chance of success of repairing\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight with perceptor&#39;s help. After we have done this, then we can\n&gt;&gt; look into the efficacy of repairing Perceptor.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
