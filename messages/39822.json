A small noise diverted his attention to be facing Spinister.  &quot;Spinister, good to see you again.  I want you to oversee operations outside and the construction.&quot;\n\nAll of a sudden Scrapper flew backwards over his chair.  Immediatly standing, he looked at the screen into Megatrons face.  &quot;Lord Megatron. I - I mean Megatron.  My lord Havotron wishes a word---&quot; and with that Havotron threw Scrapper to the side. \n\n&quot;Well well well....Megatron.   My name is Havotron, and I have been sent to sieze command of the DEcepticons here on Earth so we can complete ultimate domination.  You are to surrender your forces and your leadership to me...or else.&quot;\n\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Okay, okay, I guess i&#39;ve dragged it out long enough. I like the\n&gt; idea for the base though, sounds cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Apeface stood perfectly still on the tree, looking around, taking in\n&gt; this alien planet. He looked up and saw two birds peacefully fly by.\n&gt; &quot;YUCK.&quot; Apeface said, more brutish than normal. &quot;This planet more gross\n&gt; than me remember.&quot; he finished, as his surroundings began to change. The\n&gt; tree easily gave way to Tremor&#39;s huge form, and began to topple. Apeface\n&gt; meerly crouched down, his hinges making a loud noise, and then used his\n&gt; powerful legs, to spring to another tree, as he held on with both feet\n&gt; and a hand, he looked down. &quot;Watch it.&quot; He hollard, as he let himself\n&gt; slide down the tree. He landed on the ground, beside Tremor. Spasma\n&gt; opened up a line to the D.E.D ship. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spasma to Scrapper, Spasma to Scrapper.&quot; he began, but got frustrated.\n&gt; &quot;Our commlinks are being jammed, by some type of energon, only the ships\n&gt; is powerful enough to travel these long distances.&quot; he finished, looking\n&gt; down to Apeface. Apeface looked annoyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fine.&quot; He blurted. &quot;We head back to base, you keep searching.&quot; he told\n&gt; Tremor, as he leapt off of the ground, and transformed. Spasma leapt\n&gt; off, long enough to land in the cockpit. The ships engines then roared\n&gt; to life, as he headed back towards MT. Fuji.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightmare finished his salute to Havotron, then walked towards the\n&gt; chamber, and opened it up. Nothing. For the first time, Nightmare showed\n&gt; emotion, he was confused. &quot;Computer, what happened to unit Spinister?&quot;\n&gt; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind Havotron, however, a low exchange of oxygen, could be heard.\n&gt; &quot;Spinister, reporting.&quot; the voice whispered, almost to quietly for\n&gt; Havotron to hear.\n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
