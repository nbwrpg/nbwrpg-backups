When have I ever said\n&gt; that I wanted to dip Iron Raptor into a vat of acid and have Serpentor eat\n&gt; IRIS piece by piece?  Besides, Yan told me you had some plans for the\nMaxis.\n&gt; Attacking the Alliance is something I want to see the Maxis pathetically\nfail\n&gt; at :P\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyberwolf, I was waiting for you to reply with your guy, and I doubt\nyou&#39;ll\n&gt; take Serpentor down.  Anyway, just because he murdered Luna&#39;s girlfriend\nis\n&gt; no reason to hold a grudge...look at Logomorph!  She&#39;s not out to rip my\n&gt; spark out!\n&gt;\n&gt; And last, but not least, Alloran, that would be awesome if the insane\n&gt; Galvatron was on the Maximal side.  Evil could finally triumph over the\ndark\n&gt; forces of the light.  Too bad Hot Rod still isn&#39;t evil.  Could have good\n&gt; Galvatron fight evil Hot Rod.\n&gt;\n&gt; Long live the Maximals?  Next thing you know you&#39;ll be saying the Maximals\n&gt; are good!  But no one will buy that Maxi/Autobot propaganda!)\n&gt;\n&gt; The Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Sixshot/Dark Wolf/Double\n&gt; Punch/Injector/Manterror/Bumblebee/Ares/Nemesis\n&gt; Enforcer/Scattershot/Serpentor/Firestarter:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Oblitertron bellowed as the missiles struck his legs, the legs almost\n&gt; buckling, but Oblitertron wasn&#39;t going to fall that easily.  He raised his\n&gt; opened left palm, firing off three fire balls at Gigan.  His optics\nglowed,\n&gt; and a single optic blast launched out at Gigan.\n&gt;\n&gt; He felt the few plasma bolts, which were merely like an annoyance to him.\nHe\n&gt; raised his rifle to point at Hysteria, and fired off two bolts that lanced\n&gt; out on the attacker.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot felt the charges hit his form, and could feel the armor starting\nto\n&gt; peel away at the extreme heat of the lasers.  He wasn&#39;t in the mood for\nthis.\n&gt;  He could stay and fight a worthless bot, or shoot a Maximal base.  There\nwas\n&gt; no contendor.\n&gt;\n&gt; He fired off two bolts from a cannon in both batteries.  Four blasts\nlanced\n&gt; out at Dinobot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ares,&quot; he said over his internal comm. unit, &quot;get over here and take care\nof\n&gt; this chump for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Wolf watched the two other Alliance gestalts, and resisted the urge\nto\n&gt; run over and tear them apart limb by limb.  The twenty-five foot gestalt\n&gt; slammed a fist against his heavily armored chest.  A blue orb of unknown\n&gt; energy formed in his left palm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Prepare to die, Maximal scum!&quot; he yelled out as he tossed the orb at the\n&gt; first bot he saw moving, Tavatron.  (Orb is basically like a grenade that\n&gt; blows on impact)\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Double Punch watched the lasers and missile hit near him.  He was getting\n&gt; upset.  It was getting an inch or so closer every time.  He&#39;d have to run\n&gt; farther away from where he opened fire on his enemies so they would fire\nat\n&gt; the place where he had just been and he&#39;d be safe.\n&gt;\n&gt; He raised both arms, firing off two energy-signature seeking missiles at\n&gt; Sideswipe.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector fired off three optic blasts, intercepting the missile, but got\nhit\n&gt; by all the blasts.  He raked backwards through the air, cursing madly.  He\n&gt; raised both arms, firing off two stinger missiles from both launchers at\n&gt; Ratchet.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror heard Injector&#39;s curses, and decided to stop attacking the CF\nand\n&gt; help them.  He looked up, firing off three ion disks from his left arm at\n&gt; Ratchet.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Bumblebee fired off a quick ten optic blasts at the incoming nails, six of\n&gt; them stabbing into his right forearm as he blocked the nails with them.\nHe\n&gt; raised his arms in pain, firing off two stinger missiles from both\nlaunchers,\n&gt; watching the four missile sheading for Torca.  At this rate, Bumblebee\nwould\n&gt; have start taking evasive maneuvers.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Ares got up slowly, shaking his head, but was able to understand Sixshot&#39;s\n&gt; message.\n&gt; &quot;Fine.&quot; he replied, looking around the battlefield.  He ducked under a\n&gt; missile from the CF, and fired off three optic blasts in return, blocked\nby\n&gt; the shields of the massive, yet damaged ship.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spotted Sixshot&#39;s armored carrier mode, and a robot firing on him.  He\n&gt; raised his laser rifle&#39;s barrel to point at Dinobot&#39;s left arm, firing off\na\n&gt; single bolt, still a little groggy from being hit with the numerous\nmissiles\n&gt; in his prior engagement.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer cursed as most of his shots missed, and the rest were\n&gt; intercepted by some idiot he&#39;d never seen before.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;YOU&#39;RE ALL AGA--&quot; he was thrown to his left from Tavatron&#39;s blast, Iron\n&gt; Raptor&#39;s powerful looking blasts going right by him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He straightened out, cursing madly like a pack of donkeys in rage.  He\n&gt; activated his comm. unit to to the inner monologue comm. unit in Zardus&#39;\n&gt; head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Nemesis Enforcer.  There are constant new factors.  Send\n&gt; reinforcements.  Situation is not critical, but we need reinforcements for\n&gt; final victory.  If possible, the War Machines.&quot; he said, raising his rifle\nas\n&gt; he waited for a reply.  &quot;You want to play?  I&#39;ll give you something to\nplay\n&gt; with, witch!&quot; he yelled, firing off twenty-five rapid laser bolts off at\nIron\n&gt; Raptor&#39;s chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot laughed at Nemesis getting hit.  He sighed, hovering in\nmid-air.\n&gt; He better help him before Nemesis got angry at him.  He raised his rifle,\nhis\n&gt; arms akimbo, firing off 15 rounds at Tavatron&#39;s legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor ran back as fast as he could, barely avoiding the enraged\nLunaprine.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the outside, he made himself look like he was panicked and fearful.\nBut,\n&gt; on the inside, he was crazy.  Besides being crazy, he was being calm, and\nhad\n&gt; already seen the folly of Lunaprine&#39;s attack.\n&gt;\n&gt; He raised his right arm, firing off a blast straight at Lunaprine&#39;s chest\n&gt; (not sure if it would be considered point blank...), and slashed forward\nat\n&gt; Lunaprine&#39;s right side with his energy blade in his left hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Firestarter&#39;s craft reached Mach 5 as he quickly sped through the\natmosphere.\n&gt; He activated the comm. unit in the ship.  &quot;Shockwave, it is Firestarter, I\n&gt; have arrived.  You have no base, I can tell from my scans.  You are\nheading\n&gt; to an ice continent.  Report as soon as you can.  Unitron is currently in\n&gt; battle with Maximals.  I will aid him and his faction.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He ended the transmission, walking over to the only access hatch in his\nship\n&gt; and opened it via an access code into a access panel near it.\n&gt;\n&gt; He leapt out of the ship, activating the boosters in his feet, heading for\n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire as he watched his Talon class fighter head for Uluru\nin\n&gt; the large island continent of Australia.  He watched the craft smash\nthrough\n&gt; the top of the large Uluru, and went deep into its center, rock collapsing\non\n&gt; top of it.  It was barely noticable there was a hole in Uluru.\n&gt;\n&gt; He launched off towards the Cybertronian Fire, knowing he would repair the\n&gt; damage to Uluru later, but was only interested in battle now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
