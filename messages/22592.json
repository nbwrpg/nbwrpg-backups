It slowly, gently \nlowered itself above Drillbit. when the bot walked out it gently \ndropped onto his back. There was only one hope to regain the trust of \nhis former group. He had to regain his body. But in order to do that \nhe had to regain the trust. He was trapped by a paradox. he had to \nbreak the loop. The only chance he had was to communicate. But not \nwhile he could be observed.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I dont want to argue over this.
