Does that sound familiar to you?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He listens intently.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Uh oh, almost sounds like the spider just caught the wasp in her web.  At\n&gt; least it sounds that way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He&#39;s in trouble, I gotta help him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap gasps.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But, but he&#39;s a pred.  That&#39;s suicide.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can&#39;t blame you for thinking that way because it does sound crazy.  But\n&gt; deep down, we are all alike in some way, even if we are on opposite sides of\n&gt; the field.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap thinks with his paw on his chin.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmm, ya know, you&#39;re right Prickles, sometimes we kinda do have ta think\n&gt; outside the box.  Okay, if you&#39;re gonna go try ta help Waspinator then count\n&gt; me in.  Only because I worry about ya, and only us little guys understand\n&gt; each other. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiles as she puts her paw on his left front haunch.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thank you Rattrap, this means a lot to me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She gives him a gentile kiss on his nose.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Aww shucks, it&#39;s noth&#39;n.  Now let&#39;s go do what rodents do best.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She gives him a thumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Right.

When we worked together, I saw a part\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of him that I never thought I would see in a Predacon . I can&#39;t explain\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what it is because even I&#39;m not so sure about it but it&#39;s definitely not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something bad.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She looks to Leo thoughtfully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I know that the Predacons are our natural enemies but, maybe some of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; them are just misunderstood. I think Waspinator is one of those who are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; even misunderstood by their own comrades. I never thought I would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; actually be speaking up for a Predacon but, this time it&#39;s different.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, I better get going and see if I can contact Waspinator.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She salutes as she saunters off to contact what could be her newest\n&gt;&gt; &gt; friend.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Waspinator, it&#39;s me, Straight Shot. I need your help and I was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wondering if you could meet me half way between the Ark and where you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stationed. Also, I was wondering if you had time ta talk. There&#39;s a few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things I&#39;d like ta tell ya and I don&#39;t want anyone ta hear me except for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She sighs.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing bad. It&#39;s something I forgot ta tell ya\n&gt;&gt; &gt; before we went our separate ways.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At this point, as she went to click on the communicator, there was a beep.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Wazzzpinator here.. Wait..&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The entire message being heard, and over at the other end Straight Shot\n&gt;&gt; would hear, &quot;What is this, consorting with the enemy? Tsk, Tsk, Tsk. I\n&gt;&gt; thought you would know better then.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then a pleading, &quot;Noo, Wazzpinator not, stupid little bow-girl..&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then there was a loud SCREAM and a series of small explosions as her\n&gt;&gt; communicator chirped off.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;Subject: Waspinator located inside auxiliary Predacon Facilities, now in\n&gt;&gt; Stasis Lock. Do you want to leave a message?&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The voice at the other end familiar, in a sense. Not to her, but probably\n&gt;&gt; more so to Rattrap.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
