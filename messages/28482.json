It \nclosed behind him and he looked around, wondering why the orb had \nordered him to go here. The lab was a standard lab for bot \nmaintanence. The room was dotted with equipment for fixing and \nimproving bots of all sizes. The impressive part was a large console \nin the front of the room, which had control of the entire lab. Zardus \nwalked to the console chair and sat down, waiting for the Vok to \nstart whatever it wanted him here for. He didn&#39;t have to wait long. \nIn several seconds, the orb flickered.\n\n&quot;Why&#39;d you bring me here?&quot; Zardus asked using his mind, glancing down \nat the blue sphere. He didn&#39;t have to wait long for the responce.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re weak. Your clone barely lived at the Cybertronian Fire, and \nhis body is stronger than yours.&quot; Was the Vok&#39;s explanation. It \ndidn&#39;t sound mad or upset; its words were merely a statement.\n\n&quot;My clone was fighting four bots, th-&quot; Zardus pointed out, but a \nspasm of pain sent by the orb caused him to fall off his seat in \npain. He climbed back onto the seat, groaning in pain and thankful \nthat the room was soundproof. He knew that the orb had already \ndisabled all monitoring devices, just like it had done on the last \ntime it had met with him. The orb made the room invisible by simply \nerasing it from the computer. According to the Iron Fist, Lab 4 \ndidn&#39;t even exist. There were no functions that could be called up \nfrom anywhere in the ship into that room; even the lights were slowly \nflickering off and dying. Zardus took several deep breaths to recover \nfrom the pain.\n\n&quot;Now, as I was saying,&quot; the orb continued, &quot;Your body needs to be \nimproved. I will supervise the improvements.&quot;\n\nZardus nodded and stood up. The orb was already placing instructions \ninside his mind, telling him to go to a machine in the back of the \nlab and lay down in the space provided. He walked passed all the \nequipment, coming up to the machine specified and laying down on a \npanel that was built to support bots. The panel slid into the machine \nand a procedure began, guided by the Vok.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ smiles, watching the reports of the huge blast of the rebels. It \nwas complete. He taps a few buttons and the gass stops, water pouring \nout from various to wash it away. Drones were already on their way to \nclean it up.\n\n&quot;Alliance bots,&quot; he says over the comm, &quot;The rebellion has been \nquelled. There is currently an attack taking place on Hell Beast&#39;s \nbase. I&#39;m encouraging you to attack, though its not too big a \npriority right now.&quot;\n\nFZ taps a few buttons, taking the Alliance base off lockdown.\n\n\n"}}
