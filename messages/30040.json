She went to the corner  to put some stuff away, when she found an \nold, dusty DNA replicator regenerator.  She wiped the dust off and read the \nname from the small digital read out panel.  Her eyes grew wide a she saw \nthe name.  &quot;It can&#39;t be so. I thought they would have gotten rid of her by \nnow. But here she is.&quot;  She pressed a few buttons and started up the \nmachine.  The statis on the bot inside as complete and the bot was \nfunctional.  She smiled and ran a check on it&#39;s programs. They were just as \nthey had been.  She opened her link to the commander. &quot;UH, excuse me Sir. \nBut I have something that might be of interest to you. Uh, when you have a \nmoment commander, I&#39;d like to speak to you.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
