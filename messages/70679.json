But I&#39;m sure the others \n&gt; would be interested in hearing your story.  Why don&#39;t you tell them, and \n&gt; then catch up to us at a later time perhaps?  Right now, I am tired, and I \n&gt; do need rest.  So does Rodimus.  You may use the room where Optimus Prime \n&gt; rests, if you wish.  Just be sure to leave things as they are.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He says with a gentile voice.  Before becomming a Prime, he had been known \n&gt; as gruff autobot, always willing to take chances.  But now, his \n&gt; experiences begin to change him, not only on the outside but on the inside \n&gt; as well.  He had learned a lot in his experience while fighting beside \n&gt; Vestige in his subconcious state, and how important team work was, and how \n&gt; valuable the help of others truely is.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh, before you go, Thank you, thank you for standing by us during our \n&gt; ordeal.  It means a lot to us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson smiles and puts a hand on Rodimus&#39;s shoulder.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;A favor I would not mind doing for you again, Rodimus. You&#39;re worth \n&gt;&gt; &gt; more to me than any precious metal or power source. And, Torca&#39;s right, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I - could use a rest, but, perhaps I will get that when I undergo the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; repairs to my optic sensors. Stanton, I need to ask you a favor. One \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that I know is extremely difficult to accomplish, and one that I&#39;d \n&gt;&gt; &gt; never ask of you unless it was a dire need. I would like you to attempt \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the delicate process of bringing my optic sensors back online. If it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work, I understand. But I saw how important it was for me to be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; able to see in order to get an idea of the situation at hand and how to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; remedy it. A blind eye can only go so far. And if at all possible, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; could the same be done for Perceptor? He too, deserves a second chance \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of seeing things in a whole new light.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon nodded, a smile on his face, &quot;I had assumed that you would need\n&gt;&gt; that sooner or later.&quot; He walked over to Tuscon holding a sensors a\n&gt;&gt; few inches from the side of his heard, apparently taking reading, &quot;The\n&gt;&gt; scanners should have a pretty good work up on you, but once we get\n&gt;&gt; this room ready I believe we can get your optics wokring again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bump had walked over to Rodimus and began running a scanner over him\n&gt;&gt; as well. &quot;Both of you are to get rest before you go galavanting across\n&gt;&gt; this planet again. You have both been through a lot.&quot; Bump looked at\n&gt;&gt; both of them meaningfuly, it was apparent he was not going to let them\n&gt;&gt; leave the base withou some recharging and true down time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Then my tale has to wait&quot;said dryly Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Torca had been watching Tuscon and Rodimus with a critical optic as if\n&gt;&gt; weighing out how much they could handle, but he glanced over at\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor, &quot;No, it does not.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He looked back at Tuscon and then Rodimus, &quot;There are so many tales.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; he said. &quot;We all have much to discuss.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes, yes!&quot; Bump said as he glanced up from his scanner reading of\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus, &quot;But not in the medical chamber.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Torca smiled indulgantly at Bump, &quot;Quite right.&quot; He looked over at\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon and Rodimus, &quot;Shall we take this to another room?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
