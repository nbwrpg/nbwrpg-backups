However instead of clearing \naway the enemy i=\r\nt seemed to attract their attention as few more flew \nin Rodimus&#39; direction=\r\n. Several red targeting lasers `painted&#39; him as \nacid cannons fired in sick=\r\n unison.\n\nOver the more damaged sections of the city a few sweeps patrolled=\r\n the \ngrounds, red targeting beams acting as deadly searchlights scanned  \n=\r\nscorched grounds and burning buildings, looking for stragglers. \nPowerful e=\r\nnergy beams fired at anyone they found, most missing by \nmere inches. While=\r\n it would be difficult to tell for most, people \nwere being corralled. \n\nAt=\r\n the Maximal base Cyclonus looked faintly disappointed at the lack \nof succ=\r\ness they had had for creating an entrance. He was about to \ngive orders for=\r\n renewed attacks when Scourge turned to him. &quot;Sir. I \nbelieve `he&#39; has been=\r\n found. We do not need this place.&quot;\n\nCyclonus&#39;s face was grim as he nodded,=\r\n his shoulder mounted cannons \ndimmed as the energies were redirected. He t=\r\nurned to Nighstrike and \nDarkfate, &quot;You two will stay and either aquire thi=\r\ns facility, or \ndestroy it!&quot; Cyclonus waved his hands at the squadron of sw=\r\neeps \nflying over the Maximal base. &quot;They will assist you.&quot; Above, the \nswe=\r\neps left under the Duo&#39;s command continued to hammer the Maximal&#39;s \nbase.\n\n=\r\nCyclonus turned to Scourge. &quot;Come, the time has come to gain our \nprize!&quot; C=\r\nyclonus leaped into the air, swiftly assuming his dreaded \naerial mode, eve=\r\nn as Scourge did the same. With a blast of boosters \nthey both moved in the=\r\n direction of the quarry =85 Rodimus Prime!\n\nA few of the sweeps flew out o=\r\nver the water circling warily as if \nsearching for something. Red beams tra=\r\nced out over the water&#39;s \nsurface as they began moving somewhat in the dire=\r\nction that Trelos \nhad went. Two of them stopped as they noticed Doc and th=\r\ne others, red \nbeams advanced towards them as guns began to spray firepower=\r\n in their \ndirection.\n\nOOC: Is Trelos undetectable in beastmode? Also I am =\r\nnot sure who is \nstanding where. Is Rodimus, Kup, Doc and not sure who else=\r\n, standing \ntogether or separate?\n\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
