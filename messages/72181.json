They were enemy forces.  Being who he was,\n&gt; Tucson needed to test the waters before he could make a reasonable\n&gt; deduction, and now the determination of his situation was confirmed.  But he\n&gt; knew he couldn&#39;t just attack them.  Perhaps if he went with them he might\n&gt; just stumble upon the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, in that case I suppose I better follow you.  Fine, I will go with\n&gt; you.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIndeed! These soldiers were not as large or as powerful as GRIMLOCK\nand his men were, in fact all of them were smaller then GRIMLOCK,\nalthough the lead figure only slightly. However there was still three\nof them against his one, and he was injured from his last attack, it\nwas a reseanable strategy to hold off until he knew more.\n\nThe lead soldier, the musterd yellow soldier that had a Tricerotop&#39;s\nhead for a right hand nodded, &quot;You have made a wise choice in\nsurrendering.&quot;\n\nThge others two chuckled from eitherside of TUSCON, &quot;Commander\nGuiledart, shall we kill him now?&quot; Said one of the soldiers.\n\nGUILEDART shook his head, &quot;No Hardhead.&quot; He said as he looked at\nTUSCON sqaurely. &quot;He fought like a leader, like a warrior, I am sure\nthat our master will have questions for him.\n\nLooking at HARDHEAD fror a moment as if to make his point clear he\nspoke, &quot;You and HYDRA keep an optic on him while we take him back to\nbase.&quot; he shook his head, &quot;No shooting.&quot;\n\nThey both nodded as they raised their weapons and pointed them at\nTUSCON, HARDHEAD looking a little disappointed.\n\n&quot;This way!&quot; GUILDART said to TUSCON as he gestured for him to follow.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\nThere was a chuckle from either side of TUSCON from the soldiers that\nwere helping to detain him.\n\n"}}
