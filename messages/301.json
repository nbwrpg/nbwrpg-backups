The star \nappearers again, it&#39;s points stretch and contract as Iris speaks again.*\nIris: &quot; That was a short nap. Decided about my upgrade yet?&quot;\n*Iron Raptor shakes her head.*\n&quot; This is to serious a time now, Iris. I need you to download into the Arks \nmajor system and run yourself off of my energy cell.&quot;\nIris: &quot; And what does that mean, you&#39;r gunna run an extension cord from \nyourself to me while you fight?&quot;\n* Iron Raptor snarls.*\n&quot; Remember, you&#39;re a separate system. I&#39;m just going to download you into \nthe Ark and leave an energy cell behind for you. Nothing complicated. \nAlthough, you will have to dormant until someone calls you up for you to \nstart running the defence systems. In simple words, you&#39;r our back up plan.&quot;\nIris:&quot;So if the Ark starts to run low on power and it&#39;s defence systems \nstart to go offline then someone can call me up and then get the Ark to run \nit&#39;s systems off me?&quot;\n* Iron Raptor nodded then quickly downloaded Iris onto the Ark&#39;s main \nsystem, she then detached herself and smiled when the star remained on the \nscreen.*\n&quot; Alright now, I&#39;m going to put you on sleep mode.

Still \nattached was the cord connecting to the screen for the power to activate \nIris.\nIron Raptor turned to Tigerhawk...*\n&quot; Remember that, if the Ark starts to loose power fast just ask for Iris and \nshe&#39;ll start running the systems on her own.If you want, it&#39;s up to you.&quot;\n* Iron Raptor turns and begins to walk towards the door, she had to check \nsomething out in the Lion and Dragon room before the battle began. There was \nsomething that she needed to know.*\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
