That was\n&gt; something new, but with the things coming out of pods these days...it\ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; surprise her much.\n&gt; She looked over at the bike and slowly got to her feet again.       Iron\n&gt; Raptor walked over to it, sat down and started the ignition. It purred\nlike\n&gt; a litten. She smiled, these Maximals sure did know their hardware! Iron\n&gt; Raptor gestured for Plintissa to hop on, but she wasn&#39;t sure if there was\n&gt; enough room for Suukie. She looked back at him...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Can you...fly? Or are you grounded like me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She knew that she couldn&#39;t dawdle for long, Liono had given the order to\n&gt; get back to base and that&#39;s just what she was planning to do...if\nPlintissa\n&gt; would hurry up! *sarcastic**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; WIN A $5,000 SHOPPING SPREE FROM RESPOND.COM\n&gt; Just make a request, and you&#39;ll be automatically entered to win!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3577/7/_/_/_/956757868/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
