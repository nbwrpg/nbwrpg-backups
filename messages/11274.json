Never contradict \nyour own orders, Know your teams functions and capabilities, and most \nof all Never turn your back after a defeat, theres always someone \nlooking for that oppertunity.&quot; He thought about the Irony of the \nsituation Megatron nearly got everyone killed and now they&#39;re having \nthis discussion.\n\n&quot;Megatrons told you you&#39;re nothing so many times you believe it, it&#39;s \nbasic psychological breeding.&quot; Another irony crossed his mind, a \nPsychological warfare specialist telling a Predacon not to listen to \npsychological warfare. &quot;With the Iron Fist at your controls would \nMegatron challenge you or cringe before you?&quot; he shifted his weight \nto the other foot &quot;And when you destroy the Cybertronian Fire would \nanyone question your abilities?\n\n&quot;You have a choice to Make KitKat, would you rather live trying to \nimprove the Predacons? or die as a pawn to Megatron? Only one choice \ngives you a chance at survival.&quot; Inside Phobia thought that they both \nknew the answer but just in case he added &quot;Besides Megatron and his \narmy have been deemed as expendable acording to the council, Do you \nbelieve you belong on that list too?&quot;\n\n \n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank you Phobia,&quot;she said in a low tone,&quot;but I heard them ask \n&gt; Terrorsaur to lead them.

I&#39;m no leader.  I just do what I think is \ngood \n&gt; for me and the team.  Megatron is the real leader of our group.  \nhe&#39;s \n&gt; the one who is programmed for it. I&#39;m....I&#39;m just a soldier and \n&gt; nothing more.  I&#39;ve followed leaders to the inferno and back.  But  \n&gt; lead by different means.  I care about the group I&#39;m in.  I haven&#39;t \n&gt; seen another leader do that before.&quot; she sighs &quot;And even if I could \n&gt; take over the ship, there is always the chance Megatron would label \n&gt; me a traitor and kill me, take the ship anyway and I&#39;d be dead.&quot;  \nShe \n&gt; layed back on the bed and put her hands behind her head. &quot;Sometimes \nI \n&gt; wonder if I&#39;m even Predacon material.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Phobia met her at her room looking at the way she carried \n&gt; &gt; herself. &quot;Pick your head up, you can&#39;t let the troops see an \nunsure \n&gt; &gt; leader now can we?&quot; he intended to keep pushing the word into her \n&gt; &gt; head until she was convinced. KitKat was the best candidate for \nthe \n&gt; &gt; job since Darkmouse had disappeared. &quot;You command well, you \nhandled \n&gt; &gt; things devinely back there, you should be proud.&quot; The last part \n&gt; he&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; meant he was impressed.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
