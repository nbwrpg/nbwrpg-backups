It was not familiar but he knew destructor and it \ncould only mean an advantage. All the horsmen created eachother. Once again \nreunited. Destructor also said hello. Suddenly the origanal 5 looked up in \npure terror. They all looked at the tm2 dragon landing at thier feet. \n&quot;Apocalypse!&quot; those would be the last words of the once great \ndestructor....Apocalypse grabbed him by the throat and proceeded to rip off \nhis head. Apocalypse wiped the mech fluid of his hands. He turned to Kit Kat. \n&quot;My name is apocalypse. We have much to discuss. Destructor was a weak being. \nNow the real war can begin.&quot; all the horsmen bowed on all fours to thier new \nmaster. War looked up with a tear in his eye and one thought in his \nhead..&quot;Destructor will be reseracted. When the day is right.&quot;\n\n"}}
