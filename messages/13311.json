He continued to wiped at the water on his shoulders,\n&gt; thinking it was still on him. He looked at himself, seeing that the\n&gt; acid was no longer eating at his armor. He began to calm down.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked at KitKat. He then turned his head as AirBomber ran out of\n&gt; the Predacon cave. The acid rain was still going on outside, and it\n&gt; looked like it would last for a while. He sneered, begining to smell\n&gt; the Vok originated rain.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
