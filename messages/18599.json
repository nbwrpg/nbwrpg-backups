KitKat came and started acting all friendly, the \nthing a leader should do when welcoming a gues. He heard the order \nshe gave to Destructor about the bot he had captured. He whispered \ninto KitKat&#39;s ear.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t like this. She&#39;s going to do something.&quot;\n\nHe looked to Inferno.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll go. You should be here, since it;s your base.&quot;\n\nStarscream waled to the lab and saw the small bot reading some papers.\n\n&quot;Alright! What are you doing? Who gave you the permission to look at \nthose. They are classified!&quot; He said, ripping them out of her \nhand, &quot;Now, we&#39;ve got some questions. The most importantly, where is \nMegatron?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon had been watching Koj appraoch, and easily dodged his stars. \nHe laughed at him, thinking how foolish it is to attack all of the \nTrainers by himself. Him, Ignatius, Bullet and Savage flew up into \nthe air and surrounded him. Prebon was infront of him, Bullet behind, \nIgnatius below and Savage on top. Prebon laughed.\n\n&quot;So you have seen us. Big mistake. You removed our chip. What a bad \nthing for you to do. You could have had a great lifestyle with us \nKoj, you have much potential. When the chip entered your spark, I \nlearned much about you Koj. I know about Lilly and Soundwave. I also \nknow that you have something to do in the afterlife. Well tonight is \nthe night Koj. Your wish will come true. Say hello to Lilly for me!&quot;\n\nPrebon jammed his lance right into Koj&#39;s throat. Bullet fired two \nmissles at the back of him. Ignatius fired two feather explosives\n(Kind of like grenades. They are feathers, and 10 seconds after they \nattach they explode) and Savage blew two fireballs onto Koj&#39;s head.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
