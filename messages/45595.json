This is an emergency.  I \n&gt; need help.  I can&#39;t explain right now just let down the shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; He runs for the city.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; {Panthos}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     The panther stopped sitting gack lifting a paw to indicate \n&gt; Maximal City just ahead, &quot;Here&#39;s where we part company. While I \ntrust \n&gt; my reflexes to dodge your fire, computer operated turrets are beyond \n&gt; even my skills and it will be embarrassing enough seeking a cr \nchamber \n&gt; for the minor damage you&#39;ve caused me let alone dragging myself to \none \n&gt; after being targetted by them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Smirking lightly he turned moving off away from the Maximal \nCity \n&gt; and Turntail. &quot;Sounds like an interesting fellow your brother.

But he looks just like me if \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt;   helps you.  And believe me he&#39;s done things that make the great \n&gt; wars \n&gt; &gt;   look like a battle with squirt guns.

Sounds like something a \nmaximal \n&gt; &gt;   would do to infiltrate a predacon group. Do something slightly \n&gt; evil \n&gt; &gt;   and against your original nature, get sent to prison and get \n&gt; busted \n&gt; &gt;   out for your knowledge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt;     Shaking his head, &quot;Then again maybe he really did turn to \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt;   side.
