Still, in the same vicinity as Scourge, Cyclonus and Rodimus,=\r\n he manages to keep himself out of sight, using the skills which had been t=\r\naught to him by Prowl. Quietly he stands up against a wall in a dark crevac=\r\ne of the room, making no sound.  He thinks for just a moment at how cowardi=\r\nce this must seem.  To try and make a move and then recede into darkness li=\r\nke a spinless glitch.  That he was not.  He could feel the hold Cyclonus ha=\r\nd over Rodimus and it enrages him to the point where he grips his fists in =\r\nanger.  He thinks to himself.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve come this far, I just can&#39;t give up a=\r\nnd turn the other way.  Rodimus, whether he knows it or not, needs my help.=\r\n  But how to go about this?  This is something Kup nor Prowl trained me to =\r\ndo.&quot;\n\nHe puts his hand on his chest.  His actions were of his spark, not of=\r\n his mind.  His spark was telling him to continue on and not give up. \nHe r=\r\nemembers the good days when Rodimus was very close to all his Autobot comra=\r\ndes, and how many battles were won thanks to him and his guidence.  And now=\r\n, it appeared that Rodimus was the one who needed to be rescued.  He closes=\r\n his eyes in thought.\n\n&quot; Optimus Prime, what would you have done if you wer=\r\ne in my position? If there were a time when I needed your guidence, it&#39;s no=\r\nw.  Rodimus needs me but how?  How can I pull this off?  I&#39;m just one Autob=\r\not with only his bare spark leading him...&quot;  \n\nIn thought he tries to go ba=\r\nck to a time, when he had met Optimus Prime as a young rookie in training. =\r\n He flashes back to one particular moment when he actually got the opportun=\r\nity to talk to the great Autobot leader.  He remembers how he was told that=\r\n no matter how dim a situation was, there was always a light to guide them =\r\nthrough.  It comes to him, the very verse Rodimus had said when he first to=\r\nok up the Matrix of Leadership.\n\n&quot;Light our Darkest Hour.&quot;  He thinks to hi=\r\nmself at first.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s what Optimus Prime would have done. Bu=\r\nt instead of the Matrix it&#39;s up to ME to light our darkest hour.  Of course=\r\n, I awoke first, it must mean something.  All right, Tucson get off your so=\r\nrry aft and make this happen.&quot;\n\nHe gathers the strength to walk into where =\r\nhe could be seen, judging by the heat that lights were giving off, as faint=\r\n as the lights may be.  He stands before Cyclonus, and Scourge unarmed, yet=\r\n ready to defend himself if need be.\n\n&quot; Yes, you do have someone here.  And=\r\n that someone is me.  I don&#39;t know if you remember me or not, we may not ha=\r\nve even met.  My name is Tucson and I&#39;m proud to say that I am a member of =\r\nthe Autobot faction.&quot;  \n\nHe then senses Rodimus not too far away.\n\n&quot; All ri=\r\nght, Rodimus, I have a question for you, and you may answer at will.  What =\r\nwas the very verse that brought the Matrix of Leadership to life, thus givi=\r\nng you the power of its spark?  I know you know this, and right now you may=\r\n be hating my sorry servos, but I think I could use a refresher on what it =\r\nwas.  Can you tell me?&quot;\n\nHe was now preparing himself to get the bolts beat=\r\nen out of him.  This would either make or break things.  It was a heck of a=\r\n gamble yet Tucson knew it was his greatest Trump Card and he was not afrai=\r\nd to use it.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonu=\r\ns@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras&#39; extended his invitation to Cyclonus, and Scour=\r\nge, Rodimus was surprised for a moment, but then just leaned back against a=\r\n support beam, his arms once again folded across his chest. He was about to=\r\n say some thing really clever about this when he thought he heard something=\r\n . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;Rodimus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Rodimus jerked up. He was not sure what =\r\nhe heard,=A0but it sounded like=A0some sort of ghostly whisper of his name.=\r\n He glanced around . . .=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What was that?!&quot; Scourge said, instantly =\r\non the alert, his hyper keen senses also keying in on the strange whisper. =\r\nHe whipped his disintergration rifle out and began to look around, his opti=\r\ncs narrow and watchful. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What was what?&quot; Cyclonus said, obviously una=\r\nware of the whisper, but he too grew more watchful, trusting Scourge&#39;s sens=\r\nes. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;This is Perceptor, We may have a posible intruder...&quot; The Sguri=\r\nty\n&gt; &gt;=A0Drones are released to start a search party&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;An intruder&quot; Sc=\r\nourge almost hissed as he began to move around the room, his weapon was onc=\r\ne again drawn and ready. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus, his=A0quarrel with Cyclonus and Sco=\r\nurge all but forgotten as this new situation developed had already drawn hi=\r\ns weapon as well. There would be time enough for thier fight once this was =\r\nover. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is it?&quot; Rodimus said, his voice tense but ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sco=\r\nurge grunted, &quot;I had it. It smelled like an Autobot&quot; Scourge continued to p=\r\nrowl around the room, his optics glowing as he probed different areas.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Ahhhh . . .&quot; Scourge squated down to run two fingers on=A0the ground and =\r\nhold it to his nose, &quot; . . . But he was here.&quot; Scourge chuckled darkly. &quot;An=\r\nd we shall find him, yes we shall, we have prey.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hydras when he he=\r\nard his security chief warning said &quot;Every one take \n&gt; &gt; a search PArty and=\r\n seek every inch of this base&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodded as he watched, &quot;Hydras,=\r\n I shall help coordinate the seaerh from here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Rodimus glanced b=\r\nack at Hydras and then at Scourge and Cyclonus, &quot;And I&#39;m going to catch tha=\r\nt intruder!&quot; His voice all business now. &quot;Whatever it is we&#39;re going to=A0c=\r\natch it, and dismantle it . . .&quot; Rodimus=A0energized his weapon, &quot; . . . Th=\r\ne HARD way!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge stood up saying nothing,=A0looking off in the dir=\r\nection that his powerful tracking sensors told him=A0were small droplets of=\r\n lubricant, and his quarry. With smooth and whisper silent strides he took =\r\noff at a jog,=A0followed quickly and somewhat more=A0loudly=A0by=A0Rodimus!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
