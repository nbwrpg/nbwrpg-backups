Take THAT!&quot;\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* Rage dismissed the battle that was around her and concentrated on the \nsmell of fowl that seemed to be getting further and further away, she then \nbegan to follow the sent into the forest and leave Scourge behind.\nThe sent was fresh and no that hard to follow, there was a second smell but \nit was a raptor and she knew not to deal with them.\nIt wasn&#39;t long before Rage came within 100 metres of her target, the fowl in \nwhich she was smelling was directly ahead of her. She then went down to all \nfours as she had when she was hunting those two raptors and began to stalk \ntowards the smell, supper might be soon!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
