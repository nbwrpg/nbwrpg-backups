Sounds a bit more familiar..&quot; She gave up and shrugged. \n&quot;Who&#39;d -want- to remember her anyway?&quot;\n\nHer shoulders then slumped in defeat. She was still a kid. A little \nkid who knew nothing about hard war, or even much fighting. Sure, she \nhad a gun, she knew how to use it. &#39;But a gun didn&#39;t make one a \nWarrior, it was your skill&#39;. Or.. that&#39;s how her Father had said it. \nMaybe it was &#39;It&#39;s not the sword that makes you a fighter, but your \nhonor&#39;? Or something..\n\nTeltoli breathed out heavily. &quot;Yeah I know, I&#39;ve got a lot to learn. \nMy Father was all for teaching me, but my Mother.. really wanted me \nto become a Noble. You know, lifting tea cups with your little finger \nout, posh accent and so on. But.. Dad.. he enrolled me in the army. \nBoy was Mum mad about that&quot; She chuckled.\n\n&quot;Back when I was little, Dad always used to say something when he \ncame home from fighting in the army..&quot; The Fuzor shook her head, \ntrying to remember the saying. &quot;I never understood it, until \nCommander Orion made us learn hand-tohand fighting&quot;\n\n&quot;I think it was.. &#39;The speed of the hand decieves the eye, and more \noften that not, what blackens it&#39;&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Every single day I \nheard that, when Mum was fussing over some tiny scratch he may have \nreceived. When I asked what it meant, Mum was horrified. I still \nremember the look on her face&quot;\n\nTeltoli sighed again. Was she getting homesick? Naahhh.. she had seen \nher parents at the promotion party. Nostalgic much? She grimaced.\n\n&quot;The only bad thing about Earth is the .. range of food. Not that the \nprocessed food on Cybertron was nice-tasting or anything..&quot; She \nshrugged.\n\n\n"}}
