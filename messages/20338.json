Now go. \nForward at a steady pace.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus flies up to the section of the Alliance base that contained \nthe cargo holds, a blast door sliding aside to let the Alliance \nleader enter. He walks down a hallway, heading for a particular \nstorage room.\n\nThe constant recent battles had showed that the Alliance was getting \nmore and more enemies, and to counter they could use more troops, and \nZardus had a soldier in mind. He would get this bot, and afterwards \nhe would get a few bodyparts from the late Feline, and clone her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk looks upon Repressor with an angry stare. &quot;I prefer to \nmove on my\n&gt; own wings thank you.&quot; It was bad enough that a former member of \nroyalty was\n&gt; demoted to a peeon scientist, now she was being treated like a \ncommon\n&gt; criminal.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A hawk....&quot; replied Najah at Ldy Hawk mimic an amazing tone &quot;Do you\n&gt; really though that you&#39;re a parrot... anyway a parrot would be a\n&gt; greaat beast mode to you&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk thought for a moment, A parrot would be a great beast \nmode.
