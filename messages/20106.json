He manged to take out dead detionator controlers, a \nwrench, a flashlight head, and old empty containers. Quickstrike had \ntaken all his weapons. Even his sticky bombs. \n\nHe sat back and eyed the panel that had the on and off button of the \nconfinements. He picked up a few of the objects and began to throw \nthem against the panel, hoping that he could hit it.\n\n\n"}}
