He saw the endless amounts of drones\n&gt;stamering about without a clue to live other than what the were told. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He took aseat and turned to a drone, ::: Get me and my commrads a \n&gt;drink,\n&gt;now.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: The drone did as it was told and brought some Cybertronian drink that\n&gt;Megatron had not tasted in a long while. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron then turned to Dark Mouse and Quickstrike ::: Whoever this\n&gt;Panzertron is, he certianly knows how to keep guests waiting.\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Rat Trap made a run for the Ark, but caught a hit from Shredder in the\n&gt;back of hs leg. he fell to the ground with a hole in his thigh. He began to\n&gt;scurry as fast as he could, and with fire al around him from Shredder, he\n&gt;made it into what was left of the Ark and hit a door mechanism. With that,\n&gt;the dor slid down and Rat Trap was safe for the moment. :::\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
