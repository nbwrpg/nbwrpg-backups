He does nothing for now.\n\nAs the probe made contact with Dark Rodimus&#39; spinal command module\n(think brain stem) The probe swiftly began doing what it is programmed\nto do - upload information, images, and data lifted from Rodimus&#39;\ncerebral cortex. Meanwhile the spider spy, hidden as it is, settled\ndown and fed, becoming totally motionless, perhaps even appearing to be\npart of Dark Rodimus himself.\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
