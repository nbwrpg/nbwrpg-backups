He does not let onto his true identity and continues\n&gt; to act like a true panther.  He roars and crouches, and takes a few swipes\n&gt; at his oncoming   restraints.   This fuss is followed by a feline hiss as\n&gt; whiskers lift upward as the cat continues his protest.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTwo gates have crahsed down, one on both ides of the tunnel that\nNIGHTSHIFT was traveling down. At the sound the voices at the end of\nthe hall stopped, then there is a clear command, &quot;Go check it out.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; Came a quick response.\n\nTwo of the humans . . . and yes humans as from their stance and the\nhairlessness that peeks out from under their robes they cannot be\nproto-humans . . . approached looking cautiously through the gate.\n\nThgey looked much like the humans that were in the village but these\nare of course dressed in robes, hoods are pulled up to cover their\nfacial features but their arms can be seen, and they have no hair and\nthey have fully dextrous fingers.\n\nWhat appears to be a wristwatch is on the arm of one. it glints in the\nsmall amount of light filtering into this tunnel from up ahead.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord and Perceptor took their weapons out. They moved quickly to help\n&gt; their friend\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWINDLORD and PERCEPTOR reach the area of NIGHTSHIFT and see him\ntrapped inside, between two gates. On the other side of the gates -\nthe FAR side of the gates the humans have just arrived as well.\n\nOne of the humans nodded to the other and then pulled out what could\nonly be defined as a rifle, although it looked far more high tech then\na simple rifle.\n\na WATCH a RIFLE?????  these are far more high tech then anything\nproto-humans have ever used so far. As far as anyone knew proto-humans\nare still learning to use simple levels and pulleys,\n\nA WATCH or a RIFLE would be . . . SHOULD BE . . . far beyond them.\n\nWith a simple of a trigger he fires something that looks like a dart\nat NIGHTSHIFT, and since he is in the tunnel there is little room to\ndodge!!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
