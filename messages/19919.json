He grabbed her under the arms and helped her back to his lab. A CR\nchamber opened at his command and he placed her inside. It was as he feared,\nthe protoform in her was rejecting the Polarbear DNA. He stabilized her\ncondition for now but ran the risk of losing her if nothing was done soon.\nHe scanned her system and found every cell in her body deteriorating. He saw\nno other action open to him. He opened a compartment on the wall and removed\nthe vial. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Shadow Wing&quot;He thought as he approached the chamber.\n\n&quot;Override Viral search.&quot; he instructed the computer while carefully carrying\nthe vial to the chamber. He injected the liquid into the CR chambers intake\nhose and in turn into Shadow Wings system. Now all he could do was wait for\nthe results.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 03, 2000 9:04 AM\nSubject: Shadow Wing\n\n\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked around looking for Veratis.

ANd my sence of smell is wild. I can smell a rabbit that is\n&gt; in the next sector almost.   It&#39;s great. I don&#39;t know how to\n&gt; thank....&quot; she looked at him as a wave of pain ran over her.  She\n&gt; fell to the ground and groaned. The new programs were in conflict\n&gt; with te form and it&#39;s new abilities. She sent the mental message of\n&gt; fear and pain without realizing it.  She tried to get up but fell\n&gt; over again. &quot;what&#39;s happening? what&#39;s wrong with....&quot; she groaned\n&gt; loudly and let out a low bear growl.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
