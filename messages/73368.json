It was a look of slight\n&gt; annoyance and the fact that Uproar could have been treated long before his\n&gt; symptoms got worse.  Yet he keeps an even demeanor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Legacy, i would have wanted to know about this sooner...  Uproar&#39;s\n&gt; condition has grown worse and so far he has not seen treatment when we\n&gt; obviously have the means to treat him..  Well, that&#39;s over now, but I want\n&gt; him treated now, and then you can do the same for me.  I want no delays and\n&gt; no excuses.  Do I make myself clear?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods as he goes to join Windlord.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Right on it boss.  You can count on us.  By the way, be careful around\n&gt; Wings, he&#39;s kinda look&#39;n like he&#39;s ready ta give someone the business.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride raises his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I got a question.  Legacy says he knows how ta cure Energon Dispersal\n&gt; syndrome.  Howcome he hasn&#39;t helped Uproar yet and why hasn&#39;t anyone noticed\n&gt; that ?  I mean he&#39;s one of us too, we should worry about him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift nods in agreement.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yeah what he said, and what about Cheetor, Rhinox and Optimus Primal?  We\n&gt; cant leave until we find them.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEGACY turned to regard TUCSON and then the others, &quot;I have not\nrepaired Uproar because I was unaware that he was still present on the\nArk. I was under the impression that he had went with you on your\nprevious mission.&quot;\n\nThere was not an ounce of fear or nervousness in LEGACY&#39;s response,\nonly a cold recitation of the facts.\n\n&quot;Come one.&quot; BUMP said as if trying to cheer people up, &quot;Let&#39;s get all\nof you to the medical bay and get you cured.&quot; He was of course talking\nto NIGHTSHIFT, TUCSON and UPROAR.\n\nLORD ELDER chimed in about the missing soldiers, &quot;Yes, we are still\nmissing Cheetor, Rhinox and Primal.&quot; He rubbed his chin, &quot;Perhaps\nStraightshot can use the system to start scanning for Unicronian\nsignatures here on Earth. In a report I received some time ago Cheetor\nhad been captured by the Unicronians. Perhaps we can find all of them\nthere.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from RODIMUS, &quot;And we will check out the those humans\nand see what they can tell us and investigate that rip that Legacy\npointed out.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
