Here....&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Tuscon&#39;s en=\r\ngine shuts &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;down. Clearly there was not \nenough energy to m=\r\nake his escape, and he had not the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;heart to \nleave a comra=\r\nde behind. No matter if it were a Maximal or an Autobot. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\nHis headlights dim, as his body now goes off line due to energy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&=\r\ngt;&gt;exhaustion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As Tuscon ran out of power and came to =\r\na \nstop, a door slid open. &quot;Yes Autobot, she is here, as are others.&quot; said =\r\na voice \nfrom the shadowed interior of the room, &quot;and now so are you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Darkhawk took one of his Feather &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;missiles an=\r\nd ran towards \nTucson and he Used a stunned gun againts Him, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;manually \nstarting to transformn Him to his Robot mode and once he was =\r\nin &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;his \nrobot mode he tied him thignly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As D=\r\narkhawk finished his work, \na figure moved from the room, the ambient light=\r\n finally piercing the shadows as \nit stepped into the hall to reveal the fo=\r\nrm of the head master unit called \nZarak.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He casually step=\r\nped forward and leaned over the \ndepowered and now stunned form of Tuscon, =\r\n&quot;We have use for one like you.&quot; He ran \na scanner over Tuscon&#39;s frame &quot;Yes,=\r\n one so like the old Prime.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&quot;You see it don&#39;t you Autobo=\r\nt?&quot; Zarak said, speaking to the inert form of \nTuscon. &quot;Our scanners also r=\r\nevealed something else.&quot; Zarak straightened as he \nchanged the feed of his =\r\nscanner to link with the base scanners, &quot;There is a \nminion floating over t=\r\nhe old Maximal base, quite possibly attacking it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Zarak =\r\nchuckled, &quot;With it there, all your Autobot and Maximal friends \nare no doub=\r\nt rushing to get there to defend that pitiful piece of technology, \npossibl=\r\ny even some of the ones defending the ark.&quot; Zarak&#39;s optics widened in \nmock=\r\n surprise, &quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t get the call.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Zarak =\r\n\nsmiled again, mockingly, derisively, &quot;And now we have you, so much like th=\r\ne old \nPrime and we have a lightly defended Ark and a Matrix waiting for us=\r\n to \nplunder.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;MWHAHAHAHAaaa!&lt;WBR&gt;&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes=\r\n, we have \na use for him.&quot; Zarak said as he turned to look at Darkhawk, &quot;Br=\r\ning him to my \nbattle station, we have a treasure that awaits us!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; OOC: I am \nassuming that Tuscon is indeed knocked out. Please keep=\r\n in mind Zarak is \nscanning Tuscon quite carefully, so playing possum will =\r\nbe difficult. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n(Cyclonus/Scourge/&lt;WBR&gt;Ro=\r\ndimus/Zarak)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML=\r\n&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0047_01CAB3D1.CBCF2ED0--\r\n\n"}}
