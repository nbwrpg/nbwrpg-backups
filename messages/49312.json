He immediately transformed back to robot mode\n&gt; andhopped out of \n&gt; his hole. He fired at Inferno&#39;s gun as precisely as\n&gt; he could and threw \n&gt; his tentacules at the antbot&#39;s legs, trying to smash\n&gt; him hard to the \n&gt; ground. His eyes were full of fury as he saw that\n&gt; already, SS was \n&gt; down, but Warhead was in an even worse condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; The predacon warrior was lying on his back. Four\n&gt; holes passing through \n&gt; him marked where the lasers had burned their way.\n&gt; His agony was still \n&gt; lasting, though, and the pain he endured was\n&gt; tremendous. His strength \n&gt; effectively vanished, making all attempts to make a\n&gt; sound utterly \n&gt; useless. He still lived, but his spark would not\n&gt; stay for long...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
