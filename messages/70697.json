The core Pasificus Maximal group is just hanging around their\nbase, I&#39;m presuming that in the time I&#39;ve been away that they&#39;ve made\nrepairs and the base is fully operational.\n\nAirly and I were doing stuff with the Bushido Predecons a few years ago,\nthey&#39;re in the city very close to the Valley Mine Pentetron.  I think that&#39;s\nall in what would be modern-day Russia.\n\nRhinox is at that base, he was watching Celeron do experements, but Celeron\nhas since left to investegate the tsunami.  Airly controls Kratos who is\nPredcon commander there and she was covering Rhinox for a few months after\nTankor left.\n\nThere was also a vampiric predecon around the base.  I&#39;m not sure what\nhappened to her or where she ended up, I think it was Robert&#39;s character.\n\nI have a pretty strong predecon with a few screws loose named Trelos.  He&#39;s\na transmetal wild dog (possibly suffering from rabies) and relatively\nlarge.  He&#39;s loyal to Hydras but tends to attack his allies.  Last seen\noutside Hydras&#39; fortress.\n\nAnyway, could I get a synopsis of the predecon valley-mine plot, I&#39;d like to\njoin that, perhaps from several angles.  Ill try to read up tomorrow on my\nday off.\n\nOn Sep 20, 2010 9:26 AM, &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\nTo those who are re-entering the game, just let me know what you need from\nme to make your entry as smooth as possible.
