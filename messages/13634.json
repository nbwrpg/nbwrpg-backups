Why hadn&#39;t Firearm noticed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Rex walks over to the cell and unlocks it. He walks in, his gun ready just\nin\n&gt; case. Bending down, he picks up BrightBlade, carrying her off toward the\n&gt; brig&#39;s CR chambers.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot swears, receaving BrightBlade&#39;s transmission.
