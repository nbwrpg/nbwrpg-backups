I feel like I&#39;m reading a really\nreally bad fanfic, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s in\nthe &quot;so bad it&#39;s FRICKIN&#39; HYSTERICAL&quot; category. But\nit&#39;s oddly Laurel and Hardy-like. Y&#39;know? Just\nthinking that somebody actually WROTE THAT and expects\nit to be taken seriously makes it laugh out loud pee\nyour pants funny.\n\nRecon: Hahhaa, fifteen nuclear warheads is not enough,\nYou cannot harm me, for I am beautiful!\n\nBurning Hammer: La la la la, I&#39;m IGNOOOOORING YOUUUUU!\n\nI&#39;m reminded of when I used to play Transformers with\nthis friend of mine who lived down the street when I\nwas a kid. Dude wouldn&#39;t accept damage if you paid\nhim, ESPECIALLY if he was Optimus Prime.\n\nBy the way...does anybody notice that kids in toy\ncommericals in the 80&#39;s had THE MOST KICKASS PLACES TO\nPLAY? Seriously, they&#39;d always have little\nmini-jungles or rocky mountainous areas. I would\nalways have...the carpet, or my bed...if it was in a\nmountainous area where my Decepticons were teaming up\nwith Cobra Commander to ambush the unsuspecting\nAutobots, MAYBE the couch cushins in the floor. Those\nkids had it made, man. I swear, you could have shown\nthem your brand new Fortress Maximus and it STILL\nwouldn&#39;t have measured up. \n\n*dreamily* Mmmmmmmm. Fortress Maximus...\n\nKeep up the bad work you two. *ROFLMAO*\n\nI&#39;m going upstairs now to engage in my 52nd viewing of\nTransformers: The Movie. BTW, if anybody has all 96\nEpisodes on tape, you should talk to me. \n\nKev.\n\n&gt; &quot;You just can&#39;t get it through your thick skull can\n&gt; you burning hammer. You \n&gt; were created by the devil, I was created by Primus\n&gt; and I was given mighty \n&gt; power for God himself. And I only have mech fluid\n&gt; not blood!
