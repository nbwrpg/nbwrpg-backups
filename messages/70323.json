Meanwhile stones and rocks of varying sizes began to fall. First\n&gt; it was grains of sand, then pebbles and then larger and larger pieces.\n&gt; Tuscon continued to push forward, using his great size and agility to\n&gt; move around what he could and to bull his way through what he\n&gt; couldn&#39;t!\n&gt;\n&gt; For the first few minutes it seemed as if a mountain was going to fall\n&gt; on top of Tuscon and those along with him. After they had traveled\n&gt; several miles the only trembling got worse and worse, as the walls and\n&gt; floor continued to shake and even split in spots.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;CRASH!!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tons of rock fell behind Tuscon, perhaps a mile or so back, falling\n&gt; between them and the area where the battle had taken place, making\n&gt; that area totally impassable.\n&gt;\n&gt; However the area ahead was calm as they trembling stopped. A billowing\n&gt; cloud of dust came flowing up the tunnel from where the rock had fell,\n&gt; but so far nothing dangerous was showing itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahead sensors could not detect any sign of Rodimus, however there was\n&gt; also no other breaks or branches breaking off from their path. There\n&gt; was only one direction Rodimus and his abductor could have gone -\n&gt; Straight ahead.\n&gt;\n&gt; The air is in the tunnel was getting decidedly cooler as the group\n&gt; traveled, and up ahead Perceptor could catch a slight scent of\n&gt; something mechanical. What ever it was out of range of sensors, but it\n&gt; was up ahead and they were steadily approaching it!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
