I am having to\nsqueeze in probab=\r\nly several weeks of battling back and forth into one\npost, so for me it fee=\r\nls really rushed. But hopefully it will have\ngood results :)\n\nBIC: \n\nThe sk=\r\nies crackled around Decibel and the sweeps that were with her,\nlike a storm=\r\n brewing and exploding across the skies! Weapons fire\nspewed out from her a=\r\nnd the sweeps, forcing Hydras and his team to\nback up slightly. With the fu=\r\nll force of her team of sweeps, Decibel&#39;s\nfire power rains down on the trio=\r\n of Hydras, Perceptor and Darkhawk. \n\nPerceptor finds it difficult to actua=\r\nlly target the sweeps directly as\ntheir sensor-scattering armor makes them =\r\nappear like ghosts to him,\nvisible only as they fire, and then disappearing=\r\n again. \n\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the midst of the battle Myrmidon holds of=\r\nf the\nsweeps that come at him, even as his self repair circuits quickly\nbri=\r\nng him to a battle ready status! \n\nJhiaxus slips through the skies, his stu=\r\nrdy armor repelling all but\nthe strongest hits from the sweeps, and yet tho=\r\nse few strikes are\nbeginning to tell on him as his armor is becoming slowly=\r\n whittled\naway. With the loss of Tumult as a target he once again takes aim=\r\n at\nthe sweeps and begins the long and tedious process of taking them out\no=\r\nf the skies a few at a time. He is remarkably effective at this, even\nif it=\r\n does draw the attention of the sweeps to him. \n\nBelow Scorponok holds his =\r\nown, using his massive firepower to strike\nin several different directions =\r\nat once: fusion cannons, laser\nbatteries and his impressive physical streng=\r\nth all work their power on\nthe sweeps that harry him like hyenas on some ma=\r\nssive black bear!\n\nShard&#39;s weaponry against the sweeps works well as severa=\r\nl of them\nexplode in spectacular displays of fire, smoke and debris that\nsc=\r\natters across the landscape. However even as he destroys several, it\nseems =\r\nthat this army is never ending as more and more come to fill the\nplaces of =\r\ntheir fallen brethren.\n\nGrimlock and Lord Elder find themselves hard presse=\r\nd to stand firm\nagainst the onslaught of the sweeps. Their numbers seem alm=\r\nost\noverwhelming, even with the help of the shuttle. Without the ark, and\nw=\r\nith Kup disappearing into the confines of that large black sphere\nthat cove=\r\nrs the ark, there is little that they can do but attempt to\nhold the lines =\r\nagainst what would seem to be an unrelenting foe!\n\nAs they settle in to hol=\r\nd their line, firing their weapons with\nseeming abandon they realize it is =\r\nnot just against the sweep they\nfight. Power and energy crackle once again =\r\nas the power of Scourge,\nCyclonus&#39; powerful and cagy second in command make=\r\ns itself felt\nagainst their defenses!\n\nMeanwhile, inside that sphere of bla=\r\nckness around the Ark Kup and\nLegacy are harried by the machine that floats=\r\n in the air. It fires\nswiftly and then dodges with a grace the seekers of o=\r\nld would have\nenvied. Savage strikes hit the ground and the area around Leg=\r\nacy and\nKup but they are ready to defend the Ark with their sparks if neces=\r\nsary. \n\nRodimus and Cyclonus on the other hand seem oblivious to everything=\r\n\nbut their battle and each other! Rodimus, the once leader of the\nAutobots =\r\nand ex-holder of the Matrix against Cyclonus, once second in\ncommand of the=\r\n decepticons, now Unicron herald and new bearer of the\nnow corrupted matrix=\r\n - stand pitted against each other in a seeming\nbattle to the death!\n\nBlows=\r\n and strikes fly through the air; as they move swiftly through a\ndance of h=\r\nits and feints, fists and laser cannons! Strike, hit =96 hit,\ndodge, the so=\r\nund of unrelenting metal striking unyielding armor rings\nout over their sma=\r\nll battle field, and neither Cyclonus nor Rodimus\nshows signs of falling.\n\n=\r\nYet one must!\n\nRodimus takes one hit, and then another as Cyclonus opens up=\r\n what is\npossibly one of the most powerful weapons in his arsenal =96 his b=\r\nleed\nback receptors. With a look almost of sorrow Cyclonus begins turning\nt=\r\nhe very fury of Rodimus&#39; weapons against him. His punches, kicks and\nfirepo=\r\nwer seem to have little effect on Cyclonus as his palms glow and\nthe very p=\r\nower aimed at him is redirected and channeled against their\ncreator: Rodimu=\r\ns!\n\nFalling to one knee Rodimus looks at Cyclonus a smile spreading itself\n=\r\nacross his cracked and pitted face. \n\n&quot;You smile Rodimus? You have been bea=\r\nten. You cannot stand against me&quot;\nCyclonus slowed, wary at this new tactic =\r\nof his opponent. \n\n&quot;I have not lost at all!&quot; Rodimus snarled. As he struggl=\r\ned slowly to\nhis feet Rodimus&#39; optics begin to glow as he gathers himself f=\r\nor one\nlast assault. &quot;It is you that has been defeated, by your own pride a=\r\nnd\npower!&quot;\n\nAs if with an indrawn breath Rodimus fires an optic beam at Cyc=\r\nlonus -\nhowever instead of being its typical yellow or red it is black with=\r\n\ntendrils of yellow running through it. It is not a laser, but\nsomething el=\r\nse. \n\nReflexively Cyclonus reached up to block it and yet he was still\ncaug=\r\nht by it. It was not an attack, but instead it was a transmission!\nThe very=\r\n same code that was used to break down Rodimus&#39; own\npersonality a few days =\r\nago, it is this same virus that Cyclonus has =96\nby the power of his Bleedb=\r\nack receptors =96 allowed in to infect his\nsystems, almost without resistan=\r\nce. \n\nThe effect on Cyclonus was immediate as his arms dropped to his sides=\r\n\nas he and Rodimus locked gazes! Around them the sweeps seemed to\nalmost pa=\r\nuse as they could feel the infection spreading through their\nleader. \n\n&quot;NO!=\r\n&quot; a scream ripped out, not from Cyclonus but from Scourge as he\ntoo could f=\r\neel the bond that held he and Cyclonus together being\nripped from his being=\r\n! With a burst of energy he and several sweeps\ntore through the battle line=\r\ns, leaving their battle with Lord Elder\nand Grimlock, as they flew to Cyclo=\r\nnus&#39; side - even as the minion\ncommander fell to his knees and slumped over=\r\n!\n\n&quot;YOU!&quot; Scourge raged at Rodimus, &quot;You will die for this!&quot;\n\nRodimus merel=\r\ny smiled as he too fell to the ground, his own wounds and\nthe depletions of=\r\n his own reserves claiming his consciousness. \n\nGrowling Scourge stepped ov=\r\ner to his leader&#39;s fallen body as his\nsensors pickup the faintest readings =\r\nof life. Bending to one knee\nScourge looked down at Cyclonus, &quot;Leader, you =\r\nwill live!&quot; a small\nsmile traced itself across his face as he tried to pull=\r\n Cyclonus up. \n\nCyclonus turned to face Scourge, his optics not the purple =\r\nhue of\ncommand but black and malevolent. With a viciousness they spewed out=\r\n\nenergy, much as Rodimus had fired, its power less then it was, but\nstill p=\r\notent. &quot;No!&quot; Scourge screamed out as he fell over, his systems\nshutting dow=\r\nn. \n\nAround them the battle raged, but without Cyclonus or Scourge to lead\n=\r\nit, the battle quickly became a route as the sweeps fell before the\ncombine=\r\nd forces of Lord Elder and the Maximals as well as Hydras and\nthe forces he=\r\n led. \n\nQuickly the scene of the battle quiets leaving only the fallen\nCycl=\r\nonus, Scourge and Rodimus at its core, the rest having either been\ndestroye=\r\nd or fled!  Even the black sphere that was over the ark has\nvanished, leavi=\r\nng only a black scortched earth around it, and a\nharried yet not quite defe=\r\nated Legacy and Kup, standing ready to\ndefend the ark against a foe that is=\r\n now fled!\n\nThe battle is over!\n\n\n\n"}}
