Someone&#39;s op=\r\nening the door.&quot;\n\nFor now before doing anything, he&#39;d have to wait until so=\r\nmeone closed the door before he could make his move.\n\nAt the battle scene, =\r\nTucson focuses on what he has to do, but then, a flash back is quick to flo=\r\nod his circuitry.  It was the day he feared that he had het his Autobot com=\r\nrades down, by being taken off line suddenly during a horrific battle again=\r\nst the Decepticons.  It was this fear of failure that he would stick to his=\r\n guns, literally and be sure that his comrades would NOT be failed once aga=\r\nin!\n\nHe sticks close to Talon, and the others, trying his hardest to shield=\r\n them from harm.  It was something he thought he had failed to do so vorns =\r\nago.  His fear of losing the ones he cares about, now floods him.  Failure =\r\nwould not be an option for him, as he very much fears it.\n\n&quot; No Hydras, I w=\r\nill not fall to you now or ever again.  Failure to me is NOT an option!  I =\r\nwill NOT fail my faction or the Maximals! &quot; \n\nHe draws his sword, like a Kn=\r\night facing a fierce dragon.  He circles Hydras, and then listens carefully=\r\n to his foot steps while wileding his blade masterfully.\n\nMeanwhile, Night =\r\nShift&#39;s fear was simple, he had always had an aversion to oversized arachni=\r\nds.  Now, he sees a large spider&#39;s web from the corner of his eyes, and is =\r\nquick to jump back away from it.\n\n&quot;WOAH SCRAP!  WHAT THE PIT?!  I AIN&#39;T STE=\r\nPPN&#39; ANOTHER STEP FURTHER!  WHATEVER MADE THAT WEB&#39;S GOTTA BE BIG, UGLY AND=\r\n BAD NEWS!&quot;\n\nTucson listens.\n\n&quot; Night Shift, keep it together! &quot;\n\nNight Shi=\r\nft transforms and tries to back up.\n\n&quot;Uhh uhh, when it comes ta oversized s=\r\npiders, I ain&#39;t gonna have anythn&#39; ta do with it!&quot;\n\nTucson narrows his opti=\r\ncs.\n\n&quot;Oh no, Phobia... Night Shift, listen to me!  Everyone, listen to me! =\r\n Phobia has deployed a fear tactic!  You have to try your best to resist it=\r\n!  It&#39;s the only way to shake it off!&quot;\n\nHe then turns back to Hydras, and r=\r\nemembers that if he did attack the predacon leader with a blade, and if he =\r\nhad managed to slice off a head, two more would grow back and what would be=\r\n the sense of doing that?\n\nHis fear of failure was still real, but his know=\r\nledge of old legends was still fresh in his directory.  The only way to sto=\r\np a Hydra, was to cast a flame upon it&#39;s body that was not its own.\n\nTucson=\r\n accesses his smaller blast cannons, and sets fire to a piece of fallen deb=\r\nris and takes it up into his hand like a torch.  It was a primative method =\r\nof combat, but if legend still held true, it would ward Hydras off.  Hopefu=\r\nlly.\n\n&quot;Slice one head off a hydra, and two grow back.  But cast a fire upon=\r\n it that is not its own, will indefinitely see to its demise...  Phobia may=\r\n have caused fear, but she had no idea that her effect on me, would actuall=\r\ny inhibit me to resort to resourceful thinking rather than running away.&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe now stands solid with the large torch in hand, waiting to see what Hydra=\r\ns would do next.  This was it, a page right out of mythology.  The legend o=\r\nf Hercules stuck solidly in his directory.  Having read something about it,=\r\n in his spare time as a regular Autobot, vorns ago, the story stuck well in=\r\n his mind, and now was coming in handy.  The legend itself depicted Hercule=\r\ns facing the Hydra and finding that cutting off its head was not the way to=\r\n kill the beast.  But taking a torch to it would mean certain death for the=\r\n creature.  And he did just that, in the legend.  But Tucson&#39;s fear did spr=\r\nead beyond failure.  His fear of dishonoring his Autobot and Maximal comrad=\r\nes was now apparent.  He was a Prime after all, and the Autobot way, was no=\r\nt to take a life needlessly.  So, he remains perfectly still, torch in hand=\r\n, facing Hydras with a brave face, but yet, afraid to do the final deed, in=\r\n fear of dishonoring his bretheren.  \n\nMeanwhile, Night Shift gets back int=\r\no robot mode, and notices a lot of spider web material around him.  \n\n&quot;Grea=\r\nt, more webs, more spiders...  I hate spiders.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Quickstri=\r\nde suddenly realizes that his stinky surprise goes terribly wrong.\n\n&quot;Ooooop=\r\ns.... I sooo didn&#39;t mean to do that....  Awww geeze, I meant ta hit whoever=\r\n it is that&#39;s spyn&#39; on us, not you guys...  It&#39;s a good thing I carry an ox=\r\nygen reversal to my noxious attacks. &quot;\n\nFrom his mouth, he blows fresh oxyg=\r\nen into the air, where he had let loose his cloud of gas, hoping that it wo=\r\nuld help rather than harm the creatures around him.  All the while, still k=\r\neeping an ear out for danger.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nig=\r\nhtstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon/kup/Windlord/Hydras\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord f=\r\nrowned and sais &quot;Ratrap, this wont be so easy as we tought&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *******=\r\n*****************************\n&gt; Talon }\n&gt; Talon moved  a way trying to cove=\r\nr more land and at the same time trying to stay close to  Tucson she opened=\r\n fire against Deepstryke and Phobia.

A =\r\nbrief look around shows that it was not one of the sweeps that had damaged =\r\nhim, or even Deepstryke, but none other than Hydras himself!\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Sin=\r\nce Hydras had said he attacked and Tuscon said he was wounded =96 I just st=\r\nitched that together)\n&gt; \n&gt; Talon and Kup continue to fire against Predacons=\r\n hoping to break the Box maneuver, but so far they are heavily out numbered=\r\n by the attacking forces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then a high pitched sound could be heard as =\r\nsomething rocked through the air . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;THOOOM!!!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;               =\r\n. . .
