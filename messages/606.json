Though she still needed a weapon, Tav decided that her optic lasers, \nsword, and energon staff were enough, for now.\n\nTavatron took the rifle from Dinobot and weighed it carefully in her hand. \nShe didn&#39;t like the feel of anything that didn&#39;t require close combat. This \nrifle included. Tavatron had been trained in melee combat and strategic \nplanning. When it came to target practice she was at a loss. Tavatron handed \nit back to Dinobot:\n\n&quot;Not bad. It&#39;s a good weapon. A little too heavy for my taste, but not bad.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
