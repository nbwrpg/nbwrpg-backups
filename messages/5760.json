He felt so content, he had not a care in the world. Just then\n&gt; &gt;Magmatron loomed over the horizon, in a completely different form than he\n&gt; &gt;had\n&gt; &gt;seen. Almost immediately he was whisked away from Cybertron and Battera\nto\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt;ship, he didn&#39;t have a TM2 body, just a regular Transformer body, with no\n&gt; &gt;alternate mode. He was after a mismatched hodgepodge of ships. They were\na\n&gt; &gt;rogue band of Cybertronian space pirates known as the Seacons. There\nnames\n&gt; &gt;were Coelagon, Halfshell, Scylle, Seaphantom and Terrormandar. And they\n&gt; &gt;formed the robot God Neptune (Piranacon for G1 fans). He hunted after\nthem\n&gt; &gt;and shot all the ships they had, one though was only damaged enough to\n&gt; &gt;crash.\n&gt; &gt;It landed on a remote moon. They then formed the robot God Neptune.\n&gt; &gt;CyberShark had to adapt to the area, which was covered with water, he\ntook\n&gt; &gt;the form of a Sharkish creature. They fought and fought and fought,\n&gt; &gt;CyberShark was nearly dead and he had only enough for one last trick, he\n&gt; &gt;popped a grenade and shoved it into the mouth of the Seacon. He was too\n&gt; &gt;weak\n&gt; &gt;to swim away and his ship was to far, the bomb exploded destroying the\n&gt; &gt;Seacon\n&gt; &gt;and CyberShark. He would never return to Cybertron.\n&gt; &gt;     CyberShark woke with a start. He had been dreaming, he must have\ndozed\n&gt; &gt;off watching Pantron. He looked in the CR chamber, Pantron was gone. Then\n&gt; &gt;he\n&gt; &gt;checked the computer, it said he had left a few days ago. He had never\n&gt; &gt;returned.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;I&#39;ve slept for a few days? That cloaking thing must have done it,&quot;\n&gt; &gt;CyberShark said to himself. He heard the servos moving in his stomach.\nYep\n&gt; &gt;that was it, he was hungry.\n&gt; &gt;     He started toward the cafeteria. On his way he ran into Battera, he\n&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t really know how to talk to her now.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Hi, I see you came back to the base. Have you enjoyed your stay?&quot;\nHe\n&gt; &gt;asked, very nervously.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Need a credit card?\n&gt; Instant Approval and 0% intro APR with Aria!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6034/13/_/_/_/962746767/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
