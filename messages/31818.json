Though, she was saying that for her own\nsake, \n&gt; since she almost felt her own mind slipping into the same illusion.\n&gt; Anger...helplessness, that was the strongest feels that he felt, so\nshe felt \n&gt; it as well. Trapped, not knowing what to do. Everything was lost!*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; NO!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Was what she shouted before dropping to her knees and clenched her\nfists, \n&gt; the gun falling to the ground, but in her mind everything was in\nslow \n&gt; motion.\n&gt; Opening her eyes, everything slowed, the booms of explosions went on\nfor \n&gt; minuelts instead of seconds, angry voices were muffled, the slow and\nsteady \n&gt; beat of her spark ringing in her ears.\n&gt; &lt; Isn&#39;t real, isn&#39;t real. NO!&gt;\n&gt; In the back of her mind, something awoke.\n&gt; SCM: &lt; Mwahahahahahahahahhhhhhhhhhh!!! Welcome to MY world!&gt;\n&gt; She could feel Prowl&#39;s transformation, slow like the world around\nher, and \n&gt; painful to her. Though, pain as in a numb throb, like her body was\nheating \n&gt; up inside of the armor and seering the skin.\n&gt; &lt; Prowl!&gt; weak as a whimper as that was, it echoed in her mind as\nProwl \n&gt; continued to transform.\n&gt; But it wasn&#39;t only happening to him, but the SBM in her own systems\nwas \n&gt; struggling to join in on that transformation. But, she had a better\ngrip on \n&gt; hers and fought will with will.\n&gt; &lt; No! I might be able to controle you but you sap too much power,\nleave me \n&gt; weak.&gt;\n&gt; SBM: &lt; Come on! Let me out!...you know you want to.&gt;\n&gt; &lt; No I don&#39;t! You&#39;re horrid!&gt;\n&gt; SBM: &lt; Only blood thirsty. Nothing wrong with that, come on.&gt; it\npushed.\n&gt; &lt; No!&gt;*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
