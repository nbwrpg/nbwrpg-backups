His wings are extended to act like a dismount ramp,\n&gt; making it easier to get to the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet even though there was no signs of the humans he could still sense that\n&gt; they could be somewhere hidden.  His expression is neutral yet stern.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, this planet is still in danger.  The creatures who live here and\n&gt; the environment is under an attack that the unknown enemy is forging.  They\n&gt; must be found, and I too will search for them.  When they are found, they\n&gt; will be brought in front of Talon and myself.  She is my mate, and thus the\n&gt; second Guardian of this planet.  What she deems mandatory, must be performed\n&gt; without question.  And speaking of Talon...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS nodded solemly as he looked upon TUCSON, &quot;I agree this planet\nstill is in need of protecting and I can think of no one in a better\nposition to carry out that assignment.&quot;\n\n&gt; His face lightens up immensely.  He now bows to Rodimus and strides off to\n&gt; find Talon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Talon, it&#39;s me, I&#39;m home and I have missed you terribly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He transforms and walks around the Ark, hoping to find her.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a brightening of his own smile as he gave NIGHTLIGHT an\naffectionate squeeze. &quot;Go, and find Talon. There will be time enough\nfor us to speak.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight relaxed, the nightmare had finished The only thing that she\n&gt; wished now was to see her daughter.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;TUCSON!????&quot; said Talon whose sounded very happy to heard the voice of her\n&gt; beloved &quot;You Have Comeback&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Mommie??? Is daddy with you???&quot; said a childish voice\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon walked camly while she smiled at Tucson while Elita run towards her\n&gt; parents.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;DAD???? is It you??? WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!!!! Mom told me that she will\n&gt; leave to look for you and she will bring you back!!&quot; Said happyly the girl\n&gt; while she ran towards her parents &quot;She was so sad when you dissapeared...&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS kneeled down and took his daughter in his arms, &quot;Yes, it is\nreally me little one.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS PRIME may look different, his frame taller now and more robust\nand there were obvious differences in his lat mode, but his voice, his\nexpression and the way he looked at NIGHTIGHT and now ELITA was\nexactly the same as before.\n\nLEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY also stood looking on, LEO with a broad smile\non his face and BIG CONVOY with a much smaller one.\n\nThe MAXIMALS were coming home, all of them collecting themselves together.\n\nLEGACY was also standing looking at the others his single optic all\nbut unreadable as he scanned the others.\n\nThere was also LORD ELDER as well as POLAR CLAW were standing looking\non as everyone hugged, shook various appeandages or otherwise welcomed\neach other back.\n\nELDER looked over at NIGHTSHIFT and then walked over to him and began\nrunning a scanner over him. &quot;Hrm, we might need to get him to the\nmedical bay.&quot;\n\nPOLAR CLAW looked down at the still unconscious MAXIMALS, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;\n\nELDER paused, &quot;I am no real doctor, but whatever it is on his leg is\nspreading.&quot; He pointed to the end of the dart that was still embedded\nin his leg and how where there was once smooth animal flesh around it,\nnow there was a spider web of metal and it was begining to glow.\n\nPOLAR CLAW waved LEGACY over . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
