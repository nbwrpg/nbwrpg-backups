He is Nightrazor, the minion\ncreated by Cyclonus from the soldiers found in a decepticon shuttle\nthat crashed on Earth. I did base his form on Skywarp and he does\nposses many of his abilities, so I will not actually close that avenue\nif you want to explore it.  \n\nBTW there is a Skywarp that is a recolor of Armada Starscream, which is\nwhere I got the pic for Nightrazor.\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
