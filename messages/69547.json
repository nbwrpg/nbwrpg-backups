He says nothing as he listens intently to the message.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&quot; Greetings, Legacy, this is Autobot Tucson responding to your message.  I have been on leave due to severe damages taken during a battle some time ago, which have left part of my memory erased. I - am now with Lord Perseus&#39;s Maximal group, in recovery from another damage taken in battle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;He sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Sorry, - I&#39;m - just not a hundred percent at the - moment.  Anyway, you may be able to answer this question for me.  I - need to know, if - there are - any remaining Autobots still functioning. &quot; \n\nThere was a slight pause on the transmission line before Legacy&#39;s voice resumed transmission, &quot;Yes, there are several Autobots that still continue to function. However at this time it is the Maximals who are serving as  the dominant protective force for this region.&quot;\n\nSwitching gear slightly Legacy continued talking, &quot;I have detected indeterminant energy signatures coming from an area near the vacated maximal base that may indicate Minion activity. I require a situation report.&quot;\n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\n&gt; OOC: I believe Lord Elder and his team are still guarding the Ark.  Also, I think Legacy\n&gt; was already active: http://games. groups.yahoo. com/group/ nbwrpg/message/ 69251\n\nOOC: Yes you are correct, legacy was active, so there are some who may recognize his voice\nand comm signature. I am only giving a plausable reason as to why he\nhas not responded from then till now, not that\nhe is comming active for the first time. Perhaps he was under repairs or in stassis sleep since then. That battle was a little over a year\nago OOC time but I am not sure how much IC has really gone by.\n\nPreston\n(Legacy)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
