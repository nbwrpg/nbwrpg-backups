She was \n&gt; &gt; approaching the position of Kup and Sunhawk, and she\n&gt; &gt; hoped she was not \n&gt; &gt; too late.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After a few minutes, she was visible to both of\n&gt; &gt; them, but she stood \n&gt; &gt; hovering high in the air. Her arrival, though had\n&gt; &gt; made much noise, so \n&gt; &gt; she was not totally unannounced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
