It certainly looks like Slaughter is between a boulder and a\nvery hard place.  Since just entering the Decepticon base, he&#39;s went from\nthe frying pan into the fire!  I lost Skulletron once, I won&#39;t have him\nressurected into Slaughter and be lost again!\n\nIC:  Slaughter was getting desperately hungry, and had to eat soon or he\nwould die, but he also had to avoid being blown to pieces.  Many projectile\nexplosives were being shot at him.  Slaughter was hit by 15 rifle shots from\nFireStrike, and this time only a few bits of flesh flew off, but slime still\nflew everywhere like normal.  Slaughter got away from Stratus.  He forward,\nbut high enough, and stuck his pincirs into the ceiling, then acted like\ntheir was sticky things on his hands, and quickly went across the ceiling,\navoiding the mega missile, and the rockets, and all shots that were headed\nat him(sorry for missing all those shots, but I didn&#39;t want my new favourite\ncharacter to die!)\n\n    Slaughter jumped down from the ceiling, onto the floor again.\n\n     &quot;HUNGRY!!!&quot; Was the only thing Slaughter seemed to be, and be able to\nsay.\n\n      Slaughter lunged at Shokaract, opening his jaw to try and take a bite\nout of Shokaract.\n\n\n"}}
