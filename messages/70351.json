I have no\n&gt; fear of you Cybertronians.&quot; Her words cold and arrogant, dripping with\n&gt; scorn.\n&gt;\n&gt; She turned to look at small pod that housed Rodimus, her humor still\n&gt; evident. With a quick slash of one of her bladed forelegs she cut\n&gt; through part of the webbed adhesive that was holding the pod in place\n&gt; and the pod began to sink toward the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Take him!&quot; she said derisively, &quot;He has already given me all that I\n&gt; need to know.&quot; She floated higher into the air as she looked at the\n&gt; group, the beat of her wings causing a cool breeze to stir around the\n&gt; chamber.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;For it seems we have others to take his place.&quot; The queen&#39;s voice was\n&gt; almost hungry as she spoke. Meanwhile, from the same direction that\n&gt; Tuscon and his group had entered insectile soldiers entered, evidently\n&gt; the last ones they had encountered from the bruises and dents on a\n&gt; few. This time they were carrying what appeared to Scourge at first,\n&gt; or at least two of him, although they were slightly lighter in color -\n&gt; They were Sweeps, the drone minions of the implacable hunter!\n&gt;\n&gt; She laughs, &quot;My children will feed well, and learn still more.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From a few of the hundreds of dark openings a few insect like\n&gt; creatures came out. These looked somewhat different than the ones the\n&gt; group has seen before. Looking like a cross between a spider and a\n&gt; mantis, they had scorpion no tail cannon like the others, instead they\n&gt; had positioned on their bodies cannon mounts and rocket launchers,\n&gt; although they did have the same mantis legs and blades. However the\n&gt; most striking features was their color. Instead of the darker colors\n&gt; the others have been, these were yellow and orange and red - Rodimus&#39;\n&gt; colors!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Go my would be guardians.&quot; the queen said mockingly, &quot;Leave now\n&gt; before my children grow too hungry too soon!&quot; More children began to\n&gt; be seen coming from the caves as she spoke, although for the moment\n&gt; none of them were approaching the group, but were instead lifting\n&gt; their heads upwards as if sniffing the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
