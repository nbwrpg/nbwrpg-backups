Perhaps he would find out on his own from little snatches of information that escape her awareness or even have to pry it out of her, but at the moment their stomach were the important things.\nHe came to the doors and looked at them, as the light reflected off of the smooth steel he noted distinct figure prints on it, they looked familiar but not so familiar that he could recognize them right off. He pondered about who they might belong to but then decided to think about it later, he pushed open the doors and stood aside for Tavatron to exit first...seeming to become a habit.\nDinobot looked at Tavatron but keeping watch not to make eye contact with her, she had found out TOO much the last time she had looked into his eyes and it had made him uncomfortably was curios of what she found out when she had last looked in him but decided to stick to the topic of hunting, he needed to know where was the best place to hunt. Perhaps Tavatron knew.*\n\n&quot; Perhaps you are aware of a location where prey is abundant?&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
