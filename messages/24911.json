He could sense his power a mile away. \nAs he shot of his energy he flew straight backwards. He watched as the beams \nlanded in the ground about 10 feet in front of him.  He jettisoned straight \nup. He was behind the bot now. His gigantic mouth attempted to take a bite \nout of the bots left shoulder. As he did so he released his flame energy on \nthe the bots upper body which should cause him major damage to his shoulder \nability. his three barrel cannons on each knee fired a few rounds at the bots \nlower back. His tail whipped between the bots legs and sped to go right \nthrough the bots chest. Out of his arm popped the flame sword and he struck \nat the bots right arm with it.\n\n"}}
