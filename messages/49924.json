His whole body had become the mech.\nHe did not react. He simply stared at himself. He did not realize his \nstate.\n\nVlad: It is a pity. I am dead and Phelan is not the cause of my \ndemise...\n\nHe heard the howling of a wolf pack in his back. He turned and zoomed \nhis vision, then changed it to infrared, revealing a dozen of \nsilhouettes in the night.\n\nVlad: Then again...\n\nHe looked at them. They were smaller than the wolves that lived on the \nvarious clan worlds, but that mattered little to him. He wanted to \nlook more friendly to them, to befriend them...\nHis cylindrical cockpit came down, giving the impression of a chest, \nand a human looking head came out. Handsome looking, the warrior would \nhave been attractive if not for for the long scar that ran on the left \nside of his face. The weapon pods both became side-weapons as humanoid \narms took their place. He left both guns in place, as the pack leader \ncame from under the trees.\nThe Khan slowly held his hand out, waiting for the beast to smell it.\nIt did so, then howled, first alone, then followed by the whole pack.\nHe then ran, giving the start to a new hunt. Vlad felt he had to \nfollow them, but first he looked to the skies.\n\nVlad: Where there are wolves, there are man...\n\nHe fired a volley of the now smallish missiles, dotting the night with \nlight bursts. They would know his position. He ran to catch up with \nthe pack. That would keep him to an edge for some times...\n\n\n"}}
