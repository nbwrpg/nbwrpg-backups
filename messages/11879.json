Atma as second in command. Good one! As I recall JP said \nQuickstrike was going to be second in command.)\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickstrike made his way down to a corridor where there were multible doors \nthat lead to the quarters. As he recalled there were at least two corridors \nwith quarters. Not all rooms where quarters as he found out. He didn&#39;t want \nto have her too close to his quarters.\n\nHe kept walking down. He decided a quarters for Dark Mouse would be all \nright, but not so close to his. She may just tag along too much, but he \ncould help her out since she wasn&#39;t at her best.\n\nHe checked a door at the right side of the corridor. It was unlocked so he \npressed a botton on the side that made the door slide open. He was just in \nluck. It was an empty quarters and it had good enough room for Dark Mouse. \nThese sets of quarters that the Trypicon had were huge compared to the \nDarkside&#39;s, and he liked it. He looked around it fully and nodded in \napproval. He walked out and closed it behind him. He walked back to the lab \nroom where Dark Mouse and Black Arachnia were. He leaned against the frame \nof the door and waited for Black Arachnia to finish with Dark Mouse.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
