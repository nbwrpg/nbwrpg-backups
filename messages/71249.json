That&#39;s his problem, R=\r\namulus, he thinks just because he&#39;s got the wheels, he can play hot rod wit=\r\nh the rest of &#39;em.  Now look where it got &#39;em.&quot;\n\nNight Shift Sighs.\n\n&quot;Yeah,=\r\n I know, I know. I&#39;m a workn&#39; vehicle, not a race car.

Those bugs turned tail real fast when these dinos showed up.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s right, if it weren&#39;t for them we&#39;d =\r\nbe scrap right now. But I bet we&#39;re gettn&#39; help because Night Shift helped =\r\nthese guys out earlier, when one of their own had somethn&#39; lodged in his fo=\r\not. Amazing how they remembered that he&#39;s the one who helped them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Night Shift smiles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ya know, we may not have found Cheetor, but,=\r\n we found some new friends out here. Hopefully they might be able ta help u=\r\ns out in the future, and maybe even help us out with our fight against thos=\r\ne preds&#39;n cons. As simple as they are, they can teach us a lot about the en=\r\nvironment, and how ta make the most of it. Oh, while we were sittn&#39; here, a=\r\nnother dino showwed up. I think it was curious ta see what these guys were =\r\nhidn&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus slid down off the Dinosaur and looked at hi=\r\nm critically.\n&gt; &quot;Something just doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot; He said.

I bet these guys can help us get Night Shift=\r\n back ta base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The young adult stegosaurous waits for instructions=\r\n and bobs his head up and down.
