New orders?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Bridge\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos waited patiently til Blackknight/fang arrived on the \nbridge before he began, &quot;Thanks to a new sensor enhancer setup by \nCondor and Sunhawk we&#39;ve picked up the faint echo of a maximal \ndistress beacon somewhere north of our location. By the state of the \nsignal the pod most likely has been here for an extensive period of \ntime, at least since the last beast wars involving Optimus Primal and \nhis crew, likely it&#39;s one of his people forgotten during the \nconflicts.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Swivelling the chair he touched a control on the arm rest, one \nof the functioning monitors brought up a small outline of the ship \nand the area in the general area including the expanded detection to \nthe north. &quot;I want you two to head generally north and see if you \ncan&#39;t pick up the beacon more strongly out there since by the \nreadings we&#39;re only getting an echo of the signal, this means it&#39;s \ndefinately outside our scanning and communication range by a decent \namount. Find the pod and bring its occupant back. If you can manage \nthe pod as well good, if not salvage what you can from it then \ndestroy it. Unlike the original beast wars I don&#39;t want Megatron \ngetting his hands on anything of our peoples.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nodding he shut off the display and turned back to regard the \npair. &quot;I&#39;m hoping the protoform has survived even after all this \ntime, but there&#39;s no guarantee that it will be functioning nor in any \nstate to respond to you, I suggest arming yourselves just in case. In \nwhatever happens good luck and I&#39;ll see you both when you get back.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
