I&#39;ll have to \napologise for taking off so suddenly&#39; Teltoli idly wondered. \n\nSuddenly an idea popped into her head, and she sat up straight. \n&quot;Maximize&quot; She whispered, and transformed into her Bot Mode. It was \ndifferent from last time. While admiring her new form, she suddenly \nlooked up at a bot landed in front of her. \n\n&quot;Well another maximal. Well she&#39;s kinda cute so I will give you a \nchoice you  can join the alliance or die by my hand.&quot; It said.\n\n&#39;Uh Oh, think fast and put on a brave front!&#39; Her mind babbled in \nshock. &#39;I really hope someone else gets here fast! A maximal!&#39;\n\nTeltoli raised an eyebrow, and a smile grew across her features. &quot;Uh-\nhuh... Whatever, I&#39;m not joining those Alliance losers!&quot; Teltoli \nsnorted, then laughed openly in the bots face, her two hands hovering \nnear her rapiers in case he really did try attack. But even though \nshe looked ready to fight, a glint of fear showed in her eyes, and it \nreally didn&#39;t help her position by the fact that she was sitting on \nthe top of her Pod.\n\nShe was shocked, again, as Windlord came to her rescue, standing in \nfront of her bravely. &quot;Wow..&quot; She breathed. Talk about brave! And it \nwas a Maximal!\n\nThe bot stood up and walked next to Windlord, her rapiers unsheathed \nand ready to use.\n\n\n"}}
