Even\nbefore the great wars, we left Cybertron, not without looking at it,\nmind you, but to develop elsewhere.

No Decepticon was ever a slave. Too stubborn and\n&gt; &gt; violent to be one, and way too deceptive. But you will never be the\n&gt; &gt; power you once were. Clinging to that fading dream is futile and vain.\n&gt; &gt; It wastes your efforts. Whatever plan Alpha Trion had for you, it\n&gt; &gt; might not be one that includes giving you commands. You play the part\n&gt; &gt; he has given you, just as I am playing a part given to me by my\nancestors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raises a hand and unleashes a massive surge of coherent light at\n&gt; &gt; Maxima.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Falling to her weakened knees. This was becoming more than she could\nbear. \n&gt; Feeling the pain shooting through her. She would not use whatever\npowers may \n&gt; have been given to her. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glared up at Tyrael. &quot;If you know so much about me, & what Alpha\nTrion \n&gt; wishes of me, why do I not know?!&quot; she spat. &quot;Besides... I am one of\nyour bloody \n&gt; damn ancestors!&quot; she cringed. She was no direct foremother of his, but \n&gt; surely, the vast majority of these bots & cons she was much older,\nthough easy \n&gt; enough for her to change & grow & adjust. Though at times, she\ndidn&#39;t like it or \n&gt; hesitated. She changed nonetheless. \n&gt; \n&gt; She grabbed more strength. She wanted to show she was stronger than\nany had \n&gt; thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Struggling, she finally came to her feet again. Panting, &quot;Eeehhh...\nTyrael. \n&gt; Again, Alpha Trion does NOT govern my future, just as he did not\ngovern my \n&gt; past. He was an Autobot. I am a Decepticon.&quot; An evil grin appeared\nupon her face \n&gt; as her crimson optics glowed. &quot;Actually, I truly enjoyed torturing\nhim often... \n&gt; even with the demise of Elita-1. Oh, the pain from both Optimus\nPrime & Alpha \n&gt; Trion was priceless.&quot; she purred wickedly.\n\n\n"}}
