The explosions started to \n&gt; &gt; blow up the engines first, then expanded to the rest of the ship. \nIt \n&gt; &gt; did not even have time to crash as it came apart in the air. \nBurning \n&gt; &gt; pieces of metal and smoldering airborne ruins fell down hard.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael looked around. His ship and his command were gone, unless \n&gt; &gt; Cheetah and Tigerhawk had managed to get out. He was decided to \nend \n&gt; &gt; the battle though. He looked for Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: Rodimus, Tyrael here. Mind keeping a piece of Hydras for \nme?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanguine and Meteara were in heavy combat. Sanguine rushed at the \n&gt; Vok \n&gt; &gt; and threw her in the air. Meteara quickly engaged her jets to get \n&gt; &gt; control, but was hit by a fiery steel beam. She was grounded but \n&gt; came \n&gt; &gt; back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanguine approached her with deadly determination. She made a \nfierce \n&gt; &gt; looking stiletto out of her hand brought it closer and closer to \nher \n&gt; &gt; enemy&#39;s head.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meteara: Why do you want to kill me?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanguine breathed heavily. Why? There was too much to be said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanguine: Your race killed a brethren of mine. There is something \nin \n&gt; &gt; Predacon behavior that is called vengeance. That is what&#39;s going \non.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Little did she notice the crackling sound growing louder and \nlouder. \n&gt; &gt; As the tip of her weapon was in range of the Vok, a massive \nelectric \n&gt; &gt; jolt jumped on it and shocked the criminal. She fell hard to the \n&gt; &gt; ground too. Meteara stood up. She was clearly wounded too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meteara: I too have many assets. Let&#39;s finish this folly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanguine: Yes, you are right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In an instant, Meteara started firing innumerable bullets from her \n&gt; &gt; machine guns. At the same moment, Sanguine morphed. She made a \n&gt; beast&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; head out of her legs and went at Meteara...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
