Hope you like the names. \n\nBIC:  A Leopard spot male Bot and a black female bot with a red back \ncovered with black polkadots are sitting around a table in the mess \nhall of the Sacrilege Plague.  They are both enjoying a drink of \nLiquid Energon and talking.\n\n   &quot;So Lady Right, you let them go?&quot;  Said the Leopard print bot.\n\n   &quot;Yeah Lepord, But a day later I found them and kind of blew them \nup,&quot;  Says Lady Right.\n\n   &quot;WOW, that is so cool,&quot;  Says Lepord, &quot;The coolest kill I ever got \nwas shooting 5 people with one shot.&quot;\n\n   Just then Snake Eyes message came through the Comm. Unit.\n\n   &quot;Hey Lady Right lets go to the bridge.&quot;  says Lapord as he puts \ndown his liquid energon drink on the table and stands up.\n\n   &quot;Just wait kid, wait until we finish out drink.&quot;  Lady Eyes says \nas she takes another drink of her liquid energon.\n\n   Lepord sits back down and starts to chug his drink.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ^^^^^^^^^   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLobstruck sit in his enlarged room.  He is basically a red bot with \nwhat seems like bumbs all over his shoulders.  He walks over to a lab \ntable with thuds of clang where he steps.  He starts to mix some \nelements when Snake Eyes message comes through.  He places his \nelements where they belong and he starts to walk towards the bridge. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;    A black ship with blood red tinted windows slowly crawls through \n&gt; space.  On board is the ship are enough supplies for a small \n&gt; invasion.  Infact,  that is what this ship is going to do.  In the \n&gt; bridge are many Cybertron Bots.  They all happen to have a Predacon \n&gt; Symbol on their shoulder.  In the biggest chair, located in the \n&gt; middle of the bridge, is occipied by a large green bot.\n&gt;    \n&gt;    The bot looks around the bridge.  When the bots eyes looks all \nthe \n&gt; way to the left, the bot says, &quot;Kan Kick, are you asleep?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    A lightly tan bot, whos legs are up on his console and his head \nis \n&gt; leaning to the side quickly sits upright while he rubs his \neyes, &quot;No, \n&gt; I was wide awake.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    The bot starts to laugh and says, &quot;Don&#39;t lie, it&#39;s not nice.&quot;  \nTHe \n&gt; bot then looks behind him and to the right, &quot;Snake eyes, come here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    The bot he was looking at, who is very thin(For a BW bot), \nstands \n&gt; up and walks towards the bot.  His feet echo against the plating as \n&gt; he comes forward, &quot;Yessh Sshir?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Send out a Communication message to all the members of the crew \n&gt; to come to the bridge.&quot;  The green bot says as he looks at a smudge \n&gt; on his right arm rest of his chair, &quot;Ohh and tell Lady Right that \n&gt; next time she cleans my chair she needs to make sure there are no \n&gt; smudges.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Yessh Sshir.&quot;  Snake Eyes says as he walks back to his console \n&gt; and the ground echo behing him.  When Snake Eyes get back to his \n&gt; console he sends out a Communication message to the whole ship that \n&gt; can be heard by everybot on the ship, &quot;Hello, thissh issh Sshnake \n&gt; Eyessh,  Commander UltraByte hassh asshk me to sshend and \n&gt; Communication messhsshage to tell all of you to get you metalic \n&gt; tailpipe up in the bridge.
