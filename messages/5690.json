They now hang \nlimp. &quot;Outer doors open, close all inner door except ones leading directly to \nmy Conference room.&quot;\n    The outer doors opened and all the doors that didn&#39;t go from the outside \nto the Conference room were shut and locked. This means that everybody in \nstuck where they are for now. He went to the Conference room, the doors would \nopen for him, but only him. He sat down and waited for the Destrocons to \nenter and find their way to the Conference room, it shouldn&#39;t be that hard.\n\n\n(OOC: Yanshosh I&#39;ve been wondering why my base isn&#39;t put up on the events \nboard. Is it that you don&#39;t know where it is? It&#39;s in India. Which is still \nmostly island at this point, if we are 4 million years ago, or is it more?)\n\n"}}
