He did not want to have prime \nknow of his existence just yet. He sent a masquito bug out to the battle. It \nloooked just like a masquito but with much less noise. It watched as Prime \nbegan the attack. It would download his weapons and the skill it saw. It was \nabout 500 feet from them at this point. Galvatron watched from his eyes \nsensors.\n\n"}}
