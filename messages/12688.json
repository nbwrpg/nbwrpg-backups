He&#39;s in th&#39; engine room.&quot; He then picked \nup Black Arachnia and walked out of the room. He walked to the CR \nroom and put her in one of the chambers, shutting it closed. He \nglowered after a moment, trying to piece the situation himself, but \nwith no prevail. He would have to wait until Black Arachnia awoke.\n\nHe took a step back and said to Dark Mouse through his comm-\nlink: &quot;How ya doin&#39; there? Ya up fer somethin&#39;?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
