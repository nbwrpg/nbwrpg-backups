The screen=\r\n got bigger as the minicam approached DARK RODIMUS, in&lt;br&gt;the corner were c=\r\nordinates indicating where they were at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the screen we=\r\nnt black, presumably where DARK RODIMUS vanished&lt;br&gt;from sight and then the=\r\n screen went black again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;That didn&#39;t show us much.&quot; LEO said, clea=\r\nrly getting preturbed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Patience.&quot; WING CALIBER said as he carefully=\r\n reran the scene in slow&lt;br&gt;motion. He zipped back the point where DARK ROD=\r\nIMUS vanished and ran&lt;br&gt;it again slowly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Look!&#39; WING CALIBER said =\r\nas he pointed at the corner of the screen&lt;br&gt;that showed coordinates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;In the corner the cordinates changed. One moment they were showing the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;cordinates of where the Dinosaurs had been and the stand off had&lt;br&gt;occure=\r\nd.
