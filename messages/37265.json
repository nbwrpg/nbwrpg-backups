Okay, here goes.  Okay, I got it.  Okay, get ready.  O=\r\nkay, I say okay a lot.  Okay?  Okay!  Okay, here goes.  Okay, I said thay a=\r\nlready, so I&#39;ll just say it all now.  Damn, I&#39;m serious, I cant stop saying=\r\n okay!  DAMN!  *slaps self silly for 45 minutes straight!*  Whew, oka--THER=\r\nE I GO AGAIN!   *holds breath for 20 minutes.....nearly dies*  No more okay=\r\ns!  Okay?  Doh!\n   \n    See, Skulletron had a special mental ability, he ha=\r\nd the ability to connect his mind with others&#39; minds, and see what they are=\r\n thinking, without them knowing.  They wouldn&#39;t know that he connected with=\r\n their minds unless he told them, or they figured out some other way like t=\r\nhat.  And, here&#39;s the part that his ability is all about, or that he has mo=\r\nstly used it for.  Some of his victims have been Zardus(by request), and tw=\r\no other characters named Ga-I forget, and BrightBlade.  And also, Skulletro=\r\nn used it,(sorry I did that without notice guys, who remember that!) to sor=\r\nt of gain access to everything, codes, cameras, on the CF.  And now, I&#39;m go=\r\nnna use it again, on Motormaster!  Muahaha!  Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not THAT dev=\r\nastating...Unless I made Skulle-er-Slaughter, make Motormaster commit suici=\r\nde(or convince him.)  See, he can display images and sounds to try and chan=\r\nge one&#39;s emotions and feelings about something or somebody.  He made two pe=\r\nople fall in love by displaying images of hearts around one person, and stu=\r\nff.  And, when Zardus asked him to, Skulletron eventually made Zardus give =\r\noff a little giggle, by displaying (corny) humorous things.  Now, in my nex=\r\nt post, tell what Motormaster feels.....\n\n        Yahoo! Groups Sponsor \n  =\r\n     \n       \n\n  Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
