If he is going to rescue him he kn=\r\new he had to be careful as to how to approach the situation. He looks up at=\r\n the rail car, and then to the insectile creatures with a calculating expre=\r\nssion. He wasn&#39;t about to tell them what he was up to. And like a true ninj=\r\nabot, he crouches, builds up the energy in his legs, and then springs up wi=\r\nth kinetic force, to attempt to grab onto the rail car to get him at least =\r\naway from the creatures to where he could plan his next move.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Not on m=\r\ny watch.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the only word wispered from Tucson&#39;s mouth.\n\nThe creatures=\r\n move in Tuscon&#39;s direction with a surprising speed and\nagility, their mult=\r\niple legs giving them enhanced balance and\nstability. However just as they =\r\nwere about to reach Tuscon and sink\ntheir long claws into him he leaped int=\r\no the air! Grabbing on one\nhandhold and then another he leaped and swung an=\r\nd leaped again,\nquickly pulling and pushing himself in the direction of the=\r\n\nmagnetically powered rail-car above his head.\n\nA glance below him shows Tu=\r\nscon that the insect-spider like creatures\nare making no attempt to follow =\r\nhim, but they are watching the car as\nit travels.\n\nInside the car it appear=\r\ns well maintained. it is as if who ever lived\nand worked here had only left=\r\n a few hours ago, everything about it was\nstill clean, working and complete=\r\nly serviceable.\n\nInside the car Tuscon can see a figure laying on the floor=\r\n apparently\nunconscious shoved into a corner.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
