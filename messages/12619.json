With his last ounce of strength, \nFLiq grabbed his head and made sure he was looking directly into this \neyes.\n\n&quot;Brix! Stop it! I know you&#39;re in their! The battle is over! Come back \nto us.&quot;\n\nSlw the grib on Fliq relaxed, and than the blue eyes of Brix retured.\n\n&quot;Oh Fliq! I&#39;m so sorry! We have to get you to a CR Chamber!\n\nBrix carries Fliq inside what was left of the Ark. When he coems \nacross the CR Chambers, only one is left intact, and it is low on \npower.\n\n&quot;Well Fiq, this is the best I can do,&quot; said Brix as he placed Fliq in \nthe final CR Chamber, &quot;I&#39;ll fix them all soon. Right now I need to \nsee what&#39;s going on.&quot;\n\nBrix heads back out to find two Maximals(Striker and Hot Rod) \ntalking. He goes up to them.\n\n&quot;Hi! My name&#39;s Brix. I got here just in time for battle, so what&#39;s \ngoing on, and what are we going to do about it?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
