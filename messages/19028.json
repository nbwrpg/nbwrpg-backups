She went from Phobia&#39;s\n&gt; baby to working on Megatron&#39;s clone spark.  She finished with the\n&gt; baby and set it in a stasis chamber.  She hoped that the baby would\n&gt; give her more info on the temperal rift.  Next she worked on the\n&gt; spark.  She put it into the replicator and set the   replicator on\n&gt; generate.  She hoped it would start to create a perfect clone of\n&gt; Megatron.  Now that she had that done with, she turned to Starscream.\n&gt; &quot;I understand your fears.  And I agree with you, to a point.  I shall\n&gt; make you my war general.  Destructor shall be my strategic advisor.\n&gt; You shall accompany me in my next meeting. But for now, I have to\n&gt; work on this.&quot;  She looked at him and smiled.  &quot;Yes, I do believe I\n&gt; have made the right choice, making you my advisor.  I trust that you\n&gt; will help guide me to do the right thing.&quot; She smiled again and then\n&gt; went back to looking at her console, working on the cloning.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Vulois\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vulois slowly lowered his weapon, and looked strangely at Battera\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Cybershark.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The past?
