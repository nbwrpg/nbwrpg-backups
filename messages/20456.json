That place made her remember \nseveral things about her past\n\nWhy had she betrayed at tht old fossil? \n\nFirst: she hated at her ex-leader.\nSecond... Well, she hadn&#39;t a second reason to do it...\n\nWhat would happen with he?\n\nShe didn&#39;t know... at least the tasmanian-boy hadn&#39;t done more \nquestiond about her interesting past.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Diamond::\n&gt; \n&gt; she was sitting at a table, sipping on some gold energon.  She was \n&gt; staring at the wall, her back to door. She was thinking about why \nshe \n&gt; even opened her mouth in the first place. RULE 1, NEVER TELL ANYONE \n&gt; ANYTHING, so why did she?  RULE 2, THOSE WHO KNOW ANYTHING, YOU \nKILL, \n&gt; so why hasn&#39;t she? She had thse questions running through her \nmind.  \n&gt; She also was trying to figure out what programs where her&#39;s and \nwhich \n&gt; ones were those of the council&#39;s.  She sipped her drink absent \n&gt; mindedly as she pondered her situation.  She wondered that if they \n&gt; ever found out that she had the plans to the whole cybertron \ncouncil \n&gt; network.  Including the plans for an energy extractor that could \npull \n&gt; energy from the planet core and make enough energon cubes to run \n&gt; Cybertron for the next 12 eons.  She sighed and told herself over \nand \n&gt; over again, shut up, clam up and don&#39;t say another word to anyone \nor \n&gt; your slagged and they will get the info.\n\n\n"}}
