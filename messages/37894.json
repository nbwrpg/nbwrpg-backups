As the robot began to do it, Heater put\nhis hands on the chips. &quot;Oh no, I don&#39;t lose at this kind of game.&quot; He\nsaid, laying down a royal flush in order.\n\nSlugslinger nursed his drink some more, and was now telling the robot\nwho was desperate for it, a long ago story. Noises of robots shouting in\nthe backround, something about cheatin. &quot;Well, I remember, I was against\n30 of the finnest Autobot pilots, when I pulled an amazing barrel role,\nand gave em all instant air conditioning.&quot; he said, remembering back\nfondly. &quot;That&#39;s not how it went.&quot; A voice yelled from across the bar.\nSlugslinger looked up angrily, &quot;Who dares to interupt SLugslinger,\nDecepticon pilot.&quot; He yelled, and was met by a fist to the mouth, which\nsent him toppling over. Through bluring optics he looked up, angrily,\nthen calmed down. &quot;Oh.. Hey Quake.&quot; he said, like the whole thing was\nnormal.\n\nThe one robot listening to Slugslinger got upset however. &quot;Hey, I was\nlistening to him.&quot; He said, as he got up, and in Quake&#39;s face. &quot;Kid\nwhat&#39;s your name?&quot; Quake asked. &quot;Jagged, Why?&quot;\n\n&quot;Cause Im gonna rearange your face punk.&quot;\n\n"}}
