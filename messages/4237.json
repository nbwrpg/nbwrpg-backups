It is not in Oregon, but in \nwhere Tibet is today.\n\nAlso, on the location of the Autobots and Decepticons: The Decepticons are \ncurrently in Hell Beast&#39;s ship, while the Autobots are somewhere where Blue \nStinger put them.\n\n::Zardus/Striker/Ramulus::\n\nZardus lands in the alliance base, setting the autoguns on alert just in case \nand walking off to a CR chamber.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker walks into the Ark, heading for the CR chambers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe CR chamber door opens and Ramulus steps out, fully repaired. He walks to \nthe bridge and looks around, noting that everything was nearly scrap. He \ngrowls, looking at a scanner panel that survived the blast. His eyes narrow, \nseeing a blip on the scanner.\n\n&quot;Computer, identify blip.&quot; On his orders, the computer reports that the \ndetected object is a stasis pod.\n\nRamulus nods, activating his comm-link. &quot;I am going out for a pod. I will be \nback shortly.&quot;\n\nWithout waiting for a reply, Ramulus walks out, heading for the pod.\n\n"}}
