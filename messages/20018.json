He knew that they were both near \nstasis lock, but it was still a pity to let a victim go...\n\n&quot;Agreed,&quot; Slayer says after some consideration. Aside from his \ndamages, there was something in him that didn&#39;t want to finish this \nfight. He growls. He would have to check his systems later, these \nacts of mercy were not good, &quot;I shall kill you next time, then.&quot;\n\nTurning around, Slayer transforms into a wolf, boosters emerging from \nhis sides and sending him flying back to the Trainer base.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine Howls loudly as the rifle hits him in the stomoch. He \ncurls \n&gt; up into a fetal position until he hit the ground. Now both bots had \na \n&gt; critical wound that needed tending as soon as possible. If he took \n&gt; another solid shot like that he might not make it back for repairs. \n&gt; (He was to busy fighting Slayer to notice how badly the Ark was \n&gt; damaged.) But the same went for Slayer, if he didn&#39;t get back to \n&gt; wherever his base was he&#39;d gointo stasis lock too. The fight was \n&gt; meaningless right now, if it continued both would cease to \nfunction. \n&gt; Lunarpine transformed to full wolf mode to save energy and speed up \n&gt; repairs. He took a defensive stance in front of Slayer and started \na \n&gt; stareing contest. &quot;This is turning senseless. If we both stay out \n&gt; here we&#39;re both dead if we go our seperate ways we might live to \npick \n&gt; this up another day.&quot; He stepped back a few steps ready to move at \na \n&gt; moments notice. &quot;We&#39;re to evenly matched, I see that now, how about \na \n&gt; rain check till we meet again?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
