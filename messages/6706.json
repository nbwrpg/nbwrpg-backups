His eyes were useless, but his \nsense of smell and his hearing were still 100%, thats all he needed.\n\nThe wolf lay still, wondering about Shadow Wing, She cut her repairs \nshort to return to the fight, she came out to save him. After his \nrepairs were complete he&#39;d appologize. Somehow he couln&#39;t get used to \nthis group. He was used to the military life, soldiers follow orders, \nthese Maximals have more of a social structure than his military life.\n\nHis words still echoed through his brain. &quot;Leave the fighting to the \nKillers not the thinkers.&quot; She could have taken that as a compliment, \ninstead she ran off hurt. &quot;I think maybe I hurt her more than any \nPred weapon.&quot; He hoped she&#39;d get over his stupid angry comment. \n\n&quot;I wonder if the CR chamber can remove this foot that I stuck in my \nmouth.&quot; he was reminded of the crow she&#39;d caught for him. it would be \na suitable meal right about now.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was in the CR chamber getting repaired.  She just wanted to get \n&gt; out of there as fast as possable.  She desided to go back to that \n&gt; cave up north.  Only this time, she&#39;s be more careful to mask her \n&gt; scent. Sne stay out of scanner range.  If she got into trouble, she \n&gt; face it and get out of it or die.  But she didn&#39;t want to come \nback. \n&gt; Not after what he had said to her.  Yes, she would leave the \nkilling \n&gt; to the killers.  She felt her spark sink.  But this time, she \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t come back.  She just had to wait for the CR chamber to \n&gt; finish.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m fine Wing, why&#39;d you have to go and get hit again?&quot;Lunarpines \n&gt; &gt; accept no help attitude showed Shadow Wing that he was OK, other \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; scrambled optics he&#39;d escaped this battle without any major \ndamage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I could&#39;ve dodged the shot you know.&quot; They both knew that he \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t have dodged it, but you&#39;d never catch him admitting it.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
