He had \n&gt; &gt; also lis=\r\ntened to Lord Elder and thought it was best to allow him to do \n&gt; &gt; what he=\r\n needed to do.  With Tallon and Perceptor in his cab, he was more \n&gt; &gt; than=\r\n content and rolls at a good reasonable speed with the two of them in \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhis cab.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Thank you Perceptor, I&#39;m honored to have you with us.  N=\r\now, this is what \n&gt; &gt; I call valuable, having friends among you through the=\r\n best and worst of \n&gt; &gt; times, knowing that your comrades are willing to ma=\r\nke a great effort to \n&gt; &gt; preserve what is most precious, is something even=\r\n the most priceless of \n&gt; &gt; articles can never hold an ounce of wealth to. =\r\n Tallon, after hearing how \n&gt; &gt; you became one of us, it honors me to see h=\r\now much you have evolved and \n&gt; &gt; for that my compassion for you will never=\r\n die.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment, about Hydras, and gathers his words =\r\ncarefully.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I doubt very much that Hydras has any capacity to feel =\r\nthe compassion \n&gt; &gt; that all of us are capable of feeling.  I know that wil=\r\nl be a downfall for \n&gt; &gt; him, because without compassion there can be no lo=\r\nyalty, no honor, and \n&gt; &gt; most certainly no assurance of victory.  And with=\r\nout those elements, I \n&gt; &gt; doubt very much he will be able to hold his plac=\r\ne on the upper hand for \n&gt; &gt; much longer.  We have to gather our forces, co=\r\nme together as one, and only \n&gt; &gt; then will we be able to take back what is=\r\n rightfully ours and preserve \n&gt; &gt; what is remaining of our planet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; With his words he comes to a slow stop.  His sonar systems could only \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; carry him to a certain range, but then realizes that he&#39;s out of range fo=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; proper echolocation system function.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tallon, I&#39;m out of ran=\r\nge for my sonar system.  Could you take my wheel \n&gt; &gt; for me?
