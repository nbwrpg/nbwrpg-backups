She \nappreciated his help in waliking while her systems returned to normal \nfunctioning perameters. &quot;You were guessing? Look Malice, we both know \nthat you very, very good at what you do. So I&#39;m not buying the &#39;I&#39;m \njust guessing&#39; bit. Anyway, as far as taking it easy, we have still \nhave to deal with Unicrom when he gets closer. So let&#39;s get to the \nlab and make sure our little invention works.&quot;  She took a step and \nher legs buckled under her. She started to fall. &quot;ACK!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice was suprised.  He expected her to slug him in the face.  He \nstood for a moment, not moving.  \n&gt; &lt;What was that?  Why did she do that?  I expected he to try to kill \nme.&gt;\n&gt; Malice pushed it aside, but it was still there, nagging the back of \nhis mind.  He walked over to Wolfblade and helped her to her feet.  \nAlthough she was recovering, she still had trouble standing.  He \ngently held her upright, so he could look her in the optics.\n&gt; &quot;You should take it easy.  I was guessing at what I was doing.  So \ntake it easy, ok?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wofblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She had to endure hit taunting but she didn&#39;t have to like it. \nWhile \n&gt; he moved her back and forth, she could feel her hands coming back \non \n&gt; line. She growled but played as thought she couldn&#39;t even move her \n&gt; optics if she wanted to. &quot;You know, your good. Your very good. \n&gt; However, you don&#39;t have to rub it in.&quot;  She frowned a bit and \nwished \n&gt; her body would recover faster. She grumbled, &quot;Great, and if I was \n&gt; around when you and your brother were together, who knows if I&#39;d \n&gt; still be functioning or not. i don&#39;t think I&#39;d survive. Not the way \n&gt; you mix drinks.&quot;  She kept swaying as he moved her back and forth. \n&gt; She felt her legs come on line. She she waited just a second to run \na \n&gt; quick internal diognostic. She was about 50 %.  She decided to use \n&gt; what she had. She stood up as quickly as possible. She turned and \n&gt; leaned on the back of the chair. She kissed Malice on the nose and \n&gt; then walked/hobbled/limped out towards the mess hall door. &quot;You too \n&gt; can learn a few things Oh great Sarcastic One.&quot; as she walked out \n&gt; into the hallway.  She stopped just outside the door and leaned \n&gt; against the wall. &quot;Sheesh, note to self, don&#39;t drink with that bot \n&gt; again,&quot; under her breath. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice began to chuckle softly.  Then it got louder, and loude, \n&gt; until it sounded a lot like Megatron, the Leader of the \nDecepticons.  \n&gt; One could easily confuse Malice for Megatron.  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; He had to admit, she played her act extremly well.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh you don&#39;t mean that, now do you?  You&#39;re just mad I caught on \n&gt; to you so quickly.  At least I didn&#39;t throw you into stasis lock \nand \n&gt; do something bad to you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He let loose another manical laugh, before stepping out from \nbehind \n&gt; the counter.  He stood behind Wolfblade, taking her shoulders in \nhis \n&gt; big hands and gently tossed her back and forth in between his \nhands.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Your a good Maximal or Maxitron or whatever, too bad you were \nnot \n&gt; online when me and my brother came online.  You&#39;d be a real riot!   \n&gt; Oh well, live and learn.  Well at least you should learned a lesson \n&gt; from this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry I haven&#39;t posted lately.

She didn&#39;t budge. Didn&#39;t even \n&gt; &gt; twitch. However, she couldn&#39;t move to save her life. She smiled \n&gt; &gt; slightly and looked at him. He was spiking her drinks and she was \n&gt; &gt; just now realizing it. She was mad at him for now her motor \nskills \n&gt; &gt; went into stasis for a  bit. She took a deep breath and looked at \n&gt; &gt; him. &quot;Malice, I like you. You are a good comrad in arms. However, \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; ever...and I mean EVER do that again, and once I can move again \n&gt; I&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; terminate your programs perminantely.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but \n&gt; chuckle. \n&gt; &gt; He got the better side of her and she was more frustrated at \n&gt; herself \n&gt; &gt; for letting her guard down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am Des Wraith, the Archfiend of Flames.
