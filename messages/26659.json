He was a very \ngood person to RP with, one of the best in fact. I will surely miss \nhim.\n\nI will also participate in the day of silence, and I&#39;ll put a \nmemorial on the Members page. However, I didn&#39;t know Minime \npersonally, I only RPed with him, so I will need some help making the \nmemorial.\n\nHe left me Fliq when he left NBW, and I never really got to RPing him \n(Fliq), but I will start now and RP him alot. I hope Minime is in a \nbetter place now.\n\n\n"}}
