It was lucky that she could read lips.\nShe had had to learn after working with a few corporations on silly little \nmissions. Where the bangs and thunders of explosions were too loud to hear \nand they had to use arm signals and things like that to communicate. Slag! \nThe more she thought about it the more the noticed that she must have lived \nthrough it all. Knowing everything, fighting over every terrain imaginable, \nin ever condition. Sort of made life a little boring theses days. But she \ngot through it.\nBut even though her mind had wondered slightly she still caught every single \nword which Teltoli had said. Though she nodded at just what Teltoli said her \nmother had once spoken.** &quot; You know, she&#39;s right. War can take a lot out of \na person.&quot; **she sneered.** &quot; Just look at me.&quot;\n** There was no expression on her face which said whether she was ashamed of \nherself or was just speaking to hear her own voice. But Teltoli&#39;s mother was \nright dead center on war. It wasn&#39;t fun or happy or even worth leaving \nanything behind for. War was meant for the people who had no lives and had \nto have something to rebuild around to make another one. And what a lot of \npeople built around was violence, hate, and sadness. And there was a word \npeople used for then those three things were combined.\nWar.\nCarnage listened to whatever training her mother had given her.** &quot; You \nshould have listened to your mother.&quot; ** and it was true. But then Carnage \ngrowled when Teltoli mentioned that her parents had betrothed her to a man, \nthinking that Teltoli must have grown up in a pretty posh life for that to \nhappen. Though, that sort of thing also happened to royalty. Though she \ndoubted that Teltoli was related to any. Though, it would be really nice to \ngrow up never wondering where your next meal came from.\nCarnage&#39;s eyes suddenly widened as she suddenly heard Teltoli ask her own \nquestion, feeling rather like she was suddenly put into the spotlight. Which \nwas a really uncomfortable feeling!** &quot; Uh.....&quot; ** Though she hadn&#39;t gotten \nthrough life without knowing some of the tricks of the trade. Carnage lifted \na brow towards Teltoli. **\n&quot; Crashed. Like other of the first bots here.&quot;\n** There was clue number One. She WAS one of the first bots to crash on the \nEarth. But she wanted to know if Teltoli&#39;s mind was sharp enough to pick \nthat up.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
