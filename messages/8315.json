Now we must begin this mission. We arrre \ngoing to make contact with the three main groupes. Battera, go to the \nCybertronian Fire and contact the Maximals. Cybershark, you can go to \nThe Predacons. I chose you for this mission because you are the \ngreatest warrior here, and you can get yourself out of trouble. But \nonly fire if you are fired upon first. Soundwave, you can go talk to \nZardus and The Alliance. Tell them all about this place, where we \nwould just like to talk. Just the leaders, for this first meeting. \nThey may not want peace, but get them to come and hear what we have \nto say. After this meeting they can make a choice. Battera, The \nMaximals are having a hard time. I don&#39;t know exactly what, but I&#39;ve \npicked up transmissions signaling somethong towards a kidnapping. \nHelp them in anyway you can. I want status reports at the end of each \nday from all of you, and return here in a week. There we can all \ndiscuss how each of the leaders feel about this idea. If it&#39;s going \ngood, we will ask them to come for the meeting. If not, we will try \nanother ploy. I am going to stay here and work on away to get the \nsmaller factions to join us for later meetings. All right team, let&#39;s \ndo this!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
