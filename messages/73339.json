I am taking time to set myself\nup for another set of storylines, and am trying to do a better job of\nwriting down my basic lines before I jump in :)\n\nSo I apologize for delays, please give me another day or so to be set.\n\nOne thing I have been discussing with Airly is allowing for the larger\nsizes here. There was an old rule that everyone had to be Beastwars\nsizes, but I think I am going to fudge that one a bit.\n\nI am planning on shifting us to more of a movieverse size scale. If\nyou look at the IDW and the 3H comics that did Beastwars, they mention\nthe size change, but never say how much and Rodims and Primal appear\nto be nearly the same sizes. I think Primal is BIGGER\n\nSo here is a size scale that I might be inclined to use:\nhttp://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/6/67/ROTF_Autobot_scale_guide_1.jpg\n\nIt is based on the ROTF so I think it will work. This way we can range\nanywhere from about human sized for some of the really small Maximals\nand Predacons to the really large.\n\nMy question is: What do you guys think? Do you think this could be\nsomething that would work for your own character concepts?\n\nThere are differences between Autobots and Maximals as Maximals (and\nDecepticons and Predacons) generally the Maximals (and Predacons) are\nsmaller (although not always) and generally do not size change much\nand are more energy efficient.\n\nPlease let me know your ideas. I would like to know how you feel since\nthis is as much your world as it is mine.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
