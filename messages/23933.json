He narrowed his eyes in contempt, and would have smirked \nif he had a mouth. Mud as a weapon? Against him? He assumed the Mud \nwas an attempt to uncover his cloaking. But the cloaking/stealth \ntechnology worked as a not-so-solid sheild around him, so even if the \nmud did hit, it wouldn&#39;t have been seen.\n\nHe then sighed as he watched the battle carry on with his main eyes. \nOne stalk eye was focused on Angel Prime, and the other on Vamprah \nwho had left for no apparant reason. His right stalk eyes swiveled \nover to rest on the extremely fat GodFather, and he would have \nlaughed out loud. Would have. But.. he hadn&#39;t quite figured out how \nto talk, if he didn&#39;t have a mouth...\n\nDiablo grimaced with his eyes, and stepped almost daintily from his \ncover, still sheilded. His two meter long tail, held in an arc, \nswayed above his head. Up and close would be good to observe the \nbattle. Standing about 5 meters from the very back of the attackers, \nhe cocked his head to aim and flung out another cloaked scythe, \npoisoned on the tip, towards WindLord.\n\n\n"}}
