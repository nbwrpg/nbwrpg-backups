He had been serving aboard a\nMaximal science ship deployed to discover and explore\nnew worlds for colonization. He loved science, and he\nloved finding out new things, so this was his dream\nassignment. Not long ago, their sensors detected an\nunexplained rift in space, and in the interest of\nscience it was decided that a small one man craft\nwould be sent out to explore the anomaly. After the\ncraft was fitted with special scanners, he set out. He\nwas checking his navigation computer when suddenly an\nalert sounded. There was a problem with the engine,\nand it overloaded. There was a pod for emergency\nescape in the back of the craft, and he hurriedly got\nout of his chair and ran to it. He got in. The pod\nlaunched just before the craft exploded into a ball of\nfire. Unknown to him, the pod drifted toward the\nanomaly.\n(I know this is kind of long. I hope this isnt\nconsidered moding!)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
