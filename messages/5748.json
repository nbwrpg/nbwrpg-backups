Megatron is \n waiting for Panzertron so they can talk. DarkMouse said that she smelled a \n trap while they were all waiting for Panzertron to appear.  Scorponok stayed \n with Megatron while DarkMouse went looking around.  The only door she found \n open was a CR chamber room.  She was headed back to the room where Megatron \n was when she heard a noise behind a door.  She listened and heard nothing so \n she porcceded back down the hallway to the room where Megatron and Scorponok \n were.)\n\nWrong base. Magmatron&#39;s base is the Destron base.\n\n::CyberShark::\n\n    He looked around and saw that only the hallway was open. &quot;Magmatron, \ncould you let us in to the Cafeteria? We would like to sit down and have a \nmeal.&quot; He commed to Magmatron.\n    &quot;Just a second CyberShark,&quot; Magmatron replied. A few seconds later the \ndoor to the cafeteria opened. CyberShark walked in to the medium sized room.\n\n"}}
