But then it hit her, like a thunderbolt to=\r\n the \nspine!\n&gt; No wonder this bot had so many lethal looking beast modes st=\r\nrewn al \nover his \n&gt; body=85he used them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Zyber watched as the mouth t=\r\no the cave was engulfed in fire, an \nentire \n&gt; cascade of rock sliding and =\r\ncollapsing in from the roof=85to seal her \ninside \n&gt; with this bot.\n&gt; There=\r\n were stretches of cave in there, but she had never explored \nit fully \n&gt; a=\r\nnd knew no other way out. She was trapped!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly she snapped her h=\r\nead towards DeathScythe as he now aimed \nthe weapon \n&gt; towards her, the exp=\r\nression on his face telling her that no matter \nwhat she \n&gt; did, he was goi=\r\nng to get her in the end. But she still had a chance \nto get \n&gt; away, chanc=\r\ne to go back into the cave and try to see if she could \nfind \n&gt; another way=\r\n out! It was her only option, second to being blown to \nscrap.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zyber b=\r\nacked up a few steps before she transformed into robot mode, \nknowing \n&gt; fu=\r\nll well that she had weapons but with her peaceful nature she \nusually \n&gt; r=\r\nefused to use them. And she still did.\n&gt; If worse came too worse she would =\r\nuse it, but she would find that \nopening \n&gt; first.\n&gt; She quickly jumped to =\r\nthe left as DeathScythe fired at her, a \nshower of rock \n&gt; pelting her as s=\r\nhe took a few steps deeper into the cave.\n&gt; But even as she looked up and i=\r\nnto the eyes of the bot she had \nhelped, a \n&gt; flood of fear and regret wash=\r\ned over her.\n&gt; These just might be her last hours, and in truth she really =\r\ndidn&#39;t \nwant to \n&gt; die.\n&gt; And she almost felt like kicking herself for bein=\r\ng so nice all the \ntime, \n&gt; never even seeing that a bot like this could ta=\r\nke her. But for what \nreason?\n&gt; Zyber kept backing into the cave, always fa=\r\ncing DeathScythe as she \ndid so.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; W=85why are you doing this?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n* Her voice was a shutter, and after being surprised like this she \nknew th=\r\nat \n&gt; it had a right to be.\n&gt; Death was standing right infant of her, and i=\r\nt&#39;s name was \nDeachScythe.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________=\r\n________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from M=\r\nSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yoursel=\r\nf, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
