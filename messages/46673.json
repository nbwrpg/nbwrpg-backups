Anyhoo, I was \ncuriou=\r\ns if the board usually gets even MORE active on weekends of not=85\nJust so =\r\nI know if I should check in more than twice daily. \n\n(IC) Flashing a bright=\r\n steel grin, Skullhammer nods in agreement. The \nsmaller transformer, indee=\r\nd less aggressive for the moment than \nCrotale, seems to be a relatively we=\r\nlcoming sort of bot. His voice, \nresonant and full, intones his answer. &quot;Th=\r\nank you. Yes, big I am. \nWith this new form, I don&#39;t expect many of the Pre=\r\nds or Decepticons \non this planet to have much to say when I come into the =\r\nfray. \nSkullhammer&#39;s my name, by the way.&quot; With a curious gesture, \nSkullha=\r\nmmer asks in kind what Crossroads&#39; alternate form is, \nconsidering the tran=\r\nsformer is so much smaller than the massive \nelephant. \n\nThe elephantine tr=\r\nansformer, still in beast mode, takes up stride \nwith the pair of Pacifix a=\r\nnd Crossroads. Considering the advantages \nof shifting, the large creature =\r\nattempts to bring a transformation \nabout. With a powerful flexing of his m=\r\netallic muscles, Skullhammer \nrealigns a myriad of parts to quickly stand b=\r\nefore them in robot \nmode. In truth, the cannons on his arm must appear men=\r\nacing to \nsomeone not expecting the simple silvery-grey elephant to appear =\r\n\narmed with twin cannons built on the sides of his arms. He quickly \ndisarm=\r\ns them so as not to cause any unrest, and the cannons swivel \nback off the =\r\ntop of his forearm to the side, and then backwards by \nhis elbow. \n\nSkullha=\r\nmmer again flashes the same smile, a sort of uncaring and \nhonest smile tha=\r\nt can easily show his lack of desire to cause any \ntrouble. His bright blue=\r\n eyes light up as he sees the familiar style \nof base and equipment, having=\r\n been stuck in a Maximal beast training \nfacility for the last three earth =\r\nmonths. His chest features the \nAutobot insignia prominently (much like Lio=\r\nconvoy features the \nMaximal/Cybertron logo) in a brilliant red. Most of hi=\r\ns accenting \nparts are a red of some shade. \n\nHis strides soon take the sam=\r\ne rhythm of Pacifix&#39;s footfalls, and he \ntreads along the Autobot compound =\r\nwith quieter steps. As an elephant, \nhis four feet make a thunderous racket=\r\n. As a robot, his regular legs \nmake a less violent din, even on metal or c=\r\noncrete. He follows \nPacifix and Crossroads and waits to see what happens. =\r\n \n\n\n\n"}}
