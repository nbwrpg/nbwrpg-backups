Vehement fired down \ntwo rapid optic blasts at Tavatron&#39;s left knee joint, continuing on his \ncourse to follow Unicron.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher transformed to biped mode and flew away from the Cybertronian \nFire, shaking violently for a moment as the energy blast meant for him missed \nand exploded and he was struck with the shock wave.\n\nHe fired off ten rapid optic blasts at Angel Prime, continuing on with his \nflight.\n\n---\n\nReflector flew down hard left, much faster than his comrades, and wasn&#39;t \nstruck with any enemy fire.  He raised an arm, launching two missiles off at \nthe Cybertronian Fire, keeping on course in pursuit of Unicron.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf felt blasts strike his armor, and he turned towards Streetwise and \nGroove, raising his sword and the blade launching out as a missile.  With a \nflash the blade was replaced.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper ducked, one shot striking his chest and almost knocking his \nunbalanced form over.  He growled, firing off three optic blasts at \nStreetwise&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw got a target lock, and launched two missiles from both ports, four \nin all at the Cybertronian Fire.  His brothers could handle the pathetic \nMaximals engaging them.\n\n---\n\nGroove jumped, the missile going off and adding unwanted power to his jump, \nthe Maximal slamming to the ground belly first with a thud.  He shook his \nhead, firing off two photon bolts at Demon Wulf&#39;s right arm in return.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise jumped a few seconds too late, and was thrown harder than Groove \nand landed on his elbow with a sickening crunch.  He couldn&#39;t move his left \narm from the elbow down.  At least he hadn&#39;t been hit with the laser blasts.  \nLucky him.\n\nHe got up quickly and charged, firing three blasts from his photon pistol at \nFlesh Ripper&#39;s left knee joint.\n\n---\n\nShockwave got a target lock, and launched off two missiles at the \nCybertronian Fire, raining down fifteen rapid laser blasts down at Streetwise.\n\n"}}
