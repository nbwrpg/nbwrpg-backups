If an RPG died because of it \nwould be \n&gt; because no one wanted to go Cybertron (obvious there) or because it \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; done right.  Cybertron isn&#39;t really explored that much in the \nAmerican \n&gt; Transformers cartoon, which is the only one I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d agree \nwith LN, \n&gt; don&#39;t base it on Beast Machines.  Yuk.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, on Cybertron, we could do more stuff.  In example, the first \ntwo \n&gt; seasons of TFs, undoubtedly the best but I guess you could say \n&#39;restricted&#39; \n&gt; to Earth and occassional visits to Earth.  Season three, undoubtedly \nnot the \n&gt; best, did have many episodes OFF of Cybertron and Earth.  Going to \ndifferent \n&gt; planets, etc.  A good concept there, even if most art and writing \nwas...shall \n&gt; we say lacking?  Again, season three wasn&#39;t the best but it had a \nLOT of \n&gt; opportunities that this RPG would have as well.  Not to mention we&#39;d \nget to \n&gt; make our own Cybertron and, well, yeah, I went over that.\n&gt; \n&gt; The biggest problem is we&#39;d have to make our own Cybertron.  I mean, \nwe know \n&gt; what Earth looks like, all the places, the geography.  Buuuut, we \ndon&#39;t know \n&gt; that for Cybertron and we&#39;d need to create it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the protohumans, early in the RPG people were equipping huge \ngumby \n&gt; squads of protohumans with weapons and using them as massively \ndestructive \n&gt; armies so they were banned, as they should be.  The RPG&#39;s got along \nfine with \n&gt; gumbies that can&#39;t fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -L. Unitron\n\n\n"}}
