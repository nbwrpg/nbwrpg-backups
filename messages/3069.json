But her wounded side then almost seemed to sense that she was relaxing a bit and suddenly spasms again, causing her to growl and clench her teeth. The fluid had stopped running but the pain and rawness of her side was still there, stinging whenever the covers even brushed against it.\nBut then, in one instant, she no longer had to worry about the covers against her wound because they were no longer there. Even though they had pained her injury they had offered a little warmth but now that the covers had been removed a shiver ran through her body, looking at Prowl as he sat there a bit of puzzlement in her optics since it was him who had removed them.*\n\n&quot; Why did yo...&quot;\n\n* She was just about to ask him for a reason why he had removed the covers when she was stopped short at the sight of his chest-plate opening to expose his spark, she being much to tired and pained to really give any expressions of surprise.\nBut when he leaned close to and then over her she was about to ask him about what he was going to do but it was then that he kissed her, holding her around the waist but his arm brushing against her wound.\nShe drew in a sharp breath from the pain but for some unknown reason the pain soon began to go away.\nIt wasn&#39;t long before the pain of her injured side suddenly disappeared and was left with a bit of a tingly and refreshed feeling, something that would have astounded her if she hadn&#39;t been distracted by something else.\nShe was still tired but her systems alerted her that she had been repaired, repaired?\nBut then it hit her, Prowl had used his own spark to repair her wounds and bring her systems up to the normal functioning abilities.\nA bit of her strength had returned thanks to Prowl&#39;s energy transfer, the ability to wrap her arms around his chest and neck only proving that fact.\nHer breath came a bit quicker and her spark beat a bit faster, thus causing the fluid to rush through her veins quickly and slowly begin to heat her body.\nIron Raptor had been unaware that it was possible for a bot to acquire such a repair mode but in this case she was glad that it was possible, for all she had ever known she could have died in her sleep from the loss of mech fluid.*\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
