Oh well in that case, since I have a choice, \nI&#39;ll choose not to be killed.&quot;\nShe felt foolish over this. She rested her head in her hand. This did \nnot make things easier in the talks for peace.\nShe looked up at the bot. &quot;I&#39;m Battera. How are you. And who are you?&quot;\nShe still kept her eyes on the cannon.  She was starting to trust \nRex. But she had just met this one.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firearm/Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm blinks, looking at Battera. &quot;Um....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This was one strange Predacon, most Predacons ussually didn&#39;t want \nto be \n&gt; killed. But where did she get the idea that he was going to kill \nher?\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm activates his comm-link. &quot;Um, Rex,&quot; he says into \nit, &quot;There&#39;s a \n&gt; Predacon female here that wants me to kill her. What do I do?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If you kill her,&quot; Rex&#39;s voice replies, &quot;I&#39;ll scrap you and turn \nyou into a \n&gt; food proccessor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm blinks again. This was confusing him, but he was easily \nconfused. He \n&gt; looks at Battera. &quot;Rex doesn&#39;t want me to kill you. Do you want to \nbe killed?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
