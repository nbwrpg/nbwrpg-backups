The tea she would \nfeed to the bot once he woke up, it would warm his insides while help repair \nhis internals too.\nShe left the tea to boil while she took the small stone container and walked \nover to the head of her bed and kneeled down, inside the container was the \nsalve that she would use to wake this great bot.\nZyber sighed and took a fair wad of the salve onto the tip of her finger and \nbegan to rub it into the chest of the beast, knowing that it would absorbe \ninto his lungs and help with any breathing problems he might have as well as \nwake him up slowly.\nShe finished rubbing in the salve and wiped the remainder of it from her \nfingers with the edge of one of her furs, then turning towards the tea once \nagain.\nZyber groaned as she felt her aching muscles complain as she sat down by the \nfire, leaning her back against the footboard she had made for her bed years \nago.\nNow, all there was left to do was wait�and hope for the best.*\n\n____________________________IRIS\n\n* Her scanners reptored some other bot which requested her help, or \nsomething of her, she wasn�t sure.\nIris turned her scanners towards the bot whom had spoken, her data base \nidentifying it as Ramulus.*\n\n� What is it you need to know?�\n\n* She had missed half of what he had said, and only knew that he was \nspeaking to her.\nIris had been too busy looking over the remainder of the ship and deciding \nhow to reconstruct it before her attention was drawn to this bot.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
