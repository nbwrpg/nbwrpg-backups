After I talk to Rattrap, Straight Shot and Whe=\r\nelie, I think we can definitely dispatch a ground crew to begin investigati=\r\nng that area of the jungle.    We may not find anything or we might just fi=\r\nnd something.  At least we can start with the basics and go from there.  I =\r\nbelieve Nightshift was very interested in doing a recon mission in that are=\r\na.  Speaking of which, he must be at his place by the river.  He seemed ups=\r\net before he left.  He usually goes there to clear his directory.  He shoul=\r\nd return shortly.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Aug 24, 2011, at 2:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson steps up to view the computer scr=\r\neen. He casts a finger to try to\n&gt; &gt; connect the points of all of those abd=\r\nucted. He looks to Leo at the same\n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yes, that&#39;s right, t=\r\nhere was definitely high concentrations of Unicronian\n&gt; &gt; energy being used=\r\n at that point of time. Every being casts their own\n&gt; &gt; energy frequency wh=\r\nether it be low, medium or high, depending on that\n&gt; &gt; Individuals strength=\r\n profile. Now, if those signatures are the same coming\n&gt; &gt; from those vario=\r\nus locations, it would indicate that the same individual is\n&gt; &gt; responsible=\r\n for those abductions. Leo, can you bring that data up for me by\n&gt; &gt; chance=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The strategist part of Tucson comes back to life as he begins to=\r\n piece\n&gt; &gt; things together as he did on Cybertron, years ago.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Thi=\r\ns definitely takes me back In time when I was going over this with the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsenior officers vorns ago. I actually enjoyed this aspect of military duty,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; it was a good challenge for a rookie in training. And the strange aspe=\r\nct of\n&gt; &gt; that was the fact I just simply had a knack for solving complex s=\r\ntrategies.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then thinks of Optimus Primal, and how they could de=\r\ntermine his last\n&gt; &gt; location.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Mathematics, it has everything to =\r\ndo with numbers. The geographic\n&gt; &gt; coordinates, they lead to areas of lati=\r\ntude and longitude. Now, to find\n&gt; &gt; Primal, he must have informed someone =\r\nas to where he was going. We chart\n&gt; &gt; the distance between here and the in=\r\ntended destination, and map out various\n&gt; &gt; routes leading to that location=\r\n. You will come up with several different\n&gt; &gt; scenarios but, they will all =\r\npoint to one area of bilocation. We then\n&gt; &gt; factor in his rate of speed he=\r\n was traveling at, including the time he left\n&gt; &gt; here, and the time it tak=\r\nes to reach the final destination. Then, determine\n&gt; &gt; the time of his last=\r\n transmission and that will indicate how far he got and\n&gt; &gt; where he could =\r\npossibly be now. I know it sounds complicated, but it worked\n&gt; &gt; on Cybertr=\r\non, so let&#39;s see if that will work here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;One thing I have=\r\n found Tuscon is that often times one cannot solve\n&gt; every mystery while si=\r\ntting at the drawing board.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manipulating the console LEO attempted to=\r\n locate the information. &quot;The\n&gt; last record of Optimus Primal . . . and at =\r\nthat point he was Optimal\n&gt; Optimus, was at the Base of the Pacifist Maxima=\r\nls the Atlantis base.&quot;\n&gt; He paused and read further. &quot;An interesting point =\r\nthat was registered\n&gt; at that point was that thee was an Optimal Optimus Pr=\r\nime as well as an\n&gt; Optimus Primal?&quot; LEO looked confused, then nodded, &quot;The=\r\nre was a\n&gt; meeting trying to determine if one was a minion or not.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (O=\r\nOC: See messages in Dec 2005 for reference to what I&#39;m talking\n&gt; about. Tus=\r\ncon was not here at that point, but the data logs are still\n&gt; present)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n He paused, &quot;I don&#39;t see if anything was truely resolved on that\n&gt; issue.&quot; =\r\nPausing again, &quot;Infact Primal disappears soon after that with\n&gt; no other re=\r\nferences given.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
