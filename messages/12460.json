If they didn&#39;t want her than at\nleast she would be living but not dead. He relized he would be getting in\ntrouble if Blackarachnia didn&#39;t want Solo but he figured he would have to\ntake that chance. He sighs and Solo goes back into stasis lock*\n\n\n(OOC: It&#39;s not moding to make Venomous tell the auto guns to reconize Solo\nas a friend is it?)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 18, 2000 4:18 PM\nSubject: (unknown)\n\n\n&gt; ::DarkMouse::\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at the medical drone and twitched her tail.  She got up\n&gt; and stood at the side of the bed.  She walked back and forth holding\n&gt; onto the side of the bed.  she got to thinking about her hand and\n&gt; wondered if it was a fluke or if it was something that would happen\n&gt; every time.  She looked around and saw Quickstrike jsut outside her\n&gt; door. (If that is correct, I thought the post said he was waiting\n&gt; outside Dm&#39;s room for BA)\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at the medical drone.  She looked and saw a sharp blade on\n&gt; the drone. She picked it up and looked at it.  She put the blade to\n&gt; her hand and closed her eyes.  She pulled the blade and sliced her\n&gt; hand open.  She winced and opened her eyes.  she looked at teh cut\n&gt; and watched the glowing fluid leak out slowly.  Then the cut started\n&gt; to heal.  In a few moments, it was perfectly healed as if she had not\n&gt; cut herself.  She smile and looked at her hand.  She knew that all\n&gt; she had to do was wait.  Once she was fully healed, she would be a\n&gt; great warrior, she thought.  She wondered why this was happeneing to\n&gt; her though.  Why not a braver bot? Why her?  She lifted herself back\n&gt; up on the bed and sat there pondering her new situation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
