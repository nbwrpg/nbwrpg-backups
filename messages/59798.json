He was indeed a bit hopeful that Kit Kat had been \n&gt; here, and Cam&#39;s confirmation was just what he needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the alarms rang, he assumed what was going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: That must be her. Cam, I want you to stay with \nNightlight \n&gt; and Elita. You&#39;ll be their protector, okay? I have to check on \n&gt; Kitkat for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; He hugged her again then stood up and left to meet Kitkat.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
