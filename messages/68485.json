As they walk Tumult has been\nspeaking into his radio, his voice much too low to be understood.\n\nBefore long they came out into a clearing, and before them stands a\nfemale minion looking at some device and a much larger mech that could\nonly be Deepstryke.\n\nThe female is predominantly crimson red with ebony black at her\nshoulders and hips. She is obviously a jet in her alt mode, as her\nslender midriff bore the distinctive outline of a nosecone. Her face\nand forearms are alabaster white, with fin like protrusions of the same\nhue flowing off of her helm.\n\nShe looked up at the duo as they entered, locking gazes with\nNightstrike and Darkfate. Her demeanor was curious and yet strangely\naggressive, her humorless smile she displayed only accentuated this.\nHer optics were deep and penetrating as she stared at them, her head\ntilting slightly. For a moment it was as if she saw not just them, but\nsomething more, something only she could see about them. But then the\nmoment passed as her smile faded and she returned to looking at the\ndevice she had been studying before they came up.\n\nThe other figure that stood here was truly massive. He stood nearly\nhead and shoulders taller then most mechs, with huge shoulders, and\npowerful limbs. He was colored primarily in gunmetal grey armor, with\nred at his large shoulders, and splashes of it at his faceplate. He\nlooked something like a seeker on steroids! He had what appeared to be\na nosecone at his chest, but his frame was far more thickly armored\nthen any seeker. Cannons were mounted on his back, as well extending\nfrom his shoulders extending along each bicep, while on his chest\nappeared to be rocket or missile launchers.\n\nHe turned to look at the female next to him, his face dour and hard,\n�Phobia, you have the information yet?�\n\nThe red and black femme next to him snapped alert and looked over, �Yes\nsir, I have something.� She glanced back at her device and then back at\nDeepstryke, �It has taken some time to make sense of the neural upload\nNightrazor sent us of Hot Rod, but I do believe we have a location of\nwhat they&#39;re looking for.�\n\nDeepstryke nodded, �Does it match the original location Cyclonus sent\nus?� \n\nPhobia nodded as Deepstryke&#39;s head snapped around to look at \nNightstrike and darkfate, his look long and penatrating, �What do you\nknow of the original Ark the fell to earth, and of the Optimus Prime\nthat held the matrix?�\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
