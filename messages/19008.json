He jumped out with a violent leap, near to smashing \nthe pod. He landed with a heavy thud with his long loin cloth flowing \ndown past his knees. His feet hit soft ground. He looked down, \nknowing he was no longer on Cybertron. There were green things \nsticking out from the ground. He picked his head up and looked \naround. There was a blue sky with white things floating past that \nweren&#39;t ships. There were brown and green things sprouting from the \nground that weren&#39;t buildings either.\n\nBerserk sneered. This was out of Cybertron. This was no where near \nhome. He looked at the pod. The Predacon defenses had forced him \ninside that thing out of his own will. They sent him somewhere far \nfrom Cybertron for behind what he was and couldn&#39;t help but being. \n\nHe was on another planet. He took a step back, glaring up. There was \none moon and creatures all bout. Birds flew across the sky.\n\nIt had a serenity, but it didn&#39;t sooth his confusion. After a moment, \nhe started off. He had to find what he was going to do here.\n\n\n"}}
