Allright, I have just completed the poll system in the login, and\n&gt;now its time to begin going full gear toward the election. For this,\n&gt;several things need to happen first:\n&gt;\n&gt;We need to get comfortable with the login system, and all get\n&gt;usernames on it. Several events will lead to this:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. All character profiles on the site will have to be DELETED. PLEASE\n&gt;go to the site and save them on your comps or print them out or\n&gt;something, unless you want to rewrite them, which is fine.\n&gt;\n&gt;2. When you&#39;re done backing up all your chars, send me an email with\n&gt;the following info:\n&gt;    a. Desired username (for the site).\n&gt;    b. A suggestion for the message board colors (two text colors and\n&gt;two background colors. Text and background should look nice together).\n&gt;\n&gt;3. When I get your email, I will make you an account on the site and\n&gt;send you the username and a temporary password for it.\n&gt;\n&gt;4. You should log in (there is now a link from the main page, which is\n&gt;at http://nbwrpg.com), and change your password, using the password\n&gt;changer once you&#39;re logged in. KEEP IN MIND: do NOT use the password\n&gt;from your email or any other service you have. I CAN and sometimes\n&gt;will have to view these passwords for site upkeep, so just make up new\n&gt;passwords. If you forget your password, email me and I&#39;ll send it to you.\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Submit all your chars and everything.\n&gt;\n&gt;After all that&#39;s done, we&#39;ll go on with the council election. This is\n&gt;what I figure it could be like:\n&gt;\n&gt;First everyone who wants to run for council emails me, and I make a\n&gt;list of everyone running. Then I post the list on here, and every\n&gt;person on that list needs to get two &#39;supporters&#39; from amongst the\n&gt;RPGs. People running for council can support one person (not\n&gt;themselves), and people that arn&#39;t running can support two _different_\n&gt;people (they can also support themselves, though why they&#39;d want to do\n&gt;this is beyond me). Once a person that is running for council has two\n&gt;supporters, those two supporters should email me or IM me or\n&gt;something. I&#39;ll keep track of everything. There&#39;ll be a set amount of\n&gt;time to get supporters, and if you can&#39;t get two, then you can&#39;t run.\n&gt;After that we&#39;ll have a vote at the site, and the new council will be\n&gt;elected. I think the council will have three people other than me, so\n&gt;we&#39;ll pick the people with the three highest vote results.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, everything in that last paragraph is just ideas by me and\n&gt;by some of the others and are still up for debate, but I think its a\n&gt;good plan. If anyone has ideas, email me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m sorry that I didn&#39;t RP much today. Programming takes alot of time\n&gt;and energy. I&#39;m barely awake now, so I&#39;m gonna go, but I&#39;ll post tomorrow.\n&gt;\n&gt;Go to the site and save your chars, everyone. Lets get this done as\n&gt;soon as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..........\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
