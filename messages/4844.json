It was five \npeices in all. After snapping them together he aimed it ever so carefully at \nthe head of Rhinox. Being over 100 meters away he needed the scope. He aimed, \nand fired. :::\n\n::: Transanulas sent a batch of cluster missle towrds the auto-gun Rhinox was \nfixing, while Black Aracnia used her spider arms as machine guns and took out \nanother auto-gun. Gremlin, Jackle, Marine, Inferno, and Rampage all began to \nshoot the hull, waiting until they breeched it and could enter. Hell Beast, \nwith a chain gun, fired at Rhinox and waited for the other Maximals to come \nout. ::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron slammed down his transmetal foot. ::: Ah, thats it! Waspinator, \ncome! Darkmouse, stay here, your incharge until my return. When Scorpinox and \nQuickstrike return tel lthem I went to the MAximal base.\n\n::: Waspinator ::: What are we going to be doing?\n\n::: Megatron ::: While Hell Beast and Shuko are outside, we will break inside \nand begin to take the supplies we need...and cause as much werkless havoc as \npossible!\n\n::: Waspinator ::: Ok, and waht about firebird?\n\n::: Ra was sitting, polishing a pistol :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: I dont think we would be very welcomed at the battle if we \nbrought him along. \n\n::: With that, the two Predacons transformed into beast mode and took to the \nsky heading for the fight. :::\n\n"}}
