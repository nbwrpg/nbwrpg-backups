The wisdom of the\nages, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power of =\r\nthe Matrix had almost been Rodimus&#39; life force for so long.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He belong=\r\ned to the Matrix as much as it belonged to him. Now it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gone. The =\r\nMatrix shell being depleted as it&#39;s awesome power was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extracted from =\r\nit&#39;s connection with Rodimus&#39; spark. This was the\nfall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the legend.=\r\n The chosen one was beaten and failed to protect the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very thing he wa=\r\ns alive to protect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was no change of expression from Cyclonu=\r\ns as Rodimus screamed\n&gt; &gt; out. Energy streamed between them, first from bet=\r\nween Cyclonus&#39; hands\n&gt; &gt; to Rodimus chest then sparks began to jump all alo=\r\nng them. For a\nmoment\n&gt; &gt; they rose from the ground as powerful electrical =\r\nfields danced in\n&gt; &gt; between them. Wind began to blow and once placid water=\r\ns became strong\n&gt; &gt; and choppy For a moment the skies darkend as clouds bef=\r\nore the\nsun, and\n&gt; &gt; in the distance thunderclapped .. and then all was was=\r\n complete. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus and Rodimus both fell to the ground for a mom=\r\nent sprawled out\n&gt; &gt; on the sandy beach. Cyclonus sat up his optics going y=\r\nellow then\norange\n&gt; &gt; then resuming thier dark red. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rising into t=\r\nhe air Cyclonus&#39; feet merged and boosters replaced them\n&gt; &gt; allowing him to=\r\n hover in place. As he did so it became obvious that\n&gt; &gt; something about Cy=\r\nclonus had changed with the defeat of this foe. He\n&gt; &gt; was still damaged, h=\r\nis armor burned and desnted in many places, cracks\n&gt; &gt; seeming to run his f=\r\null length and yet he was subtly different. He\ntook\n&gt; &gt; a moment to survey =\r\nhis fallen foe, his look unreadable as if absorbing\n&gt; &gt; what had been done.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As he watched Rodimus appeared to glow red as Scourge and the\nre=\r\nmainder\n&gt; &gt; sweeps above &#39;painted&#39; him preparing to destroy him utterly.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;No.&quot; Cyclonus word was clear and final, his face still somber.\n&quot;He =\r\nhas\n&gt; &gt; fallen as a warrior, and I will allow him to be buried by his\nfello=\r\nws.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The red targetting beams winked off and Rodimus resumed =\r\nhis normal\nhue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From behind Cyclonus Scourge&#39;s gruff voice ca=\r\nn be heard, &quot;Hrmph.\nHe was\n&gt; &gt; a fool! Let&#39;s use this moment to destroy him=\r\n and that city behind us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus shook his head, &quot;We abide by t=\r\nhis battle. We have won, and we\n&gt; &gt; shall leave.&quot; He turned to look at Scou=\r\nrge, &quot;But we shall be\nback.&quot; For\n&gt; &gt; the first time a smile appeared on Cyc=\r\nlonus&#39; face, &quot;but without the\n&gt; &gt; might of Rodimus they will not be able to=\r\n stand against us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sourge nodded in approval.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus l=\r\nooked skyward as sweeps continued to circle and as several\n&gt; &gt; arrived appa=\r\nrently from some distance away. They merged with the rest\n&gt; &gt; and circled a=\r\ns if waiting. &quot;Is everything in readiness?&quot; Cyclonus\nasked\n&gt; &gt; Scourge with=\r\nout looking away from the sweeps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice full of e=\r\nagerness. &quot;everything is going\n&gt; &gt; according to plan.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Good.&quot; Cyc=\r\nlonus&#39; smile faded as he rose up into the air and then\n&gt; &gt; assumed his star=\r\nfighter mode. &quot;Then it is time for us to depart. leave\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus to his o=\r\nwn .. and leave that one as well .. &quot; indicating Remus\n&gt; &gt; &quot;He can report o=\r\nur victory to thier remaing leaders, and they will\ncome\n&gt; &gt; to fear us, as =\r\nall will!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a burst of sheer power Cyclonus rose up into the c=\r\nlouds as\nScourge\n&gt; &gt; followed suit and then the sweeps. Then like some dark=\r\n storm they rose\n&gt; &gt; high into the air took one last sweep, and then faded =\r\ninto the setting\n&gt; &gt; sun, quickly disappearing from all visual sensors.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; -----------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Down below on the sandy beach calm waters =\r\ncontinued to lap against the\n&gt; &gt; fallen form of Rodimus as the tide was beg=\r\nining to come in. Trees in\n&gt; &gt; the distance began to blow and sway as natur=\r\nal winds resumed. the cool\n&gt; &gt; breezes blew sand around, slowly begining to=\r\n cover the scorched sands\n&gt; &gt; on the beach. In the skies sea birds cautious=\r\nly began fly, a few even\n&gt; &gt; were bold enough to try to land on Rodimus, th=\r\ninking him a nice warm\n&gt; &gt; resting place as they looked for fish. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Tranquility with unyielding boldness and resolve began to reassert\n&gt; &gt; its=\r\nelf once more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________=\r\n__________________\n&gt; &gt; Never miss a thing.
