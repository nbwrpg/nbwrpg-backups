She walked over to \nMegatron and watched him on the computer.  She saw what he was going \nand watched and learned as he got into the computer files.\n&quot;Megatron, what will happen when the aliens arrive.  I have never \ndelt with them before.  What can we do to protect ourselves against \nthem.?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looks to the monitor and reads all the data from the \nAliens as \n&gt; Aracnia and Tarantulas hover over him. He turns around and looks \nrather \n&gt; displeaesed.\n&gt;     &quot;This vessle is really quite dangerous....I admit. Its \nautomated, probly \n&gt; by an Artificial Intelligence Program. The only way to defeat it, \nwould to be \n&gt; to transmit a virus into the protocol program of the A.I., and that \nis \n&gt; impossible.&quot; He said smugly, as if he were going to leave them all \nto die.\n&gt;     Aracnia shook her head, &quot;So there nothing we can do?&quot; Her voice \nwas \n&gt; filled with hopelessness.\n&gt;     &quot;Well...further investigation of the Aliens might prove useful \nto there \n&gt; demise. If you allow me, I would like access to all of the \ncomputers files.&quot; \n&gt; He said turning back around to the computer.\n&gt;     Tarantulas shrugged his shoulders, and Aracnia looked to \nDarkmouse and \n&gt; Quickstrike. This was a hard call but she had to do it. &quot;Alright, \nyou have my \n&gt; premission. But dont try anything....we outnumber you and your \nfraction.&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron narrowed his eyes and gave a chuckle as he went deeper \ninto the \n&gt; computer files.\n&gt; \n&gt;     The Armada sailed across the vast darkness of the empty abyss \nthat was \n&gt; deep space. It had begun the journey from its home port to the \ndistant, and \n&gt; rather unintelligent planet earth where the latest outpost had been \nplaced. \n&gt; And now was destroyed.\n&gt;     The ship, measureing exactly one kilomiter in length and half a \nkilomiter \n&gt; around was a large, powerful ship with enugh firepower to turn a \nsmall moon \n&gt; into ruble, let alone destroy a measly group of transformers who \ndar to \n&gt; destroy one of the outposts.\n&gt;     Inside the ship were a series of endless computers and data \ntables. No \n&gt; corridors, no rooms, nothing but data tables that held memory and \neverything \n&gt; that ran the ship. The program, The Artificial Intelligence \nprogram, ran the \n&gt; ship. It thrived in the main computer core and controled everything \non the \n&gt; ship, which actually was its body.\n&gt;     The A.I. was know as Apollo in the universal language that \nfilled space. \n&gt; It researched the beings know as Maximals and Predacons, knowing \nthat \n&gt; Maximals were on the &#39;good&#39; side and the Predacons were on \nthe &#39;bad&#39; side. \n&gt; But that didnt matter. The ones on this planet would be destroyed \nand if they \n&gt; proved o be as weak and stupid as they seemed, Apollo would set a \ncourse for \n&gt; Cybertron and destroy that as well. No need to have any competition \nfor \n&gt; Galactic domination.\n&gt;     The vessle continued its course. In a few hours it would reach \nearth. For \n&gt; now Applo enjoyed the view as pluto slowly came into sight.\n\n\n"}}
