The knew they were in trouble for something the first time they had to =\r\nreport, told by Leo Prime.  They knew him well, and figured that they&#39;d get=\r\n a real earfull from him.  But then a second transmission told them that Tu=\r\ncson would be talking to them instead.  Straight Shot looks to Rattrap a li=\r\nttle concerned.  She knew her brother well, and knew the tones of his voice=\r\n when he was serious about something.  She takes a seat as does Rattrap, wh=\r\no had to have the first word.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m telln&#39; ya this ain&#39;t fair, Straight Sh=\r\not.  That little go cart started it.  He just had ta open his trap and now =\r\nwe&#39;re in serious scrap for somethn&#39; we so did not start!  It stinks like th=\r\ne trash compactor in the garbage bay!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot sighs.\n\n&quot; Tell me abo=\r\nut it. And the worst part is, Tucson is giving the lecture.  I know he&#39;s no=\r\nt gonna let anyone off easy, just by the tone of his voice, it sounded seri=\r\nous.  I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re getting in trouble for sticking up for ourselve=\r\ns.  What&#39;s so wrong about that?&quot;\n\nShe shrugs, as Rattrap sighs.\n\n&quot; Ya got m=\r\ne Prickles.  Oh yeah, your new nickname.  No offense.&quot;\n\nShe smiles.\n\n&quot;Nah, =\r\nnone taken, I like it.  Prickles...  That&#39;s a new one.&quot; \n\nRattrap tries to =\r\nmuster a smile.\n\n&quot; Kinda like when I used ta call your brother, Wheels..  H=\r\nmm, now I think I better call him Wings.  They&#39;re big enough. Anyway, I won=\r\nder what he&#39;s gonna say ta us and what kinda punishments he&#39;s got planned. =\r\nYa know he&#39;s gonna do that, right?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot;Yup.  Guess we =\r\njust take what comes.&quot;\n\nThey now sit patiently and wait for Wheelie to come=\r\n in.\n\n\n"}}
