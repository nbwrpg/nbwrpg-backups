Some of the more exotic equipment \nsurprises her a bit, but she&#39;s more interested in the basics so far - \nprimarily engine components.\n\nRiekan/Torin::\n\n&quot;How&#39;s our companion, Torin?&quot; Riekan asks.  &quot;All the procedures taken \ncare of?&quot;\n\n&quot;Years ago, my friend,&quot; Torin replies as he reconnects damaged wires \nbehind a service panel.  &quot;We&#39;ve been prepared for something like this \nfor a long time.  It would take a master hacker to detect any of the \nprograms we installed - and a true legend to remove them without \ndoing permanent mental damage.&quot;\n\nThe two males share a sinister laugh ...\n\nPhoenix::\n\nThe nightmares strike again.  Phoenix once again relives her most \ntraumatic experience, as Clawful comes closer and closer, a sickening \nleer on his face; she does everything she can to fend him off, but \nit&#39;s far from enough.  Once again she feels the pain and humiliation \nthat is every girl&#39;s worst fear ...\n\n&quot;NOOOOOO!!!&quot;  The prisoner sits bolt upright, snapping awake.  \nLooking wildly around, she realizes once again it&#39;s been a long time \nsince that day.  She&#39;s stranded with her captors on some planet in \nthe distant past.  And Clawful, thankfully, is in his quarters in \nstasis lock.  Finally, Phoenix manages to relax.\n\nJayde::\n\nPhoenix is not the only one with the past in mind, as Jayde reaches \nup to key the door to her sister&#39;s quarters.  Lunara is there, as \nbefore, stasis-locked on the recharge bed.\n\n&quot;Lunara,&quot; Jayde whispers, even though she knows the larger bot can&#39;t \nhear her, &quot;please don&#39;t die on me.&quot;  The blue and black Rogue walks \nover to Lunara&#39;s bedside.  &quot;We&#39;ve been together as long as I&#39;ve been \nonline.  I don&#39;t know how I could get by without you in my life.&quot;  \nShe reaches into her subspace compartment and pulls out a small disk \nwith a Maximal insignia on it.  A sad smile forms on her face.  \n\n&quot;You always told me to get rid of this, that it would just get me in \ntrouble.  I wish I could, but I just can&#39;t help thinking sometimes - \nwhat would it be like, if we&#39;d never left to join the Rogues?  Where \nwould we be now?  Would you still be drawing crowds with your songs \nand dance routines?  Would we be off someplace, not knowing or caring \nwhat some funky group of terrorists was up to - just like we don&#39;t \nreally care what our fellow Maximals are doing now?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker gets back to his shuttle, lands, and transforms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  Just pick out the stuff you need and I&#39;ll get the \ntransport \n&gt; ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; He goes inside, takes a crowbar, and opens a crate with it and \nbegins \n&gt; to get out wheels.  Nearby is any almost inperceptible secret \n&gt; compartment, but he throws the lid of the box over it just in case.\n\n\n\n"}}
