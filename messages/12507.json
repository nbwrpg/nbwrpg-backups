Could you two please put Chardate and Feline on hold until Wednesday? Please? This is a great scene and I want to continue it myself, without having to lend Iron Raptor out to anyone.\nIt would be really nice of you both if you did that for me, but only if you want to.\nBesides, that would also mean that I owed you both a favor, and I do pay them back richly.\nThank You.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor smiled and shook Chardates hand firmly, him probably not knowing that there was more power behind that hand he held then he thought.\nShe released his hand but not before she gave him a little sample of her strength, giving it a little squeeze before letting go. Knowing that she could easily crush that hand of his if she so desired, the power or both beast modes making it so she could actually do so.\nHer head tilted to the side in thought for a moment, listening to his question after his greeting.\nThat WAS a good question, one that she didn�t know the answer to.\nBut she would give him the best answer that she could. *\n\n� To say the truth, Chardate. I have no idea where he is, or his second-in-command. But I do intend to find out, and I�ll let you know when I do.�\n\n* The truth was that she would ask Prowl where Liono was, knowing that he would probably know more then she did at the moment.\nBut then her smile flashed across her face again and she gestured towards the smaller Conference Room, thinking that Feline had waited in there long enough and it was time to get down to work.\nIron Raptor looked at Chardate before walking over to the door, stopping as it slid open and looking over her shoulder-plate. *\n\n� You�re welcome to come in if you want. And if you have any questions you would like me to answer, now is the time.�\n\n* With that she walked into the room, her optics adjusting to the dim light of the room as she entered. The door closing behind her but ready to open in case Chardate would wish to enter.\nWith a quick optic she spotted Feline, looking her over again and wondering why she seemed so strange to her.\nIt seemed as if she really wasn�t what she seemed, and her beast modes were going crazy with warnings directed at her.\nBut, with an iron will she pushed them down and approached the cat-bot, passing her seat and coming to rest standing in front of a holo-projector. She looked over the piece of equipment for a moment then turning her attention to the console that lay before her, pulling her hands behind her back and keeping her optics on the console. Indeed this new ship had many marvels, but she would have time to craze over them later. \nShe had no intention of telling Feline just why she had called her here just yet, wanting to know this fembot a little more just before her intentions were reviled. *\n\n� So, more fresh meat to the grinder, huh? Well, the more the better.�\n\n* She said this into the console, her back set towards Feline with her hands still clasped behind her back. But then, slowly and a silent sigh she turned towards the cat-bot, her expression one of calm but also of a firm authority. One that she used a bit too often with new bots. *\n\n� I am Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander. If you don�t mind, I would like to ask you a few questions since you are new to us.  Mostly of what your qualifications are and what position you strive to achieve while you�re with us. Standard procedure. But first I wouldn�t mind knowing just how you have managed to find us, with such a vast expanse of land all around?�\n\n* She waited for Felines�s answer, wondering just what this fembot�s story was�and if it was believable.\nWith this war going on there was no telling just what the enemy would pull to get the advantage, even sending a spy within their own organization to eavesdrop and so on. But it was a clever trick, one that was clever enough to be considered.\nSo, Iron Raptor waited to hear just what Feline had to say�and whether or not it was necessary to press her splatter gun to her forehead or not. *\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
