As he aproaches he can see\nthe smokey ruins of what was either a battle, or a crashed ship. He lands,\ndust and ash spewing around his feet from the impact. He walks forward and\ninspects the wreckage. It was a ship no doubt, and it had been totally\nripped open from explosions and grinding against the earth as it came to a\nstop. He peels away a strip of metal, it looked a lot like an Autobot\nshuttle, he thought to himself, hoping it wasnt the case. But as he opened\nthe flap of metal he was holding, it revealed the red symbol of his hated\nenemies. His face changed from a grimace, to a snarl, as he clenched his\nfingers into the metal sheet with the Autobot symbol on it, and then pulled\nhis arms apart, tearing the metal in fury. He moved int the shuttle for a\ncloser inspection.\n\n\n\n"}}
