The captain set up some\ncrates as chairs and one as a table.\n\n&quot;Ok, here&#39;s the situation.  I think we can safely assume that our\nrepair bot friend is long gone since he hasn&#39;t showed his face in\nquite a while.  Here&#39;s the crew roster as it stands now:\n\nMe\nTigon\nBetaspiel\n\nWe have 4 healthy prisoners, 2 are too dangerous to be let out, 2 can\nbe used for labor, right?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, I am certain that the two you are referring to absolutely \ncannot be released, for any reason.  But actually we have about 14\nincarcerated.  I have confirmed 3 of those dead, and 5 of those\nmissing.  The rest are in stasis.  Continue&quot;\n\n&quot;Right, we have 5 crewmen in stasis, 3 confirmed dead.  That leaves 13\nmissing.  But that&#39;s not important now.  We need to focus our repair\nwork, also it would be a good idea to get some more information about\nthe area around the ship.\n\nI know it&#39;s been easy to just spend all our time doing our own thing,\nbut I think its time we act like a crew again.\n\nAny questions? ideas?  anything?!?!?!&quot;\n\nTigon and Betaspeil shook their heads.\n\n&quot;Ok, lets start by repairing the bridge.  I know we don&#39;t&#39; have a lot\nof technical skills amongst the three of us, but these repairs are\nlong overdue.\n\nDismissed&quot;\n\n\nOn Mon, 14 Feb 2005 23:04:55 -0800, rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The warden paced back and forth....  one of the prisoners came to the\n&gt; front of his cell, but quickly realized that they wouldnt&#39; get\n&gt; anywhere through annoying the warden, the warden threatened to\n&gt; severely damage anyone trying to annoy him.\n&gt; \n&gt; *beep* &quot;Tigon, this is the captain, please take the intercom link in\n&gt; your office.&quot; *click*\n&gt; \n&gt; Tigon (the warden) walked back into his office, that he barely fit\n&gt; into and sat down in his especially large chair.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; replied Tigon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We haven&#39;t had a meeting in a while, lets get together at 19:00... ok?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok...... is that all?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;....We think we have found a trace of that pesky theif that helped us\n&gt; out a stellar cycle ago.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll talk about it at the meeting... make sure your jail is\n&gt; secure when you leave&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When have I not done my job?&quot; he said with a chuckle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, you have a point there....
