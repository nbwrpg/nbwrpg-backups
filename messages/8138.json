He shakes his head, blinking \nand looking at her as she turns back around. His eyes widen as he hears her \nsay &#39;lead them out&#39;, realizing she didn&#39;t mean herself too. His eyesbrow \nraises at the words &#39;her Maximals&#39;.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says after a few seconds, &quot;You have to come with us.

He glances down at his scanner, his \neyes widening as he sees that there were now dozens of Maximals running \naround, all with the same four signatures. He nearly yells out in rage, \ncontinuing toward the torture chambers as he hears a message on his comm, a \nmessage on a Maximal frequency.\n\n&quot;Computer, track transmission.&quot;\n\nHe looks down at the results on the scanner. He had that dang Maximal now.....\n\nReptilica continues toward the torture chambers.\n\n"}}
