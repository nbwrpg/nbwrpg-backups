Lord Elder, This is Rat Trap, Wheels was comm=\r\nn&#39; out with the others, but Rodimus told &#39;em ta go, he did, but he just tur=\r\nned around and now he&#39;s gon&#39; back in for Rodimus! I dunno if he&#39;s gonna be =\r\nable ta come out in one piece!&quot;\n\nLord Elder&#39;s voice came back on the same c=\r\nhannel, &quot;What?!?&quot; Elder\npaused, obviously taking a moment to digest what ha=\r\nd been sent to him\nin a few short words. &quot;Rodimus told him to go back? Wher=\r\ne is Rodimus\nnow, and where is Tuscon?&quot;\n\n&quot;Tuscon?&quot; Elder said, trying to co=\r\nntact Tuscon directly, although Rat\nTrap could probably hear it as well, &quot;W=\r\nhat is your situation?&quot;\n\n&gt; Inside, Tucson&#39;s many wheels turn rapidly as he =\r\ntries to reach Rodimus. Because of his failure two years past, he tries to =\r\nredeem himself by actually succeeding in bringing out his comrade alive. He=\r\n knew the attempt could endanger his life as well, but by Primus he had to =\r\ntry. He sounds his horn three more times, hoping that Rodimus would hear hi=\r\nm.\n\nTuscon is quickly able to reach the wall of debris that stood between\nh=\r\nim and Rodimus. The wall looked to be quite thick and impenetrable,\nhowever=\r\n not as impenetrable as it had before Tuscon had left the first\ntime.\n\nDirt=\r\n and stone and even bits of plant matter still filled the\nentrance, but it =\r\nis obvious that the previous explosion had weakened\nthe slide of debris in =\r\nseveral places. The smell of sulfur was in the\nair, obviously coming from t=\r\nhe other side of the slide.\n\n(TAG)\n\nMeanwhile . . .\n\nWho: CYCLONUS, Hydras\n=\r\nLocation: Black Fortress - Throne Room\n\nThe door to the throne room was flu=\r\nng open, and there standing in the\ndoorway was the dirty and dented form of=\r\n Cyclonus. He was covered from\nnearly head to toe in dirt, soil and other b=\r\nits of immediately\nunidentifiable matter.\n\n&quot;Hydras!&quot; Cyclonus said as he sp=\r\notted his commander and sprang into\nthe room. &quot;What has happened?&quot; Cyclonus=\r\n attempted to grab his scanner\nand then realized that he had lost it somewh=\r\nere. He glanced around for\na moment and then grabbed one from near the thro=\r\nne and began running\nover Hydras, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
