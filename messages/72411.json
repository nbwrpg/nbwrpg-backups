I hope we can merge our forces even\n&gt; further.  It&#39;s exactly what our faction needs, unity.  With that we can\n&gt; combat those who threaten to oppose and oppress the innocent. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns back to Big Convoy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Anything you can tell me about Magmatron will gladly be appreciated.\n&gt; Hmm..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He had not told Big Convoy that he had spent most of his time living as a\n&gt; visually impaired Autobot. But a bit of visual impairment did not scare him,\n&gt; he was used to it.  It&#39;s not long before the room goes black on him once\n&gt; again.  But instead of panic, he straightens up, and cocks his ears to the\n&gt; direction of the cell entrance.  Footsteps.  They were very far off but he\n&gt; could hear them with surprising clarity, and for once was happy to have his\n&gt; sense of hearing returned.  Along with that his sense of touch and taste\n&gt; were also enhanced as he uses his nostrils to feel the rise of temperatures\n&gt; in the room,\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ah, that was part of my problem.  I am not used to working with vision,\n&gt; I&#39;ve lived with blindness most of my life and have learned to adapt.  That\n&gt; is who I am and trying to change that has left a bit of a void.  But now I\n&gt; understand, through darkness there is light, even though my eyes were never\n&gt; meant to see it.  I can do this, I can fight Rodimus and no matter how well\n&gt; he was trained, one can never see the way a sightless warrior can.  He may\n&gt; be trained but he has never lost his sight.  I have and I have learned to\n&gt; compensate for it&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from BIG CONVOY as the lights in his room flicker once\nand then dim down to near darkness. &quot;It is the night cycle.&quot; He siad\ndryly, his optics glowing in the new darkness of the room. &quot;For most\nit is the time to recharge the power cells.&quot;\n\nCONVOY gestured to the dual rehcaing chambers. &quot;You can stay in this\ncell with me.&quot; He said. &quot;The others already have their bunk mates.&quot;\n\nTurning back to TUSCON, &quot;As for Magmatron.&quot; There was a small shrug.\n&quot;He is a Predacon warlord, some even say that he was part of the\nDecepticon wars that came before. Extemely dangerous and never to be\nunderestimated.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was sent to planet Gaea to capture him, he and his chief scientist\nSaberback have been interested in Unicron for centuries. BIG CONVOY\ngrunted, &quot;He has been  stealing his energon and using whatever\nequipment was left behind after his attacks on various worlds.&quot;\n\nCONVOY loked at TUSCON, &quot;He had ammassed quite a bit on Gaea, and my\nteam and I were only just able to defeat him.&quot; He grunted again, &quot;And\nwe were captured ourselves, and we were working to free ourselves when\nyou showed up.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
