The three humanoid ones\nbegin to speak in complete unison &quot;Unit Reflector and Ratbat returning&quot;\nthey anounce. At that a large building emerges from underground and\nopens up. The four fly into it. Reflector&#39;s parts land, and Ratbat\nperches on the middle ones shoulder. Then lights begin to iluminate, and\na small table is visible, with three ancient robots surrounding it. &quot;Was\nyour mission a success?&quot; One of the old forms says, not wasting any\ntime. Reflector nods, then the three parts transform into a camera\nagain, hooking up to a machine on the wall. Ratbat then transforms into\na cassette and enters the Machine. The scren begins to illuminate with\npictures of the meeting that had just happened between the Autobots,\nthen slowly sound is added. The three robots look on with interest.\n\n"}}
