She had thought that he was going to be a little irate, a Predacon \ncommenting an Alliance bot and all. Most would just say that it wasn�t \nright.\nAs he responded to the end of her last comment she just couldn�t help but \nthink just what other things he would be�best at. Shaking her head at her \nown thoughts.\nBrightBlade noticed the way that Perndabot looked her over, his eyes playing \nover the curves of her body. She couldn�t help but be a bit proud that she \nwas worth looking at in that way, never thinking before that she was even a \nbit pretty except for Gangon�s comments.\nJust then she wondered where he was again, though the thought passing \nquickly as she heard Perndabot speak again.\nShe was just about to reply when Reptilica suddenly spoke towards Perndabot, \nthen she simply watched as a small scene spread out in front of her.\nBrightBlade smiles as she then sees all three other of the Alliance bots \nbacking away from Perndabot and his tone, actually fairly impressed by the \nbots show of power. She always did like a man who put his power to good use, \nintimidating others was just part of the things that she liked.\nWith her optics still on the retreating three she then heard Perndabot�s \nattention return to her, his tone now in it�s calmer state.\nShe was still recovering a bit from the sheer show of power, Perndabot \nseeming even more handsome to her now, even a bit�desirable. But that also \nwhat happened�when a male showed off in front of a woman sometimes.\nBrightBlade then simply recovered from the experience and then looked back \nto Perndabot, a smile towards him playing on her lips again. With out \nputting much thought into it she then moved, EVERY curve on her body now \nable to be viewed if one was now to look. If Perndabot could show off what \nhe had�then so could she.\nShe nodded and then continued with her answer, Reptilica interrupting her \nfirst attempt to do so. *\n\n� Correct. I was just simply passing through on my way towards the new \nMaximal battle ship, the Cybertronien Fire. I have�work to be done there. \nBut nothing against the Alliance, besides the fact that they get all the \nhandsome bots and we get all the retards!�\n\n* Personally that was what she thought, none of the Predacon males even \nseeming a bit handsome to her�or even a bit worth looking at. Besides a few, \nsome in which she preferred not to talk about.\nBut there was a fair number of well looking males in the Alliance, some in \nwhich she had noticed in her last battle with them. Though she couldn�t help \nbut notice, it was just her. *\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
