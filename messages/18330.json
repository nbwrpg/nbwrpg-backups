She \nkept running. Her trainer program was still in charge. She turned her \nhead and shot a wide optic lazar shot at Firearm, missing him by a \nfew feet. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be hacked into. Leave me alone.&quot;\n\nShe opened up her comlink. &quot;MASTER PREBON! HELP! THE MAXIMALS ARE \nTRYING TO KILL ME!&quot;\n\nShe stopped and turned, facing Firearm and fired her optic lazars \nagain at him.  But she still misses him by a few feet.  Her maximal \nprogram wouldn&#39;t allow her to hurt another maximal.  But her trainer \nprogram still tried.  She fired again, missing him. She cursed under \nher breath, turned and kept running.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Uh, Spears and co. were still at the Ark, wern&#39;t they?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm growls as Spears runs off, hearing her yell.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; he says to Lunarpine, taking off and flying at Spears, \nhis \n&gt; jetpack pushing him forward as he slowly gainst on her.
