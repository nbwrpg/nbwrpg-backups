He released his claws and crossed \nthem as he stepped in front of Ramulus. The claws formed an energy \nshield that destroyed two of the missles on impact. A third missle \nknocked him off balance and the fourth continued toward Ramulus. \n\n&quot;Come back here you cowards.&quot; he yelled at the top of his breath, \ntrying to goat them back into battle. Lunarpine knew he had more \ntricks to try, he was actually pleased with the fact he may be able \nto try them yet.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (No KSL, that was the thing.

He \n&gt; stopped to see the Lavacons firing on Hell Beast, Gremlin and \n&gt; Waspinator. He yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NO! Stop firing immdiatly! That&#39;s an order!

It&#39;s not going to make him \none \n&gt; of us, but it&#39;s in his spark. It will make him go mad with anger \nand \n&gt; things, maybe attack the Maximals. It&#39;ll be great. And don&#39;t think \n&gt; that we are done with the Maximals yet.
