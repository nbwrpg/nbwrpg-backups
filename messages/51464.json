He didn&#39;t marvel for long at this, though, as \nthe three plasma shots came at him. He dodged one, barely, but not the \nsecond and third. One of his two missile racks was destroyed by the \nattack, and he was spun to the ground. He sttod up and fired in \nWolfenstein&#39;s legs with his pulse lasers.\n\nElsewhere, Proto had successfully taken grip of Tyrael&#39;s arm and was \nmauling it. Tyrael, however, did not consider this a tragedy. He \nturned off the two turrets from Megastorm and directed them at any \nenemy, basically Inferno and Quickstrike.\n\nTyrael: Megastorm? Is that you?! Haha! You have changed! As for what \nto do... FIGHT FOR THE CAUSE&#39;S SAKE! FIGHT THEM ALL OFF!\n\nHe swiftly took a light shard and cut his own arm just above where \nProto was. The bleeding consisted of a massive surge of energon and \nenergy. It would at the very least fry some of Proto&#39;s liquid \ncircuits.\n\nTyrael: ONWARD, TRIPREDACUS! OFFER NO PITY TO THE ENEMIES!\n\nHe fired four small blasts at Proto.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Airshadow Nightstar&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ????::\n&gt; \n&gt; The dragon femme moved close to Tyrael with the purpose of cover his \nback. \n&gt; When she took her position she aimed and opened fire against \nSkullentron.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Tyrael/Wolfenstein\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 03 Sep 2002 22:19:29 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tyrael managed to take flight and thus avoiding some of the major\n&gt; &gt;shots. Seeing another shot coming from a large tank that had just\n&gt; &gt;arrived, he rises higher and avoids the large blast that could have\n&gt; &gt;blown him down. The smaller shots however did get to him, and his \nleg\n&gt; &gt;was getting weak. He wouldn&#39;t be able to use that talon for some\n&gt; &gt;times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He saw that Skulletron was trying to coordinate with Wolfenstein, \nand\n&gt; &gt;the tank&#39;s arrival made things more complicated. A plan formed in \nhis\n&gt; &gt;head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He directed two turrets to concentrate fire on the new bot and \nfollow\n&gt; &gt;it. They both unleashed a hellfire of laser beams at him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tyrael: Khan Vlad! Forward and do not stop! We drive them back now!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vlad: Are you certain, Major?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Clanner looked around. The brunt of the enemy opposition was\n&gt; &gt;situated on a northeastern frontline from the base. Inferno and\n&gt; &gt;Quickstrike were near, but the base defenses could handle the pair.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vlad: I see... (He turned to Inferno) I withdraw my claim on you as \nmy\n&gt; &gt;opponent. Forward Tyrael!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;He turned to Wolfenstein, transformed then used his medium laser on\n&gt; &gt;the hairy bot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;At the same moment, Tyrael let go another volley of needles on\n&gt; &gt;Skulletron, dived down and slashed twice at him with his \nrazor-sharp\n&gt; &gt;feathers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skulletron nods, then he points to Tyrael.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skulletron:  That&#39;s the bot in charge of the Tripreds.  I need \nyou\n&gt; &gt;to go and take his attention, but try not to get hurt.  And please,\n&gt; &gt;try to resist aggression, or else this will be harder for me.
