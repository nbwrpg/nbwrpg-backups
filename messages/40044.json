He held up his hand and \n&gt; scanned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it for an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy signature only to find nothing had happened to him. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanns did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reveal one oddity though. A thin layer of berries, sap, and \nmud \n&gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his fingers. The wall paintings were wet like they were drawn \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hour ago\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of  years past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mutant exited the cave ansd scanned the world. two pods \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; far\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away.
