BTW, Kyle, I don&#39;t really mind.  I&#39;m a\n&gt; mod myself in an \n&gt; RPG where it&#39;s considered perfectly acceptable to RP\n&gt; someone else&#39;s \n&gt; character for an entire conversation.  (Mostly to\n&gt; speed things up and \n&gt; point the story in the right direction so that it\n&gt; stays interesting.)\n&gt; \n&gt; As they unload the equipment (mostly an assorted\n&gt; selection of things \n&gt; Gatara figures they may run low on; the Rogues\n&gt; already have what they \n&gt; need, more or less), Phoenix&#39;s wandering eyes find\n&gt; Flicker.  Now \n&gt; she&#39;s REALLY confused, because she feels like she\n&gt; should remember \n&gt; him, even though she doesn&#39;t.  (For those not\n&gt; well-versed in \n&gt; psychology, this is a case of semantic memory -\n&gt; emotional attachments \n&gt; - versus the regular, event-based recollections in\n&gt; memory engrams, \n&gt; which Phoenix has lost.)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot;\n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Why would we get mad?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart\n&gt; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Then let&#39;s just say it takes 2 loads so as\n&gt; not to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get the council mad.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:  Flicker gets back, loads up under Gatara&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supervision (don&#39;t complain, you wanted to speed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things up) and heads back.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
