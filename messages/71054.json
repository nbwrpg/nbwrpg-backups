He was glad to have the company of Talon, Kup and=\r\n Windlord, and knew that if anyone could help him not circumb to his weakne=\r\nss, they could.  He knew it well.  It was his short temper.  Yet, he did no=\r\nt know how he would react upon finding out who the intruder was who had sab=\r\notaged the Ark, putting everyone he cared about in grave danger.  He was st=\r\nill angry inside.  To him it was a desicration of sacred ground and to dish=\r\nonor Primus as the intruder had done, was an unspeakable act in Tucson&#39;s di=\r\nrectory.  He knew he would not spare the enemy any mercy.  Yet he did not w=\r\nant to come across as another Galvatron.  He thinks things through while on=\r\n the way back to the Ark.  How to get his point across without stooping to =\r\nthe level of a Decepticon leader?\n\n&quot;Thank you for your company, Kup, everyo=\r\nne. I do appreciate your concern.&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot; I sense an intruder has do=\r\nne an unspeakable act at the Ark.  Taken it as if sacred ground was theirs =\r\nto take.  Words can&#39;t describe how infurating that is to me.  The Ark is ou=\r\nr home, our refuge, and to corrupt the Ark as it is being corrupted is an a=\r\nct against Primus himself.  I have to see that this intruder is dealt with =\r\nappropriately, yet to me they deserve no mercy.  I know that if I let my te=\r\nmper get the best of me, I&#39;ll do something I&#39;ll regret.  I will be no bette=\r\nr than Galvatron himself, in his days.  I do not wish to become as such.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRat Trap monitors Tucson&#39;s energy levels from inside the cab.  He then look=\r\ns to Talon and Straight Shot.\n\n&quot; So far, okay.  Not wonderful, but he&#39;ll ma=\r\nke it home.  Anyway, I&#39;d like nothn&#39; more than ta see that intruder get wha=\r\nt&#39;s comm&#39;n ta him. &quot;\n\nStraight Shot interjects.\n\n&quot;Yes, but at the same time=\r\n, he doesn&#39;t wanna stoop to Galvatrons&#39; level.  It&#39;s a complicated situatio=\r\nn Rat Trap.  We all know what happens when Tucson loses his temper, at leas=\r\nt, Night Shift and I know.  We&#39;ve seen it happen.&quot;\n\nNight Shift drives up w=\r\nith Kup.\n\n&quot;Ohh yeah, believe us Rat Trap, the big guy here, he&#39;s capable of=\r\n don&#39; a lotta damage. And I dunno if he wants ta do that this time.&quot;\n\nRat T=\r\nrap nodds.\n\n&quot;Hmm, good point, wouldn&#39;t make anyone look good would it?&quot;\n\nTu=\r\ncson replies.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m afraid not Rat Trap.  This time, I know I&#39;ll need Rodim=\r\nus&#39;s imput on how to deal with the intruder.  It&#39;s the best way to come to =\r\na resolve.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; I like that idea.  I like it alot.  Th=\r\nat&#39;s what being an Autobot is all about.  Consult with each other, and find=\r\n the best possible way to deal with a situation without stooping to the lev=\r\nel of a Decepticon leader.&quot;\n\nTucson continues.\n\n&quot;Yes. But I also would like=\r\n the imput of everyone else as well.  As soon as we regain control of the A=\r\nrk, and have the enemy immobilized, we should hold a meeting and see what k=\r\nind of suggestions everyone has.  Perhaps we can merge ideas and deal with =\r\nthis enemy in an apropriate manner.&quot;\n\nHe makes another contact to Rodimus.\n=\r\n\n&quot; Rodimus, as soon as we can regain control of the Ark, and the enemy is s=\r\nubdued, I&#39;d like everyone to meet in the control room, so we can figure out=\r\n how to deal with the intruder in an apropriate manner.  I&#39;d like everyone&#39;=\r\ns imput as how to go about it.  After all, he just didn&#39;t anger me, he ange=\r\nred and endangered everyone. &quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Ni=\r\nghtstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita/Perceptor/Kup/windlord\n&gt; \n&gt; Elita =\r\nkept her eyes and ears  sensing around her, she must protect Lord \n&gt; Elder =\r\nnow and whoever were close would hurt him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************************=\r\n*******\n&gt; \n&gt; Percepro Ran towards Rodimus and soon he reach him &quot;Nothing ye=\r\nt&quot;said coldy \n&gt; while he tried to sense something\n&gt; \n&gt; ********************=\r\n************\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup and windlord wacthed each other and said &quot;We will kee=\r\np an eye on you \n&gt; Tucson&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: Sandy\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Wednesday, February 23, 2011 12:33 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n Subject: Re: Back to the Ark!\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the Ark, Quickstride looks at Up=\r\nroar with a not so pleased look on \n&gt; his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ya know, maybe we sh=\r\nould never have gone with that idea of yours.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Uproar gives a sheepish=\r\n grin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yep, my bad.

He was not about to =\r\nlet anyone down a second \n&gt; time, and certainly not willing to give up to a=\r\nny of the minions, or \n&gt; Hydras&#39;s low life commandoes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Talon, I deepl=\r\ny appreciate your concern, and take it greatly into heart. \n&gt; But, I&#39;ve fai=\r\nled our factions once before, I can not and will not let that \n&gt; happen aga=\r\nin.  I have to do this, to stop history from repeating itself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Night =\r\nShift could tell Tucson was getting ready to put it into battle gear.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Look, big guy, Talon&#39;s right, you&#39;re in no condition ta put up a fight. \n&gt;=\r\n You&#39;re just gonna get yourself even more damaged than ya already are.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They&#39;re right Wheels, you can&#39;t just throw yourself=\r\n out there at sixty \n&gt; percent power ratio.

No one expects you to alwa=\r\nys save the day, Tucson.  You&#39;ve \n&gt; stretched yourself over your limits far=\r\n too many times, and it&#39;s time you \n&gt; gave yourself time to recharge.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Tucson sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; There isn&#39;t any time for that Straight Shot.  For eve=\r\nry moment I take to \n&gt; recharge, more destruction is inflicted.

Especiall=\r\ny Rat Trap.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good choice.  So, what next Wheels?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson replies =\r\nas he warms up his engine to continue on his own wheels.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It seems th=\r\nat whoever has taken control of the Ark, has tampered with it&#39;s \n&gt; configur=\r\nation, via the mainframe.  There is only one thing that could \n&gt; possibly i=\r\nnterrupt that.  My sonar system.  It has the ability to disrupt \n&gt; most ali=\r\nen programming, and perhaps with enough of a disruption, we may - \n&gt; just b=\r\ne able to gain control of it again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat Trap grins.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heeeeey, th=\r\nat&#39;s right, that&#39;ll create a weankess in the programming and \n&gt; that&#39;s when=\r\n we can take advantage of reclaiming the configurations.  Better \n&gt; get bac=\r\nk ta Rodimus and the others about that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson acknolwedges and conta=\r\ncts Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tucson Prime to Rodimus Prime, over.  As soon as I am cl=\r\nose enough to the \n&gt; ark, I am going to attempt a short range sonar disrupt=\r\nion intercept of the \n&gt; Ark&#39;s systems.  Hopefully this will cause enough of=\r\n a falter, for us to \n&gt; regain control of the system via an interruption of=\r\n frequencies.  Tell - \n&gt; Legacy to be ready to intercept the mainframe on m=\r\ny mark.  Tucson Prime \n&gt; out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot smiles.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now that&#39;s =\r\nthe Tucson Prime I know.  Resourceful yet sensible.

Quickly \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; very paint that was on the =\r\nwall where the intruder had once stood began to\n&gt; &gt; turn a decidedly darker=\r\n color and even chip a little from the wall in \n&gt; &gt; spots.\n&gt; &gt; However ther=\r\ne was no other response from the intruder, or the area that he\n&gt; &gt; once sto=\r\nod.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Perhaps the *cough* intruder left through the *cough* door whe=\r\nn it opened\n&gt; &gt; and closed *cough*&quot; Wing Caliber said as he choked on the n=\r\noxious fumes \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; was beginning to fill the room.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortun=\r\nately this room, unlike the last time when Quickstride let loose\n&gt; &gt; with t=\r\nhis outside, was enclosed there was no where for the gas cloud to \n&gt; &gt; go.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; And much as Wing Caliber had surmised, the cloud kept expanding to quic=\r\nkly\n&gt; &gt; cover the entire chamber.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Leo&#39;s optics narrowed as he looke=\r\nd at Quickstride, obviously he was not \n&gt; &gt; too\n&gt; &gt; happy with this turn of=\r\n events, especially because his sense of smell was\n&gt; &gt; unusually keen.
