My first postie \n&gt; here, just \n&gt; &gt; lemme know if I screw anything up in here, and I&#39;ll be more than \n&gt; glad to \n&gt; &gt; change it! ^_^ \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC: A wolf howled, joined by several others in a chorus. After \nthat, \n&gt; it was \n&gt; &gt; silence...or as silent as a forest could get. One of the pack \n&gt; members, one \n&gt; &gt; that had strayed from the others, moved towards the opening of a \n&gt; small cave. \n&gt; &gt; Caution written in every movement, it sniffed carefully at an \nitem \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t have been there...a status pod. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A bright light emerged, scanning for a beast form. As the wolf \nwas \n&gt; scanned, \n&gt; &gt; it yelped and jumped away. Away from that and the strange, \n&gt; computer-ish \n&gt; &gt; voice. &quot;Error...error..&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The pod opened as the wolf backed farther from it, ears back and \n&gt; growling. A \n&gt; &gt; small wolf emerged, eyes blue as crystal. Her fur matched that of \n&gt; the wolf \n&gt; &gt; before her, many shades of grey blended together into one coat. \nThe \n&gt; wolf \n&gt; &gt; before her looked curious, moving a bit closer and sniffing \n&gt; again...but this \n&gt; &gt; other wolf didn&#39;t quite smell right. Still, this wolf was better \n&gt; than no \n&gt; &gt; company at all. Not to mention this territory was his, and if \nthis \n&gt; female \n&gt; &gt; wished to stay, she would be a part of HIS pack. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She turned to him, eyes narrowed. Wings opened...bat wings. She \n&gt; snarled, \n&gt; &gt; revealing fangs longer than the other wolf have seen before. The \n&gt; wolf backed \n&gt; &gt; away again, tail low...then turned and ran. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bat-wolf smirked, wings settling against her back. The other \n&gt; side was \n&gt; &gt; covered in fur as well, making them nearly invisable to the eye. \n&gt; Looking back \n&gt; &gt; and forth, trying to make sense of where exactly she was...and \nwho \n&gt; exactly. \n&gt; &gt; Her name she remembered...but...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Mistra...&quot; she said softly aloud, confirming with herself. Yes, \n&gt; that was her \n&gt; &gt; name. She remembered that much. But...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Predicons...Maximals...which side was she on...?\n\n\n"}}
