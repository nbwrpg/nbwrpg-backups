We can not succeed on\n&gt; what little we have.  Quickstride is the key to providing us with the\n&gt; resources we need to carry out a successful mission.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON was talking LEO PRIME was looking down at something that\nAIRHAMMER, who had just came in as TUSCON and his team were returning,\nhad handed to him.\n\nGlancing back up at TUSCON, LEO PRIME nodded, &quot;Agreed. Energy is\nsomething that we will all need. Begin at once.&quot;\n\nHe glanced back down at the Padd and continued speaking, &quot;Airhammer\njust gave me a quick report on his mission to pick up Nighshift.&quot; LEO\nlooked back up at TUSCON, &quot;Any word on Cheetor who is still missing?&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME glanced over at the green bot with the Predacon signature\nand then back at TUSCON, &quot;And this bot here tells me that some\ncriminals may have escaped from that ship that fell from the sky. Part\nof Airhammer&#39;s report shows an individual floating above a massive\nheard of Dinosaurs of all types.&quot;\n\nLowering the Padd, LEO&#39;s face took on a stern cast, &quot;We may have more\nto deal with then the Unicronians, the Predacons and leaving this\nworld untouched.&quot; He puased, looked at his padd, the green robot and\nthen back at TUSCON, &quot;There are criminals that will have to be\nrecovered.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
