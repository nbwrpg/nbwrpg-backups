What, she would probably \nnever know.\n\nThe Fuzor listened to what Carnage had to say, and nodded to herself. \nShe, Teltoli, had never been good at words, but that was more or less \nwhat her purpouses were.. she guessed. \n\n&quot;Night, Carnage.. and.. Thanks&quot; She grinned, and closed her eyes, \nletting out a big breath. Tomorrow was going to be a big day, so she \nmay as well get a good nights sleep!\n\nHowever, try as she might, the noises of the forest kept her awake. \nShe put her paws over her ears, but that resulted in a very \nuncomfortable position. She groaned quietly and turned over on her \nside, and shut her ears. A small smile crept across her face, looking \nthe picture of innocence in her sleep.\n\n\n"}}
