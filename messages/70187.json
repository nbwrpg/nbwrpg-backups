She started to feel tired, unexplained \n&gt;&gt; tired,\n&gt;&gt; as if she handt slept in several days. she had to hold a piper in order \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; avoid fell but he couldnt be stand up for so long. A chorus of voices \n&gt;&gt; arouse\n&gt;&gt; in her head while her vision became blurry. She couldnt fight that \n&gt;&gt; feeling\n&gt;&gt; for so long.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup emerged from a corritor holding his dart gun looking to Nightlight \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; later to Rodimus said in low voice &quot;Forgive me... i beg your fogiveness \n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; i cant let her escape... Time is short... She will sleep a while... we \n&gt;&gt; can\n&gt;&gt; reprogram her... and then she will understand all... &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodiums looked as the woman he loved slumped over. He reached down and\n&gt; grabbed her before she hit the ground, and gently lifted her in his\n&gt; arms, the movement seemingly effortless as he looked over at Kup.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noting the weapon Kup had was not a blaster but a stun gun, and\n&gt; remembering the strange way Nightlight had acted he though that this\n&gt; might had been the best way. But he couldn&#39;t help but feel a stab of\n&gt; anger as he glanced down at Nightlight as she lay unconscious in his\n&gt; arms.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Kup took left to help Tuscon, Rodimus followed as it was also in\n&gt; the direction that led out of this place. Rodimus couldn&#39;t ever\n&gt; remember wanting to leave place so bad as he wanted to leave this\n&gt; black fortress of Hydras&#39;!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TBC)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
