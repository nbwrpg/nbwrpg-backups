He fired on her with his plasma \nand she caught two shots in the chest.  On post #4892.  She went into stasis \nlock on post #4895.  After that, no one noticed her so I figured that with \nwounds like that, she wouldn&#39;t have made it.\n\n------------Original Message--------\nFrom:   &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jun 28, 2000 10:45pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n(Logomorph, who killed Fidget?)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
