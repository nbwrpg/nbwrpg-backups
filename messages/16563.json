If they had been \nactivated, he would have been hurt by her apeal to Prebon. Erasing his \nmemories of her! He would rather die before let that happen.\n\nHe was still sure that Prebon wouldn&#39;t order her to self-destruct, but if he \ngave in now, he knew that the Maximals would probably never see Spears again. \nAt least not as an ally.\n\nHe stands where he was, with the same resolution, looking at Prebon.\n\n"}}
