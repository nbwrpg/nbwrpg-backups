His eyes are blue, and he wears a small \nmask over his mouth. Most of the time he hunches over, and honks \na little red horn at people. He has a small yellow flower about two \ninches squared on the left side of his chest.\n\nBob has several weapons. He has a automatic pie launcher, \ncapable of making an interesting slat in the face of any \nunsuspecting person. His small chest flower squirts acid up to 5 \nmeters. Bob frequently uses his fists to do mock battle with other \nclowns.\n\nBob is a very outgoing bot. He likes to bug and tease other bots \nthat he knows, and doesn&#39;t know. This trait has often gotten him \ninto trouble, and once it got him beat up. He was in the CR for \nthree days.\n\nThe above was an example, and a quick one at that. =P\nThat or less (without the personality section) would do nicely on \nthe page. PLEASE make your short character bio&#39;s as soon as \npossible.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2001, at 22:12, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Okay, I think I can go over and submit some stuff, but I won&#39;t be\n&gt; able to get the bios done anytime soon, sadly...\n\n\n"}}
