As you wish.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she had then looked off towards Gangon but then had not found\n&gt; him there, she looked around and then finally spotted him entering some\n&gt; strange ship. Was he leaving? Why?\n&gt; She looked at him with a bit of concern in her optics but then heard him\nsay\n&gt; good bye before the ship suddenly took off. Then...he was gone.\n&gt; BrightBlade looked towards the sky in which she had seen him disappear\ninto\n&gt; and then sighed, her almost missing him already.\n&gt; Now she was partnerless and alone, as she had been always before now. It\nwas\n&gt; a feeling that suddenly made her feel a little sad, not being able to hear\n&gt; Gangon&#39;s comment&#39;s on her looks any more and his wacky ways.\n&gt; She then turned towards the Maximal ship and look at it, the evening glow\n&gt; behind her. It felt different now being alone like this, but a feeling in\n&gt; which she would have to get used to now that her partner was gone. Just\n&gt; hoping that Gangon would keep his word and return to see her again,\n&gt; something that she looked forward too.\n&gt; BrightBlade then looked over at Hell Beast.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I await your next commend, My Lord.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving\n&gt; more each month?
