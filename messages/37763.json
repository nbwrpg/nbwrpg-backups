Set the CR chambers in the reprogramming lab to keep them in stasis lock. Take Mosquitor with you and do the same with the femm he&#39;s carrying. Once you get there, you know where to lead Mosquitor next.&quot;\n\nSince Mosquitor was already marching off toward the exit, despite having any idea where the CR chambers or the lab were, Zardus points at the back of the bug&#39;s head, making a firing motion. He then turns to Najah after recieving Composer&#39;s message.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll reprogram them and have a few extra soldiers on our side. Can you go help Composer with all the stuff he&#39;s carrying?&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Wheeljack. &quot;I need you to help prepare an Alliance bot for a mission at Maximal city. Can you disguise her as a Maximal?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Celeno:\n&gt; \n&gt; In spite of she was severe wounded  she was fightting to survive, but \n&gt; she was too weak and without cr she couldn&#39;t\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; :::Wheeljack:::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::He scans Celeno::\n&gt; &gt; Wheeljack: Hey Zardus, my bot is dying.
