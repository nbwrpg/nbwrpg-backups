I&#39;ll have lunch in no time flat for \nyou.&quot;\nShe stepped out into the stream and took out a small dagger.  After \nseveral attemps, she finally speared a fish.  She tossed, it on the \nbank and walked out of the stream. She put her blade away and looked \nabout.  she found some dry twigs and some old, dry grass.  She piled \nthem together and set some rocks around the little pile.  She took \nout her small lazar gun and zapped the pile.  It burst into flame and \nshe had her own little fire going.  She went over nad picked up the \nfish, cleaned it and pulled a slightly charred stick out of the \nfire.  She put the fish on the stick and rested it on the fire.\n&quot;See little one? I hope you like your fish wel done though.&quot;\nShe went over and picked up the rat.  It crawled up onto her shoulder \nand looked hungrily at the fish cooking. it smacked it&#39;s little lips \nand nudged her neck.\n&quot;I know, I know your hungry.  Give it a few more moments and it&#39;s \nready.  I&#39;ll let you have the best pieces, I promise.&quot; she chuckled.\n\nShe sat on the stump and looked into the fire.  She couldn&#39;t remeber \nanything before waking up in that strange lab.   She wondered why it \nwas deserted.  Was it because of a battle there? Was it because the \nbots who occupied the base left for a better one? She had many \nquestions and no answers.  She looked at the symbol on her arm and \nrecognized it.  she knew what it was and what it stood for. But \nnothing else about it.\n\n\n\n"}}
