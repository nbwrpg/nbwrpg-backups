Alliance? But that was only a slight thought, where the main \nconcern for him was whether he could get to the battle on time to get in a \nbit of the action.\nThough, his thoughts were partly urging him to go on ahead towards the \nbattle another, more deeper set part of his mind, made him remain by \nTavtron�s side as she let out the first line which was to lead to the whole \ntelling of her reason for abandonment. Where he belonged for now.\nAnd he had to admit; Tavatron�s first sentence was an attention grabber.\nDinobot glanced towards the steady pacing fembot, wondering just what \nhorrors must play in her mind from recalling her past. And it must be fairly \npainful�that he could extract from the single vocal line which had flowed \nfrom her throat.\nThough, a horrific tale to once could seem as nothing more then everyday \nspeech to another.\nAnd Dinobot had almost heard it all.\nMutilation, rape, decapitation, torture, abandonment, molestation�you name \nit, he had most likely heard of it or seen it. But, there were always times \nsomething new came along, and this could be one of those times. However, \nDinobot�s mind wasn�t set in just what category he could place Tavatron�s \nexplanation under, it was dwelling on what effect this telling would have on \nTavtron herself. She was his main concern.\nBut if anything, he was a listener.\nHis main scanners brought up what he knew of Beta Prime when Tavtron \nmentioned it, and it wasn�t much. Though, what she gave him as a description \nof the atmosphere there fit.\nDesert, heavily mined and protected by soldiers Tavatron mentioned, and the \noccasional family unit.\nAnd at Tavtron�s next words, mainly sought after.\nTerrorist raids.\nDinobot looked towards Tavatron then, hearing her sigh and seeing in depth \nin which her optics looked upon things, noticing that it was the depth of \none looking at memories with which they just remembered.\nAnd her shudder, which brought the thought that, whatever she was \nremembering of the details she couldn�t express with words, was deeply \nimbedded and onset of what she must have lived through.\nBut he listened what Tavatron said and took it in, turning it over in his \nhead and going over what she managed to tell him.\nIt slightly bothered him to hear that Tavatron had been at the tender age of \n5 when this had all happened, when this nightmare in her life took place.\nHowever, all of this had turned out to be nothing new to him.\nEvery transformer on this miserable planet had a story, including him. \nTavatron�s was simple to explain.\nHome raided. Population terminated. Parents died and basically left alone to \nfend for her. Living with the scars for the remainder of her life.\nAt least a bot whom was stabbed with a sword could heal and go on with their \nlife; mental wounds left from an encounter with fate and effected the \nmind�had a less likely chance to heal.\nDinobot sighed. Memories sometimes effected the way a bot live their life. \nHe was proof.\nHis mother never wants him, though his father had been proud. Father died at \n7. Mother ignored him completely. Then she remarried and had another child \nwhom she spoiled rotten. Still ignored him. Didn�t tell his half-brother \nthat they were related until he was 16. Left home and joined the Predacon \nForces at 17. Never returned except once, where he returned with his wages \nand gave them to his mother to use in hard times.\nThen, disappeared from their lives completely.\nBut Dinobot�s life had not been as traumatic as Tavatron�s, he had not seen \nthe horrors of the dead until he was well into his career as a soldier.\nThough, he could still relate to her.\nThey had both lost their parents at a young age�he had lost his father�and \nthat was the only parent he had ever known to deserve the name of one. His \nmother had been nothing but a woman he knew�and sometimes let him inside \nwhen it was cold�like some unwanted dog.\nBut both of their childhood�s were gone too early�they had known to hate \nwhen they should have been playing with their friends and learning all the \ngood things in life.\nFate seemed to deal to horrid blows on the young far too often these days.\nThough, Dinobot had not always been cold and hard like he had grown to be. \nWith too much battle and seeing too much death. Yet, he had grown to hunger \nfor it.\nBut�before all of that, he had simply been a small boy, growing alongside \nhis father.\nThough, after his death Dinobot�s sense of humor had disappeared, and since \nhis mother had mistreated him but never let him leave until he finally \nforced her too�he basically forgot how to smile�or ever care.\nOnly now, with Tavatron, had he remembered how to care again.\nDinobot glanced at Tavatron again, seeing her kick up a bit of sand and hum \na rather nice tune.\nIf only she knew just how much they had in common.\nLove for battle. Uncann7y liking to be alone and out in the open. And \nunforgivable pasts. Only, HIS past he could easily speak about, all anyone \nneed do was ask.\nBut then Dinobot listened to Tavatron�s explanation of her past friend and \nwhat grim fate he came to.\nSo THAT was the reason she had run out on him! That was the reason Tavatron \nhad left him�because she didn�t want to see if he died as well�the same way \nher friend did.\nDinobot growled deeply while looking towards the Cybertronian Fire and the \nbattle, knowing now the answer with which he had come seeking.\nBut now that everything had been answered, the battle was now what was on \nhis mind.\nIt was only now that he saw the Alliance gestalts, watching them fore \ntowards the ship�s shields in order to try and knock them offline�to get at \nthe base on the inside.\nDinobot snarled and transformed into Robot mode, not even noticing Tavatron \nconverting into beast mode and heading towards the battle.\nFrom where he stood, he was choosing his target�his scanners zooming in on \nalmost every bot until they suddenly spotted one which seemed perfect.\nSixshot.\nHis tail swinging slightly he looked around the battle firled to see if \nthere were any places where he could get the Alliance bot by surprise.\nThere were no places.\nDinobot growled, then began to move off towards the battle, his optics on \nSixshot all the time while he moved onto the field.\nThere were bots all around.\nDinobot bared his teeth and aimed towards the bot&#39;s chest-plate, locking on \ntarget and firing.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
