Plus there&#39;s less than a minute before the ship \nhits ground, and when she does she&#39;ll make a huge boom. Go tell \neveryone to get out of the way, I don&#39;t know how big this blast is \ngonna be. I&#39;m going in.&quot;\n\nStarscream entered the inferno. He stumbled blinding, trying to \nremember the way to the bridge. He found it, and could barely make \nout the form of Phobia. He grabbed him.\n\n&quot;Come on! We&#39;ve got to get out of here!&quot;\n\nHe starter walking towards the exit, with Phobia in his arms, and \nonly seconds until the ship crashes.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix buried Gekkidama in some wreckage, said a prayer to the Matirx, \nand than came back to answer Ramulus&#39; question.\n\n&quot;Internal Repairs? That can&#39;t fix a blown off arm. He needs mage \nrepairs. They might be able to slow down the mech fluid leak, but \neventually he&#39;ll join The Matrix if we don&#39;t do something fast. And I \nrefuse to use the hull we got unless it&#39;s the last result. The plate \ndid most of it, but youi&#39;re right, we&#39;ll still burn up. But if we \nsaty here, we&#39;ll probably end up like Gekkidama and kill each other. \nHave any ideas?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron was confused about what the alliance was doing, so he broke \noff from the pack and followed Zardus. When Zardus landed, a bot \nalmost shot him. Things seem to be cool now, but Gotron got all his \nweapons up and pointed them down at the bot. If this bot decided to \nattack Zardus, he was gonna get a two on one*.\n\n\n\n*Unles Desmonus is there too, than it&#39;s 3 on 1.\n\n\n\n"}}
