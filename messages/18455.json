Phobia is dead.  I...I&#39;ll \nexplain later&quot; She shook her head,and looked at him &quot;You said you \nfound a bot with Inferno?&quot;  She looked at the bot.&quot;DARKMOUSE! You \nfound DarkMouse. Go put her into a CR and then come see me.&quot;\n\n::Spears::\nWhile in stasis lock, her mind heard the message from Prebon. The \nenergy boost was enough to all but shut down the maximal program \ncompletely.  Her trainer program took her over completely.  When she \nwas taken out of stasis, she would wake up and do everything in her \npower to get out of the maximal&#39;s hands and get back to Prebon.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream arrived at Destructor&#39;s base.  He unbuckled Dark Mouse, \n&gt; ejected her into the air, went to bot mode and caught her on the \nway \n&gt; down. He walke dinto the base and found KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey KitKat. We found this bot talking with Inferno. I captured it, \n&gt; but I&#39;ve got to go back and help Drillbit fight Inferno. You do \nwhat \n&gt; you want with....hey, what&#39;s the matter? You seem upset?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; The Trainers arrived so that thye could see the CF, but could not \nbe \n&gt; picked up on scans. They were cloaked, but that only worked for \nsight \n&gt; unless you had stealth cloak. Prebon pulled out the Tamer and \nchecked \n&gt; the scan for Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Damn it! They must have taken her inside. We&#39;re too late. She&#39;s in \n&gt; stasis. But perhaps their is a way to still get ahead in this. I \ncan \n&gt; send messages and extra energy through the link that I have \n&gt; established between myself and the chips. It could help the Trainer \n&gt; program win permanantly. The Maximal chip would still be there, and \n&gt; would work again with repair, but without repair it would just be \n&gt; dormant. She would attack all those around her, and with the \n&gt; distraction we could storm this new ship of theirs. And if that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work, the moment they remove the Trainer chip, if the can \n&gt; find a way to do it without killing her, I simply give the self \n&gt; destruct order and boom! We&#39;re down a few Maximals. I&#39;ll try the \n&gt; first plan first.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prbon began communicating with the Trainer chip.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Come on Spears! You can win this! Come back to me! Defeat the \n&gt; Maximals!*\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon kept repeating this message while sending small boosts of \n&gt; energy to the chip.\n\n\n"}}
