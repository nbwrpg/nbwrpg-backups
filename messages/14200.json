Child Eagle Eye and Afterburner will \nstay here and protect the stuff, because it will tkae many trips. \nThan finaly we will bring everybody in and we will put everything \ntogether again there. Alright? Good. Windazor and Terradive, get an \narmful of junk and follow me!&quot;\n\nVulois picked up some computer boards and flew off towards his ship.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq loaded the boards into the shuttle, and than turned to \nRamulus.\n\n&quot;Load your stuff in the back, and than we have a question to discuss. \nWe only have enough room for Hull or Weapons.

He ran and ran and finaly came to the CR Chambers, where he \nsaw Kitkat in it.\n\n&quot;No....Not again. They hurt you? Those diry Bastards! If only I \nhadn&#39;t been meditating, we would&#39;ve been side by side on the front \nline, like you promised. I&#39;m so sorry!(He turned to Drillbit.) Is the \nbattle over? Did I miss it?&quot;\n\n(Some people may get mad at the way I&#39;m portraying Starscream, since \nhe&#39;s supposed to be ruthless and uncaring. Well this is the way I \nwant to. He&#39;s changed and learned alot from wandering the Universe. I \ncalled him first so all I can say is Ha Ha!)\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\n&quot;Oh! My name is Gotron. And I know yours.
