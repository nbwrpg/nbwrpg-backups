As I\nsaid in our meeting I was stationed onboard a Predacon warship when the\ntemporal wave hit. Some trader scavengers showed up planning to take\neverything they needed. I convinced them that since I was part of that ship\nit was my property. I have with me enough Predacon technology that it won&#39;t\nonly power your, um my, um the engines, it may have enough power to get you\nback to cybertron if you should choose. After of course you destroy the Iron\nFist and all it&#39;s crew.&quot;\n\nHe sees Klusters expression and knows how tempting the offer sounds. &quot;So are\nyou interested?
