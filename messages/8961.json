What I do care about is that \nthis war ends.  With no more casualties.  Both sides have suffered \nlosses, both sides have fought and lost.  This war makes little sence \nto anyone and the only real reason it keeps on going it because \nneither side can trust the other.&quot; She placed one hand on her hip.\n&quot;Both sides need to sit down and talk about a truce to all this.  \nThat&#39;s why I&#39;m even here in the first place.  I&#39;m here to try to talk \nyour commander into at least thinking about meeting with us, and the \nother Maximal and Predacon groups. To try to talk out our \ndifferences.  Try to gain an understanding of one another and put an \nend to this war.&quot; she looked down. &quot;Or all will end and no one will \nlive to regret not trying.&quot; She turned and started walking back to \nher quarters.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex raises an eyebrow at Battera&#39;s outburst.
