Tritan \nlooking down at Icedemon. them two are most likely sick of this war as us so \nwhy would they kill someone who is willing to help Isense something wrong \nwith both of them. But I still have my mission. Icedemon:that stupid mission \nwhen are you going to stop who ever sent you probaly all ready forgot. So I \ndon&#39;t care its honor and trust I will do what ever it takes. and also what \nis that thing right there on your leg.Icedemon: it my secret weapon. well it \ngives me the creeps. O yeah I have something to show you. Firestorm left us \na big present. Tritan looking back hopes he can stop Shocker from killing \nthem to hoping nothing bad will happen to them for some reason he feels \nsomething weird about them two.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
