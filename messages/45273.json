Well, when a website dies when\n&gt; the webmaster stops \n&gt; updating the website... right? What if we (RPGERs)\n&gt; do a temporary website \n&gt; for NBW... but instead exist one webmaster, we&#39;ll\n&gt; have more. Then, if \n&gt; one of webmasters can&#39;t work on the website (or\n&gt; worst: quit) for a \n&gt; while, the others can keep the site running and\n&gt; updating it. If one of \n&gt; webmasters quits,  the others webmasters chooses an\n&gt; other member and train \n&gt; him/her, and give that person the passwords and\n&gt; needed information.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the website has to be updated, the webmasters\n&gt; share the job, and \n&gt; it will go much faster, since several people are\n&gt; doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Airly\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Check out Yahoo!
