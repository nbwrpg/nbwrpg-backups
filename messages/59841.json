A major wildcard is a Maximal\nwarrior by the name of Shadowcaster who according to\nall records died defending the Ark during Megatron&#39;s\nattack using the Nemesis. He claims to be sent back\nfrom the Matrix by Primus, whic if true means he could\nwell be a good option to turn to should the weapon\nfail. On the other hand, if this is really a hoax by\nUnicron then I fear we are all in danger. Assuming he\nis the spawn of Unicron, even if we were able to foil\nhis ruse, he is as powerful as Optimal Optimus,\nhowever, much faster, and with cloaking capabilities.\nWhatever the case, it would seem that our problems are\nincreasing.&quot; \n\n --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nTyrael was grave yet again.\n\nTyrael: A file appeared.
