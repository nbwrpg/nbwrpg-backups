The reader whirred as she began\nscanning the stability mapping out the crystalis and which would be the best\nand worst spots to take a sample from. She frowned that the energon of this\nrandom stability wasn&#39;t exposed to the surface, she could have placed a det\ncharge amongst the crystals and hjad it go off when Warhead was collecting\nhis sample...raw unstable energon was a convienent cover up for removing\ncertain bots.\n\n    Smiling she  finished collecting the reading, reporting to Warhead the\nsafest crystal section to take a sample from towards the rear of the\ncluster, it would most likely mean some digging though.
