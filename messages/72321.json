He had not\n&gt; known the Maximal but thought it best to listen to him as if he were Master\n&gt; Yokitron himself.  He then transforms into robot mode, giving his trainer\n&gt; the utmost of attention.  Unlike the hot rods of the Autobot faction, he was\n&gt; and is always a bot of sheer discipline, as he was brought up vorns ago by\n&gt; the famous Autobot CMO.  Ratchet&#39;s influence shows through Tucson in\n&gt; expression, intellect and body language, even though he has no idea of his\n&gt; genetic ties to him.  So it is with great focus that Tucson looks onto his\n&gt; mentor, and a maturity that often does not come with a Prime as young as\n&gt; himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If you&#39;re concerned about ill behavior on my part, I assure you that you\n&gt; will see none of that from me.  I know how it feels to work in the shadows\n&gt; of insolence and I myself am not a fan of it.  My name is Tucson Prime.  I\n&gt; started as an Autobot, but was later upgraded to a Prime and then to a\n&gt; Maximal Prime. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a military stance and salutes Big Convoy respectfully.  His vocal\n&gt; tone nearly matching that of Ratchet&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m ready Sir.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Of course you are.&quot; BIG CONVOY said in resigned tones. He shook his\nhead as he gestured for TUSCON to follow him. &quot;This must be your first\ntrip into the pens?&quot;\n\nBehind TUSCOn the sound of the gate closing could be heard and the low\nwine of an energy field snapping into place could be just discerned to\nthose with superior hearing.\n\n&quot;You have my to learn.&quot; He said. &quot;What&#39;s a Prime doing down here? You\nseem to be too young to be a Prime.&quot; Then he shrugged, &quot;Then again\nPrime&#39;s do seem to be getting younger and younger with each passing\nvorn.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
