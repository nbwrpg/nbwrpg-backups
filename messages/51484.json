Entering the cave, she finds it \nempty, except for an artifact of some description.  It is a sphere \nabout the size of a bowling ball - and it is from this device that the \nlight comes.\n\nThe whispering voices in Empath&#39;s head grow louder as she nears this \nstrange object.  Hardly realizing what she&#39;s doing, the Seeker reaches \nout and picks up the glowing ball.  An energy surge rushes through her \nbody, and she blacks out ...\n\nWhen she awakes, the alien sphere - &quot;Soul Orb&quot;, something tells her - \nis still in her hand.  Reaching out tentatively with her mind, she \nfinds that her mental powers have multiplied upon themselves many \ntimes over, and she can sense every transformer on the planet: where \nthey are, who they work for, what they&#39;re doing.\n\nBut something else has happened: in claiming the Soul Orb, Empath has \nunwittingly awakened its companions scattered across the three \ncontinents.  A quiet, but easily noticeable call reaches out from the \ndevices and touches the minds of several of the planet&#39;s inhabitants \n...\n\nOOC: Empath&#39;s Galvapred chip has been fried by the power surge, \nallowing her old personality to surface - the one that hates Galvatron \nfor selling Skywarp&#39;s soul to Unicron in exchange for another soldier. \n (She was his girlfriend.)  Also, the bots who feel the psionic call \nof the Soul Orbs are, in no particular order: Rodimus Prime, Meteara, \nSkulletron, Phoenix, and Owlhawk.  There are three Soul Orbs total, in \nrandom locations - Empath has found one.  Everyone will, of course, be \naffected in his or her own way by these things.\n\n\n"}}
