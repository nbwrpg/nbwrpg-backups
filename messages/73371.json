He could sense something but was not sure as to =\r\nwhat he was sensing.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hmm..  Strange, with all your knowledge, you =\r\nseemed to have overlooked the presence of a fellow Maximal.  Normally as pa=\r\nrt of our team, you should have had some means of capturing a fellow comrad=\r\ne&#39;s signature and made the determination that he or she is still within clo=\r\nse proximity.  But what you&#39;re saying contradicts that.  Anyway, I will tal=\r\nk to you later, first, all of us need treatment, if we&#39;re to rejoin the for=\r\nces.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns to follow Bump to med bay as does Nightshift and Uproar=\r\n who also looks back at Legacy with cat like suspicion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ever since h=\r\ne got here, I haven&#39;t trusted that bot at all.  What if he&#39;s one of them?  =\r\nA mole?  What if everything that&#39;s happened so far, is because a shred of i=\r\nntel has been leaked out from this base? &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson pauses.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Stant=\r\non, I need you to run an activity report on all intel that has come in and =\r\nout from the Ark, during the duration of the chain of events which have hap=\r\npened so far.  There may be good reason to be suspicious.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straightsho=\r\nt looks over to the group and returns to her work at the computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; L=\r\nemme see what I can come up with, this might take a while.  I just hope Che=\r\netor, Rhinox and Optimus Primal are still in one piece.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightshift li=\r\nmps along side Bump and looks up to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Thanks for the encouragemen=\r\nt, we can use everything we got now.  Slaag, if it&#39;s true that we got a mol=\r\ne on board, we&#39;re done for.  But it looks like the big boss kinda knows who=\r\n it could be.  Check out Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail tapp&#39;n the ground=\r\n, his stiff gait, and that little snarl on the snout.  He does that when he=\r\n smells someth&#39;n that doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to keep an eye on Legacy.  Tell me if you see any su=\r\nspicious behavior on his part.  If you do, don&#39;t let him suspect that you k=\r\nnow anything.  Just play along, observe and relay back to me what you obser=\r\nve.  Then together with Leo Prime, we can decide what action may need to be=\r\n done.  I think this is long overdue. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads t=\r\no the med bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who specializes in illustration, using tra=\r\nditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts.  =\r\nGreat for any occasion!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Need a great gift idea that is original?  No=\r\n problem!

It was a look =\r\nof slight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; annoyance and the fact that Uproar could have been treated =\r\nlong before his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; symptoms got worse. Yet he keeps an even demeanor.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Legacy, i would have wanted to know about this sooner...

Well, that&#39;s over now, b=\r\nut I want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him treated now, and then you can do the same for me. I wan=\r\nt no delays and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no excuses.

By the way, be careful around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wings, he&#39;s kinda look&#39;=\r\nn like he&#39;s ready ta give someone the business.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstride ra=\r\nises his hand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I got a question.

I mean he&#39;s one of us too, we sh=\r\nould worry about him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightshift nods in agreement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Yeah what he said, and what about Cheetor, Rhinox and Optimus Primal? W=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cant leave until we find them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LEGACY turn=\r\ned to regard TUCSON and then the others, &quot;I have not\n&gt; &gt; repaired Uproar be=\r\ncause I was unaware that he was still present on the\n&gt; &gt; Ark. I was under t=\r\nhe impression that he had went with you on your\n&gt; &gt; previous mission.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There was not an ounce of fear or nervousness in LEGACY&#39;s response,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; only a cold recitation of the facts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come one.&quot; BUMP said as if=\r\n trying to cheer people up, &quot;Let&#39;s get all\n&gt; &gt; of you to the medical bay an=\r\nd get you cured.&quot; He was of course talking\n&gt; &gt; to NIGHTSHIFT, TUCSON and UP=\r\nROAR.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LORD ELDER chimed in about the missing soldiers, &quot;Yes, we ar=\r\ne still\n&gt; &gt; missing Cheetor, Rhinox and Primal.&quot; He rubbed his chin, &quot;Perha=\r\nps\n&gt; &gt; Straightshot can use the system to start scanning for Unicronian\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n signatures here on Earth. In a report I received some time ago Cheetor\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n had been captured by the Unicronians. Perhaps we can find all of them\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a nod from RODIMUS, &quot;And we will check out the t=\r\nhose humans\n&gt; &gt; and see what they can tell us and investigate that rip that=\r\n Legacy\n&gt; &gt; pointed out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
