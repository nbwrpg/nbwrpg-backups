Now the waiting \nbegan...\n\n     Just then he felt a pang in his chest. At first, he thought it \nwas a bit of Magnus reaching out again. But he was wrong. The \ngoodness inside of Prime was still trying to take hold of him.\n     Prime sat down on the ground, his black shape crouching as he \nreached inside his own mind.\n\n     In the CPU of Optimus Prime a battle was waged. Standing across \nfrom the dark and evil Optimus was the original Optimus Prime. He had \nno weapons on him, and had his hands out, as a symbol of truce.\n     &quot;We both know this isn&#39;t how you want to be,&quot; Good Prime \nsaid. &quot;Please, just let me back in, we can join the Maximals, help \nthem win the fight. Please.&quot;\n     &quot;I think you used this phrase once,&quot; Evil Prime said. &quot;&#39;One \nShall stand&#39;,&quot; Evil Prime pulled out his &#39;Big Gun&#39; and blew away Good \nPrime, there was nothing left, &quot;&#39;and One shall fall.&#39;&quot;\n     With that, Evil Prime was able to return to his own body, where \n(if you don&#39;t mind me saying) Both Rodimus and Hydra were waiting for \nhim.\n\nOOC: PS: This is just so I don&#39;t have to make more posts saying that \nhe has to still wait and all. So it takes a bit of time here, but \nit&#39;s easier for you too. You could say you get there as Prime is \nawakening. That&#39;s be cool.\n\n\n"}}
