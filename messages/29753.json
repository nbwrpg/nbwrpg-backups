He stood\nsideways looking Autofire over. Over his years he always made sure to keep\ntrack of every name that had joined his cause, but he had been inactive for\nover 300 years, and this one may have joined after that. But then, he\nremembered as Galvatron, he had heard the name. Galvatron once sent this\none to assasinate the Autobot leader. &quot;You served the Decepticon cause\nwell, when you where under Galvatrons rule, and that is very comendable&quot; he\nsaid, obviously showing his distain for Galvatron. &quot; I sensed your signal\nwas here, and came to revive you for your true destiny, as a Decepticon\nruler of this mudball&quot; he said, liying through his fusion cannon (thats\njust an expression).\n\n\n\n"}}
