He hums. He \npaints a pretty picture of a ladybug while the ship in on auto pilot. \nHE&#39;S BOARDED FROM NOWHERE! He doesn&#39;t know, though. He continues \npainting his picture, adding way too many legs and drawing an eye on \nit&#39;s back. Finally, he ultimately decides to turn it into a picture \nof Lisa Trevor. he finishes and screams in horror. He walks off to \nget away from the hideous thing and makes himself a sandwich. He gets \nchocolate mustard on his hands. He slowly turns around to wash his \nhands and bumps right into Mincer, the Subaru Forester!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Hi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Hey, you got the highest score in the crash tests!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Yeah, I know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: DANNY!\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny the guy that changes into the tarantula walks in. He sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Of all of the names in the Transformers universe.\n&gt; \n&gt; He walks up and stares at Mincer. Mincer stares back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Draw.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer draws a pretty picture of a butterfly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Nicely done. What&#39;s your name?\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: I&#39;m Mincer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: I&#39;m Danny, sad as it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: I already knew that, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: My name is Terminion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Nice! Let&#39;s dance!\n&gt; \n&gt; He dances. Terminion and Danny stare.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: No.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Dude, you obviously have blown some gaskets.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Gaskets?\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: You sssssick ffffffreak! Get off of our ship!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Why? I brought a friend so we can party! Meet my friend, \nJunk Man!\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man walks up. He knew his name was already taken by Capcom for \nMega Man 7 but he wasn&#39;t concerned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: Hey, guys! Great day we&#39;re having! I transform into a Hot \nWheels Car!\n&gt; \n&gt; They all stare.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Out of my ship, man.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: We&#39;re only looking to have fun, homes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion cringes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Oh, what? Oh, yeah.\n&gt; \n&gt; He cringes also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: SECURITY!\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: You&#39;re under arrest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: You mean you&#39;re security?\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Yes. Don&#39;t make me beat you to death with my police club.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: HAW!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Hey, you guys are so funny, let&#39;s just all party all night \nlong and forget about this!\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: No.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: We don&#39;t even know you guys, nor do we want to. Leave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: Let&#39;s DANCE!\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man and Mincer dance. They dance all over the control panel of \nthe ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: We&#39;re going down!\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: NOOOOOO! I don&#39;t want to land on Earth, it&#39;s too predictable!\n&gt; \n&gt; Their ship goes spiraling downwards. It crashes into the side of a \nvolcano. There the four shall remain in their unconscious states for \na million years or so. Except.\n&gt; \n&gt; A squirrel throws an acorn and hits Mincer in the head. He wakes up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Ow! How&#39;d that squirrel get in here?\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks at Junk Man.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: ARE YOU AWAKE!?\n&gt; \n&gt; He yelled in his ear. Junk Man is awoken and stares at Mincer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Well? Are you awake?\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: yeah. Let&#39;s party!\n&gt; \n&gt; They party. The noise wakes up Terminion and Danny.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Guys, I don&#39;t know about you, but we wanted to sleep for a \nmillion years or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Yeah, prehistoric Earth is the pits... The Pit. Heh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: Let&#39;s go have fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; The 4 leave the ship and walk along. They just walk, for no \napparent reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Let&#39;s go this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; He points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: No, let us go this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: That way.\n&gt; \n&gt; He pointed back towards the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: I vote we take Danny&#39;s way.\n&gt; \n&gt; And so they do.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Later)\n&gt; \n&gt; They are now walking through a desert.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Admit it, I was right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: No, you suck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: ADMIT IT! ADMIT IT! ADMIT IT! ADMIT IT!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: SHUT UP!\n&gt; \n&gt; An avalanche of sand buries them. oh, and wakes up a monster in a \nnearby cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: FEE FI FO FUM! I SMELL FOUR LOSERS!\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster comes lumbering out towards the 4 as they dig themselves \nout of the sand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: Hey, Bigfoot does exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster slobbers. A big thick glob of spit drips from the beast&#39;s \njaw. Oh, and it lands on Mincer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Yuck! Dude, can&#39;t you at least spit on Danny for having a \nstupid name?\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Shut up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: Hey, you guys lost?\n&gt; \n&gt; He transforms into a robot. He is stared at by 7 eyes; Junk Man had \none eye closed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Yes. Yes we are.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: Aha! I love giving directions to losers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: By losers are you referring to Danny?\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: All of you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Just tell us which way out man, how much does it cost?\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster, who was bigger than all four of the guys, stares at the \nsky.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: Hello?\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: We gotta go up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terminion: You can fly?\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: No.\n&gt; \n&gt; Danny: Excuse me, but are you stupid?\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster: Costs nothing. Follow me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster walks along slowly. The other four follow him slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mincer: Walk faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monster walks about 1/65 of a mile faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: Anybody want any of this energon?\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone raises their hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk Man: I&#39;d like some, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; They consider killing and eating Junk Man...\n\n\n"}}
