The plan sounds feasible, and since \nhe wouldn&#39;t have to do anything but watch Flicker work, it suited \nhim fine.\n\n&quot;Hmmm, I will allow you to do this... In fact, this will work well \nwith my plans to attack the Tripredacus base. Those insolent fools \nwill pay for their stupidity.&quot; Megatron smiles cruelly, &quot;We shall \nattack as soon as you get to the Maximal Base. I, however, will not \nbe carrying one of those communicators, Switchblade will.&quot; \n\nMegatron motions for Switchblade to approach and take one. He wasn&#39;t \ntaking any chances, if there was a bomb or something like that in \nthe communication device, he didn&#39;t want to be wearing \nit. &quot;Switchblade.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes Megs, you want me to wear the device as a precaution right?&quot; \nSwitchblade nods in acceptance, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll do it then.&quot; He walks \nover to Flicker, and takes one of the communication devices from \nhim, then waits for instructions on how to install it.\n\nMegatron nods approval, then turns to the rest of the Predacons \npressent, &quot;Now, the Tripredacus shall PAY. All Predacon troops move \nout to the Tripred base, but approach silently, so as to not trigger \nthe sensory array.&quot; Megatron moves his hands over a console on his \nchair.\n\nAn image of the world map that they&#39;d compiled from exploration, and \nfrom educated guessing, and Megatron put a little marker on it which \nsignified about where the Tripred base would be located.\n\n&quot;Predacons.

I intend to discuise myself as \na \n&gt; Maximal and hence get into their organization, and send you \n&gt; information on all their operations, it&#39;s that simple.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
