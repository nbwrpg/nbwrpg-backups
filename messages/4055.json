I don&#39;t think Quickstrike is happy with me as a \npartner.

But, I dont \n&gt;think\n&gt;we&#39;ll be needing it, she seems to be obedient.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He turns to see Quickstrike and Darkmouse talking. Quickstrike didnt \n&gt;seem\n&gt;thrilled. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~`\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine slowly crawled in his beast mode to talk to Gremlin. He had\n&gt;expected an attack by now, even by Megatron, but nothing had happened. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Marine, Terrorize!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: He transformed and stood a large seven feet over Gremlin, who stood a\n&gt;medium six. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Now, what do you have to report?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin ::: The shileds are still up and un touched, we have all out\n&gt;riffles and pistols charged and ready, and the cannon is still functonal.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine looked at the cannon. It was a large device where the gunner \n&gt;would\n&gt;sit in a small pod and fire the meter long cannon from safety. It was \n&gt;similar\n&gt;to an Auto-gun, only used manually. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Good. Hows radar?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin ::: All is clear.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine nodded and walked up to Pheniox and Transanulas. They had\n&gt;completed the mid section of the tower. The spider was on a scoffold \n&gt;welding\n&gt;something, while the firebird was beneath him connecting wires. They seemed\n&gt;to be getting along at the moment. Marine then went back to a small\n&gt;transportable computer. He sat at it and contacted Hell Beast. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: Commander Hell Beast, phase two is in ful swing. The tower\n&gt;will be completed on schedual.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast&#39;s face formed from a swirl of static ::: Excellent General. \n&gt;I\n&gt;knew I could count on you. But be wiry, I do antcipate an attack.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine nodded ::: I concour. Its only a matter of time.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast nodded and the static filled the screen. Marine turned off \n&gt;the\n&gt;counsol and looked towrds the entrace. He saw a Proto-human sniffing the \n&gt;air\n&gt;around the shield, and Gremlin was antagonizing him. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin ::: AH, a protohuman! Where is the rest of your disgusting \n&gt;little\n&gt;tribe?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine came over and stopped the fight. ::: Enough, Gremlin go and run \n&gt;a\n&gt;diagnostic on the cannon, Ill deal with this...thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Gremlin left the two alone. The human snarled at Marine, and Marine\n&gt;dismissed it. He watched as it ran away, and out of the cave. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~`\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set, Ominous, and Ra waited in the bridge. They needed a new plan of\n&gt;attack....and for some reason there radio signals were getting \n&gt;weaker.....:::\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
