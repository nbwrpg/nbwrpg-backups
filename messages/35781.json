The other half, the\n&gt; mechanical one, in a final fight over organic life and it&#39;s future on\n&gt; Cyberetron proved a failure for the organic bot.  In the battle they\n&gt; raged against each other.  With a qucik snap of his wrist the organic\n&gt; bot lashed his special energon whips across his arch-enemy&#39;s face,\n&gt; blinding him instantly. He remembers how the bot crazed, firing al over\n&gt; the place, and with a crazy shot it all went black for the protector of\n&gt; organic life.  The shot had put his spark into stasis lock. What had\n&gt; happened to his foe, his evil half, he did not know. Until not long ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; Axis looked to Aerotaur. &quot;All right, he&#39;s yours.  I am here if you need\n&gt; me&quot;  He then turned and noticed Windlord in some trouble.  He fired two\n&gt; missiles at the traiter McGowan while Lokk and Seekker continued to fire\n&gt; 25 shots each at the foe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lynxiz ran out after Lynxiz and spotting Stranato decides it is time for\n&gt; payback. Firing three discs set for 1 second explosion on impact at him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
