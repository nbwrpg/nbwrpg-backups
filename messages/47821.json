Using his internal compass, he \nmoves\n&gt; &gt; towards the east.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warhead: Inferno, Rage, I want you to make an aerial recon first.\n&gt; &gt; There were reports about an armed group. Do not engage before I \ntell\n&gt; &gt; you. Drillbit, Nightshade, you two stay with me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Nightshade}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade moves into a flanking position a small ways behind \nWarhead\n&gt; reamining in her beast form as they scout. Her eyes watching and \nmarking\n&gt; well their route. She honestly wondered what Megatron wanted on this \nmud\n&gt; ball of a planet, there had to be more exciting and profitable \nplaces to\n&gt; crash a stolen maximal frigate, so why here?\n&gt; \n&gt;     History wasn&#39;t her strong suit but she heard enough boasting and\n&gt; bragging to know this planet was a key one in the line of Megatron \nbut why\n&gt; this time? Something had to be here that would benefit him and if it \nwould\n&gt; benefit he, then it stood to reason she should lay her hands on it \nfirst.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Smiling as she eyed Warheads back she saw where the lines were \nbeing\n&gt; drawn, the weak were already bending over backwards for their \n&quot;leader&quot; and\n&gt; would likely make their own plays in due course. The bot had \nquestioned her\n&gt; true predicon heritage. Heh if only the tin plated fool knew, course \nhe\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t til she killed him, but he&#39;d know the truth of the matter.\n&gt; \n&gt;     She grinned, she was as devious as the rest but then she has had\n&gt; centuries to perfect it. She&#39;d dance the line and play these power \nhungry\n&gt; fools off each other, all to her gain. As it should be.\n\n\n"}}
