It was actually a welcomed development, as he\n&gt; &gt; had become quite acc=\r\nustomed to being sightless. He could hear and sense\n&gt; &gt; things with much mo=\r\nre clarity then he was able to sense with even with his\n&gt; &gt; optics. His tra=\r\nnsmitter kicks in as a sonar system once more. It had been\n&gt; &gt; programed as=\r\n such, but now, only used as a listening device. It gives him\n&gt; &gt; informati=\r\non about his surroundings and with his thermal sensory board, he\n&gt; &gt; gets a=\r\n general idea on what the room is like. Room enough for only one\n&gt; &gt; bot. I=\r\nt was hot, but being silver in color, he&#39;s able to deflect a good\n&gt; &gt; porti=\r\non of that heat away from his body. Yet, he remains placid to avoid\n&gt; &gt; ove=\r\nrheating. He knew that fighting would only make things worse for his\n&gt; &gt; sy=\r\nstems. Instead of giving a show of protest, he decides to get himself\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nn a near meditative state, relaxing his entire body so is not to cause\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nstrain on his system. He had learned quite a bit about meditation from\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNinjabot training, and found it rather beneficial when encountered in\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nimes of great stress. He could hear things outside, and realized he had\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n contact ability with Rodimus. All the while, even though he didn&#39;t show\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; signs of strategizing, he silently assembles a plan to himself as to how\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; he was going to get out of his next predicament. Phase one was already =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; place. It was time for phase two. Getting captured was not part of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; plan at first, but then in all respects he could see the advantages =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; being caught. He had close contact with Rodimus and this was a perfe=\r\nct\n&gt; &gt; opportunity to turn things around without really raising suspicions.=\r\n As\n&gt; &gt; soon as he had something in mind, he casually turns his head in Rod=\r\nimus&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; direction, following the mild sonar signal he bounces off, which=\r\n hones in\n&gt; &gt; on Rodimus without actually having any effects on anyone.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tell me Rodimus, have you ever once been appreciated for all the effo=\r\nrt\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve given to Hydras? From the sounds of things I don&#39;t think you&#39;=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; even recognized for your attributes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In Night Shift&#39;s cell,=\r\n Night Shift also uses a very meditative state, to\n&gt; &gt; avoid getting himsel=\r\nf overheated. He had learned that in tight\n&gt; &gt; situations, meditation was t=\r\nhe best medicine. After a few moments of\n&gt; &gt; meditation, he casually looks =\r\naround. The more relaxed his body was, the\n&gt; &gt; less stress he places on his=\r\n system. And the less stress he puts on his\n&gt; &gt; system, the less he felt to=\r\nrtured.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Not exactly my type of architecture but at least we&#39;re get=\r\ntn&#39; some\n&gt; &gt; energon down here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He grins to himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That=\r\n&#39;s right, the less agression we show the more frustrated our guards\n&gt; &gt; wil=\r\nl be. These guys expect us ta put up a fuss, yeah, well, I ain&#39;t gonna\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbuy inta that. And I know Tucson Prime ain&#39;t either. I just hope Kup\n&gt; &gt; ca=\r\ntches onta this&#39;n does the same... Poor guy, I don&#39;t wanna see him get\n&gt; &gt; =\r\noverheated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap spots the oncomming obj=\r\nects, and holds on\n&gt; &gt; tight to Quickstride&#39;s mane.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We got tailgat=\r\ners!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride quickens his gallop and tries to step it up. At t=\r\nhe same time,\n&gt; &gt; his stomach rumbles, as it feels as if it&#39;s getting just =\r\na bit bloated.\n&gt; &gt; He had overdosed on the bean pods, and now his system wa=\r\ns about to pay for\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Uh ohh.. Rat trap, Umm.. You - better =\r\ncover your nose.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap looks down to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m tryn&#39; ta=\r\n hold on for dear life here! Why&#39;dya want me ta do that\n&gt; &gt; for?!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nQuickstride&#39;s hooves almost appear not to touch the ground as he really\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n accelerates in his gallop.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Because in a fraction of a nanosecond=\r\n, things are NOT going to smell too\n&gt; &gt; good around here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap=\r\n does as told.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re right, that ain&#39;t such a bad idea!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNo sooner does he cover his nose, Quickstride releases a large cloud of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n noxious fumes from his tail end which aleviates his bloat, enabling him to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; pick up his pace.
