Tavatron returned Dinobot&#39;s gaze, but there was no \nanger in her optics, they were emotionless, a technique she had perfected \nmany cycles ago, and one she had vowed to never use again. She didn&#39;t like \nappearing cold and heartless as she once had been. The perfect warrior, \nattacking without hesistation, now weakened by compasion and feelings. Well, \nthat was what she had been told.\n\nTavatron watched as Dinobot drew his own fluid once again. She didn&#39;t like \nit when he hurt himself like that, though she was pretty sure it caused him \nno real pain, it still pained her to see him like this. Why was he so full \nof rage?\n\nTavatron stopped thinking about Dinobot and snapped back to reality when \nCyber Claw screeched, her own warrior instincts kicking in. Tavatron watched \nas Cyber Claw took to the air and lashed out at Dinobot, this was defenitely \nnot going well.\n\nTavatron let Cyber Claw shoulder past her, the spikes on Cyber Claw&#39;s \nshoulder almost piercing her organic skin. Tavatron instinctively sheathed \nher sword and unsheathed her staff, holding it in a fighting stance in front \nof her. Striker may not want a fight, and neither did she, but this new &#39;bot \nwas going to be a different story:\n\n&quot;Please, whoever you are, just relax. All we want to do is talk.&quot;\n\nThis situation was getting out of hand. Tavatron looked at Striker, his own \nweapons drawn. She then looked at Dinobot, her eyes pleading for him not to \ndo anything rash, thought by now even she may be unable to convince him to \ndo otherwise.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
