stuck &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back.&nbsp; Stumbling to his feet, he reached back and &lt;BR&gt;plucked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metal shards out of his back.&nbsp; The wounds healed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; immediatly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice turned with a grin across his face.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Who ever programmed me, I thank them for\n releasing &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; blow &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself up, and stood tall.&nbsp; He leered at &lt;BR&gt;Blacknightmare, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grin\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plastered on his face.&nbsp; Then without warning, a burst of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; speed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice charged the femme and buried his fist in her gut, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;
