She gave a half a smile for she \ncouldn&#39;t smile fully yet. She whispered,&quot;thank you commander.&quot;\nShe shook a lttle under the pelt. Her body was still feeling the \neffects of the energon flowing through her body.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike stared wide-eyed at Dark Mouse&#39;s body layed out on the \n&gt; table. If he had the design, he would gape his mouth. His long \n&gt; multible digits he had on his right hand were spread out. He stared \n&gt; for several moments, speechless. It was a day before when he \n&gt; remembered trying to get her to the CR room when she died on him, \nand \n&gt; now she was alive, talking to Black Arachnia. \n&gt; \n&gt; He slowly walked towards her, his face frozen in a stunned \n&gt; expression. It was almost like seeing a ghost. He stepped to Black \n&gt; Arachnia&#39;s side and swiftly turned his head towards her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ya did this?&quot; he stammered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just then, he heard Dark Mouse say in a whispering tone that she \nwas \n&gt; cold. He immediately snapped into action. &quot;Ah got uh pelt!&quot; he \n&gt; quickly said.\n&gt; \n&gt; He bolted out of the room and ran down the corridors to his \nquarters. \n&gt; He nearly slammed into the frame if he hadn&#39;t caught himself with \nhis \n&gt; multi-digited hand. He bent two long fingers against the side of \nthe \n&gt; frame as he caught himself, but he ignored the pain. He dashed over \n&gt; to his bunk, where beneath the foot of it, was the fur pelt Rowdy \n&gt; Wolf gave to him for his trip back to base. He snatched it up and \nran \n&gt; back to the lab room. He nearly bent his fingers again catching \n&gt; himself at the frame of the doorway. He ran back to the table side, \n&gt; his face still a little wild.\n&gt; \n&gt; He threw the fur pelt across Dark Mouse&#39;s body.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Here,&quot; he quickly said. &quot;This better?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
