She had gottem mad at him for protecting her and now \nshe was taking his fight! Shadow had aimed specifically at him, and \nshe had interfered! He didn&#39;t argue when she stepped up and \ntransformed, so why did she have to take his battle?\n\nProwl realizes that rage was building up at him. The Maximal tries to \nfight it down, telling himself that it was irrational. He had no idea \nwhy he was reacting like that. Perhaps the eagerness of this new body \nto battle?\n\n-We don&#39;t have time for this,- he tells Iron Raptor -Kluster&#39;s gonna \nhit the roof.-\n\nHe couldn&#39;t see much from his position other than Iron Raptor&#39;s \nshield except for her sword, finding it rahter impressive. But he was \nstill angry, and it didn&#39;t impress him too much.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor suddenly snapped her head towards Shadow as he moved, \nthinking \n&gt; it rather clever to not reply until now...while their guard was \nobviously \n&gt; down.\n&gt; Her body moving almost as if it had a mind of its own.\n&gt; Stepping infront of Prowl as Shadow unloads the clip, she snapps \nher arm \n&gt; infront of her face, a large black and red shield with the Maximal \nsymbol \n&gt; with three silver claw slashes behind it brandeshed on the face as \nit \n&gt; extends from the top and bottom of her left arm plate.\n&gt; The bottom extending all the way to her waist, her legs \nautomatically \n&gt; bracing as the charges hit the shield.\n&gt; It was amaizing!\n&gt; It was if she wasn&#39;t in controle, but her mind was just watching \nwhile her \n&gt; body moved to its own accord!\n&gt; Her voice low and with more of a deadly edge to it then she ever \nknew she \n&gt; had.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t think so!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then the shield seemed to slide right beck into her arm as \nshe wheeled \n&gt; it around to extend, leaving her right arm to come up behind her \nhead, her \n&gt; fingers wrapping around something that felt familier but she didn&#39;t \neven \n&gt; know was there.\n&gt; With a ring of steel her arm pulled upward, revieling the flashing \nblade of \n&gt; a broad-sword.\n&gt; Without a single movement to betray her actions she lifted the \nsword high \n&gt; into the air, the blade seeming to shimmer in the early afternoon \nsun.\n&gt; A helm seemed to come up from the back of her neck, her hair \nseeming to \n&gt; disappear into the armor as it covered her head. Just as black as \nthe rest \n&gt; of the suit. All except the silver face-plate which covered her \nmouth and \n&gt; nose.\n&gt; Now, if never before, she liiked like a real knight, brandeshing a \nsword \n&gt; over her head.\n&gt; Her voice sounding cold  with a twist of brutal sarcasm behind it.\n&gt; The sword held high.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; What time is it Mr.Wolf?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * In one fluid movement her body shifted, straining in the armor to \nmake it \n&gt; move faster then it was made to.\n&gt; Sparks flying up from the joints as she took two very quick steps, \narmor \n&gt; screeching as she brought the sword down in one fluid stroke.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Your time!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that, the blade glew blue for one split second before \nand energy \n&gt; slash was released from the blade, hutting the ground as it sliced \ntowards \n&gt; Shadow.\n&gt; Iron Raptors body left in still ness, the blade&#39;s tip touching the \nground \n&gt; with her head forward, watching the energy slash heading for her \ntarget.\n&gt; All the time thinking...&lt;where the hell did all THAT come from?!!&gt;*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
