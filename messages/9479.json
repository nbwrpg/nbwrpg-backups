But feared Megatron&#39;s anger.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike looked up and stood up. He calmed down a little. He \nlooked at \n&gt; Dark Mouse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who is coming?&quot; a voice asked. Quickstrike jolted, and nearly lost \nhis \n&gt; balanace. It was Megatron&#39;s voice. He hated it when he came out of \nno where \n&gt; wanting to know what was going on. Quickstrike had some things to \nhide a \n&gt; while ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron came to Dark Mouse&#39;s side and looked at them both in beast \nmode. He \n&gt; lowered his head to their level. Quickstrike lowered his head, a \nlittle \n&gt; unsteady on his legs.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
