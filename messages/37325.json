He put it down, and climbed up the \nside\n&gt; of the ship. As soon as he reached the wing he nealt down, and\n&gt; transformed, then lowerd his crane and hook over the side. With\n&gt; beautiful persition, he hooked the Hyperdrive, then began to real it\n&gt; upwards. He then extended his crane area, over to the engine, and\n&gt; lowered it down. He unlatched his hook, and the transformed, using \nhis\n&gt; arms to push himself up.
