He knew hed be in \ndanger of the =\r\n\n&gt; rust plague but he didnt care this was much for imporant.

He was heading to Earth to \nvisit s=\r\nome \n&gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he got there, he \ndec=\r\nided he would \n&gt; &gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He found one in the ships =\r\n\ndatabanks. A \n&gt; &gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift o=\r\nff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of th=\r\ne \ntruck, every \n&gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into hi=\r\nmself. He \ngot up from his \n&gt; &gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpt=\r\nicons, and went to \nprepare. As he \n&gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into himse=\r\nlf he thought of all the \npeople on this \n&gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;             He touched his chest, the change to actual bot had \nhurt his =\r\ncombined \n&gt; &gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;             In the deep Prime voice that had once declared to \nMegatron =\r\nthat &quot;one \n&gt; &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus would dare \n=\r\nbetray me like that?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t even sit down as he entered the atmosp=\r\nhere, the ship \nshook. He was \n&gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magn=\r\nus had planted on the \nship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s th=\r\nrusters exploded, but the rest of the \nship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; Instead, it careen=\r\ned out of control and slammed into the ground, \nthrowing Prime \n&gt; &gt; out of =\r\nthe hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship stopped.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n    When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. \nHe was in full \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked back to \nthe ship =\r\nto look. \n&gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and the =\r\n\nvisor over his \n&gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform u=\r\nnderneath, \nthe red eye \n&gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smas=\r\nhed and dented, \nand his \n&gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could s=\r\nee the shoulder \njoints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sor=\r\nt of robot \nsent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm w=\r\nas a bit ripped up too, but he \ncould live with \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n     Luckily for him, the communications boxes on these \npods were nearly \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other bots. \nFirst thou=\r\ngh was \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he sta=\r\nrted, with disgust, &quot;and the \none known as \n&gt; &gt; Hydra. I have a message for=\r\n you. Magnus is dead. He was killed \ntrying to stop \n&gt; &gt; me. But he was uns=\r\nuccessful. I am requesting a meeting with both \nof you, at \n&gt; &gt; these coord=\r\ninates. [Punches in coordinates] Know that if you \ndecide to betray my \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n trust and come with soldiers, I will kill all of you. I will \nknow=85&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;             With that he cut off the transmission and waited, \nchecki=\r\nng over his \n&gt; &gt; guns=85.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
