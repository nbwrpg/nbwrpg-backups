It&#39;s jet back and stream \nlined hull was unmarred by insignias, it&#39;s pilot likewise sat \nbrooding as he read the reports from Cybertron. This battle between \ntransformers had been a long one, far longer than any of the others \nthis pathetic dirt ball had ever seen or would see.\n\nReaching out the figures clawed hand stroked an orb on the panel in \nfront of him, his ship smoothly beginning its decent into Earth&#39;s \natmosphere, the angle causing great stress on the hull from the heat, \nthe cabin he knew would be blistering hot to organics but to him it \nwas unchanged, as he focused his attention on a qualified landing \nsite he began reading out the energon levels the planet emitted.

The \nexplosion singed his dark forms fur as the crafts explosion sent \nflame and metal into the air, blasting a small hole into the ground.\n\nScanning the wreckage satisfied that the computers and specs of the \ncraft would not be recovered the transformer slunk into the jungle \nactivating his tracker and looking for the distinctive energy \nsignatures of those in the current conflicts....\n\n\n\n\n"}}
