Hurt you, and hurt me too.  It&#39;s not going to be easy, but it is necessary.  It&#39;s for your betterment.  I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot love both you and Wolfblade as I have tried.  It simply will not work.  It was wrong of me to force you into this arrangement, and I&#39;m sorry for that.  I have thought long and hard over this, and I have come to the conclusion I love Wolfblade more, enough to spend the rest of my life with her.  I still love you, Blacknightmare, but not romantically.  You helped save me from Unicron, for that I am eternally grateful.  Please, do not be angry or upset, don&#39;t leave in pain.  Stay with us, you&#39;re a close friend, it would kill me from the inside out if you left and got injured or killed.  You have the chance to move on now, to find someone more worthy than me for your romantic desires.  I&#39;ve killed more than I care to remember, for many millions of years.  You don&#39;t want to be around me all the time anyway.  You have\n a new life, go and live it, explore every possibility, I wish not to hinder you.  I love you still, my dearest friend, and savior.  Please, do not be angry at me or Wolfblade for this, it is all my doing.&quot;\n\nAirly &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\nBlacknightmare:\n \nThe femme shuddered, it wasn&#39;t good signal, barely keeping her selfcontrol she replied softly&quot;sure...&quot;\n\n\n\n&quot;HA!
