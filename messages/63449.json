I also am highly skilled at\nrecon.&quot;  She paused a moment to let him think on what she said. &quot;My\nvenom is not only with my fangs but my tongue as well. I am skilled at\ntranslating codes and finding hidden signals. I do have many\nleadership programs at my disposal and know how to use them\neffectively.&quot;  She gave him a modest smile, still holding herself\nhigh. &quot;I trust that I have skills you will find useful.&quot; \n\nShe felt like an advertisement holoboard from Cybertron at that point.\nLast thing she wanted to do was try to sell herself.  She had expected\nhim to just accept her and not feel that he needed to test her.\nHowever, perhaps her releasing information of some of her capabilities\nwould give her an instant rank possition, and not just something from\nthe bottom of the ranks. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How sweet...&quot;hissed the male&quot;Of course, revenge and destruction\nit&#39;s an essencial part of predacons but I&#39;m thankfull that you decide\nto wait...
