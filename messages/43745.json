On\nthe ground, under a torrent of water, kneels one of the most famous\ncybertronions ever, Megatron, who is being hunt down by a strange\ntransmetal monster. Smoke rises from his chasi, as the Decepticon leader\nbegins to finally stir, then from under the wet metal, two violent red\neyes begin to glow, as in a swift movement, the Decepticon leader dives\nin front of two missiles, then swiftly rolls towards Prowl, as he opens\nhis mouth to let loose a hideous shriek. He outstreches both hands,\naiming for Prowl&#39;s body, to attempt to grapple the strange Maximal, with\niron fingers, capable of bending steel girders without thought.\n\n"}}
