She saw nothing for\nthe Alliance but destruction and knew that there was no way she&#39;d let her\nfathers dream be distorted by the likes of them. She had the printouts from\nthe CR chambers, and her father had the skill to recreate the DNA patterns\nhe needed. There wasn&#39;t a reason to stay other than to watch the fight. It\nwas the perfect chance to escape, unfortunately Squizzy knew to much about\nher experiments to be left behind. She couldn&#39;t leave the mongoose behind\nwhile it was still functioning. something had to be done soon and she had to\ndecide what it was.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 03, 2000 4:22 PM\nSubject: Defending the Allience\n\n\n&gt; Squizzy&gt; Starts firing heavy duty tranquilizer darts randomly at the\nattacking\n&gt; bots who were close to the base.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
