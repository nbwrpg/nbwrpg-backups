His plans were coming to\n&gt; frutation. He could see the planet that Megatron, Hell Beast, Liono\n&gt; (spelling?) Prime, and all the others that were fighting for Cybertron.\n&gt;     &quot;I wonder how my good friend Bazooka is?&quot; He muttered to himself.\n&gt; &quot;Oh..Can&#39;t forget Bobertron.&quot;\n&gt;     Magmatron has no beast mode yet.\n&gt;     &quot;Warning, Ionic interfearence. Unable to navigate safe landing.\nEmergency\n&gt; Stasis Lock under effect.&quot;\n&gt;     Magmatron went into stasis lock. The Ship crashed into the planet\n&gt; causeing a land slide. His ship was buried but Skeletons were uncovered.\nThe\n&gt; DNA Scanner came online and began to scan, it malfunctioned because of the\n&gt; Ionic interfearence and made a Fuzor mode.\n&gt;     He awoke and began his plan. Calling out to all the Dinosaurs he could\n&gt; reach. But projecting his signal from another location entirely.\n&gt;     &quot;Bazooka, Bobertron, Carnage, Dark One, Skywarp, Ramjet, Dirge,\n&gt; Terrorsaur, Cyber Claw, Ultracon, Stegotron, Triceradon, Sludge, Swoop,\n&gt; Snarl, Slag, Grimlock, Dinobot, Iron Raptor, join me in my quest. I will\n&gt; reward you greatly. I will not ask you to destroy your leaders. Simply to\n&gt; join me in my quest. Cybertron will be ours.&quot; Magmatron Signaled to the\n&gt; Dinosaur Transformers.
