Arcangel was acing like a weirdo. He all the sudden grabs her,\nkissing her, he races to her like a bullet and grabs her and calls her\nhoney. He wasn&#39;t letting her do anything. It seemed impossible to get a\nmoment alone with him becaues he keeps playing hero. She starts walking off\ntowards the rocky mountains. She wasn&#39;t worried about Jagris or another\nfemmbot stealing Arcangel, she would simply rip her head off, and have her\nfor dinner, that&#39;s all. Kamodia keeps walking.*\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;jagris@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, October 07, 2000 10:27 PM\nSubject: Re: The matrix\n\n\n&gt; &quot;Thanks.&quot; Jagris motioned for Kamodia to lead the way. &quot;You know the\n&gt; path, so lead on, my friend.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Arcangel/Firestorm\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Arcangel he turned to jagris and threw her his energon Shot Gun.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Arcangel:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;do not go after him just yet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; before he could say anything else a com came in from Firestorm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firestorm\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firestorm:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hey Arcangel we found a ship near ours it seems. to be transport\n&gt; ship you\n&gt; &gt; want to come and have a look at it?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Arcangel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;yes I will.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; he ended his com. then he turned to jagris.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Arcangel:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ask kamodia to show you to Ironraptor.
