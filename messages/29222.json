He looks ahead of him, seeing a \nlarge \n&gt; bot laying on the ground, in stasis lock. Fliq walks up to the bot, \n&gt; noting that he was Decepticon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lets get you to a CR,&quot; he says, knowing the Decepticon probably \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t hear him, and slings Strafe onto his back with alot of \n&gt; difficulty. The large fox takes off back toward the CF, sending a \n&gt; transmission to Iron Raptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Commander,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;There&#39;s quite a large wreck at \nmy \n&gt; position. You might want to send a few bots to salvage this place.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
