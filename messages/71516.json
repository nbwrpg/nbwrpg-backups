Perhaps two indivi=\r\nduals could fit in one chamber if that chamber\n&gt;&gt; were large enough.

He turns his head over to\n&gt;&gt; Stanton and Quickstride=\r\n with a gentile expression on his face.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Thanks for the assist, I h=\r\nave Talon with me now, I&#39;ll be all right.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Quickstride gathers his l=\r\neaders intentions and steps back.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Oh I see, sure, just be careful =\r\nthe rest of the way to CR.  And if you\n&gt;&gt; have any trouble, call us.   Well=\r\n, Stanton, I think this is the part where\n&gt;&gt; we step back and allow our new=\r\nest couple to have a little bit of alone time.\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus and Nightlight ar=\r\nen&#39;t the only ones who, you know..

This\n&gt;&gt; time would be more than just therapeutic.

And that could=\r\n take a while which will\n&gt;&gt; give us plenty of quality time alone.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; A=\r\ns his chamber opens, Tucson gently seats Talon down first and takes a seat\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; next to her in a position where he could lay back and not harm her in th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; process.  With a gentile coaxing he lays both Talon and himself down o=\r\nn the\n&gt;&gt; comfortable repair bench.  There was just one minor formality.  He=\r\n had never\n&gt;&gt; invited a femme bot to partake in formal courtship, and had n=\r\no idea what it\n&gt;&gt; would entail.
