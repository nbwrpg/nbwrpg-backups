He raced out ofr the base, transformed\ninto his supersonic air attack mode and raced as fast\nas he could to the Ark.  Within 3 hours he&#39;d arrived\nat the volcano which would later be called Mount St\nHillary. Activating his retrothrusters, he began a\nslow decent, disturbing the local shrubland and trees,\ncausing them to twist and bend as though they were in\na gail. About 2 metres above the ground, he\ntransfomred to robot mode, landing with a thud.\n\n&#39;Let&#39;s hope the command codes I programmed in at the\nbase level of Teletran 1&#39;s programming haven&#39;t been\ndiscovered or altered.&#39; he thought to himself.\n\nWith that he activated his comm unit, and, opening a\nsecure coded channel with sextuple encryption,\ntransmitted the master override codes into Teletran 1.\n With that, the supercomputer awakened and openned its\ndoors, awaiting instructions from its creator. \nHowever, Shadowcaster wasn&#39;t interested right at thaty\nmoment with shoring up The Ark&#39;s defences, even though\nhe knew damn well that this place was the Chaos\nBringer&#39;s prime target.\n\nWalking upto Optimus&#39;s stasis filled body, he\nproceeded to open up his chest, more specifically, the\nmatrix chamber.\n\n&quot;Sorry Orion, but this is the only way.&quot; with that, he\nactivated a life support sequence for Optimus &#39; body\nwhile the matrix was missing from it, before openning\nhis own chest up to reveal his own matrix chamber,\nwhere he placed it. He&#39;d forgotten the unbelievable\nfeeling of power he had when he&#39;d carried the matrix;\nthe sense of power which at the same time is tempered\nby incredible wisdom- Shadimus Prime had been reborn!\n\nTransmitting a code to Teletran 1 raising its defences\nto Condition Red, Shadimus then sits down and\nconcentrates, knowing that unless he can commune with\nPrimus, all transformers in existence, along with the\nfuture that would be, are doomed.......\n\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
