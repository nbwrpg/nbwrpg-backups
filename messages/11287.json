Feline was still brushing the tip of her \ntail against his neck.  It felt nice.  Listening to what she had to say, he \nsmiled back.  &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; he responded.  That was all he could get out, \nnow that Feline had began holding onto his arm tightly and was now closer \nthan before.  He sighed happily once more, continuing to walk for the mess \nhall, wishing the moment would last forever.  But, he knew, as soon as the \ncomputer told him the intruder was on the move, he would have to \nunfortunately go.  &quot;Oh, heh, how silly of me.  My name is Chordate.  What&#39;s \nyours?&quot;\n\n"}}
