Tigerhawk, whether intentionally or not, had \njust put all their lives on the line. Right about now she&#39;d feel alot \nsafer facing a fleet of Preds than hanging here, helpless, with \nTigerhawk threatening to blow up the ship. \n\nTavatron followed Tigerhawk&#39;s movements with her eyes. She cringed \nslightly as he detonated the grenade, expecting a blinding flash and \nsudden death. Instead all that followed was a sudden flash of light, \ncausing her to cry out in surprise as she shut her eyes against the \nblinding light. Her wolfen eyes were quite sensitive to sudden\nchanges \nin light and dark, but this was too much. She slowly opened her \noptics, expecting to see small colorful dots, much like after a\ncamera \nflash:\n\n&quot;Oh slag...&quot;\n\nTavatron whispered softly. This was even worse. Tavarton&#39;s eyes\ndarted \nabout the room, searching, hoping for any sign of color, of light. \nInstead all she saw were dark shadows against an even darker\nbackdrop. \nThe grenade had blinded her. The blast, coupled with her injuries \nfrom the earlier battle, had destroyed what was left of her sight. It \nwas nothing a CR chamber couldn&#39;t fix, but unfortunetly she didn&#39;t \nhave access to one. \n\n\n"}}
