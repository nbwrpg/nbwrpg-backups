But AJ is \nright to a point, just like everyone else is right to a point.\nI admit myself, since the idea was both mine and AJs in the making, that \nit&#39;s wasn&#39;t good. And I have no idea why he had to put in all those breast \nwords, chest-plate would have been fine and I&#39;v already talked to him about \nit and he admits that it was wrong too.\nBut Dcoburn, all that was uncalled for. You might not like him and niether \ndoes Yan, but you didn&#39;t have to go that far.\nI&#39;v known AJ for a long time now and he&#39;s a good person.\nAnd that first post was meant for Yan only, he accidentally sent it into the \nRPG. He said so himself. BUT, even now he doesn&#39;t really understand what the \nproblem was.\nMyself and AJ were only trying to be funny, we didn&#39;t know that so many of \nyou would hate it. If we would have known he wouldn&#39;t have posted it.\nAnd some of you were right, I don&#39;t exactly agree with AJs post to the \ngroup, but all he was trying to say is basically and short:\nI didn&#39;t know it was wrong and if I did I wouldn&#39;t have done it. So please \nstop yelling at me.\nHe feels very bad about all this.\nAnd I don&#39;t like how he snapps back either. I think it&#39;s rude. But maybe, \njust maybe if people will take the time to calm down and talk about this \nlike proper human beings, and I mean AJ too, maybe we can work this out \nwithout hurting anyone&#39;s feelings.\nAnd without being mean.\nI&#39;v already said I&#39;m sorry, it was amistake and I&#39;ll never try to be funny \nagain. Seriously.\nBut everyone has to work together here.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
