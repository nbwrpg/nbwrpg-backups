He\nhad a few tricks left but decided to hold them in case of emergency. at the\nmoment he was in desperate need of a silver tounge and a lot of luck. &quot;We\nwere sent to retrieve a bot named Silver Scout.&quot; the quickest answers were\nto tell the truth so he smiled a political smile and continued. &quot;The bot\nthat was with me and I were outside the base when your group over reacted\nand sunk it. The choice was to either get barbacued or break in so we sort\nof cut a hole and broke in.&quot; He knew that only two things could get him out\nof this mess. A stroke of genius or a gamblers luck were required to get his\ntail out of this one. The thief knew that genius was out of the question so\nhe prayed for luck. &quot;We meant no agression we just wanted our bot back.&quot;\n\nThe fox had other things going through his mind as well. The Predacons might\nnot be very happy about having thier DNA duplicated without thier permition.\nHe thought about the odds that the Preds hadn&#39;t scanned Silver Scouts DNA\nbut the way the day was going he knew that there was only a snowballs chance\nin the inferno that they hadn&#39;t. He knew that they knew that the wolf DNA\nwas duplicated and that his arrival pointed a finger at exactly how the DNA\nwas obtained. Now his biggest problem was how to use that to his advantage.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: Neo Beast Wars RPG &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 4:12 AM\nSubject: Interrogation\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Ok, I&#39;ll repost for starting the interogation.
