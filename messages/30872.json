Within seconds of seeing\nthe eyes strugle, the owner of the fist, Beastbox, brings it down into the\nface of Condor, as hard as he can.\n\nIn the corner Megatron had just entered the room with Beastbox, and Scourge\nprobably just behind him, he wasnt sure. Megatron sat down in one of the\nchairs in Switchblade&#39;s room, and crossed his legs, looking forward to the\nshow. &quot;Switchblade, Scourge, Fireblade, you have the best seats in the\nhouse. Before I left Cybertron, 4 millions years ago, Beastbox was one of\nthe Decepticons main interrogaters. Unfortunately he has a short fuse, and\nmost robots he interrogates dont survive long enough to give us the\ninformation, he has kept his position due to pure entertainment he\ndelivers&quot; Megatron finishes, with a smile crossing his face.\n\n\n\n"}}
