Well, I&#39;m surprised! Last time I saw him, he was a low rank. He \ncould barely stand to be near the others. Everyone gave him no respect.&quot; He \nlaughed. &quot;I am amazed! He managed for himself.&quot; He smiled. &quot;The stories he \ntold me, now second in command. Perhaps my advise did help.&quot; His attention \ncame back to the two bots. &quot;Yes, I will go, but will you give me a nano \nklick?&quot;\n\nThe red flier folded his arms. &quot;Sure, whatever it is.&quot;\n\nAfter that, Rowdy Wolf ran inside of the cave and grabbed a few furs. He \ncame back to the two Predacons. &quot;Can you carry these, flier?&quot;\n\n&quot;My name is Terrorsaur, and I&#39;d suppose I could carry them. I could use \nsomething like that.&quot;\n\nRowdy Wolf turned his head to KitKat. &quot;A fur for the trip back?&quot; He offered \nher a fur blanket.\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Mon, 17 Jul 2000 00:02:42 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt;She looked at Rowdy. &quot;Quickstrike is the second in command.&quot; She\n&gt;looked at Terrorsaur with a look on her face as if to say &#39;go  on and\n&gt;say something to him&#39;.
