I was intending to change some of the rules (after a council \nreview) thus legalizing EMP (to a degree), seeking missiles, and \nperhaps flash bombs.\n\nIt was also a little overwhelming to see 60 posts in less than two \ndays when i logged on to post for Megatron (the post i lost in the \ncomp crash). Posts are supposed to last a very short amount of time. \nIn battles, since there are many people involved, role players \nshould not just keep posting, but wait for the rest of the RPG to \ncatch up. In the 60 posts several new characters were introduced at \nthe Predacon base, and a bunch of other stuff happened, while \nMegatron &#39;lagged out&#39;. =P Just a reminds to keep an eye on those \nthings.\n\nCardhead, When Azure suggested you hold your posting, you should \nhold your posting. He&#39;s not a moderator just so he can stand around \nand look pretty. Moderators are to be listened too, that way \nmistakes or misconceptions can be picked up and fixed before \nanything disasterous happens (we hope anyway). =)\n\nLastly, I&#39;d like to congratulate people on the excellent posting \nthat I read while I was busy catching up. ^^\n\n\n"}}
