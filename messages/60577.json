If his body is \nresiliant, then we have to attack him psychologically.  Mind games \nshould be useful.  I will need time to figure his personality, I \nneed to know him.  If I can figure him out, then I can brainwash \nhim.  Then, you will have a perfect servant: never tiring, powerful, \nintelligent, almost indestructable.  A Perfect Herald of Unicron!&quot;\n&gt; Hellplague was sure she was right, Malice could be powerful, and \nhers.

Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero \n&gt; &gt; tempatures \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of space.  The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; airlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the \n&gt; &gt; ground.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a \nroom, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.  His left \nshoulder \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of \n&gt; semi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.

I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.

He dumped them all around the hunter and went to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \n&gt; &gt; somewhat, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more \nalert.  \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \n&gt; &gt; settled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to \n&gt; it, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder \nimmediatly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and \n&gt; scooted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back \nonto \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his \narms \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and straddled \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting \nherself \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little \nlizard \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a \n&gt; devious \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smirk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
