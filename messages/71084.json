Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m=\r\n asking a favor on\n&gt; Tucsons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behalf. His waves are strong enough to p=\r\nick up enemy forces in wide\n&gt; range,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he wants to take it up a not=\r\nch and see if he can immobilize them at\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; further range. Kind of pu=\r\nt them in a stall for now. Can you set up an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amplifier signal to merg=\r\ne with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It would be\n&gt; greatly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice can be heard over Tu=\r\nscon&#39;s radio, &quot;Many of the\n&gt; Ark&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; systems are also being affected by=\r\n the wave you are transmitting. At\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment Perceptor and I are m=\r\ninimizing the damage by reallocating power\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down systems to the=\r\n few that are still running.

Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s wave.

So this means that your ninja buddy is no longer =\r\nsuffering from that, because the wave that&#39;s emitted, is so low powered=\r\n that not even a moth could feel it. Just think of a bat using their echolo=\r\ncation for trapping an insect, and you have the strength of the wave.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Hope this helps. \n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbw=\r\nrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super =\r\nCyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Just a quick ques=\r\ntion: Is Tuscon still emitting his wave while he is doing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; all this=\r\n?

He had dealt with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; intruders of the dark many times, an=\r\nd being visually impaired, he knew how&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; to unlock their secrets=\r\n of steath.

He switches his sonar systems to conscentrate on the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\nntruder. He was very close now. His blips getting stronger. With Hydras not=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; too far behind, he realized he had to do what he had pulled =\r\non the old&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; abandoned base while working with Lord Perseus. Whe=\r\nn in doubt, resort to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; isolation. He concentrates, listens, and=\r\n deciphers that the ninja is within&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; his range, in the same ar=\r\nea. The dark was his element as well, as he soon&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; finds a manua=\r\nl control to shut the doors sealing himself and the ninja&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; insi=\r\nde.

HE&#39;S THERE!!!&quot; said elita&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; while the c=\r\nloack device briefly fall she was able to see it .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; fa=\r\nce went dark as Elita told him about her near capture by the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nintruder, his arms holding her firmly as she talked. &quot;That will never =\r\nhappen&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; my little one.&quot; He said, his voice confident and s=\r\nure as he spoke.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus looked in the =\r\ndirection that Elita was pointing but could not see&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; anything =\r\nsince the intruder was still a few halls away and several walls&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; were standing between him and the intruder.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &quot;LEO, UPROAR!&quot; Rodimus said, his voice once again full of =\r\ncommand. &quot;Go&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; retrieve this intruder. It is time to have =\r\na few words with him.&quot; There was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; old confidence in Rodimu=\r\ns&#39; voice again as he stood tall and protective over&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; his yo=\r\nung daughter. &quot;Ramulus, go with them. I want him captured!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &l=\r\nt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor tried to =\r\ncut of the main lead, stop the explosion and save&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the ark!!!!!=\r\n!! Then He yellss in pain, what ever Tucson have done, it really&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; hurted. but Overcoming the pain contined working and trying to insolate=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Autobots and decepticons from the main mess.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As =\r\nPerceptor worked Legacy also struggled to keep different systems&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; online, rerouting power from one system to the next. There were times w=\r\nhen&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; they were successful, but there were also many other times=\r\n wHere sparks flew&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; because a system was either shorted out or =\r\nthe fluctuation tripped some sort&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of breaker, causing cascadi=\r\nng power failures.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Interesting.&q=\r\nuot; Legacy intoned as obviously like Perpector his acute&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sens=\r\nes were being similarly affected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. &quot;The bridge =\r\nseems&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; largely unaffected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. It must bec=\r\nause it has shielding in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; place.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Outside the ark, Tucson holds his position and his wave. A look of&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; sheer determination floods his face. He had not answered Kup ri=\r\nght away, but&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; needed not to, as his body langauge fortells tha=\r\nt of a determined Autobot,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sworn to duty, and prepared to go =\r\nas much distance as needed. In the midsts&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the wave, he pick=\r\ns up a blip. He detects the intruder inside, and with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that wav=\r\ne, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone what&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still underway, he app=\r\nroaches the ark&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. The =\r\nonly one who would know what&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;d be up to, would be Legac=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar sy=\r\nstems have picked up the intruder. I know of his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; location and =\r\nI&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; tra=\r\nnsmit. Can you give me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &q=\r\nuot;One moment.&quot; Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the=\r\n front&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; door to the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You s=\r\nhould have complete access&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to the Ark, as does everyone else.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Tuscon moved forward though l=\r\now energy reserve alarm signals began to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; go off in Tuson&#39;s=\r\n head. His wounds, his own energy loss over his trip back&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fin=\r\nally beginning to catch up with him. While his wounds were bound so he&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; leaked no further energy, he had yet to get to a recharging chambe=\r\nr, and the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; tremendous amounts of energy that he was putting ou=\r\nt to maintain his wave&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; was further depleting his already low =\r\nenergy reserves.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &quot; Owww.. That wave is really hurting my relays.. Wait a sec, my rada=\r\nrs&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are picking up activity all over the place. We need ta amp=\r\nlify that wave of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; yours.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks down to her.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power already Straight Shot. Unless of co=\r\nurse, Legacy can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rig up an amplifier within the Ark to supple=\r\nment my sonar attack.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\ntraight Shot nodds.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#=\r\n39;ll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m asking a favor on Tucsons=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; behalf. His waves are strong enough to pick up enemy forces =\r\nin wide range,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; but he wants to take it up a notch and see if h=\r\ne can immobilize them at a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; further range. Kind of put them in =\r\na stall for now. Can you set up an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; amplifier signal to merge =\r\nwith Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It would be greatly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; appreciate=\r\nd.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s cold voice can be heard over Tuscon&#39;s ra=\r\ndio, &quot;Many of the Ark&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; systems are also being affec=\r\nted by the wave you are transmitting. At the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; moment Perceptor =\r\nand I are minimizing the damage by reallocating power from&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; dow=\r\nn systems to the few that are still running. I have no resources&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; available to comply with your request.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ou=\r\ntside the Ark, Night Shift catches something on his radar, and begins&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; to pick up a little speed, buzzing a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunt=\r\ning dog&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; fixated on it&#39;s target.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;S A PRED SIGNA=\r\nTURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;re not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; far from our targets Kup, I ca=\r\nn feel &#39;em!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Tra=\r\np too, senses them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;He&=\r\n#39;s right! I got the pred signature and it&#39;s locked&#39;n loaded! Ohh=\r\nh&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wheels was right! He was right! They&#39;re still here!&quo=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets a hold of Ro=\r\ndimus and the others at the Ark.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot;This is Rat Trap ta base! Ya won&#39;t believe it, but Wheels was=\r\n right on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the money this time! They&#39;re out here, and I be=\r\nt they&#39;re around the other&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; parameters too! Keep your senso=\r\nrs out for &#39;em, &#39;cause ya never know what&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; those creeps=\r\n are gonna be up to.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nack at the Ark, outside, Tucson holds for word, but with sonars at&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; full blast, he picks up activity happening all around the Ark. He narr=\r\nows&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; his optics dangerously.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and seek... Been there, don=\r\ne that a million&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I know you&#39=\r\n;re out there.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n OOC: Keep in mind, it was ONLY the intruder inside the Ark who&#39;s steal=\r\nth&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; shielding went down. Blackrazor has an active shield that w=\r\nas disrupted by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon&#39;s wave. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is =\r\nof a different sort and at the moment&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is unaffected by it. Ho=\r\nwever that is water under the bridge with unfolding&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; events :)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; As the Maximals creep forward in an attempt to locate the Predacons,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont=\r\n touch the ark but ATTACK&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; THE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Six sweeps fly into the air,=\r\n followed by their leader Scourge! As soon as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; they leave the v=\r\nicinity of Hydras, the Predacon leader looses the advantage&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of=\r\n their stealth and immediately begins showing up on Maximal radar screens!&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However the sweeps still maintain their stealth, and only tho=\r\nse who can&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; physically see them are aware of them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With a viciousness all their own, they begin to ope=\r\nn fire on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maximals!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nuscon receives a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I am receiving readings of=\r\n a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; single Predacon in your area, his IFF signal identifying hi=\r\nm as Hydras.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although there was a certain level of urge=\r\nncy in his voice, Legacy was still&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; calm and reserved as he mad=\r\ne his tranmission.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Back inside the Ark the intruder frowned as he realized tha=\r\nt his bomb had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not gone off. With a whispered curse he contin=\r\nued to try to adapt his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; stealth shielding to Tuscon&#39;s wave=\r\n. With a worried look he began to run down&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the hall, if he cou=\r\nldn&#39;t sneak out, he would BLAST his way out!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bl=\r\nockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--bcaec53f979788da50049ec5fe3e--\r\n\n"}}
