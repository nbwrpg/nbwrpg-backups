He landed roughly on his\nback, droping his gun.\n\nCliffjumper&#39;s wheels began to spin again, showing his signs of life, as\nhe groaned in pain. He transformed, now on his stomach, and used his\narms to push himelf upright. &lt;Decepticons&gt;, he thought, &lt;they must be on\nthe ship&gt; he searched through his mind, as he took a step forwards, and\nstumbled. He looked down, his foot was badly dammaged, smoke poured out\nof two large holes of twisted metal. He aimed his gun down, and fired a\nslight burst, and screamed in pain, as he heated the metal up. &quot;Wish\nBeachcomber was here.&quot; he whispered, as he bent down, and bended the\nmetal over, to cover the gash.\n\n"}}
