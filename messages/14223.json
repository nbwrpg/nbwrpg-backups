At long last the Autobots would be destroyed....as \nwould all the transformers on the planet, including his body. But it was a \nsmall sacrifice if that ment the Decepticons would be destroyed. His plan, \nonce in control of the Armada, would be to completely obliterate the planet, \nthe transformers, Predacons included, and humans.
