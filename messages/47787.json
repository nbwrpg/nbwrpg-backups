He connects some \nwires, fixing the internal sensors. He gets up, brushing himself off. \n&quot;Hmm, organic beast modes will help. As for the rest of us who prefer \nmechanical modes, we&#39;ll have to inselate ourselves with the same \ntechnology.&quot;He checks the sensors.&quot;Damn! The ship looks like slag. But \ncould have been worse, we could have crashed on Quintessa, or into \nUnicron.&quot;\n&gt; He laughed at the joke only he, and maybe history buffs, would get.\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Deck 2, CR Chamber room\n&gt; \n&gt; Talos had moved through the damaged ship and ascended the stairs to \ndeck two where the main generators and CR chambers were located. After \nrecieving Sunhawks and Hot Rod&#39;s reports he nodded before moving to a \ncommunications hub that wasn&#39;t sparking and turned on ship wide \nbroadcasting, &quot;Sensors have detected massive energon readings outside \nthe ship, all personnel should report to the CR Chamber bay for \nalterate form protection, do not stray far from the ship before you \nhave done this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Closing the channel he moved to a console and began typing, on the \ntop of the ship a hatch slid open freeing an extending pole that began \nscanning the surrounding area for compatible forms. After several \nseconds the machine stayed at a low hum holding a list of available \nalternate forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Entering one of the CR chambers he let the nanobots change his \ncasing to more suit the transformation to beast mode. When the pod \nopened again Talos stepped out in his mammoth form. &quot;Talos, MAXIMIZE!&quot; \nHe spoke as his body adjusted back to it&#39;s robotic form. Opening the \ncomm to the bridge again he spoke, &quot;Might want to repair that \ndestroyed viewing portal there guys, the damage has probably rendered \nthe bridges protective fields offline or at least unstable though from \nthe time frame I&#39;m guessing unstable so be careful don&#39;t want you guys \nslipping into stasis lock...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
