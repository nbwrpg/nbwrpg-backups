He ducked close to the wall to make\nhimself a smaller target. He scanned for autoguns and when he found thier\nlocation. Quickly transforming to bot mode  he slid a series of mirror chips\nacross the floor.(Another thief trick I learned in other RPGs) Each chip\nwould identify itself as him so the autoguns wouldn&#39;t get a lock on him. He\nknew he&#39;d screwed up, letting his curiosity get the best of him. He knew he\nwas safe though, Curiosity only kills cats, and he&#39;s a fox.\n\n\n&gt;DarkMouse::\nShe still held the gun at close range at FoxFinger. She knew the\nautoguns were on him.  She smiled. &quot;You know, your either very smart,\nor very stupid. Your in KitKat&#39;s base now. So, what are you doing\nhere?&quot;\n\nMessage 2\n&quot;Getting away I hope.&quot; Foxfingers yelps as he  dove to the ground sliding\npast Darkmouse. He hoped that his mirror chips would confuse the autoguns.\nif they didn&#39;t then the autoguns would have to go through Darkmouse to hit\nhim.\n\n\n\n\n\nSent: Monday, October 30, 2000 6:37 AM\nSubject: Re: Foxfingers\n\n\n&gt; (Sorry, I thought Starscream had gone to intercept FoxFingers.  No\n&gt; matter, it shall be taken care of.)\n&gt;\n&gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; She looked at the monitor with KitKat and the other bot. Then a small\n&gt; red light started flashing. She looked at the other screen and saw a\n&gt; bot trying to sneek in. She grinned,&quot;Oh it looks like I&#39;ll have a\n&gt; little fun today after all.&quot; She got up and looked at Drillbit. &quot;YOu\n&gt; stay here and tell me what I miss on the conversation. I&#39;ll be right\n&gt; back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She drew her pistol and walked out. She went down the hallway and\n&gt; towards the entrance. She stopped just around the corner from the\n&gt; other bot. She heard his foot falls get sloser. She raised her gun\n&gt; and jumped out from behind the corner, aiming at the intruder.\n&gt; &quot;FREEZE OR YOUR DEAD! AUTOGUNS! TAKE AIM!&quot;\n&gt; The autoguns aimed at FoxFingers, but waited for the command to fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers reached the side of Destructors ship. he found an\n&gt; airvent leading\n&gt; &gt; inside. (Since bots are coming and going the shields must be down.)\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; scanned the vent to see if it went all the way through. it did and\n&gt; was large\n&gt; &gt; enough for him to squeeze through in beast mode. The bot\n&gt; transformed to fox\n&gt; &gt; and slid into the ship.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
