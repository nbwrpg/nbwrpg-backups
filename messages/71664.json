So many things\n&gt; c=\r\nhange us, move us. Things that at one time seemed immutable are\n&gt; things of=\r\n the past.&quot; He looked back at the stars, &quot;But one day this\n&gt; planet will ch=\r\nange, and the stars above it will change and hopefully\n&gt; what we do now won=\r\n&#39;t change that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a nod from ELDER, &quot;But yes, some of us must=\r\n stay behind to\n&gt; guard the Ark. in a way it is that last bastion against c=\r\nhange.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a thoughtful look, &quot;But earlier you seemed so upset.=\r\n&quot; ELDER\n&gt; was of course talking about the meeting that WHEELIE had a part i=\r\nn\n&gt; disturbing. &quot;Your wit seemed unusually sharp. Is there something else\n&gt;=\r\n on your mind?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWheelie glanced up at the sky, &quot;The more things cha=\r\nnge, the more they stay the same.  Look at us, here on the range.  Look at =\r\nwhat we were, in the heavens where we occur.  The AUtobots, the Decepticons=\r\n. Now the Maximals and the Predacons.  What we were, now are they.  The war=\r\n carried on aother way.  In the ages to come, in the ages to pass, will som=\r\neday they be the ancients watching as their descendents carry the ballast?&quot;=\r\n\n\nLooking up to the heavens, &quot;Is that what we are?  Always at war?  Can we =\r\nbedevil no other fates but what shall occur?&quot;  Pausing, &quot;The roads, the sky=\r\nlanes, all to war.  In the past, in hte future.  Can we never ever find a w=\r\nay to suture?  I see what we were, I see what we are.  I see nothing but de=\r\nstruction from star to star.  It makes me sad, it makes me mope, for being =\r\nhere I see we have no hope.  For even if we do win..  We shall begin the cy=\r\ncle yet again.  Even if we protect the past, the future shall have war, it =\r\nwill always last.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
