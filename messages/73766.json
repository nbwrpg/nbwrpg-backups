The two guards: NIGHTSHIFT and WOLFGANG\nappeared to be, at least temporarily, distracted with something else.\n\nThere were other MAXIMALS as well, but most of them seemed to be\npacking another ship or were generally going about the business of\ntrying to make repairs or modifications to the ARK.\n\nAs BLACKARACHNIA stepped across the threshold, she might even be able\nto &#39;feel&#39; the sensor net close about her. At the moment though, her\ncloak was holding it at bay. It wouldn&#39;t do it for ever, but it was\nstill holding. A single mistep would be a dangerous one though.\n\nInside was the main hall of the ARK. Behind her was the way out, ahead\nof her was the direction of the command center. Between her and that\nstood another problem.\n\nIt was here that the loading of the second ship was being done. LEO\nPRIME as well as NOCTORRO were moving things back and forth and\ndirecting others as well.\n\nIt would not be easy to get passed them, especially if NIGHTSHIFT and\nWOLFGANG started nosing about more.\n\n(OOC: Feel free to bounce off each other if you like)\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
