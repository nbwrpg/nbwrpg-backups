Defection and \nHeraldAngle were laying on tables. The Maximal matrix of Leadership was \nsitting on a pedestal in-between them. Gigatron sat at a computer console. \nData walked toward the Matrix. He opened his chest plate and reviled his \nspark. He picked up the Matrix and yelled so that the mountain shook:::\n\n&quot;Become Now as you did for Rodimus Prime and light my darkest hour!!!!!&quot;\n\n:::The matrix opened and light streamed towards his spark and the bodies of \nDefection and HeraldAngle. Defection Gained his 3rd title, Datamus Prime. \nSuddenly a celestial body that resembled Herald and one that resembled \nDefection, fell from the sky and entered there respected bodies. Each body \nwas follows by a spark. Herald and Defection  got up and seemed to glow with \npower. Herald and Defection said in unison:::\n\nherald and defection: &quot;we must Make Gigatron a keeper. Do you except \nGigatron?&quot;\n\n"}}
