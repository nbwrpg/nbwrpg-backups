Strange, with all your knowledge, you seemed to hav=\r\ne overlooked the\n&gt; &gt; presence of a fellow Maximal. Normally as part of our =\r\nteam, you should have had\n&gt; &gt; some means of capturing a fellow comrade&#39;s si=\r\ngnature and made the determination\n&gt; &gt; that he or she is still within close=\r\n proximity. But what you&#39;re saying contradicts that.\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I will tal=\r\nk to you later, first, all of us need treatment, if we&#39;re to rejoin the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n forces.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns to follow Bump to med bay as does Nightshift and=\r\n Uproar who also looks\n&gt; &gt; back at Legacy with cat like suspicion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot; Ever since he got here, I haven&#39;t trusted that bot at all. What if he&#39;s o=\r\nne of them? A\n&gt; &gt; mole? What if everything that&#39;s happened so far, is becau=\r\nse a shred of intel has been\n&gt; &gt; leaked out from this base? &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucso=\r\nn pauses.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Stanton, I need you to run an activity report on all in=\r\ntel that has come in and out\n&gt; &gt; from the Ark, during the duration of the c=\r\nhain of events which have happened so far.\n&gt; &gt; There may be good reason to =\r\nbe suspicious.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straightshot looks over to the group and returns to=\r\n her work at the computer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Lemme see what I can come up with, thi=\r\ns might take a while. I just hope Cheetor,\n&gt; &gt; Rhinox and Optimus Primal ar=\r\ne still in one piece.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightshift limps along side Bump and looks u=\r\np to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Thanks for the encouragement, we can use everything we =\r\ngot now. Slaag, if it&#39;s true\n&gt; &gt; that we got a mole on board, we&#39;re done fo=\r\nr. But it looks like the big boss kinda knows\n&gt; &gt; who it could be. Check ou=\r\nt Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail tapp&#39;n the ground, his\n&gt; &gt; stiff gait, a=\r\nnd that little snarl on the snout. He does that when he smells someth&#39;n tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I thi=\r\nnk it&#39;s best to keep an eye on Legacy. Tell me if you see any suspicious\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; behavior on his part. If you do, don&#39;t let him suspect that you know anyt=\r\nhing. Just play\n&gt; &gt; along, observe and relay back to me what you observe. T=\r\nhen together with Leo\n&gt; &gt; Prime, we can decide what action may need to be d=\r\none. I think this is long overdue. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads t=\r\no the med bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Agreed.&quot; RODIMUS said as he glanced at LEGA=\r\nCY and then back at\n&gt; TUCSON, &quot;We need to keep an optic on him. I have not =\r\nhad a chance to\n&gt; know him well, perhaps Lord Elder can help you with detai=\r\nls about him,\n&gt; he has been around him the longest.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile SANTON,=\r\n BUMP and LEGACY have all made their way to the medical bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; If LEGACY=\r\n is the least bit uncomfortable with all the optics watching\n&gt; him and all =\r\nthe suspicious looks being directed his way there is not a\n&gt; shred of it vi=\r\nsable on his cold faceplate. Instead he is his typical\n&gt; efficient self as =\r\nhe walked over to a console and began to feed in\n&gt; information.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If yo=\r\nu two will get up on the medical beds.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We can see\n&gt; if we ca=\r\nn get this over with as fast as possible.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time BUMP was l=\r\nooking at LEGACY in a speculative manner\n&gt; saying nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap nods and gets into beast mode.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I wonder what Cybertr=\r\non&#39;s gonna be like when we get home.. Probably not\n&gt; &gt; the same as we remem=\r\nber it. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Talon and gently rubs his head against he=\r\nrs, minding his\n&gt; &gt; snout . Dragons had ways of expressing their love for t=\r\nheir mates and what\n&gt; &gt; he was doing was no different. His feelings were de=\r\nfinitely real, and\n&gt; &gt; nothing would ever change that. But as he closes his=\r\n eyes for a moment, a\n&gt; &gt; vision comes into play. The single optic, staring=\r\n down at him, as he\n&gt; &gt; flashbacks to earlier days when he was just an Auto=\r\nbot. A red optic, and a\n&gt; &gt; gun pointed right at him! And a familiar face. =\r\nSHOCKWAVE.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It shocks him with a bit of a gasp. He looks at Legacy a=\r\nnd then back to\n&gt; &gt; Talon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Shockwave. I was almost destroyed by h=\r\nim vorns ago, back on Cybertron. I\n&gt; &gt; knew it, that&#39;s where I&#39;ve seen bots=\r\n of Legacy&#39;s kind. It&#39;s part of a\n&gt; &gt; memory I thought I lost when I was ta=\r\nken off line and blinded.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME had walked up as well,=\r\n &quot;Yes he does bear a resemblance to\n&gt; Shockwave doesn&#39;t he, the same single=\r\n optic, the same cold way about\n&gt; him.&quot; LEO didn&#39;t look all that trusting e=\r\nither.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a nod from LORD ELDER, &quot;Yes, but he has done more to =\r\nprotect\n&gt; this Ark then most of us put together.&quot; ELDER was talking about w=\r\nhen\n&gt; he defnded the ARK against the UNICRONIANS all by himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER=\r\n glanced at LEGACY and then back at LEO and TUCSON, &quot;But perhaps\n&gt; this is =\r\nnot the best place to discuss this. Perhaps when we have a\n&gt; little more pr=\r\nivacy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meawnhile LEGACY continued to enter in codes to the medical co=\r\nmputer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; windlord looked at the Maximal commanders and =\r\nsaid &quot;then we are leaving to\n&gt; &gt; track Tarantulus and the humans&quot; then look=\r\ning at Rattrap and Percetpor said\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS PR=\r\nIMAL on the other hand walked back away from the ARK and\n&gt; gestured to RAT =\r\nTRAP, WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR, &quot;Okay, Windlord and\n&gt; Perceptor, you two dire=\r\nct us to where you saw the humans and let&#39;s see\n&gt; what we can find.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-C04A6049-0820-455C-AC2A-0DDFB4E3CB45\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson does as instr=\r\nucted and gets back into robot mode. &nbsp;Uproar does the same, next to hi=\r\ns leader. &nbsp;He grins back at him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Is it me o=\r\nr did I see you give Talon that little rub back there? &nbsp;No worries, it=\r\n&#39;ll be nice ta have another family aboard. &nbsp;It&#39;ll make us all the more=\r\n unified.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson nods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;=\r\n I would like very much to start a family, but that also has to be what Tal=\r\non wants.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He looks to Talon with soft eyes.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; I would never do anything that she wouldnt want me to=\r\n do, unless she requests it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uproar smiles.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; I understand. &nbsp;I&#39;d be the same way. &nbsp; So we=\r\n&#39;re gonna go back ta Cybertron huh? &nbsp;I can&#39;t even remember what it loo=\r\nks like, and what it&#39;s gonna look like when we get back.... &nbsp; AAACHOO!=\r\n &nbsp;Sorry.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson sighs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&quot; I don&#39;t remember much of it myself. &nbsp;My memories were stolen fro=\r\nm me, by Cyclonus, according to Straightshot, who actually saw him take the=\r\n shot. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He then turns to Lord Elder and Leo Prime=\r\n.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; if I could have anything returned to me, I wou=\r\nld much rather have had my memories returned, rather than my sight. &nbsp;I=\r\n can still love Talon even without my eyes and see her inner beauty through=\r\n my spark, but I can never remember those before me as I wish to remember t=\r\nhem.

I sure hop=\r\ne the guys can get this off me, it&#39;s worse than having fleas.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local=\r\n artist who specializes in illustration, using traditional and digital medi=\r\na. &nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also specialize in hand made crafts. &nbsp;G=\r\nreat for any occasion! &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Need a great gift id=\r\nea that is original? &nbsp;No problem! &nbsp;Email me at this address and w=\r\ne will talk. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On May 9, 2012, at 9:38 AM, Super C=\r\nyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@gmail.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucso=\r\nn nods but still appears a tad stiff in his posture while looking over to L=\r\negacy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He could sense something but was not sure as to what he was=\r\n sensing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmm.. Strange, with all your knowledge, you s=\r\neemed to have overlooked the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; presence of a fellow Maximal.

But what you&#39;re saying contradicts t=\r\nhat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I will talk to you later, first, all of us need treat=\r\nment, if we&#39;re to rejoin the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; forces.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He turns t=\r\no follow Bump to med bay as does Nightshift and Uproar who also looks&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; back at Legacy with cat like suspicion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ever since =\r\nhe got here, I haven&#39;t trusted that bot at all. What if he&#39;s one of them? A=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mole? What if everything that&#39;s happened so far, is because a shr=\r\ned of intel has been&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; leaked out from this base? &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Tucson pauses.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Stanton, I need you to run an activity=\r\n report on all intel that has come in and out&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from the Ark, during=\r\n the duration of the chain of events which have happened so far.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhere may be good reason to be suspicious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straightshot l=\r\nooks over to the group and returns to her work at the computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Lemme see what I can come up with, this might take a while. I just=\r\n hope Cheetor,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rhinox and Optimus Primal are still in one piece.&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift limps along side Bump and looks up to him.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thanks for the encouragement, we can use everything we got=\r\n now. Slaag, if it&#39;s true&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that we got a mole on board, we&#39;re done =\r\nfor. But it looks like the big boss kinda knows&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who it could be. C=\r\nheck out Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail tapp&#39;n the ground, his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; s=\r\ntiff gait, and that little snarl on the snout. He does that when he smells =\r\nsometh&#39;n that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns =\r\nto Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to keep an eye on Legacy.=\r\n Tell me if you see any suspicious&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; behavior on his part. If you do=\r\n, don&#39;t let him suspect that you know anything. Just play&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; along, o=\r\nbserve and relay back to me what you observe. Then together with Leo&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Prime, we can decide what action may need to be done. I think this is lo=\r\nng overdue. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads to the med bay=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Agreed.&quot; RODIMUS said as he glanced at LEG=\r\nACY and then back at&lt;br&gt;\nTUCSON, &quot;We need to keep an optic on him. I have n=\r\not had a chance to&lt;br&gt;\nknow him well, perhaps Lord Elder can help you with =\r\ndetails about him,&lt;br&gt;\nhe has been around him the longest.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwh=\r\nile SANTON, BUMP and LEGACY have all made their way to the medical bay.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf LEGACY is the least bit uncomfortable with all the optics watching=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nhim and all the suspicious looks being directed his way there is not a=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nshred of it visable on his cold faceplate. Instead he is his typical&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nefficient self as he walked over to a console and began to feed in&lt;br&gt;\ni=\r\nnformation.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;If you two will get up on the medical beds.&quot; SANTON s=\r\naid, &quot;We can see&lt;br&gt;\nif we can get this over with as fast as possible.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the same time BUMP was looking at LEGACY in a speculative manner&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nsaying nothing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods=\r\n and gets into beast mode.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I wonder what Cybertron&#39;s go=\r\nnna be like when we get home..  Probably not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the same as we rememb=\r\ner it.  &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks to Talon and gently rubs his head =\r\nagainst hers, minding his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; snout .   Dragons had ways of expressing=\r\n their love for their mates and what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; he was doing was no different=\r\n.  His feelings were definitely real, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nothing would ever chang=\r\ne that.  But as he closes his eyes for a moment, a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vision comes in=\r\nto play.  The single optic, staring down at him, as he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; flashbacks =\r\nto earlier days when he was just an Autobot.  A red optic, and a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; g=\r\nun pointed right at him!  And a familiar face.  SHOCKWAVE.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; It shocks him with a bit of a gasp.  He looks at Legacy and then back to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Talon.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Shockwave.  I was almost destroyed by h=\r\nim vorns ago, back on Cybertron.  I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; knew it, that&#39;s where I&#39;ve see=\r\nn bots of Legacy&#39;s kind.  It&#39;s part of a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; memory I thought I lost w=\r\nhen I was taken off line and blinded.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PR=\r\nIME had walked up as well, &quot;Yes he does bear a resemblance to&lt;br&gt;\nShockwave=\r\n doesn&#39;t he, the same single optic, the same cold way about&lt;br&gt;\nhim.&quot; LEO d=\r\nidn&#39;t look all that trusting either.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a nod from LORD ELD=\r\nER, &quot;Yes, but he has done more to protect&lt;br&gt;\nthis Ark then most of us put =\r\ntogether.&quot; ELDER was talking about when&lt;br&gt;\nhe defnded the ARK against the =\r\nUNICRONIANS all by himself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nELDER glanced at LEGACY and then back =\r\nat LEO and TUCSON, &quot;But perhaps&lt;br&gt;\nthis is not the best place to discuss t=\r\nhis. Perhaps when we have a&lt;br&gt;\nlittle more privacy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeawnhile LE=\r\nGACY continued to enter in codes to the medical computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt=\r\n;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; windlord looked at the Maximal commanders and sa=\r\nid &quot;then we are leaving to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; track Tarantulus and the humans&quot; then l=\r\nooking at Rattrap and Percetpor said&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRODIMUS PRIMAL on the other hand walked back away from the ARK =\r\nand&lt;br&gt;\ngestured to RAT TRAP, WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR, &quot;Okay, Windlord and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nPerceptor, you two direct us to where you saw the humans and let&#39;s see&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nwhat we can find.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-C04A6049-0820-455C-AC2A-0DDFB4E3CB45--\r\n\n"}}
