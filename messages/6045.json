These charaters include several Maximals...and being the \nPredacon Commander you can bet I am thrilled.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Chordate looked at the Maximals coming and going, moving in and out of \nthe ship he was in command of at the moment. He liked being in control of the \nmovement, and setting up the new base. ::\n\n::: Chordate looked over to Smokescreen and Ramhorn ::: You two, front and \ncenter!\n\n::: Ramhorn and Smokescreen shuffle there way forward. :::\n\n::: Ramhorn ::: Yes?\n\n::: Chordate :::Please tell me why your not monitoring the perimiter of the \nship!\n\n::: Smokescreen hesitates ::: We were never told to....sir.\n\n::: Sir, he liked that. Chordate continued ::: We have three Predacons \noutside snapping pictures of this base like it were a swimsuit modle in thong!\n\n::: Ramhorn and Smokescreen turned to see Doublepunch, Injector, and \nManterror outside. :::\n\n::: Chordate ::: Well? Arent you going to stop them?!!!!!\n\n::: The Maximals looked at each other and ran to the main exit and began to \nblast the hidden Predacons. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast looked to Brightblade ::: Yes Subcommander, you may go on your \nmission if you wish. I think it would be wise.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n:::: Double Punch, Manterror, and Injector watch the two Maximals come \nforward and begin to blast blindly. :::\n\n::: Double Punch ::: Fools! Kil them!\n\n::: Injector laughs as he shoots another Cyberbee at the two Predacons and it \nexplodes. ::::\n\n"}}
