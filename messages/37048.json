The \nAutobots preparing to leave, his chance to take over Megatrons \ncommand, his turn to RULE!\n&quot;I will need more Decepticons if I wish to defeat these Autobots, and \nuhhhuhhh Megatron. I despise that name. He is so weak yet he lived in \ncommand for so many years.  But his time has come. Ha ha hahahahhaha \n(damn almost a sinister laugh)&quot; \n\nHe opened a comlink to Dreadwind and Darkwing.  \n&quot;Dreadwind Darkwing, combine and find the constructicons. They may be \nuseful to our cause. And hurry!&quot;\n\nDreadwind groaned as he walked out of the CR to meet his brother. He \nhated combining with him.  Darkwing rounded a corner and bumped into \nhim.  He also did not enjoy being united with his brother. They \nlooked at each other with annoyance and hate in thier optics.  Then \njumpimg in the air combined creating Dreadwing. The supersonic jet \nroared through the base and out flying to the fortress made by the \nConstructicons.  \n\nNeedlenose watching from afar saw the jet fly out. Turning to his \nNebulan companions said. &quot;Hmm, I guess the Decepticons think we are \nstill unuseful huh, ZigZag?&quot;\nThe nebulan replied to him in an uproar. \n&quot;Nobody calls me unuseful.  I am not a nobody.  I am needed. I am \nneeded for....for....well it doesn&#39;t matter but lets show them just \nhow needed we are. How bout it Sunstreak?\n\nThe other Nebulan turned,\n&quot;Dude, if this means i can ride some Cybertronion waves later, I am \nall for it.&quot;\n\nNeedlenose grinned. &quot;Yes ....LETS!&quot; he screamed transforming to jet \nmode and ZigZag and sunstreak transforming to thier weapon modes and \nattaching to Needlenose.  They flew at the D.E.D base on Cybertron \nand fired a missile at the door. Then stood and waited for someone to \ncome out.\n\nHavotron felt the base shake and a loud boom.  He opened a comm link \nto all D.E.D in the meeting hall.  &quot;What was that.  Soundwave, \ncommunicate the others and meet me outside.&quot; . He then walked slowly \nfor the base door.\n\nScrapper looked out upon the vasses of scrap objects laying around \nthier nicely built fort.  Turning to the other Contructicons said\n&quot;There is a jet appraching fast, maybe Megatron wants us back!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
