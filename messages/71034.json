A quick calculation gave him a true estimation of the =\r\nsize. \n \n&quot;NOW!&quot; Rodimus said as he leaped up from their place of waiting an=\r\nd began to run towards the shield, he holding the device in his hand. Behin=\r\nd him Leo II, Wing Caliber and Ramulus were quickly behind him. \n \nWith a q=\r\nuick toss Rodimus sent his device hurtling towards the shield as he ran up =\r\nto it. &quot;Hurry, we have only a few seconds before the shielding adapts!&quot;\n \nI=\r\nnside the Ark\n \nAll of the medics, Legacy, Bump, Santon and Perceptor kept =\r\na vigil on Nightlight, and for the moment her vitals continued to remain st=\r\neady and strong even in their sedated state =96 her systems were stable and=\r\n running under their own power now. \n \nLegacy looked up, his optic sensor g=\r\nlowing strangely. &quot;Facinating&quot; he said as he stood up.\n \n&quot;What is it?&quot; Bump=\r\n said as he looked over at Legacy, alarm creeping onto his face and into hi=\r\ns voice. \n \n&quot;I am detecting a distant seismic disturbance.&quot; Legacy said aft=\r\ner a moment of contemplation.\n \nSanton looked at Nightlight as if half expe=\r\ncting this to be affecting her. &quot;Where is it coming from?&quot; he said as he no=\r\nw turned to Legacy, for the moment confident that this seemed to have no af=\r\nfect on their patient.\n \nLegacy paused for a moment as if examining his int=\r\nernal records. &quot;Unknown&quot; he said finally. &quot;I would need full access to the =\r\nArk&#39;s sensors.&quot; Legacy looked back at Santon and Bump, &quot;However if this is =\r\nindeed a result of Perceptor&#39;s destruction of his former base then the exlo=\r\nsion was truly massive on a large scale.&quot;\n \n* * * * * \n \nAs Legacy and the =\r\nothers talked, the voice that was speaking to Elita continued talking, &quot;Eli=\r\nta. I am hurt, badly hurt.&quot; It sounded like Lord Elder still, but the voice=\r\n was steadily getting weaker. \n \nThere was the sound of crawling and shuffl=\r\ning. &quot;I was ambushed and knocked unconscious.&quot; The voice paused, &quot;Elita, wh=\r\nere are you?&quot;\n \n\nWith the Maximals on the way back to the Ark!\n\n&gt; &quot;Noctorro=\r\n, Torca, I&#39;ve regained sixty percent of my energy reserve.\n&gt; It should be e=\r\nnough for me to drive on my own now. I thank you\n&gt; deeply for your assistan=\r\nce, and wish not to burden you any further.\n&gt; After all, towing a vehicle m=\r\ny size and weight, must put quite a strain\n&gt; on your systems. I&#39;d rather no=\r\nt see that happen.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; Torca said in deep tones. &quot;We are always =\r\nhere for the Maximals and you Autobots.&quot; His tone was grave. \n\nTorca and Ba=\r\nntor who had been the actual ones to help pull began to come to a slow halt=\r\n. They were not fast as most vehicles go, but they were large enough. Banto=\r\nr was perhaps fully the size of a large jungle cat, but Torca was as large =\r\nas a woolly mammoth and looked strong enough to pull Tuscon by himself if n=\r\necessary. \n\nLooking up Torca spoke to Noctorro, &quot;You and Quicksilver get ba=\r\nck to the Ark. I think we have this under control, the Ark is the most impo=\r\nrtant thing now.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir!&quot; They both said in unison as they both began flyin=\r\ng off in the direction of the Ark. \n\n(OOC: The Maximals might notice now th=\r\nat communications are no longer being blocked. They can communicate with ea=\r\nch other as well as the Ark.)\n\n\n\n"}}
