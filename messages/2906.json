She wasn&#39;t hungry and\n&gt; she wasn&#39;t about to accept a meal from a bot who wanted her dead, she was\n&gt; sure of it.\n&gt; BrightBlade continued to walk towards the base until her scanners suddenly\n&gt; informed her that Hell Beast had moved away from it and had come to the\n&gt; Maximal base.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; WHAT?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *She said to the info that her scanners reported but had just happened to\n&gt; say it a bit too loud. She looked over at Gangon.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hell Beast had gone to the Maximal base, along with most of team.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Her tone was shocked and a bit suspicious at the same time, obviously\n&gt; there had to be a logical reason for it.\n&gt; BrightBlade looked off into the distance and towards that Maximal base, if\n&gt; Hell Beast was there with half of the Predacons that she was going to be\n&gt; there too.\n&gt; She looked back at Gangon but kept her eyes off Lightmare, something that\n&gt; she liked to do best. With that she then began to run/limp off towards the\n&gt; enemy base, opening her com-link to Hell Beast.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My Lord, I am only about 9 clicks from the enemy base and your position.\n&gt; If there are no orders to do other wise I would like to join you.\n&gt; BrightBlade out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fast, secure, free - eGroups&#39; PayPal.\n&gt; Get cash too.\n&gt; Sign up today and get a $5 bonus.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5026/10/_/_/_/960404645/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
