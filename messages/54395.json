She realizes quickly something \nis \n&gt; &gt; shielding Maxima from her powers, and taps into the power of the \nSoul \n&gt; &gt; Orbs to force her way past the block.  She doesn&#39;t like what she \n&gt; &gt; sees, but walks with Maxima anyway, confident in her own ability \nto \n&gt; &gt; defend herself.  &quot;You&#39;ve been talking with Hydras, haven&#39;t you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing sideways at the former Decepticon. &quot;Thought we were not \nsupposed to \n&gt; read minds?&quot; It stunned her for a moment, then she pushed it aside \nas though \n&gt; it didn&#39;t matter. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maybe I have... maybe I haven&#39;t. I went to the base to see this... \nHydras.. \n&gt; for myself. Wheeljack informed me of what happened. Megatron & \nGalvatron \n&gt; merging & forming Hydras.&quot; cocking a brow. &quot;An interesting trick.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Once again, glancing at Empath. &quot;What is your opinion on this \nLeader?&quot; then \n&gt; looking forward. &quot;By what I understand.. he says you betrayed him. \nIs that \n&gt; correct?&quot; She wanted to get to the bottom of the matter before she \nmade a \n&gt; decision or move. \n&gt; \n&gt; She was an independent Decepticon now. Still clinging to the old \nways. & in \n&gt; most cases, her original programming was more evident than the rest \nof her \n&gt; knowledge. The personality of when she was a Political Aide was \nsurfacing \n&gt; above anything else. \n&gt; For a moment, she wondered if this is why Alpha Trion resurrected \nher... to \n&gt; bring peace to them all? Fat chance! She was a Decepticon! She was \nto conquer \n&gt; & rule... or destroy. She ws NOT going to be an Agent of Peace for \nAlpha \n&gt; Trion. \n&gt; \n&gt; She waited for Empath&#39;s answer & reply.\n\n&quot;I betrayed him?&quot;  Empath has to laugh.  &quot;I suppose so, if you can \nsay that about him keeping me under mind control for 300 years before \nI broke free.  What good is loyalty to someone who would feed dozens \nof loyal followers to Unicron just to save his own miserable hide?  \nHydras only cares about himself.  He wants to rule the universe, and \nit doesn&#39;t matter to him what happens to anyone else along the way.&quot;  \nEmpath digs a little further into Maxima&#39;s mind, bringing the memory \nof that kiss to the forefront.  &quot;If you bought it, he&#39;d only be upset \nbecause he lost his newest plaything.  He&#39;s using you, Maxima.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
