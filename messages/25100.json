But Instrat \nhad attacked them, then seemed to become friendly, then finally decided that \nshe hated her guts!\nFor all she cared, a bot that couldn&#39;t understend what people had to go \nthrough to have friends, didn&#39;t need any friends at all. And with Instrat&#39;s \nattetude, she didn&#39;t know if she would ever have any. But, like she had \nthought she would be alone forever, sometimes things worked out.\nCarnage continued to walk as Instrat walked away and Teltoli joined her in \nthe direction of the swamps.\nShe knew that what Teltoli had done wasn&#39;t really right, but where they were \ngoing Instrat wouldn&#39;t like anyway.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
