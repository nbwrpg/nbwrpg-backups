WE \n&gt; MIGHT HAVE FEW TIME...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After that Hydras send an encoded message to Maxima.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maxima,\n&gt; If you&#39;re inside Maximal&#39;s base you have to wait a while before do \n&gt; your mission. If you&#39;re now out or around, move quickly far of it. A \n&gt; cloud is around the base but it&#39;s the Plague. Be careful. As soon as \n&gt; you&#39;re far of Maximal Base&#39;s area  go to this area (gives a \n&gt; coordinates) and call me when you arrive there.
