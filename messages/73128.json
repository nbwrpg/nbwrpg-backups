Gett=\r\ning now that\n&gt; SKYBYTE was seemingly directing them, but holding back behin=\r\nd the fray, he\n&gt; let out a snarl.\n&gt;\n&gt; Going to try and whip up his tail can=\r\nnon to blast a snap shot at SKYBYTE,\n&gt; one of the SHARKTICONS leaping up an=\r\nd latching it&#39;s teeth inot it, half\n&gt; severing DINOBOT&#39;s ARM!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe b=\r\nlast from DINOBOT=92s cannon sped fast and true across the cave\nfloor, movi=\r\nng past several SHARKTICONS including several that\nattempted to intercept i=\r\nt and hit SKYBYTE square in the chest, sending\nthe bot sprawling across the=\r\n floor!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride was getting tired of the Sharki=\r\ntcons and gets into\n&gt; robot mode bearing his over the shoulder blast cannon=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Okay, that&#39;s it, it&#39;s fish frying time!  Heads up Rattrap!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat=\r\ntrap quickly scoots out of Quickstrides way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; FIRE IN THE HOLE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Q=\r\nuickstride now attempts to take out a large group of Sharkticons with a\n&gt; s=\r\nhot from the blast cannon.\n\nThe attack from the shoulder blast cannon does =\r\nindeed seem to have an\naffect as several go down at once, a couple even exp=\r\nloding into\nmulticolored clouds of metal and ash!\n\nMuch like of DINOBOT it =\r\nwould appear that QUICKSTRIDE=92s cannon is\nthinning out their numbers. How=\r\never with SKYBYTE now temporally\ndistracted by DINOBOT=92s blast it takes t=\r\nhem a few moments more to\nrecover this time -- A few moments that the MAXIM=\r\nAL FUZORS use to\ntheir advantage, flying in and attacking SKYBYTE himself!\n=\r\n\nNOCTORRO, among the fastest of their number streaks in to tackle the\nalrea=\r\ndy hit SHARTICON leader while AIRHAMMER and BANTOR tried\nvaliantly to keep =\r\nthe slowly ebbing tide of SHARKTICONS off of\nNOCOTORRO!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwh=\r\nile, VICE GRIP was being gradually..  Chewed apart by the SHARKTICONS,\n&gt; bu=\r\nried in a pile of them and thrashing about, his most opwerful weapons\n&gt; use=\r\nless as he was SHARKPILED&lt; their teeth threatening tos kewer him layer by\n&gt;=\r\n layer!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe SHARKTICONS continue to attempt to maul VICE GRIP, thei=\r\nr teeth\ntrying to grind through his armor . . .  until suddenly they are no=\r\nt!\n\nQuickly, as if stung, they rose into the air going to defend their\nmast=\r\ner who was now under assault by the MAXIMAL FUZORS and, at least\nfor a mome=\r\nnt, DINOBOT!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson concentrates and remains focused as he con=\r\ntinues to match Magmatrons\n&gt; moves simply to defend himself against his ons=\r\nlaught.  He knew his sword was\n&gt; not big as Magmatrons nor was it made to h=\r\nandle its power.  Knowing that, he\n&gt; opts not to use the sword.    Narrowin=\r\ng a brow in thought he quickly goes\n&gt; from robot to beast mode, landing on =\r\nhis hind feet and using his front legs\n&gt; as arms and hands.\n&gt;\n&gt; The sword m=\r\nay not have the strength nor the size but he knew his tail could\n&gt; be stron=\r\ng and long enough of a weapon for him.  With surprising grace he\n&gt; whirls t=\r\nhe tail masterfully into a coil and slaps at Magmatrons sword to\n&gt; attempt =\r\na tail block by slapping it with the side of the skinnier part of\n&gt; his lon=\r\ng tail with a forceful swipe.  His long neck coils back like that of\n&gt; a se=\r\nrpent ready to strike.  Yet he remains calm without any explosive\n&gt; tempera=\r\nmental outbursts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; A worthy opponent indeed.  But can you face me in  =\r\nyour own beast mode as\n&gt; I am facing you in mine?  You seem attached to you=\r\nr robot mode, Magmatron,\n&gt; is there something you&#39;re not telling me, about =\r\nyour level of expertise?  Or\n&gt; is it that because you are contrived of a mi=\r\nxture of creatures that are not\n&gt; known for combative agility?  As you can =\r\nwell imagine, a dragon faces\n&gt; similar weaknesses.  And you may ask yoursel=\r\nf why would a dragon take on a\n&gt; posture that would expose him to injury?  =\r\nOr is it that the dragon may have\n&gt; learned to adapt to such weaknesses?  N=\r\now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a very charismatic\n&gt; individual but, are you witty enoug=\r\nh to step outside the box?  Let&#39;s see if\n&gt; you are.  Come on then, I&#39;m sure=\r\n a beast of your caliber can make short work\n&gt; of a smaller mountain dragon=\r\n.  Show me what you&#39;re really made of,\n&gt; transform, and face me in your bea=\r\nst mode!  I dare you to do the unusual!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nMAGMATRON laughed as TUSCO=\r\nN made his challenge. =93You have no knowledge\nof just who I am yet, do you=\r\n?=94 He laughed again as he yelled out,\n=93MAGMATRON . . . BRUTALIZE!=94\n\nA=\r\ns he yelled his body form shifted, moving from his robot mode to a\ndragon m=\r\node, in some elemental ways similar to that of TUSCON=92S\nalthough much lar=\r\nger and more robust. Armored from snout to rump\nMAGMATON stood up on his hi=\r\nnd legs and flapped his wings in an almost\nleisurely fashion. His long tail=\r\n flipped behind him like a whip as he\nlooked over at his opponent.\n\n=93I am=\r\n taking it easy on you Maximal, showing you your place =96 because\nI can se=\r\ne that you do not know it yet.=94 He chuckled menacingly. =93But\nyou are be=\r\nginning to annoy me with your prattle!=94\n\nHe opened his mouth a breathed o=\r\nut a blast of fire and plasma!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Noightlight took the quills tha=\r\nt fell around her andhide them with the\n&gt; others that Straightshot had give=\r\nn her in the Ark.

Oh before he gets up, think you could blast\n&gt; the roc=\r\nk that&#39;s over him for me?  If ya get what I&#39;m getting at.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She points t=\r\no a large structure of rock that&#39;s over the cave.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTORCA nodded as h=\r\ne fired upward, his firepower hitting the top of the\ncave! With a loud crac=\r\nk stone and rock dislodge themselves and large\npieces fall from the roof!\n\n=\r\nSABERBACK had not been paying attention to TORCA or STRAIGHTSHOT.\nInstead h=\r\ne had been looking at OPTIMUS PRIME who instead of being dead\nas he had tho=\r\nught had just opened crimson optics. So it was that one\nof the large pieces=\r\n of stone hit SABERBACK square in the back pinning\nhim to the ground, its s=\r\nize and bulk totally obscured SABERBACK from\nview!\n\nSmall stones hit NIGHTL=\r\nIGHT as well, but most of them were about the\nsize of pebbles to about the =\r\nsize of golf balls.\n\nAt the same time DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS PRIME were o=\r\nn the bridge\nover the pit battling, exchanging one blow for the other, slug=\r\nging it\nout. Gone was any play at finesse or art, gone was any knowledge of=\r\n\nmartial art or style, it was pure brute strength and tenacity that\nkept th=\r\nese two going.\n\nMeanwhile, above them, over the pit the darkened figure of =\r\nOPTIMUS\nPRIME looked at the approaching figures of the PREDACON FUZORS who =\r\nhad\nbeen fighting their way across the battle field to get to him and then\n=\r\nglanced down at the two figures fighting below him smiling as he did\nso.\n\nL=\r\nooking up at his hands he clenched his fists and with a massive surge\nof po=\r\nwer broke the chains that held him and he began to plummet down\ntowards the=\r\n pit and towards RODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS who were up to\nthis point totally=\r\n unaware of the threat coming right at him!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
