Transforming\n&gt; to robot mode, he raised both rifles.  He fired off three bolts of energy\n&gt; from each, six laser bolts heading out at Rizopas.  &quot;We shall celebrate\nour\n&gt; victory when the river of mech-fluid from you and your companions flows at\n&gt; our feet!&quot;\n\nRizopas barely avoided them when he fell into the pit.\n\n&quot;It already is.&quot; He said from the pit. There was mech fluid all over the\nground, however, most of it was from a few bots.\n\n\n"}}
