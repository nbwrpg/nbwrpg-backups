Her mind had imaged greater weapons, a mega-blaster perhaps.  \nBut...a ball and chain?  Though, she knew from small hints from the Matrix \npulsating inside of her chest that this weapon must NOT be taken lightly.  \nNo weapon from the Deceptacon leader Megatron must be assumed as weak.\nBut since he had chosen his weapons, her sword would be her own.  Though, \nnot composed of energy it had Matrix ions flowing through it and would give \nthe same effect as if she had.\nMegatron had began to swing the mace, and so her own move was slow but still \nmade. She began to circle him, the sword at the ready and her eyes always on \nhis body.\nHer systems would alert her on any unusual movements, dinging in on an \nattack.*\n\n&quot; The new has always replaced the old, Megatron. As fate circles and \nrepeats.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
