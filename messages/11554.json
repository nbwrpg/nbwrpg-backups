It was her some of \nher internal systems fully coming on line.  She looked at Quickstrike \nand whispered,&quot;What&#39;s the matter commander, never saw a bot returned \nfrom the matrix before?&quot; She gave a weak chuckle. &quot;Well, don&#39;t worry, \nneither have I, and I was never expecting it to be me.&quot; She chuckled \nagain. \nShe turned her head to face him.&quot;Hey commander, promise me one \nthing.  When I&#39;m better and can fight again, will you go with me to \ntake out Megatron? We owe him you know. I just want to pay him back \nfor sending us on that fools mission. And I was the fool to take it.&quot; \nShe felt a tear run down her face. She whispered very softly so she \nwas barely audiable, &quot;A damned fool I was. I was following the wrong \nleader.&quot; She turned her head away from Quickstrike. &quot;I should have \njust followed you and never listened to Megatron.&quot;\nShe pulled the pelt up a little further and covered her face.  She \ndidn&#39;t want him to see her face while she cried to herself. She \nthought of Quickstrike as a brother.  She had always looked up to him \nas a big brother. And sometimes felt responsable for him.  She knew \nthat she had almost gotten him killed in that attack.  That thought \nmade her feel ashamed.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike looked at Dark Mouse. &quot;Don&#39;t think ah fergot &#39;bout ya.&quot; \n&gt; he said to her. He ducked his head and walked around to the other \n&gt; side of the table where she was laying and turned his shoulder to \n&gt; her, looking out a the hallway. Where was Black Arachnia? He had \n&gt; questions he wanted to ask her. \n&gt; \n&gt; He slowly turned his head to Dark Mouse, but not completely his \n&gt; face. &quot;Anything ah can get fer ya?&quot; He almost added Sugar-bot, but \n&gt; she wasn&#39;t &#39;sugar-bot&#39;. That didn&#39;t fit her. Black Arachnia \n&gt; was &#39;sugar-bot&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was nervous, but he was going to be a gentlebot.\n\n\n"}}
