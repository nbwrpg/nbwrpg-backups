Celeron felt stupid\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; he fallen for such a simple illusion.  Now he had no idea where he\n&gt; &gt; was, so he just picked a random direction and started walking,\n&gt; &gt; running, and flying.  Taking quick breaks when needed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After about 4 hours of random wandering, making sure that he was\n&gt; &gt; heading in the same direction and not in circles.  He detected a\n&gt; large\n&gt; &gt; metal mass on the horizon and decided to alter course to see what\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; was.  Upon further inspection he found that it was a medium-sized\n&gt; &gt; crashed ship.  It was nothing like that prision ship monstrousity\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; he had been involved with before.  He wasn&#39;t even sure how long ago\n&gt; &gt; that was, or how he got here.  He could be right near the prision\n&gt; &gt; ship, or this place could be on the other side of the planet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His adventerous obcession kicked in, and thinking he could find\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; useful parts, or even some information he located a hatch, opened\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; and began an organized search of the first areas he came to.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
