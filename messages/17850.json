Kitkat killed him. We must get back to the \nRoyalty so she \n&gt; can get her. We must hurry!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron slammed down his cold hard fist on the display. They \nhad \n&gt; discovered his little secret. No matter.....phase two of the plan \nwould go as \n&gt; followed. He wasnt going to let anything stand in his way....and \nwould pave \n&gt; over any bot who stood in his way of complete, total, and utter \ndestruction \n&gt; of the Autobots.\n&gt;     &quot;Terrorsaur! Get in here now!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hell Beast saw the on coming fire and rolled out of the way, \nlooked up, \n&gt; and saw they had stoped. &quot;Cowards. And Kitkat....dont think you \nhave won, \n&gt; because I will have the last laugh. Gremlin, cut that net down and \nbring the \n&gt; body.&quot; He said, standing up and walking over to the net. Indeed, \nHell Beast \n&gt; was going o have the final, and most deserved laugh.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Black Aracnia, Paralysis, Rampage, and Tankkor, waited on the \nbridge, and \n&gt; watched as Megatron exploded before there eyes. She couldnt belive \nit, and \n&gt; didnt belive it.\n&gt;     &quot;Alright, Rampage and Tankkor, you go and have a look around \nfor \n&gt; Megatron. I want him found....and Inferno and Darkmouse had best \nreturn \n&gt; soon!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
