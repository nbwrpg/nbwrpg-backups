I mean that as far as company, your really nice.&quot; She \nsmiled a nervouse smile.  Really, she was feeling embarresed.  She \nwanted to say something to try to help Rex, but she only ended up \ntripping over her own words.\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry. Really, I&#39;m sorry about your friends. If you want to talk \nabout it, I&#39;m willing to listen.&quot; \nShe could have slapped herself for that.
