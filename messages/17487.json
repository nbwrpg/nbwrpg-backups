Her identity and \neverything she once was had been erased. Her past, her history, her \nlife had been wiped clean.  But her training and skill programs had \nbeen saved on a small back up chip and were returning to normal. But \nwithout her memory banks, it would take a a week for her to renew her \nfamiliarity with her training again.  She looked up at Zardus, &quot;Who \nare you? What is this place? Where am I?&quot; she then closed her \neyes,&quot;Who am I?\n\n\n"}}
