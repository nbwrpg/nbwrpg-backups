Beholder was now complete. But Feline was\n&gt; only at 55% complete.\n&gt;\n&gt; She opened up the tank and got the Beholder clone out of the tank. He\n&gt; was very heavy, but she finally managed to get it up onto a table.\n&gt; She opened up the chest panels.  She hooked up an energon IV up to\n&gt; the bot.  She carefully removed the cloned mother board and installed\n&gt; the original board. She then hooked up two cables to the bot&#39;s head\n&gt; and went over to the console. She inserted the memory disk and\n&gt; started to download the old memories and programs. She also installed\n&gt; an anitvirus program. So that the bot won&#39;t get any programming\n&gt; viruses in the furture. It&#39;s programs would remain intact no matter\n&gt; what.\n&gt;\n&gt; She knew the computer would take a few  minutes to finish the\n&gt; download. She walked over and started on the other upgrades. She\n&gt; adjusted the shoulders to have a jet pack and shoulder cannons.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few hours later, she was finished. She looked at the bot on the\n&gt; table.  It was now fully ready to activate. She went over and looked\n&gt; at the spark chamber.  She needed to have this bot working on it&#39;s\n&gt; own and not under another bots control. She went over to the original\n&gt; body of Beholder and took out the old spark chamber. She then removed\n&gt; the clone&#39;s spark chamber and installed the original chamber in the\n&gt; clone.  She then added liquid energon into the spark chamber. Then\n&gt; closed the chamber and the chest panels.\n&gt;\n&gt; With little time to waste, she removed all the connections and IV&#39;s\n&gt; to the bot. Next, she put four electrodes on the bot&#39;s chest. She hit\n&gt; a few buttons on the console and flooded the bot&#39;s body with pure\n&gt; energy.  Three zaps  and she turned off the power.  She removed the\n&gt; electrodes and put everything away. She walked over to the bot. It&#39;s\n&gt; eyes were flickering as the power surged through it.  She knew that a\n&gt; new spark was forming in the old spark chamber.  She smiled.\n&gt; She gently touched the bot&#39;s face and then walked over to her console.\n&gt; She sent a message to Zardus that one clone was now alive and ready.\n&gt; The bot would wake up any second now.\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked back over to the Beholder clone. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
