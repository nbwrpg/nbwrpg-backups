Nightshift should not be able to casually detect\nher nor keep an eye on her.\n\n\n\nI don&#39;t mind if Nightshift maybe have a gut feeling that something is\nwrong and starts searching, or maybe there is a passing scent that he\ncannot quite understand and he starts looking. It gives Nightshift and\nBlackarachnia a chance to play cat and mouse (or should I say cat and\nspider?)\n\nBut he should not just automatically just be walking around and see\nher. Not with a person of her skills.\n\nPlease rewrite this post\n\nThanks\n- Preston\n\nOn 7/26/12, Sandra Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nightshift&#39;s norm was to always have a good skulk around the Ark&#39;s closest\n&gt; parameter.

Occasionally\n&gt;&gt; &gt; several individuals go to and from it from inside the ARK as if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; packing it with things. LEO PRIME can be seen directing matters.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Going along then, stealthily along the area, BLACKARACHNIA ponders. She\n&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t want to risk a firefight yet with the MAXIMALS, but she has to\n&gt;&gt; bypass thier patrols.. So how to best go about that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; She settles back to watch, waiting for the pair to be &#39;relieved&#39;, figuring\n&gt;&gt; that at the moment the two are watching the next group coming out on guard\n&gt;&gt; duty, she can sneak past both distracted groups, and head on in to her\n&gt;&gt; prize..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ARK.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
