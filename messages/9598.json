He had been gone a \nlong time and had not checked in.  She knew he was out there \nsomewhere working out his problems and frustrations.  She wanted to \nbe a help to him and not a hinderance.  She remembered his gruff \nvoice the last time she talked to him.  He didn&#39;t want to be \ndisturbed while following his instincts.  She had her instintcs \ntelling her something was wrong.  She wanted to go out and find him \nto make sure he was OK.  But then she thought she would be bothering \nhim and he would be mad at her for interfering.  She sighed and went \nback inside the ark.  She walked around till she came to his \nquarters.  She looked at the empty room and wished he was here to \ntell her not to worry and that he was alright.  She walked back to \nthe entrance of the ship and waited for him to return.\n\n\n"}}
