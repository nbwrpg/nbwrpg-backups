Many more had joined the \nfight, and he was no longer needed. He looked for a place to go, and \nzoomed his optics a bit father from the battle. Prowl and Iron Raptor \nwere basically scrap. Iron Raptor is trying to get Prowl to a CR \nChamber, but she won&#39;t make it. She needs one herself. Octociz runs \nover to them to see if they need any help.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
