Courage had done well. He had been in the \nscience lab since they arrived. His bots flew off. They put each devise in a \ncircle around the base. It started 40 miles out. So to give fair warning. \nAlso it sent a jamming signal to disrupt a comm unkess on the coded frequency \nused by council members. The  devises where set and ready. They each dug 100 \nfeet under the ground. The dirt was covered over them and smoothed so not to \nbe visibly seen. Then the  devices sent another jamming signal to  disrupt \nany scan that could pick them up. Magnus laughed as they came back. &quot;This \nwill help us exeptionaly.&quot;\n\n"}}
