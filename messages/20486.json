But the Alliance switches a;;ies often, we \ncould be allied with the Maximals soon. You&#39;ll need to think of a way \nto kill Arcangel without giving away your alliegence.&quot;\n\nHe looks the bot over, seeing his resemblence to Arcangel. Zardus \nturns his head as Havoc flies up behind him.\n\n&quot;This femm needs CR attention,&quot; Havoc says, &quot;How soon will we reach \nthe new base?&quot;\n\n&quot;Fairly soon,&quot; Zardus says, &quot;I&#39;m going to fly ahead, you may come \nwith me. But first...&quot;\n\nHe glances at his wrist comp, noting that Feline&#39;s bodyparts were \nstill in the CR (Hot Rod put them in there).\n\n&quot;Can you go to the CR chambers, take Feline&#39;s body out, and bring her \nto the Iron Fist? I&#39;ll take Squizzy.&quot;\n\nHavoc nods, handing over Squizzy and flying back toward the \nscientific section of the base.\n\n&quot;Demolition,&quot; Zardus says into his comm, &quot;Please go to the cargo \nholds and find a box labeled &#39;Delta&#39;. He&#39;s a warrior from the past, \nand I&#39;m planning to revive him. Bring him to the Iron FIst when you \nfind him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; Demolition&#39;s voice replies, the jet flying toward the \ncargo section.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; Zardus says, turning back to Dark Angel, &quot;Do you want to \naccompany me to the new base?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; [sorry for not replying sooner yanshosh my finger is sprain.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Angel\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;the vok sent me here to kill Arcangel and the rest of the vok \ntraditiors. \n&gt; But also I am suppose to serve you so I know you cold gain alot \nfrom killing \n&gt; them so whats your first orders.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [plz remember that he looks like Arcangel execpt he is Purple and \nblack.]\n\n\n"}}
