This is a BIG post...\n\nBIC: Burning Hammer approached Deemos. Suddenly, some shots hit him in the\nback, as he had walked into the line of fire. He turned and looked at\nTermitron, remembering something about how Termitron had been shooting him\nbefore. While he was confused, Deemos pulled a knife and chucked it into\nBurning Hammer&#39;s back, sending him to the ground. Deemos lifted him up\naround the waist, then. Burning Hammer turned around and punched Deemos in\nthe face multiple times while he still has ahold of him. Deemos pulled out\nhis staff. It was the staff he hadn&#39;t used since he first arrived on the\nplanet. He had last used it to kill Lightmare. Deemos planted this staff\nright through Burning Hammer, the staff going all the way through his chest\nand out the other side. He had a flashback of this happening to him before,\nthe person he saw in the flashback with the spear was Aerotaur. Burning\nHammer drew his blaster, firing it into Deemos&#39; head. Deemos shook off the\npain and drew his own blaster while still holding onto the staff with the\nother. He aimed it at Burning Hammer&#39;s head. Burning Hammer suddenly started\nto regain memories. Aerotaur has shot him repeatedy in the head, but he\ndidn&#39;t know why. He was starting to go under some heavy shock trauma and was\npretty frightened by this. Deemos fired at Burning Hammer&#39;s head 4 hard\ntimes, blasting him backwards off the staff and to the ground. That combined\nwith the shock put him into stasis lock. Deemos held a hand to his head in\npain, quite vulnerable on the battlefield now. Airbomber fired 3 shots at\nTermitron.\n\nAirbomber: Just give yourselve&#39;s up! I know you have Arrow hiding in there!\n\nStranato drew a tiny James Bond pistol. The little thing packed a punch. He\nfired it at a rock and the rock exploded to pieces, sending crumbles the\nsize of cookie crumbs raining to the ground and seemingly melting away to\nnothing as they touched the floor.\n\nStranato: I am grand, aren&#39;t I?\n\nStranato fired this strange weapon once at Termitron. At this point, Arrow\nand Perplex left the base. Airbomber smiled. Arrow intended to wipe the\nsmile off his face and fired at Airbomber. Train Wreck stepped in the way\nand took the shot, apparently standing up for his new leader...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, May 19, 2001 1:13 AM\nSubject: Re: Banzai-Tron and Sharpedge: separted at birth?\n\n\n&gt; Termitron::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;By the royalty!!!!!!&quot; shouted Termitron and fired 25 times against\n&gt; Deemos\n&gt;\n&gt; Nighlight was watching outside hopping that that battle ended soon\n\n\n"}}
