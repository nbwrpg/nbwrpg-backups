She moved past Shadow Cat, ignoring her words and \ncontinuing on toward Iron Raptor. As much as the constant attacks were \nstarting to annoy Tavatron, she still enjoyed battles, and wouldn&#39;t give up \nthe chance to participate in one.\nHer feet froze suddenly when Vehement shot his giant blast at Iron Raptor. \nTavatron skidded to a halt, diving to the side to avoid the huge range of \nthe blast. Less than a second after Tavatron sat up, she heard Grimmler&#39;s \nyell over the comm, throwing herself back to the ground.\nThe shuttle exploded behind Vehement, and Tavatron felt the heat from the \nexplosion. Several shuttle pieces flew by overhead, smashing into the \nshields of the Cybertrnian Fire and draining huge amounts of energy. Even \nbefore the ash settled Tavatron jumped to her feet, wielding her staff and \nlooking around for an enemy to slag.*\n\n\nRion/Diana:\n\n\n&quot;Hey!&quot;\n\n* Diana yelled, running after Rion after he tapped her on the shoulder. She \nstumbled on the uneven ground, but managed to regain her balance and kept \ngoing. The scanner was now completely out of her mind as she sped up to a \nrun, going after Rion.*\n\n&quot;Watch out!&quot;\n\n* She yelled suddenly as she saw a large rock right in front of Rion. Rion \nturned his head to look in front of him, his eyes widening when he saw the \nrock, but he was too close and too fast to avoid it. His foot hit the rock, \nsending him flipping head-first into the sand, skidding a bit before he came \nto a stop.\nDiana giggled and ran up to Rion, kneeling down near him to see if he was \nallright.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
