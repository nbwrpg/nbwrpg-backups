He looks over at the source of it and groans once he sees \nMenasor. That was the first non-Alliance enemy gestalt he&#39;d seen, and \nhe&#39;d rather not have seen it at all.\n\nProwl continues to fly up, not wanting to be hit by any of the \ngestalt&#39;s shots. He knew that his missiles would do little against \nthe gestalt, so he didn&#39;t fire.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wildrider followed Dead-End up towards Motormaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speedbreaker had to work hard to pull himself up, then he noticed \nhis\n&gt; comerades, and jumped up soaring to where they were.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hha ha ha haha h, the kid gloves are off maximal&quot; screamed \nWildrider, the\n&gt; voice eminating from what was left of his head. &quot;Stunticons, MERGE&quot; \nYelled\n&gt; Motormaster in a commanding tone. With that he flew forwards, and \nthe rest\n&gt; followed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a circling and complex transformation, Motormaster compacted, and\n&gt; enlarged a bit, forming a large piece of black metal, with stubs on \nthe\n&gt; ends. Wildrider and Speedbreaker both transformed into car modes, \nand then\n&gt; transformed again, gaining feet, and hooking up to Motormaster. \nDrag Strip,\n&gt; and Dead-End both also transformed into car modes, and then \ntransformed\n&gt; into large arms, joining to Motormaster as well. The large body \nthat had\n&gt; been formed twirled around, and then after a large eminating light,\n&gt; transformed, a huge head with horns, and a vacant fave emerged from \nthe\n&gt; top, as well as armor Transforming all around.\n&gt; \n&gt; The huge monster of a robot stoped and soared , standing upright, \nand\n&gt; hovering in mid air. He was huge, and an awesome form, 45 feet of \nrobot\n&gt; hovering above the battle field, staring at the combatants on the \nground.\n&gt; &quot;MENASOR&quot; he pronounced his name.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked around for a target, and noticed Hot Rod, then looked \nsome more\n&gt; and noticed Prow. &quot;MENASOR.....CRUSH&quot; he said in a deep booming \nvoice that\n&gt; could be heard from all around. He raised his arms, and huge barrels\n&gt; underneath were present. He aimed one arm at Prowl, and the other \nat Hot\n&gt; Rod, and Fired, leting huge Plasma energy erupting from both \ntowards the\n&gt; targets, from the air like raining fire.\n\n\n"}}
