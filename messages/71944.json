Well, care to explain to me the Autobot code of honor an=\r\nd what happens when a soldier behaves out of line, going as far as insultin=\r\ng a Prime Officer? You seem to be quite intelligent, go on, tell me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot look to Wheelie in shock.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Looks li=\r\nke a certain little go cart&#39;s in for some serious discipline. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; St=\r\nraight Shot swallows hard.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; His voice, it sounds just like Ratche=\r\nt&#39;s voice when he was ready ta lose it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rattrap watches with amus=\r\nement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ooohhh so that&#39;s where Tucson&#39;s temper comes from. Yep Wh=\r\neelie is in big trouble.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson eyes Wheelie with arms folded in =\r\nhis chest. His stare indicative of Ratchet when he was ready to lose his te=\r\nmper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, Wheelie stood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.=\r\n There&#39;s no such thing as a space bridge that strong. You would simply see =\r\nit from afar, with our own optics the sensors abar. You cannot remotely hid=\r\ne such a hting, in the technology of our time or even that thing. To do suc=\r\nh a thing, to rip apart time, is stupidly absurd, I call it this time. So i=\r\nf you are going to say we should waste our time going after what does not e=\r\nxist, I say thee nay.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wheelie went on, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for=\r\n such a stupid thing, or I will go out on my own and bring. Rodimus is my f=\r\nriend, I won&#39;t leave him alone to face his end. If you are goin to be a bor=\r\non, then I shall call you a nimrod and boron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hissing, &quot;Now, I would =\r\nsay you are wasting our time, on pointless things that we needn&#39;t to whine.=\r\n So I say, I think you want my friend dead today.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the Laurel and H=\r\nardy back and forth of Rattrap and Straight SHot, Wheelie just laughed, &quot;An=\r\nd you bring up Ratchet? Well he&#39;s dead. MEgatron blew off his head. And you=\r\n seem to want Rodimus to end the same way. So I shall now not leave my frie=\r\nnd astray.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And without a further word, Wheelie transformed to his veh=\r\nicle mode, and raced off!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC - This is how I see the character - at t=\r\nhis point, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsense to waste time looking for a Space =\r\nBridge that there&#39;s no evidence of or anything remotely suggesting, based u=\r\npon Tuscon having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s going insubordinate and off on his own.=\r\n TO him, a Space Bridge would e impossible to hdie (a la the third Transfor=\r\nmers movie Dark of the Moon), and so wasting time scanning for it is a fool=\r\n&#39;s errand. So he&#39;s going off to &#39;look&#39; for Rodimus on his own, unless stopp=\r\ned or otherwis einterfered with as he&#39;s afraid that Tuscon is purposefully =\r\nstalling to prevent them from going after Rodimus. He respects Leo Prime, b=\r\nut he&#39;s friends with Rorimus, and he has a very low regard for Tuscon, and =\r\nat this point in his processor Tuscon deciding to check for something to hi=\r\nm that has infinitesimal chances of having been done and stall a gridwide s=\r\nearch is abaondment of his friend.

His stare indica=\r\ntive of Ratchet when he was ready to lose his temper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt=\r\n this point, Wheelie stood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.  There&#39;s no such =\r\nthing as a space bridge that strong.  You would simply see it from afar, wi=\r\nth our own optics the sensors abar.  You cannot remotely hide such a hting,=\r\n in the technology of our time or even that thing.  To do such a thing, to =\r\nrip apart time, is stupidly absurd, I call it this time.  So if you are goi=\r\nng to say we should waste our time going after what does not exist, I say t=\r\nhee nay.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWheelie went on, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for such a s=\r\ntupid thing, or I will go out on my own and bring.  Rodimus is my friend, I=\r\n won&#39;t leave him alone to face his end.  If you are goin to be a boron, the=\r\nn I shall call you a nimrod and boron.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHissing, &quot;Now, I would say=\r\n you are wasting our time, on pointless things that we needn&#39;t to whine.  S=\r\no I say, I think you want my friend dead today.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the Laurel and=\r\n Hardy back and forth of Rattrap and Straight SHot, Wheelie just laughed, &quot;=\r\nAnd you bring up Ratchet?  Well he&#39;s dead.  MEgatron blew off his head.  An=\r\nd you seem to want Rodimus to end the same way.  So I shall now not leave m=\r\ny friend astray.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd without a further word, Wheelie transformed =\r\nto his vehicle mode, and raced off!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC - This is how I see the ch=\r\naracter - at this point, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsense to waste time lookin=\r\ng for a Space Bridge that there&#39;s no evidence of or anything remotely sugge=\r\nsting, based upon Tuscon having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s going insubordinate and o=\r\nff on his own.  TO him, a Space Bridge would e impossible to hdie (a la the=\r\n third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon), and so wasting time scanning f=\r\nor it is a fool&#39;s errand.  So he&#39;s going off to &#39;look&#39; for Rodimus on his o=\r\nwn, unless stopped or otherwis einterfered with as he&#39;s afraid that Tuscon =\r\nis purposefully stalling to prevent them from going after Rodimus.  He resp=\r\nects Leo Prime, but he&#39;s friends with Rorimus, and he has a very low regard=\r\n for Tuscon, and at this point in his processor Tuscon deciding to check fo=\r\nr something to him that has infinitesimal chances of having been done and s=\r\ntall a gridwide search is abaondment of his friend.  Anyways, wondrful post=\r\ning and good luck!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end grou=\r\np email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-57--953382744--\r\n\n"}}
