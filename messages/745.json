Nobot \nbetrayed him and got away with it!!\nJust then Dinobot glanced towards the Ark and saw Rampage enter into the \nship, he snarled and glanced back at Tavatron. She was continuing to fight \nBrightBlade and he knew that she was to busy to bother with the invading \nenemies right now...so it was up to him.\nDinobot wiped the mech fluid from his face and walked towards the Ark, on \nhis way by he retrieved his rifle and reloaded it. It just might come in \nhandy.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
