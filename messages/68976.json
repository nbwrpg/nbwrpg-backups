The ways I&#39;ve seen it done are 1 =\r\n- Your characters know \n\nnearly nothing and have no attachments to anyone. =\r\n2 - Your characters have been preprogramed with some history and depending =\r\non which faction you into first decidedes who you belong to. Or 3 - your ch=\r\naracters have a complete history, knowledge and background already. \n\nYour =\r\ncharacters seem to be partially using option 3, although it&#39;s up to you how=\r\n it can play out. Perhaps your onboard sensor can detect Maximal and Predic=\r\non energy signatures? Autobot/Decepticon signatures should be close enough =\r\nto their counterparts if you wish to use that.\n\nAs for history? Maximals an=\r\nd Predicons generally know about the G1/G2 Autobots and Decepticons, and in=\r\n many places it is generally assumed that a few Autobots and Decepticons co=\r\nnverted into the newer BW type over time. IE Ravage did in the &#39;toon. Howev=\r\ner if you are playing characters w/o history knowledge, then you can forget=\r\n about what I just wrote and play how you feel comfortable :-)\n\nIf I can he=\r\nlp in any way let me know :-) \n\nI hope to be ending the battle soon. I had =\r\norginally planned to use the battle to close a few story arcs, so if we can=\r\n get a few more posts in I can close them.\n\nPreston\n\n\n--- In \n\n\n\ndmyemail@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, sorry about the delay.  It was mom&#39;s B-day and I had to =\r\ncatch up.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I didn&#39;t expect Shard to recognize anyone cuz didn&#39;t=\r\n the\n&gt; autobots and decepticons exist long before Maximals and Autobots? \n&gt;=\r\n This is where my lack of Transformers knowledge is annoying. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll ed=\r\nit my post.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Question though, any way we can wrap this battle up and =\r\nmove on?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercy=\r\nclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Heya! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please keep in mind that Kup has ne=\r\nver met Legacy before, so he\n&gt; might be surprised that this strange transfo=\r\nrmer knows him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also I am not sure where Shard is entering the con=\r\nflict, so it&#39;s up\n&gt; to you if you come out near Hydra , near t e Ark or som=\r\newhere in the\n&gt; middle where Skorpy and Jhiaxus  Cyclonus and Rodimus  are.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
