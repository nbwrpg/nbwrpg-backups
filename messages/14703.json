These Maximals wern&#39;t tough at \nall, the Alliance commander thinks, looking down at the Maximals who \nhad done this much damage to the Predacon cave, and were now being \nshot at by his troops. Zardus was a bit surprised at how soft the \nPredacons have gotten, letting the Maximals get them like this.\n\nHe activates his comm-link. &quot;Predacon commander,&quot; he says into it, \nsending the transmission on a Predacon frequency, &quot;This is Zardus. My \ntroops are currently taking out the Maximals in your area, do you\nneed \nfurther assistance?&quot;\n\nUsually, Zardus would be glad to leave the Predacons to die, but not \nin this case. If the Predacons fell, there would be nothing to stop \nthe Maximals from attacking the Alliance. \n\nHaving finished the transmission, Zardus fires a few more shots at \nDeemos.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWith the sound of gunfire, Dark One, in his jet mode, flies into the \nbattlefield. He flies by Deemos, sending a volley of laser shots at \nthe Maximal.\n\nBehind him, his group runs out of the foilage, opening fire on the \nMaximals. Pyro fires two fireballs at Deemos.\n\nHiss jumps into the air, transforming into his gun mode and flying at \nTestifier, opening fire.\n\nBreakdown stops a little ways from Blender and Stronghold, \ntransforming into an artillery cannon and opening fire on the two \nMaximals, shooting lasers.\n\nScavanger runs at Testifier, firing his chai\n\n\n"}}
