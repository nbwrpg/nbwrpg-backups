In his spark, he\n&gt; could sense the old dragon&#39;s soul, and can understand that he at one time,\n&gt; must have done his best to keep ecological harmony in the jungle.  Due to\n&gt; his failing health he was unable to maintain his authority, and so chaos\n&gt; seemed to take the place of whatever balance the old dragon maintained.  But\n&gt; that would change.  The soul of the dragon is now Tucson&#39;s to keep.  So now\n&gt; he had another commitment to keep, he had to promise to keep the harmony and\n&gt; rid the jungle of chaos, as was the dragon&#39;s personal vow years ago.  That\n&gt; vow was now Tucson&#39;s.  So with a heavy thrust of his left front limb, he\n&gt; firmly puts his taloned foot down and gives a territorial roar.  Come what\n&gt; may he was going to rescue his comrades and win back what was stolen from\n&gt; Old Earth. There was no mistake, the Silver Dragon had returned to claim his\n&gt; place as the Jungle Guardian.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs the jungled reverberated with TUSCON&#39;s deep throated roar, birds of\nall types spooked and rose into the air making all kinds of racket!\nAncient forms of monkeys and other assorted tree dwelling animals took\nto flight as well raising a din of their own. They moved swiftly\naloong branches and tree limbs as the trees themselves shook and\nrattled leaves vibrated and fell to the ground!\n\nTUSCON&#39;s sonar while good at the very short distance did not avail him\nmuch as they spread out. With all the trees and underbrush it was like\na human trying to peek into a house with the blinds closed, but in\nthis case the blinds were spread out several feet across. Even though\nyou could see past some of them, as the distance increase even\nTUSCON&#39;s sonar was obscured.\n\nHowever one thing he did pick up was four large shapes moving towards\nhim, each of them fully as large as he was! While his sonar was not as\nadept as it once was, his enhanced senses were also helping him as\nthey picked up the loud crashing sounds of footsteps of the creatures\nas they approached him and trees cracking and bending as they passed\nby them.\n\nTUSCON was still standing at the edge of the clearing, the terminated\nsweep still at his feet, the lubricant leakage had finally stopped.\nThe shapes were coming from further into the jungle, they were perhaps\nseveral hundred yards away. It was only because of their size and the\nfact that they were taking no precautions to hide their approach that\nhe could detect them at this distance. They were moving straight in\nTUSCON&#39;s direction.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
