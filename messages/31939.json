Holes here and there almost all the way \nthrough, dents and pissing plates. Sore areas smoking, electricle fires \nsomething to be watching out for with exterier circuitry.\n\n* IR sped up, feeling the ground almost fly away under her feet.\nShe was almost right at Divebomb before she felt three charges try to dig \ninto her armor, snarling and turning her head towards FireBlade, stopping in \nher tracks. The charges had hit dead on but they did little but sting, only \nmaking her want to kill something more.\nAnd it seemed that FireBlade was eager to be the first to try her out.\nLowering her chin almost to the ground she looked almost like a crouching \ncat, resting the weight of her torso on her front arms as she set her hands \nagainst the ground.\nShe began to walk forward, towards FireBlade on all fours, her tail swaying \nback and fourth.\nBut all that was before the suddenly opened her mouth and shot her head \nforward, spitting a spray of yellow gew at the enemy.\nAcid!*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
