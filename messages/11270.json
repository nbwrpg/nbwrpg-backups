I can not lead if others do not wish to \nfollow.&quot; She walked to her bed and sat down with her head hung down.\n&quot;And no one saw me,except maybe you.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I just don&#39;t know \nwhat&#39;s wrong with me.  I&#39;m no leader.  I just do what I think is good \nfor me and the team.  Megatron is the real leader of our group.  he&#39;s \nthe one who is programmed for it. I&#39;m....I&#39;m just a soldier and \nnothing more.  I&#39;ve followed leaders to the inferno and back.  But  \nlead by different means.  I care about the group I&#39;m in.  I haven&#39;t \nseen another leader do that before.&quot; she sighs &quot;And even if I could \ntake over the ship, there is always the chance Megatron would label \nme a traitor and kill me, take the ship anyway and I&#39;d be dead.&quot;  She \nlayed back on the bed and put her hands behind her head. &quot;Sometimes I \nwonder if I&#39;m even Predacon material.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Phobia met her at her room looking at the way she carried \n&gt; herself. &quot;Pick your head up, you can&#39;t let the troops see an unsure \n&gt; leader now can we?&quot; he intended to keep pushing the word into her \n&gt; head until she was convinced. KitKat was the best candidate for the \n&gt; job since Darkmouse had disappeared. &quot;You command well, you handled \n&gt; things devinely back there, you should be proud.&quot; The last part \nhe&#39;d \n&gt; meant he was impressed.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
