Lightning bolts shoot out of the \nsky, where moments before there were harmless white clouds. One of the bolts \nhits the rocks, sending them flying everywhere. The remaining pile of rocks \nbegins to shake, seconds later an arm smashing through it.\n\n&quot;I LIVE!!!&quot; the ex-Autobot known as Autofire yells, a second hand smashing \nthrough the rocks, the rest of them falling away. The bot stands up, looking \nat the stormy sky.\n\n&#39;How nice of you to notice.&#39;\n\nAutofire spins around as he hears the voice in his head, trying to find the \nsource.\n\n&#39;Don&#39;t bother,&#39; it says again, &#39;You cannot see me.&#39;\n\n&quot;Wh-who are you?&quot; Autofire asks, his voice unsure.\n\n&#39;I am a Vok,&#39; the voice replies, &#39;I have brought you back, to keep the \ntimeline intact.&#39;\n\nAutofire looks down at himself, frowning at his new body.\n\n&#39;That&#39;s right,&#39; the voice says, &#39;You are now a Predacon. You are here to \nensure that the Maximals don&#39;t bring bots back to Cybertron.&#39;\n\n&quot;And what if I don-AAAAAAHHH!!!!!&quot;\n\nPain goes through Autofire before the bot finishes his sentence, sending him \ndown to his knees. &#39;That.&#39;\n\nAutofire growls, &quot;Allright.&quot;\n\nThe Predacon turns his head as he sees another hand emerge from the rocks \nnear him.\n\n&#39;Your partner, Adrax,&#39; the voice sounds in his head, Autofire frowning.\n\n(Take it from here, JP)\n\n"}}
