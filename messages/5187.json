She snarled at his greeting.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; To bad I can&#39;t say the same for you!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She listened to his statement for them to go along with them to their\nbase, a smile developing on her face as she then put her gun away.\n&gt; It was a bit hard not to notice the huge rifle aiming at her head but then\nsimply shook her head, she had far more to do then just be carried off by\nthe Alliance.\n&gt; Iron Raptor put her hands on her hips for a moment before shaking her head\nagain...giving Tavatron a knowing look to just go along with it.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You know I&#39;d love to go back to your place for dinner but I&#39;m a little\nto busy right now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then chanced something that a bot would say was crazy but she had no\ntime to argue with these...bots.\n&gt; Iron Raptor walked up to Zardus but then shouldered past him, simply\nwalking by Predabot but keeping in mind that it wouldn&#39;t be nice to be shot\nby a giant rifle.\n&gt; With more guts then she cared to admit she then looked back over her\nshoulder towards the Alliance leader.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maybe some other time. Come on Tav, time&#39;s a wastin.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she then turned her head towards the direction of the Ark and\nkept walking, if she could just get herself and Tavatron a few more feet\nfrom the Alliance then they could make a run for it.
