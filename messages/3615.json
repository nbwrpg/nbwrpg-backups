She shook her head but then arrived\nat\n&gt; the base as she was supposed to do and began to patrol it as she was told.\n&gt; Her mind spinning in a thousand different directions, mainly trying to\nthink\n&gt; of why her commander had allied with the enemy.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt;\n&gt; * Rage had wondered about in her normal way for a few days, looking for\nfood\n&gt; and actually getting a few tasty morsels that tasted sweeter then anything\n&gt; due to her hunger.\n&gt; But on the fourth day of being on her own her primitive mind actually\n&gt; flashed towards a section of the past that reminded her about the bots who\n&gt; lived in the huge metal structures, wondering what they were doing in her\n&gt; own primitive way.\n&gt; She had had a bit of a relaxing time on her own again but she wanted to\n&gt; investigate the new bots she had met and soon began off towards the base\nin\n&gt; which she had been led to by a bot named Scourge.\n&gt; The ship was just as it had been before and she wrinkled her snout, it\n&gt; smelled just like before too...like steel.\n&gt; She sniffed around a bit but wasn&#39;t sure what to make of all of it, she\nhad\n&gt; had a bot take her here and it was strange to be there by herself.\n&gt; Rage looked around a bit and kept investigating the area, if any bot\nnoticed\n&gt; her then she was unaware of and was then easy to surprise.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; AUTO & HOME INSURANCE -- LOWEST RATES & BEST COVERAGE.
