I have an idea. You see, the Maximals are getting ready for the\n&gt; Predicon attack and are in no position to fight. They are weak at this\npoint.\n&gt; That&#39;s where we come in. We will make a hit-and-run attack on the\nMaximals.\n&gt; We will be in and out so fast they won&#39;t know what hit &#39;um. We cannot stay\n&gt; long for they have more attack power. This will startle them and leave\nthem\n&gt; open for the Predicon attack. I&#39;ll contact Hellbeast and ask for some men.\n&gt;\n&gt; :: Activates comlink to Hellbeast&#39;s transmission.
