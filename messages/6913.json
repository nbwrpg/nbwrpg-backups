He knew that all Predicons were \nexpendable, They were to be treated like sacraficial lambs, or \nwhatever beasts they were.\n\nWeaponsfire exploded around them like what will one day be Americas \n4th of July, missles and blaster fire hit the shields to dissapate in \nharmless flashes, yhe sky seemed singed from the blazing battle that \nsurrounded them. \n\nPhobia checked his scanners, there were 4 or 5 attackers moving in \nfrom the opposite side to where he&#39;d landed his ship. He hoped that \nthe Predicons weren&#39;t smart enough to scan the surrounding area \nbefore attacking or the ships contents would belong to them.\n\n&quot;All this to stop me?&quot; He thought that the timing of this attack was \nto much of a coincidence. He started negotiating with the Maximals \nright before the Predicons attacked, they must be there to punish him \nfor his treason.\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Mosquitor/The Cybertronian Fire/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; With a battle cry, Mosquitor rushes past Inferno and company, \nheading toward \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire. &quot;DIE MAXIMALS!!!&quot; he yells.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the ship, a missile launcher calmly turns to target the insect, \nfiring a \n&gt; single missile after getting a lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mosquitor&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the missile coming at him.
