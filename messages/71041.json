Swiftly the shuttle and most of the\nPredacons move in the direction that Hydras indicated.\n\n&quot;I am with you Sire.&quot; Inferno, Hydras&#39; self appointed guardian said as\nhe moved up on the other side of Hydras.\n\nScourge and a couple of sweeps moved up to fall in behind Cyclonus and\nHydras, giving him a complete complement should he need it.\n\n&quot;We have everything under control.&quot; Cyclonus said. &quot;However what about\nthe spy that we sent into the Ark. He may need assisance in getting\nout. No doubt the Maximals are going back there even now to try to\nfree thier captured comrades. I got a mesage that He no longer can\nhold Nightlight over thier head, some how the maximals were able to\nrescue her and finish rebooting her systems.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
