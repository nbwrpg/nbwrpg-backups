She \nthen showeda slight sign of releif.  She relaxed her body just a \nbit.  She watched as Iron Raptor turned towards Prowl and tighened up \nagain.  She looked into Iron Raptors eyes and gave a weak smile.\n\nShe siad in a whisper,&quot;My help?  You ...need ..me?&quot;  \n\nShe took a few timid steps closer to the holoprojector and looked at \nthe images on it.  She turned to lok at Prowl.  She looked at him and \ngave him an unsure look. She showed fear towards the bigger male.  \n\nShe turned and looked at the images again. She shook her head.  &quot;I \nhave never heard of nor seen these bots before.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I&#39;m so \nvery sorry.  I know that the Allience is merciless and ...&quot; she \nstopped and hung her head. &quot;I...I&#39;m sorry.&quot; \n\nShe then looked up at Iron Raptor with fear in her eyes. &quot;You want \nme...to..go out there...and have them see me.....I&#39;ll be slagged!&quot;\n\nShe was shaking at the mention of the possablility of the allience \nseeing her.  She looked down. &quot;I want to help...but if they get thier \nclaws back on me......I&#39;m...I&#39;m as good as slagged.&quot;  She sat down in \nthe chair next to the holoprojector and shook.  She hung her head and \ndat there.   She spoke in a hushed voice,&quot;I would go, but not alone.  \nNot alone.&quot;  she still shook a bit.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked at Feline with a warm expression on her face, \nwalking \n&gt; over to her with a sigh. She placed a comforting hand on the fems \n&gt; shoulder-plate. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Believe me, I feel for your dilemma. But it&#39;s alright\nnow. You&#39;re \nsafe \n&gt; here and if you ever need any help then just ask. But, at the \nmoment, I&#39;m \n&gt; the one that needs YOUR help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Her head suddenly snapped up as she heard Prowl&#39;s comment, her \nteeth bared, \n&gt; eyes narrowed, and on the verge of a growl. She would just let the \nlittle \n&gt; comment sit and smolder for a while, then she would let him have \nit. She \n&gt; just gave him a narrow eyes smile that spoke of revenge before \nlooking back \n&gt; towards Feline. Her expression changing back to a heartfelt look.\n&gt; Iron Raptor moved so that she was standing in the area of the floor \nthat \n&gt; Feline was looking, looking down at her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I have friends. They&#39;re missing. And I need you to help\nme find \nthem.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked off towards the holo-projector, it then suddenly \n&gt; activating on it&#39;s own.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; One of those friends is Tavatron, field soldier,&quot; the\nholo-\nprojection of \n&gt; Tavatron appeared on the flat surface of the device in robot mode, \nher beast \n&gt; mode projected beside her.\n&gt; &quot; On the way back to base her signature stopped in Grid 16,\nexactly \n30 \n&gt; clicks from the Alliance base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The projection then disappeared to be replaced by that of \nDinobots, both \n&gt; robot and beast mode.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; The second is Dinobot, warrior and field strategist. His \nsignature stopped \n&gt; the same time as Tavatron&#39;s. Same location as well. I fear that\nhe \nmight \n&gt; have been extremely damaged from Alliance attacks and may be in \nstasis \n&gt; lock.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then brought up the image of Tavatron as well so that \nboth \n&gt; projections could be seen, then turning towards Feline. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s why I called you to me, Feline. To lead a search\nand \nrecovery \n&gt; mission, for those two bots. Would you do this for me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor&#39;s voice had a tick of worry to it, she was indeed \nworried \n&gt; about Tavatron and Dinobot. It had been mega-cycles since she had \nseen them \n&gt; last, wondering just what could be keeping them.\n&gt; She had located their signatures and discovered that they had \nstopped in \n&gt; Grid 16, further research decided that those signatures weren&#39;t \nmoving and \n&gt; she wanted to know why.\n&gt; Feline was just the bot she required for such a mission, new and \nwith this \n&gt; simple mission it would be a good starter. But if she refused, then \nshe \n&gt; would run the mission herself and leave this fembot to her pass \ntimes.\n&gt; Iron Raptor waited for Felines answer. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
