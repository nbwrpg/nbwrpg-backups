As the\nhead\nbanged against the wall and =\r\nfell into the moist earth, mud and dirt\nfell from the ceiling threatening t=\r\no cover up the head.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; VICE GRIP stayed buried.  Dug as deep as =\r\nhe could, letting his fried\n&gt; systems sizzle dand try and patch themselves.=\r\n  He would not be able\n&gt; to join the fight for awhile in his BEAST MODE eve=\r\nna s his sytems\n&gt; went to lockdown and recharge now, waiting to rejoin if c=\r\nommanded but\n&gt; for now exhausted and out of the fight.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs VICE GRIP=\r\n was recovering from his wounds in the battle the battle\nwith the MAXIMAL F=\r\nUZORS and the remaining SHARKTICONS was going fairly\nswiftly. It took only =\r\na few moments, for them to knock down the rest\nof them.\n\nSKYBYTE looked aro=\r\nund, and seeing all of his soldiers dead quickly\nback pedaled from DINOBOT =\r\nas he dropped his blade and raced back\ntowards MAGMATRON!\n\n&gt; OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The b=\r\nats retreat as they return to their roosts. Then, something that\n&gt; Magmatro=\r\nn said sparks an idea in Tucsons directory. What if he could\n&gt; actually giv=\r\ne Magmatron the grand illusion and make it appear that he\n&gt; would turn on h=\r\nis comrades while in reality pulling off the most\n&gt; strategic illusion of b=\r\netrayal and winning his faction a very\n&gt; strategic victory? Instead of grow=\r\nling at Magmatron he stops fighting\n&gt; and nods in submission.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You win=\r\n Magmatron, I can see that your skills far outweigh my own.\n&gt; But I can als=\r\no see that in some strange way, we complement each\n&gt; other.

IS H=\r\nE OUT OF HIS\n&gt; PROCESSOR!?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to face them. He then says som=\r\nething to Straightshot in\n&gt; sign language which she nods to.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Shhh....=\r\n Guys... It&#39;s okay. He&#39;s trying something out of the box,\n&gt; way out of the =\r\nbox. I hope it works. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson gives her a wink and then turns back to =\r\nMagmatron, waiting for\n&gt; his response.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nMAGMATRON watched the interp=\r\nlay between TUSCON, STRIGHT SHOT and the\nother MAXIMALS, especially how STR=\r\nAIGHTSHOT responded and spoke to the\nothers.\n\nThere was a great laugh from =\r\nhim. =93If you truly belong to me now.=94 He\nsaid, his mouth curling into a=\r\n vicious grin, =93Then defeat your one\ntime comrades.=94 He was pointing to=\r\n LEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY who were\nalso looking at TUSCON with wide optics.=\r\n They ofcourse had not been\nprivy to his sign language being on the other s=\r\nide of things and had\nnot been paying attention to STRAIGHTSHOT=92s respons=\r\nes.\n\nThey looked at TUSCON as they frowned, =93And you spoke so ill of\nRODI=\r\nMUS!=94 LEO PRIME said.\n\nMeanwhile the confrontation between RODIMUS PRIME =\r\nand NEMESIS PRIME\nwas seemingly at a stalemate as each of them looked at ea=\r\nch other,\nperhaps seeking a shortcoming in the other.\n\n=93You are weak and =\r\npathetic Rodimus Prime.=94 NEMESIS said in a voice\nthat sounded more like t=\r\nhe old MEGATRON than OPTIMUS.\n\nThen with a quick motion fired his massive r=\r\nifle, his black beam\ncatching RODIMUS full in the chest and sent him sailin=\r\ng off the bridge\nand onto the ground next to the pit.\n\nRODIMUS=92 chest was=\r\n a black smoking ruin, but his optics were still\nbright with sheer determin=\r\nation and will power as he struggled to\nreach his feet.\n\nNEMESIS smiled, =\r\n=93I know you, even now you hesitate to strike because\nyou believe that you=\r\nr beloved friend is still here.=94\n\nNEMESIS laughed spreading his arms out =\r\nas the flames around them grew\nhotter and higher!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus COM=\r\nE BACK!!!&quot;said Nightlight while tears started to fell\n&gt; &quot;The BRIGDE IS CUMB=\r\nLING DOWN!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight made a big esfort and stood up.
