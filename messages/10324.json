Also, to make sure that she would be able to pass through the\nwall\n&gt; of energy that made up the Maximal shield.\n&gt; Attaching the second cloaking device right beside the first she activated\nit\n&gt; and began to move towards the ship again.\n&gt; As she approached one of the massive walls of the Cybertronien Fire she\n&gt; happened to glance to the right and notice two Maximals heading towards\nthe\n&gt; base, simply shrugging and going back to locating a vent opening in the\n&gt; wall.\n&gt; BrightBlade smiled as she spotted a vent, only a foot or so from her\n&gt; position on the ground.\n&gt; With a sigh she looked up at the opening before reaching up and simply\n&gt; pushing the grating in a bit.\n&gt; With a quick eye she noticed that there were no Maximals about, the two\nshe\n&gt; had spotted before out of view from her.\n&gt; BrightBlade then heaved herself up into the shaft, the cover of the vent\n&gt; simply sliding back into it&#39;s last position.\n&gt; She then looked down the vent, her eyes seeming easily into the dark.\n&gt; Now it was time to find a computer console that would be able to give her\n&gt; the information she needed.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
