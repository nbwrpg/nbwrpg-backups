Although =\r\nif someone decides to needlessly piss me off about some matter within the R=\r\nPG, such as how when me and you were making all those useless OOCs I would =\r\ngive them 3 chances, one warning, a second warning, and then a modration, a=\r\nnd if they continue to do the same thing again I would set a motion to have=\r\n them booted from the RPG. \n\n           Also I would also like to let peopl=\r\ne no my motives for joining the council. Although I have been in this RPG a=\r\n short duration compared to some I can see now that the people who particip=\r\nate are really treated like children rather than adults. Seriously, no inte=\r\nrception of weapons fire? Sure it got bad a while back, but you know what p=\r\neople who are on the council should suck it up and deal with the problem in=\r\nstead of just making a rule that cuts down on gameplay. How could someone d=\r\no that? Well one could give them a warning if they were abusing the weapons=\r\n fire interception, then if they persisted in abusing the thing they could =\r\nget moderated, and then if they continued, just remove them from the RPG as=\r\n apparently they don&#39;t wish to be fair. \n\n           What would happen to t=\r\nhe charachters of the abusive person removed? Either A, give them someone, =\r\nB recruit someone to take them, or C Take responsibility for them. Seriousl=\r\ny it isnt that hard to control fifty charachters I have about three times t=\r\nhat in an EZBoard Beast Wars RPG. That is because I control all the predaco=\r\nns as noone not even the other GM would take any of them and the only other=\r\n person who did have some has mysteriously dissapeared, I control around 3/=\r\n4ths of the maximals again because the otehr GM is lazy, and I also control=\r\n a whole slew of custom charachters either I designed and made or someone e=\r\nlse did and are no longer in the RPG.\n\n           Also, I would like to hel=\r\np the RPG finally get off the god damn planet Earth and back to Cybertron b=\r\nut not following the Beast Machines story line. To me the thing was just to=\r\no freakishly annoying and I believe only some of the later first season was=\r\n actually good. Earth has been overdone, and the storyline this RPG was sup=\r\nposed to follow has been butchered and destroyed and looks nothing like the=\r\n story I saw. And as for more charachters popping up from ships? Seriously =\r\ndo you know how unlikely it is that all these ships would be hitting the sa=\r\nme god damn planet? Who here thinks we should move on to something other th=\r\nan past Earth or Earth in Particular?\n\n           Also I find the whole no =\r\nhostile drone rule ridiculous to even have up there. Its BW people undestan=\r\nd there should be no drones at all really. And as for offensive ones? Well,=\r\n They should ask the council first as that would be a logical idea.
