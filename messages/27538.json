Besides we are already outnumbered on this planet,\nwe need him&quot; yells Astroblast. Speedbreaker climbs in and grunts as he\npicks up the shutdown Stunticon. &quot;What&#39;d you guys run into&quot; he stammers.\n&quot;Just some Maximals. A lot of them&quot; replies Astroblast. Speedbreaker\ncarries Motormaster to the edge of the shuttle and Drag Strip grabs part of\nhim helping. &quot;Suppose we were to accidently drop him off a cliff&quot; Drag\nSTrip says quietly.
