What was he \ndoing here? And than he remembered! Someone had done something to \nBattera, making her work of the Alliance! He tried to remove the chip \nthat was altering her, but it shocked him and put him in stasis lock! \nHe had to get out of here. He opened the CR door and crept quietly \naround. He needed to find an escape. Than he saw the vent. It brought \nback memories of the time he infiltrated Hell Beast&#39;s ship. He needed \nto use it. He removed the panel, climbed in and closed it behind him. \nHe started walking through the vent system, and found the one that \nexited the ship at the top. He left and flew and landed on the \nnearest tree. He had to think.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t just leave Battera and Cybershark in there. And who knows \nhow many more decent bots Zardus has gotten to serve him. I have to \nfind away to get in close and change them back.&quot; He thought for \nawhile longer, and than cried out. &quot;I&#39;ve got it! Computer, make a \nback-up copy of everything. Memories, personality, etc.. Put in uder \nquadruple lock with different passwords. Do not tell me these \npasswords. If my personality is ever wiped and replaced, reveal the \npasswords to me 2 mega-cycles after the wipe. There, now I can go \nwith my plan.&quot;\n\nVulois carefully flew above the ship to avoid the guns, and than \nquickly dropped through the vent again. He closed it, and came back \nout in the CR room. He closed that, and than entered the CR he was in \nbefore. He closed his eyes and thought.\n\nNow Zardus, make me an Alliance warrior.\n\n\n"}}
