The impact didnt affect\neither bot. They launched at each other. Magnus held\nhis sword and Galvatron pulled the flame sword. They\nstruck. Both sent equal blows. Galvatron took a slice\nacross the chest whil Magnus took a deep gash in the\narm. Galvatron took hold of Magnus&#39;s arms and bit into\nhis shoulder. His fire energy realased destroying and\nseperateing his right arm. Magnus at the same time\nsliced his sword right through Galvatrons right leg\ncutting off smoothly. The two retreated back wards.\nGalvatrons healed over and stopped the bleeding while\nmagnus still bled. he transformed into the truck. The\npanel came down shooting rapid shot of about 100\nbullets. They hit Galvatron many times. Galvatron in a\ndesperate move shot off his energy blast from both his\nhands. Takeing out a section of Magnus&#39;s left ribs.\nThe two where in horrible shape. Magnus tranformed\nback to robot mode. the bleeding had stopped. That was\nround one. Round two was soon to be finished.\n\n__________________________________________________\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo! Mail - only $35 \na year!  http://personal.mail.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
