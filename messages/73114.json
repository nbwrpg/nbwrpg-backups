SKYBYTE did seem to be giving them\n&gt; gene=\r\nral direction and impetus. While he was not controlling them by\n&gt; remote co=\r\nntrol or on an individual basis, he was acting as a guiding\n&gt; force in matt=\r\ners, directing them to where the MAXIMAL and PREDACON\n&gt; forces were the wea=\r\nkest and exploiting what he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using his superior speed and armor =\r\nDINOBOT is able to begin the act of\n&gt; thinning their number as his hit and =\r\nrun tactics are beginning to have\n&gt; an impact on the SHARKTICONS!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nD=\r\nINOBOT let out aseries of blasts, trying to prevent the SHARKTICONS from ef=\r\nfectively using their vast swarms, even these upgraded models had to rely o=\r\nn numbers, rather than ability to win!  Firing his heavy tail cannon at the=\r\nm, trying to use their numbers agaisnt them!\n\nAll the while, wondering if S=\r\nKYBYTE was acting as thier field general, or there was something amiss here=\r\n and something he was misreading, but for now focused on thinning the herd!=\r\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE blinked as he noted VICE GRIP moving straight through=\r\n the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS coming straight at him. In a quick move he has the\n&gt; SHA=\r\nRKTICONS converge on his position in an effort to pile up on the\n&gt; approach=\r\ning VICE GRIP!\n&gt; \n&gt; However that maneuver also has the affect of further th=\r\ninning out the\n&gt; ranks as they focused on the center. It is at that point t=\r\nhat the\n&gt; MAXIMAL FUZORS begin to act, their teeth and claws ripping throug=\r\nh the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS, spreading out and attacking left and right creating an=\r\n\n&gt; explosion of confusion that SKYBYTE was having trouble directing.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOf course, VICE GRIP went down over in the huge pile.  His superior =\r\nstrength and skill wer eonly good..  To a point.  As the huge pile went on =\r\ntop of him, his heavy armor was dented, rended, stirpped away as the PREDAC=\r\nON WARRIOR tried to smash, split, bash, blast, and blitz his way up through=\r\n the pile, but he seemed to be piled over them ever deeper now!\n\n\n"}}
