I could use some rest. But this has to \nbe done. I have to finish this first.&quot; She looked at Drillbit and \nsmiled again at him. She took the piece of paper with her room on it, \nand then up at Destructor. She stood up and stretched. &quot;You sure, I \ncan stay and complete this.  We need to know all we can about this \nspark. if we can figure out how he cloned hismelf we might find....&quot; \nshe stopped as a horrible thought crossed her mind. She sat back down \nwith a fearfull look on her face. She muttered,&quot; By the matrix,no. Oh \nno.&quot; she stared at the floor. She thought how this might be the start \nof a clone war. She didn&#39;t move.  Her mind went into different \ndirection.  She wondered if Megatron could clone two to three bots, \nwhat&#39;s stopping him from cloning an army. He could over run the \nplanet with clones. Her breathing rate increased as she continued to \nthink on this. That If all the groups were to start cloning, no one \nwould know the real from the clone. No one would be safe. You kill \none bot and four thousand clones would follow. \n\nShe shook her head to clear her thoughts, but the threat of the \nclones consumed her mind.  She wondered if Megatron found a way to \nperfect the cloning, he could create dozens of armies, armies of \nMegatrons. She felt the color drain from her face, but still stared \nat the floor. She muttered,&quot;By the matrix, we can not.....allow \nthis.  He....He must be stopped.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  He saw how tired she was and felt a little concerned..&quot;I&#39;ll finish \nup here, \n&gt; I want you to get some sleep.
