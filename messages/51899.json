I&#39;m taking \na leap of faith and hoping I&#39;m doing this right. Or at least in a \nsemi-acceptable form. \n\nSmidgen:\nDuring a routine flight on a small cargo vessel, the StarSkipper, \nthings appeared normal.  Smidgen was piloting the small craft from a \nmoon 97 light years from her home world Tinkitry.  The ship was \ncarring the latest shipment of energon that had been mined from the \nmoon. It may not have seemed like a lot, but it would have supplied \npower to more than 80 cities for a year.  Energon mining was a very \nslow proccess.  It took the miners 8 months to mine this much. \nSmidgen sat back and rested her small feet on the console.  She \nyawned and put her hands behind her head. &quot;Yeah, this is the life.  \nNo worries. No hurries.  Nothing to do but die of  bordom and wait \nuntill my application for the HonorGuard to be accepted.&quot;  The \nHOnorGuard was an elite fighting group.  They protected the capital \nand those in power.  She had always dreamed of being a  guard when \nshe was a little bot.  But for now she would have to wait \npatiently.  Although patients wasn&#39;t her strongsuit, she tried to \nremain calm. The long and boring flight was taking it&#39;s toll.  Cargo \nships weren&#39;t known for thier speed.   She was about to put the ship \non AUTO PILOT when the ship shook violantly.  She regained control \nof the helm and checked her instruments.  A hole in spacec appeared \noff her port bow.  &quot;I thought black holes were supposed to be so \nblack that you couldn&#39;t even see them?&quot;  She felt the ship being \npulled towards the hole.  She was being forced up against the inside \nof her chair by the g-forces as the ship was being sucked \nin.  &quot;DAMN! Got....to...get this...puppy out...of here.&quot;  SHe bould \nfeel herself starting to black out. She reached up and hit the auto \npilot button, but the force of the hole was too great. The ship sped \nup and slipped into the hole.  For Smidgen, there was darkness.   \n\nShe awoke still in the chair of the ship.  She rubbed her optics and \nlooked around.  Sitting forward, she tried to regain power and \ncontrol over the ships systems.  Nothing worked. &quot;Oh just swell.  \nHow am I going to make my delivery on time now Huh?&quot;\n\nShe looked out the front windows and noticed that there were \nbranches sticking through the shield.  She got up out of the chair \nand walked to the back to check on the cargo.  The ship rocked back \nand forth as she walked the length of the small ship.   &quot;Uh, that \ndoesn&#39;t feel right.&quot; She walked back to the front and looked out the \nwindow.  It dawned on her that the ship was stuck in a giant tree. \nShe estimated she was about 100 feet up or so.  She swallowed hard \nand very slowly sat down in her chair. &quot; Oh boy. Now what?&quot;  She \ncarefully reached over to a small red panel in the middle of the \nconsole.  Pressing a red button, she activated the distress/homing \nbeacon on the ship.  With luck, her friends would find her soon and \nshe&#39;d be able to get the shipment to it&#39;s destination. &quot;Heh, better \nlate than never I guess. At least I&#39;m in one piece. But where the \nheck am I?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
