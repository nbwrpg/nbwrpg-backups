Suddenly coming to a halt he \n&gt; yelled &quot;WHO DARES TELL THE GREAT HAVOTRON TO STOP.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; After the dragon landed he listened contently.  &quot;You, may, join the \n&gt; ranks of the D.E.D.  Decepticons for Earth&#39;s Domination....or \n&gt; Demise...  I am Lord Havotron, leader of the D.E.D, and future ruler \n&gt; of the universe. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Needlenose looked at the dragon eerily.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile back with the Contstructicons.  Scrapper looked to the \n&gt; speck in the distance that was Havotron.  &quot;Constructicons, listen \n&gt; to me....Havotron has not been fair to us, mad because one of our \n&gt; ranks could not complete the joining into the gestalt.  Would \n&gt; Megatron, no I don&#39;t beleive so.  I have devised a plan, to bring the \n&gt; real leader of the Decepticons back to power, we, the \n&gt; Constructicons will re-join with Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  Cyberwolf, the D.E.D are another faction of Decepticons, \n&gt; with the leader Havotron.  Thier base is inside of Mt Fuji, not with \n&gt; the other Decepticons which base is now moving slowly through \n&gt; Hudsons bay.\n\n\n"}}
