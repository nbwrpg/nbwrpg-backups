Since when did this strange occurance happen in which he was not aware of, he had not known that there had been an actually schedualed alliance of the two factions. Dinobot looked up into the air at Nemesis but kept his weapon pointed towards the ground, if they were allied with them then they were not the enemy and, thus, not worth the waste of ammunition. He then forgot about the flying bot in which had damaged him so and then looked off towards Scavenger�the crash of landing on his tires clearly heard across the field above the weapons, he was an Alliance member as well and was also not worth the waste of weaponsry. Thus both Nemesis and Scavenger were safe from his wrath for now, the feeling of the fact that the alliance wouldn�t last for long now forming.\nDinobot turned away from the transformers in which he knew now as more help then threat and was just about to search for a more suitable target in which was not allied with the Maximals when he was suddenly hit by the missile  \nSent from Pyro!\nWith a surprised snarl he was thrown back from the explosion, his weapon landing somewhere off in the raging battle. He had no idea of what had just happened as his back suddenly hit something hard but then slid down to lay on something, a throbbing pain in his head beginning to form as he sat up and looked around. He shook his head as he then looked down at the ground but then looked puzzled as he then noticed that it was metal underneith him and not dirt�no wonder it had hurt so much when he had hit�he was sitting on a hood!\nDinobot looked behind him at a windshield and then realized just what he had struck and was now sitting on�Scavenger! With a snarl he painfully hopped off of Scavenger�s hood but his back complained with a small crack that nearly caused his legs to feel numb, keeping an optic on him but then looking back out onto the field. If they were allied now then with him standing right beside of Scavenger without drawing a weapon would prove that he now knew that he was on their side, just hoping that the Alliance member would know it and not suddenly draw his own weapons and fire at him at point-blank range.\nDinobot took a few steps away from Scavenger, he didn�t like any of the Alliance members and knew the trouble in which they had caused in the past�and he wasn�t going to pretend that he liked them either! With a quick optic but with, not so quick, reflexes he spotted his rifle and made a quick grab at it. He looked it over in his claws before looking back out into the field, limping a bit as he then moved away from the Alliance member and towards the fight again. Seeing Hades he growled and raised his weapon to a point that it was no sighted towards his shoulder, now this bot he knew wasn�t an Alliance member and was thus�fair game! With a growl deep in his throat Dinobot pulled the trigger of the rifle, over 12 charges erupting from the berrle and heading straight for the enemy.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
