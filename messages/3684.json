Prowl \nwas mad, very mad, and that was very unusual for him, ussually being a \nlogical bot. He ducks again as a battle cry sounds behind him, Annihilator \nflying over his head to land on Killer, rendering the already damaged Killer \nunconscious.\n\nAnnihilator stands up to face Prowl and lunges at him, sword slashing.\n\n"}}
