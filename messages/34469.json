With our sensors we can run on silent and\nuse drill bit to get us under the sheilds without them\nknowing it. This way with the element of surprise we\ncant lose. That would be a good time for Klank and the\ndestroctocons to use thier many talents.&quot;\n--- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;     &quot;With all due respect, I am the strategist, you\n&gt; lead on the battle field. \n&gt;  Your plan is good but it has flaws.  For one thing\n&gt; the distraction has no \n&gt; way to get away if something should go wrong.  His\n&gt; heavy armament is better \n&gt; suited for the main attack. The Destrocons make a\n&gt; better distraction because \n&gt; they can hit and run.  They also have flight\n&gt; capability making them more \n&gt; maneuverable.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
