The file had not been totally\nuploaded, but it was not an essential part. The protoform was now\nfully awake and knew what was happening around.\n\nMore out of instinct than by real malevolence, it sent a wave of\ndistress on Darkangel&#39;s mind. It could freeze him in place and leave\nhim shaking, but the effects were variable depending on many factors.\nHowever, it was a disturbing sensation that would likely leave him\nrestless.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Darkangel : : \n&gt; He recieved the comm message from Tyrael, and opened a return channel. \n&gt; Darkangel: Understood. I&#39;ll begin work on this right away. \n&gt; Darkangel got the pod he had returned with ans set it up in a lab,\nconnected to the computer system. First he got the black canister and\nunloaded it&#39;s contents into the pod, so it would be part of the\nprotoform. That was easy. Now Darkangel was at the keyboards running\nthrough millions of files looking for the correct one. \n&gt; Finally after about ten minutes he found Burrock.dna on the system.\nHe selected the file and began to upload it into the pod.

I want you to create this new bot I\n&gt; was talking about, since I can&#39;t be there right now. Go into the lab\n&gt; with a blank stasis pod and download the Burrock.DNA file in it. Then,\n&gt; include the black canister to its composition. Contact me when our new\n&gt; soldier is born.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
