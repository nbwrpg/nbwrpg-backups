Then, he felt two missiles hit his butt.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;OW!&quot; Surgital yelled, jumping up a little, and rubbing his\nbutt with his two hands. :)\n&gt; \n&gt;         Then, the big one hit him.  The blast from the fusion cannon\nwas a weapon that was actually a match for him.  It hit him in the\nback, and charred his back plating, as well as left a few small\nscratches.  The gestalt wasn&#39;t sure how much he could take.  But\nunlike everybody else, he wouldn&#39;t seperate, yet...\n&gt; \n&gt;           Surgital lifted up his leg, then, with all his might, sent\nit down to the ground, attempting to crush Cledar.\n\n\n"}}
