He looked up to the sky, as if it \nheld the answer....\n    &quot;Kitkat, I belive I have just made a descicion that will change my life, \nhow ever long it may be.....&quot; He trailed off, without saying his little catch \nphrase. &quot;So be it, the Predacons will rule this planet. The Allience shall \nfall before us, just as the Maximals will be crushed under the heel of our \nboot. The Iron fist of Predacon rule has been long missed. It is time for us \nto take hold of this planet...once and for all. Yes.....&quot; \n    Megatron now smiled. As did Aracnia. Three forces, together at last, that \nwill see the downfall of two empires, and several pathetic factions that \nshould have been weeded out long ago.\n    &quot;Now that things are settled, when shall we take on the Allience? my \ntroops can be ready and mobil in less than an hour. &quot;Aracnia said, letting \nher claw slide across her womb, filled with another bos spark.\n\n"}}
