I had some previous contact with the crew several\n&gt; megacycles ago when I assisted them with repairs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The bot was rather short.  A metalic green color with red accents.  He\n&gt; didn&#39;t seem at all concerned that he was standing among all these Maximals\n&gt; and Autobots.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The ship sunk to such a depth that it was impossible for me to access it\n&gt; with my limited equipment.  If the hull is intact, there may be survivors.\n&gt; There&#39;s also a chance that the surviving prisoners escaped to the surface.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME watched the newcomer carefully, his optics glittering as he\nstraighted.\n\n&quot;He is emmitting a Predacon energy signature.&quot; LEGACY said as he stood\nfrom his position to the side of the stage. &quot;And another ship is\narriving as well - this one with seeming Maximal energy signatures.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from LEO PRIME, &quot;Good, see to it that the others are let in.&quot;\n\nAs they talked, TORCA and NOCTORO moved to the sides of the room,\nwatching CELERON. While they had no weapons out, they were clearly\nreay for any trouble.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile...\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Perseus circled the area in their shuttle then landed.  He and a\n&gt; Maximal guard walked toward the meeting.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs PERSEUS and his guard approached a door in the Ark opened to allow\nthem entrance. The meeting was actually taking place just inside, so\nthey would be aware of CELERON&#39;s presence as well as everyone else who\nwas still present. as well as what LEO PRIME was saying to CELERON.\n\nLEO PRIME turned back to CELERON, &quot;Tell me, why did you, a Predacon,\nbring this to our attention? I would think that this would work in\nyour favor, perhaps use the confusion to accomplish whatever you have\nin mind.&quot; His face was registering more curiousity than distrust at\nthis point, although his manner was a bit reserved.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
