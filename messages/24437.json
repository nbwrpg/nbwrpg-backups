He loved the peace \nand quiet. Everyonce in a while he heard a Maximal call on his comm. \nApparently they were in a battle. And apparently it was getting worce for \nthem. \nTriceradon sighed. Maybe he should go and help them. \nBut it was so peacefull and quiet here. \nHe quickly shook his head. How could he even think about staying here when \nhis fellow Maximals were in trouble? I must help them, he decided. He got up \nand called into his comm, &quot;Don&#39;t worry fellow Maximals. I&#39;m coming.&quot; he said \nas he headed toward their location. \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
