Their circumstnaces were equally\n&gt; precarious..  But, he reviewed his mental files on TARANTALUS.  Yes, the\n&gt; best way to get the SPIDER to respond was to bait him, and see if he\n&gt; overplaid his hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, TARANTALUS..&quot;  DINOBOT casually gestured, &quot;Hasn&#39;t it always been that\n&gt; way?  A hole in time, a tessaract reforming.  What makes this new one so\n&gt; special then that only you have the..&quot;  He hissed, &quot;Knowledge to patch it.\n&gt; And if you have this knowledge, convenient that it only comes to play now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT went on &quot;So, obviously this new rip cannot renmotely be such a\n&gt; graphic threat as you say then, for if it was you would have already fixed\n&gt; it to preserve your own spark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A challenge of his capabilities, a smidgen of bait left, to see if the\n&gt; SPIDER&#39;s propensity for monologuing would catch and respond to it.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANTULUS hissed as he stood up, &quot;How dare you question my knowledge\nand ability.&quot; His optics were darkening with anger. &quot;We are dealing\nwith something far more than just a doorway. We are dealing with a\ntear, one that grows as long as we stay here on this ball of dirt.&quot;\n\nSKYSHADOW was also listening intently as ANTAGONY spoke, a he found\nthis interesting and somewhat unsettling. The doorway made him\nuncomfortable enough, but a tear? Then he looked around as he noted\nseveral missing figures, one was FRACTYL who might have some\ninfromation on this , but also HYDRAS&#39; most loyal soldier INFERNO.\n\nThe ebony colored ANTAGONY crossed her arms casually over her chest,\n&quot;There is something that may stop it.&quot; Her tone dark and vaguely\ndissmissive of TARANTULUS, but carefully hidden. &quot;It is called a\nZeta-Hypercube.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
