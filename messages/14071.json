He\nflew back but got up again.  Suddenly, he saw GoldenEye being hit, and not\nretreating, still going after Deemos.  What was she doing?????  They\ncouldn&#39;t afford to lose a Predacon.  He couldn&#39;t afford to lose someone whom\nhe cared for deeply.  He didn&#39;t know what to do.  Then, it hit him again.\nAnother image of the bot, the beautiful bot.  Danger....Still\ndanger.....Then it told him.  Dollen looked at GoldenEye, going towards\nDeemos.  Yes, she was strong, she could make it.  He had faith in her.  He\nhad to let her be, to make her own choice.  He saw Blender dragging\nStronghold and Diskus.  Then he saw Airbomber, Infectra and Time Warp, and\nZava come along.  OH NO!!!!!!  THESE MAXIMALS AND CHOSEN ONES WERE FUCKIN\nASS LUNATICS!!!!!!!(Please excuse my anger in its own language)  Dollen\ncouldn&#39;t take it any more, he wipped out his missile gun, fired 1 missile at\nDeemos, 1 missile at Blender, 1 missile at Airbomber and 1 missile at Zava,\nscreaming in rage.\n\n\n"}}
