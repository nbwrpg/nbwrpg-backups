There wasn&#39;t anything there. He proceeds forward, constantly scanning, though it wasn&#39;t doing much good. They were walking through a fairly small hallway, completely dark except for the lights off of Zardus&#39;s gun. The sound of water dripping echoed down the hallway.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::They followed Zardus close, both with their guns ready in case anything \n&gt; happened::\n\n\n"}}
