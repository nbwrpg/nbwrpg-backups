He walked out and \nlooked Hell Beast in the face :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Can I help you with something?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Yes, weve come to search your quarters. Move, or get moved.\n\n::: Megatron moved and Hell Beast, Jackle, and a healdess Inferno entered. \nThey searced there room, and Inferno placed his head back on to his neck. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Satisfied?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: we both know that I dont like you, and you dont like me. I \nwant you gone, dead, away from here.\n\n::: Megatron ::: What are you gonna do about it?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: For now, nothing. But were watching you.\n\n::: Jackle nodded and with Inferno they continued to search the ship. After \nthe door closed Megatron turned to his followers :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: we need to find a base of our own....no doubt theyve planted \nsome kind of spy device in here. Dark Mouse, instead you are to take \nScorpinox and find a suitable lair or base.\n\n::: With out there reply, Megatron walked to the supply closet and opened the \ndoor to reveal the hidded stasis Pod. He wondered how they were going to move \nit, and where. :::\n\n"}}
