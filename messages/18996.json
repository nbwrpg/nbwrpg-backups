Deemos, shocked at\nthe actions of Stronghold. He is silent as several shots hit him from\nbehind. Deemos turns around and looks at Zardus, as if saying &quot;What do you\nwant? Are you stupid?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Flying over the battlefield, Havoc tries to find a suitable target.  Every\n&gt; Mafia member seemed to be being slaughtered or attacked by one or another\nof\n&gt; the Alliance members. He sees Zardus fire at Deemos, smiling internaly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;WarMachines,&quot; he says as he dives at Deemos, his siren screaching as he\n&gt; drops a few bombs at the bot, &quot;We combine in one cycle. Get ready.&quot;\n\nDeemos growls as everyone opens fire on him.\n\n&quot;A tactical retreat is in order.&quot; Deemos says. He fires a beam with the\npower of a lightning bolt at Zardus, it was all he had. Deemos retreats\nthrough the forest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor recieves Havoc&#39;s orders, flying past a few autogun shots, one\n&gt; digging into his side.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seeing the Mafia base&#39;s shields go back online, he fires two missiles,\nthem\n&gt; along with several dozen rapid fire shots streaming at the shields.\n\nOOC: Sigh, base damage again.\n\nBIC: Base damage: The base gets some damage as usual, but nothing serious.\nThe autoguns are hit, but being big autoguns, they returned fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
