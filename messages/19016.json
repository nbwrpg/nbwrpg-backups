He was a bit \nsurprized, he had had no idea that there were any drains whatsoever \nin the base that he had spent most of his life on earth in.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, putting away his gun. He knew it would be \nuseless to try and hit something so small anyways, and there were \nalways autoguns and Threadshot and Catgut in case of trouble, &quot;I \ngotta admit that yer good, but I neve&#39; said that I wanted ya dead.&quot;\n\nHe frowns at the drain, &quot;And don&#39;t bother with that thing, a command \nfrom me can lock it up.&quot;\n\nIn truth, he had no idea if the drain even had a locking system, he \nhad never seen it before.\n\n&quot;Anyways, you look like yer a bot who knows what she&#39;s doin&#39;. I think \nI said before that the Alliance is the superior faction on the \nplanet, I think you&#39;d do well with us. Ya got my word that I ain&#39;t \ngonna shot at ya no more if you come along peacefully. If ya give me \na fight, I&#39;m gonna shut that drain, sick the autoguns on ya, and \nwe&#39;ll see where we get from there.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Diamond::\n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed into bot and stood up, leaning against the wall for \n&gt; support.  She was an assassin, not a muscled warrior.  &quot;Oh yeah, \n&gt; that&#39;s rich. You don&#39;t want to hurt me, you just want to kill me. \nI&#39;m \n&gt; not ready to meet the matrix yet.  I escaped from the Predacon \n&gt; council, and I&#39;ll get out of here.&quot; she looked and hoped she would \n&gt; find something.  She looked out into the middle of the cargo bay \nand \n&gt; found just what she was looking for.  A small floor drain.  The \nlast \n&gt; place that they would think to find her and with luck, it would \nlead \n&gt; outside.  She transformed into rattle snake and slithered towards \nthe \n&gt; drain.  She had a little trouble pulling the cover off the drain, \nbut \n&gt; kept talking to cover up audiably waht she was doing and hopefully \n&gt; buy enough time for her to get away.  &quot;You know, if things had been \n&gt; different, I think I could have fallen for a bot like you.  I like \n&gt; you.  Your as efficiant a killer as I.  Had we met up on Cybertron, \nI \n&gt; think we might have made quite a pair.&quot;  She almost had the cover \noff.\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a shame that you want me dead so badly. I think we \ncould \n&gt; have made a good team.&quot; A little more and the cover would be off.\n\n\n"}}
