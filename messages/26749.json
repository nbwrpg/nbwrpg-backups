First of all, JP, practice\nwhat you preach! And you, Slawdogg, who has beena huge thorn in my side a\nlong time. You get mad at RoboRick for his language, and JP, you don&#39;t get\nmad at him. Because he is a moderator, perhaps? Why do you speak that way to\na friend of mine? Is this a way to get revenge on me and my friend Alloran?\nTo speak bad about our friend minime_316? Let me add my opinion, you\nprobably won&#39;t like it. JP is a good RPer indeed, but he&#39;s self absorbed in\nhis own storylines and ignores everyone else&#39;s imput. Don&#39;t e-mail me saying\nany differently, I am not saying he is bad because of that, but pay\nattention here. I tried my hardest to help out the Predacons before, but JP\nset my guys guard duty and left them there for a month. I e-mailed him every\nweek, sometimes more, and he never replied. I e-mailed minime, he replied\nand paid attention to my characters, and even changed his storylines so that\nmy guys can get in on the action. Just my example of the lovely RPGer minime\ntruly was, thank you. (Please note, I didn&#39;t insult JP even one time, just\nstated a fact. And no, JP, you can&#39;t make an excuse for not answering my\ne-mails...And have a good life, when you die we will ridicule you, remember\nthat we will treat you how you treated minime, got that?...)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 02, 2001 6:17 PM\nSubject: Re: Suicide King\n\n\n&gt; (This is a purely OOC comment.  But Alloran, in my honest opinion I don&#39;t\n&gt; think Minime was half the RPGer JP was.  He wasn&#39;t a bad RPer, he didn&#39;t\nmode\n&gt; to much (except for the transmetal driver fiasco, though it was his first\n&gt; week), but I didn&#39;t think he was anything special)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
