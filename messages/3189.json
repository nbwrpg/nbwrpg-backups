She had challenged him by refusing him the right to scrap this new bot and that was exactly the way he took it, the second challenge coming from the new bot as he then identified it&#39;s position...behind Tavatron and by the door which he had commanded to be sealed. That was just it, behind Tavatron and if it was up to her she would place her body between them to prevent further harm .\nBut there was one word in which had caused his rage to become more then it was before, the one word which came from the bot he would last guess to speak it...that word was &quot; No.&quot;\nThat was the challenge, that was the trigger that was pulled in order to set his rage and hate off at a record breaking high!\nDinobot snapped his head towards Tavatron with a glare of hate and disappointment, his teeth bared and his muscles stressed to the point that they ached. He took a few menacing steps towards her but then simply shouldered past her but with such a force it may have been able to throw her across the room, with her behind him then giving him access to the one in which was his true target...Cyber Claw!\nDinobot had seen her dodge his first blow and strike a second one on him but this time there was no getting away, not from him and the aggression that was building within his systems.\nWith a loud snarl he targeted the stranger right between the optics with his laser sight and with a deep growl fired, even if this attempt failed he had more charges set up right after this one and he knew that even if he missed now he would get her with the others.\nNo bot imitated him and simply got away with it!!!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
