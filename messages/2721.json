She looked\ndown at her communicator but then back up at Prowl, Plintissa was the enemy\nnow...why would she be at the base?\n&gt; She breather an annoyed sigh/growl as she then turned towards the doors of\nthe room, she was busy enough without having to worry about other bots in\nwhich were branded traitors. But she thought that she might as well go and\nsee what Plintissa wanted, no harm in that.\n&gt; Iron Raptor walked up to the doors but then turned to Prowl before she\nexited.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Excuse me but I have some other business to attend to. Prowl. You&#39;re\nleft in charge here until my return. If any other bots come then seat them\nand prepare them for the meeting...please.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She was just about to turn and walk out of the doors when she remembered\nher plans to copy the Predacon&#39;s defense systems, then then looked back at\nProwl.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh, I almost forgot. And please bring up the 3-d scan of both the\nPredacon&#39;s ship and the Ark on the main holo-screen. I need it for a demo\nwhen I get back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * And with that she then walked through the doors and began to make her\nway towards the front doors of the ship, passing room after room until she\ncame to the front doors of the Ark.\n&gt; She looked about for any transformers but there was none to see, where\nwere they all?\n&gt; Iron Raptor shook her head before she pushed the doors open and then\nexited outside, sighting Plintissa and Dracona as she closed the doors\nbehind her.\n&gt; She armed her weapons but kept them in their holds as she then walked a\nbit towards Plintissa, she wasn&#39;t sure if her old friend would fire on her\nbut she knew for a fact that she wasn&#39;t about to let either one inside of\nthe base.\n&gt; Her expression was stern and serious, if they had something to say then\nthey had better say it quick.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I have a meeting to attend so say what you have to say quickly, I don&#39;t\nhave all day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
