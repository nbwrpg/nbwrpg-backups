She was faster than \nhim, due to her longer legs. He panted as he ran. He was starting to miss \nhis cold climate already. He didn&#39;t expect it to be this warm.\n\nHe came to stop with KitKat at the mouth of the large cave. He put his ears \nto their sides and looked up. He sniffed around, smelling another bot. \nFemale.\n\n&quot;I smell someone. Female, I believe.&quot; He sniffed again. &quot;And Quickstrike was \nhere.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Thu, 20 Jul 2000 19:55:29 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Thank you commander.&quot; she said in almost a cheerful voice.  She was\n&gt;glad to leave Megatron&#39;s presence.  She didn&#39;t like him for the fact\n&gt;that his temper was highly unpredictable.  She looked at Rowdy.\n&gt;&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go and find him. With luck, we&#39;ll all be home in time\n&gt;for a evening hunt.&quot;  She tugged at Rowdy&#39;s furs and pulled one off\n&gt;him. &quot;Coming?&quot; She put the fur in a corner where it would be safe and\n&gt;undisturbed. Then she walked out of the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt;She turned on her scanner.  She had &quot;borrowed it&quot; from Darkmouse and\n&gt;started homing in on Quickstrike&#39;s signal.  She followed the signal\n&gt;quite aways from the base.  She found the entrance to a\n&gt;cave.  &quot;Whoah, is it dark in there.&quot;  She took out a small pen light\n&gt;from a small compartment in her wrist and shined the light inside.\n&gt;\n&gt;She walked in and looked around.  The cave was at least three or four\n&gt;times bigger than the current Pred base.  She wondered if megatron\n&gt;would move the base here once he was told of it&#39;s existance.\n&gt;\n&gt;She looked around for Rowdy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megatron/Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Megatron turned to KitKat. He watched as a large wolf-bot came to\n&gt;her side,\n&gt; &gt; dressed in brown, heavy furs. He had a nervous look on his face.\n&gt;Rowdy Wolf\n&gt; &gt; placed his rifle behind his armor and tugged at his own furs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So, this is the Rowdy Wolf Quicksrike spoke of.&quot; Megatron said,\n&gt;glaring at\n&gt; &gt; him. &quot;I am proud to have you on our Predacon ranks.&quot; He thought to\n&gt;himself\n&gt; &gt; as he recalled Quickstrike telling him he was a Maximal. He may\n&gt;have to a\n&gt; &gt; looked after.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rowdy Wolf nodded and pulled the corners of his mouth back. It was\n&gt;becoming\n&gt; &gt; ovious to Megatron that he was getting overheated with all those\n&gt;heavy furs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Rowdy Wolf stripped off a few layers off, Megatron turned his\n&gt;head back\n&gt; &gt; to KitKat. He sighed at her. &quot;If you must, go ahead and look for\n&gt;the Fuzor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;__\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt;http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
