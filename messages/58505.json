Tigon was not moving and the \nprisoner \n&gt; &gt;&gt; was trying to break open the armor on his back.  Celeron fired \n&gt; &gt;both \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of his cannons pointblank into the prisoner.  He was blown back \na \n&gt; &gt;&gt; few yards and fell into the sand.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Celeron decided that if he didn&#39;t act now, he&#39;d lose too and \n&gt; &gt;could \n&gt; &gt;&gt; possibly die.  He grabbed a pair of handcuffs from Tigon&#39;s \ntools, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and he shot at the prisoner to make sure he was down.
