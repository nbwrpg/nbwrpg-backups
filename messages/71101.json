Two of the most\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; powerful Predacons to date are moving against the Ark, Hydras and Cyclonu=\r\ns!\n&gt; &gt; And they are not alone as Predacons of all sorts follow them, lendin=\r\ng their\n&gt; &gt; destructive energies to the battle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Torca, as the high=\r\nest ranking Maximal on the field was attempting to bring\n&gt; &gt; order to the c=\r\nhaos! HoweverTorca is blown his off his feet and sent\n&gt; &gt; sprawling to the =\r\nground by a blast from Cyclonus. The stalwart\n&gt; &gt; Maximal continued giving =\r\norders as he attempted to return fire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wing Caliber, Quickstrike!=\r\n&quot; Torca&#39;s booming voice echoed across the\n&gt; &gt; communication channel. &quot;The a=\r\nutomatic controls are offline, get the Ark door\n&gt; &gt; closed. We don&#39;t want a=\r\nny of these pieces of scrap getting inside the Ark!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Noc=\r\ntorro, Airhammer and Quicksilver did what they could to harass\n&gt; &gt; the othe=\r\nr fliers like Waspinator, Deepstryke and even Cyclonus while Bantor\n&gt; &gt; ent=\r\nered the fray with a wild abandon as he leaped after Hydras, hoping to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndistract him long enough to allow the others to come in.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup&#39;s bla=\r\nsts are powerful as he attempted to fire at the sweeps as well.\n&gt; &gt; However=\r\n what he got in return was several shots from Scourge as he lined up\n&gt; &gt; on=\r\n the Autobot. &quot;Foolish prey!&quot; Scourge said as he came around for another\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; run, his auto canons opening fire on Kup!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile as the sweep=\r\ns came after Nightshift and Ratrap, Nightshift\n&gt; &gt; transformed into his SUV=\r\n mode and began zipping through enemy fire hoping to\n&gt; &gt; dodge the well aim=\r\ned blasts of the sweeps. However the sweeps are designed\n&gt; &gt; to capture pra=\r\ny, and so as Nighshift picks up speed, the sweeps quickly\n&gt; &gt; oblige the Ma=\r\nximals by firing sizzling hot disintegration beams at them as\n&gt; &gt; they fly =\r\nafter them!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Elita nod=\r\ned and Took ramulus&#39;s hand, she was unusually quiet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ramulus looked at Elita, &quot;I will protect you. I promise. Your father has =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; defend the Ark.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Rodimus gave Elita one last sque=\r\neze and then transformed. With a\n&gt; &gt; screeching noise Rodimus took off for =\r\nthe front door. It was time to join\n&gt; &gt; the battle in earnest!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Meanwhile at the same time Tuscon was still continuing his search, using =\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; sonar to attempt to locate the intruder. A small blip appeared on h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; screen, alerting him to the possible location of the intruder. Long =\r\nyears of\n&gt; &gt; stealth training are readying him for this moment as he moves =\r\nforward,\n&gt; &gt; trying to listen for the smallest sound, feeling for the small=\r\nest vibration.\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Tuscon&#39;s armor is heavier than it once was=\r\n, slowing him. While\n&gt; &gt; he is far more durable than he once was, moving si=\r\nlently and stealthily is\n&gt; &gt; not an easy task, especially with his injuries=\r\n.

That means, if they take anyone&#39;s life, or attempt=\r\n to, return the favor at will! They want to play rough, they got it! Becaus=\r\ne if they think we&#39;re going to fall to them, THEY&#39;RE SADLY MISTAKEN!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He slams a foot down hard, and at the same time, lets loose ano=\r\nther round of formidable sonar waves.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I figured I would post first before I decided if Tuscon woul=\r\nd hit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightrazor still had that last move. Anyone do what you=\r\n will and we will see&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; what happens :)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; BIC:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark the battle is picking up=\r\n speed, the Maximals bringing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everything they have to bear aga=\r\ninst the Predacons!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the scene that greet=\r\ns Wing Caliber and Quickstrike as they emerge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from the Ark and=\r\n into the combat - one of complete mayhem! Two of the most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pow=\r\nerful Predacons to date are moving against the Ark, Hydras and Cyclonus!&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And they are not alone as Predacons of all sorts follow them, le=\r\nnding their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; destructive energies to the battle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Torca, as the highest ranking Maximal on the field was attempt=\r\ning to bring&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; order to the chaos! HoweverTorca is blown his off=\r\n his feet and sent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sprawling to the ground by a blast from Cyc=\r\nlonus. The stalwart&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Maximal continued giving orders as he atte=\r\nmpted to return fire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wing Caliber, Quickstrike=\r\n!&quot; Torca&#39;s booming voice echoed across the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; communication chann=\r\nel. &quot;The automatic controls are offline, get the Ark door&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; clos=\r\ned. We don&#39;t want any of these pieces of scrap getting inside the Ark!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Noctorro, Airhammer and Quicksilver did w=\r\nhat they could to harass&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the other fliers like Waspinator, Dee=\r\npstryke and even Cyclonus while Bantor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; entered the fray with a=\r\n wild abandon as he leaped after Hydras, hoping to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; distract hi=\r\nm long enough to allow the others to come in.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ku=\r\np&#39;s blasts are powerful as he attempted to fire at the sweeps as well.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; However what he got in return was several shots from Scourge as he=\r\n lined up&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the Autobot. &quot;Foolish prey!&quot; Scourge said as he c=\r\name around for another&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; run, his auto canons opening fire on Ku=\r\np!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile as the sweeps came after Nightshift=\r\n and Ratrap, Nightshift&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; transformed into his SUV mode and bega=\r\nn zipping through enemy fire hoping to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dodge the well aimed bl=\r\nasts of the sweeps. However the sweeps are designed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to capture=\r\n pray, and so as Nighshift picks up speed, the sweeps quickly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\noblige the Maximals by firing sizzling hot disintegration beams at them as&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; they fly after them!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Elita noded and Took ramulus&#39;s hand, she was unusually quiet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramulus looked =\r\nat Elita, &quot;I will protect you. I promise. Your father has to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\nefend the Ark.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Rodimus gave Elita one=\r\n last squeeze and then transformed. With a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; screeching noise Ro=\r\ndimus took off for the front door. It was time to join&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the bat=\r\ntle in earnest!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile at the s=\r\name time Tuscon was still continuing his search, using his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; son=\r\nar to attempt to locate the intruder. A small blip appeared on his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; screen, alerting him to the possible location of the intruder. Long ye=\r\nars of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; stealth training are readying him for this moment as he=\r\n moves forward,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; trying to listen for the smallest sound, feeli=\r\nng for the smallest vibration.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Tuscon&#39;s armor is=\r\n heavier than it once was, slowing him. While&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he is far more d=\r\nurable than he once was, moving silently and stealthily is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not=\r\n an easy task, especially with his injuries. But he took his moment to&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; ready himself . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Steady Straight Shot. We need to make th=\r\nis count.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot programs her m=\r\nechanisms for optimal effeciency.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Tal=\r\nk about a shot in the dark. Okay, let&#39;s do this.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even as Tuscon uttered those words=\r\n he could hear a small whisper from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; somewhere in the dark. &quot;AH=\r\nH yes, the wave is gone . . . FINALLY!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The blip=\r\n disappeared from Tuscon&#39;s screens . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
