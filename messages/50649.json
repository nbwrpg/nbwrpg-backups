To him, it was\n&gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasting words that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be best kept. It was alien to him to be\n&gt; &gt; called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so familiarly. He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did not feel comfortable with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He turned back to the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vlad: WHAT SAY YOU WARRIORS?

He thought of his options. He\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start firing, but he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not decided which group was the best to go\n&gt; &gt; with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those Rogues were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greater in number, but that did not prove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything. Ice Hellion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warriors were many, and their prowess in\n&gt; &gt; combat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did not reflect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed\n&gt; &gt; less\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organized, even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they seemed better armed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His declaration of being the object of the\n&gt; &gt; trial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of possession \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motivate them, but he harbored no illusions.\n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a human, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unknown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to these machines. He had not proven\n&gt; &gt; himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but was confident he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be of some use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, there was this female robot. He did\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know who she was or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which team she was in, but it seemed as\n&gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she had a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mission, maybe even unknown to her. There\n&gt; &gt; had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a way he could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring her with him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In all these options, running was not\n&gt; &gt; present.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was the cowards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or... yes...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He fired his two missile racks in the air\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forty tiny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peppered the sky.
