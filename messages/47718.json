How many stupid questions do \nyou have? \n&gt;  They saved the planet from a giant MONSTER named Unicron that was \ngoing to \n&gt; obliterate the planet and everything else in the Universe.  That \nwould be \n&gt; worth being happy about, though it was stupid to say it was the end \nof the \n&gt; Third Cybertronian War, I&#39;ll give ya that.
