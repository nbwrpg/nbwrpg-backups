I can pinpoint \nwhere it is exactly..this is why we need Cybershark. The oracal has told me \nthat cybershark has a mutation. His scanners have a built in abnormality. He \ncan pick up Prime&#39;s spark no matter where it has gone. He is the only one \nthat can pinpoint where Prime has gone. I don&#39;t know why this is but it is \ntrue. I am sure Prime knows this as well so he will probably be after him.  \nWe must find him first.Grimmler thats where you come in..use your scanners \nand try to pinpoint his spark signature.&quot;\n\n"}}
