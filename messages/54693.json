He slid across the ground as his ship stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    =\r\n         When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was =\r\nin full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked b=\r\nack to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face ha=\r\nd been ripped apart, and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular system=\r\ns. Now everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; &gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and dented, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see th=\r\ne shoulder \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some so=\r\nrt of \n&gt; &gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the=\r\n future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communi=\r\ncations boxes on these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible.
