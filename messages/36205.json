Cyclonus, I will meet you outside of \nthe base. Astrotrain exits the Dark Avian, and waits for Cyclonus.\n\nSwitchblade smirks at Motormaster, &quot;Ha, put the big long pointy thing \nback where it belongs,&quot; the deactivated demo charge on Motormaster&#39;s \nback drops to the ground and comes to a rest between Motormaster&#39;s \nlegs. &quot;Just say that the we were prisoners, that&#39;ll work just fine.&quot; \nSwitchblade hops off his chair, pushes the cyclone gun&#39;s barrel away, \nand jumps back onto the console and begins to strugle at pulling out \nthe large sword. &quot;We need ta fix the console before Megs finds out...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
