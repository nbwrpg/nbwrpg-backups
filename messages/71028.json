Toda=\r\ny - is such an example.&quot;\n\nAs they head home, Tucson gradually reveals more =\r\nand more of himself to his comrades, which was definitely an infinite show =\r\nof trust.\n\n&quot; Before the power - of the Matrix, I - was known to be - a bit =\r\nmore aggressive than - most Autobots.  Talon, you know- you - saw that firs=\r\nt hand when - we encountered that Minion in that abandoned base.  I - locke=\r\nd myself in with the enemy, and did - not stop until I had him restrained. =\r\n That - too was one of my mistakes, I - was lucky it turned out for the bes=\r\nt.&quot;\n\nHe sighs once more.
