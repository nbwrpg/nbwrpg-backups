Vorpal, Unicron himself and one other minion remaining from the great armada that was once the minions of Unicron?\n\nMarauder remained baffled for a moment as he remembered that there were many. Then instructions came from Vorpral - not in the sense of words and orders, but memories that appeared to be sent to him some time ago. There were other minions, damaged battle, minions that would be in need of repairs. And there was Cyclonus and Scourge, who appeared to have dropped off the grid. Where were they?\n\nMaruader grunted to ho himself and then shifted orientation. First he would seek out the live minion, then seek out the dead, and then the missing. Yes, the minions would rise again!\n\nHe sent a short message to Lamia, a note of reassurance perhaps, &quot;enroute&quot; he said as he looked toward the old Maximal base and engaged engines!\n\nPreston\n(Marauder)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
