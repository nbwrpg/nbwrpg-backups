She realizes quickly something is \nshielding Maxima from her powers, and taps into the power of the Soul \nOrbs to force her way past the block.  She doesn&#39;t like what she \nsees, but walks with Maxima anyway, confident in her own ability to \ndefend herself.  &quot;You&#39;ve been talking with Hydras, haven&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
