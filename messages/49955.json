Most animals didn&#39;t want to bother a \n&gt; moderately large black bear, and Scryed didn&#39;t really want to be \n&gt; bothrered that much. She was enjoying the peacefulness of the \n&gt; surroundings.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Drat,&quot; she mumbles to herself as she steps into a muddy puddle \n&gt; which was hidden by some light brush, and that seemed to be created \n&gt; by a small brook which was slowly filling a small pool farther down \n&gt; the valley. &lt;I&#39;d better get back soon, I&#39;m a little late for my \n&gt; patrol report, as uneventful as it was.&gt; Picking up her pace, the \n&gt; bear-bot trotted along carefully and emerged from the end of the \n&gt; valley into sight of the Maximal Base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moments later,\n&gt; \n&gt; Scryed entered the base, and headed to the control room, looking \nfor \n&gt; Talos as she wasn&#39;t aware that Talos was not in charge.\n\n\n"}}
