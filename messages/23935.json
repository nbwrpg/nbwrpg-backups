TALK QUIKLY!!!!&quot;\n\nThe hwak took two of his feathers and waited ready to battle\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; Diablo saw the mud coming towards him, and almost casually leaned \nto \n&gt; one side, and the mud went on its original path and hit the tree \n&gt; behind him. He narrowed his eyes in contempt, and would have \nsmirked \n&gt; if he had a mouth. Mud as a weapon? Against him? He assumed the Mud \n&gt; was an attempt to uncover his cloaking. But the cloaking/stealth \n&gt; technology worked as a not-so-solid sheild around him, so even if \nthe \n&gt; mud did hit, it wouldn&#39;t have been seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; He then sighed as he watched the battle carry on with his main \neyes. \n&gt; One stalk eye was focused on Angel Prime, and the other on Vamprah \n&gt; who had left for no apparant reason. His right stalk eyes swiveled \n&gt; over to rest on the extremely fat GodFather, and he would have \n&gt; laughed out loud. Would have. But.. he hadn&#39;t quite figured out how \n&gt; to talk, if he didn&#39;t have a mouth...\n&gt; \n&gt; Diablo grimaced with his eyes, and stepped almost daintily from his \n&gt; cover, still sheilded. His two meter long tail, held in an arc, \n&gt; swayed above his head. Up and close would be good to observe the \n&gt; battle. Standing about 5 meters from the very back of the \nattackers, \n&gt; he cocked his head to aim and flung out another cloaked scythe, \n&gt; poisoned on the tip, towards WindLord.\n\n\n"}}
