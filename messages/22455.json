He also would have been happy that he had reprogramed it to \nbecome an image of him centered on the emitter itself.  The final thing was \npure luck he dropped it in the battle and landed on it when he fell.  It \nturned on and created the hologram over where he was lying.  The first shots \nhit him and dealt significant damage but they also knocked him backwards away \nfrom the explosions.  The shots dealt less and less damage as the blew him \nfarther away.  Because the emitter was centered on his body and small it \nremained functional, moving only slightly.  It also was programmed to hide \nhim from sight so that they could not notice that he was no longer getting \nhit.\n\n"}}
