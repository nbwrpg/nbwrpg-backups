Maybe even \nworse. He looked around, arching his neck left and right, taking at \nglance at the others.\n\nAfter of few more mintures of leaning against the side of the ramp \nwall, he saw something in the sky. It looked like a flier. He snapped \nup and watched it. His optics were the keenest part of his senses.\n\nIt got closer.\n\n&quot;Hey!&quot; he called to alert the others. He trotted down to the end of \nthe ramp and stood in attention to the approaching flier. It has \nwings, red in color.\n\nHe aimed his arm up at it, ready to fire, then he realized what it \nwas.\n\n&quot;Dang.&quot; He lowered his arm. It was Terrorsaur. He dactyl landed by \nhim. &quot;Where in tarnation were you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Spying,&quot; the dactyl replied. His wings shook a little.\n\n&quot;Spying, huh?&quot; He turned his head towards the others.\n\n\n"}}
