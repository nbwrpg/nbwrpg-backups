Now most of the area \nin front of the CF was burning grass and dirt-filled craters.\n\nThe top of Unitron&#39;s left wrist pulled up, revealing a small laser blaster \nembedded inside, the barrel pointing at Hot Rod.  Ten rapid blasts launched \nout at the Maximal (or Autobot..?)&#39;s chest.  Unitron brought his laser rifle \nto point at Hot Rod at the same time, firing off three bolts at Hot Rod&#39;s \nleft knee, followed up by five rapid optic blasts at the war hero&#39;s left \nshoulder.\n\n"}}
