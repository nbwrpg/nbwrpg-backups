We are dealing with a\n&gt; tear, one that grows as long as we stay here on this ball of dirt.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; SKYSHADOW was also listening intently as ANTAGONY spoke, a he found\n&gt; this interesting and somewhat unsettling. The doorway made him\n&gt; uncomfortable enough, but a tear? Then he looked around as he noted\n&gt; several missing figures, one was FRACTYL who might have some\n&gt; infromation on this , but also HYDRAS&#39; most loyal soldier INFERNO.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ebony colored ANTAGONY crossed her arms casually over her chest,\n&gt; &quot;There is something that may stop it.&quot; Her tone dark and vaguely\n&gt; dissmissive of TARANTULUS, but carefully hidden. &quot;It is called a\n&gt; Zeta-Hypercube.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKYSHADOW frowned as he folded his arms over his chest, &quot;A Zeta-what?&quot;\n\n&quot;A Zeta-Hypercube.&quot; TARANTULUS said with a small wicked chuckle.\n\n&quot;A Z-Cube for short.&quot; ANTAGONY cut in.\n\nThere was a strange look from SKYSHADOW, &quot;Where do we get one of these\nZ-Cubes?&quot; He said as he looked at ANTAGONY and then at TARANTULUS.\n\n&quot;Well, um, that is to say, um.&quot; TARANTULUS stuttered.\n\nANTAGONY glanced at TARANTULUS and then at SKYSHADOW, &quot;That&#39;s why I am\nhere, to recover it.&quot; She said deadpan.\n\nSKYSHADOW nodded as a slow smile spread across his faceplace, &quot;And\nthat&#39;s the rub, where is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;There.&quot; ANTAGONY pointed to a digital map.\n\nThe location was several miles from the MAXIMAL base.\n\n&quot;I thought so.&quot; SKYSHADOW said evenly. &quot;Near to enemy territory.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
