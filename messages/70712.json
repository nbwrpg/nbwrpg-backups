Perceptor has proven his\n&gt; loyalty to us. He has done many favors which would have cost him his life\n&gt; if he were to be brought to Hydras now. To me that takes a lot of\n&gt; courage, and courage is something a Maximal and an Autobot are known for.\n&gt; Let&#39;s try to put things behind us, because we have a road ahead of us that\n&gt; is not shy of being perhaps one of our most difficult journeys.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSanton just shrugged, &quot;I am a doctor more than a combatant.&quot; the\nMaximal medic said, and despite his large size and the vicious tusks,\nsomewhat similar to Torca, he was just that a highly decorated doctor\nand medic. &quot;It does take courage to stand up for what you believe in,\nit takes even more to stand up to do what is right.&quot;\n\nHe looked over at Perceptor, &quot;We shall see what you do Perceptor.&quot; he\nsaid, not totally trusting him, and yet open to perhaps that the\npredacon might be trying to change.\n\nLegacy on the other hand just looked at Tuscon his face devoid of\nexpression, &quot;Scientifically speaking an individual&#39;s history is often\nthe best predictor of future behavior.&quot; He looked over at Perceptor,\n&quot;I look forward to observing this new behavior and seeing how it\naligns with this stated new vector in life.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Still we have to reprogram Nightlight&quot;sighed Kup&quot;We cant allow her to\n&gt; remain in stacis much longer&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just a warning&quot;said dryly Perceptor&quot;After her reprogramation she will have\n&gt; a downtime... it seems that is part of her system, when she was reprogramed\n&gt; as Blackstorm and in this time her program was containes she showed a\n&gt; downtime with no phisical explantion...
