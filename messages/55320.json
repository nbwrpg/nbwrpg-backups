He held her up as he went flying.  \n&gt; She landed next to him as the blast sent them to the ground.  Despite \n&gt; her own injuries, she tried to help him to his feet. &quot;Come on, we \n&gt; have to retreat back to base. Neither of us will make it out of this \n&gt; fight if we continue. We must go and get maintenanced. Then we shall \n&gt; come back and finish the job on another day. Let them have a small \n&gt; victory. We still will win the war.&quot;  She was having trouble, her \n&gt; wounds were leaking heavily. Despite the patch that Carnatron gave \n&gt; her, her wounds were still sever. She was down to 25 % before she \n&gt; lost consiousness. But her programs were not going to let her give in \n&gt; untill her spark stopped.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
