It had been empty for as long as anyone could remember. In it, \nwas scattered old tables, chairs, and lighting equitment. Transanulas used it \nbriefly has a lair, but was discovered and left it. For now it suited her \npurposes.\n    Sitting on an old barrle, with her legs crossed and the bowcaster in her \nlap, Aracnia began the conversation. She was egar for Paralysis to join her, \nas egar as she was to get Quickstrike and Darkmouse to help her.\n    &quot;Now, Paralysis, tell me all about yourself. I need to know you if your \nto be one of my soldiers.&quot; She said cooly.\n    The toad and taken a seat on a turned over computer consol. His long legs \nstreched out in front of him as he reclined on his elbows. &quot;Well, Im only \nseveral hours old, but according to the data tracks im a normal predacon \nwarrior. I can fight and know my way around a computer system. What else is \nthere?&quot;\n    She noted his cockyness. It was annoying, but attractive. She caught \nherself feeling that way about him several times already. &quot;I see. Well, are \nyou willing to help me get into power, and unite the two fractions?&quot;\n    &quot;Yes. I&#39;ll help you. What have I got to lose?&quot; He croaked.\n    Aracnia smiled. Excellent. Things were going very well. &quot;Your help will \nbe rewarded. Now, Im going to introduce you to Darkmouse. Shes a Predacon \ntoo, but is under the control of Quickstrike. Quickstrike is ready to help \nme, and the rodent will follow him. Im going to leave you with the mouse \nwhile I go to the bridge to locate this Thunder Hammer person. The more \npeople I have on my side, the better.&quot;\n    Paralysis nodded and they went to the vault where Darkmouse was being \nheld. The toad held his pistol, ready to fire, as Aracnia opened the cell.\n    &quot;Well Darkmouse, hello. I want to introduce you to Paralysis. He will be \ntaking you to Quickstrike very soon.&quot; She said, handing a ration of food to \nthe mouse.\n    &quot;Yes, I look forward to working with such a preety little bot like \nyourself.&quot; Paralysis said with a toothy smile.\n    Aracnia shighed and left the two there. She took a lift to the bridge and \nentered. There, on the scanners was Thunder Hammer. Once agian she departed \nfrom the ship to meet him.\n\n"}}
