See, \nthe floor they were on was circular and had three passsage ways that \nwent down into the ship. FoxFingers took one passage that went \nthrough part of the ships engine rooms, then on down to the brig.\n\nAnd yes, to keep it interesting, FF is going to pass part of the \nengine room, life support and some minor propulsion systems before \ngetting to the brig.\n\n\n"}}
