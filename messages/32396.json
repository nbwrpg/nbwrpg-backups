I&#39;ve missed out \non some really good chances to build some stories with you guys, but \nI hope that I can post more soon. I will be posting regularely, but \nnot as much as I used to. Hopefully soon I can resume as I used to. \nAlloran, as far as i&#39;m concerened you guys can use Abominus this \nfight. I&#39;m sorry Kslawdogg and Roborick that my Autobots didnt reply, \nI wish I was able to, okay well here it goes.\n\nBIC:\n\nFiredrill/Cliffjumper/Beachcomber/Megatron/Motormaster/Headstrong/\nTantrum.\n\n\nFiredrill looks to Firstaid who is rushing off, and dosent get a \nchance to have his sentence heard by the robot. &quot;Don&#39;t you recognize \nme?&quot; he asked, but it fell on deaf ears. He transformed, and race to \nfollow him.\n\nBeachcomber ran up to Cliffjumper who was shaking his head after \nbeing brought back on line and having his body repaired a \nbit. &quot;Thank&quot; he mentioned, both to his former leader Hotrod, and \nHalucigen for repairing him. He turned to Beachcomber &quot;It&#39;s Roddy, \nlet&#39;s go help him&quot; and before Beachomber can reply Cliffjumper leaps \nforward, and fluidly shifts, transforming into his car mode, hitting \nthe ground with his wheels burning to propelle himself, and he heads \ntowards his former leader. Beachcomber transforms, and follows, but \nbehind him, due to his lack of speed.\n\nMegatron Turned around noticing the situation, and his plan \ndeteriorating, &quot;That&#39;s it, this fits into my plans terribly \nAstroblast, luckily I had planned for this turn of evets, take us \ndown to earth&quot;. He said comanding his ship. Motormaster stepped back, \nhe knew what was coming.\n\nOOC: Kslawdogg, can you tell me if I miss an Attack as Headstrong, \nthe post was long ago.\n\nBIC: Headstrong leapt up into the air, two fireballs coming to close \nfor compfort. He landed as close as possible, trying to surround his \nenemy in a wall of Headstrong&#39;s, and then each one began to swing his \nsword in a wide arc towards Hotspot (only one will hit though as the \nother four are holograms, if it does hit that is)\n\nTantrum flew up, and turned around noticing Abominus&#39; enemy. He fired \ntwo streams of lighting towards Element and fired his catalyst \nblaster at the same time.\n\n\n"}}
