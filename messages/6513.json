She felt her strength had \nreturned to her.  She ran out of the Ark and looked to see that \nLunarpine was still alive.  She called out to him, &quot;Lunarpine, You \nalright?&quot; She flew to his side and transformed into bot mode.  She \ncould see that his optics were damaged.  She grabbed his hand and put \nit on her shoulder,&quot;I&#39;ll be your seeing eye owl.&quot; She drew her dagger \nwith her good hand and threw it at Ares.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine falls back in an immense amount of pain, he&#39;d stopped \nAres \n&gt; from doing more harm, unfortunately the cost was 92% of his optical \n&gt; scanners. he no longer could see any details around him. just \nshapes \n&gt; and blurs of movement.his olfactory sensors were still functioning \n&gt; though after that last shot he yook he didn&#39;t know for how long, \n&gt; Lunarpine transformed to wolf mode and used his sense of smell to \n&gt; head toward the ark. he was prepared to attack anything that got \n&gt; between him and the ark. he just hoped that it wasn&#39;t Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lunarpine to maximals I&#39;ve taken heavy damage and need some cover \n&gt; fire. if you&#39;re close identify yourself, I don&#39;t want to avoid any \n&gt; friendly fire situations if I can.&quot; Lunarpines warning could be \nheard \n&gt; from both sides. he just hoped the enemy was to bust with the other \n&gt; Maximals to bother him. Ares scent didn&#39;t seem to be following him. \n&gt; This wolf hoped that the ram was as damagedas he was if not more.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a good thing he&#39;d stayed here for a short time, he could \nsmell \n&gt; his way around to make do.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
