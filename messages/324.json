Her shoulder still hurt from the fall but she was a trooper and could \nhandle it.\nTeltoli walked beside Carnage as they walked in further into the forest, she \nwould no longer be able to see the raptor if she flew so she decided to join \nher on the ground.\nTeltoli laughed...*\n\nTeltoli: &quot; What would happen to Megatron if you put a fake pig&#39;s snout on \nhis face?&quot;\n\n* Carnage thought for a moment as the trees cut out most of the dwindling \nlight then smiled...*\n\nCarnage: &quot; He&#39;d probably start to have a craving for corn.&quot;\n*She snickered but knew that the joke wasn&#39;t really funny, the result of \nsplit second thinking she guessed.\nTeltoli looked up at Carnage and shook her head, she didn&#39;t even catch the \njoke.She continued to walk deeper into the forest with Carnage until all of \nthe light from the sky faded into the black of night that she always knew.\nCarnage sighed and sniffed the air, a faint sent caught her attention and \nsoon she put her nose to the ground. She began to follow it, Teltoli \ntrailing a short distance behind.She couldn&#39;t put her claw on the sent but \nit seemed familiar.\nShe followed the sent until her snout suddenly ran into a leaf pile and hit \nsomething hard.*\n\nCarnage: &quot;Ow!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli came up beside Carnage and looked at the pile of leaves then \nturned to the reptile.*\n\nTeltoli: &quot;What is it?&quot;\n\n* Carnage pulled her snout back but then sniffed around the leaves again, \nshe knew that sent! She suddenly reared her head back and pushed Teltoli \naway from the pile with her hurt shoulder.*\n\n&quot; Get out of here!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli stepped back in surprise and looked up at Carnage*\n\nTeltoli: &quot;Why?&quot;\n\n* Carnage bared her teeth and backed into Teltoli, keeping herself between \nthe pile and the Fuzor.\nWhile trying to find food she had accidentally run into the sleeping spot of \nthe clone instead!\nShe was wondering why the sent smelled familiar!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
