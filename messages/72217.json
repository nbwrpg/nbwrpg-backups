But yet here he was finally resurfacing after&lt;br&gt;\nfive decades or more h=\r\nere on old Earth.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGUILEDART and his tw=\r\no henchmen led TUSCON to what atfirst appeared to&lt;br&gt;\nbe a cliff face posit=\r\nioned on the side of a mountain side. It was as&lt;br&gt;\nif some great force had=\r\n sheered off a side of the mountain towards the&lt;br&gt;\nbottom, leaving a smoot=\r\nh and very steep wall leading up perhaps&lt;br&gt;\nseveral hundred feet. However =\r\nthat is not the direction that TUSCON&lt;br&gt;\nwas being led.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs the th=\r\ne path they were on came up and over and met the cliff face&lt;br&gt;\nthey could =\r\nturn and see a huge valley opening up before them, a large&lt;br&gt;\nriver runnin=\r\ng down from the surrounding mountains, along with large&lt;br&gt;\ntrees and other=\r\n assorted folliage.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGUILEDART pulled out a strange device and orie=\r\nnted it just off the&lt;br&gt;\npath ahead ihn a strange and obsure clearing then =\r\nactivated it. As he&lt;br&gt;\ndid so a shimmering energy field appeared looking v=\r\nery much like a&lt;br&gt;\ndoor, it was perhaps a thousand yards or so ahead of th=\r\nem.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;There.&quot; GUILEDART said as he pointed at it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThey con=\r\ntinued walking on, HARDHEAD and HYDRA leading TUSCON with&lt;br&gt;\nweapons still=\r\n drawn. They seemed to have little or no regard for&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON&#39;s injured st=\r\nate as they moved quickly over the broken ground&lt;br&gt;\nthat quickly sloped do=\r\nwnward.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-11-643734590--\r\n\n"}}
