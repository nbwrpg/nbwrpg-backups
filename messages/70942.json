He seems uneasy and crouches low.\n\n&quot; I dunno about you Win=\r\ndlord, but I got this strange feeling that we&#39;re definitely be&#39;n watched.  =\r\nWe need a signature scrambler pronto, and wheels is the only one who&#39;s got =\r\nit.  Anyway, until then, we gotta move on, danger or no danger.  Now, I nee=\r\nd ta find that little control pannel I found before... Hmmm, this ain&#39;t fam=\r\nilliar, I think we&#39;re at the opposite side of the fortress..  But there&#39;s g=\r\notta be more than one control pannel box, right?  Think ya might know where=\r\n ta find it?&quot;\n\nOutside the fortress, some distance away, Tucson&#39;s radar pic=\r\nks up on Deepstryke and Phobia as does Night Shifts.  But instead of fear a=\r\nnd apprehension, both Autobots stand their ground firmly, along with Kup an=\r\nd Talon.\n\nTucson could hear the taunts of Hydras, yet they do not bother hi=\r\nm.  He stands with a solid stance, one that states, &quot;I&#39;m not intimidated by=\r\n you in the least.&quot;  He slowly draws his blade from behind his back.\n\n&quot;Word=\r\ns, Hydras, that&#39;s all they are.  It&#39;s too bad you hide behind them like a t=\r\nurtle in a shell. &quot;\n\nWithout much show of emotion, Tucson narrows an optic,=\r\n and turns up the frequency on his sonar emitter, thus making the signal mu=\r\nch stronger, and powerful enough to span over near Deepstryke and Phobia, i=\r\nn an attempt to disorientate them as well.  While doing that, he keeps full=\r\n concentration on Hydras.\n\n&quot;Talon, Night Shift, Kup, Straight Shot, I&#39;d lik=\r\ne you to teach Deepstryke and Phobia a lesson in picking on someone their o=\r\nwn size. I&#39;ll handle Hydras.&quot;\n\nNight Shift and Straight Shot gasp.\n\n&quot;Whoahh=\r\nh, big guy, ohh that&#39;s not good, ya can&#39;t take Hydras yourself, that&#39;s suic=\r\nide!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot appears worried.\n\n&quot;I knew you&#39;d try something like tha=\r\nt!  Night Shift&#39;s right!  Rodimus also told you not ta try and bite off mor=\r\ne than you can chew!&quot;\n\nTucson readies himself for a battle.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll be fine=\r\n, don&#39;t worry.  I didn&#39;t get my name for nothing.&quot;\n\nNight Shift didn&#39;t want=\r\n any part of Tucson throwing himself into the dragon&#39;s lair.  He knew what =\r\nhad to be done, and against Tucson&#39;s orders, he reaches out to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;N=\r\nIGHT SHIFT TA RODIMUS OVER!  I THINK YA BETTER SET UP SOME SERIOUS SECURITY=\r\n AT THE ARK, &#39;CAUSE WE&#39;RE GONNA NEED YA HERE!  TUCSON&#39;S WAITN&#39; FOR HYDRAS A=\r\nND HE&#39;S LOOKN&#39; TA GO ONE ON ONE WITH &#39;EM!&quot;\n\nTucson says nothing to Night Sh=\r\nift.  Deep down he knew his friend was right and he was taking an unecesary=\r\n risk.  Yet he felt obligated to do it.\n\nBack at the Ark, Quickstride shake=\r\ns his head, as the darkness lifts, and he can hear and see again.  He snort=\r\ns.\n\n&quot; Talk about a serious system glitch.   What the pit was that?&quot;\n\nHe cou=\r\nld now see and hear Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m okay Rodimus, I - think it was just a gl=\r\nitch, not sure really..  Anyway, someone is definitely here, but I&#39;m sure I=\r\n can handle things here.  You better go assist Night Shift and the others. =\r\n He said something about - Tucson waiting for Hydras... Sorry, overheard th=\r\ne com, can&#39;t help it.&quot;\n\nBack at the battle ground, Straight Shot could hard=\r\nly believe what Tucson was doing.  They had been together for vorns and now=\r\n, it appeared that in a split second, she could lose her life long friend.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Talon, you gotta do something!  Talk him out of it!  I know what he&#39;s doi=\r\nng and it&#39;s certain destruction if he does!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; HYDRAS\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras cursed =\r\nand said by all Predacon Channels &quot;SPread and take defensive positions try =\r\nto encircle the maximals and shut them down, Kill in sight...&quot; Then opening=\r\n comlink to Tucson said  with a taunting voice&quot;Ahhh Irt seems that you fina=\r\nlly decided to pay a visit&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Super Cyclonus \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, D=\r\necember 22, 2010 11:25 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: Oper=\r\nation Black Tower\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Two sweeps continue to fly over head, risin=\r\ng further and further into the air. They are out numbered now by the Maxima=\r\nls and Autobots below them, and it would seem that their perilous situation=\r\n is becoming clear to them. At the last moment they appear to be about to t=\r\nurn tail and run, but the rapid fire prowess from Kup, Nightshift and Talon=\r\n quickly bring down the last of the two sweeps, twin contrails of smoke mar=\r\nk their demise as they spiral towards the ground some distance away.\n&gt; \n&gt; H=\r\nowever in the distance back up forces continue to close the distance, the l=\r\narge form of Deepstryke in his cannon mode, followed by Phobia and several =\r\nsweeps all in aerial modes can easily be seen as they approach!\n&gt; \n&gt; ******=\r\n*******************************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, hig=\r\nh up on the wall of the dark tower, Rat Trap and Windlord continue their at=\r\ntempts to break in. Using Rat Trap&#39;s acid, the wall sizzles slightly as a l=\r\nittle of the metal buckles under the assault from the acid. However there i=\r\ns only a little of it, so the affects are small.\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord, adding his =\r\nfeather, sticking it in the crevasse created by the acid and creating a sma=\r\nll explosion is able to create a small crack in the wall, one just large en=\r\nough to fit a rat, and perhaps a small bird!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time both of =\r\nthem can hear the sound of a ship approaching the tower, a shuttlecraft, th=\r\ne IFF marking revealing it to be Predacon!\n&gt; \n&gt; ***************************=\r\n**********************************\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras and Cyclonus continue the=\r\nir conversation as Hydras&#39; shuttle closes its distance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hydras Just =\r\narrived towards the BlackFortress\n&gt; &gt; and opening comlink to his men he sai=\r\nd &quot;Here\n&gt; &gt; is Hydras, Try to sorrund the enemie... that\n&gt; &gt; will made them=\r\n an easier target &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus&#39; voice comes over Hydras&#39; speakers, &quot;Um s=\r\nir, you have most of our forces with you.

They are pr=\r\nobably trying to breach the walls!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; **********************************=\r\n***************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Back at the Ark Quickstride is quickly gra=\r\nsp one thing, it is extremely dark, pitch black! There is absolutely no lig=\r\nht! If it wasn&#39;t for his internal maintenance systems he might even think h=\r\nis optic sensors had been turned off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another interesting fact is that=\r\n he cannot hear anything either. He can hear NO reply from Rodimus Prime, b=\r\nut more than that, he cannot even hear the sound of his own voice as he tri=\r\nes to talk or the obvious movements he himself was making.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Then the =\r\ndarkness began to fade becoming more like a supra dense fog that is beginni=\r\nng to lift, dimly Rodimus&#39; voice can be heard comming from somewhere, &quot;Quic=\r\nkstride!!
