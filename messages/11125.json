She stopped, turned around and walked back to \nStriker. She looked at him for a sec.  She thought what she was about \nto do was stupid, but what the hell.  She stood next to him, gave him \na quick peck on the cheek,&quot;I&#39;m sorry for slamming the door on you \nlike that,&quot; she said rather quickly.  Then she turned and walked down \nthe hall, almost jogging.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Just a note to KitKat and co: The Cybertronian Fire has scanner \njams, at \n&gt; best, you&#39;d be able to scan the outside. To get the &#39;plans of the \nship&#39;, \n&gt; you&#39;d either have to do what BrightBlade is doing, or what Feline \nand \n&gt; Skulletron are going to do. Phobia might have some of the ship \nscanned from \n&gt; his visit, but the jammers would most-likely have prevented him \nfrom getting \n&gt; more than half.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker raises an eyebrow. Spears seemed to be holding in alot of \nanger. He \n&gt; smiles. &quot;We&#39;ll have enough time to get to the CF,&quot; he says, \nforgetting about \n&gt; Spears&#39; fear of heights, &quot;I could fly us there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He blinks, realizing what he&#39;d just said, &quot;Or we could walk,&quot; he \nquickly adds \n&gt; on, hoping the first comment wouldn&#39;t drive Spears to panic.\n\n\n"}}
