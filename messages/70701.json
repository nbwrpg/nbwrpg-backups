Ahhh yes, I forgot\n&gt;&gt; it, for a time I set her in Stasis lock. That&#39;s the direct damage that \n&gt;&gt; she\n&gt;&gt; received of me, and you must be agree that comparing what others have \n&gt;&gt; done,\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s nothing&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Compared to others?&quot; Santon said as he looked at Perceptor, his face\n&gt; drawn and tense as he listened to the &#39;ex&#39; Predacon enumerate all the\n&gt; changes he had done to Nightlight. &quot;You have done about as much damage\n&gt; to her that a being could do! You tried to destroy who she was and\n&gt; tried to make her into something else! Hopw can that be nothing?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon turned away from Perceptor, his optics angry and yet sad at the\n&gt; same time, unsure how someone who could not understand the difference\n&gt; between the destruction of the body and the destruction of the soul\n&gt; was no difference at all, could ever become an Autobot.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You need rest&quot;said Talon while she tried to help Tucson stood up&quot;Just \n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; few hours, and then we can try to bring back Nightlight to her normal \n&gt;&gt; being&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy had stepped over between Rodimus and Tuscon and began running\n&gt; sensors over both of them. &quot;Both of you require rest and time to\n&gt; recharge your energy stores.&quot; He looked over at Tuscon, &quot;Yours is\n&gt; especially low.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon nodded as he looked at Tuscon, &quot;We will work on restoring your\n&gt; sight once your systems are strong enouh to handle it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
