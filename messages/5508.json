Maybe she didn&#39;t like him. Maybe she did, and didn&#39;t want \nto show it. Quickstrike was dumbfounded about it. He went on about himself \nand captured a last fish. He went back to the shore and ate both of them. \nAfterwards he transformed to his robot mode and jogged back to the Predacon \ncave. He knew she would be there. He thought of asking what went wrong. He \nought to, maybe it was something unconscious he did, and he would remind \nhimself never to do it again.\n\nHe had forgotten about his fatigueness, and at the entrance of the cave, his \nlegs went out on him. His feet spat sparks after he fell.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
