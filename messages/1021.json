I can&#39;t repair them! Not enough power left. \nSorry.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor kept on running but let a sigh escape her lips, so her plan to \ndefeat the Preds had to be postponed...big deal! But she still could follow \nthrough with the remainder of it...*\n\n&quot; That&#39;s okay Iris, you have done enough. Take a break.&quot;\n\n* She then turned to Teltoli and gestured towards a hall leading off to the \nweapon&#39;s hold.*\n\n&quot; I hope that I can trust you enough to follow the way to the weapon&#39;s hold \nand gather as many weapons as your arms can carry, then follow the hall to \nyour left to the bridge. Dump the weapons off there. I&#39;ll be there when you \ncome...&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor opened her com-link to Fracturcon as she continued to run \ntowards the bridge and left Teltoli to her orders...*\n\n&quot; I require to know your name, please. Also, how good are you at repair?&quot;\n\n* She knew that there were plenty of bots that could now repair the Ark&#39;s \nsystems but she had to give the new bot a try, it wouldn&#39;t be fair if she \ndidn&#39;t.\nIron Raptor then had to worry about the defence of the Ark while the repair \nwas under way, that was what she needed toe weapons for.\nOnce the weapons were at the bridge she would call the Maximals to come and \npick them up, then hopefully station them around the Ark as protection.\nIt would then be time to put some sort of plan into action, one that was \njust waiting to be used!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
