C=\r\nlash grabs his fist and simply plunges his hand into Atma&#39;s chest. Another =\r\none with their spark in their chest, it&#39;s too easy, is what Clash thought. =\r\nAtma pushed against Clash, to maybe make him release his grip, he was rippi=\r\nng away at Clash&#39;s arms. Clash&#39;s new claws come around and lift Atma into t=\r\nhe air, while the tentacles on his back entangle Atma&#39;s arms up. Technosis =\r\nwas seen through the corner of Atm&#39;as eye.\n\nAtma: Run...\n\nClash ripped Atma=\r\n&#39;s spark out and held it in his extractor. Atma was dropped and his spark a=\r\nbsorbed through the extractor. Technosis, seeing this, was terrified and hu=\r\nrt, but she dived underwater.\n\nClash: Where could that other one be? No mat=\r\nter, I don&#39;t need her cowardice.\n\nClash grew warts all over his organic par=\r\nts and grew spikes from his back around the tentacles. Clash flew off, sett=\r\ning the grass on fire and heading back to his mountain side to rest and hun=\r\nt for more victims. Technosis peeked up from the water to get a breath of a=\r\nir and seen that Clash was gone and there was a fire. Technosis put it out =\r\nby carrying water to it and looked at Atma&#39;s lifeless shell. Technosis touc=\r\nhed him, but there was nothing to him anymore, his life pulled from his bod=\r\ny. Technosis cried like a big grown up baby. She ran back to their old loca=\r\ntion to see if Psuedo was okay. He wasn&#39;t, of course, and was just like Atm=\r\na. Technosis fell on top of Psuedo&#39;s body, creating a cross from above and =\r\ndoing actually what she did best, the same thing she did ever since coming =\r\nto the planet, cry. She then pulled out a knife and was about to kill herse=\r\nlf, but stopped, remembering what KitKat said about cutting herself. There =\r\nwas no place to go now, nothing left of her life. Except for KitKat, that w=\r\nas the last place to go. But...she didn&#39;t even know where KitKat was. She k=\r\nnew what the Alliance base looked like.
