Now, our only hope to escape this th=\r\nreat is to relocate all together.  We must return to the Ark and see if we =\r\ncan get it flying just enough to relocate its position.  Before I became a =\r\nwarrior, I did extensive work in mechanical and weaponry restoration.  I ha=\r\nven&#39;t lost sight of those skills. I can attempt to restore the essential co=\r\nmponents for transport, and worry about the rest at a later time.  Of cours=\r\ne I will need a bit of help from anyone with engineering as their backgroun=\r\nd, which I believe Stanton and Bump, along with Legacy, could be a big help=\r\n.

He widens his eyes and dives toward=\r\n him, flying over his leader\n&gt;&gt; with out stretched wings, acting like a shi=\r\neld to protect him and\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight.  He looks down.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Sorry, sligh=\r\nt miscalculation, won&#39;t happen again.  I thought the clouds\n&gt;&gt; held water b=\r\nut they don&#39;t .

He was no\n&gt; ordinary sparrow or hawk but he was a giant phoeni=\r\nx with flamed\n&gt; slowing off of his wings and entire frame like a bonfire. O=\r\nnly his\n&gt; claws where he held the smaller form of NIGHTLIGHT was cool and d=\r\nark.\n&gt; Also the soot and debris that were falling seemed to be doing little=\r\n\n&gt; to RODIMUS as they quickly turned to ash and char when his flames hit\n&gt; =\r\nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; They both were flying above and yet away from the Volcano.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=E2=80=9CI do not think a simple rain will stop this volcano.=E2=80=9D RODI=\r\nMUS said\n&gt; his voice somehow wiser and deeper than it had been before. =E2=\r\n=80=9CIt is\n&gt; purging itself of a dark menace.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as RODIMU=\r\nS spoke dark magma began to flow from the mountain.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CCome, we =\r\nmust get the rest of the Maximals to safety.=E2=80=9D RODIMUS flew\n&gt; toward=\r\ns the others as the skies continued to darken and the ground\n&gt; began to tur=\r\nn black as it rained ash and fire. &quot;We can do nothing but\n&gt; try to heal and=\r\n get everyone away from here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With the ash falling and small burning =\r\nbits of fire and brimstone,\n&gt; plus the Magma flows this area will be danger=\r\nous until the volcano\n&gt; fueled storm abates. Smoke was begining to rise fro=\r\nm the ground as\n&gt; burning trees fell and burned.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: To anyone using =\r\nsensors or communications it is possible but\n&gt; spotty. The ash still seems =\r\nto have at least some of the properties of\n&gt; the interior of the Volcano an=\r\nd the distortion field that was up\n&gt; previously.
