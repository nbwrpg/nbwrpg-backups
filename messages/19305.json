Too many orders. Finally Darkmouse guided \nHell Beast out, but he was still confused. He looked at everyone.\n\n&quot;You. Nighteyes, someone called you. Why are you here. You came with \nMegatron&#39;s men. And KitKat, what were you thinking!?! Have you \nforgotten what Megatron did? Are you willing to forgive just to get \nhis military status? He&#39;s only going to use the council to his \nadvantage and finally complete his plan to rule all Predacons! You \nknow tht&#92;at! And now that Arachnia, Destructor and I are on the \ncouncil, you can not just make a decision like that on your own! I \nknow I said that I would leave many of the decisions to you and \nArachnia, but bringing the traitor into the fold? We all need to \nagree on that, and I certainly do not. He wants you dead, and he&#39;ll \nget it if you bring him here!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois felt a jolt. The cable had been severed. The portal to \nBattera&#39;s mind closed. But he could tell that her dream was still \ngoing on, but in her own head. But if she&#39;s not in his, that means....\n\nSuddenly a bright light apperaed, and their was Battera, or atleast \nin his dream, and she shot at the Alliance. As soon as they were hit, \nthey evaportated. The Alliance programming had been defeated. His \ncross disspapeared. And than their was darkness.\n\nVulois opened his eyes.\n\n\n"}}
