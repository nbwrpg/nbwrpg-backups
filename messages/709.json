Besides, she has a steady \npower supply, I admit that it will run out eventually but one single charge \nwon&#39;t take the shield down. She&#39;s a defence system and is doing all she is \ncapable of to defend the Ark from Predacon attack. Remember, she is also a \nback up system and when(or if) the Ark&#39;s own systems start running properly \nshe&#39;ll stop and let it take over again, until then it is her job to protect \nthe ship. Thank you.)\n\n* Zyber looked at Rowdy Wolf and sighed, why was he so edgy around her? \nBesides the fact that she was new to him he should at least begin to relax a \nlittle. She looked out at the field around them, the small herd of deer had \nmoved on and was now a good hundred meters away.\nHer stomach growled as a swift wind picked up and ruffled her fur.\nIt was beginning to get a little cold but she was used to it, her arctic \nhome made sure of that.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
