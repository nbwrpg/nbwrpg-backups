Using information comming from internal scanners, Straight Shot \n&gt; nodds, and indeed picks up a faint sign of life from within the cocoon \n&gt; surrounding Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s faint Perceptor but he is alive.  And appears to be stable.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson slows down to a halt.  He knew wheels would not do him any good at \n&gt; this point.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry, but I will not be able to carry everyone to the surface. it&#39;s \n&gt; a straight climb up without proper foot holds, or ramps.  I&#39;ll have to \n&gt; transform if we&#39;re going to get up there.  Straight Shot, you&#39;re small \n&gt; enough, you can get up there easilly.  I&#39;ll lend you a towe line so you \n&gt; can send it back down to aid the rest of us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Right, gotchya.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson opens his doors to let everyone out.

In fact Rodimus&#39; form cannot be truly seen, as he&#39;s covered\n&gt;&gt; &gt; head to foot in them, however every scan confirms that he is indeed in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there somewhere. Scans also reveal that although he is healthy, he is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; undergoiong his own ordeal, something left over from the insects. Time\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is of the essence to get him back and repaired.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As the party makes it way back to the Ark they can hear several\n&gt;&gt; &gt; explosions behind them, the walls rumbling around them but so far\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing seems to inhibit their travel.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Lord Elder was there at the headquarters,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; apparently he had not taken any time for rest or even to eat, instead\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he manned the communicatyion station waiting for any word.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;We read you Tuscon!&quot; Elder said as the call came in. &quot;We will have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; medical staff standing by when you get here.&quot; Elder manipulated a few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; controls as he spoke, &quot;and the shield is up and waiting for your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; entrance.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Elder turned back to Kup and just smiled broadly, &quot;They&#39;re alive!&quot; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said, nearly leaping out his chair with happniness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It takes Tuscon hours of driving, but finally Tuscon arrives at an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; opening, a final break in the long monotony of near featureless\n&gt;&gt; &gt; smoothly tunneled walls. They at long last arrive at an opening to a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rather deep pit.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The pit is very deep and very dark and it seems to go on for a very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; long time. It is roughly 8-10 feet and looking down it runs nearly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; straight down into the depths of the earth; even with artificial\n&gt;&gt; &gt; light, its end point cannot be seen as it continued into the darkness\n&gt;&gt; &gt; below. However looking up, several hundred feet up a tiny pinprick of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; light can be seen, it is the surface! However to reach the top one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; would need to be able to fly or have extremely good climbing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; abilities, as there are no hand holds and not even a single plant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; breaks the surface of the walls lining this area, the sides are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extremely smooth and sheer,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; almost as if someone had cut it with some sort of high energy beam. .\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From beneath Tuscon&#39;s position heat and noxious fumes rise from below,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clearly show the danger of failing to climb or fly properly and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; plunging into the super heated depths. It would be a grizzly end\n&gt;&gt; &gt; indeed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
