Those are seekers, and one slip from us, w=\r\ne&#39;re as good as jet kill.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From his observation post, Quickstride could=\r\n sense the worry in Rodimus&#39;s voice. He too was worried and continues to ke=\r\nep his ears and eyes peeled in all directions. He paws his left front hoof.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just what I was thinkn&#39; Rodimus.

Slippery stuff when there&#39;s a mole involved that we=\r\n don&#39;t know about..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; From where Night Shift was, he could not see the s=\r\neekers, yet, just by his radar systems, he could definitely tell that there=\r\n was a flying brigade around the fortress. He slowly comes to a stop.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nOh snap. Radar&#39;s teamn&#39; with enemy forces. Tucson do ya copy?

He douses his hea=\r\ndlights.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Bad news, my radar&#39;s just picked up a sentry around the fort=\r\nress spire, accordn&#39; ta the readings, they&#39;re seekers. Rat Trap&#39;n Windlord =\r\naint&#39; gonna get too close ta that tower. If they do, they&#39;re as good as pri=\r\nsoners.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson thinks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I certainly do not wish to risk their liv=\r\nes... I will inform them immediately of your findings.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns on his=\r\n com link to Rat Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rat Trap, do you read me? This is Tucson Prime,=\r\n over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gets the message.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I read ya Wheels. And I don&#39;t l=\r\nike what I see down there...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson now turns his direction toward the=\r\n sound of his sonars. He now picks up multiple pings as he too, slowly move=\r\ns into position.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You are aware of the pending danger, good. If you ca=\r\nn not enter the fortress, we will find alternate ways of doing so. Do not r=\r\nisk yourselves needlessly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya, but, Wheels, =\r\nwe really do owe ya one. If it weren&#39;t for you, none of us would be out her=\r\ne fightn&#39; for what we believe in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson pauses.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Be careful my f=\r\nriends, you are far too valuable to lose.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift remains parked.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is as far as I go for now. Unless those seekers are diverted, we =\r\ncan&#39;t do scrap.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to acknowledge Kup. Straight Shot looks down =\r\nto Night Shift from inside Kup&#39;s cab.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I got an idea. It&#39;s a long shot,=\r\n no pun intended but it might work. I am equipped with long range equipment=\r\n. What if Kup used me as a cross bow, to take out some of those seekers, cr=\r\neate a diversion so that way Windlord and Rat Trap could make it inside?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Night Shift spins a tire.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I dunno, sounds risky... What if they bar=\r\nrel after us? I ain&#39;t a speedster.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I=\r\nt&#39;s worth a shot. Let&#39;s run it by Tucson.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson now recieves a messag=\r\ne from Straight Shot. He ponders the daring move.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm, that would work=\r\n as a diversion but it&#39;s extremely risky... But nothing we&#39;ve never dealth =\r\nwith before.. All right, perhaps it is necesary to make a move. Straight Sh=\r\not, Kup, I want you to position yourselves as best you can. Kup, take robot=\r\n mode, Straight Shot, cross bow mode, and program your trajectory settings =\r\nto long range. Be sure to conceal yourselves amply. Night Shift, I&#39;ll need =\r\nyou to remain in vehicle mode, for a quick getaway. Rodimus, Quickstride, i=\r\nt has now come to my attention that unless a diversion is executed, Rat Tra=\r\np and Windlord may not make it into the fortress safely. Straight Shot is g=\r\noing to provide the diversion along with Kup&#39;s help. Be prepared, once this=\r\n diversion is in place, we may need you two to get into battle mode to fend=\r\n off any seeker that tries to attempt an attack on the Ark. I know these ch=\r\nanges are sudden, but unfortunately, there is a lot of uncertainty in this =\r\nmission. All right, battle stations everyone, things are about to get rocky=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As most of the crew waits at the Ark, or at least somewhat beh=\r\nind, Windlord\n&gt; &gt; and Ratrap begin the journey towards Hydras&#39; black tower.=\r\n Most of the trip\n&gt; &gt; is largely uneventful. The duo passed over rivers, st=\r\nreams, mountains and\n&gt; &gt; even an ocean to get to their destination.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n As they close in to perhaps within 50 kilometers they can see the tall ebo=\r\nny\n&gt; &gt; colored spire that is the dark tower, jutting out of a large lake of=\r\n glowing\n&gt; &gt; red hot magma like some dark fist of defiance; its dark well a=\r\nrmored surface\n&gt; &gt; glinting in the sun like well shined onyx.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As th=\r\ney get closer, perhaps within 20 kilometers, they can see dots swooping\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n around the tower looking something like birds of prey over a rabbit in the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fields. However the fields themselves are broken lands, rocks and ston=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; jutting out of a nearly featureless landscape.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Windlord a=\r\nnd Rat Trap get a little closer they can see that the dots are\n&gt; &gt; not bird=\r\ns at all, but they are jets, each one of them an exact replica of\n&gt; &gt; Scour=\r\nge! Five of them sweep through the skies their movements are a well\n&gt; &gt; orc=\r\nhestrated search pattern. Either they were looking for something, or\n&gt; &gt; ke=\r\neping an sensor open for anyone approaching. It was obvious that to\n&gt; &gt; app=\r\nroach any further in the open would risk detection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * * * * * * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Rodimus nodded at Quickstride, his fac=\r\ne obviously\n&gt; &gt; troubled. There was a part of him that knew that he needed =\r\nto be here at the\n&gt; &gt; Ark to protect it, yet another part of him wanted to =\r\nbe there where the\n&gt; &gt; action was.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He glanced at his screens, &quot;I do=\r\nn&#39;t know quickstride, maybe they do know of\n&gt; &gt; our plan already and are ju=\r\nst waiting for us to fall into a trap they have\n&gt; &gt; set.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
