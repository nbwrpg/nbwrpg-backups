Not long after the incident which forever\n&gt; removed his compassion, he volunteered for not only\n&gt; the great upgrade, but also an upgrade on his systems\n&gt; and left the Protectobots, instead requesting\n&gt; frontline combat- he increased his armour and\n&gt; firepower, and had Perceptor add a special ability in\n&gt; him, the ability to temporarily absorb any weapon or\n&gt; device into himself, along with arming himself with a\n&gt; series of vibroclaws that tear apart armour with the\n&gt; same efficiency as Transmetal 2 talons, along with a\n&gt; left wrist mounted electro disruptor, overloads any\n&gt; electronic equipment it hits, and a right wrist\n&gt; mounted null ray.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Most Autobots looked at it positively, seeing First\n&gt; Aid as gaining his nerve.  Optimus viewed it\n&gt; cautiously worried that this course of action might\n&gt; result in an even greater horror. However, he trusted\n&gt; in First Aid&#39;s entrenched pacifism to intrinsitacally\n&gt; remain, so allowed the upgrade. It was during the\n&gt; first mission where First Aid was on the front line\n&gt; against a group of Decepticons that to everyone&#39;s\n&gt; horro, the once compassionate doctor had become an\n&gt; unstopable killing machine. If it were cold blooded\n&gt; murder then the autobots might have possibly been able\n&gt; to handle it, however, what they saw was a\n&gt; frightening, malicious killer who seemed to delight in\n&gt; giving his victims a violent torturous death before\n&gt; extinguishing their sparks by crushing their spark\n&gt; containment chambers then shredding their sparks.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Horrified at this turn of events, the Autobots were\n&gt; faced with no choice but to place him in stasis- an\n&gt; act which cemented great animosity towards his fellow\n&gt; Autobots in his heart. In a similar vein to Protoform\n&gt; X, he was meant to be dumped stasis pod and all on a\n&gt; fbarren world where it was hoped he would be unable to\n&gt; harm another living thing. However, he was jetisoned\n&gt; along with all the other pods aboard the Axalon during\n&gt; crash landing. Amazingly his pod survived a crash\n&gt; landing and lay dormant underground, albeit affected\n&gt; by the quantum surge and changed into a transmetal. \n&gt; \n&gt; His scanners picking up the form of a Tasmanian Devil,\n&gt; and donning the name Nightstalk, he awoke as a\n&gt; sadistic berserker, estranged from his fellow maximals\n&gt; and driven my the malevolent wish to eradicate all\n&gt; Predicons from existence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Abilities: Nightstalk is one bot prepped for mainframe\n&gt; combat as cheetor would put it.  His beast mode is\n&gt; equipped with great speed and agility while being\n&gt; armed with energon teeth and claws identical to the\n&gt; retractable ones he uses in robot mode. His transmetal\n&gt; mode is a jet where he is armed with all three of his\n&gt; weapons. His favorite tactic in this mode is to use\n&gt; full powered shots from his electro disruptor to short\n&gt; out an oponent&#39;s engines and send them carreening to\n&gt; their death. These three vmodes in combination make\n&gt; him  a dangerous foe to all Predacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Weaknesses: Nightstalk&#39;s insanity is a double edged\n&gt; sword, while it works liek an adrenhaline facvotr, in\n&gt; the sense that short of blowing off a limb, most pain\n&gt; indicing damage he&#39;ll merely shrug off, it also makes\n&gt; him hostile towards his comrades, headstrong when\n&gt; logic would dictate pulling out or avoiding conflict\n&gt; and pretty likely to get himself in stasis lock long\n&gt; after a wiser bot would have withdrawn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strength: 9\n&gt; Intelligence: 6\n&gt; Speed: 8\n&gt; Endurance: 10\n&gt; Rank: 1\n&gt; Courage: 10\n&gt; Firepower: 7\n&gt; Skill: 7\n&gt; \n&gt; http://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
