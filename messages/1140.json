And I&#39;ll see you next fall.&quot;\n\n* Then Carnage raised her head and scanned, this ship was new!\nSuddenly she knew for a fact what ship this was...the ARK! She gasped in \nwonder as she looked around at the massive ship, she smiled and took a few \nsteps inside.\nCarnage looked around and almost seemed to feel right at home.\nWith a sigh she stepped back towards Cyber Claw and tapped her on the back \nwith the end of her tail.*\n\n&quot; Do you know what ship this is? It&#39;s the...Ark! The Autobot ship of the \nMaximal&#39;s ancestors. Amazing!&quot;\n\n* With that she then looked down at Cyber Claw and shook her head, what a \nsilly sight the clone made...to her anyway.\nShe sighed again and scanned the ship, she located the CR chamber rooms and \nthen began to head off in that direction, since they were here they might as \nwell repair like that one bot said.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
