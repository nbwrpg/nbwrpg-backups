You were \nnot a protoform, no. You were an autobot called Firedrill. I have been \nwarned about your pledge of alliegance to the Tripredacus. I am not \naccusing you of anything, I am merely telling you the facts. Somehow \nthe Renewal Chamber you were in reformatted you. You must know, \nhowever, that if Pacifix, the autobot leader, and I find that \nFiredrill can be revived, such thing could happen.\n\nBelthassan: That is, if you agree.
