I have a lot to respond to. hehe. :)\n\n* Iron Raptor decided not to really think about such things now, wondering \nslightly just where Shadow Cat and Snow Tech had gone off to. She hummed a \nslight tune on a short breath before she brough the air back in through her \nteeth, feeling the bite of the tiny little kitten. Slightly surprised that \nhis teeth got through her armored hand.\nThe armor on it retracted and she looked at the hand, two beads of \nmech-fluid seeping out from twon holes in her finger.\nIron Raptor furrowed her browns and looked down at the kitten, using her \nother hand to give him a fairly swift smack on the bottom.*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t you do that again! Bad kitty!&quot;\n\n* She growled but then relaxed her shoulders which had tensed up when the \nhitten had bitten her, both hands safely holding him down.\n&lt; Rotten little bugger.&gt; so her thoughts read before she cought a flicker of \nProwls.\nHe was thinking about how a first date would be like and where they could go \nfor one, glad that he agreed with her thoughts on that subject and agreeing \non his choice of atmosphere for the event too.\nShe was walking comfortably besides him, knowing that she DID love him but \njust needed to slow down a bit.\nShe was about to lean against Prowl more but he chose then to take his arm \naway from her waist and she was left to catch herself from falling, grasping \nthe kitten to her chest in slight panic before she got her balence back. \nBrining in a sigh of relief she looked down at the kitten, loosening her \nhold and hoping that she hadn&#39;t squished him.\nAll of them were well into the CF now, Iron blinking slightly and waiting \nfor her spark to slow down. THAT...had really frightened her for a moment, \nbut knowing why Prowl had let go of her.\nIt was a lonely feeling but one she brought on by thinking that they should \nslow down...even though she hadn&#39;t meant that much. Though, if Prowl thought \nit was best then she wasn&#39;t pushing it.\nBut she glanced at Prowl when he actually asked her out on a date, thinking \nthat he sounded like he was trying to start all over again. Nervouse even \nthough they had been throygh much more.\n&lt; Yes.&gt;she thought. Accepting his offer while looking back ahead of herself \nas they walked along, stroking the kitten even though she had slapped him \nmoments before.\nShe began to pass the bridge when a sidden flash of movement cought her \nattention, looking into the room and at the video screen that seemed to jump \nto life.\nShe squinted at first when she looked at the screen but the brightness faded \nand she could focus.\nShe was shocked to hear what came next.\nWildWing&#39;s voice boomed over the speakers, snapping her int attention.\nThe Ark was being attacked?!\nThat wasn&#39;t new news since they were always under attack but if that ship \nwasn&#39;t saved then all of the transformers might cease to exist, her \nexcluded.\nIron Raptor knew that she was no space fighter and standed no chance there, \nbut there were others, many who could.\nShe looked at Prowl, making decisions at lightnibg speed.\nIron Raptor slammed her fist into a button that activated the red alert all \nacross the ship, activating a ship wide camm channel as well*\n\n&quot; Maximals! The Ark is being attacked in space and we&#39;re going up. Fuel all \nshuttles and board, countdown will commence in 10 cycles. Go!&quot;\n\n* she turned to Prowl.\n&lt; I need you to take command of them up there, space is not my realm. Alert \nthem of this and board. Now go, quickly.&gt;\nIron Raptor then turned and opened a comm to Hysteria.*\n\n&quot; Hysteria, you and I are going to watch the launches from the command room. \nWe&#39;ll monitor them from here, also see if you can get me a diagnostic of the \nArk. I wanna see everything that happens when it happens.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
