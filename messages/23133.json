A tiny drop of mech fluid\n&gt; &gt; dripped from his hand. he caught it and squeezed it as if it were\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; of his enemies. &quot;We need Slayers knowledge of the Maximals if we\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; to defeat them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A bald Eagle flew low to avoid Maximal scanners. He was close to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; ark and knew they wouldn&#39;t be happy to see him. he swooped low and\n&gt; &gt; located the nearly frozen Slayer in stasis lock. Slayer was missing\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; limb as well as most of his mech fluid. Ignatius quickly\n&gt; transformed\n&gt; &gt; and put his arms around Slayer. he lifted the injured bots head and\n&gt; &gt; checked it&#39;s status. The rescuer transformed and once again an\n&gt; eagle\n&gt; &gt; floated above the ground. the great bird grabbed its prey and\n&gt; started\n&gt; &gt; flying back to the Trainers secret hideout.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
