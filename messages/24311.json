It consumed the entire spark. It was now \nextinquished. There was no machine that could keep it from stopping for it \nwas to late. The virus finished the job and the spark burst. Sending forth an \nexplosion. This was a natural reaction to the  destruction of a spark by the \nvirus. The explosion should have enough power to completley destroy hell \nbeat&#39;s body though it didnt matter for the spark was dead but do some damage \nto the object 30 feet near it. Hell Beast is dead.\n\n"}}
