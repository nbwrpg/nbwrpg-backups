Slowly, he made it back to his feet.\n\nThen he realized how damaged he was. There were some missing armor \nover most of his torso, and there was a gash from where a plasma shot \nhad hit him. It took him a lot of will to overcome his damages and \nwalk to Wolfenstein&#39;s side.\n\nVlad: You... You are a good warrior... You have proven yourself with \nthe wolf&#39;s soul... Here is what I suggest: either you become a \nbondsman to me, or we continue this fight. We both know we are weak. \nWhat say you?\n\nFarther, Tyrael sent a volley of needles that would be more accurate \non Proto.\n\nThen it started. He felt at first Skulletron&#39; input. Images of the two \npredacon brothers, thier grief and hurt. That did not bother him. They \nwere mere predacons. They were soldiers that had chosen their paths. \nThey were not his troops. Then, there was the Tripredacus and Preds \nliving together. That was something else. He knew it was a lost cause \nto destroy every single predacon, as good as the average Tripredacus \nwarrior was. But Megatron, he was the one, he was to be destroyed.\n\nThen the Orb... It shown images... Incoherent... but promises of power \nabove all. The fusion of two in one... Tyarius, whoever that was.\n\nThen Tyrael understood. He transformed to phoenix mode and flew \ndownward and into the base.\n\nThere was the Soul Orb. But before, he took something from the DNA \ncontainer. He had been a strong warrior, just not skilled enough to \nprevent his death. Now, Tyrael thought, he would have a second \nchance...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Chris Daniels&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Skulletron suddenly shudders, and is distracted from what he is \ndoing.  The Soul Orb&#39;s call strongly enters Skulletron&#39;s mind.  After \nstruggling to make sense of it, it finally quits taking its toll on \nhim.  However, in recieving the call, he also had visions.  Visions of \nthe Orbs, visions of Empath, and unexplainable visions.  He looks over \nat Wolfenstein and Tyrael, and then prepares.  He connects his mind \nwith Tyrael&#39;s mind.  After exploring his mind a little bit, Skulletron \ngets down to the dirty work.  He starts to send strong images to \nTyrael&#39;s mind.  Pictures of transformers battling mindlessly flow into \nTyrael&#39;s mind.  And then, Skulletron starts to send visions of \nTyrael&#39;s past into Tyrael&#39;s mind.  And then, pictures of Wolfenstein \ncome in.  Wolfenstein and DrillBit, as young bots, playing like \nbrothers do.  Them having good times together as they get older.  And \nthen, DrillBit&#39;s death is shown.  And images of Wolfenstein grieving \nextremely, so much sadness.  Skulletron then begins to bring out the \nvoices and images combined.  Multiple voices in Tyrael&#39;s mind, telling \nhim that this battle is pointless, telling him that its murder, \ntelling him about peace, about sadness, and to make an alliance.  The \nvoices and images show happiness among the Tripreds and Predacons \ntogether.  All in attempts to sway Tyrael&#39;s emotions and convince him \nto call this battle off and join for peace and happiness...\n\n\n"}}
