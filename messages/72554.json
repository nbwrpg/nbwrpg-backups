Her expressions c=\r\nhange dramatically, as she turns to Leo Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Dinobot - knew all th=\r\nat time, that Master Yoketron was killed?  Why didn&#39;t anyone tell us?  Does=\r\n anyone else know?  Has anyone even told Nightshift and Tucson?  I&#39;d like t=\r\na see Dinobot gather the courage ta tell Tucson in person what his comrade =\r\ndid ta our Sensai! &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride turns to Dinobot in shock.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I k=\r\nnow you preds are bad news, but wow, that really tips the scales, literally=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap also gasps.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; AND YOU THOUGHT WHAT I DID WAS BAD?!  HA=\r\nH, THAT WAS JUST PAYBACK FOR WHAT YOUR COMRADE DID TA THE GREATEST NINJABOT=\r\n MASTER OF ALL TIME! IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE ADMITTED TA MY =\r\nMISTAKE!  OHHH ARE YOU IN SERIOUS SCRAP NOW BUDDY!  JUST WAIT UNTIL TUCSON =\r\nIS NOTIFIED OF THIS! Then again... Ohh boy, Leo, I - think you better be th=\r\ne one ta tell &#39;em...  Master Yoketron was everything ta him, this is gonna =\r\nreally do serious damage ta his emotional circuitry.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nThere was a hooti=\r\nng, mocking laugh from DINOBOT, &quot;You do not know what COURAGE is, little Ma=\r\nximals.  I am more than fine to instruct you in it.&quot;\n\nGrinning then, still =\r\nin ihs TRANSMETAL mode, &quot;You forget we are at WAR.  On this planet, buildin=\r\ng on CYBERTRON.  You treat this as games.  It is not a game, little SCRAPLE=\r\nTS.  We are fighting for our future.  You toss out these wordes without any=\r\n understanding of what they are.  Your sensei died for his lack of capabili=\r\nties in combat, ashis better won in the fight.&quot;\n\nGRINNING madly at them in =\r\nhis tyrannosaurus mode, &quot;And you play at this.  You do not understand what =\r\nit is.  You think it is fun and games.  But perhaps in time you wil lsee wh=\r\nat the true nature of war is.  When the Predacons crush you under our armor=\r\ned boots!  Predacons, TRANSFORM AND RISE UP.&quot;\n\nReadying then to begin their=\r\n search patrol over of the area with HYDRAS signal.\n\n\n"}}
