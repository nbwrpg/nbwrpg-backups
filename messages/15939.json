He had no \nidea \n&gt; the peril he was in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank you for your support, Spears, but I can handle this. \nStriker, \n&gt; I really would&#39;nt be doing this if I were you. YHou are in alot of \n&gt; trouble. Ramulus willl come if I tell him to. Especially when I \n&gt; threaten yours and Sprears life. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll get to go \n&gt; free once I meet with him. I&#39;ll even have your memory wiped. Even \nthe \n&gt; memories of loving Spears, so you can forget about her. Now, I will \n&gt; show you that insolence is not tolerated!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon closed the hole and sent a comm to Hammer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Activate Torture guns.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sure thing, boss.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the cell two plasma cannons came out of panels and aimed at \n&gt; Striker.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kepp firing until he is dead or says mercy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The guns opened fire.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix looked at the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve got a plan. It&#39;ll take some time, though. We&#39;ve brought back \n&gt; major computer boards. This is like our day stuff. Top notch. We \n&gt; could use this new computer to scan around their base, for ways to \n&gt; attack. Who&#39;s in?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream sat in one of the chairs. The smell of mech fluid \nexcited \n&gt; him. He made a mental note not to double-cross Zardus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright. I&#39;m here to tell you that you are all in very big \ntrouble. \n&gt; Megatron is not lost. He&#39;s just gone out of social view for the \ntime \n&gt; being. He&#39;s working on something big. He&#39;s trying to unite the two \n&gt; Pred factions into one under his rule. Rumour has it he&#39;s been \n&gt; working with some Vok people, old Predacons revived. I don&#39;t know \n&gt; their names. All I know is that if Megatron&#39;s plan goes through, \n&gt; we&#39;re all doomed. Now, I;m a part of the faction that is \ntechnically \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s, even though both are basically his. After repeateds by \n&gt; Maximals that left us baseless, members fleeing and two membres \nnear \n&gt; death, I gave a mutiny speech. Have our group leave Megatron, ally \n&gt; with you and help you in anyway we can. It wen&#39;t over well with \nsome, \n&gt; but not Phobia, who is acting as our leader. He chose to go to Hell \n&gt; Beast&#39;s old base. Now, it&#39;s closer than this is. So maybe he&#39;s only \n&gt; concerned about getting our people to CR Chambers. Or maybe he&#39;s in \n&gt; on Megatron&#39;s plot. I couldn&#39;t decide, but I couldn&#39;t take the \nrisk, \n&gt; so i fought for the position to come here. I thought if I went to \nthe \n&gt; Pred base that Phobia would rat me out and that I would die in the \nCR \n&gt; Chamber. I will have to have a talk with Phobia. Speaking of CR \n&gt; Chambers, could I use one? I&#39;m pretty banged up here. So, you&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; warned Zardus. What will you do?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
