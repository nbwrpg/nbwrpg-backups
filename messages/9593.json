They would be out gunned, \nout numbered, out everything.  And all she had was a rifle, a few \ndaggers, and her little energon pistol.  She was also programmed to \nbe a scout, and computer wiz.  Not fighting.  She turned and looked \nback at the base.  She hoped she would see her pet rat again and \nsoon.  She wondered what plan Megatron had thought of and what his \nplan was.  She followed orders and followed Megatron into battle.\nBut she had a bad feeling about this whole thing.\n\n\n"}}
