But what \nI&#39;m saying is that Dachande made a link between the two RPG&#39;s, and \nwhen that happens what happens in one affects the other. In the Neo \nBeast Machines, the Pred gouvernment is ruled by one King named \nArchon. That has too affect the Neo Beast Wars. I personally think \nthat Dachande should have made it a separte RPG, but that was his \ndecision. Thye only thin we can do is have everyone vote against it \nand make Dachande re-start his RPG has a seperate entity, or have \neveryone follow what goes on in the NBM so that they can relate it in \nthe posts.)\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream laughed.\n\n&quot;Thank You Zardus. The new breed of Predacons will not forget your \ngenerosity, and will pay you back once the Maximals and Megatron are \nout of the way.&quot;\n\nHe turned to the Lavacons.\n\n&quot;I am Starscream, former ruler of the Decepticons and member of the \nnewest faction of Predacons, commanded under KitKat. Please hold on \none minute while I contact my group and than we will go.&quot;\n\nHe sent a comm:\n\n&quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus isn&#39;t letting us take the \nOblitercons, but he&#39;s letting us use the Lavacons, a group that by \nthe looks of things is stronger than the Oblitercons. We are about to \nleave now, but we need your co-ordinates.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois noticed that the firing had stopped. It was either they gave \nup on firing or are entering the mountain. It would be foolish to do \nso, but better think the foolish thing when dealing with fools.\n\n&quot;One of you three, stay in the back and wipe away our tracks. When we \nget to the main base their are 4 more warriors waiting. We&#39;ll get \nthem and than attack this enemy.&quot;\n\nHe kept walking.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon frowned.\n\n&quot;Too bad....I was hoping for you to tell me everything you knew about \nyour past life. It might help us know the secrets of our enemy \nbetter.&quot; He saw Spears emerge from the CR Chamber.\n\n&quot;Spears! Great! Looks like we can take everyone to battle after all. \nI&#39;d like you to meet Slayer, our new Trainer. He is the protoform of \nyour friend....&quot; Than Prebon eralized something. He needed to stop \ntalking about the past. Slayer did not have a chip, meaning that even \nthough he was loyal now, the future could change. If Slayer got \ncurious, he might sneak away to the Maximals. They would reveal his \nold personality and when tell all Trainer secrets.\n\n&quot;Never mind who he is. No one will ever talk of the past again. \nUnderstand? Good. Spears, I really have no mission right now. Soon we \nwill go into battle. We will gang up on Ramulus and kill him. Right \nnow though, Slayer, come with me. I want you try on a War Suit that \nwill help you fight.&quot;\n\nPrebon started walking down to the cargo area.\n\n\n"}}
