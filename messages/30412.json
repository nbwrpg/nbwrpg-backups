The former Pred leader would have destroyed these bots\nbefore the fight began but that would leave the faction weak.\n\nLunarpine saw the futal attempts that Ice was using and transformed to his\nhalf wolf mode. again he hit Megaton with his howl in the back.\n\nMegaton was caught off gaurd and forced forward, He remained on his feet and\nswung backward at the wolf with his spiked tail. Lunarpine easily avoided it\nby leaping straight up and over the tail.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, March 19, 2001 3:28 PM\nSubject: Re: Ice\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She saw her trick wasn&#39;t working.

He reached down\n&gt; as if to\n&gt; &gt; scoop some out with his claws. In his eyes he had two fistfulls of\n&gt; lava, but\n&gt; &gt; in reality he had two claws of dirt. He pulled his claws back and\n&gt; threw the\n&gt; &gt; molten earth/ dirt at Ice. &quot;You will move or you WILL be\n&gt; destroyed.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; yells knowing that the &quot;teddy&quot; bear in front of him wasn&#39;t worth\n&gt; his effort.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine stood up again, the hair on his back looked like\n&gt; needles. &quot;Leave\n&gt; &gt; her alone monster&quot; He yelled.
