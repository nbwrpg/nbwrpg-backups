No matter, she had enough to swamp this \nwhole pathetic ship!\nBrightBlade growls to herself as she backs up towards the door, wondering if \nshe had anything that could get through the seal.\nBut just then she suddenly sees the door dent inward, jumping back in \nsurprise at the sudden sound.\nWas it Maximals?\nShe raised her gun towards the door, ready to shoot incase it was.\nThis day was getting more interesting my the second. *\n.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
