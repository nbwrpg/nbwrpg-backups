I \nswear...some robots are just dense...&quot;\n\nDouble Punch, Injector, and Manterror lined up 8 feet from the edge of the \ncliff.\n\n&quot;Fire!&quot; the in cloak Double Punch ordered.  Loud noises echoed downwards to \nthe Ark, two stinger missiles, two energy-signature seeking missiles, and \nfour ion disks all lanced out at the Autobot craft, in a kind of wave.\n\n---\n\nSixshot got a target lock on the Ark.  He was surprised as weapons fire \nheaded for the Ark.  Hell Beast&#39;s Predacons (of course, Sixshot didn&#39;t know \nwho the forces belonged to).  Preparing to fire, he felt a few bolts strike \nthe bottom of his current space fighter mode.  Some of the systems began to \nshut down, at the same time the missiles and two neutron bombs launched, \nthough the neutron bombs and two missiles veered off course to 50 ft away \nfrom the Ark&#39;s starboard hull section, thought still close enough to possibly \ndo some damage.  But the other two missiles headed towards the middle of the \ntop of the Ark, Sixshot slowly losing altitude.\n\n---\n\nSmokescreen winced as he saw missiles head for the Ark.  Four out of six gone \nisn&#39;t that bad.  He hoped.  He continued up the cliff, two thirds of the way \nto the attacking Preds.\n\n---\n\nBeachcomber saw the blasts head for the Ark.  &quot;Slag!&quot; he yelled, firing a \nworthless pot shots up at where the Preds were, though he couldn&#39;t even see \nthem.  He continued up the cliff.\n\n===\n\nKoga Shuko acivated his intercom.  &quot;All forces, meet outside.  We are going \nto attack Hell Beast&#39;s worthless base.  Assemble quickly.&quot; he ordered, \nUnitorn, Hades, Anubis, and Serpentor followed him towards the outside of the \nNewcomer&#39;s base.\n\n"}}
