The move was simple but deadly! He&#39;d done this exact thing with \nmany bots before and knew that it didn&#39;t take smarts to pull it off. He knew \nelectrically what to do next.\nDinobot began to contract his arm and squeeze hard enough that he knew that \nshe would feel the air beginning to escape her lungs! If this battle had \nbeen for real then he would soon feel the satisfying snap of a broken spine!\nHe snarled fiercely!*\n\n&quot; Clever! Very clever! But it is also clever to take a few steps back after \nstriking an enemy so they cannot strike back so easily!&quot;\n\n* Dinobot squeezed a little harder, he had nothing against Tavatron for \nstriking him, that was the aim of the practice. He just simply wanted to \nshow her that he was not so easily defeated!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
