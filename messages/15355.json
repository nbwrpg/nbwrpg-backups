He was alone again. He was \nhealed on the inside, and was now fully consious. The mech fluid had \nstopped leaking, but there was still a problem: He had no arm. Almost \nas if the thought triggered it, Fliq began to feel an enormus surge \nof energy go throgu his body. He knew what it was. This is the same \nkind of feeling he got when he was inside Brix, and he became the \ncentaur. But this one was going a bit different. His arm started to \nregenerate, and when it did he was fine, but other changes occured. \nHis fur started to lighten, until it was almost completly white. And \ntoo cap it off, two massive horns greww out of his head. Fliq had \nbecome a fuzor. Part fox, part Ram.\n\nMeanwhile, Brix had been watching this, and gaped in magnificance.\n\n&quot;By the Matrix.....&quot; Fliq stirred a little, and opened his eyes.\n\n&quot;Hey Brix. How&#39;d it go?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re okay! That&#39;s great! How Ramulus doin?&quot;\n\n&quot;Ramulus. That was a weird trick he did. I saw HIS life flash before \nmy eyes. Except I didn&#39;t have eyes. But I&#39;ll ask.&quot;\n\nFliq focus&#39; a message into his body.\n\nRamulus? You okay buddy?\n\n\n\n"}}
