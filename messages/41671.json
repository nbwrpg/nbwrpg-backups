Away from the war that had been brewing up on\n  &gt; the sur=\r\nface. Now, she lay curled up in her den, under the ground.\n  &gt; Sound asleep=\r\n and snoozing peacefully.  Her whiskers twitched and her\n  &gt; head nudged ag=\r\nainst her paw.  She slowly opened her eyes and yawned.\n  &gt; &quot;Ooohhhhh, ouch.=\r\n&quot; she groaned softly to herself. &quot;Nothing like waking\n  &gt; up to cramps afte=\r\nr a long nap.&quot; Her body felt stiff from such a long\n  &gt; period of time with=\r\nout activity.  She was in mouse mode and stretched\n  &gt; her small body, tryi=\r\nng to get out the kinks. The only light in her\n  &gt; den was the light coming=\r\n from her own optics.
