One didn&#39;t bare their teeth at another without intending \nsome sort of threat. Tavatron could see Cyber Claw tense with each step \nDinobot took towards her. He wasn&#39;t exactly helping the situation either, \nbut she could understand where he was coming from. This &#39;bot was trying to \nsteal Dinobot&#39;s very identity, something that was his and his alone.\n\nTavatron watched in horror as Cyber Claw lunged at Dinobot, striking the \nfirst blow. This was about to erupt into an all out battle, the last thing \nanybody needed. In one fluid motion Tavatron unsheathed her drill sword and \npressed it to the back of Cyber Claw&#39;s neck. She took a sideways glance at \nDinobot, as if to say &#39;don&#39;t attack her&#39;. She then turned back to the raptor \nstanding before her, pressing the tip of her blade a little harder against \nCyber Claw&#39;s neck, but not hard enough to draw mech-fluid:\n\n&quot;Now, please, no one wants to fight. We know you are not who you claim to \nbe, and we will NOT harm you.&quot;\n\nTavatron gazed over at Dinobot, though she was speaking to Cyber Claw she \nwanted to be sure he heard her. Tavatron knew the chance was slim to none \nthat he would let Cyber Claw&#39;s attack go unpunished, but one could always \nhope:\n\n&quot;Please, just transform so we may solve this dispute peacefully.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
