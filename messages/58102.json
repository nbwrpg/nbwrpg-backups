I won&#39;t be posting as a \nplayer for some times, but I might do something else.\n\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ll act as a player right now, but I stay active in \nthe council. This also means the upcoming storylines.\n\nAirly and I have been talking about the storylines and we might start \nthem really soon. A feature that would be included is Non-player \ncharacters (NPC) that would be council-controlled. Also, depending on \nthe intensity of the fight, they would be quite killable.\n\nBe on the look-out. These storylines will be there soon (actually, as \nsoon as we can agree on them!).\n\nAlso, I&#39;m still in the council. Any technical question, I&#39;m there for \nit.\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
