I&#39;m an assistant of Darkfate... One of my duties is asign \nquarters to new comers, check the fuctions of cr&#39;s and stuff like \nthat, that are some of my several duties. I went to cr&#39;s and noticed \nthose bots, Miss blaze and the bully bull,  and I went to show them \ntheir quarter and they wanted that their quarters be close each \nother.. luckely we have them but them were close to Thyphon a pretty \ngruphy troublemaker; Well... I leaded them to their quarters, the \nbully-boy started speak about I don&#39;t know what, he said that he \nwanted to know why they can&#39;t remember anything and he moved me to a \ncomputer... he wanted that I found out the answers... And... Wait me \nasec&quot; said the male while using his large tongue pressed a button and \na door opened, the tongue came back to his mount and continue walking \nto Mess hall.\n\n&quot; What was I telling you? ohhh yes.. they liked answers, so I scared \ntried to win time but my password aren&#39;t acepted &#39;cause I can&#39;t open \nall computer&#39;s files, my status doesn&#39;t need it... He was\ngetting mad and I scared used my tongue to give the alarm and ran \naway... Most of bots think that I&#39;m a coward... But I don&#39;t a warrior-\nbot, I&#39;m.. I&#39;m... I have others fuctions... I ran towars Thyphon&#39;s \nquarters to looking for help... He&#39;s the last Predacon in \nBlackFortres to feel mercy but he was my last chance to survive the \nbot... Later The bull and sea snake started fight and I don&#39;t know \nwhat happened after that... that I woke up in cr&#39;s... &quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
