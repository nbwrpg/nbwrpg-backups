One was tall, with beam weapons mounted into his body.  \n&gt; His \n&gt; &gt; face was always a perpetual sneer, which cleverly disguised his \n&gt; lack \n&gt; &gt; of thinking. The other, also tall, was much differant.  He was \n&gt; like a \n&gt; &gt; dignitary or stately male.  But his regal appearance hide his \n&gt; &gt; incredible indurance, he survived many battles, and thus his \n&gt; &gt; judgement was affected.  He regarded his companion with disgust, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; was inferior.  Suddenly a fmale voice rang out.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Splattercannon, Necross, you are to proceed to the Maximal base \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; the planet.

They shortly \n&gt; come \n&gt; &gt; upon an energon cache, consume their fill, and then leave for \nthe \n&gt; &gt; planet below, intent on fighting this day.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
