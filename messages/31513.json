I think my comp is functioning pretty much ok now, so I&#39;m\nback. I just read 150+ posts, so this might be grossly inaccurate. It it is,\nsorry.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Autofire/Zardus/The Galactors/The Lavacons/Prowl/Kluster/Grimmler::\n&gt;\n&gt; Autofire recieves the signal from Megatron, yelling a battle cry and\nrunning toward the CF, only to be met with a smoke bomb as soon as he\nstarted running. He swears, waving the smoke away and backing up, firing his\nchain guns blindly in the general direction of the CF. He grunts as two\nobjects hit him in the back, feeling his systems struggle as they tried to\nregain power, the two objects that had hit him draining energy faster than\nhe could replace it.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spins around, backing away from the draining energy fields that the two\nmissiles fired by Zardus had created. The drain lessens and his power levels\nbegin to rise again. He looks up at the enemy, watching Zardus fly in, more\nthan ten Alliance bots following. This was definitely not good.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, attack,&quot; he replies to the member of the Predacons (gestalt group,\nnot faction) who had sent him a comm, aiming both chain guns at Zardus and\nfiring more than two dozen shots from each.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus angles up, the shots fired by the bot he had just hit with the\nmissiles missing. He scans the area, seeing that there were a good amount of\nDecepticons here. He activates his comm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Astral,&quot; he says into it, &quot;New orders. Come and aid at this battle, bring\nall the troops that you can.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The Galactors spread out as they fly into the scene. Supernova aims his\nmissile launcher, letting loose several shots at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;Lessee, who I wanna kill?&quot; Flare says, then fires two grenades down at\nSinnertwin.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Vicyr, completely cloaked, flies below the others, firing three laser\nbolts at Rampage.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slasys aims carefully, firing two missiles with deadly precision down at\nRazorclaw.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scrap, flying to the left of the rest of the group, fires four lasers down\nat Rippersnapper.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl spins around to look at the smoke when he recieves Quarto&#39;s message,\nthankful for the warning. He sees Alliance bots fly in in the distance and\nopen fire on the attackers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Time for battle yet again,&quot; he says to Mantle, flying into the air and\nseeing someone attacking behind the CF. He flies toward Fireblade, landing\nquickly near Firedrill and his friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nice to see you both up and about,&quot; he says to the two that he hadn&#39;t\nseen conscious untill now. &quot;You guys are welcome to help defend the base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl lifts off again, flying at Fireblade and firing two missiles at him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster runs out of the CF as the alarms go off, his missile launcher\nfiring two missiles at Rippersnapper as soon as he gets out of the door,\naiming carefully as to not hit any Maximals.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; (Argh, forgot about Grimmler! Sorry if I didn&#39;t reply to your last post\nwith Tremmer, Megan)\n&gt;\n&gt; Grimmler hears gunfire as he heads back to the CF. &quot;Slag! We&#39;re under\nattack again!&quot; He exclaims and runs off toward the ship, motioning for\nTremmer to follow.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Rippersnapper/Preadcons::\n&gt; &gt; Rippersnapper&#39;s impatience increases, &quot;Signal!

I am Razorclaw of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacons. Megatron sent me and my Predacons as\n&gt; &gt; renforcements, he told us to expect a signal to attack soon, and\n&gt; &gt; we are arriving and ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divebomb reaches Autofire first, lands and transforms, looking\n&gt; &gt; around and smiling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rampage is thundering on behind Razorclaw, a sleek panther, a\n&gt; &gt; blur on the background. He dodges trees, speeding to the\n&gt; &gt; destination, Razorclaw doing likewise, after his commlink message.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
