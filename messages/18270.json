Deemos had been hidin behind a tree since Mobster dropped him\nin order to block that shot. (Forgot to mention earlier) Deemos fled into\nthe base and got on a loudspeaker, getting a devious idea.\n\n&quot;I admit, Alliance, you are the better warriors here, but we are still a\nfine group indeed. How about we join you? Would you mind giving up 2\nsoldiers (My bots are the ones he is talking about) in order to enlist my\nlarge group? No jokes, no tricks, just an Alliance with the Alliance, to\ndestroy the Maximals and Predacons both.
