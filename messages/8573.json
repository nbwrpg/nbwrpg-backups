He stared in panic at the Metal \nBeast \n&gt; that stepped closer to them. It stared at Stingtra and brought two \nmassive \n&gt; cannons from it shoulders to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf&#39;s eyes grew large as he saw the metal wolf-like creature \nand \n&gt; Stingtrra have their stand-off. He saw Quickstrike on the ground, \npossibly \n&gt; damaged. He charged out into section of the cavern as soon as \nTerrorsaur \n&gt; took off into the air.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
