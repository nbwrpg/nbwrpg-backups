Phelan Kell took \nRagnar as a bondsman because he had been an able and intelligent \nwarrior, something Phelan knew would serve the Wolves. Ragnar served \nfor about two years as a mech technician before he was deemed worthy \nto become a warrior again. The same thing happened when he was \ncaptured by the Ghost Bears. In short, the bondsman serves the \nbondsmaster and pushes himself to become a warrior once more.

However,\n&gt; &gt; we train our \n&gt; &gt; warriors so that they understand strategies as well\n&gt; &gt; as tactics. In \n&gt; &gt; your case though, I will support you and help you\n&gt; &gt; with strategies, and \n&gt; &gt; I hope so will Ragnar. That man is a\n&gt; &gt; strategic-planner born.

The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a\n&gt; &gt; circle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight zellbringen, single combat.
