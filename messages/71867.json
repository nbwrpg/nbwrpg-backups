Military strategy was one of his areas of exp=\r\nertise and it was a good opportunity to exercise his skills as a strategist=\r\n.\n\n&quot; before I evolved into a Prime, I spent quite a few vorns assisting the=\r\n Autobots in the military strategy department.  And this one here, is very =\r\nmuch like something I&#39;ve seen before.  Not by Unicronians but by the Decept=\r\nicons back in the days of the wars on Iacon.  I was only a rookie at the ti=\r\nme but I&#39;ve always had a knack in this field of study so the officers gave =\r\nme a chance to attempt to crack a very complex case.  It had to do with how=\r\n they were causing Autobots to vanish on the battlefield.  As everything is=\r\n now it was back then.  They vanished in various quadrants and when I used =\r\na holographic map and drew lines that connected those locations, it came up=\r\n with an epicenter of activity around the drawn lines.  I told the officers=\r\n I wasn&#39;t a hundred percent sure but it was possible that the location was =\r\nthe area we were looking for.  They investigated and they found the missing=\r\n Autobots housed in an abandoned complex on Cybertron.   It was one of Shoc=\r\nkwave&#39;s master plans that were intended to remain a mystery but he did not =\r\ncount on a not so average Autobot to figure it out.  I was always considere=\r\nd to be a bit strange, and off the beaten path.  But the council kept me on=\r\n their team all the same.  They said due to my rebel like nature, that I wo=\r\nuld not be chosen as a commander but my skills were a great asset to them. =\r\n I was content with their decision all the same.  I was comfortable just be=\r\ning who I was.  So if I&#39;m not a good fit as a Prime, I respect their decisi=\r\non. &quot;\n\nHe returns to robot mode.  He looks to Leo Prime with a strategists =\r\nexpression.\n\n&quot; I may be wrong about my theory but I&#39;m curious to see if thi=\r\ns case is similar to the one I decoded back on Cybertron.   And if it is, w=\r\ne could even locate the purpetrator as well.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and =\r\nconstantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 24, 2011, at 8:00 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; understandab=\r\nle, land travel does take more time than flight. It gives me\n&gt; &gt; a chance t=\r\no collect my thoughts. And as I said earlier, I will not favor\n&gt; &gt; anyone, =\r\nthey all get treated the same way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns his attentions to=\r\n the disappearances of Cheetor, Cyclonus,\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus, and now Optimus Prim=\r\nal. He then thinks for a moment about Rodimus,\n&gt; &gt; lightly tapping a claw i=\r\nn deep thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I remember the last location Cheetor was in, and =\r\nI logged it in the system\n&gt; &gt; computer. I also logged the last location Rod=\r\nimus and Cyclonus were last\n&gt; &gt; known to be. Now I need to know where Optim=\r\nus Primal was last seen and his\n&gt; &gt; last coordinates. I want to see if thes=\r\ne events have a geological pattern\n&gt; &gt; that somehow leads to the center of =\r\nactivity. We trace lines over the other\n&gt; &gt; locations and in the middle of =\r\nthat, is the exact location of our adversary.\n&gt; &gt; Now we Also throw in the =\r\ndirection of the dinosaurs last path and that too\n&gt; &gt; will play a part as t=\r\no giving us visual clues as how to solve this mystery\n&gt; &gt; and deal with it =\r\nappropriately. Slag I wish there was a holographic map in\n&gt; &gt; here, I could=\r\n show you what I mean instead of just telling you about it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He the=\r\nn thinks a bit more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Hmmm, going back to Rodimus... Before we had=\r\n our disagreement, I never did\n&gt; &gt; notice a shift in his IFF that would war=\r\nrant a reversion back to Predacon\n&gt; &gt; status.. Come to think of it, I never=\r\n got a positive ID on it. That means\n&gt; &gt; either some other alien force has =\r\ntaken him or.... Perhaps constructed an\n&gt; &gt; evil clone and programmed him t=\r\no act just like Rodimus himself. Why didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; I notice this before? Leo, =\r\nthe real Rodimus might be out there along with\n&gt; &gt; everyone else, inluding =\r\nOptimus Primal. That&#39;s it! That&#39;s why they want\n&gt; &gt; Elita! She&#39;s the daught=\r\ner of a Prime! DNA EXTRACTION!

It gives m=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a chance to collect my thoughts.  And as I said earlier, I will =\r\nnot favor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; anyone, they all get treated the same way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; He then turns his attentions to the disappearances of Cheetor, Cyclon=\r\nus,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus, and now Optimus Primal.  He then thinks for a moment =\r\nabout Rodimus,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lightly tapping a claw in deep thought.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remember the last location Cheetor was in, and I logged it in th=\r\ne system&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; computer.   I also logged the last location Rodimus and C=\r\nyclonus were last&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; known to be.  Now I need to know where Optimus P=\r\nrimal was last seen and his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; last coordinates.  I want to see if th=\r\nese events have a geological pattern&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that somehow leads to the cen=\r\nter of activity.  We trace lines over the other&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; locations and in t=\r\nhe middle of that, is the exact location of our adversary.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Now we=\r\n Also throw in the direction of the dinosaurs last path and that too&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; will play a part as to giving us visual clues as how to solve this myste=\r\nry&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and deal with it appropriately.  Slag I wish there was a hologr=\r\naphic map in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; here, I could show you what I mean instead of just te=\r\nlling you about it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He then thinks a bit more.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, going back to Rodimus... Before we had our disagreement, I=\r\n never did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; notice a shift in his IFF that would warrant a reversio=\r\nn back to Predacon&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; status..  Come to think of it, I never got a po=\r\nsitive ID on it.  That means&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; either some other alien force has tak=\r\nen him or.... Perhaps constructed an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; evil clone and programmed him=\r\n to act just like Rodimus himself.   Why didn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I notice this befo=\r\nre?  Leo, the real Rodimus might be out there along with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; everyone =\r\nelse, inluding Optimus Primal.   That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s why they want&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nElita!
