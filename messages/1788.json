Then she would be in big trouble!\n&gt; Rage looked around but spotted no real bots that seemed to her liking or\n&gt; taste, she then began to sniff the air. Wait!\n&gt; Her stomach rumbled, she smelled fowl!\n&gt; Rage looed around but saw nothing that matched the scent, she then put her\n&gt; snout to the wind and began to follow it.\n&gt; She stretched her body up so that she could get a better reading on the\n&gt; smell, it was coming from the bushes!\n&gt; Rage snapped her head towards where she thought that she smelled some sort\n&gt; of bird, her stomach growled again.\n&gt; Perhaps it was her lucky day after all!*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 72% off on Name brand Watches!\n&gt; Come and buy today and get free shipping!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/_/_/958699862/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
