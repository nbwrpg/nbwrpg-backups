He stopped, curious about how and why bots on this\n&gt; planet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be useing such basic frequencies. &quot;Go on ahead, I&#39;ll catch\n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to you.&quot; He radio&#39;d back to Attilah and Kali.  He reset his course\n&gt; &gt; &gt; south on an intercept course.
