If BotA and BotB are \nalso talking to BotC, then there is a problem if BotA and BotB go \noff on a talking spree, while BotC is left behind.\n\nWith battle situations it becomes very apparent that there is a \nproblem if several people start posting a lot more than other \npeople. The battle can get rather bent out of shape as far as the \ntime line is concerened.\n\nI&#39;m not giving any numbers just presenting the idea. Council and \npolls can sort out the rest, or discard the idea entirely. =)\n\n-J\n\n*the exhausted walking zombie... yea... something like that*\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m really sorry it&#39;s come to this, but the obsession with having \nthe \n&gt; last word displayed by some members of the group is making it \n&gt; virtually impossible for me to keep up with this RPG.  When I sign \n&gt; on, all I ever see is strings of rapid-fire post exchanges between \n&gt; two individuals, which generally leaves a few characters miles \nahead \n&gt; of everyone else in the timeline.  It&#39;s frustrating to find your \n&gt; characters dropped by the wayside simply because your limited \nwindows \n&gt; of Internet time each day don&#39;t coincide with the rest of the \ngroup.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a great RPG on most fronts, but if this trend of forcing \nfolks \n&gt; like me to weed through 20-40 posts a day and desperately try to \nplay \n&gt; catch-up with our characters continues, well, you&#39;re going to be \nleft \n&gt; with one less member.  I simply don&#39;t have the time or the \npatience \n&gt; to keep up with this much longer.  Those responsible for skewing \nthis \n&gt; RPG in an annoying, unfair, and unrealistic manner should know who \n&gt; they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; Council members, PLEASE put some sort of cap on the number of \nposts \n&gt; per character each day.  If nothing else, it gives everyone a \nchance \n&gt; to participate without fighting to get a word in edgewise.\n\n\n"}}
