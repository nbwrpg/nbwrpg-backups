He turned his \nhead back to Drill Bit, who sounded naive enough to be annoyed with \ngoing with Tarantulas. How stupid. The whole group was weakened and \nfull of fools, so all he could do was tell him to go, like a newborn? \nThe sense of the Predacons were fading. He rolled his eyes.\n\nHe saw Cave-In still lying on the ground. She was newborn, needing \nguidance. He hopped over and grabbed her shoulders with his claws. He \nlifted himself into the air, flapping his wings to hover.\n\nHe was ready to go.\n\n\n"}}
