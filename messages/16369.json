Whom would \nyou consider joining, Destuctor or the allience?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I think we should consider our resources. Destructor offered us \n&gt; help, the alliance offered us help, I think we should move one step \n&gt; at a time. We have a five bot group right now, Destructor makes \nsix, \n&gt; Dollen and GoldenEye will be back soon theres eight add the \nalliance \n&gt; forces and we&#39;ll have a small army working with us, and then, then \n&gt; followers will join us or fall before us, and Megatron will be our \n&gt; first victim.&quot; Phobias eyes lit up at the prospect of being the bot \n&gt; behind the bot who joined the forces of Predacon and Alliance, \nbeing \n&gt; the unknown shadow that the great leaders throughout history have \n&gt; cast. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She thought about the situation.  She didn&#39;t know the bots who \nwere \n&gt; &gt; so far, helping htem out.  Usually when one helped, they expected \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; favor returned, and with more in return than what was offered.  \nShe \n&gt; &gt; looked at Phobia,&quot;Tell me, who is this Destrustor?  And why did \nhe \n&gt; &gt; help us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in return. \n&gt; Also, \n&gt; &gt; if Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us with? I \n&gt; &gt; heard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down and \n&gt; &gt; sighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit right now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we takled \nto \n&gt; &gt; this Desctuctor. Then we need to get our group together.  I  know \n&gt; I&quot;m \n&gt; &gt; not the only one who wants to get Megatron for deserting us.  And \n&gt; &gt; once Megatron is done with, we can then start looking for a base \nof \n&gt; &gt; our own.  BUt Megatron has to be delt with. As long as he is \n&gt; around, \n&gt; &gt; we will never have a moment&#39;s rest.  After that,&quot; she suddenly \nhad \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; angry look on her face,&quot;After that, I want to pay back those \n&gt; slagging \n&gt; &gt; maximals.&quot; She relaxed, &quot;What do you think Phobia?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re currently at the base of a Predacon named Destrucror, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starscreem went ahead to the alliance base, Goldeneye and \nDollen \n&gt; &gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; considering returning to us and Megatron is currently without \n&gt; &gt; &gt; followers I suggest we meet the alliance, track him down and \ntake \n&gt; &gt; &gt; care of our problems one at a time.&quot; Phobia knew to leave out \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; part about Destructors offer so he&#39;d have an ace in the hole if \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fell through. He didn&#39;t fully trust Destructor yet and KitKats \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trusting ways may get in the way of earning that trust.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
