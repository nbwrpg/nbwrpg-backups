While \nhe moved her back and forth, she could feel her hands coming back on \nline. She growled but played as thought she couldn&#39;t even move her \noptics if she wanted to. &quot;You know, your good. Your very good. \nHowever, you don&#39;t have to rub it in.&quot;  She frowned a bit and wished \nher body would recover faster. She grumbled, &quot;Great, and if I was \naround when you and your brother were together, who knows if I&#39;d \nstill be functioning or not. i don&#39;t think I&#39;d survive. Not the way \nyou mix drinks.&quot;  She kept swaying as he moved her back and forth. \nShe felt her legs come on line. She she waited just a second to run a \nquick internal diognostic. She was about 50 %.  She decided to use \nwhat she had. She stood up as quickly as possible. She turned and \nleaned on the back of the chair. She kissed Malice on the nose and \nthen walked/hobbled/limped out towards the mess hall door. &quot;You too \ncan learn a few things Oh great Sarcastic One.&quot; as she walked out \ninto the hallway.  She stopped just outside the door and leaned \nagainst the wall. &quot;Sheesh, note to self, don&#39;t drink with that bot \nagain,&quot; under her breath. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice began to chuckle softly.  Then it got louder, and loude, \nuntil it sounded a lot like Megatron, the Leader of the Decepticons.  \nOne could easily confuse Malice for Megatron.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; He had to admit, she played her act extremly well.\n&gt; &quot;Oh you don&#39;t mean that, now do you?  You&#39;re just mad I caught on \nto you so quickly.  At least I didn&#39;t throw you into stasis lock and \ndo something bad to you.&quot;\n&gt; He let loose another manical laugh, before stepping out from behind \nthe counter.  He stood behind Wolfblade, taking her shoulders in his \nbig hands and gently tossed her back and forth in between his hands.  \n&gt; &quot;Your a good Maximal or Maxitron or whatever, too bad you were not \nonline when me and my brother came online.  You&#39;d be a real riot!   \nOh well, live and learn.  Well at least you should learned a lesson \nfrom this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sorry I haven&#39;t posted lately. Just got out of the hospital. \nBut \n&gt; I&#39;m feeling much better now. \n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; Wolfblade:\n&gt; She took the drink and downed it. She didn&#39;t budge. Didn&#39;t even \n&gt; twitch. However, she couldn&#39;t move to save her life. She smiled \n&gt; slightly and looked at him. He was spiking her drinks and she was \n&gt; just now realizing it. She was mad at him for now her motor skills \n&gt; went into stasis for a  bit. She took a deep breath and looked at \n&gt; him. &quot;Malice, I like you. You are a good comrad in arms. However, \nyou \n&gt; ever...and I mean EVER do that again, and once I can move again \nI&#39;ll \n&gt; terminate your programs perminantely.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but \nchuckle. \n&gt; He got the better side of her and she was more frustrated at \nherself \n&gt; for letting her guard down.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Des Wraith, the Archfiend of Flames.
