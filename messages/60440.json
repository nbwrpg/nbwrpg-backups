Necross snarled and \ntransformed into his gun platform and opened fire on the Maximal with \neverything.\n\nSplattercannon shifted his deadly sights to Cyaltron and Necross.  \nHis fellow minion had sustained some damage, so Splattercannon \ndecided it was time to assist Necross.  Darkfate and BlackKnightmare \ncould handle Black Fang.  He aimed his beam gatling rifle and opened \nfire on Cyaltron.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt; Crylatron snarled as he took a shot blowing his right sword out of \nhis hand, he ahs continued his charge and was ontop of the bot and \ncontinued his momentum with his left hand bringing down his crystal \nsword at the bot and firing shards of crystal from the jewel on his \nchest.\n\n\n"}}
