Some of the more\n&gt; exotic equipment \n&gt; surprises her a bit, but she&#39;s more interested in\n&gt; the basics so far - \n&gt; primarily engine components.\n&gt; \n&gt; Riekan/Torin::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How&#39;s our companion, Torin?&quot; Riekan asks.  &quot;All the\n&gt; procedures taken \n&gt; care of?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Years ago, my friend,&quot; Torin replies as he\n&gt; reconnects damaged wires \n&gt; behind a service panel.  &quot;We&#39;ve been prepared for\n&gt; something like this \n&gt; for a long time.  It would take a master hacker to\n&gt; detect any of the \n&gt; programs we installed - and a true legend to remove\n&gt; them without \n&gt; doing permanent mental damage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The two males share a sinister laugh ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Phoenix::\n&gt; \n&gt; The nightmares strike again.  Phoenix once again\n&gt; relives her most \n&gt; traumatic experience, as Clawful comes closer and\n&gt; closer, a sickening \n&gt; leer on his face; she does everything she can to\n&gt; fend him off, but \n&gt; it&#39;s far from enough.  Once again she feels the pain\n&gt; and humiliation \n&gt; that is every girl&#39;s worst fear ...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NOOOOOO!!!&quot;  The prisoner sits bolt upright,\n&gt; snapping awake.  \n&gt; Looking wildly around, she realizes once again it&#39;s\n&gt; been a long time \n&gt; since that day.  She&#39;s stranded with her captors on\n&gt; some planet in \n&gt; the distant past.  And Clawful, thankfully, is in\n&gt; his quarters in \n&gt; stasis lock.  Finally, Phoenix manages to relax.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jayde::\n&gt; \n&gt; Phoenix is not the only one with the past in mind,\n&gt; as Jayde reaches \n&gt; up to key the door to her sister&#39;s quarters.  Lunara\n&gt; is there, as \n&gt; before, stasis-locked on the recharge bed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lunara,&quot; Jayde whispers, even though she knows the\n&gt; larger bot can&#39;t \n&gt; hear her, &quot;please don&#39;t die on me.&quot;  The blue and\n&gt; black Rogue walks \n&gt; over to Lunara&#39;s bedside.  &quot;We&#39;ve been together as\n&gt; long as I&#39;ve been \n&gt; online.  I don&#39;t know how I could get by without you\n&gt; in my life.&quot;  \n&gt; She reaches into her subspace compartment and pulls\n&gt; out a small disk \n&gt; with a Maximal insignia on it.  A sad smile forms on\n&gt; her face.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You always told me to get rid of this, that it\n&gt; would just get me in \n&gt; trouble.  I wish I could, but I just can&#39;t help\n&gt; thinking sometimes - \n&gt; what would it be like, if we&#39;d never left to join\n&gt; the Rogues?  Where \n&gt; would we be now?  Would you still be drawing crowds\n&gt; with your songs \n&gt; and dance routines?  Would we be off someplace, not\n&gt; knowing or caring \n&gt; what some funky group of terrorists was up to - just\n&gt; like we don&#39;t \n&gt; really care what our fellow Maximals are doing now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker gets back to his shuttle, lands, and\n&gt; transforms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  Just pick out the stuff you need and\n&gt; I&#39;ll get the \n&gt; transport \n&gt; &gt; ready.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He goes inside, takes a crowbar, and opens a crate\n&gt; with it and \n&gt; begins \n&gt; &gt; to get out wheels.  Nearby is any almost\n&gt; inperceptible secret \n&gt; &gt; compartment, but he throws the lid of the box over\n&gt; it just in case.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
