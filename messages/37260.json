He stumbled as he did\nso \nand grabbed hold of Beachcomber&#39;s arm to steady himself. He still \nached and he knew he would need further medical attention when he got \nhome. However, the stranger&#39;s repairs HAD helped. He placed his hands \non BC&#39;s shoulders and gave him a grateful smile.\n    &quot;Thank...you.&quot; he said. If there was a time he sounded like his \nbrother Starscream, it was then. Redhot smiled internally to himself. \nHe figured it must be odd for the Autobot to hear someone with \nStarscream&#39;s voice. It must be especially odd to see someone looking \nlike a Decepticon seeker wearing the Autobot symbol.\n    Redhot chuckled to himself. \n    &quot;Most people...&quot; he began, &quot;who see and hear me... either... \nfreak..or concider m..me...a threat.&quot; His legs trembled and he\nlowered \nhimself to his knees. &quot;Thank you...fo..for not letting...preconceived \njudgement... from...from helping me in..my..t..time of n..nee..need.&quot;\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**********************************\n\n\n"}}
