The mission to recover both Tavatron and Dinobot.\nShe would have to send a group of Maximals out to locate and bring back both \nof her missing bots, and to bring them back in whatever shape they may be \nin.\nIron Raptor thought about the team that she would send out when her thoughts \nwere suddenly interrupted by her com-link, the sound of Firearms voice \nbringing her back to the present.\nShe shook her head for a moment to clear it, listening to Firearms request.\nHer mind narrowed as she thought about both Hell Drak�s capture and Tavatron \nand Dinobot�s delayed return, and how Firearm requested troops for Hell \nDraks rescue mission.\nThere was something there in those two subjects that she could use, \nsomething that would get both missions done at almost the same time.\nAnd she knew just what it was.\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to Firearm and spoke. *\n\n� Request accepted, Firearm. Take five bots and bring this Hell Drak back to \nus. However�there�s also another mission I would like you and your group to \nrun. A search and recover. On your way back, take a few bots and search Grid \n16 for any traces of two Maximal transformers that haven�t come back to us \nfrom a past mission. Their signatures have stopped there. Both Tavatron and \nDinobots�. I want them found and brought back�no matter what condition you \nfind them in. Alright?�\n\n* She couldn�t help but speak with worry, it plain in her voice as she \nfinished speaking.\nIn her mind she knew that they should have been back by now, even if one \nwasn�t able to make it the other would have brought them back safely.\nBut neither had shown any sign of return, and to her that spelled that both \nrequired help.\nIron Raptor deactivated her com-link and turned her blue optics towards \nProwl, every bit of concern and worry reflecting within them. They were her \nMaximals�and something was wrong, she could feel it! And they were close \nenough to the Allaince that something else could go wrong, and she was \nalmost expecting both of their signatures to fade from the scanners any \nmoment. Lost, for reasons not yet known.\nIron Raptor then took her optics from Prowl, still knowing that there was \nalso another thing that needed taking care of before she left for the \nEmbassy.\nShe let out a concerned/frustrated sigh as her optics fell upon a framed \nschematic of the Cybertronian Fire on the far wall, slowly walking over to \nit and looking over it just as slowly. However, not really seeing it.\nBut this schematic also reminded her of that last task, one that was very \nimportant. The reconstruction of the Ark itself.\nIron Raptor places a hand on the wall before she turned slightly towards \nboth Prowl and Kluster. *\n\n� If either of you wouldn�t mind telling me: What�s the structural stasis of \nthe Ark at the moment?�\n\n\n\nZyber:\n\n* Zyber lowered her head so that she was looking right in the face of \nDeathScythes beast mode, looking for any signs of life at all.\nHer eyes turned up to look at his massive chest, not moving a muscle and \nwatching for just what she needed to know. His chest rose and fell, just \nwhat she wanted to see. He was breathing, and that was as good a sign as \nany.\nHer eyes then turned back towards his face as her snout inched towards it, \nevery muscle in her body ready to bolt if there were any sudden movements \nfrom this giant.\nBut there were none.\nIt was fairly obvious now that this bot was in stasis lock, something that \nwas good as well as bad. It made him remain in beast mode which could help \nheal his wounds�as well as kill him if the repair was too slow. And it \nseemed here that it was all too slow.\nBut just to make sure that he wasn�t about to wake up Zyber heaved her own \nshoulder against his to see if there were any reactions.\nThere were none.\nShe lifted her head from the still form of DeathScythe and looked around \nher, finally turning her head in the direction that her den lay in. Oh, how \nshe thought of it�s warm and inviting walls, of the fresh snow that would \nhave fallen by now and painted her home world crystal white.\nBut when she looked back towards the fallen DeathScythe she knew that she \nhad a task ahead of her, thinking of just how it would take her much more \nthen a simple mega-cycle to get home now that she needed to get him there.\nHe was bigger then her and she knew he was heavier as well, but she had to \nget him to the safely of her den none the less.\nZyber took another step towards the fallen bot, then moving so that one of \nhis front limbs was draped over her back. But, now came the hard part: With \nas much of her might as she had ever used, she wriggled under him so that \nnow his torso lay slanted across her back and his head was draped over her \nshoulder. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
