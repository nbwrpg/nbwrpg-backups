Plus there&#39;s less than a minute before the ship\n&gt; hits ground, and when she does she&#39;ll make a huge boom. Go tell\n&gt; everyone to get out of the way, I don&#39;t know how big this blast is\n&gt; gonna be. I&#39;m going in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream entered the inferno. He stumbled blinding, trying to\n&gt; remember the way to the bridge. He found it, and could barely make\n&gt; out the form of Phobia. He grabbed him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Come on! We&#39;ve got to get out of here!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He starter walking towards the exit, with Phobia in his arms, and\n&gt; only seconds until the ship crashes.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix buried Gekkidama in some wreckage, said a prayer to the Matirx,\n&gt; and than came back to answer Ramulus&#39; question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Internal Repairs? That can&#39;t fix a blown off arm. He needs mage\n&gt; repairs. They might be able to slow down the mech fluid leak, but\n&gt; eventually he&#39;ll join The Matrix if we don&#39;t do something fast. And I\n&gt; refuse to use the hull we got unless it&#39;s the last result. The plate\n&gt; did most of it, but youi&#39;re right, we&#39;ll still burn up. But if we\n&gt; saty here, we&#39;ll probably end up like Gekkidama and kill each other.\n&gt; Have any ideas?&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt;\n&gt; Gotron was confused about what the alliance was doing, so he broke\n&gt; off from the pack and followed Zardus. When Zardus landed, a bot\n&gt; almost shot him. Things seem to be cool now, but Gotron got all his\n&gt; weapons up and pointed them down at the bot. If this bot decided to\n&gt; attack Zardus, he was gonna get a two on one*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Unles Desmonus is there too, than it&#39;s 3 on 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
