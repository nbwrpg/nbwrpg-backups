She giggles and takes the disk out, tossing it on the ground, before reverting back to her beast mode.\n\nSuddenly a thought crossed her mind... why did everybody want to protect her? It wasn&#39;t as if she was some little kid or something! She thought about pouting.. but that would make her look more childish. Oh great, maybe she did act more immature against other bots.\n\nTeltoli sighs and looks up at Carnage, who had that &#39;I&#39;m not taking any of this&#39; look on her face. She cracked half a smile.\n\n&quot;You can wipe that look off your face now Carnage..&quot; She laughs.\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
