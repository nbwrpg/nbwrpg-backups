Also, if the whole base is moved at once, \nthe power drain on the systems would not allow the weapons or shields \non the ship to work. Therefore the base is defenceless as it moves. \nSo if it was attacked, it would take on damage. But it wasn&#39;t \nattacked, so then no damage to ship was made. If the ship defended \nit&#39;self, then that breaks the rule and should be voided.  Let me know \nabout this.\n\nLogo.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Mobile base rule would be taken affect here.
