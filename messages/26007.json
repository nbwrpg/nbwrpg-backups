It was \nsomething to focus on, at least.\n\nBut she wanted to know how the real warriors live, and maybe even one \nday.. become one of them. The Fuzor doubted she ever would. When she \nwas little she fainted at the sight of mech-fluid. Okay, she could \nstand it now, but it didn&#39;t mean that she was much better.\n\n&quot;Yes I&#39;m sure! All my life I&#39;ve been called a child, and thought of \none, and even my friends assumed that I needed protecting even when I \ncould&#39;ve fended for myself! For once in my life, I want to be viewed \nas something other than a little kid who can&#39;t stand up to school \nbullies!&quot;\n\nWith a start she realized she was suddenly on the other side of \nCarnage, and remembered that she had been pacing while ranting half \nto herself, but loud enough for her friend to hear.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t care what the cost is. I don&#39;t care if it half-kills me for \ncrying out loud! I want the knowledge that I can stand up for myself \nwithout half my friends getting hurt trying to protect me!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
