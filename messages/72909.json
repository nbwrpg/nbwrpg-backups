If\n&gt; =\r\nthee were any animals left in the vicintity they wre taking off at a\n&gt; high=\r\n rate of speed!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Me Grimlock listen to nobody but Grimlock!&quot; He growle=\r\nd and roared,\n&gt; his voice deep and powerful. He approached WHEELIE one lumb=\r\nerous step\n&gt; at a time, almost as if he were fighting himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; GRIMLOC=\r\nK glanced back as he could hear SLAG, SNARL and SLUDGE about to\n&gt; burst thr=\r\nough the underbrush as well into the clearing. The grasses\n&gt; and trees part=\r\ning to allow their bulk to arrive into the clearing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Who is this?&quot; SL=\r\nUDGE said. &quot;And why Grimlock no smashing him?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SNARL looked at GRIMLOC=\r\nK and then SLUDGE, &quot;Me don&#39;t know. Maybe\n&gt; Grimlock waiting for us?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe massive SLAG just stood there looking at WHEELIE, his optics\n&gt; angry. &quot;M=\r\ne Slag say we smash and ask questions later.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, up and behind=\r\n GRIMLOCK and the others, from a position\n&gt; where they could not quite be s=\r\neen by the rampaging DINOBOTS there was\n&gt; SWOOP and TERRANOTRON, in the air=\r\n hovering as they watched.\n&gt; \n&gt; While it was difficult to see from this dis=\r\ntance SWOOP almost looked sad.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE thought he had an opening=\r\n here, and then over as the other DINOBOTS debated smashing, WHEELIE quickl=\r\ny shot up, &quot;Me Wheelie Think Grimlock not smash who others want.  Me Wheeli=\r\ne think Grimlock smash those who think he begot.  Of what me Wheelie know, =\r\nGrimlock never let others say where he go.  Me Wheelie thing it is to say, =\r\nthat GRIMLOCK not follow orders any time of day.&quot;\n\nDodging over to the side=\r\n then if SLAG were to charge towards him, trying to keep up teh banter, &quot;Me=\r\n Wheelie know GRIMLOCK no follow orders from PRIME, me WHEELIE think you fo=\r\nllowing on someone else&#39;s TIME.  Why ar eyou doing what they say, without m=\r\naking them have to pay?  Me WHEELIE thought GRIMLOCK only do what GRIMLOCK =\r\nwant, he and the DINOBOTS are no one&#39;s pack to flaunt.&quot;\n\nTrying to keep up =\r\nhis barrage, hoping the stubbornness of GRIMLOCK in time would bear through=\r\n!\n\n\n"}}
