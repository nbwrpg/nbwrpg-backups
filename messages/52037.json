Anyways, let&#39;s keep it in game. \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil felt a smile tug at his lips as he saw that his particle \n&gt; hits had not missed target. Hitting Devilcat was missing his \ntarget, \n&gt; as he saw the forest around slowly start to burn.\n&gt; \n&gt; With Jayde out of the way, he knew that he was in deep trouble. He \n&gt; raised his shield against Fury&#39;s knife; it was torn out of his \ngrip. \n&gt; He was not in the best situation. He kept track of Fury with both \n&gt; machine guns but did not fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: I demand a cease-fire! Let me talk! I&#39;m not here for \nyou, \n&gt; so let me explain!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I see.  And I got an exemption on the faction bit already - \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; turned out to be necessary as there&#39;s only one non-cardhead Rogue \n&gt; &gt; kicking around.  (And her controller is asleep at the switch \nagain.) \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Torin hit the dirt and Fury attacked with TWO weapons \ncapable \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; reaching the target - you obviously misread my last post.  \n(Fury&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; lashknife works both at a distance and in a melee - it&#39;s a blade \n&gt; &gt; attached to a handle by an extending cable.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jayde takes several hits as she scrambles behind cover.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fury, whirling his lashknife in confusing patterns, closes to \neasy \n&gt; &gt; striking range - still outside Yggdrasil&#39;s reach - and slashes \nout \n&gt; &gt; with the whiplike device.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gatara and Devilcat also close in, the former trading her machine \n&gt; gun \n&gt; &gt; for a long chain and the latter brandishing his laser sword - \ntaking \n&gt; &gt; the particle fire on his energy shield.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Torin and Riekan regroup to one side, waiting for a sniping \n&gt; &gt; opportunity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Fine, I just wanted to give him a break before I started \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accept lots of damages. And may I remind you that normal \nfaction \n&gt; &gt; rules \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say that one player isn&#39;t supposed to possess more than 50% of \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; faction? Besides, Torin was aimed too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC: Yggdrasil knew this was getting very nasty. He managed to \n&gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; twice more with his particle canon before two bommerang blades \ndug \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deep in his right arm. It started feeling numb and he dropped \nhis \n&gt; &gt; gun. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Torin&#39;s counterattack hit him hard in the abdomen. He tries to \n&gt; &gt; reach \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for his barkskin shield to get some cover, but the blast from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat&#39;s and Gatara&#39;s weapon throw him back, missing him by \nonly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few feet in front of him. He stands and is hit by Jayde&#39;s \nshot. \n&gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rises his shield and blocks Fury&#39;s venom shots and turns at \nJayde \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fires wildly his two machine guns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Freaking preds of my slag!\n\n\n"}}
