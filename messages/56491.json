So no complaints came \nfrom any of THEM.\nFinally, after thay�d done what they could, the 4 of them regrouped on a \nsmall rise away from the wreckage where they�d put the things they�d found. \nAnd then watched on as their mighty ship was reduced to nothing more then \nmetallic ashes. Along with everything else inside.\n\nBlue Flame heaved a heavy sigh as Sand Storm plopped down on the grass \nbeside him.\n� No ship, no way back home, and only 3 energon cubes between the 4 of us. \nWhat now?�\nAll optics were turned to Diesel Runner, who still stood tall and unwavering \ndespite the same heavy, sinking feeling she secretly shared with the others. \nBut ignored.\nInstead of simply giving up much like Sand Storm who pouted in the grass \nfrom loosing his CD collection in the crash, D.R. took action and gathered \nup the few energon cubes they had. Then, very un-Decepticon-like, handed \nthem over to her crew and disregarded their surprised expressions.\n\n� You re-energize yourselves. Because our work isn�t done just because our \nship is gone.�\nBlue Flame blinked, a bit confused as he held the glowing cube his leader�d \njust given him. �But�what about you, Diesel? You need energy too.�\nThe big black semi-transformer only shook her head. � Not as much as you \nthree. And I need your energy levels at maximum for the work that we still \nhave ahead.� She explained.\nAlthough Sand Storm gave her a funny look. � What work? The ship�s gone. \nNothin but a pile of sparkly ashes.� He said over the top of his cube.\nBut D.R. was already 2 steps ahead of him and pointed to the ashes the dune \nbunny�s referred to.\n� The radioactive material from the core of our ship�s engine is still \npotent, even as ashes. And it�ll harm the environment of this lush planet \nunless we dispose of it properly.� She explained before turning back to her \ncrew. � The last thing I want is this planet to be contaminated before we \nget the chance to study it. So drink up, because you�re going to help be \ndilute that core material.�\n\nSand Storm raised his cube up. � That�s a good enough reason for me.� he \nsaid before tossing back his energon beverage. Followed quickly by Dark \nCloud. And then by Blue Flame, who paused for only a moment before drinking \nup his portion too.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTired of spam?
