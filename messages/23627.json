The\nDragon was tracking one of his doners and wasn&#39;t about to be seen by anyone\njust yet. He landed on a cliff and crouched near some loose rocks. He peaked\ndown at the two he could see climbing toward him. He sniffed the air, there\nwas another bot nearby, probably with the other two. He didn&#39;t like what he\ncouldn&#39;t see. The giant Dragon watched stealthfully as his prey climbed\ntoward certain doom. He listened to the conversation. If this is what passed\nfor Predacons they deserved extinction.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, December 11, 2000 7:23 PM\nSubject: Re: Missions\n\n\n&gt; Killfest&#39;s group is en route to Megatron&#39;s base, Robo.

That was no\n&gt; tough job, but it did waste some time.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do you think anyone will escape?&quot; EndBringer asks the other two\n&gt; members of the group as he begins the climb, his voice tinged with\n&gt; insanity. Demise was climbing to his right, and Scyther, even though\n&gt; he was cloaked and couldn&#39;t be seen, was on his left.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I certainly hope so,&quot; the beast-bot, Demise, replies in his raspy\n&gt; voice, digging a giant claw into the mountainside and pushing himself\n&gt; up, &quot;There isn&#39;t enough battle on this planet, and they tell us its a\n&gt; war.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; EndBringer grunts in reply as his foot sends some rocks rolling down\n&gt; the side of the mountain. &quot;I agree with you there. I havn&#39;t friend\n&gt; anyone in ages. What do you think, Scyther?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Silence answered EndBringer&#39;s question. He grunts. He didn&#39;t like how\n&gt; Scyther was so anti-social. EndBringer might be an insane killer, but\n&gt; he had no problems with conversation.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n"}}
