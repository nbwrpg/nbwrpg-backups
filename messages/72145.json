He was not about to\n&gt; give his position away just yet.  But he wished he could get to the bottom\n&gt; of what was going on.  It disturbed him to think he could have lost Rodimus\n&gt; for the second time in a row.  But for now he had to hold his position.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nGetting to the bottom of things, yes that would be what TUSCON or any\nleader would be looking to do. Maximals are missing in fact one of the\nleaders is missing, missing with a componant of the Matrix still\nbeating in his chest. Where was he? Was he truely turned back into a\ndark version of himself or was this some clone?\n\nAlso Cheetor was still missing as well as well as Optimus Primal?\nWhere they also being held somewhere in this jungle or where they\nelsewhere still waiting for TUSCON to find them? Had anyone even seen\nRHINOX in some time? Where had they all gone?\n\nAlso, why were the Dinobots attacking Maximals? These were once heros,\nones that centuries ago TUSCON may have called friends! Yes the\nDinobots had not been soon after the Decepticons had surrendered to\nthe Autobots more than three centuries ago, but what could have\nhappened to them since? Where they under the control of another or\njust out of control?\n\nSo many questions and so few answers. This was something would take\ntime to unravel, if only TUSCON could conquer his own anger and\nimpatience.\n\nIn the distance TUSCON could hear GRIMLOCK and his men in conflict\nwith something, but mostly what he could hear was their roars of anger\nand frustration. There might have been the sound of an engine revving\nor was it some sort of explosion? At this range it was difficult to\ntell.\n\nThen TUSCON could hear footsteps of something approaching, perhaps two\nor three individuals moving through the brush. Where they friend or\nenemy? With no IFF signatures there was no way to know. But they were\nmoving in TUSCON&#39;s direction.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
