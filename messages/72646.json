You don&#39;t have to answer them all if you don&#39;t\nwant to, some of us are private people, but they can give us a little\nbackground into who we are as players and what we like.\n\nHow old are you (You don&#39;t have to answer this one if you don&#39;t want to. Heh!)\n\nWhich types of transformer are you most familiar? (80&#39;s Cartoon, 80&#39;s\nComic book, TF: Antimated, TF: Prime, TF: Energon, Dreamwave Comics,\nect.)\n\nWhat are your favorite characters from the cartoons?\n\nHow long have you been roleplaying, and where?\n\nWhat do you like about Role playing, what are you looking for?\n\nAgain, you don&#39;t have to answer all the questions, but it gives\nsomething to think about, and helps us to get to know you. I will be\nposting my own answers as well in the next day or so :)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
