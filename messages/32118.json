She checked his mind a little when he comfirmed that he was \nalright, finding that he was gaining his energy back and getting stronger.\nShe, too, was beginning to get her strength back but much slower then \nProwl.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m shaken up.&quot;\n\n* She said to him once she was close enough that she didn&#39;t have to shout. \nHer systems were, just now, beginning to stabelize itself.\nSeeing Prowl offer her an arm she took it, but hugged him instead of using \nhim for support. But then she quickly leaned back.*\n\n&quot; Have you any idea of what you were doing?&quot;\n\n* It was a normal question, with no anger in it at all.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
