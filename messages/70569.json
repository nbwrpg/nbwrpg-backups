Your father is under the care of the best doctors we\nhave, and we have Tuscon sharing his power with him to give him the\nstrength to hold on.&quot;\n\nSilverbolt glances over at Tuscon and Rodimus, &quot;See look.&quot; he pointed\nat Tuscon&#39;s glowing chest and the energy that seemed to be radiating\nfrom it.\n\n&gt;&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Before anyone could think, in his state of unconsciousness, Tucson extends\n&gt; &gt; his hand out as far as he can, hoping that it will touch upon Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; hand, even if it were only his fingers. He begins to talk in his sleep.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe distance that seperates Tuscon from Rodimus is fairly short, only\na few feet. He is just outside of arm&#39;s reach. Legacy glanced over at\nTuscon as his brain wave patturn indicated that he was rising up into\na more wakeful state of sleep for some reason. He moved quickly as he\nsaw Tuscon&#39;s hand reaching for Rodimus snf stepped around the beds . .\n.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just - a hand - a - way. Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He fights hard to extend his arm far enough to attempt to feel Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt; hand.\n\nLegacy was about to touch Tuscon&#39;s hand, pehpas help him make the\ncontact when several of the tendrils that lay on Rodimus, some of the\nlast few reached out and grabbed hold of Tuscon&#39;s arm! A shock of\nenergy went through it as it glowed blue for a moment, then red and\nthen began to settle down into a color that was unsettling close to\nTuscon&#39;s color.\n\n&quot;Quickly!&quot; Legacy said to bump and Santon, his voice louder than\nnormal, &quot;This tendril must be severed from Tuscon&#39;s arm.&quot;\n\nWith a nod from Santon, Bump came over with a laser cutter and began\nworking on it as Santon continued to work on Rodimus. This proceedure\nwas proving to be far more difficult then he had at first anticipated.\nMeanwhile Tuscon&#39;s form goes limp as he fell back into the deep states\nof sleep.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
