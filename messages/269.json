( No offence, of coarse.)\n&gt;No matter, he wouldn&#39;t be in the Beast Wars at all if he had ever let a\n&gt;little weight bring him down.Besides, his own damage was making his\n&gt;abilities weaken.\n&gt;Dinobot then began to walk off in the direction of the cliff-side cave, he\n&gt;scanned it as he walked and saw that it was more then big enough to house\n&gt;two transformers.\n&gt;Dinobot suddenly heard his stomach gurgle and knew that he was hungry, he\n&gt;decided that as soon as he got Tavatron steeled he would go out and catch\n&gt;breakfast.*\n&gt;\n&gt;( Carnage_Blood: Please don&#39;t mind me moving Tavatron like this, she&#39;s \n&gt;tired\n&gt;and Dinobot decided to do the work of walking for her.)\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
