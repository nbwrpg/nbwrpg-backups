Her head lifted slightly from \nthe impact. She roared and bit down on his shoulder. Sinking her \nlarge teeth into his flesh. Her hind legs bracing her, trying to hold \nhim against the wall. She didn&#39;t want to kill this bot, but she was \nmore of a recon bot. She was now physicaly able to fight, but \nmentally, she wasn&#39;t as prepared. She was going on instinct. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The sword pulled Razor Claw off balance but he did not let \ngo. &quot;What \n&gt; demonic force is this?&quot; He was paying attention to the sword when \nIce \n&gt; forced him into the wall. He dropped his sword upon impact. Pinned \n&gt; against the wall he threw his knee up trying to catch her in the \njaw.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stepped forward grabbing the sword and tossed it aside so \n&gt; Razor Claw wouldn&#39;t be able to recover it. &quot;Hit him again Ice.&quot; He \n&gt; was really getting into watching the fight but he still wished he \nwas \n&gt; in there instead of her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis played the part of a typical scientist taking notes as the \n&gt; fight went on. He wanted to see what she was capable of in a fight, \n&gt; he was deffinitely getting his moneys worth and then some.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
