That ship seemed to just appear \nout of no where. &quot;What in the matrix?&quot; she said in a hushed voice as \nher optics stared wide at the sight. She saw him motion to her.  She \nclosed her mouth, which had been hangihng open from astonishment. She \nstraightened up and walked confidently past Galvatron and into the \nship. As she passed him,&quot;Nice trick. I like how you shield the ship \nlike that.&quot; in a calm manor. She looked around,&quot;Nice, nice. Not \nthrilling, but nice.&quot; she said with a slight smile. &quot;So where the \nmess hall there pal. You did mention a small snack earlier didn&#39;t \nyou? So then, lead the way.&quot; she said, trying to act all unimpressed \nand all. But she really was impressed with the techonological \nadvances that had been made. She was dying to see how this ship \nworked. She was a computer wiz and rather a genious about such \nthings. After all, she had built Megatron an entire fortress once. \nComplete with a heavy defence system and everything. She looked at \nGalvatron. &quot;Well?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron laughed. She was a fighsty one. &quot;Whatever you say young \none. They \n&gt; landed but nothing was there. He pressed the button on his arm and \nthe sip \n&gt; materialized infron of them. The door opened. he walked in \nmotioning her to \n&gt; follow him.\n\n\n"}}
