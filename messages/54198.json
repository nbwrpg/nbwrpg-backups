She \n&gt; didn&#39;t feel quite right now doing this for some strange reason.  \nShe \n&gt; just didn&#39;t feel herself.  She didn&#39;t want to be under anybot. But \n&gt; for some reason she felt very obligated to serve this bot whom she \n&gt; had not even seen, Hydrus.  She looked to Perceptor, &quot;So, by the \n&gt; sounds of him, he&#39;s quite a warrior. I hope to prove myself worthy \n&gt; in battle.&quot;  She let her wolf tail swiswh behind her as she walked \n&gt; in bot mode down the hall.  She passed a door where the metal was \n&gt; quite shiney.  She glimsed her reflection and smiled. She still \n&gt; looked good after all these eons.  Her shiney black skin, her red \n&gt; optics still looked great.  She smiled to herself.  It takes a \ngood \n&gt; looking bot to make a good first impression. She wasn&#39;t out to \n&gt; seduce him, she wanted him to think highly enough of her to make \nher \n&gt; a commander under him. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
