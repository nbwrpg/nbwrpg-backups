Switchblade just finished\n&gt; making the auto \n&gt; guns and other base defenses. Otherwise it&#39;s a\n&gt; sitting duck. The \n&gt; armour however is heavy, and can take quite a bit of\n&gt; punishment \n&gt; before hurtin too much. =p (read the ooC at the end\n&gt; as well)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Megatron --\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron grumbles as the Predacon base is splayed\n&gt; with weaponfire \n&gt; from two sides. &quot;Note to self, repair sensors, and\n&gt; set up base \n&gt; defenses.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He starts into a brisk walk as he heads to the base\n&gt; exit. He opens a \n&gt; commlink to Switchblade, &quot;Switchblade, look around\n&gt; in the storage \n&gt; bay, there might be something we can use down there.\n&gt; We&#39;re in a bit \n&gt; of a pinch right now.&quot; He reaches the exit, and\n&gt; stops short.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron frowns as he opens a basewide commlink,\n&gt; &quot;Preceptor, \n&gt; Waspinator, Inferno if you&#39;re active, Quickstrike,\n&gt; Warhead, and all \n&gt; other Preds prepare for battle, this could get\n&gt; messy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The outer sensors pick up Tyreal&#39;s ultimatum. &quot;Hah!&quot;\n&gt; Megatron laughs \n&gt; sarcasticly, &quot;Turn myself in... of course I&#39;m not\n&gt; going to agree to \n&gt; that slag...&quot; He switches to external speakers, &quot;I\n&gt; don&#39;t care who \n&gt; you are. Who would agree to such terms... Bewarned,\n&gt; if you stay here \n&gt; and bother me, your lives are forfeit. You get one\n&gt; warning before \n&gt; death, so I hope you choose wisely.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He closes the external comm, and opens another comm\n&gt; to \n&gt; Switchblade. &quot;Switchblade, found anything yet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade grumbles when he gets Megatron&#39;s first\n&gt; comm, &quot;Ya ya, i&#39;m \n&gt; looking.&quot; He fiddles around with the nearest sealed\n&gt; container, \n&gt; hacking the passlock, and disableing the\n&gt; protections. Inside he \n&gt; finds a bunch of energon pulse weapons, a newer\n&gt; Tripred design, \n&gt; although he&#39;s unsure how effective they are. \n&gt; \n&gt; He moves onto the next sealed crate, and is about to\n&gt; open it when he \n&gt; gets Megatron&#39;s second message. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m\n&gt; looking, so lemme \n&gt; alone for a bit. You&#39;ll know if i find anything.&quot; He\n&gt; starts working \n&gt; on another sealed crate, wondering why his hacking\n&gt; process is taking \n&gt; a little longer than before...\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: One more thing, the Preds are few right now, so\n&gt; without \n&gt; intervention, they may get a sever ass kicking. =p\n&gt; I&#39;d like to \n&gt; propose starting a base storyline which starts with\n&gt; the artifacts \n&gt; which are located in the Predacon storage bay right\n&gt; now. The ones \n&gt; which none of the bots know about, or what they are.\n&gt; Something that \n&gt; would involve triggering an effect of the artifact,\n&gt; which would \n&gt; cause the Predacons to win the battle, but maybe the\n&gt; artifact could \n&gt; switch hands, and then a sort of power struggle\n&gt; would ensue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
