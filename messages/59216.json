The \nship&#39;s onboard computer reported to its pilot the area was full of \nsubspace instabilities.\n&lt;Hmmm, so their trans-warp dives must has interacted with the \ninstabilities.&gt; the pilot theorized.\n&quot;Computer, use avalible jump data to jump the same way the Axalon and \nNemesis did.&quot;\nThe computer complied, and was ready to jump through time.\n&quot;Engage transwarp drive.&quot;\nThe ship jumped into warp space, and shortly was found in the Sol \nsystem, near Prehistoric Earth.  The craft somehow sustained major \ndamage, and was sent careening down, to crash on the North american \ncontinent.  \n\n\n"}}
