Leo Prime is preping his\ntroops to move out, but it is up to you if Hydras commands his men to\ndo the same. Also will Rat Trap, Straightshot and Quickstride be\nfollowing Leo&#39;s orders or do they have some mischief to get in?\n\nIn the other thread Nightlight now has company in the room seeking to\ntake her in. Will she comply or fight?\n\nAm I making these threads too difficult? I am more used to table top\nGMing, so am stuill adjusting somewhat to the changes. Feel free to\ntalk to me either who or by private email.\n\nIf there is anything you guys want to see, if you have any comments or\nanything, please let me know as well. I am trying not to reveal plots\nand such, but if there is something else you want to happen, I will\ntry to accomodate if possible.\n\nI hope to have posts by Wednesday.\n\nThanks\n- Preston\n\n"}}
