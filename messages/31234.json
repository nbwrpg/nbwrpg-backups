He had discovered that he could transform to a being\nof this planet...but because of the emergency state of his stasis pod\nhe had be given a form of a plant.  There were many advanteges tho to\nthis new being....He transformed into a plant and decided to test his\nabilities...First he tried his defense...With a single thought he grew\nto an enormous tree..Planted hard in the ground unable to move &quot;Great&quot;\nhe thought. I am a frikkin tree.  He shrunk back down to a small\nplant...He could control his roots through the ground and he sped them\nthrough the ground 200 m in all directions and then they\nstopped....not a bad limit....he then popped into the ground leaving a\nsmall hole and instantaneously grew 200 m away from the ends of one of\nhis roots....He then agian shot his roots back to where he had come\nfrom and went back....He transformed to a bot. &quot;I should set some\ndefence up and find out about this planet. He walked around in a\nperimeter around his dead pod sticking his finger in the ground three\ntimes every ten meters. Where his finger had gone in grew 1: a weed 2:\na rose adn 3 : a dandilion.....that should be good enough he thought.\nHe went back to the pod and startd ripping it apart.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; The new bot came too as he realised that he had landed on a new\n&gt; planet. As soon as his optics logged on he saw the statis pod drop.\n&gt; The emergency beacon slowly dimmed lighter and lighter. &quot;Shit...&quot; he\n&gt; said looking at his pod....&quot;All my equipment is ruined.&quot; He got up and\n&gt; looked at himself. He was about 5 feet tall and not very large at all.\n&gt; But he could feel he had incridble speed. He reached to his side and\n&gt; grabbed two tubes from his hips. He held them both in his hands and\n&gt; once a firm grip was on thim Energy Whips formed from the end...&quot;Well\n&gt; I like this....&quot; He then closed his optics off and entered his\n&gt; brain...he searched for all his new abilites.....\n\n\n"}}
