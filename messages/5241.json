Airbomber seen them and waved to them. The Pe=\r\nople&#39;s Base&#39;s secret passageway was in the nearby swamp.\n\n                 =\r\n         &quot;Get ready!&quot; Train Wreck said to Airbomber.\n\n                     =\r\n     &quot;What about this guy?&quot; Airbomber asked.\n\n                          &quot;Ne=\r\nver mind him.&quot; Train Wreck said. Airbomber drug Drazom out of the water and=\r\n ushered him to come along while he walked with his comrades.\n\n            =\r\n              Dracona was getting furious, and so was Gangon.\n\n            =\r\n              &quot;Sorry Gangon, I did all I could, maybe BrightBlade will stil=\r\nl show up anyway.&quot; Dracona said. Gangon waited while Dracona flew away.\n\n  =\r\n                        &quot;Hey! Wait! You forgot to untie meeeee!&quot; Gangon scr=\r\neamed.\n\n                          Dracona didn&#39;t hear and landed next to th=\r\ne People&#39;s Group members. The Radicons, Plintissa, Dracona, and Artist all =\r\nentered the Poeple&#39;s base through the secret passage way, the computer reco=\r\nnizing them as friends. Train Wreck and Airbomber stepped into a door.\n\n   =\r\n                       &quot;Hey, Stranato, look at this! It&#39;s amazing!&quot; Train W=\r\nreck called out. Arrow steps out of the CR Chamber all healed up.\n\n        =\r\n                  &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s got lots of beer and cigars in here, too! and=\r\n it&#39;s big enough to put a table in to play cards! How come we never noticed=\r\n this room before?&quot; Airbomber said. Stranato walked into the room. Strongho=\r\nld and Blender followed.\n\n                          &quot;Wait up guys!&quot; Arrow c=\r\nalled out, running into the room. Plintissa sealed the door magnetically up=\r\non order from Train Wreck, the Radicons were locked inside the room to sort=\r\n out their problems. There was alot of banging, but it eventually stopped. =\r\nAlot of name calling, too. Plintissa laughed and sat down at a table to pla=\r\ny cards with Dracona.\n\n                          &quot;Oh, man! Not even a drop =\r\nof beer in here! We&#39;ll dehydrate drinking water!&quot; Stronghold said.\n\n       =\r\n                   &quot;What are we going to do? Nothing to smoke!&quot; Blender sai=\r\nd.\n\n                          &quot;I have more needs than all of you idiots put=\r\n together! I&#39;m getting fat and need to exercise!&quot; Stranato yelled.\n\n       =\r\n                   &quot;How come we can&#39;t all get along! I don&#39;t like it in her=\r\ne neither!&quot; Arrow said. Stranato looked at him like he was going to kill hi=\r\nm. Arrow cowered in the corner.\n\n                          &quot;You see? That&#39;s=\r\n why you fail, Arrow, you don&#39;t stand up against Stranato and his stupid ru=\r\nles! This was our idea!&quot; Train Wreck yelled.\n\n                          &quot;Ye=\r\nah, and nobody is getting out of here until we are all friends again.&quot; Airb=\r\nomber said.\n\n                          Stranato sighed in disapointment. Ar=\r\nrow stood up again, and started pacing the room. Stronghold and Blender sta=\r\nrted to look in cracks in the wall for something to drink, despite plenty o=\r\nf water in this room. Train Wreck was discussing something with Arrow and A=\r\nirbomber, and Stronghold and Blender joined them before long.\n\n            =\r\n              &quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;s really lonely sitting here with nothing =\r\nto do, and--&quot;\n\n                          &quot;Shut up and get your ass over her=\r\ne! Of course you can join us!&quot; Arrow said, cutting off Stranato. Stranato w=\r\nalks over and sits with them. Stronghold pulls out a pack of playing cards.=\r\n\n\n                          Plintissa and Dracona smile to each other and w=\r\nalk up and out of the secret passgeway, taking a walk across a field...\n\n--=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0221_01BFE255.818C0D00\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Infectra: Sounds int=\r\neresting.
