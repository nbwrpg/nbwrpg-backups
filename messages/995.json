It almost felt like she was searching again...but for what?! She had \nlooked at him so many times like that and he had looked away, perhaps \nfearful that she WOULD find something there other then a warrior.\nDinobot snarled as he heard her thank him for saving her spark, he thought \nit nothing other then making sure that the Maximal force stayed at it&#39;s \ncurrent number and would have done that to save any bot&#39;s life...or would he \nhave done the same?\nHe pondered that question for a nano before coming to the conclusion that he \nwouldn&#39;t, he would have tried to come up with something other then his own \nrepair system...or even nothing at all.\nIt almost bothered him to realize that he had acted upon instinct instead of \npure calculated thoughts, since when had he just jumped into something \nwithout looking first?\nDinobot growled to himself, he had acted upon emotion and reflex...not logic \nand calculative planning. It bothered him...but as not as much as he had \nthought it would.\nHe then looked at the body of Mosquitor and spoke plainly and cold...*\n\n&quot; You were unwise to do such an act, I was protecting you as to avoid a \nsituation such as this.&quot;\n\n* Dinobot sighed but then looked back at Tavatron for a moment, hoping not \nto run into that searching stare again. The expression he wore was stern but \na hint of relieved concern was present in his optics, but then suddenly his \nvoice became so cold that it could have frozen a blazing inferno...*\n\n&quot; Further more, the next time that you pull a stunt like that again I will \npersonally skin you alive!&quot;\n\n* Even though his words were cold his optics still showed concern, so his \nwords were nothing but an empty threat...for now. But if Tavatron did so \nsuch a thing again he wasn&#39;t clear if he would do as he said or not, but he \nwould cross that bridge when he came to it.\nDinobot looked back at the body of the defeated Predacon and sighed, at \nleast his spark wasn&#39;t in his throat any longer.\nThe immediate danger had passed, but there was still a battle to win!\nHe then turned his gaze to his rifle as it lay upon the ground...*\n\n&quot; However, you are welcome.&quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
