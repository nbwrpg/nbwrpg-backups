She \ngrowled softly to herself, what the slag was she doing in here while a \nbattle raged out there? Tavatron transformed and with an incredile burst of \nspeed ran through the ark to the bridge, stopping just before the massive \ndoors in order to transform and unsheathe her staff.\n\nWith a growl Tavatron pushed open the door with her shoulder and stepped \nonto the battlefield. She gazed about the field, shards of metal and rock \nrained about her. Things didn&#39;t look good, but she had never been one to run \nfrom a fight. With a snarl/roar Tavatron charged into battle, but stopped \nwhen she saw Dinobot. She quickly ran towards him, doing her best to dodge \nmissles and plasma shots. Tavatron skidded to a halt beside him.\n\nDinobot didn&#39;t look so good, his armor was streaked with dirt and \nmech-fluid, and the numerous cracks and scratches didn&#39;t help ease her \nconcerns. Tavatron snarled to herself for taking so long to engage the \nenemy, it wasn&#39;t like her. However, there was no time to worry about that \nnow, she was here, and the enemy was standing before her.\n\nTavatron fired her optic lasers at the first &#39;bot she saw, Pyro, while using \nher staff&#39;s energon blades in order to block various charges.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
