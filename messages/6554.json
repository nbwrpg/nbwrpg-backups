My grandmother&#39;s taken a turn for the worst and my nerves are wracked. May you forgive me, please.)\n\n\n* Dinobot growled deeply as he heard the interference over his communicator, the sounds of gun fire echoing back as well as Prowl�s voice.  So, there was a battle at the Ark?\nAs much as he didn�t like the fact of leaving his position to return to the Ark he also knew that he had no real choice, with the battle there it took as many bots as possible to end it.\nHe gave one last look in the direction of the Alliance base before turning his back to it, as much as he was willing to save their Third In Command and Tavatron he had a hunch that Prowl had a better idea then simply charging in.\nHe wanted to HEAR just what this bird bot had to say; just what he could have in mind that could resolve in the rescue of the two fembots. He had heard that he was an excellent military strategist�he wanted to see just if this Prowl could prove that.\nHe spoke into his com-link with a reluctant growl�*\n\n� Transmission received, I shall arrive soon. Dinobot, out.�\n\n*The deactivating his communicator he stood for a moment, still trying to fight the urge to simply go after them himself. But he fought the urge and looked back towards the direction of the Ark.\nWith a snarl he then quickly transformed into beast mode, simply walking down the remainder of the cliff and then beginning towards the Ark.\nIf he were lucky then he would get the chance to help finish the present battle, if not then he would get straight down to work with Prowl. Either possibility was acceptable for him.\nBut the sooner there was a solid foundation of a strategy in which they could rescue the two females the better.\nDinobot knew that he had quite a ways to go before he reached the Ark but he would get there, not knowing just what sort of horror Tavatron might be going through at the moment�and not wanting to know.\nIt wasn�t long before his clawed limbs beat against the ground at a full run, the sooner he got through with this the better. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
