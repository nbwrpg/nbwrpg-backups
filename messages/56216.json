He swirled it around his body, snun it over his head, brought \nid down, thrust it forward, towards the side, bring it up oover his \nhead and back down. He then unsnapped them and reattached his wings \nto his shoulder blades. &quot;I kill my enemies with a swift vengence. I \nspare no one in my wake and all who betray me feel the sharpness of \nmy blade. What specific qualifications are you looking for? Killer, \nhunter, a mercenary perhaps? I have done them all. If your looking \nfor a secretary, I&#39;ll go find another group.&quot; He said, with a note of \nsarcasm in that last part. He looked at Perceptor with a serious look \non his face. &quot;I am a warrior, pure and simple.
