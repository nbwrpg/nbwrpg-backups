The movie was released in 1986 and was a \nfailure, odd considering Transformers&#39; popularity.  Two swear words, oh, boo \nhoo.  I swear way more when I&#39;m talking to my teachers.  And in the normal \nversion of the movie there&#39;s only Ultra Magnus swearing, not Spike which was \ncut from theatres.  Also after the first week scenes of the Decepticons \ntorturing Ultra Magnus on a rack to get the Matrix were cut out because \nparents bitc...errr...complained.\n\nThe Matrix wasn&#39;t destroyed, yadda yadda, even if there aren&#39;t many planets \nwith robots on &#39;em they&#39;d be happy about saving their planet and afts.  The \nleader after Rodimus Prime (gay rip off of Optimus) was... ::drum roll:: \nOptimus Prime!  After he&#39;d been revived by Quintessons, for the second time.  \nDon&#39;t believe me?  Watch the two parter episode titled &quot;Return of Optimus \nPrime&quot;.  Fortress Maximus was never leader of the Autobots.  In the last \nepisode of Transformers, &quot;Rebirth&quot; (a really crappy five part commercial), \nFortress Maximus was only then built, at least that&#39;s how it was perceived in \nthe the US G1 cartoon.\n\nLegendary, your statement is falsch.  The Plasma Energy Chamber was not \nlocated in the core of the planet, just several sectors below the surface.  \nThough any Cybertronian its plasma energy came in contact with it overloaded \n&#39;em and took them down.  But you are correct, NO ORGANIC material of the \nsort.  \n\nMoving on, how Cybertron came to be was never explained in the US G1 cartoon. \n It may have been in the US comic, but I haven&#39;t read all of them.  Though in \nthe MUSH I&#39;m in they say it was originally just a asteroid.  So just a chunk \nof rock, NO LIFE.  I don&#39;t know if it was an asteroid for sure though.)\n\nL. Unitron\n\n"}}
