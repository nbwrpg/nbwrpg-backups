He restrained Spears as \nshe &quot;tried&quot; to break free. He was upset at this.\n\n&quot;I repeat Wolf bot, who are you? Ramulus was supposed to come alone, \nas I have. Why are you betraying the trust I gave you, Ramulus. I \nhave a good mind to go back to my base and really re-program Spears!&quot;\n\nMeanwile, Ignatius and Blaze were having no luck.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t see anything. If Ramulus did bring back-up, they must be in \ncloak like us.&quot; said Ignatius in a secret frequency to all but \nPrebon, Spears and Slayer.\n\n&quot;And I can&#39;t get closer to smell without risking all of us. That \nwolf&#39;s probably got a great nose, and would know that I&#39;m there in an \ninstant.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go back. There is nothing we can do.&quot;\n\nIgnatius and Blaze go back to the group.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream/Gotron\n\nStarscream spoke to KitKat.\n\n&quot;I was thinking it was too easy as well, but look at the body. The \nInferno drones were all a different color than Inferno. But this \nthing looked exactly like Megatron. But, like you said, I&#39;ve known \nMegatron the most, and I think he wouldn&#39;t be that dumb to place \nhimself in such a predicament. Maybe he downloaded all his files into \na back-up chip, and than re-installed himself into a new and improved \nbody. He sent this fragile shell thing after us, and we killed it, to \nmake him think we were dead. But we&#39;ll see as Phobia examins the \nbody. As for a base, we could stay in your friend destructors for now \nuntil we find something suitable. I&#39;ll go check the caves.&quot;\n\nStarscream walked over to the Lavacons.\n\n&quot;You fought well today! As the officer Zardus put in charge over you \nfor the time being, I give you the gratitude of the entire group. \nNow, you have a choice. You may remain here with me, in the war, or \ngo back to the Alliance. There really is no fighting in the Alliance \nright now, only politics. Think over your decision and tell me.&quot;\n\nStarscream was about to enter the caves when Gotron showed up.\n\n&quot;Your ambassador has arrived!&quot;\n\n&quot;Great! I think you better go check in with KitKat, and she&#39;ll give \nyou all the info. I know it all, but I don&#39;t know if we want to tell \nZardus everything yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right. See you later!&quot;\n\nStarscream goes and scans the caves, while Gotron goes to talke with \nKitKat.\n\n&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Gotron, Starscream&#39;s friend. I&#39;m the ambassador for the \nAlliance. I was wondering what information I&#39;m allowed to forward to \nZardus.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
