She looked up at Neptune. &quot;Uh, thank you \nfor saving my tail back there. I...uh...well...Just thanks.&quot;\nShe was a bit upset at herself for not putting up much of a fight. \nNext time though, she&#39;s make thier mech fluid flow like water in a \nriver. She wanted to get to a nice warm chamber and recoop for a \nbit.  She looked down at her tail with the burnt tip and sighed. OH \nwell, there will be more fights in the future, she told herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
