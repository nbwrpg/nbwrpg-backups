She unsheathed her drill sword and stood beside \nDinobot, prepared to fight the first Pred that came through those doors:\n\n&quot;As long as the shields hold we should be safe, but they won&#39;t hold for \nlong.&quot;\n\nTavatron could feel the ark vibrate with every shot the Preds fired. At this \nrate their sheilds wouldn&#39;t last more than a few cycles at best. Liono had \ndone his best to protect the ark, but there is only so much one &#39;bot can do:\n\n&quot;I shall face my fate as a warrior. Whether victorious or not I shall defend \nthis ship and the Maximal history housed within as best I can.&quot;\n\nTavatron didn&#39;t let on just how frightened she was. She welcomed the coming \nbattle, but the fear still lingered. She had lost some good friends in a \npointless war steller-cycles ago, but this time they were prepared. They \nwould not surrender the ark.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
