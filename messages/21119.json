Yawn.  That felt good.  I&#39;ll be fine I have a bit of \nenergy to \n&gt; spare.  I need so much energy because of my shall we say \ninteresting \n&gt; physiology.  The changing forms takes a lot of energy because my \ntransforming \n&gt; protocols are a bit haywire.  But the extra energy comes in handy \nsometimes \n&gt; so I think I like the way I am.&quot;  He looks around and sees Gramps \nholding the \n&gt; frog.  &quot;So you&#39;re choosing your forms now good.
