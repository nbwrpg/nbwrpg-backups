He raises and flexes \nhis hand and turns his head to face Dinotron.  He finally says &quot;Enough of \nthis, I am your better.  Lead us to your base so the three of you can be \nrepaired.  I must speak with whomever is in charge there.&quot;  Out of the corner \nof his eye he notices Whistler moving.\n\n::Whistler::\n    With his head still groggy he awakens to find a truly impressive creature \nthere.  He instinctively knows that it was he that shot him.  He tries to sit \nup but he could not.  With a feeble rasp he asks &quot;Who ... are you? ...  Will \nyou ... help me?&quot;\n\n"}}
