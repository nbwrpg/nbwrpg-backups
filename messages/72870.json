When they rose up to the\n&gt; surface, the first thing the other Maximals would do would be dogpiling upon\n&gt; LEO PRIME then to assault him over the trade he had made, and it would serve\n&gt; as a heavy moment of confusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  Now come, we are to\n&gt; head up to the surface now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Grinning to hisemfl as he gestured for the MAXIMALS to go up through the\n&gt; tunnel.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson&#39;s face fills with draconic rage and with a loud roar he slams his\n&gt; left front foot down hard in front of Drill Bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; SPEAK THAT WAY AGAIN AND I WILL PERSONALLY REMOVE THE SPARK\n&gt; FROM YOUR SHELL!  NOW ENOUGH LIES!  HE ASKED FOR THE TRUTH AND\n&gt; YOU WILL COMPLY!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He saw no other way around  his situation and if it meant playing the\n&gt; fearful dragon for real, Tucson was up for the task.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;AS FOR THAT STASIS POD, YOU HAVE NO SUCH RIGHT TO SUCH AN ITEM!\n&gt; DEMAND DENIED, THAT&#39;S FINAL!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He knew he would have words with Leo Prime about the issue.  He growls a bit\n&gt; on it.\n&gt; &quot; If indeed that was said, I had no notion of it and was said against my\n&gt; jurastiction.  I&#39;ll have to have a talk with him, a SERIOUS talk with him.\n&gt; And as for the Matrix, perhaps I should find it and hold onto it until it\n&gt; chooses it&#39;s bearer.  First Rodimus, now Leo Prime.  Let&#39;s go, we have a job\n&gt; to finish.  ALL OF US!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He roars back to Drill Bit with anger in his voice.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBIG CONVOY frowned mightily as he listened to DRILLBIT as well as\nTUSCON, his optics going from one to the other. &quot;There is only one way\nto resolve this.&quot; CONVOY said as he looked coolly at DRILLBIT.\n\n&quot;If there is an answer it lies with Leo Prime and he is above us.&quot;\nTurning to go up the tunnel began to march upward, MACH KICK and BREAK\nfollowing, the trip upwards far more difficult as the ground sloped up\nsharply.\n\nAhead of them, echoing down the hall the voices, especially LEO PRIME\nand the others could be dimly heard, they were perhaps several hundred\nmeters away, although in these tunnels sound seemed to travel farther.\n\nYes it was time to meet.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
