Ignatius fired two\nmissles from his wings (One at each) and rattled off 25 shots from his\ntalons.\n\nDeepfear/Charon::\n\nThe bot appeared in surface (in land), they changed to Vehicle mode\nand started to shoot against iguanus. Deepfear shot 22 missiles,\nwhile Charon shot 25.\n\n(I think fireing 47 missles in one post is illegal so I&#39;ll trim it down a\nlittle.) Missles rained down into the water exploding all around the bot. he\ntried to get to the surface so he could get into the air when an explosion\nsent him flipping through the water. He tried to regain his composure but\ncouldn&#39;t figure out which way was up. He scanned the area and detected\nsomething moving in the water. Whatever it was it was bigger than him. It\nwas trouble. (Thyphon.)\n\nSlayers voice echoed over the comm.  &quot;Its no use,&quot; he says to Ignatis over\nthe comm, &quot;There&#39;re hordes of the maintenance bots. Lets get out of here.\nDon&#39;t return to base,\ngive them a nice chase till they lay off.&quot;\n\n&quot;So I noticed.&quot; Ignatius thought as the action continued around him. He swam\ntoward Slayers signal knowing that way was up. He kept a scan on whatever\nwas nearby knowing sooner or later it would make it&#39;s move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, February 07, 2001 9:54 AM\nSubject: Re: The Blackfortress\n\n\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright.

He sets his jets on maximum\n&gt; burn, zoomning over the Predacons&#39; heads and firing two signature\n&gt; seeking missiles when he was right above them, and then slowing down\n&gt; slightly so that they could keep up.

He stayed close to the water trying to use the water to\n&gt; confuse the\n&gt; &gt; sensors. He knew that the closer he got the more likely he&#39;d be\n&gt; detected and\n&gt; &gt; attacked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The call to retreat came through from Slayer. &quot;We can&#39;t retreat yet,\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; barely warmed up.&quot; he wanted to rescue the leader even though he\n&gt; knew that\n&gt; &gt; Prebon had made a strategic mistake (To put it lightly) attacking\n&gt; the Iron\n&gt; &gt; fist. He vowed allegiance to his leader and intended to follow it\n&gt; through to\n&gt; &gt; the end.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Long range scanners showed Slayer going the opposite direction. He\n&gt; switched\n&gt; &gt; frequencies and called Slayer again. &quot;Lead them back toward me, I&#39;ll\n&gt; lay\n&gt; &gt; down coverfire.&quot; Ignatius wasn&#39;t facing fire from the fortress so he\n&gt; knew\n&gt; &gt; that he was out of range. He transformed to robot mode and dove into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; water. he set all operating functions on minimal hoping thier\n&gt; attension\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
