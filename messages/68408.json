Lets see how things\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  turn out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Megatr=\r\non X:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  After much study and paitent waiting, three aircraft; tw=\r\no about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  size of an average maximal and the third signifigantly s=\r\nmaller-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  infiltrated the city from three different directions. The la=\r\nrgest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  rumbled down a thouroghfair, almost a block in shape. At it&#39;s =\r\nbow\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  was a large barreled fusion cannon wile the top portion\ncontaine=\r\nd two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  secondary cannons on either side of a twin missile pod. The se=\r\ncond\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  aircraft; noticably faster, was set apart by its air foils and =\r\ntwo\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  precision beam rifles. The last, was tiny by comparison, flying\n=\r\nhigh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  over the building until it dove down to join the other two.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Once the three craft converged, they combinded into an even large=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ship, the small flyer compacting and fitting inside the faster\nfly=\r\ner,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  which connected to the bow section of the larger gunship. The sh=\r\nip\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  hovered over an intersection for several minutes as a crowd gathe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  around it. And then it suddenly fell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  But before it c=\r\nrashed to the roadway, it transformed. The cannons\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  fell away and rec=\r\nonfigured as the body reformed. The large engines\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  formed strong legs=\r\n. The wings and forward fuselage formed the upper\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  body and arms, wit=\r\nh the wings forming two broad shields at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  shoulders. The fusion c=\r\nannon attached to the bottom of the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  forearm, while the twin ba=\r\nrreled rifle found home in the left hand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  With missiles to protect h=\r\nis back, Megatron X Stood before the\ncrowd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  and sneered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n &quot;People of the world, Megatron has returned!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
