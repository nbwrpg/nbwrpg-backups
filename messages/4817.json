Heading to the \nbridge, he got to the main computer console.  Pressing a few buttons, he \nactivated the long range transmission satellite dish, which raised 8 feet \ninto the air.\n\n~Lord Hell Beast, this, is Koga Shuko.  I have a business proposition for \nyou.  We are both Predacons.  With the same goals.  The same ideas.  We want \nthe Maximals and their Autobot ancestors DEAD!  We want to mine this pitiful \nrock for all its worth.  And we don&#39;t want interference with our plans.  I \npropose a peace treaty between our two factions.  Together, no one on the \nplanet can stop us!  Not even the Alliance joined with the Maximals and every \nneutral being on this planet!  We would be unstoppable!  I, with my forces \nand my wealth, you with your mass forces.  We could mine the planet 3 times \nas quick.  Fifty, fifty as it were.  Reply with your thoughts.  If you agree, \nthen we will discuss mobilization for the destruction of the Ark!~\n\nHis transmission launched in a tight laser message, heading for Hell Beast&#39;s \nships.  Koga Shuko took a seat, waiting.\n\n"}}
