But she feels different somehow. She runs a quick \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diognostic. Her optic lazars have been enhanced. She isn&#39;t sure \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this happened, but it&#39;s been increased by 20 percent.

When she wakes up I hope she kicks ur metallic ass.&quot; \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; walked over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Kit Kat. &quot;This will help keep her stable until we get her \n&gt; into a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CR \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chamber. He took a small piece of his black organism covering \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed it on Kit Kat. He gave it one instruction to keep her \n&gt; alive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; until the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CR chamber fixed her. The suit to his knowledge would only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; willingly seperate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from him when he willed it to. When the organism was placed on \n&gt; Kit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kat it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would listen to her as well. If it changed her at all it would \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diffrent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then his change since he was a pure energon body when it \n&gt; attached \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to him. (If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you want you can just have it die when she gets fixed or have \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; change her a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little bit whatever floats your boat.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She was unconsious from the dart. Mech fluid leaking from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; corner \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of her mouth and her face plates damaged. Her body limp in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor&#39;s hands. Her optics flickered as her program tried \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restart despite the dart&#39;s sedative effects. Even out cold \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; programs wouldn&#39;t give up.
