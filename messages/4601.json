Raising a missile launcher, he \nfired a rocket at Jackle&#39;s back.\n\n---\n\nUnitron transforms into his robot mode, the missiles barely missing him.  \nTransforming into a tank mode, he slams into the ground, firing a concussion \nrocket from his cannon at Gremlin, his mounted machine gun firing 20 shells \noff at Scourge, and the smaller cannons on the front of his tank mode firing \ntwo missiles at Vulois&#39; treads.\n\n---\n\nAnubis dodges one of the rockets, another blowing off his left hand.  Raising \nhis launcher, he fired off a rocket at a downed Marine, as autogun fire \nstruck him.\n\n---\n\nHades grunts as rifle fire strikes him, kicking the grenade away, its \nexplosion knocking him back a foot, firing three optic blasts at Gremlin&#39;s \nleft knee. \n\n"}}
