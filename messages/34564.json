He \nobserves the Terrorcons messing with some Maximals, he sees \nand hears Megatron going for the big fish, and smiles, deciding not \nto bother Megatron till he is in need. He debates quickly about \nfiring on the Element (S) then realizes the futility of the matter. He \ndecides on a closer, smaller, easier to destroy target, Cliffjumper. \nHe owed the bot anyways. He fires his Ionic Displacer rifle three \ntimes at the smaller bot. &quot;Haha, dance foolish Autobot!&quot;\n\n----------------------\n\nSwitchblade sees Fireblade in aparent trouble, and curses. He \nsneaks over to the battling bot, and attaches an unarmed charge to \nhis back, in an easy to reach spot. He quickly leaps back to avoid \ngettin noticed, besides by Fireblade who can see him anyway. He \ncontinues on, dropping a Spider, and using it as a third eye.\n\n"}}
