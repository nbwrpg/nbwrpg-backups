He should have taken her to the CR chamber. He stands up and sits by \nher on her bed, putting a hand on her waist.\n\nThis was obvioustly not good, he thinks to himself, Iron Raptor looked like \nshe needded repairs. Repairs! That, he could do! His transmetal 2 spark had \nsaved his life many times in the past. Maybe ... just maybe, it could be used \nto repair Iron Raptor.\n\nHe reaches for her blanket and slides it gently off her, so that his spark \nwould have access to her. He takes a deep breath. Here goes nothing. His \nchestplate opens, showing his spark cavity.\n\nProwl leans forward, suddenly realizing that his face was now very close to \nhers. The mechfluid in his veins speeds up as he kisses her, sliding a hand \naround her waist. His spart emerges from his chest, releasing repairing coils \nat Iron Raptor&#39;s chest.\n\n"}}
