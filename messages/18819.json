You dirty Maximal-loving\n&gt; freaks!&quot; ye yelled, transforming into his artillery mode.  &quot;ASSIST DARK\nONE!&quot;\n&gt; he yelled loudly, firing off a two foot long shell that would explode on\n&gt; impact (artillery as in cannon, only cannon from 21st century) at Blender.\n\nBlender moved next to Stronghold, the shell hit the ground and exploded.\nBlender took more damage than Stronghold did. Stronghold still stood,\nBlender was on the ground. Stronghold moved in front of Blender and stood\nhis ground. He fired 2 fast missiles at Dark One and yelled out a quick:\n&quot;Ha!&quot;\n\n&gt; Pyro watched Dark One fall.  &quot;Not very nice.&quot; he chuckled, firing off\nthree\n&gt; fire balls at Blender.\n\nStronghold took the abuse easily for Blender. He was much tougher than the\nrest. Deemos fires at Pyro. He then hides behind the base.\n\n&gt; Hiss fired off three blasts from his fusion cannon at Stronghold&#39;s left\nknee.\n\nStronghold&#39;s knee made on odd sound that made him look pained, but he stood\nto protect his partner.\n\n&gt; Scavenger fired off 25 explosive shells at Stronghold&#39;s abdomen.\n\nStronghold was hit from the side and moved to the side, some, but still\nstood to protect his partner. Rizopas throws 2 grenades at Scavenger that he\ngot from Doom Ice, they looked normal, but when they touched the ground or\nanywhere else, they exploded violently and threw shrapnel. The grenade went\nflying straight towards Scavenger.\n\n&gt; Dark Claw saw his leader fall.  &quot;My brother, I will avenge you.  Flesh\n&gt; Ripper, aid him, I must finish what I have started.&quot; Dark Claw&#39;s voice\nboomed\n&gt; from his attack vehicle mode.  Arming the launchers, he fired off two more\n&gt; missiles at the Mafia base.\n\nBase damage for entire post: The base was hit by the missiles, all 4, and\nstill stood because of it&#39;s armor, even if the shields were down, the die\ncast contructed base was still standing, but was still greatly damaged. The\n6 bolts hit the base and did minimal damage, especially when compared with\nthe missiles...\n\n\n"}}
