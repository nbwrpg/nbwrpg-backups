Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nHe walks out of the room and passes the order on to DarkMouse over \nhis comm.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise looks up at the mountain that he, EndBringer, and Scyther were \nstanding in front. They were gonna have to scale it. That was no \ntough job, but it did waste some time.\n\n&quot;Do you think anyone will escape?&quot; EndBringer asks the other two \nmembers of the group as he begins the climb, his voice tinged with \ninsanity. Demise was climbing to his right, and Scyther, even though \nhe was cloaked and couldn&#39;t be seen, was on his left.\n\n&quot;I certainly hope so,&quot; the beast-bot, Demise, replies in his raspy \nvoice, digging a giant claw into the mountainside and pushing himself \nup, &quot;There isn&#39;t enough battle on this planet, and they tell us its a \nwar.&quot;\n\nEndBringer grunts in reply as his foot sends some rocks rolling down \nthe side of the mountain. &quot;I agree with you there. I havn&#39;t friend \nanyone in ages. What do you think, Scyther?&quot;\n\nSilence answered EndBringer&#39;s question. He grunts. He didn&#39;t like how \nScyther was so anti-social. EndBringer might be an insane killer, but \nhe had no problems with conversation.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDarkMouse stands up, smiling at Goldeneye as Killfest&#39;s order comes \nthrough. &quot;Lets get to the bridge, we got work to do!&quot;\n\nShe runs out of the room and runs off toward the bridge with \nGoldeneye following her.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well Killfest, I guess we&#39;ll have to get things back to a normal \nrutine\n&gt; around here. Have Dark Mouse start assigning bots stations and \nshifts.&quot;\n&gt; A big smile appeared on his face.\n&gt; &quot;As for us, lets go to the bridge; and try out that command chair.\n&gt; Hehe.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Hey Zardus, I lost track of Demolition and those bots you sent \nhim\n&gt; out with. Was there any more posts to that after they left the IF? \nIf\n&gt; yes, just tell me so I can get back on track. -_~\n\n\n"}}
