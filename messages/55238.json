Kenzo loaded in the\nwounded maximal into his copter form using robotic arms that extended\nout the doors of the copter. He flew aways until he reached the\nMaximal base.  While in transit his internal repair systems were able\nto administer minor repairs like a lesser version of the CR chamber. \nHe landed in front of the base and carefully unloaded them onto the\nground. He converted to robot mode.\n\nOOC: I hope flying away from Flicker all the way to the base wasn&#39;t\nmoding but my guy was getting behind.  Also who were the two maximals\nKenzo needed to transport?\n\n\n"}}
