Five bots attacked the Iron \n&gt; Fist and didn&#39;t put on a scratch, but over 30 bots attacked the CF. \n&gt; Its reasonable that they would do better.\n&gt; \n&gt; And you&#39;ve only been in the RPG for a fraction of the time it was \n&gt; going. The Alliance had had many defeats before, but less than the \n&gt; other factions because they don&#39;t have as much direct fighting. If \n&gt; the Trainers would have attacked with over 30 bots, there would be no \n&gt; doubt that the Alliance base would be either theirs or destroyed \n&gt; right now (more likely destroyed).\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, about Unitron and Firestarter: The hull was breached after the \n&gt; lockdown by Oblitertron, and the hole happened to lead into the \n&gt; bridge. Unitron and Firestarter entered that hole before Hysteria had \n&gt; a chance to put a lockdown on the bridge and cover the hole with \n&gt; blast panels. She did that, however, and the hole is no longer an \n&gt; entrance. Unitron and Firestarter cleared the internal autoguns in \n&gt; the bridge, which wasn&#39;t a hard task due to all the damage in the \n&gt; bridge, the bridge lockdown, and the lack of power that the CF is \n&gt; experiencing. Vehement also helped them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of complaining about the Alliance winning, people should be \n&gt; improving the Maximals. I&#39;m as sick of this battle as everyone else, \n&gt; and I was leaving the Maximals alone, but (no offence), you decided \n&gt; to attack and continue the battle. So don&#39;t complain and do RP, \n&gt; because you brought this upon yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Jason  lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; [ok I have a couple things to say. you all keep saying the ship is \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; lockdown right then how the hell is Unitron and firestarter are \n&gt; &gt; inside.also if they are inside wouldn&#39;t the defense grid inside the \n&gt; &gt; CF would come online. also from the shields and autoguns outside \n&gt; &gt; would not be destroyed so easily. also no matter what the alliance \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; they always get there way. How is that? I am not the only one \n&gt; &gt; thinking this. when the Ironfist was attacked not even a scrath was \n&gt; &gt; left on it. but when the alliance attacks everything gets blown up. \n&gt; &gt; whats up with that?]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
