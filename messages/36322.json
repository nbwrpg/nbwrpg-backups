He transforms and steps\nforward. &quot;Firedrill, we&#39;re going.&quot; He yells, his voice piercing the new\nCF.\n\nFiredrill looks at Iron Raptor and Prowl, worry filling his eyes, and\nthen wonder. He begins to walk out of the base, looking over his\nshoulder to his if any Maximals noticed.\n\n"}}
