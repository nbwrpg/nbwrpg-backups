I know you guys are\ntrying to avoid modding here, but at the end of the\nday, you can&#39;t have a realistic battle where two\ndeities are actively involved without both deities\nmanipulating things to their advantage.

Considering that Primus is around- it\n&gt; could be possible for him to amplify a bot&#39;s powers,\n&gt; like where Shadimus is about to become a channel to\n&gt; Primus&#39; powers- however, I think that it needs to be\n&gt; treated like overloading anything- ie that the boost\n&gt; results in severe internal damage that takes quite\n&gt; some time for the bot in question to fully recover\n&gt; from (lets just say on that front thet Shadimus is\nnot\n&gt; gonna be a pretty site once he&#39;s performed the\nconduit\n&gt; attack on Unicron).\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Airly:\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that it&#39;s alittle powerful too, \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot;\n&gt; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Maybe, but still, manipulating solar flares\nis\n&gt; a mighty \n&gt; power, \n&gt; &gt; a bit too mighty for my tastes.
