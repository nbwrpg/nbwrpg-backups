Screaming, he felt the \nrocket pierce his armor as it exploded, slamming him into the wall of the \nrock, then falling 50 ft downwards to rock, unconscious.\n\n---\n\nBeachcomber felt the rocky area he was climbing up shake, almost losing his \ngrip but he held it.  He gasped as he saw Smokescreen fall.  &quot;I swear...&quot; he \nsaid to himself, leaping out of the air, slamming down to the ground from 20 \nft up, Smokescreen slamming on Beachcomber&#39;s back, both knocked out, but \nSmokescreen took less damage then he would&#39;ve if he just hit the rock.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch saw a piece of the cliff brake off.  &quot;I see...they are \ndesperate.  He saw Smokescreen fall as he inadvertantly go in the way of a \nrocket, and then saw Beachcomber break his fall.  &quot;Errr...thanks.&quot; he said, \ndumbfounded.  Raising an invisible pincher, he fired a energy-signature \nmissile off at Sniper.  Raising the other, he fired two missiles off at the \nArk.\n\nManterror fired three ion disks at the Ark.\n\nInjector fired two stinger missiles at the Ark.\n\n&quot;Fall back!&quot; Double Punch yelled, running backwards until he was 20 ft away, \nmoving to the right 5 feet, slowly walking backwards towards the Pred base, \npinchers raised.\n\nInjector looked to Cyber Claw.  &quot;They obviously think your with us!  If you \nstay here your dead, follow us!  We can probably get you to meet Megatron.  \nHell Beast will know where Megatron is.&quot; he said, running towards the Pred \nbase, Manterror going a little slower than him.\n\n"}}
