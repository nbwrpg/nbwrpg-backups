He wasn&#39;t any high official, he didn&#39;t even spend that much time in the \nbridge. And I don&#39;t remember Kluster, Firearm, Proto, Rex, Grimmler, or \nChordate telling him any of the codes.\n\n::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Smokescreen/Slayer::\n\nRamulus continues walking, thinking over Koj&#39;s suggestion. &quot;No,&quot; he replies \nto the cloaked bot, &quot;We have a few air troops as it is, but we need the \nground troops.&quot;\n\nHe looks up as Prebon and Spears come into view, shouts from Spears floating \nback to him. That didn&#39;t sound like Spears at all, not the Spears that yelled \nat Unitron back when the Newcomers attacked the Ark... But where was Striker?\n\nHe frowns, slowly aproaching.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm and Proto were flying high above Prebon and Spears, looking down at \nthem, their jetpacks not making a sound. Both of them could feel a battle \ncoming, they&#39;ve had enough military experience to know that they wern&#39;t \ngetting Spears back so easilly.. But they couldn&#39;t see Striker anywhere.\n\nTHe two bots frown, weapons ready.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen stops, Prebon in clear view. He had his gun out, waiting for \nsomething to happen.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer&#39;s eyes narrow as he watches Ramulus get closer and closer, his weapons \ntracking the Maximal. Soon, Ramulus would be in firing range...\n\nHis eyes narrow as he sees Lunarpine next to Ramulus. What was that bot doing \nhere? He glances at Prebon, wondering if his master had noticed.\n\n"}}
