Examining it\n&gt; slowly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his optics widened as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the system specks were rather...unique...for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predicon. Shifting and moving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from behind the console the bot moved to the CR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chamber and pushed the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; release switch.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     As the chamber door slid upwards he noted\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predicon was both awake\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and waiting, he had expected some resistance but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then again considering her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; configuration it wasn&#39;t a big surprise. &quot;My name\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talos and you are now a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guest of the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Nightshade looked at Talos and shrugged,\n&gt; moving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out of the chamber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looking up at him, &quot;Nightshade, you really\n&gt; should do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something about that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bird bot of yours. Even we know what white flag\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions mean.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Talos tilted his head, Sunhawk hadn&#39;t\n&gt; mentioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that his prisoner had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been taken while under truce conditions. Sighing\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shrugged, &quot;It changes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very little I assume you were looking for\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I want to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what.&quot; He said gruffly indicating the fem bot\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; walk before him from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the room.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Walking out Nightshade wasn&#39;t suprised to\n&gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the soft click of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; readied weapon behind her. &quot;I came seeking the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximal leader of this troop,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have business to discuss with him or her. Mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; escorting me to your leader\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than the brig?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Talos chuckled the nozzle of the pistol\n&gt; prodding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her back, &quot;Well state\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your business, you&#39;ve met him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Nightshade turned looking at Talos\n&gt; skepticly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;How do I know you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; telling the truth, the current example of\n&gt; maximals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in this troop have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less than honorable...&quot; Her voice dropped low\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tone almost insulting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Besides what I need to discuss has to be done\n&gt; away\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from prying optics and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensors.
