Being the same\n&gt; size as\n&gt; &gt; most of the gestaults had it&#39;s advantage. He stopped chaseing\n&gt; Ignatius and\n&gt; &gt; glared down at Zoe. &quot;Brave attempt for an enemy, I respect that.&quot; he\n&gt; shouts\n&gt; &gt; down. Raising a mighty claw shakeing  one pointed finger toward her\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; smiles, &quot;You can go now, I&#39;ve had my fun.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The dragon turns away flying back toward the cave where the chase\n&gt; had begun.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius landed near Zoe gasping for breath. He&#39;d pushed himself to\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; limits to avoid being lunch. &quot;Lets head to base, you can follow me.&quot;\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; eagle again took flight heading north toward  the future sight of\n&gt; Cairo\n&gt; &gt; where he&#39;d rest up until his strength returned.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
