He opened his \nmind to\n&gt; return his thoughts to her. &quot;I&#39;m alright Wing that monstrosity \ndidn&#39;t do\n&gt; anything to me that a little time in beast mode didn&#39;t handle.&quot; He \nstill had\n&gt; a crick in his back, probably from landing wrong when Megaton had \nhit him.\n&gt; &quot;How about we try to slip out of here before the Maximals start \nasking\n&gt; questions we don&#39;t want to answer?&quot; He thought feeling ill at ease \nabout the\n&gt; facts Megaton had blurted out about Veratis. Lunarpine owed him a \ndept that\n&gt; he wasn&#39;t wanting to explain to anyone, he fealt in his spark that \nit was\n&gt; his best option, it was his ONLY option.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 11:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: Ice\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; She woke up in the CR tank and the images she had been projecting\n&gt; &gt; stopped.  She opened the door and stepped out.  Something didn&#39;t \nmake\n&gt; &gt; sence to her. If she just got out of the CR unit, then why&#39;d she \nfeel\n&gt; &gt; so tired.  She looked around and transformed into griffin mode.\n&gt; &gt; Standing on all fours, she stretched her wings. Her shoulder felt\n&gt; &gt; great, her wounds were nicely healed, but she had a few new scars \nto\n&gt; &gt; proudly wear.  She opened up her mind to Lunarpine. &quot;How are you\n&gt; &gt; feeling? Have you had your turn in the CR yet?&quot; Then she \nremembered\n&gt; &gt; his remark about her wieght. She smirked and chuckled to herself.\n&gt; &gt; She thought to herself, I&#39;ll get him for that one, he&#39;ll never \nsee it\n&gt; &gt; coming.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Despite it all, she cared for Lunarpine with all her spark. If she\n&gt; &gt; let anything happen to him, she&#39;d rip her spark out and give it to\n&gt; &gt; Veratis on an energon platter.  It was her love for him that kept \nher\n&gt; &gt; alive while her spark sat in a jar in Veratis&#39; lab. And she wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; going to give him up now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
