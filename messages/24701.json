Glaring through the cloud at him. *\n&lt; If only those wings worked! I�d go up there and wring his slaging neck!&gt;\nIf there was one thing that pissed her off was enemies that ranted about how \ngreat they were or laughed like they were kings of the world!\nBut her eyes snapped towards the missile launcher in Nemesis�s hands, baring \nher teeth and clenching her fists. Watching him fire a rocket.\nBut while she kept her attention on Nemisis she managed to ignore \nScattershot completely until pain brought her mind around.\nThree of the ten armor-piercing missiles he had sent towards her left knee \nhad managed to hit home. Digging in deeply and nearly destroying the joint \ncompletely, bringing a fair amount of mech-fluid to spatter out of the \nwounds and run down her leg.\nIron Raptor leaned her weight to her right side as pain shot through the \nleft, leaving it basically limp and dead.\nIt was rather a good move, for an Alliance bot. Damaging a leg would leave \nher so that she couldn&#39;t run or walk. Making sure that she remained a still \ntarget!\nEven though she hated to admit it.\nIron Raptors head snapped towards Scattershot as she brought down a hand \nover her knee, her eyes glaring at him.\nBut then her own pained smile crossed her lips as the battle program sunk in \ndeeper.*\n\n&quot; Laugh while you can, pericite! You won&#39;t be laughing much longer!!&quot;\n\n* There was something that she knew that he didn&#39;t, and that was while she \nhad been sitting back and letting Nemesis fire at her energy had been \nbuilding up again.\nAlso, while she had thought of healing before her body had actually done it. \nClosing up the wound on her side by her thoughts.\nIron Raptor continued to glare towards Scattershot as her mind dwelled on \nher knee, feeling warm mech-fluid running between her fingers and running \ndown her leg. In her mind she bonded the broken wires and cords, mending and \npiecing together the circuits, and molding the armor on the outside into the \nsame solid mass it was before.\nThe ache was still there but the bleeding had stopped, and with a smart \nsmile she whipped her hand across her knee so that Scattershot could see \nthat she had taken care of his handy work.\nIron Raptor then straightened herself out and simply stepping aside as \nNemisis&#39; missile went by and exploded behind her. The fire from the \nexplosion framing her figure as she squared her shoulders and the helm came \nover her head and her hair disappearing under it.\n       Before she knew that Scattershot would have the chance to collect his \nwits, the shoulder cannons she had used before moved up and over her \nshoulders, her fingers taking hold of the joysticks as soon as the weapon \nwas in place.\nA white sighing laser pierced through the growing cloud of dust and aiming \ntowards Scattershot�s chest-plate.\nIron Raptor smiled to herself, snickering before pressing the triggers on \nthe sticks and sending 4 charges towards her enemy.\nShe would finish off Nemisis later!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
