He blinks. \n&gt; They had \n&gt; &gt; won! The Maximals had just fought back an almost full-scale \nassault \n&gt; from the \n&gt; &gt; Newcomers singlehandedly, something that no other faction had \ndone \n&gt; so far (to \n&gt; &gt; his knowledge).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He smiles, looking over the battlefield, but seeing no dead \n&gt; bot. &quot;Everyone, \n&gt; &gt; grab a CR chamber, and get repaired!&quot; he says into his comm-\n&gt; link, &quot;We have \n&gt; &gt; won the day!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With that, Striker heads to the Ark, keeping a lookout for any \nbots \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; might need help.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Prowl looks at the newcomers as they retreat.

His \n&gt; repairs could \n&gt; &gt; wait, he still needed to come up with a plan to get Iron Raptor \nand \n&gt; Tavatron \n&gt; &gt; out of the Alliance base, the least known base of the three main \n&gt; factions.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus smiles as Striker gives the command to get repaired. \n&gt; Repairs were \n&gt; &gt; something that the ram could use.
