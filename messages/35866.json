Come on, open them! Open them!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Burning Hammer eyes darted to the door.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burning hammer: Shouldn&#39;t you open the shields?\n&gt; \n&gt; His eyes quickly returned to Zeni. Zeni held out his hand to the \nserial\n&gt; killer turned bounty hunter. Burning Hammer took his hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burning Hammer: I killed my best friend, kid, I&#39;m not so great, not \ngreat\n&gt; like I thought I was. I killed him because there was a bounty on \nhim. if\n&gt; that tells how great I am.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zeni: You can still be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow: Open the damn door!\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow never let up, never stopped yelling until he got what he \nwanted...\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 12:23 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Dark returns...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightlight:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not in position to lie...
