( No offence, of coarse.)\nNo matter, he wouldn&#39;t be in the Beast Wars at all if he had ever let a \nlittle weight bring him down.Besides, his own damage was making his \nabilities weaken.\nDinobot then began to walk off in the direction of the cliff-side cave, he \nscanned it as he walked and saw that it was more then big enough to house \ntwo transformers.\nDinobot suddenly heard his stomach gurgle and knew that he was hungry, he \ndecided that as soon as he got Tavatron steeled he would go out and catch \nbreakfast.*\n\n( Carnage_Blood: Please don&#39;t mind me moving Tavatron like this, she&#39;s tired \nand Dinobot decided to do the work of walking for her.)\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
