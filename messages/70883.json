Wh=\r\nat now?&quot;\n\nTucson rumbles his engine a bit, signalling a hint of anger, yet =\r\ncontrolled. He knew if he charged and gave into his emotions it would blow =\r\nthe entire operation out of the water.  He did not want to do that.  He thi=\r\nnks for a moment.\n\n&quot; According to Cheetor, we have our work cut out for us.=\r\n  We have a magma chamber around the fortress, temperature enhanced armor a=\r\nround the tower of the complex, which to many of us who can not fly, will n=\r\not be able to access easilly.  Talon, you can fly, thus you have a better c=\r\nhance at reaching your destination than I do.  I think I need to reiterate =\r\nthis strategy a bit.  Talon, Wind Lord, if you can, try to fly Night Shift =\r\ninto the fortress as soon as he&#39;s found a route that gets you close enough =\r\nto the fortress.  As soon as he is, he can gain access into the complex sti=\r\nll without being seen or heard.  But this may mean we have to find a way to=\r\n cloak your own signatures...  And you may be out of range of my sonar syst=\r\nems at that point..  Lord Elder, you will remain with me, I could use your =\r\nimput to guide us and I need a driver obviously..&quot;\n\nRat Trap raises a paw.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Wheels, I think I got a better idea.  Instead of sending Night Shift, why=\r\n not send me instead?  I&#39;m small enough and only one person has ta carry me=\r\n in.  No offense, Night Shift, but I am a lot lighter.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.=\r\n\n\n&quot;It&#39;s cool, no, it&#39;s a good idea.  Because if you can get in there before=\r\n me, you could probably disable the controls that alter the temperature of =\r\nthe fortress armor..  Yeah, that&#39;ll definitely work for all of us.&quot;\n\nTucson=\r\n turns to Night Shift.\n\n&quot;I have to admit, that is a good idea.  It pays to =\r\nlisten to comrades.  All right then, first, Windlord, if you could, carry R=\r\nat Trap in the most safest possible route to the fortress, get him close en=\r\nough to the complex where he can be unseen and unheard.  From there he may =\r\nbe able to disable the software that controls the security system.  Percept=\r\nor, you will be needed to keep Rat Trap updated, so he can navigate properl=\r\ny.&quot; \n\nRat Trap smiles as does Night Shift.\n\nTucson then turns to Rodimus.\n\n=\r\n&quot; As originally planned, I will send word to you if things go awry. I have =\r\nlearned that now is not the time to go on personal crusades, but time to co=\r\nllaborate with others to become a greater force.&quot;\n\nHe straigthens out his t=\r\nrailer, and positions himself at the exit door.\n\n&quot;All right, now is the tim=\r\ne.  Phase two.  Windlord, Rat Trap, depart.  And good luck to you both.&quot;\n\nR=\r\nat Trap Nodds.\n\n&quot;Okay Windlord, ready when you are.  Geeze it feels good ta=\r\n be back in action again.&quot;\n\nTucson now turns to Kup and Straight Shot.\n\n&quot; S=\r\nince we&#39;ve had to alter our plans somewhat, you will move in with Night Shi=\r\nft, as soon as Rat Trap is able to disable some of the security systems.  I=\r\nt will make easier passage for all of you.  Night Shift will alert you to p=\r\nending danger, as is his finest attribute on the battle field.  Now, it&#39;s t=\r\nime to show Hydras what we&#39;re made of.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Air=\r\nshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord/Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;no&quot; whisper=\r\ned Kup with fear of his young friend while windlord couldnt \n&gt; contain his =\r\nrage much longer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: supercyclonus\n=\r\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 22, 2010 1:35 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Su=\r\nbject: Operation Black Tower\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot sits wel=\r\nl in Kups hands, ready and rearing for battle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, let&#39;s get thi=\r\ns party started. It&#39;s about time we stuck a few arrows \n&gt; &gt; up lizard afts =\r\ntail end.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift chuckles at Straight Shot&#39;s statement, as he=\r\n acklowledges \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor&#39;s downloads.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Gettn&#39; &#39;em now Percepto=\r\nr. Maaaan talk about heavy intel. There&#39;s no \n&gt; &gt; chance I&#39;m gonna get lost=\r\n now. Hmmm, I might be able ta configure a safe \n&gt; &gt; short cut inta the for=\r\ntress... Any chance ya got the codes ta disable any \n&gt; &gt; security software =\r\nI might have ta know about?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson waits patiently for Cheetor&#39;s n=\r\news of clear passage as he \n&gt; &gt; transforms into his vehicle mode, opening h=\r\nis doors to Lord Elder, and \n&gt; &gt; Talon. His engine rumbles at the start yet=\r\n runs quietly after being \n&gt; &gt; started, which was a signature trade mark of=\r\n his previous vehicle form, \n&gt; &gt; who&#39;s engine was barely even heard when st=\r\nanding idol. Night Shift also \n&gt; &gt; gets into vehicle form, opening his door=\r\ns to Windlord and Perceptor. His \n&gt; &gt; engine silences after being started y=\r\net remains idol.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Night Shift, as soon as Cheetor comes back, and =\r\nrelays the intel, you \n&gt; &gt; will slowly advance into position with Perceptor=\r\n and Windlord. Take your \n&gt; &gt; time, we are not rushing into this because th=\r\ne faster we travel, the \n&gt; &gt; faster we will raise suspicion. Feel free to t=\r\nake any path you wish. If \n&gt; &gt; you wish to go off road, even better. Try no=\r\nt to kick up any dust on your \n&gt; &gt; tires if you can help it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night=\r\n Shift nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gotchya. If anyone can roll in silent mode, it&#39;s me.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson then turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I can get everyone to m=\r\nove in slowly, we have a very good chance of \n&gt; &gt; going unseen and unheard.=\r\n I also plan to send a mild sonar wave which \n&gt; &gt; should mask all our signa=\r\ntures, including those of Perceptors, by using a \n&gt; &gt; signal configuration =\r\ncode. I haven&#39;t tried doing that but I do know my \n&gt; &gt; sonar system can wor=\r\nk around various codes and configure a buffer that \n&gt; &gt; will not harm anyon=\r\ne who isn&#39;t under our signature. If at any time, you \n&gt; &gt; feel that our pla=\r\nn is not working, feel free to intervine&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride then turns t=\r\no Lord Elder and Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I should definitely be able to smell tro=\r\nuble if it comes. And don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; worry, I won&#39;t let anyone down. Just to le=\r\nt you guys know, I work better \n&gt; &gt; in beast form, since that&#39;s where all m=\r\ny senses are. Well, I better get \n&gt; &gt; out there&#39;n start patrol duty. You&#39;ll=\r\n know where ta find me. QUICKSTRIDE, \n&gt; &gt; MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that he g=\r\nets into his equine mode and walks out instead of bolting \n&gt; &gt; out of the A=\r\nrk, to keep suspcions low. He sniffs the ground and as part of \n&gt; &gt; the ill=\r\nusion, nibbles at a few blades of grass. Yet, his ears remain \n&gt; &gt; focused =\r\non the task at hand as does his eyes and nose. He raises his head \n&gt; &gt; whil=\r\ne nibbling, remaining still and doing what horses do best, which was \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\ntaying still, and occasionally lowering their heads for a few snips of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n grass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded as he brought his console fully =\r\nonline. Screens lit up as \n&gt; communication gear began to glow with readines=\r\ns. &quot;We will do what we can.&quot; \n&gt; He said, his voice, despite his words, was =\r\nfull of confidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Be careful.&quot; Lord Elder said, his voice, as alway=\r\ns the voice of reason. &quot;I \n&gt; can send Rodimus to back you up if need be, bu=\r\nt our sensors will not be able \n&gt; to track you beyond a certain point. You =\r\nwill be on your own unless you call \n&gt; us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But if you call, we will =\r\nbe ready.&quot; Rodimus said, the old enthusiasm \n&gt; creeping back into his voice=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cheetor to base!&quot; Cheetor&#39;s voice crackeled over the comm.-channel.=\r\n &quot;I&#39;ve \n&gt; gotten here.&quot; He said, he was obviously out of breath from the tr=\r\navel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor whisteled over the channel, &quot;You should see what they&#39;ve=\r\n done.&quot; \n&gt; Cheetor is not equipped with cameras, but his voice continued, &quot;=\r\nThe base \n&gt; looks totally rebuilt, like some sort of fortified tower, encas=\r\ned in armor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a pause, the sound of movement, probably Cheeto=\r\nr, and then he \n&gt; continued, &quot;There is a small lake of magma here, and the =\r\ntower is sitting in \n&gt; the *middle* of it. If you can&#39;t fly, you are going =\r\nto have trouble getting \n&gt; to it.&quot; There was another pause, &quot;From what my t=\r\nhermal scanners tell me, the \n&gt; surface of the tower is HOT, all that hot r=\r\nock sitting near it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The sound of more movement, &quot;Slag!&quot; The sound of=\r\n movement, &quot;I see one . . . \n&gt; two . . . three?? Scourge&#39;s flying around he=\r\nre.&quot; He sounded definitely \n&gt; confused. &quot;They seem to be patrolling.&quot; His v=\r\noice dropped to a whisper, &quot;I&#39;m \n&gt; signing off, I think they can hear me . =\r\n. .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Click&gt; the line is shut off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder turned to look at T=\r\nuscon as Rodimus stood up trying to reopen the \n&gt; comm-channel, &quot;Cheetor! C=\r\nHEETOR!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The channel remained silent.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
