It would be best right now if everyone got into the bunker before the \nArmada sent someone or something else. Besides it was begginning to rain and \nthunder.\n    &quot;Everyone! Listen! I need to very brave bots to go and find Megatron, \narrest him, and bring him back here!&quot; She looked into the faces of her \ntroops. &quot;He knows vital information about the Aliens, and Im afraid he is \ngoing to use it agianst ALL of us.&quot; She said still holding a smoking \nbowcaster.\n    Megatron was the only one to come in contact with the Aliens. He fled and \nwas gone from scans. Knowing him, he was probly trying to contact them \nhimself. And that wasnt good.\n    She continued, &quot;If Im right, then were all in troble. He is sure to cause \nus all great pain. We nedd two of the best warriors. I want Darkmouse to go \nbecause she has energon flowing within her, and that should sustain her \nthrough great damage...&quot;\n    Aracnia looked longingly at the mouse.\n\n    Megatron was indeed planning on contacting the Aliens, but the noise out \nside, along with the battle, was ruining his plans. For the most part all he \nknew was that a small army had come to destroy his troops, and he lost 2 \nalready and had a remaining four, including Waspinator.\n    Waspinator was nervous, he paced and fluttered here and there. One minute \nhe wanted to fight, the next minute he was terrified. Megatron saw this and \nwas ready to bash his face in.\n    &quot;Get outside now! I want the invaders crushed!&quot; Megatron roared, slamming \nthe bug into a few nearby computeres.\n    Waspinator sprung up and jetted over to KitKat and covered her in the \ncrossfire. Megatron returned to his work.\n    Soon, he hoped, he would be in contact with Apollo agian. But this time \nhe would be ready. Because this time he held a wepon that would not only \nthreaten Apollo, but his whole damned species as well.\n\n"}}
