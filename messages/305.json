If you want you can\n&gt; come with me to the Lion and Dragon room after I&#39;v done a little something\n&gt; to enhance our odds of winning,&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Turns back towards the screen and attachs herself online again. The star\n&gt; appearers again, it&#39;s points stretch and contract as Iris speaks again.*\n&gt; Iris: &quot; That was a short nap. Decided about my upgrade yet?&quot;\n&gt; *Iron Raptor shakes her head.*\n&gt; &quot; This is to serious a time now, Iris. I need you to download into the\nArks\n&gt; major system and run yourself off of my energy cell.&quot;\n&gt; Iris: &quot; And what does that mean, you&#39;r gunna run an extension cord from\n&gt; yourself to me while you fight?&quot;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor snarls.*\n&gt; &quot; Remember, you&#39;re a separate system. I&#39;m just going to download you into\n&gt; the Ark and leave an energy cell behind for you. Nothing complicated.\n&gt; Although, you will have to dormant until someone calls you up for you to\n&gt; start running the defence systems. In simple words, you&#39;r our back up\nplan.&quot;\n&gt; Iris:&quot;So if the Ark starts to run low on power and it&#39;s defence systems\n&gt; start to go offline then someone can call me up and then get the Ark to\nrun\n&gt; it&#39;s systems off me?&quot;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor nodded then quickly downloaded Iris onto the Ark&#39;s main\n&gt; system, she then detached herself and smiled when the star remained on the\n&gt; screen.*\n&gt; &quot; Alright now, I&#39;m going to put you on sleep mode. Any sign that the Ark\nis\n&gt; in serious trouble...activate.&quot;\n&gt; *Iron Raptor typed in a few codes and the screen went blank, she then took\na\n&gt; round tube of energy from herself and placed it behind the screen. Still\n&gt; attached was the cord connecting to the screen for the power to activate\n&gt; Iris.\n&gt; Iron Raptor turned to Tigerhawk...*\n&gt; &quot; Remember that, if the Ark starts to loose power fast just ask for Iris\nand\n&gt; she&#39;ll start running the systems on her own.If you want, it&#39;s up to you.&quot;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor turns and begins to walk towards the door, she had to check\n&gt; something out in the Lion and Dragon room before the battle began. There\nwas\n&gt; something that she needed to know.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 10% Off FogDog.com, Disney.com, eCost.com and many more.\n&gt; You get paid as you shop with the Pointclick network.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3417/7/_/_/_/956258148/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
