We were mearly comrads in arms. But I \nfeel a pain anytime a comrad is lost.  I am sorry that any life was lost in \nbattle. Especially when it was lost for no realy reason.  THis whole war is \nsenseless. A biproduct of war is death.  And death pains me.&quot; She looked up \nat Lunarpine. &quot;I didn&#39;t know him well as a friend.  He was a good commander \nthough.  He will be missed.&quot; She wiped her eyes and stood up. &quot;But we have \nno time to morn his passing now.  We will morn when we have time to do so.  \nRight now, we must concentrate on the living and to keep us living.&quot; she \nsmiled. &quot;Someday, this will be nothing but an unpleasent memory. I just hope \nthat day is soon.&quot; She walked inside the ship.\n\n-----original message----\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Sat Jul 1, 2000 1:24am\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n\nLunarpine sees Shadow wings sorrow, and wishes he could change it.\nHer spark was genuinly good, it&#39;s a ahame to have it soiled by war.\n\nIn an attempt to comfort his new friend he comes closer\n\n&quot;Did you know him well?
