A spider-like probe scurries from its\nhiding spot under the desk out into the room.\n\nIn a single bound Trelos jumps to the center of the room and in front\nit.  It leaps at Trelos only to be ripped in half by his powerful jaws\nand thrown against a wall, smashing several computer screens.\n\nHe jumps up on the desk where it landed, destroying more equipment and\ncontinues to rip apart the spiderbot until it ceases to move.\n\nHe quickly becomes bored and leaves the room in search of more prey.\n\n\n\nOOC: ok, that was confusing with the post titles.  It probably would\nhave been better to start a new thread; posting accross several\nthreads was pretty difficult to follow.\n\nTeleportation??? that&#39;s a new one for me.\n\nOn 2/16/08, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   OOC: Preston, do we have ourselves Skywarp rebuilt in a Armada\n&gt; &gt; Starscream like body?\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: I did not intend to, but its open. He is Nightrazor, the minion\n&gt; created by Cyclonus from the soldiers found in a decepticon shuttle\n&gt; that crashed on Earth. I did base his form on Skywarp and he does\n&gt; posses many of his abilities, so I will not actually close that avenue\n&gt; if you want to explore it.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW there is a Skywarp that is a recolor of Armada Starscream, which is\n&gt; where I got the pic for Nightrazor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?\n&gt; Find them fast with Yahoo!
