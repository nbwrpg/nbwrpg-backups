He\n&gt; knew getting mad at Stingtra for no reason wasn&#39;t going to help. He had to\n&gt; be patient on a matter like this.\n&gt;\n&gt; He paused and watched his scanners. He found Stingtra&#39;s signature and saw\n&gt; that she was back at base. He felt like an idiot now, just trying to chase\n&gt; her tail. He growled at himself and made his way back.\n&gt;\n&gt; When he came back, he barely saw anyone, even when he said for no one to\n&gt; leave. Dark Mouse and Megatron wasn&#39;t here either. But he did see Stingtra\n&gt; hurting herself again. He ran over to her and knelt down. He blocked her\n&gt; head before she hit it again over the wall of the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is what ah&#39;m talkin&#39; about,&quot; he said, watching carefully with his\n&gt; temper.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Conference in the whole family on the same call.\n&gt; Let the fights begin!
