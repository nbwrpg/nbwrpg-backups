He also knew \nthat \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had a problem submitting to rage. It nearly cost him a friend, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; later on his eyesight. His anger nealy got him into a fight \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ripper back at the Ark. It fealt like a battle was taking place \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside of him between the wolf and the bot, he didn&#39;t know \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; winning, but he knew it had to stop.

She felt his soft fur against her arms and face and she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hugged him. She smiled and said in a soft voice,&quot; Your \nwelcome. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything for a good friend like you.&quot;  She was just happy to \nbe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, no matter what, she wanted to be with him.
