Tavatron knew that this &#39;bot deserved to be injured, \nbut not like this. She was afraid, Tavatron could here it in her voice. This \nwas NOT the way to resolve this issue.\n\nTavatron dropped her weapon and grabbed Dinobot&#39;s wrists before his claws \ncould reach Cyber Claw. She glared up at him, knowing that she risked great \npersonal injury by interfering. Still, something about this didn&#39;t seem \nright. There had to be more to it. There had to be a reason for all of this, \na reason for this charade. Tavatron was willing to listen to this &#39;bot&#39;s \nreason, whatever it may be, for trying to decieve them. Tavatron looked up \nat Dinobot:\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\nThe message was plain and simple, no meant no. No fighting and no bloodshed. \nShe knew Dinobot would most likely be angry with her for challenging him, \nslag, she didn&#39;t even know why she was doing this. Dinobot would probably \nhate her for the rest of her life, and the very thought of that frightened \nher more than anything. Tavatron didn&#39;t want to lose him as a friend, he \nmeant too much to her. All she could do was hope and pray that Dinobot would \nfind it in his spark to forgive her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
