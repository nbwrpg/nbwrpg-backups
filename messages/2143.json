She loved the feel of his metallic muscles move under her touch, his optics, his voice, everything.\nThe tense feeling in Iron Raptor&#39;s own muscles seemed to drain away into nothing as Prowl had kissed her again, it was a feeling that she loved as well. She had never been able to imagine herself with a loved one but here she was, in the arms on one that seemed to be just as keen of her as she was of him. It was exciting! She had always loved the thrills of battle but the thrills of this was even better! Slag battle, she was sticking with this!\nBut as Prowl had kissed her she had kissed back, wanting him to feel her emotions this time. She was excited and relaxed both at the same time, this obvious in her deep but even breathing.\nBesides, it was only fair.*\n \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
