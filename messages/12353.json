Many curious had happened to him\nthis day. He firmly believed that the Matrix had a\npurpose for all bots, and for all things.Did the\nMatrix send him to this planet, to Battera, to show\nhim up what his purpose was? Was his true purpose to\nbring this war to an end?He picked up a small stone\nand tossed it across the water. &quot;I guess I got plenty\nof time to figure that out&quot;, he thought.For now, he\nhad more things to discuss with Battera. He\ntransformed to beast mode, and flew back towards the\nCF to find her.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
