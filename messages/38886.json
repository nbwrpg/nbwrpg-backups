The ship sailed through clouds until \nplowing into the frozen ice glades of the mountain.  Havotron gripped \nhis chair as the ship lost control going through the mountain creating a \ntunnel behind it.  Quake was loving the shaking as he stood there strong \nuse to the shaking.  Scrapper heard firm to control stick tryign to keep \nthe engines from plowing off.  The ship finally came to a stop as it \nbroke through into a cavern.  Lakes of magma sat around there ship as it \nhad dug a small crater around it.\n\nHavotron stood for a few seconds, not sure if all was well. Then turned \nto Scrapper and Hook. &quot;Good job, Contructicons.  The landing was \neverything I would expect from you too. &quot; He looked around.  &quot;Nightmare, \nbegin a role call, I want to make sure we have our full forces. \nScrapper and Hook, gather you contructicons and begin work on the outer \nbase contrcution. This shall be our final placement.&quot;\n\nQuake walked to in front of Nightmare and stood to attention.  &quot;Unit \nQuake, reporting&quot; he said alot more confident now as he was one of the \nonly to stay astand in the landing.\n\nNeedlenose got up off the floor, reaching a hand down to pick up \nSpinister who he had flew into .  Before he could reach all the way down \nhe went into stasis lock and fell back onto Spinister.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the Hidden One JetV smiled as his plan had worked.  By cutting the \nsmall jets they had created heat until the engine had started up, thus \nallowing them to come to a slower hit.  The groud was still approaching \nfast however.\n\n\n\nrdahl@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Over a silent valley smoke rose up. In its blissful calm birds chirped,\n&gt; as larger animals moved away from the crater ruins that lead for a few\n&gt; miles, to a large alien craft. The Autobot&#39;s Hidden one, littered the\n&gt; primitive natural apearance of the dirt. Beside it, a small clanking\n&gt; could be heard. In another much smaller alien craft sitting only a few\n&gt; feet away, a small robot figuere banged his fists against the winshield\n&gt; of the bi-jet. Caliburst, a nebulan organic creature bio engenired to\n&gt; become a weapon of mass destruction for a mechanic warrior race, tried\n&gt; to escape his binary partners unintentional tomb.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;W, WAKE UP SLUGSLINGER.&quot; he pleaded worriedly. Ussually he didnt show\n&gt; fear, as a famous actor he knew how to never show his real emotions, but\n&gt; landing badly dammaged next to a huge ship carrying your mortal enemies\n&gt; was a good reason to worry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally the Bi-jet cockpit glass gave way to the metal knuckles, as it\n&gt; shattered. Caliburst climbed from a blanket of glass, and looked around.\n&gt; This bizzare planet reminded him of Nebula. The silence was ominous\n&gt; however, as he was sure that the Autobot ship was looking at him.\n&gt; Nervously he turned around, and began to whisper. &quot;Get up Slugslinger,\n&gt; we&#39;ve got to get outta here before the Autobots get it together. We&#39;ve\n&gt; gotta find Havotron, he will protect us,&quot; he thought, remembering back\n&gt; to Slugslinger threatening their leader.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Inside the large golden craft, in the pilot area, a form began to move\n&gt; out of the rest of the fallen. &quot;Ohhhhhh man, that was a kick in the\n&gt; afterburner.&quot; the gruff voice commented, as a white Autobot pulled\n&gt; himself up. Strafe, part of a group of five Autobot warriors who were\n&gt; built by Grimlock to be the most versatile Gestalt ever, shook off the\n&gt; cobwebs, as his head shifted at what would be painful angles for a human\n&gt; being. As it went 180 degrees, and joint cracked, and a lose bolt popped\n&gt; out. He looked around, and shook a nearby Scattershot, but lost\n&gt; interest, as he looked out one of the windows at smoking wreckage.\n&gt; &quot;hmmmmmmmm.&quot; he thought outloud.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
