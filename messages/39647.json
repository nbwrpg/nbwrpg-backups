T=\r\nheir double-bladed swords\nslice the air. It is\nsparring, but one mistake st=\r\nill means death. Stallex\nis by far the more\ntalented fighter, but he can no=\r\nt match his father in\nstrength and speed, so\nMustex continues pushing Stall=\r\nex back. Mustex gets a\ngood blow to Stallex&#39;s\nchest. Stallex buckles under =\r\nthe pain.\nMustex:Why did you stop?\nStallex:It hurts.\nMustex:Don&#39;t stop. If =\r\nyou don&#39;t give into the pain it\nwill hurt 10 times\nmore. If you give into t=\r\nhe pain you&#39;re enemy will see\nthat it hurts 100 times\nmore. I&#39;ve seen alot =\r\nof bots fall from that mistake.\nAlot of bots wouldn&#39;t\nhave bothered teachin=\r\ng you that. Now back to beast\nmode.\nStallex:Beast Mode!\nMustex:Beast Mode!\n=\r\nStallex:Internal repairs.\n They begin to run off. The two horses run quickl=\r\ny\nover the desert.\nStallex:What&#39;s our next mission.\nMustex:Yours is in &quot;Tra=\r\nining City&quot;. There&#39;s a monkey\nthere named Rhesus. He&#39;s\nan old friend and he=\r\n can teach you about stealth.\nStallex:What about you?\nMustex:I have a plan =\r\nto take out the &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but\nit&#39;s a 1 bot job.\nStallex:You know how dan=\r\ngerous that is.\nMustex:Yes but  it&#39;s even harder for 2 bots to\ninfiltrate. =\r\nI have a shot\nalone though.\nStallex:O.k., but come back alive.

I can hear the cry\n&quot;Carnitrons Carnivate&quot;. We were the only sensi=\r\nble\ngroup. We had a simple\nmotto of &quot;stay alive&quot;.\nMustex:Shutup! If we were=\r\n so great then why did I lead\nus to get ambushed by\nthe &quot;Alliance&quot; for our =\r\nfirst battle. As I recall 5 of\nthe 7 of us were\ndamaged beyond repair. Now =\r\nI see that anything except\na 2-way war leads to\nextra senseless casulties. =\r\nThat&#39;s why I intend to make\neveryone pick Maximal\nor Predicon. All you can =\r\nthink about is revenge on the\n&quot;Alliance&quot;,and the\nrebirth of a lost cause. A=\r\nll I want is these parts and\na transport.\n Mustex hands Rhesus a paper.

So,we can fi=\r\nnally get revenge for Croctas,\nKangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\nmy lovely Monke=\r\nssa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a\ndozen special\nhover-cycles. They shoul=\r\nd do fine for you.\nMustex:Oh, and by the way I told my son you&#39;d train\nhim.=\r\n\nRhesus:Small price to pay. Does he know about the\n&quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.\nMustex=\r\n:Not a clue.\nRhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t snich &#39;till you come to\nyour senses=\r\n.\n Rhesus hands Mustex a large box of parts and walks\naway to train Stallex=\r\n.\n\n3.Mustex\nLocation:Training City,Egypt\nStatus:Traveling\nDestination:Allia=\r\nnce Island,Spain\nETA:5 hours\n\nRhesus:Come back alive.

Uh,that is\nuntil=\r\n you get back.\nMustex:bye\n Mustex jumps onto his waiting hover-cycle and ra=\r\nces\noff.\n\n4.Mustex\nLocation:Alliance Island, Spain\nStatus:Infiltration\n\n Mu=\r\nstex looks at the newly completed drone in front of\nhim. He activates\nthe D=\r\n.N.A. simulator. The drone takes on his\nappearance. He is positioned 500\nya=\r\nrds from the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\nan attack unless he\nget=\r\ns closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\nIt begins its mission\nto=\r\n plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\nbase, 40 feet under. When\nh=\r\nis monitor says the drone is done he calls out the\ncode that will activate\n=\r\nthe drones programming.\nMustex:Beast Mode!\n Mustex turns on his jammer and =\r\nattaches it to his\nbelt. The drone begins\ntransmitting a Maximal  frequency=\r\n,goes to Beast\nMode,and bounds for the base.\nMustex keeps low to the ground=\r\n so he won&#39;t be spotted.\nThe auto-guns begin\nfiring, but no transformers co=\r\nme out. The horse jumps\naway from every shot.\nHe stops at 100 yards away.\nD=\r\nrone:Mustex Maximize!\n The drone transforms and begins firing arrows at the=\r\n\nshield of the base. He\ndodges all the beams,but only has enough power at t=\r\nhis\nkind of level for 15\nminutes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t need that long. Th=\r\ne\nmain turrets fireand take\nhim out. The shields flicker from power loss,bu=\r\nt stay\nintact. Mustex then\nsmiles when his monitor shows the pocket sized d=\r\nrone\nthe pocket sized drone\nhas reached the surface. He activates the devic=\r\ne and\nit transmites a Maximal\nfrequency. The drone then starts firing. It h=\r\nas enough\npower for 6 shots. The\n&quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main=\r\n turret\nfires again and the shield\ngoes down. Mustex deactivates th device =\r\nand charges.\nMustex:Beast Mode!\n As he charges he scans the base. The shiel=\r\nds will be\ndown for the next hour.\nIt will be down for the next hour. It wi=\r\nll take him 10\nminutes to navigate\nthe corridors to his destination and 10 =\r\nminutes to get\nback. He will go in\nthe  one way they won&#39;t expect,The Front=\r\n Door, 10\nyards away he transforms.\nMustex:Mustex Maximize!\n Mustex draws a=\r\n cyber arrow and blows the door open.\nUsing his frequency\njammer as cover h=\r\ne sneaks to his destination. He walks\ninto the Energon\nstorage room. The En=\r\nergon will magnify the explosion\nof the small explosive\nhe made. He walks o=\r\nver to a computer console and hooks\nit up to the\n&quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a r=\r\nemote connection is placed\non it it will blow from\n2 connections to the net=\r\nwork. It can detect the\nEnergon and will blow if much\nis removed. It can de=\r\ntect the energon in the room and\nwill blow if to much is\nremoved. It takes =\r\n20 minutes to diffuse and it would\nbe set for 15. There is\nno deactivation =\r\ncode. The full blast could probably\nnot be contained. Even if\nthe explosive=\r\n is covered an electronic signal will\nignite the energon. He set\nit and ran=\r\n out.\n\n            CHECK! Your move Zardus(feel free to\n             head f=\r\nor your time machine this\n              qualifies as a catastophe).\n\n______=\r\n_________________________________________\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n  From: Legendarynemasis@... \n  To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Fri=\r\nday, July 13, 2001 10:51 PM\n  Subject: Re: Iron Fist\n\n\n  Eh?

The&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret&lt;BR&gt;fires ag=\r\nain \nand the shield&lt;BR&gt;goes down.

He walks over to a com=\r\nputer console and hooks&lt;BR&gt;it \nup to the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote=\r\n connection is placed&lt;BR&gt;on it it \nwill blow from&lt;BR&gt;2 connections to the n=\r\network.
