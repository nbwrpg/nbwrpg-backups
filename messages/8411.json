KSLawdogg is politely keeping track of the bots he \nmercylessly butchered for me, so hopefully I&#39;ll get all the dead bots to \nwhere they belong.\n\n::Rex/Firearm::\n\nRex and Firearm fly on their way toward Savanna&#39;s last reported position, \nscanning the ground for anything suspicious.\n\n&quot;Is that supposed to be there?&quot; Firearm asks, pointing at a path through the \nwoods, one that was rapidly becoming longer. Rex narrows his eyes, checking \nhis scanners.\n\n&quot;Nope! That&#39;s not a Maximal signature either.&quot;\n\nFirearm nods. &quot;Let&#39;s get &#39;em.&quot;\n\nThe two Maximals change course to fly overhead the three bounty hunters. \nFirearm looks down at the bots, turning his head at a growl from Rex.\n\n&quot;Hot Rod&#39;s up ahead,&quot; Rex says, &quot;He&#39;s being carried by another Maximal, along \nwith someone else... Someone dead, as the scanners report.&quot;\n\nFirearm narrows his eyes. &quot;These three are going to be sorry.&quot;\n\nHe slowly loses altitude, setting the cannon on his arm to flamethrower, and \nfiring a continous stream down at Improsoner and co.\n\nRex pulls out his missile launcher, firing a shot at Imprisoner.\n\n"}}
