He tightened his finger, but\nstopped at a deep voice. &quot;Nooooo. He dosent need to back up his words. I\ndo it for him.&quot; a dark ominous voice said from behind.\nQuake whirled around, but could only see half of a robot shrouded by\nsome sort of smoke. SLuglsinger jumped up from his seat. &quot;Ohhh boy, this\nis to much for me.&quot; he said frantically, jumping out of his seat, and\nrunning out of the bar, joined by Caliburst. Slugslinger transformed,\nand opened his cockpit, which Caliburst gracefully entered, as they sped\naway from the conflict.\n\nMeanwhile in the bar, Quake fired at the smoke cloud, only to miss the\nrobot, who slowly weaved out of the way of each shot. Quake screamed, as\nTiptop transformed into his gun mode, and landed in the other hand.\n&quot;Your gonna die Stranger.&quot; He threatened, filling the cloud with gun\nfire. From behind the voice came again. &quot;No one messes with a\nCybernight, and lives.&quot; the voice whispered, this time from behind\nQuake. The room was to small, and was easily filling up with the smoke,\nand making it hard for Quake to determine anything.\n\n"}}
