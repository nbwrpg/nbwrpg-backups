He&lt;br&gt; walked up to the wall and pulled open a hatch, revealing a manual&lt;br&gt; crank for the doors.  As they turn the crank, the door slowly lowers&lt;br&gt; into the closed position. &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &quot;He wont be getting out this way!&quot; shouted one of the troopers&lt;br&gt; confidently as they moved to seal off the armory next.&lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; Meanwhile...&lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; Having been given orders to return to base, he decided that he had&lt;br&gt; better find a way out of the base. &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &quot;AGGGGGGGG!&quot; he shouted as the door to the secret exit shuddered. &lt;br&gt; After a second and third blow, the door was off and was blown about 50&lt;br&gt; feet from the door frame.&lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; As Trelos took off down the corridor, Perseus finally managed to get&lt;br&gt; the door open to the lower section.  He could immediately see that&lt;br&gt; Trelos had taken the not-so-secret exit-way.  With no\n power to the&lt;br&gt; forcefields, it was a simple matter of running.  He looked into the&lt;br&gt; security office and saw the guard laying unconscious or perhaps dead. &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &quot;Perseus to all personnel.  The prisoner appears to have escaped out&lt;br&gt; the lower exit.  We need to catch him before he reaches the city.&quot; he&lt;br&gt; said into the radio, then taking off down the passageway.  &quot;Kenzo, we&lt;br&gt; have one guard in need of attention, he appears to have been attacked&lt;br&gt; by the prisoner.&quot; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &gt; On 8/8/07, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote: Trelos snarls and scrapes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e&quot; id=&quot;q_11469abf39d1a314_3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt; half the metal off a support beam which is over the doorway leading to&lt;br&gt; the room with the exit door and the door to the rest of the base.

I believe that our prisoner&lt;br&gt; who murdered those policemen earlier, is back on the loose,&quot; said&lt;br&gt; Perseus with a sigh. &quot;He seems to have a perverse fascination with&lt;br&gt; killing....&quot; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey dinosaur bones!
