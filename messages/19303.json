He jolted, glaring at him with huge optics. Quickstrike&#39;s \nface forced a grin on his mouth plate. He stepped forward, until he  \nbacked him up. \n\n&quot;Ah owe ya this,&quot; Quickstrike said. \n\nHe backed up close to the CR chamber. While the rat reached for his \ngun, he decked him across the head. Rattrap hit the floor with a \nclang. Quickstrike stepped up closer, then hold his foot on his body. \n\n&quot;Ah&#39;m gonna have fun goin&#39; this.&quot;\n\nRattrap stirred lightly, trying to pick up his head. Quickstrike \ngrabbed him and picked him up, lifting him off from the floor. He \nchuckled, then threw him.\n\n&quot;Yer gonna regret livin&#39;, vermin.&quot; He laughed with the curving strips \nof metal quivering.\n\n\n"}}
