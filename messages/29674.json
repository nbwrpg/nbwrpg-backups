Fliq&#39;s hand moves his gun,\n&gt; pointing the \n&gt; barrel at Strafe.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My name is Fliq,&quot; Fliq says as best as he could\n&gt; right now. &quot;I&#39;m a \n&gt; Maximal. We found you in a crash site and repaired\n&gt; you, you&#39;re in our \n&gt; base.&quot;\n\nStrafe had to grin.\n\n&quot;You actually think that after all I&#39;ve just been\nthrough that I&#39;m intimidated by your little gun? I\ndon&#39;t think so.&quot;\n\nStrafe used his other hand to grab Strafe&#39;s gun hand,\npointing it elsewhere.\n\n&quot;Maximal.&quot;\n\nHe thought. &quot;So I owe my life to a housepet?&quot; \n\nHe begun to laugh, then pulled Strafe to him,\ngrinning....then setting the smaller Maximal down,\nletting go and sitting up. The seeker jet thorougly\ndwarfed Fliq (Not moding. Optimus Prime himself stood\nat about 20 feet tall in robot mode).\n\n&quot;Housepet or not, I do owe you my life. So in return,\nI give you my word that I am no threat to you or your\nallies and that unless I am physically provoked, no\nharm will come to any of you. I am Strafe, Lieutenant\nof the Death&#39;s Hand Division commanded by Colonel\nNeotron.&quot;\n\nHe bowed.\n\n&quot;Or at least I used to be.&quot;\n\nHe checked his joints, tranformed into jet mode and\nback again, transforming his twin blasters to the\ndouble-barreled hand-wielded blaster he normally used\nand transformed them back to his arms where they\nnormally resided. He could either use them as a\ndouble-barreled blaster or as twin blasters mounted on\neach arm (like on Starscream) depending on the\nsituation.  He seemed to calm down instantly.\n\n&quot;I must say...Fliq, you did a wonderful job repairing\nme...and since I can&#39;t exactly rejoin my Decepticon\ncomrades and since I made sure Scud and Razor couldn&#39;t\nreport back to Colonel Neotron back on Cybertron...&quot;\n\nHe chuckled with a hint of sadistic glee, then\nnarrowed his eyes at Fliq. \n\n&quot;I may as well stay here awhile. So tell me,\nhousepet...are defectors welcome?&quot;\n\n(tag Fliq...or Iron Raptor or whoever)\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
