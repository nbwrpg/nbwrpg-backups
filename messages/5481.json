It reminded \nhim of an Alpha wolf, the pack leader. Just the tone of his commands \nshowed that Striker was a bot programmed for leadership. Striker knew \nwhen to command and when to back down. Striker came across as a \nleader, but not THE leader. \n\nLunarpine looked at the damaged ship and asked, &quot;Should I stay and \nhelp fortify a defensive perimeter, most likely we weren&#39;t the only \none to detect the crash.&quot; Or do you want me to accompany you back to \nthe Ark?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker/Ramulus/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No,&quot; Striker replies on his comm-link, &quot;All the survivors are in \nmore or \n&gt; less good shape. The rest died in the crash or the battle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He stands up, looking at Kluster. &quot;I&#39;ll go get the Maximals to get \nready to \n&gt; move,&quot; he says, walking out of the ship. He looks at Lunarpine and \ntransforms \n&gt; into his beast mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get back to the Ark and get all the Maximals together,&quot; \nStriker says, \n&gt; running off toward the Ark.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus nods. His scanners were reporting that Primal was a \nMaximal. Ramulus \n&gt; looks from Primal to the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our base is kinda damaged. We&#39;re moving to a new one,&quot; he \nsays, &quot;I&#39;m here to \n&gt; get everyone ready to move.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; As the missiles fired by the Predacon base head toward the \nCybertronian Fire, \n&gt; the Maximal battle cruiser&#39;s scanners pick them up, alerting the \nautoguns and \n&gt; laser batteries into position.\n&gt; \n&gt; The missiles aproach the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; The laser batteries open fire on the advancing missiles, destroying \ntwo \n&gt; before the third hits the shields, being destroyed by them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the ship, Kluster jumps to his feet. &quot;So, the Preds decide \nto play \n&gt; rough, eh?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He grins. &quot;Computer, fire six missiles at the source of recent \nattack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acnowledged.&quot; Three of the four missile launchers on the \nCybertronian Fire \n&gt; swirl to position, each one firing two missiles, the missiles \nheading for the \n&gt; Predacon base.\n\n\n"}}
