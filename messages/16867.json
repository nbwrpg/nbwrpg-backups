The Maximals quickly followed.\n\n    Rampage lumbered down the hall way seeking Megatron. He lived in this \nship alone for months, he was going to find that over grown lizard. He turned \nthe corner, and there he saw Megatron and the Maximals. The last thing he \nremembered was a bright blue plasma pulse shooting towrds his face.\n\n    &quot;Excellent! The hatch is this way! You three go to these coordinates, I \nhave business to attend to.&quot; Megatron commanded giving them a map to the \ncave. When they left he went to the bridge. Inside he found Aracnia waiting \nfor him, along with several of her new minions.\n    &quot;Too bad Aracnia.....this could have been a new era for Predacons. You \nhad to ruin it!&quot; he yelled just before they began to open fire on him. It was \nno matter, he threw a charge in the room and bolted down the hatch. In the \ndistance he could see his new troops running to the cave. And soon he would \nbe there as well.\n\n    Aracnia cursed through the smoke, and then said, &quot;Raise shields, initiate \nAutoguns, and seal all doors!&quot; Then she took the command chair. From the \nlooks of it, several of her team was missing.\n    Tarantulas did as he was told and afterward they ran a sweep of the ship. \nInferno was missing and Rampage was injured. Megatron had escaped with the \nMaximals......things were getting worse.\n    (Terrorsaur, if your going with Megatron then ignore the sealed doors and \nsuch and just go)\n\n    The pod slammed into the earth with a crack like thunder. Hell Beast and \nGremlin then brought the computers back online and prepared to venture \noutside and back to the ship....whatever condition it was in.\n    &quot;Ah, being in command shall be good. Now all we have to do is find it.&quot; \nHell Beast siad as he opened the hatch and stepped outside. He was back home \nagian.\n\n"}}
