All you sorry sons a bitches! You ready to \nrock!?!?\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel walks out of her room and near the entrance. She \nhears \n&gt;   &gt;   Virgo&#39;s yelling and gasps. Her gasp was a gasp a glee and joy.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel: Cerulean! Bronze! Come here!\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Cerulean and Bronze stop in the hall and walk up to Hazel.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel: You guys, a fight!

Look at this.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Virgo laughs while pointing at Pink running towards her. \nVirgo \n&gt;   &gt;   allows Pink&#39;s shots to hit. She trips Pink and catches her. \nShe \n&gt;   &gt;   brutally beats down at Pink with one fist and spins her \naround, \n&gt;   &gt;   powerbombing her ontop of several sharp rocks. Virgo climbs \nto \n&gt;   her \n&gt;   &gt;   feet. Pink gasps, not able to breath form the shock and pain. \nShe \n&gt;   &gt;   squirms around, clutching at the rock impaled in her back. \nHazel \n&gt;   &gt;   stares at Virgo&#39;s cold smile. Hazel laughs some, at the same \ntime \n&gt;   &gt;   McGowan laughs.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel: Go.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Brown begins running. Depp begins walking. Brown lets out a \n&gt;   battle \n&gt;   &gt;   cry while Depp laughs some. Brown begins firing his gun at \nDepp \n&gt;   as \n&gt;   &gt;   they became dangerously close. Depp swings his sword. Brown \n&gt;   stares in \n&gt;   &gt;   horror as his hand drops to the ground. Depp raises a gun and \n&gt;   shoots \n&gt;   &gt;   Brown in the head. He collapses. McGowan raises a hand, \nsignaling \n&gt;   for \n&gt;   &gt;   Virgo and Depp to step back. They follow her orders and stand \n&gt;   beside \n&gt;   &gt;   her. Birdbot and Papertron haven&#39;t attacked yet. They were \n&gt;   waiting \n&gt;   &gt;   for Aerotaur, Nightlight and Trinity. Virgo was also waiting \nfor \n&gt;   that \n&gt;   &gt;   certain someone.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Virgo: Furry bitch furry bitch....Gonna be so frigging \ndead....\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel, White and Periwinkle begin walking towards the \n&gt;   attackers. \n&gt;   &gt;   Birdbot&#39;s eyes change color. Then, without warning, he flies \nat \n&gt;   &gt;   Hazel. She gasps and grabs White, pulling her in front of \n&gt;   herself, \n&gt;   &gt;   for protection. Birdbot digs his talons into White&#39;s chest. \nAfter \n&gt;   &gt;   several cracks, his feet bust through White&#39;s back and start \n&gt;   trying \n&gt;   &gt;   to grab Hazel, but can&#39;t reach. He rips his feet back out of \n&gt;   White, \n&gt;   &gt;   sending blood flying. Hazel blocks a fleet of shots from \nMcGowan \n&gt;   with \n&gt;   &gt;   White before dropping her. White stares, wide eyed. Her \nfingers \n&gt;   &gt;   twitch as she lays on the ground. Hazel looks at McGowan, \nwhose \n&gt;   smile \n&gt;   &gt;   had brightened. Hazel runs back over to Cerulean, Bronze and \n&gt;   &gt;   Periwinkle.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel: Damn, their good. I&#39;ve got to admit that.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hazel watches Lee and Barrymore brutally kick Pink and \nBrown \n&gt;   while \n&gt;   &gt;   a puddle of blood forms around White.\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Bronze: Maybe I&#39;ll kick ass another day...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Papertron: ERF FER FER FER!...\n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   &gt; Papertron flexes while Birdbot demands Doritos...\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;    \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
