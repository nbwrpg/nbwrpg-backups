But after this post, lets ta=\r\nke it\n  to non rpg email.\n\n  Anyway, I dont know whats up with that game, b=\r\nut Sting has never been in\n  WWF. I have is biography. He started in the in=\r\ndies, and then went to\n  Gerogia Championship Wrestling of the National Wre=\r\nstling Alliance. He\n  has been there ever since, because Georgia Championsh=\r\nip Wrestling became\n  World Championship Wrestling.\n\n  And KSL, you had to =\r\ngo insult WCW, the promotion that made me a fan. I\n  got into wrestling, wa=\r\ntching WCW with my dad in 93. They have the most\n  amazing star and have al=\r\nways been the better promotion. You say they\n  have no talent, well DDP and=\r\n Booker T. are the only extreamly good stars\n  they have now. But lets talk=\r\n about AOL/Time Warner WCW.\n  Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bret Hart, Chris Beno=\r\nit, Chris Jericho, Scott\n  Steiner, Rick Steiner, Arn Anderson, Ricky Steam=\r\nboat, Sting, Curt\n  Hening, Rey Masterio Jr., Billy Kidman, Road Warriors, =\r\nDusty Rhodes,\n  Hulk Hogan, and the greatest wrestler of all time, the Natu=\r\nre Boy Ric\n  Flair. Of course there are many I didn&#39;t mention.\n\n  Oh you do=\r\nnt know who Scott Steiner is, KSL? Well he signed with WWF and\n  should sho=\r\nw up in a few months. You should be amazed. He got the mic\n  skills, and as=\r\n far as physical shape goes, there is not one man in WWF,\n  WCW, or ECW tha=\r\nt can match up.\n\n   \n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
