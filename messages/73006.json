Yet the water simply follows the flow of hi=\r\ns arms rather than splashing on them.  And with the water came the compulsi=\r\non to transform into his beast form.   And then as warrior once again becam=\r\ne the dragon, he embraces the element of water and melds with its own natur=\r\nal forces and then, with his powerful tail, he strikes the wall, attempting=\r\n to finally break it to further weaken it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire may not have been his =\r\ntheme but he embraces something far more significant than simple flames.  T=\r\nhe element of Thunder, and lightning and the raging torrent of rain water t=\r\nhat follows the first clap of thunder.  He gives a draconic roar that sends=\r\n a thunderous boom toward the Sharkticon guards, and throughout the cavern.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; He can hear Yoketron&#39;s phrases as he carries forth and recites them t=\r\no his enemies.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Fire may be powerful and capable of massive damage, y=\r\net fire is not the most formidable element of nature.  For it has a weaknes=\r\ns, water.  And even more powerful than water, is the storm that spawns it. =\r\n Embrace the power of the storm, be at one with the tempest, and bring fort=\r\nh the light that follows darkness. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson&#39;s armor shimmers as the gl=\r\nint on each metallic scale flashes like lightning. He stands his ground and=\r\n begins moving his wings, kicking up a slight breeze in the cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I =\r\nam the storm, and I will not be easily stopped.  Your darkness will see lig=\r\nht, like it or not.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;su=\r\npercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson walks over to the w=\r\nall of debris, and examines it carefully.  By\n&gt; &gt; &gt; running a clawed finger=\r\n over it, he could tell how tightly packed it was.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Touch would serve =\r\nhim well, as he remembers training with just his hands,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ears and sens=\r\ne of smell to guide him.  And so he closes his eyes, going back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to th=\r\ne days of his training with Master Yoketron.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; The walls may se=\r\nem an impossible barrier, but the eyes can only perceive a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fraction o=\r\nf what is really in front of you.  Embrace your other senses, see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh your hands, ears, feet and nose, rather than with your eyes.  Feel what\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; must be felt and sense what must be sensed.  Yes Master Yoketron, I re=\r\nmember\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what you taught me. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He takes a slow step away fr=\r\nom the wall of debris.  Takes a few deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breaths. And with eyes compl=\r\netely shut, he puts his hands together as if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slipping into some form =\r\nof deep meditation.  Straight Shot looks to her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brother and then to L=\r\neo and the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Guys, step back, I&#39;ve seen this before, it=\r\n&#39;s a maneuver Master Yoketron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taught him and it&#39;s a doozy.  Gee I sur=\r\ne hope it works.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Quickstride and Rattrap move back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Okay, I definitely sense he&#39;s up ta something we haven&#39;t seen him do ye=\r\nt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With serene poise, and peaceful grace, Tucson begins with a=\r\n form of Tai Chi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that appears harmless to those who know nothing of =\r\nNinjabot training.  Yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if Magmatron knew of it, perhaps he may know =\r\nwhat would come next.  Ever so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gradually, Tucson begins to move faste=\r\nr and faster as feet seem to lift off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground before they even tou=\r\nch it, and then it comes.  He lifts his body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off the ground and spin =\r\nkicks the wall, with great force, attempting to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaken the wall.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;THOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TUSCON&#39;s hit was impressive! Great=\r\n fissures and cracks began to appear\n&gt; &gt; in the wall as almost immediately =\r\nwater began to burst out in small\n&gt; &gt; sections as actual breaks began to sp=\r\nray from the wall.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The wall was not broken yet, but it was definit=\r\nely weakening!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the same time MAGMATRON was distracted with his =\r\nown project and\n&gt; &gt; apparently had not noticed TUSCON, being that he was at=\r\n least a mile a\n&gt; &gt; way or more. However SABERBACK seemed to be aware, his =\r\noptics\n&gt; &gt; narrowing as he focused on them, even as he stood at the base of=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; flaming pillar of energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pointing in TUSCON&#39;s direction =\r\nSABERBACK was evidently giving orders\n&gt; &gt; as the SHARKTICON guards turned t=\r\no look at TUSCON and the other\n&gt; &gt; PREDACONS and MAXIMALS.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More SH=\r\nARKTICONS stepped into view as well. in the end there were\n&gt; &gt; twenty one S=\r\nHARKTICONS, each of them transforming into their shark\n&gt; &gt; mode and began t=\r\no fly in the direction of TUSCON and the others with\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Loo=\r\nk!&quot; TORCA said as he pointed back at the energy pillar or fire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom another opening another familiar figure could be seen exiting,\n&gt; &gt; his i=\r\ndentity obvious to them all, even if he was a mile away: DARK\n&gt; &gt; RODIMUS a=\r\nnd he was carrying NIGHTLIGHT in his arms!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;There is more!&quot; BIG CO=\r\nNVOY said as looked as well, his fists tightly\n&gt; &gt; clencehd in anger.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Behind DARK RODIMUS were other SHARKTICON guards, two of them also\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncarrying what appeared to be two other MAXIMALS: STAMPY and SHARPEDGE,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nneither of whom were moving.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; MAGMATRON smiled as OPTIMUS PRIME beg=\r\nan to scream again, the sound of\n&gt; &gt; his agony echoing throught the cavern.=\r\n However the cry was\n&gt; &gt; signifigantly weaker than before.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Weaker =\r\nand growing weaker with each passing moment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Pres=\r\nton\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
