I&#39;ll rip his core-processor out for this!!!&quot;\n\n* Carnage snarled as she pulled her head back up and sighed, clone or not it \nstill deserved a chance to live!\nShe looked back and stared right into one of Rage&#39;s blood red eyes, BINGO!\nCarnage leaped and drove her hind claws towards the unprotected eye, she \ncould have thrown up at the disgusting sound it made when she finally came \ninto contact with it!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
