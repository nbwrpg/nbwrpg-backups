He gave some orders.\n\n&quot;Ignatius, take that bot inside and repair him. We&#39;ve got big plans.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are we going to do boss? Give him the chip?&quot;\n\n&quot;Only if absolutly neccesary. I&#39;d rather have more fun torturing him \nfor information. And have his girl Spears&#39; here administer it. That \nwould surely crush his spirit. And don&#39;t forget to remove all \nweapons, and deactivate his jet pack. I don&#39;t want any surprises.&quot;\n\n&quot;You got it!&quot;\n\nIgnatius enters the base with Striker. The others also go in, back to \ntheir stations. Prebon gets off Savage and looks at Spears.\n\n&quot;Come. Let me show you to your room. Savage, you can go wander the \nforest, but be ready for my call.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
