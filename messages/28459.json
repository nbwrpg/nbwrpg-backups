Bleating \nlouder \n&gt; because she couldm&#39;t move forward anymore and the ash made a small \nhill \n&gt; behind her when she tried to back up.\n&gt; She was stuck there and ash was starting to fall from the tree and \nto her \n&gt; nose and she was too young to know how to sneeze it off.\n&gt; Being a little tiny fox pup, it was hard to tell that she was a red \nnow \n&gt; because of all the soot in her fur.\n&gt; And she kept whining while she struggled to move her body to try \nand get \n&gt; away from the trunk but she just didn&#39;t have enough controle over \nthe \n&gt; muscles to do anything.\n&gt; So she kept trying and failing until her feet suddeny left the \nground after \n&gt; some weird sound. (when Starice talked picked her up)Her tiny paws \nmoving in \n&gt; uncontroled spasms to try and get something solid under them.\n&gt; But it was only seconds before she could feel warmth (Starice&#39;s \narms) and \n&gt; her yipping gota bit softer before she snuggled into them, trying \nto find a \n&gt; place to suckle like she would with her mother.\n&gt; Her nose was covered in ash so she couldn&#39;t tell if this warm thing \nwas \n&gt; mommy, so her brain just remembered the warmth and the thought of \nmilk and \n&gt; to suckle went right along with it.\n&gt; So she opened her tiny mouth and tried to suckle but there wasn&#39;t \nanything \n&gt; to suckle from. It was just flat, so she moved in jerky little \nspasms to try \n&gt; and see if there was a teet somewhere else that she missed.\n&gt; But there was nothing and she whined, her tummy feeling hunger \npains.\n&gt; In Starice&#39;s arms she lifted her head up a bit and yupped, making \nthe \n&gt; faintest barks and then moving her head down against to bump her \nnose \n&gt; against her arm but only because she couldn&#39;t see and was confused \nbecause \n&gt; there was warmth and no milk to go with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
