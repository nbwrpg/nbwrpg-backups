He flew into the battlefield, nearly \nkilled Ramulus, made a big mess of the ground with a dozen or so \nmissiles, killed a Maximal warrior, called himself Slayer, and flew \noff with the rest of the Trainers. Other than that, I&#39;m as clueless \nas you guys.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Spears::\n&gt; She looked at Smokescreen.

I don&#39;t remember \nanything \n&gt; after fighting them just outside the ark.&quot; She watched as Firearm \n&gt; walked in carrying another bot and watches as he puts the bot in \nthe \n&gt; CR chamber. Then it hit her as to what he said about Striker. Her \n&gt; spark jumped. She didn&#39;t want to lose him. &quot;What about Striker? \n&gt; What&#39;s happened? He&#39;s been reprogrammed? How? When did that \nhappen?&quot; \n&gt; She sat down in the chair next to the chamber with a look of shock \non \n&gt; her face.
