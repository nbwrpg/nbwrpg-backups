First a black frame of a \nring,\n&gt; followed by the mat and canvas. Then black pads on the floor, and \nblack\n&gt; World Wrestling Federation ring aprons. Then two black steel steps\n&gt; appeared in opposite cornors. Then black WWF turnbuckle pads. And\n&gt; finally red ring ropes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Rod then turns back to the others.\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s all setup. We can go whenever your ready, the holodeck is the \nbest\n&gt; place for this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sorry, if I did too much in this post. I just wanted to get \nthings\n&gt; moving.\n\n\n"}}
