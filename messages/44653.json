He bursts through the clouds, and \nspirals downward toward the midrange cruiser.\n\nHe opens a commlink to the Dark Avian, &quot;Dark Avian, Astrotrain here. \nI&#39;ve arrived with Megatron and Spasstik. Preparing to land in 30 \nseconds.&quot; He takes a wide berth, and comes back around slowly to \ngive himself a sort of landing pad. As he approaches the ground, he \ntransforms into train mode, and skids to a halt, leaving a nice \ngrove along the landscape of the island.\n\nThe large train&#39;s side pannel folds downward into a ramp, and he \nawaits the exit of his passengers.\n\n\n"}}
