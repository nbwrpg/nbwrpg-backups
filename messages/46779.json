One of the pack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; members, one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that had strayed from the others, moved towards the opening \nof a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; small cave. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Caution written in every movement, it sniffed carefully at an \n&gt; &gt; item \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t have been there...a status pod. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A bright light emerged, scanning for a beast form. As the \nwolf \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanned, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it yelped and jumped away. Away from that and the strange, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer-ish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voice. &quot;Error...error..&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The pod opened as the wolf backed farther from it, ears back \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; growling. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small wolf emerged, eyes blue as crystal. Her fur matched \nthat \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the wolf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before her, many shades of grey blended together into one \ncoat. \n&gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wolf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before her looked curious, moving a bit closer and sniffing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; again...but this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other wolf didn&#39;t quite smell right. Still, this wolf was \nbetter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; company at all. Not to mention this territory was his, and if \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; female \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wished to stay, she would be a part of HIS pack. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She turned to him, eyes narrowed. Wings opened...bat wings. \nShe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; snarled, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revealing fangs longer than the other wolf have seen before. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wolf backed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away again, tail low...then turned and ran. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bat-wolf smirked, wings settling against her back. The \nother \n&gt; &gt; &gt; side was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; covered in fur as well, making them nearly invisable to the \neye. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Looking back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and forth, trying to make sense of where exactly she \nwas...and \n&gt; &gt; who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her name she remembered...but...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mistra...&quot; she said softly aloud, confirming with herself. \nYes, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that was her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name. She remembered that much. But...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predicons...Maximals...which side was she on...?\n\n\n"}}
