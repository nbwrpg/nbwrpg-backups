I mean hell, Cybertronians were &quot;acting like Humans&quot; four million \nyears before 1984.  They were more afriad of the Humans because they were \nunpredictable, probably because the Quints didn&#39;t have any info on &#39;em.  Or \njust bad writing.\n\nI agree with the Cybertron-Earth relations.  But again, kinda bad writing \nsince it left a major player out of it.  Good job Bob Skir.  It wouldn&#39;t be a \nproblem in BW really since it was a Cybertronian crew lost and the Maximal \ngovernment didn&#39;t know about the whole Past Earth thing, only the Tripredacus \nCouncil did.)\n\n"}}
