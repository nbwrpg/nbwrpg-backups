The distant sound of someone or something =\r\nplaying hard on an \n  electric guitar or two.\n\n  The Predacon turned anothe=\r\nr corner, a dead end.  He looked around, the once \n  faint sound getting lo=\r\nuder and louder.  Full of fear, he began pounding on \n  the wall that block=\r\ned his path.  A stronger robot might&#39;ve been able to smash \n  his way throu=\r\ngh and continue on.  Or a robot with a jetpack or boosters \n  would&#39;ve been=\r\n able to fly to safety.  But this Predacon had none of those.\n\n  He reached=\r\n into subspace, taking out his laser rifle and turning around, \n  activatin=\r\ng his comm. unit.  &quot;This is Alabastor!  All Defcons get over here!  \n  They=\r\n&#39;re after me!  Hurry the slag up!&quot; he screamed into his shoulder comm. \n  u=\r\nnit to his other gang members but got no reply.  He raised his pistol as he=\r\n \n  saw something move and fired off a single bolt, the superheated laser d=\r\nigging \n  into the wall and leaving a small burned dent.\n\n  He focused, on =\r\nrealized it was nothing.  Just his imagination, but he was \n  still frantic=\r\n.  &quot;I&#39;m dead...I&#39;m dead...&quot; he said looking around, formulating \n  a quick =\r\nscheme.  He put away his rifle and took out his energon knife, \n  climbing =\r\nup on a couple stacked boxes and leaping, stabbing his blade into \n  the wa=\r\nll.  It worked, as he was hanging on by the blade a few feet off the \n  gro=\r\nund.  \n\n  He reached his free arm up as far as it would go, pulling himself=\r\n slowly when \n  suddenly a sound that reminded him of laser rang out and a =\r\nburning sensation \n  suddenly started in his back.  Alabastor lost his grip=\r\n and fell in pain, \n  slamming to the ground.\n\n  He shook his head, slowly =\r\ngetting to his feet, as painful as it was with the \n  wound in his back, th=\r\ne electric guitar riffs over.  He looked around, \n  spotting three robots. =\r\n \n\n  &quot;You bastards...&quot;\n\n  &quot;Shut up, Alabastor.
