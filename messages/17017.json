I will not tolerate this! You are going to get along, or I \n&gt; will put you both in the brig! Now, to the plan. Everyone, here.&quot;\n&gt; Prebon handed everyone except Spears a small circular device. The \n&gt; Trainers pt it on.\n&gt; &quot;This is a cloaking device. It will mask your signature. Now, I \nwill \n&gt; have Spears tied up and with me. My Trainers plus Savage will be \nfar \n&gt; in the back, listening to what takes place. They will come forward \n&gt; just incase Ramulus brought back up. Slayer, you will be up on a \n&gt; ledge, scoping at Ramulus. As soon as you get a decent shot, kill \n&gt; him. Now let&#39;s move out!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon and The Trainers left the base. Prebon called for Savage, \nand \n&gt; when he came put a cloaking device on his skin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All of you can get on him. Remember to activate them when we get \n&gt; closer to the area.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
