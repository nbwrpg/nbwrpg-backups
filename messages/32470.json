Cruelty to animals wasn&#39;t a good \nthing to watch, but some people still did it.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s ok,&quot; she replied to Vlad. She wanted to know more about this place, \nthough, so she guessed that finding out this robot&#39;s name would be a good \nidea. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Antagony asked curiously in a polite tone. She \nwondered if this bot was friendly or not.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
