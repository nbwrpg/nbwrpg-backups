A new poll has been created for the\n&gt; nbwrpg group:\n&gt;\n&gt; What would yall do if I had posted this\n&gt; right after Jet V and Artemis arrive in\n&gt; the ship. Is this a good entrance for\n&gt; the Technobots.\n&gt;\n&gt; Computron walks in. He begins to\n&gt; speak. &quot;Datem: You are wearing autobot\n&gt; symbols. Datem: You are in a clasified\n&gt; autobot area. Datem: The computer\n&gt; recognizes you. Datem: I have met all\n&gt; of you before. Datem: You both look\n&gt; fun. Datem: You speak kindly. Datem: I\n&gt; know you both quite well. Conclusion:\n&gt; you are Decepticons. You must die.\n&gt; Method: Acid Pellet blasts, ten fold.&quot;\n&gt; Computron holds out his two massive\n&gt; guns, and aims them at Jet V and\n&gt; Artemis. He pulls the trigger 276\n&gt; times, and kill Jet V and Artemis, in a\n&gt; pool of hot and disgusting\n&gt; slag. &quot;Datem: Death was quick. Datem:\n&gt; Usage of all ammo. Datem: They did not\n&gt; put up a fight. Conclusion: 95% chance\n&gt; I was wrong. I just killed two\n&gt; comerades. Conclusion: Rearm myself,\n&gt; point guns at my head, pull the\n&gt; trigger. Result: 98.76555555% chance it\n&gt; will result in termination of\n&gt; Computron&quot; computron reloads his\n&gt; weapons, and points both at his head.\n&gt; He then pulls the trigger 276 times,\n&gt; resulting in total melt down. He dead.\n&gt;\n&gt;   o Rad, stick with it jer\n&gt;   o Jer, we are all dumber for reading that\n&gt;   o lets beat him with the stupid stick (although he dosent need it)\n&gt;   o Oh my god, I am quitting because of that\n&gt;   o you da man jer, you da man\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/polls\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message.
