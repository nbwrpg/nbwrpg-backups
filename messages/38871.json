He\ntransformed into his proud standing robot mode, his arms outstretched.\nHe then curled them in, and watched the seeker curl up. He turned\naround, to Beachcomber transforming. &quot;Well I guess we wait.&quot; Firedrill\nsaid curiously, as he nelt down, using his arm to support the rest of\nhis body in a crouching position, as he gently investigated an old\nburrow for some type of animal.\n\nBeachcomber, now in robot mode as well, moved forward, a blue sheet of\nmetal slipping over his optics. It began to whirl to life, at the use of\nenergy, as he examined the hole. He examined the size, shape of\nclawmarks, and type of feces, then began to match them up with a large\nlist of animal profiles he had in storage on his computer. &quot;Hmmmmmm.&quot; he\nsaid, truly interested in this mission. &quot;I would guess a type of badger,\nalthough I am not sure which one with the current information.&quot; he said\nhappily.\n\nFiredrill looked up with curiousity, and in his gruff but soft voice\nasked in bewilderment, &quot;B, Badger?&quot;.\n\nBeachcomber remembered that Firedrill had never been to earth, or any\nother planet for that fact. \n\n(feel free to jump in any time Klant)\n\n"}}
