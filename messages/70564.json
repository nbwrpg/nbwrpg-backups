He was determined to get through the crisis and find Ro=\r\ndimus.  His heart had shown him the way, and there was nothing anyone could=\r\n do to stop him.  With Vestige in his cab, he keeps careful watch over his =\r\nnewly found old friend, and secures him with a saftey belt around his shoul=\r\nders, to keep him safely in place on his seat.\n\n&quot;Hold on Vestige, the ride =\r\nmay get rough, but we will make it.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Presto=\r\nn Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rodimus, if ever=\r\n there were a time for courage and strength, it is now. You have within you=\r\n the power to relight the flame, and all you need do, is look deeper into y=\r\nour heart. There you will find it, a power that is perpetual, a power that =\r\nis unmatched by anything ever devised in the universe, and a one true power=\r\n that as Autobots, we share among each other. Be not afraid to delve into t=\r\nhis power, as I too am not afraid to do the same. My heart is here for you,=\r\n all you need to is reach for it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside Tucson&#39;s cab, a screen sh=\r\nows the image of a beating heart. As it beats further, the inside of the ca=\r\nb glows a brilliant silvery blue light. A light that eminates from his hear=\r\nt, and a light that can not be doused by the forces of evil.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; From beyond the insect creatures there is nothing but cold light\n&gt; eminat=\r\ning from the room behind them. They look like some mishappen\n&gt; shadow stret=\r\nching out like spindly legs as they scramble down the hall\n&gt; towards Tuscon=\r\n. The sound of their claws hitting the strange metaerial\n&gt; of the ground so=\r\nunding like stone on stone, the sound high pitched and\n&gt; grating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even=\r\n as they approach the inccessant humming that had been heard has\n&gt; gotten l=\r\nouder as several blue and white winged insects approach from\n&gt; behind Tusco=\r\nn and they also make their way up the long hall seeking to\n&gt; box him in. Th=\r\ne waiting hungry claws of the red-white and yellow\n&gt; spider like insects to=\r\n the front and the blue and white ones flying up\n&gt; at the rear, thier sting=\r\ners ready to poison and rend, Tuscon in the\n&gt; middle, fodder for thier taki=\r\nng!\n&gt; \n&gt; However at the last moment a searing flame errupted seemingly ever=\r\nywhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; One moment it was dark, only the light from the door way showi=\r\nng in\n&gt; the hall. The next flames burst from no where, catching the insects=\r\n,\n&gt; melting thier armor, searing internals. When the flames dissipate\n&gt; the=\r\nre was nothing but charred remains.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon . . . &quot; a voice whispered =\r\n&quot;hurry . . . &quot; It was Vestige\n&gt; talking from inside Tuscon&#39;s cab, but he so=\r\nunded like Rodimus his\n&gt; voice weak and small. &quot;I can&#39;t hold this for too m=\r\nuch longer . . . &quot;\n&gt; He fell over again seemingly offline.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPreston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
