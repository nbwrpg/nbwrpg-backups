They are not easily melted and with the autoguns firing at\n&gt; Dracona, it would be very costly. What you said in your post is:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dracona knew of this, that&#39;s\n&gt; why she had HER base have autoguns as well, she retreated into her\n&gt; base and\n&gt; had her autoguns fire upon the base&#39;s autoguns...... &quot;Zardus, i&#39;m a\n&gt; genius,\n&gt; i came prepared for this!....lets just work this out!...&quot; Dracona\n&gt; said.....\n&gt;\n&gt; It has nothing about melting walls or sabotauging autoguns. As it is\n&gt; stated, this post is impossible because the door was closed in the\n&gt; first\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/10/_/_/_/958070568/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
