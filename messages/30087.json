She hoped to \nget the DNA samples requested of her.\n\nWhile hovering about 15 feet above the ground, the cruisers engines start to \ngive out. &quot;Oh no. Not good. This isn&#39;t purrrrfect timing here. You lousy \nbucket of bolts, keep going.&quot;  The craft stopped and went crashing into the \nground.  Feline got out of the pilot&#39;s seat and got out of the cruiser. She \nkicked it with her foot and looked around. &quot;TO THE PIT!!!!&quot;  She transformed \ninto leopard mode and went sprinting along.  She hoped that no one would \nfind the cruiser untill she was well out of scanner range.  But if her luck \nwas this bad to begin with, then she had no reason to think things would get \nany smoother.\n\n------------------------------\n&gt;The Iron Fist is on Alliance island (where Feline is, too). There\n&gt;arn&#39;t any lakes or animals there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Feline::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She stopped by a small lake to get a drink.  She had the DNA\n&gt;collector on\n&gt; &gt; her side, just in case.  She spotted three animals and transformed\n&gt;into\n&gt; &gt; leopard mode.  She ran and caught two of them.  Grabbing the DNA\n&gt;collector,\n&gt; &gt; she retrieved the samples as ordered and went back to her\n&gt;bike. &quot;Hmmm, I\n&gt; &gt; wonder what the commander had in store for these samples. I will\n&gt;have to\n&gt; &gt; find out when I return. I wonder what advantages I will descover\n&gt;when I\n&gt; &gt; return.&quot; she said purring to herself.  She continued on her way to\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; IronFist.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
