Releasing a few captives would be alright...but she knew \nfrom experience that the Maximals were hard to stop once the rage of battle \ntook them.\nShe sighed and straightened herself out, opening her comm-link.*\n\n&quot; Dark One...I have to say that...the proposition is very...tempting.&quot;\n\n* She was out of breath and tired, sweating in her suit.\nIron Raptor swollowed and lowered her helm, looking out over the field as \nthe battle continued.*\n\n&quot; But I need to meet face to face with Zardus about this...while we BOTH \ngive the word to stop the fighting. You know my location, tell him, I&#39;ll be \nwaiting.&quot;\n\n* She then shut off the transmission to Dark One and opened one to all \nMaximal codes, wondering if they were going to listen to her or will it be a \nreapeat of that one time when she had to shout to Oblitertron to shoot at \nher instead.\nIt had to be worth the risk.*\n\n&quot; Maximals!! Chordat&#39;s being held by the Alliance and they&#39;ve said that they \nwould release him if we relaeased their troops that are in our ship and let \nthem leave without firing on them.\nI want you ALL to cease fire on any enemy and converge on my position, if we \nwant our Maximal back alive you&#39;ll do this for him. I don&#39;t want his life \nhanging on your shoulders just because a few of us might be trigger happy.&quot;\n\n* She kept her comm open as she waited, to all codes. Both Maximal and \nenemy, hoping that the Maximals would listen, and if they didn&#39;t then she \nwould have to do something about it.\nIron Raptor looked at her sword, a light show might do, but not to hurt \nanyone, just to get them shocked into listening, if it became that bad.\nMaybe another stream of light except into the cloude, create some thunder.\nJust something.\nBut she hoped that she wouldn&#39;t have to drain her energy to go that.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
