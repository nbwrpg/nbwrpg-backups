Some of it was caved in and there was debris\nabout, and the cage walls were still up.\n\n&quot;Perhaps you can dig around that wall.&quot; RODIMUS PRIMAL said as he\nlooked at the two cage walls that had trapped NIGHTSHIFT before and\nthen back at the opening they had just come through, obviously being\ncautious. &quot;I don&#39;t want to knock that wall down, it might bring the\ncave down on top of us.&quot;\n\nHe looked past the cage walls to the other side. &quot;But perhaps there is\nsomething we can find on the other side.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
