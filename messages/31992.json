He looked down to his chest, \nwhich was covered with small dents.  &quot;You&#39;ll pay for that!&quot; he yelled, \ngetting ready to charge, but saw two missiles heading for the Oblitercon who \nhad opened fire on him and he jumped to avoid the resulting explosion.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw felt small explosions on his frame, the grenades doing little \ndamage.  He armed his launchers, firing two missiles at Breakdown and two \nmissiles at the Cybertronian Fire, autogun fire striking already damaged \nareas all over his frame.\n\n---\n\n\nSlowly getting up, Dark One barely jumped out of the way of the ion disks, \nlanding on his right side hard.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown let out a yell as missiles struck him in the back, nearly sending \nhim flipping forward.  Turning around, mech-fluid leaking down his back, he \nraised his greande launcher, but realized Injector was to far away.  So he \nfired three optic blasts at his opponent.\n\n---\n\nPyro slowed down, no one pursuing him.  He raised his cannon, firing off \nthree fireballs at Vehement.\n\n---\n\nHiss remained silent, still hurting badly.\n\n---\n\nScavenger was struck by a missile, sending him flipping through the air, the \ninside of vehicle mode badly burnt and smashed up.  Scavenger&#39;s scanners \ncould make out Hiss going through the air quickly in the opposite direciton.\n\n---\n\nHot Spot saw the five images of Headstrong and fired two fireballs, one at \ntwo different of them, and jumped out of the way of one of the light blasts, \nthe other burning a large hole in his chest that leaked mech-fluid.\n\n---\n\nGroove got up slowly, firing two photon blasts at Sinnertwin&#39;s torso.\n\n---\n\nBlades felt weapons fire blowing into his armor, knocking him back through \nthe air against his engines.  The apache whined as it turned, arming \nmissiles.  Two missiles launched out at Shockwave.  &quot;You&#39;re Emperor of \nnothing!&quot;\n\n---\n\nFirst Aid slowly got up, looking at the Autobot who had saved him.  &quot;Thanks.  \nWho are you?&quot; he asked, a little flummoxed.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise ran forward, raising his pistol and firing off three photon blasts \nat Reflector&#39;s sternum.  &quot;Take that you Decepticreep wanna be!&quot;\n\n---\n\nImprisoner activated the laser cannon attached to his frame, the large cannon \nfiring off three powerful laser blasts at the CF were heading straight for \nthe damaged ship.\n\n---\n\nPredator dodged some autogun fire from the Element.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to do \nbetter than that.&quot; he chuckled, raising the rocket launcher on his shoulder \nand firing off a missile straight at the CF.\n\n---\n\nChoran had finished with his modifications and took aim.  He held the trigger \ndown for a few seconds, twenty-two laser bolts blasting out at Prowl&#39;s torso.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer raised his rifle, firing off twenty-five rapid laser bolts \nat one of Headstrong&#39;s hollow images.\n\n---\n\nScattershot took aim, firing off ten armor-piercing rounds at Divebomb. (If \nhe&#39;s still at the battle).\n\n---\n\nShockwave spinned in the air, the two missiles from Blades passing by \nharmlessly and exploding.  Shockwave got a lock and fired off ten rapid laser \nblasts at Blades.\n\n&quot;I am a Decepticon Emperor you moronic Autobot.  Your resistance will only \ndrain resources.&quot;\n\n---\n\nTwo flares launched on at the last minute on an intercept course with the \nincoming missiles, the explosions burning Unitron&#39;s frame slight.  Arming his \nmissiles once more he fired off two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, ten \nrapid laser blasts lancing out from his nosecone at Zardus.\n\n&quot;Prepare to die, traitor.&quot;\n\n---\n\nFirestarter barrel rolled, avoiding three charges, the other blowing a gash \ninto his armored space fighter form.  Those were hits he couldn&#39;t take.  \nArming his missile launchers he fired off two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles at Zardus from his left launcher and fired off twenty-three rapid \nlaser blasts at the Cybertronian Fire from his nosecone.\n\n&quot;Puny Maximals, you are more pathetic than your anscestors, the Autobots.&quot;\n\n---\n\nBeeline the lifeless cyber-bee fired two optic blasts on an intercept course \nwith the charges heading for Double Punch.\n\nDouble Punch looked at the explosions in the air and laughed, raising both \npinchers and launching a total of two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire from \nhis left pincher.\n\nHe broke into a run, getting a target lock and firing two energy-signature \nseeking missiles at Cliffjumper.\n\n(By the way, DP is cloaked)\n\n---\n\nManterror pulled hard left through the air, barely avoiding the charges from \nthe CF and the explosion of the charges sent a light coating of fire over his \ngreen body, dimming it.\n\n&quot;ARGH!  NOTHING CAN DEFEAT THE MANTERROR!&quot; he screamed, raising both arms and \nfiring off four ion disks at the Cybertronian Fire, two from both arms.\n\n---\n\nInjector raised his right arm, two stinger missiles heading for the \nCybertronian Fire.  Almost seemingly out of nowhere, optic blasts struck \nInjector, knocking him back through the air.  Though only a few seconds later \nInjector was stabalized.  &quot;Who dares attack me?&quot; he said, focusing on \nBreakdown.  &quot;Ah, the mercenary.  A gun for hire is no match for Injector of \nthe Neo Decepticon Empire!&quot; he yelled, heading downward at top speed for \nBreakdown, the air resistance (that Yan was WRONG about) put pain on the \nwound in his sternum that was leaking a tiny bit of oil from exposed \ncircuitry.\n\nHe raised his left arm, firing two stinger missiles down at the Oblitercon \nBreakdown.\n\n---\n\nSmokescreen exited the Cybertronian Fire, looking to Vehement immediately.  \nHe raised his heavy-laser rifle, charging the Brotherhood member who as \nrather far away.\n\n&quot;What I failed to do shall be righted, in Primus&#39; name I swear.&quot; he said, \nwhile raising his rifle and taking aim at Vehement.  He cocked his rifle, the \nonly thing he was waiting for was to be in range to open fire.\n\n---\n\nVehement didn&#39;t notice Smokescreen.  Fire balls from the pyromaniac Pyro had \nstruck Vehement almost harmlessly, the charred armor invisible since the \nnormal color of his armor was a deep black.\n\n&quot;You make your greatest mistake, Alliance trash.&quot; he said loud enough for \nPyro to hear.  He raised his right arm, a barrel at the end of it.  Two \nenergy-signature seeking missiles launched out at Pyro.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher saw six shapes heading for him.  Raising his left arm he launched \na single missile that he had explode prematurely.  Two charges were still \ninbound and Sun Crusher only now attempted to move out of the way, one charge \nblowing up against his left abs, creating a dent in his side that was rather \npainful.\n\nBut due to his training with the Brotherhood, he was able to hide his pain \nfrom others.  And pain he was in, though it was starting to subside.  \n&quot;Prepare for death!&quot; he yelled, raising his right arm and firing off two \nmissiles at the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nReflector looked didn&#39;t know who Streetwise was talking to or that he had \nshot at him, but the Brotherhood member knew he had indeed been shot at when \ntwo photon blasts struck him in the chest, sending him backwards two and a \nhalf feet, the robot quickly regaining stabalization in the air.\n\n&quot;Heathens.  You think you can stop those in the righteous path?  When the \nChaos-Bringer comes you shall feel the wrath of the righteous one and his \nfollowers.&quot; He raised both arms, launching two missiles from both barrels on \neach arm.\n\nFour missiles launched from his left arm at the Cybertronian Fire.  The other \narm sent two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire and two energy-signature \nseeking missiles at an idle robot.  First Aid.\n\n\n\n"}}
