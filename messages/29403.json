This is a Beast Wars RPG, not Buffy\n&gt; or something, and it will stay a Beast Wars RPG. Soulstice and Benny\n&gt; Hillo, I&#39;d appreciate it if you forgot about the mystical stuff and\n&gt; RPed robots, not gods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, all the damage dodging and ignoring in this battle at the\n&gt; Chivtron base is getting waay too much. Start posting damage properly\n&gt; from now on please. Energon does hurt all bots, unless they are in\n&gt; beast mode, so you guys might wanna start posting for that. No bots\n&gt; are being built by God or the devil in this RPG, so lets not start\n&gt; RPing that way. Thanx.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
