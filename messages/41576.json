He&#39;s in a meeting, but I&#39;m his clone, persay.&quot;\n\nAs he says that, his comm retrieves the the message that the Iron Fist had intercepted, reading over it. It was interesting, though he didn&#39;t know who the bot was. He forms a transmission, and sends it to where the message originated from, with no outside activity to indicate that he was doing anything but waiting for Halucigen&#39;s reply.\n\nThe transmission reads: &quot;This is Zardus. I have recieved your transmission, and am awaiting further contact from you. I&#39;m sure that when you are complete, we can work well together.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Halucigen was surpirsed.  &quot;How does he know I want to kill the \n&gt; Destrons.&quot; he thought to himself, where no other could possibly \n&gt; hear him.  Then opening a comm link to this Dark One he said \n&gt; &quot;Yea, sure , umm, great one, I&#39;ll be there in a jiffy. &quot;  \n&gt; However he did not move as he waited for FZ.\n\n\n"}}
