His large legs try to grab the central femm as he tries to stab his mouthpiece into her. (Note: Mosquitor&#39;s mouthpiece deploys thorns when it stabs in, so if its in, it don&#39;t come out easy).\n\nHearing Mosquitor attack, Zardus jumps out from behind his plate, firing a missile at one of the femms that Mosquitor didn&#39;t get. He didn&#39;t care if Mosquitor was hit by friendly fire.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Aelo/Celeno/Ocipite::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well sisters&quot; said Aelo &quot;It&#39;s time to work, and forget that stupid \n&gt; things&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The femmes came in the room and started to look around.\n\n\n"}}
