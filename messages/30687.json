Perhaps she hadn&#39;t lost her touch yet. \n&gt; &quot;I was getting the DNA samples, then got bit by a strange spider.  \n&gt; Shortly there after, my skin fell off my frame. So, here I am, no \n&gt; real beast mode and peltless. Just look at me, look at me, I&#39;m, uh, \n&gt; well,&quot; she said, feeling her face flush into a red,&quot;I&#39;m without a \n&gt; pelt to cover my frame. It&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s....&quot;  she couldn&#39;t bring \n&gt; herself to finish that thought.\n\n\n"}}
