His armor, even\nin the bright lights of the security chamber, still somehow maintained\nit&#39;s stark black on gray motif, stylized flames dancing across his\nchest.\n\nHe glanced over at one of the screens, the one that was displaying the\nactivity outside with Tuscon and the other Autobot rabble standing\nthere as if expecting them to open the base up and let them in.\nRodimus chuckled softly for a moment, earning him a brief glance from\nCyclonus. Rodimus was about to say something when Hydras&#39; voice cut in\n. . .\n\n&gt; &quot;We are under attack!!!!! We must to capture Nightshift, pronto!!!! Scourge and Cyclonus active the inner and exterior defenses... If the Autobot leaves the base we will be forced to go to a fight&quot;\n\nCyclonus tilted his head curiously as he, and Rodimus for that matter,\nlooked at the screen that displayed the screen in the throne room and\nthe mayhem that was going on.\n\n&quot;Sir!?&quot; Cyclonus sent to Hydras, &quot;The base has been submerged\nunderneath the magma and I am activating the interior defenses.&quot;\n\nEven as Cyclonus talked, a private message came to Rodimus from Hydras . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;cover the reseach lab, if the autobot ran towards it, intercept him&quot;\n\nRodimus acknowledged Hydras&#39; message as he glanced up at Cyclonus. He\nhadn&#39;t appeared to notice the message that Hydras sent. &quot;I have some\nthings to attend to.&quot; Rodimus said, his voice calm and yet still that\nundercurrent of aggression was still in it. &quot;I&#39;ll be back.&quot;\n\nWithout another word Rodimus left the room, on his way to the research\nlab . . . and Nightlight.\n\nCyclonus nodded as Rodimus left and then turned back to his consoles\nand screens, another lit up beside him as he activated it, this one\nwatching Rodimus. Cyclonus had indeed been aware of the communication\nRodimus had received, and he watched his progress with keen interest,\neven as he kept an optic on the other events.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
