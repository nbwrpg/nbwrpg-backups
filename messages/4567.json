And in good health it seems,&quot; Zardus \nlooks at the Protoform 5. He didn&#39;t bother introducing himself or saying \nwhere Delta was. He had programed all that into the bots memory while \nrebuilding him. Zardus turns to Nemesis.\n\n&quot;Nemesis, meet Protoform 5, alias Delta,&quot; he says and turns back to Delta, \n&quot;Delta, meet Nemesis Enforcer. If I am unavailable, you will follow his \norders.&quot;\n\nSuddenly, Zardus&#39; wrist comp beeps, reporting Hell Beast&#39;s message. Zardus \ngrowls. It would probably be to his advantage to sit tight untill later. He \nactivates his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Hell Beast,&quot; he says into it, sending the message to the predacon commander, \n&quot;I am having some ... internal trouble right now. I will send help as soon as \nI can.&quot;\n\nWith that, Zardus turns around, deactivating his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Meet me back at the bridge,&quot; he says to the two bots in the room and walks \nout, heading for the bridge.\n\n"}}
