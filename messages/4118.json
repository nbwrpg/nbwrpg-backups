Let me change my last post than. \nBattera, you don&#39;t have to respond back, I&#39;ll take your original \nmessage. Sorry again.)\n\n\n*Before Baterra&#39;s message*\n\nVulois looked down at the Predacon stalking him. Maybe this one could \nbe good to join his group. She looks good at sneaking and spying. And \nmaybe she knows how to use this mind whiping device. If it&#39;s meant \nfor someone I can use them.\n\n&quot;Hey Batgirl! How would you like new purpose in life? How would you \nlike to join me?&quot;\n\n*After Battera&#39;s message*\n\nVulois answers back.\n\n&quot;Who am I? Well, I can&#39;t tell you that until you agree to join me. \nWhat&#39;s in it for you? How would you like to win the Neo Beast Wars \nand than go back to Cybertron to rule?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
