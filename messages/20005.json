She saw \nnothing for\n&gt; the Alliance but destruction and knew that there was no way she&#39;d \nlet her\n&gt; fathers dream be distorted by the likes of them. She had the \nprintouts from\n&gt; the CR chambers, and her father had the skill to recreate the DNA \npatterns\n&gt; he needed. There wasn&#39;t a reason to stay other than to watch the \nfight. It\n&gt; was the perfect chance to escape, unfortunately Squizzy knew to \nmuch about\n&gt; her experiments to be left behind. She couldn&#39;t leave the mongoose \nbehind\n&gt; while it was still functioning. something had to be done soon and \nshe had to\n&gt; decide what it was.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 03, 2000 4:22 PM\n&gt; Subject: Defending the Allience\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy&gt; Starts firing heavy duty tranquilizer darts randomly at \nthe\n&gt; attacking\n&gt; &gt; bots who were close to the base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
