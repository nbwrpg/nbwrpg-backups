She had been trapped in a quintesson trap for sometime. Only \nnow it had released her and she was free to go back to her friends. \nShe was after all, a fox pup.  She didn&#39;t have a care in the world \nexcept for telling her trainer BlackFang that she was OK and that she \nwanted to go back to training with him. He was her best friend as far \nas she was concerned. &quot;BLACKFANG!!! I&quot;M HOME!!! I&quot;M HOME!!!&quot;  She ran \nright up to the front doors of the maximal base and saw a bot laying \nthere at the doors. She didn&#39;t know what the matter was, but even in \nher young mind, she knew something was wrong. She opened up an \nemergency channel. It broadcast over all frequencies and the base \nintercom. &quot;HEY GUYS! It&#39;s me, Camoflage. I&#39;m home. And there is a bot \nhere in trouble out here. Hey guys, open up. I&#39;m hungry too.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
