But this was a practice battle, as intense as it was it \n&gt;was\n&gt;still just a test of skill.\n&gt;Dinobot roared...*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; You fight well, your skill surprises me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Usually his enemies would either have been running or dead by the time of\n&gt;his second blow but he was shocked at how Tavatron had held on.
