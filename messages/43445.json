I feel like mocking Recess the awesome cartoon, so any Recess \nfans will should look out and shout for the following post)\n\nNemesis Enforcer/Scatterblaster/The Oblitercons/Jaws:\n\n\n\n\nNemesis Enforcer sat upon his throne, or rather Zardus&#39; old one.  There had \nbeen an absence of the top two Alliance members, or rather three.  Zardus, \nWolfgang, and Future Zardus were nowhere to be found.  No one else had \noffered to lead the Alliance, so it was all Nemesis&#39; turn.  As it was \ndestined.\n\nPressing a few buttons on the armrest of the throne, he had opened a comlink \non all Alliance radio frequencies, all of them secure and hard, if not \nimpossible to crack.  Powerful satellites from the Iron Fist broadcasted \nNemesis&#39; new orders through Alliance domain and beyond.  From Alliance Island \noff the coast of Spain to the other side of the globe.\n\n&quot;This is Nemesis Enforcer.  Zardus, Future Zardus, and Wolfgang are nowhere \nto be found and therefore that leaves a window of opportunity for the next in \nline, me.  Some may be thinking &#39;Wait, I&#39;m more powerful, smart, and \nqualified than Nemeis.&#39; Well my friends, those people are morons and great \nwhomping bobula, will die if they mess with me.\n\nFirst order of business, revolt and in fighting in the Alliance will not be \ntolerated.  If anyone attempts to overthrow my regime, they will be executed \npainfully.  I have much of the Alliance systems hacked and under my control \nalone.  With the dispersment of the top three Alliance members  the Alliance \nranks are in chaos.&quot;\n\n&quot;Therefore, all Alliance remembers are now required to radio in with their \nnames, locations, and what they are currently doing.  Please be prompt.&quot;\n\n---\n\nOn the other side of the Alliance Island in the salt water, Jaws swam idly in \nhis great white shark mode, when receiving a transmission from the newly \nself-appointed leader of the Alliance.   He sent a response.  &quot;This is Jaws \noutside of the Alliance base.  I&#39;m patrolling waters, over.&quot;\n\n---\n\nInside the original Alliance base, the Oblitercons sat idly in the mess hall, \neach receiving the transmission.\n\n&quot;Dark One and the rest of the Oblitercons here in the Alliance base hanging \nout in the messhall.  What do you want?&quot;\n\n======\n\n&quot;Scatterblaster here, kicking butt in the IGL.  What the slag do you want?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
