She \ndoesn&#39;t notice Airbomber&#39;s approach, until several shots streak by \nher, she turns and tries to dodge out of the way, but gets hit twice, \nand it knocked down. She rolls as she lands, and ends up on her \nfeet, claws sheathed, and disk launcher out, with a charred dent on \nher leg and another on her right arm.

But then, he was\n&gt; slashed in the back and went down to his knees. Train Wreck, seeing\n&gt; this, aimed perfectly at Termitron and charged him in train mode,\n&gt; trying to run him over. Airbomber ran up and fired 8 quick\n&gt; semi-automatic shots at Lynxiz. Deemos fired 3 shots at Windlord and\n&gt; helped Stranato back up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Arrow charged through the base, trying to find Perplex.
