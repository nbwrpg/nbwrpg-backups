The overall winner of the IGL Regular \nDivision will receive five blank protoforms to be programmed into whatever \nthe winner wants.  One could be a tyronasarus, one could be a mailbox.  The \nprotoforms will be linked so they will form a gestalt team.\n\nNow, the victor of the IGL Gestalt Division will receive a large amount of \nenergon and spare parts.\n\nHow will this combat work?  Simple.  Same as ANY other fight in the NBW.  \nSomeone shoots, the person who being shot at responds, etc.  No special way.  \nNo popularity contests.  \n\nFor the Round One matches I will be making e-mails whose subjects are titled \nwith the combatants of each match.  IE: Vehement VS Unitron, Bongiovi VS \nGrunge, etc.  Do NOT deviate from those names.  If I make an e-mail heading \nfor Vehement VS Unitron and someone then makes an e-mail with the subject \nbeing &quot;IGL Battle&quot; and not the names of the combatants, I will end them.  By \nkeeping the names of each subject to those who are fighting it makes it \neasier for me to track.  SO DON&#39;T MESS WITH THE NAMES.\n\nThanks. \n\n-L. Unitron\n\n"}}
