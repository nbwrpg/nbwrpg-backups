He&#39;d continue to play \n&gt; the game a little longer, he might be able to use this to his \n&gt; advantage. Three bots chasing him meant three more samples for \n&gt; Veratis. If only Veratis believed in weaponry. He quickly scampered \n&gt; down the hall. A musky smell filled his nostrils. He figured it was \n&gt; the brig. He was playing right into thier hands. Or at least thats \n&gt; what he wanted them to think. KitKat was getting closer, he didn&#39;t \n&gt; have to look back to know that, he was staying a step ahead of her \n&gt; both mentally and physically.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
