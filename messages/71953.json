No sense in getting his wheels or internals gummed.  Getting good and c=\r\naked, as he moved along seeming just like another animal or bit of dirt bei=\r\nng blown in the wind.\n\nWhile Wheelie was not stealthed, he took care to min=\r\nimize his sensor profile and keep his scanners on passive, focusin gmainly =\r\non visual scanners.\n\nWhile Wheelie may not be used to ancient earth, nor fu=\r\nlly acclimated with it to any degree, what he was was a Survivor.\n\nThe seem=\r\ningly but not Young Autobot had spent over a hundred and twenty thousand vo=\r\nrn, over ten million years in the prison planet Quintessa, surviving being =\r\nhunted by endless hordes of Sharkticons nad Alligatrons, the innumerable be=\r\nasts the Quintessons kept as slaves and guards.  Taking their parts to fix =\r\nhismnelf, stealing their fuel cores to keep himself repaired, using their w=\r\neapons for booby traps.\n\nOn earth, the wildlife would give any Cybertronian=\r\n pause.  And as for the Predacons..  Wheelie would wonder how they would do=\r\n up against a Sharkticon.\n\nWheelie did things his own way, having a stubbor=\r\nn streak and independent, loyal to his friends but seeing things through hi=\r\ns own twisted sense of logic and priorities.  His age equal to before the l=\r\nast war had began, the Autobot had learned to do things the hard way, and c=\r\nould keep his own paths to his form.\n\nAnd so, as he went to the firs tpatro=\r\nl zone he had been assigned, he slowed further, his body caked in mud, dirt=\r\n, and grime several inches thick, leaves and organic deritus on top making =\r\nhim near impossible to pick out on visuals, and his heat signature minimize=\r\nd on scanners as he went low to the ground, alert for Predacons, Decepticon=\r\ns, or booby traps ahead, passive sensors and the like.\n\nWhile he might not =\r\nknow what he was up against..  Neither did they.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
