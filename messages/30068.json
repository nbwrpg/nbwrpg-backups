For the first time in a long while Megatron\nfeels strong again. He clenches his fist tightly, a small aura of energy\nsurrounds it. &quot;I can feel the power, finally,&quot; he exlcaims.  He then looks\nup at Autofire, his eyes glow a deep red. &quot;You my friend will be a welcomed\ntroop to the Decepticon ranks, you show merciless, and that is a respected\ntrait in the Decepticons.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
