She sighed. There were \njsut the tree of them. She turned to Veratis.&quot;Uh, what will happen to \nthe bots that currently exist? I mean, will the maximals and \npredacons simply, er, go exstinct?&quot; She had left friends behind in \nthe maximal camps. She still had hopes of seeing them again, someday.\n\nShe looked down at her clips board and at her notes from the class. \nShe was hoping that Veratis wouldn&#39;t say what she thought he would \nsay. She kept her mind closed and waited to hear the answer.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis turned and hesitated for a moment before \nanswering, &quot;Whatever the\n&gt; matrix has in store for you is what happens.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine wasn&#39;t convinced, &quot;And what will happen to the bots that \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; change?&quot; he asked in a pessamistic tone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They will either join us and become what we are or perish in the\n&gt; transition. Veratis had the same determined look on his face like \nwhen he&#39;d\n&gt; told Lunarpine about the prophecy of Prime the first time.\n\n\n\n"}}
