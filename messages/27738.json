With that Motormaster\n&gt; sees the two missiles from Ratchet coming towards Wildrider. He transforms\n&gt; into his Semi mode, and pulls around so his trailor takes the missiles\n&gt; shots. Scratching his side &quot;lets do it&quot; Motormaster yells, and starts his\n&gt; engine and drives towards Triggerhappy. Wildrider jumps forward and\n&gt; transforms to car mode following Motormaster. Speedbreaker fire twice at\n&gt; Ratchet, (if he hits it wont cause damage, it will just screw up youre\n&gt; mechanics, like making youre gun not work or something, you can choose\nwhat\n&gt; it does if it hits.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Missile hits Beastbox who falls off Squawktalk with a hole in his\n&gt; chest. As he falls he looks around nervously. He lands on the ground hard.\n&gt; &quot;OWWWW, Beastbox make you pay for that. He leaps forward with quick speed\n&gt; and jumps towards Sideswipe, trying to land on him.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
