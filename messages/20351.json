It was obvious that Spears had cared \nfor Striker in some way.\n\n&quot;The device we used to disable the Trainer chip in you didn&#39;t work on \nStriker at all. He might have been reprogrammed, in which case they \nprobably cleared his memory. If that&#39;s true, there&#39;s not way to get \nhim back.&quot;\n\nHe pats her on the shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about what happened.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; She took his arm and stood up. Her was a little wobbly, but \n&gt; reasonably ok. She looked at Firearm with fear in her \neyes. &quot;Striker \n&gt; is...one of them...and no way to get him back?&quot;\n&gt; She looked at Firearm, but stared off into space. Her spark beat a \n&gt; million beats a second. &quot;He&#39;s...gone.&quot; she said in a shocked voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No..I can&#39;t believe it. I won&#39;t believe it.&quot;  Her love for him \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t give up on him yet. &quot;No, there has to be a way to save \nhim.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She shook her head trying to clear it. &quot;You said I was taken too, \nbut \n&gt; I&#39;m here now. Can we save him the same way you saved me?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
