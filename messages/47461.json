So what if you want to bring this \nchar back after the restart, and as such want him to live. It doesn&#39;t \nmatter whether the char is alive or dead at the end, because if \nyou&#39;re going to RP him after, it&#39;s a totally different character. You \nshouldn&#39;t be so concerned about losing your character, he&#39;s likely to \ntake a beating/get destroyed/run away before this is done.\n\nThings to note:\n-Missiles explode right? Then they should have an impact force, and \nthere is a strong possibility of Apocalypse being knocked out of the \nsky. \n-Also, if he&#39;s got a force field shield, then he&#39;s gotta be drawing \npower from somewhere, and his power isn&#39;t unlimited.\n\nNOTE: I&#39;m visiting relatives for a few days, and might/won&#39;t not be \nable to do much posting.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; Apocalypse puts up his force field blocking the shots.\n&gt; Apocalypse:Stay out of this you stupid pests!
