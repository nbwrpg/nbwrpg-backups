He called her a logical bot, obviously feeding into her ego.\n    &quot;Megatron, I want nothing more than to see the Predacons victorious in \nall things. I know by us joining forces we could make it happen. All I ask is \nI be your sub-commander. If you refuse, I will kill Quickstrike now, and take \nthe Darkside files and destroy them.&quot; She said, very diplomatically. She was \ndealing with Megatron, and even though in the past they rarely got along she \nknew he was the better leader.\n    Waiting for a response she turned to see the fuzor in the shafts agian. \n&quot;What dose he think this is? A game of cat and mouse? He&#39;ll have to be \nimmobilized until negotiations are settled. I wouldnt want him to do \nsomething that might give his fraction the upper hand...&quot; She said.\n    Aracnia, still in the command chair, brought over a keypad. On it, she \ninitiated the ventalation patrol sentinels. They were small spherical bots \nwho hovered through out the vent. If a foreign object was found within the \nvent, they would use a high powered electrical charge to stun whatever it was \nbased on size, weight, and mass. They would keep the fuzor busy at least for \nawhile. After all, such small bots as those were easy to get rid of with one \ngood blast. \n    &quot;That should do the trick. They will swarm him in minutes. As for the \nrat, shes gone I belive. And, just in case she wants to come back in....&quot;\n    Aracnia initiated a force feild around the hatch door contianing the \nhole. Darkmouse would need to find another way into the ship is she was to \nrescue her beloved Quickstrike.\n\n"}}
