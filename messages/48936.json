And terrantulas.\n&gt; Rampage had a good excuse for\n&gt; his invulnerability\n&gt; \n&gt; And maximals/redicons all share the same design\n&gt; specs I assume like\n&gt; autobots/decpticons do. While the\n&gt; alliegance/personality/look changed from\n&gt; bot to bot, faction to faction, the over all design\n&gt; specs weren&#39;t any\n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;catmastero&quot; &lt;catmastero@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 13, 2002 3:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Maximals Attack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart\n&gt; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No I think until he became Thrust Waspinator&#39;s\n&gt; spark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was in his head (I can assume he was a special\n&gt; model\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predicon because they never showed where his\n&gt; spark was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just where other bots had their sparks).  This\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explain his ability to get blown up.  The Spark\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything.  If it dies so does everything. \n&gt; Beside&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if logic were in the head you wouldn&#39;t need it\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; revive Waspinator, but they never threw it out\n&gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useless waist of power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; it seems like Inferno, Waspinator and Terrorsaur\n&gt; where the ones that\n&gt; &gt; always got blown up, they might have been the same\n&gt; type of model or\n&gt; &gt; something.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
