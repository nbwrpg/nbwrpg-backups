I think my comp is functioning pretty much ok now,\nso I&#39;m back. I just read 150+ posts, so this might be grossly\ninaccurate. It it is, sorry.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Autofire/Zardus/The Galactors/The Lavacons/Prowl/Kluster/Grimmler::\n&gt;\n&gt; Autofire recieves the signal from Megatron, yelling a battle cry and\nrunning toward the CF, only to be met with a smoke bomb as soon as he\nstarted running. He swears, waving the smoke away and backing up,\nfiring his chain guns blindly in the general direction of the CF. He\ngrunts as two objects hit him in the back, feeling his systems\nstruggle as they tried to regain power, the two objects that had hit\nhim draining energy faster than he could replace it.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spins around, backing away from the draining energy fields that\nthe two missiles fired by Zardus had created. The drain lessens and\nhis power levels begin to rise again. He looks up at the enemy,\nwatching Zardus fly in, more than ten Alliance bots following. This\nwas definitely not good.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, attack,&quot; he replies to the member of the Predacons (gestalt\ngroup, not faction) who had sent him a comm, aiming both chain guns at\nZardus and firing more than two dozen shots from each.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus angles up, the shots fired by the bot he had just hit with\nthe missiles missing. He scans the area, seeing that there were a good\namount of Decepticons here. He activates his comm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Astral,&quot; he says into it, &quot;New orders. Come and aid at this battle,\nbring all the troops that you can.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The Galactors spread out as they fly into the scene. Supernova aims\nhis missile launcher, letting loose several shots at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;Lessee, who I wanna kill?&quot; Flare says, then fires two grenades down\nat Sinnertwin.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Vicyr, completely cloaked, flies below the others, firing three\nlaser bolts at Rampage.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slasys aims carefully, firing two missiles with deadly precision\ndown at Razorclaw.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scrap, flying to the left of the rest of the group, fires four\nlasers down at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl spins around to look at the smoke when he recieves Quarto&#39;s\nmessage, thankful for the warning. He sees Alliance bots fly in in the\ndistance and open fire on the attackers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Time for battle yet again,&quot; he says to Mantle, flying into the air\nand seeing someone attacking behind the CF. He flies toward Fireblade,\nlanding quickly near Firedrill and his friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nice to see you both up and about,&quot; he says to the two that he\nhadn&#39;t seen conscious untill now. &quot;You guys are welcome to help defend\nthe base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Prowl lifts off again, flying at Fireblade and firing two missiles\nat him.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster runs out of the CF as the alarms go off, his missile\nlauncher firing two missiles at Rippersnapper as soon as he gets out\nof the door, aiming carefully as to not hit any Maximals.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; (Argh, forgot about Grimmler! Sorry if I didn&#39;t reply to your last\npost with Tremmer, Megan)\n&gt;\n&gt; Grimmler hears gunfire as he heads back to the CF. &quot;Slag! We&#39;re\nunder attack again!&quot; He exclaims and runs off toward the ship,\nmotioning for Tremmer to follow.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Rippersnapper/Preadcons::\n&gt; &gt; Rippersnapper&#39;s impatience increases, &quot;Signal!

I am Razorclaw of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacons. Megatron sent me and my Predacons as\n&gt; &gt; renforcements, he told us to expect a signal to attack soon, and\n&gt; &gt; we are arriving and ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divebomb reaches Autofire first, lands and transforms, looking\n&gt; &gt; around and smiling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rampage is thundering on behind Razorclaw, a sleek panther, a\n&gt; &gt; blur on the background. He dodges trees, speeding to the\n&gt; &gt; destination, Razorclaw doing likewise, after his commlink message.\n\n\n"}}
