It doesnt wan=\r\nt them to live with the burden of living with the consequences with their c=\r\nharachters actions as well as their own. This I pointed out earlier right b=\r\nefore a good amount of players left. \n\n  In a message dated 1/20/2002 10:36=\r\n:29 AM Eastern Standard Time, jhogan@... writes:\n\n\n\n    Anywa=\r\ny I was going to rant on about how a sequel wouldn&#39;t be all that\n    differ=\r\nent from a restart but I figured why bother?\n\n    When I hit the end of my =\r\nlong typed out rant I hit the problem. The real\n    one. Another person pos=\r\nted that characters are not allowed to die\n    currently...he is utterly in=\r\ncorrect.\n\n    The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given =\r\nthe\n    responsibility to judge how much damage they take...however as we&#39;v=\r\ne seen\n    some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let alone =\r\nresponsibly\n    judge how much damage their character takes. When a bot doe=\r\ns get damaged\n    what typically happens here?\n\n    Here&#39;s the list:\n\n    1=\r\n) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad side of a=\r\n\n    barn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n\n    2) The bot never g=\r\nives chase to his prey. It always lets the long time\n    character slip awa=\r\ny.\n\n    3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any dam=\r\nage is\n    completely gone.\n\n    4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his deat=\r\nh coming back as an enemy\n    infiltrator.\n\n    5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an =\r\nevil clone appears which after various meeting\n    with colleagues or &quot;love=\r\nd ones&quot; turns good again. Personality reverts to\n    pre-evil clone.\n\n    6=\r\n) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. Personality\n=\r\n    is hardly different.\n\n    7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other c=\r\nharacters cart it&#39;s blasted\n    carcass back to a lab where they resurrect =\r\nhim.\n\n    8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same personality...event=\r\nually\n    people will forget you died and you can go back to your old form.=\r\n\n\n    Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean t=\r\nruly\n    die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new plotline=\r\ns you can\n    do with them without repeating rehashed already done ones. Ta=\r\nke for example\n    the geotrons planing to attack the new cat faction....bo=\r\nth factions will\n    survive, I doubt either player who controls the majori=\r\nty of bots in either\n    faction is gonna let their characters get anywhere=\r\n near killed.\n\n    And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequ=\r\nel DOES occur? The\n    role-playing by some will still stink, characters wi=\r\nll still be incapable of\n    dying and given another year or so all plotlin=\r\nes for THAT game will be\n    starting to repeat. While I still do believe a=\r\n restart/sequel is in order I\n    think the role-playing problem needs addr=\r\nessing first to stop a repeat of\n    what&#39;s happening to NBW.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Your u=\r\nse of Yahoo!
