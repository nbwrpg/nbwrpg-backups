Yes, all our \nstorylines have evolved and we have grown fond of them. Same about our \ncharacters. I&#39;m not particularily excited about having to leave my \nProphets or AzureBlade behind. What&#39;s more, Chars can be kept after \nthe restart. I just think I want to explore new ones. The point is, \nthough, that all major factions, like the Alliance, the Maximal, the \ndecepticons and even the preds have started to stagnate since major \nmembers started leaving. This leaves us with weakened Maxies, Preds, \nno more alliance at all, Three decepticon chars blasting each other \ndown... And the alliance, may I remind you, has a total \nstronghold that cannot be entered since its controllers left. Hell, \nthe Tripredacus seem to have become one of the most active faction! \nSure, the restart is not going to be pleasant, but it seems to be one \nof the only ways to make the RPG relive. I don&#39;t blame anybody for \nrefusing it, but I think it is a good thing.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good \n&gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be eliminate \n \n&gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could \nchoice \n&gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are member \n&gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters \n&gt; playing. \n&gt; \n&gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not only \n&gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, despite \n&gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been \nhere \n&gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this \n&gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG is \n&gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), and \n&gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think I \n&gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have \n&gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the saga \n&gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over the \n&gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend it \n&gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and \n&gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my vote \n&gt; is no.
