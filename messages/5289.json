As long as it&#39;s not aboard the Titanic.\n\nLunarpine continued to look at Shadow Wing, was it because of her \nbeautiful white feathers, or because of the animal she represented. \nEither way she was out of his class. (science joke.) They shared this \nworld, this land, this night, and most importantly, this journey.\n\n&quot;tell me again Shadow Wing, why are you helping me?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:(I thought the original arc landed on the North American \ncontinent.

He was bigger, \nstronger, \n&gt; and more deadly as a fighter than she was, but for some strange \nreason, she \n&gt; didn&#39;t fear him.  She looked at him for a moment.  As a wolf, he \nwas a great \n&gt; credit to his kind. She was still wary of him thought, after all, \nthey had \n&gt; just met.  She looked at him as he asked his question.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not sure who will meet us there.  It depends on what is \nhappeneing when \n&gt; we get there.

In the wild a wolf and owl compete for \nthe\n&gt; same food. he hoped that would be different with the maximals. He\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to hurt her, even to survive.\n&gt; Lunarpine shook his head, trying to seperate the logic and instincts\n&gt; buried in his head. To justify both he asked two questions.\n&gt; &quot;Shadow Wing where are we going and who will greet us when we\n&gt; arrive?\n&gt; (side question- how are we getting across the ocean from canada to\n&gt; Tibet?)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
