It held information for this very \nthing. (The spiders couldn&#39;t have known because it was made in Magmatron&#39;s \nhead.   \n&quot;I have known of these creatures since they entered my base. I am aware of \nevery molecule of this ship, nothing goes on without my knowing it.&quot; The Data \ntrack read. &quot;Go about business as usual. If any more of those bugs show up, \ntreat them as common insects, not as robots.&quot;\n    &quot;Have you told anybody else this?&quot; Magmatron asked.\n    &quot;No, I thought you should know first,&quot; CyberShark said.\n    &quot;Good, nobody else needs to be bothered with a simple infestation. I \nwouldn&#39;t worry about the bugs CyberShark, they are of no threat to us, just \nharmless spiders really.&quot; Magmatron hit a sour note with the word &#39;spiders&#39;.\n\n"}}
