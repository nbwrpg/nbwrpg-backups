Veratis \nflew back using his wings to direct himself. Foxfingers cowered \nbeneath the enraged raptor, the sword stopped before striking. The \nRaptor turned to see Ice. It raised the sword in a stance across it&#39;s \nchest. He looked at the beast before it ready for action. It saw \nLunarpine behind her. &quot;Four on one doesn&#39;t seem very maximal, I guess \nI&#39;ll have to even those numbers starting with you.&quot; he pointed a \nclawed scaley finger at Ice, she was the biggest and appeared to be \nthe strongest. He flipped the finger over and waved it at her, &quot;Any \ntime you&#39;re ready freak.&quot;\n\nLunarpine tried to go around Ice but was stopped by Veratis, &quot;Let her \ngo, She&#39;s got a better chance than we do.&quot; The old bot said in an \nunconvinced voice.\n\nFoxfingers transformed to fox mode and hid under one of the lab \nstations. He peeked out watching the duel ready to begin.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, I know it sounds strange, but even the maximals had things \n&gt; that could kill, and they were peace loving bots who..&quot; She heard \n&gt; Veratis on the com. She had kept her mind closed off so she \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; hear what the other bots were thinking. She looked at \n&gt; Lunarpine. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She ran out of the room and headed for the \n&gt; lab. She was a little faster at running than Lunarpine, but it \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; by much. She got there opened the lab door. She saw this big green \nbot\n&gt; attacking FoxFingers. She transformed into polar bear and roared at \n&gt; it. She was almost the same size as this bot. She felt her wings \ngrow \n&gt; out of her shoulders as she changed into griffen mode. She thought \nto \n&gt; herself,&quot;I got to get that undercontrol.&quot; She looked at raptor \n&gt; bot. &quot;But now it is not the time,&quot; se thought to herself. She \n&gt; squawked and flapped her wings. &quot;FOXFINGERA, GET EHIND ME!&quot; She \n&gt; squawked and tried to get the bot&#39;s atttention so that FoxFingers \nand \n&gt; Veratis could get out of the way. She glared at this bot. &quot;It&#39;s \njust \n&gt; you and me pal.&quot; She was ready to see what her new form could do in \n&gt; battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ice or Shadow Wing, she was still the trusting soul she always \n&gt; &gt; was. &quot;Regaurdless of what he seems to be, he still hasn&#39;t earned \nmy \n&gt; &gt; trust.&quot; Lunarpine didn&#39;t know whether it was paranoia or instinct \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; Veratis still hadn&#39;t shown what his true motives were. &quot;What kind \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; being would preach peace and carry a virus that could wipe out an \n&gt; &gt; entire planet?&quot; There was still to much to learn to fully \n&gt; understand \n&gt; &gt; thier host, but he was at least willing to give the old bot a \n&gt; chance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the lab The chamber opened to reveal a large green raptor, \nclaws \n&gt; &gt; and teeth shining like stars at night. It made no movement to \n&gt; attack, \n&gt; &gt; the only movement it made was a loud roar and then stare at the \ntwo \n&gt; &gt; bots before it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Greetings&quot; Veratis began, &quot;I am Veratis, and this is \nFoxfingers.&quot; \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; tried to stay back in case of trouble. A sudden movement from \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers set the raptor on immediate alert. Spotting the \nscarred \n&gt; &gt; maximal symbol set his functions spinning. With a quick jump it \n&gt; leapt \n&gt; &gt; forward, Foxfingers ducked in time to avoid the blow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Full alert, Lunarpine and Ice to the lab.&quot; Veratis shouted \n&gt; &gt; transforming to his half bat mode ready to defend himself. The \n&gt; raptor \n&gt; &gt; lashed out with it&#39;s tail connecting with Foxfingers chest. \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers fought to maintain control but lost his balance. The \n&gt; &gt; raptor turned to attack again, &quot;Razor Claw Terrorize.&quot; He \n&gt; transformed \n&gt; &gt; exactly like the origional dinobot but his head looked more \n&gt; &gt; insectoid. Antenna type ears rose above his head. He drew his \nsword \n&gt; &gt; for the deathblow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine hears Veratis&#39; transmission, &quot;We&#39;re needed,&quot; he \nexclaims \n&gt; &gt; unneededly, He knew that Ice probably heard the cry \ntelepathically \n&gt; &gt; before the comm relayed it.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
