It was a near miss, but he was fortunate enou=\r\ngh that he had the fuel and the rubber to make it to a somewhat safe zone.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Talk about burn&#39;n rubber, so not the way I intended ta do that.  You okay=\r\n Rat Trap?&quot;\n\nRat Trap coughs a bit.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m okay.  Ughh, I hate that sm=\r\nell, worse than what comes outa Quickstride&#39;s tail end... So ya got all fou=\r\nr of your wheels, I hope? Because if ya blew any of your tires, we&#39;re done =\r\nfor.&quot;\n\nNight Shift checks his tire pressures.\n\n&quot;Got &#39;em all, lucky for me. =\r\n Everything&#39;s fine, we still got enough gas, and I&#39;m pickn&#39; up a small fain=\r\nt Unicronian signature.  It&#39;s ahead of us.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks to the fuel gau=\r\nge.\n\n&quot; Whew, you still got almost a full tank of gas.  But I thought ya jus=\r\nt filled up back at the Ark..  Gee, whatever vehicle alt form ya chose, sur=\r\ne eats up a lotta gas.&quot;\n\nNight Shift continues the trek.\n\n&quot; V6 engine, all =\r\nwheel drive, yeah, I know.  Heey, still doesn&#39;t eat up as much fuel as a De=\r\ncepticon Seeker does.  They go through gas within astroseconds.&quot;\n\nRat Trap =\r\ncocks his head in confusion.\n\n&quot; I - wouldn&#39;t know that because till now, we=\r\n really hadn&#39;t known much about Decepticons.&quot;\n\nNight Shift chuckles. Keepin=\r\ng the mood a little lighter seemed to help them both along easier.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s =\r\ntrue, those engines are big, and the bigger the engine, the more fuel it&#39;s =\r\napt ta use.  And they got several engines instead of just one, like me.&quot;\n\nR=\r\nat Trap listens curiously.\n\n&quot;Oh, that explains it.  Yeah, you&#39;re right, two=\r\n engines would use up more gas. So, think we&#39;ll be able ta find Cheetor?&quot;\n\n=\r\nNight Shift sighs.\n\n&quot;I hope so.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cycl=\r\nonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift sighs and t=\r\nransforms.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah well, can&#39;t be avoided. C&#39;mon, we&#39;re outa here. Fa=\r\nstest way ta safe\n&gt; ground.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets in and buckles himself i=\r\nn the driver&#39;s seat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I sure hope you got good tires buddy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Night Shift replies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good, tranny&#39;s workn&#39; suspension&#39;=\r\ns up ta snuff, we&#39;re as good\n&gt; as outa here. No worries, I got four wheel d=\r\nrive, we&#39;ll make it outa here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He starts to roll in the opposite d=\r\nirection, hoping to get himself and Rat\n&gt; Trap to saftey while still tracki=\r\nng the Unicronian signature, hoping to find\n&gt; its origin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe ground rumbled as Nightshift revved his engine and took off across the\n&gt;=\r\n burnt and scorched terrain. Behind them the volcano began to spew large\n&gt; =\r\nchunks of molten rock into the skies again, accompanied by smoke and ash. A=\r\ns\n&gt; they had already noted the air was definitely taking a definite sulfur =\r\nand\n&gt; acidic odor. On the horizon dark clouds boiled and frothed =96 clouds=\r\n made up\n&gt; not of water but of soot and ash and dirt that floated in the ai=\r\nr like\n&gt; deadly smog.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Magma continued inexorably towards Nightshif=\r\nt as he moved like seom\n&gt; boiling red wave, but so far he was able to keep =\r\nahead of it. As the ground\n&gt; began to level out the speed that the liquid r=\r\nock moved was beginning to\n&gt; slow.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rat Trap and Nightshift tried to=\r\n scan for Unicronian energy signatures,\n&gt; at first they came up empty, it w=\r\nould seem that their quarry had escaped\n&gt; them for the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhi=\r\nle ahead of them were the remains of a small forest. It was here that\n&gt; the=\r\n Magma was coming to a stop as they were coming to the fringes of the\n&gt; bro=\r\nken landscape, the forest a victim of the ravages from the initial\n&gt; assaul=\r\nt from the now distant volcano. The leaves and brush of this forest\n&gt; had b=\r\neen all burnt away but the trees still remained, looking much like\n&gt; burnt =\r\nmatchsticks all facing skyward. There did not appear to be any signs\n&gt; of b=\r\niological life.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, despite the lack of any living signals Nights=\r\nhift was able to pick\n&gt; up a single faint Unicronian signature coming from =\r\njust ahead. It was\n&gt; difficult to get more then direction from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n direction indicated that is was located somewhere inside the burnt out\n&gt; w=\r\noods!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
