Anyways, I&#39;m going to play up \nWheelie mostly according to his &#39;reputation&#39; in the fandom.  So, he&#39;ll be \nrhymey and silly, and occasinoally insane!\n\nHe doesn&#39;t -have- to induce said insanity in others, but do feel free to \nplay up the normal fandom reactions of horror to your characters \nencountering him or other such amusing things, or play up the horror stories \nthey might have heard!\n\nI&#39;m definiteyl up for tongue in cheek things about him and other sorts of \ninanities, so feel free to play off what he is!\n\n&gt; Welcome Wheelie, it is good to see you posting. Please everyone\n&gt; welcome Adam to our little group. I believe he will be a good\n&gt; addition.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be away for the rest of the weekend. But I look forward to\n&gt; posting on Monday.\n&gt;\n&gt; TTFN\n&gt;\n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 6/23/11, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Aprobed\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Super Cyclonus\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 22, 2011 5:20 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Character Request - WHEELIE\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I approve the character.

Can be one of the reinforcements and such sent in.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; WHEELIE\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Faction: Autobot/Maximal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; QUOTE:  Look there, over there!  Friends find, look behind!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PROFILE:  An Autobot by the name of Wheelie grew up on a crashed ship,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surviving for an unkonwn period of time on Quintessa.  Found by \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Autobots\n&gt; &gt;&gt; during the first Unicron crisis, he soon joined them and was a stalwart\n&gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of their forces going alon gwith the first Maximal Imperium after the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; war.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A loner often forming strong bonds adn freindships and with a unique \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sort\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personality from his time spent in isolation and having to fight to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; survive,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie is often accompanied by his scrounger friend Gnaw, operating \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; local groups that cna tolerate his infmay as he moves on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ABILITIES:  A permanent glitch in his vocal processor developed by his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; period in isolation upon Quintessa, Wheelie&#39;s vocalizer tends to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; vocalize\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ways in whatever linguistic dialect that are often translated as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;rhymes&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; These tend to be high pitched, grating, and annoying, and prolonged\n&gt; &gt;&gt; exposure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is held to be extremely damaging to one&#39;s circuits, much like Cosmic \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rust\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and Fire Suppressant Foam.  As such, the sight (or sound) of Wheelie on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; battlefield is often enough to drive many Predacons or Decepticons to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; flee\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and abandon the area.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie is armed with a small energon slingshot with a close range high\n&gt; &gt;&gt; capacity load that is capable of inflicting significant damage on \n&gt; &gt;&gt; larger\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cybertronians.  His small alt mode of a Cybertronian racer has a top \n&gt; &gt;&gt; speed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of 180 kilometers per hour and a range of over three thousand \n&gt; &gt;&gt; kilometers.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie himself is heavily energon efficient, even by Maximal standard,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his bodyframe is capable of extended independent functioning without\n&gt; &gt;&gt; refueling or repairs (which is the way many Maximals would profess to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it), and is quite simplistic to maintain that even Wheelie can keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; himself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; basically functional without medical supervision.  His small bodyframe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; also quite agile and difficult to hit, combined with his long vorns \n&gt; &gt;&gt; spent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surviving have made him quite surprisingly adept at escape and evasion,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guerilla operations, and reconaissance in urban or organic areas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Weaknesses:  Wheelie has much of a reputation, deserved or not, among\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Autobots and Decepticons.  While he can count some as staunch friends, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ability to seemingly inflict insanity to those in constant presence of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chattering has made many Autobots and Maximals wish to avoid prolonged\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interactions with him, and can lead to his constant solo operations in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; field without backup.  This has also lead to a constant but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unsubstantiated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; threats of violence to be inflicted upon him by his own faction, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; depending\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on how casual the company is.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wheelie&#39;s form, while agile, is very small and very vulnerable, and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; lacks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; power.  He is weak physically, and his primary weapon (an energon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; slingshot)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has a very limited range, and even low powered energy weapons can \n&gt; &gt;&gt; inflict\n&gt; &gt;&gt; significant damage upon him.  In a hand to hand fight he is seriously\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vulnerable to damage and can take few hits.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; History:  Wheelie spent unknown thousands of vorns as the only survivor \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; crashed ship upon Quintessa, where upon his rescue he became a stalwart\n&gt; &gt;&gt; part\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the AUtobot forces, most often operating on long range reconaissance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; missions or as backup to his friends.  After the Autobot/Decepticon War\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ended, and many of his friends went into retirement, Wheelie was not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upgraded along with teh initial wave of Maximal upgrading, preferring \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keep his original body as a memory to those whom had been lost in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; war.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Pending the end of the war, Wheelie&#39;s whereabouts became much fo a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mystery,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with various stories at any point theorizing he had been killed in a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; back\n&gt; &gt;&gt; alley by Autobot/Decepticons (most often accompanied by &#39;I&#39;LL DRINK TO\n&gt; &gt;&gt; THAT!&#39; in Maccadam&#39;s) to that he was working with th Maximal Security\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Administration.  One theroy even stated that he had been part of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Experimentation Program that had produced Protoform X, simply stating \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he was what had driven the unit that would eventually call itself \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rampage\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; total sociopathy and nihilism simply from being locked in a cell for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiments!  Many would explain their decline to believe in Primus by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; saying &#39;He made that guy, didn&#39;t he?&#39; and gesture to the MiniBot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Un)fortunately, Wheelie has been still functioning over the era, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; living\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cybertron, often going on trips to search the galaxy and find more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; information.  While there, he would spend much of his time in Little \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Iacon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; remiscing of the old days.  Upon attemptimg to join a craft, according \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scuttleaft a Maximal hit upon the idea of sending him along with Leo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reinforcement crew to Earth.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Further scuttleaft was hoping that by sending him several tens of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thousands\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of vorns back in time and to active military conflict would &#39;get the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cans to be recycled&#39;, but were never actively confirmed as transfer \n&gt; &gt;&gt; orders\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were sent.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
