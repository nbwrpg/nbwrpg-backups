I know just the thing too.  By the way, I need you=\r\n to activate a holographic field on me.  As far as Hydras knows, Night Shif=\r\nt has mutilated me to the point of irecognizable proportions.  I need a hol=\r\nogram of me in a dismantled state of being.  That should also draw out who&#39;=\r\ns hiding behind the cloaked field.  Tucson out.&quot;\n\nNight Shift holds onto th=\r\ne rear view mirror as he looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot; Psst, you&#39;re - not gonna hold =\r\na grudge against me for this are ya?&quot;\n\nTucson shakes his head no.\n\n&quot;Shhh...=\r\n  The less they know the better. So far you&#39;re doing great.. But we are goi=\r\nng to have another sparring match eventually, and when that happens, you&#39;re=\r\n going to lose.&quot;\n\nNight Shift cringes.\n\n&quot;Slag, that means you&#39;re gonna lemm=\r\ne have it.&quot;\n\nTucson narrows his brow.\n\n&quot;Bet your rotten aft I am.. All righ=\r\nt, now, concentrate on what&#39;s important.  Right now you&#39;ve beaten the slag =\r\nout of me, and you need to bring a trophy back to Hydras.  But first....\n\nH=\r\ne shoots an arrow into Night Shift&#39;s knee!\n\n&quot;AHHHHHH!  WHAT THE PIT?!  SLAG=\r\n YOU!&quot;\n\n&quot;THAT&#39;S FOR UNDERSETIMATING ME!&quot;\n\nNight Shift bears down hard on Tu=\r\ncson as Tucson now reveals that he has no Matrix inside him.\n\n&quot;You lyn&#39; son=\r\n of a glitch! Just wait till I get back ta Hydras! You&#39;re gonna tell me whe=\r\nre that Matrix is or else I&#39;m gonna finish the job here&#39;n now!&quot;\n\nTucson giv=\r\nes Night Shift a cold look.\n\n&quot; Go ahead, you&#39;ll never find it if you do.&quot;\n\n=\r\nWithout warning, a second arrow is shot into Night Shift&#39;s right thigh!\n\n&quot;A=\r\nHHHH!!!&quot;\n\nTucson acts the part and plays possum out on the field, just as h=\r\ne has finished putting a few &quot;Pointers&quot; into Night Shift&#39;s intentions.  Nig=\r\nht Shift limps away, still with the rear view mirror in hand.\n\n&quot;Slag, he di=\r\ndn&#39;t have ta go that far..&quot;\n\nHe limps with his right and left legs impailed=\r\n by arrows, also hindering him from transforming.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita:\n&gt; \n&gt; elita looked at the conflit=\r\n, she was scared for her uncle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Preston Carroll \n&gt; Sent: Frid=\r\nay, March 19, 2010 5:08 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: Bac=\r\nk to the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt; Kup continue chasing and shooting agaisnt Night=\r\nshift while elita had woke up and walked towards the command center and wal=\r\nking towards Lord Elder, and tried to climb a nearby chair hoping to see  w=\r\nhat was goin on\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder looked over at Elita, a smile on his face. =\r\nHe was still not\n&gt; the most comfortable around the younger ones, but as lon=\r\ng as they\n&gt; weren&#39;t crying it was good.

Still, it\n&gt; was only barely enough. T=\r\nhey could only see the dot if it was moving\n&gt; quickly, when it slowed down =\r\nit disappeared. He suspected that only\n&gt; because it was so close to the Ark=\r\n that he was able to detect it at\n&gt; all.\n&gt; \n&gt; He opened a communication cha=\r\nnnel to the Maximals, &quot;When you guys are\n&gt; done, that sensor ghost is back,=\r\n I&#39;m not sure if it ever actually\n&gt; left.
