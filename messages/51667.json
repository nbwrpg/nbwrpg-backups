Also through experiences with an alien\n&gt; race called the Vok, some bots like myself have become\n&gt; transmetal.  Transmetals can be damaged by energon\n&gt; radiation, but have a much higher tolerance for it. \n&gt; Here however the energon radiation seems to fluctuate\n&gt; from nearly zero, to off the scale.  So much even a\n&gt; transmetal can be damaged by it outside of Beast Mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Azure The Warrior &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Katya refrained to protest about the fact that her\n&gt; &gt; mech was by far better \n&gt; &gt; then those made on Terra.
