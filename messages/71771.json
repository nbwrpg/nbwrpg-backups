The room was dominated by a large table that ran\ndown the length of most of the room. At the head of the table was a\nlarge chair for HYDRAS and at the other end of the table was a view\nscreen for any images that HYDRAS might deem fit to have displayed.\nAlong the rest of the table there were chairs positioned around\nstrategically around it at different points to ensure that everyone\nhad a seat.\n\nThere were windows looking to the outside of the ship as well, showing\na bit of the exterior and giving a magnificent view of the surround\narea. This room is what might be called the captain&#39;s ready room had\nthe ship actually been in flight, and it was a room that could easily\nserve as a meeting room for HYDRAS.\n\nAlready in the room FRACTYL was looking over some notes that he had,\nhe looked up as HYDRAS entered followed by CROTEK and of course by the\never present INFERNO, and then lastly by SCOURGE.\n\n&quot;Hydras.&quot; SCOURGE said, &quot;The preliminary report from the sweeps are\ntelling me that as far as the optic can determine is that they are at\nthe edge of a large jungle, one that spreads for miles. There is\nnothing strange about the rocks and trees and such but there is some\nsort of energy coming from it.&quot;\n\nSCOURGE cocked his head as if he was not sure how to explain the next\npart, &quot;From what the sweeps are telling me, it reminds them a little\nof Unicron, but it is different. They can&#39;t explain it.&quot; He grunted as\nthey told him more. &quot;They have flown around and from what they can see\nthe energy is cutting off all communications, all video, audio, every\nkind of transmission that they know of.&quot;\n\nFRACTYL was listening with great interest as SCOURGE talked he making\nnotes on his PADD as well. &quot;I think I miht have a map of that.&quot; He\nsaid. &quot;I have made a few surveys of the area in question from a few\nyears ago.&quot;\n\nHe reached over and pressed a few buttons and an image appeared on the\nscreen. The image on the viewscreen was indeed that of a large and\ndense jungle, one that covers a large area.\n\n&quot;This -Rainforest-&quot; FRACTYL said, stressing the words &#39;Rain Forest as\na correction to SCOURGE, &quot;for it is more than a simple Jungle\nencompasses an area of approximately 10,500 square kilometers of\nrolling and uneven terrain.&quot;\n\nFRACTYL turned to look at HYDRAS, &quot;Although at that time there was no\nindication of the energies that the sweeps are reporting.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
