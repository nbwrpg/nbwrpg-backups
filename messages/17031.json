He\n&gt; now looks like Black Battle Convoy from\n&gt; Transformers: Car Robots (TF2000). He is pure evil,\n&gt; his Spark contains no goodness at all. His plans are\n&gt; mine to keep. He has had a run in with God Magnus,\n&gt; who is his Brother, and Valtron, the Maximal version\n&gt; of Galvatron. Valtron seems to think that Dark Prime\n&gt; is the most evil thing in the universe, he seemed to\n&gt; forget about Unicron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why did you want to know all of this?\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
