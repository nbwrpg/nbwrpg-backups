Armor dulled from grains of ash, he rose from the ground with which he had fallen upon from the force of the impact, shaking himself to clear as much of the soot from his being as possible.  It was obvious to him now that he seemed to lack in the expertise of a warrior he once thought of himself as, which was a more potent blow then the missile itself. At least he could repair and go in with his life from such a thing, however, this was much more damaging and could last a lifetime and then some.\r\nDinobot was losing his edge and his honor, and had been since he had been resurrected.   First of all, which proved this was the way he acted around Tavatron, ways that would have sickened him at the mere thought years ago. And now things were completely different with him. Of course, he was a cold slag to those around him but if Tavatron was ever hurt he was concerned, what she said he listened to, what bothered her bothered him, and at a couple rare occasions he even seemed attracted to her. All those things occurring against his nature and to let them happen period wasn�t like him. He was not who he believed he once was any longer. He had changed and he wasn�t entirely sure he liked it.   One thing which bothered him more then anything else was an idea that just appeared in his mind which had the probability to be the reason as to why he had been acting those ways towards Tavatron; the past thought taken from the back of his mind and brought forward.\r\nThere was the slimmest chance that it could be because he was attracted to her but even that was shot in the darkness. And how was a reason, which eluded him. However, if so, did he need a reason to be? OF COURSE!  Dinobot was the sort of man who needed a reason before he even considered accepting anything and he wasn�t even sure it was attraction to begin with and even so, why should he do anything about it? Tavatron had never shown any interest in him beyond that of what one would call a traveling partner. And why should he even care if she did?  However, before the thought formed any further within his mind he stopped it short, why he even thought it was that was beyond his own thinking. Besides, it was hardly the time. So, as so many times before, he filed that little thought into the back of his mind but still it was there. Perhaps to be brought up at a later date yet now was not that.\r\nBy this time Dinobot had brushed enough of the soot off of his form to tell that there was actually a man under it all, his scanners already locating Tavatron and an annoyable concern growing at the factor that she seemed to be in distress. : Surprise, surprise.: his thoughts formed, which was nothing out of the ordinary.   These days Tavatron seemed more edgy then normal, perhaps which also reflected his lack in honor lately.\r\nDinobot let out a sigh and rubbed at the back of his head, which had hit the ground rather hard when he had fell. Seemed nothing was going right for either one of them lately, which figured.\r\nFlexing his newly repaired shoulder-plate he made his way from his current location towards Tavatrons, making an easy way through the charred and cratered battlefield, already knowing that she was on her knees before he even approached her. Coming up behind the fembot, detecting the damage and seeing clearly the mechfluid gathering around her. He stopped and looked down at the top of her head, not failing to see the damage her shoulder had taken.** � Get up.� ** His voice was harsh and was more of a command then that of anything else. This was no way for a warrior to be and even if he was no longer one he was not about to let Tavatron sink down to his level and lose the title he had. Even though the title of a warrior was something he would rather die then depart from.\r\nWhen Tavatron didn�t comply he growled, turning it over in his mind that even as much damage as she had taken couldn�t be as bad as she was making it out to be. A shoulder could never kill and he was always standing after sustaining even more damage then this.   Dinobot snarled, leaving no time for Tavatron to react any longer before he kneeled down behind her and moved his clawed hands to grasp her waist firmly before rising to stand, presuming to take her with him.** � I said, stand up!� ** Narrowing his optics he moved to give Tavatron a rough shake.** � Kneeling is no position for a warrior to take! And I will NOT see you assume it!� ** Perhaps�perhaps she could succeed where he had failed, yet, the title of warrior would be his again�in time. **\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
