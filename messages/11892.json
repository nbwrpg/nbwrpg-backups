Take your time. Also, if you like,  can\nhave\n&gt; you placed in your quarters with a medical droid to watch over you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Paralysis looked at the virtual map and saw that several Allience\nmembers\n&gt; were assulting the skeleton of the once proud, but now shattered Ark. He\n&gt; slammed his fist down and cursed.\n&gt;     Aerostreak, Gunatix, and Grappler sat on the bridge, learning a few\n&gt; things from Paralysis. They were as shocked as he was.\n&gt;     &quot;Black Aracnia! The Allience is attacking the Ark!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Aracnia stormed out of Darkmouses room without saying goodbye. Right\nnow\n&gt; she had extreamly important matters to deal with. She ran down the\ncorridor\n&gt; and into the bridge. She saw firsthand what was going on.\n&gt;     &quot;Well well, about time the Allience finally grows a backbone and dose\n&gt; something! Send a transmission to Darkone telling him that you,\nAerostreak,\n&gt; Grappler, Adrax, and Autofire will be joining them. I will maintain things\n&gt; here and join you. Quickstrike will man the computers. Also, Atma,\nDecadel,\n&gt; and Hibichi..er..whatever, will join you as well. Hurry!&quot; She ordered,\n&gt; looking to her crew.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
