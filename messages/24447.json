Why didn&#39;t Oblitertron take damage from Gigan&#39;s shots? \n\nAs Gigan fought, he suddenly noticed how damaged the Cybertronian Fire was.\nHe then began fighting even more fiercly by launching two missiles at \nObliterron, and turning, fired 6 shells from his blast cannon at Sixshot.\nnbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; (Dang comp, about to finish a reply and it cuts me off an&#39; doesn&#39;t let me \n&gt; save the e-mail. �Sorry if this is sloppy, but when I write out a long \ne-mail \n&gt; and it&#39;s lost, I do a poor job rewriting it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf, I fired at you via Serpentor at point blank range with a plasma \n&gt; launcher and slashed at your side with an energy blade. �You posted you \n&gt; pushed the weapon to the side, and left you exposed. �Now, if that were \ntrue, \n&gt; Serpentor would&#39;ve struck you rather hard in the side with the blade. �But \n&gt; you posted it hit Luna&#39;s thigh. �I won&#39;t be posting with &#39;Pentor until you \n&gt; fix that)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oblitertron/Sixshot/Dark Wolf/Double \n&gt; Punch/Injector/Manterror/Bumblebee/Ares/Nemesis \n&gt; Enforcer/Scattershot/Firestarter/\n&gt; Chordate/Unitron:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oblitertron watched as Hysteria ran, and let out a hoarse laugh. �He saw \n&gt; Angel Prime, which looked a fire ball, head for him. �He laughed, knowing \nhis \n&gt; gigantic form was rather impervious to fire (as was the team member who \n&gt; formed his left arm, Pyro). �As Angel Prime struck him, he stepped \nbackwards \n&gt; several meters, but fired off three optic blasts at Angel. �\n&gt; \n&gt; The gestalt&#39;s chest had a large (not a deep dent) dent in his chest where \n&gt; Angel Prime had hit, and it couldn&#39;t be told if he had been burned since \nhis \n&gt; chets was pure black, as was most of his entire body. �But he wasn&#39;t hurt \nby \n&gt; the flames.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot swerved his turret, firing off eight shots, two from all four of \nhis \n&gt; cannons. �The first six were intercepted by the shields. �But with a bright \n&gt; flicker, the shields disappeared, and were gone. �The remaining two struck \n&gt; the hull of the CF, doing insignificant damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Wolf let out a howl, firing off three optic blasts at the Cybertronian \n&gt; Fire. �The blasts struck the hull, leaving a deep impression in the side.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch watched as all the shots missed him. �He raised his pinchers, \n&gt; but heard a whistling sound. �He hadn&#39;t noticed the second missile \nSideswipe \n&gt; had fired, adn was struck in the chest, and hit the ground. �He knew his \n&gt; cloak was down, and cursed.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised both pinchers, firing off two energy signature seeking missiles, \n&gt; one from both pinchers. �He had fired one in return at Sideswipe, and one \nat \n&gt; Torca. �He launched his cyber bee, Cyberline, from his left wrist, and \n&gt; watched the mechanical insect gain altitude quickly, its insect optics \n&gt; glowing a bright green.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror dodged the missiles and most of the shots by going hard left, \nthree \n&gt; blasts striking his side and weakening the armor significantly, though not \n&gt; penetrating. �Though they did knock him out of the way of Grimmler&#39;s shots, \n&gt; but the Alliance member didn&#39;t even notice that Maximal was firing on him. �\n&gt; He raised both arms, firing off three ion disks from both. �Three ion disks \n&gt; lanced out at Ratchet&#39;s chest, three more headed for the Maximal&#39;s left \nfoot.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector raised an arm, firing off two stinger missiles, intercepting all \nbut \n&gt; two nails, the two striking him a little ways below his neck. �He raised \nhis \n&gt; free arm, firing of two stinger missiles at Torca&#39;s abdomen. �\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bumblebee fired off three rapid optic blasts, disintegrating eight nails. �\n&gt; The remaining ones stuck in his abdomen. �They were small and didn&#39;t cause \n&gt; much damage, but they did cause some leaking, which hurt. �Bumblebee raised \n&gt; both arms with a cry of pain, and fired off two stinger missiles from the \n&gt; launcher in each hand, four stinger missiles launching out at Torca&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares jumped back, avoiding most of Ice&#39;s energy ball, part of the energy \n&gt; reaching the tip of his foot, but it didn&#39;t cause anything. �He fired off \n&gt; four bolts from his rifle at Ice&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer saw IR doing weird stuff, and knew she was charging up \nsome \n&gt; kind of weapon. �He transformed into his bat mode, with a wingspan of \nthirty \n&gt; feet. �He covered up his animal body the best he could, part of the blast \n&gt; engulfing the front of him, but the blast was bigger than Nemesis&#39; bat \nmode, \n&gt; and the rest continued on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis dropped to the grown in pain, his wings sizzling. �He transformed \n&gt; into biped mode painly, the legs of his bat mode bleeding mech-fluid. �He \n&gt; stood up painfully, inspecting his wings and yelled. �They were at a 30% \n&gt; integrity. �Usually it was long in a battle until they were hurt that bad. �\n&gt; He cursed as they were charred and black. �He held his wings aloft even \n&gt; though it hurt pretty bad, and launched into the air. �&quot;SCATTERSHOT!&quot; he \n&gt; yelled into his comm, &quot;Pattern Omega-Boom on the witch!&quot; he yelled, pulling \n&gt; out a missile launcher from subspace and gaining altitude painfully. �He \nwas \n&gt; so enraged, he didn&#39;t notice the rest of IR&#39;s blast was heading straight \nfor \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire itself, its shields now down from previous attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot saw the two incoming blasts, one aimed at his head, one aimed \nat \n&gt; his propulsion system, which was in his feet. �He transformed into eagle \n&gt; mode, the blasts going by harmlessly, his size decreased by more than three \n&gt; times because of the transformation. �He transformed back to biped mode, \n&gt; receiving Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; he said, moving his left arm to point at Tavatron, firing \noff \n&gt; fifteen explosive rounds from his automatic rifle at her torso. �A charge \n&gt; appeared in his left hand from subspace. �He threw the charge, which was \nset \n&gt; to explode on impact, at Iron Raptor&#39;s right side.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron cursed as Hot Rod got a hold of his feet, and fell to his back. \n�His \n&gt; mind raced for a brief second, but then he picked up a familiar signature. �\n&gt; &quot;Firestarter...&quot; he whispered. �&quot;No time for you!&quot; he yelled, raising his \n&gt; rifle and firing off three bolts at Hot Rod&#39;s chest, a single optic blast \n&gt; lancing out at his abdomen as he pulled his leg free and got to his feet, \n&gt; powering up his feet boosters.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter saw the unmistakable form. �How could you miss someone who was \n&gt; almost identicle to an entity that had nearly destroyed your home planet? �\n&gt; Firestarter had been at that battle...\n&gt; \n&gt; He hovered for a brief second, then descending down towards Unitron, a T \n&gt; shaped hilt appearing from his personal subspace pocket into his right arm. \n�\n&gt; He pressed on the bottom of the hilt, a blade of flames forming.\n&gt; \n&gt; ==\n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate shook and yelled out, slamming a fist on the console he was at. \n�The \n&gt; main one was destroyed, and there was no time to fix it. �He heard someone \n&gt; enter, and turned, raising his laser rifle to aim at Hysteria&#39;s head. �But \n&gt; his scans said she was a Maximal, so he lowered his weapon, but kept it in \n&gt; hand, and took a moment to build up strength to answer her useless question.\n&gt; \n&gt; His face was caked with dry mech-fluid, and the numerous cuts were still \n&gt; bleeding. �Internal scans done by himself revealed that he had lost too \nmuch \n&gt; mech-fluid. �Though he wasn&#39;t seriously injured and it would take a long \ntime \n&gt; for him to die from his wounds, it was inevitable at this rate in the \n&gt; Maximal/Alliance battle. �Anyone who knew him wouldn&#39;t recognize him by \n&gt; seeing his face. �Instead of being proud, he was slumped, and his face \nlooked \n&gt; tired and worn, not to mention it was covered in mech-fluid like a mask. \n�He \n&gt; pressed a few buttons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Shields are gone. �Hull integrity at 86%,&quot; he sighed. �The base shook and \nhe \n&gt; slammed a fist on a console, activating a comm. link to Iron Raptor. \n�&quot;HEY!&quot; \n&gt; he yelled. �&quot;WATCH IT YOU BUCKET FOR BRAINS! �DON&#39;T SHOOT MY SLAGGING \nSHIP!&quot; \n&gt; he yelled loudly. �He wasn&#39;t in the mood for pleasantries, or these Past \n&gt; Earth Maximals&#39; countless screw ups.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;do all Maximals who stay on this planet to long end up \n&gt; being complete idiots?&quot;\n&gt; \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
