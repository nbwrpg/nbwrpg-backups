(She closed the \nline) So, Cybertronian Leader, do you think we can work together, or \ndo you need more arguments?\n\nHer tone might imply the use of strength as a demonstration, but Vok \nphilosophy forbade her to damage the Vector more than necessary. She \nwould have to use diplomacy.\n\n\n"}}
