H=\r\ne wished he had better news for her.  He turns to Lord Elder and Kup with t=\r\nhe same soft expression on his face.\n\n&quot;I - wish it didn&#39;t have to - come to=\r\n this.  Poor Elita.  No one - should ever lose loved ones to - the greed of=\r\n corrupted forces.  Before I - get my energon, I - think someone needs - a =\r\nshoulder to lean on.&quot;\n\nStill putting others before himself, Tucson slowly w=\r\nalks over to Elita and gently kneels down to her, hearing where she is with=\r\n his supurb hearing.  \n\n&quot; I want you to know that I fully intend to keep my=\r\n promise to you.  It may take a long time, but Elita, if I have to lose my =\r\nspark to give you back your parents, I&#39;ll do that.  I won&#39;t give up until y=\r\nou&#39;re reunited with your family.  Right now, Rodimus isn&#39;t himself, and I s=\r\nuspect your mother will not be herself either.  Perceptor - has altered you=\r\nr father&#39;s programming to the point  where he considers us enemies.  Right =\r\nnow, Rodimus would like nothing more than to make scrap metal out of all of=\r\n us.  So - before I can get him to you I - have to find a way to reverse th=\r\ne shell program Perceptor put over him.  And that I assure you, is the trut=\r\nh.&quot;\n\nHe gently takes her hand.\n\n&quot; Until your father and your mother returns=\r\n, I want you to know that if you need someone to support you, I&#39;ll be more =\r\nthan happy to be that figure.  I&#39;ve got plenty of room in my heart to care =\r\nfor anyone who needs my help.&quot;\n\nHe gets back on his feet, and gently rubs E=\r\nlita&#39;s shoulder.  He stumbles back up and heads over to Kup and Lord Elder.=\r\n\n\n&quot; Next time we encounter Cyclonus, Hydras and Scourge, I personally want =\r\nto deal wtih Cyclonus myself.  He leached off of Rodimus and thus has voila=\r\nted one of our own.  He won&#39;t get away with it, I won&#39;t let him get away wi=\r\nth it!&quot;\n\nHe now paces with a slight pitch of anger.\n\n&quot; And as far as Hydras=\r\n, Perceptor and Scourge are concerned, I want them lured out into the open =\r\nand I want full stasis locks on all of them.  After that, I want them restr=\r\nained permanently and sent to Char where they can do no further harm.  Afte=\r\nr that, I strongly suggest we take over the dark fortress, clean it out, an=\r\nd convert it into shelter which can be used to shelter those who have nothi=\r\nng over their heads. It&#39;s the least I can do, to - return something to the =\r\ninnocent which - has been taken away from them&quot;.  \n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot; Just be su=\r\nre no one is killed in the process.  I fully intend to do this the honorabl=\r\ne way.&quot;    \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ku=\r\np/Elita:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Uncle KUp???&quot;said a little voice  while Kup Helped Tucson mo=\r\nve &quot;is he Tucson? do he have news about my dad and mom?&quot;es\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, littl=\r\ne one&quot;said with sad nesKup &quot;When he recovers he can tell us more about your=\r\n Mom and Dad&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; the little sable cat, meowed sadenned and she walked =\r\nslowly, she hoped that her parets would came back this time... \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fro=\r\nm: Preston Carroll \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 14, 2010 12:33 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: Back to the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt; He puts a hand=\r\n on Lord Elder&#39;s Shoulder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That goes for you too, Lord Elder.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns to Kup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yes Kup, I&#39;d really like to know how =\r\nthis all happened.

There was something\n&gt; about the young Autobot that made him=\r\n more reassured. He didn&#39;t know\n&gt; if Tuscon really was a Prime, but he cert=\r\nainly seemed more than just\n&gt; average soldier.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns his attentio=\r\nn back to Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I wish I didn&#39;t have to wait so long for Op=\r\ntimus to re awaken. But a voice just gave me the advice I&#39;ve been meaning t=\r\no hear for a long time. Ughhh.... Uh ohh, energy&#39;s down again. I - think I =\r\nneed a recharge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stumbles while getting to his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord E=\r\nlder reached out to catch Tuscon as he stumbled. &quot;You certainly\n&gt; push your=\r\nself like Prime used to. I have seen the historical\n&gt; documentation of some=\r\n of the old Primes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup nodded and said &quot;sit down my friend this is=\r\n a large tale &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get you a flow of energon *first*&quot; Elder said a=\r\ns he helped\n&gt; Tuscon to his feet, &quot;and *then* you can listen to Kup&quot; Elder =\r\nsaid as\n&gt; he glanced at Kup. &quot;After all, we don&#39;t want to push you too hard=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
