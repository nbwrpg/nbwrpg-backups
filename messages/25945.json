This waiting was idiotic! The Alliance could have devised a plan to \noverthrow the Maximals by now and have carried it out right behind the \nMaximal&#39;s backs! He hated this!\nDinobot growled in a deep steady tone, his optics narrowing and glaring \nacross what field was between the Alliance and himself. Though it wasn&#39;t \nlong before his scanners had detected that the Alliance captives, which had \nbeen inside of the Cybertronian Fire, had escaped and waited at the shields \nfor the Maximal commander&#39;s orders to drop them.\nThis was a very edgy time for everyone and he listened as a voice spoke over \nIronRaptor&#39;s communicator, telling nothing more to him then what he already \nknew. The order to drop shields...and if so done...would leave the base \nunprotected and vulnerable to enemy attack. A very complicated decision he \nwould guess, as in the inner workings of the mind and as not in the actual \nanswer given.\nDinobot shifted again. He needed something to do. It wasn&#39;t fair to have the \nenemy so close and not be able to slag them as he so much desired. For their \nmech-fluid to spill onto the ground as his already had once that day. \nHowever, he waited.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
