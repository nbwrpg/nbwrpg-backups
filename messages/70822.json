Finally he smiled, &quot;You would think I would send you\nthere just to take the base after you have it?&quot; Cryotek shook his head\nmaking tsking noises.\n\n&quot;Ahh, then it is your choice.&quot; He shrugged casually as he gestured at\nHydras, a look sorrow passing over his features for a moment.\n\nCryotek glanced at the dark form of Obsidian, &quot;You will take your\ntroops then as will Jetstorm. If you need any back up Tankor will be\non standby.&quot;\n\nObsidian nodded once at Cryotek, &quot;It will be as you command.&quot; He said\nquietly. With a last glance at Hydras he turned to leave the room,\nalready on his radio calling Jetstorm. Meanwhile several female mechs\nthat looked like they would turn into some sort of all terrain vehicle\nstepped into the room and flanked the door as if on guard duty.\n\nCryotek turned to look at Hydras, &quot;Now then you were wanting something\nfrom me again? Ahhh yes, a spark in my holdings. Hmmmm, what do you\nhave to give in exchange then?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
