I tried to get more weapons from Phobia.  He gave me a \n&gt; rifle and I returned as fast as I could to help you Commander \n&gt; Megatron.&quot;  Se could tell things were going to get ugly, very quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron and Waspinator retreat into the cave and slam the iron \n&gt; clad door \n&gt; &gt; closed behinde them. Megatron was mad with Kitkat. It was her fault \n&gt; this was \n&gt; &gt; going on. But, the bot must be an important bot if they want it so \n&gt; bad.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Kitkat! What the hell do you think your doing?&quot; He demanded, \n&gt; ready to \n&gt; &gt; pummle her with his closed fist. His eyes were closed into little \n&gt; angry \n&gt; &gt; crimsome slits.\n&gt; &gt;     Waspinator ran to the control boad and began to initiate more \n&gt; autoguns \n&gt; &gt; and re-routed power to the shields. He then turned to see if \n&gt; Megatron was \n&gt; &gt; going to beat Kitkat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Aracnia oversaw the construction and was pleased. The shield \n&gt; generator \n&gt; &gt; was up and functional, and already they had twelve double barrle \n&gt; auto-guns. \n&gt; &gt; And with the forest around them, they had a great advantage.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Alright, Im going inside. Tarantulas you come too. I want to \n&gt; find out \n&gt; &gt; who these aliens are and why they made this bunker.&quot; She said, \n&gt; opening the \n&gt; &gt; hatch and getting ready to climb down.\n&gt; &gt;     Tarantulas walked over, &quot;Very well. I would like to investigate \n&gt; this new \n&gt; &gt; technology myself.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     Thw two arachnids entered the bunker and climbed into the \n&gt; darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
