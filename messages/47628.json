The only thing I liked about beast machines is the new way of \ntransforming and the way cheetor had to fight. But I am asking nicely please \njust lay off of him the ones that been around know that yanshosh would never \nhave allowed most of this (no offense rauq).\n\n\nand to the leader of the maximal would it be ok if one of my guys (icedemon) \nbe the second in command to the maximals\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n"}}
