One minuet you&#39;re trailing behind me the \nnext there&#39;s no sign of you. What happened?&quot;\n\n* Carnage sighed as she got to her feet and shook her body, obviously the \nfall wasn&#39;t that pleasant!*\n\nCarnage: &quot; Some jack-ass raptor jumped me from the side and tried to attack \nme, then when I attacked back it began to scream all these things like, &#39;Get \nout&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re on my land&#39; sort of stuff.&quot;\n*Carnage snarled, she could still remember the smell of the clone and the \nway it spoke. It sent a shiver down her spine, it was SO MUCH like Dinobot \nthat if it hadn&#39;t been a female Carnage would have been sure that it was \nhim.*\n\n* Teltoli cocked her head to one side and raised her ears.*\nTeltoli: &quot; Was it a bot, a Maximal?&quot;\n\n*Carnage bared her teeth.*\nCarnage: &quot; It is a bot but I doubt very much if it was a Maximal.It was to \nharsh then suddenly to cowardly. You know, when I attacked it back the only \nthing that it did was yell at me. That&#39;s it, yell at me.&quot;\n\n*Teltoli sighed, again they had had contact with another bot and again it \nhad to be spoiled by....*\nTeltoli: &quot; Carnage? What made the other bot leave?&quot;\n\n*Carnage looked at and flexed her figures, it had been hard swinging from \nRage&#39;s jaw like that and she didn&#39;t care to do it again!*\nCarnage: &quot; Some Tarbosarus burst from the forest and grabbed the other \nraptor, it was beginning to eat it like it was some sort of tasty treat or \nsomethin. Of course, I had to save the damn thing and when I did the jerk \nflew off without a word of thanx!\nLast time I ever do it a favor!&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
