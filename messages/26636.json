My name is David Smith, older brother to Michael Smith, or who \nyou know as minime_316@.... Michael&#39;s been having problems \nwith his life since he left your group, and finally had to find away \nto come to terms with himself. I&#39;m sad to say that about 2 weeks ago \nmy brother Michael took his own life. He mentioned in his note to \ntell all of you how much you meant to him, and to atleast make him \nfeel like he belonged to something for awhile. Michael wished The \nCouncil well, and for his friends Kingler, Logo Alloran and Soulstice \nto remember him. Not weep for him, but remember him. He&#39;s found \npeace, and I&#39;m sure wherever he is, he&#39;s happy. He just wanted you \nall to know that he thought the time he speant with you was very \nspecial. Thank You.\n\n\n"}}
