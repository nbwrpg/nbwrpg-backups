The cave was small but it would suit them for the\nnight.\n\nGetting into a sphinx position, Pegasus laid his head down, his horn resting\non the ground.\n\n~Am I doing the right thing, getting involved in the Beast Wars?~  He\nthought to himself.  ~I don&#39;t like to fight.

A cave it was then.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Here!!! Found a cave!!&quot; She yells to Pegasus half a minute later. It was\nfairly big, but with a smaller entrance so it wasn&#39;t as exposed to the\noutside. It was nice and warm inside.. insulated. Kit thanks her good luck.\n&quot;Whoo!&quot;\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
