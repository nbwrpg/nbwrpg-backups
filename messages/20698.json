He \nfollowed the scent to her. He could still hear her words in his head \nwhen she called to him. &quot;What&#39;s become of you?&quot; He thought, curiosity \nflooding his mind.\n\nHe heard a voice over his comm. Veratis wanted an update on the \nsituation. &quot;I found her&quot; he replied, getting her back was going to be \nthe diffivult part.\n\nThree clean up drones aproached scanning her. A needle came out of \nthe first one and headed for Ice. \n\n&quot;No&quot; Lunarpine yelled as he grabbed hold of it, It was trying to \nneutralise the virus. He knew that if that happened she&#39;d be dead. \nVeratis reprogrammed 2 of the drones to help get her back. Lunarpine \npicked Ice up on his back and with the help of the drones began \ncarrying her back.\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was about to pass out where she lay. She felt a presance close \nto \n&gt; her. She opened her mind and heard the thought of Lunarpine. He was \n&gt; close to her. She smiled. She could read in his thoughts that he \n&gt; still cared for her. A smiled crossed her face. She sned out the \n&gt; mental message,&quot;I&#39;m over here.&quot;\n&gt; Then she slipped into sleep. The snow half covered her, but the red \n&gt; puddle was growing under her. It was ver visible, despite the \nfalling \n&gt; snow.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine fought his way through ice and snow to find her. \nNothing \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; stop him from finding her, He&#39;d travelled to far and worked to \nhard \n&gt; to bring\n&gt; &gt; her back to let her succome to a virus. The bloodstains in the \nsnow \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; getting larger. Her wounds had opened worse. The half wolf was \n&gt; determined to\n&gt; &gt; return her to Veratis&#39; base without any harm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile Foxfingers flew across the sea to the country where \n&gt; they&#39;d landed.\n&gt; &gt; He was far enough away from Predacon territory to risk a \n&gt; transmission.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Foxfingers to home, I&#39;m on my way back with lots of goodies.&quot; His\n&gt; &gt; hoverboard switched into high gear as he streaked across the \nwater.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis heard the transmission and replied in kind. &quot;Where the \n&gt; underworld\n&gt; &gt; have you been? You should have been back long ago.&quot; He hesitated \nto \n&gt; deliver\n&gt; &gt; the bad news to him, Things were falling apart before his very \n&gt; eyes, The\n&gt; &gt; virus was loose, Lunarpine still hadn&#39;t found Ice and Lady Hawk \n&gt; still hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; returned. The bleak news echoed through his memory like a chiming \n&gt; bell.\n&gt; &gt; Things just couldn&#39;t get much worse.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Foxfingers slowed down when he heard the news. He remembered the \n&gt; tracking\n&gt; &gt; device on his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve accompanied me far enough Preds.&quot; \n&gt; He flew\n&gt; &gt; low and dropped it on the icy beach. The tracking device still \n&gt; functioned,\n&gt; &gt; The Predacons could track him this far, and he wasn&#39;t worried \nabout \n&gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; else.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
