Myrmidon glanced at Trelos\nnoting that he had no intention of stopping. Myrmidon could only hope\nthat Hydras would see this and reign him in, he had other things to\nworry about, like dealing with this intruder.\n\nHe shifted only slightly as the warning shots came from the intruder,\nhe ignored them as he began speaking once more. &quot;NO! It is you who do\nnot understand the peril you are in.&quot; Myrmidon&#39;s voice is smooth, deep\nand authoritative, the sound of a warrior, one who is loosing patience.\n&quot;You will collect no bounty here without the concent of Hydras MASTER\nof this base!&quot;\n\nMyrmidon shifted slighty as he spoke, lining up on Malice yet keeping\nthe base behind him, &quot;You will either stand before him or you fall\nbefore us! The choice is yours!&quot; Myrmidon smiled slightly as he was\nready for battle, and almost hoped that this intruder would refuse, his\nclawed hands opened and closed, eager to begin!\n\nOOC: Remember, Myrmidon is floating. Shots at his feet will just pass\nbeneath him . . . if I understand your meaning??\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n--- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Predacons are in no way my descentants!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Malice switched his beam rifle for the larger and more powerful beam\n&gt; cannon and fired a shot at trelos.  Myrmidon would recieve a shot at\n&gt; his feet and Malice flew transverse his flight path to put all three\n&gt; in front of him.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m a bounty hunter. And I&#39;m here to collect my bounty.  My fight\n&gt; isn&#39;t with you, but if you insist on standing in my way, I&#39;ll have to\n&gt; hurt you a little.&quot;\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
