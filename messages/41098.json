Dewboy read it, please.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Lynxiz / Lokk / Axis ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Axis brightens as he spies Windlord. &quot;There he is, right over \nthere. \n&gt; See?&quot; Having helped Lynxiz, Axis turns to talk to Seekker, \n&gt; snorting in disagreement with his assessment of the battle. &quot;Bah, \n&gt; you did almost nothing, and when you acctually did that \n&gt; something, it hurt US more than THEM. Hehe,&quot; Axis laughs once, \n&gt; then shakes his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lynxiz smiles as she spots Windlord as well. Nodding to Axis, the \n&gt; thanks him, and proceeds to make her way between missile \n&gt; craters and other obstacles on the battle charred ground in front \nof \n&gt; the Chivitron base. Heading towards Windlord, she waves to try to \n&gt; get his attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lokk stops and turns slightly to regard Grounded, his face grimly \n&gt; showing agreement. &quot;Yeah... that will be ugly... ugly be \n&gt; necessary.&quot; He keeps heading back to the base, his path taking \n&gt; him towards Windlord.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Dewboy, your poll (the one below) needs to be altered. First \n&gt; off, Zardus doesn&#39;t alter or delete biased polls that aren&#39;t \noffensive. \n&gt; Secondly, he doesn&#39;t alter, and hasn&#39;t altered, biased polls so \nthey \n&gt; represent the opposite bias (though i believe that it depends on \n&gt; who&#39;s point of view you are coming from.). If the poll isn&#39;t \noffensive, \n&gt; then Zardus most likely won&#39;t delete it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Next thing. Did you read all of my post entitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # \n&gt; 41061)? If so, I will ask you again, did you read all of my post \n&gt; entitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? If you still answer Yes, then I \n&gt; will ask you for the last time, did you read all of my post \nentitled \n&gt; &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? Since you posted for your characters \n&gt; finding the Rocak ship, the answer to my question is obviously no. \n&gt; Now you&#39;re going to have to hold (this time, don&#39;t actually post) \n&gt; your posts regarding the Rocak ship. Then you must send the \n&gt; council a detailed list of weapons, capabilities, size and \ncapacity. \n&gt; Ok? =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Last thing... Ok, I&#39;m done for now, until I think of something else \nto \n&gt; say. =P\n&gt; \n&gt; On 30 Jul 2001, at 11:19, nbwrpg@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the \n&gt; &gt; nbwrpg group:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does Zardus have a right to alter \n&gt; &gt; biased polls so they represent the \n&gt; &gt; opposite bias or should he just delete \n&gt; &gt; them like offensive polls? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   o alter \n&gt; &gt;   o delete \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To vote, please visit the following web page:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/polls \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note: Please do not reply to this message.
