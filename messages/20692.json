She lay on her side, feeling \nthe soft snow fall onto her white fur. She starting to feel cold, for \nthe first time.  She had lost a lot of blood and was now feeiling the \neffects of it. She could see her breath in the cold air. \n\nShe then thought she caught a scent on the wind. It reminded her of \nLunarpine. But she thought her tired mind was playing tricks on her. \nShe closed her eyes and fell unconsious in the snow. Just on the \nother side of the ice field. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine pressed on through the snow and ice, he found a fresh \ntrail of\n&gt; blood on the ground. He picked up Ice&#39;s scent and continued \nforward. He came\n&gt; upon what appeared to be a frozen river. he could see a hole in it. \nHe\n&gt; feared the worst, if she fell in it could spread the virus even \nfaster. He\n&gt; contacted Veratis hoping the old bot would put his fears to rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No sign of the virus in the water.&quot; Veratis said with a sigh of \nrelief.\n&gt; He&#39;d lost her on his scanners but could still give Lunarpine a \ndirection to\n&gt; head in in order to find her and bring her back.He hoped she was \nonly a\n&gt; carrier and not a victim. Veratis knew that Lunarpines body was \nimmune to\n&gt; the virus, unless it had mutated inside Ice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine was relieved at the close call, he again transformed, \nthis time\n&gt; into his half wolf stage and began moving. He&#39;d lost a little speed \nbut\n&gt; gained strength which caused him to move a little faster, he could \nforce his\n&gt; way through the snow more easily than run through. He howled to the \nsky\n&gt; hoping Ice would get the message and come home. He missed Shadow \nWing. He\n&gt; didn&#39;t get to know Ice, and now he might never get the chance. He \nmight have\n&gt; shed a tear if the freezing winds hadn&#39;t frozen his ducts. This was \nlike he\n&gt; remembered his crash site was like in northern canada. A frozen \nwonderland\n&gt; where he&#39;d met her, now it was his turn to search for her, He was \nglad, he never thought he&#39;d have the chance again.\n\n\n\n"}}
