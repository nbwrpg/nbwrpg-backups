To get the &#39;plans of the ship&#39;, \nyou&#39;d either have to do what BrightBlade is doing, or what Feline and \nSkulletron are going to do. Phobia might have some of the ship scanned from \nhis visit, but the jammers would most-likely have prevented him from getting \nmore than half.\n\n::Striker::\n\nStriker raises an eyebrow.
