She located the \n&gt; engineering section, the prisoner holding cells, the main \nventilation \n&gt; supply systems, lab and hanger bays.  She was just wondering \naround, \n&gt; looking rather lost and not sure of where to go.  She eventually \n&gt; found the Med bays and went to the console.  She looked around \nfirst \n&gt; to make sure that no one was looking. Then, she opened up the \nconsole \n&gt; pad and started to look for info on the bot Nightlight.\n&gt; \n&gt; She soon found what she was looking for. THe original bot known as \n&gt; nightlight had been here. Was reprogrammed and into another bot. \nShe \n&gt; was about to find the name when she heard a noise. She closed out \nthe \n&gt; computer terminal and made a rather loud sigh. &quot;Drat. I try to find \n&gt; the map to find my way around and this stupid computer won&#39;t help \nme. \n&gt; All it does is bring up medical stuff to which I know nothing \nabout. \n&gt; By the PIT won&#39;t this bad day just end already.&quot;  She whined a \nlittle \n&gt; and turned to leave. Her head low and her shoulders drooping a bit, \n&gt; just incase someone was watching.\n\n\n"}}
