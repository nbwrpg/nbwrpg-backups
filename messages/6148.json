He\nslumped\n&gt; his shoulders. He thought, if something happened to her, it was going to\nbe\n&gt; in his hands, and Megatron would blame him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was getting mad. He had little patience when it came to things like\nthis.\n&gt; He began to pace around his around. He had no one to lash out on, so he\nhad\n&gt; to choice but to tense up, which led to  his pacing.\n&gt;\n&gt; He had to get a hold of her some how. But then a logic thought hit this\n&gt; brain. Comm-link. That was stupid! Why didn&#39;t he think of it before?  He\n&gt; forced himself to calm down, because from experience, he learned not to\nget\n&gt; made at a Predacon female. With Predacon females, a tough male could\nalways\n&gt; loose his dignity.\n&gt;\n&gt; He opened his comm-link to Stingtra, trying to stay calm. &quot;Stingtra, ya\n&gt; there?

He wasn&#39;t a bot\n&gt; &gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speed or that much endurance. He could follow a bot for miles\n&gt; &gt;following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their tracks and their signatures, but running after them wasn&#39;t\nsuch\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea. He was just too worried that Stingtra would just get herself\n&gt; &gt;into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trouble again. Then it would be his hide Megatron would have.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He coughed and looked around, searching for the sight of Stingtra.\nHe\n&gt; &gt;knew\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she was around, sensing her signature near-by.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stingtra?&quot; A part of him told him go back to the cave and leave her\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inferno alone.
