Why would this \nbot(Quickstrike) who cared nothing for her, hated her even, would risk his \nlife for her.  WHy the hell did she kiss his cheek like that? she thought.  \nShe made a face at remembering that horrable mistake.\nShe knew that the other bot Scorponok hated her as well.  She suddenly felt \nalone.  She thought that if they hated her so, would they help her out if \nshe got into trouble?  Maybe not, she thought.  She wondered if she even had \nan ally in the Predacon camp.  She shook her head knowing that she didn&#39;t.  \nshe knew her orders and was going to carry them out as best as she could.  \nBut she knew that if she found trouble, she was as good as slagged.  No one \nwould help her.  She was a tough little bot.  But she knew that in this \nlarge group of Predacons, she was alone.\n\nShe spotted a glittering object off in the distance.  She pointed at it.\n\n&quot;See that Scorponok?  Let&#39;s go over there and check it out.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
