You have to admit the targets were a \n&gt; logical choice in order to start a war. If they had succeeded in \n&gt; killing the top officers of the US armies, the president and did \n&gt; destroy (as they unfortunately did) the WTC, it would have meant a \n&gt; political and economical paralysis for the US, as well as a TOTAL (and \n&gt; I mean it) loss of morale for your country... even worse than it now \n&gt; is. May the souls of the dead find peace and the most lethally wounded \n&gt; find it soon so they dont suffer. \n&gt; BTW:Im usually not in favor of war (in this case, its not another \n&gt; country so US cant declare war) but I dont think it can be avoided. In \n&gt; the case it comes sooner than expected, then good luck surviving it...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ah hell...
