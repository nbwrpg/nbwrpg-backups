It was \ninteresting, time had no been effected at all....\n    &quot;This would be an excellent time to go and finish Kitkat.&quot; Hell Beast \nsaid, looking to his commrad. Megatron seemed very perky with the destruction \nof the Ark.\n    &quot;We need to find her first. Dont worry....my plan is falling into place. \nSoon, the Maximals will be no more, and the Predacons wil lrule this planet!&quot; \nHe sneered, looking at the image of Kitkat on the computer screen. He had \nbeen looking at her history from the old records. Somehow, he couldnt stop \nthinking about her.....he was fascinated by her.\n    Hell Beast turned the image off, and gloated, &quot;I could have found her by \nnow!&quot; He said, stood up, and paced the cramed room.\n    Waspinator, Gremlin, and the two remianing Maximal counterparts watched, \nhoping for a fight. The minions had nothing better to do....now that the Ark \nwas destroyed.\n    Megatron narrowed his eyes, &quot;Hell Beast.....you need not concern yourself \nwith my affairs. You will get what you want, I guarentee it. All I ask is \nthat you cooperate.&quot;\n    Hell Beast said nothing and exited the chamber, with Gremlin trotting \nloyally behinde him. Megatron sighed at his departure and returned the image \nof Kitkat to the screen. And watched.\n\n    Nighteyes walked around the base...it was quite. HAd she gotten lost? Was \nthis Kitkats base? She walked into what she thought was the bridge and looked \naround...&quot;Hello? Commander Kitkat? I want to join you....? I can tell you \nwhere Megatron is? Hellllllo?!&quot;\n\n    Aracnia ghasped with the destruction of the Ark. She didnt understand why \ntime hadnt be altered.....like when Megatron had tried the same manuver back \nin the old war. She quickly went to the monitor and located Cyberclaw, \n&quot;Listen, I need you to go to the Ark and find out what the hell is going on. \nYour the most skilled in covert tasks like these....and staying out of sight. \nDo you think your up to it?&quot; She asked, because she wanted Cyberclaw on her \nside.\n\n"}}
