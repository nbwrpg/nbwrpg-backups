He cried out &quot;KIT KAT!&quot; he flew \noff in \n&gt; great speed. He saw them quickly. he noticed that the horsmen had \nfollowed \n&gt; him. He looked to peastelense. &quot;Use your  ability.&quot; he nodded and \nhe shot his \n&gt; famous arrow. It hit near some of the alliance members. It was \ncoded to send \n&gt; a virus through all surronding enimes. This would not hurt kit kat \nor the \n&gt; others for it was formatted not to. It would only keep them in pain \nfo 20 sec \n&gt; at most. So the horsmen flew down yelling for the retreat and \ndestructor \n&gt; grabs kit Kat by the arm and starts to fly away.\n\n\n"}}
