It&#39;s just that, well, I miss all that I used \nto do.  I mean, I miss the feeling of the pack. Everything is so \ndifferent. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to get you down.&quot; She kisses his \nhand and closed her eyes.  She missed that wonderful feeling of being \nin love as well.  She did still love him, but, her programming was \ndifferent now.  Now she had the urge to kill the maximals more than \nto be in love with Drillbit.  Little did she know that the prgram was \nSquizzy&#39;s idea. \n\n\n\nFeline::\n&quot;OK, pick a place and we&#39;ll meet.&quot;  She looked down, she still had \nthe wings he had given her.  She smiled at it. &quot;Yeah, when can we \nmeet and where?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask KillFest, and DarkFate. In a minute.&quot;\n&gt; He knew what was wrong, she missed the Command spot.\n&gt; He placed a hand on her cheek.\n&gt; &quot;Dont look so down, love. It doesn&#39;t suit someone with your looks.&quot;\n&gt; He smiled, and kissed her.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, recap. Maximal Matrix turns me good. I try to stay with you.\n&gt; Alliance reprograms you to forget me. As soon as I&#39;m starting to \nbring\n&gt; back your memories, Zardus gets suspecious, and tryes to kill me. \nThats\n&gt; why I&#39;m here. I cant come there because You&#39;ll be meeting scrap \nmetal\n&gt; then. We need a place thats not in our sides territory.&quot;\n&gt; He then hears the other part.\n&gt; &quot;New form? I can wait.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: For sentamental purposes, Feline still has the Autobot pilot\n&gt; &#39;wings&#39; that Hot Rod gave her.\n\n\n"}}
