He felt the cut through his tail. It cut \noff the very bottom and that was all. The dna of dark mouse healed it over \nquickly so the pain was in and out in a matter of a minute. The bot had \nslipped out of his hands.  He jeted full speed. With the bots slow speed due \nto damage he was able to reach the ground right before the bot did he was \nbehind him now. The bot didnt see him move because he was in the  \ntransformation  to his beast mode and back to robot mode when he made his \nmove. He caught the bot as he landed.  His arms with  full force through each \nof his sides with his sharp dragon claws digging in. His tail wrapped the \nbots legs pulling him down on the ground. The bot was severly damages. His \nmech fluid flowed in galvatron&#39;s body.  He had fallen with the bot with his \nhands tearing up his internal machinery. In the middle of the fall to the \nground galvatron&#39;s mouth had opened to its full length and chomped the bots \nintire head and pulled straight up. His jewel had been glowing with an \nenormous light since the cutting of his tail. Due to the immense power up the \ngreen energy  it blaste in two diffrent directions with equal power to the \nfirst. One hit the bots lower back the other cutting through the bots right \nleg. With such damage he should be in stasis lock soon enough.\n\n"}}
