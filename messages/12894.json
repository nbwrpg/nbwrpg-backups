Brix starts to get a feel of the \ncontrols, while Fliq contactes Spears.\n\n&quot;Hey Spears! It&#39;s Fliq. We&#39;ve got the shuttle, and we&#39;re about to \nleave the Cybertronian Fire now, so we&#39;ll be back at The Ark in a few \nhours.&quot;\n\nBrix turned to Fliq.\n\n&quot;You know, Ramulus helped us alot to get you into that body, Fliq, \nand we never paid him back. So why don&#39;t we show him some gratitude. \nWe can name this shuttle, The Ramulus!&quot;\n\n&quot;Are you sure? Because Ramulus said the idea wouldn&#39;t work. It would \nbe like making fun of him for being wrong.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright, so it won&#39;t be called Ramulus, but we should combine \nRamulus with something else. Someone who&#39;s debt we owe.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Iron Raptor risked her life trying to save me from Bronco, so \nlet&#39;s bring her name into it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got it! We&#39;ll name the shuttle, The Iron Ram!\n\n&quot;Perfect! Now let&#39;s set a course for The Ark!&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq wait for Kluster to open the bay doors.\n\n\n"}}
