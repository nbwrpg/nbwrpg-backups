She had to admit that he was a bit slow but he was \nfast enough to keep her on her feet, as she dodges out of the way of yet \nanother swipe she aims her pistil the best she can and hires at his chest.\nShe then danced out of the way of another slash but then grabs both of \nTankorr&#39;s arms, careful to avoid the blades and smiles at him...*\n\n&quot; Care to dance?&quot;\n\n* She puts her weight into a push that should at least bring him off of \nbalance, she laughs...this WAS fun!*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
