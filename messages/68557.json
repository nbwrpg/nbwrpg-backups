Why would someone rush headlong into an enemy &lt;BR&gt;base,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; knowing that they would quickly bring to bear all the security&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n measures&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that had on the intruder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Pressing button on the control panel beside the room door he &lt;BR&gt;checked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the condition of the room. The result was of course a single&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; occupant,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and that the room was totally shielded and powered down. So the &lt;BR&gt;room&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that could be an arena for battle was now doubling for a temporary&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; cell. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Perceptor&quot; Myrmidon called over the short range intrabase&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; communications, &quot;Report to my location, I believe I have our &lt;BR&gt;intruder&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pinned.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As Myrmidon waited went back to staring at the door as he crossed &lt;BR&gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; arms over his massive chest, his optics &lt;BR&gt;narrowing. &quot;DECEPTICON! !&quot; He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; called through the door to malice, &quot;You were a fool to enter this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; base.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What are you looking for?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (Myrmidon)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@ &lt;A href=&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; target=_blank&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hearing and detecting the security measures being implaced to &lt;BR&gt;keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him in the room, he could safely change forms. Now in classic &lt;BR&gt;form,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he lie in wait behind a stack of crates. He drew his swords and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; smirked. Now he just had to find Rodimus. Nothing works better &lt;BR&gt;than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a ghost from the past.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ &lt;A href=&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; target=_blank&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, April 3, 2008 5:54:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; Subject: Re: Black Fortress&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With widening optics Myrmidon watched as the would be opponant &lt;BR&gt;flew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inside the base, some how shooting past the other defenders. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Fool!&quot; Myrmidon growled.
