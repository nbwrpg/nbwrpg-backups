She had met this bot from the council.  Why \nwould the council be concerned with the beast wars or Megatron unless \nsomething else was happeneing as well.  She looked at Drillbit, then \nto Phobia. She didn&#39;t like this feeling that was growing in her gut.  \nher instincts were rarely wrong. She looked at Phobia. &quot;Phobia, where \nare we meeting the others? Also, do any scanners here have the \ncapability to find Megatron&#39;s signal.  Megatron has had enough time \nto get other bots to join him by now. I want to see if maybe Megatron \nhas recuruited any other followers.&quot;\nShe had no idea why her instincts were screaming at her, but she \ncouldn&#39;t ignore it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;   &quot;I know..but like I said we have lost all contact with cybertron. \nI fear \n&gt; something horrible has happened.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
