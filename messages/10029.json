We&#39;ve fought back a few attacks, and the shields havn&#39;t \neven gone down once!&quot;\n\nHe slides one arm around her waist, enjoying the feel of her against him. He \nwas a bit damaged, his comm-link was melted to his arm, and cracks in his \narmor were slowly leaking mech fluid, but he&#39;d be allright. He looks into \nIron Raptor&#39;s eyes, still smiling, his optics full of his love for her.\n\n&quot;Kluster might be too busy right now to assign you quarters. You can use mine \nfor now, I&#39;ll go find somewhere else to sleep,&quot; he starts walking to the \nCybertronian Fire, tugging her.\n\n&quot;Do you need a CR chamber?&quot; he asks her, concern in his voice.\n\n"}}
