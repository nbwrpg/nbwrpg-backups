Finally Lunarpine caught Grizzltrons scent. He dug through until he\nfound the other bot in stasis lock. Ice helped lift the injured bot onto the\nshoulders of the half wolf.\n\nThey forced thier way out just on time to see the top of the hillside\ncollapse into the caves below.\n\n&quot;Now what should we do with him?&quot; Lunarpine asked torn between saving and\nfinishing off the bot.\n\nIce smiled at the compasion Lunarpine seemed to be showing  even though she\ncould sense his quarel with himself. &quot;Veratis said to come get him, I think\nwe should take him back for observation.&quot;\n\nLunarpine checked the bots condition once more wondering if it was safe to\nmove him. realizing that there was no other logical choice he summoned the\ndrones, strapped one to Grizzltron and sent the other one over to Ice. Ice\nrefused the chivalrous offer knowing that Lunarpine needed it more than she\ndid. The mutant transformed to her owl form and started flying back towards\nNorway.\n\nLunarpine quickly caught up scooping her out of the air in his strong,\npowerfull arms. He had remained in half wolf mode for the added benefit of\nthe extra strength. As they flew Ice transformed to her odd robot mode and\nkissed the half wolf on the cheek. Grizzletrons drone followed closely set\non autopilot it made it&#39;s way toward home.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Beast Wars AKA Proto &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, June 24, 2001 6:04 PM\nSubject: Re: what ever happened to Grizzltron?\n\n\n(You can do what ever you want...)\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: what ever happened to Grizzltron?\n&gt;Date: Sun, 24 Jun 2001 01:27:06 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;Lunarpine smelled burning fur through the flames.

He went to stasis lock letting his internal repairs slowly\n&gt;heal him.
