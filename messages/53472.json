Possibly, there has been\n&gt; &gt; a warp through parallel universes when I came here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She smirked. &quot;Humans are humans. Pests.

YOUR tribes or factions have not done anything.\nBut in \n&gt; the future... that what I described will happen.&quot; She continued to\nmake her \n&gt; way to where ever they were going. &quot;If you know anything from Autobot \n&gt; history, in which this is actually father into the future, then you\nwould \n&gt; know what a Decepticon is.&quot; She was spilling more of herself than\nnormal. \n&gt; Perhaps in an attempt to confuse him if not educated the poor fool. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I have to admit, I have known a couple who were nearly worthy of\nattention \n&gt; by the Decepticons.&quot; she smirked glancing over at him. &quot;Nearly.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
