She \nsaw that the bridge was now completely destroyed.  Beams were fallen \nall around, metal and computer parts were scattered about. Part of \nthe autocontrol panel was melted.  She sighed. &quot;And I just got done \nfixing some of that.&quot;  She sank to her knees and looked at the \nremains of bridge.  She looked at her legs and noticed she had cuts \nall over her body. She jsut ignored it.  She was now to depressed to \nworry about herself.  She knew that was no longer any hope for the \nship.  It was already falling apart and now..this. She moved back \njust in time as a huge beam came crashing down in front of her.  She \nturned and walked back down the hall towards the entrance.  She was \nstarting to get really mad. She went from a walk to a dead run for \nthe ship entrance.\n\n\n"}}
