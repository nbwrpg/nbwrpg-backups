It seemed to be searching for hours but the spark had no concept of tim=\r\ne.  \n\n\nAs night fell upon the land, the spark returned like a prodigal chil=\r\nd to Megatron X&#39;s location, to where it found shelter and energy. \n\nFloatin=\r\ng through the halls and corridors - some darkened, some not - like a ghost,=\r\n it appeared almost as if to be exploring. But the light seemed to flicker =\r\nand dim.\n\nFinally the fiery spark returned to the chamber room where it was=\r\n being contained. Floating about the form that was still in consruction tha=\r\nt would one day soon house the spark before returning to it&#39;s holding vat t=\r\nhat nutured it and protected it. \nWithin the containment, it settled, float=\r\ning there, slightly pulsing then stopped as it remained a steady glow. \n\nTh=\r\nen a ghostly sweet reversed echo was heard, &quot;Where are you?&quot; it softly call=\r\ned, the tone sad and pain filled, as though alone. All alone. But who was t=\r\nhe voice was referring to or calling out to? \n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Even the mighty ne=\r\neded a respite, and Megatron X was no different. He had watched over the sp=\r\nark and the slow manufacture of it&#39;s new body. He had not gone far, now sta=\r\nnding still in an alcove in a dark lightly room. Cables, hoses, and clamps =\r\nheld him in place, replacing coolant in his systems, replenishing his energ=\r\non and refueling his weapons. It was cold, his form now could as ice with a=\r\n low fog hangin over his form. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; It was after the stanger left that =\r\nhe notified. Still physically immobilized, his consciousness came online an=\r\nd accessed the base&#39;s internal and external security network. Scans indicat=\r\ned the spark had competed it&#39;s body, and now had left. Odd, he not think it=\r\n would be able to do so. Perhaps it knew his security codes, or simply brok=\r\ne out. Switching to external sensors, he scanned all of the island of Hokka=\r\nido for signs of his guest.\n&gt; --- On Sat, 8/8/09, Lady Barbossa &lt;MaximaSR74=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Lady Barbossa &lt;MaximaSR74@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re=\r\nturning Home\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, August 8, 2009,=\r\n 12:52 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Arise, stand strong again,=\r\n warrior. Heed the call of Megatron.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What sounded like whi=\r\nspers for but a moment, broke away to silence. Then a ghostly reverse echo =\r\nthat whispered and barely heard. Soon enough was well heard. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Meg=\r\natron?&quot; the femme voice replied almost in disbelief. \n&gt; &gt; The spark pulsed =\r\na moment as though it were contemplating or something else. But definitely =\r\nfeeding off the energon. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I am most grateful for the energon and the r=\r\nescue.&quot; That calm deep femme voice stated. &quot;And honored to once again be in=\r\n thy presense, oh, mighty Megatron.&quot; Her voice sincere to every degree. The=\r\nre was only one whom she respected 100%... and that was Megatron. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I a=\r\nm forever in your debt.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The spark hummed with light, brilliant a=\r\nnd glowing, sparks of controlled energy in gold and blue. Glowing like a st=\r\nar in the heavens.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Silence overtook the vicinity once more. Darkne=\r\nss and silence. Not that it was a bad thing... but it wasn&#39;t a good thing e=\r\nither. \n&gt; The spark pulsed from time to time, feeding off the energy that w=\r\nas offered to it, recovering. \n&gt; It had recovered enough strength for the t=\r\nime being. Some sparks recalled past memories. It took some time, but this =\r\nparticular spark was able to recall much. The last moments it was functioni=\r\nng or alive was as some predacon to assasinate someone. And a name, a face,=\r\n a sensation seemed to reverberate causing the spark to pulse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nearby =\r\nthe spark, a chassis was being constructed. A large one. One nearly the hei=\r\nght of the original Megatron. As drone parts worked furiously upon the chas=\r\nsis, the spark pulsed moreso. The containment that held it, nurtured it, op=\r\nened and out floated the spark. \n&gt; \n&gt; Like a ghost, it wandered about befor=\r\ne leaving the facility. For the time being, the spark had forgotten about i=\r\nt&#39;s rescuer. But it would return. Soon or eventually.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
