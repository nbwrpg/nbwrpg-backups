He frowns, tightening the arm he had around \nIron Raptor. He was getting excited by her proximity, her stomach pressing \nagainst his, and her pelvic area very close to his own. He flies a bit lower, \na few shots hitting him.\n\n&quot;Drive ahead and pick up Tavatron,&quot; he says through his comm-link to Hot Rod, \n&quot;Then come back here for Iron Raptor. Hopefully Arcangel and the others will \nhold the Alliance off long enough.&quot;\n\n"}}
