He heaves a sigh and grits his teeth and thinks to himse=\r\nlf.\n\n&quot;Just as immature as the day he took the Matrix.  It&#39;s as I feared, he=\r\n wasn&#39;t ready for the responsibility and happened just to be at the wrong p=\r\nlace at the wrong time and now after having it taken away, he&#39;s not ready t=\r\no assume the responsibility of leadership.  On the other hand, it&#39;s my faul=\r\nt for not speaking up way back when.  Too laid back for my own good, and if=\r\n I knew Rodimus was going to be an aft about all this, I would&#39;ve come forw=\r\nard and made the pledge myself.  It all makes sense now, Rodimus isn&#39;t prep=\r\nared for this yet I am.  Although, I&#39;ve made some mistakes, and I admit it.=\r\n  But I&#39;m definitely learning from them and not taking it as some sort of n=\r\negative failure.  Just, a little bit of a set back.   All right Tucson Prim=\r\ne, you know what you have to do, so why the pit are you procrastinating?&quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson Prime then realizes that when he transforms, his wrists retract.  Co=\r\nuld he partially transform enough to get himself out of the hand restraints=\r\n?  Then he realized, transformation was impossible.  He rethinks for a mome=\r\nnt, and remembers the trick of making his wrists limber by taking them out =\r\nof joint and refasetting them after the trick is done.  He goes with option=\r\n B and does the same trick Nightshift had done on his own wrists.  Slowly h=\r\ne attempts it in his laying down position.  He moves his fingers around to =\r\nsee the easiest way on how to do it.  And then, with a slight pop, he disjo=\r\nints his wrists.\n\n&quot; Definitely something I won&#39;t be doing too often.&quot;\n\nIn N=\r\night Shift&#39;s cell, the same trick is being used, as he manages to get his h=\r\nands out of the shackles by the dislocation maneuver.  He pops both wrists =\r\nand all his internal structures back into place, and then rubs his wrists.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Ow, don&#39;t wanna be don&#39; that trick too often. That&#39;s torture.&quot;\n\nOutside t=\r\nhe fortress, Quickstride can feel a massibe rumbling in his stomach.  It wa=\r\nsn&#39;t Scourge that was scaring him, it was his overdosing of the gassy bean =\r\npods which was doing him in.  He remains in robot mode as he seems to bloat=\r\n a bit.\n\nRat Trap gasps.\n\n&quot;Uhhhh, ohhh...  This doesn&#39;t look too good and i=\r\nt ain&#39;t gonna smell too good in a fraction of a few nanoseconds!&quot;\n\nWithout =\r\nfurther a do, Quickstride erupts with a cloud of unbearable stench, which w=\r\nafts upward into the air.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;=\r\nsupercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Cel=\r\nl Block Control Room\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He hoped that by telling Rodimus as it was, he =\r\ncould snap him into realizing what damage he&#39;s doing to himself. Tucson Pri=\r\nme was very good at it, although his temper was something that he needed to=\r\n work on. He then turns his head away from the source of the sound.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot; That&#39;s it, I&#39;m tired of talking to you. I&#39;ve told you as it is, you dont=\r\n&#39; like it, that&#39;s tough scrap.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus stood up glaring at the screen=\r\n his mouth open wide in anger!\n&gt; His lips moved but for a second nothing ca=\r\nme out.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;YOU IDIOT!&quot; he said as he finally found his voice. &quot;YOU HELP =\r\nME? HOW\n&gt; WILL YOU DO THAT?!?&quot; Rodimus raged for a moment as he pounded on =\r\nthe\n&gt; panel, dust and flakes of debris leaped on the floor from the force o=\r\nf\n&gt; his actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally he sat down as a smile reappeared on his face=\r\n as he got his\n&gt; emotions back under control, &quot;You&#39;re going to help me from=\r\n the pit\n&gt; that you&#39;re in?&quot; He chuckled to himself, &quot;The matrix, what good =\r\nis\n&gt; that goiong to do anyone?&quot; he said, his voice almost thoughtful. &quot;I .\n=\r\n&gt; . I . . &quot; He stumbled for a second and then continued, &quot;I mean you\n&gt; lost=\r\n it, and now you have nothing to show buyt the darkness of that\n&gt; pit you&#39;r=\r\ne in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus smiled as he leaned back in the chair, proping his feet=\r\n up on\n&gt; the panel. However as self satisfied he felt, there was a strange\n=\r\n&gt; feeling in the pit of his stomach, one he was begining to feel more\n&gt; and=\r\n more often when ever he talked with this Tuscon fellow. His smile\n&gt; dimmed=\r\n a bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
