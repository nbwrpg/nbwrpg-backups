JP, what is your major malfunction?  Why can&#39;t you be courteous?\n&gt; If this gets me kicked out of the game, so be it. You are a sadistic\nbully.\n&gt; I&#39;ve really enjoyed playing this game, except for when it comes to dealing\n&gt; with you. Playing with people like Roborick and Yanshosh, and reading\nposts\n&gt; by Kinger and Airly is enjoyable. But you are a waist of my time. Why\nwould\n&gt; he do this to get out of a game, instead of just saying &quot;I Quit&quot; Even if\nit\n&gt; is a trick (which I dont believe it is, because I have more faith in\n&gt; people) isnt it safer to just be polite? Just from reading your posts, I\n&gt; knew you would do some kind of sick twisted thing like this. I feel for\n&gt; you, because you obviously dont have any redeeming qualities. Go ahead and\n&gt; insult me back, with your elementary bashing, and crude post. Nothing you\n&gt; say matters, cause everyone on this chat is levels above you when it comes\n&gt; to dealing with people. Go see a psychiatrist, because you are a royaly\n&gt; screwed up person. Get a life. Sorry everybody, but I have no patience for\n&gt; discusting scum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
