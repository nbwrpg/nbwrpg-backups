So, with a heave she ripped away a fair section of roof and \ndropped to the floor.\nThen converting back to robot mode, clad from neck to tow in the same black \nbattle armor, a leadway was opened to ALL Maximals which were positioned in \nthe holo-deck.*\n\n&quot; Playtime&#39;s over, kiddies. But Congrads to the survivors. We&#39;ll have to \nplay this again sometimes. Until then, go have fun until further notice.&quot;\n\n* From there the surrounding ship vanished, leaving a grid lined room where \nall could see eachother.\nIron looked all of them over...holding their weapons...before quickly \nturning to the side and exiting the room, blake cape billowing out behind.*\n\nCOMM: &quot; Your last message was garbled, HotRod. Could you repeat, please?\n\n* Leaving her commm open for reply, Her eyes turned to the walls of the \nMaximal City.\nIron Raptor had remembered Prowl telling her about the ship&#39;s mind. \nCyndro...he called it.  Probably just another Iris.\nBut...just in case:*\n\n&quot; Cyndro, report.&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
