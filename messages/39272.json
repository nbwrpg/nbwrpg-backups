Both CR chambres opened, and inhumane\ngrowls could be heard from both. Then with heavy thuds, a large\nMechanical horse stomped out, smoke protruding from where it&#39;s eyes\nshould have been, and it&#39;s mouth. It bent down, so as to fit throught\nthe rest of the chambre, and as it was out, unfolded large skeletal like\nwings, as it lifted it&#39;s front feet off the ground, then stomped them\ndown, causing the ship to shake from the sheer weight. It contineud to\nspit up dust.\n\nThen from the other chambre, a whirl of blue and red spun out at a\nlighting quick speed, landing on the wall. At and angle hanging off of\nthe wall, an anamalistic growl began to laugh and cackle, it sounded\nlike three different types of animals at once, and grated like glass on\na chalk board. It was a mechanical Hyena, both eyes flaring blood red,\nas oil began to drip of it&#39;s razor sharp fangs, talons protruded\neverywhere, some were slicing into the wall as he laughed. He then leapt\nagain to the ground, and paced around Longhaul, growling, his one eye,\nwhirling in and out at the Constructicons.\n\nOOC: Okay guys, I&#39;m off.\n\n"}}
