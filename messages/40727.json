Outside 10 of \nthe bases autoguns(which isnt much, the base has a ton), open fire on \nelecto with 5 shots each, sending a total of fifty autogun blasts at \nher. This same visual was being played to darkfate on the wall of his \ncell.\n\nElsewhere, Windlord&#39;s shots are halted by a barrier of chaochitan \nenergy which then dissapeared afterwards. A second later he fires a \nthin beam of chaochitan energy at Windlord as he sends a com to \nUnitron.\n\nVampiza: &quot;Come with me... I can take you all to a safe place.
