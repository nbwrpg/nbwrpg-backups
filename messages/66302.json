If a=\r\nnyone would be kind enough to fill me it \n&gt; that would be swell.  For examp=\r\nle, is there a homepage anymore?  How do \n&gt; I create a character?  Yadda Ya=\r\ndda Yadda?  It might be a lot to tell so \n&gt; in order not to create to many =\r\nmessages it might be best to contact me \n&gt; on yahoo messanger at hugar_twri=\r\nker, MSN at kmaddo3@..., or AIM at \n&gt; thecrowlord. Of course if you want I =\r\nguess you can just reply to this \n&gt; meassage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hugar=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
