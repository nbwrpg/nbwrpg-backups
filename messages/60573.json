He tried to look behind him, but the weights prevente alot of \nmovement. \n&gt; &quot;Well, I suppose in order to complete this mission, I will have to \nuse unorthidox methods to do so.&quot;\n&gt; He then sat and waited, waited for his host to return.\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare/Unicron::\n&gt; \n&gt; Blacknightmare conenected the alarms and an energi field \nsorrounded \n&gt; him in order to avoid his scape.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron&#39;s main room was circula, in midle of it was a Holograma \n&gt; where appeared Unicron&#39;s Head. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Report!!!&quot; commanded Unicron&quot;Have you destroyed Maximals?????&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague/ Malice:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague glared at Blacknightmare.

Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero \n&gt; tempatures \n&gt; &gt; of space.  The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing \nthe \n&gt; &gt; airlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the \n&gt; ground.  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a room, \n&gt; &gt; someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.  His left shoulder \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of \nsemi \n&gt; &gt; organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.  Hellplague look \n&gt; &gt; disapprovingly at the sight and then turned to Splattercannon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you \ncan \n&gt; &gt; repair him.  I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.  For a \n&gt; moment \n&gt; &gt; they both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before \nthem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; Necross \n&gt; &gt; said before turning to leave.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before \n&gt; &gt; addressing him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.  For whatever purpose, \n&gt; she \n&gt; &gt; wants him alive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his \n&gt; &gt; companion&#39;s grip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Not my problem.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon fumed a moment as Necross set off for parts of \n&gt; &gt; Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon storage.  \nHe \n&gt; &gt; gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s \nnew \n&gt; &gt; residence.  He dumped them all around the hunter and went to the \n&gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \n&gt; somewhat, \n&gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.  \nHe \n&gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \n&gt; settled \n&gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to \nit, \n&gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder immediatly \n&gt; &gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \n&gt; &gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and \nscooted \n&gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back onto \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles \nand \n&gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on his \n&gt; &gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \n&gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his arms \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and straddled \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting herself \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; her arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little lizard \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a \ndevious \n&gt; &gt; smirk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
