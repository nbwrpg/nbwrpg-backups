Hysteria out.&quot;\n\nHysteria had slowly been tapping out the comands in order to reroute as much \nof the reserve power as possible. In order for this to succeed she&#39;d have to \nfind a way to stabalize the shields. At most they&#39;d last a few seconds \nbefore completely failing or closing the section. It was worth a shot.\n\nCF COMP: Reroute complete. Ten seconds until shield is inoperative inenemy \n&#39;bots&#39; vicinity.\n\nHysteria opened a comm to the Alliance &#39;bots inside the shields:\n\n&quot;Attention Alliance &#39;bots, once the shields are dropped you will have \naproximately ten senconds until they are reactivated. Tech &#39;bot out.&quot;\n\nHysteria tapped out the final command and waited as the shields in front of \nthe Alliance &#39;bots dropped, leaving that one section vulnerable as the rest \nfluctuated dangerously.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
