Spelled s-c-a-n-n-e-r-s, I \nbelieve. Anyways, they&#39;re mysterious devices that can pick up the \nenergy signatures of things, and they just happened to pick up your \narmy of bots departing from a base, so that&#39;s how the Alliance knows \nthe location of your base.\n\n::Supernova/Flare/Scrap/Vycir/Slasys/Zardus::\n\n&quot;Their weapon grid is online.&quot; Reports Vycir as the two jets approach \nHell Beast&#39;s base, scanning ahead. The defences that they picked up \nwere nothing to worry about. The Galactors were designed for almost \nany type of battle situation, and attacking a base was one thing they \nwere good at.\n\nThe two jets spread out, their scanners keeping track of the EMP \npulse cannon.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t get close, simply fry them from afar,&quot; Supernova orders, that \njet making a sharp right to fly away from the base, leaving two \nmissiles heading for it. The Vycir/Slasys jet makes a sharp left, \nfiring several laser bolts at the shields.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus frowns, looking at the scanners and watching the Galactors \nengage in combat. He doubted they could take the base alone, but he \nhad hoped that the move would have drawn Hell Beast back away from \nthe CF. It didn&#39;t. But no matter, he had other cards to play.\n\nZardus taps a few keys, opening a comm channel to DrillBit. DrillBit \nhad some rather negative dealings with Hell Beast before, though \nZardus didn&#39;t know as much as he would have wanted about the \nsituation between those two grroops of Predacons.\n\n&quot;Commander DrillBit,&quot; he says over the comm, &quot;This is Commander \nZardus of the Alliance. My troops are currently attacking Hell \nBeast&#39;s base. I believe a joint attack on him would benefit both our \nfactions. Our troops fighting together would undoubtedly be able to \ntake his base without too much trouble. I await your responce.&quot;\n\nZardus sits back, looking at the base monitoring systems for more \ninfo on the Unitron situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Hell Beast and his small army of Predacons regrouped on the \noutskirts \n&gt; of battle, shy one arachnid. &quot;Where is Tarantulas damn it?&quot; Hell \nBeast \n&gt; bellowed at the others.\n&gt;        Aracnia steped up. &quot;We encountered some Allience fighter \njets on our \n&gt; way here. They somehow magically know where our base is and are \ngoing to \n&gt; attack it even though they dont know where it is, or how its \ndefended. He \n&gt; went to go and man the defense systems.&quot;\n&gt;        He nodded. Zardus was such a tempermental bitch \nsometimes. &quot;ALright \n&gt; Predacons, pick a target on the CF and blast it to smitherines!&quot;\n&gt;        With a crack of missle fire, the Predacons dispersed and \nbegan the \n&gt; assult.\n&gt; \n&gt;        He entered the base quickly with the blast doors slamming \ndown as \n&gt; Tarantulas ran. He entered the bridge and looked around. The bridge \nwas \n&gt; pratically alien to him. He raced around looking for the defense \nsystem \n&gt; computer.\n&gt;        As he sat down, he brought online the defense grid and was \npleased \n&gt; with what he saw. the compliment of weapons at his disposal made \nTarantulas \n&gt; think twice about if he should just take the base over for himself. \n&gt;        An EMP Pulse Canon was what he was rather pleased with. One \ndirect hit \n&gt; to one of those jets with this would incompasitate them definetly. \nThe \n&gt; autoguns were activated, the half dozen or so missle turrets came \nto life, a \n&gt; shiled rose, and the laser canons were charged and ready.\n&gt;        Flare, Scrap, Supernov, Vycir, and Slasys&#39; signitures came \nup on the \n&gt; scanner. Tarantulas&#39; claws flew over the control panle as the \nweapons \n&gt; targeted the squad. The sun was getting ready to disappear behinde \nthe \n&gt; distant mountians and when it did the light show would begin.\n&gt; \n&gt;        With a crack of Energon lighting, the six bots landed at the \nnorth end \n&gt; of the CF. Obviously the desnse grid would be up, but if they could \nmake it \n&gt; inside and turn it off then the other bots would reduce the ship to \nruble.\n\n\n"}}
