And as a Prime myself I\n&gt; wish to see this change follow through faithfully. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head in Leo Prime&#39;s direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Earth is not our home but Cybertron is. We must right the wrongs that have\n&gt; been committed and send the Predicons and Decepticons to an exile that will\n&gt; prevent them from ever returning to this planet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He too, with the faceplate and near voice pattern of Optimus Prime, Tucson\n&gt; Prime turns his head to everyone in the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If I&#39;m not mistaken Char is still inhabitable. I suggest we do as Leo\n&gt; Prime suggests and round up our adversaries and exile them to Char as soon\n&gt; as we can all manage.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME nods, &quot;Yes that is a possibility that we have been\nconsidering. Good, good thinking Tuscon Prime.&quot;\n\nHe turned as another hand was raised, smiled and gestured for STRAIGHT\nSHOT&#39;s comment.\n\n&gt; Straight Shot raises her hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If we&#39;re gonna pull it off, a certain Prime is gonna need his sight back.\n&gt; Tucson Prime always does so much for all of us.  The least we can do now is\n&gt; make him whole again.  &quot;\n\nThe was another nod from LEO PRIME, &quot;Yes, medical help for all of us,\nyes that is something that we need to emphasize. Good.&quot;\n\nLEO turned to acknowledge LORD ELDER as he also raised his hand.\n\n&quot;We must not forget that the threat of Unicron is still out there.&quot;\nLORD ELDER&#39;s voice was grave as he spoke. &quot;While we are rounding up\ncriminals, a way must be found to deal with him and his minions.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME&#39;s face was thoughtful as he listened. &quot;You bring up a good\npoint Lord Elder.&quot; LEO turned to face the audience, &quot;That is one of\nthe reasons why we are having this discussion.&quot; A frown briefly traced\nitself across his fetures as he continued, &quot;This will be the most\ndifficult task, one that the council members even now are still\ndeliberating on.
