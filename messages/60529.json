Not in pain, but rage.  Her arms were not severed, but \njust \n&gt; as useless.  They hung limply at her sides, as she fell back, two \n&gt; Sweeps came and picked up their master.  Another came and picked \nup \n&gt; the critically damaged Organics.  The Sweeps carried them into the \n&gt; air and hung, as a Sweep attempted to repair Hellplague&#39;s arms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Organics nearly passed out as Proto launched his ambush.  Though \nhe \n&gt; succeeded in disabling Hellplague, an edge of th metal sheet dug \ndeep \n&gt; into Organics&#39; back, disabling her wings and limited the use of \nher \n&gt; legs.  The Sweep who retrieved her roughly grabbed her about he \nwaist \n&gt; and jerked her with it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Necross rushed up and and opened fire with his acid blaster and \n&gt; missile blaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Malice let a low gowl slip fom his throat.  \n&gt; &quot;If only I had Sunstorm or other Seekers..!  This has gone on far \ntoo \n&gt; long!&quot;\n&gt; Malice turned his hateful glare to those who did not move.\n&gt; &quot;Stay back cowards!  Interfer, and I send you to the Allspark!&quot;\n&gt; He then marched forward, Chaos Breaker ready, and charged the \n&gt; minions, Proto, and the Sweeps, not caring who was in his way.  \nAll \n&gt; that mattered was the safe return of his sister Organics.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Proto&#39;s liquid form had been following cracks and sensing his \n&gt; taget until he was there.

She was injured, in enemy hands, and now almost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unconscious.  Hellplague had her off the ground, her feet mere \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inches from the dirt.
