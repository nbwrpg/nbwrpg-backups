But what of my troops? Are they \nstill alive?&quot;\n\nSquizzy::\nShe wasn&#39;t sure how to answer the question. &quot;Uh, well, from what \nlittle information I have gathered, they are no longer on the list of \ntargets.  They may be all lost. I&#39;m not sure. You can double check \nwith Zardus when he gets back.&quot;\n\nKitKat3::\nShe lowered her head. Then Drillbit and my pack must be dead then, \nshe thought to herself.  She felt her spark sink at the thought.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Whoops, sorry, my fault.

A ship such as that \n&gt; would be a great addition to the Alliance, if they were friendly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Welcome, Mortem,&quot; Zardus says, walking forward toward Mortem. &quot;I&#39;m \n&gt; Zardus, Alliance commander.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
