With a swift motion he\n&gt; transforms, now clutching a sword in his left hand, the top of his \nhead and\n&gt; side of his left arm smoking incredibaly, where the armor was hit \nfrom his\n&gt; foes. He levitates from the ground towards the airborn Recklessa, \nnot much\n&gt; of an expression in his doom stricken eyes. &quot;You my friend,&quot; he \nstarts to\n&gt; boom, his voice different from before, much more hollow, and devoid \nof\n&gt; kidness, &quot;are quite a pain in the tailpipe&quot; flying towards his \ntarget with\n&gt; murderous intent in his eyes.\n\n\n"}}
