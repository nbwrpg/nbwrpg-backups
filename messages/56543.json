But was the only one that did not burn up \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;into crispy atoms as it descended in the form of a great revolving fireball \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;down towards the flat grasslands of ancient Africa. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;The local wildlife having the intelligence enough to run for their pitiful \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;little lives as the alien metallic behemoth rocketed towards them. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Those aboard hanging on for their OWN pitiful little lives. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� AH! WE�RE ALL GUNNA DIE!!� Dust Storm screeched as he hung onto whatever \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;he could, Dark Cloud included as he floated virtually in zero gravity and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;felt the temperature rising. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;He clung for dear life to the jet plane�s leg and began to sob. � I DON�T \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;WANNA DIE!!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Suddenly the little dune buggy opened his optics and found that he was \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;floating right beside a porthole and could see the yellow grasslands rushing \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;up to meet them, and he suddenly became calm and even smiled. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�Hey�what�s that?� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;To him it looked kind of pretty�but then he realized what it was and all \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;senses of calm completely escaped him. � WE�RE GUNNA HIT IT!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;But by then it was too late and ship struck ground HARD. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Skidding along the open fields like a flat stone over a tranquil pond, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;opening up the earth like a sharp scalpel before it finally lost momentum \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;and came to a slow stop. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Only to spew fuel from its 2 massive, broken tanks down the backside of the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;charred hull, fiery red hot enough to catch on fire. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Although, by then the 4 Decepticons inside had gathered enough wits about \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;them to vacate the area immediately and escape from their possible demise. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Running for their lives out into the bright sunlight of prehistoric Africa \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;just as the very vessel they�d piloted only minuets ago exploded into \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;nothing but wasted pieces of slag. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;They all watched from a distance as it burned. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�I�m glad we weren�t in there when THAT happened.� Blue Flame commented as \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;he stood alongside his Commanding officer at the other 2. Who all seemed to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;be quiet for a moment and contemplate the true words of the blue semi-truck. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Because it WAS true. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;They�d lost their ship, but they would have lost their lives if they�d acted \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;a moment too late. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;But still, Blue Flame had to sigh in disappointment. � But now what are we \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;going to do? We lost our research and I don�t even know where we are.� He \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;finished, looking around at the foreign planet they�d managed to crash on. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Everyone else did the same. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Mountains loomed up to the East and yellow African plain stretched out in \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;every other direction as far as the optic could see. Marred by the odd \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;skeletal tree, but that was about it. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Diesel Runner planted her hands onto her metallic hips and studied their \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;surroundings closely as the crackling fire of their ship burnt behind them. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� That tare could have taken us anywhere. Because, if you all remember, our \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;research recorded that it was a flux in space AND time. So we could be on \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;any planet, in any time period. And this place is beginning to look more and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;more familiar the longer I look at it.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;�How so?� Blue Flame asked, the other 2 of their team also looking to the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;broad back of their Commander. Although she continued to look out towards \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the horizon. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� I mean, I�ve seen pictures of this place before back at the Research \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Academy. Or at least a place that looked like this.� She said while \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;gesturing with her hand towards the landscape. � This place reminds me of \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the pictures of ancient Earth millions of years before our Ancestors awoke \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;and started the Great War. See what I mean? There�s active volcanoes over \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;there.� D.R. pointed to a plume of steady smoke rising up from a great \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;distance away. � Although 9 chances out of 10, I�m wrong since our exit \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;factor of that tare was random. This planet is still generally young, and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;those volcanoes prove it.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Sand Storm walked up to stand beside the towering black and Decepticon and \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;clapped his hands together. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� I can�t WAIT to study this place!� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;D.R., although this was no time for light-sparks, couldn�t help but feel the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;same way. But still� �Maybe later, Sand Storm. But right now, we have to \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;salvage what equipment we can from the ship. I think all the fuel�s burned \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;up now and it�s reasonably safe.� She said as she turned back and observed \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;the dying embers of what was left. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;� Though, it�s going to take a while�.� \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;_________________________________________________________________ \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
