He tries to re assure her with a gentile han=\r\nd on her shoulder.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s all right Nightlight, you&#39;re safe, don&#39;t worry, w=\r\ne&#39;re gonna do all we can ta help you out.  That&#39;s a promise.&quot;\n\nRat Trap thu=\r\nmbs up.\n\n&quot;CR Chamber&#39;s ready for Windlord.   Okay buddy, when you wake up, =\r\nyou&#39;re gonna feel right at home.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot knew she had to meet up wi=\r\nth Kup quickly.  And she knew that she had no vehicle mode or air craft mod=\r\ne to transform into.  Just her luck, she was not far from where Quickstride=\r\n was, as he was with Legacy and the others.  Quickstride lifts his head and=\r\n spots her.\n\n&quot; Guys, look, it&#39;s another Autobot.  She looks like she&#39;s wavi=\r\nng toward me.  Legacy, I&#39;m gonna go see what she needs.&quot;\n\nHe canters up to =\r\nStraight Shot and stops to offer his back. She smiles.\n\n&quot;I thought I recogn=\r\nized ya.  Quickstride, right?&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s me.  Hop on, where to?&quot;\n=\r\n\nShe hops onto his back, and grips his long, copper mane.\n\n&quot; I need ta get =\r\nback ta the Ark, ta meet up with Kup, he has something Tucson needs and tha=\r\nt I&#39;m gonna bring to him.&quot;\n\nHe looks to her.\n\n&quot;Say no more we&#39;re there.  Ho=\r\nld on, my gait isn&#39;t exactly the smoothest.&quot;\n\nShe holds on as he bolts towa=\r\nrd the Ark.\n\nMeanwhile, Tucson Prime manages to get Talon&#39;s message.  He wa=\r\ns happy to hear her voice.\n\n&quot; Strange day this is turning out to be isn&#39;t i=\r\nt Talon?  I&#39;ll remain put so you can find me easilly.  Legacy has just loca=\r\nted me along with Perceptor.  I&#39;m in one piece, but I&#39;m not so sure about R=\r\nodimus. I hope he&#39;s all right.  Anyway, I&#39;ll look forward to a little down =\r\ntime with you as soon as this is behind us.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Perceptor.  Again=\r\n more gears turn.\n\n&quot; Perceptor, I&#39;d like to thank you for your help and you=\r\nr willingness to return where you felt most intimidated.  To me, that is no=\r\nt the way of a Predacon, but the valor of a Maximal.  And no, it&#39;s NOT an i=\r\nnsult, it&#39;s a complement.  I&#39;m sorry you have not had the experience of hav=\r\ning a formal complement, and I promise you what I say I mean.  Your help is=\r\n valuable and I can not put a price on it.  Speaking of your help...  Did -=\r\n you by chance create the shell program?  If so, perhaps you know of a way =\r\nto reverse it.  Anything you can help us we&#39;ll gladly take, and we will pro=\r\ntect you if need be, from Hydras.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime unlike Hydras, didn&#39;t need=\r\n the power of oppression to win his comrades, and he knew that he couldn&#39;t =\r\nforce anyone to do anything they didn&#39;t want to do.  And he always expected=\r\n himself to return the favors that are given to him. Perceptor&#39;s help was v=\r\naluable he knew he&#39;d have quite a debt to pay to him once everything was sa=\r\nid and done.  He holds out a hand to Perceptor.\n\n&quot; Legacy, please note that=\r\n from this day forth, although Perceptor is of a different faction, he has =\r\nhelped us greatly.  Therefore, we must always keep our doors open to him if=\r\n he needs our help and our protection.  Enemy or not, he has risked his own=\r\n spark to help us and that is something we must all honor.  Perceptor, I wo=\r\nuld personaly like to shake your hand in a show of peace and Neutrality.  Y=\r\nou&#39;ve earned my respect as a comrade and shown us selflessness and the abil=\r\nity to cooperate with the opposite faction.  The choice is yours Perceptor,=\r\n and I respect what you choose.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston =\r\nCarroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Perceptor looking to Legacy said, &quot;i dont know you, but I&#39;m going to go d=\r\nown\n&gt; &gt; and bring the primes back, or at least one of them&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy nod=\r\nded, &quot;Come, we must do all that we can to secure the primes.\n&gt; Without them=\r\n then all is lost.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a short moment before Legacy and hopefully P=\r\nerceptor are able to\n&gt; catch up with Tuscon at the edge of the tunnel. His =\r\nside is much\n&gt; easier to penetrate as the sides are more sloping, as if mad=\r\ne for a\n&gt; vehicle to drive up from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steam is venting from the tunnel e=\r\nntrance making it very difficult to\n&gt; see as apparently water and magma are=\r\n meeting violently somewhere much\n&gt; further inside this tunnel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ahead =\r\nof Tuscon very little can be discerned as the steam seems to\n&gt; billow out l=\r\nike smoke, but up ahead what sounds like metal scraping on\n&gt; stone can be h=\r\neard as if something is being dragged, but quickly\n&gt; enough the sound stops=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
