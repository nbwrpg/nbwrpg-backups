Jackle, Pheniox, and Black Aracnia, along with Transanulas manned \nthe computer systems. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Damn it, Quickstrike is in he systems agian. My \ncomputer is going beserk.\n\n::: JAckle takes out his pistol ::: I say we finish him off for good!\n\n::: Gremlin ::: Pheniox, Jackle, go after him and kill him for good. Black \nAracnia and Transanulas and myself will try to fix the computers.\n\n::: Jackle and Pheniox burst out of the control room. They run down the main \ncorridor to Quickstrikes position. :::\n\n::: Pheniox ::: He should be in here. Ready?\n\n::: Jackle nods and opens the door. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Yes, the Newcomers. In my opinion, if we join our forces \nwe can totally out number them. \n\n::: Megatron ::: Or, we could treaty with them, and crush the Maximals!\n\n::: Hell BEast and MArine glance towrds Megatron ::: It seems that you want \nto make a juncture with them for your own gain.\n\n::: Megatron ::: They came from Cybertron, and they came to mine energon and \nset up a colony. In months we could have this planet under our control! We \ncould enslave the humans, and mine this planet dry. The Auto-bots would be \nour hostages. No one would dare stop us.\n\n::: Hell Beast nods ::: Yes, good thinking. But they did try to kill us. I \nwant to at least let them know we are in charge here, that we are the big \nguns. We need to make them nuturel.\n\n"}}
