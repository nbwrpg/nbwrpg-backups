It was very \ninteresting to see just what her reaction would be and how her mind would be \nable to try and get as much of information of what little she had offered to \nthe cutting board.\nCarnage nodded to Teltoli but then looked at her as if she had just \nremembered something when the fuzor spoke up of her age.\nOld? OLD?!!\nShe glared. She was NOT old! She had just lived through a lot and that could \nware a bot down over a bit of time.\nCarnage growled.** &quot; I&#39;m NOT old. Just weathered.&quot; ** Her tone was almost \nflat but there was a hint of amusement in it.\nShe looked Teltoli over and wondered just what was ticking inside of the \nwoman&#39;s head right about now? Probably something which was trying to figure \nout just how she had gotten here without just coming out and asking about \nit.\nBut she could wait just as long as anyone could, but the questions would \ncome eventually.\nCarnage sighed. Old? Slag! Leave it to a younger bot to call her that!\nShe had to admit, she wasn&#39;t as young and flexible as she use to be but old \nwas a rather harsh way of putting it.\n: Ah! Just face it! You&#39;re getting old there, girl!:\nCarnage winced. She wasn&#39;t old! Just...not as young as she once was. \nWell...she wasn&#39;t in her twenties anymore...and the thirties were running \nout pretty fast. But that wasn&#39;t exactly old...it was just the prime of ones \nlife. Now the sixties were old!\nCarnage snickered to herself. It was kind of funny to think that she was \nthinking about this now, really wondering just how old she would have to be \nbefore she finally admitted that she really was losing the youth. Ah well! \nThe body was one thing but the mind was another.\nShe shook a bit of the water off of her scales while trying to keep the pigs \non her back at the same time, finally thinking that it was useless since the \nrain would keep following for a little while. But it was just beginning to \nget dark and she would have to find shelter for the both of them soon, maybe \nroast up one of those pigs...even though she had planned to take them back \nand store them for later on. But she knew that she knew better then to go so \nfar for food that it would have to be eaten or rot before she got it back to \nthe swamps. She would hunt again before she got home. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
