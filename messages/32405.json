He was\nalmost twice \n&gt; her size, but she wasn&#39;t scared of him. Somehow, she knew that he\nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; fire on her and would take her to his base. It was a talent she had,\ntelling \n&gt; the future.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
