Kup mentioned\n&#39;blockade doors&#39; in his last post, and I just wanted =\r\nto be sure - are\nthose the same blockade doors as the Maximal base in the t=\r\nhird season\nof the show?  With the turrets and the cave?  Do the Maximals s=\r\ntill\nuse it as their base?  Does the surrounding area look the same, or has=\r\n\nit changed?\n\nGuess that&#39;s more than one question - but I dun wanna write a=\r\n post and\nthen get told &#39;dude, they so built a huge city around the Ark 15 =\r\nyears\nago, and it&#39;s not a base anymore&#39; and have to fix it  XD\n\nYes, I am l=\r\nooking for interaction, and since I have no idea how long\nthis battle is go=\r\ning to be going on for, I might just throw Shard in\nthere and let him blow =\r\nstuff up - course, he has no idea what&#39;s going\non, and might start shooting=\r\n the Maximals :)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Heya!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Okay Jdmy, take a look, let me know if th=\r\nat is how you like it! :)\n&gt;  \n&gt; As a possible suggestion though Jdmy, you a=\r\nre looking for\ninteraction, i would imagine all the firepower and energy th=\r\nat is\nbeing put out in that climactic battle should easilly be registered b=\r\ny\nyour sensors. (most if not all of the active characters are there)\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nFeel free to notice it if you like. Please keep in mind the Sweeps\nand Scou=\r\nrge do not register on sensors, but everything else, the\nfirepower the swee=\r\nps are laying down and all the bots, cons, preds and\nMaxi&#39;s in the area sho=\r\nuld be a siren for anyone in the area if they\nare so inclined. \n&gt;  \n&gt; As fo=\r\nr the rest of ya, weekends are really tough for me to post, so\nit might be =\r\nmonday for I get another out. \n&gt;  \n&gt; See you guys soon\n&gt;  \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
