But he follows them into the ship \nanyway, not trusting Vlad alone with this woman who was so kind to him.\nD peeked over Fenox&#39;s shoulder as she activated some computer screen, and he \nhad seen many in his life so he knew what they were. Just not how to use one \nvery well. That&#39;s what the people were trying to teach him before they \ncrashed, and he had been doing pretty well.\nThere were images of other metal being showing up on the screen as D looked, \ngrowling at Vlad again and baring his teeth.\nD sat back a bit, looking like a huge wolf statue as his tail wrapped around \nhis feet and he hunkered up his shoulders. The fur on the back of his neck \nrising and his eyes glaring at Vlad whenever he decided to look at him.\nHow could Fenox trust this guy?! Everything about him was wrong!\nBut D just sat there for a few more moments before getting up and moving his \nmouth so that he tried to get Fenox&#39;s hand in his mouth to lead her away \nfrom him.\nVlad was bad news, and he wanted her to be no part of it.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
