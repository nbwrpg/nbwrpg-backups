She scratches it absently behind the ear \nand looks at Vlad again.\n\n&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about anyone named Von, but the datatracks of the \nship have information on Megatron&#39;s crew, if you want to see that.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Vlad looked down at Fenox as she turned towards him, wondering \nwhat a large wolflike creature would want with a smaller fembot like \nher. She wasn&#39;t ugly but he wasn&#39;t interested either. However, Shesta \nseemed to like her.\n&gt; The dog/wolf creature padded towards Fenox slightly and moved to \npress her snout on the femms thigh, since that was her sign which \nindicated that she wanted to be petted.\n&gt; Vlad, on the other hand, simply ignored what Shesta was doing and \nwent forward with his words. \n&gt; However, it might prove wiser to try and find out if this woman \nknew anything about Von and if he was still alive. There was no point \nin getting a hitman if his brother had passed on.\n&gt; Vlad cleared his throat and leaned in towards Fenox ever so \nslightly.** &quot; I&#39;m looking for my older brother, Von. From what I \nremember of him he&#39;s tall and fierce in appearance. I was wondering \nif you knew him or where he&#39;s located.&quot;   *** Vlad leaned back a bit, \nhis optics still trained upon Fenox.** &quot; If it&#39;s any help he was one \nof the first to crash here with Megatron. After participating in the \nGolden Disc theft.&quot;\n&gt; ** He hoped that she would know who he was talking about, it was \nmuch more easier then trying to search for his spark signature. Which \nwould be like looking for a needle in a haystack.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
