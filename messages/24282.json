But I never knew you were \nso passionate about it. :)\n\n* Iron Raptor was disappointed to see that Perndabot had sliced through her \nslashes, but there was plenty more where that came from!\nWith her feet pounding against the ground she neared her targits location, \nsword in hand and her muscles tightening for contact with his blade.\nShe wouldn&#39;t have known it if she had been any deeper in battle, but the \nsame thing which had taken her over during the fight with Shadow was doing \nthe exact same thing now. Only more slowly and cunning.\nAne even as it slowly creeped up on her, she already knew what ahs was going \nto do to get the upper hand on this.\n\nIn mid-stride Iron Raptor picked up her pace, her legs pumping against the \narmor and her feet against the ground, gaining speed.\nThe weakest part of an enemy...their eyes!\nIron Raptor&#39;s scanners suddenly detected another bot which was flying at \nher, opening fire and sending shots at her.\nBut she had this bot to deal with first.\nBreathing lightly Iron Raptor suddenly brought herself to a skidding stop \nright in front of Perndabot, making sure that a whole lot of dirt and dust \nsprayed up as she slid onto her side.\nLaying on her back for a moment as she shots fired at her from above \nexploded on the ground all around her while others went overhead.\nBut she growled and quickly got to her feet, jumping back from Perndabot and \nthen looking up into the sky.\nWhere she saw Nemisis Enforcer, just in time to see that all of the shots he \nhad fired at her had not all came to her location yet.\n\nIron Raptor growled as one of the shots mannaged to strike her in the \nshoulder-plate, making it swing back slightly while the shield expanded from \nher arm and she braced herself. The shield easily withstood the remainder of \nthe charges as they struck her.\nThen, peering over the top of the armor and sure that all which was coming \ntowards her had gone, she retracted the shield and brough up a pair of guns \nwich folded in from behind her shoulders ( much like transmetal optimus \nprimal&#39;s did.)\nIron Raptor quickly locked her fingers around the joysticks which were \nhidden behind plates of the same armor which her suit was made out of. The \ntop braced and attached at her shoulders.\nPlanting her feet firmly against the ground  her index fingers pressed hard \nagainst the triggers on the sticks, sending a wave of shocking charges \nupwards towards Nemisis.\nThe kickback from the guns almost knocking her from her feet.\n\nHer eyes narrowed from inside of her helm. *\n\n&quot; Surprise!!&quot;\n\n* She had to admit, she had quite a few new tricks up her sleeves!*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
