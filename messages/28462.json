She not only hated heights but she was ready \nto bound away from Menasor before he would have crushed her and now her \nmuscles ached a little from not leaping like they thought they were supposed \nto.\nLooking up at Prowl she hissed at him, then heaving a sigh and looking down, \nseeing the land fly away from under her feet...way...way down below her.\nThe battle was going pretty well now, the alliance, or most of it, had gone \nand now there was only half that many bots to deal with.\nShe sighed again and kicked a little, not liking it when her feet couldn&#39;t \nbe touching something. But she had to admit, it was a neat side effect that \nwhen she transformed into her SBM that Prowl did too.\nIt made her feel not so alone. Being the only alien on the planet before and \nall.\nBut in this case, Prowl was acking in instinkt and not his brain and she \nmight have to teach him how to master this mode, just like he would have to \nteach her how to fly in robot mode.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
