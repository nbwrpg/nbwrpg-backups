This should sum up\nan\n&gt; end to that battle.\n&gt;\n&gt; The shots hit Necromancer like a tap on the shoulder. Being the same size\nas\n&gt; most of the gestaults had it&#39;s advantage. He stopped chaseing Ignatius and\n&gt; glared down at Zoe. &quot;Brave attempt for an enemy, I respect that.&quot; he\nshouts\n&gt; down. Raising a mighty claw shakeing  one pointed finger toward her he\n&gt; smiles, &quot;You can go now, I&#39;ve had my fun.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dragon turns away flying back toward the cave where the chase had\nbegun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ignatius landed near Zoe gasping for breath. He&#39;d pushed himself to his\n&gt; limits to avoid being lunch. &quot;Lets head to base, you can follow me.&quot; The\n&gt; eagle again took flight heading north toward  the future sight of Cairo\n&gt; where he&#39;d rest up until his strength returned.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: *Orchid* &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 3:29 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Reinforcements/Enemy Reinforcements\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zoe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Zoe runs off.
