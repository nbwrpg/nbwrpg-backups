He raised his tail, firing a spray of acid.  He \n&gt; watched as the \n&gt; &gt; shots and all but one shell were intercepted.  The shell struck \n&gt; him, and he \n&gt; &gt; laughed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raised his left pincher, firing off two energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missiles \n&gt; &gt; at Torca, tow of the same type from the other pincher at Sky Lynx.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Manterror was struck by numerous blasts, sending him crashing to \n&gt; the ground, \n&gt; &gt; not moving.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Injector flew up, avoiding the missile heading for him.

He \n&gt; raised both \n&gt; &gt; arms, firing two stinger missiles from both launchers, two at \n&gt; Torca, two at \n&gt; &gt; Sideswipe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sixshot watched as the missile heading for him was intercepted by \n&gt; an optic \n&gt; &gt; blast.  He rolled, three shells digging into his left shin, mech-\n&gt; fluid \n&gt; &gt; leaking.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raised boht weapons, firing off four hypersonic blasts at Sky \n&gt; Lynx from \n&gt; &gt; his left blaster, and four of the same kind at Sideswipe from the \n&gt; other.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ares fired off two optic blasts at the incoming shells, two \n&gt; knocking him back \n&gt; &gt; a few feet as they went off against his chest plate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He raised his grenade launcher, firing a grenade at Torca.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sun Crusher dodged the missile by flying fast, eight shots \nsending \n&gt; him \n&gt; &gt; twisting through the air.  He raised his rifle as he balanced out \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; switched it to automatic fire, 20 laser bolts lancing out at \nTorca.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reflector was struck by four shells, two in the left shoulder, \ntwo \n&gt; in the \n&gt; &gt; abdomen.  He cursed as his armor was cut through.  He fired off \n&gt; four laser \n&gt; &gt; bolts from his rifle at Tavatron.  He then fired ten rapid optic \n&gt; blasts at \n&gt; &gt; Sky Lynx.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Minion pulled hard left in his jeep, the missile missing but \n&gt; shrapnel cut \n&gt; &gt; into his front right light, breaking it apart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He fired off twenty-four armor-piercing rounds at Sky Lynx, 12 \nfrom \n&gt; each \n&gt; &gt; cannon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chaos fired four five-foot long missiles at the CF, one from all \n&gt; four of his \n&gt; &gt; missile tubes in his missile truck mode.  -Have to keep a good \n&gt; portion of my \n&gt; &gt; missiles-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nemesis continued crawling, spotting Blades.  He sped up his \nspeed \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; crawling.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scattershot flew through the air, looking at the CF and the \nslaggin \n&gt; shields \n&gt; &gt; that had came back online.  He raised his right arm, firing off \n25 \n&gt; explosive \n&gt; &gt; shells at the CF.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Raising his left arm, a missile launcher appeared from subspace.  \n&gt; He fired \n&gt; &gt; off a rocket from the weapon of war at port side of the CF.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ===\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Firestarter continued flying, firing off two rockets from both \n&gt; wrist \n&gt; &gt; launchers, the four missiles heading for the bridge door that had \n&gt; been locked \n&gt; &gt; down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vehement sighed.  These heathens were irritating.  He turned \n&gt; around, raising \n&gt; &gt; both arms.  With the left barrel that made up most of his arm \n&gt; launched a \n&gt; &gt; missile, followed by another, heading for the armored computers.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turned his attention to the hole in the CF from whence he \ncame, \n&gt; firing off \n&gt; &gt; two missiles at the hole, knowing his missiles would strike the \n&gt; shields if \n&gt; &gt; left alone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unitron raised his laser rifle, firing off four bolts at the \nsealed \n&gt; door, \n&gt; &gt; followed by a single optic blast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, in the main entry door of the CF, in its exact middle, \n&gt; the horn \n&gt; &gt; missiles continued sending out a shock wave of sonic energy to \n&gt; weaken the \n&gt; &gt; stability of the metal around it.\n\n\n"}}
