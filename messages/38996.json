Thank \nyou.\n\nSecondly, trying to remember, my NUMBER ONE problem with Canada is their \nhumor.  Anyone in Canada who finds the show &quot;28 Minutes&quot; amusing is deranged, \nidiotic, retarded, brain damaged, comfortably numb (that&#39;s a song! :L), and \nneeds to be jumed and wheed until it hurts.\n\nThirdly, when Quebec revolts because they want to be part of France, a very \nstrange and unusual idea, who will be helping kick their ass?  Uncle Sam.  \n\nForthly (my last one, I swear), Canada can pump out all that lumber because \nthey are bigger than the US and I believe their population is 170 million \nless than our own, so not a need of reality.  And they also produce hella \nwheat.  Not weed/mary jane/pot, but WHEAT.\n\nThank you.  Enough with the OOC and BIC crap, take your Canadian bashing \nantics to hell or to private messages.  Thank you, and good night.)\n\n-L. Unitron\nNot meant to offend anyone, if you found it offensive it was Zardus that made \nme do it!  If you didn&#39;t find it offensive but inspiring, it was all my \ncreative brain at work.  If you find mistakes or flaws in what I&#39;ve typed, \nfeel free not to point them out.  \n\nThank you for your patience.\n\n"}}
