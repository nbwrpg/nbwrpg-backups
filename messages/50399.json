Why should I not just\n&gt; &gt; kill you now and \n&gt; &gt; be done with it?&quot; He finishes figuring that Flicker\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t know \n&gt; &gt; that they Preds had finished setting up their\n&gt; &gt; defenses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Off comm, &quot;Goood Perceptor, that means we now have\n&gt; &gt; two missile \n&gt; &gt; turrets, two laser cannons, and 4 auto guns.\n&gt; &gt; Sufficient firepower \n&gt; &gt; for the moment.&quot; He turns to Quickstrike as the\n&gt; &gt; cobra-scorpion fuzor \n&gt; &gt; enters the control room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Quickstrike. Notify the rest of the Predacons that\n&gt; &gt; they are to \n&gt; &gt; report to the control room. We will attack the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals soon \n&gt; &gt; enough.&quot; Megatron goes back to his scan, which has\n&gt; &gt; just finished. He \n&gt; &gt; examines the offensive/defensive capabilites that\n&gt; &gt; the scanners were \n&gt; &gt; able to detect. (your queue Kyle, I dunno how much\n&gt; &gt; horsepower the \n&gt; &gt; car that Flicker is driving has ^^)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The flickering pulse of a laser welder casts an erie\n&gt; &gt; glow around \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade&#39;s lab. The small black bot hadn&#39;t been\n&gt; &gt; out of the CR \n&gt; &gt; chamber long, but he had immediately noticed that\n&gt; &gt; further repairs \n&gt; &gt; were needed, since some of his parts were destroyed\n&gt; &gt; when Megatron... \n&gt; &gt; &lt;No...&gt; he thinks to himself as he finishes up the\n&gt; &gt; addition of some \n&gt; &gt; new parts to replace the old ones. Megatron was a\n&gt; &gt; problem which he \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t deal with at the moment, so he refused to\n&gt; &gt; dwell on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Clenching and unclenching his hand, he tested out\n&gt; &gt; some of the new \n&gt; &gt; joints, nodding to himself as they performed\n&gt; &gt; admirably as his \n&gt; &gt; request. The right side of his head no longer\n&gt; &gt; resembled the rest of \n&gt; &gt; his head, a smooth silvery surface now covered the\n&gt; &gt; right side of his \n&gt; &gt; head and flared out slightly behind his head almost\n&gt; &gt; like a crude \n&gt; &gt; drawing of a birds wing feathers. His right eye was\n&gt; &gt; now surrounded \n&gt; &gt; by the silvery material, and it had a dark,\n&gt; &gt; enveloping, reddish glow \n&gt; &gt; instead of it&#39;s original greenish glow, which his\n&gt; &gt; left eye still \n&gt; &gt; had. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His vision shifted into a red blur as he tested out\n&gt; &gt; the new eye. \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s infrared capabilities were excellent, and he\n&gt; &gt; wondered if he had \n&gt; &gt; the capability of shortening the wavelength even\n&gt; &gt; more. Shrugging \n&gt; &gt; carelessly, he moves onto the next part switch. His\n&gt; &gt; chest plating \n&gt; &gt; had been entirely destroyed in the blast, as well as\n&gt; &gt; his minor \n&gt; &gt; cloaking ability. Intead of trying to make another\n&gt; &gt; cloaking device --\n&gt; &gt;  which he didn&#39;t think he had the parts for anyway\n&gt; &gt; -- he had modifed \n&gt; &gt; a little thing he was working on. Something he\n&gt; &gt; called a Distort \n&gt; &gt; shield. Working in conjunction with two disks on his\n&gt; &gt; arms, it \n&gt; &gt; created a sort of protection field around him. THe\n&gt; &gt; only probem he \n&gt; &gt; could see with it was that even if it could block an\n&gt; &gt; attack, who&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; to say that the attack wouldn&#39;t have enough force to\n&gt; &gt; knock him \n&gt; &gt; around anyway. He hoped he didn&#39;t have to test it\n&gt; &gt; out in battle \n&gt; &gt; anytime soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade looked around his lab, and his eyes fell\n&gt; &gt; onto his \n&gt; &gt; pistols, which he put back into this hip ejectors,\n&gt; &gt; and then he sat \n&gt; &gt; down, waiting for a summons from Megatron, who would\n&gt; &gt; probably \n&gt; &gt; realize that the small bot would have gotten out of\n&gt; &gt; the CR by now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Flicker sends another transmission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Flicker:  I repeat we request permission to land.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
