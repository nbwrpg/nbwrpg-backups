I definitely need more sleep. Sorry guys, but I&#39;m running on about 4 hours of sleep since I stayed up most of the night getting my server back on the internet. Anyways, I think I confused everyone enough now, so I&#39;ll shut up with the OOCs after this one.\n\nAnyways, that post was for Azure&#39;s situation. I thought he was the one that asked if he could do whatever.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Ok, my last post was for Azure, not Airly.

Our (the council&#39;s) goal is to guard against moding, and that mostly happens with new weapons (that&#39;s why certain people are being bugged by us more than others). Mostly-storyline things (like reformatting Australia, which doesn&#39;t create a superweapon or anything, but creates an interesting area to RP in) are generally good.\n\n\n"}}
