Ah don&#39;t know what he want&#39;d wit&#39; ya, but maybe ah was stupid t&#39; even try! Ah got slagg&#39;d twice tryin&#39; to save ya, once when Transulas had ya strapped down, and th&#39; second time when ya were outside. Now, ah gotta ask you uh question, have ah heard ya b&#39;fore? Ah reckon ah may have &#39;cause me and boss-bot&#39;s group was on th&#39; run and ah swear ah coulda heard ya and smelt ya in this forest.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
