You have no right to bash G1.  Your \nlittle &#39;review&#39; of the Transformers movie clearly shows you have zero \nknowledge of G1.  Well, those of us that are responding to your lame comments \nhave knowledge of G1 and we&#39;ve all watched BW and Bm so technically we are \nmore qualified to make those kind of calls.  We&#39;ve seen the awesome G1 \nepsidoes, the good BW episodes, and the lame as hell BM.\n\nAlso yeah, Scourge got his hand on the Matrix in &quot;The Burden Hardest To \nBare&quot;, the only episode where Rodimus/Hot Rod is actually kinda cool.  It \nmutated Scourge into a superpowerful robot, well, kind of, he still seemed \nlike a wuss.  And it just gave him a really bad case of acne.  It didn&#39;t \ndestroy him though.  As far as I know the Matrix was never destroyed, just \ndepleted to defeat the Hate Plague.  I&#39;m 99.9% sure of it, but I haven&#39;t seen \nevery Season 3 ep so I won&#39;t say I&#39;m 100%.)\n\n"}}
