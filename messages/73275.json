The village was empty.\n\nThe cave that NIGHTSHIFT, PERCEPTOR and WINDLORD was not so easy to\nmake out as there a recent cave-in was obscuring the exact location of\nthe door. However a few moments of searching would easily reveal it to\nthe seatching TUCSON.\n\nOOC: The cave-in has been quite extensive. The whole outer cave has\nbeen filled in. If you remember Nightshift and the others entered one\ncave then found another that led down towards the ining area. It is\nthat whole first cave that has been filled in.\n\nOOC: Also Airly I have sent you some private mail. Please get back to\nme when you can.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
