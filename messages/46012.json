By stopping whats happening in NBWRPG will make the \npeople \n&gt; unhappy and thats what the council does, it tries to keep them \nhappy. It \n&gt; doesnt want them to live with the burden of living with the \nconsequences with \n&gt; their charachters actions as well as their own. This I pointed out \nearlier \n&gt; right before a good amount of players left. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 1/20/2002 10:36:29 AM Eastern Standard Time, \n&gt; jhogan@r... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway I was going to rant on about how a sequel wouldn&#39;t be all \nthat\n&gt; &gt; different from a restart but I figured why bother?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I hit the end of my long typed out rant I hit the problem. \nThe real\n&gt; &gt; one. Another person posted that characters are not allowed to die\n&gt; &gt; currently...he is utterly incorrect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given the\n&gt; &gt; responsibility to judge how much damage they take...however as \nwe&#39;ve seen\n&gt; &gt; some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let alone \nresponsibly\n&gt; &gt; judge how much damage their character takes. When a bot does get \ndamaged\n&gt; &gt; what typically happens here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the list:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad \nside of \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; barn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the long \ntime\n&gt; &gt; character slip away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any \ndamage is\n&gt; &gt; completely gone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an \nenemy\n&gt; &gt; infiltrator.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after various \nmeeting\n&gt; &gt; with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again. Personality \nreverts to\n&gt; &gt; pre-evil clone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. \nPersonality\n&gt; &gt; is hardly different.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s \nblasted\n&gt; &gt; carcass back to a lab where they resurrect him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same \npersonality...eventually\n&gt; &gt; people will forget you died and you can go back to your old form.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I \nmean truly\n&gt; &gt; die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new \nplotlines you can\n&gt; &gt; do with them without repeating rehashed already done ones. Take \nfor example\n&gt; &gt; the geotrons planing to attack the new cat faction....both \nfactions will\n&gt; &gt; survive, I doubt either player who controls the majority of bots \nin either\n&gt; &gt; faction is gonna let their characters get anywhere near killed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES \noccur? The\n&gt; &gt; role-playing by some will still stink, characters will still be \nincapable \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; dying and given another year or so all plotlines for THAT game \nwill be\n&gt; &gt; starting to repeat. While I still do believe a restart/sequel is \nin order I\n&gt; &gt; think the role-playing problem needs addressing first to stop a \nrepeat of\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s happening to NBW.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
