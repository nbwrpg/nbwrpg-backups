The strane\n&gt; behavior of who she belived that was her husbads, the words of Guileart, the\n&gt; misterious amnesia of Rodimus... All had sense now, she risked her life for\n&gt; an imposter and worse, two maximals died for her fault and reckless actions\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWhile it was possible that NIGHTLIGHT had been fooled by DARK RODIMUS,\nit would seem that DARK RODIMUS believed he was RODIMUS as well. All\nhis movements and memories appeared to be the same. It was only his\nrecent memories, the ones after they had rescued RODIMUS that last\ntime from HYDRAS that seemed to differ.\n\nAlso the MAXIMALS that NIGHLIGHT were saying were dead were beginning\nto stir. Perhaps they were not dead but were only in a deep stasis\nlock. STAMPY&#39;s optics flickered for a moment as SHRAPEDGE actually\nshifted a foot. They may not be dead . . . although with the damage\nthey had sustained they were in no condition to do anything but just\nlay there.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to the female figure with a calm look of disappointment.\n&gt; &quot; I got no answer from either one of them.  Instead they fight each other\n&gt; mindlessly.  I would like to go but how can I when there is no sense of\n&gt; responsibility from either one of them?  How can I leave knowing how\n&gt; unstable this situation has become?  I&#39;m sorry, but without that sense of\n&gt; stability I can not leave.  No,  I will not let it go any further.   It\n&gt; has to end now.\n&gt;\n&gt; He still had strength in his tail.  He attempts to put in one strong slap\n&gt; at the wall of the cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; IT ENDS NOW&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Roars Tucson in one final effort to make a difference.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe female looked at TUSCON, &quot;He told me that you would be like this.&quot;\nShe was pointing at RODIMUS, the one that was in the accustomed red\nand yellow motif.\n\nBIG CONVOY walked forward, &quot;Yeah, what did you expect, for them to\nhave a 20 minute conversation with you, this is a battle!&quot; To\npunctuate the statement CONVOY shot down two of the SHARKTICONS coming\nat them!\n\n&quot;Yeah, plus when was the last time you ever heard of the real Matrix\nbeing black and purple?!?&quot; LEO PRIME said as he took cover with TUSCON\nand BIG CONVOY. &quot;You should have your answer.&quot;\n\nThat was when MAGMATRON turned to look at TUSCON, &quot;So you want more?&quot;\nHe smiled maliciously as he pulled out a large and wicked looking\nsword. As MAGMATRON had geown to nealry 20&#39; in height, his sword was\nnearly as tall as TUSCON himself was! &quot;Come, come and taste death!&quot; he\nswung the sword menacingly!\n\nMeanwhile DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS fought seemingly oblivious to the\nrest of the battle around them.\n\nRODIMUS sent a crushing blow to the side of DARK RODIMUS&#39; helmet, only\nto have it block by the mech almost effortlessly. &quot;You need to come\ntrained to fight!&quot; He said, an evil smile across his face. With an\nopen handed snapping attack to RODIMUS&#39; chest, DARK RODIMUS sent him\nsliding across the floor.\n\nSLIDING across the floor RODIMUS came to a stop as he looked back at\nDARK RODIMUS. &quot;Oh I do!&quot; As they both ran at each other again!\n\nAlso on the floor the larger battle was taking place, SHARKTICONS\ncoming at DINOBOT and SKYSHADOW, their numbers quite large.\n\nRAT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE also faced SHARKTICONS that came at them,\ntheir weapons firing at them with powerful blasts!\n\nHowever in the center of all things, hidden under the cover of the\nbattle SABERBACK came over to NIGHTLIGHT and looked down at her. &quot;So\nyou are the treasure that those two are fighting over.&quot; He was of\ncourse talking about the RODIMUS&#39; who were fighting in the background.\n\nHis voice was pitched too low for the others to hear except for\nNIGHTLIGHT herself.\n\n&quot;Oh, have no doubt, your dark companion believes he is the real\nRodimus . . . because he is . . . copied right down to the last techno\nengram.&quot; SABERBACK smiled.\n\nSABERBACK gestured back at RODIMUS, &quot;and he will fight to the death.&quot;\nHe chuckled evilly. &quot;But you my pretty.&quot; He said as he reached down to\npick up NIGHTLIGHT. &quot;I wonder how much of a treasure you can truly\nbe?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
