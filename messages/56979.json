IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES!&quot; she \nboomed with \n&gt; great anger in her voice. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her form was different from last she &#39;met&#39; these bots, now a mix of \na white \n&gt; tiger & a hawk, a sort of TM mix with a tad BM, she shimmered in \nthe sunlight. \n&gt; The metallic wings flexed & spread out to intimidate the Bots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics glowed as she growled at the Autobots below. \nthen focused \n&gt; upon Empath. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;EMPATH! I FIND IT MORE THAN WISE THAT YOU LEAVE TELETRAN 1 ALONE & \nSTOP \n&gt; MESSING AROUND WITH THE ARK&#39;S POWER! NOW!&quot; She growled. &quot;LEST YOU \nWANT THOSE IN \n&gt; THE BRIDGE TO BE IN DANGER!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Her main concern was for Megatron.. of course. But she felt she had \na duty, & \n&gt; more to protect all of them. It didn&#39;t matter about the Autobots \nwhat they \n&gt; felt or Scourge. Actually, she didn&#39;t trust anyone. Except one bot. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glanced behind her as the others approached. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;LEAVE NOW! I PREPARE FOR BATTLE!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
