Prodigy, you said the Alliance destroyed the \nArk. That&#39;s completely untrue. The Trainers destroyed the Ark.\n\n\n::Kluster::\n\nKluster frowns, looking over at Tarantoupulous. His one hand \nunconscioustly slid down to cradle the stump of his left hand.\n\n&quot;On the contrary, you are thinking only of yourself, my friend. I \nagree with Iron Raptor, and I am an experienced Maximal commander. \nFighting to the death will get you nowhere, and if we fight right now \nit will be to certain death. Tell me, what would we gain by dying \nnow? We would give the Alliance power. They can take save some of our \nbodies and use them as fresh troops, they could take the CF and have \nTHREE bases instead of two. They would be all the more powerful. But \nif we play peaceful now, we can rebuild our base, we can repair \nourselves, and then we will be there to fight them next time. \nFighting to the end is what young and unexperienced bots think is \nhonorable. Its not, its simply foolish. If you want to make an impact \non the world, you should try to live to do it, and throwing your life \naway isn&#39;t worth it.&quot;\n\nHe looks into the bot&#39;s eyes, trying to make him understand. &quot;I hope \nyou understand what I&#39;m saying, because it is very good advice. Iron \nRaptor can&#39;t possibly not try to save our lives. We are her \nresponsibility in a way, and our safety is her prime priority.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;SOULSTICE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tarantoupulous responding to Iron Raptor: You are thinking only of \nyourself.\n&gt; I may be new here, but I know very well that you never surrender, \neven if\n&gt; you must die...\n\n\n"}}
