I&#39;m tell&#39;n ya Night Shift, we got s=\r\nome big connections here now.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks up at them, he now spots =\r\na few more he hadn&#39;t seen before.\n\n&quot; Hey, must - be the rest of his herd.  =\r\nGood tim&#39;n guys.  With them outa the way, we can get back on track. &quot;\n\nThe =\r\nbaby stego looks to him and grunts.  He points to a trickle of battery flui=\r\nd comming down Night Shift&#39;s left side, on his mid section.\n\n&quot;What?  What&#39;s=\r\n wrong?&quot;\n\nRat Trap spots it.\n\n&quot;Oh geeze, you can&#39;t feel that can ya?&quot;\n\nNigh=\r\nt Shift shakes his head.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t feel my legs, or my lower servos. When I=\r\n smacked against that tree, I might&#39;ve blown more than a few gaskets.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap transforms to robot mode.\n\n&quot;Not good, this is not good.  You can&#39;t ke=\r\nep gon&#39; the way ya are now big guy.  Aw maaan, and it&#39;s gonna take more tha=\r\nn the CR chamber ta put ya back tagether.  Your only hope is that I go back=\r\n&#39;n get help, but it&#39;ll take me forever ta get back.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to =\r\na stegosaurous.\n\n&quot;Not - if ya showed those guys the way back.  They&#39;ll get =\r\na there in plenty of time.&quot;\n\nA young adult stego steps out and lowers his n=\r\neck for Rat Trap.  Obviously he was the youngest of the adolescents and the=\r\n most fit for the long journey.  Rat Trap gets on, as the others hold their=\r\n ground around Night Shift.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be back as fast as I can, and this time =\r\nI&#39;ll bring backup. Okay big guy, we gotta hussle.&quot;\n\nThe stegosaurous now he=\r\nads in the direction upon where Rat Trap and Night Shift originally came fr=\r\nom.  His feet move quickly as he does his best to get Rat Trap back to the =\r\nArk safely. \n\n&quot;This is Rat Trap Ta Rodimus over, Night Shift&#39;s damages are =\r\nmore serious than I thought, so I&#39;m commn&#39; back ta get help.  He&#39;s gonna ne=\r\ned some serious repairs and a transport back ta base, over&#39;n out.&quot;\n\n--- In =\r\nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The stegosaurous lumbers closser to the fallen trees, and then s=\r\nenses\n&gt; danger around the pile. Yet instead of fleeing, he grumbles and gro=\r\nwls at\n&gt; the insecticons, stamping his feet to ward them off, and swiping h=\r\nis tail to\n&gt; keep them away from the pile. As he does that, the female and =\r\nthe baby\n&gt; stegosaurous now help to get Rat Trap and Night Shift out by mov=\r\ning the logs\n&gt; with their mouths, also surrounding them protectively as the=\r\ny do so. It\n&gt; appeared that NONE of them would move without a fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The giant lady bugs hovered for a moment, looking distinctly like=\r\n\n&gt; insecticons, even if their configuration was a bit different, but giving=\r\n off\n&gt; a definite Unicronian signature. They continued to orient on the pat=\r\nh that\n&gt; Night Shift and Rat Trap took, thier scanning beams moving over th=\r\ne ground.\n&gt; Then they quickly traced it down to lower area where the Maxima=\r\nl duo sat,\n&gt; now aided - curiously- by the rather atypical stegosaurous bac=\r\nk-up.\n&gt; \n&gt; They buzzed for a moment as if analyzing the situation and they =\r\nchanged\n&gt; direction and began heading back towards the battle, and since th=\r\ney are\n&gt; flying rather than driving or walking they are able to do so at a =\r\nhigh rate\n&gt; of speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
