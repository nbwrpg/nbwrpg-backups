But It&#39;ll take a good 3 mega-cycles just to manufacture 1 of \nthose weapons, including downloading the programming.\nBut if you want one to field test, then we better get our gears in high.\nI need a simple steel stand set near to the comp console off to the left, \nthe only one functioning.\nI&#39;ll also need a portable replicator set atop the table.&quot;\n\n* And that was all she was going to tell him, for now.\nFirst things first.*\n\n\n_______________________________Zyber.\n\n* Zyber slightly backed up a bit from the great beast as she heard him \ngrowl, listening as his began to speak but then stopped.\nBut then heard him start up again, what he spoke clear to her senses. \nHowever, when he mentioned that his attackers were both Maximal, it slightly \nconfused her.\nShe had always thought the Maximals were peaceful and kind, never hurting a \nsoul unless they tried to hurt them first.\nWell, she guessed that there was always a first for everything.\nZyber then glanced at the cup still in the creatures hands, wondering if he \nwould want anymore tea but also wondering just how two Maximals could \npossably beat the crap out of such a large bot as this.*\n\n&quot; It is a...little diffacul to believe that only two Maximals could do such \ndamage to such a large bot as you. Especially inflicting such bad wounds.&quot;\n\n* She fumbled with the edge of the furs for a second before sighing and \ngetting to her feet.*\n\n&quot; Anyway, care for anymore tea?&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
