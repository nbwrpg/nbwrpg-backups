He would have to find \nsomeone capable of handling his ability.  They could keep his body.  He had \nno use for it anymore.  The fool slit his throat.  That had served no \npurpose, the body was dead.  The spark however remained.  It was protected by \nthe energy that was used as a weapon of the body.  The body arched as the \nspark was flung out at the ceiling.  It quickly left through the still open \ndoor that Galvatron had come in.  The spark, contained by its innate ability \nto control energy, flew into the distance faster than even Galvatron could \nmatch.\n\n"}}
