He makes a sharp left, one of KitKat&#39;s shots hitting \nhim in the chest. DrillBit&#39;s jump goes a few feet under him, Autofire firing \nat the bot with one of his chain guns, firing at KitKat with the other and at \nStingtra with his shoulder cannon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHearing gunfire, Mosquitor runs out of the Predacon base.\n\n&quot;DIE INVADERS!!&quot; the idiot bug yells, firing acid at Stingtra and KitKat.\n\n"}}
