Armor plating that was once torn was whole and energy levels\nthat had once been flagging were now briming along.\n\nThen there was sounds . . .\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dog bot awoke to find itself in a heavily reinforced prison cell,\n&gt; looking to the window, he saw the faces of his captors, and immediately\n&gt; lunged at the glass.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You won&#39;t be getting out like last time.&quot; said Ravenchief. &quot;This used to be\n&gt; a bomb shelter.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This enraged him more and he began repeatedly clawing and slamming against\n&gt; the door.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey doctor, your patient is awake!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nStanding the dark colored lion turned towards the sounds of speech and\nclawing, as he tilted his head to look. With a small growl roar he\nshifted into a robot mode!\n\nHe stood  tall radiating a warrior&#39;s strength and power. His armor,\nmuch like his cat form was constructed of a dark colored alloy a deep\npurple (aubergine) and black. Even in robot mode his face and even\nstance has a predatory look, although from his optics a quersting\nintelligence could be seen. He stood several inches taller then the\naverage transformers, his broad frame displaying powerfully thick\nrobust protective armor plating. Each of his broad shoulders are\ntopped by long ranged mortar cannons.\n\nHe looked around at the dog bot and then at anyone else around him,\nincomprehension dawning in his optics, &quot;Where am I?&quot; he said in deep\ntones as he continued to look around, his clawed hands touching the\nbarrier around his cell as if testing it. He looked at those outside\nhis cage, &quot;And who are you!&quot; this last statement a demand.\n\nOOC: I will assume that the CR chamber scanned him, so they should be\naware that he has other modes: Robot, Combat Tank,\nMecha-scorpion,Aerial Cannon, Star Fighter, Mecha-Lion. He still has\nno faction signature, he only registers as Cybertronian.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
