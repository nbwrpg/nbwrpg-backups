The transport had taken much energy. The \ncomputer was off. The cloak device was running smoothly. LUckily it had moved \nfrom its original destination as programed be destructor. It was about 500 \nmiles away from its original mountain landing. Inside awaited a machine. The \nmachine was ready and waiting. Only waiting for the activation sequence. The \ngreen butto was covered with cob webs. War&#39;s spark went off line. The main \ncomputer switched on. On low so not to be detected. A hologram suddenly came \nup on the bridge. It was a hologram of destructor. It awaited its visiter. \nHopefully Drill Bit would come swiftly. The ship noticed that Kit Kat was not \non-line. The hologram sighed. As if it wher alive. The preds where seperated \nin two spots on the scanners. One group held Drill bit the other Megs. \nHopefully Drillbit would arrive soon.\n\n"}}
