He&#39;d continue to play \nthe game a little longer, he might be able to use this to his \nadvantage. Three bots chasing him meant three more samples for \nVeratis. If only Veratis believed in weaponry. He quickly scampered \ndown the hall. A musky smell filled his nostrils. He figured it was \nthe brig. He was playing right into thier hands. Or at least thats \nwhat he wanted them to think. KitKat was getting closer, he didn&#39;t \nhave to look back to know that, he was staying a step ahead of her \nboth mentally and physically.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She smiled as she started to get closer to the fox.  He&#39;s headed \n&gt; straight for the brig, she thought.  She smiled.  This fox was \n&gt; trapping himself for her. This was going to be a nice day when she \n&gt; cought him.  She didn&#39;t wan&#39;t him harmed though. She wanted to put \n&gt; him through a mind probe first, then reprogram him.\n&gt; She stayed in her dead run after him, with her wolf eyes glaring \n&gt; ahead, trying to keep him in sight.\n\n\n"}}
