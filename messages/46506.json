Suddenly a flash back of his lost memories started, he felt \nsomething strange: fear... he needed escape... he needed come back at \nhis home... he needed stay with Maximals... He couldn&#39;t explain \nthat... He couldn&#39;t explain what was happening to him\n\nWHile he was suffering his flashback, he put his hands on his head, \nas if he were suffering a huge headache and started breath.\n\nHis Decepticon&#39;s program could took the control again and the flash \nback end. Now he was once Nightstrike, the decepticon. He took \nbreath... In few seconds he would leave Maximal city\n \n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Epyon::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well Siref, that Decepticon, was one of my Maximals, Condor,\n&gt; reprogramed.
