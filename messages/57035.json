He almost \nstarts a fight with a drunken tech bot, but decides not to cause a \nnotable disturbance, or ruckus, so early on the journey.\n\nSliding smoothly between tables, he avoids a serving bot, and finds \nhimself next to Dracon and Krhinos with a shot of energin in his \nhands that he swiped unnoticeably from the serving bot as he passed.\n\n&quot;Krhinos...&quot; he says softly, then nods to Dracon. &quot;I&#39;m Rukus, check \nthe roster, I signed on late. When do we leave?&quot;\n\n\nooc: \nSorry, didn&#39;t know we&#39;d started posting for this yet, so i missed \nthe queue. I&#39;m here now! (as you can see)\n\nAlso, the previous landing by Rukus was a *ahem* warmup... yah, \nsomething like that. So dont bother answering him (not that anyone \ndid anyway =p)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Krhinos saluted the mercenary and ordered a fusionnaire drink.\n&gt; \n&gt; Krhinos: Dracon, pleased to meet you once more.

He sipped from his glass of energin in hand.  Dracon \nsaw\n&gt; Krhinos walk into the Mess Hall, and instantly made a gesture by\n&gt; tipping his glass forward in a salute.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;G&#39;Day, Captain...&quot; he said solemnly, &quot;how fares our search, \nmight I\n&gt; ask?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: Nic \n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Monday, June 02, 2003 9:33 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: The new Contract\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Captain Krhinos is requested in room 1000, Captain Krhinos&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The huge workman entered the elevator and punched a button. It \ntook\n&gt; &gt;   him straight at the top stair of the huge space station. He\n&gt; &gt;   disembarked and walked into the office of Tycoon, his \nentrepreneur\n&gt; boss.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Hi Krhinos. Sit down please. You&#39;ve got a new mission!\n&gt; Energon?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Krhinos: Just a small glass, you know I&#39;m trying to quit... \nSo, what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;   the new deal? The Tripredacus again?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Not this time. (He poured the liquid energon in two \nsmall\n&gt; &gt;   glasses and handed one to his employee.) They&#39;ve offered great\n&gt; &gt;   contracts, but they&#39;re ending their invasion soon. They don&#39;t \nneed any\n&gt; &gt;   more ore. (He sipped a little from his cup) This contractor \nwished to\n&gt; &gt;   remain anonymous, but it&#39;s going to be one of our biggest \noffer yet.\n&gt; &gt;   Basically, we have been given the mining rights for a whole \nplanet!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Krhinos nearly choked on his energon. A planet! StarDrill Inc \nwould\n&gt; &gt;   become the most profitable company in the whole system!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Krhinos: You serious, Tyke?!? A planet!? Which one just for \nfun?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon smiled grimly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Earth! We have the rights to mine Earth! The human \ncradle\n&gt; &gt;   itself! (Seeing Krhinos&#39;s unbelieving face, he held a hand \nup.) Now,\n&gt; &gt;   now... It&#39;s the prehistoric Earth, not that rebellious \nheadquarter of\n&gt; &gt;   today&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Krhinos: What are we looking for? Iron? Radium?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon: All you can find! You get a full mobile mining base \nthat you\n&gt; &gt;   can keep in orbit, a small outpost on the planet from which \nyou can\n&gt; &gt;   ship the resources, I&#39;ll even grant you that Mammoth Drill you \nlove so\n&gt; &gt;   much. In short, do your best! Oh... I almost forgot... I got \nyou a few\n&gt; &gt;   mercenaries to bring along. They should be in the Mess Hall by \nnow.\n&gt; &gt;   Take &#39;em along. They&#39;ll help you a lot, it&#39;s on their \ncontract. If it\n&gt; &gt;   isn&#39;t, just pay them on the company&#39;s account.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Krhinos: Will do, Boss. Thanks a lot! I&#39; make this mission pay \nup!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The massive bot stood up, finished his drink in a nano and \nsaluted\n&gt; &gt;   Tycoon one last time before going to the Mess Hall. It was the \nkind of\n&gt; &gt;   bar where he&#39;d expect anything, from the lowly pleasure bots \nto the\n&gt; &gt;   drunken brawls. He looked around, trying to find some \nrelatively fresh\n&gt; &gt;   mercs in the crowd...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
