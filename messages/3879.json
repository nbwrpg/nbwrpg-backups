Gould&quot; &lt;black_panther_kitten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 17, 2000 8:43 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; ( Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Kinda new at all this but thanx for\n&gt; letting me know. There&#39;s a more specific post then.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Snow Tech growled as he saw almost every one of the\n&gt; enemy fire upon Dinobot, his battle rage and\n&gt; excitement only building as he saw his weapon strike\n&gt; another. He turned and looked at each one of the enemy\n&gt; in turn but aimed his lightning gun towards Koga Shuko\n&gt; and fired off an oray of 7 shots towards his chest. It\n&gt; wasn&#39;t fair that they were ganging up on another bot\n&gt; like that, didn&#39;t they have any rules or something\n&gt; that went against that. Then suddenly Snow Tech got a\n&gt; dumb look on his face, they were Predacons...they had\n&gt; no rules!\n&gt; Shadow Cat glared at all of the Predacons who insisted\n&gt; on firing upon Dinobot, her own rage rising to the\n&gt; point of her reaching behind and taking out her\n&gt; splatter gun. With careful aim she pointed the barel\n&gt; of it towards Serpentor and fired off about 4 shots\n&gt; before aiming her weapon towards Sixshot and firing at\n&gt; him as well.\n&gt; She didn&#39;t like the fact that they were outnumbered\n&gt; and she didn&#39;t like the fact that everyone seemed to\n&gt; be getting too damaged to fight...it was almost\n&gt; hopeless.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages with Yahoo!
