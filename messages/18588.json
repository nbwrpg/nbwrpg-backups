He was a \n&gt; mess.....definetly \n&gt; &gt; needed a CR chamber. At the moment she was arriving at Kitkats, or \n&gt; the PACK&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; base, in a small transport. She found Inferno laying the ground in \n&gt; stasis. \n&gt; &gt; For now he would have to remain inside the vessle.\n&gt; &gt; � � The ship soared just above the treetops, scattering birds and \n&gt; animals \n&gt; &gt; alike. In the distance she could see the base, or cave, as it would \n&gt; seem. She \n&gt; &gt; typed the landing protocols in and set the ship down 30 meters from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; entrance. Aracnia exited and began to walk to the entrace, turning \n&gt; to raise \n&gt; &gt; shileds on the transport.\n&gt; &gt; � � The entrance was empty, quite suspicious, but not uncommon in \n&gt; these days. \n&gt; &gt; The two metal doors stood silent as she stood before them. Looking, \n&gt; she saw a \n&gt; &gt; panel and pushed a button, an intercom.\n&gt; &gt; � � &quot;Commander Black Aracnia, of the Predacon Forces, wishes to \n&gt; speak with \n&gt; &gt; Commander Kitkat. Please acknowledge.&quot; She said cooly, not letting \n&gt; her temper \n&gt; &gt; get the better of her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; � � Paralysis, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, Tankkor, and Rampage \n&gt; remained at the \n&gt; &gt; ship, as did Quickstrike. They were going through routines and \n&gt; keeping the \n&gt; &gt; ship safe. It needed a lot of maintenence, but if Kitkats troops \n&gt; moved in \n&gt; &gt; there would be no problem. \n&gt; &gt; � � That was the question after all.....where were the two groups \n&gt; going to \n&gt; &gt; stay? Together at one base, or divided at two? Aracnia tried the \n&gt; divided \n&gt; &gt; part, and it failed. But Kitkat seemed to be a better leader, so it \n&gt; might \n&gt; &gt; work.\n&gt; &gt; � � &quot;Computer, locate Black Aracnia.&quot; Tarantulas said. He was in \n&gt; the dark \n&gt; &gt; bowles of the Predacon Cruiser. It was rusty, deserted, and scary. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; bravest Predacon wouldnt even go in there. Thats why Tarantulas \n&gt; liked it so \n&gt; &gt; much.....it was his own little nest of terror. \n&gt; &gt; � � Suspended above, amongst the pipes and iron works, were the \n&gt; bodies of \n&gt; &gt; small and large animals he had eaten and left to rot. Parts of a \n&gt; few \n&gt; &gt; mainenence bots scattered the web too, he had eaten those when the \n&gt; animals \n&gt; &gt; had become scarce.\n&gt; &gt; � � The computer responded, &quot;Commander Black Aracnia is outside the \n&gt; ships \n&gt; &gt; scanning range.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; � � Tarantulas rubbed his hairy palms together. That ment she was \n&gt; at the \n&gt; &gt; meeting. And Quickstrike, he beloved knight in mismatched armor, \n&gt; was asleep. \n&gt; &gt; The spider hated Quickstrike. He had programmed Black Aracnia long \n&gt; ago to be \n&gt; &gt; his mate.....now she was in love with Quickstrike. Tarantulas \n&gt; wouldnt stand \n&gt; &gt; for it, not much longer anyhow. Revenge would be sweet....if he \n&gt; could only \n&gt; &gt; muster up a plan to do so. The witch was pregnant, prehaps he could \n&gt; use it \n&gt; &gt; agianst her, somehow.\n&gt; &gt; � � He transformed into robot mode and left his sanctuary. Entering \n&gt; the main \n&gt; &gt; corridor he ran into the ever moody Rampage. The self appointed \n&gt; ruler of the \n&gt; &gt; Predacons when Aracnia was gone. He was a tyrant, he would make \n&gt; Megatron \n&gt; &gt; proud.\n&gt; &gt; � � &quot;Where have you been, insect? The ships computer diagnostic \n&gt; wont run \n&gt; &gt; itself!&quot; He said, narrowing his already evil looking optics at the \n&gt; scientist. \n&gt; &gt; Rampage was alot stranger than Tarantulas, and he thought he was \n&gt; alot smarter.\n&gt; &gt; � � Tarantulas pushed past him and went into the bridge. He would \n&gt; work, for \n&gt; &gt; now. When this little merger was complete, Megatron dead, Hell \n&gt; Beast \n&gt; &gt; banished, he would step out of hiding.....he wold have his revenge \n&gt; on all of \n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
