He \ngrunts, noting a slight lack of supplies while walking up to Megatron.\n\n&quot;No offence, but if Hell Beast or Zardus attack us here, we wouldn&#39;t stand \nmuch of a chance,&quot; he pauses to look at Quickstrike.\n\n&quot;Did you really promote him to sub-commander?&quot; he asks Megatron before \ncontunuing with what he was saying, &quot;Anyways, there are alot more resources \navailable. Scanner parts, weapons, fuel, scrap metal, and stuff like that. I \ncan lead you to these resources.&quot;\n\n"}}
