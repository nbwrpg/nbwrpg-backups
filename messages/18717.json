With all those \nattacks all you took was a gash to the shoulder? And in my post I \nsaid that the lance went into your throat because if you&#39;re pretty \nclose to a person you can say if your weapons hit them. People may \nsay that Vulois was too powerful, but that was the reason I got him \nout of he Peace story and trimmed him down. And people keep saying \nthey shot at the Trainers but they were in cloak and in the sky so \nthe really wouldn&#39;t hae any shadow. I know some people said they shot \nwhere Koj said Prebon was and that&#39;s fine, but others just said they \nshot at them.)\n\nStarscream\n\nStarscream answered Destructor.\n\n&quot;This mouse is in leage with Megatron. She knows his hiding. She&#39;s \nplaying dumb, saying she thinks that this is Megatron&#39;s spark here. \nI&#39;m taking her to the bring until KitKat can deal with her.&quot; He \nmotioned ot her with his gun, &quot;Let&#39;s go or you fry.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers(Tamron)\n\nPrebon saw all the fire power heading towards where the group was \nbefore. All sorts of Maximals were out fighting now. They had to be \ndealt with. He told the Trainers to lower themselves down so they \nwere out fo range of Koj&#39;s jamming and scanned them. Most of them \ndidn&#39;t have chips implanted in them. Time for new recruits. Secretly, \nPrebon gave the order to form the gestault Tamron, and he gave orders.\n\n&quot;Slayer, forget putting the wolf in stasis. Kill him. Savage, take \nout the Ark. If we can&#39;t win, we will destroy history!&quot;\n\nTamron moved along towards the new bots. He fired two rockets around \nthe area, and than launched two chips towards Maximals without the \nchip(Sky Lynx and Trinity) Savage flew up into the air and fired two \nfireballs down onto the main structure of the Ark.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq were installing computer boards on the Ark when they \nheard the battle outside. They ran out and saw two fireballs come \ndown on the Ark.\n\n&quot;Savage.....&quot;\n\nThey both begna firing at where they thought the dragon was. \n\n\n"}}
