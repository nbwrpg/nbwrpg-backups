If the Maximals \ncame out victorious he&#39;d be an honored hero for having supplied the \ninformation. Or the Maximals would cease to function and nobody would \nbe the wiser to the treasonous acts performed. If KitKat failed and \nher team was deleated he&#39;d just claim to be following her orders.\n\nThe only losing scenario would be if the Iron Fist destroyed the \nplanet like he believed it would.\n\n(Which reminds me Has Hysteria been all cooped up in the CF&#39;s engine \nroom void of contact all this time?)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I say we take them to the roughest land, we can find.
