All  of them hit \nher around the lower chest. She fell to the ground with mech fluid \npoured out of her chest. She walked for a few steps, trying to get to \nDeemos, but fell down in pain. She used the comm as her last resort.\n\n&quot;Deemos.....This is Zava....I..I&#39;m closer to the Pred cave(cough)... \nHurt...badly. Please...help me.&quot;\n\nShe gives up and goes into stasis lock.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron followed behind Burning Hammer\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nAs Starscream got nearer to Testifyer, he fired off two missles. \n\n\n"}}
