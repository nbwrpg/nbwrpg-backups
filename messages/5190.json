She cringed \nand growled as the shots found their mark. Her armor was blackened and her \nfur burned, in some places to the point where it was nothing more than an \nunrecognizable mass of smoking metal.\n\nTavatron dropped to one knee, no longer able to stand under her own power. \nShe roughly wiped away the silver mech-fluid that trickled down her face, \nfalling in small drops on the smoking ground. She knelt there for a moment, \na flickering status screen appearing before her barely lit optics:\n\nInternal comp: Status critical, stasis lock imminent.\n\nTavatron fell forward, groaning softly. This really was suicide. What had \nthey been thinking?! That Zardus would just let them walk away?! She took \none last look up at Zardus just before her optics flickered out.\n\n*Slag* she thought, *He&#39;s got Iron Raptor...* Tavatron&#39;s thought trailed off \ninto nothingness as she was engulfed in darkness.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
