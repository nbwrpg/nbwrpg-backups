D=\r\no you guys want me to GM the combat as I did before or do you want to RP it=\r\n on an individual basis? I don&#39;t mind doing it, although it will slow down =\r\nmy response time as I will have to resolve each round of combat. \n\nThe reas=\r\non why I ask is that although the Maximals have shot down all the original =\r\nsweeps, no one RPed getting hit by any of the blasts they were firing back.=\r\n It does not upset me, since they were essentially just sweeps, but I would=\r\n like to preserve the realism as much as possible, and that real sense of d=\r\nanger here. \n\nSo do you guys want to RP combat yourselves or do you want me=\r\n to do it?\n\nOh and to clarify, the rules for battle if you guys want to do =\r\nit on your own are:\n\nEach person states what they INTEND to do and you allo=\r\nw the other person to indicate in thier return post if the shot hits/misses=\r\n/bounces off armor or the like, and then it goes the other way. \n\nAnyways, =\r\nwhich way do you want to do?\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
