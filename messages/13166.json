She went to a panel in the back and \nstarted repairs.  She pulled three panels off the wall and a small \npanel with it.  She ripped out a bunch of burnt wires and power boxes \nthat had been fried.  She went to take one panel that was just above \nher head.  She pulled on it and a whole side of the wall fell down on \nher.  She screamed,&quot;AHHHHHHH!&quot;  She put her arms above her head and \nstood still.\n\nWhen it had stopped and the soot died down, she was now covered head \nto toe with blask soot and grime.  She stood there for a moment then \ncalled out,&quot;FOR THE LOVE OF THE MARTIX, THIS JUST ISN&#39;T MY DAY!&quot;\nShe sighed and looked about.  She looked around hoping to see a \nshovel to remove the junk that surraounded her.\n\n\n"}}
