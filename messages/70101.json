Especially when it=\r\n came from Hydras or the other Predacons and Decepticons. He then realized =\r\nby the feel of his restraints, that yes, they were next to near impossible =\r\nfrom escape. To break them was not an option, but, perhaps Ninjabot trainin=\r\ng could come in handy as far as finding ways around the loop holes. He coul=\r\nd sense that the more he expanded his hydraulics on his wrists and ankles, =\r\nthe tigher and less comfortable they were on him. Meditation again would co=\r\nme in handy. The more he relaxed, the more limber his body would become. Pe=\r\nrhaps even limber enough to give him more room to move in his tight quarter=\r\ns. Yet he was still waiting to hear Rodimus&#39;s reply to his question. When t=\r\nhe answer doesn&#39;t come, he realizes that he&#39;d have to get through to him a =\r\ndifferent way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I remember the battle, although it was a bitter memory=\r\n. We were desperately fighting against Hydras, me myself, barely able to fe=\r\nnd off the Predacons, but I did. Then, it started to happen. Things were ge=\r\ntting out of control real fast and there were no more Autobots with conside=\r\nrable speed available, for diversionary tactics. In that time, I was open t=\r\no assist, and then everything was happening at once. You were being chased,=\r\n along with windlord and Nightlight. Being who I am, and who I was at the t=\r\nime, to me, there was no such thing as failure. So, I transformed into vehi=\r\ncle mode, and I went as fast as my wheels could take me, although not very =\r\nfast to your standards, but to mine it was far beyond my usual caliber. I y=\r\nelled out your name, and I told you to hold on because I was comming to hel=\r\np you. I was able to divert the attention away from you and direct it my wa=\r\ny. What I didn&#39;t see comming was an energy blast that hit me square in my d=\r\nirectory, causing me to fall into immediate stasis, and before I knew it, e=\r\nverything went black, and after that, nothing. I lost everything. My sight,=\r\n and even a good portion of my memory. But most of all, I lost the leader t=\r\nhat I respected loyally, and two of my most valuable comrades. I lost you a=\r\nll because of me, and you think I&#39;m happy with that? I&#39;m not. Because of me=\r\n you are now how you are, and I&#39;ll have that guilt with me for as long as I=\r\n live. But I&#39;m learning to move on Rodimus, as painful it is for me to reme=\r\nmber the past, I&#39;m moving on. And I believe I can help you do the same, if =\r\n- you can trust me. Hydras would never promise you the support only a fello=\r\nw Autobot can offer, and he would never accept failure as a learning experi=\r\nence. But to me, Failure is just a nother step toward self improvement. You=\r\n fall, you get back up, and you roll again. You look back at what you did w=\r\nrong and you correct it. It&#39;s all right to make mistakes Rodimus, Primus kn=\r\nows I&#39;ve made more than my fair share already.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He hoped that his appro=\r\nach would possibly break some ground beneath them.\n&gt;\n&gt; In another cell in t=\r\nhe fortress, Night Shift remains calm knowing that Tucson Prime wasn&#39;t real=\r\nly about to give into Hydras. A new plan was in action and all he had to do=\r\n was wait. Although, getting out of the handcuffs was also on his mind. He =\r\ndidn&#39;t much care for them, since they were irritating the metal around his =\r\nwrists.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Slag these things itch like mad.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He tries to scratch the =\r\nitchiness that the cuffs cause him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap obse=\r\nrves Phobia&#39;s reaction to Quickstride&#39;s noxious gas explusion. He sees how =\r\neuphoric it makes her. With his ratty little mind, he gets an idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hm=\r\nmmm.... I think someone&#39;s gettn a buzz off of your fumes Quickstride. Altho=\r\nugh I dunno what&#39;s so great about it, because it smells worse than a rottin=\r\ng carcass.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride&#39;s ears flicker back and forth. He slows from a =\r\ngallop, to a canter and eases himself from trot to walk, turning around to =\r\nwatch the Decepticons heading toward the black fortress.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmmm.... Real=\r\nly? Gettn&#39; a buzz off my aft gas huh? Which one?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks around=\r\n in the sky.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, the redn&#39; white one that just acted a little goofy =\r\nup there.. That&#39;s the one. I dunno who that Decepticreep is, but definitely=\r\n got tipsy off that gas.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride finds more bean pods and stuffs h=\r\nis mouth with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If that&#39;s the case, then, when in doubt... Stink&#39;e=\r\nm out. C&#39;mon Rat Trap, we&#39;re gon&#39; back.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gasps.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;ARE YOU O=\r\nUTA YOUR DIRECTORY?! CAN WE SAY SLAGGED IN SECONDS, YA OVER RATED JACKAFT?!=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks to Rat Trap. He swallows a whole bunch of bean pods=\r\n down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maybe I am. Trust me, the more I eat, the better this&#39;ll get&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; He then trots back toward the fortress, turns his rump around, lifts hi=\r\ns tail and breaks the wind around him, sending another gassy cloud of fumes=\r\n through the wind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ohh yeahhh, nice&#39;n stinky..
