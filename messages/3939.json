He was already getting \ntired of waiting around for things to get done. He was a little bored. When \nthe call for the stasis pod came, he&#39;d come running.\n\nHe wrapped his arm around her waist, being still careful around her. He knew \nshe could kill him, but it was easy going with this type of female. He had \nto watch her reactions and go with it when she didn&#39;t want to be bothered. \nBut he was happy to know that she was back in the ranks of the Predacons.\n\n&quot;Say, uuh, sugar-bot, mind if ya take me on uh tour of th&#39; base?&quot; he softly \nsaid to her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
