She was beginning to come around, but not \nawake yet.  He carried her to her room, set her on the bed, then had \na mental debate.  To stay or go, disobey a Master, or do as she \nsaid.  He reluctantly left, and found an empty oom.  he stepped in \nto find a totally bare chamber, except for a computer terminal in \nthe wall, wall monitor, and a bed.  He was wore out, and flopped on \nthe bed and promtly fell asleep.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Splattercannon, who had listened and watched part of what recently \ntranspired, walked to Blacknightmare&#39;s room and hit the door tone.  \nHe didn&#39;t know jus what the femmes were up to, but it sure confused \nSplattercannon.
