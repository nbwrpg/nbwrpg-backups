While doing that, he\n&gt; keeps full =\r\nconcentration on Hydras.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Tuscon attempts to disorient the new gr=\r\noup of approaching soldiers, an answering wave of energy is felt from Deeps=\r\ntryke, the one looking much like a floating cannon. While it does not compl=\r\netely counteract the affect of Tuscon&#39;s wave, much of its affect is lost as=\r\n they approach. \n\n&quot;ATTACK!&quot; Deepstryke&#39;s daunting voice can be heard as Pho=\r\nbia and the sweeps behind him pull into firing range of the maximals. And w=\r\nith one a seeming accord they open fire on them!\n \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Sho=\r\nt appears worried.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I knew you&#39;d try something like that!

He knew what had to be d=\r\none, and against Tucson&#39;s orders, he reaches out to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NIGHT SHI=\r\nFT TA RODIMUS OVER! I THINK YA BETTER SET UP SOME SERIOUS SECURITY AT THE A=\r\nRK, &#39;CAUSE WE&#39;RE GONNA NEED YA HERE! TUCSON&#39;S WAITN&#39; FOR HYDRAS AND HE&#39;S LO=\r\nOKN&#39; TA GO ONE ON ONE WITH &#39;EM!&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;CUT/PASTE&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Back at the Ark, Quick=\r\nstride shakes his head, as the darkness lifts, and he can hear and see agai=\r\nn. He snorts.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Talk about a serious system glitch. What the pit was th=\r\nat?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He could now see and hear Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m okay Rodimus, I - thin=\r\nk it was just a glitch, not sure really.. Anyway, someone is definitely her=\r\ne, but I&#39;m sure I can handle things here. You better go assist Night Shift =\r\nand the others. He said something about - Tucson waiting for Hydras... Sorr=\r\ny, overheard the com, can&#39;t help it.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus nodded at Quickstride=\r\n, =93I don=92t think that was a system glitch.=94 He bent down to look at w=\r\nhat looked the hilt of some sort of black dagger that was protruding from t=\r\nhe ground, most of the blade being buried as if it had been thrown. It did =\r\nnot appear to be made of any standard metal, it look more like some sort of=\r\n crystal as it glinted in the sunlight.\n\n=93I don=92t like this.=94 Rodimus=\r\n said as he reached down to touch it and it evaporated into what appeared t=\r\no be smoke and disappeared. He shook his head, =93No I don=92t like this at=\r\n all.=94\n\nHe stood up and look at Quickstride, =93You are right, I have to =\r\ngo, but I don=92t think that that blade was a coincidence. I told you one o=\r\nf those new ones was a ninja.=94 A worried look went across Rodimus=92 face=\r\n, =93I may have been lured out here on purpose.=94\n\nKeying his radio Rodimu=\r\ns spoke to Nightshift, =93I hear you Night Shift.=94 That worried look on h=\r\nis face still on his face. =93I am on my way.=94\n\nRodimus looked at Quickst=\r\nride as he changed stations, =93Lord Elder, it is up to you and Quickstride=\r\n, I have to go to the battle.=94\n\nElder=92s gruff voice could be heard, =93=\r\nYeah I heard. You be careful now kid.=94\n\nRodimus nodded, =93There might be=\r\n an intruder in the base, a ninja I think, keep the sensors on full, this c=\r\nould get ugly before it is over.=94\n\n=93SLAG!=94 Elder said, =93That is why=\r\n you were brought out there.=94\n\nRodimus nodded as he looked at Quickstride=\r\n, making sure he got the point as well. =93I am depending on you two to kee=\r\np the others safe.=94 Rodimus couldn=92t even say the name Elita or Nightli=\r\nght, to do that may have broken his resolve to leave them.\n\nAs if hearing t=\r\nhe plea behind his words Elder simply said, =93We got it Rodimus, you go, g=\r\no now, they need you!=94\n\n=93Got it!=94 he said. With a last look at Quicks=\r\ntride Rodimus straightened and transformed into a huge futuristic looking t=\r\nruck. However unlike before he looked different, more like Optimus as he di=\r\nd so. He formed a smaller vehicle, and from out of nowhere a trailer assemb=\r\nly connected to him. Fire seemed to sizzle along his frame as he landed on =\r\nhis wheels and his two forms connected!\n\nWith a burst of power he revved hi=\r\ns engines and began to move towards Tuscon=92s location. =93I am on my way!=\r\n=94 he transmitted.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to Hydras&#39; command several figu=\r\nres left the shuttle that was flying towards the black tower and began to m=\r\nake thier way towards Tuscon and his team&#39;s location: Insecticon, Bruticus-=\r\nX, Iguanus, Skyshadow, Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, Quickstrike, Terror=\r\nsaur, and Waspinator all hit the skies!\n\nInside the shuttle the three remai=\r\nning troops Fractyl, Tarantulus and Inferno piloted the shuttle in towards =\r\nthe base. The large hanger door on the tower rumbled and open to let the sh=\r\nuttle enter.\n\n&quot;Sir?&quot; Tarantulus said, &quot;What about the breach in the wall? I=\r\n thought I read a Maximal signature there?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_001B_01CBA7C4.0B9E6670\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Windlord/Hyd=\r\nras/Kup/Talon&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Windlord Looked to Rattrap and s=\r\naid =93If you are ready to go down&nbsp; and \nhave some fun I=92m ready to=\r\n=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;************************=\r\n********&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93Send some Predacons to inspect the=\r\n breach if a Maximal is there Kill on \nsight=94said Hydras then laughted on=\r\ne of his evils tone and replied to Tucson \n=93Then let=92s start=94.

While it does not completely counte=\r\nract the affect of Tuscon&#39;s \nwave, much of its affect is lost as they appro=\r\nach. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;ATTACK!&quot; Deepstryke&#39;s daunting voice ca=\r\nn be heard as Phobia and the sweeps \nbehind him pull into firing range of t=\r\nhe maximals. And with one a seeming accord \nthey open fire on them!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; Straight =\r\nShot appears worried.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &quot;I knew you&#39;d try som=\r\nething like that! Night Shift&#39;s right! Rodimus \nalso told you not ta try an=\r\nd bite off more than you can chew!&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; Tucson =\r\nreadies himself for a battle.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll be fin=\r\ne, don&#39;t worry. I didn&#39;t get my name for nothing.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&gt; Night Shift didn&#39;t want any part of Tucson throwing himself into th=\r\ne \ndragon&#39;s lair. He knew what had to be done, and against Tucson&#39;s orders,=\r\n he \nreaches out to Rodimus.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &quot;NIGHT SHIFT T=\r\nA RODIMUS OVER! I THINK YA BETTER SET UP SOME SERIOUS \nSECURITY AT THE ARK,=\r\n &#39;CAUSE WE&#39;RE GONNA NEED YA HERE! TUCSON&#39;S WAITN&#39; FOR HYDRAS \nAND HE&#39;S LOOK=\r\nN&#39; TA GO ONE ON ONE WITH &#39;EM!&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;CUT/PASTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; Back a=\r\nt the Ark, Quickstride shakes his head, as the darkness lifts, \nand he can =\r\nhear and see again. He snorts.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &quot; Talk about=\r\n a serious system glitch. What the pit was that?&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&gt; He could now see and hear Rodimus.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nI&#39;m okay Rodimus, I - think it was just a glitch, not sure really.. \nAnyway=\r\n, someone is definitely here, but I&#39;m sure I can handle things here. You \nb=\r\netter go assist Night Shift and the others. He said something about - Tucso=\r\nn \nwaiting for Hydras... Sorry, overheard the com, can&#39;t help it.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rodimus nodde=\r\nd at Quickstride, =93I don=92t think that was a system glitch.=94 He \nbent =\r\ndown to look at what looked the hilt of some sort of black dagger that was =\r\n\nprotruding from the ground, most of the blade being buried as if it had be=\r\nen \nthrown. It did not appear to be made of any standard metal, it look mor=\r\ne like \nsome sort of crystal as it glinted in the sunlight.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93I don=92t like this.=94 Rodimus said as he reached down to=\r\n touch it and it \nevaporated into what appeared to be smoke and disappeared=\r\n. He shook his head, \n=93No I don=92t like this at all.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He stood up and look at Quickstride, =93You are right, I have =\r\nto go, but I \ndon=92t think that that blade was a coincidence. I told you o=\r\nne of those new ones \nwas a ninja.=94 A worried look went across Rodimus=92=\r\n face, =93I may have been lured \nout here on purpose.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Keying his radio Rodimus spoke to Nightshift, =93I hear you Nigh=\r\nt Shift.=94 \nThat worried look on his face still on his face. =93I am on my=\r\n way.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rodimus looked at Quickstride as he c=\r\nhanged stations, =93Lord Elder, it is up \nto you and Quickstride, I have to=\r\n go to the battle.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Elder=92s gruff voice co=\r\nuld be heard, =93Yeah I heard. You be careful now \nkid.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rodimus nodded, =93There might be an intruder in the base, a n=\r\ninja I think, \nkeep the sensors on full, this could get ugly before it is o=\r\nver.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93SLAG!=94 Elder said, =93That is why=\r\n you were brought out there.=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rodimus nodded=\r\n as he looked at Quickstride, making sure he got the point as \nwell. =93I a=\r\nm depending on you two to keep the others safe.=94 Rodimus couldn=92t even =\r\n\nsay the name Elita or Nightlight, to do that may have broken his resolve t=\r\no \nleave them.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As if hearing the plea behind h=\r\nis words Elder simply said, =93We got it \nRodimus, you go, go now, they nee=\r\nd you!=94&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93Got it!=94 he said. With a last l=\r\nook at Quickstride Rodimus straightened and \ntransformed into a huge futuri=\r\nstic looking truck. However unlike before he \nlooked different, more like O=\r\nptimus as he did so. He formed a smaller vehicle, \nand from out of nowhere =\r\na trailer assembly connected to him. Fire seemed to \nsizzle along his frame=\r\n as he landed on his wheels and his two forms \nconnected!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With a burst of power he revved his engines and began to move t=\r\nowards \nTuscon=92s location. =93I am on my way!=94 he transmitted.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Meanwhile, in response to Hydras&#39; command several figu=\r\nres left the shuttle \nthat was flying towards the black tower and began to =\r\nmake thier way towards \nTuscon and his team&#39;s location: Insecticon, Bruticu=\r\ns-X, Iguanus, Skyshadow, \nInjector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, Quickstrike, Ter=\r\nrorsaur, and Waspinator all hit \nthe skies!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In=\r\nside the shuttle the three remaining troops Fractyl, Tarantulus and \nInfern=\r\no piloted the shuttle in towards the base. The large hanger door on the \nto=\r\nwer rumbled and open to let the shuttle enter.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&quot;Sir?&quot; Tarantulus said, &quot;What about the breach in the wall?
