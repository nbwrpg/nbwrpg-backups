She didn&#39;t have anything to do,\nso she wondered if she could help Plintissa build her Base? She wouldn&#39;t\njoin her group, she would just help.

She turns back and\nignores it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Plintissa, can I help you build your Base? It&#39;d be fun!&quot; *She grins*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
