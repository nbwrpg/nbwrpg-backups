And those who anger us pay \ndearly for it, as these misbegotten fools have no doubt learned from \nthe death of their friend.&quot;  (&#39;misbegotten fools&#39; referring to the \ntripreds, and &#39;friend&#39; meaning the late Burrock.)\n\nThe Rogue leader looks over his shoulder at Torin and Riekan.  The \nformer gathers Jayde into his arms.\n\n&quot;We have no further business here,&quot; Devilcat growls.  &quot;Rogues, back \nto base!&quot;\n\nAll four bots vanish from sight, hearing, smell, and scanners, as \nthey activate their cloaking devices and head back to Rogue Star.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Can someone respond, like Kyle, Deltazero or the Rogue&#39;s \n&gt; controller? \n&gt; \n&gt; Bic:\n&gt; \n&gt; Vladimir did not bother to answer her apoplogies.
