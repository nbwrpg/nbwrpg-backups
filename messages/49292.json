Too bad you won&#39;t \nlive long enough to learn why I only need 1 name, Megatron.&quot;\n\nMegatron hops backwards off of the ship, and onto the wing on that \nside it as the light bolts spray over his last position. He ducks, \nand prepares for his attack, fully aware that he was still damaged \nfrom the previous battle.\n\nHis weapons armed, he pops up from the wing, and fires two plasma \nblasts and a rocket at Tryrael. Then he prepares to change location.\n\n&quot;Switchblade.&quot; Megatron says through a comm, &quot;Found anything yet?&quot;\n\n------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade grimaces then replies, &quot;Uhh, I found something in a \nbox... it was trapped with an older model false top/explode-in-your-\nface style trap. I managed to disarm it... the hard way, and I&#39;m a \nbit damaged now. There appears to be a piece of... something anyway.&quot;\n\nSwitchblade picks up the artifact, and takes a closer look at \nit. &quot;Hmm, it almost looks like a small cube, which is the corner of \na larger cube of some sort. There also appears to be writing on it, \npossibly Vok, but I can&#39;t tell. There are also three small \nmiscoloured squares in the center of three of the sides of it.&quot;\n\nHe takes a look around the room, and spots three more sealed \ncontainers, identical to the one he&#39;d grabbed the oddly shaped cube \nout of.\n\n&quot;Hold on, I&#39;m checking out three more containers which are seemingly \nidentical to the one which had this.. thing in it.&quot; Mumbles \nSwitchblade into the comm and he heads over to the next sealed \ncontainer, his intrest smothering the pain of his damages, and also \nthe fact that Megatron was in the middle of a battle.\n\n\n&gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come. You will learn why \n&gt; they call me the Blue Firestorm!\n&gt; \n&gt; He showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts, no bigger than \n&gt; needles.\n\n\n"}}
