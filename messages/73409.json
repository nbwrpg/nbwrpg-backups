The statue itself was at the\ncenter of the clearing and it looked as if someone did a quick and not\nvery good scuplture of the Predacon called BLIGHT!\n\nKneeling before the statue were several protohumans mumbling in a\nstrange language. A single protohuman was standing at the statue\ntrying to offer fruit and berries to it, which is very different then\nthe glowing rocks WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR had observed them dooing the\nlast time they had been there.\n\nPerhaps that is why the statue was at first making no response.\n\nHowever as the MAXIMALS stayed hidden and watched they saw the statue\nbrighten and then its eyes lit up and lasers fired at the lead\nProtohuman blasting him into the surrounding bushes.\n\n&quot;We . . . *ahem* . . . I mean I said No, your tribute is not what we\nwant!&quot; The voice was that of BLIGHT coming from the statue itself.\n&quot;Bring us more of the glowing rocks!&quot;\n\nThe injured Protohuman continued to lay in the bushes unmoving, smoke\nrosing from his chest.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
