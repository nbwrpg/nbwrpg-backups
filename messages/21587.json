The \ntarget is the Predacon leader. Her name&#39;s KitKat, but she will be \nvery well guarded. I can get you more info on her from the Alliance \ncomputer. Will you need any assistance doing this?&quot;\n\nHearing Dark One&#39;s voice in his head, he responds to it by the same \nmethod as Dark One contacted him. &quot;Hmm.. Excellent. An old relic from \nthe old days of the Alliance is on his way to you. He looks exactly \nlike me and is linked to my mind, in other words I control him. It \nwould be easier to consult him while he&#39;s there instead of sending me \ntransmissions. He will introduce himself as Zardus, simply play \nalong.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ lands behind Dark One, looking at Vehemoth and his troops.\n\n&quot;I am Zardus,&quot; he says, stepping forward, &quot;I understand you&#39;re the \nnew faction that has landed on this planet?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot pauses, turning around to see if BrightBlade was still \nbehind him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; OK Yanshosh, I guess I missed it.
