What they didn&#39;t know was \nyou have a mutant spark.  If you ever used it in battle you&#39;d be all \nbut unstopable.  Both myself and the Rouges detected your spark and \ncame after it hoping to gain a new ally.  But when I got there I was \ndamaged in a storm.  The sisters took me in and treated me.  Even \nthough I found out which one of you it was you wouldn&#39;t come with \nme.  I could have just forced you, but I was weeeelllll begining to \nlike you a great deal, and despite the Sister teachings against it I \nbelieve you may have mirriored this.  When the Rouges arrived you \nwouldn&#39;t defend yourselves, but I would.  I took out a few of them, \nbut they finally got me.  They would have slagged me, but you \nsurrendered youself at the last minute so they&#39;d leave me, and the \nSisters alone.  That was the last I ever heard of you until I \ndetected your spark recently and tracked you down.  I actually came \nhere to help a Predicon I admire named Megatron.  And I hope I can \nconvince him to help you.  Perhaps I should introduce myself.  My \nname, is Flicker.  Now come on, we need to get back to my shuttle.\n\nHe knows he shouldn&#39;t be out in robot mode on this planet for long, \nbut he starts walking towards the base just to savor the walk with \nher, and to allow more time for questions.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Phoenix is a little surprised that she actually enjoyed the \ncontact.  \n&gt; (It&#39;s the first time in nine years that she&#39;s been touched in a \n&gt; positive way.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Please do,&quot; she requests.  &quot;Not knowing is driving me crazy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker looses control and grabs her, giving her a\n&gt; &gt; gentle huge, and a quick peck on the cheek, then\n&gt; &gt; releases her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  I didn&#39;t know you long, but if you like I\n&gt; &gt; can tell you a little bit about your past.\n\n\n"}}
