If Remus does the same then Scourge continues\nuntil he is at a protective but not immedietly dangerous distance. \n\nAround and out to the side the sweeps fly, also somewwhat back from to\nthe gladiators (Cyclonus & Rodimus) and thier seconds (Scourge &\nRemus). \n\nOOC: The sweeps have not cut off approach as they are not making any\naggressive movements, but it may make some folks nervous if they choose\nto fly through. They can of course choose to go around.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better sports nut!
