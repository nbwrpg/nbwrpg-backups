He was content with how the \nmeeting went.  He turns his head toward Leo Prime.\n\n&quot; Your meeting was very helpful and went extremely well.  I commend you on \noutstanding communication and patience.  Keep up the good work&quot;.\n\nHe narrows a brow.\n\n&quot; if you could, please tell Rodimus to meet me in the CR chamber quarters. \nI need to know why he did not return to the meeting.&quot;\n\nWith that said he turns back to Stanton.\n\n&quot; Sorry I stalled you, I&#39;m ready now.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks to Legacy as Tucson is escorted to CR.\n\n&quot; Oh boy, he&#39;s gonna be in CR a long time.  He didn&#39;t look so good.  Anyway, \nlemme show ya what I have so far on the turbines.  The wind turbine isn&#39;t so \nbad but the hydro turbine is another story.  We need materials that won&#39;t \nrust and pollute the water sources here.  Hopefully there are such \nmaterials.&quot;\n\nHe scratches behind his left ear in brwilderment.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n\nOn Jul 22, 2011, at 4:44 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson couldn&#39;t help but rest his forehead in his left hand, closing his\n&gt;&gt; optics for a moment, then re opening them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Please excuse me, I fully agree with you Leo Prime, I was listening to\n&gt;&gt; you.  You&#39;re right, I do need a few more hours in CR.  Quickstride, \n&gt;&gt; Legacy\n&gt;&gt; is your best bet for engineering purposes, he can help you with research,\n&gt;&gt; development and construction.  What you&#39;re proposing seems a bit complex,\n&gt;&gt; and it&#39;s always good to have someone else with you to collaborate with.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride nods enthusiastically.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I was hoping ta have his support actually, well do.  There&#39;s a few \n&gt;&gt; things\n&gt;&gt; I need ta sort out as far as materials.. And of course design and\n&gt;&gt; functionability.  &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson smiles gently and then turns to the little green mech.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I assure you that if you assist us in locating the escaped predicons, \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; will be granted immunity from enemy forces.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; **OOC: I will let Kratlos respond here as soon he is able. **\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He then turns to Leo Prime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I have a feeling Hydras may take advantage of the situation and attempt\n&gt;&gt; another assault on this parameter.  Be sure our boundaries are well \n&gt;&gt; guarded\n&gt;&gt; around the clock, and have everyone take turns running guard duty.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a raised optic ridge as TUSCON continued giving directives,\n&gt; but he said nothing and just nodded graciously. LEO turned to look at\n&gt; the Fuzors, “That will be primarily your duties, security of the Ark.”\n&gt;\n&gt; TORCA glanced over at TUSCON a curious look on his face and then back\n&gt; at LEO PRIME.\n&gt;\n&gt; “Do it Torca, we need to get this place secure. Coordinate with Legacy\n&gt; and Lord Elder here.” LOE gestured at the two mechs being discussed.\n&gt; “I think they have been the primary guardians.”\n&gt;\n&gt; LEGACY looked over at TORCA and QUICKSTRIDE, “Of course. I should be\n&gt; of assistance to Quickstride’s construction as well as base security.\n&gt; I will add all of you to the primary register at the close of this\n&gt; meeting.”\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other side of LEGACY, LORD ELDER sat with his arms folded\n&gt; nodding appreciably. “Of course Prime.” Elder said as he stood.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He nods as a signal that things were adjourned for the time being.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; That pretty much covers everything, Leo Prime, thank you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He tries to get up from his seat and stumbles.  Quickstride catches him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Whoa, careful sir.  Leo, better call someone for transport to the CR\n&gt;&gt; chambers, his balance is really messed up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEO didn’t have to say anything as SANTON quickly stepped off the\n&gt; stage and moved quickly to TUSCON’s side. “Don’t worry, he said in his\n&gt; deep and yet somehow comforting voice. “We will get you to the CR\n&gt; chamber.”\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked up at LEO PRIME who just nodded back.\n&gt;\n&gt; SANTON smiled and slowly stood, allowing TUSCON to lean on him all he\n&gt; wanted. The medic was quite large and looked as if he could carry\n&gt; easily TUSCON if needed.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What will be my duties sir?&quot;said windlord at Leo Prime who was standing \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; a corder of the room\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEO PRIME looked at WINDLORD a small smile on his face as he came off\n&gt; the stage. “Well you have wanted to make up for your time with Hydras\n&gt; right? Tell me what you know of the Predacon. Perhaps there is\n&gt; something that you learned that can help us.”\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
