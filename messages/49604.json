On impact it \ngenerates a localized magnetic field, shorting out electronics.  \nRepeated hits can send a bot into stasis lock quickly no matter how \nwell armored.  It also tends to wipe out short-term memory.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nightlight::\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightlight fell stunned; Destructor&#39;s bite had reached her shoulder \n&gt; and did a severe wound there.
