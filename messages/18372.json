He \ndidn&#39;t want to retrieve Spears, but if his master commanded, it had \nto be done...\n\n&quot;I am ready, Master,&quot; he says to Prebon, hovering near him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm swears, activating his comm-link as Spears yells into hers \nagain. &quot;Cybertronian Fire,&quot; he says into it, &quot;We&#39;re gonna have a \nbattle at the Ark very soon. I suggest sending reinforcememnts. But \ntell them to stop by the lab and get the weapon and chip Ramulus \nmade, they&#39;ll need &#39;em. Tell them to install the chip. Heck, I&#39;ll \nsend you some info.&quot;\n\nHe glides in toward Spears. This needed to stop. Setting his arm \nweapon to lowest power, Firearm fires four shots at Spears, \nattempting to stun her. But Firearm was a bot designed for battle, \nthe lowest setting on his weapon was pretty high. While he fires, his \ncomp sends Kluster the info.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster looks at the scanners of the Cybertronian Fire, recieving \nFirearm&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;All available Maximals,&quot; he says through the intercom, &quot;The Ark \nmight be attacked soon. Everyone&#39;s welcome to go defend it, but a \nchip is neccessary for the battle. THe enemy has a mind controll \ndevice, the chip will counter it. There&#39;s also a weapon that will \ndestroy the mind controll chip that their weapon fires. If you stop \nby the lab, there should be some there. Install the chip into your \nsystems, and grab the weapon. Then head off to the Ark.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Trainers! We are leaving early and going to Spears&#39; positio. I&#39;ve \n&gt; locked onto it. She wants to return to us. We must go rescue our \nlost \n&gt; comrade! And perhaps we could pick up a dead body and place the \nspark \n&gt; of Lightrade in it! We must go!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
