They had hurt him yes, but far from dead was he. Clinging \nto the walls of earth slowly the silver ooze climbed and climbed \never so slightly. Over the course of years it clung and scratched \nits way back to the sun. With a spurt liek an eruption of a gyser a \nshiny line of silver shot into the air. Hovering in the air it \nmolded into a metallic ball. The sun gleamed against it showing the \nspark in its center. Its conciousness searched and searched for a \nmemory a form it could manifest into. Suddenly it sprang forth arms \nand legs. It had transformed into Rodimus Prime. Lookign at his \nhands and feet his reformed memory circuts connected with his dark \nspark. The gangled voice that came forth was his spark in a \nprojected form and not of Rodimus \nPrime..&quot;P..rrrrr....o...t...o..lives!&quot; Suddenly with a burst he \ntransformed into Starscream&#39;s jet mode and blasted off towards the \nnearest Predacon base. &quot;Attention to any predacons please contact me \nand lead me to your base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
