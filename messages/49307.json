We&#39;re working on a mechanism to make the Rogues an actual \nfunctional group.  Besides, in a war, the whole IDEA is to either \ndestroy your enemies or force them to surrender.  The Rogues are \nsimply using terror tactics to KO the existing governments in their \nown time.  Now that they&#39;re here (if they ever get around to showing \nup), it&#39;s a whole new ball-game for them.\n\nWheeljack-X::\n\n&quot;Who knows?&quot; Wheeljack-X answers, mystified.  &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been to a \nlot of the sleazier starports in the galaxy, doing this or that \nrepair job to make some cash, so maybe I&#39;d be able to tell them \nsomething they don&#39;t know.
