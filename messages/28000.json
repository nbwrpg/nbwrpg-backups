Their \n&gt; attacks were nothing to be worried about, but it still added to his \n&gt; suspicions about Unitron and company. His eyes glance over to the \n&gt; scanner reports, watching something develop fairly close to \nAlliance \n&gt; island. His comm beeps.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Zardus, I&#39;m at the CF. There is a bot who looks just like Unitron \n&gt; here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus growls, tapping a few buttons. This was enough. Three \nseconds \n&gt; after a barely audable beep, the pipes blast open in the room that \n&gt; Unitron and his fellow bots were in, neuro-circuitry-destructive \ngas \n&gt; rushes to fill the room. The gas worked by seeping into any opening \n&gt; they could find in a bot (optics, mouth, nose, joints, cracks in \n&gt; armor, spaces between armor plates, etc..) and attacking any \n&gt; circuitry it touches, possibly completely destroying it. The blast \n&gt; doors of that area of the base were all closed and airtight (blast \n&gt; door every 10 feet or so, as usual). Zardus activates his comm. \n&gt; Jammers activate in the room, stopping any transmissions whatsoever \n&gt; from leaving or entering.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Alliance troops, there may be a revolt in sectors three \nthrough \n&gt; seven. Those sectors have been sealed off. Prepare for battle in \ncase \n&gt; the revolt gets out of hand. Don&#39;t rush to fight yet, those sectors \n&gt; are highly dangerous at this point, but be ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The announcement, of course, was not heard in the room where \nUnitron \n&gt; and co were. Zardus taps a few more buttons and the autoguns in the \n&gt; room emerge, aiming at the crowd of bots and firing randomly.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Future Zardus looks around the battle at the CF, watching for any \n&gt; other suspicious behavior other than what he reported to Zardus a \nfew \n&gt; seconds ago.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Astral runs out of his quarters at Zardus&#39;s transmission, his gun \nin \n&gt; hand and ready to be used. He wasn&#39;t too far from where \nthe &#39;revolt&#39; \n&gt; was taking place.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica sighs, looking to Zardus. &quot;If this don&#39;t stop, I&#39;m gonna \ngo \n&gt; insane from all the conflicts,&quot; he says to his commander, sitting \n&gt; back in his chair, bored.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer groans and activates his stun gun, preparing for any \n&gt; possible battle. He sits up and exits his quarters.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fenox jumps at the announcement of a possible revolt, her gun in \nher \n&gt; hand in under a second. &quot;You ready?&quot; She asks Vlad.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Griplash drags his sleepy self out of his quarters, both missile \n&gt; launchers ready for battle. From the next room, Recklessa emerges, \n&gt; also ready to slag some bots.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The practice bots dissapear as Havoc waves his hand after Zardus&#39;s \n&gt; announcement. He looks to Demolition and Repressor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, we get to fight real life. Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Havoc exits the training room, taking out his missile launcher. \n&gt; Repressor follows with both missile launchers drawn.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot takes out his missile launchers, remaining in his seat at \n&gt; the bridge.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Starlight yawns as she exits her quarters, her charge launcher \narmed \n&gt; and ready to go.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; (I&#39;ve tried not using Diamond as much as possible, cause I don&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; using other people&#39;s chars, but Logo loaned her to me till she gets \n&gt; back, and this is a serious situation, so I&#39;ll RP her for now)\n&gt; \n&gt; Diamond jumps out of her bed, running out of her room with her \npoison \n&gt; gun ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;        Nighteyes screams, but is hit in the leg.

The autoguns, from behinde the \n&gt; shields, \n&gt; &gt; opened fire on the newly arriving bots.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Bezerker saw Craken arrive at the Allience base, and \n&gt; scenting Hell \n&gt; &gt; Beast on him, began to join the attack on the base.\n\n\n"}}
