But she knew =\r\nthat she had to be a role model, \n&gt; &gt; and knew in her own heart, that Tucso=\r\nn wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and \n&gt; &gt; he was going to bring Rodimus bac=\r\nk, no matter what was thrown in front of \n&gt; &gt; him.  She goes over to Elita,=\r\n as Rat Trap follows her, wanting to help her \n&gt; &gt; out as well.

Even=\r\n though he \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t ride a horse with fancy armor, and carry a lance an=\r\nd a shield, \n&gt; &gt; Tucson is one of those Knights.  He won&#39;t give up until th=\r\ne dragon or in \n&gt; &gt; this case, the insect is slayed and Rodimus brought saf=\r\nely back to \n&gt; &gt; consciousness.  He will win this battle for Rodimus, I kno=\r\nw he will.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap thinks for a moment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ya know, she&#39;s g=\r\not a point Elita, everything Wheels did up till now, and \n&gt; &gt; everything he=\r\n actually succeeded in doing, that took real courage and \n&gt; &gt; determination=\r\n and in those days, on Earth, that&#39;s what medevil knights are \n&gt; &gt; made of.=\r\n So yeah, he&#39;s definitely one of them, a Knight in shining silver \n&gt; &gt; armo=\r\nr and when the lights strike against his paint job, he&#39;ll blind the \n&gt; &gt; ey=\r\nes of those who aren&#39;t used to such light.

He&#39;s gonna =\r\nkick bug aft big time, and \n&gt; &gt; when he does, he ain&#39;t gonna stop there, he=\r\n&#39;s gonna fight hard until \n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s some sorta sense of peace on this pl=\r\nanet. It&#39;s who he is and what \n&gt; &gt; he does.  And it&#39;s that drive that earne=\r\nd him his name in the first place. \n&gt; &gt; Eventually the Decepticons, Predaco=\r\nns and Unicronians are gonna definitely \n&gt; &gt; know who he is and what he&#39;s c=\r\napable of doing.  Any decendent of Optimus \n&gt; &gt; Prime is gonna be sure the =\r\njob gets done.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That gets a few heads to turn, as Quickstride, Rat =\r\nTrap and Straight Shot \n&gt; &gt; look at him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; What&#39;dya say?  No way, r=\r\neally?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Quickstride scratches behind an ear. Straight Shot and R=\r\nat Trap gawk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Wha?  Ya mean all this time I fought with Tucson in=\r\n the past, and all \n&gt; &gt; along, come ta find out he&#39;s related ta Optimus Pri=\r\nme? Wow...  I - had no \n&gt; &gt; idea..  No wonder why he&#39;s got so much courage =\r\nand determination and \n&gt; &gt; selflessness. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, that sure explains a lot.  I knew there was somethn&#39; familliar =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; about &#39;em, but I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it till Nightshift said \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; somethn&#39;.  Yeah, it makes sense, his alt form, a large truck with a large=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; trailer, he&#39;s just as tall, body features almost like Optimus Prime&#39;s=\r\n.. \n&gt; &gt; Slightly different but nearly the same.. And his voice, the pattern=\r\ns are \n&gt; &gt; almost like the big guy&#39;s..

I just so happened ta look up \n&gt; &gt; somethn&#39; i=\r\nn his file one day, when he asked me ta look over it for &#39;em and \n&gt; &gt; there=\r\n it was.  Same molds used ta build Optimus.  Of course a lotta things \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwere changed over the years, and Tucson came out different, color sceme \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and all, but he&#39;s definitely got Optimus Prime&#39;s attributes and physical =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; strength.  Well, that came after he got the power of the Matrix..  But=\r\n he \n&gt; &gt; sure had the back bone when he was just his normal self.  And Elit=\r\na, you \n&gt; &gt; can count on him ta deliver, and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s gonna=\r\n do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They all now gather around Elita to offer their reassurance.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PErcep=\r\ntor/Elita:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Amazing&quot; say dryly Perceptor while he senzed all that=\r\n power&quot;None of all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Predacons had held such power&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Then his p=\r\nractical mind focused in wish Rodimus and tucson back and well,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kup pr=\r\nayed to PRimus for the comming back of their friends.
