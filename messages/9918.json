She \nlooked up and saw a vent high up the side of the ship.  She decided \nanother tackic to gain access into the ship would be nessassary.\n\nShe walked around to the side of the ship where there was another \ndoorway.  She saw someone standing there whom she didn&#39;t know.  She \nwalked up with her hands up over her head.\n \n&quot;I wish to talk to your leader about joining you.&quot;\n\nShe knew that if they had Quickstrike, he would be in the brig.  They \nwould put her in the brig as well.  Once joined again with \nQuickstrike, they could break out together.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Talon Harvilicz &lt;talon_the_rider@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike stepped forward. &quot;Ya ain&#39;t gotta worry &#39;bout using th&#39; \nauto-guns,&quot; he told Black Arachnia. &quot;&#39;Cause ah quit!
