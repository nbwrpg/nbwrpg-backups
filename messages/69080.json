The dust had settled, the\nove=\r\nrheated engines had cooled, and the tide had receded, leaving the\nresearch =\r\nship nicely settled in the damp beach sand.\n\nDarn those Sweeps, Maul though=\r\nt to himself.  Despite his best efforts\nto avoid being shot, it looked like=\r\n his ship was down for good. \nLuckily many of the systems were still functi=\r\nonal, though he&#39;d have to\nsee about keeping them powered.\n\nHis initial scan=\r\ns of the area told him he had crashed far from where\nthe battle had been, t=\r\nhough there were a couple energy signatures a\nshort distance away - one was=\r\n very weak.  Not wanting to miss them,\nMaul set out immediately, securing h=\r\nis ship before he left.\n\nOcean, beach and jungle was the only thing he saw =\r\nfor the longest\nwhile.  Even at top speed in his new form, it took him a wh=\r\nile before\nhe finally approached the cave that the energy signatures were c=\r\noming\nfrom. \n\nSlowly, the large Transmetal 2 siberian tiger prowled up to t=\r\nhe\nentrance and then into the steamy darkness.  He could hear someone\ntalki=\r\nng...\n\n&gt; &quot;What do you want, Autobot?  It must be important if you come\nlook=\r\ning for me despite my absence.&quot; &lt;\n&gt;&quot;Yes it was a large while... I &quot; Kup did=\r\nnt know what exactly said and\nfinaly spoke &quot;You once tried to help us save =\r\nRodimus and nighlight...\nThis is our chance to get Rodimus back &#39;cause he&#39;s=\r\n held close to me,\nalso I can pick signatures from a pred group and minions=\r\n... I presume\nthat you wont desire to come back in Maximal&#39;s ranks... But a=\r\nt least I\nask your help to save Rodimus&quot; &lt;\n\nComing further inside, Maul spo=\r\ntted a bot standing over what appeared\nto be decayed remains.  He could sti=\r\nll detect a second weak energy\nsignature, but it appeared to be coming from=\r\n inside the other guy.  \n\nKeeping his distance, Maul stood where the other =\r\nguy could see him and\nwaited for him to be finished with his conversation. =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
