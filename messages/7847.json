If they want to teleport, give them \nstrict rules to follow. Since teleporting is a shift in the fabric of \ntime and space, there will be a soft audiable sound to let others now \nthat a shift happened.  But this sound is soft, so a bot may or \nmaynot hear it depending on the situation.\n\nAlso, During a fight, the teleport is an action.  Therefore once a \nbot teleports, they must wait for their opponant to respond before \nmaking another move.\n\nAnd when teleporting, a bot may not teleport more than 50 feet at a \ntime.  \nSince people want to be able to teleport try this on and tell me what \nyou think))))\n\n\nPredacon: Shoots at Maximal.\n\nMaximal: Teleports behind Predacon before shot hit.(teleport is one \naction)\n\nPredacon:: hears the sound and turns to face the Maximal.(reaction to \nmove) Aims gun and fires at Maximal.(one action)\n\nMaximal:: Maximal teleports before shot hits and is now behind the \nPredacon again.\n\nPredacon:: hears sound, turns and sweeps the legs of the Maximal.\n\nMaximal:: falls down from leg sweep and draws sword.(reaction to \nmove) Slashes at Predacon.(one action)\n\nPredacon:: Sword cuts chest plate but not that deep.(reaction to \nmove) Teleports 35 feet away from Maximal(teleport is one action).\n\nMaximal:: Teleports to behind Predacon.(teleport is one action)\n\nThis is just an example of how this may work if this is allowed into \nthe rules.  But if one bot gains teleporting capabilities, then \nothers will have to be able to deside if this is a good thing for \nthier characters or not.  his may benefit some characters, but not \nothers.  This is only my humble suggestion.  I leave it up to the \nCouncil to have the final say on this matter.\n\nAND NOW ON WITH THE RPG!\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
