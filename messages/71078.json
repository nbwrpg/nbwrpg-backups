A look of sheer\ndetermi=\r\nnation floods his face. He had not answered Kup right away, but\nneeded not =\r\nto, as his body langauge fortells that of a determined Autobot,\nsworn to du=\r\nty, and prepared to go as much distance as needed. In the midsts\nof the wav=\r\ne, he picks up a blip. He detects the intruder inside, and with\nthat wave, =\r\npinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone what\nhe&#39;d be up=\r\n to next. With transmission still underway, he approaches the ark\ncalmly, w=\r\nith an alert stride to his walk. The only one who would know what\nhe&#39;d be u=\r\np to, would be Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar systems have picked up the int=\r\nruder.

Can you give me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;\n=\r\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=93One moment.=94 Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then=\r\n the front\ndoor to the Ark began to slowly slide open. =93You should have c=\r\nomplete access\nto the Ark, as does everyone else.=94\n\nAs Tuscon moved forwa=\r\nrd though low energy reserve alarm signals began to go\noff in Tuson=92s hea=\r\nd. His wounds, his own energy loss over his trip back\nfinally beginning to =\r\ncatch up with him. While his wounds were bound so he\nleaked no further ener=\r\ngy, he had yet to get to a recharging chamber, and the\ntremendous amounts o=\r\nf energy that he was putting out to maintain his wave\nwas further depleting=\r\n his already low energy reserves.\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Owww.. That wave is real=\r\nly hurting my relays.. Wait a sec, my radars are\npicking up activity all ov=\r\ner the place. We need ta amplify that wave of\nyours.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks down=\r\n to her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power already Straight Shot. Unless of course, Le=\r\ngacy can rig\nup an amplifier within the Ark to supplement my sonar attack.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m=\r\n asking a favor on Tucsons\nbehalf. His waves are strong enough to pick up e=\r\nnemy forces in wide range,\nbut he wants to take it up a notch and see if he=\r\n can immobilize them at a\nfurther range. Kind of put them in a stall for no=\r\nw. Can you set up an\namplifier signal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? =\r\nIt would be greatly\nappreciated.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy=92s cold voice can be hear=\r\nd over Tuscon=92s radio, =93Many of the Ark=92s\nsystems are also being affe=\r\ncted by the wave you are transmitting.

I have no resources\navailable to comply with your reque=\r\nst.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the Ark, Night Shift catches something on his r=\r\nadar, and begins to\npick up a little speed, buzzing a bit ahead of Kup, lik=\r\ne a hunting dog\nfixated on it&#39;s target.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;S A=\r\n PRED SIGNATURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;re not far\nfrom our targets Kup, I can feel =\r\n&#39;em!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap too, senses them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s right!

He narrows his\noptics dangerously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s i=\r\nt? Hide and seek... Been there, done that a million\ntimes. Signal&#39;s faint, =\r\nbut I know you&#39;re out there.&quot;\n\n\nOOC: Keep in mind, it was ONLY the intruder=\r\n inside the Ark who=92s stealth\nshielding went down. Blackrazor has an acti=\r\nve shield that was disrupted by\nTuscon=92s wave. The Sweep=92s stealth is o=\r\nf a different sort and at the moment\nis unaffected by it.

As soon as\nthey leave the vicinity of Hydras, the Preda=\r\ncon leader looses the advantage\nof their stealth and immediately begins sho=\r\nwing up on Maximal radar screens!\nHowever the sweeps still maintain their s=\r\ntealth, and only those who can\nphysically see them are aware of them.\n\nWith=\r\n a viciousness all their own, they begin to open fire on the Maximals!\n\nTus=\r\ncon receives a call from Legacy, =93Tuscon, I am receiving readings of a\nsi=\r\nngle Predacon in your area, his IFF signal identifying him as Hydras.=94\nAl=\r\nthough there was a certain level of urgency in his voice, Legacy was still\n=\r\ncalm and reserved as he made his tranmission.\n\n\n\nBack inside the Ark the in=\r\ntruder frowned as he realized that his bomb had\nnot gone off. With a whispe=\r\nred curse he continued to try to adapt his\nstealth shielding to Tuscon=92s =\r\nwave. With a worried look he began to run down\nthe hall, if he couldn=92t s=\r\nneak out, he would BLAST his way out!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\r\n--001485eba3a86d71c3049e89a670\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Inside=\r\n the bridge, Quickstride does as Windlord tells him and with a swift hand. =\r\nHe waits for the result but with a tense expression on his face.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot;It&#39;s done, let&#39;s hope that did somethin=\r\ng to our advantage.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic san=\r\ns ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,=\r\nsans-serif&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;comic sans ms,sans-serif&quot;&gt;Q=\r\nuickstride=92s work is indeed swift and sure.

He had not answered K=\r\nup right away, but needed not to, as his body langauge fortells that of a d=\r\netermined Autobot, sworn to duty, and prepared to go as much distance as ne=\r\neded. In the midsts of the wave, he picks up a blip. He detects the intrude=\r\nr inside, and with that wave, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wasn&#39;t ab=\r\nout to tell anyone what he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still und=\r\nerway, he approaches the ark calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. The =\r\nonly one who would know what he&#39;d be up to, would be Legacy.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar systems have picked up the in=\r\ntruder. I know of his location and I&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him=\r\n, if I continue to transmit.

His waves are strong enough to pick up enemy forces in wide range, but he=\r\n wants to take it up a notch and see if he can immobilize them at a further=\r\n range.
