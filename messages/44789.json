I&#39;m in a MUSH, that takes place solely on \nCybertron.  And \n&gt; it is way better than the NBW.  Cybertron would just require lots of \n&gt; thinking.  Like the millions if not billions of civilians that would \nbe on \n&gt; the planet, and since all we do in this RPG is fight we&#39;d have to \ntake that \n&gt; into account.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because most factions in the NBW have, if they&#39;re big, 20 \ncharacters, and 20 \n&gt; characters would mean jack crap compared to a population of millions \nor \n&gt; billions.)\n\n\n"}}
