And counting that his energy was weak wasn&#39;t helping. He \ncouldn&#39;t run his core temperature as high as he wanted to warm \nhimself. Slag it to the Pit, he wasn&#39;t happy here. He was paranoid \nthat the others could kill him, and it was all about this strange \ndamage that he didn&#39;t know what to make of it.\n\nHe could stay out here as much as he could until he found out what \nwas wrong, or forcing his body to fix it. He kept on walking, \nstepping high against the snow.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
