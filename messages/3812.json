He \nwas surprised that she hadn&#39;t reckonized him. He nearly risked his life her \nher. That ungrateful slag!\n\nBut he got thinking. Scorponok was the one in charge of reprograming her. He \nmust of done it wrong. He should have done it himself, if it weren&#39;t for his \nlegs.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s on-line,&quot; was the only thing he said, then turned his attention back \nto Black Arachnia. He managed a grin on his mouth plate to let her know.\n\nHe groaned as he heard Shredder insult him over his comm-link. He lowered \nhis head and snarled back into it: &quot;Don&#39;t argue, tin-horn. Megatron gave me \nth&#39; position. Go t&#39; him if ya got uh problem wit&#39; it! But as far as ah&#39;m \nconcern&#39;d, get out there! Ah gave ya uh job, now do it!&quot;\n\nHe brought his head back up. He said to Black Arachnia, &quot;Can&#39;t get no \nrespect wit&#39; these tin-horns. Think they&#39;re better than me.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
