He\n&gt; shakes his head. It must be all the damage he had taken in the battle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Firearm spins around as the voice sounds in his ears. He turns around\n&gt; again, looking at Kluster and knowing that the other bot had heard it\n&gt; to.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster looks over at Tarantopulous. &quot;No, the lockdown isn&#39;t in\n&gt; effect anymore.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The two bots reach the CR chambers, Firearm putting Chordate in one\n&gt; and Kluster setting Proto down on a table. Neither of them said\n&gt; anything about the voice. Kluster looks over at Tarantopulous.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You should get some repairs. We all need them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, he enters a CR, the practically undamaged Firearm setting\n&gt; off for the bridge.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler frowns as he hears the voice, his optics adjusting to the\n&gt; momentary increase in light. He looks over at Necromancer. &quot;Did you\n&gt; hear that?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
