The situation inside the cave involing the two \nbots and Megatron made him nervous. He needed air and to stay out of the \nway. The scorpion and mouse made him sick, but he tried his best to mind his \nown business.\n\nHe walked towards the mouth of the cave. He looked behind his arms where \nsmall red wings were. He knew he was a flier. So he thought of doing what a \nflier usually did taht others couldn&#39;t. Use his air superiority to get away \nfrom it all. He lifted himself into the air, bending his long legs.\n\n&quot;Beast mode,&quot; he commanded to his activation code with his gruff voice. He \nflipped upside down, transforming to his beast mode, a red pterrorsaur. He \nflapped his fleshy wings, taking off higher. He used the faint up-drifts to \ngain altitude. He circled, extending his wing spand. He viewed the \nlandscape, staying in the range of the Predacon cave. He saw a lake and a \nforest in the distance.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
