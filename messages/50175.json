She used her \nclawed paws to keep from going too fast, followed closely by Horn who \ncarried Firaxis on his back.\n\nThey all stopped when she planted her pincer-like tail in the ice near \nthe bottom.\n\nMeteara: Now comes the fun and dangerous part... Do not transform \nuntil I say so. Even if the radiations here can be recharging, the \nabsence of the field can overload our circuitry.\n\nFiraxis: What are you going to do?\n\nMeteara: I&#39;ll create the field...\n\nShe transformed and opened her pincered left arm towards the sphere. A \nsparkling ray of electricity shot at the sphere.\n\nMeteara: Now! Quick! And come near to me! Whatever happens, endure the \npain!\n\nThey both executed themselves and arcs of energy started to jolt from \nher. Two massive jolts converged on the two cybertronians and started \ntaking their energy at an alarming rate. They all convulsed in pain, \nbut the ray soon stopped, and there was no more noise.\n\nThe two transformers fell to the ground, but Meteara managed to stay \nconscious a little longer.\n\nMeteara: There... The sphere... is secure.\n\nThen she blacked out.\n\n\n"}}
