In which he was glad to exit.\nHe looked around as he entered into the sunlight, the sudden change in shading causing him to blink a few times before focusing once again. A snarl escaping his lips.\nOnce his vision was clear he looked straight towards Reptilica, watching his every move while keeping a similar watch on the remainder of their escort. Reptilica seemed as determined as ever to snatch the detonator from Prowl�s clutches, as well as his small army ready to fire when ready.\nDinobot was beginning to become even more uncomfortable then he had entering the enemy base, the fact that they were being escorted by 6 enemies was not making it any better.\nHe continued to bring up the rear as the other Maximals continued towards the edge of the clearing, occasionally scanning behind to remain aware of the enemy position. There was no room for mistakes!\nAs they come to the edge of the clearing Dinobot looked back towards the 6 Alliance bots as they remained near to their ship, thinking that at any moment the auto defenses might activate and begin to fire upon them. However, for the moment�the defenses remained quiet.\nHis attention was suddenly caught by the sudden sound of Prowl�s voice, then simply turning his head towards the feathered Maximal as he continued to keep a scan on the enemy.\nHowever near they were to reaching the edge of the clearing he knew that if something went wrong, even the slightest thing, it could mean the death of one or more of them!\nBut then one sudden word hit Dinobot like a slap in the face, one in which he knew he would hear but was hoping not to. Run?!\nA snarl developed on his lips as he turned the word over in his mind. Warriors DID NOT run!\nHe had watched as Tavatron had turned in his direction and had looked over his shoulder-plate towards the enemy, hearing her soft snarl before hand. Seeing the expression on her face change from determined to convince, most likely coming to the conclusion that running would not be such a bad idea after all.\nKeeping his attention where it mattered the most, upon the Alliance, he carefully classed and identified their weaponry. Most of it was all high standard but there were a few weapons there that could almost blow a bot in two if they were struck. In which he knew that if he was to get Tavatron out of there alive�they had to avoid.\nDinobot didn�t look back over his shoulder as Tavatron turned back around, voicing that running was not all that bad a suggestion. And by the readings in which he had collected with his scans�he did not think so either.\nBut why run? He was not injured, not at all. But he also knew that it was also a very stupid question. Six fully armed Alliance bots against one fully armed and fully active warrior.\nSuddenly images from his past slowly forming in his mind and fading back into the darkness just as slowly. Images in which he knew, images in which he did not quite wish to face�and wished to forget.\nThe prehistoric valley, Megatron�s forces. Destroying�it all. Primitive humanoids running for their lives, everything afire.\nIt was all still so fresh in his mind, all so�new. Almost as if he had just been there, like he had just seen everything.\nThe feelings it caused, the thoughts. All he new and all he felt right there and then.\nIt was in that very time, in that very moment in his past that he had gone up against 6 Predacons. The exact same number in which was at his back at this very moment.\nThe images faded into the shadows of him mind once again, faded to be left with the memory of his awesome victory!\nDinobot growled deeply. But a victory in which was paid with his life.\nSo in which, he COULD win if he chose to stay. The odds of succeeding in this situation had the same odds of victory in which the past did. But all in all, he did not then and would not now survive to glory over his ultimate victory. So, there was no point.\nWith a snarl he then looked directly in front of himself again, his optics coming to rest on Tavatron�s back plate. \nHe had no wish to die, not again. He had already received the heroic recycling in which he had always wished�he was satisfied. Now, continuing in the same war in which he had seen the beginning�he had a chance to start over. A chance to experience new things if he so much as desired to, but there was a great deed to be done before he could put the past to rest and get on with this new life.\nHe remembered the past, and most of it bothered him greatly. Just as he had done cycles before, he had zoned out to simply concentrate upon the images of his past demise. If  he had been in the center of a battle he could have been taken completely unawares and possibly destroyed.\nHe HAD to put the past to rest, somehow.\nAs the edge of the clearing came within a few feet of himself he then turned his attention back towards the Alliance enemies, this time noticing just how tense they all seemed.\nDinobot then snapped his optics towards Tavatron in cold realization, there was going to be a battle!\nBy the way they stood with their weapons and clear scent of stress in the air it was clear to him that they were waiting�but for what?\nHe then snarled as the answer came to his mine, his optics narrowing. Of course! They were waiting for Prowl to get rid of the detonator! Then the attack would come!\nDinobot studied Tavatron�s wounds carefully, deciding whether or not her speed would be able to be fast enough to get out of base weapons fire. By his judgement she would be stiff from the cold steel of the table in which she had been strapped to for slag knows how long, and her systems were slightly damaged from some other small attack.\nIn simple, even in beast mode she may be slower then was advised. And he had no intention to leave her behind, no matter what the cost. He hadn�t saved her from total pain only to get slagged by her tormenters.\nWith a growl he quickened his pace and came up beside her, his optics straight ahead of him as he kept pace.*\n\n� Very soon, there will be battle.�\n\n* His voice was low enough so that the fellow Maximals ahead could not hear, however, he would be able to be picked up clearly by the fembot in which he walked beside.\nWith a serious expression it would be hard for one to see the concern just beyond, but it was there. As long as Tavatron�s life was in danger it would always BE there.\nClenching his fist he snarled.*\n\n� And you are in no condition to fight, let alone run.�\n\n* Dinobot then turned his head slightly away and towards his shoulder, quickly looking at the position of the enemy before looking straight ahead again. His tail slightly swinging with anticipation of the upcoming battle, yet knowing that he could not participate in it if he was to get Tavatron out of there safely. \nHis voice was not angry but it was stern enough to let anybot know that he was not just saying what he was to for the fun of it.*\n\n� Perhaps it would be wiser if I were to carry you.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
