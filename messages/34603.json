Some other blasts dug into his leg but he ignored the pain.\n\nHe fired off five rapid emerald optic blasts down at Hot Rod.  Raising both \narms, he fired a missile from each.\n\nOne at Hot Rod, the other at Iron Raptor (if she&#39;s at the battle, if she \nain&#39;t just ignore the second missile).\n\n&quot;Give up, Autobot.  I am greater than anything you can possibly imagine.  I \ndefeated the God of Light, Primus.  You are no match for me.&quot;\n\n---\n\nTeufel avoided the shots fired upon him, which were mostly base defenses.  He \nraised both arms, firing a missile from each.  Both heading for the Element \n(starship).\n\nHis turrets fired ten rapid laser blasts each, a total of twenty rapid laser \nblasts lancing out at Element&#39;s (gestalt) legs.  He looked to Unicron to \ncheck on his situation and right now it seemed alright.  The scanning was \ncomplete, but he had not been upgraded with the proper technology by the \nChaos-Bringer, so he could not transform to his copycat mode.\n\n\n\n"}}
