Zardus&#39; memories really did \nhappen.\n\n\n::Zardus/Havoc/Demolition::\n\n&quot;That first shake was the taking off,&quot; Zardus replies, &quot;If you wish, \nyou can exit and have a look around.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemolition walks over to a CR tank, putting Delta into it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc puts Feline&#39;s parts on the table, waiting for a command from \nZardus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus walks over to another CR tank, putting Squizzy into it before \nwalking over to a table. He lays the bot he had been carrying onto \nit, looking at the black sheet that covere&#39;d the bot&#39;s body and head.\n\nThe bot was a relic from the old days of the Alliance, a relic that \nhad nearly caused Zardus leadership at one point. His hand takes the \nsheet that covered the bot, sliding it off his face.\n\nThe relic was himself. Not a clone, not a copy, not a projection, but \nZardus himself. The Alliance leader glances down at the blue orb that \nwas melted into his left palm and through his left hand, looking at \nhis other self&#39;s identical orb. That orb was the physical \nmanifistation of the Vok being that had started the Alliance, a long \ntime ago...\n\nThe bot on the table was totaly identical to Zardus, except that he \nwas older, much older, by a few hundred years. He had been Zardus, \nhad lived Zardus&#39; life, and at one point traveled back through time, \nending up a few hundred years before the Neo Beast Wars and going \ntemporarily offline. Zardus had found him and reactivated him in a \ncave shortly after he had started the Alliance.\n\nFuture Zardus, as he had been dubbed, joined the Alliance for a \nwhile, but then tried to take over. He would have been successful, \nbut Nemesis had taken him out with a missile to the back after \nZergling had attacked him.\n\nZardus frowns, turning the bot over to look at the charred hole in \nhis back. He picks him up, putting him into a CR tank.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc and Demolition look on in confusion as Zardus puts Zardus in a \nCR tank.\n\n&quot;Should we stay here, Zardus?&quot; Havoc asks, looking at the Alliance \nleader.\n\n&quot;You may leave if you wish,&quot; Zaruds replies, checking a screen for \nrepair progress, &quot;If anyone is having trouble getting to base, help \nthem.&quot;\n\nHavoc and Demolition nod, walking out of the room.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe five shuttles that had carried the Alliance base to the island \nturn around, heading back to the mainland to transport any more \nground troops if needed.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Punch:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Punch shook his head slightly.  &quot;Arrived, sir?  When did we leave?  \nWhen did \n&gt; we leave?&quot; he checked the scanners.  &quot;Base is in perfect condition.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
