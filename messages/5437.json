He had stepped out of the CR tank a few \ncycles ago, and now he was dizzy and his stomach hurt. He thought. A few \ndays ago, his body was put to his limits. Perhaps his systems were telling \nhim to slow down. But he didn&#39;t like that. Not to mention he had lost a lot \nof weight. He had nearly starved to death a while ago.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Fri, 30 Jun 2000 22:57:02 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;*Stingtra started to get in the water when she saw Quickstrike.

He waited until\n&gt; &gt; Stingtra went into the water, then he laid down. He went on his side,\n&gt; &gt; drawing his knees up and squinted. He didn&#39;t clearly understand. Why did\n&gt;he\n&gt; &gt; feel this way? His stomach hurt. He covered his head with a scaly arm. \n&gt;He\n&gt; &gt; groaned and closed his eyes.
