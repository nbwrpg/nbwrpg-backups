I admit, there are more o=\r\nf them, then there are of us.

We got a great team here but, we need more help.

I =\r\nused ta be a communications operator on Iacon before we came to Earth. I co=\r\nuld start putting a call out on Autobot frequency and see if anyone picks u=\r\np.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson smiles and nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s a long shot but, a very good idea. Ye=\r\ns, please do that. Lord Elder if you could, allow Straightshot access to Te=\r\nletran One, and see if she can acquire an Autobot frequency. Legacy, I woul=\r\nd like you to monitor that rip in the time space continuum and see if you c=\r\nan get an idea as to who may have caused it. Remember, the more intel we ha=\r\nve the better off we are.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns =\r\nto Optimal Rodimus Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we a=\r\nre able to fly, we should scope the parameters according to what Legacy com=\r\nes up with. When we do the fly over, we have to make it look like a casual =\r\nflight rather than a probing mission. The humans who are here now , may not=\r\n know what we are exactly, and we should keep it as such. They know Nightsh=\r\nift is a Maximal but they have not met us yet. Leo, Big Convoy, we will nee=\r\nd you to survey the ground areas where we can not see them from the air.
