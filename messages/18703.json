The \nships hull was torn and scortched from the entry into the earths \natmosphere.  One wing had broken off and hit the Allience ship.  No \ndamamge was done to the Allience ship, but the wing shattered and lay \nin pieces on the ground.  The main body of Diamond&#39;s ship was \nscortched and dented.  Wired were exposed and some fuel was leaking \nfrom the fuel tanks.  Smoke poured out of a hole in the side of the \nship as the engine room was now on fire.  Smoke started to fill the \ninterior of the ship as it sat there.  (The ship is about the size of \nte NASA space shuttle Challenger or Space shuttle Discovery)\n\nDiamond was slumped over the console in the Captain&#39;s seat.  \nUnconsious and bruised from the rough voyage, she was unaware of the \nthick black smoke that was slowly filling the bridge. \n\n\n"}}
