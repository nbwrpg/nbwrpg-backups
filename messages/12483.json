She hoped he would be successful \nin what ever he had in mind.  She turned and went to her room and \nlayed down on the bed and fell asleep in wolf mode.\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe sat there and wondered how much she could take now that she had \nthis new gift.  She layed down and looked at the drone. &quot;Go away.  I \ndon&#39;t want you to be here right now.&quot;  The drone left her room.  She \nstood up next to the bed and let go of it.  She walked very slowly \naround the room.  She smiled,&quot;Yup, I think I can make this work for \nme.&quot;  She went back to the bed and layed down again.  The shaking \ncame back, but it was worse this time.  She hoped it would it go away \nlike Black Aracnia said it would.  She closed her eyes and waited for \nthe shaking to stop.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, crow_lord@h... wrote:\n&gt; Scorponok/Sniper\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scorponok looks at KitKat, &quot;I will go, but first I will put a bomb \non \n&gt; me so if they attack me, I will blow them up.&quot; Scopronok walks to \nhis \n&gt; lab and walks out with a backpack on his back. &quot;I shall be off.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Sniper aims his rifle at Oblitron&#39;s wounds.
