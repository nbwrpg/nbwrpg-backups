In front he saw the ship, \nbehind him was hills, to his left a forest, and to the right  an open field. \n  The sun was setting making the whole seen look like a picture.  The battle \nhas taken it&#39;s toll on the land, blast holes and scorch marks on just about \nanything and every thing.  it was sad, why must so much be destroyed to \nchange what will be so little.\n\nthe forest was smoking, but no fire was on heat sensors.  animals were \nrunning out of there bird flying and other smaller thing running and mother \ndeer was laying on the ground, and it&#39;s cub nudging her to wake up.  But she \nwouldn&#39;t budge. the field covered in cared and burnt things, empty shells, \nbroken pieces of armor, mech. fluid.  the hills were a carasy mix all every \nthing he has seen.  Fire, shells, armor, mech. fluid, and holes in the \nhills.  The ship was the worst of all.  metal pieces every where, the ship \nwas on fire power was lost in some sections of the ship. holes, dents, more \nmech. fluid. it was the worst he&#39;s seen in a long while.\n\nSO much caos, pain, suffering, anger, revenge, and even with all the bad \nemotions there was even hope, love, and sadness.  It was just too much to \nfor his body to handle. In front, and behind, to the side, EVERY WHERE he \nlook it was there it was just too much to handle.  Around, and around every \nthing was spinning.  Here, there, every where. And then it was all black.\n\n�*static*.....Delta......Delta, come in....ANSWER ME SLAG YOU!.....MY ORDER \nWAS TO RETUNR TO BASE NOW GO!....out....*static�\n\n�I must go�.� And with that Delta limped his way back to base.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
