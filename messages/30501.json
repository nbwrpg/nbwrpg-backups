He\nturned around to where Ice lay, he knew that either her or Lunarpine were\ncausing this. He decided to try some more logic, &quot;You haven&#39;t told them what\nVeratis intends for the Maximals when his army of mutants are complete have\nyou?&quot;\n\nLunarpine rushed to Ice&#39;s side, he could see her strain. &quot;I don&#39;t know what\nyou&#39;re doing to him but I want you to stop before you hurt yourself.&quot; His\nconcern for her was interupted by Megatons comment about Veratis. &quot;Shut up\nmonster or I&#39;ll show you whats in store for ANY traitor who comes around\nme.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 21, 2001 11:23 AM\nSubject: Re: Ice/ New battle\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She was flung through the air and landed on her tail.

Just as he was ready to lash out in\n&gt; anger he came\n&gt; &gt; to the unproven fact that he was Megaton, indestructible leader of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Predacons. (In his mind anyway.)

She roared out as the teeth peirced the flesh and almost\n&gt; tore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the wing from her shoulder.  She still swiped at him.  Then she\n&gt; tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another idea.  She closed her eyes, ignoring the pain, and sent\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental image of the dragon&#39;s scales starting to fall off.  Then\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon&#39;s skin started to peel away. MEch fluid running fast down\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body.  It was a grusome thought, but she tried hard to make the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon think it was really happening.
