The amoeba \n&gt; thingy definately won&#39;t work, so ditch it. To hopefully end \n&gt; discussion of this, Cutie is, by the IRON HAND of the council, now a \n&gt; translucent, transparent ghost on earth, awaiting a blank protoform \n&gt; to posses. He will start in mid Africa, and you can take if it from \n&gt; there. How Cutie finds a protoform is up to you, but make sure that \n&gt; it is reasonable. (if you are unsure, ASK!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Read the following and comply:\n&gt; \n&gt; NO MORE OOC POSTS. I&#39;m going to ban the next person who makes a \n&gt; violation. (note: there are exceptions)\n&gt; \n&gt; Try to refrain from posting more than 10 times a day, OMG is it \n&gt; frustrating to read through each post, especially when several of \n&gt; them are pushing our limits for moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO READ ROLEPLAING 101A and 101B IN THE \n&gt; nbwrpg.com messageboard. NO BUTS. I&#39;m tempted to create a quiz to \n&gt; make sure everyone has read it. I&#39;m also tempted to create a quiz \n&gt; about the rules, cause they are important, and I don&#39;t feel like \n&gt; reciting them to each person who decides that they don&#39;t need to \n&gt; check them.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also going to be another vote on restart vs sequel. We urge \n&gt; people to really think about which would be BETTER FOR THE RPG. I \n&gt; think you&#39;ll find that a restart is a better choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (OOC)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; /rant mode on\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To clear things up a bit before the kindegarden rejects get sent \n&gt; to the corner:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) a single celled anything would not have a pupose. To have \n&gt; purpose you have to be self aware which said organisms are not.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) No a single celled organism could not exist in space. While it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t need to breath it still needs to absorb material to survive. \n&gt; Space dust is not going to keep it alive...if the radiation in space \n&gt; doesn&#39;t kill it instantly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) If you&#39;re going to have a &quot;ghostly&quot; entity floating about at \n&gt; least do some research on previous occurances. Starscream happens to \n&gt; be the prime example of this type of character. His spark for \n&gt; whatever reason did not join the matrix when his body got slagged on \n&gt; multiple occassions. His spark roamed space &quot;possessing&quot; bots. This \n&gt; is the closest sensible thing I could compare this cutie crap to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Last but certainly least can you guys ever just agree to \n&gt; disagree and let the council settle an arguement instead of \n&gt; squabbling like spoiled children? I know rauq and the others must be \n&gt; busy but getting 50 odd emails, 90% of which is a bitch fest back \n&gt; and forth is annoying.\n\n\n"}}
