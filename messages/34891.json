Hotmail isn&#39;t\n&gt; letting her log in, so I am to send this for her. The following is \nher\n&gt; writing:\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; +++Element Galactors Cyndro+++\n&gt; \n&gt; Element jumped into the air, turned, and avoided a lot of missiles.\n&gt; Many shots riddled his armor but did barely any damage. He picked \nout\n&gt; the largest robot on the battle field, which was Menasor, and ran at\n&gt; him while he fired two missiles at the gestalt.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Galactor jets both detected Megatron cowardly escaping into\n&gt; Astroblast, and headed for the Decepticon. They came to position\n&gt; behind him and each launched two missiles at Astroblast. The\n&gt; Vycir/Slasys jet was still cloaked.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Missile after missile hit the Maximal City, and for the first time,\n&gt; Cyndro felt the shields weaken by a precentage point. But the\n&gt; Decepticon achievement was short lived, because seconds later the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire&#39;s old shield generators were online, and Maximal\n&gt; City&#39;s shield flared brighter than it was before and extended a bit.\n&gt; Cyndro could see that a lot of bots were coming in for CR treatment,\n&gt; so he had lights turn on on the ground of the hallways to lead to \nthe\n&gt; CR room.\n\n\n"}}
