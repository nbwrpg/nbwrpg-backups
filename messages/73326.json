The\n&gt; more eyes we have, the better.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEGACY turned to regard TUCSON coldly, his normal expression it would\nseem. &quot;Yes another of my kind has arrived and she has been programmed\nto be a temporal guardian, but her spark was damaged in translating us\nto this time frame. She possesses the same knowledge as I, but what\nshe will do with that knowledge I cannot know.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause from LEGACY and then he spoke, &quot;I believe she is\namong the Predacons.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightight moved silently near Rodimus\n\nRODIMUS gave NIGHTLIGHT a gentle squeeze as she moved next to him.\n&quot;Then we need to go figure out if this is true and the extent of the\ndamage, and see if we can fix it.&quot;\n\nThere was a contemplative light from LEGACY&#39;s optic, &quot;I can tell you\nwhat she is most probably revealing to the Predacons.&quot; LEGACY said\nevenly.\n\n&quot;Spill it!&quot; POLAR CLAW, who was also standing amidst the group. &quot;We\ndon&#39;t have time for the dramatics here.&quot;\n\nBIG CONVOY laid a calming hand on POLAR CLAW as LEGACY apparently\nignored the outburst.\n\n&quot;A rip in the time space continuum has been opened.&quot; LEGACY said. &quot;One\nthat I surmise has been opening for quite some time, one that has most\nlikely been exacerbated by recent activities.&quot;\n\nOf course LEGACY meant the recent conflict with MAGMATRON and\nSABERBACK and the creation of NEMESIS PRIME.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
