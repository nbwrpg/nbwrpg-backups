For those\n&gt; with enhanced senses this place was teemi=\r\nng with all sorts of life\n&gt; from the large to the small. However one thing =\r\nwould make itself\n&gt; abundantly clear to cybertronians almost immediately. A=\r\nll\n&gt; communications appeared to be out. All tracking beacons, com-links and=\r\n\n&gt; signals had been cut off. For those inside the jungle there was no\n&gt; com=\r\nmunication at all with the outside, and to those outside the jungle\n&gt; it wa=\r\ns as if TUSCON and WHEELIE had just disappeared.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, interestingl=\r\ny enough, the sensors of anyone with even a\n&gt; modicum of detection gear sho=\r\nuld be able to pick up a low level &#39;hum&#39;\n&gt; of strange energy that suffused =\r\nthe entire area. Not a force field but\n&gt; just an energy wave that was in th=\r\ne background of things. To those who\n&gt; were familiar with it, the =E2=80=98=\r\nhum=E2=80=99 had a Unicronian signature to it\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - WHEELIE&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nNot having a more explicit idea fo what was going on, Wheelie gingerly\n&gt;&gt; c=\r\nontinued, one step at a time, going slowly and warily.  Keeping his energon=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; slingshot in a subspace pocket but fully charged, so should it come ove=\r\nr to\n&gt;&gt; combat he could immediately whip it out to engage someone, and keep=\r\ning\n&gt;&gt; enough space between himself and the underbrush if he was ambushed h=\r\ne would\n&gt;&gt; have some room to react.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The trek that=\r\n WHEELIE is on has brought him out into more open areas\n&gt; of the jungle. Th=\r\ne canopy of trees has grown unusually thick meaning\n&gt; that the underbrush h=\r\nas died back, leaving the floor of the jungle,\n&gt; while uneven, relatively c=\r\nlear of plant life. The area is dark, but\n&gt; not overly so, much like a day =\r\nin the open as the sun was setting, or\n&gt; perhaps behind dense storm clouds.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The silence around WHEELIE was becoming more pronounced as he moved\n&gt;=\r\n forward. He could see signs that larger animals had indeed moved\n&gt; through=\r\n the area. The bark had been knocked off or actual dents or\n&gt; cuts made in =\r\nthe trees themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Twin optics appeared glowing from the shadows bu=\r\nt strangely enough\n&gt; WHEELIE is unable to lock on it with any sort of senso=\r\nrs.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As he nears a large tree, his outstretched =\r\narms allow him to catch a giant\n&gt;&gt; branch with both hands as he swings off =\r\nit like a skilled gymnast .  After a\n&gt;&gt; spin or two, to build his momentum,=\r\n he vaults to a lower branch and\n&gt;&gt; continues to do so until he finally tou=\r\nches down for a flawless landing as\n&gt;&gt; he uses his arms for balance.  Leaf =\r\nlitter falls in his wake as he first\n&gt;&gt; looks around to get his bearings.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As TUSCON landed on the jungle floor high over head a flock =\r\nof birds\n&gt; at the top of the canopy of trees rose into the air obviously st=\r\nartled\n&gt; by his passing, the sound of their calls filling the air for a mom=\r\nent.\n&gt; However soon enough the birds flew off to find new places to roost a=\r\nnd\n&gt; to find food.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ground that TUSCON has landed is still relative=\r\nly open, but he can\n&gt; easily make out the path leading further into the jun=\r\ngle where the\n&gt; trees and undergrowth would make travel more difficult for =\r\nanyone.\n&gt; Large trees surround him on all sides. Many of them had been knoc=\r\nked\n&gt; down by large animals of some sort, but the evidence of this\n&gt; destru=\r\nction became less and less the further in he looked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Enhanced senses c=\r\nould easily make out the plethora of life that lived\n&gt; in the jungle as ani=\r\nmals and birds of all shapes and sizes made their\n&gt; home in the miles and m=\r\niles of this wooded area. However his enhanced\n&gt; senses could also pick up =\r\nthe movement of something else, that moved\n&gt; out in the brush ahead of him.=\r\n However his sensors were unable to pick\n&gt; up on it. He could see a figure =\r\nahead that looked vaguely humanoid in\n&gt; the distance, although with the bru=\r\nsh and foliage between him and them\n&gt; it was difficult to distinguish size =\r\nand configuration.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
