I thought \nthat since Oblitertron was a lot bigger than Arcangel, I didn&#39;t think \nthat there would be much physical contest as to Oblitertron taking \nher from Arcangle.  Like taking a doll from a child, it was about the \nsize difference.  I didn&#39;t mean to cause any confusion.  But I have \nalready posted that Dark One had her in his cock pit.  I&#39;ll just roll \non that. \n\nYeah. I&#39;ll just stay with her inside DarkOne. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; And if you&#39;d read the posts, Dark One didn&#39;t eat her, Oblitertron \njerked her \n&gt; away. She did respond and everything, but I didn&#39;t know about the \nfire shield.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, since this has to do with Logo&#39;s char, lets let her \ndecide. Whatever \n&gt; she says (Who has Squizzy: Dark One or Arcangel) will be final then.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::The Oblitercons/DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer laughs as he gets the Lavacon&#39;s transmission. &quot;We \ncaptured?
