The wind\n&gt; was strong and fast enough to carry him on outstretched wings as he glides\n&gt; swiftly across the darkening sky.  Then a faint scent catches his nostrils.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re in the right direction, Rodimus.  I can smell him.  Neither Maximal,\n&gt; Autobot, Decepticon or Predacon.  It&#39;s far more foul than that.  I believe\n&gt; I&#39;ve just locked in on our query. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A mighty dragon on the hunt, Tucson swiftly flies onward and spots a mech\n&gt; floating in the air, hovering.  Not having encountered Saberback, he stops\n&gt; and circles the area around him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, be ready.  Leo Prime, We&#39;re here.  I have the enemy sighted.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson makes himself heard with a very loud roar.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOOC: Sandy, since you posted Tuscon as arriving already I am doing a\nsmall time jump.\n\nOOC: Airly, several hours have passed and I am merging the post\nbetween Tuscon and the Preds. The Preds are carrying out Hydras&#39; last\norder, to burn the Dinosaurs. Feel free to post yourself where you\nlike. See the end of the post for your cue.\n\nBIC:\n\nThe mighty dragon that is TUSCON moved swiftly over mountains, rivers\nand valleys, great forests pass beneath TUSCon and his passenger.\nTUSCON&#39;s powerful wings propel him through the open skies pausing only\nas thermals and updrafts allow him to soar giving him precious moments\nof rest as he continued his flight.\n\nHe has covered hundreds of miles in the space of a few hours and the\nsun has set, disappearing behind the ever distant horizon. Stars wink\nat TUSCON and RODIMUS pleasently like bright jewles on black velvet,\nthe moon like some giant baubel, glowing brightly.\n\n&quot;Will you look at that.&quot; RODIMUS said in awe as he pointed ahead of them.\n\nAs TUSCON arrives at where he would have thought their enemy to be he\nrealizes that it was not the scent of the stranger that he caught, but\nit was the strong aroma of dead flesh mixed with fire, smoke and\nburning meat. There is a great fire going on, one that seems to be\nraging for miles.\n\nIn the distance TUSCON can pick up the definite scent of Predacon\nenergy signatures, their dark forms darting over the fire looking\nalmost like moths over a bright flame. However these moths are firing\nblasts of energy at the fire keeping it bright and hot.\n\nEven as TUSCON was picking up the Predacons, they seemed to be\nbecoming aware of him as well as several of them fanned out\ndefensively.\n\n*****************************\n\nAt the same time HYDRAS also gets a message from FRACTYL, &quot;Sir. We are\npicking up a strange Maximal signature is approaching the area of the\nburning Dinosaurs. It is quite large and approaching quickly.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
