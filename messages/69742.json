He wasn&#39;t much for burning rubber need=\r\nlessly, and always took caution instead of wrecklesness when it came to his=\r\n driving habits.  Right down to signalling a right turn when it came time t=\r\no turn right, and keeping his speed at a reasonable clip.  When he feels th=\r\ne ground beneath his tires become rough, he shifts into manual gear to acti=\r\nvate his all wheel drive system, and is careful to take it easy through roc=\r\nky river beds.  Water splashes up over his cab, as does mud.  But it doesn&#39;=\r\nt bother him in the least.\n\n&quot; I wish I could say enjoy the ride, maybe one =\r\nof these days I can. According to my transmitter, we&#39;re quite a bit a way f=\r\nrom the Ark.. Estimated arrival time says about three hours...  I wish I co=\r\nuld get there sooner but if I go too fast, I&#39;ll kick up dust, and that&#39;s a =\r\ndead giveaway.  This way, if I stick to moist ground for most of the journe=\r\ny, and if I can help it, through grassy plains, I may be able to avoid bein=\r\ng seen.  So far I think sticking to water ways is best.  No dust, no prints=\r\n, no scent, no can track.&quot;\n\nHe continues to buffer his and Lord Elder&#39;s sig=\r\nnatures so is to appear that they are not even enroute to the Ark.   While =\r\nhe travels, he taps into the Ark&#39;s com link.\n\n&quot; Kup, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t ans=\r\nwer your question earlier, I&#39;d rather tell you in person to not risk any in=\r\nformation getting in the wrong hands.  The less info we put out in the open=\r\n the better. &quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gazoontite. Anyway, you can count on us Lord Elder. W=\r\ne promise, we&#39;ll watch our backs every step of the way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrid=\r\ne shakes his head after sneezing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; We won&#39;t do anything you wouldn=\r\n&#39;t do, Sir. We&#39;ll have to move fast though, Lord Perseus probably needs us =\r\nASAP.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap opens the hatch door while on Quickstride&#39;s back.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wish us luck guys. We&#39;re gonna need it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder nodded and smil=\r\ned at Rat Trap and Quickstride. &quot;I wish you\n&gt; success, may Primus help both=\r\n of you.&quot; he said as he watched them\n&gt; leave. &quot;May he watch over all of us.=\r\n&quot; he said under his breath as he\n&gt; turned back to Tuscon.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I think=\r\n we should leave the shuttle where it is and head toward the Ark on wheels.=\r\n We can cover more ground that way. Plus, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done=\r\n any form of off road driving and if we keep off the main roadways, no one =\r\nwill ever suspect that we&#39;ve gone back to the Ark instead of taking the bai=\r\nt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Elder looked at the shuttle thoughtfully, resting a hand on=\r\n it. &quot;Hmmm&quot;\n&gt; he said finally, &quot;That might not be a bad idea.&quot; He depressed=\r\n a few\n&gt; controls, trying to lock it down. Of course no lock is perfect.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; He looked back at Tuscon, who had transformed into his vehicular mode al=\r\nready.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He transforms into his SUV mode and opens his door to Lord El=\r\nder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;So who wants shotgun?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With one last look back at the sh=\r\nuttle Elder slid into the proffered\n&gt; door that Tuscon held open. &quot;Let&#39;s go=\r\n. We have a lot of things ahead\n&gt; of us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Don&#39;t forget, this is m=\r\nillions of years into Earth&#39;s past. Not\n&gt; only are there no roads, but ever=\r\nything is completely wild, and you\n&gt; get to contend with things like Dinosa=\r\nurs along the way! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
