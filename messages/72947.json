CYCLONUS and SCOURGE were missing=\r\n\n&gt; and HYDRAS had been taken, RODIMUS lost or at least seemingly so.\n&gt; Ther=\r\ne was still no sign of any of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of them knew most of the force=\r\ns at play, well at least the big\n&gt; three. The PREDACONS the MAXIMALS and th=\r\ne MINIONS OF UNICRON. However\n&gt; now there seemed to be another force at wor=\r\nk and that was this new\n&gt; enemy that they faced.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the PREDACO=\r\nNS, their clash with the MAXIMALS was, at least a known quality.  A third f=\r\naction operating in the area, with seemingly significant resources and a ba=\r\nse was an unkonwn one.  So that meant that the unkonwn quality had to be as=\r\nsessed and dealt with so that the skmirishes could get back to focusing on =\r\nthe true adversaries, the MAXIMALS.\n\nDINOBOT glanced over to CRYOTEK then a=\r\ns he heard the sounds coming from down the tunnel.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME s=\r\nmiled as it seemed that finally TUCON was geting the point.\n&gt; That is until=\r\n he started talking about cloning and the need for a\n&gt; scan, and then a loo=\r\nk of shock and even outrage was appearing on LEO\n&gt; PRIME&#39;s face. &quot;What you =\r\nthink that I was cloned? What, when?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As he talked there was a sudden =\r\ncommotion as the ground began to rumble . . .\n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; Needless to say =\r\nCRYOTEK and PREDACON FUZORS were quick to make their get away.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRI=\r\nME looked around alarm registering on his face. &quot;Let&#39;s go\n&gt; Maximals!&quot; He c=\r\nried out. &quot;Further into the tunnel!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This could all be a trap&quot; WING C=\r\nALIBER said as he dodge a rather\n&gt; large stone comming at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRI=\r\nME nodded as he also began running urging them forward, &quot;Yeah,\n&gt; but at thi=\r\ns point we have no choice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The MAXIMAL FUZORS began to run forward as=\r\n well. It was time to\n&gt; exercise the better part of valor and retreat.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The whole tunnel continued to rumble and shake dangerously!\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTh=\r\ne PREDACONS seemed to have the lead in things now, having taken the first m=\r\noments to race ahead into the tunenls as sounds of crumbling rock filled af=\r\nter them, trying to shove their way up to the front of the ongoing collapse=\r\n!\n\nWhat followed was almost like a clip of the Junkeon inspired Benny Hill =\r\nshow as they all fell over one another to get ahead!\n\n\n\n"}}
