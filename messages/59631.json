But this time, she wondered if the Matrix \nwas calling for her spark.  She was draggin her left leg behind her \nsince it was broken at the hip joint. In wolf mode, it made crawling \nunder the bushes harder.  She was leaking mech fluid from her side \nwounds and had been for some time. Her spark was functioning at only \n25%.  Her audio sencors were hearing only static. Her optics were \nblinking and could see only 5 feet infront of her.  Her sence of \nsmell was down to about 15%.  She was covered in rust from head to \ntail.  She didn&#39;t know how much longer she would last.  She finally \nstopped as she could smell bots near by. But since she was barely \nfuctioning, she couldn&#39;t tel if it was maximal or predacon.  She \ncould only hope it was predacon.  She crawled untill her head banged \ninto something. It was the side pannel of a base. She crawled along \nthe outside untill she reached what she thought was the front doors.  \nBeing too tired and worn out to knock, she banged her the side of her \nhead against the doors, &quot;Open up. I need help. Please, somebot help \nme.&quot;  She fell to her side and started to shake.  She hoped that \ndeath would be swift and painless. However, she was still awake and \nalive. &quot;Please, help me.&quot; her voice getting weaker. However, she \nwould wish death would take her when she found out it was the MAXIMAL \nbase she walked up to. \n\n\n"}}
