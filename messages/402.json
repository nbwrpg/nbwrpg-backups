There was much to know before he \ncould relax and start on his meal.*\n\n&quot; Computer, show record of the most current Predacon activity.&quot;\n\n* A computer screen in front of him came to life and soon became full of the \nmost current Predacon activities, mainly the events which had occurred \nwithin the last few solar-cycles.\nDinobot looked over the records carefully, wars could be won if one knew \ntheir enemies well.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
