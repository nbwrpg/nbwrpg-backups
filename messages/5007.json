She nodded at Tavatron�s comment. *\n\n� Yeah, that was pretty interesting. Last thing I expected too.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then dropped her arms to her side and simply walked in silence then, but then noticing that there was no sound at all beside the sound of her feet and Tavatron�s paws. Then simply dismissing a bad feeling that had began to develop and smiled again, maybe just her nerves getting used to having to prepare for a difficult event that never happened.\nShe sighed again as she continued towards the base, one thing was done now but she had a feeling that there was so much else to do as well.\nBut then the same feeling hit her like a charge to the chest, it was almost like a dark cloud that suddenly covered the sun. Then looking around her again she had a bad feeling about the bushes and such around her, something just didn�t feel right all of a sudden. This time not being able to be dismissed. *\n\n* IRIS: All of her sensors detected a massive fracture in the ship, her other systems already busy with repairing the remainder. With rather a bad temper (for a computer program) she scanned and came up with the signatures of Marine, Inferno and Rampage. Remembering the any and crab she almost snarled as her systems tensed and readied them selves, had they not learned their lesson when they first tried this stunt! But Marine was a stranger to her systems�a new student to teach just what it was like to deal with a system like her!\nIris readied the same internal guns in which she had used before but then activated another system and then another, three systems aimed towards the three invading Predacons.\nWith a gleeful feeling she lowered the internal auto guns towards the invaders and began to target and fire upon them, then noticing that the CR chambers were on fire but then raising the bases fire defenses in that room. A smoggy mist began to rise from the floor in the room containing the chambers, the fires flickering but then dying away into nothing but smoke. She then switching the vents air projections and reversing them as then causing them to become vacuums, sucking up the black smoke and leaving nothing more then a burnt smell.\nThen turning her attention back towards the threesome she then turned the internal guns towards them and began to fire�then activating the second defense system. Fist there was a loud sloshing sound before the fluids emptied from their storage tanks, Zero Friction Fluid then cruising down the hall towards the bridge and towards the invaders. This fluid would simply make it so that they could not move. Once the fluid hit they would be immobile, thus the guns could hit their targets easily. Then there were the third defenses, she had used the same thing when Megatron had broken into the ship and had gotten to the Autobots. She electrified the floors, walls and roof of the hall leading towards the bridge, the energy being of such a power that they would short circuit any Predacon system they came in touch with. But that was a benefit towards the Maximals, the energy only effected that of Predacons�making it so that the Maximals could move in on the electrified prey.\nIris knew that this was a bit much to deal with a few Predacons when the guns and shocks were enough but she did not want then to enter into the bridge�it could mean the downfall of the Maximals�for good! *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
