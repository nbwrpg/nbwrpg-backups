His\n&gt; posts, this one included, have lost all of their\n&gt; life and energy. He degenerates rapidly, and\n&gt; although he is not a bad RPer, like he once was, he\n&gt; feels that he is not up to par with alot of other\n&gt; people. He is clueless, he does not know what is\n&gt; going on with the RPG and does not know what to do\n&gt; with his characters. He feels he had a pretty good\n&gt; run, and at one point was almost on top. He had\n&gt; nearly the greatest number of all time characters in\n&gt; the RPG&#39;s history, and his characters actually,\n&gt; although through gan grape (Get it?), destroyed one\n&gt; of the Predacon bases. He has not always been easy\n&gt; to work with. He&#39;s complained, he&#39;s challenged\n&gt; things, he&#39;s argued with the highest of people,\n&gt; because he worked hard to protect what he had\n&gt; already established. But now, nobody misses the\n&gt; Hollywood Narrator&#39;s posts. Nobody is interested in\n&gt; trying to do storylines with the aging veteran.\n&gt; Before the character limit, he was promising. After\n&gt; the limit happened, he just seemed to float off into\n&gt; space, not able to have fun with his limited cast.\n&gt; Should the Hollywood Narrator leave? Maybe that\n&gt; should be for the RPG to decide. I am in a sad state\n&gt; with NBW right now...\n&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; New, New, New World Order! 4 life! 4 life!\n&gt; \n&gt; Watcha gonna do when HulkaMania runs wild on you!?\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
