Next he send a commands to his brothers  in order to\n&gt; stop Razorcraws and Ender.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kali typed some buttons and two wall slided in each side of the\n&gt; corritor where Silver Scout and Blaze were. Next the femme, pushed a\n&gt; button and a gas started to araise where Silverscout and Blaze were,\n&gt; that gas would made them sleep a large time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blaze and Silver Scout continued wandering back toward Shivahs\n&gt; location when Silver Scout picked up a scent. &quot;Foxfingers?&quot; the scent\n&gt; was strong, like he was close. &quot;Kit Kat and Drillbit were with him,\n&gt; he&#39;s in trouble.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tigress travelling with the wolf transformed to get a better\n&gt; whif of what the mutant was smelling. &quot;He&#39;s caught, there&#39;s nothing\n&gt; we can do.&quot; she had given up hope of escape. By now her computer\n&gt; access was probably cut off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We have to save him, I owe my creator that much.&quot; the wolf started\n&gt; off in the direction but was quickly stopped.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Then fine, you won&#39;t die alone.&quot; Even without her computer access\n&gt; she could still help, if she couldn&#39;t hack the computer then she\n&gt; wasn&#39;t worth the function her motherboard was printed on. &quot;I&#39;ll see\n&gt; what I can do.&quot; the tigress transformed back to her bot mode. The\n&gt; virus was taking effect eact time she transformed back she could feel\n&gt; it impedeing her transformation. Quickly accessing a computer\n&gt; terminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still\n&gt; trapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around here.&quot;\n&gt; soon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
