Inside, the pilot swears, \ntrying to stabolize the ship.\n\nHe had been following Killfest&#39;s pod, and it had recently fallen into \na transwarp portal. He had followed, but his ship couldn&#39;t stand the \nenergy strain and he was forced to leave the portal early.\n\n&quot;Slag,&quot; he swears, watching the planet rush up at him. He pushes a few \nbuttons. The ship was not functioning, there was only one option left.\n\n&quot;Edject!&quot;\n\nThe ship was well in the atmosphere, the sides of it burning up. The \ntop opens, making the ship much less air dinamic.\n\nThe Maximal&#39;s seat launches upwards, clearing the ship and leaving it \nto fall to the ground and explode. Hunter himself lands safely, about \na mile away from the Predac\n\n\n"}}
