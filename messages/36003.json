(I think\ngrabbing range would be considered point blank the effects of the blow is\nentirely up to you.)\n\n\nArtemis was ready to fight and fired 25 times against Arty\n\nArty suddenly fealt a series of shots striking him, his thick hide protected\nhim from the light artillery making it feel like nothing more than a\nnuisance.(Since Pacifix is so close he&#39;d be in the line of fire too.)\n\nSlags flames heated up the battlefield again causing the tunnel to feel like\na blast furnace. He tried to grab Pacifix and use him as a shield knowing\nthat the Triceratops would have to stop his attack if one of his side was\nbetween them.\n\n\nBranding used her good barrel to launch a wave of flames toward Swoop\ndetonating the missles. The room shook, if the battle continued the roof\nwould surely colapse and bury them all.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: rAuq &lt;rauq@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 5:14 PM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole...\n\n\n&gt; OOC: A-G was originally supposed to be Air-Ground but using\n&gt; them as concussion missiles will work just fine. =)\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Pacifix / Crossroads / Swoop ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Pacifix raises his arms to shield himself from Arty&#39;s blasts.
