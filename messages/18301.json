Cyber Claw walked \nbehind him at a distance. They weren&#39;t happy with each other; \nQuickstrike recived an attack from Cyber Claw when he accidentily \nreferred her to Dinobot. He didn&#39;t know that saying Cyber Claw wasn&#39;t \nDinobot was a mistake.\n\nQuickstrike had a dislocated shoulder from her and a scratch at his \nface. His shoulder really bothered him.\n\nCyber Claw was growling behind his back.\n\n\n"}}
