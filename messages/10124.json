I only \n&gt; managed to rap things up with all my chars. For Vulois, the shileds \n&gt; on the embassy are up and he&#39;s meditating. Please do not attack the \n&gt; embassy or bother him in any way. As for Brix and Fliq, since their \n&gt; with Ramulus, that Yanshosh could look after them. If there&#39;s a \n&gt; problem with that, please tell me. I might post once more tonight, \n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure, so if I don&#39;t, good-bye everyone.\n\n\n"}}
