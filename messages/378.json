The ark doors \nloomed in the distance.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s the base. It&#39;s not far now.&quot; Tavatron jumped down and did a quick \nscan of the area. Satisfied that there were no Preds around Tavatron began \nto walk towards the base.\n\n&quot;Why did you defect?&quot;\n\n(OOC: Tav has no knowledge of Dinobot prior to their first encounter. Just \nto make it a lil interesting!)\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
