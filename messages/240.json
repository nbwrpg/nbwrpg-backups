She activated her thrustors to slow her fall. She landed in a \ncrouched position. Pain was almost all over her body. But she didn&#39;t worry \nabout it too much. She had had more damage than this. Once the top side of \nher head was blown off. But she was able to get the repairs she needed. \nHere, she was alone.\n\nShe stumbled forwards, then turned to the giant beast struggling with the \nother raptor.\n\n&quot;He will never find me!&quot; she called to it, still thinking it was sent by \nMegatron to track her. &quot;Tell him he will never find me!&quot;\n\nShe bolted away from the two dinosaurs, and mumbled, &quot;Flight mode.&quot; Her huge \nbody lifted into the air, and accended to the forest. She flew over it, and \ndrived into the canopy in the distance.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
