He was =\r\nhappy to see his comrade back on the mend.  And now he was never going to a=\r\nllow anything else to happen to him.  He takes his words into consideration=\r\n with a nodd of compliance.\n\n&quot;Understood Rodimus.  I will not underestimate=\r\n Cyclonus by any means, but I will do my best to be sure that neither he or=\r\n Hydras lays another harmful hand on any of the Maximals or Autobots ever a=\r\ngain.  And this time, I&#39;m very happy to have the help.  I&#39;ll need it, I may=\r\n be a Prime, but I know even the best of warriors can do with having good c=\r\nomrades on his side.  Legacy, I will be grateful for anything you can do to=\r\n help Perceptor.  And if Perceptor is comfortable with the extensive repair=\r\ns, by all means, do try, but if it doesn&#39;t work, I will also understand.  W=\r\nhen I was last examined, I was also told that my damage may be far too exte=\r\nnsive to repair by normal means.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Stanton.\n\n&quot;Stanton, I h=\r\nave something for Nightlight.  I hope it will be enough to restore her.&quot;\n\nH=\r\ne opens his chest and reveals his pulsating orb, which pulsates twice and f=\r\norms a smaller version of itself.  The small orb of energy pulsates in time=\r\n with his own.  He presents it to Stanton.\n\n&quot; This is what helped me to bri=\r\nng Rodimus back.  It&#39;s a power that feeds off of compassion, hope, understa=\r\nnding, and kindness.   The power of unity, and a simple force that we all p=\r\nossess to a level of degree.  It&#39;s what drew Rat Trap to find me, and what =\r\ndrew me to Talon and all of you.  And now, I wish to extend this to Nightli=\r\nght, in hopes that the compassion we all share, will be enough to help her =\r\nthrough this difficult time.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles as her own heart spark =\r\nbeats within her chest.\n\n&quot; Love is definitely something our enemy doesn&#39;t h=\r\nave.  And there&#39;s no other force greater than that.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucso=\r\nn turns his ear to Perceptor after hearing what Legacy had to say. He smile=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I can see how you got your name. Highly perceptive of you. Tha=\r\nnk you Legacy, you&#39;ve shed a lot of light on many of my questions. Now that=\r\n I know my lineage, it&#39;s time I lived up to it. First things first, Percept=\r\nor and I could do with getting our sight back, and if you could do that I&#39;d=\r\n greatly appreciate it, Stanton. Next, we have insectoids hiding beneath th=\r\ne Black Fortress tunnels, which have to be shown a lesson about tampering w=\r\nith what is not theirs. And Hydras last of all, could use a lesson in that =\r\nas well. Nobody tampers with any Autobot and gets away with it. Especially =\r\nwhen they tamper with a Prime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy merely nodded, his s=\r\ningle optic pulsing slightly as he accepted\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s words.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We can =\r\nwork on getting your sight back Tuscon.&quot; Santon said, his tone\n&gt; grave and =\r\nserious, &quot;However I would need to run complete scans of\n&gt; Perceptor to know=\r\n if it is possible to do so. For some the damage can\n&gt; be so extensive that=\r\n it would require a complete cranial\n&gt; reconstruction to fix the problem.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; They cause=\r\nd great harm to you Rodimus, and I&#39;ll see to it, with your help, that they =\r\nget it back in return. If Optimus Prime could fend off Megatron, I&#39;m sure I=\r\n can follow in his footsteps, and fend off the enemy at hand. Both Hydras a=\r\nnd Cylconus need to be dealt with accordingly. Rodimus voiced an interest i=\r\nn dealing with Hydras and so do I. Two Primes against an evil leader is sur=\r\ne to topple even the most evil of warlords. But our war does not end with j=\r\nust us. If we&#39;re going to send those Decepticons and Predicons packing, we&#39;=\r\nll need every Autobot and Maximal we have in our ranks to pull this off. Lo=\r\nrd Elder, I&#39;d like you to contact Lord Perseus, and assemble a Maximal/ Aut=\r\nobot assembly. The more we get together, the stronger we&#39;ll be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was begining to look decidedly better as an intervenous tube\n=\r\n&gt; of energon continued to feed him energon in small but steady amounts.\n&gt; H=\r\ne clutched his hand and then flexed it, smiling as he did so. &quot;Yes,\n&gt; we ne=\r\ned to do some serious pest control.&quot; he said as he looked up at\n&gt; Tuscon.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Rodimus rubbed his chest with his hand, &quot;Don&#39;t forget Cyclonus, like\n&gt; =\r\nyou has been rebuilt by the forces of the Matrix, do not underestimate\n&gt; hi=\r\ns power.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;I did, and it cost us so very much.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodim=\r\nus clenched his fist again, &quot;But I am ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon sm=\r\niled and said &quot;Then I will need the help of LEgacy and Santon.\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&quot;=\r\nsaid the female &quot;I think that would bee good idea that you be there,\n&gt; &gt; if=\r\n your health allows you&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor did a malicious grin &quot;An excursi=\r\non to BlackFortress wont be\n&gt; &gt; necesary... cause the only copy of all my r=\r\neseachs and reprogramation files\n&gt; &gt; are with me.

With\n&gt; &gt; out my consent&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ns the others talked Bump came in with Nightlight on the suspensor\n&gt; bed, sh=\r\ne was still unconscious. A small deep beeping told anyone\n&gt; listening that =\r\nshe was in deep stassis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy stepped over to the rear section of th=\r\ne room, away from the\n&gt; others and gestured for Bump to bring her over as h=\r\ne began to examine\n&gt; her. &quot;From our initial scans, it would appear she is n=\r\nearly blank, no\n&gt; secondary modes or weapons, even her memory banks appear =\r\nto be only\n&gt; slightly formed.&quot; Legacy continued to scan, &quot;However I am dete=\r\ncting\n&gt; residual memory entries that have not been completely deleted. I do=\r\n\n&gt; not believe she cannot access them.&quot; He looked up at Tuscon, &quot;I can\n&gt; at=\r\ntempt to restore them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
