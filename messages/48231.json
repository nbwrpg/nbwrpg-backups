I was kinda wondering where \nyou were but this answers everything! East patrol has been struck, \nNightshade included, but not Rage. The computers at the base lost \nthem. Sunhawk stumbled on them and brought Nightshade to the maximal \nbase after she was struck... that&#39;s about it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;catmastero&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ooC: I&#39;ve been away for the last 4 days or so, and I&#39;m a little \n&gt; &gt;lost \n&gt; &gt; as do what happened to Scryed&#39;s pod and such. (I should really \ntell \n&gt; &gt; people when i&#39;m leaving for a few days... lol)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So you don&#39;t know what all is happening? Scryed&#39;s pod is being dug \nup \n&gt; and scanned (Post # 48221). An energon wave shut off all of the \n&gt; Predacon east partol exept Rage and Nightshade was captured by \n&gt; Sunhawk after being shut down and was brought back to the maximal \n&gt; base (Post you should reply to would be 48198, I think). The Vok \nhave \n&gt; landed in post 48217. And of course the tripreds are still trying to \n&gt; decide what ship to use. \n&gt; \n&gt; Your last post was 48043 so a calculate that where 180 posts between \n&gt; that post and the one you just made here.\n\n\n"}}
