We=\r\n must be getting close.&quot;\n\nShe now swings herself up onto his back, carefull=\r\ny minding his wings.  She proves to be a very light passenger as she rides =\r\ncontently on the Predacon&#39;s back.\n\n&quot;I never thought that I would ever make =\r\nfriends among enemies but, I think I just did.  Nobody has ta know anything=\r\n except for us.   What&#39;d ya say?  Friends?  I promise never ta tell Leo or =\r\nRodimus.  Tucson will understand but I don&#39;t think the other two will.&quot;\n\nSh=\r\ne couldn&#39;t exactly tell what was happening to her but whatever it was, cert=\r\nainly didn&#39;t bother her in the least.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constant=\r\nly busy. \n\nOn Aug 11, 2011, at 5:14 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@gmail=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; With deep breaths, Tucson cools down as nostr=\r\nils flair to allow faster\n&gt;&gt; cooling of his systems.
