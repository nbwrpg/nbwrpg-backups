He first opened a \ncomm to \n&gt; Sphink with the instructions to come back to the ark with some \ntools and \n&gt; supplies. Then he made another comm to Kit Kat. &quot;My leader the \nsituation at \n&gt; the ark has calmed down. They wish us to lend some tools or \nsupplies that we \n&gt; can spare. Destructor told me of a room which holds such things. Do \nI have \n&gt; your permission to proceed?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
