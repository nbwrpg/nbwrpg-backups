Missile launchers spin around to target Ares and Anubis, firing a \nsignature-seeking missile at each of them.\n\nAll four of the laser batteries aim upwards to fire at Sixshot as he flies \ninto the battle.\n\nThe autoguns aim at all the attackers, firing rapidly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster ducks under several shots from Ares, firing back at the Newcomer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex growls as a shot from Ares hits him. He was in pretty bad shape, but the \nMaximal warrior was used to this condition.\n\nHe looks up as Sixshot flies into the battle, firing at him with his \nheavy-fire rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;YEEHAA!! Anybody order fried Preds?&quot;\n\nThe hyper yell came from Firearm as the Maximal runs out of The Cybertronian \nFire, ready for action. The giant weapon that was instead of his left hand \nwas set to rapid fire mode, the heavy fire rifle in his other hand ready also.\n\nHe looks around, a bit disapointed. It looked like the Preds couldn&#39;t hold \nout long enough for him to fight fresh troops....\n\nHe takes aim, letting loose a barrage of fire at Anubis.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker growls as the Newcomers keep fighting.\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t you retreat like the rest of the Preds?&quot; he yells at Ares, firing \na missile at him, &quot;You&#39;ll save yourself alot of trouble!&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus ducks under a shot from Ares, jumping up to fire at the Newcomer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSmokescreen runs out of The Cybertronian Fire, fully repaired. He looks \naround at the attackers, taking out a charge and throwing it at Hades.\n\n"}}
