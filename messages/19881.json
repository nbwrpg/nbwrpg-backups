Slayer seemed to know this. Pride \nseemed to be the only reason this fight continued. Lunarpine refused \nto lose. He wasn&#39;t losing fluid nearly as fast as Slayer so he knew \nthat he could outlast the bot even if it caust Lunarpine his own \nlife. He wanted to save Shadow Wing but not if it cost the rest of \nthe maximals thier lives by giving the traitor the chance to live. If \nhe left Slayer&#39;s weapons alone Slayer would continue fighting and \nLunarpine would have the opportunity to finish him. He had a better \nidea though. he leapt forward again slashing both claws at Slayers \nshoulder cannons and biting for his neck. If he got a hold on him at \nclose range this battle would be as good as over with Lunarpine the \nvictor.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer continues to fly backwards, Lunarpine&#39;s slash leaving deep \n&gt; gashes in his chest.

It was time to put an end to this battle and to the traitor \n&gt; &gt; once and for all. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t let the fact that they once \n&gt; &gt; served together matter. At this moment only two things mattered \nto \n&gt; &gt; him. Winning or losing would be the difference between who stands \n&gt; &gt; tall and who crawls away licking thier wounds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC Thank you and have a nice day.\n\n\n"}}
