Triggerhappy tries to turn around, \nbut is\n&gt; hit by Chromedome&#39;s shots, and now he is badly damaged.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;And I thought Autobots were bad, these Maximals are like \ngiant\n&gt; bumblebees with an extralarge stinger!&quot; He said to himself.\n&gt; \n&gt;            Triggerhappy is starting to go down, his engines had \nbeen a\n&gt; little damaged as well.  Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have the logic to \nretreat, and\n&gt; so he turned around and began firing his photon blasters at Prowl.  \nThis\n&gt; Prowl was bugging him, Prowl was very fast, and had a sleek body.\n&gt; Triggerhappy would strike him down if it was the last thing he did \nin this\n&gt; battle.  Of course, Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have to fight alone.  He \nshouted\n&gt; down to Motormaster and the others, trying to make himself clear \nover his\n&gt; engines.  The ash started to get to him and his optics too.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey guys!  We gotta scrap these muthas!!!&quot; He yelled \ndown.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Orchestra ran after Blacknightmare.  He went to her side.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I last engaged in combat.  The \nlast time\n&gt; I ever saw the face of war was centuries ago, when I was along \nComposer&#39;s\n&gt; side, always trying to do my stealthy work, but also observing the \nbattles,&quot;\n&gt; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Orchestra slowly moved his arm towards Blacknightmare, \nslowly and\n&gt; silently attempting to put his arm around her waist.\n\n\n"}}
