You showed no sign of wanting to die on the battle \ntoday.  And believe me I&#39;m the one with nothing to lose, 2 dead \nPred&#39;s to gain, I saw the way you looked at Hot Rod (I think he was \nin the same room as both of them at one point so who can complain), \nif you live you still have your lover, I lost mine.  So you have far \nless reason to blast us all to bits then I have to let you. Besides \nI&#39;m pretty good at judging character, you are vain and self orented, \nwhile if you can judge my character I&#39;m willing to give my life to \nend your&#39;s.  So what&#39;s it going to be.  Oh and if your friend even \nthinks about firing again I assure you I can put this charge right in \nthe path of his lasers and blow us all to bits anyway.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He turned on his comm to Talos.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sunhawk:  TALOS, BOTH PREDS ARE LOOSE!  I&#39;M TRYING TO\n&gt; &gt; RESTRAIN THEM, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEND HOT ROD BACK\n&gt; &gt; HERE.  HE WAS SUPPOSE TO GUARD THE FEMALE SO THIS IS\n&gt; &gt; HIS MESS!  HE SHOULD HELP ME CLEAN IT UP!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Nightshade}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade didn&#39;t even bother to try and block the grab and \nsword\n&gt; placement, rather her hands came up attaching two magnetic and \nquickly\n&gt; blinking explosive charges to it&#39;s surface. &quot;Surrender, or I blow \nus all to\n&gt; space dust Sunhawk. You&#39;ll never disarm them before they both blow \na gaping\n&gt; hole in the middle of your ship.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning her head her eye looked back at Sunhawks, &quot;I&#39;ve nothing \nto\n&gt; lose...everything to gain. Stand down or I get the final victory. \nAnd you&#39;ll\n&gt; never get out of blast radius before they go off so don&#39;t even \nthink of\n&gt; throwing your sword away and running to &#39;leave us to our \ndoom&#39;...there&#39;s no\n&gt; escape unless you surrender.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
