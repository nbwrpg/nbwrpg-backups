He stomped forward and wrapped his tail gun&#39;s claw\n&gt; around his neck and pulled him close.\n&gt;     &quot;You will regreat ever wakeing up!&quot; Megatron hissed, letting a few\n&gt; spitlets hits his face. He squeezed harder, sinking the ridges of his claw\n&gt; deeper into Airbombers throat. With two glareing optics, he looked to\nKitkat\n&gt; to finish the intruder off.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Paralysis looked to his commander and apologised. &quot;Forgive me, Sir.\nShes\n&gt; in the bunker but said to call her on your comm. Is there anything else I\ncan\n&gt; do for you?&quot; He said to Quickstrike, saluting.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Tarantulas was puzzled over the strange writings of the aliens that\nwere\n&gt; scattered about, dead and rotting. The Triangle room was indeed the\n&gt; Operations Center of the bunker. It was complete with computers,\n&gt; Communications devices, and an odd kind of screen.\n&gt;     He tried another set of decodeing programs, but to no avail. The\nlanguage\n&gt; of the aliens was very complicated. It made the Vok&#39;s language look like a\n&gt; walk in the park. Fustrated he slammed down his claw on the table.\n&gt;     The spider hissed, &quot;OH! These aliens are very crafty! But I have\nanother\n&gt; card up my sleeve......&quot; He then reached for one of Hell Beast&#39;s disks.\nThe\n&gt; one that had told them where this place was might tell them something\nabout\n&gt; this language.\n&gt;     He put the disk in and the odd runes on the screen suddenly began to\n&gt; change into Predaconese. He could completely understand it now. Hell Beast\n&gt; must have decoded them.....\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, excellent. Now to find out what happened here, and why.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Aracnia pushed open one of the sealed doors, now open of course. The\nroom\n&gt; was warm, and dark. She changed her optics into Nightvision and entered.\n&gt;     In the center of the room was a large cylider like object. She guessed\nit\n&gt; was the powersource for something.....but what? As she got closer she saw\nthe\n&gt; control panel, but didnt understand a word on it.\n&gt;     She turned a left. This room was a mystery, but as soon as Tarantulas\n&gt; decoded the runes, she would unlock this mysterious puzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
