We\n&gt; have gone to radio silence with the security forces because we \ndon=\r\n&#39;t want to\n&gt; get them involved.  They are still fairly week since the last =\r\n\nattack.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Another problem facing us, is that we have filled our two ho=\r\nlding \ncells\n&gt; already.  Ordinarily this wouldn&#39;t be a problem because we w=\r\nould \njust use\n&gt; the police station, however that is not an option either d=\r\nue to the \nprevious\n&gt; attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think we can afford to take any=\r\n more prisoners, so we will \nhave to\n&gt; find some way to drive off this intr=\r\nuder, reason with it, or render \nit\n&gt; unconscious and take it somewhere far=\r\n away.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He hit a button and brought up a map of the port region of the=\r\n city.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What I propose is that we divide into three teams.  The first =\r\nteam \nwill be\n&gt; lead by myself.  I would like two of you with me.  We will =\r\ngo down \nand\n&gt; directly confront this bot.  The first team will have a set =\r\nof \ncapture gear\n&gt; in case things turn violent.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The second team will =\r\nbe our backup and will try to keep the bot \nfrom\n&gt; reaching the city.  Sinc=\r\ne there is only a single ramp up from the \nport into\n&gt; the rest of the city=\r\n, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem, however this \nteam&#39;s role\n&gt; is crucial.  The=\r\ny will also have a set of capture gear.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Finally, our third team will =\r\nbe assisting the troops here in case \nthe base\n&gt; comes under attack.  This =\r\nteam can consist of one or two people \nbecause they\n&gt; will have the trooper=\r\ns, Salveo, and Kenzo to back them up if the \nbase is\n&gt; breached.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The=\r\n base will remain in high-security lockdown the entire time.  \nThe main\n&gt; e=\r\nntrance will be fully armed and guarded.  The shields will remain \nup.\n&gt; Te=\r\nams one and two will leave though the lower entrance tunnel near \nthe\n&gt; hol=\r\nding cells.  After they leave, we&#39;ll close all the partition \nblast doors\n&gt;=\r\n to ensure that the base is well fortified.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Salveo will remain here =\r\nto direct the mission over the radio.  \nKenzo, you\n&gt; can choose to stay in =\r\nthe medical bay or defend the front enterance.\n&gt; Remember that it will be d=\r\nifficult to move around once the \npartitions are\n&gt; up.  Nightlight and Elit=\r\na;  I don&#39;t want Elita to get hurt, she \nshould\n&gt; remain somewhere safe.  N=\r\nightlight may make her own decision \nwhether she\n&gt; fights or not.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
