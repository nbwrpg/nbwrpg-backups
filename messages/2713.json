He let out a squeal, and bolted. He scrambled on his feet, nearly \nloosing his balance. Having over-grown feet weren&#39;t helping in dodging \nthings. The missiles went past him, one nearly hitting his back. They \nslammed into the wall, making a fair hole in the wall.\n\nQuickstrike winced, staring at the Predacons. &quot;Hey! No harm! Cut th&#39; \nfireworks, tin-horns!

We \n&gt;cannot\n&gt; &gt; allign ourselfs with a Predacon fraction that wants to see all of us \n&gt;dead.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron frowned. Mabey Hell Beast and Zardus didnt want to join the\n&gt; &gt; Newcomers, but Megatron did. They had a plan, a motive, and minions to \n&gt;get\n&gt; &gt; the job done. He only wished he had the kind of resources Set and Shuko\n&gt;had,\n&gt; &gt; then mabey he could have gotten rid of the Autobots originally. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron ::: Well, I belive that my fraction would be-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Marine ::: Your fraction consits of two other bots! Shredder and\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike! I dont think we&#39;ll need you three at all, traitors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron ::: I will not stand for this, I can here to help you...and\n&gt;it\n&gt; &gt; seems im getting the short end of the stick!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Enough! Megatron, ethier you join us, or surrender \n&gt;your\n&gt; &gt; command and minions over to us. We will not let you walk out of here a\n&gt; &gt; possible threat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Megatron sticks out his hand ::: I will join, yes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: He knew this was only temporary. He would have to contact Shuko or\n&gt;Set.\n&gt; &gt; He would see the downfall of the Predacons and Allience, from the \n&gt;inside.\n&gt;:::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::: Jackle and Pheniox combine fire towrds Mantella, hoping to stop\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike. :::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free @Backup service!
