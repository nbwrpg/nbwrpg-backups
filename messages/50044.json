The problem is that I don&#39;t know how to CONTROL\n&gt; it.  I&#39;ve got \n&gt; special energy regulators implanted that keep it in\n&gt; check, but that&#39;s \n&gt; it.  I&#39;m not sure where I got them - definitely not\n&gt; from the \n&gt; Sisters!&quot;  She laughs, then gets serious again.  &quot;Do\n&gt; you think \n&gt; Megatron will be nicer than the Rogues?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  You were a member of a group of femmes\n&gt; called the \n&gt; Sisters.  \n&gt; &gt; They believed in non-violence, and purity.  What\n&gt; they didn&#39;t know \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; you have a mutant spark.  If you ever used it in\n&gt; battle you&#39;d be \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; but unstopable.  Both myself and the Rouges\n&gt; detected your spark and \n&gt; &gt; came after it hoping to gain a new ally.  But when\n&gt; I got there I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; damaged in a storm.  The sisters took me in and\n&gt; treated me.  Even \n&gt; &gt; though I found out which one of you it was you\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t come with \n&gt; &gt; me.  I could have just forced you, but I was\n&gt; weeeelllll begining to \n&gt; &gt; like you a great deal, and despite the Sister\n&gt; teachings against it \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; believe you may have mirriored this.  When the\n&gt; Rouges arrived you \n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t defend yourselves, but I would.  I took\n&gt; out a few of them, \n&gt; &gt; but they finally got me.  They would have slagged\n&gt; me, but you \n&gt; &gt; surrendered youself at the last minute so they&#39;d\n&gt; leave me, and the \n&gt; &gt; Sisters alone.  That was the last I ever heard of\n&gt; you until I \n&gt; &gt; detected your spark recently and tracked you down.\n&gt;  I actually came \n&gt; &gt; here to help a Predicon I admire named Megatron. \n&gt; And I hope I can \n&gt; &gt; convince him to help you.  Perhaps I should\n&gt; introduce myself.  My \n&gt; &gt; name, is Flicker.  Now come on, we need to get\n&gt; back to my shuttle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He knows he shouldn&#39;t be out in robot mode on this\n&gt; planet for long, \n&gt; &gt; but he starts walking towards the base just to\n&gt; savor the walk with \n&gt; &gt; her, and to allow more time for questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
