He chuckles.\nThe \nfool was too powerhungry to be alowed controll. Zardus raises his \ncomm-link to his mouth.\n\n&quot;All alliance members,&quot; He says into it, sending the message to all \nthe alliance members, &quot;Wolfgang is a traitor. He is to be killed on \nsight. Anyone who rises to defend him is also a traitor.&quot;\n\nThat should take care of him, he thinks to himself. One more thing, \nthough..\n\n&quot;Computer, unit Wolfgang is no longer friendly. Fire on sight. Block \nout commands from any panel but my wrist controlls.&quot;\n\nHe smiles as he hears the alliance base&#39;s comp&#39;s acnoledgement and \nflies off toward base.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ and DevilDuer turn around, hearing the message. &quot;Whatever you did, \nWolfgang, it was a mistake.&quot; FZ says as the two open fire on Wolfgang.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA shadow passes over Zardus as he heads back to base. A raven lands\nin \nfront of him.\n\n&quot;Transform.&quot; The raven says and DeathStorm transforms into his robot \nmode.\n\nZardus blinks in surprise and pulls out his gun, leveling it at \nDeathStorm.\n\n&quot;Put down the gun. I wish to join you,&quot; DeathStorm says, &quot;I am ... \nProquest, a maximal traitor.&quot;\n\nZardus nods, noticing DeathStorm&#39;s pause before the name. &quot;Very well. \nFollow me back to the base,&quot; He says and flies off, DeathStorm \nfollowing\n\n\n"}}
