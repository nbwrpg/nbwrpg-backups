A nd how to bypass them.  It wonders what else he has stashed\n&gt; away, from the old day or the new one.  I would suggest we keep an optic\n&gt; upon him, but he would only do so if he allowed it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing, and walking along quietly wtih SKY SHADOW, lsitening to what the\n&gt; other mech said.  &quot;So, we shall have to scour the entire ship to see what\n&gt; little schemes he has.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a short nod as he and DINOBOT walked, &quot;I would suspect so.\nWe cannot know what other nasty surprises are here on this ship. He\nhelped with its repairs, but there is no telling how long he was here\nbefore we got here.&quot; He looked at DINOBOT, &quot;He might even have a few\nother things we haven&#39;t found yet.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To BLACKARACHNIA, CRYOTEK was no more a GENTLEMECH than the MEGATRON of old\n&gt; could be counted to keep his word.\n&gt;\n&gt; She kept up a winking vibe going at him, the first of the game to come.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAnd BLACKARACHNIA was right, CRYOTEK was as sneaky and as wicked as\nthey came. It was he that fostered the great MEGATRON and taught him\nmuch of what he knew,  the MEGATRON that had stolen the golden disk\nand fled to old Earth with it, the old MEGATRON who now existed, at\nleast in part, inside the form of HYDRAS.\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At thsi point, BLACKARACHNIA turned over to HYDRAS then and gave him a\n&gt; formal curtsy, her legs clacking up along her back like mandibles, &quot;Of\n&gt; course my Lord.  A pleasure to serve..  Under you again.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - DINOBOT/BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a nod over from BLACKARACHNIA as she turend, &quot;As you command,\n&gt; LORD.  ARe there any other sorts of traps within it we should e aware of to\n&gt; risk setting off?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing over at TARANTALUS with a half blink of confusion.  After all, the\n&gt; MEGATRON of old would have not remotely trusted TARANTALUS to take something\n&gt; &#39;delicate&#39; from his personal quarters no less, without a scheme in place.\n&gt; But this was NOT the Megatron she was used to now, was it?  This was HYDRAS.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, her nodding over at HYDRAS and CRYOTEK.\n&gt;\n&gt; WASPINATOR piped up, &quot;So, what going do with rest of Bug Bots.  ME not want\n&gt; go out and get blown up!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANTULUS stepped foward looking at HYDRAS a smile on his face.\n&quot;There are no traps.&quot; He said hoping to reassure, but as everyone\nknow, TARANTULUS was not the most trustworthy of soldiers, usually\nhaving his own agenda on things.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - DINOBOT/WASPINATOR&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; WASPINATOR continued, &quot;So, Ant Bot always still aft kizzer.  Wazzpinator\n&gt; stay herez, where not be blown upz!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINBOOT glanced to SKY SHADOW, &quot;I see that he has not changed.  And shall I\n&gt; be accompanying you for when the other..  Gift comes out of the repair bay?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKY SHADOW looked at DINOBOT a small smile on his face. &quot;Different\nship, Megatron has become Hydras, but the same forces seems to be at\nplay.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;well glentebots and lady&quot;said Hydras &quot;We must deliverate what will do next?\n&gt; Tucson Prime havent contact us and we muest be sure what to do&quot;\n\nCRYOTEK nodded to HYDRAS, &quot;Perhaps we should adjourn back to your\nmeeting room?&quot; He said as he held out a genteel hand to BLACHARACHNIA,\nhis clawed hand looking clean and manicured as he opened his fingers\nmuch like a gentlemech might before an esteemed lady. &quot;Will you do me\nthe honor of walking with me?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
