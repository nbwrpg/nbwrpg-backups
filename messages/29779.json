I&#39;ve got \n&#39;rassling with my friends to take care of and in a little while a sister from \nAlaska will be coming down here for a few weeks so I&#39;ll be occupied with that.\n\nSo I&#39;ll respond just a little less, though I&#39;m not going away or anything \nlike that.  In the meantime, I recalled the idea that people wanted to make a \npage with pictures and facts about their fellow RPers.  So I&#39;m going to make \na site for all that.\n\nSo anyone interested please copy and paste this with information into an \ne-mail.  If there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to leave out, go ahead:\n\n\nE-Mail Address:\n\nReal Name (Full):\n\nAge:\n\nWhere I Live:\n\nHobbies:\n\nWhy I Joined the Neo Beast Wars RPG:\n\nAnything Else:\n\nAnd if you want send a picture(s) or music.  In example, if you got a midi of \na song you&#39;d want send it to me.  But just midis, not wavs or anyt&#39;ing like \nthat.  Remember, I&#39;m just now making the site and I don&#39;t really have a good \nform for RPer info.\n\nSo send anything to KSLawDogg@..., including suggestions for any \ninformation about an RPer that should be in my little &#39;form&#39; above.\n\n\nThanks\n\n-Unitron\n\n"}}
