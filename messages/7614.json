She smiled and she tapped her leg softly to get his attention.*\n\n� Comfortable in there?�\n\n* She then looked back at Perndabot just in time to see his eyes slide \ndownward as he looked at her, her smile now a little bigger but then she \nsimply shakes her head.\nBrightBlade chuckled as she heard what he nearly said, knowing what word \nwould have come out of his mouth if he hadn�t caught himself in time. She \nwas actually flattered by what he was going to say.\nShe smiles at Perndabot as meets his eyes when they finally come back up to \nher face, almost to the point of letting him know that he had been caught. \nBut she didn�t mind, if he liked what he saw then he liked what he saw. She \nwasn�t about to give him Hell for looking at her like that, she was rather \ntaking it as a compliment that her body was worth looking at like that.\nBrightBlade then looks ahead, seeing a fairly large tree in which Perndabot \nwas heading straight for!*\n\n� Watch��\n\n* Perndabot had crashed right into the tree just before she could finish her \nsentence, a stump was all that was left.*\n\n��out.�\n\n* BrightBlade shook her head and chuckled, remembering just how many trees \nGangon had crashed into while he was complimenting her. Men. Did they always \nact that way around her?\nShe smiled as she then continued walking, passing Perndabot and continuing \ntowards the Cybertronien Fire.*\n\n� Actually, it IS fairly advanced. One always has to have such tools when \nthey�re in MY line of work.�\n\n* BrightBlade then stretched again and walked in the comfortable way, with \nher hands behind her head. She rested her head against her own hands while \nthey kept her head straight and looking forward, stretching her aching ribs \nin the process.\nIt was going to be a long day.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
