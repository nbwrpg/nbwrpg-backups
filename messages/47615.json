Laughable, for it&#39;s the other way around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Transformer&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came out as Roland, Code, or whatever new name has pointed out,\n&gt; 12\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before BW squirmed its way onto the scene.  Hell, BW was to\n&gt; cheap\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank Welker to do the original Megatron&#39;s voice for the thing\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the golden\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disk.  It&#39;s only good points were Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both having\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worked on He-Man which was a kick ass cartoon (Secret of the\n&gt; Sword\n&gt; &gt; &gt; baby,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Staying on subject, Transformers: The Movie was an awesome\n&gt; movie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say it was perfect, it was pretty cheesy how they slipped in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gay new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Autobots.  But that&#39;s what happens when it&#39;s governed by toy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sales.  Anyway,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tactic with the ship was smart and served its purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They were trying to get the Dinobots in there because they\n&gt; wanted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hell out of there, something about a new, fully-powered fleet of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decepticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fighters jumping on their tired afts.  And the Dinobots are\n&gt; stupid,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you expect?  Grimlock was a genius at one point in the third\n&gt; &gt; &gt; season, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s another subject for another time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why were they celebrating at the end?  How many stupid\n&gt; questions do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you have?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  They saved the planet from a giant MONSTER named Unicron that\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obliterate the planet and everything else in the Universe.  That\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worth being happy about, though it was stupid to say it was the\n&gt; end\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Third Cybertronian War, I&#39;ll give ya that.
