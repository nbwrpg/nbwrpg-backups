He listened to the incoming transmission and nodded \nhis head, liking what he heard.  He activated his comm. unit and opened a \ncomm. link with Zardus.  \n\n&quot;Zardus, this is your loyal servant Jaws.  I&#39;ve received a transmission from \na gladiatorial league and I wish to enter, but it would require me to abandon \nmy duties for it to end.  Is that alright?&quot; he asked, already changing his \ncourse from his regular post in the ocean back towards the Iron Fist.\n\n---\n\nThe Oblitercons had recovered from their wounds 100% and were headed for the \nbridge to talk with Zardus about a pay boost, when they all simultaneously \nreceived the IGL transmission.\n\n&quot;Five new robots, eh?&quot; Dark One asked with a sly smile.\n\n&quot;We could double our numbers, obviously.&quot; Hiss pointed out.  &quot;And no doubt \nwith five additional troops to our numbers we could demand much, much more \npayment from the Alliance for our fine services.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are we waiting for?  Let&#39;s go!&quot; Breakdown yelled. \n\n&quot;The two week waiting period you dunder head!&quot; Pyro yelled.  &quot;Wait.  What do \nwe do then?&quot;\n\n&quot;We train, you dolts!  Let&#39;s get to the IF&#39;s holographic chambers and get to \nit!&quot; Dark One yelled, all five of them walking briskly for the intended \ntarget.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer was on the bridge with Punch when the main view screen \ndisplayed the image of IGL President Kaiser and began playing his \ntransmission.\n\nNemesis Enforcer jumped backwards a good five feet and pointed at the screen \nwith terror in his eyes and voice.  &quot;Who the slag is that?!&quot;\n\nPunch shook his head at Nemesis&#39; theatrical like performance.  &quot;Listen to the \nmessage and find out...you idiot.&quot; the last two words being inaudible.\n\nNemesis went back to normal and took a seat.  &quot;Good idea.&quot;\n\n---\n\nScattershot looked around his room as Kaiser&#39;s transmission played.  &quot;Is that \nyou Primus?&quot; he asked, but then realized it was a transmission from someone \nelse.  \n\nHe waited until the transmission ended with a sadistic smile on his face.  \n&quot;Oh!  I&#39;ll need more armor!&quot; he yelled out with a delighted squeal, taking \nSerpentor&#39;s battered head and ran towards the CR chambers to go get it fixed.\n\n"}}
