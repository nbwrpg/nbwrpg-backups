(Starscream) He thought to himself. How he hated the robot who\n&gt;did worse than killed him and his dream. That treaturous fool ruined\n&gt;everything Megatron ever created. He held up his cannon and aimed it at\n&gt;the unready Skyscream. The melodic hum of atomic energy building up in\n&gt;the base of his cannon only pushed his anger. He grited his teeth hard,\n&gt;and matched the sudden outburst of energy from his cannon with a\n&gt;sadistic scream and he fired on Skyscream, the torrent of raw power\n&gt;matching Megatrons mood. &quot;Destruction to all traitors&quot; He yelled.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Motormaster looked at the Situation unfolding into chaos. He jumped back\n&gt;up to the top of the hill remembering the real reason they were here. He\n&gt;scanned the battle field for Shockwave (Kslawdogg, you will have to tell\n&gt;me what is going on with him).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Wildrider gracefully caught Symphony on his hood, and then used his\n&gt;anti-gravitational abilitys to soar from over the ocean to dry land, and\n&gt;roared towards the CF.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
