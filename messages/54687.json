He was heading to=\r\n Earth \nto \n&gt; &gt; visit some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find=\r\n when he got there, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; decided he would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable vehi=\r\ncle mode. He found one in the ships \n&gt; &gt; databanks. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian=\r\n tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           =\r\n  As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; truck, every \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into himself. \nHe \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; got up from his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons=\r\n, and went \nto \n&gt; &gt; prepare. As he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into h=\r\nimself he thought of all the \n&gt; &gt; people on this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was re=\r\nady.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             He touched his chest, the change to actua=\r\nl bot \nhad \n&gt; &gt; hurt his combined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spark.

He was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had plant=\r\ned on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s t=\r\nhrusters exploded, but the rest of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; ship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead,=\r\n it careened out of control and slammed into the \n&gt; ground, \n&gt; &gt; throwing P=\r\nrime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship \nstop=\r\nped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked him=\r\nself \nover. \n&gt; &gt; He was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks wer=\r\ne damaged. He walked back \nto \n&gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad=\r\n shape, his face had been ripped apart, and the \n&gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and =\r\n\ndented, \n&gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could =\r\nsee the shoulder \n&gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like som=\r\ne sort of \n&gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the f=\r\nuture. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but \nhe \n&gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communications b=\r\noxes on \nthese \n&gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible.
