He \nlaughed, he was now just a tad bit ahead of the Maximals.  He slowled down \nuntil he got to a slow enough velocity, and send all power into his engines.  \nHe turned, Windlord now coming into sight since he/she was maintaining her \nspeed and trying to get faster.\n\nHe fired off 25 rapid laser blasts at the moving form, and two \nenergy-signature seeking missiles at Windlord.\n\n---\n\nDark One knew what Sixshot was doing, it was a good tactical maneuver in his \nopinion.  He launched off two energy-signature seeking missiles at Warlord \nfrom behind.  He then fired ten rapid laser blasts from the laser weaponry in \nthe cone of his ship at Angel Prime.\n\n"}}
