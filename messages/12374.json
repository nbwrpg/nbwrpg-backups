I just need to know stuff. Just now, I found out \n&gt; that my e-mail adress has been hacked. Someone went in, and sent a \n&gt; message from me, to me. I was from minime_316, to minime_316. When \nI \n&gt; opened it, a virus came and now my screen is flooded with bright \n&gt; yellow ducks. This is no joke. If anyone knows anything about this, \n&gt; and remember I&#39;m not accusing you, please send me a private e-mail \nto \n&gt; mjs@c... Thank you\n\n\n"}}
