The main hatch barely opened due to a lack \nof energy, but being in the tropical climate seemed to be giving it more \nenergy.  Probably because of the plant parts of the mutated ship and \nphotosynthesis.\n\nFeral, who seemed to gather up more courage, walked down the ramp, trying not \nto step on the small plants that were growing out of it.  He seemed to feel a \nsensation tingle all over him as the rays of sunshine hit him.  Not warmth, \nbut at his best guess he was feeding on the nourishing rays of energy from \nthe ball of fire called the Sun.\n\n&quot;Verdant, come.  Let us explore.  I have an idea for your condition.  First \nwe must find a human, alive.&quot;\n\nA snarl came from the ship and the lumbering form of the beast that was \nVerdant came down the ramp, not caring what it was smashing.  A few grunts \nescaped what could be considered his mouth.\n\n&quot;Yes, Verdant, it may be hard.  I&#39;m not even sure if they came to this \ncontinent at this point of time.  If they didn&#39;t, we&#39;ll just go to the source \nand follow their path.&quot;\n\nThe strange looking duo continued their travels, entering a rainforest and \nfinding the constant chatter of the growth irritating.\n\n"}}
