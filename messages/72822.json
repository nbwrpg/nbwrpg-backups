And if\n&gt; we don&#39;t find it in time?  What then?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME, who was just reaching the cave entrance glanced back at\nSTRAIGHT SHOT, his voice low and serious, &quot;Then we are in a graver\ndanger than we know.&quot; He looked back at the cave as if seeing it a\ndifferent light. &quot;If whoever it is in there were able to corrupt the\nmatrix and even create a Dark Matrix . . . &quot; LEO paused signifigantly.\n\n&quot;Then they might prove to be a more powerful foe then we have ever\nfaced&quot; WING CALIBER finished the thought.\n\nBeside him SANTON nodded while BANTOR looked thoughtful and TORCA and\nNOCTORRO had dark looks.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; FOr the moment, BLACKARACHNIA was losing contact even at the bare\n&gt; ranges as the PREDACONS spread out.  Within what ordinarily would be\n&gt; visual range, here they seemed to be losing awareness of one another&#39;s\n&gt; existence.  Her scanners gathering increasingly less data and increasing\n&gt; interference even within (by Cybertronian standards) point blank range otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wherever BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s loyalties were, coerced or otherwise, there was\n&gt; enough of her left alone to parade with glee.  Assuming this realm stayed\n&gt; this way, cut off from everywhere else, she intended to in time work at\n&gt; establishing her own base here, cut away from all others.  Rubbing her\n&gt; mandibles together with glee at the contemplation, free for her own schemes.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt was not that she was loosing awareness of everyone, although it\nmight semm like that to some, but that the normal sensors that one\nwould uyse to detect IFF, radar, sonar and other such things that many\ntransformers depended on were being disrupted.\n\nThe five &#39;normal&#39; senses were so far undisturbed. She should see,\nhear, touch, smell, and, if she chose, taste to her normal levels -\nbut beyond that she was on her own.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; HOpefully DINOBOT would be able to get close enough to the surface for a\n&gt; quick comm burst to CRYOTEK which would explain waht they had encountered\n&gt; and what VICE GRIP was doing without going up aboveground, if CRYOTEK had\n&gt; not gone too far ahead.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Com-links were the first thing to go down since they entered the\njungle, he would have to get in voice range and just talk to him. It\nwas something that might prove easier than he thought.\n\nAs DINOBOT was approaching the opening in the surface he could easily\nmake out the MAXIMALS and PREDACON at the opening peering in. LEO\nPRIME and CRYOTEK were at the front with the others ranging out behind\nthem.\n\nLEO seemed about to say something when CRYOTEK spoke, &quot;What have you\nfound Dinobot?&quot; He made no mention of the others that he presumed were\nwith him like DRILLBIT and VICE GRIP, which at the moment none of the\nMAXIMALS had seen yet.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
