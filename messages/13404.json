She looked up at him and then stood up. She \nlowered her head out of respect. &quot;Thank you Commander Megatron.&quot;  She \nthen she looked at him.&quot;I shall bring you honor and glory \nCommander.&quot;  She turned and walked back tothe CR chambers hoping \nDrillbit was ok.  She saw Land mine crying and Drillbit trying to \ncomfort her.  She walked over and looked at Drillbit, &quot;What has \nhappened?  Why is Land Mine crying so?&quot;\n\n\nDarkMouse::\n\nShe looked at the Tarantula and shuddered.  She stayed close to \nQuickstrike as she walked down the tunnel.  She stepped on one of the \ndead aliens in the dark &quot;Squeek!&quot;  She jumped and stumbled.  This \nplace gave her the creeps.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looked at the fembot bowing before him. It was a \npathetic site \n&gt; for such a talented warrior, but she was loyal. &quot;Indeed, you have \nredeemed \n&gt; yourself Kitkat. Such headstrong tactics are just what Im looking \nfor! A \n&gt; career as Sub-Commander would do you well, yes.&quot;\n&gt;     He took his tail gun, and instead of hitting her with it, \nknighted her. \n&gt; It was a silly thing to do but the moment felt right.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tarantulas watched the two bots walk through the dark beneath \nhim. He \n&gt; knew Quickstrike, they had many a good time back in the old war. As \nfor the \n&gt; rodent, he didnt know. She must have gotten mixed up his clone. The \nbastard.\n&gt;     In his beast mode he slowly dropped, suspended from a cyberweb, \nand \n&gt; dangled in front of them. &quot;Aren&#39;t we punctual? Get into the \nTriangle room at \n&gt; the end of the hall. Aracnia needs you two.&quot; He said and dropped to \nthe floor.\n&gt;     He scurried forward, his eight optics shining forward like head \nbeams \n&gt; lighting the corridor scattered with the dead aliens.\n\n\n"}}
