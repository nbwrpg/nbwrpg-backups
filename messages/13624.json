With all my worry about HeraldAngel&#39;s true \npurpose, The Alliance&#39;s cruel beating and murder of Soundwave, and \nthe fact that the Predacons and Maximals have not responded to any of \nour calls yet, I am afraid of an attack on the embassy. We have \nalready had one, but I&#39;m thinking n the colossal scale, which none of \nus could survive. That&#39;s why I have decided to abandon the embassy. \nWe are going to move everything to my old mountain lair. We take all \nthe technology, and it&#39;s only a bit north from here. But it&#39;s inside \nthe mountain. The trail is trecherous, and it will be virtually \nimpossible to attack. We will leave the empty shell of the embassy \nfor any group that wants a base. Both of you, go and tell the Peace \nAngels of our move, and get your things together. Than we can start \ntaking apart the technology. We should leave by next week. When we \narrive their Child, you will be trained. I know you want it now, but \nwhat would be the point if we were killed before it was finished. And \nyou will still see your mother, not to worry. Now go! I will join you \nin a moment.\n\nVulois opened a comm to Battera and Cybershark.\n\n&quot;Battera, Cybershark, it&#39;s Vulois. Just to let you know that we&#39;re \nabandoning the embassy. We are going back to the mountain base. \nWhenever you are ready to come back, go there. Battera, you know the \npath from the old days, but becareful, it is still trecherous. And \nCyberhsark, since you have not been there, Comm us and we&#39;ll come get \nyou. Over and out!&quot;\n\nVulois went inside to start taking the main computer boarsd out.\n\n\n"}}
