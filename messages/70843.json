BOYAHH!  Hy=\r\ndras better watch his tail end noww.&quot;\n\nTucson gives Rodimus a firm handshak=\r\ne.\n\n&quot;Glad to have you aboard.  Kup, Windlord, you will be with Rodimus, bac=\r\nking up Night Shift, Cheetor and Rat Trap.  They have to access the fortres=\r\ns from remote points.  Windlord, if you like you can join him since you kno=\r\nw the fortress better than we do.  Perceptor, you too, have an excellent re=\r\ncall of Hydras&#39;s fortress.  Your intel will be most valuable on this missio=\r\nn.  Therefore, I&#39;d like to team you up with Night Shift, where you&#39;ll be sa=\r\nfe from harm, and assured a speedy getaway if things go awry.  And, it look=\r\ns like Straight Shot has chosen you Kup, to serve you as a weapon.  She wil=\r\nl not let you down, and her arrows are formidable.  It&#39;s not every day she =\r\ntrusts anyone beside me.  I know you&#39;ll wield her well.  You better take th=\r\nis too, Kup, my rerserve arrow holster.  As they get used, it creates more.=\r\n  You&#39;ll need them.  Arrows will serve you well, because unlike photon blas=\r\nters, they fly silent, and only until they hit their target, does anyone kn=\r\now about them.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot giggles.\n\n&quot;And ya never have ta worry about =\r\nrunning out of ammo or juice. Anyway, ready when you are.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right, Lord Elder&#39;s correct, I do ne=\r\ned a physical uplink in\n&gt; &gt; order ta do the dirty work. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shi=\r\nft nodds too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay, then physical infiltration it is. I could do w=\r\nith a little spy work\n&gt; &gt; myself, if I don&#39;t use my skills I&#39;ll lose my tou=\r\nch.

She has faith in you, and so do I. This may prove to be a challenging\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; mission but I know you are more than capable of doing it. So, as a fellow=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Prime, will you do me the honor of accepting her request?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at the others as they talked, his optics revealing very=\r\n\n&gt; little of the inner turmoil that was inside.
