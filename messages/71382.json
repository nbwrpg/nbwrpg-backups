Anyway, you&#39;re about ta=\r\n get grilled by Tucson or in for one of his lectures, depending on his mood=\r\n.  Good chance he&#39;s still in a sour mood.&quot;\n\nHe gets up and continues to esc=\r\nort Wheelie to Tucson&#39;s quarters.  They come to a waiting area teaming with=\r\n many masterfully restored Cybertronian artafacts personally restored by Tu=\r\ncson himself.  One such piece, an ancient cross bow lies displayed within a=\r\n glass case.  The lighting in the room reflects off the weapon&#39;s frame.  Up=\r\nroar stops to admire it.\n\n&quot; Wow....  I&#39;ve never seen this before, look at i=\r\nt, Tucson actually restored this a long time ago.  And over to the left, an=\r\n ancient Cybertronian time piece.&quot;\n\nHe then points to other artifacts in th=\r\ne room.\n\n&quot; He restored all these things.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like the=\r\nse.  It&#39;s like a window into the past.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and consta=\r\nntly busy. \n"}}
