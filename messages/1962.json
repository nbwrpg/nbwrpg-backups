He shrugs. If he did, he could always apologise \nlater.\n\nSuddenly, Prowl&#39;s thoughts are interupted by a sharp and severe pain in his \nright shoulder. Zenyak growls and stabs his dagger again near the first hole \nhis dagger had made.\n\nSwearing under his breath, Prowl throws Zenyak into a tree. The predacon hits \nthe tree and falls to the ground, unconscious again.\n\nProwl growls and reaches behind him to pull Zenyak&#39;s dagger out of his \nshoulder. Mechfluid flows freely from the wound. Putting the dagger away in a \nstorage compartment, Prowl turns to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;I think I should fly him back to base so he doesn&#39;t try anything else. Think \nyou can keep up?&quot;\n\n"}}
