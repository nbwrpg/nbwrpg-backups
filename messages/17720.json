He \nlooks around, seeing SnowCat collapse. The missile attacks had \nstopped, but that didn&#39;t mean Slayer had left, more likely that he\nhad \nrun out of ammo.\n\nRamulus walks over to SnowCat, about to kneel by her to check her \nwounds when a bolt of energy hit him, sending him to the ground. \nSlayer&#39;s laugh sounds as Ramulus feels something hit him in the ribs.\n\nThe Maximal jumps up. &quot;Striker, get a hold of yourself!&quot; he yells, \ndodging another bolt and firing hit anti-chip weapon atwhere the beam \nhad come from. The chip that shot dissapeared as it came into contact \nwith Slayer.\n\n&quot;For the last time, Maximal,&quot; Slayer&#39;s voice says, a rocket exploding \nat Ramulus&#39; feet, sending him flying backwards. The Maximal lands on \nhis feet, listening to the rest of Slayer&#39;s statement, &quot;I am not \nStriker. My name is Slayer.&quot;\n\nSomething hard hits Ramulus in the face, the Maximal stumbling \nbackwards into a tree. Slayer lands and walks toward Ramulus, his \nrocket launchers spinning around to aim and fire at SnowCat.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; SnowCat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was hit by another missle.  As the dust cleared, she layed \nthere. \n&gt; She groaned and slowly got up.  Her side had a hole blown through \n&gt; it.  You could see right through her.  She stood onher wobbly legs \n&gt; and looked at Striker as he flew off. &quot;COWARD!&quot; She then looked at \n&gt; the other bots.  She took a step forward and collapsed.  She was \n&gt; having trouble breathing and gasping for breath. Sparks flew out \nfrom \n&gt; the wires that were showing.  She coughed and moved her front pa\n\n\n"}}
