Zardus flips a switch, his other \nself sitting up.\n\nFZ&#39;s mind was now tied half into the Iron Fist and half into Zardus \nthrough his wrist comp. The Iron Fist could controll him by itself, \nbut so could Zardus when neccessary.\n\nThe exact copy stands up, Zardus making it walk over to a chair and \nsit down, waiting for Squizzy to exit the CR tank.\n\n&quot;We should get working on it as soon as possible,&quot; Zardus says, \nwalking out of the room.\n\nHe opens his comm to all Alliance members, &quot;Anyone who&#39;s not busy, \nplease begin digging around the Alliance base and under it. We will \nlower it slowly into the ground, for defencive purpouses.&quot;\n\nThe Alliance leader exits the Iron Fist, work drones exiting behind \nhim to begin digging.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, underground.&quot; he replied into his comlink.  &quot;Much safer than \nplacing \n&gt; the generators underwater.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
