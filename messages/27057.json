Now, the situation on the planet is soon \ngoing to possibly heat up incredibly, and I want the Maximals to be \nready to fight alongside us if needed.&quot;\n\nA small smile crept onto his lips. Manipulating factions to do things \nwas an artform. &quot;Do you think you can go to the Maximals and try to \nestablish good relations with them? It will be possibly dangerous, and \nyou&#39;ll have the Iron Fist&#39;s fastest craft with you in case you need to \nescape.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Gotron hurries to Zardus&#39; position, bowing before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotron: Yes, Lord Zardus, what do you want me\n\n\n"}}
