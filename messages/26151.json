She \nfrowned, wondering what was wrong with this bot. Perhaps his circuits \nwere damaged in the crash? That happened to some bots sometimes. It \nwas kinda reasonable. His craft had take quite a smash when it \ncrashed.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t know if you&#39;re allright?&quot; She asks him, misunderstanding \nhis words. The language he was using was very undeveloped, but his \nnext words cleared up the misunderstanding.\n\n&quot;Oh! You don&#39;t know where you are!&quot; She smiled, stepping up to him, \n&quot;Well, you&#39;re on past earth. You kinda picked a bad time for a \nvacation. There&#39;s a war going on here.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx, love.\n&gt; \n&gt; * D kept up sniffing, staying in a tight ball.\n&gt; This was a strange place and he was all questions but not knowing if \nhe knew \n&gt; enough words to express it.\n&gt; The people here were all coverd in some smooth coating, hard to the \ntouch. \n&gt; Not like the skin of his keepers. It was soft and pale peach. These \npeople&#39;s \n&gt; skin was all colors.\n&gt; D had never seen a sky before, or an ocean or anything that would \nexist on a \n&gt; planet. But that&#39;s what happened when a being was born and raised on \na \n&gt; startship all of their life.\n&gt; His nose smelled things that were both pleasent and foul, it \ntraveling less \n&gt; then an inch off the ground as it went along.\n&gt; D flinched as Fenox(sp) touched his shoulder, his head snapping \ntowards her, \n&gt; his ears still flat against his head. The hair along his neck had \nstoiod up \n&gt; for a moment or two but settled down, just surprised.\n&gt; She was the first person he had seen and felt a slight tie to her, \nlike some \n&gt; life line to hold onto while drowning in the events of a strange \nworld.\n&gt; D shifted on his fromt limbs, his hands/paws shifting the dirt \nslightly. He \n&gt; looked at the ground and then back at her, then did it again. \nSearching for \n&gt; something of his limited speech to say that might communicate his \n&gt; puzzlement.\n&gt; He wanted to learn as much as he could about this place, as well as \nfinding \n&gt; out just what had happened to the ship and people he was with less \nthen a \n&gt; day ago.\n&gt; D whined. What words to use?*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No know.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * That wasn&#39;t the answer to Fenox&#39;s question. He was saying that he \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; know where he was, so he wanted someone to tell him. But with words \nlike \n&gt; that people could have a hard time trying to understand him.\n&gt; But...maybe he could go at it another way? With more understandable \nwords.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No know where is.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * That was as close to, &quot; I don&#39;t know where I am,&quot; as he was going \nto get. \n&gt; But he just hoped that she could understand.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmai\n\n\n"}}
