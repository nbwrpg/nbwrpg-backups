He lands and transforms facing\nMegatron.  His chest opens, and a canon comes out.\n\nOwlhawk:  THIS Megatron is the Vok Destroyer.  Once\nyou get hit by it you will be infected  with a\nvirtually incurable virus causing your spark to slowly\nbreak down over several months as you experience\nincreasingly common spasms of pain.\n\nHe doesn&#39;t move or show any sign he&#39;s in pain from his\nwing as he says this, although the sparks comming from\nhis wing make it very clear.  He fires the Vok\nDestroyer at Megatron.\n\nOOC: Hey rAuq do me a favor and start a poll to see if\n&quot;I am your angel of death&quot; would have been a better\nintruduction, although Megatron as I recall had a\ntendancy to talk during battle, so he wouldn&#39;t shoot\nuntil the speach was over anyway (unless you intend to\nchange him) regardless of how long it took.\n\n\n--- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ooC: Ahhh!

That was a brillian\n&gt; backstab.&quot; He \n&gt; winces as his checks the damage to his left arm.\n&gt; Still functional.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In that case, I&#39;d be flattered to play with him.&quot;\n&gt; Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; weapons phase out of subspace and the target\n&gt; Owlhawk.
