Dewboy, when did rhesus land? when did he get here? \nwhy is he here? Why has noone traded with him but Mustex? Why is he \nso well known yet noone speaks of him? How did Mustex get on the \nisland? Why are you insulting yan? Is it because he cares about \nmaking the RPG fair? Is it because you cant mode like people do in \nDBZ? Is it because he said you cant control a bases shields or \nanother persons chars? Is it his, Rauqs, Megans, and Allorans fault \nthat they made that rule and must now change it so you can be happy? \nPlease answer these questions for me privately. my email is \nlegendaryNemasis@....\n\nBIC:\n\nThe bamphomet sim thing smirks and soon after wards dissapears as \neverything including blacknightmare breaks up into blocks before all \nis dark once again. Inside the second base, a hatch opens and the pod \nwith blacknightmare rises out. Inside of it various devices are \nimplanted into her body to make sure she returns.(This has been \napprobed by airly in private mail). A second later the pod rockets up \nand out of the ocean heading to the Oteybis.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; O.k your majesty did it work.

Tankor and Kyle, stop \nit, \n&gt; now. Kyle, please explain how Mustex got beyond Alliance shields. \nThe \n&gt; only post from you dealing with how he got there was filled with \n&gt; extreme moding, and I didn&#39;t see another one. Mustex can&#39;t \nmagically \n&gt; teleport, so I can&#39;t see a logical way that he would be walking \n&gt; around Alliance Island.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And everyone who&#39;s been disrespectful to other RPGers, please \nstop. \n&gt; I&#39;ve deleted all the polls I think are offending, like the &quot;Who&#39;s \nthe \n&gt; worse RPGer&quot; one.

I&#39;ll contact him. My \ntroops \n&gt; will get themselves to the IGL, but thanks for the offer.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He watches Daemos fly off, making a mental note to send a \n&gt; transmission to this new commander as soon as he was done with \n&gt; Chaostaur.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; FZ looks over Najah. &quot;Very good, Najah. The IGL is starting very \n&gt; soon. You can take a shuttle if you wish.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
