If she wishes to talk, then we shall talk.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She made the detour to the bridge and looked at the console.  It was \n&gt; similar to waht she had used in the past.  She pushed a few buttons \n&gt; and brought up the commlink onto the console speaker. &quot;Alright, where \n&gt; and when does Black Aracnia wish to hold this talk?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sorry I have been outta town and havent really had time to \n&gt; post...and of \n&gt; &gt; course I lost all the things I wanted, like Trinity, and Darkmouse.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Hell Beast cursed. The kitten was gone.....just like that. His \n&gt; mission \n&gt; &gt; was a joke, how was he supposed to do this, with one person. The \n&gt; senate \n&gt; &gt; member who sent him here did it to get rid of him. This was a \n&gt; punishment, not \n&gt; &gt; a privilage.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Gremlin.....we have left Black Aracnia. She is a fool. Now, we \n&gt; are going \n&gt; &gt; to find Megatron and help him. The Predacon Council will pay for \n&gt; sending me \n&gt; &gt; here.....everyone will pay!&quot; He said with bitter hatred in his old \n&gt; gruff \n&gt; &gt; voice.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Where are we going to find Megatron?&quot; Gremlin said, a loyal \n&gt; yes-man who \n&gt; &gt; would follow his leader into the Inferno. &quot;And what makes you think \n&gt; he wont \n&gt; &gt; kill us?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     The only place he could be would be in Ominous Primes lair. \n&gt; There are no \n&gt; &gt; toher bases, old or new, he could be in. And Megatron isnt an \n&gt; outdoor bot, he \n&gt; &gt; cant rough it. He needs a luxury suite. Now, lets go.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     And with that, Hell BEast and Gremlin set out towrds the great \n&gt; north \n&gt; &gt; artic region.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Aaracnia shighed. She wanted to join the Predacons together but \n&gt; it wasnt \n&gt; &gt; working out. It was to much for one bot to do....it was time to get \n&gt; friends. \n&gt; &gt; She was going to call Kitkat. If she would let her group join, they \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; make one big Predacon group, and then others would join, and if \n&gt; they didnt \n&gt; &gt; join they would be conqured and forced to join.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Paralysis, get Kitkat on the comm, I want to talk to her.&quot; She \n&gt; said, and \n&gt; &gt; then turned to see Quickstrike and Cyber Claw enter the \n&gt; bridge. &quot;And what do \n&gt; &gt; we owe the pleasure of this visit?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Paralysis called Kitkat, or her base at least. &quot;This is \n&gt; Paralysis, of the \n&gt; &gt; Predacons under Black Aracnia. She wishes to speak to you, its very \n&gt; &gt; important.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
