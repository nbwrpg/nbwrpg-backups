He lowered his shoulder \nblasters and folded them back into his shoulder compartment. Though \nhe appeared to have disarmed himself, DeathSteel was no fool. He had \nhis optic lazars still focused on the bot&#39;s head, just in case. He \nchose a more charismatic approach in trying to induct the bot into \nhis new pack of predacons. &quot; You are a very brave bot Darkangel. I \nlike that in a warrior bot. Yess, you have the prestige of a \nleader.  I can see this about you. Perhaps we can make arrangements \nthen. I am DeathSteel. Leader of the Predacons. And I can use a \ngreat bot like you. The rewards will be great if you join me.&quot;  He \nstretched out his dragon wings though in bot mode and then refolded \nthem behind his back. &quot;Hmmm, yess, you will rule over many and be \nfeared. I can use you if you so chose. Are you up to the challange \nof being great? Or would you rather squander your talents elsewhere?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Darkangel : :\n&gt; Darkangel comes down in front of DeathSteel, transforming.\n&gt; Darkangel: I am Darkangel of the Tripredacus.
