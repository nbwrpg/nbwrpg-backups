Nemesis put the spark in the field, going to beast \nmode and leaving the room, to let intern TO ME!&quot;al repairs take care of his \nlight wounds.\n\n---\n\nScatershot chuckled, taking out his sword.  He sliced off DeathStorm&#39;s body&#39;s \nhead.  Cutting the neck open, he put DeathStrorm&#39;s head on like a hat, which \nwas a snug fit.  &quot;Yeess...I have his powers now!&quot; Scattershot chuckled madly, \nrunning for his quarters wearing his new hat.\n\n"}}
