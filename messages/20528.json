Deemos might have kinda \ndefeated the Predacons a while ago, but back then they were in little \ngroups. Now there is one big Pred faction, or at least lots that are \nallied. They&#39;re a fair match for the Alliance, and they could \nprobably defeat the Maximals with very little trouble.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Okay, I&#39;m going to be completely honest here, this new group could \nonly\n&gt; combat the Alliance, because the Predacons are LAZY, basically, they\n&gt; actually just sit around and do nothing, seeing as how Deemos and \nhis group\n&gt; easily beat the Predacons and destroyed their base before, even if \nit was a\n&gt; different faction of Predacons, sorry Unitron but you only said \nthat the\n&gt; Predacons were taking over because you basically own them, but the \nMaximals\n&gt; are way more dominant than the Preds right now, so I don&#39;t know \nwhere you\n&gt; are getting at by saying that the Preds are dominating, just my \nlovely\n&gt; opinion...\n\n\n"}}
