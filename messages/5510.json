Maybe she didn&#39;t like him. Maybe she did, and didn&#39;t want\n&gt; to show it. Quickstrike was dumbfounded about it. He went on about himself\n&gt; and captured a last fish. He went back to the shore and ate both of them.\n&gt; Afterwards he transformed to his robot mode and jogged back to the\nPredacon\n&gt; cave. He knew she would be there. He thought of asking what went wrong. He\n&gt; ought to, maybe it was something unconscious he did, and he would remind\n&gt; himself never to do it again.\n&gt;\n&gt; He had forgotten about his fatigueness, and at the entrance of the cave,\nhis\n&gt; legs went out on him. His feet spat sparks after he fell.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Conference Calling with Firetalk!\n&gt; Click Here!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5480/13/_/_/_/962509171/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
