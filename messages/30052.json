She had the DNA collector on \nher side, just in case.  She spotted three animals and transformed into \nleopard mode.  She ran and caught two of them.  Grabbing the DNA collector, \nshe retrieved the samples as ordered and went back to her bike. &quot;Hmmm, I \nwonder what the commander had in store for these samples. I will have to \nfind out when I return. I wonder what advantages I will descover when I \nreturn.&quot; she said purring to herself.  She continued on her way to the \nIronFist.\n\n\n-Original Message------------\n&gt;::Zardus::\n&gt;\n&gt;Zardus nods. &quot;Allright. I&#39;ll have samples for you shortly. Follow me\n&gt;to the lab.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Zardus walks out of the conference room, waiting for Lady Hawk to\n&gt;follow. His internal computer silently sends a transmission to\n&gt;Feline: &quot;Feline, new orders. Get a fast vehicle and search the planet\n&gt;for as many DNA samples as you can find. If you meet anyone, return\n&gt;to base immediately.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
