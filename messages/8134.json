A little ways into the complex \nhe heard Magmatron calling to him again, he was getting stronger in his \ncalls. CyberShark would have to try and keep up, but each call was more \npowerful than the last, it was getting hard to resist. Maybe Battera would \nhelp.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Wolveritron::\n\n    He finally came across the Maximal base, after tireless hours of walking, \nand some short busts of flight. (Minimal flight power, just enough for really \nbig jumps) He had crossed something that would later be called the Grand \nCanyon, but now it was mearly a river.\n    He hid in the bushes around the Maximals base, watching waiting. He \nwanted to see what kinds of animals there were in the Maximal base...\n\n"}}
