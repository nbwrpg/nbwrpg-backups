He scratches behind an ear as if puzzled=\r\n by what to do next.\n\n&quot; Hmm... He&#39;s not re energizing as fast as I&#39;d hoped =\r\nhe would... I must&#39;ve missed something Lord Elder, but I&#39;ll be slagged if I=\r\n know what it is.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks at Tucson&#39;s gauge.\n\n&quot; Well, he&#39;s at fort=\r\ny two percent now, on his regular supply of energy and he&#39;s gettn&#39; a consta=\r\nnt flow of energon with the energon power port.  But unless we get &#39;em inta=\r\n robot mode, it&#39;s gonna take a lot longer ta get it in &#39;em while he&#39;s in th=\r\nis form.&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot; I - promise Lord Elder.  Not one thing - will b=\r\ne touched in the ark.  In honor of those I serve, I will - not upset any ba=\r\nlance that still remains in place.&quot;  \n\nRat Trap taps on Tucson&#39;s hood.\n\n&quot;Wh=\r\neels, sorry ta bother ya but, think you can transform for us?  The energon =\r\nport will be able ta reach your system a lot faster if we can put a direct =\r\nline inta one of your arm or leg ports, for proper circulation.&quot;\n\nTucson is=\r\n released from the saftey harness put on by Quickstride, as he and Rat Trap=\r\n stand back to give him room to transform.  Slowly the Autobot manages to g=\r\net into robot mode, and the port locations are switched to an arm port on h=\r\nis right forearm.  He points to it.\n\n&quot;Thanks Wheels.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.  He=\r\n was growing fond of his new nick name.\n\n&quot;Wheels. I could get used to that.=\r\n  As a matter of fact, when I&#39;m in vehicle form, that&#39;s what brings up my c=\r\nhasse off the ground quite a bit.  I could&#39;ve chosen that name, would&#39;ve fi=\r\nt me.&quot;\n\nRat Trap now looks at him with an honest face.\n\n&quot;Actually, there is=\r\n a name that fits ya better.  What&#39;dya think about TUCSON PRIME?&quot;\n\nQuickstr=\r\nide gives Rat Trap a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; Works for me, what&#39;dya think Lord Elder?=\r\n&quot;\n\nAs they discussed what name fit him best, Tucson is taken aback by the n=\r\name Rat Trap blirts out.  He thinks to himself.\n\n&quot;Tucson Prime...  That&#39;s v=\r\nery nice of them to think of me that way, but I don&#39;t think I could ever fi=\r\nt in the boots of a Prime.  What Prime leads a group of Autobots when he hi=\r\nmself can not see two inches in front of his face?   Optimus if you&#39;re watc=\r\nhing over me, I could really use your insight right about now.  Well, anywa=\r\ny, I suppose that&#39;ll have to wait until I reach the Ark.  I sure hope you c=\r\nan spare some time to talk because I really need to talk to you.&quot;\n\nRat Trap=\r\n sees Tucson&#39;s expression.\n\n&quot;Wheels? What&#39;s wrong?  Ya look kinda worried.&quot;=\r\n\n\nTucson couldn&#39;t hide it, he did not know which road to take and even thou=\r\ngh he was strong, he felt absolutely helpless spiritually.  Without Optimus=\r\n Prime to talk to, he did not know where to turn for help.  Yet, Lord Elder=\r\n and the other Maximals proved to be the greatest of friends to him, and he=\r\n felt he could open up to them.  He sits up against the wall of the ship, a=\r\nnd puts a hand on Rat Trap and Quickstride&#39;s shoulders.\n\n&quot; Ever go down a r=\r\noad, not knowing where it leads, and finding yourself more lost than ever? =\r\n That&#39;s where I feel I am right now.  Somewhere I took a wrong turn, and I =\r\ndon&#39;t know my way back.&quot;\n\nRat Trap adjusts the feed of energon into Tucson&#39;=\r\ns arm port.\n\n&quot; I sure know that one Wheels.  Primus knows we&#39;ve all been th=\r\nere in some point in our lives.  But I got a feeln&#39; that I don&#39;t normally g=\r\net..  I ain&#39;t usually too optimistic but there&#39;s a tiny little feeling of o=\r\nptimism startn&#39; ta build in me.  Don&#39;t usually get this warm&#39;n fuzzy but it=\r\n&#39;s there.  And it started when I first saw ya in that fortress.  I think yo=\r\nu got lucky for a reason Wheels, you got lucky because it was fate.  Yep th=\r\nat&#39;s what it was, fate.  And from what I kinda know about Roddimus... &quot;Grim=\r\ne&quot;...  He wasn&#39;t too ready ta take on the responsibility of ben&#39; a Prime of=\r\nficer, it just somehow happened.  But you, on the other hand, you got what =\r\nit takes. I think you might just be a lost Prime, if ya ask me.&quot;\n\nTucson hi=\r\nccups for a moment.\n\n&quot;Well, I dunno..  It&#39;s a very nice thought but, me?  A=\r\n Prime?  I&#39;m not so sure...&quot;\n\nRat Trap smirks.\n\n&quot;Hmph, let&#39;s see what Lord =\r\nElder thinks.  Sir, what&#39;dya think?  Could Wheels be the next Autobot leade=\r\nr?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Hope you don&#39;t mind I changed the subject/thread)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucs=\r\non backs up and tries to face Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I owe Lord Elder my utm=\r\nost gratitude. If - you had not guarded the - Ark, all would - have been lo=\r\nst. I - thank you deeply for your\n&gt; &gt; loyalty, and - constant vigil over th=\r\ne Autobot vessel. Once I - figure out how to revive my comrades, I - will b=\r\ne sure they know of your valliant efforts to - protect what is most preciou=\r\ns to us. R - Rat Tap. You too, have - shown bravery in your actions. I owe =\r\nyou as much, if not more of my loyalty to you. without - your help, I would=\r\n not have gotten out of that fortress.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord elder looked almost embar=\r\nrassed as Tuscon thanked him. &quot;I only\n&gt; did what any Maximal would do for a=\r\n comrade in arms.&quot; he said, a small\n&gt; smile appearing on his face. &quot;But bef=\r\nore you thank me, let&#39;s get you\n&gt; home first.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a burst of power f=\r\nrom the engines, flames burst from the VTOL\n&gt; boosters and and lifted them =\r\noff the ground. As they rose the shuttle\n&gt; shook as the craft complained ab=\r\nout damage from the rather rough\n&gt; landing. However the shuttle quickly lev=\r\neled out as Lord Elder turned\n&gt; the ship and put them on course back toward=\r\ns the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Not - at all. Lord Elder, I - have one favor to ask you.=\r\n I&#39;d - like to pay my respects to Optimus - Prime once we arrive at the Ark=\r\n. Do - I have permission to enter the Ark to do so?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course Tuscon=\r\n, we will all be entering the Ark.&quot; Elder said from\n&gt; his seat, his voice s=\r\nomewhat distracted, &quot;But make sure that you don&#39;t\n&gt; disturb anything. It is=\r\n very important that we leave everything as we\n&gt; find it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The shuttle=\r\n rumbled a bit as the engines sputtered and ignited again,\n&gt; &quot;That is if we=\r\n make it back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
