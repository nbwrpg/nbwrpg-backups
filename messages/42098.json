Waiting for the shuttle \nto approach had been a welcome opportunity for rest, but now it was time to \nmeet some potential allies.\n\nVorbIss jumped out of the tree and transformed to robot mode. With the \nmodifications to his left arm in beast mode, his left arm now looked slightly \ndisfigured. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to work on my transformations. This left arm \ndidn&#39;t take the taser mounting well.&quot; thought Vorb to himself, forgetting \nabout Iss for a second. [Indeed, you must work on your transformationa a \ngreat deal.] replied Iss. [With practice and sufficient computing power, you \nmay learn to transform yourself without harm to other modes.] Iss noted to \nhimself VorbIss&#39;s right arm, which was looking and feeling entirely normal, \ndespite the laser hidden away in its mechanics.\n\n&quot;Hello, future. Heh. The Alliance. Not a great name, but it sounds like a \ndecently strong faction. I guess I&#39;ll knwo soon enough.&quot; VorbIss said aloud, \nto nobody in particular, as he scanned the shuttle.\n\nSeeing no danger, VorbIss walked over and into the shuttle. Surely some \nautomatic systems would respond to his presence.\n\n"}}
