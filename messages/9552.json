But you\n&gt; should be feeling better shortly.&quot;\n&gt; She stayed next to him. She was getting worried.  Quickstrike was\n&gt; down and needed help and attention.  KitKat was off at the Vokcave\n&gt; looking for Rowdy.   Stringtra and Wildfire were off in the forest\n&gt; after Wildfire told her there was danger out there. Megatron was who\n&gt; knows where doing who knows what and the Matrix knew when he would\n&gt; return.\n&gt; That left her, Terrorsaur, Scorponok and Drillbit.  She felt scared\n&gt; and sick at the same time.  No one was there other than Scorponok,\n&gt; who could lead the group.  And she hadn&#39;t seen Scorponok for a while.\n&gt; She knew that if something happened, she couldn&#39;t defend the base and\n&gt; the others for very long.  She had the autoweapons and a few other\n&gt; little tricks, but nothing that would stay off an attacker for a\n&gt; really long time.  She was getting nervous.  She got up and walked\n&gt; over to Terrorsaur.  She looked up at him with worry in her eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If anything happens, can I count on you to help me around here? I\n&gt; will be needing you eventually. There are only 5 of us here at the\n&gt; base. And you are the strongest out of all of us right now. Please\n&gt; tell me that when the time comes, I can count on you to help?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike looked up at Dark Mouse with his foot still propped up\n&gt; against\n&gt; &gt; the wall.
