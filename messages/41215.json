Walking up the hill behind Pacifix he pulled out \nhis \n&gt; mingun. Standing silently beside Pacifix.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Slag saw Crossroads trying to help up Grimlock.  He walked over \n&gt; and tried to slap the bot out of the way.  &quot;Dinobots no need help \n&gt; from weaklings.&quot; he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; JetV sat, hidden in the bushes.  &quot;Artemis &quot; he whispered &quot; don&#39;t \nlet \n&gt; yourself be revieled.

As he got to the edge of the \n&gt; clearing he looked straight at Pacifix.  &quot;They must all train you \nthe \n&gt; same, Autobot, you are as stupid for letting us go as that idiot \n&gt; leader Prime was.  &quot;  he said with a sly smile.  Then turning and \n&gt; jumping into the air flying west.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; JetV followed behind, in the undergroath of the forest.\n\n\n"}}
