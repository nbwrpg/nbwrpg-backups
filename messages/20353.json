Tears were starting to well up in her \neyes. &quot;No&quot; she whispered.  She felt her spark breaking. She sat down \non the table and stared of into space. She shook her head as the \ntears rolled down her cheeks. &quot;No...no..no, he can&#39;t be gone. He just \ncan&#39;t be gone. Oh holy matrix, no, please no.&quot; She covered her face \nwith her hands and cried uncontrollably. From what she was told, her \nlove was lost to her, forever.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm sadly shakes his head.

He might have been reprogrammed, in which case they \n&gt; probably cleared his memory.
