The animal at his side getting up and \nmoving a bit in excitement. She could sense it. Finally he sighed as he saw \nHavoc begin to run down the hall, simply shrugging and following close \nbehind.\nIf he was correct, this was an island�and water didn�t exactly agree with \nhim.\nShesta padded at his heels.**\n\n� This is an island, right? In need you or one of your team members to get \nme to mainland then.�\n\n** There was no point in asking nicely; he had always been told to order or \ntake what he wanted. And to get into the battle and see if he could slag a \nfew Maximals while scouting for Von sounded good to him.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
