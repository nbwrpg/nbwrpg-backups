Stumbling slightly, he\n&gt; &gt; makes his way south. The bot wasn&#39;t too far.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; The shuttle slows down as it approaches where VorbIss was, lowering in\n&gt; &gt; altitude and landing. A hatch opens as it scans for VorbIss.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::VorbIss::\n&gt; \n&gt; [The shuttle is here.] projected Iss, startling Vorb out of a small nap. \n&gt; After mounting his left-arm taser (and an argon cutting laser kept secret as \n&gt; a backup by Iss), VorbIss had definately been tired. Waiting for the shuttle \n&gt; to approach had been a welcome opportunity for rest, but now it was time to \n&gt; meet some potential allies.\n&gt; \n&gt; VorbIss jumped out of the tree and transformed to robot mode. With the \n&gt; modifications to his left arm in beast mode, his left arm now looked slightly \n&gt; disfigured. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to work on my transformations. This left arm \n&gt; didn&#39;t take the taser mounting well.&quot; thought Vorb to himself, forgetting \n&gt; about Iss for a second. [Indeed, you must work on your transformationa a \n&gt; great deal.] replied Iss. [With practice and sufficient computing power, you \n&gt; may learn to transform yourself without harm to other modes.] Iss noted to \n&gt; himself VorbIss&#39;s right arm, which was looking and feeling entirely normal, \n&gt; despite the laser hidden away in its mechanics.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello, future. Heh. The Alliance. Not a great name, but it sounds like a \n&gt; decently strong faction. I guess I&#39;ll knwo soon enough.&quot; VorbIss said aloud, \n&gt; to nobody in particular, as he scanned the shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing no danger, VorbIss walked over and into the shuttle. Surely some \n&gt; automatic systems would respond to his presence.\n\n\n"}}
