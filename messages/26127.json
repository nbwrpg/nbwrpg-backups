He was bad with \ndirections, but maybe this would be a good time to practice:\n\n&quot;Allright! Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\nRion ran head first down the sand dune he happened to be standing on, \neventually tumbling down it and landing with a face full of sand.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria:\n\nThe shields, unable to maintain the break for even ten seconds, finally \nfluctuated and died out. She opened a comm to IR:\n\n&quot;Commander, the shields are off line, I&#39;m sorry, but there&#39;s nothing more I \ncan do except disengage the lockdown on your command.&quot;\n\n*****\n\nTavatron watched as the &#39;bots exited the base. Everything seemed to be \ntoning down. The tension had lessend by a noticible degree... and something \nsmall and fuzzy was flying toward Dinobot&#39;s head. Tavatron rubbed her \noptics. She had to be seeing things. The stress of battle and lack thereof \nwas wearing on her. She desperetly needed sleep. Her fur was cacked with \ndired mud and fluid, that of her enemies and her own. However, too much of \nit WAS her own, and that posed a problem. All the while she continued \nrubbing her eyes, convinced there was nothing small, fuzzy, and winged \nflying toward Dinobot&#39;s head. At least, she hoped so.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
