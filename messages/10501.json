Watching as Prowl opened it for her and smiling up at him as he turned back towards her.\nIron Raptor almost shivered with chill at the thought of what had almost happened in the Alliance base, her smile almost disappearing. But then, as she watched Prowl�s eyes soften, her smile returned and warmed. The look of love in his eyes making her forget about her bad Alliance experiences and making her wish that she was repaired NOW, not even wanting a second to pass without him near.\nShe stepped close to him, putting a hand on his chest and one on his shoulder-plate. Her features softening again. *\n\n� As long as I�m with you�I�m always home.�\n\n* With that she leaned in and pressed her lips gently to his own, the kiss soft and loving.\nThen, leaning back with a contented sigh she looked into Prowl�s optics and smiled warmly, brushing her fingers alongside of his neck. *\n\n� I�ll see you in a mega-cycle.�\n\n* Her voice was as soft and loving as her kiss.\nThen, she removed her hands and turned towards the CR chamber, stepping inside and hearing the door begin to close behind her.\nTurning, she caught a glimpse of Prowl before the doors closed and left her in darkness, the same warming and soft smile on her lips.\nAs her systems began to ready themselves for repair she realized that she was completely and helplessly in love, a fact that she didn�t mind one little bit.\nIron Raptor sighed as her systems powered down and began the process of repair, her last thoughts being of what Prowl would do as he waited for her. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
