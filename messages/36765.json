In this version, which is\nBeast wars, and seems to be based on the cartoon of Transformers, there\nwas no Primus. At least, not mentioned. They were all made as simple\nmachines, to work as the Quintessons felt needed, but when the\nQuintessons made the mistake of giving them personalities, they\nrebelled. Also, it&#39;s not necessarily clean cut, I mean, sure the\nDecepticons act evil, but in their minds, they may be justified.\nMegatron&#39;s quote is &quot;peace through tyranny.&quot; and by that, I think it\nimplies he wants peace, but the universe isnt able to achieve it if they\nare free, as people tend to be greedy. This is just my opinion of\ncourse, and I think the Decepticons are pure evil (dont ask me why I\nlike em that way, I havent the foggiest) but there isnt a rule book\nsaying right or wrong. And they never stated clearly about this whole\nMatrix pit thing in the cartoon. That&#39;s just your take on it\nLegendarynemasis.\n\n"}}
