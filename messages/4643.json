He really wanted to \nmake idle conversation to interrupt the silence. \n    Soon they reached the quarter section of the base. He walked up to a door \nand pressed a button. The door opened. Inside was the basics, a bed, a desk, \nwith a computer, a weapons rack, and a few shelves. He went across the hall \nand opened the another door. Inside was the same layout. Both had windows, \nbut were covered with rock.\n    &quot;You may pick either room, they are exactly the same.&quot; Bazooka said to \nthem both. &quot;Magmatron has granted you access to most of the ship, you may \nexplore at your will. He has also requested that you report to the lab in 20 \ncycles. Which gives you plenty of time to get aquatinted with you new home.&quot;\n    Bazooka left them to their exploring.\n\n"}}
