She wasn&#39;t sure how to get all the predacon \ngroups together to finish out her council.  There were 6 seats on the \ncouncil.  That was the required number to have on a beginning council \nper the old laws.  She had two seats filled out. She had herself and \nAracnia.  That left four. She thought about havng Megatron and \nHellBeast on the council. That left two seats open. She wasn&#39;t sure \nwho would fill them, but she figured the matrix would help her on \nthat. \n\nShe then refocused on Gabriel.  &quot;What happens to the others. Tell me, \nwhat do you know about my future. You said I am to destroy the \nAllience. But what happens to the rest of the groups.  What happens \nto the maximals? To my group?  What happens to my pack, to Drillbit. \nPlease tell me? I have to know.&quot; her voice showed great concern for \nher group and Drillbit.  She looked at the hologram. &quot;Let our paths \nlead where they may? I have that as a philosiphy, but as a battle \ncry?&quot; She smiled.  &quot;I would have thought that I&#39;d have said something \nlike, Predacons unite now and forever, or something like that.&quot;\nShe smiled. She couldn&#39;t fight the prophecy. Or at least, she didn&#39;t \nthink that she could.\n\n\n\n"}}
