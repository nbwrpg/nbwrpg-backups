Get your butt over here and bust a hole in the \nwalls or something! I&#39;m already healed and I have a weapon but still need a \nway out. Help me, and I&#39;ll make it worth your while. Now, come!&quot;\n\n* So she sent, and then waited. Either to shot a Maximal, or to be saved my \nan Alliance bot. Either suited her just fine.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
