Blacknightmare is in a simulation type\n&gt;thing where hjer body is actually in a capsule of sort. Whatever\n&gt;happens to her body in the simulation, happens to her in the pod.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; LN, if your holo is attacking Blacknightmare, then I suggest that\n&gt; &gt; you re-post. Though it&#39;s not in the rules (Yan forgot to add it\n&gt;in),\n&gt; &gt; holograms are images, and cannot do damage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 19 Jul 2001, at 20:55, Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The simulation Hellpeon smirked as it flew forward at\n&gt;Blacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and slashed at her with its Chaochitan energy sword a few times\n&gt;before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; launching another large Chaochitan energy at Blacknightmare. For\n&gt;her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there was no other escape from here except death, thus was the\n&gt;penalty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for failing the test. Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at Darkfate\n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;They will work. Or you will die. As far as I can see its\n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; win-win situation for me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With those words Blight walked through a new opening in the wall\n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sealed itself right back up after he left. He was now once again\n&gt;in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled somewhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before his message played over the comm lines of every single\n&gt;member\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Darkfates men.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander,\n&gt;Darkfate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is now our prisoner. If you do not do as we say, we shall kill\n&gt;him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You are all to stop with whatever you are doing and are to come\n&gt;to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; location of this transmission. You will recieve further orders\n&gt;from me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big\n&gt;whirlpool.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button. Back\n&gt;in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device\n&gt;activated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back to\n&gt;ledger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly shrank\n&gt;leaving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section of\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base. And still at the bases&#39; center a massive hole was now in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ground but all within the hole was metal and electronics beneath\n&gt;that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And still the nanites continued to build down deeper into the\n&gt;already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seemingly bottomless thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare/Darkfate::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fight;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she had a lot things to live, she had to destroy Vamprah and\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most important: She liked to see Orchestra again. Blacknightmare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started to looking for a way to scape... Pain was increasing\n&gt;with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every second.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate smirked and said &quot;I will be a prisioner without worth,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unless you try to force the troops that I bring here to work\n&gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
