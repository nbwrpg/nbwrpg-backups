What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nucson had not rested, and his damages again taking their toll.

Yet his legs very shakey from the paraylizing effects of=\r\n the weapons, it was clear that his upper body was returning. Still rather =\r\ndented from his ordeal, and damaged, he was not about to let Darkhawk get h=\r\nis way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; On the contrary, same here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; He sends a sonar wave to Rat Trap, which intern, interrupts the effe=\r\nct of the paraylasis dart, thus returning him to a somewhat normal state. H=\r\ne gets back up and stands to watch the action unfold.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quo=\r\nt;Now ya really slagged my pal off, Feather Head.. Nice gon&#39;.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Tucson thrusts Darkhawk to the ground harshly and then transfo=\r\nrms. Rat Trap gets the cue and gets into his front cab. He helps his friend=\r\n by blasting at the door, forcing it open.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; OKAY WHE=\r\nELS, NOWWWW! BURN RUBBER!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Tucson spins his tires and =\r\ncreates another smoke screen with his duel exhaust system as his engine roa=\r\nrs to full tilt. Now he was able to sense Nightlight, and before leaving he=\r\n was determined to get her out of there. It may not have been Rodimus who h=\r\ne had intended but if he could not save his leader, he would at least save =\r\na trusty comrade.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rat Trap keeps buckled in. Tucson assess=\r\nes his systems, and finds his location tracking units online.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &quot;Tracking systems online all systems working at sixty percent, and =\r\nI have now pinpointed Nightlight&#39;s location. She&#39;s been moved.&quot=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rat Trap looks back, seeing that Tucson had a chance to =\r\nliterally run Darkhawk over but chose not to.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Awww ra=\r\nts! Ya didn&#39;t run feather head over!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Tucson repli=\r\nes.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;That&#39;s not the Autobot way, Rat Trap. We do =\r\nnot take lives needlessly. But, if some of my speedster comrades can get aw=\r\nay with tearing the track, why the slag shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; His speed climbs to one forty MPH. Rat Trap holds on for dear life.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;WOOHOOOO! THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;M TALKN&#39; ABOUT! Ful=\r\nl speed ahead, next stop,knight in silver armor take one. Ya know, if she t=\r\nakes one look at you, she may fall head over heels for ya.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson chuckles although it hurts him to do so.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quo=\r\nt; You&#39;re too much.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rat Trap keeps an eye behind =\r\nthem via Tucson&#39;s rear view mirror.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;You&#39;re ri=\r\nght, I gotta keep focused. They&#39;ll be after you like hounds on a crimin=\r\nal after that little display back there, which I may add, was rather impres=\r\nsive.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Tucson navigates through the tower, with Rat T=\r\nrap at the wheel.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Hey, pay attention to what&#39;s in=\r\n front of us, I don&#39;t want to smack into the wall here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; Rat Trap quickly averts a wall while getting Tucson away from it.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Whooops, good point. And this is why I ain&#39;t never=\r\n got a driver&#39;s license. Okay Wheels, which way?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nHe takes a hard left, following his sonar systems. He slows his speed down =\r\nonce comming to where the signal is the strongest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot; =\r\nWe&#39;re here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rat Trap gets out as Tucson slowly tr=\r\nansforms into his robot mode. He finds himself unstable on his feet, and st=\r\numbles into where Nightlight is, and falls on his knees.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\nquot;Wheels?! What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Tucson had not reste=\r\nd, and his damages again taking their toll. He slowly gets back up onto his=\r\n feet and realizes that his robot mode takes more energy than his vehicle m=\r\node. He had to remain in bot form, if he was going to get Nightlight out of=\r\n her bind.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Night - Light. It&#39;s - me.. Tucson. I =\r\n- don&#39;t have much energy left, but I have not forgotten about you. R- r=\r\nodimus, is hopeless. I - can not save him now, but I can definitely save yo=\r\nu.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; With what appears to be a scream of anger, over w=\r\nhat Zarak and the others had done to Rodimus and Nightlight, Tucson uses a =\r\npowerful blast of sonar energy, to short out the security system around Nig=\r\nhtlight&#39;s holding cell and risks further pain by trying to break the fo=\r\nrce shields around her, using his own body as a buffer!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &q=\r\nuot;AHHHHH!!!!
