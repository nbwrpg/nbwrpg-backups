The hot weather put a strain on him he wasn&#39;t used to. \nHe found himself short of breath, and panting with each movement. It \nwas hot, something he didn&#39;t expect. The cold blustery weather in the \nnorthern section of what will one day be Canada was his climate. This \nwould be more difficult to adapt to than he origionally thought.\n\nHe approached the ship cautiously, hoping none of the survivors had \nan itchy triggerfinger.\n\n&quot;Striker what&#39;s the situation? do they need medical assistance?&quot;\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Yeah, you can have Cheetor, Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll take it that you&#39;re firing at The Cybertronian Fire, JP?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Kluster/Striker/Prowl/Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker looks at Kluster questioningly as his comm-link plays back \n&gt; Lunarpine&#39;s message.
