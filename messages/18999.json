He was sick of war. All he really want\n&gt; was to settle down, with KitKat.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Demolition::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;one cycle, aye!&quot;\n&gt; He opened fire on Blender.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt;\n&gt; He stagered back to hid room, drunk. He made it to the bed, and passed\n&gt; out. He had a dream.\n&gt; He was on a junk planet. He had just walked out of a Quintison ship. The\n&gt; Dinobots were behind him, and Kup was next to him. He was looking at an\n&gt; odd group of Transformers. He turned to Kup.\n&gt; &quot;What was that universal greeting, again? Nevermind I remember.&quot; He\n&gt; turned back to the odd TFs, and pulled out a Energon stick.\n&gt; &quot;Bah weep grana weep nini bong.&quot; The leader excepted the Energon. they\n&gt; repeated the greeting a few time. The Junkions and Autobots danced.\n&gt; He continued to remember the past. His grief over Feline was combating\n&gt; the chip.\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Dont worry he is not turning good anythime soon. He will have a\n&gt; battle of good and evil in his head for a wile though.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
