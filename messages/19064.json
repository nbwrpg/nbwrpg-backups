She wanted to say something, then thought \nbetter of it and just stood there.  She knew that she was nothing \nmore than a worthless mouse.  \n\n\nShe was about to ask one of the maximals to kill her and put her out \nof her misery. But then with the energon on her body, that wouldn&#39;t \nbe such a good idea.  She&#39;d live anyway.  She looked around and then \ngot an idea.  She thought that maybe she could prove herself.  She \nnudged Destructor&#39;s shoulder and whispered,&quot;PSSSST, I got an idea. I \nthink I know a way to convince them.&quot;  she walked out and towards the \nmaximals.  She had her hands raised above her head and kept her body \nposture in a submissive state.  She walked slowly and carefully over \ntowards the maximals. She looked at them and then focused her eyes on \nRamulus. She put her hands down at her side  and bowed to him.  &quot;I..I \nam DarkMouse.  I..I am willing to give you a gift, my gift, if you \nwill let us help build the ark with you.&quot;  She quickly drew a small \ndagger from her side and gave herself a deep cut in her wrist.  She \nheld out her arm so that The maximals might see the cut.  The mech \nfluid and energon mixture glowed as it flowed out of the cut.  Then \nthe cut started to heal up.  In a matter of a few moments, the cut \nwas completely healed.  &quot;This is my gift to you if you will trust us \nand let us help you.&quot;  She looked at him with real Sencerety on her \nface.  She really was going to give them her secret.  She coudn&#39;t \nbelieve she was doing this, but her spark was now being guided by \nsomething.   She hoped it was the matrix.\n\n\n"}}
