I assumed they were pirates \n&gt; &#39;cause the only identification on the ship was a big black skull.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He scratches his chin.  &quot;Now that I think of it, I did manage to \nfind \n&gt; a match in my ship&#39;s database for that logo - a terrorist \n&gt; organization that call themselves the Rogues.
