While the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; escort of MAXIMALS was too heavy for a plotted assassination attempt, b=\r\nut\n&gt; &gt; with communications seemingly down according to what was being said =\r\nover the\n&gt; &gt; area, if the MAXIMAL LEADER LEO PRIME could be split apart fro=\r\nm his escorts,\n&gt; &gt; then perhpas he could be overwhelmed..  AT the ver least=\r\n, an amusing thing\n&gt; &gt; to contemplate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, in the trees BLAC=\r\nKARACHNIA kept her myriad optics in her spider\n&gt; &gt; mode peeled, glancing up=\r\n at the aerial Maximals while she languidly thought\n&gt; &gt; about how she could=\r\n disable thier wingspans.  But, quite simply they were\n&gt; &gt; too BIG for her =\r\nto take out even from ambush and with luck on her side and\n&gt; &gt; cut off from=\r\n support.  LEO PRIME had chosen his backup well, and there would\n&gt; &gt; be nos=\r\n neak strike.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just what would they find over out there, and what wo=\r\nuld they be going after\n&gt; &gt; now?

Neither side\n&gt; trusted each other, and the tesnsion in the air could be=\r\n cut with a\n&gt; microserated blade.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment the communication line=\r\ns were still open, including the\n&gt; one between BLACK ARACHNIA and TARANTULU=\r\nS, but very soon, as they\n&gt; would venture further towards the forest, that =\r\ntoo would cease to\n&gt; exist. They would all be cut off from outside help, an=\r\nd they would\n&gt; have to rely on their own skills and instincts, and even eac=\r\nh other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I expect a full report when you get back.&quot; TARANTULUS transm=\r\nitted\n&gt; through his link with BLACK ARACHNIA, &quot;But for the moment I will ha=\r\nve\n&gt; time to keep an optic on Hydras&#39; base while he is gone.&quot; There was a\n&gt;=\r\n soft chuckle from TARANTULUS as if he were already contemplating some\n&gt; so=\r\nrt of mayhem.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
