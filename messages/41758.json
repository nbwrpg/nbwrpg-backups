He refrains from firing on the enemy due to the fact that \nthere were friendlies in the line of fire. His sensors pick up \nAstroblast entering the battle.\n\nAstroblast swoops in from a high altitude, and checks out the battle. \nHe doesn&#39;t fire immediately, but manoevers to approach from a better \nangle. He waits till the allies weren&#39;t going to be hit by his fire, \nand he unleashes four laser blast, two from each cannon.\n\nooc: Clearing a few things up, mostly for Yanshosh anyway. The ship \nis called the D-a-r-k A-v-i-a-n. (not the Dark Avion) Also, the ship \nisn&#39;t under the water, it is floating half in and half out of the \nwater. =)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Autofire::\n&gt; \n&gt; Autofire lowers down deeper into the ocean as he speeds toward the \n&gt; ship, finally pulling up and flying toward the surface at a 70 \ndegree \n&gt; angle, erupting from the water around the ship in his jet mode. He \n&gt; flies up toward Darkwing, on a collision course and firing twenty \n&gt; shots from both his front cannons at the bot.\n\n\n\n"}}
