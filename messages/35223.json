His battle wounds weren&#39;t that bad, and he would be out \nsoon. He sets up the CR, and starts the process.\n\nRippersnapper arrives back at base after a disapointing end to his \nfight with Orion, and he isn&#39;t too happy, not that he is every really \nhappy though. &quot;Rippersnapper want to crush slag out of bots.&quot; He \nleaps at Sinnertwin from behind.\n\nSwitchblade smiles. A new warrior to match the previous creation. \n&quot;As I recall, there were two bots in the base who don&#39;t belong. \nFirestrike, find them,&quot; he says coldly, &quot;and terminate them.&quot; he \nfinishes with a glint in his glowing green eyes. &quot;I expect NO \nfailures.&quot; Switchblade exits the lab, and heads up to control room.\n\nDead-End and Drag Strip arrive at the base. They land, and enter \nthe base only to find that only one of the ship&#39;s CR chambers ins&#39;t \nin use. Drag Strip pushes Dead-End out of the way, and walks \ninside, starting the process. Dead-End grumbles, &quot;...crazy loser, I&#39;ll \nget the CR eventually, it really doesn&#39;t matter when I get it as long \nas I do.&quot; He checks out his charred right side, and winces in pain \nas he touches one deep gash, probably from the shrapnel of a \nmissile.\n\n"}}
