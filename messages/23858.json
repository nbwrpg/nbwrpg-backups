He laughs, looking back at the Cybertronian Fire and \nfiring two more glowing missiles, both of them hitting the shields \nand sending an energy current through it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRex backs up carefully, watching Repressor&#39;s every move. They were \nslowly circling each other, Repressor&#39;s back now to the CF. Rex \ndidn&#39;t hear the warning over the sounds of gunfire, and was blinded \nby the flash. Repressor had been standing with his back to the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\nRex swears, stumbling forward, his optics scrambled. He feels two \nmissiles slam into his chest, sending him falling to the ground. If \nhe lived through this, the bot that threw that flash wouldn&#39;t, Rex \nthinks before slipping into unconsciousness.\n\nRepressor laughs, watching Rex fall back. His laugh cuts off as he is \nhit in the back with an EMP shot from the CF, sending him flipping \nover Rex and falling to the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral and Fenox were blinded by the flash. Their scanners took over \nas their optics began to readjust. THe rest of the team had covered \ntheir eyes.\n\nThey continue blasting at the shields, hitting them with shot after \nshot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot yells as he is blinded by the flash, stumbling back. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing his opportunity, Proto swoops down toward Perndabot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster swears again. Shots were pummeling the shields again and \nagain.\n\n&quot;If we don&#39;t get rid of these bots soon, we&#39;re gonna be toast,&quot; he \nsays to himself, watching the battle.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Gabriel and savior flew infront of the cf. They saw magnus being \nfired upon. \n&gt; They took cover behind his armor and watched as his guns started \nfire. \n&gt; Gabriel remembered his special tool against the crazy bot from \nbefore. He \n&gt; yelled out to all the maximals. &quot;Get behind Magnus and shield your \neyes.&quot; As \n&gt; he said it he pulled a flare bomb from his back and chucked it over \nthe top \n&gt; of the truck armor. He watched and pressed the remote denenator as \nit \n&gt; cleared. It should blind all the bots infront of magnus for about \n15 seconds.\n\n\n"}}
