Legacy, Talon, you two okay?!&quot;\n\nLegacy=\r\n quickly looked around the battlefield, noting the somewhat\ndiminished numb=\r\ner of combatants, &quot;I am undamaged.&quot; he said in his\ntypically cold tones as =\r\nhe continued to attempt to pick off some of\nthe enemy.\n\n&gt; Straight Shot too=\r\n, finds herself firing off arrows just to try and slow the insect beings do=\r\nwn, while she desperately tries to help Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perceptor, I need y=\r\nou to turn off your audio sensors for a short time. I&#39;m going to attempt a =\r\nsonar blast which I hope will slow things down for us enough to get to Rodi=\r\nmus. That way I know I will not harm you when I do emit this attack. Straig=\r\nht Shot, when I&#39;m through doing that, tap him on the shoulder to let him kn=\r\now it&#39;s safe to turn them back on.&quot;\n\nAs the alien insectoid menace of 5 con=\r\ntinued to advance, the next\nround of combat began!\n\nTuscon gave orders to P=\r\nerceptor to shut down his audio receptors, and\nthereby holding his attack.\n=\r\n\nPerceptor, desperately tried to turn off his receptors, and as if like\na s=\r\nwitch had been thrown his whole world went dark as his sensors\nwhich in man=\r\ny ways relied on hearing was short down. He could still\nsmell the attacking=\r\n creatures approach, but in no way would this sense\nof smell allow him to f=\r\nire under battle conditions.\n\nSeeing that Perceptor had successfully went d=\r\nark he let loose with his\nsonic discharge, sending wave after disruptive wa=\r\nve into the tunnel!\n\nFor a moment the insectoid creatures looked at Tuscon =\r\nas a strange\nsort of intelligence flashed through their optics before each =\r\none, one\nby one slumped over, victims of his attack. They all fell into sta=\r\nsis\nlock.\n\nHowever at the same time, due perhaps to the wide area sonic att=\r\nack,\nthe walls themselves around the group began to rumble and shake as\nbit=\r\ns of stone and debris began to fall from the ceiling.\n\nAlthough Perceptor c=\r\nould not see or hear, his vibrational sensors and\nhis digger&#39;s instincts to=\r\nld him one thing: CAVE IN!!!!!\n\n(OOC: be very cautious about having charact=\r\ners doing a lot in your\nnext post(s) as there is not much time!
