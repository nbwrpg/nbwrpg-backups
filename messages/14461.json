Her muscles relaxing more now that they were stretched, her wings \nthen folding in to drape over her shoulders and the claws at the end \nconnecting to form a natural cloak.\nDesmonus watched as Zardus left the console and walked over to her, every \nsystem in her body telling her that this man was her \ncommander...NO...MASTER. And should be treated as such.\nHer head blowed as Zardus came up to her but her stomach couldn&#39;t help but \ngrowl in hunger again as the scent of his warm fluid, her senses almost \nseeming to become swamped with the smell.\nShe indeed WAS hungry.\nBut, this bot before he would be the only one safe from her feeding bite, \nher systems warning her of that at the very moment.*\n\n&quot; Thank you, Lord. However, my true objectives were only the lights.&quot;\n\n* She lifted her head slightly so that she was now looking into his optics, \nher own anber eyes reflecting many things.\nCunning,loyalty, hunger, evil, perfect.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
