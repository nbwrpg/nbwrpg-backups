Hearing past phrases from Master Yoketron , Tucson =\r\nrides the torrent of water as if flying through air, as wings double as fin=\r\ns, guiding him masterfully toward the root of the problem.  Saberback.   He=\r\n was the one hindering his progress.  Once again he shifts from dragon to w=\r\narrior and draws his blade while still riding the wave of water like a skil=\r\nled surfer, using the walls of the cavern like a surf board, gaining altitu=\r\nde and ground on Saberback.  Yet he makes no attempt to strike him directly=\r\n.  With his sword Tucson guides the water over the blade, in a sideways pos=\r\nition, guiding a torrent of water in Saberbacks direction, in an attempt to=\r\n throw him off long enough to rescue Optimus Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; A storm can find=\r\n anyone, no matter how devious they may think they are.
