Bt you can tell me from in there.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix removes Ramulus&#39; spark. The glowing orb, shining with bright \nlight. Brix alomst gets lost in it; could have been staring at it \nforever. He snaps out of it when he remembers it&#39;s Ramulus, and \nplaces it back in his body.\n\nFliq feels all control of his body come back when Ramulus leaves. He \nlooks himself up and down, with his new fuzor form.\n\n&quot;Wow....I guess tyhat TM2 stuff affects the spark in some way. If the \nbattles ever stopped, I would study it. But we don&#39;t have time. So \nhow de we get off this rock?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois held Child in his arms.\n\n&quot;No....why did you have to do that? You haven&#39;t been trained. You \nhave not unlocked your full power. Why do you always put yourself in \ndanger.&quot;\n\nHe continued to keep Child in his arms, and he turned to Windrazor&#39;s \ngroup.\n\n&quot;Go back to the embassy and get the rest of the parts.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nThe Trainers/Savage\n\nPrebon was starring at a computer, giving Savage&#39;s signs. He studyed \nit carefully.\n\n&quot;The chip has identified a certain bot that Savage truly hates. \nComputer, acces memory file for that bot.&quot; A picture comes up.\n\n&quot;Hmmm........ He has the Maximal symbol. What base does he come from?&quot;\n\nThe memories come up of Savage&#39;s attack on the Ark.\n\n&quot;The Ark! It&#39;s here. Amazing. And these Maximals are using it as a \nbase. We need to defeat it. Killing must be done. Savage&#39;s anger \ntowards this bot will serve us well. Men, get ready! In a mega-cycle \nwe attack the Ark!&quot;\n\nThat bot is in for a lot of trouble. That bot is.....Striker.\n\n\n"}}
