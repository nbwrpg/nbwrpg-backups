We are entering the upper atmosphere, now.&quot; \nReflector replied.\n\nFrom the outside of the ship it would look like it was starting to catch fire \nas it seemed to &#39;dive bomb&#39; downwards towards the surface of the Earth.  In \ntruth the ship was just getting extremely hot on the sides and tips.\n\n&quot;How is the hull holding?&quot;\n\n&quot;Holding perfectly, Archbishop.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good.&quot;\n\n&quot;Brace for impact, Brothers!&quot; Sun Crusher yelled, grabbing a hold of his \nterminal as gravity took full effect, all the floating bodies and scrap \nsuddenly slamming to the ground as Earth&#39;s gravity took hold.  The ship went \ndownward, now in the sky, above what seemed to be an endless filed of gold.  \nIn reality, it was sand.\n\nThe large battle cruiser slammed into the sand front first, looking like it \nwas going to flip, but it fell on it&#39;s belly, shaking hard, blowing up a wave \nof sand.\n\nSeveral minutes later, Vehement unharnessed himself, getting to his feet as \nif groggy, feeling mech-fluid leaking from his forehead.  He had no idea how \nthat had happened.  \n&quot;What in the Pit?&quot; he asked himself, examining the cut further with his \nhands.  He looked and saw a sword near his feat.  \n\nOf course, he thought, the sword must&#39;ve flew through the air and struck me \nwhen the ship was crashing.  &quot;REFLECTOR.  SUN CRUSHER.  Are you alrlight my \nBrothers?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Sun Crusher replied, unstrapping himself and getting up.  He was \nunharmed, as was Reflector.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; Reflector said, pointing to Vehement&#39;s wound.\n\n&quot;I know.  I must use a CR chamber.  It should only take a dozen cycles or so, \nit is nothing.  I want a full report when I return.&quot; the Archbishop replied, \nheading off to his CR chambers.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s see where we are on Past Earth.&quot; Reflector said, checking his \nterminal.  &quot;What will soon be known as Ulaanbaator.  The capital of the \nnation of Mongolia.  Those steppe warriors once held most of Asia and Eastern \nEurope in their grasp.  Then internal feuding caused their eventual downfall.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ulaanbaator?&quot;\n\n&quot;It means &quot;Red Hero&quot;.  The Mongolians were taken over by Manchuria, and a \nWhite Russian Army (loyal to the Czar) took possession of Mongolia, easily \ndefeating the Manchurian garrison.  A Red Russian Army (Communist) took \nMongolia, and less then a solar rotation later gave Mongolia its \nindependence.  And the USSR helped Mongolia greatly, hence the &quot;Red Hero&quot;.  \nThey had to stop helping Mongolia when they themselves began to bankrupt.&quot;\n\nReflector nodded, storing the information in his data banks, beginning to \ncollect the data they had scanned.\n\n"}}
