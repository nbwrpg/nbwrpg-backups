Again, my apologies)\n\n\n\n* Dinobot grimaced as he watched Oblitertron continue to fire but was almost amazed to see the huge Alliance threat lower it�s weapon but then aim it towards another direction and fire, then looking of in the direction in which it had shot and seeing the third-in-command fembot there�standing just as fearless and determined as he.\nThat woman had a lot of guts it seemed to stand against such a threat, the hope of winning against a bot of such size already vanished and was very visible in her expression�or so it seemed to him.\nBut it also surprised him of how she then explained that it was all right to take all the mistakes in which the Maximals had made out on her, willing to accept the responsibility for her troop&#39;s actions. A very noble and responsible stand.\nBut then he turned his head painfully towards Oblitertron once again, the danger being to great to take ones optics from for long. It was very apparent that they would be forced into the unwanted battle with the Alliance thank to the bots in which had fired upon the great bot when there had been an order to cease fire, most Maximals not listening to a simple command being much of a disappointment to him.\nThe Maximals had changed since he had last been alive; they had gone from a few ordered bots to a whole army of corruption. From winners to losers, how long it had taken that change to occur still evaded him.\nPained by his wounds and his systems slowly failing he stood, ready for action but knowing that he was in no shape to fight. His breathing had gone from quick but smooth to slow, shallow and a bit raspy, the obvious tell tale sign of internal bleeding.\n Dinobot could barely stay on his own feet let alone keep Tavatron�s limp form from falling from his arms, the added weight of his annoyance and slightly dampened rage only making things worse. He was in a very bad position and he knew it, if the enemy was to strike now then he had no clue as to what he could do to prevent it.\nBut then a sudden action of movement from the giant robot caught his attention and only made him realize more of how he could not move much from this spot, his body to tired and beaten to even obey the simple commands of movement. The strain was enough just commanding his lungs to expand and contract to bring in enough air for his spark, the thoughts of quick actions and reflexes almost impossible for his mind to conform.\nBut when the optic lasers of the enemy bot fired in his direction his mind suddenly leaped into action, how to avoid it, how to dodge the blasts and still be active enough to run�but none of those ideas would work now because of the damage�his body was useless.\nHowever, his mind ranged to the outcome of the blasts, how they would hit and whom. The answer simple, they would strike both of them and with Tavatron and himself in their conditions who knew what might happen? But then it dawned on him, what if he could lessen the odds of them being hit�to only one of them being hit? That was it, that was the way in which to go. If both lives could not be saved then one would�Tavatron&#39;s.\nA sudden cold question raced through Dinobot�s mind, � Was she worth the cost?�\nBut without any other thought or insight on that question he then did the very action in which would save Tavatron�s life�and perhaps take his own. With every inch of will power and nerves he then forced his body with everything he had to turn away from the approaching charges, his back exposed and then his legs braced to take the full force of the blast.\nThere was no time for second thoughts or even a sudden yell of pain before the optic lasers sent from Oblitertron hit their target full force, an explosion erupting from the impact�dirt spraying in every direction as a large fire ball died away to leave the field clouded in fine dust again.\nWhat the eruption of dirt had hidden was an eruption of mech fluid from the lasers target, the very target still on it�s feet but then sinking to a kneel as the dust cleared�it�s cargo still in it�s arms but unharmed.\nDinobot had sunk to his knees, the impact had not been as hard as he had expected but the damage had been extreme!\nHis entire back was nothing more then tangles of wire and gears, a few patches of charred armor still visible through the mech fluid which coated the entire surface, wires and even a piece of his shoulder frame protruding thought the front of his shoulder due to the impact�throwing everything in that area right against the inside of the shoulder but then bursting through from the force.\nThere was barely an inch of his body that was not either completely scrapped or covered in mech fluid, the only thing that remained undamaged was not a part of his body but Tavatron herself�besides the fact that his own fluid now dotted her armor.\nNo longer able to keep Tavatron�s weight up he lowered her to the ground but propped her back up on his bent knee, his systems were now fading and deactivating slowly as he hung his head and closed his optics. He did not move, not a muscle in his body twitched as he just kneeled there�his mind too wracked with pain to even think to cry out.\nBut a question emerged in his mind, was he to die? Was he to either bleed to death or even be damaged further to the extent that he goes offline�permanently?\nHe had no idea�but he had succeeded in his mission�to save a life by throwing his own to the wind. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
