He kept listening just to make sure.\nThe\n&gt; Maximals could make a counterattack. Maybe they were at the ramp right\nnow,\n&gt; ready to blow the hatch down, and he and Mantella were right there.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ambient was a numb silence. Quickstrike was a little unsettled by it.\nHe\n&gt; could hear his own spark pulse with the quietness.\n&gt;\n&gt; He leaned away from the hatchway and stood up straight.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sounds like it&#39;s over,&quot; he announced to Mantella near-by. It was a good\n&gt; thing to him. He rather now fight at this time. But if he had to, he was\n&gt; ready. He always was. Even if was injured.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Stand out.
