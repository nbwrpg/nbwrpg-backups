Where to go? What to do...?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Good questions, both of them. But Mistra knew for a fact that she \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; get any answers here. Still, her status pod held her to this \nspot...it held \n&gt; the only real lead she had. Foolish as it was, considering it held \nno \n&gt; information...it was all she had. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t want to stay here...not if there maybe others on this \nplanet..&quot; she \n&gt; growled under her breath. So, one option came to mind. Even if the \nstatus pod \n&gt; was of no use to her, Mistra didn&#39;t want to risk leaving it out in \nthe open. \n&gt; So, she would push it into the cave she had fallen so near. \n&gt; \n&gt; Easier said than done.\n\n\n"}}
