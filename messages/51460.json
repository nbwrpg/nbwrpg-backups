Seeing another shot coming from a large tank that had just\n&gt;arrived, he rises higher and avoids the large blast that could have\n&gt;blown him down. The smaller shots however did get to him, and his leg\n&gt;was getting weak. He wouldn&#39;t be able to use that talon for some\n&gt;times.\n&gt;\n&gt;He saw that Skulletron was trying to coordinate with Wolfenstein, and\n&gt;the tank&#39;s arrival made things more complicated. A plan formed in his\n&gt;head.\n&gt;\n&gt;He directed two turrets to concentrate fire on the new bot and follow\n&gt;it. They both unleashed a hellfire of laser beams at him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tyrael: Khan Vlad! Forward and do not stop! We drive them back now!\n&gt;\n&gt;Vlad: Are you certain, Major?\n&gt;\n&gt;The Clanner looked around. The brunt of the enemy opposition was\n&gt;situated on a northeastern frontline from the base. Inferno and\n&gt;Quickstrike were near, but the base defenses could handle the pair.\n&gt;\n&gt;Vlad: I see... (He turned to Inferno) I withdraw my claim on you as my\n&gt;opponent. Forward Tyrael!\n&gt;\n&gt;He turned to Wolfenstein, transformed then used his medium laser on\n&gt;the hairy bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;At the same moment, Tyrael let go another volley of needles on\n&gt;Skulletron, dived down and slashed twice at him with his razor-sharp\n&gt;feathers.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skulletron nods, then he points to Tyrael.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Skulletron:  That&#39;s the bot in charge of the Tripreds.  I need you\n&gt;to go and take his attention, but try not to get hurt.  And please,\n&gt;try to resist aggression, or else this will be harder for me.  Can you\n&gt;do that, comrade?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
