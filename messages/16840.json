He \nheard her voice, but couldn&#39;t make out the words, feeling himself slip slowly \naway. He could feel her face near his, straining to keep his optics activated.\n\nEverything was fading... Prowl&#39;s life was flowing away, his spark about to \njoin the Matrix, when....\n\nHer lips touched his, a new energy surging through him. He couldn&#39;t die now! \nNot now, not in this room, not from just another Alliance battle. If this \nkiss was the only reason to live, it was more than good enough for him.\n\nProwl takes in a sharp breath, his lips still locked with Iron Raptor, as his \nspark releases its repair coils, slithering across his chest to work on the \nworst of the damage. Prowl was fully aware now, aware of Iron Raptor&#39;s lips \non his, of almost every circuit in his body screaming at him with pain. But \nat least he was no longer dying. Prowl was breathing once again, and his arm \nfound its way around Iron Raptor, deepening their kiss.\n\nClosing his optics in pain from moving his arm, Prowl leans his head back, \nopening his optics to look at his one true love.\n\n&quot;I love you,&quot; he whispers, and then goes unconscious, his repair systems \ntaking over. His arm goes limp again, and he relaxes in her arms, but his \nlife signs were stronger than ever...\n\n"}}
