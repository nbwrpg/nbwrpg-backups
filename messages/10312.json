It had been empty for as long as anyone could remember. In \n&gt;it,\n&gt;was scattered old tables, chairs, and lighting equitment. Transanulas used \n&gt;it\n&gt;briefly has a lair, but was discovered and left it. For now it suited her\n&gt;purposes.\n&gt;     Sitting on an old barrle, with her legs crossed and the bowcaster in \n&gt;her\n&gt;lap, Aracnia began the conversation. She was egar for Paralysis to join \n&gt;her,\n&gt;as egar as she was to get Quickstrike and Darkmouse to help her.\n&gt;     &quot;Now, Paralysis, tell me all about yourself. I need to know you if \n&gt;your\n&gt;to be one of my soldiers.&quot; She said cooly.\n&gt;     The toad and taken a seat on a turned over computer consol. His long \n&gt;legs\n&gt;streched out in front of him as he reclined on his elbows. &quot;Well, Im only\n&gt;several hours old, but according to the data tracks im a normal predacon\n&gt;warrior. I can fight and know my way around a computer system. What else is\n&gt;there?&quot;\n&gt;     She noted his cockyness. It was annoying, but attractive. She caught\n&gt;herself feeling that way about him several times already. &quot;I see. Well, are\n&gt;you willing to help me get into power, and unite the two fractions?&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Yes. I&#39;ll help you. What have I got to lose?&quot; He croaked.\n&gt;     Aracnia smiled. Excellent. Things were going very well. &quot;Your help \n&gt;will\n&gt;be rewarded. Now, Im going to introduce you to Darkmouse. Shes a Predacon\n&gt;too, but is under the control of Quickstrike. Quickstrike is ready to help\n&gt;me, and the rodent will follow him. Im going to leave you with the mouse\n&gt;while I go to the bridge to locate this Thunder Hammer person. The more\n&gt;people I have on my side, the better.&quot;\n&gt;     Paralysis nodded and they went to the vault where Darkmouse was being\n&gt;held. The toad held his pistol, ready to fire, as Aracnia opened the cell.\n&gt;     &quot;Well Darkmouse, hello. I want to introduce you to Paralysis. He will \n&gt;be\n&gt;taking you to Quickstrike very soon.&quot; She said, handing a ration of food to\n&gt;the mouse.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes, I look forward to working with such a preety little bot like\n&gt;yourself.&quot; Paralysis said with a toothy smile.\n&gt;     Aracnia shighed and left the two there. She took a lift to the bridge \n&gt;and\n&gt;entered. There, on the scanners was Thunder Hammer. Once agian she departed\n&gt;from the ship to meet him.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
