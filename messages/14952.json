Two of them hit, detonating the grenades in midspace, \nbut the last one goes off by an inch, the grenade hitting the shuttle, \nexploding.\n\nRamulus swears, spinning to look at the shuttle as the grenade hits in the \nside, tearing the plating apart. He runs into the ship, quickly tapping a few \nkeys to bring up a scan of the vessel. He sighs, somewhat in relief: none of \nthe systems were damaged, but there was no way the vessel would survive \nre-entry.\n\nRamulus looks at Fliq. They were stranded on the stinkin&#39; moon, and Fliq \nneeded medical attention!\n\nThe ram swears, turning back to the screens and tapping a few keys.\n\n"}}
