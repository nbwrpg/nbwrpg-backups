He shudders, sliding off the blade \nand rolling down the ramp, his internal repairs taking over as he reverts \ninto Beast Mode, hitting the ground with a dull thud.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus calmly watches Reptilica make his exit from the shuttle, chuckling \nquetly. How these bots treated Reptilica amused him. Reptilica had been \nfairly arrogant when Zardus had first met him, Reptilica could use some more \nof that treatment.\n\n&quot;What about?&quot; he says, his red optics watching the Vok carefully. \n\n"}}
