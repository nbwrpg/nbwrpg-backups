Sorry I didn&#39;t post on the weekend. My dad was hogging \nit, playing his war games. He thinks he&#39;s General Patton, it&#39;s crazy. \nI had about 300 messages to read, and I kinda sped through them so if \nsome stuff is off than please correct me. Also I&#39;ve got some OOC \nthings to say. First off is the Ark. No where in my post did I say \nthe Ark was destroyed. I only said that Savage was shooting \nfireblass, HOPING to destroy it. But it&#39;s too late now since it&#39;s \nbeen a factor for three days. The other is RYO D. I know you&#39;re into \nthe Ninja Thing, and that&#39;s cool, I like it. But you&#39;ve got these \nrules and facts the rest of us don&#39;t know. When I say Lance I mean \nSword. It&#39;s the same thig to me. I know there was a back blast \ncoming, and Prebon was prepared for it. I do things simple and \nwithout detail so that it&#39;s easier to understand. The Ninja Thing is \ncool, but  all those technicalities should be saved for a Ninja RPG.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois woke up to see Battera staring at him. He remembered her from \nthe base, and remembered he hit her. He looked around and saw they \nwere in a cave, and wondered how he got here. He pulled out his gun \nand stuck it to her head.\n\n&quot;Where did you take me, filth?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream tracked down KitKat and walked into the DNA room, needing \nto speak with her.\n\n&quot;Listen KitKat, Arachnia is a fraud. You have to be carefull with \nthis. I was talking to that mouse. When we found her, she was talking \nto Inferno. Now Inferno works for Megatron. But he told her to go and \njoin Black Arachnia. Now why would Inferno tell a bot to join the \nenenmy? He wouldn&#39;t. He would tell a bot to join a group that had a \ntreaty with Megatron. What if Black Arachnia really serves Megatron, \nand wants him to rule all Predacons? What if she&#39;s only joining us to \nsend info on our decisions back to Megatron? Even worse, now that \nyou&#39;ve made the council, she could make sure we make the wrong \ndecisions and fall into Megatrons trap? What if she costs us our \nfreedom?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq watched the Ark be destroyed, all of their work with it.\n\n&quot;No...&quot; said Brix, &quot;Not now. Not after all that trouble going to the \nmoon, Fliq almost dying, me killing Gekkidama to get those parts, ALL \nFOR NOTHING! NO!!!!!&quot; Suddenly a large spark exploded in Brix&#39;s head. \nThe extreme rage he experienced brought his other persona, Bronco, to \na new level. It took control of everything, and wouldn&#39;t even let \nBrix stay in the back. Brix slowly fell into the depths of the sub-\nconsious, and died. Only Bronco remained, and now that he had full \ncontrol, he could do what he wanted. Execpt it caused his own demise.\nIn his deranged state, he whipped his launcher around. When it was \npointed at his feet, he fired, killing him instantly, and sending \nFliq flying. Fliq crawled back to the lifeless body.\n\n&quot;Brix....no&quot;\n\nFliq began to weep.\n\n(When they came back from the moon, I kept thinking what new \nstoryline I coud give them. I&#39;ve been wanting to bring in a new char, \nbut I wanted to even it out by killing one too. So now Brix is dead, \nand Fliq&#39;s story is the whole depression thing. He may even end up \nturning on the Maximals.)\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nTamron took most of the shots, tiny pockets of mech fluid started to \nseep through. He saw the great light rise in the sky, and knew it \neasily. He thought to himself:\n\nUltra Magnus. What a surprise! But there&#39;s no way we can stay here. \nThere are too many opponents. But in destroying the Ark, we have been \ngiven an ace, and we will store it in our sleeve. As I have long \nsuspected, Spears has been held at another Maximal Base. We will \nmonitor these Maximals, and when they send a representitive to the \nbase, we will track it&#39;s course and know where Spears is being held.\n\nHe called out loud:\n\n&quot;Slayer! Savage! Return to base! New plan!&quot;\n\nTamron and Savage took off for the Trainer base.\n\n\n"}}
