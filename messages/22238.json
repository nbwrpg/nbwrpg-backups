He shakes the Predacon&#39;s hand firmly, looking at the bot. If all \nthe Predacons were this small, his team should be treated very well \nindeed...\n\n&quot;As KitKat said, my name is Killfest,&quot; he says politely, while sizing \nthe smaller bot up. He decides that in a fight, DrillBit wouldn&#39;t \nlast a second, &quot;And this is my team,&quot; he points to the different bots \nas he lists them, &quot;EndBringer, Demise, Greven, and Scyther.&quot;\n\nHis team, standing behind him and looking at DrillBit, was very \nunimpressed so far. They had expected bigger bots, but these looked \nlike the colony bots they were so used to butchering. EndBringer and \nGreven looked at DrillBit with half-threatening expressions. Demise \nlooked at the bot with a neutral face; the beast was hungry. Scyther, \nthe only one who was as short as DrillBit (or shorter), had a neutral \nexpression on his face, looking at KitKat&#39;s &#39;right hand bot&#39;.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He gave KitKat a quick questioning glance, at her words.\n&gt; He held out his hand, offering to shake Killfests hand.\n&gt; &quot;Hello.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
