It was not so much that \nhe was damaged, but that the pain was overwhelming.\n\nIn his dreams, however, he saw.\n\nHe had always been closer to his Maximal side. No one could have made \nhim doubt that. Perhaps it was because the Maximals had always been \nthere for him, or that the Predacons he had met were always \ncriminals... One thing was certain, he was almost a true Maximal at \nspark.\n\nAlmost.\n\nNow, what he was seeing was his spark, bright blue, darken, more and \nmore, until it was a deep navy blue. He heard himself scream, but he \nwas not sure if it was out of pain, fear, or anger. He simply \nscreamed.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; WindlorD:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahh Denzabar... do you see that machine&quot;said Winlord qhile he \n&gt; looked a movile scanner &quot;Give it you Kup...
