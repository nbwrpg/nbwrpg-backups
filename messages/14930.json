Paralysis and \nthe others were back at base, but he slipped away. After all, he needed to \nkeep busy and he didnt plan on staying under Aracnias claw forever.\n    While looking for remains of bits of computers, he heard the voice of \nDarkmouse, injured and hurt. He walked over to her, looked around to see if \nanyone was watching, and then licked the mech flowing from her back. It was \ndelicious...pure ecstacy. \n    But he did have to get her back to base. He lifted her up and started \nback for base, inhaling her wonderful smell the entire time.\n\n"}}
