Wel=\r\nl, kind of.  He was thicker and \nwas more armored.  Other than that he was =\r\nthe exact same.\n\n&quot;Lord Unicron, he does not looked that changed.  What did =\r\nyou do to him?&quot;\n\n&quot;Er modernisiert mein defensiv m=F6glichkeiten und hologra=\r\nphisch technologie.&quot; \nTeufel replied, still speaking the Earth language Ger=\r\nman.\n\n&quot;What did he say, Lord Unicron?&quot;\n\n&quot;Teufel explained what I did.  I up=\r\ngraded his defensive capabilities and \nholographic technology.&quot;\n\nWith that,=\r\n Teufel began to glow a bright blue and suddenly he seemed to \nshrink a few=\r\n feet and expand a little, taking the form of Zardus.  In another \nbrief bl=\r\nue glow he was Megatron (BW), and then Soundwave (G1), and then \nOptimus Pr=\r\nime (G1).\n\n&quot;I can even sound like them.&quot; Teufel said, his voice a perfect m=\r\natch of \nOptimus Prime&#39;s and no longer in German.  \n\n&quot;His talents will be V=\r\nERY useful, Vehement.  Teufel, take the form of Zardus \nin case you encount=\r\ner any of his insignificant beings.&quot; as soon as it was \nordered, Teufel did=\r\n it.  &quot;Vehement, you and Teufel will go to coordinates \nKai-Centauri 28, 34=\r\n.  You will have to search, but there is a Cybertronian&#39;s \nhead there.  Ret=\r\nrieve it, and bring it to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot; Vehement said with a small =\r\nbow, which wasn&#39;t easy.\n\n&quot;For the Chaos-Bringer.&quot; Teufel said, still lookin=\r\ng and sounding like Zardus. \n \n\nThe two beings left, heading for the coordi=\r\nnates as Unicron smiled.  He \nstepped up to the Guardian computer and a gol=\r\nden hue tendril wrapped around \nhis head as he interfaced with the most adv=\r\nanced computer on the planet and \npossibly the galaxy. \n\n"}}
