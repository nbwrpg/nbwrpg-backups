For all you know, there could be something that kills all the \npredacons in it with the push of a button. But that would be against the \nrules, so there isn&#39;t. So stop declaring things moding that you have no \nknowledge about.)\n\nBlue Stinger looks over at the Ark. She pushes several buttonson her wrist \nand turns back to fire at Inferno. Somewhere inside the Ark, a secondary \nenergy supply turns on. The computer beeps. &quot;Energy levels at 70% and \nrising,&quot; It says, &quot;Teletran 1 online.&quot; The shields renew their power and the \nautoguns resume their fire with a vengence.\n\nSeveral autoguns destroy some of the Ion disks that Manterror shot at \nAntagony, but the rest hit her. She stumbles back and fires at Manterror \nalong with the autoguns.\n\nKey looks up from where she was sitting on the ground. She sighs. &quot;I have to \nget back to help the maximals. See you around, Firestorm.&quot; She says and \nwalks off into the forest.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
