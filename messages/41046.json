This seems like my school only one persons willing to stand \nup for me or even come within 20 feet of me of he can enjoy it. Are \nyou Ian Howard,and if you are please don&#39;t kill me for giving away \nyour name. I&#39;d like to go with the Alliance,but I can&#39;t without \npermission so for now it&#39;s just going to have to stay a mystery.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; well in Deweys defence he said that a shadowed figure attacked and \nchanted\n&gt; for the Alliance to take credit. Think strategically for a moment, \nyou have\n&gt; two enemies you want weakened, whats the best way to do it? I&#39;m \ntempted to\n&gt; let Phobia take credit for it but he&#39;s a little bug not a shadow \nlike\n&gt; figure.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Abyssian Badass &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, July 22, 2001 8:51 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Carnitrons\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Damn right that the Alliance story is unbelievable!  Like \nthe rules\n&gt; &gt; say, unless you get Zardus&#39; permission for that silly story, the \nAlliance\n&gt; &gt; never did anything to Mustex, Stallex, Rhesus or the Carnitrons.  \nOh, and\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; you really want to write stuff that&#39;s actually worth reading(And \nno, I\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t enjoy your silly little story) then you can always look \nfor some\n&gt; &gt; advice from Jeff, sometimes me, KSL and a few others most \nlikely.  You&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; need to gain a more complex vocabulary and more understanding of \nthings.\n&gt; &gt; Ok, everything I just said probably sounds really weird right \nnow, but\n&gt; jume\n&gt; &gt; it.  Speak up if you really wanna **** with the Abyssian Badass!  \nAnd,\n&gt; &gt; everybody, since there&#39;s a lot of OOCing going on, I suggest you \nbe like\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; and learn to balance OOCing and ICing by putting them both into \none post.\n&gt; &gt; *Speeds off on his Harley* =)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:   Decadel continued to roam the halls and corridors of \nMaximal City.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;           &quot;Errr...must find.....somebody to enslave....soon!&quot; \nDecadel said\n&gt; &gt; to himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Decadel walked on, pondering who he should enslave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
