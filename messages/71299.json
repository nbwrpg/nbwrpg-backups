A podium is set up and there are places for everyone to either stand=\r\n up or sit down as is their want. \n\nAs everyone moved into position, LEGACY=\r\n, LORD ELDER, WINGSABER, SANTON, TORCA and NOCTORRO come in a take position=\r\ns near the podium itself, but it is the bot known as LEO II that comes up t=\r\no take the center of the stage. \n\nHe steps up behind the podium and take a =\r\nmoment to look at the assembled individuals before him. He stands tall and =\r\nproud, the whites and light browns are caught well in the lights. His form =\r\nis strong and well built and in his face you can see the likeness of OPTIMU=\r\nS PRIME himself. Behind him lay the large fallen forms of OPTIMUS and MEGAT=\r\nRON locked, even in death, in the eternal struggle of good versus evil. \n\nA=\r\nnd it is in this back drop that LEO turned to face the assembled mechs and =\r\nbegan to speak. \n\n&quot;Autobots, Maximals!&quot; LEO&#39;s voice is a rich baritone, one=\r\n that easily carried across the room. &quot;I am sure that you have been all won=\r\ndering just what this meeting is about.&quot; He smiled a warm and inviting smil=\r\ne as he looked around the room. &quot;And for those who don&#39;t know me, I am LEO =\r\nand have been named a PRIME by the council of elders on Cybertron.&quot; He paus=\r\ned for a moment for that to take affect and then continued, &quot;and what I hav=\r\ne come here to talk about is Earth, and what we are doing here.&quot; \n\nLEO paus=\r\ned to make sure that everyone was keeping up and then continued, &quot;I have be=\r\nen sent by the high council and have been discussing matters with both Your=\r\n Lord Elder as well as Legacy, both of whom have been instrumental in catal=\r\noging events here on Earth, and what has been found we find disturbing.&quot;\n\nT=\r\nhere was a glance from LORD ELDER to LEO, but it was a nod of agreement, ev=\r\nen from LEGACY there was a very slight nod, his single optic pulsing slight=\r\nly. \n\n&quot;Does anyone here know how many ships have crash landed here on this =\r\nplanet since you have been here?&quot; LEO stopped for a moment as he looked at =\r\nthose in the crowd, his optics turning to look at each of the Maximals and =\r\nAutobots who were present. \n\nThere were some in the audience who tentativel=\r\ny raised a hand and perhaps even a few who raised it with confidence, but m=\r\nost kept their hands down, unsure. \n\n&quot;What ever you think that number is, m=\r\nultiply it several times.&quot; LEO PRIME&#39;s words were frim and full of convitio=\r\nn, &quot;You have to factor in the Predacons and Decepticons that have crash lan=\r\nded here too, and then there are the ships that crashed and had no survivor=\r\ns and so may have not been reported, and of course the largest one that cra=\r\nsh landed into the ocean.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME paused for a moment again to let that=\r\n fact sink in and then he spoke. &quot;Most of these ships contained alien miner=\r\nals, alien metals and alien technologies, objects that have no business bei=\r\nng here on this planet at this time.&quot; \n\nGesturing at the audience LEO PRIME=\r\n asked another question, &quot;Does anyone care to hazard a guess at how many to=\r\nns of it are here on the Earth now?&quot; \n\nHe paused again to look at the audie=\r\nnce, fewer raising their hands. \n\n&quot;Or how about the last time there was som=\r\ne major battle and you blew off a piece of someone&#39;s armor, or they lost a =\r\nweapon, or perhaps that happened to you?&quot; \n\nLEO PRIME&#39;s optic&#39;s brightened =\r\nas he went on, &quot;Has anyone noticed that the humanoids on the planet are beg=\r\ninning to learn from us, learning how to use tools and communicate ideas at=\r\n a faster rate than they historical should have?&quot;\n\nSlamming his hands down =\r\non the podium he continued in a stronger voice, &quot;Mechs we are having an imp=\r\nact on this planet, one that we should not be having. The humans have to pr=\r\noceed unmolested on a planet that is supposed to be in a pristine condition=\r\n when they inherit it. There should be no leftover smog from our smelting o=\r\nf ore, and it should not be being deprived of the very minerals that the hu=\r\nmans will need to survive. It should not be seeded with technologies that h=\r\numans should not be able to fathom for another several million years, and w=\r\ne definitely should not be having cities here, complete with internal crime=\r\n and slums.&quot;\n\nLEO straightened as he looked over his audience to be sure th=\r\nat he still had their attention. He nodded at the affect that he had. &quot;YES,=\r\n we have to stop Unicron and his minions! And YES, we have to round up the =\r\nPredacons and other assorted criminals that are still running around on thi=\r\ns planet. More of which seem to be arriving daily.&quot; \n\nGesturing at the audi=\r\nence again LEO sighed, &quot;But we cannot make the Earth our permanent living q=\r\nuarters, at least not yet. We have reports of civilians here, setting up sh=\r\nop . . . setting up families.&quot; He paused again to look at the audience, &quot;Th=\r\nis planet belongs to the humans and the other animals that live here, not u=\r\ns. We do not have the right!&quot; \n\nLEO PRIME leaned into the audience, &quot;If we =\r\ncontinue on the course that we are now, we are no better than the Predacons=\r\n who take what they want. We are Maximals and Autobots, we are better than =\r\nthat. We are here to defend it, but this planet, this place, it is not our =\r\nhome, and we cannot, through our desire to defend it turn it into one, nor =\r\ncan we allow the Predacons to do so either.&quot;\n\nHe straightened, &quot;It is time =\r\nfor a change.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
