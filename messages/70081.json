My apologies if I missed it)\n\nBIC:\n\nAs Quickstride and Rat Trap continue their surveillance of Hydras&#39;\nbase, from above their position a rather large sensor blip began to be\nmade out. Distant at first but quickly approaching from above.\n\nThe energy signature is strange, reading something similar to\nCyclonus&#39; and Scourge&#39;s signature, it reads as both Decepticon and\nUnicronian. As the signature approaches it can be discerned that it is\nnot one large one but three individuals flying in close formation.\n\nAs they continue their approach the single signature becomes three\nseparate signatures, two jets, a black one on the left and a red and\nwhite one on the right, and at the center, leading them is what would\nappear at this distance to be something similar to a flying weapons\nplatform of some sort.\n\nTheir target would appear to be Hydras&#39; base, although at this point\nthey are still small but growing shapes in the skies.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
