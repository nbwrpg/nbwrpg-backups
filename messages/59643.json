It was clear that the time was\nright for him to reveal his past to the Maximals on\nthis planet. After all, the time for his secrecy ended\nwith the Great War.\n\n&quot;Of course I remember him. Everyone, maybe It&#39;s about\ntime I give you an idea of some of the history of\nCybertron that has never been told. The reason you\nhaven&#39;t heard it before is because that was how I\nwished it to be, and the result of Alpha Trion\nrespecting my wishes. To give you an idea of my age, I\nwas the last of the original Decepticons to be created\nby the Quintessons....&quot;\n\nFor the next ten minutes he went on to tell them about\nhow the Quintessons had originally constructed him to\nbe the ultimate piece of assassination/espoinage\nhardware and how there was a glitch in his programming\nthat made him wish to fight with honour, which he&#39;d\njust learned was by the hand of Primus himself. How\njust as the quintessons had been about to deactivate\nand mindwipe him, Alpha trion had saved him when the\ncompund he was in during the Great uprising.\n\nHe then went on to tell them of the years before the\nrise of Megatron, when Alpha Trion had used his keen\nmind to train him as an excellent scientist and\ndoctor, and how he and Alpha Trion had come up with\nthe refit process to upgrade the Autobots into a force\nthat could handle the Decepticons. How he decided to\nfight the very members of his race because he believed\nthey had betrayed their initial purpose of being\nprotectors of the Autobots, using his body for what it\nwas meant for and fighting a one bot intel and\nsabotage war against the Decepticons on Cybertron,\nmaking Alpha Trion swear to keep his existence a\nsecret. How when Cybertron totally fell to the\nAutobots, he appeared out of the shadows and joined\nthem as a double agent for the Autobots.\n\nHe then told them of his post great war years on one\nof the exploration missions where he met his mate who\nhelped him to heal from the past, how they&#39;d spawned 3\nchildren, among them Rattrap. How Megatron 2 had\nattacked their base and slaughtered everyone but\nRatrap while he was out on a scouting mission. How\nhe&#39;d sworn vengence on Megatron after stowing Rattrap\ninto a CR Chamber and activating a distress signal,\nthen becoming obsessed with destroying him to the\npoint of stowing away on the Axalon. \n\nHow when he&#39;d arrived, after an unsuccessful attempt\nto destroy him during his first  battle against the\nPredacons, he&#39;d retrieved the Matrix in an attempt to\nuse its power to destroy Megatron, only to be saved by\nformer leaders, mainly his old friend Alpha Trion, and\nthen been Optimised into Shadimus Prime. How after a\nrocky reunion between him and Rattrap, he&#39;d managed to\nmend thier bridges, and finally how he&#39;d given his\nlife in a valiant attempt to destroy the weapon\nsystems of the Nemesis during Megatron&#39;s final crazed\nattack on the Ark.\n\nAnd finally how Primus had ressurected his spark and\nBody, revealing that he was originally chosen by\nPrimus to be a guardian for his children, and how he&#39;d\nbeen sent back to protect his children from Unicron.\n\n \n --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nBlackfang was taken by surprise for a moment.
