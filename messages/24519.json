Magmatron controls you Cybershark?  No need to \nworry.  The \n&gt;   first thing we&#39;ll do is go to the Destrons.  We&#39;ll convince them \nof peace and \n&gt;   that you should have freedom from control of Magmatron at the \nsame time.  Bu \n&gt;   tbefore we do anything in the way of peace, we must return to my \nmountain \n&gt;   lair.  I dont think this cave would be good for a base, not to \nmention that \n&gt;   we are dangerously close to the Alliance. \n&gt;   ::He walks out of the cave and takes off flying in the direction \nof his old \n&gt;   lair, motioning them to follow him::\n\n\n"}}
