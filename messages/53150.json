The only light was coming from a small office on the far end of the room.  He wondered why the light was on, so he went to investigate.\n\nAs he passed between large containers of non-distinct objects; he began to become aware that he was being watched.  One, because of the light, Two, because of his paranoid reflexes, three, because he had a targeting laser go accross his face several times.  Celeron hit the deck and crouched under the edge of a container that had fallen over.\n\nCeleron armed his favorte weapon: his arm gun.  It made a little whineing sound and he raised it to a ready position.\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s there?!?&quot; cried an unfriendly voice.\n\n&quot;....&quot;  Celeron had no intention of speaking.\n\n&quot;Come out now; or I&#39;ll be forced to blow this whole place to bits&quot;\n\n&quot;....&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be....&quot;\n\nSome faint footsteps began to grow louder behind him to the far right corner of the room.\n\n&quot;Your gonna regret this.&quot;\n\nThe voice and the footsteps were coming from opposite directions!  Celeron began making a plan.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nGet 25MB, POP3, Spam Filtering with LYCOS MAIL PLUS for $19.95/year.\nhttp://login.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus&ref=lmtplus\n\n"}}
