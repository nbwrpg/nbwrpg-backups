Under normal circumstances, a transformer&#39;=\r\ns spark would\n&gt; merely be\n&gt; &gt; extinguished after its energy dropped to a le=\r\nvel where the spark\n&gt; could no\n&gt; &gt; longer maintain cohesion.  However it ap=\r\npeared that someone had\n&gt; &gt; intentionally routed an energy conduit directly=\r\n from her mouth \nright\n&gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; battery-like object next to her spark; =\r\nallowing her to feast on \nother&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; sparks to keep her own intact.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Whether this had been done as a temporary measure to keep her \nalive,\n&gt; =\r\nor as a\n&gt; &gt; means to make her kill, and kill often; the Bushido Predecons \n=\r\ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; sustain her needs for energy even if they emptied all the pris=\r\nons \nin the\n&gt; &gt; Valley Mine Pentatron.  Celeron estimated that she would ha=\r\nve had \nto eat\n&gt; &gt; approximately one spark every two days and that the batt=\r\nery could\n&gt; sustain a\n&gt; &gt; charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little =\r\nover a week or\n&gt; about 200\n&gt; &gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill ag=\r\nain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *From the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; &gt; 1. He would fi=\r\nrst need to generation some sort of substitute \nenergon\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; to feed=\r\n into her spark so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other people&#39;s\n&gt; sparks and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n he could keep her well-fed while he tried to come up with a \nsolution.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 2. He would eventually need to figure out where this leak was and\n&gt; repair=\r\n it;\n&gt; &gt; then finally removing the conduits that allowed her to eat sparks =\r\n\nin the\n&gt; &gt; first place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He had never done surgery, but it didn&#39;t =\r\nreally bother him that he\n&gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; working on a living being.  Perhap=\r\ns he might even have the time \nto make\n&gt; &gt; some, &quot;enhancements&quot; to her desi=\r\ngn, that is, if Kratos would let\n&gt; him.  He\n&gt; &gt; typed up all this data and =\r\nsent it to Kratos.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Celeron to Kratos, I have determined that I ne=\r\ned to perform \nsurgery\n&gt; on our\n&gt; &gt; hungry friend.  I wanted to make sure t=\r\nhat it was alright if I\n&gt; operated on\n&gt; &gt; her.  I am sending a report to yo=\r\nu now,&quot; he said, realizing that \nhe\n&gt; probably\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t really need permi=\r\nssion to do anything, but he always \nthought\n&gt; it wise\n&gt; &gt; to respect the l=\r\neader.  &quot;Also, I was wondering if you would be\n&gt; interested in\n&gt; &gt; me addin=\r\ng some devices and weapons to her frame after I correct \nthe\n&gt; problem\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwith her spark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Dec 2, 2007 5:56 PM, Nic &lt;w=\r\narriorazure@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Creep was still.
