Megatron will be RPed my me, and \nJonathan will be covering the Maximal leader, whom he hasn&#39;t decided \non yet. The Maximal base is going to be located to the right of the \nRockies, just above the US/Canada border (it didn&#39;t crash into the \nmountain, beside it). The Predacon base is going to be located in \nmideastern South America. Anyone having problems with the base \nlocation can email me, adn we&#39;ll see what we can do.\n\nTF:TM ROCKS, G1 ROCKS, G2 ROCKS. I liked BW for how well the CG was \nconsidering how little money they had (for the most part). =)\n\nI&#39;m going to move everyone&#39;s characters into a temp folder, then \ncreate new folders for everyone. If you have chars created already, \nI suggest you copy them out of there soon. Unless you feel like \nrewriting them again. I figure that that is the best way to clean it \nall up. Although it&#39;s still going to take a while, better than \nmoving each character&#39;s file individually. I&#39;ll update the rules \npage sometime in the next week or so (hopefully).\n\nLast thing for now, Dewboy suggested that we add something onto the \nname as we are restarting, and it will be slightly different from \nthe original. It&#39;ll be in this form:\n\nNBWPRG:&lt;enter suggestion&gt;\n\nSo email me your suggestions, then we can have a vote or something \non the name that most like.\n\n\n"}}
