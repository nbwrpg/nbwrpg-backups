In l=\r\nine with that\nUPROAR suggested a decoy team and RAT TRAP talked of a recon =\r\nteam. At\nthe same time  STRAIGHT SHOT  was thinking about a weapons assault=\r\n\nteam and QUICKSTRIDE was thinking of a field advance team.\n\nLEO PRIME turn=\r\ned as WINDLORD spoke of Insulating the Ark and even\nremoving the Predacons =\r\nby brute force. He said nothing as KUP came\nback with the fact that that wa=\r\nsn=92t the Maximal=92s style. For the\nmoment he let the comments come, even=\r\n the one from TALON about\nremoving every piece of evidence of their presenc=\r\ne.\n\n=93We do not know if the Nemesis would have to be removed, but the rest=\r\n,\nthe other additions that we have made to this planet would need to be\nrem=\r\noved, yes.=94\n\nAnd then WHEELIE walked in . . .\n\nLEO PRIME=92s face darkene=\r\nd somewhat, whether this was fear, chagrin,\nsurprise or a crazed mergance o=\r\nf the three it was difficult to tell.\nThis particular expression was mirror=\r\ned to a lesser degree by TORCA,\nNOCTORRO and WINGSABER, but they each said =\r\nnothing as they just looked\nat LEO.\n\nDuring LEO PRIME=92s pause, WHEELIE=92=\r\ns particular charm makes it though\nthe ranks of the Maximals, some of which=\r\n causes some of them to try to\nleave.\n\nLEO paused and nodded to WHEELIE, =\r\n=93Welcome . . . Wheelie . . . didn=92t\nwe . .  uh . . . =94 He said after =\r\na stuttered pause. He seemed like he\nwas going to say something more to him=\r\n, perhaps about the fact that he\nwas suppose to be at the shuttle guarding =\r\nit . . . locked in securely.\nbut then as if he remembered he was up in fron=\r\nt of a full meeting\nreturned his attention to the crowd at large.\n\n=93Mech=\r\n=92s and Femmes.=94 He said, his voice resuming a measure of\nprofessionalis=\r\nm. =93You have all given many different ideas and\nsuggestions, but there ar=\r\ne also things for us to think about.=94\n\nHe took a moment to look at the di=\r\nfferent ones present an inviting\nsmile curving upon his lips, =93However do=\r\nes anyone know just where the\nUnicronians are yet?=94 LEO turned to look at=\r\n the others in the room,\n=93Or what are their current goals and strategies?=\r\n=94 There was no anger\nor a putting of anyone down as he spoke, just helpin=\r\ng them to see\npoints. =93Does anyone know who even is in charge of their pe=\r\nople, or\neven how many of them are on Earth?=94\n\nHe turned to a different g=\r\nroup, =93What about the Predacons. They are\ncriminals. But I don=92t think =\r\neven =96they- would want to endanger their\nfuture.=94 LEO PRIME gestured at=\r\n the door of the ARK, =93Remember during\nthe battle, Hydras commanded that =\r\nOptimus Prime and Megatron not be\nhurt or hit. Perhaps he can be reasoned w=\r\nith.=94\n\nLEO PRIME turned to the audience to see what their reaction would =\r\nbe\nto his suggestions. LEO was not commanding this, but looking for a\nrespo=\r\nnse.\n\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
