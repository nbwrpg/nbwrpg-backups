Under normal circumstances, a transformer&#39;s spark would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merely be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished after its energy dropped to a level where the spark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer maintain cohesion. However it appeared that someone had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intentionally routed an energy conduit directly from her mouth right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; battery-like object next to her spark; allowing her to feast on\n&gt; other&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sparks to keep her own intact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether this had been done as a temporary measure to keep her alive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means to make her kill, and kill often; the Bushido Predecons\n&gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustain her needs for energy even if they emptied all the\n&gt; prisons in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Valley Mine Pentatron. Celeron estimated that she would have had\n&gt; to eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximately one spark every two days and that the battery could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sustain a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little over a week or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *From the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. He would first need to generation some sort of substitute energon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to feed into her spark so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other people&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparks and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he could keep her well-fed while he tried to come up with a\n&gt; solution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. He would eventually need to figure out where this leak was and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repair it;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then finally removing the conduits that allowed her to eat\n&gt; sparks in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He had never done surgery, but it didn&#39;t really bother him that he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on a living being. Perhaps he might even have the time\n&gt; to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some, &quot;enhancements&quot; to her design, that is, if Kratos would let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typed up all this data and sent it to Kratos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Celeron to Kratos, I have determined that I need to perform surgery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hungry friend. I wanted to make sure that it was alright if I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operated on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her. I am sending a report to you now,&quot; he said, realizing that he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t really need permission to do anything, but he always thought\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it wise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to respect the leader. &quot;Also, I was wondering if you would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me adding some devices and weapons to her frame after I correct the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with her spark.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 2, 2007 5:56 PM, Nic &lt;warriorazure@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Creep was still.
