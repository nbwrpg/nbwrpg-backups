It gives them certain atributes of these creatures, (Meat\neaters still eat meat, plant eaters still eat plants.Same could be said for\nthier strengths and weaknesses.)\n\nOptimus Prime said he would leave till the day when all was one. Veratis\nbelieves that this means combining DNA along with Maximal and Predacon forms\nto create one type of being. Once that happens he believes that Prime will\nreturn to them.\n\nLady Hawk has been given the assignment to create some warriors that\ntransform into creatures similar to the movie &quot;Aliens.&quot; She wants to use\nthis opportunity to test her fathers theory and combine Earth DNA with these\ncreatures to improve them.\n\nany more questions?\n\n\n"}}
