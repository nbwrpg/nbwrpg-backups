As they walk Tumult =\r\nhas \nbeen\n&gt; speaking into his radio, his voice much too low to be understoo=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before long they came out into a clearing, and before them stands a=\r\n\n&gt; female minion looking at some device and a much larger mech that \ncould\n=\r\n&gt; only be Deepstryke.\n&gt; \n&gt; The female is predominantly crimson red with ebo=\r\nny black at her\n&gt; shoulders and hips. She is obviously a jet in her alt mod=\r\ne, as her\n&gt; slender midriff bore the distinctive outline of a nosecone. Her=\r\n face\n&gt; and forearms are alabaster white, with fin like protrusions of the =\r\n\nsame\n&gt; hue flowing off of her helm.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked up at the duo as they =\r\nentered, locking gazes with\n&gt; Nightstrike and Darkfate. Her demeanor was cu=\r\nrious and yet strangely\n&gt; aggressive, her humorless smile she displayed onl=\r\ny accentuated this.\n&gt; Her optics were deep and penetrating as she stared at=\r\n them, her head\n&gt; tilting slightly. For a moment it was as if she saw not j=\r\nust them, \nbut\n&gt; something more, something only she could see about them. B=\r\nut then \nthe\n&gt; moment passed as her smile faded and she returned to looking=\r\n at the\n&gt; device she had been studying before they came up.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other =\r\nfigure that stood here was truly massive. He stood nearly\n&gt; head and should=\r\ners taller then most mechs, with huge shoulders, and\n&gt; powerful limbs. He w=\r\nas colored primarily in gunmetal grey armor, \nwith\n&gt; red at his large shoul=\r\nders, and splashes of it at his faceplate. He\n&gt; looked something like a see=\r\nker on steroids! He had what appeared to \nbe\n&gt; a nosecone at his chest, but=\r\n his frame was far more thickly armored\n&gt; then any seeker. Cannons were mou=\r\nnted on his back, as well extending\n&gt; from his shoulders extending along ea=\r\nch bicep, while on his chest\n&gt; appeared to be rocket or missile launchers.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to look at the female next to him, his face dour and hard,\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Phobia, you have the information yet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The red and black femme next =\r\nto him snapped alert and looked \nover, &quot;Yes\n&gt; sir, I have something.&quot; She g=\r\nlanced back at her device and then \nback at\n&gt; Deepstryke, &quot;It has taken som=\r\ne time to make sense of the neural \nupload\n&gt; Nightrazor sent us of Hot Rod,=\r\n but I do believe we have a location \nof\n&gt; what they&#39;re looking for.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nDeepstryke nodded, &quot;Does it match the original location Cyclonus \nsent\n&gt; us=\r\n?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia nodded as Deepstryke&#39;s head snapped around to look at \n&gt; Ni=\r\nghtstrike and darkfate, his look long and penatrating, &quot;What do \nyou\n&gt; know=\r\n of the original Ark the fell to earth, and of the Optimus Prime\n&gt; that hel=\r\nd the matrix?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n____________=\r\n__________________________________________________________\n______________\n&gt;=\r\n Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
