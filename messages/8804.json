I have been \nbrought on-line a few days ago, and I knew I was a Predacon! \n&gt; \n&gt;   The image of the forest leaked out of her mind and set across the \nminds of the near-by bots. After that, she looked at the small male \nbot in Stingtra&#39;s arms. There was something about him that lured her. \nShe shook her head and pinned her ears.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Wake him up, she said to Stingtra.

I will. I am Predacon, it is only fitting. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; She looked at Quickstrike.

His eyes were still open, but nothing was going on inside. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Where did you find him? she asked. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------\n------------- \n&gt;   &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------\n------------- \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------\n------------- \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n&gt;   Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n\n\n"}}
