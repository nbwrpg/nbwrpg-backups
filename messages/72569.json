But seriously, when Yoketron&#39;s death gets\n&gt; back ta the big guy, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s gonna be too happy. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot fights hard to keep composed for the cause.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh he won&#39;t be happy, I know my brother.  And since it was Dinobot who\n&gt; blurted out the truth, I think he should be the one ta tell him.  Then HE\n&gt; can experience first hand what it will be like having extinction flash in\n&gt; front of his face.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turns to Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just a little payback for disobeying your command and disrespect of your\n&gt; authority.  And a little lesson learned about trying to antagonize a group\n&gt; that is desperately attempting an alliance to deal with a greater enemy.\n&gt; But that&#39;s up to you of course, just a suggestion.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; She sits up on Quickstride&#39;s back as he gallops into action.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Trust me!

If we canot work together as a group, then I can assure\n&gt; you we will certainly die as one.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEO turned to look at the jungle, &quot;Maximals . . .&quot; He paused and then\n&gt; added, &quot; and Predacons . . .
