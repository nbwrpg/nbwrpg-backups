She walked over to HotRod. &quot;They aren&#39;t going to talk.  I \nthink we need someone else to talk to them.&quot;\n\nSpitfire::\nShe walked up to HotRod and Savanna.\n&quot;OK, your way hasn&#39;t worked.&quot; pointing to Savanna.\n&quot;My way hasn&#39;t worked. And HotRod&#39;s approach didn&#39;t have any effect.  \nI think we should just head to the ship and regroup.&quot;\n\nSavanna::\n&quot;I got another idea. Why don&#39;t we try to head to the Ark and beat \nthese guys to the ship?&quot;\n\nSpitfire::\n&quot;Because that would mean the Cybertron Fire would be unguarded then.&quot;\n\nSavanna:: \nShe turned to HotRod, &quot;Whom do you have on the Cybertron Fire now to \nprotect it? If there is at least one bot on duty, then we can go to \nthe Ark and put up a defence there.&quot; \n\nSpitfire::\n&quot;Hmm, I think Savanna has a point.  The bots at the Ark may need help \nwith those guys.  What do yo think HotRod?&quot;\n\nBoth girls looked at HotRod. After all, he was the commanding officer \nin the group at the moment.\n\n\n"}}
