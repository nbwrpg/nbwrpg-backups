It basically brings a person&#39;s greatest fears to the surface.\nIE if your character is afraid of clowns, then the enemies might start\nto look like clowns temporarilly. Another affect it could have is\ncreate a temporary phobia. Maybe fear of open places, fear of\nlightning (Which would probrably be fear of these explosions here in\nbattle). It&#39;s up to you, be creative!\n\nIt&#39;s only temporary. :)\n\nPreston.\n\n"}}
