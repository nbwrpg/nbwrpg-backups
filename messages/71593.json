I know it may not list EVERY character, but it hits\nmost. And generally a mega is bigger than a Deluxe and a Deluxe bigger\nthan a basic although there may be some exceptions. I do believe Rat\nTrap made it to Deluxe as a TM, but never got any taller.\n\nI can start:\n\nRodimus Prime, being a Prime should be the same size as Optimus which\nwould make him an Ultra.\n\nCyclonus I would make the same size, since at times he was drawn as\nbig or even bigger than Galvatron and comparable to Ultra Magnus. So\nhe would be leader sized.\n\nScourge is somewhat smaller and would be a Mega\nDeepstryke would be a mega\nPhobia and Black Razor would be Deluxes.\nLord Elder, as he is based on K9 would be a Deluxe.\n\nAs suggestions:\n\nTuscon = Ultra\nHydras = Ultra\nNightshift = Mega or more likely Deluxe\nStraight Shot = Basic\nQuickstride = Deluxe\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
