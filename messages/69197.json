I do not know how \ngood Megatron&#39;s sensors ar=\r\ne if they would be able to perceive him \nthrough all the tonnage of rock be=\r\ntween them rock? I will leave that \nup to you. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, what I do nee=\r\nd to know from Airly is where exactly is \nHydras&#39; base? I assumed it was on=\r\n the contenant of America since they \nwere so quickly able to get to Portla=\r\nnd, Oregon - Where the Ark is? \nbut I could be wrong. Also what condition i=\r\ns the Black Fortress in? \nSeeing as it just withstood an attack by ALOT of =\r\nsweeps before they \nredirected themselves to the Ark. \n&gt; \n&gt; It would help m=\r\ne in my next posts as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
