She smiled at him with all\nthe warmth in her spark. &quot;Shhhh, don&#39;t talk about things now. Just now\nthat...no matter what, we will always be together, in battle, in base\ncamp. No matter where the Matrix takes us, I will be there.&quot; She\nlooked lovingly into his optics. Her optics flashed for a moment as\nher protocol programs reminded her of something. &quot;THE BOT! Oh no. I\nforgot the mission we&#39;re on.&quot; She was still in his arms, but that look\nof self frustration and mild self irritation at one that has let\nthemselves get caught up in the moment, showed on her face plates. She\nlooked up at him with a pink tint in her face plates. &quot;Uh, well, erhm,\neh heh. Well, we can stay here a moment or two longer, but at some\npoint we still have to answer that beacon. Or else they&#39;ll send a\nsearch party out for us too.&quot;  She kind of smirked at the thought.\n&quot;And I can imagine where they&#39;d find us. Under a rock no doubt.&quot;  She\nsmiled up at him. &quot;But then again, that may not be a bad thing.&quot; with\na slight chuckle. \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice::\n&gt;  \n&gt; He held her tight to him, parting with her felt like it would kill\nhim.  She parted her lips from his for a breif moment to tell him\nsomething he already knew, that she loved him.  She then kissed him\nharder than before, and he could only reciprocate again, words failing\nhis processors.  He tried to match her passion, putting all that he\nwas into the moment.  He parted his lips from hers breifly, his voice\na whisper as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I love you too, and when we get back to base, I&#39;m going to sort\nthis all out properly,&quot; he said, resting his forehead against hers.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
