Can I count on you to\n&gt; &gt; keep an eye on her though? I don&#39;t want her to get in any kind of\n&gt; &gt; troubles.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; Empath laughs.  &quot;I can sense her wherever she goes, just\n&gt;like anyone else.  However, right now I have another concern which\n&gt;also needs attending to.&quot;  Transforming to robot mode, she walks over\n&gt;to Windlord.  &quot;Would you mind accompanying me on a little trip,\n&gt;honey?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN.
