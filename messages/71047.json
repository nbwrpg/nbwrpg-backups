Uproar crouches \nto avoid the debris.\n\n&quot; Son of a glitch! GRRRRR!  NO ONE MESSES WITH THE ARK AND GETS AWAY WITH \nIT! WHY DON&#39;T YOU HAUL YOUR COCKY AFT OUT HERE AND FACE US LIKE A REAL \nWARRIOR!&quot;\n\nQuickstride snorts.\n\n&quot;Yeah, quit hidn&#39; behind your little fire crackers &#39;n fight like real bots!&quot;\n\nUproar raises a brow.\n\n&quot;Heeey, wait a minute, Leo ll, Wind Caliber, I got an idea.  Cover your \nnoses, this might get stinky.  Hey, Quickstride, eat any bean pods lately?&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises a brow, and transforms into his beast mode.\n\n&quot;As a matter of fact, I did.  And a lot of &#39;em.  Stand back fellas, stay \ndown wind, and try not ta breathe any of this in.  We&#39;re about ta stink out \nthe biggest stinker in this place!&quot;\n\nHe turns his rump in the direction of where the intruder is, and releases \nhis stink attack.\n\nMeanwhile, on the way back to the Ark, Tucson gets Rodimus&#39;s report.  He is \nnot happy with what he hears.  Almost immediately, his temper begins to \nescalate.\n\n&quot; NO, NO, NO, NOOOO!  NO ONE DISTURBS THE ARK!  NO ONE!\n\nHis engine rumbles with the power of his anger.  It gives him just enough \npower to start his engine.\n\nRat Trap gasps.\n\n&quot;Woah, easy Wheels...  Guys, ya better let those harnesses go, Wheels isn&#39;t \nin a really good mood...&quot;\n\nNight Shift notices the change in his leader.\n\n&quot;Ohh scrap, he&#39;s right!  Guys, he&#39;s got his engines up!  We can drop the \nharnesses!&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s engine roars back to life, yet he doesn&#39;t take off in a mad dash as \nof yet.\n\n&quot; THE ARK IS IN PERRIL!

I WANT THAT \nENEMY IMMOBILIZED AND BROUGHT TO ME UPON MY ARRIVAL! THEY WANT TORMENT?! \nI&#39;LL SHOW THEM TORMENT!&quot;\n\nRat Trap sits back, hear thumping a mile a minute.\n\n&quot; Ohh boy Talon, he&#39;s ticked...  No telln&#39; what&#39;s gonna happen when he gets \nback ta the Ark now..&quot;\n\nIt was clear, if there was any temper left in Tucson, he had just lost it \ncompletely.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK\n&gt;\n&gt; As Uproar and Quickstride follow Leo II and Wing Caliber up towards the\n&gt; bridge, the trip is nothing if not dark and silent. There is virtually no\n&gt; sound, except for the small sounds that the four themselves make as they\n&gt; walked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Leo II and Wing Caliber both seem adept at walking soundlessly, staying\n&gt; close to the shadows, but in this oppressive silence, even their footfalls\n&gt; could be heard at times, magnified by the echoing in the halls.\n&gt;\n&gt; As they approach the bridge, the door actually slid open as the get \n&gt; close â€“\n&gt; apparently even if the rest of the ship is without power, the bridge still\n&gt; has it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Screens line the walls as Leo II, Wing Caliber, Quickstride and Uproar \n&gt; walk\n&gt; on the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Where is the intruder.&quot; Leo II growled under his breath. He also sniffed\n&gt; the air looking for any trace of him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wing Caliber walked over to one of the console, &quot;Sir look!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Leo II walked over to see what Wing Caliber was pointing at. And there on\n&gt; the screen was the image of the front bay where the inert forms of Optimus\n&gt; Prime and Megatron as well as the other Autobots and Decepticons were\n&gt; laying. However in the corner of the screen there was a timed count down \n&gt; of\n&gt; 2 minutes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s a bomb!&quot; Caliber said. &quot;We have to get back to the main chamber, \n&gt; now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It was only then that there was a quiet chuckle from the corner as a dark\n&gt; figure stepped from the shadows. It was difficult to tell, but he looked\n&gt; like one of the old seekers, like Thundercracker or Skywarp, although his\n&gt; marking were somewhat different. He was shrouded in dark blacks and \n&gt; purples\n&gt; and about the same size as any other Predacon or Maximal. &quot;No, you won&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt; he said, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;You will stay here and watch\n&gt; your friends, and your entire world go up in flames!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a dark chuckle as the figure disappeared and the doors to the\n&gt; bridge opened and then closed, to be followed closely by a small \n&gt; detonation\n&gt; on the door!\n&gt;\n&gt; It was locked, permanently!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita nodded, it was time to be brave, hunt the Predacon could wait; she\n&gt; opened her tiny com link and call her dad&quot;Daddy!!!! Someone hurted Uncle\n&gt; Elder... He need Cr or Medic bay...He has fell unconceus... he looks very\n&gt; bad&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita get&#39;s an answering call from Rodimus, &quot;You just stay put little one \n&gt; I\n&gt; am on the way to you now. Try to keep Lord Elder out of sight until I get\n&gt; there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as Rodimus spoke, almost as if he could hear them speak about him \n&gt; Lord\n&gt; Elder groaned and moved slightly, but did not regain consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This was a... Emotional lapsus, dont expect to wacth a lot&quot;said coldly\n&gt; Perceptor but then his voice was tunned with a slight pride&quot;Above all my\n&gt; creations, the BlackFortress was the greatest&quot;and added with a more cold\n&gt; tone&quot;But sometimes... Sacrifies are needed&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon and Bump looked at each other and then shrugged a small smile on\n&gt; their faces.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Of course.&quot; Legacy said in cold tones. He turned to regard the ex \n&gt; Predacon\n&gt; scientist, &quot;However there may yet be time to construct another, perhaps\n&gt; putting it to better use this time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ON THE WAY BACK TO THE ARK\n&gt;\n&gt; The trip back is longer then any of them had anticipated. Having to carry\n&gt; and pull the large bulk of Tuscon back to the base was not the fastest \n&gt; mode\n&gt; of travel.\n&gt;\n&gt; However there did not seem to be any opposition either. There was no hint \n&gt; of\n&gt; Predacon or Decepticon energy signature to be felt. Not a single wrong \n&gt; smell\n&gt; and or anything out of the ordinary, except the feeling of being watched.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Tuscon] now turns his com link on to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson, I need to know the status\n&gt; &gt; of the situation at the Ark, over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; voice crackled as it came over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;We are inside the\n&gt; Ark now. I have just been told that Lord Elder is damaged. We are on our \n&gt; way\n&gt; to him now.&quot; There was a pause and then Rodimus continued, &quot;Leo II, Wing\n&gt; Caliber, Uproar and Quickstride went to the bridge to check things out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a small sound over the radio, &quot;Slag!&quot; Rodimus said after a \n&gt; moment.\n&gt; &quot;That sounded like a small explosion coming from the bridge. I&#39;ll get back\n&gt; to you.&quot; Rodimus signed off.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile as the group continued to trek back towards the Ark, high above,\n&gt; barely in sight range a large dark form moved swiftly through the skies. \n&gt; It\n&gt; was like a dark cloud that for a moment obscured the sun. It was not quite \n&gt; a\n&gt; bird and more than some dinosaur. However even at this range its shape was\n&gt; easily recognizable â€“ a DRAGON!\n&gt;\n&gt; As quickly as it came it continued to move away towards the north and then\n&gt; east, its attention apparently on something else as if disregarding the\n&gt; Autobots and Maximals on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; For a moment it could be made out that the figure was carrying two other\n&gt; dark forms, the forms hanging in wicked clawed talons. However their\n&gt; identities remained unknown as the figure quickly moved further and \n&gt; further\n&gt; away, an occasional wing flap propelling it to faster and faster speeds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I detected Minion in that thing.&quot; Bantor said.\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca grunted, &quot;We had better get back to the Ark quickly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With a nod they continued to pull Tuscon west, back towards the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
