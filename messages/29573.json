No doomsday devices or death\nrays or cloaking devices or ANY SPECIAL GIZMOS worth\ntaking. It will in no way turn the tide of your little\nwar here. It&#39;s a standard ordinary Decepticon shuttle\narmed with plain, standard issue blasters. The\nshuttles themselves were indended as a plot device, a\nprop, nothing more.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
