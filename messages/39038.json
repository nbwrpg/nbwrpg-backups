Part of\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mustelidae family, a carnivorous mammal.&quot; Beachcomber explained. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extended one finger pointing to the paw marks. &quot;Note the deep gashes\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground.&quot; he began. &quot;Badgers have long claws used for burrowing,\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; live underground for protection.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Firedrill was absolutely ingrossed in this. He looked up at\n&gt; &gt; Beachcomber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with childlike bewilderment. He made sure to remember that, he was\n&gt; &gt; sure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to enjoy this planet.

He looked up\n&gt; &gt; at the blue Autobot with calm eyes. They were so peaceful and\n&gt; &gt; non-agressive that one would have never known he was a former\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;I remember when I was on outer post five&quot; he said, his old self\n&gt; &gt; shining through the discomfort of his injuries. &quot;There were... these\n&gt; &gt; blue things about yay big...&quot; He spread his hands about two feet\n&gt; &gt; apart. &quot;..with two rows of teeth. Bloody things bit so hard they left\n&gt; &gt; dents. Not without losing a mouth full of teeth, mind you.&quot; He\n&gt; &gt; chuckled at the memory. &quot;It musta hurt like hell.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Northlight\n&gt; &gt; Domnijoe Productions\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ****************\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
