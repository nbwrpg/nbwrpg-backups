He was beginning \nto get very bored.  He looked at Condor.\n&gt;    \n&gt;          &quot;Hey buddy, I don&#39;t like this either, but apparently, I&#39;md \ndoing it for the good of my health.  So just do as your expected \nhere,&quot; He warned.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;            Skullgrin arrived at the Decepticon base, tired from \nconstantly switching back and forth from walking to driving in tank \nmode to walking and tank mode.  He went into the Decepticon base.  \nHopefully, he wouldn&#39;t be found as an enemy to anybody here.  He \nroamed the base, when he saw Triggerhappy.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey!  You!!  Triggerhappy!!  Nice to see you!  Haven&#39;t \nseen you for several hundred years!&quot; He greeted.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Triggerhappy laughed for a few seconds, then looked at \nCondor, then at Skullgrin.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;What&#39;re you doing right now?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Skullgrin looked at Condor in the cell, then got a grin.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;Well, how would you like it if I said I was relieving \nyou of guard duty?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;              Triggerhappy grinned a grin of relief.\n&gt; \n&gt;              &quot;Would you?  Thanks, now I can do other stuff!&quot; He \nsaid, walking away.\n&gt; \n&gt;              Skullgrin went up to the cell, and sat down, but had \nhis gun ready to fire at this Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt;               &quot;You Maximals could really turn out to be pests.  \nListen, so-called Autobot descendant, when you&#39;re around me, you \nbetter fear me.  It is a sign of respect, but more importantly, it is \nperfectly logical.  I am one of the most evil Decepticons you&#39;ll ever \nmeet, so you better sleep with one eye open!  That is, if you live \nlong enough to get some sleep,&quot; He said, in a truely evil tone.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Orchestra nodded slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Hmm, if we can disable this enemy&#39;s shields, I can sneak \ninto their base and hopefully retrieve valuable propaganda,&quot; He \nsaid,&quot;Sound like a plan?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
