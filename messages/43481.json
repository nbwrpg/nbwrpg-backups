Fi=\r\nrestarter, a Decepticon millions of years old.  Sixshot \nof \n&gt; the Third Cy=\r\nbertronian War, a STAG, Solo Transformer Attack Group, \na \n&gt; six-changer.  =\r\nQuite powerful and useful.  Ares, an average warrior \n&gt; but also a triple c=\r\nhanger.  And then the three Predacons, somewhat \n&gt; outdated warriors that w=\r\nere best used for gun fodder and menial \ntasks.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fellow Neo Decepticon=\r\ns it was earlier in this planet&#39;s rotation \nthat \n&gt; the Ramora&#39;s sensors de=\r\ntected a widely broadcasted transmission \nfrom \n&gt; the Alliance&#39;s island bas=\r\ne.  After taking the time to decipher it I \n&gt; have learned the  Alliance me=\r\nmber Nemesis Enforcer has evidently \n&gt; taken control of the Alliance at lea=\r\nst temporarily.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The somewhat monotone voice of the one-eyed Deceptico=\r\nn stopped for \na \n&gt; moment and began again.  &quot;I wish to know all there is a=\r\nbout Nemesis \n&gt; Enforcer,&quot; he said, raising his left hand which was actuall=\r\ny a \nbarrel \n&gt; of a laser weapon into the air, &quot;begin now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The three =\r\nPredacons stepped forward, Double Punch obviously in \ncharge \n&gt; of them.  &quot;=\r\nBasically, he&#39;s an insane dolt with half a laser core.  \n&gt; Zardus was smart=\r\n, Nemesis is dumb.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah,&quot; Manterror spoke up, &quot;he like talks to hims=\r\nelf and stuff.  \n&gt; He&#39;ll be running the Alliance into the ground in no time=\r\n I&#39;d bet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave watched the rest of the Neo Decepticons nodding i=\r\nn \n&gt; agreement, well those that were actually responding anyway, and \n&gt; rai=\r\nsed his right hand which /is/ a hand.  &quot;Silence.  Comments like \n&gt; those ar=\r\ne important but to create a strategy based on them would be \n&gt; illogical.  =\r\nThe Alliance remained somewhat immobile except for \naiding \n&gt; their Maximal=\r\n allies.  What is the probability that this new \nAlliance \n&gt; leader will st=\r\nay with those tactics?&quot; he asked, noticing that no \none \n&gt; had a real answe=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If he&#39;s a loose cannon, chances are he&#39;ll attack.&quot; Unitron spoke \n=\r\nup, \n&gt; emerald optic sensors seeming to be in deep thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very well=\r\n,&quot; Shockwave began, &quot;I want Manterror, Injector, and Ares \n&gt; to begin surve=\r\nillance on the Alliance bases.  Unitron and Sixshot \n&gt; will begin surveilla=\r\nnce on the Maximals.  Double Punch will remain \n&gt; here to assist me in surv=\r\neying this planet to gain information on \nthe \n&gt; current status of all the =\r\nother factions here.&quot; the being ordered, \n&gt; all of them leaving except for =\r\nDouble Punch who took a place at one \n&gt; of the scanners.\n\n\n"}}
