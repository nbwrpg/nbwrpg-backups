Looking back to\n&gt; see what it was a book. He examined it and found it to have belonged\n&gt; to the Rocak, the ancestors of all robots,even more advanced than the\n&gt; Vok. It would have been Elementary to them,but ti him it would be\n&gt; incredibly advanced. This book held the secret to polarizing energy\n&gt; (I&#39;ll explain when Mustex is face to face with Veratis).\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Mustex cautiously walked along &quot;Alliance Island&quot;. Suddenly he\n&gt; &gt; detected a Mutant Frequency. It Quickly ended. He checked his\n&gt; &gt; computer. It had only lasted 2.8 seconds. It was unlikely,but it\n&gt; &gt; could be explained by a jammer malfunction that had fixed itself.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; raced to the source.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
