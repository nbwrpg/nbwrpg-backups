So yeah, I&#39;d say they were all \nat least 7 \n&gt; or so feet.  The Decepticon cassettes, at least Rumble and Frenzy, \nseemed to \n&gt; be about 7 or 8 feet.  There was a scene in G1 where Rumble and \nSpike were \n&gt; fighting and Rumble was only a few feet taller than him.  Then \nagain in that \n&gt; episode Spike punched Rumble down for the count and didn&#39;t even \nhurt his hand \n&gt; against that Cybertronian alloy :)\n\n\n"}}
