He saw \nBobertron there, but paid him no mind. Instead he went over to the console of \na computer and opened a glass hatch. Inside was a Red Button. He pressed it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Destron Base::\n\n    The ship came alive at the push of the Red Button. Gears whirred and \nhissed, the outer hull guns came back online, they started shooting whatever \nrocks they could. Many of the rocks were blasted, but a gun created a land \nslide, many fell off that way. The ship&#39;s main weapon came online once there \nwas enough room to manuver. Now the Destron Base is open on one side of the \nmountain. (Possibilites for arial attack)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::CyberShark::\n\n    He saw the changes in the Destron Base, he knew it was time, he needed to \nget back to base to see what type of foe they are up against.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Magmatron::\n\n    Pleased with his work he decided it was time for Phase Two. He opened a \ncomm  to all Maximals on the planet. His message went something like this:\n\n    &quot;Attention all Maximals. I am Magmatron, leader of the Destrons. I am \nemploring you help in the destruction of the Predacon ship Iron Fist. I have \nseen it&#39;s weapons up close and I know what it is capable of. If it gets off \nthis planet with enough Energon it could potentily destroy Cybertron itself. \nI am asking you as a fellow Cybertronian to help stop this from ever \noccuring. You may ask for whatever you may need in destroying the ship, and \nto help repair whatever damaged systems you may have, I open all my resources \nto you.&quot;\n\n    He sent the message and went to prepare the ship in the Weapons Room. \n(Samething as Weapons locker)\n\n"}}
