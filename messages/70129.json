Tucson Prime was very good at it, although his=\r\n temper was something that he needed to work on. He then turns his head awa=\r\ny from the source of the sound.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s it, I&#39;m tired of talking to yo=\r\nu.

However as self satisfied he felt, there was a strange\nfee=\r\nling in the pit of his stomach, one he was begining to feel more\nand more o=\r\nften when ever he talked with this Tuscon fellow. His smile\ndimmed a bit.\n\n=\r\n(TAG)\n\n"}}
