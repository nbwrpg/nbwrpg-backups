We \nreally couldn&#39;t have done as well as we did without dedicated members and \nalot of effort. At one point, it was just JP, Inferno, and me who posted \nregularly, but things have picked up considerably since then. After going \nnearly 300 emails a day for most of the summer, the RPG&#39;s certanly prooved \nitself. Let&#39;s keep RPGing in the same spirit (although 300 emails a day would \noverload those of us who are back in school)!\n\n"}}
