He transforms, \nand begins blocking transmissions. \n\n-----\n\nPacifix is about to respond, when JetV&#39;s scanners start to beep. They \nare picking up a weird enegry disruption ahead of the autobot ship, \nand they they pick up a decepticon ship following them on their tail! \n\n&quot;Uhh, Pacifix, we&#39;ve got some wierd energy disruption ahead of us...&quot; \nJetV says nervously to Pacifix.\n\nPacifix frowns, and checks the scanners himself. His eyes widden at \nsigns, &quot;Whoa, that&#39;s a lot of concentrated power...\n\n-----\n\nAs the Autobot ship enters open space, the Azafroth and the Ikoto \nprepare in anxious silence. Azafroth connects the last energy line, \nand harnesses a flux line to trigger the time-warp vortex. &quot;Soon, we \nwill begin the challenge... soon...&quot; he mumbles to himself, his \nirridecent form shimmering with energy. &quot;...almost...almost...&quot; he \nsays to himself, as if urging the Autobot ship to hurry.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Apeface, Quake, Nightmare and Jagged all arrive, land and transform,\n&gt; just behind Slugslinger, Dreadwing and Darkwing. They all \ntransform, and\n&gt; to Havotrons furious screams, enter the ship. Hook looks \naround, &quot;All\n&gt; right Constructicons, let&#39;s go, and show the Autobots what this \nships\n&gt; got.&quot; as he leaps down, into the ship, followed by the rest. \nSLugslinger\n&gt; stands beside Soundwave, &quot;Dosent this remind you off the good ol \ndays?,\n&gt; back to roaring around the Universe. Before we lost the war.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Apeface pushes Slugslinger as he climbs on, then pounds his \nchest, &quot;Yes,\n&gt; we go to hunt.&quot; he yelled. Nightmare carried Jagged to the CR \nchambers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hook walked to the other constructicons, &quot;So, let&#39;s show em what \nthis\n&gt; babies got.&quot; He says, sitting down at the helm of the ship, in the\n&gt; navagational area. Scrapper sits beside him, at the guidance \nsystem. He\n&gt; begins to bark out orders. &quot;Mixmaster, activate the cloaking device.\n&gt; Scavanger, use our radar system to keep a bead on the hidden one,\n&gt; Bonecrusher, Lonhaul, get those weapon systems ready, to blow them \noutta\n&gt; the sky.&quot; he says with dry emotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron sits in the throne. &quot;Soundwave, block all radio \ntransmissions,\n&gt; so we arent detected, and happy hunting boys.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; All Spinister did, was walk over to a window, and contemplativly \nlook\n&gt; down at the ground, as the rockets burst to life, sending flames \nlicking\n&gt; the launch pad with raw heat. He watched Cybertron become smaller, \nuntil\n&gt; it was gone. He whispered something, but nobody could make it out.\n\n\n"}}
