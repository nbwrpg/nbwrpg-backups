To his knowledge, he \nwas \n&gt; the tallest bot on the planet, although in reality there were a few \n&gt; who were taller. Perndabot was 15 feet tall, a fuze of two Maximals \n&gt; and thereby having two fully operational sparks. Other than that, \n&gt; however, everything had been redone by the Alliance, right down to \n&gt; his programming. Before he was tamed (he had gone insane after the \n&gt; accidental fuze), he had been a completely wild bot, and it had \ntaken \n&gt; the combined efforts of most of the Alliance and Maximals (which \nwere \n&gt; both small factions at the time) to restrain him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replies to Darkfate&#39;s question, &quot;Zardus thinks it would \nbe \n&gt; benificial to both factions if we allied. He would be here himself, \n&gt; but the Alliance just got back from a battle and there are things \n&gt; than need to be done back at the base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His mission wasn&#39;t all or nothing. As long as any sort of good will \n&gt; was established between the Alliance and the Predacons, Zardus \nwould \n&gt; probably be happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Darkfate/7 batprobes::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate landed in robot mode, several feet of Pernabot. 6 of the \n7 \n&gt; &gt; bat probes spread in several diferent directions and they lost in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; distance.
