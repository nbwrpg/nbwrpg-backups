He needs your help.&quot;\n\n\n::Spears::\n\nShe held onto Prebon&#39;s arm tightly and walked with him,&quot;I am still \nnervous master Prebon,&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois was shocked at what he hear. Battera, working for the \n&gt; Alliance? And Cybershark too! This must have been what Convix said \n&gt; about a new mission. But he couldn&#39;t take it. He needed to go to \n&gt; Cybertron. He would try once more to reach Battera, and if their \nwas \n&gt; no reaction, he would leave her to do what she wanted with her life.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Battera, listent to yourself! They&#39;ve done something to you! You \nare \n&gt; not an Alliance soldier! You are an emissairy of peace, an ex-\n&gt; Predacon and my friend! Please remember Battera! You shouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; like this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s when he noticed the chip on her arm. He reached for it, but \nit \n&gt; shocked him with high voltage. It had frazzled some of his wires. \nHe \n&gt; looked at her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What...what have they done to you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois fell to the ground at her feet, in stasis lock because of \nthe \n&gt; damage the pulse sent to his head.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotron stared at the probe intensly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So how do we get it back to base?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq counted the numbers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright! We out number The Trainers now. Come on, what are we \n&gt; waiting for! It&#39;s time for battle!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream arrived at the ruins of the Predacon cave, watching the \n&gt; Lavacons come after him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright Phobia, where are you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He still didn&#39;t completly trust Phobia. He did a little more than \n&gt; before, but he still couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility of a double-\n&gt; agent. He had to be on his toes as this plan began.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon saw the look of worry on Spears&#39; face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry. If he ever did anything to you, he would be a hunted \n&gt; bot for the rest of his life. Even if it would spawn millions of \n&gt; years, I would hunt hin down for what he did. Just stay close and \n&gt; nothing will happen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He contined walking.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Plese excuse this, but I have a question. I didn&#39;t watch G1 very \n&gt; much, and so if this is a really dumb question please don&#39;t laugh. \n&gt; But, the way I know it, The Ark crashed, and than a few million \nyears \n&gt; later were awaken. But than wouldn&#39;t they have greatly out-dated \n&gt; technology? In the movie when they were with other bots from \n&gt; Cybertron they looked no different. I would expect at least some \n&gt; subtle changes. What&#39;s with that?)\n\n\n"}}
