She held her breath and fire a carefully aimed shot.\n\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Zava\n&gt; \n&gt; Zava dodged the shots from Terrorsaur, and than the ones from \nKitKat, \n&gt; but the shots by Drillbit were an entire surprise. All  of them hit \n&gt; her around the lower chest. She fell to the ground with mech fluid \n&gt; poured out of her chest. She walked for a few steps, trying to get \nto \n&gt; Deemos, but fell down in pain. She used the comm as her last resort.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Deemos.....This is Zava....I..I&#39;m closer to the Pred cave\n(cough)... \n&gt; Hurt...badly.
