This test\n&gt; &gt; was meant for ALL of us but I can&#39;t =\r\nhelp thinking that this had ta happen\n&gt; &gt; just as Tucson becomes a Prime an=\r\nd how we lost Rodimus to darker forces for\n&gt; &gt; the second consecutive time =\r\nin a row.

But still, it\n&gt; &gt; was less neg=\r\nligbly useless than before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the moment, using WASPINATOR to cal=\r\nibrate, BLACKARACHNIA was able to\n&gt; &gt; determine that HYDRAS was nowhere in =\r\nthe vicinity, with a muttered sense of\n&gt; &gt; the CYBERTRONIAN language equiva=\r\nlent of &#39;No Slag NIghtbeat&#39; going through\n&gt; &gt; her processor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And sh=\r\ne listened to the commentary tossed out by CRYOTEK with extreme\n&gt; &gt; interes=\r\nt now.

She seemed to have a different thought a=\r\nbout what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was going on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s a test, I bet it =\r\nis.  It&#39;s a test of unity and leadership.  This test&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was meant for=\r\n ALL of us but I can&#39;t help thinking that this had ta happen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; just =\r\nas Tucson becomes a Prime and how we lost Rodimus to darker forces for&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; the second consecutive time in a row.  It&#39;s as if events are testing t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; future leadership of our faction and determining who will be wo=\r\nrthy enough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to carry the Matrix once it&#39;s recovered. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And if the chosen leader is str=\r\nong enough to unify all against the forces&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of Unicron.  Tucson too=\r\nk that step when he brought us together.  He&#39;s taken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a serious gam=\r\nble by doing that.  And ta me, that was pretty darn brave of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME nodded again, &quot;Perhaps you are rig=\r\nht, who can say. In the&lt;br&gt;\nend it is always a test of leader ship for anyo=\r\nne. To maintain order&lt;br&gt;\nand unity among ones troops.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;O=\r\nLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; An improvemewnt in scanning range in the dense jun=\r\ngle underbrush was still&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; useless, given that if they were to come =\r\nin under assault by the time an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; opponent was charging them they mi=\r\nght get a resposne from it.  But still, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was less negligbly usel=\r\ness than before.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, using WASPINATOR to cali=\r\nbrate, BLACKARACHNIA was able to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; determine that HYDRAS was nowhere=\r\n in the vicinity, with a muttered sense of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the CYBERTRONIAN langua=\r\nge equivalent of &#39;No Slag NIghtbeat&#39; going through&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; her processor.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And she listened to the commentary tossed out by CRYOTEK =\r\nwith extreme&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; interest now.  He had a point.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And =\r\nwho else had an unknown connection to Unicron..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But Taran=\r\ntalus?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTARANTULUS&#39;s connection was rumored by=\r\n some and guessed at by others,&lt;br&gt;\nbut the full extent of it was unknown a=\r\nt present.

The further he went down&lt;br&gt;\ninto the tunnels, t=\r\nhe more pronounced the affect.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe question was, would he continue=\r\n on or would he return to the&lt;br&gt;\nsurface and inform the others?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH=\r\ne began to hear a low level hum.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-4B854F36-1AC3-4256-8304-55295FDDECF5--\r\n\n"}}
