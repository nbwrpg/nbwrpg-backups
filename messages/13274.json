I&#39;ve been trying to get it working all day, but had to go to a party at \nthree, and just got back. The second phone line&#39;s still scrapped, so I just \ngave up and am using my first, so I have to go in a few mins (people are \ncalling all the time).\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes drift down over Iron Raptor&#39;s body as she leans back and \nrecrosses her legs. He was getting excited, his eyes glued to her. Somewhere \nin the back of his mind, he knew that she was just doing this to get back at \nhim for calling her heavy, but that thought vanished as Prowl looks over Iron \nRaptor, his optics displaying his love for her.\n\nHe was hopelessly and completely in love with her, actually feeling sorry for \ninsulting her. Prowl slides toward her on the table, sliding a hand around \nher, and hoping that she wasn&#39;t mad at him. He raises an eyebrow at the \nexchange between Iron Raptor and Arcangel.\n\n&quot;So you&#39;re going with Arcangel&#39;s plan?&quot; he asks, looking at Iron Raptor.\n\n"}}
