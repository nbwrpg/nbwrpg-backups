Make sure the civilian areas are \n&gt; secured with IGL soldiers before we arrive.  There are anti-IGL terrorist \n&gt; cells still in the civilian areas, despite our attempts to eradicate them.  \n&gt; Also have our top engineers look over the ships systems, every circuit.  When \n&gt; we get to this...Past Earth...no doubt there are some nasty characters afoot \n&gt; that may want our technology.  We can&#39;t allow that.  Then if there is still \n&gt; time, have as many volunteers as possible get into space suits, if needed, \n&gt; and help polish the outside of the Otyebis.  We want to impress those \n&gt; Cybertronians on Earth.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
