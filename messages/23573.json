She groaned quietly, and her wings failed her, \nsending her in a direct plummet for the ground.\n\n&#39;I&#39;m sorry Windlord and Aerotaur..&#39; \n\nThe hit would have knocked the air out of her lungs, except she was \nalready out cold by the time she landed on her back, eyes closed. The \nshot from Fenox whizzed by her, missed because of her falling.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Starlight/Fenox::\n&gt; \n&gt; Starling brings up a hand to block the rapier, yelling in pain as \nit \n&gt; digs into her circuits. He drops her missile launcher, firing two \n&gt; more darts at Teltoli. She had seen her other two darts hit the \n&gt; Maximal. The tranquilizer didn&#39;t act instantly, but two darts \nshould \n&gt; be enough to take out a bot twice Teltoli&#39;s size.\n&gt; \n&gt; Starlight flies back, pulling out Teltoli&#39;s rapier out of her arm. \n&gt; Overhead, Fenox flies by, firing down at Teltoli&#39;s head with her \n&gt; automatic rifle.\n\n\n"}}
