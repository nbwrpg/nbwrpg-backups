The perfect atmosphere to start fires.\n&gt; Her attention was on Teltoli as she waited for her words to sink in, her\n&gt; arms crossed as she watched Teltoli swollow hard. But it wasn&#39;t hard to\nsee\n&gt; that Teltoli was saddened.\n&gt; Even though this did bother her, and even though she was hurt that Teltoli\n&gt; had left her, she had no real intention to lose her as a friend.\n&gt; After all, she was all she had.\n&gt; Carnage nodded at her, her expression blank.**\n&gt; &quot; Yes. But you&#39;re not dishonest, otherwise you would have lied to me. And\n&gt; you didn&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage sighed.**\n&gt; &quot; No, I can&#39;t forgive you for leaving, Teltoli. That was just plain greedy\n&gt; and selfishness.&quot;\n&gt; ** So she had gotten her point across, and she knew it wasn&#39;t quite right,\n&gt; but she was glad that Teltoli was near or already crying. Finally knowing\n&gt; that that was how she felt when Teltoli had left, only she had not cried,\n&gt; instead it had grown into hate. But a slight one which had lifted in the\n&gt; reliefe that Teltoli had returned. However, anger had still dominated.\n&gt; However, now it had melted away to a slight stubberness and plain blank\n&gt; feeling.\n&gt; Carnage looked down at Teltoli like some mother would to their child which\n&gt; had just done something wrong.**\n&gt; &quot; You feel terrable now, don&#39;t you? Like you&#39;re at a dead end, like no one\n&gt; cares? I hope you do, I really do. Because then you know how I felt the\nday\n&gt; you left me, abandoned me.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage&#39;s blank glare softened alightly.**\n&gt; &quot; And as long as you know just how I felt then there&#39;s no need to grovle,\n&gt; the feeling is punishment enough. But what you feel isn&#39;t even half of\nwhat\n&gt; I felt when you left, because you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be\nabandoned\n&gt; and left alone. Especially for long periods of time.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage lowered her voice but it was loud enough for Teloli to hear.**\n&gt; &quot; Like your entire life.&quot;\n&gt; ** She eased her weight onto the other leg, uncrossing her arms.**\n&gt; &quot; But as long as you know, then I see no reason to keep up this arguing.\nWe\n&gt; have to get home.&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage&#39;s expression was no longer hard, but there was no tone of\n&gt; kindness in it as she turned her snout tiwards the darkening sky,\nlightning\n&gt; flashing in the distance and lighting up the two carcases on her back.\n&gt; She glanced towards Teltoli for a moment before turning around slowly\n&gt; towards the swamps, only a few days walk from there or a two day run.\n&gt; Carnage suddenly stopped as her eyes spotted Instrat step away from the\n&gt; forest edge, narrowing her eyes at her.\n&gt; What did she want now?\n&gt; She growled.**\n&gt; &quot; What do you want now?&quot;\n&gt; ** Carnage stood her ground and tilted her back so that the dead weight of\n&gt; the pigs fell to the ground, leaving her more limber and able to fight.\n&gt; She took a step towards Instrat but made no movements that would indicate\n&gt; she was ready for battle. She just wanted her to know that she would be a\n&gt; real challenge this time if she decided to pull something funny.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
