A scan reveals some\nsort of mechanoid, possibly minion in origin carrying a shape or mass\nthat could possibly be Rodimus. The creature read as insect like,\nalthough the shape was unfamiliar. However the creature quickly\ncontinued down the tunnel out of easy scanning range.\n\nAlso Perceptor may remember from a report from Scorponok that these\ntunnels used to lead all the way back to the Ark, beneath the Earth&#39;s\nocean. Although it is unlikely that all the tunnel is still intact\nafter all this time.\n\nHowever there is one notable fact in there: There was a fairly large\nchamber about half way or so that appeared to be filled with some sort\nof minion based technology. Scorponok&#39;s last view of the chamber was\nit being filled with magma. Whether it survived or not is unknown.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
