(Starscream) He thought to himself. How he hated the robot who\ndid worse than killed him and his dream. That treaturous fool ruined\neverything Megatron ever created. He held up his cannon and aimed it at\nthe unready Skyscream. The melodic hum of atomic energy building up in\nthe base of his cannon only pushed his anger. He grited his teeth hard,\nand matched the sudden outburst of energy from his cannon with a\nsadistic scream and he fired on Skyscream, the torrent of raw power\nmatching Megatrons mood. &quot;Destruction to all traitors&quot; He yelled.\n\n\nMotormaster looked at the Situation unfolding into chaos. He jumped back\nup to the top of the hill remembering the real reason they were here. He\nscanned the battle field for Shockwave (Kslawdogg, you will have to tell\nme what is going on with him).\n\n\nWildrider gracefully caught Symphony on his hood, and then used his\nanti-gravitational abilitys to soar from over the ocean to dry land, and\nroared towards the CF.\n\n"}}
