It was often a look that w=\r\nould come from the CMO, Ratchet when he was displeased about something.  St=\r\nraight Shot reads the look well, and swallows hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap too, sense=\r\ns that he is in for a major talking to, as he too remains quiet.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Tuc=\r\nson now takes his place at the head of the room, looking to all of them wit=\r\nh a quiet sigh.  But there was no mistake that he was not about to let anyo=\r\nne off the hook that fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sure you are all aware of why you are=\r\n here.  What happened in the med bay was a bit disturbing and I need to add=\r\nress that with all of you.  I&#39;m not going to point fingers at just one of y=\r\nou, because I know that all of you could have approached each other in a mo=\r\nre civilized manner.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap opens his mouth, but says nothing as Tuc=\r\nson holds up a hand with that stern stare.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ulp, okay, Umm, yeah, I gu=\r\ness I just better keep my trap shut.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot sinks in her chair=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I hate it when he has that look on his face.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson now look=\r\ns to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I heard that.  Anyway, as I see it, all of you are having a=\r\n problem with each other because, in all truths, you really don&#39;t know each=\r\n other as well as you think you know.  Or else, you wouldn&#39;t be fighting as=\r\n you have.  Now, I admit, I too, have jumped to conclusions and I have been=\r\n wrong myself.  I&#39;m going to work very hard to try and correct that.  But I=\r\n also need you three to try and iron out any differences you have against e=\r\nach other.  Therefore, with the mission as urgent as it is, I am assigning =\r\nthe three of you to work as a team throughout the time it takes to put thes=\r\ne matters to rest.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot quickly gasp.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHAT=\r\n?!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap protests first.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But, but, that talkn&#39; go cart start=\r\ned it!  We didn&#39;t even say a word ta that little creepoid!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson&#39;s e=\r\nyes narrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ahh, ahh ahh...  No. No one points fingers at anyone.  T=\r\nhis is NOT what this meeting is about.  I see I have my work cut out for me=\r\n..  And under no uncertain circumbstances are any of you allowed to fight a=\r\ngainst each other.  If I hear anything about any fighting among the three o=\r\nf you, there will be greater consequences to follow.  Now, as of today, you=\r\n are a team, and you will work as a team.  Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap a=\r\nnd Straight Shot slouch in their chairs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson nods.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Good.  Wheelie, you understand what I&#39;m telling everyone right?  I&#39;m=\r\n not singling anyone out, I&#39;m treating you all as equals.  I know you can a=\r\nll get past this, it will take time but you can do it.  Now, Leo Prime, per=\r\nhaps you have an area you wish to assign them to?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot and R=\r\nattrap look at each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Trapped like rats.  Go figure?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Strai=\r\nght Shot Shrugs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, we had it comming Rattrap, we had it comming.&quot;=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWheelie listened quietly over to Tuscon&#39;s orders.  Like it or not,=\r\n for the moment he was still over in the Army and even unofficially, the Au=\r\ntobot was still expected to obey the orders of the unit leader, especiallyh=\r\nere in the past.\n\nSo, as Tuscon went on with the instructions and the limit=\r\nations the trio would have to operate under order, Wheelie&#39;s fists over ten=\r\nsed, but he did not do or say anything, merely nodding up and over at Tusco=\r\nn.  As much as he might have a low opinion of Tuscon, Tuscon was still the =\r\nbase commander, and he could understand the sense of the orders and he woul=\r\nd not disobey them.  So, he sat back and crossed his legs then, glancing si=\r\nlently without his normal rhyming up at Tuscon as instructions were given.\n=\r\n\nAt this point, as Tuscon explained under the restrictions they were suppos=\r\ned to operate over under, Wheelie finally piped up, &quot;So, what are we suppos=\r\ned to do?  You told us a mission, but not about who.  You need us to get up=\r\n and go somewhere, but not what we are supposed to do once we get there.&quot;\n\n=\r\nWheelie trying to remain mostly quiet, not shooting glances over at Rattrap=\r\n and STraight SHot, but him remaining glancing over at Tuscon to try and fo=\r\nrce himself to listen to orders and not go about and run off as he normally=\r\n did, and what thier assignment was to be.\n\n\n"}}
