With a snarl he fired without a blink of an optic or twitch or regret, when it came to disposing of an enemy he was the most sparkless son of a slag there ever was!\nSuddenly and without warning there was a sudden explosion beside him and he turned his head to look as the smoke died away and left a crater in it�s wake, snapping his head towards the direction in which it had come Dinobot saw something that spelled major damage�20 charges heading straight for him!\nWith a loud growl he stepped out of the way of the second charge and the swerved to avoid a third, if not for his transmetal 2 armor he would have been scraped beyond all repair.\nThe damage in which he had obtained when charging up to Nemesis had slowed him up a but and now he was beginning to feel it, his joints hurting like the Pit and mech. fluid streaking his silver structure.\nBut then the fourth and fifth charges came into view but he was to late to swerve and avoid them, causing him to stager back a few steps with the impact and the charges leaving scratches and gashes along his chest. Dinobot looking up but then only getting knocked further into damage as the remainder of the charges sent by Scavenger hitting him at full force and together in one huge explosion!\nEngulfed in fire and searing pain for only a matter of seconds before he fell to his knees and hung his head, everything hurt now and everything bled�where was Tavatron when he really needed her?!\nThere was no chance in the Pit that he was going to get up but there was also no chance that he was going to be able to beat this enemy with all of them firing upon them, it was hopeless but his bullheadedness and stubbornness would keep him alive for as long as he needed to be.\nWith a low growl Dinobot soon began to rise from his knees, his chest-plate and left leg ripped up and bleeding. His steps were staggering but he soon steadied them, looking across the field at Scavenger but then down at Nemesis�breathing hard he hissed with bared teeth�aimed at all who had fired upon him�*\n\n� You can fire your weapons, you can throw your bombs, you can raise your swords�but I will not yield! Death will be the only thing that will still my breath within my lungs but it shall not be before I hold your decapitated heads in my claws and drink the fluid from your veins!!!�\n\n*With those blood-chilling words escaping from his throat in one massive roar Dinobot reached behind and brought out a large plasma rifle in which he loaded within seconds and aimed towards Scavenger. With lightning speed over 30 high powered charges erupted from the weapon and were sent so fast towards the Predacon that the first of the charges reached him within a blink of an optic but exploded behind him, the dirt rained and a boulder shattered into nothing but dust behind Scavenger.\nThey had chosen to piss of a bot in which they shouldn�t have�death only inevitable if they continued to do so.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
