Same as hundreds  of \nones they&#39;d done before. But this one had ended with desaster and now he \ndidn&#39;t even know where he was.\n#1) was because he was blind\n#2) was because none of his systems had come online yet, none of the \ntracking or navigational ones anyway\nAnd that was about it.\nSo, now he was on his own and with the scents of the dead and leaking fuel, \nhe really didn&#39;t want to stick around too much. Besides, he could already \nfeel warm mech-fluid leak from his right brown and maybe he could find a bit \nof water to clean himself up with a bit.\nSo, with his nose stretched out ahead of him, he scurried off into the \nsurrounding forest.\nProbably no one expecting to see a 5ft tall mole sliding in and out of the \nshadows cast by the towering trees.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_4aea_3aba_4851\r\nContent-Type: message/rfc822\r\n\r\nReceived: from [208.50.144.68] by hotmail.com (3.2) with ESMTP id MHotMailBC69737300B2D8219796D03290441D12150; Fri Mar 02 15:19:01 2001\r\nX-eGroups-Return: sentto-508726-28677-983575066-tmrattrap=hotmail.com@...\r\nReceived: from [10.1.4.56] by cj.egroups.com with NNFMP; 02 Mar 2001 23:17:46 -0000\r\nX-Sender: icedemon101@...\r\nX-Apparently-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\r\nReceived: (EGP: mail-7_0_4); 2 Mar 2001 23:17:46 -0000\r\nReceived: (qmail 40068 invoked from network); 2 Mar 2001 23:17:45 -0000\r\nReceived: from unknown (10.1.10.27) by l10.egroups.com with QMQP; 2 Mar 2001 23:17:45 -0000\r\nReceived: from unknown (HELO hotmail.com) (216.33.241.212) by mta2 with SMTP; 2 Mar 2001 23:17:45 -0000\r\nReceived: from mail pickup service by hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC; Fri, 2 Mar 2001 15:17:45 -0800\r\nReceived: from 24.7.159.169 by lw8fd.law8.hotmail.msn.com with HTTP;\tFri, 02 Mar 2001 23:17:45 GMT\r\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\r\nMessage-ID: &lt;F212uuN5bjeBSk1MZeA00011d4a@...&gt;\r\nX-OriginalArrivalTime: 02 Mar 2001 23:17:45.0578 (UTC) FILETIME=[FD2E64A0:01C0A36E]\r\nFrom: &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@...&gt;\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nMailing-List: list nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com; contact nbwrpg-owner@yahoogroups.com\r\nDelivered-To: mailing list nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\r\nPrecedence: bulk\r\nList-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:nbwrpg-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&gt;\r\nDate: Fri, 02 Mar 2001 17:17:45 -0600\r\nReply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\r\nSubject:   Starjumper\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=US-ASCII\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Wizard&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;the transport pod closed and went to the starjumper. after words the Shields went up. the transport pod came threw a force field so that no water would get in. as the transport open up Wizard was standing there to greet them.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Wizard:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;I am Wizard currently in charge of the Starjumper and its crew.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://explorer.msn.com&quot;&gt;http://explorer.msn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;tt&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
