He had realized that the energon present on Earth was too powerful for him to absorb right away, and had decided to keep a watchful eye on the planet until the crystals were ripe for his taking. With the Cybertronians out of his way, he went pleased with himself.\n\n            Yet before the Minions could awake, there came the wreckage of the Mephilis, a slaver ship. The crash on Earth caused the deaths of most of the slave drivers, and those who survived were met with the wrathful vengeance of the now free slaves. The slaves were from all known transformer factions and builds, a few even dating back to the era of the Great Wars. They all formed a loose society, agreeing that slavery was to be banned from their hearts, and punishable by death.\n\n            Fifteen years passed, and the Mephilis survivors were then joined by the crews of rescue ships that had finally managed to track them down. Contact was re-established with Cybertron, and colons started arriving, forming high-tech cities that were designed to ensure a central government on the planet. Industry and economy were bustling, and everybody was happy.\n\n            Or rather, they would have been. The Minions awoke and soon, a sort of Cold War was raging between the Unicronians and the Cybertronians, but also between the Cybertronians themselves. Old hatred died hard, and in this case, they even resurrected. The Maximals and Predacons emerged from the colonies and mistrust became rampant. Yet, some felt that it was their duties to make sure the Minions were being watched. Some, no matter their personal allegiance, collaborated and formed the Watchers, keeping the Unicronians in check while others were embarking on a power trip.\n\n Cities and Locations\n\n   Olympus Complex: The military heart of the planet. Army training facilities are located there and most weaponry is available from that city. It is located inside a tall mountain, with its higher rises coming out of the rocky top. Most military leaders come from there, such as Lord Jotunn, leader of the Iron Skulls Predacons. Minions are to be shot on sight in Olympus Complex.\n   Atlantis: Located on an ancient island, this city is made up of tall towers and labs where science and knowledge reign supreme. It is the testing ground of experimental technologies. Pacificus Maximals are strong there, with Lord Perseus leading them. Violence in Atlantis results in immediate banishment from the city.\n   Valley Mine Pentatron: As its name implies, this city is a mining city where much of the planet�s workforce reside. It is also one of the most industrial cities in the world, and one of the most culturally universal. At the same time, shady business is frequent and law enforcement is not one of the priorities. Lord Spire, leader of the Bushido Predacons, holds her offices there.\n   Cryonosis: This is the Antarctic base of the Watchers. It is loaded with up-to-the-minute stealth and surveillance technology. Not many dwell there, as it is the most environmentally hazardous city, but there are enough people to make Lord Elder, Watcher leader, proud of his achievements. Giving in to faction struggles there can result in jailing.\n   Relay: If the world has a center, this is it. A city in the sky, Relay is where the lords meet and vote, where the Central Government is seated and where the corporations are based. Trade is made from there, and transportations and communications are developed there. Lord Razorwing, leader of the Silver Wings Maximals, is based there. Being found guilty of corruption in Relay is punishable by public execution.\n   Orbital Factories: These are the center of production for the planet.\n   Searing Eye Base: Rumors say that the Minions are building a base on the moon, a tribute to Unicron himself. Nothing is known for sure about it, but red reflections can be seen from the natural satellite at night�\n Factions and Groups\n\n   Bushido Predacons: In the spirit of the warrior�s way, these Predacons believe that preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for the little while they still have before the Minions start an all-out war. Leader: Spire.\n   Iron Skulls Predacons: These Predacons think and proclaim loudly that the Maximals are weak and that they will bring destruction on everybody when the Minions act. They would rather take over the lead from the Maximals and act right now. Leader: Jotunn.\n   Pacificus Maximals: The Pacificus preach that peace is the only way everybody can focus on the efforts against the Minions. Leader: Perseus.\n   Silver Wings Maximals: The Silver Wings are convinced that the Predacons are preparing a revolution and that they want to prepare a strike against them. They think they should take them all out before things get rough. Leader: Razorwing.\n   The Watchers: The Watchers are dedicated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty and swift, and they are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skills also include diplomacy, however, as members of any factions can join the Watchers. Leader: Elder.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
