With a hydraulic hiss, the doors slide \nopen, and slighly disgruntled, and very angry Megatron steps out. \nHis optics like laser beams as he scans the surroundings, spotting \nProto and Destructor.\n\n&quot;Grrr... bring Switchblade to me, I&#39;d like an explanation.&quot; He \nclenches his newly reparied metallic fist, and stretches his legs \ntesting out their functionability. They seemed to be working fine. \n&lt;I must have been rather lucky... heh, to the control room now.&gt;\n\nMegatron walks forward past the two bots waiting for him outside of \nhis CR chamber. &quot;Bring him to the control room.&quot; Heavy footsteps, \nand irritated glow in his eyes only serve to further prove his \ndispleasure.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;catmastero&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;When I exaimined the damage it seems the blast come from within \nour \n&gt; own colony, from the storage bay I think.

I was following orders as his majesty queen Megsy \nordered \n&gt; &gt; me too. I was uncovering artifacts from some crates in the \nstorage \n&gt; &gt; bay. I found them all, and all I remember after that is waking \nup \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; a horizontal light shining through the side of the storage bay. \n&gt; &gt; Looked like something burned a hole through the wall or \nsomething, \n&gt; &gt; but I can say that it was definately powerful.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With an exasperated look, &quot;So, I say whatever Perceptor we can \ndo \n&gt; &gt; nothing right now, so nothing we will do... We&#39;re waiting for \n&gt; &gt; Megatron to come around.&quot; Switchblade smiles and empty smile to \n&gt; &gt; Preceptor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns back to Inferno, &quot;So he got damaged, who pulled that \none \n&gt; &gt; off, there aren&#39;t many that can take him down easily.
