He \nstared at him \n&gt; codly. &quot;I&#39;ll have Hydras deal with you! Fighting amongst \nyourselves, your \n&gt; pathetic. When she wakes up I hope she kicks ur metallic ass.&quot; He \nwalked over \n&gt; to Kit Kat. &quot;This will help keep her stable until we get her into a \nCR \n&gt; chamber. He took a small piece of his black organism covering his \nbody and \n&gt; placed it on Kit Kat. He gave it one instruction to keep her alive \nuntil the \n&gt; CR chamber fixed her. The suit to his knowledge would only \nwillingly seperate \n&gt; from him when he willed it to. When the organism was placed on Kit \nKat it \n&gt; would listen to her as well. If it changed her at all it would be \ndiffrent \n&gt; then his change since he was a pure energon body when it attached \nto him. (If \n&gt; you want you can just have it die when she gets fixed or have it \nchange her a \n&gt; little bit whatever floats your boat.)\n&gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She was unconsious from the dart. Mech fluid leaking from the \ncorner \n&gt; &gt; of her mouth and her face plates damaged. Her body limp in \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor&#39;s hands. Her optics flickered as her program tried to \n&gt; &gt; restart despite the dart&#39;s sedative effects. Even out cold her \n&gt; &gt; programs wouldn&#39;t give up. Yet, she remained unconsious. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
