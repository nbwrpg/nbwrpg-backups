The ship showed him flying for many \nyears before crash landing on this bizzarre planet. His ship had sent \nout a scout drone and prepared FireBlade for this world.  But \nsomething was wrong...he felt something...something he hasn&#39;t felt \nsince back on Cybertron when he was with his faction..To him this \nfeeling was a blip on a radar screen...showing him the way...The blip \ncomes from a bot...but this bot was thought dead long ago by \nFireBlade...And this bot FireBlade is the sworn protector of...THE \nBODYGUARD....He started running forward covering ground quickly \nbecause of his enourmous stride then in midstride he transformed into \na giant Flame throwing tank...He headed toward the blip like it was a \nlife or death situation\n\n\n"}}
