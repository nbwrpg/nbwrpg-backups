Her father always taught her\nthat there were two things you didn&#39;t argue, religion and philosophy. Both\nwere subjects that held strong beliefs and a debate couldn&#39;t be won either\nway.\n\nShe checked the results of the cell sample from the new bot (Nighteyes) and\nwondered about the possibilities it could bring. (What was Nighteyes again?)\nAnother successful aquisition of DNA. She was getting enough samples for her\nfather it would soon be time to return with her prize. the only problem\nwould be to lose her shadow. Or convince her to tag along with her. &quot;If we\ncan divide the DNA samples in a bot then why not thier conversion chips as\nwell?&quot; She pondered the moment. &quot;If a Maximal chip turns a protoform into a\nMaximal and a Predacon chip turns it into a Predacon then there should be a\nway to splice the chips together so that there isn&#39;t a distinction.&quot; The\nhawkbot stared at the results more intently.  She stood wondering just how\nto ask the question so Squizzy would think that it&#39;s idle conversation\ninstead of possible desertion. &quot;I&#39;m here because I need a place to work.\nWhat&#39;s your reason?&quot;\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, October 23, 2000 6:35 AM\nSubject: Re: hawk and (mon)goose.\n\n\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodded and checked the bot in the CR.  She pressed a few buttons\n&gt; and the Chamber extracted a few cells off the bot.  She brought the\n&gt; sample over to Lady Hawk and set them down on the table in front of\n&gt; her.\n&gt; &quot;You have a point.  But then again, don&#39;t you think the Matrix had\n&gt; this planned out long ago? In order to have balance, the matrix\n&gt; created both Autobot and Decepticon.  Maximal and Predacon.  This had\n&gt; to have happened for a reason. But what that reason is, I am not\n&gt; sure.&quot;  She went back to corner of the room as started looking at the\n&gt; paper work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk took it for granted that Squizzy would understand. Two\n&gt; facts were\n&gt; &gt; relevant to her. &quot;Predacons fight because they are programmed as\n&gt; warriors.\n&gt; &gt; Maximals fight because Predacons exist.&quot; She tried to explain the\n&gt; source of\n&gt; &gt; her beliefs but found it hard to put into words without instegating\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; questions. &quot;I&#39;ll take you somewhere where I can make it more clear\n&gt; to you\n&gt; &gt; sometime. &quot; she said trying to change the subject. &quot;I have work to\n&gt; do, If\n&gt; &gt; you wish to assist me you can bring me a sample of this new bots\n&gt; DNA&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
