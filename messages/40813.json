Lightspeed just slid out of the way, a few blasts\nsideswipping him, then he rolled to avoid being stepped on by Grimlock\nand Slag. \n\nGrimlock roared loudly, the noise almost shaking the ship. &quot;Yes, we show\nAUtobots how to fight.&quot; he said, his mouth lighting up, as he charged up\na laser beam. \n\nStrafe performed a berrel roll to avoid the fire from Tremor, but was\nunsuccessful, as the blast sent him tumbling out of control away from\nthe fith.\n\nSLugslinger looked around at the madness, this wasnt his idea of a\nfight. He then looked at the Dinobots a bit scared. &quot;This isnt good\nTremor.&quot; he said worriedly, although he tried not to show it. He fired\ntwice at Grimlock, but the machine gun pellets practically just bounced\noff the prehistoric warrior, as Grimlock opened his mouth, unleashing\nthe force of his laser beam. It cut deep into Slugslinger&#39;s armor, as he\nleapt into the air, and transformed, Caliburst doing the same, and\nlanding on his wing in gun mode. He made a pass by, firring again, but\nthere was no noise. &quot;It&#39;s no good, I&#39;m out of ammo.&quot; he yelled.\n\nTremor could then hear a static noise of Apeface. \n\n&quot;Tremor, what your situation?&quot; the braggart grunted.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nInside the D.E.D headquarters, Apeface was busy on the computer, trying\nto get a hold of Tremor. Jagged on the other hand was pacing restlessly,\nuntil he noticed a message that had been picked up a while ago. He stood\nstill and listened to it. &quot;You have been invited to the IGL.&quot; it said.\nJagged couldnt contain his excitement, as he ran towards his brother. \n\n&quot;Hey Nightmare.&quot; he said in his hideous cackle. &quot;Guess what I found.&quot;\n\n"}}
