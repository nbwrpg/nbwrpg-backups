He knew that he =\r\nhad a sizeable charade to pull off, and he realizes that he will have to ac=\r\nt like an enemy if he&#39;s to get Hydras to trust him. He raises a brow in tho=\r\nught.\n\n&quot; You guys both raise really important points.  I&#39;m gonna have ta do=\r\n things in reverse though, that way, when I do shoot ya Kup, that&#39;ll show &#39;=\r\nem that yeah, I&#39;m on their side, and they can trust me.  Once that&#39;s all do=\r\nne, I&#39;ll probably be able ta get my hands on the info.  Then I&#39;ll relay tha=\r\nt back remotely here ta the base....  But we really gotta make this look co=\r\nnvincing...  &quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s right...  Wait a minute, Kup, what if =\r\nhe went one on one with me instead? I really hate to see you get all banged=\r\n up because he&#39;s not exactly the most gentile fighters known on Cybertron a=\r\nnd neither am I.  Hydras wants my aft on a silver platter and to see Night =\r\nShift beating the scrap out of me might even amuse him.&quot;\n\nNight Shift gives=\r\n Tucson a look.\n\n&quot;I dunno...  You already took enough dents in this fight b=\r\nuddy.&quot;\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot;No, it&#39;s all right, honestly.  It will give me an e=\r\nxcuse to also get my optics repaired.  Now, since you&#39;ll be beating me up, =\r\nyou could return to the dark fortress with a piece of my metal, as a trophy=\r\n for Hydras..  Let&#39;s say, one of my rear view mirrors perhaps?&quot;\n\nNight Shif=\r\nt cringes.\n\n&quot;Woah you sure ya want me ta do that?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; Positi=\r\nve.  And once you&#39;re in the fortress I want you to see if you can locate Wi=\r\nndlord, as well as Nightlight.  Rodimus may already become obvious to you w=\r\nhen you arrive there.  Just be sure to keep yourself on a Decepticon energy=\r\n signature, and not on the Autobot one.&quot;\n\nNight Shift gives him a thumbs up=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Gotchya.  Okaaaay, now ta stage it...  But first Kup wants ta know if y=\r\na picked up on Nightlight.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds. \n\n&quot;I did, I almost reached her, =\r\nbut she was unconscious.  No telling what they&#39;ve done to her now.&quot;\n\nNight =\r\nShift pats him on the shoulder.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s where I come in.  No worries, hope=\r\n ya don&#39;t mind gettn&#39; a few more dents, Wheels.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.\n\n&quot;All ri=\r\nght, enough joking around, I suppose we should stage a chase of some sort?&quot;=\r\n\n\nNight Shift listens intently.\n\n&quot;Yeah, that would work..  Okay, I got it, =\r\nhere&#39;s how we&#39;ll start it..  I&#39;ll call Hydras and let &#39;em know that I corne=\r\nred ya on the way ta the Ark&#39;n I&#39;m givn&#39; chase.  You make like you&#39;re tryn&#39;=\r\n ta get away from me, and then we transform&#39;n duke it out in the open where=\r\n I hope Hydras will catch sight of us.  After that, I beat the scrap outa y=\r\na, and sorry if I do hurt ya in advance, I promise I&#39;ll make it up ta ya.  =\r\nAnd then after that, I leave you out there ta rust helplessly out on the fi=\r\neld.  It&#39;s at that time that you radio Lord Elder&#39;n tell &#39;em that you&#39;ve be=\r\nen jumped by me, a Decepticon.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;I got it.  All right.  Lor=\r\nd Elder, Kup, I want you to keep this channel open to Hydras, as things unf=\r\nold.  He&#39;ll want to hear how the chase is going, and probably want to hear =\r\nNight Shift&#39;s act against me.  That should spark some curiosity among him o=\r\nr his comrades. With that said, it&#39;s go time.&quot;\n\nThey transform into SUV mod=\r\nes and drive outside where Night Shift now turns from Autobot into Deceptic=\r\non.  The chase begins quickly and furiously around the Ark, as Tucson tries=\r\n to lure Night Shift away.\n\n&quot; Chase me all you want, you&#39;re not getting you=\r\nr hands on the Matrix!&quot;\n\nNight Shift tries to catch up to him and comes bum=\r\nper to bumper with Tucson.  He slams into his side fender, trying to get hi=\r\nm to tip over, with a powerful and loud smack.\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll just have ta see ab=\r\nout that pretty boy! &quot;\n\nThe chase appears convincing as Night Shift now man=\r\nages to spin Tucson out of control as they both transform into Robot mode, =\r\nbegining the next phase of their plan.   A battle erupts between the two of=\r\n them as they clash fists, kicks upper cuts and other dangerous combative m=\r\noves toward each other.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yup, We dont like to have another loss, my friend&quot;sai=\r\nd Kup&quot;And perceptor can be blind but he isnt fool, I hate to admit it but h=\r\ne&#39;s a geniuos  when he is involved in hi-tech stuff. He reprogramed Nightli=\r\nght once and when we tried to reprogram her  back to her Maximal status we =\r\nalmost loss her...&quot;Kupp looked to a sleepy elita and added&quot;We may need a co=\r\npy of their reprograming programs and Before attemp to rescue them we will =\r\nneed to know how bring them back; we also have to locate windlord, and know=\r\n what had happened to him, he is most likely alive and reprogramed... You m=\r\nay need a copy of his signature&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup sighted &quot;Till situation calm down=\r\n Nightshift, you should be carefull and not made them suspect about you. I =\r\nguess that we have to create a conflict  in order Hydras see you shooting u=\r\ns and if that help you to gain his trust, I&#39;m volunteer to be hit... but  i=\r\nt must be a real one, even if that mean several days in the CR.&quot; and lookin=\r\ng to Tucson, he said &quot;One question Tucson, before we start this mission: di=\r\nd you be able to get contact to Nightlight?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Preston Carroll =\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 17, 2010 2:52 PM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; =\r\nSubject: Re: Back to the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt; Night Shift points a playful fi=\r\nnger at Tucson with a sly grin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Slag boy, you are one sneaky bot.=\r\n Exactly what I had in mind but that little ditty at the end, didn&#39;t see th=\r\nat one commn&#39;. You got it, next stop... Hydra&#39;s place right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucso=\r\nn nodds. Night Shift looks to everyone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yo, you guys okay with th=\r\nat right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder turned to look at Nightshift, his optics thought=\r\nful and\n&gt; curious. &quot;I have read reports about you Nightshift, but I see the=\r\ny did\n&gt; not do you or Tuscon Justice.&quot; he said as he stood up.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tusc=\r\non and Nightshift laid out their plan, his optics followed\n&gt; them, flipping=\r\n from one bot to the other as they bounced off of each\n&gt; other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Inter=\r\nesting.&quot; he said as he folded his arms over his chest, rubbing\n&gt; his chin s=\r\npeculatively. &quot;Hydras is no fool&quot; he said slowly, his\n&gt; thoughts obviously =\r\nchurning. &quot;and he is not usually the trusting sort.\n&gt; I can imagine with th=\r\ne last little break in, he will probably be less\n&gt; so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder fro=\r\nwned thoughtfully, &quot;It might work though, but you are\n&gt; going to have to be=\r\n very careful. We don&#39;t want another missing\n&gt; comrade.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pr=\r\neston\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sandy, I sent out a new note to ya.
