Below it, Nightshift perfor=\r\nms a poetic version of Tai Chi, and while going through one of the paces, t=\r\nhe water drop gently rolls down onto his arm without splattering and contin=\r\nues to stay intact as he moves with a peaceful grace and fluidity.  At the =\r\nend of the performance, the water drop is caught on the top of his hand as =\r\nhe manages to deposit it intact, into Elita&#39;s  paws.\n\n&quot; And there ya have i=\r\nt.  Master Yokitron called this Inner Peace.  One can only find inner peace=\r\n within themselves once they learn how ta accept and recover from the demon=\r\ns of their past.
