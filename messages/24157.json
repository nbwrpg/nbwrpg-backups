He fired off a grenade at \nTorca, followed by an arc of sonic energy from his sonic blaster.\n\n---\n\nPyro was now driving full speed, one missile erupting behind him, leaving a \ndirt filled crater, the other hitting him in the back.  He pulled to a stop, \nfiring off three fireballs at Sky Lynx, and turning his entire form, two \nslots sliding up, revealing missile launchers.\n\nBoth seeking missiles launched off at Sky Lynx, tracking his energy signature.\n\n--- \n\nHiss pulled out a grenade and pressed a button, setting it to blow on impact, \nautogun fire grazing the side of his head.  He threw the grenade at the CF, \ngetting a direct hit, blowing apart three of the remaining six autoguns, \nquickly firing a fusion blast to blow apart an EMP cannon before it could \nfire upon him.\n\n---\n\nScavenger ducked under most of Ratchet&#39;s shots, some striking him in the \nchest, almost knocking him off balance.  He replied with 25 rounds heading \nfor Ratchet, followed by 20 rapid optic blasts.\n\n---\n\nSixshot felt the blade explode against his armored form and laughed, firing \noff two blasts from his cannon in his tank mode off at Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf let all 25 blasts hit his chest, and let out a howl.  He raised a \npalm, firing off a powerful purple blast off at Sidewswipe, followed by three \ncrimson optic blasts.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper heard his brother yell, and fired off twenty-five rapid laser \nbolts from his rifle at Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw drove at the Cybertronian Fire, launching two more missiles, one \nblowing up against the hull of the CF, another blowing up against the shields \nwhich now only slightly blocked shots.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch fired off an optic blast, intercepting the incoming missile.  He \nwent at a jog forward, firing one energy-signature seeking missile from his \nleft pincher at Orion, and firing off one other energy-signature seeking \nmissile at Prowl, who he saw join the battle.\n\n---\n\nInjector flew downward, the missile going by him, the shock wave of it \nslightly injuring his back.  He raised both arms, firing off eight stinger \nmissiles, four from each launcher, at Orion.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee flipped in the air, being thrown slightly by the exploding missile. \n He fired down four stinger missiles at Orion from his left launcher, and \nanother four  towards Sky Lynx.\n\n---\n\nManterror dodged the incoming missile, but was hit in the back by Kluster, \nand flew forward.  He regained his balance in mid-air, and turned, firing \ndown six ion disks at the commander of the Cybertronian Fire, firing three \ndisks from both arms.\n\n---\n\nThe missile exploded against Ares&#39; armor, which was starting to fail.  He \nraised all four of his cannons to point at a single target.  &quot;Now you&#39;ve made \nme mad.&quot;\n\nHe fired four powerful blasts from each cannon, sixteen blasts in all heading \nstraight for Sky Lynx.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor laughed as Lunaprine made his challenge clear.  &quot;How about no?&quot; he \nasked, raising his left arm, firing off a blast from his plasma launcher at \nLunaprine.\n(NOTE: Plasma launcher is similar to missile launcher, only with plasma \nenergy)\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer outstretched his leathery looking wings and took flight, \nheading for Prowl.  &quot;Time to die!&quot; he yelled, firing off 10 rapid blasts from \nhis rapid-firing laser rifle at the Maximal.\n\n---\n\nScattershot lifted off into the air, picking out a four foot long and four \nfoot wide bomb from subspace and arming it.  &quot;I&#39;ve got, high hopes, in the \nskyyyyy hopes!&quot; he laughed manically, throwing the bomb down towards the CF.\n\n===\n\nChordate regained his composure, trying to not feel his face.  Mech-fluid \nalmost completely blocked his view as he walked over to the main console \nwhich was completely fried.  &quot;SLAG IT!&quot; he yelled, slamming a fist down on \nthe console, as Scattershot&#39;s bomb exploded against the shields.  The \nexplosion sent Chordate slamming to the ground, hitting his elbow hard which \ninternally shattered.\n\nChordate layed on his back, checking the his internal comptuer which was \nlinked with the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s.  The shields were down to twelve \npercent.  Only two autoguns, and three EMP cannons remained.  Four missile \nlaunchers remained, wtih ten armed missiles each.  There were also several \nsmall hull breaches that though no one could fit through, if worked on they \nwould be breached.\n\nHe decided to take a risky venture, and ordered the CF to fire two missiles \nfrom each launcher in a widespread.\n\n---\n\nThe missile launchers armed, firing off two missiles each in a widespread \npattern that would cover the ENTIRE battle field in flames, only those in the \nair would be spared.\n\nChordate collapsed, not going into stasis lock or death, but just laying \nthere, not knowing what more to do.  \n\n"}}
