He had never visited a pla=\r\nnet like Earth before, but he knew he must recognize the area from historic=\r\nal accounts of transformer history.  &quot;Computer, scan geographical area & cr=\r\noss reference with historical landmarks in transformer history.&quot;  Even befo=\r\nre the computer responds to his request Fracturcon realizes that this is th=\r\ne area where the Ark crash landed.  Before the computer confirms this Fract=\r\nurcon instructs his computer at his base to scan for any transformer(s) in =\r\nthe area where the Ark is at.  After a few blips & bleeps the computer resp=\r\nonds &quot;Contact made with multiple targets in or around vicinity of the Ark. =\r\n What!!!&quot;, stammers Fracturcon, &quot;if there are Predicons or maximals in the =\r\nArk then there is a potential of the timeline being distrubed.  Am I the on=\r\nly transformer who even gives a damn about preserving our fragile history? =\r\n Am I the only transformer who doesn&#39;t give a rats a** about power & politi=\r\ncs?  When I get to the Ark these interloopers better clear out or I&#39;m going=\r\n to make them a permanent part of history.&quot;  As Fracturcon burns his booste=\r\nrs to the max towards the Ark, his thoughts are not towars finding the iden=\r\ntity of who this Dinobot is, but of casting out the intruders in the Ark.  =\r\nAs he approaches the Ark the only thing he speaks is &quot;Charge all weapons to=\r\n maximum....and prepare to engage targets.....&quot;\n\n*****Internet E-Mail Confi=\r\ndentiality**********************************\nNotice:  This e-mail may conta=\r\nin information which is privileged and confidential.
