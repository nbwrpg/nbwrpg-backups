He glanced at Spears, \nwondering who she could have named. She hadn&#39;t been on the planet for \ntoo long, so she probably didn&#39;t know who was the Maximal leader, but \nhe was sure he had met at least a few high officials.\n\nOne thing was for sure in Striker&#39;s mind, whoever the Maximal leader \nwas would probably be this team&#39;s next target. He couldn&#39;t let that \nhappen. Setting his scanners to give him info on the chip in Spears&#39; \nhead, Striker looks back at Prebon.\n\nWho should he name? Someone that Spears might have also named, \nsomeone who was experienced, someone like.....\n\n&quot;Ramulus,&quot; Striker says, &quot;And if you let Spears and me go, I can lead \nyou right to him. Or him to you, whichever you preffer.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus lets out a breath of relief as the shuttle lands safely, \nnearly jumping out of his seat as the belt releases. He makes his way \noutside, looking lovingly around at nature, even if nature was a bit \ncharred and cratered. This is where he belonged, not on some moon.\n\nHe looks back at the Maximals, waiting for them to say something.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon got Spears&#39; message and walked to Striker&#39;s cell. He peered \n&gt; in \n&gt; the hole.\n&gt; &quot;Ah, you are awake! And I should have remembered to pull out your \n&gt; transformation circuts. You would&#39;ve have gotten out of your \nchains. \n&gt; I hope you like my new army member. Isn&#39;t she just precious? \n&gt; Fortunatly for you yo won&#39;t have to stay here long, unless my pan \n&gt; goes ill. If it does than you stay forever. Spears has already told \n&gt; me the answer to this question, but maybe she is low ranking and \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know the real answer. So I will ask you, and if you do not \n&gt; give me the correct answer I will terminate Spears. Who is the \n&gt; Maximal leader?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, nic job Ramulus! But here we go...coming in back to \n&gt; Earth!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix was able to pull the bottom up at the last second, letting the \n&gt; shuttle hit the ground evenly. I tall shook, neraly throwing the \ntwo \n&gt; soldiers out of their chairs. It went along the ground for a bit \n&gt; until finaly stopping just infront of the group. Brix Fliq and \n&gt; Ramulus had returned to Earth! Brix and Fliq got out of the shuttle \n&gt; to greet the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey guys! We come bearing new computer boards and new hull. So \n&gt; what&#39;s this problem we have?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
