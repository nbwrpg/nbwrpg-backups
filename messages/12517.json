It was a good thing he made some time to explore the \nship, or otherwise he would have some trouble finding it, which would \nmake this sub-commander look bad. \n\nHe opened the room. The lights came on automaticly, which he thought \nwas a neat trick. He walked over to a seat with multible monitors, \nvaring in sizes in front of it. It had a device below the last row of \nmonitors that looked like a keyboard. He rested an arm on the chair \nand looked at the monitors. He noticed someone on the external \nmonitors.\n\n&quot;Uh-oh.&quot; \n\nIt was Scorponok. \n\nQuickstrike jerked up. &quot;Auto-guns, target unit Scorponok an&#39; fire!&quot; \nhe commanded. The external auto-guns turned onto Scorponok&#39;s position \nand fired multible times on  him.\n\n\n"}}
