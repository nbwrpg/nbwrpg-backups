They ran.  He would not be detered by a little \n&gt; smoke and lava.  Worse had been done t him before, and he \n&gt; knew his armor could withstand thegeat tempatures.  Not sparing\n&gt; te cowards a second glance or words, he jumped down into thehole.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup took his weapons and follow Megatron as well as Grimlock\n\nLegacywatched Megatron jump down into the hole and then Kup and Grimlock. He\njust shook his head as he watched them. He suspected that they were each depending on their armor to protect them from the heat - and they would be right, typical Cybertronian armor would be strong enough towithstand these tempeatures for a limited duration. \n\nHowever that was not the full extent of the danger. It was the internal circuitry, the more delicate metals inside that were at risk. Once the armor heated, internal temperatures could rise to dangerous levels, and sensitive  connections and couplings could fuse or melt. Perhaps Megatron had some internal buffer to protect against such things, but Legacy was unaware of Grimlock or Kup having such modifications. \n\nIn the distance the redness began to brighten as the temperature and pressure in the hole began to rise and liquid rock began to push everything towards the surface - it would soon be erupting! \n\nA quick self-diagnostic alerted Legacy that his own shields that would normally be more that capable of\nwithstanding such an event were still damaged from battle; his self-repair circuits still working on the problem. So Legacy just watched the others from the surface, seeing little logic in risking his own existence to follow someone he did not know or trust, in an effort to recover someone who had either most likely had fled or had been destroyed. \n\n(TAG: Any)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
