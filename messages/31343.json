Jeremiah will be posting for \nTantrum and Headstrong.\n\n::Predaking::\nHe has been thinking for a while (no kidding eh =P). Megatron has \nleft, no surprise to him. &lt;I wonder where he is...&gt; Predaking splits \ninto the Predacons, who land in a circle all facing each other. \n\n::Razorclaw/Divebomb/Rampage::\nRazorclaw steps forward, &quot;Grrrrr, Megatron must be found,&quot; He \nopens a commlink to Megatron, &quot;Megatron, this is Razorclaw and \nthe Predacons. We are currently at the crash site. What is your \ncurrent location?&quot; He transforms into Lion mode, and lays himself \ndown on the ground. \n\nRampage looks around, getting angry, &quot;Grrrrrr,&quot; he whips out his \ngun, and destroys several trees some distance away from the \ngroup on the island. He grips his gun tightly, wanting to destroy \nsome more, and barely manages to stop himself from completing \nhis desires, for now.\n\nDivebomb transforms, and flies up, soaring in circles over head for \na few moments, then lands on the top of an unmolested tree.\n\n"}}
