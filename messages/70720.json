Pushing a=\r\n few buttons on it it began to glow slightly as it\nunfolded into a temporar=\r\ny antigravity suspensor bed.\n\n&quot;I will be right back.&quot; he said, &quot;I am going =\r\nto retrieve Nightlight.\nWe still have a bit of work to do it seems.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thank you Legacy, everyone, I know it&#39;s hard to u=\r\nnderstand things that we normally could never understand, but it is this co=\r\nmmon ground which will keep us together as a faction, something Hydras does=\r\n not have, nor will ever have. I also understand your reservations on the m=\r\natter. I can tell just by the tones of your voices, but I also comprehend t=\r\nhe reason behind it and it&#39;s only normal to have reservations. I am not off=\r\nended by your true feelings, but thankful you are willing to give Perceptor=\r\n the chance to prove himself worthy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Before Tucson had been upgraded t=\r\no a Prime, this sort of talk would often anger him to the point of grave an=\r\nnoyance. He&#39;d often speak up and stick up for those being riddiculed and wh=\r\nenever necesary, he probably would have lost his temper all together and de=\r\ncked the offender right there and then. But now, he realizes those feelings=\r\n did not come through. Something was definitely changing. Instead of being =\r\nhis old self, he was evolving into someone new, wiser, more tolerant, and a=\r\n lot more calm as an individual. Yet, his toughness was still there, along =\r\nwith his courage, and will to fight. He could not yet understand the meanin=\r\ng of these changes, and for whatever reason, he knew they were for the bett=\r\ner. He now turns his head in Legacy&#39;s direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Even as a Prime, I&#39;m=\r\n still in the process of learning. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop learning. O=\r\nne thing I have to admit, if I were still my old self now, short tempered, =\r\nquick to be critical, I may have blown the roof off the Ark, and retorted a=\r\ndversely. But now, I couldn&#39;t find it in my spark to react as such. I&#39;m cha=\r\nnging, and as I change, I can feel the pressense of Optimus Prime. I often =\r\nfeel that if I could see my shadow, it would appear as his once did, long a=\r\ngo. Why is that? I know I&#39;m not Optimus, yet there is a part of me that fee=\r\nls that he&#39;s within me somehow. Legacy, is there something about me that ev=\r\nen I do not know? I&#39;m very curious to find out.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy watched Tus=\r\ncon impassively, his single optic glowing with a\nfocused light. &quot;Your react=\r\nion is . . . curious.&quot; Legacy said in his\nnormal icy tones, &quot;Change is inev=\r\nitable,  predictable and often times\nbeneficial. Logic demands that we adap=\r\nt to what we cannot control and\nbe a part of change rather than a victim of=\r\n it.&quot;\n\nLegacy turned to observe Perceptor, &quot;I am sure we shall all keep a\nw=\r\natchful optic on him, and adapt our responses to his actions.&quot;\n\nSanton nodd=\r\ned as he crossed his arms, &quot;Yep. I agree. If you vouch for\nhim Tuscon then =\r\nI will give him the benefit of the doubt, but I won&#39;t\ntake my optic off of =\r\nhim until he proves it to me he&#39;s trust worthy.&quot;\n\nTorca, who had stepped ba=\r\nck in the room merely nodded at Tuscon,\nholding his own council for the mom=\r\nent on how he felt about\nPerceptor&#39;s presence. Instead he chose to change t=\r\nhe subject, &quot;I will\nbe sending the Fuzors out on patrol. There is no tellin=\r\ng what Hydras\nis doing while we are all sitting here watching you and Rodim=\r\nus\nrecover.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
