(The shots from Jen, if anyone is wondering). Then out of no where\ncame the swarm of Maximal robots, and Menasro had slight recognition of\nthem. They swarmed his hand, attacking and lashing it. He simply moved it\nbefore one of the robots could hit, but Dark&#39;s hits, the blade cutting in\nto the cuircutry, becoming stuck in his thick armor. At the Maximals\nthreats of hands off, and their attempt to tie him up, the Giant becomes\nenraged. He pulls his arm that the changes have attached to, and he pulls\nit hard. Power that can crush concrete, now flails whatever is attached to\nhis arm, in the other direction, absolutely no pressure against it, (As far\nas what I understood from youre post,it is from Koj, who cant be more than\n16 feet, and Menasor can easily overpower that., by the way, I dont have a\nclue about youre guys cause of the profile.) &quot; Menasor put hands on\nwhatever Menasor wants&quot; his voice rumbles.\n\nHe lands beside Firearm uprighting himself, at his awesome 45 feet he looks\nat the shield and with his free hand attempts to touch Firearm, and pulls\nhis hand back from a burn. &quot;What, this&quot; he says confused. But Menasor\ndosent let pain stop his onslaught, so he plunges his hand into the shield,\ntrying to pick up Firearm, and feeling searing pain as he does, his jaw\nhung in confusion.\n\n\n\n"}}
