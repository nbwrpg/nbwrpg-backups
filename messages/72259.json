My reports from\n&gt; my soldiers=\r\n show that your team is holding the device that Dark\n&gt; Rodimus used to esca=\r\npe. Have you found any way to make use of it?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD - SKYSHADOW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nKYSHADOW dipped his head in a small nod, &quot;You speak well Dinobot.\n&gt; Hide ou=\r\nr forces. Pretend to work with these Maximals and yet see what\n&gt; we can get=\r\n out of them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up at the screen, but being careful to stay out=\r\n of the view of\n&gt; it he smiled, &quot;So I wonder what we can get out of the Max=\r\nimals for\n&gt; this. They want that device, I wonder what we can learn from it=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked over at FRACTYL who was even now still studying the very\n=\r\n&gt; device in question.\n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nDINOBOT paused as he quietly listen=\r\ned, &quot;Keep most of our forces in reserve.  Put on a show of cooperation and =\r\nlet the Maximals take the brunt of it.  When the situation is dealt with, s=\r\nwoop in and take advantage of their weakness, or otehrwise have the majorit=\r\ny of our troops pursuing secondary goals.&quot;\n\nThen grinning, &quot;And perhpas we =\r\ncan make a..  An exchange in return for the truce and our cooperation that =\r\nthey will have to pay to weaken and divide them further. In return for our =\r\nassistance, we should request an intact stasis pod with sparked protoform t=\r\no remake toa  Predacon.  If they want our assistane then they can pay a pri=\r\nce for it while at the same time dividing thier own troops by having to pay=\r\n such a thing, which we can later take advantage of.&quot;\n\nVICE GRIP pondered, =\r\n&quot;The Maximals will be more apt to expect a direct double cross in the field=\r\n when it is over.  So if we do cooperate with them and do not instantly eng=\r\nage them when whatever this crisis is is over, it would disrupt any counter=\r\n schemes they might have.  As well as keeping the new elements of our force=\r\ns out of sight for now allows us to take a more opportune moment to exploit=\r\n it later, as well as letting us gague what the reinforcements this new PRI=\r\nME has brought wtih him and what his own capabiliteis are.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - B=\r\nLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BLACKARACHNIA continued to listen in to the conversat=\r\nion, walking along wtih CRYOTEK and transmitting surreptitiously over to TA=\r\nRANTALUS.

What did the Maximals want anyways?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW looked a=\r\nt HYDRAS, or more specifically at HYDRAS&#39; other\n&gt; heads and nodded, not hav=\r\ning anything specific going on besides\n&gt; conversation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile below=\r\n decks, far away from even HYDRAS&#39; piercing gaze\n&gt; TARANTULUS turned to his=\r\n computer console and began tapping commands\n&gt; into it, chuckling to himsel=\r\nf. He had plans within plans, but it would\n&gt; take time, and for the moment =\r\nhe seemed to have all he needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; On his viewscren was CRYOTEK&#39;s ship.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nAt this point, walking along with CRYOTEK, Black=\r\narachnia smiled, &quot;So, tell me.
