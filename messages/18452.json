He walke dinto the base and found KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey KitKat. We found this bot talking with Inferno. I captured it, \n&gt; but I&#39;ve got to go back and help Drillbit fight Inferno. You do what \n&gt; you want with....hey, what&#39;s the matter? You seem upset?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; The Trainers arrived so that thye could see the CF, but could not be \n&gt; picked up on scans. They were cloaked, but that only worked for sight \n&gt; unless you had stealth cloak. Prebon pulled out the Tamer and checked \n&gt; the scan for Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Damn it! They must have taken her inside. We&#39;re too late. She&#39;s in \n&gt; stasis. But perhaps their is a way to still get ahead in this. I can \n&gt; send messages and extra energy through the link that I have \n&gt; established between myself and the chips. It could help the Trainer \n&gt; program win permanantly. The Maximal chip would still be there, and \n&gt; would work again with repair, but without repair it would just be \n&gt; dormant. She would attack all those around her, and with the \n&gt; distraction we could storm this new ship of theirs. And if that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work, the moment they remove the Trainer chip, if the can \n&gt; find a way to do it without killing her, I simply give the self \n&gt; destruct order and boom! We&#39;re down a few Maximals. I&#39;ll try the \n&gt; first plan first.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prbon began communicating with the Trainer chip.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Come on Spears! You can win this! Come back to me! Defeat the \n&gt; Maximals!*\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon kept repeating this message while sending small boosts of \n&gt; energy to the chip.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
