At best \nat the moment the Predacons would feel enough shock to make them dance to \nkeep their feet from touching the ground, at least it was a sort of defence.\nIris decided that through out the battle she would increase the voltage as \nneeded, it was her idea of fun!\n\n____________________________________________:):):):)_______________\n\n\n* Iron Raptor stopped and looked back towards the Ark, it seemed so \nvulnerable at the moment...as wall as it&#39;s inhabitance.\nShe had to do something before they were completely defeated, and the time \nto act was now!\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to Teltoli...*\n\n&quot; Teltoli, forget the Predacons...head for the ship and follow me to the \nweapon&#39;s hold. I have a plan.&quot;\n\n* She closed her link and began to run faster towards the Ark, a vague idea \nin her mind. It was time to go on the attack instead of the defensive, it \nwas time for then to cause the damage instead of trying to protect from it!\nIron Raptor sighed as she ran towards the base, it was risky but already the \nplan was forming within her mind. The beginning was risky and would leave \nsome of the Ark undefended but if it worked then the Predacons would soon be \nflushed from the base!\nShe smiled to herself, now it was time to get a few other friends into \naction!\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to a new frequency...one of a new bot...*\n\n&quot; This is Iron Raptor to bot 6112 (Fracturcon), please report to the \nentrance of the Maximal base. I will meet you there.&quot;\n\n* She closed her link one last time, she needed extra hands to carry a few \nextra weapons!*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
