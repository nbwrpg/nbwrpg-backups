The repulsor thrusts were \nblocked and there was no getting it out. MEGATRON jumped out into the clear \nnight, followed by Rat Trap :::\n\n::; MEGATRON ::: Damn! Now were stuck...\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: Well boss....we could walk.\n\n::: MEGATRON glared at Rat trap, with his answer :::\n\n::: Rat Trap ::: Ok..I guess not. Well, what are you going to do now?\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: We are going to.....going to.....\n\n::: He scans the area. With his sensors he picks up an underground stream, \nand it leads back into the ocean. If they hauled the speeder into the stream \nthey could float back into the ocean and head for the small keys that hooked \nout from the valley. They might be safe there, and it was unexplored \nterritory. Perfect idea. ::::\n\n::: MEGATRON ::: You three, pick up the speeder and follow me to that out \ncropping. Theres a stram there. I have an idea.\n\n::: He picks up Quickstrike and hurls him over his shoulder, as Rat Trap \nbegins to lift the speeder. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: HELL BEAST looks to Brightblade ::: Ah, a true Predacon. Someone who will \ngo far in my institution. \n\n::: he then turns to Goron ::: You two would make an excellent team! Your \nfirst assignment is to locate MEGATRON and follow him. I want to know where \nhe is, what he is doing, and if he is armed.\n\n::: He then turns to RAMPAGE ::: Sub-commander, the Maximals have been pests \nfor a long while. And I do recall you planning our next attack. If you would \nplease get right on that I would be most happy.\n\n::: HELL BEAST, in his command chair looked to his others ::: begins repairs \non the ship, and modifications. This is our sanctuary, and i will be damned \nif anyone gets inside of it agian. Our next attack on the Maximals shall be \nour greatest...if Rampage is a good enough general as I think he is, anyways.\n\n"}}
