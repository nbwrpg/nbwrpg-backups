He saw tracks that didn&#39;t appear \notherwise, he smelled the air, they weren&#39;t alone, but he still \nwasn&#39;t sure if it was the naitive animals he smelled or if trouble \nwas still near.\n\nHe activated his comm, &quot;Anything on your end S Wing?&quot; he knew in this \nsituation there wasn&#39;t time for full names.\n\nUntil he was sure of his senses he couldn&#39;t be relied on.

Oh yeah. I&#39;ll go on ahead.&quot;\n&gt; She transformed into her owl mode and flew up ahead.  She spotted \nthe Ark.  \n&gt; She couldn&#39;t beieve her optics.  The Ark was missing part of it&#39;s \nstructure. \n&gt;   A huge hole had been blow out on the side of the Ark.  The ground \nall \n&gt; around was charred.  Mech fluid on the ground in patches \neverywhere.  &quot;What \n&gt; happened here?&quot;\n&gt; She flew in for a closer look. A large battle had taken place. She \nhoped \n&gt; that the Maximals survived.  The Autoguns  did not fire on her as \nshe flew \n&gt; into the entrance.  She stopped just inside the door way and \ntransformed \n&gt; into bot mode.  She took a few steps and drew her gun.  She slowly \nwalked \n&gt; down the hallway. She kept out of sight incase someone other than \nMaximal \n&gt; walked by.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---Orginal Message---\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri Jun 30, 2000 10:19pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The sights,filled his optics, the sounds were all around him, \nechoing\n&gt; through the trees. The smells of animals he had yet to encounter, \nbut\n&gt; seemed familiar.He assumed these were the Maximals. He caught traces\n&gt; of burnt trees, and chared earth from thier previous battles, but\n&gt; somehow the wildlife didn&#39;t seem affected.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I smell something out of the ordinary.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He didn&#39;t know ordinary but he knew what he smelled didn&#39;t belong.\n&gt; \n&gt; How far till we&#39;re at the Ark? maybe you should call ahead to be \nsure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
