It was clear\n&gt; that the virus was taking a small step further as he drags his paws along\n&gt; the ground while heading back into the ship.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maybe- it&#39;s not such a bad idea ta stay back after- all.\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes one more step and then collapses.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot  gasps as she watches him go down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I knew it, he should&#39;ve listened ta Stanton and Bump and stayed where he\n&gt; was.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks back to his fallen comrade.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The only one who knows how ta cure him is Tarantulus.  Ughh, the thought\n&gt; of even going anywhere near that twisted spider makes my metal crawl.  But\n&gt; if that&#39;s the only option we have then I&#39;m willing ta go find him myself and\n&gt; ask for his assistance.  Then I imagine I will have to return the favor\n&gt; somehow... &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A tickle from his nostrils and a healthy snort clears his nose.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s better.   I just got over a small case of something myself.  Funny,\n&gt; I&#39;ve been sneezing quite a bit too but I wasn&#39;t dispersing any energon..\n&gt; Hey, the only guy I&#39;ve been around is Uproar, so I know I got this from him.\n&gt;  But for some reason, I shook it off.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap raises a brow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait, wait, I&#39;ve read up on something about horses, something about the\n&gt; fact that they have someth&#39;n in their immune systems that have the ability\n&gt; ta neutralize a whole bunch of harmful toxins, just through their blood\n&gt; serum.   That&#39;s how anti venom is made, in case a person or animal gets\n&gt; tagged by a venomous creature.  I bet Quickstride&#39;s got that capability,\n&gt; just test his hemoglobin for antibodies.  If he fought off that virus, it&#39;ll\n&gt; be in his blood work.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBANTOR shook his head, &quot;I don&#39;t know much about those things.&quot; He said\nas he looked between RAT TRAP, QUICKSTRIDE and UPROAR. &quot;Santon, Bump\nand Legacy were the doctors last I saw.&quot; He said with a shrug.\n\n&quot;Something to think about though.&quot; AIRHAMMER said as he looked back at\nthe trio, &quot;Rhinox would have tried the same thing and it didn&#39;t work\nfor him, why would it be different now?&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME, WING CALIBER, SANTON and TORCA were still standing near the\ncenter of the area occassionally glancing at HYDRAS and SKYSHADOW or\ntalking amongst themselves.\n\nJudging by his stance and body language LEO seemed definitely ready to go.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
