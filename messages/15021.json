She walked down the hall and towards the bridge.  She \nwas wondering if Chordate would ever take her on that tour he \npromised her.  She wondered if he was on the bridge or not.  She \nwalked around and finally came to the bridge.  She turned the corner \nand stood in the doorway.  She looked around.  If Chordate would not \nescort her around, the she would get another bot to do it.  She \nneeded more parts for, &#39;just in case&#39;. She had no idea if the others \nhad started thier search for Dinotbot and Travatron.  Or what \ncondition they might be in when they arrive.  She looked and hoped to \nfind a nice bot to show her around and help gather parts.\n\n\n"}}
