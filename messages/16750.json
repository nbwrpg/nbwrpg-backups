Making it so that it was impossible to locate its� original location.\nBrightBlades fingers stroked over the back of Rex�s neck one more time \nbefore she took a step back, turning towards the sealed door gracefully.\nBut even as she took a few steps towards the door she noticed the sprinklers \ndeactivate, putting out a hand to see if any water dropped onto the palm.\nThere wasn�t any.\nBut then, as BrightBlade was about to move closer to the door there was a \nsudden burst of flame as the throwers activated!\nShe cried out in alarm, backing up, her voice echoing through the room.\nBut, the reflective force field around her may not stop the flames, but it \nreflected them and thus looked like the entire fire filled the room.\nBrightBlade looked at her weapon, reaching into her leg compartment and \nplacing a special end onto the barrel.\nShe aimed carefully and fired�towards the wall.\nA white ball of light exploded from her gun and hit the far wall, bouncing \nand struck the barrel�covering it with a plaster/gel.\nThat should fix that.\nNow, for the rest.\nBrightBlade aimed for different places on the wall, each bouncing off and \nhitting and barrel of the flame-throwers.\nNow, with each gun unable to fire�she was safe from them.\nFor the moment.\nShe turned and looked towards Rex with a smile on her face, even though he \ncouldn�t see it.*\n\n� Naughty, naughty. I�m afraid you�ll have to do better then that.�\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
