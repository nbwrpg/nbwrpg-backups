I&#39;d be =\r\nthe same way.   So we&#39;re gonna go back ta Cybertron huh?  I can&#39;t even reme=\r\nmber what it looks like, and what it&#39;s gonna look like when we get back....=\r\n   AAACHOO!  Sorry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t remember much of it =\r\nmyself.  My memories were stolen from me, by Cyclonus, according to Straigh=\r\ntshot, who actually saw him take the shot. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He then turns to Lord Eld=\r\ner and Leo Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; if I could have anything returned to me, I would m=\r\nuch rather have had my memories returned, rather than my sight.  I can stil=\r\nl love Talon even without my eyes and see her inner beauty through my spark=\r\n, but I can never remember those before me as I wish to remember them. It&#39;s=\r\n rather surprising that one of my memories did come back.. But those I have=\r\n lost, what happened to them?  Perhaps returning home may help me to regain=\r\n a portion of what I lost.  But I will be sure to hold onto these new memor=\r\nies and guard them with my own spark.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nightshift growls as he tries t=\r\no lick at the strange growth on his leg.

I sure hope the guys can get this off me, it=\r\n&#39;s worse than having fleas.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who specializes in illustrat=\r\nion, using traditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also specialize in hand =\r\nmade crafts.

Slaag, if it&#39;s true\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that we got a mole on board, we=\r\n&#39;re done for. But it looks like the big boss kinda knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who it could=\r\n be. Check out Tucson&#39;s body language, his tail tapp&#39;n the ground, his\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; stiff gait, and that little snarl on the snout. He does that when he smel=\r\nls someth&#39;n that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem right.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson turns to Rod=\r\nimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I think it&#39;s best to keep an eye on Legacy. Tell me if =\r\nyou see any suspicious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behavior on his part. If you do, don&#39;t let him=\r\n suspect that you know anything. Just play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; along, observe and relay b=\r\nack to me what you observe. Then together with Leo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prime, we can deci=\r\nde what action may need to be done. I think this is long overdue. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; He salutes Rodimus and heads to the med bay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nAgreed.&quot; RODIMUS said as he glanced at LEGACY and then back at\n&gt; &gt; TUCSON, =\r\n&quot;We need to keep an optic on him. I have not had a chance to\n&gt; &gt; know him w=\r\nell, perhaps Lord Elder can help you with details about him,\n&gt; &gt; he has bee=\r\nn around him the longest.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile SANTON, BUMP and LEGACY have =\r\nall made their way to the medical bay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If LEGACY is the least bit =\r\nuncomfortable with all the optics watching\n&gt; &gt; him and all the suspicious l=\r\nooks being directed his way there is not a\n&gt; &gt; shred of it visable on his c=\r\nold faceplate. Instead he is his typical\n&gt; &gt; efficient self as he walked ov=\r\ner to a console and began to feed in\n&gt; &gt; information.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If you two =\r\nwill get up on the medical beds.&quot; SANTON said, &quot;We can see\n&gt; &gt; if we can ge=\r\nt this over with as fast as possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the same time BUMP was l=\r\nooking at LEGACY in a speculative manner\n&gt; &gt; saying nothing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OL=\r\nD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rattrap nods and gets into beast mode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I wonde=\r\nr what Cybertron&#39;s gonna be like when we get home.. Probably not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nsame as we remember it. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson looks to Talon and gently rubs=\r\n his head against hers, minding his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; snout . Dragons had ways of expre=\r\nssing their love for their mates and what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was doing was no differe=\r\nnt. His feelings were definitely real, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing would ever change =\r\nthat. But as he closes his eyes for a moment, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vision comes into pla=\r\ny. The single optic, staring down at him, as he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flashbacks to earlier=\r\n days when he was just an Autobot. A red optic, and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gun pointed rig=\r\nht at him! And a familiar face. SHOCKWAVE.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It shocks him with a=\r\n bit of a gasp. He looks at Legacy and then back to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Shockwave. I was almost destroyed by him vorns ago, back on Cybertron. =\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knew it, that&#39;s where I&#39;ve seen bots of Legacy&#39;s kind. It&#39;s part of=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; memory I thought I lost when I was taken off line and blinded.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LEO PRIME had walked up as well, &quot;Yes he does bear a =\r\nresemblance to\n&gt; &gt; Shockwave doesn&#39;t he, the same single optic, the same co=\r\nld way about\n&gt; &gt; him.&quot; LEO didn&#39;t look all that trusting either.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhere was a nod from LORD ELDER, &quot;Yes, but he has done more to protect\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis Ark then most of us put together.&quot; ELDER was talking about when\n&gt; &gt; he =\r\ndefnded the ARK against the UNICRONIANS all by himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ELDER glan=\r\nced at LEGACY and then back at LEO and TUCSON, &quot;But perhaps\n&gt; &gt; this is not=\r\n the best place to discuss this. Perhaps when we have a\n&gt; &gt; little more pri=\r\nvacy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meawnhile LEGACY continued to enter in codes to the medical=\r\n computer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; windlord looked at the Maximal comm=\r\nanders and said &quot;then we are leaving to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; track Tarantulus and the huma=\r\nns&quot; then looking at Rattrap and Percetpor said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; RODIMUS PRIMAL on the other hand walked back away from the ARK=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; gestured to RAT TRAP, WINDLORD and PERCEPTOR, &quot;Okay, Windlord and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor, you two direct us to where you saw the humans and let&#39;s see\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; what we can find.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
