Her sence f smell \nwas stronger in beast mode, but in bot mode, it was still a strong \nsence. &quot;Yeah, I smell it too.  I think that they went that way.&quot;  She \nshined the light down a long tunnel.\n&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; \nShe walked down the tunnel and found it emptied into a larger cave \nwith a pool in the middle of it.\n&quot;I can smell thier scent. It&#39;s really strong in this part of the \ncave.&quot;\nShe looked around but didn&#39;t see them. &quot;I wonder where they went?&quot;\nHer instincts kicked in and she had a cold chill run up her back. She \ntransformed back into wolf mode and looked about.  She saw large \nripples in the pond and saw the foot prints in the dirt on the cave \nfloor.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf galloped as fast as he could after KitKat. She was \nfaster than \n&gt; him, due to her longer legs. He panted as he ran. He was starting \nto miss \n&gt; his cold climate already. He didn&#39;t expect it to be this warm.\n&gt; \n&gt; He came to stop with KitKat at the mouth of the large cave. He put \nhis ears \n&gt; to their sides and looked up. He sniffed around, smelling another \nbot. \n&gt; Female.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I smell someone. Female, I believe.&quot; He sniffed again. &quot;And \nQuickstrike was \n&gt; here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
