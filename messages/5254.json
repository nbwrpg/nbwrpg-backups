Personally, I&#39;d like to take a few Predacons and \nturn them into toaster ovens, but that&#39;s just me.  We aren&#39;t supposed to \nfight unless provoked.  which doesn&#39;t take long with these predacons around \nhere.  They just look at your Maximal symbol and they open fire. Oh well, \nPreds will be preds.

To grind them up and recycle thier remanes \n&gt;into &quot;modern art&quot;. Somehow he knew his instincts weren&#39;t those of a wild \n&gt;wolf, but those of a warrior whos fealt more than his share of losses. Did \n&gt;the others Shadow Wing spoke of feal the same, or was it a simple character \n&gt;malfunction? He had to know the truth.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;These others you mentioned? Lunarpine asked in a lost voice,&quot; Who are \n&gt;they?\n&gt;Are they animals like us or are they still protoforms?&quot; He didn&#39;t know\n&gt;exactly what a &quot;protoform&quot; is but for an inexplicable reason the word fit.\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: Logo morph &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Monday, June 26, 2000 6:17 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: The great North\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC:(Have fun on your vacation.
