I wanted to created a blind \ncharacter a year ago more or less but I didn&#39;t know what would be his \nbeast mode I just knew that I liked a Pred. I didn&#39;t know how named \nhim and I named him Perceptor &#39;cause I remembered that in other \ncartoon a blind character had &quot;Perceptor&quot; for name, and I remembered \ntoo that moles are almost blind. So my character would be a \ntrasnmetal mole, then I&#39;ve remembered that an autobot had that name \nand I thought that that would be a cool irony if that character would \nhave technicals skills.\n\nBIC:\n\nPerceptor, couldn&#39;t avoid the shots and was hit for them. He fell \nwounded and quickly changed to vehicle mode, he knew that in that \nmode he could activate his internal repair system while he moved \ntrying to avoid others attacks\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; SS fired 8 lasers at Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I saw the movie and Perceptor was a good guy.
