Give it time and wars will break out again.  Once the \nfactions reorganize, the wars will be started and fights will \nensue.  Besides, give me some time. *grins evilly* yess, there will \nbe fights breaking out.  So relax and have fun. Remember, all wars \nare not just over survival. Wars are generally political.  So give \nit enough time for things to fall back into place and the old battle \nbetween US and THEM will resume. \n\nLogo\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Pardon me for this OOC message, but my thoughts on this will \nbe expressed. I think the problem here is that there is no one \ntaking enough action, number 1, there are no fights and no evil \nplans being cooked up by the evil team. There needs to be wars \nstarted like in the old days and some interesting stories that can \naffect everyone written as well. Number 2, the character limit \nprevents people from making their own storylines up, and thus people \nusually have to rely on hoping they won&#39;t get ignored and waiting \nfor their bots to receive orders from the commanders. Things similar \nto this are what killed my first Beast Wars RPG. But hey, I&#39;m not \ntelling you anything you don&#39;t already know...\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, February 25, 2003 10:55 AM\n&gt;   Subject: New poll for nbwrpg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Enter your vote today!
