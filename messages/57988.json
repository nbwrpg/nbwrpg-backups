He just stood, \nwaiting for her proframming to be restored, for his wife to come back \nto him. He is brought out of his trance by the cribs signal. Elita \nwas awake.\n\nRodimus Prime: Azure, Yggdrasil, excuse me. I&#39;ll be right back, Elita \nhas just woken up.\n\nRodimus heads to his quarters, where he finds Elita in the crib. He \npicks her up.\n\nRodimus Prime: Hello there, lil&#39; one. Let&#39;s take a little walk. I&#39;ll \nget you some energon and food at the mess hall, and then maybe mommy \nwill be back by then.\n\nRoddy walks out going to the mess hall. This gave Elita a new chance \nto look around new areas of the ship.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Elita::\n&gt; \n&gt; ELita woke up and yawed, she looked around and though where daddy \n&gt; could be.
