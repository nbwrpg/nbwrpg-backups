She wrapped her arm \naround his as they walked towards the entrance.  She was purring, not \nonly for him, but because she was enjoying herself. She wasn&#39;t sure \nhow te assignment would go at first, but she had under estimated \nherself.  Allwas going smoothly for her.

I&#39;ll lead the way.&quot; he said, flashing a \n&gt; friendly smile, walking for the door, but at a pace that would take \na \n&gt; few more cycles needed to get out of the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n\n"}}
