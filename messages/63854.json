I will need a new name. Hmm, what\nabout... &quot; She tried not to choke as she let the name escape from her\nvocal systems. &quot;......Kestral.&quot;  She didn&#39;t like it, but it did sound\nMaximal-ish. &quot;Yes, Kestral, a small winged bird of prey. Smallest of\nthe hawks. Perhaps that might work.&quot;  She let her optics glance at\nPerceptor. She wondered if he didn&#39;t feel sick to his metabolic\nprocessors as much as she did. &quot;Kestral. Kes for short.&quot;  She\nshuttered. &quot;Ick, well, let&#39;s hurry up and get this over with. The less\ntime I have to be a Maximush the better.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perpeptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; The male, Pulled a semi destroyed maxi-pod that it was in storage\nbut it would be enough to give at Reclusa a new beast form and pass\nher as a new maximal and left it close the tank with the drone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The beast form will be radmon&quot;replied Perceptor&quot;an tha will be the\nbest... every tech problem with this beast form  can give ya an excuse\nto visit CR-rooms...

Proceed.&quot;  She laid\n&gt;   down on the table.  &quot;One last thing. Once I am in the other bot,\n&gt;   you&#39;ll need to place my form in the pod and put me out so they may\n&gt;   find me.&quot;  She smiled, then frowned. She didn&#39;t like having to do\n&gt;   this, but her revenge seemed to demand it. &quot;Uh, just what will I look\n&gt;   like when I finally wake up and what form will I transform into? I\n&gt;   want to be a little familiar with what I&#39;ll be so I don&#39;t give myself\n&gt;   away from the start.&quot; The cold table gave it&#39;s last bit a reasurance\n&gt;   to her before she would start her next adventure.\n\n\n\n"}}
