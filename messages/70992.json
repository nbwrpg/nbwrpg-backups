He thinks of a way to signal him w=\r\nithout drawing attention to himself or the others.  It was critical.  He ke=\r\neps his weapons down, and sends an encrypted message back to Noctorro. \n\n&quot; =\r\nYou&#39;re right, I&#39;m not exactly perfect, and help would gladly be appreciated=\r\n.  I have an idea.  While I have you on an encrypted signal, I best let you=\r\n know to start moving in now.  But try to remain unseen, move in gradually,=\r\n and quietly.  If you can, send in several fuzors in at a time, and in phas=\r\nes, send in others, according to their skills and expertise.  I will contin=\r\nue to hold my position here.&quot;\n\nNight Shift and Straight Shot keep quiet. Th=\r\ney could tell Tucson was in thought, and somehow thinking up a strategy to =\r\nget them out of their bind.  He now had to send a message to Legacy.\n\n&quot;Lega=\r\ncy, if you can hear me, I strongly suggest that you heed my demands and vac=\r\nate immediately. You are endangering the lives of Nightlight and the others=\r\n, and those who endanger my comrades, deserve not to be among them.  Althou=\r\ngh, I will be willing to meet with you privately in a remote location of yo=\r\nur choice.  But not now.  Now is not the time.  Heed my words now and thing=\r\ns will not be difficult.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Uproar hears Rodimus, and trots=\r\n over to him, looking a bit confused.  Quickstride looks over to him as wel=\r\nl.\n\n&quot; Sorry for the fuss, hey, what&#39;s go&#39;n on?  Why won&#39;t the Ark open for =\r\nus?&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks over to him.\n\n&quot;Legacy is holding the Ark hostage, I=\r\n think, or at least that&#39;s what I got from the last message from Lord Elder=\r\n.&quot;\n\nUproar looks to the Ark and back at Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Whew, I&#39;m glad you stopp=\r\ned me, Sir.  No tell&#39;n what kind of attack I could&#39;ve met up with.  Okay, I=\r\n&#39;m definitely in on helping you out.  But how are we gonna get the Ark back=\r\n without getting blown ta scrap?&quot;  \n\nQuickstride looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Yeah, =\r\nwhat he said, how are we gonna get outa this mess?  This is something neith=\r\ner one of us has ever encountered.&quot; \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Supe=\r\nr Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; *Near to the Black Tower:*\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ns Tuscon and the rest lay down their weapons, the other soldiers move to\n&gt; =\r\nencircle the Maximals and the Autobots. Insecticon, Bruticus-X, and Iguanus=\r\n\n&gt; moved in almost eagerly to pick up the mighty weapons that Tuscon has\n&gt; =\r\ndropped, while Inferno, the self proclaimed bodyguard of Hydras watched\n&gt; T=\r\nuscon carefully, his optic ready to spot treachery.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quietly a short me=\r\nssage is sent to Tuscon, &quot;Tuscon.&quot; The deep voice of\n&gt; Noctorro, the leader=\r\n of the Maximal Fuzors can be heard, &quot;My team is here.\n&gt; Rodimus sent us to=\r\n aid you. None too soon it would seem.&quot; Noctorro&#39;s words\n&gt; are grim, a sold=\r\nier&#39;s humor in them. &quot;We await your signal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Injector=\r\n, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike move to do\n&gt; the same with Kup, Ni=\r\nghtshift, Straightshot, Talon and the others.\n&gt; Skyshadow, the leader of th=\r\ne Predacon Fuzors just watches with a gloating\n&gt; look on his face, it is al=\r\nmost as if he wants them to attack and keep the\n&gt; battle going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwh=\r\nile Phobia and several sweeps keep an eye on things from the air,\n&gt; while T=\r\nerrorsaur and Waspinator landed, ready to help out as needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the s=\r\name time Legacy processed Tuscon&#39;s command for him to leave the Ark.\n&gt; Ther=\r\ne was a long pause, and then the temporal guardian&#39;s cold voice comes\n&gt; acr=\r\noss the channel, &quot;I will not comply with your command. I have been tasked\n&gt;=\r\n with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Deepstryke transmits to Hydras, &quot;Hydras. I=\r\n am picking up an encrypted\n&gt; transmissions to and from Tuscon, he is attem=\r\npting to communicate with the\n&gt; others. I am generating a radio dampening f=\r\nield now in this area. Only the\n&gt; Predacons will be able to transmit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; *Meanwhile inside the Black Tower:*\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord&#39;s attempt to open fir=\r\ne on the Scourge was met with a measure of\n&gt; futility. Scourge just stepped=\r\n away from the opening that Windlord fired out\n&gt; from and let the shots go =\r\nharmlessly into a bulkhead, scorching it only\n&gt; slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; However that=\r\n slight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Trap time to\n&gt; scurry furth=\r\ner into their crawl space and find an interior bulkhead to hide\n&gt; behind.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice said from the outside. There was a pause and t=\r\nhen,\n&gt; &quot;Cyclonus, they have fled into the walls.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was another pa=\r\nuse, and then Scourge chuckled, &quot;Of course. I will be\n&gt; ready for them.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; From further inside the crawl space the sounds of chittering could be he=\r\nard,\n&gt; and then several groups of optics could be seen in the distance comi=\r\nng\n&gt; towards Rat Trap and Windlord. In the darkness their shapes could only=\r\n be\n&gt; barely made out, but they looked like black metallic spiders, Hydras&#39;=\r\n wall\n&gt; guardians!\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Rat Trap may recognize them from last time. A=\r\nlso keep in mind that Rat\n&gt; Trap and Windlord should be in beast mode. They=\r\n would have to be to fit\n&gt; inside the crawl space. In the toon the Beast Mo=\r\ndes did not have offensive\n&gt; weaponry, except for teeth and claws)\n&gt; \n&gt; *Ou=\r\ntside the Ark:*\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was positioned in a small grove of trees, duck=\r\ning down behind\n&gt; several large rocks. He gives Quickstride a quizzical loo=\r\nk as the equine\n&gt; Maximal sniffed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff revea=\r\nls nothing wrong.)\n&gt; \n&gt; He was about to let Quickstride in on what he had p=\r\nlanned when Uproar\n&gt; appeared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar=\r\n&#39;s conclusion that it\n&gt; was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn=\r\n&#39;t know that much about\n&gt; Legacy, having only seen him briefly while being =\r\nrescued and repaired, there\n&gt; was nothing to hint that this attack was Lega=\r\ncy&#39;s doing. He was about to say\n&gt; something when Uproar ran towards the Ark=\r\n to be let in . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, wh=\r\nat seemed like a round bolt of lightening\n&gt; appeared, sending Uproar flying=\r\n several yards through the air, to land\n&gt; heavily on the ground! Evidently =\r\nthe Ark shielding was still in place, and\n&gt; it was not allowing anyone in.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here! If we are going to get back i=\r\nn,\n&gt; then we need to work together. That shield is supposed to hold off all=\r\n the\n&gt; Predacon forces. We are not going to get in by brute force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n Rodimus talked three other Maximals seemed to almost materialize out of\n&gt; =\r\nthe underbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first was Win=\r\ng Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an old\n&gt; Maximal stratagi=\r\nst and military teacher, who from the brownish feathers\n&gt; along his frame t=\r\nurned into some sort of eagle.\n&gt; \n&gt; The next was Leo II, (\n&gt; http://en.acad=\r\nemic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconvoy_gathering.jpg ) the\n&gt; adopted son of L=\r\nio Convoy, and who looked much like him, and who had\n&gt; obviously picked up =\r\nmany of his mannerisms. His body was powerfully built\n&gt; and heavily armored=\r\n. He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.=\r\nnet/wiki/Ramulus) who had like the\n&gt; others been on patrol for a while, sur=\r\nveying the area and trying to keep it\n&gt; free from Predacon invasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhey also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the other\n=\r\n&gt; two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well=\r\n let&#39;s get out of sight, and\n&gt; then we can discuss it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *Meanwhile Ins=\r\nide the Ark:*\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor had received Tuscon&#39;s message and sent attempt=\r\ned to send a message\n&gt; to Lord elder, however at the moment there was no an=\r\nswer from the elder\n&gt; Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Legacy was still stand=\r\ning in the med lab along with the\n&gt; others, his single optic glowing in the=\r\n darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It would seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being he=\r\nld at minimal\n&gt; levels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall pa=\r\nnel nearest\n&gt; Nightlight. A small light blinked, indicating her spark was s=\r\ntill online,\n&gt; but that there was not enough power to reboot her systems.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness, lit =\r\nby\n&gt; his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised his r=\r\night\n&gt; hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit=\r\n light\n&gt; from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the room was\n=\r\n&gt; illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locate a back o=\r\nut\n&gt; or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s message=\r\n came in. He turned to look at Santon, Bump\n&gt; and Perceptor, a look of disb=\r\nelief momentarily flashing across his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy straightened as his=\r\n cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will not\n&gt; comply with your comman=\r\nd. I have been tasked with  . . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;  . .\n&gt; . the protection of =\r\nthe Ark as well as that of the Matrix. I will not\n&gt; knowingly leave the Ark=\r\n undefended or the Matrix in the hands of another.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to l=\r\nook at his console as he understoodf what happened.\n&gt; Communications had be=\r\nen cut part way through his message. He turned to look\n&gt; at the others, his=\r\n single optic cold, &quot;It is illogical to believe that I\n&gt; would attempt to h=\r\narm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPreston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
