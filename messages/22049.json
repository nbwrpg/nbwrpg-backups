He glances at Najah. &quot;Torture \nnever gives the best results, Najah.&quot;\n\nHe looks back at Lady Hawk. If Squizzy could replicate the \nexperiments, then Lady Hawk would obvioustly not be needed. A bot was \nalways useful, yes, but not one that would run away first chance he \nor she got, and Zardus had a feeling that Lady Hawk would do just \nthat.\n\n&quot;Hmm.. Squizzy denied of wanting to copy your experiments, and since \nI know the programming that is running through her head, I am fairly \nsure I can believe her. This ship has many labs, I can allow you to \nwork at one, away from Squizzy. But you would be well guarded by the \nship.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk frowned, obviously Squizzy had denied wanting credit for \nher\n&gt; experiments. &quot;I attacked the mongoose because I thought she had \nintentions\n&gt; on my experiments.&quot; An echo filled her head as she could have sworn \nthat\n&gt; she&#39;d used this argument before. &quot;She is the only one who \nunderstood them\n&gt; and the only one capable of stealing them, If she took over then \nyou&#39;d no\n&gt; longer have use for me.&quot; Lady Hawk smiled a wicked smile in the \ncrack of her\n&gt; beak, &quot;I know what happens to bots that have worn out thier use.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
