Like him, the sight of Dark Rodimus was enough to\n&gt; dim her trust in the real Rodimus Prime as she remembers what had happened\n&gt; to him in the past.  She opens a com link to Tucson directly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think ya might have ta take leadership \n&gt; privileges\n&gt; away from Rodimus.  He&#39;s turned evil again.  And I don&#39;t think Nightshift \n&gt; or\n&gt; anyone else is gonna trust him after this.  I know I won&#39;t. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson gets her call while holding onto Noctorro, flying him back to where\n&gt; the other injured Fuzors are to stand guard until help got to them.  His\n&gt; eyes narrow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I was afraid of this, Noctorro.  Rodimus has been taken again.  Straight\n&gt; Shot is right, he can&#39;t be trusted.  And he accuses me of not being in my\n&gt; right of mind..  Not good, not good at all.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He continues his flight while carefully tending to his comrade.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD � TALON&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon was shocked about the last things that had happened and followed\n&gt; Tucson in silence\n\nOOC: Keep in mind that while Noctorro about 5-6� tall as oppose to\nTuscon�s 10� but he is still a significant weight to carry. Tuscon can\ncarry him or let him fly on his own, but caring for him as in trying\nto bind his injuries or something is not possible while in flight.\n\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the damaged Fuzors and I will\n&gt; stand guard with them until help arrives.  In the mean time, Rodimus has\n&gt; fallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if he is barred from\n&gt; leadership duties until further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, \n&gt; but\n&gt; right now he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell Bump to secure Nightlight in the med\n&gt; bay and put the Ark in immediate lockdown. We can&#39;t afford to take any\n&gt; chances.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW � LEO&gt;\n\n�Understood.� Was LEO PRIME�s response. Evidently there was more he\nwanted to say, but he was unable to say it at the moment, perhaps\nbecause NIGHTLIGHT was still close by.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD � NIGHTSHIFT&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift continues to keep his doors locked and engine in drive for \n&gt; quick\n&gt; escape if need be.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Dark Rodimus get to Elita.  If\n&gt; anything he knew that returning her to the Ark would also put his other\n&gt; comrades at risk.  That too was out of the question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I don&#39;t think so, Punk, you ain&#39;t puttn one mean aft hand on anyone if I\n&gt; can help it!  You gotta outrun me first before ya even THINK about gett&#39;n\n&gt; your hands on her!   Hold on tight kid, I think we&#39;re in for a little car\n&gt; chase.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD � Elita&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What happened to My daddy!!!???&quot;said Elita almost sobbing\n\n\n&lt;NEW � DARK RODIMUS&gt;\n\nIt is as if DARK RODIMUS could hear ELITA�s cry � his optics\nbrightening, his wicked smile getting ever that much wider as he still\nlooked in her direction as NIGHTSHIFT backed and turned away.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD � HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So Prime are you leaving us?&quot;hissed hydras&quot;Unlucky, Cyclonus is missing \n&gt; too\n&gt; and an old pal is willing to help, and this is over us&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras send an encoded message that said &quot;we have to allied to MAximals in\n&gt; order to deal with this, Dark Rodimus is back and not under my control&quot; \n&gt; then\n&gt; he send another encoded to Scourge &quot;Keep an eye in the child, in a \n&gt; driscrete\n&gt; way&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW � DARK RODIMUS, WASPINATOR, SCOURGE & SWEEPS&gt;\n\nBeing that SCOURGE and the sweeps stood between DARK RODIMUS and ELITA\nDARK RODIMUS made no move to chase her down, although anyone who knows\nhim is well aware of the fact that there are few faster than he across\nthe open ground, except perhaps BLURR.\n\n�I read you.� SCOURGE sent back to HYDRAS. �We have Dark Rodimus about\nsurrounded. Shall we bring him in? The child is escaping with\nNightshift. They should be coming back towards you.&quot; There was a pause\nbefore SCOURGE asked the real and important question, &quot;Where is\nCyclonus, wasn�t he with Rodimus?�\n\nMeanwhile HYDRAS also got a call back from CRYOTEK, �What do you mean\nworking with the Maximals? What�s going on?�\n\nOOC: I will be moving Tuscon and whomever is with him to a new thread\nsoon as they have seperated from the main group.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
