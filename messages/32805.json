He\n&gt; swears to himself. This was quite enough. Megatron didn&#39;t say to\n&gt; destroy, he said to attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Decepticons, we&#39;ve done enough damage,&quot; he says aloud, since\n&gt; communication was still being jammed by the Element. Speakers on the\n&gt; front of his vehicle mode project his voice all over the \nbattlefield,\n&gt; &quot;Lets get out of here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that he looks around and turns toward the Decepticon base, \nflying\n&gt; off toward it but looking back to see if there were any Decepticons\n&gt; that would need help getting back.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Razorclaw::\n&gt; &gt; The explosions envelope the area around Razorclaw.

He notices his charred armour, and wonders how \n&gt; &gt; much more of this he can take, how soon to pull out. &lt;Where&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; Autofire?&gt; he thinks, his eyes flicking around from the enemy he \n&gt; &gt; was fighting to the rest of the battle field.\n\n\n"}}
