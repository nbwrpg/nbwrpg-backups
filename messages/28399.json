A curious black head with brown eyes appears through \n&gt; the opening first awakening to a world of white. &quot;Whoa... where am \n&gt; I?&quot; The bot pushes the cover the rest of the way off of the pod and \n&gt; gets out. &quot;I&#39;d better find my allies quickly,&quot; says the bot to \nherself, \n&gt; &quot;I know, I&#39;ll send out an encrypted signal.&quot; The bot transforms \ninto \n&gt; a lynx and sprints to the top of the mountain she is on. Soon, a \n&gt; encrypted signal on the Maximal frequency starts coming from the \n&gt; top of a mountain in the Rockies: \n&gt; # Maximals, I am Lynxiz and I am in need of assistance. I am not \n&gt; sure where I am othat than a mountain. You should be able to \n&gt; locate me with your computers with the location. # \n&gt; &quot;Now I will wait.&quot; She finishes.\n\n\n"}}
