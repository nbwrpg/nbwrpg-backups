She turned and faced the console of the\n&gt; drill.  She smiled to herself.\n&gt; &quot;Maybe he isn&#39;t that bad after all.&quot;  She was pleased.  He was actually\n&gt; being nice to her.  Then she looked at the drill.  It wasn&#39;t\ndissintagrating\n&gt; the rock anymore.  She stopped and climbed down.  She moved infront and\n&gt; looked at the hole.  She could see daylight shining through. She ran back\nto\n&gt; the drill and enlarged the hole so that a bot could walk through it. She\n&gt; moved the drill back and walked outside.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm, not bad if I do say so myself.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She then realized that for this to be a secret way out, she would have to\n&gt; cover it up.  She went back and looked for Quickstrike.  She would need\nhis\n&gt; strength to help lift the hatch for her to weld it to a frame.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; GIVE YOUR WIFE A BREAK!
