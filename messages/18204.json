That would probably make my life a whole lot\n&gt; easier.  About the pelvis, say I blow up someone&#39;s pelvis, that takes care\nof\n&gt; their legs as well, making it so they are VERY badly damaged and immobile.\n&gt; The Mafia only has five members?  Someone told me they had over twenty)\n&gt;\n&gt; (Also, all shots at Chaos and Minion hit, but they ignore them, and still\n&gt; form War Machine)\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor/Punch/Unitron/Sixshot/Ares/Demon Wulf/Flesh\n&gt; Ripper/Dark Claw/The Oblitercons/Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron powers up his engines as Stronghold&#39;s bolt makes a small dent in\nhis\n&gt; armor.  Driving full speed, he fired off another blast from his cannon in\n&gt; tank mode at Stronghold.  He saw another gestalt, which didn&#39;t phase him\nall.\n&gt;  He also heard the calls for retreat by the enemy.  He would make their\n&gt; retreat a harsh one.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf watched Gigas stand his ground as he was hit.  Raising his\nsword,\n&gt; Demon Wulf frowned as he saw Sixshot engage Gigas.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Sixshot (his type of Transformer is STAG, not name, sorry &#39;bout that) took\n&gt; off, getting cut in the front left paw.  Flapping his wings, he roared\n&gt; loudly.  &quot;Ares!  Need a lift?&quot; he yelled as he saw the pesky ants (Chosen\n&gt; Ones and Mafia) running to retreat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Transforming to space fighter mode, a burned Ares (from Grenade&#39;s\nfireballs)\n&gt; hopped into Sixshot&#39;s cockpit, the cockpit closing and lifting off into\nthe\n&gt; air, weapons powering up.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw ignored Shokaract&#39;s grenade as the weapon of destruction\nexploded\n&gt; against the Alliance base&#39;s shields, bringing it down a few percents.\nDark\n&gt; Claw transformed into his alternate mode.  A large black vehicle that ten\n&gt; feet long, had treads and wheels, it seemed to have a cockpit shaped like\na\n&gt; single claw.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the sides were laser cannons, and in the back a single missile\nlauncher.\n&gt; Roaring to life, Dark Claw began his pursuit of the enemy.  He just hoped\n&gt; this mode didn&#39;t guzzle to much fuel, or he might have to walk a ways.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper watched Shokaract retreat with Serge.  The Vok warrior\n&gt; transformed into his beast mode, a hyena, and slowly padded his way\nforward.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One barrel rolled, the two missiles exploding close to him, covering\nhim\n&gt; flames.  The jet landed as he heard the call to retreat, and saw several\n&gt; Mafia and Chosen Ones retreat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hiss!  Get over here and get inside!&quot; he yelled, his cockpit opening.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss cursed as Shokaract ran like a coward, not even taking the time to\n&gt; return fire.  He would die for his stupidity.  Hiss ran as fast as his\nlegs\n&gt; could carry him, hopping into Dark One&#39;s cockpit.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer laughed, letting himself descend, using his wings to\nblock\n&gt; the few shots that would&#39;ve blown his head apart.  Moving his wings down,\n&gt; Nemesis saw the two other bots retreating.  &quot;Cowards...&quot; he spat out,\nfiring\n&gt; twenty-five rapid laser blasts at the retreating Sharpedge.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot slowly got up, shaking his.  &quot;What, have to retreat!?&quot; he\nyelled,\n&gt; lifting off into the air full speed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro stopped near Diskus, seeing he was down and left alone.  He saw\n&gt; Serpentor slowly approaching.  &quot;YOU!  Finish him off, or put him in a\nbrig!\n&gt; I&#39;m going after the retreating attackers!&quot; he yelled, driving as fast as\nhe\n&gt; could in his tank mode, firing off a single fire ball at Shokaract, to\nmess\n&gt; with his mind, hopefully.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown transformed to robot mode, watching Doom Ice retreat.  Taking\nout\n&gt; his sonic blast, Breakdown fired a sonic blast that was in the shape of an\n&gt; arc at the retreating Doom Ice, Breakdown going to a run, pursuing his\n&gt; possibly next victim.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger revved up his motor, going after the retreating forces.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
