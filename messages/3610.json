A slight sneer appeared on her upper lip, just \nannoyed at her situation. She didn&#39;t like being near so many bots. She \nwasn&#39;t a bot that enjoyed the company of others. She turned into a harsh \nloner. That was the only option she had. That, or death.\n\nShe didn&#39;t like following the instant a bot snapped his fingers, but perhaps \nit was the only thing she could do right now. She had to follow Megatron&#39;s \nevery word or be shot. She had taken her risks and took them hard. She \nactivated her flight mode and came to his side, hovering when he stopped. \nThe upper half of her fighting staff stuck out from her back as it always \ndid.\n\n&quot;If you don&#39;t know anything, then take me to a bot that does,&quot; she said to \nhim. &quot;But tell me what you can.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
