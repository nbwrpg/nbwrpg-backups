He wasn&#39;t sure exactly what \nthat thud \n&gt; was or why he was asleep but he was pretty sure it had to do with \nexcess \n&gt; energon, Meteara, and a certain sphere.  He looks around and \neventually \n&gt; crawls over to Meteara.  &quot;Ma&#39;am, something seems to have fallen more \nor less \n&gt; on our heads.  As disturbing as this is, it seems like we should \ncheck it \n&gt; out.  In fact I&#39;m going to do that.&quot;  He taps some controls on his \narm and \n&gt; Horn walks over groggily. &quot;Whaddya want?&quot;  Firaxis was more than a \nlittle \n&gt; confused.  &quot;You can talk?&quot;  Horn looks at him apathetically.  &quot;It \ncertainly \n&gt; seems that way now doesn&#39;t it.  I suppose you want to investigate \nthat thud \n&gt; we just heard.&quot;  Firaxis nods dumbfounded.  &quot;Well lets go then,  \noopsI \n&gt; forgot, master.&quot;  Firaxis shakes his head and they head back to the \nsurface \n&gt; to investigate the third Artifact also known as Thud.\n\n\n"}}
