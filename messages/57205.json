Enough of this attitude, might I state it is rather rude! \n&gt; \n&gt; The idea of a movie, is rather high I think. Some I have heard of \nin the past \n&gt; have been nothing but rumors, little have I seen it as an official \nstatement \n&gt; by Hasbro. & with the boom of Transformers & their major \npopularity, & those \n&gt; in charge of the movie project, I state it as a high probability. \nAs this has \n&gt; been a topic for a while on some of the Transformers Forums & \npossibly at the \n&gt; BotCons. Supply & demand. \n&gt; \n&gt; Opinions are & will be voiced. If you don&#39;t agree with them, then \ndon&#39;t shoot \n&gt; down someone for it. Let alone the use of name calling & foul \nlanguage.

All of my mails \ndo anyway, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; please remember.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I honestly don&#39;t understand why this is great news. Whenever \nthey announce \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; stuff like this, I just become worried. VERY worried. What \nhappens if it \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sucks? I&#39;ll be VERY mad indeed. I think it&#39;ll be great news \nwhen the movie \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is out and DOESN&#39;T suck. I&#39;m honestly more excited about their \nnext line of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Transformers for 2004, their 20th anniversary line entitled \nTransformers \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Energon. I KNOW their toys will always be good. In case you \ndon&#39;t understand \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; where I&#39;m coming from, I thought Beast Wars was a good show. \nIt pailed in \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; comparison to the original Transformers, but it was good. \nHowever, it could \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have been SO much better as just an ordinary cartoon like the \noriginal \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Transformers instead of computer generation. So the idea \nbehind a live action \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; movie makes me think things like &quot;who&#39;s writing it? What&#39;s the \nbudget? Will \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hasbro watch over it? Will they make it as bad an adaptation \nas The Running \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Man?&quot; I know you&#39;re all thinking that I should be more \noptimistic, but \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve seen how characters can be completely warped, as proof \nof it occurred \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in Beast Machines. Forgive the fact that this mail was so \nlong. Also forgive \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the fact that I&#39;m still working on my upcoming storylines.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &lt;A \nHREF=&quot;mailto:EmprzAnastazia@a...&quot;&gt;EmprzAnastazia@a...&lt;/A&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A \nHREF=&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 11, 2003 7:50 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: OOC: Majorly great news!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hasbro has made an official press release of a Live Action \nTransformers \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; movie!
