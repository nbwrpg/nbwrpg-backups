She mentally scanned the\ncave, she only found one mental signature. Psychically she focused a around\nthe bot, she found nothing to move, she continues forward toward the bot,\nready for any action he&#39;d use against her. &quot;What is your name and faction?&quot;\nshe called out hoping Lunarpine would be there soon. (She knows he&#39;s close\nso she&#39;s keeping her distance but she is close enough to attack if you&#39;d\nlike.)\n\nLunarpine dug until the hole was big enough for his beast mode to slip\nthrough. He transformed to wolf and crawled inside. Once inside he\ntransformed back to bot mode. Slowly and carefully he made his way through\nthe cave keeping  Grizzlotrons scent upwind of his. Like a wolf stalking an\nelk he remained silent, ready to pounce at a moments notice. He tried to\ntelepathically reach Ice but her concentration was on the other bot.From:\nBeast Wars &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 09, 2001 6:32 AM\nSubject: Re: Say Welcome to Grizzltron\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   Grizzltron yells out to the Bot.  &quot;Be careful there should be some one\nelse here.
