Let me repost that last one there. *blushes* Eh heh.\n\nDarkMouse:: She saw Galvatron attack the dragon with the cat in it&#39;s \nclutches.  She turned and fired again on the dragon trying to turn \nher into mouse-crispies. She dodged one fireball,well, almost.  She \nstopped and sniffed the air. &quot;Something Burning?&quot;  She turned and saw \nthe tip of her tail on fire. &quot;YEEEEEEOOOOOOWWWWW!&quot; She started \npatting her tail trying to smother the fire.  When the fire was out, \nshe looked at her tail and a look of pain, remorse and great sorrow \ncrossed her face.  She cried,&quot;Look at my tail. My pretty tail,&quot; she \ncried. She then turned and looked at the dragon with a rage that \nwould have sent it to the pit if her optics had the power. &quot;YOU BURNT \nMY TAIL! PREPARE TO BE DELETED!!!&quot;\n\nShe transformed into mouse mode and springed up towards the dragon \nand tried to bite at it. Trying to latch on with her long, sharp \nincisers and sinking them into it&#39;s leg. &quot;DIE!!!&quot;\n\n\nPanzer::\nShe was still off line. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron watched as the lizard grabbed her. &quot;Oh hell no.&quot; He flew \noff after \n&gt; the lizard bot. He was much quicker with his advanced tecehnology \nand flew \n&gt; over him and stopped infront about 5 feet. He sent a power surge \nfrom his \n&gt; chest and a fire from both his hands. Trying hard not to hit the \nbot. God \n&gt; neptune crept behind the lizard attacking Dark Mouse and send  a  \nGrenade \n&gt; behind his back and it was set to explode about 5 inches from his \nback.\n\n\n"}}
