He will think he has always \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;been a Decepticon&quot;. What Megatron wasnt telling everyone, was that he was \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;also putting in a fail safe. At the Bodicons words, he turn around done, \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;and retracts his slithery mechanism. &quot;Yes I have big plans, and you five \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;will get to see some action, are you all fully energized?&quot; he asked. He \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;then responded to the comm links, &quot;Astroblast, refuel, we will need you \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;soon. Stunticons, you are all dismissed, Terrorcons, Terrorcons,&quot; Megatron \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;was having problems reaching them. He shut down his comm-link, and left the \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;room. &quot;Worry about Condor later Switchblade, we have a world to take.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
