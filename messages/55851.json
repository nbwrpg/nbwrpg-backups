She saw another drone and tried \nagain.  She crouched down and snuck up on the drone.  She waited \nuntill she was right next to it. She then leaned up and leaped. This \ntime, she landed right on top of the drone. But she wasn&#39;t centered \nand the drone tipped, She was hanging upside down while still keeping \nher claws in the drone. She looked around and whimpered. Then she \ncried &quot;BLACKFANG!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang: Next time, you should try to put more weight on your hind\n&gt; legs when you leap.

She went and looked. Another drone \nwas \n&gt; &gt; near \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by.  She saw it was about 60 yards away. She crouched down, \njust \n&gt; &gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang did.  She crawled up really slowly to the drone. \nShe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crawled up right under the drone. She went to pounce and \nbanged \n&gt; &gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head on the underside of the drone and fell the the ground.  \nShe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whimpered a bit and rubbed her head with her \npaw. &quot;Ohhwwwwiieee, \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hurrrtt.&quot; with a whine and a whimper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang saw that the puppy bot was going full frontal at \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She would get bored soon if she went on like this. He \n&gt; &gt; transformed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wolf mode and met her near a tree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang: You&#39;re enthusiastic, but you have to be careful \ntoo. \n&gt; &gt; Let \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; show you how to do this great, okay?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He squatted his large shape near the ground and advanced \nslowly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the bushed. There was a drones mere meters away. He \n&gt; &gt; moved\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly, silently, until he was just under the drone, on the \n&gt; &gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a shrub. Then, he jumped. Quick as a bullet, he leapt \njust \n&gt; &gt; over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drones and brought all his weight down on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang: I know you can do just as good. It might take \ntime, \n&gt; &gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know you can do it! Now it&#39;s your turn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
