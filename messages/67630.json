At the same time the rest of the mini=\r\nons have\ncome home: Cyclonus, Scourge, Deepstryke, Phobia, Nightrazor, Deci=\r\nbel,\nTumult and the sweeps. All assuming their positions, poised to attack\n=\r\nEarth on command. \n\nDeep his own chamber Vorpal sat on his throne, his own =\r\noptics poised\nover a view screen as it probed the earth for weaknesses. Sen=\r\nsors\nwatched the different Maximal and Predacon bases as well as the energy=\r\n\nores scattered across the Earth. His thoughts were dark and forboding,\nhis=\r\n optics lighting only as one of his chamber doors irised open\nrevealing the=\r\n purple form of Cyclonus. \n\nTall and terrible Cyclonus stepped into the roo=\r\nm, his movements calm\nand commanding. Something has changed about him since=\r\n he has returned\nfrom earth, something that Vorpal could not put a clawed f=\r\ninger on,\nbut he suspected. \n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Vorpal&#39;s voice echoed through the mass=\r\nive chamber. \n\n&quot;You know why I am here.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice while lacking the =\r\nvolume was\nno less powerful. \n\nVorpral nodded once, &quot;Yes. It is time.&quot; \n\nCy=\r\nclonus had completed his task, and yet there was more to be done.\nThe Earth=\r\n still had not been destroyed, and many Maximals and\nPredacons still lived.=\r\n The energy of the earth was still not ready for\nUnicron&#39;s consumption. \n\nW=\r\nith deliberate motions Vorpral tapped in command codes as once\ndarkened con=\r\nsoles lit up as power was applied. It was time for the\nnext step. \n\nCyclonu=\r\ns took his place and dropped to one knee, as Vorpral opened a\nchannel to a =\r\nplace far beyond the confines of this solar system.\n \n&quot;Lord Unicron!&quot; Vorpa=\r\nl and Cyclonus raised their voice in twined\nunison. &quot;We live to serve you! =\r\nWhat are your commands?&quot;\n\n&lt;TAG UNICRON!&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
