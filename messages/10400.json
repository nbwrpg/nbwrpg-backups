They were vast, deep, and housed some of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; most \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous prehistoric creatures anyone had seen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Among all the chaos of the bugs and aquatic life of the \nswamp, \n&gt; &gt; a long \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lost and forgotten stasis pod slipped from its peach and \nfloated to \n&gt; &gt; the bank \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a body of water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     The computer, now able to activate, began the DNA scanning \n&gt; &gt; process to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; select the beast mode of the protoform within. The sphere rose, \nand \n&gt; &gt; scanned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the vast area of the swamp. After a double pass, it selected \nthe \n&gt; &gt; most \n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful beast mode according to the habitat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     The sphere rejoined the pod, and the transformation began. \n&gt; &gt; Moments past \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the computer bagan to read off the data needed by the new \nform \n&gt; &gt; to survive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the beast wars.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     With a crack, the door opened and the new warrior crawled \nout \n&gt; &gt; of the pod \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and on to the bank of the swamp. He looked around. With the \n&gt; &gt; complete history \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the beast wars stored in his data banks, he would be able to \n&gt; &gt; handle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself in this new world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Looking, he said to himself, &quot;Ah, this beast mode shall \nmake a \n&gt; &gt; fine body. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now all I need to do is to transform.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Paralysis said the code word and his Predacon Beast Mode \n&gt; &gt; emerged. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; frog changed into an armored knight of the Predacon dynasty. He \nwas \n&gt; &gt; armed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a toxen gun, a semi-automatic pistol, and optic lasers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Ha! Now to contact the Predacons...and to end the reign of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Maximals!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
