He didn&#39;t think she&#39;d \ntake it so serioustly. It had only beed a small fall after all. He \nlooks into her eyes as she gives him her glare, wincing at her \nthoughts. She sounded waay more mad that he thought she was.\n\n-I d...- he begins, but then is interrupted by her thoughts as she \nlooks at the forest. His eyes widen. It had only been a small ride, \nand he had slowed down when she had asked him to! But no longer \ntrusting him just for that one thing?\n\nProwl sighs and follows Iron Raptor as she walks off into the forest. \nHe looks at her hair as it glints on her hair. Her thoughts had \neffectively killed his good mood.\n\n-Look, I...- Prowl is once again interrupted, this time by something \nrunning into Iron Raptor. His wing guns aim at the small bot. Prowl&#39;s \nwing orbs scan the area, alerting him of any action nearby.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Had to write fast, excuse the spelling mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor was glad that at least Prow had gotten the main thing \nfrom \n&gt; that slap, but she only growled when she head him chuckle. The \nsound muffled \n&gt; from the cape over her head.\n&gt; Her shaking had stopped, her spark still pounded but not nearly as \nbad as it \n&gt; had. Calm taking over...and being replaced by annoyance.\n&gt; She hated heights the Prowl knew that, yet he still dropped like a \nrock from \n&gt; the sky and scared her out of her wits...AGAIN!\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor simply sighs deeply, lifting the cape from her eyes and \nhead, \n&gt; throwing it back so that it would settle against the ground, then \nlooking at \n&gt; the trunks of the trees a bit as Prowl kneels down and\n&gt; sends his thoughts to her.\n&gt; Her blue eyes turning to him in a glare.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Well, next time when you decide to test them I&#39;M NOT WITH YOU!!!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She breaths another sigh  but keeps the glare, eventually getting \nto her \n&gt; feet and dusting herself off.\n&gt; Then noticing Prowls puppy eyes, only mannaging to get another \nglare from \n&gt; her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; That&#39;s never worked on me...and NO!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor leaned her weight on one leg as she continued to \nglare at \n&gt; Prowl, a look that a mother would give her son when she found out \nhe was \n&gt; throwing things around in the house, breaking something that was of \nvalue to \n&gt; her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; You know very well my fear of hights, but you STILL pulled that \nstunt! If \n&gt; you ever, EVER do something like that to me again I&#39;ll do way more \nthen just \n&gt; slap you!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked towards the forest.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; I&#39;ve also decided that I&#39;m walking back.I can&#39;t trust you \nanymore.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor didn&#39;t really want to hurt Prowls feeings or anything \nlike \n&gt; that, but he had to get it through his head that he couldn&#39;t just \njoke about \n&gt; anymore.\n&gt; This was a war that they were fighting, and good humour was \nwelcome, but not \n&gt; antics and showing off. If Prowl wanted to test his metal, he would \nhave to \n&gt; do it on his own time.\n&gt; Iron Raptor thought this too, so he would get the picture.\n&gt; Turning towards the direction where the signatures of the ship was \ncoming \n&gt; from, noticing three instead of just two. There must have been a \nstow-away, \n&gt; or even maybe a new Maximal for her to meet.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Now, we have to get to the ship, or what&#39;s left of it.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then began to move into the forest, her cape, \nsurprisingly, \n&gt; catching on nothing.\n&gt; Moving easily into the shadows, her armor soaking them up, or \nseeming to.\n&gt; But when she happened to pass under a ray of light which filtered \nin through \n&gt; the branches her air seemed to sparkle, her mind too focused on \nseeing her \n&gt; freinds again and making sure they were alright to notice.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
