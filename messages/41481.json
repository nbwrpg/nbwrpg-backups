It alerts Zardus of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Still at the meeting, Zardus silently replies to the Iron Fist, telling it\nto analize the transmission&#39;s format and forward it to him. He looks at\nOrchestra, waiting for a reply from the other bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The minion worked hard in his lab. The base creaked from non use and\n&gt; &gt; ignorement. he was disgusted by it. If his master had been here he would\n&gt; &gt; have never let it happen. The body was almost complete. It now only\nneeded\n&gt; &gt; its fule. The blood of a few hero bots to bring it to full power. He\nfelt the\n&gt; &gt; dark spark&#39;s precense. &quot;Its almost ready master. Do you wish to have all\nthe\n&gt; &gt; weapons you had before?&quot; The dark sent a obvious yes to the bots\nfrightened\n&gt; &gt; face. The dark spark pulsed over and over. He would soon be back and he\nwould\n&gt; &gt; set fire to the entire world if he had to to bring about his enemies.\nBut\n&gt; &gt; first he had to make a few allies. Brother Megatron had already been\n&gt; &gt; contacted. But another one he would soon need to speak with was Zardus.\nhe\n&gt; &gt; sent a typed message to his opticals. For he yet to have form so a\nvisual\n&gt; &gt; seems impossible. The typed message would read. &quot;Great leader of the\n&gt; &gt; alliance. I have never met you in person but we have spoken. I have long\nbeen\n&gt; &gt; very impressed by your skills as a leader. But defending the maximals I\nwas\n&gt; &gt; quite surprised by that. Non the less I am very interested to work with\nyou.\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunatly I am not complete but I will be soon. I will contact you\nthen.\n&gt; &gt; Until then good luck.&quot; The message ended and the dark spark waited for\nhis\n&gt; &gt; body to be finished. For when it was the world would never be the same\nagain\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
