He picks\nit\n&gt; up and dusts it off and scoops up some water from a puddle into the pot\nand\n&gt; pulls the flowers up and keeps the roots on. He then puts the flowers in\nthe\n&gt; pot along with a little dirt and hands it to Mantella. Drazom: I kept the\n&gt; roots on so it can bloom more then once. Mantella stares at it while not\n&gt; moving an inch. Drazom stares at the stiff Mantella. Then she eats a bug\n&gt; that was on one of the flowers.

Of course her troops would spare Iron Raptor, however,\nbut\n&gt; &gt; she walked to the base to say goodbye to her old friend Iron Raptor. She\n&gt; &gt; passed Ramhorn on the bridge, looking at him she laughed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Little Ramhorn, Maximal worshipper!&quot; Plintissa said. Plintissa walked\n&gt; away\n&gt; &gt; from the base, deciding to tell Iron Raptor goodbye over commlink.\n&gt; Plintissa\n&gt; &gt; and Dracona walked out and sat in the meadow.

It&#39;s time for some\n&gt; maiming.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Plintissa said. Dracona pulled out a heavy blaster rifle from her Cyber\n&gt; &gt; storage compartment and handed it to Plintissa.
