You can&#39;t \njust grab bots out of other bots&#39; hands. You can attempt to, but the \nother person has to post if the attempt was successful. You can&#39;t \nplace a time bomb and have it explode in the same post, you have to \nlet the other person reply. There were also some minor things about \ndoing too many things in one post. Anyways, watch yourselves next \ntime!\n\n\nPS (to everyone). I wasn&#39;t on yesterday cause I was recabling my \nhouse / setting up a new server. Some of you might have noticed that \nthe login script doesn&#39;t work right now. I&#39;m still battling with the \nserver to get that working. I wasn&#39;t on today cause I had work (yup, \nwork on a saturday sucks), and then a few friends came over and we \nhad an unplanned LAN party, which took up the rest of the time. I&#39;m \nkinda pooped so I&#39;ll make a few quick posts and then go to sleep. \nI&#39;ll post in full tomorrow, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Luzbel/Attilla::\n&gt; \n&gt; When Attilla saw what Galvatron had done, he cursed and quickly \nflew \n&gt; a way his brother before the bomb exploted, Luzbel didn&#39;t let go of \n&gt; Panzer and bomb damaged slighty his armor; after explotion, Luzbel \n&gt; landed in order to check Panzer&#39;s status; Attilla landed too, and \n&gt; walked some steps and stopped near his brother.\n&gt; \n&gt; While Luzbel did that, Attilla was on guard and ready to fight; \nthey \n&gt; didn&#39;t like that Galvatron didnt strike back or any other group of \n&gt; bots caught them unawared. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Galvatron stopped. &quot;You know what.....the hell with this.
