She was growing fond of him. But he was in a class of \nhis own.

As long as it&#39;s not aboard the Titanic.\n\nLunarpine continued to look at Shadow Wing, was it because of her\nbeautiful white feathers, or because of the animal she represented.\nEither way she was out of his class. (science joke.) They shared this\nworld, this land, this night, and most importantly, this journey.\n\n&quot;tell me again Shadow Wing, why are you helping me?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
