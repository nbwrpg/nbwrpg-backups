Liek I said, this is just a very modi=\r\nfied \n&gt; version \n&gt; &gt; of my previous post. Hopefully its a lil better at wor=\r\nking my \n&gt; &gt; character entrance. Much as I liked the other post, this has t=\r\no \nbe \n&gt; &gt; done, if only to make things better for the rest of you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (IC)\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; The pod bore the heat of atmospheric entry like a champi=\r\non, \n&gt; ripping \n&gt; &gt; through the thick prehistoric air of the planet Earth. =\r\nCarried \n&gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; the stasis pod&#39;s shell-like hull was a Maximal, stoi=\r\nc and \n&gt; courageous. \n&gt; &gt; He had been sent in the stasis pod to provide bac=\r\nkup warriors to \n&gt; &gt; Maximal groups on the planet Earth, where advancing Pr=\r\nedacon \n&gt; warriors \n&gt; &gt; are making their collection gambit a reality.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It came in low, lower than the computers of Cybertron had \n&gt; pr=\r\nedicted. \n&gt; &gt; On its current path it was headed for a rocky section of land=\r\n, \n&gt; near \n&gt; &gt; what seemed to be a large settlement of some sort. The readi=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt; blinked up against perpetual-thrust boosters of the pod, a \n&gt; relat=\r\nively \n&gt; &gt; older model. It was too late for stopping procedures. The pod wa=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; certain to crash into a thick rock face, a facet of a plateau. As \n&gt;=\r\n the \n&gt; &gt; reverse thrusters ignited as they were automated to do, the pod \n=\r\n&gt; fell \n&gt; &gt; into a spiralling tumble, uncontrolled and fast. The \n&gt; shuttle=\r\ncraft&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; computers began to malfunction, hard. One by one, in rapid \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; succession, the pod&#39;s systems went awry. The boosters, the \n&gt; &gt; navigatio=\r\nn, the communication, even certain life support systems \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the spa=\r\nrk of the Maximal. The scanners of the vehicle exploded to \n&gt; &gt; life amongs=\r\nt the terrible disconnections of systems, and the \n&gt; sensory \n&gt; &gt; orb was l=\r\naunched from the rear of the pod.\n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The small orb was relea=\r\nsed from a hatch that slid open. It flew \n&gt; &gt; upwards, and two small metall=\r\nic wings flipped out. It fell to the \n&gt; &gt; earth below incredibly quickly. I=\r\nt crashed into the soft ground \nof \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; watering hole. The orb began l=\r\nifting upwards, out of the water, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; powering up. Most of the suit=\r\ne was busted, very little or the \n&gt; device \n&gt; &gt; was intact or working. What=\r\n was operational was the uplink to the \n&gt; &gt; still-falling stasis pod, and a=\r\n very weak power core. It was \nabout \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; die and leave the protoform=\r\n inside the stasis pod stranded. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At that moment, a herd o=\r\nf elephants shot by in a stampede towards \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; watering hole. Caught i=\r\nn the scanner beam of the orb, a male bull \n&gt; &gt; elephant was passed over by=\r\n a small yellow light. The orb&#39;s \n&gt; network \n&gt; &gt; to the pod which still tum=\r\nbled across the Africa-Asia regions of \n&gt; &gt; prehistoric Earth activated and=\r\n immediately beamed the DNA data \nto \n&gt; &gt; the protoform itself, bypassing t=\r\nhe computer systems. The robot \n&gt; &gt; inside still lived.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In=\r\nside the pod, a rapid transformation took place. The \n&gt; transformer&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbody was melded in a slick metallic form of beast and machine. \n&gt; Many \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n minutes passed as the pod shot into a rock face in Asia. The \n&gt; direct \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; uplink had gone straight into the robot. It hadn&#39;t been done \n&gt; before. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Who was to know if the former Autobot would emerge deranged, \n&gt; &gt; defor=\r\nmed, or whether he would even emerge at all. Almost thirty \n&gt; &gt; minutes pas=\r\nsed as the protoform to shape and did its best to \n&gt; filter \n&gt; &gt; out many u=\r\nnnecessary things. \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  And then an eruption of fire exploded =\r\nforth in a shower of \nenergy \n&gt; &gt; and stone chips. A lone robot stood in a =\r\ncarved out section of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; rock plateau, twin ion cannons in hand. Wit=\r\nh suddenness belying \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; large size, the bot shifted to beast mode =\r\nwith a spoken command. \n&gt; His \n&gt; &gt; body formed that of a huge grey elephant=\r\n, and the large beast \nmade \n&gt; &gt; his way down the newly formed hill of rock=\r\n. Lost in thought as he \n&gt; &gt; climbed down carefully, the Maximal beast was =\r\namazed at the \n&gt; immediate \n&gt; &gt; qualities of his transformations, rapid and=\r\n unstrained. The \n&gt; &gt; transformer&#39;s amazing switch to robot mode was a curi=\r\nosity even \nto \n&gt; &gt; the seasoned former Autobot. He shouldn&#39;t have been abl=\r\ne to \nswitch \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; quickly after gaining a beast mode to his protoform=\r\n, but in fact, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; did. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chalking it up to his age =\r\nand stubbornness, for now at least, he \n&gt; &gt; continued down the crushed rock=\r\n pathway he&#39;d created out of the \n&gt; &gt; shattered stone leveled by his ion ca=\r\nnnons. He hopped from on \n&gt; large \n&gt; &gt; piece to another at one point, and i=\r\nt seemed the impact shifted \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; rock. It slid off its little crutch=\r\n of stone and slid the rest of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; way down.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Conv=\r\nenient.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking up and around, and marveled at the beauty=\r\n of this small \n&gt; &gt; world. The Decepticon and Predacon forces on this world=\r\n were \ngoing \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; destroy it if left alone. He couldn&#39;t let that happ=\r\nen, in his \n&gt; mind. \n&gt; &gt; As soon as he found his commanding officer, a comp=\r\nuter, and the \n&gt; &gt; mysteries of his change came a little closer to being so=\r\nlved, he \n&gt; &gt; would eliminate as many as possible. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Only a h=\r\nalf mile away, visible to the silvery savanna animal, was \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; Autob=\r\not base. Running towards it at full speed, he made a beeline \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne island stronghold. It would be up to him to discover what the \n&gt; &gt; base w=\r\nas and who ran it. If it was Autobot or Maximal, maybe he \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt; fin=\r\nd help. If it was Predacon or Decepticon=85 well, Skullhammer \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n indeed get to test out his robot form again.\n\n\n"}}
