She seemed to know what \nshe was doing, it&#39;d be a waist to reprogramm her and possibly lose \nthose skills.\n\n&quot;Third would be about accurate, I guess,&quot; he says, walking after \nher, &quot;We don&#39; really have defined ranks after second.&quot;\n\nHe realizes that they were walking away from the CR chambers. &quot;The CR \nroom&#39;s back that way,&quot; he says, pointing behind him.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Diamond::\n&gt; \n&gt; She knew that what he said about the drain was most likely correct \n&gt; and not a bluff.  She knew she had to use her wits.  This bot \nseemed \n&gt; very intelegent and possably could make a strong ally.  He had said \n&gt; he was high up in the ranks. This opened a window of opertunity for \n&gt; her.  She transformed into bot mode and walked over to Devilduer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Very well, I shall accompany you to where ever you need me.  I am \nin \n&gt; need of a cr.&quot; she said, looking down at her burn marks and leaking \n&gt; gun shot holes. \n&gt; &quot;I shall join you.  You said earlier that you were high up in the \n&gt; ranks? That you make you...what..second, third in command?&quot;  She \n&gt; bowed and showed proper respect to a higher ranking officer. On \n&gt; Cybertron, he wuld have been bowing to her, but then again, she \n&gt; wasn&#39;t on Cybertron.  &quot;I shall follow you commander.&quot;  she stood up \n&gt; and looked at him.  Taking a few steps closer to him, she said in a \n&gt; hushed voice, &quot;And I meant what I said earlier, we would have made \na \n&gt; good team back home.&quot; She smiled at him and then started to walked \n&gt; down the hallway. Then she turned and faced him, &quot;Ah, which way to \n&gt; your CR room?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
