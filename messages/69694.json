I =\r\nam also keeping Rodimus for the moment to work out a few things with Airly.=\r\n\n\nI am also utilizing other characters that I was temping before I left suc=\r\nh as: Lord Elder, and Zarak/Skorponok to keep some plot elements running, b=\r\nut they may fade back into the backround as things quiet a little. And of c=\r\nourse there were the minions I left in NPC status and Myrmidon who is in th=\r\ne background. \n\nYou will probrably note that as time goes along some of the=\r\nse other characters I play will fade into and out of the backround, and I w=\r\nill only be playing a few at a time as people need RP partners or events un=\r\nfold. For example, Legacy tends to stay at the Ark for the most part, and w=\r\nill eventually return there unless something happens to change that.\n\nIf an=\r\nyone wants to run one of the minions NPC&#39;s or any of the characters I am te=\r\nmping, they are more than welcome, so long as they let me know first :)\n\nAn=\r\nd for the record, I am all for consolidation of the factions for the moment=\r\n. Perhaps Hydras could have userped control of the Bushido Predacons and su=\r\nch, and others, while the other Maximal clans come together under one banne=\r\nr?? Food for thought! :)\n\nAnyways, game on!\n\nPreston\n\n \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I started working on updati=\r\nng the web site tonight.  We have a lot of\n&gt; characters that have gone inac=\r\ntive.  I know that usually when someone is not\n&gt; active in the group, other=\r\n players pick up those characters.  I&#39;ve been\n&gt; reading through some of our=\r\n posts over the last two years and I&#39;m noticing\n&gt; that we&#39;re getting really=\r\n confused with all these locations and characters.\n&gt; I know I have some cor=\r\ne characters that I really enjoy posting for, then I\n&gt; have some less impor=\r\ntant characters that I keep posting out of obligation;\n&gt; I&#39;m noticing other=\r\n people do this too.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I think we should do is each come up with a =\r\nlist of the characters we\n&gt; want to post for, and put aside some of the mor=\r\ne minor characters until the\n&gt; group gets more active and we can manage mul=\r\ntiple storylines.  The inactive\n&gt; characters can remain in the background a=\r\nnd we can always bring them back\n&gt; when we want to.  Additionally, we have =\r\nsome major characters like Hydras\n&gt; and the Faction leaders that I think pe=\r\nople do need to post for.\n&gt; *(Magicquartz,\n&gt; don&#39;t worry about this since y=\r\nou&#39;re just getting started)*\n&gt; \n&gt; Take a look at this list and see if I&#39;m m=\r\nissing anyone, if you have time\n&gt; please update your characters:\n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.wikihost.org/w/nbwrpg_wiki/character_list/  (I&#39;m only halfway\n&gt; through =\r\nmy updates as of this email)\n&gt; \n&gt; Action plan:\n&gt; \n&gt;    - Lord Perseus (Pasi=\r\nficus Maximals) and Lord Razorwing (Silver Wings\n&gt;    Maximals) should cons=\r\nolidate into one Maximal group and either choose one\n&gt;    leader, or have c=\r\no-leaders and let the two factions operate separately but\n&gt;    in a more co=\r\noperative fashion.  I&#39;m going to have Perseus give a call for\n&gt;    all maxi=\r\nmals to get on the shuttle.\n&gt;    - Iron Skull Predacons with Jotuun have no=\r\nt been really active and there\n&gt;    really aren&#39;t very many members.  We sh=\r\nould just leave them as they are and\n&gt;    not worry about them for now.\n&gt;  =\r\n  - Bushido Predacons have been inactive for a while, however I started a\n&gt;=\r\n    thread with Celeron a few months ago.  I plan to continue that and have=\r\n him\n&gt;    investigate the cause of the Tidal Wave which wrecked Atlantis.  =\r\nWe can\n&gt;    probably also leave the rest of the faction inactive for now.\n&gt;=\r\n    - The Watchers, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with this group, members a=\r\nre\n&gt;    Lord Elder, Deadfur, ?\n&gt;    - Minions - Since Preston left, nothing=\r\n has happened with the Minions.  I\n&gt;    can take over his main minion chara=\r\ncters and get the action started again.\n&gt;    Preston noted that the more he=\r\n acted as a GM and posted for the minions, the\n&gt;    more active the group g=\r\not.  I think we just need a little excitement!\n&gt;    - Dark Rodimus and Nigh=\r\ntlight.  I&#39;m trying to find out more information\n&gt;    about the status of t=\r\nhese two characters.  Would Hydras be more inclined to\n&gt;    let Nightlight =\r\ngo home now that there&#39;s a truce?  This might make a good\n&gt;    thread, gett=\r\ning back these two characters from Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Questions!?!  Ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\nKrafltos\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
