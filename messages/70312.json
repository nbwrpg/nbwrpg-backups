Being a large truck, Tucson is f=\r\nar too heavy to go too fast in such a short length of time, so 0 to 60 soun=\r\nds just about right.  \n\nBIC:\n\nTucson didn&#39;t care about surface or internal =\r\ndamage at this time, he was far more concerned about keeping his comrades s=\r\nafe from harm.  Quickstride quickly goes top side to see if Talon needs ass=\r\nistance as Straight Shot quickly attends to Perceptor.  Both of which find =\r\nthemselves attempting to ward off the enemy with either arrow or high power=\r\ned gun fire.  The insects atop Tucson were posing a major threat to Legacy =\r\nand Talon, as Quickstride tries desperately to back them up, shooting repea=\r\ntedly to attempt to get the enemy off Tucson&#39;s trailer before they did any =\r\nharm to his comrades.\n\n&quot;Woahh, a little more pest control than I bargained =\r\nfor! Legacy, Talon, you two okay?!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot too, finds herself firin=\r\ng off arrows just to try and slow the insect beings down, while she despera=\r\ntely tries to help Perceptor.\n\n&quot; That does it!  I wish these ugly bugs woul=\r\nd turn around and get themselves caught in a spider web!  Hang in there Per=\r\nceptor, I got your back!&quot;  \n\nTucson was becomming more and more annoyed by =\r\nthe insects.  Something had to be done before they destroyed his comrades. =\r\n He felt it was HIS responsibility to see to the welfare of his fellow Auto=\r\nbots and Maximals.  He was the one in charge of their well being.  He hoped=\r\n by attempting a Sonar blast attack, he could immoblize the bug brigade.  I=\r\nt would be a bold move on his part, and this he knew would hurt Perceptor i=\r\nmmensely, since he was a predacon.\n\n&quot;Perceptor, I need you to turn off your=\r\n audio sensors for a short time.  I&#39;m going to attempt a sonar blast which =\r\nI hope will slow things down for us enough to get to Rodimus.  That way I k=\r\nnow I will not harm you when I do emit this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m=\r\n through doing that, tap him on the shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to t=\r\nurn them back on.&quot;\n\nShe nodds. \n\n&quot;Roger that Tucson Prime.  Okay Perceptor,=\r\n to be on the safe side, it&#39;s best if you shut down your audio sensors now.=\r\n  I&#39;ll tap you on the shoulder when we&#39;re all finished.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;supercyclonus&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, the im=\r\nage did not come through right. let me post it here directly on the website=\r\n, it might come through better. :)??\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * =3D Wall of tunnel\n&gt; (1-7=\r\n) numbers are insect troopers (1&2 are actually on Tuscon)\n&gt; S=3DStraight s=\r\nhot (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt; Q=3DQuickstride (Inside Tuscon&#39;s Cab)\n&gt; T=3DTal=\r\non (On top of Tuscon)\n&gt; Legacy (On Top of Tuscon)\n&gt; P=3DPerceptor (Driver&#39;s=\r\n side rear)\n&gt; \n&gt; *     1  2     *\n&gt; *     ____     *\n&gt; *  4   SQ   3  *\n&gt; *=\r\n  6    T   5  *\n&gt; *       L   7  *\n&gt; *    P ___     *\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
