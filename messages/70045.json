It even rolled across the\nsecurity section of it, and despite the special safegaurds built in,\nmanaged to penetrate it.\n\nHowever rather than having a baneful effect, it was rather pleasent.\nAs it flowed over him he could feel a tingling sensation, followed by\na warm one. He could feel a power within him answer it in like manner,\nbut differently. His mind was eased for a moment, as if there had been\nsome internal conflict going on, one that he had not even been aware\nof, but one that had now been resolved.\n\nCyclonus straightened as he relaized what had happened, the last\nvestige of Unicron control had been taken aware. No longer did he have\nto focus on being loyal to Hydras, or question it, his old loyalty to\nGalvatron, or the portion that was in Hydras had been strengthened and\nmagnified. It was if his purpose in life had been magnified, brought\ninto focus and sharpened.\n\nSo as the screens showed the view outside of the the Maximals, he\nsmiled as he entered a few commands and watched the world light up, he\nwas fully a Decepticon once more!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
