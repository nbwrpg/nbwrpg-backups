They saw Astroblast heading for the Cybertronian Fire,\n&gt; and set a head-on collision toward him. They approached him quickly,\n&gt; though one of them was cloaked and Astroblast wouldn&#39;t see it, and\n&gt; then fired two missiles each as soon as they were close. Both of them\n&gt; pulled up to avoid a collision, but the missiles kept going right at\n&gt; Astroblast.\n\n\n"}}
