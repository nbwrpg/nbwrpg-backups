So...someone is blocking us only.  They will all die.  Let me hear \nit.&quot;\n\nUnitron played Defection&#39;s message.   \n\nKoga Shuko nodded his head.  &quot;I see...I wish Set were here.  He&#39;s more \nexperienced at negotiations with killers than I am.&quot;  Activating his com, he \nspoke to Defenction, on Defenction&#39;s com frequency.  \n\n&lt;I, am Koga Shuko.  Errr...Defection, please understand my hesitation to \nwelcome you in my base with open arms.  But, as I&#39;m sure you know, we are in \na war.  Especially some possible deserter of another side who may just be a \nspy.  So, I can&#39;t trust you.  At least not yet.  A test is in order.  I hope \nyou are not offended, but I can&#39;t let every wayward robot enter my cadre.  It \nwould be pure stupid of me.  There is something blocking our com frequencies, \nor at least one at a time for now.  We can change our frequencies of course, \nbut if done at the right time...the consequences of no communication could be \ncostly.  So...I need you two to find out what the source of the thing that is \njamming my frequencies are.  Report back to me with its location and what it \nis exactly.  A tower, an alien device, whatever.  If it is Predacon, Maximal, \nor some other Cybertronian faction, if you can destroy it, do so.  But if \nit&#39;s to heavily guarded for two robots, then just report back to me&gt;\n\nKoga Shuko whispered into Anubis&#39; audio receptor, in turn Anubis whispered to \nUnitron.  Unitron nodded.\n\nUnitron waited, being ordered to go down to the mercenaries they had hired \nearlier, to give them their fee and offer them another job.  The solar panels \nearlier had made plenty of energon.  \n\n"}}
