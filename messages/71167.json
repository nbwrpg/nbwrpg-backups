Sure, I think I will go in for a little recharge, Sir. Ow, n=\r\now they hurt.&quot;\n\nWith a salute to Rodimus Uproar retires to the CR chambers =\r\nto get some much needed rest.\n\nMeanwhile, Straight Shot and Quickstride loo=\r\nk to each other and then to Rodimus.  Straight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; I have some t=\r\nraining in basic structural repair Sir.  Tucson taught me a few things, but=\r\n nothing too advanced.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds as well.\n\n&quot; I learned a bit of s=\r\necurity system programming, plus intermediate structural repair, and forcef=\r\nield technology. And there&#39;s one more that&#39;s at the top of my directory.. A=\r\nhh, that&#39;s right, I&#39;m also well versed in weaponry research and development=\r\n.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot chimes in.\n\n&quot;Oh yeah, ditto, that&#39;s actually one of my fi=\r\nnest attributes.  If we&#39;re gonna repair the Ark, we might wanna upgrade the=\r\n weaponry system and security shell.&quot;\n\nQuickstride ponders for a moment.\n\n&quot;=\r\nAnd we&#39;ll wanna get some backup generators online too.  It&#39;ll come in handy=\r\n because forcefields do take up a lot of power... Then there&#39;s the question=\r\n of the power source...  The way it is now, we might not have enough ta go =\r\non, and it would be nice ta fix that and sort of use something that isn&#39;t g=\r\nonna harm the planet, but we wouldn&#39;t have ta worry about running dry.&quot;\n\nSt=\r\nraight Shot looks out the window of the Ark.\n\n&quot;I noticed there&#39;s some wind =\r\nflowing through on this planet.. I&#39; wondering if we could harness that and =\r\nuse that for an alternate power source..&quot; \n\nQuickstride raises an optic.\n\n&quot;=\r\nOh yeahh...  Rodimus, Sir, with your permission we&#39;d like to construct a wi=\r\nndmill turbine to help us produce our own alternate energy source.  This wa=\r\ny, we don&#39;t harm the planet and we gather our own energy without robbing it=\r\n from the environment.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;then all members of the maximal=\r\ns should be healed and then we can start\n&gt; to insolate the ark&quot;said dryly P=\r\nerceptor&quot;Do you have medical skill?? we will\n&gt; need that to reactivate Nigh=\r\ntlight, and heal the medics...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to look back =\r\nat Perceptor, &quot;Affirmative. I have the complete\n&gt; the complete medical trai=\r\nning from both Maximal and Predacon experts. I also\n&gt; possess the complete =\r\ntechnical specifications of each and every unit up and\n&gt; to this point.&quot; Th=\r\nere was no pride in Legacy&#39;s words, no hubris, only a cold\n&gt; recitation of =\r\nfacts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson gives a casual smile to Rodimus. It was =\r\nlike old times. They had\n&gt; fought hard together before and now, with Rodimu=\r\ns back safely he was assured\n&gt; that there would be nothing that would stand=\r\n in the way of their friendship.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus smiled back at Tus=\r\ncon, a smile akin more to his days as Hot Rod when\n&gt; he had not a care in t=\r\nhe world and no more responsibility than he cared to\n&gt; take on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I want you to know that this time, Rodimus, I won&#39;t let anyone =\r\nor\n&gt; anything stand in the way of our comradship. I learned a great deal th=\r\ne day\n&gt; I was taken off line. I learned to watch my back at all times, and =\r\nnever to\n&gt; let my guard down. So if anyone dares to cross our line again, t=\r\nhere will be\n&gt; a serious lesson to be learned. But, that lesson is twice le=\r\narned when it\n&gt; comes from two Primes instead of just one. As soon as I&#39;m f=\r\nully operational,\n&gt; of course, I - think it would benefit all of us, if we =\r\nhad a more\n&gt; substantial base of operations.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks o=\r\nver to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heeey, sorta like Metroplex in the past.. Of course, =\r\nthere aren&#39;t any\n&gt; transformers that size anymore huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodd=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s right. But it doesn&#39;t mean it has to stop us from creati=\r\nng a base\n&gt; of operations. I&#39;d like to also preserve the land in it&#39;s purit=\r\ny. Perhaps\n&gt; create something that intergrates with the environment. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride listens in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, sort of an organic base but sort o=\r\nf not. Kind of.. Ya know, that\n&gt; might be doable. Maximal bases are like th=\r\nat, and I&#39;m sure we can find\n&gt; materials for it without upsetting anything =\r\nor anyone. And we can always\n&gt; power the base with solar pannels, so that w=\r\nay we don&#39;t drain the planet of\n&gt; it&#39;s natural resources. And if we need to=\r\n create a fuel source, why not go\n&gt; botanical? Non chemical means no pollut=\r\nion.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson chuckles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I like the sound of that. But firs=\r\nt, I think we have more important\n&gt; issues to deal with. Hydras.. For now, =\r\nthe Ark alone will have to do, but in\n&gt; time, we can think of expanding our=\r\n base of operations, perhaps convert it\n&gt; to residential quarters, where we=\r\n can be assured safety. Again, this will\n&gt; have to come in time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\ne staggers somewhat, and points to the CR Chambers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I - better no=\r\nt waste any more time getting to the CR chambers.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All=\r\n right old friend.&quot; Rodimus said, &quot;We can talk about that later, but we\n&gt; h=\r\nad better get you moving now.&quot; Rodimus gently but firmly urges Tuscon to\n&gt; =\r\nthe recharging chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He slowly makes his way over t=\r\no the CR chambers, and makes it to a large\n&gt; booth, where he sits down and =\r\nthen lies back. With a sigh, it&#39;s not long\n&gt; before he goes into a sleep mo=\r\nde. At last, he listens to his systems and\n&gt; settles down for a much deserv=\r\ned recharge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus helped Tuscon to the recharging chambe=\r\nr and settled him in. As it\n&gt; started to hum and the indicator lights began=\r\n to show a nice even recharge\n&gt; the Autobot commander turned back to the ot=\r\nhers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You look like you could use some time in the recharge chamber a=\r\ns well.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus said to Uproar as he noting the dings and dents he had, =\r\nespecially\n&gt; the one he received when trying to take on Cyclonus and fallin=\r\ng out of the\n&gt; air.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy, Perceptor, I will need the two of you to =\r\nbegin work on repairing\n&gt; the rest of our medical staff. From what Ramulus =\r\nhas sent to me they are\n&gt; both now in the medical bay awaiting you two.&quot; Ro=\r\ndimus&#39; voice was calm and\n&gt; no non sense as he looked over the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Straight Shot, Quickstride, what sort of technical or building training do=\r\n\n&gt; either of you have?&quot; Rodimus glanced around the Ark meaningfully. &quot;We ca=\r\nnot\n&gt; completely fix the Ark, but repairing some of the major breaches will=\r\n allow\n&gt; us to keep the Predacons out the next time they attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodi=\r\nmus smiled ruefully as he rubbed a small dent on his head, &quot;Hopefully\n&gt; tha=\r\nt will not be anytime soon.&quot; It would seem that sometime soon Rodimus\n&gt; wou=\r\nld need his time to repair =96 but not before he got the ball rolling.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
