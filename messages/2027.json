She looked up into his face and it suddenly occurred to her how proud his optics looked, she had glanced below for a moment and suddenly realized how high up they were!\nIron Raptor snarled at the sudden realization and a little fear of heights clutched her spark, she suddenly found herself with her arms wrapped around Prowl&#39;s chest and almost clinging to him for fear of falling.\nIt was then that she suddenly felt Prowl tighten his grip on her and press her closer to his body, she squeaked at the sudden tightness but then relaxed a little.\nIron Raptor saw Prowl take out his weapon and begin to fire at a target that she could not see, this fact of not being able to see the enemy annoyed her!\nShe then wrenched her head back and looked ahead of then, but the picture was up side down...her chest pressing into his at the action.\nIt was Shocker! She growled at the enemy but at the moment immobile and unable to reach her splatter gun, she then looked back to Prowl, she hoped that he could take care of the enemy without her assistance.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
