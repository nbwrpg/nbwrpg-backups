Someone on the \ncouncil must receive a notice from the victim sent before the post where said \nharm is to occur.  Note: This does not apply if you are harming another of \nyour characters.\n\n4) Whomever shall use telepathy to paralyze must accept any reasonable \nattempt to escape said telepathy.  Note:  &quot;He was paralyzed but shook it \noff.&quot; is not a reasonable attempt.  Put some thought into it.\n\n5) ANY new telepaths with the ability to influence others through their \nthoughts must be approved by the council.  This includes any upgraded by Soul \nOrbs.  There must be a plausible reason for them to have this kind of power \nbefore they will be approved.  (Soul Orbs are one such reason.)\n\nThank you for your time.
