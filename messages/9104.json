She looked out and saw the \nexpansion \n&gt; of the forest open up in front of her.  She wondered how she and \n&gt; Lunarpine would ever make things work.  One minute, they were \n&gt; laughing and having fun.  And the next, trying to bite each other&#39;s \n&gt; heads off.  She knew that in the wild, wolves and owls mated for \n&gt; life.  But how one Cybertron would she make things work for her and \n&gt; Lunarpine, she had no idea.  She looked and saw the clouds moving \n&gt; quickly across the sky.  \n&gt; \n&gt; She looked down and saw a rabbit hopping long the forest floor.\n&gt; She shook her head, she wasn&#39;t in the mood to hunt. She knew \n&gt; Lunarpine needed to be in the company of other wolves.  She too, \n&gt; longed for the company of other owls.  She was willing to give that \n&gt; up for him.  But she knew that he would never give up being a wolf \n&gt; for her.  She would have to learn to just accept things as they \nwere \n&gt; not what she wished they would be.  She felt, somewhere in her \nspark, \n&gt; that someday she might have to give up and let her wild wolf go \nfree.\n&gt; She somehow knew that that day would eventually come.  She let a \ntear \n&gt; roll off her cheek and down her beak.  &quot;Wolves belong in the wild \nand \n&gt; need to be free. If need be, I&#39;ll give you that freedom Lunarpine.&quot; \n&gt; she said to herself.\n\n\n"}}
