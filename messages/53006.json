He\nwished he could have saved the remaining arm, but it had been in\nanother part of the ship.\n\nOnly then did Tyrael (and Nic too!) realize that Naga, who had been in\ncryostasis, had perished with the destruction of the ship. Too bad, he\nthought.\n\nTyrael: Computer, create a secure sterile airlocked compartment.\n\nBehind the computer, a small chamber lit up.\n\nTyrael: Replicate dna.\n\nIn just a few seconds, in the cyberbiological part of the lab, the\ninstruments started producing new nanites comprised with the genetic\npattern.\n\nTyrael then set the process for a five cycle one after which the\nnanites would be stored in the compartment. He turned to the other\ndatafile.\n\nTyrael: Well... What did that predacon engine marvel hold, I wonder?\n\nAfter pressing a few buttons, he engaged the computer to decipher the\ninformation that was contained on the part they had picked up.\n\nTyrael: This might take some times, but I will create the perfect\nTripredacus warrior...\n\n\n"}}
