Both CR chambres opened, and inhumane\n&gt; growls could be heard from both. Then with heavy thuds, a large\n&gt; Mechanical horse stomped out, smoke protruding from where it&#39;s eyes\n&gt; should have been, and it&#39;s mouth. It bent down, so as to fit \nthrought\n&gt; the rest of the chambre, and as it was out, unfolded large skeletal \nlike\n&gt; wings, as it lifted it&#39;s front feet off the ground, then stomped \nthem\n&gt; down, causing the ship to shake from the sheer weight. It contineud \nto\n&gt; spit up dust.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then from the other chambre, a whirl of blue and red spun out at a\n&gt; lighting quick speed, landing on the wall. At and angle hanging off \nof\n&gt; the wall, an anamalistic growl began to laugh and cackle, it sounded\n&gt; like three different types of animals at once, and grated like glass \non\n&gt; a chalk board. It was a mechanical Hyena, both eyes flaring blood \nred,\n&gt; as oil began to drip of it&#39;s razor sharp fangs, talons protruded\n&gt; everywhere, some were slicing into the wall as he laughed. He then \nleapt\n&gt; again to the ground, and paced around Longhaul, growling, his one \neye,\n&gt; whirling in and out at the Constructicons.\n\n::LONG HAUL::\n\n    Long Haul&#39;s eyes creased into a pleased squint benind his face \nplate. The two robots in front of him seemed to sing with power and \nhis stiffled a cheerful laugh. He enjoyed watching newly repaired \nrobots emerge for the first time.\n    &quot;Well, well.&quot; he said. &quot;Looks like everything turned out for the \nbest for you two.&quot; He grunted. &quot;And quit yer pacing..it&#39;s making me \nmotion sick&quot;\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**********************\n\n\n"}}
