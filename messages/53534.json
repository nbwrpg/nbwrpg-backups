The idea of the Ark destroyed didn&#39;t bother her \n&gt; much. It was the fact that Megatron would be in danger that did \nalarm \n&gt; her greatly. &quot;I have to try, Empath.&quot; Pausing a moment. &quot;I won&#39;t \nrisk \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s termination. Hence why I think that I need to go... to \n&gt; protect it. If they were as intelligent as they say they are, then \n&gt; they already know the location. All they have to do is go there & \n&gt; destroy it.&quot; then she thought. &quot;Then again, if they did, there \nwould \n&gt; be none of us now. Well, except for you & I since we were not \naboard \n&gt; the Ark.&quot; She felt she had to protect her comrades in stasis on the \n&gt; Ark.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Then she looked up. &quot;As I see it, this transorganic form is weaker \n&gt; than my old form. For one... I can&#39;t fly.&quot; she smirked. She \nwondered \n&gt; if that was a touchy spot for the old Seeker considering if she was \n&gt; anything like the other Seekers, flight was the ultimate in freedom \n& \n&gt; conquest.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s just a matter of getting a vehicle form built in, like I did,&quot; \nEmpath points out.  &quot;Granted, we can&#39;t achieve supersonic speeds \nanymore, but it&#39;s worth it.  Any tech-bot could do you that favor - \nknowing our resident genius, Wheeljack-X, he&#39;d be happy to help.&quot;  \n\nA whispering voice causes her ears to prick up, despite knowing that \nthere was nobody to make the sound - it&#39;s not coming through the air, \nbut rather in her mind.  Empath blinks.  &quot;Did you hear something?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
