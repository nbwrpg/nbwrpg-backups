He looks both ways then up and down.  Now looking at \nAxis stares him in the eyes. The small bot grabs at Axis face with both \nhands.  &quot;THIS IS WAR BOY.  THIS ISN&#39;T YOUR PANSY ACCADEMY TRAINING, THIS \nIS THE REAL THING.  NOW LITSEN TO ME, PRIVATE, I WANT YOU TO GET OUT \nTHERE AND SHOW THOSE ENEMY&#39;S HOW FAR OVER THE LINE THEY ARE.  YOU GOT \nTHAT YOU PIECE OF PRIVATE PISTONS.&quot; he yelled at Axis believeing he \nhimself was a war general.  He then looked straigh back from the pod. \n&quot;Bring it on...&quot; he said.  He then turned jumping up onto the top of the \npod, his two miniguns under each arm ringing out 20 shots each.  Both \nhis hands carried small explosive grenades. Throwing one at Barrymore \nand the other at McGowan.  The crazy shots from his minigun fly toward \nMcGowan, Barrymore, Stiller and Alba in very bad accuracy. &quot;HAR HAR. YOU \nREBELS WILL LEARN A LESSON, SEEKKER STYLE&quot;  Seekker still stood atop the \npod.\n\nrauq@... wrote:\n\n&gt; --- Lokk / Axis / Lynxiz ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Lynxiz quickly flattens herself to the ground, avoiding most of the\n&gt; wildly fired shots though in her dodging efforts, several bullets dug\n&gt; into her armour, and glanced off of her back. She stays on the\n&gt; ground, and notices Nightlight being approached by Depp. A\n&gt; growing sense of doom builds as she gets to her feet and fires two\n&gt; disks at Depp. Immediately after firing the disks, she puts her gun\n&gt; away and starts to sprint towards Depp thinking, &lt;&lt;I can&#39;t let this\n&gt; happen...&gt;&gt; as she prepares for close combat mode. Her claws\n&gt; extend from her hands with a metallic ringing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Axis, not sure what to do, waits behind the pod, hoping that the\n&gt; heavy heat resistant re-entry armour on the pod will hold out for this\n&gt; battle. Without looking, he yells, &quot;LOKK?&quot; Wanting to make sure\n&gt; that Lokk is ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lokk creaps around, weaving through trees. Exiting the forest, he\n&gt; hids behind a near by rock. Keeping low to the ground, he crawls\n&gt; along still trying to get behind the enemy and he&#39;s almost there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
