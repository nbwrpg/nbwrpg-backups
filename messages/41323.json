Now, I know this is about Megaton&#39;s size, but that was the same wit=\r\nh Necromancer!  And I made him long before you were here!  And Hell Drak al=\r\nso transformed into a giant dragon!  Three giant dragons: Necromancer, Hell=\r\n Drak, and Megaton!  And I had permission for that!  And even though Necrom=\r\nancer and Hell Drak have changed, Megaton is still large, and Cyberwolf has=\r\n permission(I hope) to have Megaton go that large!  God!  Not every bot is =\r\nequal you know, some bots are weaker and some are stronger!  You can&#39;t alwa=\r\nys have the super-powered bots!  Now, I don&#39;t want to be on bad terms with =\r\nyou or anything, LN, please don&#39;t take this personally.  I guess this kind =\r\nof goes to everybody.
