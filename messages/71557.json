He then lowers his head back down to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; =\r\n We have to put order back into the forest.  The only way we can do that, i=\r\ns to locate the mech who is controlling the dinosaurs and subdue him.  I ha=\r\nve a feeling that part is up to us.  The old dragon would have wanted it th=\r\nat way.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Leo Prime and Wing Caliber.\n\n&quot; Leo Prime, Wing Calibe=\r\nr, I need you to head into the forest and be ready to direct forces on the =\r\nground.  Once we engage the enemy I know there&#39;s going to be trouble.  I ne=\r\ned you to create a chaos buffer so we can avoid pandemonium.  Take as many =\r\nMaximals and Autobots with you as you see fit.  And most of all, please, be=\r\n careful my friends.&quot; \n\nHe then looks back to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I may be wrong as=\r\n to the meaning of my new form but I think somehow this has always been wit=\r\nhin me and the old dragon could somehow sense it.  Plus my temper, I realiz=\r\ne it can get rather out of hand at times.. I believe the term is hot headed=\r\nness and of course, dragons breathe fire, so... Anyway that&#39;s what I think =\r\nas far as your question is concerned.  All right, we have work to do.  The =\r\nsooner we set the forest straight, the sooner we find Cheetor.&quot;\n    \nHe now=\r\n spreads his wings and offers his back to Rodimus.  \n\n&quot;We&#39;re meant to do th=\r\nis together, and together we will.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly=\r\n busy. \n\nOn Aug 4, 2011, at 12:33 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@gmail.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Please keep in mind Saberback was not identified by the =\r\nMaximals,\n&gt; they have no idea who that was on the field.

The dream was a vision.  Better\n&gt;&gt; times are=\r\n ahead and the dragon knew exactly what needed to transpire.  My\n&gt;&gt; Autobot=\r\n shell was weakening and would not have lasted much longer.  And now,\n&gt;&gt; I =\r\nam the Silver Dragon, but please, call me by my original name. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He =\r\nlooks outside with a strong stance in his new trans metal draconic form.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n He transforms into his new alt form and takes a strong stance at the foot =\r\nof\n&gt;&gt; the cave.  Now a much younger and stronger version of the Silver Drag=\r\non,\n&gt;&gt; Tucson makes his voice heard, hoping that Saberback hears his assert=\r\nive\n&gt;&gt; message.  A booming draconic roar is sent over the skies as a warnin=\r\ng is\n&gt;&gt; cast to the enemy that the guardian lives again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - Rodimu=\r\ns&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As the other approach RODIMUS is still standing there holding the\n&gt;=\r\n rather large draconic scale looking at it admiringly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; . . . .\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n RODIMUS, LEO and WING SABER are all standing in surprise as TUSCON\n&gt; took =\r\non this new form, and how he explained how it all came from a\n&gt; dream.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n WING SABER whispered, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that Yokitron had such powers to\n&gt; do=\r\n anything like this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO shook his head thoughtfully, &quot;I am not sure =\r\nif he does.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS came over to stand next to LEO and WING SABER as =\r\nhe held the\n&gt; large scale under one arm.
