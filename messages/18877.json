She could taste the \nmech fluid in her mouth.  She sceamed out again, hoping that someone \nwould hear her.  &quot;HEEEEELLLLP!&quot;  She then thought she heard voices \noutside.  She screamed again, &quot;HEY!HEY!I&quot;M UNDER HERE! HELP! HELP \nME!&quot;  She cursed under her breath.  She would get that maximal that \nleft here in the ark to die.  She couldn&#39;t believe that she had gone \nfrom being a warrior and reduced to being left to die under a rubbish \npile.  She screamed again and again.  She prayed that the voices she \nwas hearing were not something invented from her imagination.\n\n\n"}}
