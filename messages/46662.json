So far I \nhaven&#39;t messed up big time and I&#39;d like to keep it that way. Anyway \nI trust Hoist&#39;s advice, so when he puts his energon on trusting \nsomeone, I&#39;ll trust that someone. Someone being you in this case.&quot;\n\nHe gestures for Skullhammer to enter the base, &quot;Come on in and meet \nthe rest of the crew. Then we&#39;ll talk.&quot; He enters the base.\n\nCrossroads is just inside the base, and almost runs into \nPacifix. &quot;What&#39;s up with Crotale? He was shaking his head as he \nwalked by me.&quot; \n\nCrossroads glances behind Pacifix, and looks up to spot \nSkullhammer. &quot;Hello there, I&#39;m Crossroads. You&#39;re rather big!&quot; The \nminibot is dwarfed by the massive bot.\n\nooC: btw, I can&#39;t believe I messed up that they&#39;re/their thingy in \nthe ooc of my last post. *shudders* =P\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;polar_claw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (OOC) Apologies in advance for the short post, I haven&#39;t got much \n&gt; time today. I might be able to supplement this afterwards, but \nthat&#39;s \n&gt; iffy. I&#39;ll post twice tomorrow to make up, yes? And what a \n&gt; coincidence, I have a character INCREDIBLY similar to Crotale \n&gt; starring in my fanfiction that I am currently working on. &#39;Cept \nhe&#39;s \n&gt; an Apache helicopter (or soon will be). By the way, dun take this \n&gt; personally, it&#39;s just Skull&#39;s way of looking at things.\n&gt; \n&gt; (IC)\n&gt; Watching the Autobot whose inferiority complex rivals many massive \n&gt; quadrupeds of prehistoric earth in size, an aloof and confident \n&gt; Skullhammer lets it slide. The big bot is older and more \nexperienced \n&gt; than the smug young transformer, and has found that when dealing \nwith \n&gt; the meager few Autobots who find suspicion goes father than trust, \nto \n&gt; simply ignore any of the comments they might make.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, yeah. And Optimus Prime&#39;s predecessor was a toaster oven. \nIf I \n&gt; was one of the Preds or Decepticons, would I bother showing up \n&gt; without my guns blazing? I know full well our procedures for \nlanding \n&gt; parties that come unannounced.&quot; The muttered words, loud enough to \nbe \n&gt; heard but quiet enough to not be taken as a threat, were stronger \n&gt; than Skullhammer meant to bring on all at once. With a distant \n&gt; shaking of his head, Skullhammer looks towards the form of Pacifix \n&gt; and waits for further orders.\n\n\n"}}
