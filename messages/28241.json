They&#39;d soon be there to \nhelp out, and Cinder&#39;s spark was pounding with anticipation. It wasn&#39;t often \nthat she was allowed in battles, but it looked like Mantle was going to het \nher fight in this one. She really hoped that she would do good. This battle \nwas special...\n\nCinder carefully turned her thoughts away from where they were heading. \nExtra excitement wouldn&#39;t be good for her right now, especially after so \nmuch time spent worrying about what happened to Striker&#39;s team. She just \nhoped that they were allright.\n\n&quot;Heavy thoughts?&quot; Aqua&#39;s voice came from behind her, and she felt her \nbrother&#39;s hand on her shoulder. Cinder nodded, not taking her eyes away from \nthe viewport. Aqua was slightly annoying with his caring attitude sometimes, \nbut this was one of the times when she was thankful for it, as she usually \nwas.\n\n&quot;I guess. I hope we&#39;ll be there in time.&quot;\n\nAqua gave her a reassuring hug around the shoulders. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Cyndro \nwill get us there.&#39;\n\nCinder hugged Aqua back and then turned around and walked off toward the \ncontrol room. Aqua followed her. Cinder stopped by her quarters, taking out \na weapon that was a bit too big for her. She put it in a hip compartment and \nthen walked out of her room, surprised to see Aqua still there. But she \nwasn&#39;t mad. She smiled and the two resumed their walk toward the control \nroom.\n\nThe Element entered earth atmosphere, heading toward the Cybertronian Fire.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
