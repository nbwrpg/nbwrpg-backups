She wasn&#39;t expecting a bot to \njust come out of the forest like that.  She pulled out her \ndagger, &quot;Who are you?&quot; She looked for a symbol to identify him with.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rattrap:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap didn&#39;t like it out in the forest, but he might as well get \nused to \n&gt; it. It may have been his only cover.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had to keep going and try to find something that could help him. \nBut \n&gt; what? The only bots that he ever came in contact with were the ones \nthat \n&gt; used him. And nothing from this planet could come to any good to \nhim.\n&gt; \n&gt; He kept on moving, hitting his feet against rocks and tripping over \n&gt; up-rooted little things. It took him a few more minutes until he \nfinally \n&gt; made it out of the forest. He looked behind himself and watched the \nskies \n&gt; for the Predacon fliers. That was when he bumped into something \n(Dark \n&gt; Mouse).\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
