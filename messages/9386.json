She saw a new ship \non the monitor. \n&quot;Computer, increase visual, focus on section 39 by 187.&quot;\nThe computer screen zoomed in on the ship.  She looked at it but \ndidn&#39;t recognize it as any ship she knew of.\n&quot;Computer, any information on the design of the ship?&quot;\nCOMPUTER: NO KNOWN INFORMATION. SHIP IS UNCLASSIFIDED.\n&quot;Oh great. We have an unknown ship heading towards us.&quot;\nShe opened up the comm frequencies to the ship.\n&quot;Predacon base to spacecraft. Identify yourself. You are flying in \nPredacon space terratory.  Stay where you are.

He hears the message where\n&gt; &gt; Magmatron said hello to him. (This is not a mode, in one of the\n&gt; &gt; former posts Magmatron acknowledged Phobia through one of his\n&gt; &gt; babies.)&quot;What are you up to Magmatron?&quot; he thought as he listened \nto\n&gt; &gt; the conversation.
