She wasn&#39;t \nnormally a possessive bot. But when it came to computers, she was \nvery possessive. ONly how do you tell your leader not to touch the \ncomputer.  She turned away and looked at the wall.  She had to \nswallow her feeling and her pride yet again and let the leades be \nleaders.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised an eye browl plate.\n&gt; &quot;Both Killfest and I are co- Commanders,&quot; he explained to \nQuickstrike. \n&gt; He turned back to Killfest.\n&gt; &quot;My troops arn&#39;t in place for anything yet.
