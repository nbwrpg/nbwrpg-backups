Until I&#39;ve \nhad a chance to respond (ie wait until you&#39;ve been answered before \ngoing ahead), you have no right to simply waltz past my characters - \nor anyone else&#39;s for that matter.

Beyond that, it&#39;s also illegal to post damage (or even \nbeing hit) for someone else&#39;s character, as you did for Perceptor.  \nHonestly, does NOBODY read the damn rules these days?\n\nPumpskin::\n\n&quot;Not so fast!&quot; Pumpskin cackles as all eight of his beast form&#39;s \ntentacles reach out to ensnare Sideways, using the narrow hallway to \nhis advantage.
