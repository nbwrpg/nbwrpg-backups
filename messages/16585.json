Suddenly, \n&gt; both \n&gt; &gt; his shoulder blasters take aim at Prebon, one firing at the bot&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; head \n&gt; &gt; and the other at his chest.

I thought he said it out loud. I&#39;ll just \nsay\n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this post that it was a guess, so that if it was right Striker \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would&#39;ve felt without that option. And the door to Striker&#39;s \ncell\n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; open right now. Ignatius opened it. And Code, their in a \nmountain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with may tunnels and their at the top. You can&#39;t just talk, \ncause \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they won&#39;t here you. Scan the mountain for technology and when \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; find stuff just send a comm message. No word on Bob Skir yet. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably forgot about us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prebon gazed at Spears\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to give you the order, but it&#39;s all up to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Striker here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prebon looked at him. He was hoping Striker would do something \n&gt; when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he said he knew about his self destruct program, so Prebon\nwould \n&gt; &gt; know \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if he really has one on, but he didn&#39;t flinch. He could probably\n&gt; &gt; put \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Striker out now, but he wouldn&#39;t know if he would explode or \nnot.\n&gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had to go with what he had.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Striker, you don&#39;t understand, do you? The Maximals are only\nmy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first plan. If that fails, I&#39;m sure their are other groups that \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fall for it. The minute you leave this ship though, Savage\nwould \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting. And he wouldn&#39;t be happy. He hates you with all his \n&gt; soul, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he&#39;s nearly killed you before. He&#39;ll put you in stasis lock,\n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than you explode. He&#39;ll probably get really hurt, but he&#39;s tough\n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will survive after rehibilitation. It&#39;s not worth it Striker. \nYou \n&gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; go free. And I also made a promise to Spears that if she serves \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well in the recent future, I may release her. This is the only \n&gt; &gt; chance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll get! I&#39;m not an evil sorcerer. I&#39;m only looking out for \nmy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; groups best interests. This is your only chane of survival and\n&gt; &gt; love. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take it!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vulois\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vulois looked at Child.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes I know.

Zardus has agreed to loan us the \nentire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oblitercon force for our battle.
