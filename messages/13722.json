She looked at her rifle and sighed. She knew what she had \nto do.  She grabbed her rifle and ran outside.  She looked at \nTerrorsaur and let a tear run down her cheek.  She raised her rifle.  \nShe took careful aim at Land Mine&#39;s head and pulled the trigger. &quot;May \nshe forgive me.&quot; she whispered.\n\nKitKat knew that as long as one of her team was a hostage, they would \nsuffer.  She cared to much for her friend to let her suffer at the \nhands of those bots who were crueler than any Predacon she had ever \nseen.  She cried on the inside since she made the decision.  She knew \nthat this was the only way to end it.  By killing her friend and \nending her suffering at the hands of the maximals.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Deemos held Land Mine in the way, she took the abuse heading toward \nDeemos.\n&gt; The resr of his group were all hit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Diskus, guard my back, the rest of you, reatreat!&quot; Deemos ordered. \nThe\n&gt; Chosen Ones, except for Deemos and Diskus reatreated.
