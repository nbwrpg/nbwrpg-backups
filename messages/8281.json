He looks around, seeing Arcangel, Icedemon, \nShocker, and Kamodia attacking the base. He looks down at his scanners, \nseeing the Alliance members dealing with some Maximals in the torture \nchambers.\n\n&quot;Zergling, DevilDuer,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Get out here and help \ndefend the base.&quot;\n\nWith that, he turns toward Kamodia, firing his plasma launcher at her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer opens his eyes, looking down at himself. He wasn&#39;t in too good a \nshape, mechfluid leaking from his wounds and a headache in his head. He \ngrowls as he hears Zardus&#39; transmission. Couldn&#39;t he get some rest?\n\nDevilDuer gets to his feet, using a tree branch for support. He walks out of \nthe forest and toward the Alliance base, firing at Shocker.\n\n"}}
