Be sure you understand the rule \nbefore you try to support your side with it.\n\n&quot;This does not mean you can fire 25 shots from a machine gun, put that down, \nfire 4 shots from a normal gun, put that down, etc...&quot;\n\nBy that, I mean that you can&#39;t keep taking out new guns. Dropping a gun and \npulling another one out once isn&#39;t against the rules, doing it 5 times or so \nis.\n\nAnd, if you reread KSL&#39;s posts, you&#39;ll see that he didn&#39;t switch weapons in \none post, he had both of them out (the only case I remember when he shot from \ntwo guns was Nemesis from a machine gun and optic lasers). That&#39;s the same as \nhaving two guns in two hands. And its completely identical to what Jetstorm \nfired, only on a smaller scale.\n\nAny replies to this can be sent to me over private email. Further clogging of \nthe RPG mails about this argument will result in IMMEDIATE moderation. I am \nnot kidding.\n\n(SoulStice, I&#39;ve been giving you waaay too many second chances, after asking \nyou to shut up about it, but this is it. One more RPG mail on this subject, \nand you&#39;re getting moderated.)\n\n"}}
