I apologize if something is amiss, I had trouble making sense of some of \nthe e-mails, they arrived out of order.)\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nHysteria:\n\nHysteria continued to crawl across the roof of the CF. She dragged the large \ncase along with her, stopping occasionally to listen to the CF&#39;s comp over \nher internal communicator. It was barely audible, but loud enough for her to \nhear:\n\nCF comp: Shields at 55% amd falling.\n\nThe great ship shook with each blast from the Brotherhood and Decepticons. \nThe hull was already badly damaged, if the shields went there was no doubt \nin the Tech &#39;bot&#39;s mind that the hull would be next.\n\n*****\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron coughed and batted at the ash that rose up around her. That was the \nlast thing they needed right now. She waited patiently, well, as patiently \nas any warrior could, for the dust  to settle enough for her to get a clear \ntarget. Her head was still pounding and her joints felt weak, but she wasn&#39;t \nabout to give in to some pathetic faulty programming. Her world had always \nbeen cloaked in darkness. This was merely one more test, one she would not \nfail.\n\nTavatron had lost sight of Dinobot sometime ago, but kept his postion \nclearly marked on her sensors. They seemed rather... heightened, moreso than \nusual. Tavatron paid it no heed as she charged her staff and sent two waves \nof energy in a criss cross formation in Vehement&#39;s direction.
