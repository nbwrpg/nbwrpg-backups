Bringing up his rifle \nright up to Lunarpine&#39;s stomach, he pull sthe trigger.\n\nHe needed to end this battle soon, he was lacking fluids at an \nalarming rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; IN his half wolf state Lunarpines repair systems continue to work. \n&gt; This fight was pushing his systems to the limits, as soon as one \n&gt; wound was healed another opened. Slayer seemed to know this. Pride \n&gt; seemed to be the only reason this fight continued. Lunarpine \nrefused \n&gt; to lose. He wasn&#39;t losing fluid nearly as fast as Slayer so he knew \n&gt; that he could outlast the bot even if it caust Lunarpine his own \n&gt; life. He wanted to save Shadow Wing but not if it cost the rest of \n&gt; the maximals thier lives by giving the traitor the chance to live. \nIf \n&gt; he left Slayer&#39;s weapons alone Slayer would continue fighting and \n&gt; Lunarpine would have the opportunity to finish him. He had a better \n&gt; idea though. he leapt forward again slashing both claws at Slayers \n&gt; shoulder cannons and biting for his neck. If he got a hold on him \nat \n&gt; close range this battle would be as good as over with Lunarpine the \n&gt; victor.\n\n\n"}}
