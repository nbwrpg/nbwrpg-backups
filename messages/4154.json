This post will be a little short as I am needed at my grandmother�s again, I will tell her of the concerns of Fire Fox, Code, Yanshosh and all�it just might make her day.)\n\n* Dinobot growled as he felt Tavatron take his hand and place it on her shoulder, he knew that the action meant for him to use her as support but he didn�t like to touch another when he really didn�t have to. But in this case he did have to, there was no chance of him hoping to walk if he didn�t use her as his crutch but he doubted that she could support his weight for long.\n With a sigh/snarl he used her shoulder for a quick moment to support his weight while he took a very unsure step sideways towards her, then putting his arm around her neck for even more support and leaned against her a bit.\nThe pain in his systems was unbearable and if he did not have that attitude and discipline in which he had this day that he would have been on his knees with tears in his optics, he would not wish this pain on a Predacon or and Alliance member!\nDinobot clenched his teeth as he then took a step towards the base, leaning a bit on Tavatron for the support in which she had offered but kept enough of his weight off as not to make himself too heavy for her. He was not very happy that he had to depend on another for support when he had always managed on his own, but it was very stubborn and dishonorable to pass up such help when it was needed�direly!\nHe took another step and cringed as another wave of pain passed through him and a slight overload of his system�s caused his shoulder to erupt sparks�luckily the shoulder in which was not leaning against Tavatron.\nThere was no regret in what he had done; the thought of Tavatron in this position and with this pain was not able to even form in his mind. But he know that if it was her that was hit instead of himself she would not have to worry about the pain, because she would not be alive!\nA growl formed deeply in his throat as he stopped and hung his head for a moment, yet another wave of pain passing through his body but this one worse then the others. He clenched the hand which had hung from Tavatron�s other shoulder into a fist while he leaned against the other, the dominant claw digging into the palm and causing it to bleed again�the least of his problems. As the pain then died away he then began to move towards the Ark again, every step more and more difficult to complete.\nBut he then shock his head as he heard Tavatron clime that he would kill himself if he continued to save her as he had done, as if death was something in which he never knew of. Dinobot looked over at her as he continued towards the ship�s doors, the smile on her face making him shake his head in common sense but a bit of amusement as well.\nAn amused grunt came from him as he took another step�*\n\n�Nearly killing myself for the lives of fellow warriors seems to be becoming a habit for me lately.�\n\n* And that was true, though the only fellow warrior in which he seemed to nearly kill himself for was Tavatron herself. He had no idea why he always felt as if he had to defend her when she was in danger more then saving another in the same situation, it was just a reflex�or had developed as such.\nBut it was not as if he did not know what death was, spending, slag knows how long, on a journey towards the Matrix was boring but had enough experience in it that he did not wish to take the trip again. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
