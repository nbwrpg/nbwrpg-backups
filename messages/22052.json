Without mobility his Temporal displacer was useless. The\nautoguns locked on, the Bat probes pummeled him, Blacknightmare, Mantys,\nWespa, and Darkmouse all had an open shot.

The first blast penetrated his\nleft arm, then one shot through the shoulder with the blade ripping his arm\noff. &quot;AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH&quot; Bounty yelled until a blast severed his neck\ncausing his head to fall to the ground. Eventually the attackers stopped\nfiring and the hole filled body fell to the ground nonfunctional. His spark\nhovered out of his body and fell to the ground extinguishing itself.
