He stopped, his hands\nungripping, letting the huge ship creak on it&#39;s own weight as it toppled\nover without his support. He turned his head and looked upwards, to the\ntop of the cliff, not quite sure what to do now. Then he remembered the\nwords, (Pull it in that direction.) Astrotrain had told him. \n\n&quot;Through....wall...&quot; he bellowed, turning towards the cliff wall. \n\nHe raised his huge fists, and gurgled a growl, as the large cannon on\nhis chest lit up, the energy wave digging into the rock wall, destroying\nit. As it dug into it a ways, he stopped, and slowly moved into the\nsmall crack he had created. He put one hand on each side, and then\nstrained for a moment, until the walls began to implode, crumbling\nagainst his might. With the obstacle gone, he moved back towards the\nship, hands gripping into the frame anew. He then leaned back, and\ncontinued to drag the ship, into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n"}}
