Holds the Locket and the \nHolocube she gave him. As he enters the weapon room &quot;I hate blasters relics \nof an Archaic age if only I could find something better.&quot; Liono  picks up the \nLion&#39;s Claw and attaches the twin pulse Cannon to forearm and loads Chaingun \nin the Lion&#39;s mouth in the center of his chest. Liono exits the weapon room \nsealing it with his private code forbidding entry to those that lack his \ncode. Liono enters his chamber goes to the back wall where grabs his Sword \nfrom its case. \n\nTigerhawk sits in the secure sector hard at work on the on the Terra Star as \nhe installs the lends and defense/heat shielding plate. He continues to weld \nthe plates on with a torch.  \n\nLiono exits chamber as he scans for the other signatures starts racing \nthroughout the hallways. As Liono arrives at the corner before the others can \nsee him and places a small transparent cube on the ceiling and waits until \nProwl and Iron pass by and A Liono slides out Cutting off Plissanta and Crew. \n&quot; I&#39;m asking you nicely to leave.&quot;\n((The Liono at the corner is a Hologram))\n\n"}}
