In its blissful calm birds\n&gt; chirped, as larger animals moved away from the crater ruins that lead\n&gt; for a few miles, to a large alien craft. The Autobot&#39;s Hidden one,\n&gt; littered the primitive natural apearance of the dirt. Beside it, a\n&gt; small clanking could be heard. In another much smaller alien craft\n&gt; sitting only a few feet away, a small robot figuere banged his fists\n&gt; against the winshield of the bi-jet. Caliburst, a nebulan organic\n&gt; creature bio engenired to become a weapon of mass destruction for a\n&gt; mechanic warrior race, tried to escape his binary partners\n&gt; unintentional tomb.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;W, WAKE UP SLUGSLINGER.&quot; he pleaded worriedly. Ussually he didnt show\n&gt; fear, as a famous actor he knew how to never show his real emotions,\n&gt; but landing badly dammaged next to a huge ship carrying your mortal\n&gt; enemies was a good reason to worry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally the Bi-jet cockpit glass gave way to the metal knuckles, as it\n&gt; shattered. Caliburst climbed from a blanket of glass, and looked\n&gt; around. This bizzare planet reminded him of Nebula. The silence was\n&gt; ominous however, as he was sure that the Autobot ship was looking at\n&gt; him. Nervously he turned around, and began to whisper. &quot;Get up\n&gt; Slugslinger, we&#39;ve got to get outta here before the Autobots get it\n&gt; together. We&#39;ve gotta find Havotron, he will protect us,&quot; he thought,\n&gt; remembering back to Slugslinger threatening their leader.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Inside the large golden craft, in the pilot area, a form began to move\n&gt; out of the rest of the fallen. &quot;Ohhhhhh man, that was a kick in the\n&gt; afterburner.&quot; the gruff voice commented, as a white Autobot pulled\n&gt; himself up. Strafe, part of a group of five Autobot warriors who were\n&gt; built by Grimlock to be the most versatile Gestalt ever, shook off the\n&gt; cobwebs, as his head shifted at what would be painful angles for a\n&gt; human being. As it went 180 degrees, and joint cracked, and a lose\n&gt; bolt popped out. He looked around, and shook a nearby Scattershot, but\n&gt; lost interest, as he looked out one of the windows at smoking\n&gt; wreckage. &quot;hmmmmmmmm.&quot; he thought outloud.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
