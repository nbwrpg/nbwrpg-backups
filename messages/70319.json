Now, there was the \n&gt; threat of a cave in to deal with. Tucson Prime had to think fast if he was \n&gt; to get everyone out of that part of the tunnel unharmed.  He accelerates \n&gt; to attempt a near escape.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hang on, things are about to get a little bumpy!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride spots an open hatch in Tucson&#39;s cab.  He signals to Talon to \n&gt; follow him in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Talon, Legacy, I think he wants us in the cab.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot waits for Perceptor to turn back on his audio sensors, and \n&gt; finds herself holding onto him in a bit of a fright reflex.  She wasn&#39;t \n&gt; scared of much of anything but this situation was terrifying her.  Her \n&gt; body trembles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oohhh I so hope you know what you&#39;re doing Tucson!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the right thing, but it has to be done.  We aren&#39;t \n&gt; leaving Rodimus behind.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot realizes that he&#39;s right, and watches the way ahead inside \n&gt; at the driver&#39;s side seat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No, we can&#39;t.  Let&#39;s hope he&#39;s still functioning.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LEGACY, Tuscon, Perceptor, Talon, Straight Shot, Quickstride\n&gt;&gt; Location: Deep Earth caverns not far from the Black Fortress\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, a little more pest control than I bargained for! Legacy, Talon, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; you two okay?!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy quickly looked around the battlefield, noting the somewhat\n&gt;&gt; diminished number of combatants, &quot;I am undamaged.&quot; he said in his\n&gt;&gt; typically cold tones as he continued to attempt to pick off some of\n&gt;&gt; the enemy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot too, finds herself firing off arrows just to try and slow \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the insect beings down, while she desperately tries to help Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Perceptor, I need you to turn off your audio sensors for a short time. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to attempt a sonar blast which I hope will slow things down \n&gt;&gt; &gt; for us enough to get to Rodimus. That way I know I will not harm you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; when I do emit this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m through doing that, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; tap him on the shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to turn them back \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As the alien insectoid menace of 5 continued to advance, the next\n&gt;&gt; round of combat began!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon gave orders to Perceptor to shut down his audio receptors, and\n&gt;&gt; thereby holding his attack.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor, desperately tried to turn off his receptors, and as if like\n&gt;&gt; a switch had been thrown his whole world went dark as his sensors\n&gt;&gt; which in many ways relied on hearing was short down. He could still\n&gt;&gt; smell the attacking creatures approach, but in no way would this sense\n&gt;&gt; of smell allow him to fire under battle conditions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Seeing that Perceptor had successfully went dark he let loose with his\n&gt;&gt; sonic discharge, sending wave after disruptive wave into the tunnel!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For a moment the insectoid creatures looked at Tuscon as a strange\n&gt;&gt; sort of intelligence flashed through their optics before each one, one\n&gt;&gt; by one slumped over, victims of his attack. They all fell into stasis\n&gt;&gt; lock.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However at the same time, due perhaps to the wide area sonic attack,\n&gt;&gt; the walls themselves around the group began to rumble and shake as\n&gt;&gt; bits of stone and debris began to fall from the ceiling.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Although Perceptor could not see or hear, his vibrational sensors and\n&gt;&gt; his digger&#39;s instincts told him one thing: CAVE IN!!!!!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (OOC: be very cautious about having characters doing a lot in your\n&gt;&gt; next post(s) as there is not much time!
