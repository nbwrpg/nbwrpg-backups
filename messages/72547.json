I think I&#39;d l=\r\nike to roll\n&gt; &gt; with that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly b=\r\nusy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Oct 28, 2011, at 12:19 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@..=\r\n.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Basically I am using a lot of the animated events in=\r\n the background\n&gt; &gt;&gt; events of Cybertron. Basically the world went from G1/=\r\nG2 to Animated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Beast Wars back on old Earth - Beast Machines never =\r\nhappened.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So for Yokatron: (Yes I am stealing the name Prowl-Z fr=\r\nom Adam for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; name of the animated version of Prowl, I hope he doesn=\r\n&#39;t mind)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ***************\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yoketron is a wise old Autobot resp=\r\nonsible for training the Autobot\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cyber-Ninja Corps at the Cyber-Ninja =\r\nDojo, but more importantly, he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; protects the Autobots&#39; cache of protofo=\r\nrms, which will have to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; activated if Project Omega fails. He is a m=\r\naster of many martial arts,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; including Circuit-Su, Metallikato, Crystal=\r\nocution, diffusion,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tekkaido, Tahtib-tron and Laser Lathi.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; O=\r\nne of Yoketron&#39;s former students, Lockdown, betrayed him, stealing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mos=\r\nt of the protoforms for the Decepticons, and leaving Yoketron to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; die. =\r\nProwl-Z returned during the aftermath, and he attempted to revive\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yoke=\r\ntron by transferring his spark to a protoform that had been left\n&gt; &gt;&gt; behin=\r\nd. Though Yoketron formed from the new Protoform, Yoketron\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chastised P=\r\nrowl-Z for not accepting fate, telling him he &quot;...must not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sacrifice a=\r\n piece of the future to bring back the past.&quot; As he told\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Prowl-Z that =\r\nhe would understand when his time came, Yoketron\n&gt; &gt;&gt; relinquished his spar=\r\nk, and his new body grayed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; **************\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So yes Yoketron i=\r\ns dead, killed by Lockdown, however that leaves\n&gt; &gt;&gt; several things open - =\r\nIn who&#39;s employ was Lockdown, it could easily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have been BLUDGEON. The =\r\nmanner of Yoketron&#39;s death has been kept from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the public at large. In =\r\nfact I would imagine that the story is that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; since he was considered ol=\r\nd, that he sucummed to the ravages of time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS S=\r\nTORY.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am unsure at what point Tuscon and Nightshift left the Do=\r\njo and came\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Earth, so he may not be aware that Yoketron is dead, or=\r\n if he is,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he may not know how. I will leave that up to Sandy how much=\r\n Tuscon and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nightshift know and how much they may have told Straight S=\r\nhot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However the revelation that Bludgeon could have been behind =\r\nit, or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; even part of of it at all would be new knowledge. Most will not=\r\n have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any knowledge unless they have some special connection to someon=\r\ne who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was in on matters, or was in it themselves.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I invite q=\r\nuestions and/or comments.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
