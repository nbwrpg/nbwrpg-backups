We have them surrounded but it\nis a matter of time before t=\r\nhere back up pay us a little visit. We\ncannot lead a frontal assault: they =\r\nare to well covered.

You scrap he=\r\nap (he looked at Remus) you\nseem&#39;s able to fly so you&#39;re going to enter fro=\r\nm the north side of the\ntower...\n\nRemus: But there&#39;s no entry!\n\nRazorwing :=\r\n If you cant even make an entry you&#39;re useless for me.\n\nRemus : I wouldn&#39;t =\r\nhave said &quot;enter&quot; then.\n\nRazorwing: (He look Remus in the eyes: time wasn&#39;t=\r\n to jokes.)We ENTER\n(he stressed that word) in the building we&#39;re taking co=\r\nver and shoot\neverthings. You HAVE to buy enough time for me to give then a=\r\n little\ngift for the self proclame bastard. Your job Deadfur will be to pul=\r\nl\noff everybody at least 500 meters away from the parliament but only\nAFTER=\r\n my order, or our exit from the building. We still don&#39;t know\nwhat will hap=\r\npend with our guest or the building so the farest\npossible.

The lesser outposts had been\n&gt; easily snatched and a =\r\nlot of Bushidos had even jumped ship to\n&gt; cooperate. Good. The bigger one s=\r\ntill had to be secured more\n&gt; completely, but progress was showing at a lot=\r\n of places. Wherever the\n&gt; Iron Skulls were underrepresented, though, they =\r\nhad been easily\n&gt; thwarted. But one battle was still running. The most impo=\r\nrtant one and\n&gt; the symbolic key to victory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Relay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once the Parl=\r\niament was in his hands, the Maximals would be deeply\n&gt; affected and their =\r\nmorale would lose them, making the rest a matter of\n&gt; numbers and military =\r\nsuperiority for him. Things were going well.\n&gt; \n&gt; *******\n&gt; \n&gt; A Predacon b=\r\nomber ran another pass at the slowly rising Silver Wing\n&gt; fortifications, d=\r\nestroying an accumulated effort to pieces of\n&gt; smoldering scrap. He was the=\r\nn chased by two lighter Maximals who tried\n&gt; to shoot him down only to be t=\r\nerminated by the more prepared Preds\n&gt; inside the Parliament.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur =\r\nswore. This was a Coup, no mistake, and he realized the Skulls\n\n\n&gt; had a lo=\r\nt to win by pulling this one off. They had locked themselves\n&gt; up, but the =\r\nSilver Wings could seemingly not crack that tough nut.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deadfur: Look, =\r\nRazorwing, we don&#39;t have much of a choice. We&#39;ll have\n&gt; to blast the buildi=\r\nng open or something so as to really shake their\n&gt; defenses down. I know th=\r\ney&#39;re prepared, but only for the obvious,\n&gt; meaning your style of combat. M=\r\ny suggestion is collateral damage. They\n&gt; won&#39;t expect that from you.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHe turned to Remus for an opinion, then back to Razorwing.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
