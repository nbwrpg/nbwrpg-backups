There he found\n&gt; it, &quot;comlink&quot; as plain as day, and he knew what came next.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Comline online, scan incoming frequencies&quot; He instructed in a\n&gt; demanding voice.\n&gt; &quot;SCANNING&quot; he heard a voice inside his head\n&gt; Lunarpine now picked up the signal from the unknown source\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
