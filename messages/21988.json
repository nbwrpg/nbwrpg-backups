She picked up the clipboard and pen and \nstarted to jot things down. The clipboard floated in the air and the \npen was writing, but no one was holding it. Ice smiled as she watches \nthis. She was liking her new abilities.  She started to take notes on \nher fighting and decided to try to find betters ways. She wanted to \nbe a better fighter and not use her powers so much. It drained her \nwhen she over used them. She looked back at Razor Claw and Lunarpine.\n&quot;You know, maybe you both can help me. I wasn&#39;t much a fighter before \nI became this new form. But Now that I am bigger and stronger, I will \nneed to learn how to fight better. After ,&quot;sighs,&quot; class, perhaps we \ncan spar and I can learn how to better fight?&quot;\n\nShe send the mental message to Lunarpine. &quot;I missed sparring with \nyou.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Razor Claw smiled an ominous grin, &quot;Better than Maximals or \nPredacons \n&gt; huh?
