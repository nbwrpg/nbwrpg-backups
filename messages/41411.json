If Quatro isn&#39;t even a TF then how the hell did he send a \nmessage to IR in the first place? Does he have a walkie talkie? In that case \nIR&#39;s transmission should have reached him.\nHer frequency wasn&#39;t only open to Maximals or transformers. It was locked \nonto the same frequency as Quatro&#39;s form of communication.\n\n&gt;Quatro, not recieving the message due to not being actually being a \n&gt;Maximal,\n&gt;and not even being a transformer, for that matter.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Oh, nothing, I see you&#39;ve ordered for your troops to come back.  Save my\n&gt;request for later,&quot; Quatro said.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
