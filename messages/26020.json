Well - distressing to \nme \n&gt; anyway. (LOL) Tomorrow, I&#39;m going in for an operation that&#39;ll last \n&gt; about an hour.. I think. ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; Sooo I&#39;m probably not gonna be on the computer tomorrow, or maybe \nthe \n&gt; next day, I&#39;m not sure. It all depends if I&#39;m stubborn enough, or \n&gt; just going into withdrawl on the Internet. *grin* \n&gt; \n&gt; Either that or I&#39;ll be so crabby with this big bandage round my \nhead \n&gt; that I won&#39;t want to talk to anyone anyway.. \n&gt; \n&gt; Carnage, feel free to act Teltoli as you see fit.. ^_^\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay... so wish me luck on the operation, and hopefully I&#39;ll be \nable \n&gt; to talk to you soon! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steph F.
