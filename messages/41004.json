The blue one begins to spiral in mid air,\nthen transforms, legs and arms extending, as does his head while he\nbegins to flip in mid air, landing on the ground, and recoiling from the\nimpact, as two laser cannons appear on his back. The blue robot standing\nat about four feet simply looks up to Soundwave.\n\nThe silver cassette alsoe unfolds, but this time horrizontally, as a\ntail, and four legs emmerge. It lands on it&#39;s new pair of legs, and\nturns around, showing a a pair of red cannine eyes overtop of a muzzle\nwith glissening rasor sharp teeth. Guns begin to form over top of each\nleg. The wolf like cassette simply begins to pace in front of Soundwave,\nsnarling quietly.\n\n"}}
