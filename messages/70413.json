You seem to want the \n&gt;&gt; easy way out of everything. I&#39;m sorry but life does not usually work that \n&gt;&gt; way. Sometimes you must do something with great difficulty in order to \n&gt;&gt; acheive your goals. And trusting Perceptor will be difficult for you but \n&gt;&gt; he is rewarding us with his kowledge and that alone can be priceless.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; His tone similar to that of Optimus Prime, Tucson Prime tries his hardest \n&gt;&gt; to be patient with the young maximal, knowing that he too, had been that \n&gt;&gt; young vorns ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor glanced over at Perceptor and then back at Tuscon, his optics\n&gt; distrustful, &quot;He is a Predacon, and he probrabaly helped come up with\n&gt; whatever turned Rodimus, and now we are to trust him?&quot; Cheetor shook\n&gt; his head, &quot;How do you know that what he&#39;s doing is not some trap for\n&gt; us? That he&#39;s not looking at some other angle?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;We have to connect him to vital support&quot;said sadly the male &quot;If we like \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; remove this... beings off him. Let&#39;s go to the lab, this must be done at\n&gt;&gt; hand&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The old Autobot was glad that Elita was sleep right now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Silverbolt nodded at Kup as he turned to go towards the Lab, &quot;Come\n&gt; on.&quot; he said, putting a comforting arm around Kup, &quot;I know he was a\n&gt; close friend of yours. Santon and Bump are among the best we have, and\n&gt; Legacy . . . well he has a lot of knowledge about many things.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They brgan walking towards the Lab, where Nightshift, Rat Trap,\n&gt; Legacy, Bump and Santon were . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift quickly assists in taking care of Rodimus as Rat Trap tries \n&gt;&gt; to get the CR chambers functionable for use. After hearing Tucson Prime&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; words, he quickly looks over to Perceptor and wistles his way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hey, you, Ex Pred, I&#39;m gonna need your smarts over here, if I&#39;m gonna \n&gt;&gt; configure the CR chamber properly. I don&#39;t wanna mess this up, especially \n&gt;&gt; when Rodimus is involved.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Nightshift and Rat Trap get to the CR chamber, Legacy, Bump and\n&gt; Santon are in the lab,  Legacy is setting the wrapped up form of\n&gt; Legacy on a table.\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon, who is nearly as large and bulky as Legacy turned to look at\n&gt; Rat Trap and Nightshift, &quot;We&#39;re going to be closing off this room as\n&gt; we work on restoring Rodimus prime.&quot; he said, refering to the lab to\n&gt; the side of the CR chamber. &quot;Once we&#39;re done we will need a fully\n&gt; power CR chamber ready for his use.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Quick Stride guides Tucson into the Ark, not forgetting about his visual \n&gt;&gt; impairment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Sir, whenever the repairs are complete on Rodimus, I believe \n&gt;&gt; Tucson Prime could stand for a few himself. And so could his visual \n&gt;&gt; sensors.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elder stood as Quickstride and Tuscon came into the Ark and came over\n&gt; to help bring him in. &quot;His optic sensors have gone back out again?&quot;\n&gt; Elder shook his head, &quot;I was afraid of that. He will need medical\n&gt; attention as well.&quot; Elder glanced over at a chair that he guides\n&gt; Tuscon towards, &quot;I wish Rhinox was here, but he and the Dinobots are\n&gt; off still looking for Primal.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
