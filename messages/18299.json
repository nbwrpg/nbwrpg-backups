Yes, interesting section!  Reminds me of something you \ndid earlier now that my mind is working and I see something.  But anyway, I&#39;m \nnot going to apologize to you.  There&#39;s nothing to apologize with.  How did I \nmode?  How many times do I have to ask you that?  Firing from a rifle, and my \ncharacter&#39;s optic lasers?  That&#39;s not moding.  I hope you don&#39;t think that.  \nEvery battle, and every time when I kick your people down easy, you start \nwhining, saying I moded.  Well, everytime we ask you to show proof!  And you \nnever do!  YOU SKIP THAT ENTIRE SUBJECT!  Why?  Because I didn&#39;t do anything. \n Now, if I did, show me, and I&#39;ll apologize.  I hate to mode.  It ticks me \noff because I&#39;ve worked hard to not mode at all.\n\nYou say I did something with the maximum fire rate?  Be more specific!  I \ncan&#39;t go on &quot;you fired more than the maximum rate&quot; or similar stuff to that.  \nMan, I&#39;m this close to seceding from the Alliance and going on a killing \nspree. (That&#39;s actually a bad sentence, since you can&#39;t see my fingers, but \nmy fuse is running low, and if pushed, I will explode).\n\nProof.  I&#39;ve seen none.  You haven&#39;t commented on it.  Stop whining OOC.  \nIt&#39;s irritating.  I&#39;m fed up with it.  Take your defeat with some dignity.  \nNo one likes a sore loser)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
