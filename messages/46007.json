Will some of you just\nstop! On to the talk about the future of the RPG. I disagree with a\nrestart. This RPG has a great legacy, that shouldn&#39;t be destroyed.\nHowever switching things up a bit. maybe even ending the Neo Beast Wars\nin our story lines but continueing the story of the characters might be\ngood. I think the sequel idea fits this. Anyway, I&#39;m ready to start\nRPGing again, so here goes...\n\n::Prowl/Hot Rod/Epyon/Skyburst::\n\nThey all watches as Azure worked with Nighstrike.\n&quot;So we wait then,&quot; said Prowl.\n\n::DrillBit/KitKat2::\n\nThey sat together in a room, basicly doing nothing.\n\nOOC: Ok, so nothing happaned in this post. Thats because I&#39;m not sure\nwhats going on at Maximal City or Black Fortress right now.\n\n"}}
