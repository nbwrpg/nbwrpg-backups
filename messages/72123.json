There were different figures hustling and\n&gt; bustling about =\r\nthe room, most of them not even paying attention to the\n&gt; fact that DARK RO=\r\nDIMUS and NIGHTLIGHT had arrived.\n&gt; \n&gt; However at the center of the room , =\r\ntwo figures did notice.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of them was sitting on an ornate chair, wi=\r\nth proportions as large\n&gt; as he was! Larger then either DARK RODIMUS or TUS=\r\nCON this figure\n&gt; looked almost muscular the way his armor was set on his f=\r\nrame. He\n&gt; looked to be as large as OPTIMUS PRIMAL was after he had became\n=\r\n&gt; OPTIMAL OPTIMUS or as large as HYDRAS was now!\n&gt; \n&gt; The second figure was=\r\n smaller, standing maybe as tall as ChEETOR or\n&gt; some of the other Maximals=\r\n, but his presence is still powerful and\n&gt; sly. He was predominantly silver=\r\n with purple armor at his shins and\n&gt; chest. He had wing like protruasions =\r\non his back and his cranial armor\n&gt; looked almost like an Incan chieftain&#39;s=\r\n headdress.\n&gt; \n&gt; The large figure on the throne turned his head to look at =\r\nDARK RODIMUS\n&gt; and NIGHTLIGHT, a dark smile upon his face. &quot;Ahhh yes, my bl=\r\nack\n&gt; knight.&quot; He said to DARK RODIMUS. &quot;You have returned with a damsel in=\r\n\n&gt; distress have you?&quot; The figure&#39;s optics turned to regard NIGHTLIGHT.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;My lord this is Nightlight, my wife.&quot; DARK RODIMUS gestured to\n&gt; NIGHTLI=\r\nGHT as he did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you see lord Magmatron.&quot; The figure beside the t=\r\nhrone said. &quot;Our\n&gt; knight thinks he has a wife now, isn&#39;t that quaint?&quot; he =\r\nsmiled at\n&gt; NIGHTLIGHT and DARK RODIMUS.\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON grunted, &quot;Quiet Sab=\r\nerback.
