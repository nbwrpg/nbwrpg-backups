Phobia knew the size \nfrom his scanns, but somehow being this close made it seem larger. A \nmonument to cybertronian technology, a design made like a fine \ncrystal, sleek and smooth, and very much unlike it&#39;s predicon \ncounterparts. The pred ships were bulkier with so much weaponry that \nthey appeared as space porcupines from a distance.\n\n&quot;Magnifficent&quot; Phobia said, all eight eyes watching the features the \nship had to offer.\n\n&quot;This is truly a remarkable piece of machinery.&quot; The predicon was in \nsuch awe he nearly forgot where he was. his only thought was &quot;Welcome \nto my parlor said the fly to the spider.&quot;\n\n In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster nods at Phobia&#39;s comment. &quot;True.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks over at Hysteria, grinning. &quot;You wern&#39;t notified because \nyou \n&gt; obvioustly decided to take a long nap at the time.
