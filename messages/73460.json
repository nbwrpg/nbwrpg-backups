DINOBOT had seen better than her.  But\n&gt; that did not chnage the point that she was better than him.  Having engaged\n&gt; wtih superior fighters did not mean that one was superior to their opponent,\n&gt; after all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each assault he made was disrupted as fi she was reading his spark, even\n&gt; when his body was on full blow assault.  Each coutner countered. Each impact\n&gt; turned against him as he went at her in a rage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her form was more fluid, more graceful than his brutal Metallikido which\n&gt; preferred maximum efficiency, and she was in a word of a martial arts master\n&gt; &#39;showing off&#39; as she sent him stumbling away and falling to the ground as he\n&gt; hit and rolled, slowly getting up.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nHUN-GRR stepped up next to DINOBOT. He didn&#39;t have DINOBOT&#39;s advanced\ntraining, but he made up for it in sheer brute strength, armor and\nfirepower, and bucket loads of experience and sheer determination.\n\nAround them RIPPERSNAPPER, BLOT, SINNERTWIN and CUTTHROAT spread out,\nweapons drawn and aimed at ANTAGONY.\n\nANTAGONY for her part had finished spinning through the air and landed\non the ground, for the moment, out of range of the manacles that were\nwaiting for her. If she was aware of them she gave no sign. Instead\nher optics were on her 6 opponents that were before her.\n\nCRYOTEK only smiled as he crossed his arms over his chest and watched\nas the battle was about to erupt again.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
