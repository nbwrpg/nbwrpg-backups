He transforms into robot\n&gt; mode and cautiously makes his way down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m inside Lord Elder.  I can smell him.  He&#39;s a bit of a ways down, but\n&gt; I know I will find him.   And I sense humans, their scent is all around,\n&gt; yet I see no evidence of their presence.  But so help me Primus, if they\n&gt; have hurt him or any other innocent Maximal or creature, I will serve them\n&gt; their consequences.  And they will have to serve them for as long as they\n&gt; live.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He narrows his eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Perhaps if forced to defend what they have tried to destroy, they will\n&gt; think twice about laying harm on anything on this planet.  Their guilt may\n&gt; just get the better of them.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLORD ELDER responded, &quot;Humans down there?&quot; ELDER was clearly curious\nas well. &quot;I would like a complete report when you return to the Ark,&quot;\nHe said as he continued to monitor the communications.\n\n&gt; Before lashing out with a roar, he looks around with a snarl on his muzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I may not be seeing you but I can smell you.  You are neither Maximal or\n&gt; Predacon.  You are human.  And not the kind that belongs here...   As Guardian\n&gt; of Old Earth, I COMMAND YOU TO SHOW YOURSELVES!&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor conitued leading the group out that place, while Windlord was glad\n&gt; that he was in the Party\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is no response from any human or proto-human, in fact while\nthere was definitly the smell of them in the area, the smell is\nfading. In other words, they were in deed here at one point, they\nappear to have left the area.\n\nHowever TUCSON&#39;s bellow can be heard by PERCEPTOR as he burrowed\nthrough the intervening rock, leading the other MAXIMALS safely out of\nthe trap they had fallen in to. Also the digging could be heard by\nTUCSON&#39;s keen hearing.\n\nIt was only a few moments before both groups were uited at the front\nof the cave opening as PERCEPTOR&#39;s digging finally brought NIGHTSHIFT\nand WINDLORD out.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
