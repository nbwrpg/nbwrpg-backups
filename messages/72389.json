In the distance the Maximal ship also made its way to the\nlocation as well, it&#39;s boosters lighting up the swiftly darkning\nskies. It is only a few moments before it also arrives and lands, its\nlanding thrusters blowing aside vegatation and debris and its landing\ngear desends.\n\nThe area is open all the way around and it is situated at the top of a\nhill, one that allows anyone standing upon it the ability to see\nanyone coming from any direction. The Maximal ship has landed on the\nfar side of that hill, a ramp extends, allowing the Maximals to\ndisembark shold they choose to do so.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
