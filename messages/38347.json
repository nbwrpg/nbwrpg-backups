Once again his best bot proved hismelf worthy to \nwield Havotron in his weapon mode shall he ever need to transform ot \nthat.  He then looked to the new fight that was about to commence. He \ntook aim and fired.  \nQuake slammed into the wall first from the punch of nightmare than \nfrom the blast of Havotrons cannon.  &quot;Nightmare, no more need to \nfight. Your brother is fine, although he is weaker than any \nDecepticon i have ever met.  Quake, you showed loyalty to me and I \nonly hsot you because I knew you could take it right?&quot; He said with a \nsmirk.\n\nQuake stood up, all of a sudden feeling important. &quot;R-right&quot; he \nsaid.  Then as he walked away he let less then accedent kick to \nJagged.  Then continued walking. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;It won&#39;t work Havotron, I have you in my sights.&quot; Slugslinger \nsmiled.\n&gt; &quot;Your dead.&quot; he then pulled the trigger, and a blast of energy \nerupted,\n&gt; but not from Caliburst, this blast hit Caliburst before he could \nfire,\n&gt; and sent the gun tumbling to the ground. Slugslinger looked up,\n&gt; disarmed, his hand smoking, and fear covered his face, as he nelt \nto his\n&gt; knees. &quot;Forgive me he cried.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Spinister stood just away, Singe smoking from the heat blast he just\n&gt; did. His aim was just as impecable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jagged was nailed in the jaw, and fell to the ground. A quiet noise\n&gt; burst from behind. &quot;No one touches my little brother.&quot; Behind Quake\n&gt; smoke began to enter the room, then Nightmare did. His knight like\n&gt; helmet showed no emotion, or signs of life. Instead smoke just kept\n&gt; pouring out of holes where his mouth and optics should have been. He\n&gt; stepped forward, and swang a fist at Quake.\n\n\n"}}
