Much=\r\n like Lord \n&gt; &gt; Elder&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep dis=\r\nperesed, leaving \nhim \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at a ti=\r\nme rather then \ndestroying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ap=\r\nproached from their different vectors, they could all see \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grim =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. \nAt \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; center of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the =\r\n\n&gt; storm \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweeps that floated around him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n To those who had been at the battle above Atlantis the sight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brough=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although there were not as many sweep here \nas=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several other m=\r\ninions: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkfate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Nightstrike as well as three others wh=\r\nich were unknown - \nA \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warning that this battle may prove to be far=\r\n more dangerous \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one before.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As=\r\n Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon attack \nproved \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps and singed several \n=\r\n&gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the \n&gt; &gt; rear =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several \n&gt; o=\r\nf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take thei=\r\nr places. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the atta=\r\ncks from the \n&gt; would-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to=\r\n open fire on Ark and \nLegacy \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as Grimlock and the defen=\r\nding shuttle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At same time minions were receiving orders f=\r\nrom Scourge who \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself floating into position and was more t=\r\nhen ready to \nprove \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You=\r\n are with me! \nWe \n&gt; go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the Ma=\r\ntrix!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he =\r\npowered up \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered himself into position nea=\r\nr the top of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; host.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Strangely the response fo=\r\nr the approaching Decepticons and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predicons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a bit diffe=\r\nrent - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no \n&gt; &gt; combat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was init=\r\niated.
