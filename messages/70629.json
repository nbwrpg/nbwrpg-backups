I think I can handle it from here.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVestige barely has the time to nod a greeting before the insectiods\nare on him again, but this time, without Tuscon&#39;s aid, the batle\nbetween him and they is much more desperate. He fired off several\nshots before more of them continued to close in. There were still two\nstanding, closing on his position as Tuscon continued moving swiftly\nthrough the air, the blue winged insects flying swiftly after.\n\nTuscon&#39;s blade is able to hold them at bay, but only temporarily as\nthey are far more agile in the air than he is.\n\nTuscon landed just behind the bed, almost in the position that the\ninsectoids had been standing originally. The figure still laying prone\nand unmoving on it. The figure was almost completely white with hints\nof yellow and orange splashed along it. It was as if the figure at one\nhad far more color, but the color was somehow drained away, leaving it\nvery drawn and nearly colorless. However its most striking feature was\nthat it looked almost exactly like Hot Rod!\n\nWith an angry buzz the winged insecoids flew at Tuscon, thier stingers\nand bladed forelegs slashing at him vigorously. While he is able to\nfend off some with his blade, he cannot stop all of them from scoring\non him!\n\nAround them the room continued to rumble.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
