I appreciate the offer and all, but I&#39;ve already got a\n&gt; travelling companion, and I don&#39;t need to be protected!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She waved her hands about wildly, speaking fast, as if to emphasize\n&gt; her point.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And you know, I really don&#39;t think Carnage likes you, not that I\n&gt; don&#39;t like you, I think you could be a really good friend, but if we\n&gt; all travelled together I think it would create problems. Like last\n&gt; time, this other raptor called Rage, or something, joined us and that\n&gt; caused major problems, you know. And I really don&#39;t want that to\n&gt; happen, because I wanna be friends with Carnage.. but I do think we\n&gt; could be friends! You just.. can&#39;t.. come along with us, because of\n&gt; all the..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She stopped, and looked at Carnage. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to stop me when\n&gt; I do that&quot; She half-frowned.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Instrat, but.. I can&#39;t. I&#39;m really sorry. You can find\n&gt; other friends, better friends than I ever could be!&quot; She smiled, a\n&gt; pale imatation of her usual one, and cast a regretful look at the\n&gt; female bot, and then started walking after Carnage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;SOULSTICE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Instrat walked afteer Carnage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instrat: I&#39;m aware I make mistakes, but you should not be saying\n&gt; stuff like\n&gt; &gt; that to a friend. You&#39;re pathetic. Teltoli, you are a good fighter,\n&gt; I salute\n&gt; &gt; you. I wish to follow along with you, Teltoli, protect you from\n&gt; Carnage, be\n&gt; &gt; your traveling partner. Your so called friend thinks she can\n&gt; intimidate me,\n&gt; &gt; but I shall not do anything to harm her. I swear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instrat smiled to Teltoli and stayed by her side.
