He was about to ask for a\nstatus update when he heard the conversation on com pannel.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nThe scan came through.  This time he had used a passive scan and\nbrought another, more-powerful scanning station online.\n\n&quot;We are detecting a decepticon signal as well as predecon and maximal.\n We are having trouble getting a read on.... hold on.&quot;\n\nSalveo looked at the radar and saw that he was unable to see anything\nin Atlantis.\n\n&quot;It looks like some kind of jamming field near the base.  Let me run\nanother scan.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jamming, what is the source?&quot; Perseus finally asked.\n\nJust then the light went off and the reactor made a loud powering down sound.\n\n&quot;That isnt good...&quot; stated Salveo.\n\nThe auxiliary power came on and the base was lit with a dim red light.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to go check on the reactor.  Get a status report from all\nstations.&quot; said Perseus.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nTrelos was startled by the sound of the power shutting off.  But\nimmediately saw his way out.\n\n&quot;Trelos... terrorize!&quot;\n\nGrabbing the bars with both hands, which were no longer protected by\nthe forcefield, he bent them aside and stepped out of his cell.\n\nThe security guard, who was behind the safety glass, reached for the\ncom pannel.  Trelos blasted the guard through the glass, knocking him\ndown neutralizing him.  Trelos sparked and flinched for a moment.\n\n&quot;You can stay here if you like,&quot; said Trelos to Blacknightmare, &quot;I&#39;m\ngetting out of here.&quot;\n\nOn 8/6/07, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus: It&#39;s pretty bad isn&#39;t it?\n&gt;\n&gt; xochitla2006 &lt;xochitla2006@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Nightlight:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;I see...
