The halls didn&#39;t look \nfamilier anymore, and she knew that she might have to retrace her steps to \nget into the right one again. But to do that she would have to run into \nProwl again, and if he saw her barreling towards him he might not \nmove...trying to stop her.\nWhich wouldn&#39;t happen, that was a fact.\nShe may not be too big but she was stronger then before, even her second \nbeast mode couldn&#39;t handle the merged modes alone.\n\nBut if she didn&#39;t find a way back to familier halls soon, she just might \nhave to pass Prowl. Which she hoped she wouldn&#39;t have to do.\nHowever, as she rounded a corner she planted her feet firmly...to prevent \nfrom smashing into the wall!\nDEAD END!!\n\nBut she couldn&#39;t manage to stop herself in time and clenched her jaw as she \nslammed shoulder first into the wall...with the force of a being thrown my a \n50ft tall transformer!\nYes, there was a dent in the wall where she hit, and a little bit of \nyellowish mech-fluid as well. But she sound of the sickening CRACK as she \nhit was the worst of all.\nIf it had been any other creature it would have died on impact...but she had \nonly dislocated her shoulder.\n\nShe stepped back from the wall and turned towards the hall again, knowing \nthat Prowl would be there any moment. And with this shoulder she could make \nit at a bare run, but one slow enough that a bot could easily run beside \nher.\nShe watched for Prowl as she hobbled a bit on her bad leg, though looking \nfor a section of the walls which would due perfectly for relocating her \nshoulder.\nShe may have the mind of a beast now, but she remembered her training as a \nbot.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
