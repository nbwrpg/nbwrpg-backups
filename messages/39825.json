His head turned over his shoulder, as\nhe looked up, to see the two new robot enter. Hook merely looked up at\nthim with a bit of contempt. &quot;We are no earthlings, we are\nCybertronians, and we aren&#39;t supposed to be here.&quot; he said, a bit upset.\n\nApeface neared MT. Fujy, and soared gracefully into the hole. His radar\nhad picked up to none Decepticons, so he was flying carefully. When he\nturned the bend, and saw the two creatures, he transformed, Spasma\njumping out of the cockpit, and landing on Apeface&#39;s shoulder in his\nBeastmode. &quot;Wha, who you?&quot; Apeface asked.\n\n"}}
