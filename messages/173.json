I&#39;m just flying. I thought that you knew where we were \ngoing?&quot;\n\n* Carnage shook her head and sighed. Well, that solved that question.\nShe looked around then stopped, she&#39;d heard something!\nCarnage looked around at the surrounding trees and saw nothing, but then \nsuddenly a doe sprang from the trees and sprang off into the distance.\nCarnage relaxed, nothing serious.*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
