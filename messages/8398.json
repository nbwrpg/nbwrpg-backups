He could have done \nsomething about it, if someone was there to push him into something crazy \nlike that, and if he wasn&#39;t damaged.\n\nHe slowly backed out, keeping his optics on the attacks. He ducked his body \nbehind a boulder and made his way out of the area. He kept a look out for \nhis own back, watching for Hell Beast&#39;s troops, even Megatron&#39;s.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
