He looks over to Perceptor with an encouraging grin.\n\n&quot;Heey, no worries Perceptor, if we go eco, we&#39;ll be able to be at full power \nwithout actually draining any energy from this planet, therefore, it \npreserves our environment, and our base.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Thank you sir.  Now that we have your okay, I&#39;ll start drawing up some \nsketches and see which one actually fits the landscape.  We want it to be a \nlittle bit hidden from view, ya know what&#39;ll happen if it&#39;s visible, right? \nAnyway, I&#39;ll get right on it as soon as repairs are all done.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Rodimus and follows him.  Yet it was the first time \nshe ever spent considerable time away from Tucson which to her was a new \nexperience.  For years they had stuck very much together, being brother and \nsister, but also very close as target masters.  Yet, Rodimus still made a \nvery good impression on her as she gladly trots up beside him.  Being as \nsmall as she was, it was rather difficult to keep up with his stride.\n\n&quot; Sorry, I promise ta keep up with ya, it&#39;s just hard &#39;cause of my size.&quot;\n\nQuickstride chuckles a bit.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll forgive ya Straight Shot.  After all, this is something \nyou&#39;re not used to.&quot;\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m usually travelling on Tucson&#39;s back.  This is a \nfirst for me.&quot;\n\nEven though a little apprehensive due to her feeling of vulnerability, she \nkeeps a content smile on her faceplate.  Straight Shot was among friends, \nand she knew that sooner or later, she would have to venture further than \nthe holster on Tucson&#39;s back.  Quickstride walks up to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Straight Shot&#39;s not used ta be&#39;n outside her holster for long periods of \ntime.  She might seem a little shy at times, but it&#39;s nothing personal Sir. \nIt appears that she&#39;s much more used to being holstered behind Tucson&#39;s back \nthan she is when she&#39;s in robot mode.  But I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll open up in due \ntime.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;LEt&#39;s go to work, Legacy&quot;said dryly the male and looking at Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &quot;By the way, your child is inside the med bay....

Sure, I think I will go in for a\n&gt; little recharge, Sir. Ow, now they hurt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a salute to Rodimus Uproar retires to the CR chambers to get some\n&gt; much needed rest.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus Saluted back, feeling a bit of warmth and camaraderie with these\n&gt; soldiers. They had fought so long and hard, not only to get him back but \n&gt; to\n&gt; protect the Ark and its environs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh yeahh... Rodimus, Sir, with your permission we&#39;d like to construct a\n&gt; windmill turbine to help us produce our own alternate energy source. This\n&gt; way, we don&#39;t harm the planet and we gather our own energy without robbing\n&gt; it from the environment.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Be my guest.&quot; Rodimus said as he nodded, &quot;We could use more energy stores\n&gt; and such. We have had to do quite a bit in the last while.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;WOw&quot;said with a slight sarcasm the male&quot;is this Eco-channel???
