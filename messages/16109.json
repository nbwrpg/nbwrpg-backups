She saw Feline \nstanding there.  She stood there, leaning on the door to the \nchamber.  She took a few careful steps towards Feline. \n\nFeline::\nShe walked over to Battera. &quot;Take it easy there. You&#39;ve had one bad \nwound inflicted.&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe nodded and leaned on Fefline for support. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t feel so \ngood.&quot;\n\nFeline::\nShe helped Battera onto the table and put Battera into a deep sleep.  \nShe worked on the abdoninal wound.  She finished and closed up the \npanels.  While Battera was out cold, she turned Battera&#39;s head and \nopened the back head panel.  She put the second chip in Battera&#39;s \nhead. She smiled and closed the panel.  Then she  she woke Battera up.\n&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;\n\nBattera::\nA little groggy, she came around. &quot;I..I think I&#39;ll be ok.&quot;  She sat \nup and looked at Feline. &quot;Thank you for all your help.&quot;\n\nFeline::\nShe smiled, &quot;Hey, no problem. Anytime. Now go to your quarters and \nget some rest.&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe nodded and got off the table. She walked down the hal and to her \nroom.  She sat in her chair and open her link. In a xlightly tired \nvoice,&quot;Cybershark. I&#39;m ok. I&#39;m in my room. Just be careful love.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
