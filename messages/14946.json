She swayed her hips\n&gt; and twitched her tail as she walked.  She went into the mess hall and\n&gt; saw two other bots there.  She smiled at them and went to a food\n&gt; dispencer.  She got something to eat and sat down at a corner table,\n&gt; away from the other bots.  She acted shy around them and didn&#39;t make\n&gt; eye contact after she sat down.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
