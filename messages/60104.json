Look Malice, we both \nknow \n&gt; that you very, very good at what you do. So I&#39;m not buying the &#39;I&#39;m \n&gt; just guessing&#39; bit.

I expected he to try to \nkill \n&gt; me.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Malice pushed it aside, but it was still there, nagging the back \nof \n&gt; his mind.  He walked over to Wolfblade and helped her to her feet.  \n&gt; Although she was recovering, she still had trouble standing.

Not the \nway \n&gt; &gt; you mix drinks.&quot;  She kept swaying as he moved her back and \nforth. \n&gt; &gt; She felt her legs come on line. She she waited just a second to \nrun \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; quick internal diognostic. She was about 50 %.  She decided to \nuse \n&gt; &gt; what she had. She stood up as quickly as possible.

You&#39;re just mad I caught \non \n&gt; &gt; to you so quickly.  At least I didn&#39;t throw you into stasis lock \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; do something bad to you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He let loose another manical laugh, before stepping out from \n&gt; behind \n&gt; &gt; the counter.  He stood behind Wolfblade, taking her shoulders in \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; big hands and gently tossed her back and forth in between his \n&gt; hands.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Your a good Maximal or Maxitron or whatever, too bad you were \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; online when me and my brother came online.
