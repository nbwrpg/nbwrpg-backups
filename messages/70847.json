If we desire to sucssed over MAximals and other treats\n&gt; we must stick together and avoid unecesary looses... So my tutor, What do\n&gt; you want in exchange for my men, the base and the protphorm? &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCryotek gave Hydras a long look, his optics thoughtful as he observed\nhis former student. He placed his elbow on the arm rest of his chair\nas he silently contemplated the new head of the Predacon forces as he\nknew it.\n\nFinally he shook his head, a strange look of confusion and then\ndisappointment on his face. &quot;You have misunderstood me.&quot; His optics\nbrightened, &quot;I am not implying that I want to give you anything.&quot;\nCryotek shrugged, &quot;But if you had had something special to offer\nperhaps we could have come to an agreement.&quot; Cryotek waved his hand\ndissmissively. &quot;but it seems that you have nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;I offered you the base, but you did not wish to take it.&quot; Cryotek\ngestured with a clawed hand as he spoke, pointing at the security\ncameras, one of which showed Hydras&#39; men in holding cells.\n\nAs Cryotek spoke several of the armored female drones took up\ndifferent stations around the room. Like most of the soldiers of the\nbase they looked identicle to each other, and from a casual observance\nthey apeared to trasform into some sort of heavy and durable off road\nvehicle.\n\n&quot;Your men are yours.&quot; Cryotek&#39;s words were clear and firm, &quot;When you\nleave this base, they will be transported to you.&quot; He leaned foward in\nhis chair. &quot;However the base, since I am expending the man power to\ndiscover it will be mine as well as the protoforms that are under my\ncontrol.&quot; Cryotek shook his head in negation, &quot;We have worked hard to\nrecover them, and I see no reason to give them up now.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
