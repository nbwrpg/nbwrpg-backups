You have to give me time to post to black aracnia shooting me. For \nthere is a lot of time for him to move before you decide to shuve a gun in \nhis gut.\n\n Death saw aracnia and was disappointed at the miss of his spear. The spear \nwas in deep enough to hold and flipped around up and behind aracnia. He \npulled out his reaper as he landed and put it across her throat and yanked it \nhard and strong right to left. He used his left hand to shot his wrist blasts \nat hell beast.\n\n  Proto1000 decided to take his cjances. He formed a sharp dagger with his \nright hand and made a shield with the left. He dove at the disracted hell \nbeast and attempted to put the dagger through the bots neck.\n\n"}}
