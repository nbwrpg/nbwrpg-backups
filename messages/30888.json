He was like a shark who had just sensed blood. &quot;Stand down\nBeastbox&quot; Megatron yelled, loosing most of his patience. He walked up to\nCondor, and pushed Beastbox out of the way with one hand, sending Beastbox\ninto a wall. Beastbox started to calm down now, after that outburst of\nviolence.\n\nMegatrons chest opened up, and a slithery snake like aparatus emerged. He\nwalked closer to Condor, and it moved towards here head, and suctioned\nitself there.\n\n\n\n"}}
