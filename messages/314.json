He made a promise to himself\n&gt;that when he got back and after the battle he would try and catch up on his\n&gt;sleep, if he had time.\n&gt;Dinobot looked back at Tavatron, she looked mostly recovered and he knew\n&gt;that she could now climb the cliffs.\n&gt;His own repairs had been completed before the command from Liono and he was\n&gt;now ready for battle.\n&gt;Dinobot then began to walk towards the cliffs, he looked over his shoulder\n&gt;at Tavatron but turned back towards the cliffs.
