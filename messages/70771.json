He smiles. He knew who it was.  He offers a hand to Elita, as if \n&gt; to welcome her in his arms.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Elita, it&#39;s all right, come here, join me.  I&#39;m sure your father won&#39;t \n&gt; mind you spending a little time with your Uncle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As large as he was, there was still an air of extreme gentility in his \n&gt; body language.  He had many things he wanted to share with her, one of \n&gt; them being Optimus Prime&#39;s legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re looking at the most legendary Autobot leader of all time.  This \n&gt; is Optimus Prime, created and restorred by Alpha Trion vorns ago. Before \n&gt; he became the great leader that he was, he went by the name, of Orion Pax, \n&gt; a brave Autobot who didn&#39;t believe in giving up without a fight.  One day, \n&gt; Orion Pax suffered greatly in battle, and was brought  to Alpha trion \n&gt; where he became Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;There are so many things I never got to ask you. One of them being, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; how does one find the perfect balance between trust and loyalty? And \n&gt;&gt; &gt; how does one find peace in an atmosphere full of tension? But most of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; all Optimus, our paths appear to be the same, our values, our courage, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; our strength and our faith in those around us. Are our origins alike? \n&gt;&gt; &gt; If so, is there a direction I should be going toward? One that will \n&gt;&gt; &gt; help me to guide the Autobots and Maximals to finding the road toward \n&gt;&gt; &gt; peaceful existance? If anyone would know these answers, you would.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into a container, and gives it as \n&gt;&gt; &gt; an offering to Optimus Prime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The body and form of Optimus Prime remained absolutely still, there\n&gt;&gt; was no discernable movement from him, no spark of energy, no sign of\n&gt;&gt; recognition of any type. It could be that the Matrix energy that had\n&gt;&gt; been animate before has been temporarily used up, or perhaps the\n&gt;&gt; situation now was not sufficiently critical so as to call it into\n&gt;&gt; being. In either case Optimus prime looked, for all intents and\n&gt;&gt; purposes, as dead as any robot can appear and still be awaiting a\n&gt;&gt; rebirth in another few million years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
