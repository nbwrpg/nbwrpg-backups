Hopefully!\nShe wasn&#39;t sure if any of the Maximal would like a buddy system where they were partnered up, or even the suggestion of copying the Predacon&#39;s defence systems in order to strengthen their own. In the long run both plans just might work, but in the short they could end up as big failures.\nIron Raptor shook her head, the look on her face even more doubtful them before. She knew that she had to try, if the plans did fail then they would be no worse off.\nShe came to the War room and placed a hand on it&#39;s door,she had to try.\nWith a heavy sigh the doors then slid open but she walked in slowly, her murkiness clearly shown in her posture as she stood aside and waited for Prowl to enter.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
