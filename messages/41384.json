Who asked you?!&gt;\n&gt;SBM: &lt; ...well obviously since you weren&#39;t speaking to anyone and since I&#39;m\n&gt;the only one that can hear your thoughts when you&#39;re thinking, it&#39;s only\n&gt;natural I preceeve that you&#39;re thinking to me.&gt;\n&gt;IR: &lt; Smart ass!&gt;\n&gt;SBM: &lt; So, whatch&#39;a gunna do? Answer the dude?&gt;\n&gt;IR: &lt; No, I&#39;m going to shoot him out of the sky.&gt;\n&gt;SBM: &lt; Just make sure to leave the big chunks for me, hmm?&gt;\n&gt;IR: &lt; We&#39;ll see about that...&gt;\n&gt;A transmission was inedietly opened to the City main terminal ( Cyndro )*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Cyndro, prepare the City for Lock-down and raise all shields. Target the\n&gt;object above and wait for my signal to fire.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* From there Iron narrowed her eyes, scanning over the length of the\n&gt;intruding ship.  There was NO WAY she was going to take this intrusion\n&gt;lightly and every step towards personal security for the Maximals would be\n&gt;acted upon.  Even if it meant offending the new arrivals.\n&gt;SBM: &quot; Playing Miss Mocho, hmm?&quot;\n&gt;IR: &quot; You shut up and let me do my work.&quot;\n&gt;SBM: &quot;...&quot;\n&gt;The second frequency was opened, this time on a personal note which would\n&gt;only meet the comm-links of any Maximal faction.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Attention all Maximals. This is your Commander, Iron Raptor. Return to\n&gt;Maximal City before Lock Down commences. You have exactly 10 cycles,\n&gt;otherwise you&#39;re locked out. Drop what you&#39;re doing now and comply. Iron\n&gt;Out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Maybe abrupt but Iron knew that she needed all of the Maximals there now.\n&gt;That way she would know that every one of them was safe, not to mention it\n&gt;would be perfect for what she had planned.\n&gt;But finally, logging into an area wide frequency directed at the strange\n&gt;ship she spoke once again, *\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Transmission recieved, Devil Gigatron. Please meet with two following\n&gt;representitives at the City Gate.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
