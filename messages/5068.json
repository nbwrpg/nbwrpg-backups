He kept an open frequency to\n&gt;all happenings. He overheard a battle between a maxi cheetor and some odd\n&gt;quickstrike. HE noticed as quickstrike and the two females were carrying \n&gt;him\n&gt;off that they were on direct route to where he planned to meet tthe new\n&gt;maximal longhunter. HE would eventualy encounter them any way so he decided\n&gt;he better at least have the element of surprise. Bobertron tararize! He\n&gt;transformed into his robot mode and jumped down and gave a quick shot to\n&gt;quickestrikes head. Before they new what was happening bobertron grabbed \n&gt;the\n&gt;cat and flew off. Immedidatley he comm magmatron im gonna need some help\n&gt;here. Im gonna have three pissed off guys on my tail in a nano click so \n&gt;move\n&gt;your ass!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Get Yahoo!
