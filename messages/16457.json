That will put our numbers under, though. \nMan, \n&gt; I don&#39;t know why everyone who can&#39;t find a use for a char, wants \nthem \n&gt; killed. You just wait around and leave them alone until an \n&gt; opportunity rises. Look at what Logo did with Goldeneye. She had \nbeen \n&gt; sitting on the shelf for weeks, and suddenly Dollen appears and \nshe&#39;s \n&gt; right back into it with a great storyline. If she had killed \n&gt; Goldeneye, none of it would&#39;ve happened! Oh, and Robo, can I use \nK9&#39;s \n&gt; scrap pieces? I have an idea for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon smiled as he kissed Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How about me go outside and throw a little victory party, just the \n&gt; two of us?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Hammer laughed rejoicely(is that a word?) to himself. He \n&gt; sent a message to Prebon.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sir, that Maxi won&#39;t be following us any more. He didn&#39;t even last \na \n&gt; proper fight.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He walked over to the rubble of what was left.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey...with proper adjustments, this could just work for Bullet&#39;s \n&gt; plan! I&#39;ve got to get these back to base!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (I won&#39;t continue till Robo gives the okay.)\n\n\n"}}
