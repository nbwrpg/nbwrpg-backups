He turned to Perceptor. He stared at him \ncodly. &quot;I&#39;ll have Hydras deal with you! Fighting amongst yourselves, your \npathetic. When she wakes up I hope she kicks ur metallic ass.&quot; He walked over \nto Kit Kat. &quot;This will help keep her stable until we get her into a CR \nchamber. He took a small piece of his black organism covering his body and \nplaced it on Kit Kat. He gave it one instruction to keep her alive until the \nCR chamber fixed her. The suit to his knowledge would only willingly seperate \nfrom him when he willed it to. When the organism was placed on Kit Kat it \nwould listen to her as well. If it changed her at all it would be diffrent \nthen his change since he was a pure energon body when it attached to him. (If \nyou want you can just have it die when she gets fixed or have it change her a \nlittle bit whatever floats your boat.)\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was unconsious from the dart. Mech fluid leaking from the corner \n&gt; of her mouth and her face plates damaged. Her body limp in \n&gt; Perceptor&#39;s hands. Her optics flickered as her program tried to \n&gt; restart despite the dart&#39;s sedative effects. Even out cold her \n&gt; programs wouldn&#39;t give up. Yet, she remained unconsious. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
