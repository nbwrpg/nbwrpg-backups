But even the resesive genes will come in \nhandy.  See if you put these genes with these ones over here, you can \nbasically enginer the best trates for the bot and animal modes that \nyou want. But as this shows, it&#39;s only one bot&#39;s genes. But if you \ngot other samples from other bots, with a little time, you can \nenegineer the perfect bot, brains, strength, stamina, looks, all of \nwhat ever you want can be made and spliced.  But I have to ask, what \nis it speficially that your looking for, genentically I mean?&quot;\n\nShe saw that the genes she was looking at where her own, but gave no \nhint that she knew that.  She wanted to know why this femme bot \nwanted her genetics.  Even thought she was an engineer, she always \nthought that unless the bot was dead, one didn&#39;t go stealing the \ngenetics of that bot without the bot&#39;s permission.  It was not \nsomething that one with honor did.  Despite her reprogramming, honor \nwas one program that could never be taken or erased. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hours passed, Lady Hawk arised from her corner. she walked over to \nthe\n&gt; samples and observed the results. she didn&#39;t know alot about what \nshe was\n&gt; looking at but she could see the breakdown of chromosomes and all \nthat\n&gt; scientific junk. The dominant ones showed atributes that could \npossibly be\n&gt; spliced, the others would reject each other and probably cause a \nbreakdown\n&gt; in the systems. she catalogued the results for future purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you haven&#39;t botched my experiment, you&#39;re more \nuseful than\n&gt; I thought.&quot; She said to her forced observer. She was never one to \nadmit her\n&gt; mistakes, and putting down Squizzy was one mistake easily made. \nThere was a\n&gt; good chance that this bot could be just the tool she needed to be\n&gt; convincing. &quot;Look at the results and tell me what you can \nunderstand, I&#39;ll\n&gt; help you with anything you can&#39;t follow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 13, 2000 6:33 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: To make a long story short (To late) Part 2\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Squizzy::\n&gt; &gt; She nodded to LadyHawk. She turned her back to her and worked on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; computer, gathering the info.  She wasn&#39;t really happy with this \nbot.\n&gt; &gt; Something about her felt fake. But she couldn&#39;t put her finger on \nit.\n&gt; &gt; Her mongoose insticts told her that there was a snake near by. She\n&gt; &gt; glanced back at LadyHawk and smiled. Then turned back to the \ncomputer\n&gt; &gt; console. She watched as the printer printed up the sheets and she\n&gt; &gt; folded them up and placed them on the counter for later on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her sweet, innocent, friendly nature would give her the advantage.\n&gt; &gt; She only played at being this little helpless bot that was just so\n&gt; &gt; helpful.  She was still new enough to this group that she \ncouldn&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; anything.  She wondered seince she was no fighter, if she could \nwork\n&gt; &gt; her way up through the ranks and see just how far she could go.  \nShe\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to stay with these bots yet or not.  Sh\n&gt; &gt; also wasn&#39;t sure if they were the strongest group around. IF they\n&gt; &gt; were the best, she would stay with them. If not, she would learn \nall\n&gt; &gt; she could and then turn over the info to the strongest group. Her\n&gt; &gt; survival insticts were on full swing.  For her, insticts were a \nmore\n&gt; &gt; involved thought proccess, not just a gut feeling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lady Hawk curled up in a corner with her wings folded around \nher.\n&gt; &gt; Squizzy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might not be entirely incompetent after all, &quot;If there are any\n&gt; &gt; problems wake\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me, with any luck you&#39;ll turn out to be a usefull lackey yet.&quot; \nshe\n&gt; &gt; closed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two of her eyes, keeping the third one active and on Squizzy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
