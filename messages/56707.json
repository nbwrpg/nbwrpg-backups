I wanna cambat! I can \ndo it this time I promise Blackfang!  I can take on the drones! Just \nWatch me. You&#39;ll See.&quot; she said with the biggest grin on her small \nface plates. \n\nKitKat::\nShe couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the little bot. She reminded her of \nherself at that age. Ready to show the whole of Cybertron that she \nwas out to be the best pred out there. She shook her head slightly. \n&quot;Think you got what it takes huh kid?&quot;\n\nCamoflage:\nShe shook her head up and down. &quot;Oh yeah! I can take them out. Easy. \nBlackfang showed me how. Just have to jump on the tops of them and \nhit the switch on the back. I&#39;ve been practicing. I&#39;m not as good as \nBlackfang yet. But I will be soon. I just have to get a little \nbigger.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe nodded her head. &quot;You know kid, you&#39;d make a good predacon one of \nthese days.&quot; \n\nCamoflage:\n&quot;A Predacon? Aren&#39;t they bad?&quot;\n\nKitKat::\n&quot;Bad? Since when was a Predacon bad? All we want is the right to rule \nthis planet as we are destined to. Predacons are supposed to rule \nover all the CyberLife. It&#39;s been told to us since the dawn of \nCybertron. I just can&#39;t figure out why the maximals stand in the way \nof that?&quot;\n\nCamoflage::\nShe scratched the top of her head. &quot;Why are the Predacons supposed to \nmake up all the rules? Why can&#39;t we just be friends? Like we are now?&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe looked at Blackfang and sighed heavily. She felt her welcome \nwould be short lived. She turned and looked at Cam. &quot;Look little one. \nThe matrix has set things into action. We Preds are going to fight \nfor our right to rule. And the Maximals will forever stand in the way \nof that destiny. We will never get along. It&#39;s just not ment to be.&quot;\n\nCamoflage::\nShe walked up to KitKat and stood infront of her. &quot;But we&#39;re friends. \nIf we are friends, then why can&#39;t the others just be friends like we \nare?&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe knelt down and looked Cam in the optics. &quot;Because kid, no Maximal \nwill ever trust a Predacon if his spark depended on it. No bot can go \nagainst thier own programming,&quot; she looked up at Blackfang, &quot;no \nmatter how much they want to.&quot;  She looked back at Cam. &quot;Now, let&#39;s \nsee you take on a drone by yourself.&quot; She patted Cam on the head and \nstood up. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang glanced shyly at Kitkat, then looked back at Cam. He was\n&gt; happy they were both at his side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: So Cam, are you ready to practice combat?\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
