The sheilds\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; raised, and autoguns armed. With the freash scourch marks on the\n&gt; hull it\n&gt; &gt; seems there might have been a rescent battle.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Now this is where i take command of my former troops. Watch\n&gt; and you\n&gt; &gt; might lern something, Major Gremlin.&quot; Hell Beast gloated as he\n&gt; reached his\n&gt; &gt; comm unit, &quot;This is Predacon Senetor and Commander Hell Beast. I\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; returned to retake command of the Predacon forces. Open the hatch\n&gt; now! Thats\n&gt; &gt; an order!&quot; He barked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Aracnia slapped herself on the head. First Megatron and now\n&gt; Hell Beast.\n&gt; &gt; And Hell Beast was going to take command. &quot;Alright, let him in.\n&gt; Quickstrike,\n&gt; &gt; go to the hatch and meet him there. The rest of you finish up\n&gt; cleaning and\n&gt; &gt; hurry! Darkmouse, you go and scout out where Megatron is hiding,\n&gt; then radio\n&gt; &gt; us back so we can get Inferno. Hurry!&quot; She said picking up debris\n&gt; along with\n&gt; &gt; Rampage, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, and Paralysis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron, Aquarious, Paddle Tail, Night Eyes, and an\n&gt; unconscience\n&gt; &gt; Inferno, and hopefully Terrorsaur made it to the cave. They entered\n&gt; easil and\n&gt; &gt; found Waspinator reclining on the Command Chair enjoying himself.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Trechorous bug! You left me to die!&quot; He snapped at the bot.\n&gt; Waspinator\n&gt; &gt; spun around and dropped to his knees.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Megatron! Slug bot said you were dead! He went to go and\n&gt; salvage some\n&gt; &gt; parts from the transport.&quot; Waspinator said in his annoying bug\n&gt; voice.\n&gt; &gt;     The tyrant sa on the command chair and turned to the\n&gt; monitors, &quot;Well,\n&gt; &gt; this is our place now. And with Inferno we can now commence the\n&gt; cloning. It\n&gt; &gt; will take awhile....but with the clones we will dominate the Beast\n&gt; Wars once\n&gt; &gt; and for all!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
