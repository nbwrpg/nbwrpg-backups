I soaked in a plasma bath, or\nI should say Galvatron did, and it damaged his circuits, that&#39;s when all\nthat was me died. I then was able to watch him destroy everything I\ncreated, the Decepticon empire, the vast territorial gains in the galaxies,\nand my reputation, and I was powerless to stop him. But now, the idiot\nrevived me, for who knows what reason&quot; Megatron stated, then closed his\neyes, expecting to die at the hands of another surge of pain from his\nmaster. But it never came.\n\nHe adressed Autofire again, &quot;I came here because I sensed a source of\nenergon being burnt, I was hoping to find a generator, or something, but it\nwas you, which could be much more profitable to both of us&quot;. He then\nchecked his energon readings, &quot; I am weak now because I plotted against\nGalvatron, but little did I know he had control over me. He flooded my\ncircuits with raw energon to destroy me. But I survived, just like I will\nsurvive this encounter Autofire, it dosent matter what you do. I was built\nto not only be the Decepticon leader, but a survivor as well. I was ancient\nwhen your designs where first thought up. I have survived for over 16\nmillion years, and will continue to. This time nothing shall stop me, and\nmy dream of conquest. You Autofire, are a Mercencary, but little do you\nknow, you are born to rule this Universe, by birthright. All other\ncreatures are inferior to you Autofire, and you could be a soldier today,\nto lead the Decepticon empire into the futur&quot; he finished.\n\n\n\n"}}
