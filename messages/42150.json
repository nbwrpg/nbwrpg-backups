They had been\ntraveling for days now, searching for this, &quot;Arena&quot;. He lived for the\nfight, and couldnt wait to showcase his talents. His brother felt the\nsame way, but was not hidding it as well. Bits of oil kept dripping onto\nhis mane, and he was getting annoid. \n\n&quot;Get a hold of yourself brother.&quot; he moaned in his emotionless voice.\n\n&quot;He he ha, I can&#39;t help it, I can practically taste the fuel.&quot; he\nrasped, liking his lips, and tightening his grip on his brothers main,\nhis talons making a hissing metal against metal scratching noise. He\nthen clenched his fists, leaned over, and pointed with enthusiasm. \n\n&quot;THERE.&quot; He screamed, pointing at the Obylisk. The huge ship dwarfed the\ntwo robots, as they rode towards it, the area totally silent, except for\nthe rythmic flapping of Nightmares huge, skeletal like wings. They both\nfolded up, as he tilted downards, and began to pick up speed on his\ndescent, then, when close enough to the ground, he evened out, and his\nlegs began to beat against the rough earth, as his wings began to flap\nagain to steady himself, then stopped, as he dashed forward, iron hooves\nof steel continued to rip at the ground as he headed towards the Arena\nlike ship.\n\nJagged tumbled from the metalic sattle, and transformed into his Hyena\nform before hitting the ground, his claws digging into the dry soil, and\ngaining traction, as his powerful legs then propelled him forward,\nbeside his brother at a slow pace. The Obylisk grew as they approached\nit.\n\n"}}
