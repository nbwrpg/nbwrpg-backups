I was signed onto the Council not even a several weeks after joining\n&gt; the RPG because I deserved it, because of my skill and experience, and my\n&gt; ideas, which I still bring to the RPG.  My moding enforcement I can\nhappily\n&gt; say doesn&#39;t exist becuase there is no longer a need for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; This new Council seems like things will actually happen instead of making\na\n&gt; suggestion and everyone says &quot;Oh, good idea.&quot; and nothing happens.  Though\n&gt; with this new Council, and if I&#39;m on it, good things will happen, rules\nthat\n&gt; will help out the &quot;little guys&quot;.  If elected some of my rules may seem\n&gt; hipocritical since one or two I may be guilty of (and I&#39;m not the only\none),\n&gt; but that is how you learn.  Through experience, which I&#39;ve got 5+ years of\n&gt; online RPing experience, all in RPGs very similar to this.  I may seem\nharsh\n&gt; at times, but I&#39;m only acting in the best interests of the RPG.\n&gt;\n&gt; So vote for the KSLawDogg@...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Uni\n&gt;\n&gt; (Just want to say right now thanks to my loyal supporters, your aid has\nbeen\n&gt; most helpful and I&#39;m most appreciative)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
