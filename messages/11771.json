I feel awful. My \n&gt; stomach is weird, I have a huge migrain and I&#39;m always dizzy. I&#39;m \n&gt; findig it hard to think even as I right. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s my day off \n&gt; from work. I onyl wenty on now because if I didn&#39;t I would be so \nfar \n&gt; behind. I still had a hundred messages to read. I&#39;m going to go lay \n&gt; down. Alloran, I&#39;ll give you and your men the tour tomorrow. I&#39;m \njust \n&gt; gonna do a quick thing on Fliq and Bronco.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that they have Fliq&#39;s permission, they headed straight for The \n&gt; Ark&#39;s scanning systems. They tried to use them, but to no avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Damn Preds,&quot; said Bronco, &quot;I can&#39;t wait until this thing is \nrebuilt. \n&gt; What do we do now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When we scanned from the Cybertronian Fire, it said that all the \n&gt; debris was in the next sector over. We&#39;ll just go there and cover \nthe \n&gt; area with our short range sensors.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq and Bronco changed to Bot mode, and took off with their jets \n&gt; blazing.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (See you all tomorrow.)\n\n\n"}}
