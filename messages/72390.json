Now, a\n&gt; lot of my skills in combat revolve around balance, poise, focus and most\n&gt; important, inner peace.  Such was the teachings of Master Yokitron.  Which I\n&gt; really should be continuing.  Mach Kick, you can stay on my back, just be\n&gt; sure to hold onto me securely.   I&#39;m going to warm up with some basic\n&gt; exercises in balance.  And I think I would like to continue in beast mode. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He slowly gets up on his hind legs, standing in a near erect position.\n&gt; Instead of curling his front legs into his chest, he stretches them out and\n&gt; begins his exercises.   A look of serenity comes over his face as his front\n&gt; legs work as arms and hands, in a graceful dance of poise and tranquility.\n&gt; Slowly, his hind legs and feet begin to move gracefully in unison with his\n&gt; upper body.  As his tail moves with his body, a gentile breeze is kicked up\n&gt; in it&#39;s wake. He minds his feet and moves carefully around his new friends.\n&gt; It was his way of training for battle.  The more he moves the faster his\n&gt; arms and legs move as swift taloned hands perform the same functions as they\n&gt; were if he were in robot mode.  And then the dance blossoms into an\n&gt; impressive display of martial arts as the Silver Dragon performs a stellar\n&gt; spin/ revolving kick maneuver.  He lands on his feet without a wobble in his\n&gt; legs or ankles.  He turns his head to see if Mach Kick was still on his\n&gt; back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The reason why I chose to warm up this way is because typically, no one\n&gt; expects a transformer to fight that way in alt form.  When I first met\n&gt; Master Yokitron, he asked me to do something completely out of the normal\n&gt; routine of combat training.  I was an Autobot back then and he asked me to\n&gt; remain in vehicle form during the first lesson.  I thought he was kidding\n&gt; but he wasn&#39;t. So then he asked me to drive a little down a road that he\n&gt; sanctioned for Autobot training.  I went down that road and suddenly, I\n&gt; found myself on two wheels instead of four.  I was an SUV at the time and I\n&gt; was shocked clear out of my suspension cables when I went up on my left\n&gt; front and rear tires.   There was a ramp under me and I did not expect it.\n&gt; But then he said that even a bulky vehicle can find balance.  And if a bulky\n&gt; vehicle can find balance, so can a dragon.  This is what I&#39;m going to try\n&gt; and convey in the battle field.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod of comprehension from BIG CONVOY as he watched TUSCON.\n&quot;I have heard of your master Yokitron.&quot; He said as he folded his\nmassive arms over his chest. &quot;I am told his students are well trained\nin various styles of fighting including Circuit-Su and Metallikato.&quot;\n\nAs BIG talked MACH KICK said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still up here ya know!&quot; He\nsaid as held on for dear life as TUSCON continued his training.\n\n&quot;I think Magmatron has some sort of similar training.&quot; BIG CONVOY said\nwith a frown, sseming to ignore MACH KICK for the moment. &quot;I have seen\nhim fight once or twice.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
