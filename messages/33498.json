His nightmare effect may not have worked but he still \nlearned some useful information from the bots mind.  He liked the \nstyle of this group. Fight first...talk if possible later.\nThe tail of Halucigen fired a rocket at a wall near him and when the \nrocket hit it corroded with highly acidic liquid.  He ran through. \nThe much larger bot would have trouble following Halucigen.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., James T &lt;t882hcc91@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Spy Streak:\n&gt; \n&gt;      He looked into the bots eyes, but nothing\n&gt; happened. When Magmatron had built him he had not\n&gt; programmed nightmares or dreams. He also knew who his\n&gt; leader was, Magmatron, nothing could break that bond.\n&gt;      &quot;Uh huh,&quot; Spy Streak said. He grabbed at the\n&gt; small bots neck.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
