He is\naware of Cheetor&#39;s presence, however, at the same\ntime, he decides that reunions can wait. The image\nsent to him by azure is nothing new to him, he was\nwell aware of the original megatron&#39;s brutal reign, as\nwell as of just how great the menace of Unicron was\nfirsthand- being one of the ones to fight him off\nduring his brutal physical pounding of his homeworld\nin 2005.\n\n&quot;You keep asuming I intend to stop you by lethal\nforce. I totally agree that we need all the warriors\nwe can to fight him off. Like I said, I have no\nintention of letting that virus corrupt you any\nfurther by letting you leave.&quot;\n\nWith lethal speed and precision, Shadowcaster pulls\nout his lock pistol and fires a point blank\ntransmission square on at Azure before he can react.\n\n&quot;I do apologise Azure, but I&#39;m not about to let\nanother bot go dpwn the dark deep path I&#39;ve been on.&quot; \n\nhttp://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
