Yet his expression chan=\r\nges, one of grave concern.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes, we will need stronger defenses.  I d=\r\non&#39;t think our fight with Magmatron is over by any means.  We won the battl=\r\ne this time by getting everyone to safety but, there is yet the possibility=\r\n of retaliation on the enemies part.  I guess you could call it guardian in=\r\ntuition. The old dragon must have had the same attribute.  Only now, have e=\r\nvents escalated and I sense that the reason for that, is because of the dra=\r\ngon&#39;s passing.  He somewhat kept the land free of harm, and not smaller cre=\r\nature dared to challenge him.  But with age, he weakened, and even Magmatro=\r\nn who&#39;s strength always outshone his own, realizes that without the guardia=\r\nn, it&#39;s easy pickings.  Well, not anymore.  Now instead of one guardian the=\r\nre are many, and as guardians we need to step up our protection. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He =\r\nlooks ahead toward home.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This planet needs a chance to evolve.  And =\r\nif Nemesis Prime thinks he can destroy this world, I will not hesitate to s=\r\nhow him that no one lays harm on innocent life forms without paying a price=\r\n for their actions.  I&#39;ve been entrusted by the old dragon, to pick up wher=\r\ne he left off, being sure NOTHING LAYS HARM TO THE PLANET HE VOWS TO DEFEND=\r\n. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson had also changed, he had realized why the dragon had chosen=\r\n him.  Perhaps it was to help guide Rodimus and the other Maximals but, his=\r\n primary purpose being the all around Guardian Prime of the environment and=\r\n the creatures that lived there.  Rodimus was ready now, he grew all the wi=\r\nser and he felt that he could lead them to safety and beyond.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And =\r\nwith that said, I know my purpose now.  Rodimus, the Maximals have their le=\r\nader and I am flying next to him.  But this planet needs a guardian and I h=\r\nave been chosen to take that position.  I will always help you when my help=\r\n is needed, and I will help reinforce the defenses.  But when we return I m=\r\nust take my rightful place, the cave that sits overlooking the Ark, that is=\r\n where I must reside.  That is where he stood guard and that is where I mus=\r\nt stand.   And when you hear my voice crack the sky like thunder, you will =\r\nbe alerted to danger before it strikes you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though far away, Tuc=\r\nson could now see the peak of the cave where he would stand guard and follo=\r\nw the footsteps of the Silver Dragon of the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We have a ways to =\r\ngo but, there ahead, we are approaching home.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Local artist who specia=\r\nlizes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also s=\r\npecialize in hand made crafts.  Great for any occasion!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Need a great=\r\n gift idea that is original?  No problem!  Email me at this address and we =\r\nwill talk.  \n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 4, 2012, at 6:33 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson follows Rodimus and to be su=\r\nre he could be heard, he roars to his Maximal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comrades, in a tone of =\r\nvoice that clearly signals them that he was still very much alive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He=\r\n then looks down to Rodimus and gets beside him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; For once, I =\r\nagree with you. We may not always see eye to eye but it doesn&#39;t mean I\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; don&#39;t respect who you are. Now, our only hope to escape this threat is to=\r\n relocate all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; together. We must return to the Ark and see if we can g=\r\net it flying just enough to relocate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its position. Before I became a =\r\nwarrior, I did extensive work in mechanical and weaponry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restoration.=\r\n I haven&#39;t lost sight of those skills. I can attempt to restore the essenti=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; components for transport, and worry about the rest at a later time=\r\n. Of course I will need a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit of help from anyone with engineering as=\r\n their background, which I believe Stanton and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bump, along with Legac=\r\ny, could be a big help. All right, let&#39;s guide them home!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He q=\r\nuickens his pace with a beat of his large wings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; RO=\r\nDIMUS nodded slightly as his large wings cupped the air for a moment\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd then also flapped, propelling his large fiery form through the\n&gt; &gt; air.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I wish we could move the Ark.&quot; RODIMUS said after a moment, &quot;But a=\r\nny\n&gt; &gt; changes that large could create severe problems in the timeline.&quot; He=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; said firmly. &quot;But perhaps we can work on defenses.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nighlight slowly moved and started to woke up, she felt so weak.=\r\n She vagely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; heard familiar noises.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; RODIMUS looked down to se=\r\ne his wife NIGHTLIGHT cradled gently in his\n&gt; &gt; claws. He paused slightly a=\r\ns he shifted her to a position where she\n&gt; &gt; would be as comfortable as pos=\r\nsible for the flight home.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come!&quot; RODIMUS said in a deep voice as=\r\n he and TUSCON flew over the\n&gt; &gt; other MAXIMALS. &quot;It is time to go home!&quot; H=\r\nis voice may not have been\n&gt; &gt; as loud as TUSCON&#39;s but it did carry enough =\r\nto get the point across.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was something different about RODIM=\r\nUS, the difference being more\n&gt; &gt; than just his new mode. He seemed to now =\r\nhave a beast mode. It was not\n&gt; &gt; that something was wrong, but that he had=\r\n grown more than just in\n&gt; &gt; size, but somehting else seemed to be happenin=\r\ng as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wisdom perhaps?
