He growls \n&gt; &gt; softly, as he taps his fingers impatiently. Where was \nSwitchblade? \n&gt; &gt; That miserable infidel would come to know just how much pain he \n&gt; &gt; could suffer for such an slight upon his mighty self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wrath. Megatron chuckles to himself, &quot;Feel my wrath.&quot; The Pred \n&gt; &gt; leader waits for Switchblade to arrive; he was suspiciously late, \n&gt; &gt; but Megatron knew he would show up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade&#39;s eyes are raised when Destructor asks him politely \nto \n&gt; &gt; go to the control room. &quot;Politeness... out of a Predacon... are \nyou \n&gt; &gt; sure that you are thinkin straight?&quot; He looks up at the bigger \n&gt; &gt; bot. &quot;Besides, there&#39;s no point in being polite, Megatron is \n&gt; &gt; definately going to give me a warm welcome when I arrive at the \n&gt; &gt; control room.&quot; A sarcastic lilt appears in his voice as he nears \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; end of his last words. Unbeknownst to the Predacons present, \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade was talking to cover up his fear, and to delay for \nsome \n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Blah blah blah Perceptor, until I hear something worth listening \n&gt; &gt; too from your sorry mouth,&quot; grumbles the smaller bot, as he \nstarts \n&gt; &gt; the painfully long journey to the control room. He brushes past \n&gt; &gt; Destructor as he leaves the room.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade walks quietly down the corridor of the Pred ship, \n&gt; &gt; sorting out his thoughs, and deciding how he would play out the \n&gt; &gt; incident. Megatron was obviously unhappy, and would likely do \n&gt; &gt; something... damaging... to Switchblade. Though, if planned \n&gt; &gt; properly, he figures that he should be able to worm his way out \nof \n&gt; &gt; disfavour. &lt;I&#39;ll have to access the security cameras in the \nstorage \n&gt; &gt; bay... they will show something interesting, probably enough to \n&gt; free \n&gt; &gt; me from an untimely demise.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He rounds the corner, and poks his head into the room. He is \n&gt; &gt; immediately noticed by Megatron, who without looking at him, \nbekons \n&gt; &gt; for him to enter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade sighs inwardly, and enters. He strols nochalantly \n&gt; across \n&gt; &gt; the room, and sits himself down in one of the control room \nchairs, \n&gt; &gt; then looks over at the Pred leader.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron smiles, showing teeth, and making no effort to mask his \n&gt; &gt; irritation. &quot;Switchblade... It seems you have a problem.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heh, I thought that you might have something to say... would \nthis \n&gt; &gt; perhaps be about the little incident with the artifa--&quot; \nSwitchblade \n&gt; &gt; is cut off by Megatron.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes...&quot; says Megatron as his eyes narrow, &quot;You were supposed to \n&gt; &gt; determine the usefullness of the artifacts, then take them \n&gt; &gt; outside... What happened?&quot; Demands the Pred leader.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well...&quot; mumbles Switchblade, &quot;I&#39;m, err, not 100% sure on that \n&gt; one. \n&gt; &gt; You see, I was looking at the pieces, and trying to put them \n&gt; &gt; together. Quite accidentally, I managed to fit them together. \nAbout \n&gt; &gt; that time, I suddenly blanked out, and woke up to find myself on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; ground, artifact in hand, and a impressively large slashed hole \nin \n&gt; &gt; the side of the storage bay wall, looks like it might have been \n&gt; &gt; melted.&quot; He finishes sheepishly, &quot;Lets check the security vids.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; before Megatron can say something that might decide his fate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade hops up, and walks over to the security panel. His \n&gt; &gt; fingers blur as he types and presses buttons on the console. A \nholo \n&gt; &gt; display appears in the middle of the room, and starts to play a \n&gt; &gt; recording of the storage bay incident.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It comes to the part when Switchblade blacked out, and Megatron \n&gt; &gt; watches the holo Switchblade go totally limp, and them raise the \n&gt; &gt; artifact over his head. Well, it was more like the artifact \nraised \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade. Then a bright light speared outward from the \nartifact, \n&gt; &gt; destroying the overloading the camera optics, effectively \ndisabling \n&gt; &gt; that camera it gets repaired.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Switchblade smiles triuphantly to himself, knowing that he&#39;s all \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; proved that he wasn&#39;t going against Megatron...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Turning back to Megatron, he is about ot say something, shen his \n&gt; jaw \n&gt; &gt; drops, as he finds himself looking into the large barrel of \n&gt; &gt; Megatron&#39;s plasma cannon. &quot;Uhh...&quot; &lt;I guess I did still screw \nup...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron smiles taking the thoughts from Switchblade&#39;s mind, &quot;You \n&gt; &gt; still screwed up, and must pay the prices.&quot; He fires the cannon \nat \n&gt; &gt; the minibot. The results are devastating... for Switchblade. He \n&gt; &gt; loses his right arm, leg, and his head immediately, and there is \n&gt; &gt; significant damage to his body as the blast smashes it against \nthe \n&gt; &gt; far wall.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Fool...&quot; says Megatron to himself as he opens a commlink to \n&gt; &gt; Inferno, &quot;Inferno, get over here into the control room, and clean \n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; this mess... Perceptor, begin repairs in the storage bay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He walks over to Switchblade&#39;s destroyed form, and picks up the \n&gt; &gt; single pieces of artifact. &quot;This doesn&#39;t look like the thing in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; security vid... maybe I should have let him live for a bit \n&gt; longer...&quot;\n\n\n"}}
