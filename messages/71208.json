Tucson had come out of stasis a little too soon.  She watches him \ncarefully.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re definitely right Rodimus, Tucson did come out of stasis too soon, \nbut try telling that ta the big guy. And yes, Rodimus is right Tucson, you \nare incredibly,and perpetually STUBBORN.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.\n\n&quot;I know I know, I do admit I am stubborn.  And perhaps even a little too \nmuch for my own good.  Rodimus, you&#39;re right, I could use more time, but I \nalso realize you need help, and for that I can not abandon your cause.  I \nwill do my best to realize my limits but at the same time assist you as well \nas I can. &quot;\n\nHe now walks toward a computer console, with a resolute expression.\n\n&quot; From what I&#39;ve been receiving, since I left my com link operative during \nstasis, and was able to hear fragments of it, during that time, we seem to \nhave an insecticon pressense in a far quadrant of the area&#39;s parameters. I \nam also aware that Night Shift is now on the search with Rat Trap, to find \nCheetor.  His intentions were in the right place, but like me, he tends to \nbite off more than he can chew. And I think we&#39;ve all been doing that a \nlittle bit lately.  Our forces are not as numberous as the opposing side, \nand perhaps it would help if our forces were expanded somehow.  The Autobots \nin the Ark are not due to awaken too soon, but it would benefit us if they \nwould.  The Maximals can not protect this planet by themselves, and it&#39;s \ntime I made sure they get the help they need.  There must be a way we can \nawaken the Ark..&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to them.\n\n&quot;Well?  Why don&#39;t you guys consult the Matrix?  I bet it would know, and \ngive you guys the guidence you need ta answer your questions. After all, \nyou&#39;re both Primes, right?&quot;\n\nTucson raises a brow.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s right.  Perhaps it&#39;s time we did consult the Matrix, Together.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight&#39;s hand weakly closed holding Rodimu&#39;s, It was acounsious act?\n&gt;\n&gt; She slowly started to move, then she opened her eyes and smiled when she \n&gt; looked a familiar face... A face that she knew who were but her confused \n&gt; mind couldnt focus enough to give it a name. Then she closed her eyes once \n&gt; more, her mind was between the awake and the sleep state.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Super Cyclonus\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 16, 2011 11:11 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: the ARK to awaken from sleep!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes sir, we&#39;ll do what we can... Aw maan, fine time to be without \n&gt; &gt; Tucson..\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded absently as he looked down at his wife as Elita is removed \n&gt; from the room. He is lost in thought, remembering the good times he had \n&gt; had with her. The day that their daughter was created, He could remember \n&gt; the fear he had when he realized what was going on with Nightlight, and \n&gt; how he so much wanted to wake Nightlight up from all this tragedy and just \n&gt; make everything alright for her.\n&gt;\n&gt; He turned back to look at Perceptor, reminded oddly enough of the old \n&gt; Percepetor he knew from eons ago â€“ or would that be eons from now. All \n&gt; this time travel stuff really made his head spin. But he still had a quiet \n&gt; confidence in the ex Predacon as he watched him prepare things.\n&gt;\n&gt; He got a call from Nightshift, and he paused for a moment in thought. Then \n&gt; he sent a message to Ramulus, &quot;Hurry and get out there as soon as you can. \n&gt; I am not sure what&#39;s going on, but it&#39;s definitely dangerous.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotcha boss.&quot; came Ramulus&#39; reply. &quot;I&#39;m on the way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He was about to look back at Nightlight when someone came into the room  . \n&gt; . .\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gently rubs her head, and enters the room where Rodimus is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I know what you&#39;ll tell me, and you&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t be out of \n&gt; &gt; stasis just yet, but, I couldn&#39;t help thinking about what would happen \n&gt; &gt; if I wasn&#39;t there to lend you support. Oh, and I thought you might want \n&gt; &gt; to say hello to Elita.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He smiles as he holds her close to Rodimus, waiting for him to hold her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita woke up and looking at her dad said &quot;Daddy, when will my mom wake\n&gt; &gt; up??&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus picked up Elita and smiled at her, &quot;It is good to see you little \n&gt; one.&quot; He said as he held her in his arms. I am hoping to wake mommy up as \n&gt; soon as I can.&quot; His voice was the higher pitched happy tones that adults \n&gt; use when trying to keep the younger children happy.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked over at Tuscon, &quot;It is good to see you Tuscon.&quot; While his words \n&gt; were grave, his voice was still pitched high so as not to alarm Elita. \n&gt; &quot;But don&#39;t you need a few hours more in the chamber before you are ready \n&gt; to come out?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor dryly said th Straight shot &quot;For the safely of this Girl, she \n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; to leave the room...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon, knowing he would not have enough time to pursue \n&gt; this. He looked at Straight Shot, &quot;Make sure he does not over do it. His \n&gt; injuries are probably not completely healed and he may over estimate what \n&gt; he can do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus pointedly handed Elita to Straight Shot so that Tuscon would not \n&gt; over do it trying to carry her, he did still have some healing to do, even \n&gt; if he was too stubborn to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The machine started to remove the Nightlight&#39;s coma status and decrease \n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; energy level to the minimal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus turned back to Nightlight as the machine started to work, He \n&gt; grasped her right hand in his and stared at her optics, smiling, hoping \n&gt; that his princess might awaken and remember who he was.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
