Her head started to real \nas she started drifting in and out of consiousness due to the pain. \nShe heard his thoughts, I&#39;m sorry Shadow Wing.  she projected to \nhim,&quot;What are you sorry for?&quot;  Then the stuff in the vial started to \nenter her systems.  The pain became over whelming. &quot;NOOOOOOOOO!&quot;\nShe kicked and punched and hit the walls inside the chamber.  Her \nbody was reforming.  It was almost too much.  She screamed out and \nhit the walls of the chamber. &quot;LET ME OUT!&quot;\n\nShe stopped hitting the walls as her body went into convulsions. her \narms and legs flailing around.  Her massive paws banged loudly \nagainst the walls.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC Sorry logo they&#39;re in ice and snow. no grass or flowers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bic: Veratis grabbed his temples feeling the pain Shadow Wing was \ngoing\n&gt; through. He grabbed her under the arms and helped her back to his \nlab. A CR\n&gt; chamber opened at his command and he placed her inside. It was as \nhe feared,\n&gt; the protoform in her was rejecting the Polarbear DNA. He stabilized \nher\n&gt; condition for now but ran the risk of losing her if nothing was \ndone soon.\n&gt; He scanned her system and found every cell in her body \ndeteriorating. He saw\n&gt; no other action open to him. He opened a compartment on the wall \nand removed\n&gt; the vial. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Shadow Wing&quot;He thought as he approached the \nchamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Override Viral search.&quot; he instructed the computer while carefully \ncarrying\n&gt; the vial to the chamber. He injected the liquid into the CR \nchambers intake\n&gt; hose and in turn into Shadow Wings system. Now all he could do was \nwait for\n&gt; the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 03, 2000 9:04 AM\n&gt; Subject: Shadow Wing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She walked around looking for Veratis.  She finally found him and\n&gt; &gt; smiled. &quot;I like this new form.  I can see so much better now. The\n&gt; &gt; grass is greener, the sky is bluer, the flowers have such vibrant\n&gt; &gt; color.  ANd my sence of smell is wild. I can smell a rabbit that \nis\n&gt; &gt; in the next sector almost.   It&#39;s great. I don&#39;t know how to\n&gt; &gt; thank....&quot; she looked at him as a wave of pain ran over her.  She\n&gt; &gt; fell to the ground and groaned. The new programs were in conflict\n&gt; &gt; with te form and it&#39;s new abilities. She sent the mental message \nof\n&gt; &gt; fear and pain without realizing it.  She tried to get up but fell\n&gt; &gt; over again. &quot;what&#39;s happening? what&#39;s wrong with....&quot; she groaned\n&gt; &gt; loudly and let out a low bear growl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
