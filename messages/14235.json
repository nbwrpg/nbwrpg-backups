She opened the door to\n&gt; the chamber and stepped out.  She had her head lowered and felt like\n&gt; crying.  She knew she would feel bad for killing Land Mine, but she\n&gt; never imagined the internal torture she would have to endure.  In her\n&gt; mind, she kept replaying the event over and over.  Wishing she could\n&gt; correct or undo what has been done.  She didn&#39;t even look up to see\n&gt; who was around her.  Without a word, she went to her room and sat on\n&gt; the edge of the bed. She closed her eyes and whispered,&quot;Will you ever\n&gt; forgive me Land Mine?  Will you ever give me peace?&quot;  She made no\n&gt; sound.  She only let the tears roll down her cheeks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
