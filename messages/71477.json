He looked very small as compared to his much larger\n&gt; breth=\r\nren who lay &#39;dead&#39; on the floor, since he, like everyone else\n&gt; here was ne=\r\narly the size of a human in his robot mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I wish we could give them=\r\n some note, some piece of knowledge that\n&gt; would help them make choices and=\r\n perhaps even make a difference.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS came and stood next to WHEEL=\r\nIE. &quot;I can&#39;t pretend to know all\n&gt; the ins and outs of all the temporal stu=\r\nff.&quot; he said, his voice one of\n&gt; a soldier rather than a technician or theo=\r\nritician.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If you want all the answers as to what and why, Legacy woul=\r\nd\n&gt; probrably have all the answers.&quot; RODIMUS said thoughtfully as he gazed\n=\r\n&gt; about again. &quot;But I do believe that that mech came from a future where\n&gt; =\r\nthings were changed and the destruction that followed. He was their\n&gt; last =\r\nditch effort to fix it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS shook his head as he looked back at W=\r\nHEELIE, &quot;I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; face a future like that.&quot; He clapped WHEELIE on =\r\nthe shoulder in a\n&gt; friendly gesture, &quot;But if you could, what kind of messa=\r\nge would you\n&gt; send them?&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a quiet pause over from Wheel=\r\nie as he tried to think of something, something meaningful but also short a=\r\nnd to the point.\n\n&quot;A difference..  They made.  That seems right, to comfort=\r\n, we gave.  That&#39;s as much as we can say..  To let them know things shall b=\r\ne right someday.  Without giving all away.  I think they would appreciate i=\r\nt most in their own way.&quot;\n\nLooking over the bays of the Ark, &quot;So many of th=\r\nem, end up dead.  Blasted apart, in the head.  Sparks destroyed, ripped abo=\r\nut, tossed into darkness and space and out.  Is that how we all end up some=\r\nday?  Caught up in nohtingness and all away?&quot;\n\nHe shrugs, &quot;the future is al=\r\nready too far gone, how can we say what we do shall go on?&quot;\n\nGlancing over =\r\nat the direction where Megatron would lie, someday, &quot;We already know his ga=\r\nme.  To change the past and remake his name.  How can we say that anything =\r\nis ever doen?  When the future can be unmade, the lost war rewon?  When he =\r\ncan just send something else to the past?  Explaining how he unmade his cha=\r\nnce?  Is that not what Megatron might do?  Try and unmake the past to make =\r\nhis future true?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
