I never said you broke the rule.  I \nsaid you shouldn&#39;t have a gestalt because you couldn&#39;t RP with it correctly.  \nHmmm...you blew off War Machine&#39;s ARM, that&#39;s because the arms are mine, \nisn&#39;t it, Yan?)\n\n\n\nThe Oblitercons/Sixshot/Unitron/Serpentor/Demon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh \nRipper/Ares/Minion:\n\n\n\n\nMinion crashed to the ground in the shape of the left arm that had been blown \noff of War Machine, continuing with momentum on the ground for a cycle, then \nstopping.\n\n---\n\nDark One barrell rolled, escaping autogun fire, letting two missiles loose \ndownward at the Mafia Base.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown cursed, not seeing any body parts fly.  He obviously hadn&#39;t hit a \ntarget.  He fired off a grenade at Shokaract.\n\n---\n\nThe three missiles explode, driving Pyro back several feet, leaving the front \nend of his tank mode dented and charred.  &quot;FLAMES CAN&#39;T HURT ME!&quot; he \nscreamed, firing off three fire balls at Shokaract.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three fusion blasts at Shokaract.\n\n---\n\nScavenger took out his missile launcher.  Surprisingly, he was the only \nOblitercon WITH a missile launcher they could take out of subspace.  Raising \nhis rifle, he fired off 25 explosive shells at the Mafia Base, followed by a \nrocket from his bazooka.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf fired off three optic blasts at the Mafia Base.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off a long burst of flames at the Mafia Base from his \nmouth.\n\n---\n\n&quot;FALL!&quot; Dark Claw yelled, throwing two orbs of energy, one from each palm, at \nthe Mafia Base, each a little stronger than a grenade.\n\n---\n\nSixshot dived, launching two missiles down at the Mafia Base.  &quot;Your deaths \nshall be imminent.&quot;\n\n---\n\nSerpentor hissed, charging Shokaract, his energy blade in one hand, his \nplasma rifle in the other.  &quot;Time to die!&quot; he yelled as he fired off three \nbolts from his rifle at Shokaract&#39;s abdomen.\n\n===\n\nAres slowly walked into the Alliance Base, heading for the CR chambers.
