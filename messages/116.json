She spins \nher staff end around and slices the side of Dinobot&#39;s left leg. She kicks at \nthe same leg with the heel of her foot, hoping to throw him off balance.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2000 16:29:17 PDT\n&gt;\n&gt;* The shot to the back causes Dinobot to go down to one knee but he springs\n&gt;back up and without turning brings his tail up and across Tavatron&#39;s hand,\n&gt;breaking her staff in two.\n&gt;He smiled to himself, he was wondering when she would decide to show\n&gt;herself!\n&gt;Dinobot turns around, grabs Tavatron around the waist with his arm and \n&gt;bring\n&gt;her to him. The move was simple but deadly! He&#39;d done this exact thing with\n&gt;many bots before and knew that it didn&#39;t take smarts to pull it off. He \n&gt;knew\n&gt;electrically what to do next.\n&gt;Dinobot began to contract his arm and squeeze hard enough that he knew that\n&gt;she would feel the air beginning to escape her lungs! If this battle had\n&gt;been for real then he would soon feel the satisfying snap of a broken \n&gt;spine!\n&gt;He snarled fiercely!*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Clever! Very clever! But it is also clever to take a few steps back after\n&gt;striking an enemy so they cannot strike back so easily!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Dinobot squeezed a little harder, he had nothing against Tavatron for\n&gt;striking him, that was the aim of the practice. He just simply wanted to\n&gt;show her that he was not so easily defeated!*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
