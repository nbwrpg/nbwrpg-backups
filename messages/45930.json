All have good \nstory-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be eliminate  \nless importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could choice \nat whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are member \nthat aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters \nplaying. \n\nThat other way than restart.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not only \nam I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, despite \nthe general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been here \nfor getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this \nrestart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG is \nrestarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), and \ntherefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think I \ncould vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have \ndecided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the saga \nof Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over the \nyears to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend it \nnever happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and \nstarted the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my vote \nis no.
