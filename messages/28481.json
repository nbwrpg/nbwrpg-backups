He hadn&#39;t meant to do it, but \nhe felt bad about it anyways. Menasor was going to pay for this. Element \nsped up after Menasor, quickly gaining on him. He fired four more missiles \nat him, one from every missile launcher, but this time he mentally guided \nthem toward Menasor&#39;s back and well away from Firearm.\n\nIn Element&#39;s mind, the portion of him that was Mantle was pushing forward to \nget Firearm back. He wasn&#39;t going to let Menasor escape. Mantle was a bot \nwho valued his friends, and he considered Firearm a friend now that he had \nfelt his mind. Element tried to tackle Menasor as he got close, speeding up \nas he did so.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
