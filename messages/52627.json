Gatara dodges a couple of shots while the remainder pock-\nmark her flank.  In return, she slaps a new magazine of ammo into her \nmachine gun and fires again, this time aiming for Kenzo&#39;s rotor \nassembly.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CatMaster o&quot; &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kenzo&#39;s armor took most of the weapon fire however the windshield\n&gt; cracked.
