The skies are\nfairly li=\r\nt with smoke, fire and bright lights as the Maximals and\nAutobots attempt t=\r\no defend themselves and their position. EMP rounds,\nwhile missing their int=\r\nended targets still disrupt the sweeps\ntargeting locks for a moment a send =\r\ntheir radar systems into temporary\nshut down. This allows Talon=92s weapons=\r\n fire to find a home, brining\ndown yet another sweep, leaving two of them i=\r\nn the air overhead.\n\nMeanwhile Tuscon is able to get an assessment of the s=\r\nituation as\nthere are currently no combatants on the ground. The sweeps are=\r\n down\nto two now, well under half the number they started out with. However=\r\n\nhe can see in the distance there are more sweeps rising from an open\ndoor =\r\nat the tower, and there are others as well. He still can get a\nbead on the =\r\nsweeps, but the others rising up he had met before =96 the\nsoldiers Cyclonu=\r\ns had brought the tower when Tuscon was trying to\nfight his way out. Howeve=\r\nr as the tower is still many kilometers away\nit will take a little bit of t=\r\nime for them to reach his position.\n\n**************************************=\r\n*************************************\n\nMeanwhile at the tower itself Rat Tr=\r\nap and Windlord are unable to find\na true &#39;hole&#39; in the tower itself. There=\r\n does not appear to be any\nopen vents or handy cracks that lead thier way i=\r\nn. All the vents are\ncurrently closed, firmly and securely, and they would =\r\nneed to be,\nafter all this is a tower designed to descend into liquid rock.=\r\n\nHowever they are able to find a spot where the walls on the upper\ntower ju=\r\nt out slightly, a small crevass. However it is very small, and\nit in no way=\r\n leads into the tower itself, but it is merely a small\ncubby hole type stru=\r\ncture.\n\nThe only way discernable into the tower itself, short of blowing a\n=\r\nhole in the wall, and judgingh by the material of the wall this would\ntake =\r\na lot of firepower, the only way in is the large door that the\nsoldiers had=\r\n just left from - the door that is even now continuing to\nclose.\n\n*********=\r\n******************************************************************\n\nAt the =\r\nArk there is no answer to Quickstride&#39;s challenge. The air that\nhad rippled=\r\n before stopped, or atleast it was no longer visible to\nhim.\n\n&quot;What do you =\r\nsee?&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice comes over the speaker. &quot;My sensors\naren&#39;t picking up =\r\nanyth . . .&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice goes silent as the world\naround Quickstride goe=\r\ns completely dark. He cannot see anything, not\neven his hand in front of hi=\r\ns face, nor can he hear anything, not even\nthe sound of his own voice. It i=\r\ns like his audio and visual sensors\nhave gone offline.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n(TA=\r\nG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
