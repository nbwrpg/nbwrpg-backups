I can&#39;t figure it out but something is making \nthe mane on my neck stand on end..  Sorta like a horsefly ya can&#39;t shake \noff...&quot;\n\nTucson acknowledges Rodimus quickly.\n\n&quot; Thank you for the intel Rodimus.  Now I will be able to keep my sensors \nopen for any wave disturbances.  Ususally my sonar systems only pick up on \nsolid objects, but there is a chance that fluxuations in energy waves, can \nbe detected via echolocation.  My systems are up and running now..  But \nthere&#39;s one flaw, that kind of detection system is short range.  If there&#39;s \nany disturbances long range, I will not be able to detect them.  I will do \nthe best I can to keep alert.&quot;\n\nHe rolls on with caution, trying not to kick up any dirt, or disturb \nanything around him.  As tires roll over uneven ground his trailer rocks \nslightly as he tries hard to avoid too much movement from it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From his observation post, Quickstride could sense the worry in \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt; voice. He too was worried and continues to keep his ears and eyes peeled \n&gt; in\n&gt; all directions. He paws his left front hoof.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just what I was thinkn&#39; Rodimus. I wonder if they got tipped off about\n&gt; our plan of action.. Slippery stuff when there&#39;s a mole involved that we\n&gt; don&#39;t know about..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From where Night Shift was, he could not see the seekers, yet, just by \n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; radar systems, he could definitely tell that there was a flying brigade\n&gt; around the fortress. He slowly comes to a stop.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Be careful out there.&quot; Rodimus said as something came to mind with the \n&gt; talk\n&gt; about a mole, &quot;I remember that one of the new guys could turn invisible.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus paused trying to remember who it was, but finally continued, &quot;I am\n&gt; not sure which one, they had just arrived. One of them could easily be\n&gt; watching us and we would never know it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Keep in mind, unless you are at or near the Pred base scanning it \n&gt; would\n&gt; be difficult. The same can be said for the Maximal base. If you&#39;re at the\n&gt; pred base, scanning the Max base would be next to impossible without some\n&gt; sort of satellite or specialized gear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I got an idea. It&#39;s a long shot, no pun intended but it might work. I \n&gt; &gt; am\n&gt; equipped with long range equipment. What if Kup used me as a cross bow, to\n&gt; take out some of those seekers, create a diversion so that way Windlord \n&gt; and\n&gt; Rat Trap could make it inside?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift spins a tire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I dunno, sounds risky... What if they barrel after us? I ain&#39;t a\n&gt; speedster.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks at him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s worth a shot. Let&#39;s run it by Tucson.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson now recieves a message from Straight Shot. He ponders the daring\n&gt; move.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, that would work as a diversion but it&#39;s extremely risky... But\n&gt; nothing we&#39;ve never dealth with before.. All right, perhaps it is necesary\n&gt; to make a move. Straight Shot, Kup, I want you to position yourselves as\n&gt; best you can. Kup, take robot mode, Straight Shot, cross bow mode, and\n&gt; program your trajectory settings to long range. Be sure to conceal\n&gt; yourselves amply. Night Shift, I&#39;ll need you to remain in vehicle mode, \n&gt; for\n&gt; a quick getaway. Rodimus, Quickstride, it has now come to my attention \n&gt; that\n&gt; unless a diversion is executed, Rat Trap and Windlord may not make it into\n&gt; the fortress safely. Straight Shot is going to provide the diversion along\n&gt; with Kup&#39;s help. Be prepared, once this diversion is in place, we may need\n&gt; you two to get into battle mode to fend off any seeker that tries to \n&gt; attempt\n&gt; an attack on the Ark. I know these changes are sudden, but unfortunately,\n&gt; there is a lot of uncertainty in this mission. All right, battle stations\n&gt; everyone, things are about to get rocky.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Out ahead of the group the sweeps continue to fly through the air, \n&gt; seemingly\n&gt; unaware of the Maximals and Autobots that are preparing for their attack.\n&gt; They swoop around, obviously in some sort of patrol pattern, flying first\n&gt; over one section and then over another. Their movements are surprisingly\n&gt; well orchestrated, they are either seasoned hunters or they have been\n&gt; trained by one who is. The air beneath their flight path rippled with \n&gt; heat,\n&gt; the magma beneath them was incredibly hot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I gotcha.&quot; Rodimus said over the radio comlink to Tuscon. &quot;We are ready\n&gt; here back at the base should anyone of the Predacons get foolish and \n&gt; attack\n&gt; us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus paused and then continued, &quot;Also, I think I remember that one of \n&gt; the\n&gt; new guys that came with Cyclonus when he returned could turn invisible, \n&gt; and\n&gt; I think even teleport. I can&#39;t remember which one, but be very careful out\n&gt; there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
