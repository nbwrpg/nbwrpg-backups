She \npulled her Lazer Sabre out of her subspace pocket and poised herself \nfor a potential confrontation. She had an inkling things would get \nmessy.\n    Blindchaos&#39;s eyes twinkled with laughter. Internally he hoped \nFirestrike would reallt tick Menasor off and Megatron would let \nBlindchaos play with his left overs....if anything remained when he \nwas done.
