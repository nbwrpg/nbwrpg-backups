There was a big storm and we lost power.)\n\nTavatron:\n\nThe artificial lights reflected off of her optics, giving them an almost glowing appearence. Hunting, outdoors, with live prey... she hadn&#39;t done that in ages. Tavatron absentmindedly scratched her wrist, a somewhat nervous look on her face. She turned her head to the side and thought for a moment. Did she really want to go through it again?\n\nTavatron&#39;s mind flashed back to a time when things had been calmer, more... peaceful. Herself and a pack of fellow wolves had gone hunting, only she had been unable to &#39;pull her own weight&#39; so to speak. \n\nThey had groaned and whispered behind her back everytime she had snapped a branch, or gone left when she should have gone right. There was also the time she had slipped off a bank and fallen into a river, but she preferred not to think about that.\n\nThe bottom line was, despite her appearence, she was a lousy huntress. Tavatron cleared her throat and regained her composure. She wasn&#39;t one for admitting her weaknesses:\n\n&quot;Very well, we shall hunt.&quot; \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
