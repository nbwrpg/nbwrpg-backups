He turned and looked at\nRodimus and Tuscon through the glass, his hands behind his back. He\nfelt rather than saw Torca and Bantor come to stand behind him, all of\nthem watching the struggle that was going on, on the others side.\n\nThey watched as Santon, Bump and Legacy, perhaps the best technicians\nthat they had available worked on Rodimus, thier movements swift and\nefficient. Silverbolt did not normally go in for the whole spiritual\nside of things, but he could not help but to clench his fists and hope\nwith ever fibre of his being that Rodimus would pull through.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
