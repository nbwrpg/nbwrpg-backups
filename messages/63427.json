She\nreally wanted to have more time with him, but she tld herself that the\nMatrix just had it in for her.  Her scanners showed a signal that came\nin close and then trailed off. &quot;Hmm, could be trouble.&quot;  Her optics\nflashed red then back to normal. &quot;Ohhh, I hope it is. I am in the mood\nfor kicking some slag. Or something else.&quot;  She gave him a teasing\nlook. Her honor programs told her she was in the mood for an oil\nchange more than anything. Then turned and faced the direction of the\nsignal. &quot;Let&#39;s proceed with caution.&quot;  She tranformed into wolf mode\nand started running towards the signal. Who needs caution anyway, she\ntold herself. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice::\n&gt;  \n&gt; Malice checked Wolfblade&#39;s reading with his own sensor array,\nconfirming the signal.  He was about to make another wise crack when\nshe leaned up and kissed him a second time.  He paused mid stride to\nkiss her back, and had to break the tender moment as his sensors\npicked up movement close by.  He looked in the direction the signal\ncame from, trying to pin down signal&#39;s sourse.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Something or someone is out there, watching us,&quot; he said softly,\nnot wanting to let this observer get away unpunished should the need\narise.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
