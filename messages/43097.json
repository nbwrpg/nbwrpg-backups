It opens as a bot steps out. He is a camo painted \nhelicoptor,\n&gt; &gt; wearing the Autobot logo. He had just come back online after being\n&gt; &gt; deactivated by Decepticons, not to long ago. He had learned that\n&gt; &gt; hundreds of years had passed. He found out about the Neo Beast \n&gt; Wars, and\n&gt; &gt; had reconfigured himself to fit the modern day transformer.(The \nG1 \n&gt; to BW\n&gt; &gt; size problem, activation code, etc.) He set his communication \n&gt; system to\n&gt; &gt; record.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;To any Maximal or possibly Autobot forces in the neo Beast Wars, \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; is the Autobot Skyburst. If you read me please make contact. I \nwish \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; join a Maximal or Autobot faction.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He set the message to play looped on incoded Maximal and Autobot\n&gt; &gt; channels. He waited.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I would prefer him to join an Autobot group. Anyway he looks \n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; the Sandstorm Machine Wars toy.\n\n\n"}}
