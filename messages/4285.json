I also adjusted the scanners for another \n300 feet outside normal range.  Quickstrike mentionted that this cave has no \nback door and I am currently in the back cavern makeing calculations for at \nleast two escape tunnels out of here.

We must destroy the\n&gt;enemy colony for the Queen!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Black Aracnia ::: Shut up hot head, we know what were doing. You tunnle\n&gt;us in, and we do the damage. Rampage?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: In his beast mode, he sits in the back, almost sulking over something,\n&gt;his attention elsewhere. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Rampage ::: I can smell them. They know we are here, I can sense the\n&gt;adreniline rushing to there juicy heads...\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Black Aracnia ::: ...I bet you do. Now, lets do this!\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Waspinator was now deep within the forest with Shredder, going to get \n&gt;the\n&gt;scrap they needed. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Waspinator, in the front leading because he felt he was better than\n&gt;Shredder, ::: Waspinator thinks we should go that way! Waspinator commands\n&gt;that we go that way!\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron takes a small break from construction and sees the two \n&gt;Predacon\n&gt;blips on his scanners that are Shredder and Waspinator. He sighs, and turns\n&gt;to Darkmouse. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: Darkmouse, report. How our are systems functioning?\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine looks to the screen with Hell Beast&#39;s face on it. He had finally\n&gt;gotten a message to him. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: General Marine, change the towers radition beakon to the\n&gt;Maximal frequency. Were going to attack them and with out communications \n&gt;they\n&gt;will not be able to get reinforcements.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine looked to Pheniox who typed in a few codes. The insignia on the\n&gt;computer screen changed from the Newcomers Predacon face, the the Maximals\n&gt;animal face. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine ::: It is done Commander.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Good. Wait there, im sure there will be someone \n&gt;attacking,\n&gt;although we could use you at the Maximal base....no matter. Remain there.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Marine nodded, and the computer switched off. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~`\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set, followed by Ra and Ominous come to the ship to see Defector \n&gt;standing\n&gt;outside of it, talking to someone. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: Who the hell is this now?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Ra&#39;s hands glow with flames ::: I will burn them alive!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: No you idiot, they are talking to Shuko.
