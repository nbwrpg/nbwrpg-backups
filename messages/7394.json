It was nearly\n&gt; pitch black at the end of it. He activated his infra red vision to make it\n&gt; easier to see. The farther it walked down, the more confusing it got. It\n&gt; looked like it went at a dead end.\n&gt;\n&gt; He stopped and tilted his head, musing at what was behind his optics.\nBelow\n&gt; him, he heard the slight trickle of water. He looked down and saw at least\n&gt; an inch of water touching his feet, enough to make the ridges on the\nbottom\n&gt; of his feet disappear. He thought there must be a water source within the\n&gt; cave.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just as he was about to step ahead, he went down. It felt like the ground\n&gt; had collapsed--with the splash. The puddle of water that filled the hold\n&gt; area turned into a pool. Quickstrike twisted and turned, trying to find\nwhat\n&gt; way was up.\n&gt;\n&gt; He righted himself and tried his luck. His head surfaced, coughing from\n&gt; surprise. After he got a breath, he felt something pull at him. There was\na\n&gt; tug, then a violent yank. He was again pulled underwater. But this time he\n&gt; couldn&#39;t fight to get back up to the surface. Something had his leg,\npulling\n&gt; him.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Missing old school friends?
