In truth you are coward that \ngets off all killing women and weak oppenets and you dare lecture me. That&#39;s \nwhy when I was a newbie you always put me through the streets but what got \nyou is I got up and said &quot;Is that all you got?&quot;  And on the Leadership do you \nreally think I care so much about leader is just a title a true leader is \ncreated by his actions not his name. Also that phrase the Its end of the Road \nscares you because you know that there is someone out there is going to stop \nand it may not be me because fate has a way of punishing evil.  But even if \ndo lose to you a million times there is always a million and 1 so I&#39;m never \ngoing to give up.  I owe that to the newbies you butchered in chat rooms and \nto one close friend you killed so in truth you don&#39;t win until I give \nup.JP3884 if you want to beg to stay dream on. \nBut discard fusion cannon even though I have it Yanshosh says I can&#39;t use it.\n\n"}}
