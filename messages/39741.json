He \nwas far from immobile, and although his wheels were damaged, he was \nstill moving at some insane speed. Woahh&#39;s shots hit him in the rear \nand he swerved around.

Each blast then combined and swirled in the air \nbefore a \n&gt;   singular massive blast flew straight down at Trainwreck.

The \n&gt;   &gt;   clouds above begins to swirl. Thunder begins to crackle as \nthe \n&gt;   sounds of \n&gt;   &gt;   transforming can be heard from a above a second later the \nclouds \n&gt;   literally \n&gt;   &gt;   are sent scattering as a massive &quot;meched out&quot; double headed \n&gt;   dragon around 45 \n&gt;   &gt;   feet tall descends from them, its massive wings flapping \nwildly \n&gt;   as 18 square \n&gt;   &gt;   like objects surround it. Both heads roar loudly and then \nspeak \n&gt;   at the same \n&gt;   &gt;   time their voice having an echo to it. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Gemini Dragon: &quot;Destruction shall be dealt unto all...&quot; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;   Vile looks up at the massive beast and smirks before he flys \nback \n&gt;   and away \n&gt;   &gt;   from Trainwreck a nice Distance. Methos who is ontop of \n&gt;   Trainwreck also looks \n&gt;   &gt;   up at Gemini Dragon. He then somehow sweatdrops and then flys \noff \n&gt;   Trainwreck \n&gt;   &gt;   as if he was being chased by an army of Maximals with spark \n&gt;   extractors. Up in \n&gt;   &gt;   the air the Gemini Dragon&#39;s right head shoots forward and \n&gt;   unleashes a massive \n&gt;   &gt;   stream of flame at Trainwreck, at the same time the left head \n&gt;   shoots out a \n&gt;   &gt;   nice large stream of liquid Nitrogen at the wheels of the \nchosen \n&gt;   mafia \n&gt;   &gt;   member... From the front Vile unleashes another two \nantimatter \n&gt;   blasts at \n&gt;   &gt;   Trainwreck. \n&gt;   &gt;   Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
