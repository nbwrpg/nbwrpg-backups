What had they \ndone?! \n&gt; \n&gt;   He pushes past a few nWo members, including Heartbreak. He kneels \nin front of Phoenix, but he did not touch her. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Wolfenstein: Phoenix, it&#39;s Wolf. What&#39;s wrong with you? Do you \nneed help? \n&gt; \n&gt;   Wolfenstein didn&#39;t care if he was looking weak in front of the \nboys. He wanted to help her. He really hoped she could see that he \nmeant no harm. \n&gt; \n&gt;   The preceding has been paid for by the \n&gt; \n&gt;   New World Order \n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt;     OOC: You underestimate the inevitable pain threshold of someone \nwho&#39;s \n&gt;     alternately been a punching bag, target practice, and \noccasionally a \n&gt;     sex toy for nine years.  Phoenix has to be taking a huge whale \nof a \n&gt;     beating before she actually screams in pain.  A branding torch \n&gt;     doesn&#39;t cut it - no pun intended.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Phoenix::\n&gt; \n&gt;     The femme doesn&#39;t give them the statisfaction of hearing her \nscream \n&gt;     during the branding, although several pained grunts escape her \n&gt;     gritted teeth.  Phoenix knows how to deal with pain, and she \nfocuses \n&gt;     on anything but the burning of her own body to bear the torment \nin \n&gt;     relative silence.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Heartbreak&#39;s treatment is another matter.  As she lands hard on \nher \n&gt;     back, memories surface of the things Clawful did to her, and \nPhoenix \n&gt;     scrambles away, standing up and backing into a corner.  \nTrembling, \n&gt;     the femme tries to calm herself - there&#39;s no way it could be as \nbad \n&gt;     as before, she rationalizes, since HBK doesn&#39;t have claws he \ncould \n&gt;     spear her to the floor with for starters.  It doesn&#39;t work - \nher mind \n&gt;     keeps superimposing the image of the Rogue berserker over \nHeartbreak.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Fear grips her spark compartment with an icy hand.  Seemingly \nin \n&gt;     response to the threat, she feels her unstable mutant spark \nflare up \n&gt;     and send hot tendrils of energy throughout her body.  Even more \n&gt;     terrified of her own poorly understood powers than of anything \nthe \n&gt;     nWo might do to her, she tries to suppress the reaction to no \navail.\n&gt; \n&gt;     The first external indication that something has gone very \nwrong is \n&gt;     when Phoenix drops to her knees, her arms wrapped around her \nchest \n&gt;     like she&#39;s trying to keep herself from exploding, and that&#39;s \nnot far \n&gt;     from the truth.  Strange energy patterns begin sparking across \nher \n&gt;     frame.  (Think when the BW characters get energon deep-fried, \nonly \n&gt;     the lightning is orange instead of blue.)\n\n\n"}}
