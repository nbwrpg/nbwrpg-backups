She was annoyed more or less with the \nPredacon. \n&gt; Curious as to who placed her in charge. Again, she was very \nsimilar to \n&gt; Starscream. Those who grabbed too much power & openly spoke of it, \neventually \n&gt; found a quick demise. This was fact & observation, not her own \nbeliefs. She \n&gt; never wanted command, even though she wanted to be Megatron&#39;s 2nd \nin command, \n&gt; commanding others was not her priority, it was being Megatron&#39;s \nbest of the \n&gt; best that mattered most to her. That ideal & way of conduct \nactually got her \n&gt; places. \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to Blackstorm. &quot;Now... pardon for the interruption. \nThings of this \n&gt; sort will happen. However, fighting til each of us are terminated \nor heavily \n&gt; damaged is not a way of existing any more. Nor have I that power \nto attempt \n&gt; that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Kitkat had some truth. Skills in hand to hand is important. \nExample... the \n&gt; old battles between Megatron & Optimus Prime... or any other old \ncomrade of \n&gt; mine & our enemies the Autobots. There will be close combat. \nThat&#39;s a \n&gt; guarantee.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She leaned back against the console again, crossing her \narms. &quot;However, one \n&gt; needs to know their limits & their abilities in order to hone in \ntheir \n&gt; skills. Know your weapons. The weapons you have is important. They \nare highly \n&gt; effective at the right time. Useless in other situations. \nCunning.. \n&gt; strategy.. tact.... intelligence... these are important as well. \nLoyalty is a \n&gt; factor. Know what you are fighting for. Know your comrades as to \nwho you can \n&gt; trust & who you cannot. Know your comrades as well as your \nenemies, their \n&gt; skills.. their weapons.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Standing she started to pace towards Blackstorm in a confident \nwaltz, \n&gt; &quot;Importantly, the importance of the Decepticons & the cause far \nexceeds your \n&gt; personal vendetas. never forget that, Blackstorm. The cause is \nyour first \n&gt; priority. Everything else... can wait.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
