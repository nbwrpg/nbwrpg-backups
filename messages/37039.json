He prepares \nto \n&gt; open fire again when he hears the whistling sound of missiles and \n&gt; turns around to see Incarcinators right infront of him. All three \n&gt; collide with him and cause a massive explosion to come about then \n&gt; some autogun blasts and all 25 of Atillas shots strike the energy \n&gt; being while it is surrounded in the flame of the missiles. As the \n&gt; smoke and fire clear, Hellpeon  seemingly floats there with a huge \n&gt; hole in his stomach as well as some in his arms and legs. The beast \n&gt; roars as it outstretches its arms and the wound in his stomach \nbegins \n&gt; to regenerate hastily as the holes in his arms dissapear all \n&gt; together. The beast looks to Attilla as its eyes glow a bright red. \n&gt; Quickly the beast flys over to him and opens fire on him with 10 \n&gt; beams of chaochitan energy until he is in a fairly close distance...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Autoguns continue fireing at the invaders.\n\n\n"}}
