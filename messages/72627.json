That old\n&gt; dragon must&#39;ve been a guardian of some sort, and knew that his land was in\n&gt; trouble.  But how did he know that he could entrust Tucson with his job?\n&gt; How did he know that my pal was so different than the others?  And why\n&gt; didn&#39;t Tucson get a piece of the Matrix but has it&#39;s power?  Is he gett&#39;n\n&gt; singled out for some reason?  &quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLORD ELDER shook his head, &quot;Who know why the Matrix chose Tuscon or\nany of the other Primes for that matter?&quot; ELDER said in thoughtful\ntones. &quot;But you may already know that not all Primes have a shard of\nthe Matrix, like Optimus Primal. Then again there have been those who\nnever had the title Prime who carried the Matrix, like Ultra Magnus or\neven Alpha Trion.&quot;\n\nHe sighed, &quot;It may just have been that the Matrix realized that there\nwas no Prime at the time and knew that there needed one.&quot;\n\nGesturing broadly again LORD ELDER continued shook his head, &quot;But is\nniether here nor there. In any case, I have explained to you at least\nsome of the history of the Earth, the last section is, that the\nWatchers who were tasked with observing the Earth were now tasked with\nwatching the Minions - watching for any sign of Unicronian activity.\nWe were based in the Antarctic in a tower called Cryonosis.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER frowned slightly, &quot;It is this base, which was connected to\na satalite that we had in space that allowed us keep track of the\nMinions and even to a lesser extent the Predacons.&quot;\n\nHe looked up at POLAR CLAW, RAMULUS, WOLFGANG, PROWL and finally at\nNIGHTSHIFT, &quot;What none of you may know is that recently we . . . I . .\n. have lost contact with the base and the satalite. We are blind as to\nwhat is going on with the minions or anything else for that matter.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
