She shook a little and sat there \nstaring at the flo=\r\nor. She still had tears running down her face.  She \nsobbed a bit longer th=\r\nen wiped her face with her hand. &quot; I wanted to \nthank you for letting me st=\r\nay here. I appreciate it.&quot;  She hung her \nhead and her shoulders. She kept =\r\nlooking at the floor as tears ran \ndown her cheeks again.  She whispered, &quot;=\r\nThey frightened me.

At =\r\nFeline&#39;s introduction she simply\nnodded, \nready to \n&gt; listen to this new bo=\r\nt&#39;s story and to decipher if she was\neither \ntrue friend \n&gt; or a foe in the=\r\n image of another.\n&gt; As Feline began to relate the story of how she had com=\r\ne to be there \nIron \n&gt; Raptor listened intently, taking in everything that =\r\nthis fembot \nrelated to \n&gt; her.\n&gt; By the time that she was through with her=\r\n tragic telling she was on \nher \n&gt; knees and held her hands to her face, se=\r\nemingly in utter despair \nbut not \n&gt; without sympathy=85even slightly.\n&gt; It=\r\n was strange, but for some odd reason that story that Feline had \nrelated \n=\r\n&gt; didn&#39;t sound as real as she was sure the fembot intended it to\nbe. \nBut t=\r\nhere \n&gt; was still nothing that she could use as a solid factor against her,=\r\n \nother \n&gt; then she had been with the Alliance for a time and might have \nl=\r\nearned \n&gt; something vital about them.\n&gt; But with the fembot on her knees in=\r\n the corner, now wasn&#39;t the\ntime \nto \n&gt; question her.\n&gt; Iron Raptor walked =\r\nover to the crying Feline and held out a hand to \nher, \n&gt; actually feeling =\r\nsympathy for the little cat-bot.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Come on, get to your feet.
