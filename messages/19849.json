That was just a random comment stimulated by my \ndesire \n&gt; to run a sharp blade through the Arizona Opera Productor&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see nothing wrong with the post, Ryo, except for how would you \nget \n&gt; ice spikes in Saudi Arabia?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/WarMachine/Bloodystrike/Reptilica/DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; WarMachine roars, his scanners locking on to Koj&#39;s signature, even \n&gt; though it was a shaky lock due to the cloaking device. Running at \nhim \n&gt; and Inu, WarMachine approaches from behind, firing missiles at the \n&gt; two.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;Shields, reactivate!&quot; Zardus orders, seeing the trees flying at \nthe \n&gt; Alliance base. Jumping back as the shields reactivate, Zardus, \nalong \n&gt; with the autoguns, fires at the trees that manage to get through, \nice \n&gt; and wood chunks showering him, but nothing major. He takes a step \n&gt; back to keep his balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind him, Reptilica gives a pained yelp as he is hit by a large \n&gt; wood piece, sending him falling backwards into the Alliance base. \n&gt; Bloodystrike ducks behind the door as he sees the wood flying at \nhim, \n&gt; evading it and watching some of it land on Reptilica. He ducks his \n&gt; head out of the doorway, firing at Inu.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer looks up into the vent, watching Diamond slither away. He \n&gt; was kinda glad she had joined, or else Vamprah might have gotten \n&gt; away. A tasmanian devil wasn&#39;t really made for vent exploration.\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer picks up the datapad and looks at it, wondering who \n&gt; DarkFate was.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
