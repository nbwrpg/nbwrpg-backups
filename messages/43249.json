It was a fuzzor \nmost of his body was a Quetzalcoatlus (one type of Pterosaur), but \nsome parts of his beast mode body (like his back, chest and wings) \nhad metallic green-blue feathers. His neck was extremely long, his \nslender jaws were toothless and its head was topped by a long, bony \ncrest. \n\nThe bot started to screech due the light and for few seconds he cover \nhis eyes with his wings, but few minutes later he tried to escape and \nhe accidentally cut with his craws one cable and that did that the \nlights turn off in half ship... After he did that he ran away towards \na dark corridor with out stop to screech.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;        &quot;I think I&#39;m okay Starstomp.

In the new light he sees the survivor \nstanding \n&gt; nearby, eyes glowing.  &quot;I think I found a survivor.&quot;  He turns \naround very \n&gt; slowly.  &quot;Hi.  I&#39;m Aerotaur.
