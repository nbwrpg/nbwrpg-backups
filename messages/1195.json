If her base is outside, Dracona couldn&#39;t have gotten to it because\nthe\n&gt; doors were jammed. She also had autoguns firing at her at the time, so\ntrying\n&gt; to get the door open would be very costly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Double your manufacturer&#39;s warranty on all computers,\n&gt; home appliances, and electronics AND win up to $500\n&gt; towards your purchase!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3749/10/_/_/_/958019678/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
