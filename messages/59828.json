A few megacycles later, his alarm went off, and he grundgingly crawled out of his hammock.  He slowly made his way to the mess hall to find a cup of energon.  He noticed it was exceedingly quiet.  That was due to the fact that he was oblivious to everyone else until he had at least one glass of refined energon.\n\nshadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@...&gt; wrote:\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She slept soundly as she was placed in her quarters.
