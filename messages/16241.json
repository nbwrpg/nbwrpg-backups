I&#39;ve just read \nabout 150 messages, but it&#39;s okay becuase most of them aren&#39;t about \nme.(*sob* nobody loves me...). And Iron Raptor, I don&#39;t mean to be \nrude or anything, but who gives you the right to make the scamatics \nfor my weapon? Too late now, I&#39;ll go with it, but just e-mail me next \ntime and I&#39;ll telly ou about what you want to know. I&#39;m also gonna \nscratch the post where Gotron went to Dark One&#39;s help. I wasn&#39;t \nreally following the battle, so I&#39;m going to get him to do stuff with \nStarscream.\n\nVulois\n\nVulois looked the two Vok up and down. Powerful, but they should be \nable to beat them. He put his arm around Child and stared at the \nvillains.\n\n&quot;This is my mountain, and will soon be a scared place of the Oracle! \nLeave now or feel our power withing!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix patted Ramulus on the back.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know. You were pretty goo up there. You came in when we \nneeded it. A few more trips and and you&#39;ll get the hang of it. And we \nmay need some more trips before this is done. Now what&#39;s this comp \nhave to say?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream/Gotron\n\nStarscream came out of his CR Chamber in the Alliance base. He \nthought about what he should do. He needing to know how his group was \ndoing. He had been thinking about Phobia&#39;s action on the ship, and he \nwanted to save everyone and was willing t give his life, so he&#39;s \nvaliant. That means he&#39;s probably not in with Megatron. He sent a \nmessage.\n\n&quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the Alliance base. How is everyone \ndoing? Did KitKat and Cave-In get their CR Chambers? And are we doing \nanything against Megatron?&quot;\n\nStarscream walked down the hall and entered the caf. He really had \nnothing to do until his group came to the Alliance, so he&#39;d go hang \nout. When he go their though, he saw a familiar face.\n\n&quot;Gotron!&quot;\n\n&quot;Starscream! What are you doing here?&quot;\n\n&quot;A little ambassador stuff. What about you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m Alliance, remember?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;\n\n&quot;Come. Have some energon with me.&quot;\n\nThe two sat down and started getting drunk.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon kissed Spears. He had never felt like this before. She almost \nmade him want to give up his real girl. Maybe he should put chips in \nall the fembots. He could be the player of the NBW!\n\n&quot;You mis-understand what were doing. We are only telling Ramulus that \nwe will mett him in a few days. We are not taking Striker with us. \nWhen we get back, there will be plenty of time to say good-bye.&quot; He \nkissed Spears&#39; again as Ignatius flew down.\n\n&quot;Now, if you hop on Ignatius we&#39;ll be ready to begin.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Bullet went to the guard position by Striker&#39;s cell. He \nthouht to himself that with him here and Blaze controlling the cell \nguns that the only way this person could get out is if they were an \nultimate strategist. Than again, Bullet is pretty stupid. \n\n\n"}}
