Like a meteor it \n&gt; screamed across the sky. The maximal protoform inside instinctivly \n&gt; tried to salvage the ship. With little sucsess it crashed into a \n&gt; pile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed through the \n&gt; protoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The \n&gt; protoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a translucent \n&gt; body that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at work, \n&gt; yet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever seen. \n&gt; Cryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a \n&gt; diagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, death \n&gt; inevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he broke it \n&gt; off leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed spark. on \n&gt; his robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, as were \n&gt; his fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made of the \n&gt; same. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the spark \n&gt; encased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so slighty \n&gt; pierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an voice of \n&gt; experience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many \n&gt; wars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron snarled, &quot;Slag \n&gt; it!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode. The sun shined through him \n&gt; like a plate of glass...like he wasn&#39;t even there only leaving a \n&gt; rainbow under him as his trail. &quot;Any maximal in rage please \n&gt; respond.&quot; He flew off blasting his thrusters as well trying to get \n&gt; as far away from the  murderous energon as he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
