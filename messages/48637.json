No one here is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; impartial.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s unfair because there&#39;s more to RP&#39;ing than\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting.  In fact one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the biggest complaints before the restart was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there were too many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pointless battles.  To make it all about\n&gt; fighting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and\n&gt; resubmit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your idea to the council, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest you send it to the council.
