She knew she was \nin danger, but from who and what and for what reasons, she didn&#39;t \nknow.\n\nShe needed help.  But who would help her? None that she knew of.  She \nhad to do something.  She looked at her pet.  &quot;Well, we have a \nchoice. We can stand our ground and get slagged, or get help.&quot;\nBut from whom would that help come from.  She slowly crawled out of \nthe log.  She held her pet in her mouth and sniffed the air.  She \ncouldn&#39;t smell anything that resembled Pred.  She started out again.\n\nShe scurried along the forest floor.  The sun was getting low in the \nsky, the air was heavy and she was running out of ideas.\nShe desided to start using her mouse skills. She followed her nose.  \nShe picked up the scent of something that struck a cord in her memory.\nIt was the scent of a maxiaml.  She knew that preds and Maximals were \nenemies, but she was willing to make an exception.  She just hoped \nthat they would.  She walked along following her nose.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Firestorm &quot; &lt;firestorm36@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ((ooc-talon,sagefirestorm is 100ft back on the ground with a shot \nat \n&gt; darkmouse at the moment,your curently talking to changeling))\n&gt; \n&gt; Changeling-Tell me this ratrap,if she through that dagger,who would \n&gt; have saved you,me,besides right now you are still in a very tight \n&gt; spot so i suggest backing down\n&gt; \n&gt; ::sagefirestorm turns the gun to focus upon ratrap,incase of any \n&gt; suddden movements he would be slag::\n&gt; \n&gt; Changeling-please dont make this anyworse\n&gt; \n&gt; ::he puts his hands into the chameleon head by his side which \nlocked \n&gt; on to his arm and snapped on,the 2 bots were armed and ready for \nany \n&gt; possible move,with a sword and a laser beam gun(the chamelons head) \n&gt; for changeling and a pulse launcher with sagefirestorm they clearly \n&gt; had the advantage all though they just wanted the rat to leave.::\n\n\n"}}
