A tall and beu=\r\ntiful thing, a worthy follower and companion. He watched as she tested her =\r\nweaponry, becoming familiar now with his new body. Now they were a force to=\r\n be reckoned with. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &quot;We return, but to a precarious world. WHat we =\r\ndo here will last to the future, our pasts. We must preserve this little wo=\r\nrld, or everything will be gone. The descendants of the Decepticns and the =\r\nAutobots quarrel mindlessly, make changes to this world for their own gain.=\r\n For the Decepticon EMpire to have a future, we must make safe it&#39;s past. B=\r\nut we must not be hasty, we should use these fools for all they are worth b=\r\nefore putting an end to them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nListening to him as she glanced at he=\r\nr weapons, then retracted them. Looking at him with those cold crimson opti=\r\ncs, her faceplate blank with no expression. \nShe was completely back! \n\n&quot;Hm=\r\nmm... indeed a delimma,&quot; she stated in her deep femme voice, pausing but a =\r\nmoment, &quot;But surely nothing we can&#39;t handle,&quot; as a wicked smirk crossed tho=\r\nse metallic lips. Well beyond into this future which had taken them into th=\r\neir past, she was an older Decepticon but felt out of place nonetheless. Th=\r\ne future of her comrades in arms and her beloved Leader lay in her&#39;s and Me=\r\ngatron X&#39;s hands. \n\nNodding one, &quot;Very well. Have you any ideas? Plans?&quot;\nSl=\r\nowly, those memories contained with the nucleus of the spark seeped into he=\r\nr new meta-processor. Reformating those memories into what was at what time=\r\n in her existance. All the way from her creation and Aide to the Defense Co=\r\nrps, coming to know Megatron as he rose to power from a gladiator to leader=\r\n of a new army... all the way til recently when she had been reformatted in=\r\nto a transorganic, escaped from Cybertron, came here and met up with Hydras=\r\n and his faction of Predacons. \nHydras. \nThose recent memories filtered in.=\r\n But the emotion that once supported their fancy for one another... was no =\r\nlonger there. Indeed she was right, the organic side of her did cause more =\r\nof a non-cybertron personality within her. Ever so glad she no longer had t=\r\no deal with that pathetic form any longer. \n\nHer optics remained upon Megat=\r\nron X. Pleased that she was at least back in the presense of a Decepticon. =\r\nOr so he claimed. \nNow the curiosity welled within her. She wanted to know =\r\nmore about this mech who stood before her, who retrieved her and brought he=\r\nr back to the land of moving parts. Ever so grateful for his assistance and=\r\n dedication. But she had learned long ago... that though one may possess th=\r\ne name of Megatron, does not mean he IS Megatron.\nShe will have to test him=\r\n. \n\n\n"}}
