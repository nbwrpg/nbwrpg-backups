Pain! Lights! Pain! Darkness! Pain!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These were the things that assaulted Rodimus as he somehow moved down a\n&gt;&gt; tunnel that seemed to be composed of stone and heat and flames! He opened\n&gt;&gt; his eyes, not even having been aware of closing them and looked around. \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; could barely make out the reddish sheen that the faintly glowing magma\n&gt;&gt; left along the walls and ceiling. The heat was barely tolerable and \n&gt;&gt; almost\n&gt;&gt; unbearable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He looked down at his hands and shuddered as he saw only the blackness of\n&gt;&gt; Dark Rodimus, it took him a full moment that his armor was black, not\n&gt;&gt; because of evil, but because it was so badly scorched and burnt that all\n&gt;&gt; the other colors had been lost.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He smiled for a moment, feeling a curious sense of freedom. He felt free\n&gt;&gt; of the darkness that had overwhelmed him, the fear and guilt he had lived\n&gt;&gt; with for so many months. He felt new and alive! He felt a sense of\n&gt;&gt; giddiness as he flexed his fingers and he began to laugh  . . .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Two luminous eyes appeared out of the darkness and blinked, &quot;Yesss, you\n&gt;&gt; lie still now.&quot; a voice hissed from nearby. &quot;We will get you back to the\n&gt;&gt; machine, yess we will.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus&#39; laughter was cut short as he realized that he was being carried\n&gt;&gt; by something, something large and misshapen, yet it moved amazingly \n&gt;&gt; quick!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was then that Rodimus heard a strange piercing scream from somewhere \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; the darkness. It took him a moment to realize that it was he that was the\n&gt;&gt; one screaming as he saw and felt large all around him!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He felt a sting on his shoulder, and for a second he was surprised that \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; could feel such a tiny sensation and then his world went dark.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG or TBC)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
