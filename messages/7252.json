I could get to like this place after all.&quot;\n\nTheres a sudden explosion back at the Ark.&quot;What the underworld was \nthat?&quot; He starts to run back towards the Autobot ship&quot;Lunarpine to \nArk, what happened?&quot; Taking a quick look back he calls back to Shadow \nWing, &quot;Get airborn, I need to know the situation, if you see trouble \nstay back, Wait for backup.&quot;\n\nHis instincts kicked in, immediately he bared his fangs anticipating \ndanger.

He \n&gt; &gt; prefered to be fighting, hunting, pushing himself, and his \nopponent \n&gt; &gt; to thier fullest like he did with Shadow Wing. He also knew that \nhe \n&gt; &gt; had a problem submitting to rage. It nearly cost him a friend, \nand \n&gt; &gt; later on his eyesight. His anger nealy got him into a fight with \n&gt; &gt; Ripper back at the Ark. It fealt like a battle was taking place \n&gt; &gt; inside of him between the wolf and the bot, he didn&#39;t know which \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; winning, but he knew it had to stop. There were two possible \n&gt; endings, \n&gt; &gt; confront it or be deleated by it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She transformed into bot mode and wrapped her arms around \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; neck.

And she wasn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; afraid \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to admit that to herself any more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I understand and what you said made sence.  I should be more \n&gt; &gt; careful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in battle and not try to kill an entire army by myself. \nBesides, \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got most of the moves from you anyway.
