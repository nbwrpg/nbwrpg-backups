At \n&gt; most, SS could get on him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor&#39;s shots missed both Burrock and Tyrael, but blew a few \n&gt; nearby trees to splints. The stinger fired by Waspinator, however, \nwas \n&gt; straight on target. Burrock was thrown back a dozen meters, making \nhim \n&gt; lose his grip over Inferno. He splashed in the water, but before \n&gt; anyone could track him up, he burrowed in the muddy pond&#39;s bottom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead tried to aim at Shadow Star. He fired many small \nexplosives, \n&gt; doing not much damage individually, but devastating in group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warhead: Cowardly foe! Do you think that you could be superior to \n&gt; Milord Megatron? Diplomacy will not prevent your death at my gun!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the mention of ruling the universe made by his lieutenant, \nTyrael \n&gt; frowned. He was going to have a long strategic chat, but that would \n&gt; wait. Megatron was out now, and the true fight would start.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: I see you have come Megatron. Now come. You will learn why \n&gt; they call me the Blue Firestorm!\n&gt; \n&gt; He showered his enemy with a rain of light bolts, no bigger than \n&gt; needles.\n\n\n"}}
