With a thumbs up from Night Shift, the CR Chambers are made ready to accept new patients.\n\nAs Quickstride and Night Shift finish thier work they can see the\ninert forms of Windlord and Nightlight in two of the recharge\nchambers, the chambers are set for a slow heal. So far their lights\nare showing green and their vital signs appear to be strengthening.\n\nAirhammer and Noctorro glanced at each other as it seemed that\nQuickstride and Night Shift were ignoring them, and there are few\npeople who could ignore a Maximal of Noctorro&#39;s size.\n\n&quot;Answer me!&quot; Noctorro said as his hands flexed slightly, and his\nhorned head turned to look directly at Quickstride and then Night\nShift, &quot;What&#39;s happening with Rodimus?&quot; It was obvious that Noctorro&#39;s\nquick tempor starting to get the best of him, and for some reason he\nexpected Rodimus to be in here.\n\nAirhammer tried to lay a calming hand on his fuzor brother, but\nNoctorro shook it off.\n\n\n\n&gt; &quot;If he does that there&#39;s no telln&#39; if he&#39;ll survive such a proceedure. Lord Elder, tell him he can&#39;t do that! That&#39;s like the ultimate saccrifice and there&#39;s a great chance he&#39;ll die from it!&quot;\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t we let the medical staff decide if Rodimus requires a spark\ninfusion of some sort.&quot; Elder said, his voice over the radio calm and\nreasoning. &quot;I am sure that they are working on him now to the best of\ntheir abilities.&quot;\n\nEven as Elder was talking the doors to the bridge slid open and he\nstepped onto the bridge followed by a much more calm Cheetor. &quot;Hey Rat\nTrap.&quot; Cheetor said as he stepped in and looked around, &quot;Tuscon Prime\nready to come aboard?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile the computer continued to blink at Rat Trap, asking him if\nhe wanted to take manual control as the computer continued to try and\ntarget lock Perceptor.\n\n(OOC: Sorry if i overlooked it, but it seemed as if Rat Trap said they\nwere good, but made no actually attempt to shut the weaponry down?)\n\nIn the medical chamber . . .\n\n&gt; Kup watched sadly the medic room and said to silverbolt &quot;I guess that i&#39;ll\n&gt; remain here to help&quot;\n\nSilverbolt tugged slightly on Kup&#39;s arm, &quot;Kup, we are warriors not\nDoctors.&quot; he said, somehow making that sound noble. He smiled at Kup,\n&quot;Niether one of us have the medical training to help here.&quot; He pointed\nto the observation room. &quot;We can watch from there, but at least we\nwon&#39;t be getting in the way, and if they need us, we are right there.&quot;\n\nAs Silverbolt talked Bump and Santon began to scan Rodimus,\npositioning him on the bed. Legacy stood off to one side as he watched\nthe computer, analyzing the readouts.\n\n*   *   *   *\n\n&quot;Interesting.&quot; Legacy said as he looked dispassionately at the screen,\npointedly ignoreing Kup and Silverbolt at the moment in favor of the\nmedical proceedure that would soon begin.\n\n&quot;What?&quot; Santon said shortly as he was placing his tools in position\nfor the upcoming proceedure.\n\n&quot;It would seem that the tendrils have penatrated into nearly every\nsystem Rodimus has.&quot; Legacy said as he turned to look at Rodimus, &quot;but\nthey seem to be disintergrating.&quot;\n\nSanton looked at his scanner, &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, &quot;We cannot place him\nin a recharge chamber yet, since we don&#39;t know what affect that could\nhave on these things.&quot; Bump said, sounding disgusted by the tendrils,\n&quot;But I think we can start cutting them away.&quot;\n\nSanton nodded, &quot;Then let&#39;s get started - carefully.&quot; he said,\nemphasizing that last word, &quot;We don&#39;t know what these things can still\ndo.&quot;\n\nLegacy nodded as they all began to carefully cut away the metallic\nwrapping that enveloped Rodimus, working slowly and carefully.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
