Attack, and destroy the enemy forces.  Beat up the \nMaximals if it comes to that&gt; he chuckled, bringing up his targeting \ncomputer.  Firing one missile at Ominous Prime, one missile at Ra, and twenty \nrapid lasers at Shuko, the rapid lasers sending Shuko down to the ground more \nfrom surprise then the strength of the lasers.\n\n"}}
