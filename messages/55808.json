Let me\nshow you how to do this great, okay?\n\nHe squatted his large shape near the ground and advanced slowly\nthrough the bushed. There was a drones mere meters away. He moved\nslowly, silently, until he was just under the drone, on the other side\nof a shrub. Then, he jumped. Quick as a bullet, he leapt just over the\ndrones and brought all his weight down on it.\n\nBlackfang: I know you can do just as good. It might take time, but I\nknow you can do it!

She went running \n&gt; wildly around some of the trees, smelling the drones.  She saw one \n&gt; and went running up to it. It sped off through the trees and found \n&gt; another hiding spot.  She stopped and thought about what happened. \n&gt; She tried to sneek up on a drone. She was about to pounce on one, \n&gt; then it senced her and flew off.
