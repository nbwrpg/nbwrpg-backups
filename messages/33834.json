It doesn&#39;t even have 30. \nDon&#39;t spread \n&gt; propaganda, unless it&#39;s FOR me.\n&gt;      IR, I think the shots fired at Iron Raptor were just like a\nmissile from \n&gt; Firestarter, who&#39;s in a space fighter form, as well as a dozen or so\nrapid \n&gt; laser blasts from him later on.  There was more, but I believe Prowl\nblocked \n&gt; &#39;em for you most of the time.\n&gt;      Also, Airly, don&#39;t know if you know this, Dark One and the\nOblitercons \n&gt; ARE on the Alliance&#39;s side, and I think your Dragonfly character is\none of \n&gt; the Preds allied with the Alliance, right?)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Protectobots/The Oblitercons/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark\nClaw/Nemesis\n&gt;\nEnforcer/Scattershot/Imprisoner/Predator/Choran/Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/\n&gt; Double Punch/Manterror/Injector/Vehement/Sun\nCrusher/Reflector/Smokescreen/   \n&gt;   Serpentor:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf looked to his brethren and called loudly.  &quot;The retreat\nis at \n&gt; hand, form my brothers, so we have the strength to leave swiftly!&quot; \nHe \n&gt; slashed his sword as the missile was close enough, slicing it\nneatly, the \n&gt; explosion only lightly burning the blade and showering Demon Wulf\nwith \n&gt; shrapnel.\n&gt; \n&gt; He grunted in amusement as mech-fluid leaked down his face, neck,\nand chest.  \n&gt; He raised his sword, the burnt blade launching off as a missile for\nthe \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ten rapid optic blasts launched out from his optics towards Kali as\nhe drew \n&gt; close to his brethren quickly.  &quot;Coward?  I am the exact opposite.&quot;\nhe \n&gt; laughed, Cybertronian mind games.  He would not lose his temper so\neasily.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper had a hand gripping his face.  Well, the correct\nwording would \n&gt; be where a large portion of his face had been.  The animal flesh\ncovering his \n&gt; robot frame had been ripped off and part of the metal plating torn. \nA \n&gt; blood-like liquid went down his face in a large portion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cybe...rtronian scum...&quot; he raised his left arm, the palm open.  A\nblue orb \n&gt; of energy with the effect of an EMP blast shot out from his palm\ndown towards \n&gt; Demise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper headed for his brethren.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw avoided the mega blaster blast from Shivah, the Vok being\ncould \n&gt; feel the heat from the near blast.  His frame rocked as another\nblast struck \n&gt; him, but he kept on, and in a blinding flash, Dark Wolf, the junior\nexec. \n&gt; gestalt on the planet, being twenty-five feet in height, landed on\nthe ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was laughing the infamous &quot;laugh&quot; of a hyena.  He didn&#39;t stand\nidle for \n&gt; long, bringing up both of his arms in a defensive stance as he began\nto walk \n&gt; backwards quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One rolled over on the ground, firing off three blasts from his\nrifle as \n&gt; he rolled, none aimed so they all missed Dragonfly by several\nyards.  He got \n&gt; to Pyro and hoisted him up on his rifle as a shield and began minor\nrepairs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Breakdown, cover me!  I&#39;ll try to get this rustbucket back online!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Breakdown nodded to Dark One, and fired off five rapid optic blasts\nat \n&gt; Dragonfly&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pyro was the least damage of the three remaining unconsciouss\nOblitercons.  \n&gt; The other two (Scavenger, Hiss) would need a long nap in the CR\nchamber \n&gt; before they were ready to fight again.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; First Aid was busy making quick patch and weld repairs on Hot Spot\nto get him \n&gt; back up again, and the robot gave Blades a quick glance, those two\nbeing the \n&gt; only Protectobots up and at it at the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades avoided a missile barely, the shock wave of its passing\nshaking him \n&gt; violently.  He flied straight nonetheless, and launched of twenty \n&gt; highly-explosive 30mm rounds at Abominous&#39; left arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer twitched.  With a few violent spasms and a scream\nof pain, \n&gt; he was back on his feet, his chest heaving in anger.  His boosters\nin his \n&gt; feet lifted him off into the air and he flew towards a certain\nsnake-bot who \n&gt; wasn&#39;t suspecting anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot looked down at Dragonfly.  &quot;Didn&#39;t I say no one messes\nwith the \n&gt; Alliance?  Yet you&#39;re still shooting...odd.&quot; he raised his rifle,\nfiring ten \n&gt; armor-piercing rounds at Dragonfly&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner felt his frame shake as missiles ripped into him.  &quot;Me\nthinks it \n&gt; time to leave.&quot; he said, his turrets twisting, two missiles shooting\nat \n&gt; Endbringer, two more heading for the Cybertronian Fire, splitting\naway from \n&gt; each other, making it harder to hit them, both missiles being a\ndozen yards \n&gt; apart.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Predator saw quite a bit of explosive firepower heading his way.  He\nraised \n&gt; his missile launcher, firing off two missiles that prematurely\nexploded.  \n&gt; That took care of the incoming missiles, but there were still a\ncouple of \n&gt; charges and plasma blasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had squandered most of his time and jumped, three plasma blasts\ntearing \n&gt; into his right shoulder.  The explosions from the charges added onto\nhis jump \n&gt; and he painfully landed on his damaged shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran jumped out of the way of Charon&#39;s missiles, the explosions\nrocking his \n&gt; body, most shrapnel missing him.  He twisted around, several laser\nblasts \n&gt; beating on him and leaving large dents all over his torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now you&#39;re going to die...&quot; he raised his rifle, wondering if there\nwas a \n&gt; bounty on any of these people, and fired off twenty-five rapid laser\nblasts \n&gt; in an arc.  Five at Charon, five at Deepfear, five at Darkfate, and\nten at \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Still in momentum, Shockwave moves out of the way of two of the\ncharges, the \n&gt; third exploding against his arm and digging a deep gash into his\nright arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his left arm, the laser cannon that was in the place of\nhis left \n&gt; hand and forearm fired off three bolts of energy at Incarcinator.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter did a basic barrel roll and avoided a spurt of autogun\nfire from \n&gt; the Element.  He armed his weapons and a plan formed in his mind\nafter seeing \n&gt; how most of the attacks on the Cybertronian Fire had been\nintercepted.\n&gt; \n&gt; He flew towards the Cybertronian Fire, most autogun fire simply\nbouncing off \n&gt; his metallic frame, others digging in but not hitting anything\nvital.\n&gt; \n&gt; Being five yards away from the shield of the CF, Firestarter kept\nhis engines \n&gt; ready to go full power.  He didn&#39;t want a missile beating him into\nthe \n&gt; shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; He armed his tubes, firing off two missiles at the CF from only\nfifteen feet \n&gt; away.  He didn&#39;t think they would be intercepted very easy.  He\npeeled off, \n&gt; not wanting to have his fuselage be struck with burning shrapnel.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron avoided the fusion blast, thanks to him never stopping his\nflight, \n&gt; from some Maximal but didn&#39;t have time to retaliate as he raised the\nshield \n&gt; still attached to his left forearm to block Dollon and Drillbit&#39;s \n&gt; concentrated attack.  He was knocked back in the air a few feet, and\nhis \n&gt; shield was  not doing all that great.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Firestarter!  Get over here you clunker!&quot; he yelled, raising his\nlaser rifle \n&gt; and firing it three times, two blasts heading for Drillbit and a\nsingle blast \n&gt; heading for Dollon.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; The outline had disappeared, but Double Punch would regain it\nquickly, much \n&gt; faster.  He could hide.  He could run.  But still, Double Punch\nwasn&#39;t out of \n&gt; it.  He watched Beeline fire twenty-five optic blasts, only managing\nto take \n&gt; out three missiles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch couldn&#39;t see his assailant but kept his optics in the\ngeneral \n&gt; vicinity of where the robot had been.  He raised his left pincher,\nfiring off \n&gt; two missiles at Zardus.  With the other pincher he launched off\nanother two \n&gt; missiles, these seeking.\n&gt; \n&gt; One travelled towards Killfest, the other headed for Darkfate.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector managed to avoid Alecto&#39;s shots by a few inches and raised\nboth \n&gt; arms, firing two missiles from each.  Two at Alecto, the others\ntowards the \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; The last two he had fired were fired at different angles and were\nheading for \n&gt; opposite ends of the Maximal craft, making it harder for them to be \n&gt; intercepted.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror did not have Injector&#39;s luck.  He flew hard and fast,\ntwenty-five \n&gt; total laser blasts hitting his legs and ripping them apart pretty\nbad, \n&gt; mech-fluid leaking like a river.  He wasn&#39;t going to land, he knew\nit would \n&gt; hurt like the Pit.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised both arms, three ion disks launched from the left arm. \nTwo at \n&gt; Manthys, the other at Atilla.  The other arm fired off three ion\ndisks as \n&gt; well, two at the CF and the other at Mantle.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen was about to pull the trigger when something large\nstruck him \n&gt; from behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement&#39;s boosters were still active and as he saw a fusion blast\nheading \n&gt; for him he gave a sudden boost of power to them and avoided the\nblast, in the \n&gt; process dodging all the rapid laser fire and EMP blasts.  One\nmissile heading \n&gt; for him was blown apart by Beeline the cyberbee.  The other struck\nVehement \n&gt; in his unwounded side and ripped a large gash in a damaged area.\n&gt; \n&gt; He clenched his jaw tightly until he heard a small cracking sound\nand let the \n&gt; tension loose.  He growled slightly, raising both arms and launching\noff two \n&gt; missiles from his left arm.  They spread out, one heading for Hot\nRod, the \n&gt; other heading for the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his other arm, an invisible sonic burst shooting out\ntowards \n&gt; Killfest&#39;s legs.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector felt flames cover his body.  Fire did little against his\nframe, \n&gt; damage wise.  But it hurt like hell.  Reflector flew out of the\nflames, \n&gt; firing off a total of three missiles and three laser blasts and\nletting out a \n&gt; yell of anger mixed with pain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two missiles headed for Element&#39;s (gestalt) torso.  The other headed\nfor \n&gt; Rixer.  The three laser blasts headed for Luzbel&#39;s torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher had tackled Smokescreen to the ground, in the process\nknocking \n&gt; the heavy laser rifle to the ground, which then fired a single time \n&gt; harmlessly into the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Brotherhood robot rolled along with Smokescreen.  He had a few\nfeet on \n&gt; him and had him pinned and unarmed.  He began to punch Smokescreen\nin the \n&gt; face repeatedly, snickering at the stupidity of the Warrior of\nLight.  &quot;No \n&gt; heathen will kill the Archbishop on my watch, heathen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot was hit from behind and was flying through the air\nuncontrolably, \n&gt; heading for the CF&#39;s shields.\n\n\n"}}
