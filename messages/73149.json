Intent on literally landing ON his shield, balanced o=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; edge of it with her hyper-agility to then try and blast his upper=\r\n torso over\n&gt; &gt; with her energon draining webbing!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blasted bug!&quot; KILL=\r\nER PUNCH said as he saw BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s leap onto\n&gt; his shield, a move whic=\r\nh caught him almost completely by surprise!\n&gt; With a quick shake of his shi=\r\neld he attempted to dislodge her, a look\n&gt; of revultion moving across his f=\r\naceplate as he did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; He tried to spin as he saw her firing her webbi=\r\nng. However the very\n&gt; armor that protected him from blows also made it dif=\r\nficult to move as\n&gt; fast as he needed to and a few pieces of her webbing ca=\r\nught hold of\n&gt; him for a moment and stuck!\n&gt; \n&gt; With a quick move he cut it=\r\n away, but some damage had already been\n&gt; done as some of his energies had =\r\nbeen drained away!\n&gt; \n&gt; KILLER PUNCH looked over at BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;Is that=\r\n all you have?&quot; He\n&gt; said, his chuckle sounded a bit tired as he spoke. &quot;Co=\r\nme on, I can do\n&gt; this all day!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a clumsy swing KILLER PUNCH slas=\r\nhed out at BLACKARACHNIA with his weapon!\n&gt; \n&gt; Could KILLER PUNCH really be=\r\n as tired as he looked, especially with\n&gt; BLACKARACHNIA having scored on hi=\r\nm with her energy draining webbing\n&gt; for a moment, or was this a feint to c=\r\nause her to lower her guard?\n&gt; \n&gt; KILLER PUNCH was well known to be trickey=\r\n.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBut BLACKARACHNIA was trickier.  WASPINATOR had been carrying=\r\n a large load of supplies for the group which had been dropped when he had =\r\nbeen set upon by KILLER PUCNH.\n\nShe SMIRKED then, landing in a graceful som=\r\nmersault from the clusmy swing, &quot;Oh?&quot;  Her spinnerettes going up, her then =\r\nfiring over her machine guns over at the munitions, energon cubes, and othe=\r\nr spare things WASPINATOR had been carrying, moving over to detonate them!\n=\r\n\nWhile KILLER PUNCH would be nowhere near the blast radius to be hit by the=\r\n explosion in all likelihood, an energon fueled fire and consumables would =\r\nbe no doubt hopefully quite distracting over for him and give the femme tim=\r\ne to flee, abandoning WASINATOR to his fate!\n\nAssuming that the explosive f=\r\nire and the resulting blaze in the jungle had her opponent distracted, she =\r\nwould switch to BEAST MODE To scuttle away in the darkness!\n\n\n"}}
