He stepped in\nwith a quick gracefull leap.\nLunarpine thought about the three questions that must go through\nevery transformers CPU when they&#39;re reformatted: What have I become?\nWhy are we here?and most of all Will I change when the other two\nquestions are answered?\n\nHe looked at Shadowwing at the controls, he saw how natural it\nappeared, and with the word &quot;MAXIMIZE&quot; he transformed and took a seat\nat her left.\nSomething about the panel brought back memories, he remembered a\nsimilar situation with him at navigation.The memory was vague, but it\nwas there. He looked back at Shadowwing and said &quot;well this is\nit.Lets fly.&quot;\n\nWith one last glance outside Lunarpine couldn&#39;t help thinking &quot;Hope\nI&#39;m ready for the Maximals again: But are the Maximals ready for me.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
