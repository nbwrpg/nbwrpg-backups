The projectiles\nfrom the machine guns seemed to follow him. The eaglebots body, battered and\nbeaten on throughout the battle was denting and beginning to crack. He\nlanded behind a sand dune hopeing that the cover would be enough to protect\nhim. He stuck his head and left arm up fireing a missle towards Drillbit. At\nthis point he was trying to save some amunition since there were logically\nmore than one Predacon left to battle against.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 9:05 PM\nSubject: Re: Kill the Trainers\n\n\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt;\n&gt; He jumps to the side, the last three energy shots hitting his left leg.\n&gt; He gets to a kneeling position and take aim at Ignatius.
