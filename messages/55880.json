Not was not the time and place \nto \n&gt; fight over hurt pride. She looked to Blackstorm.  &quot;Learn well the \n&gt; lessons learned. Oh, and yes, we may be on the same side. We may \nhave \n&gt; the same purpose and goal as Predacons. But, as true to your \n&gt; programming, pick your friends carefully. Keep your friends close \nbut \n&gt; keep your enimies closer.&quot;  She turned and walked out, but not \nbefore \n&gt; glaring at Maxima. This one would be a problem. For one, she \nassumed \n&gt; a command without reguard for the purpose of others. For one to be \nan \n&gt; effective leaer, one had to use the strong points of all below \nthem \n&gt; to thier advantage. This one however, was more selfcentered. She \n&gt; would not live long enough to be of consiquence to her. She walked \nto \n&gt; the entrance of the base and transformed into wolf mode. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 4/24/03 1:17:01 AM Central Daylight Time, \n&gt; &gt; raccoon7679@y... writes:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With lightening fast reflexes, she turned, jumped the ring \nroped \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one leap, and ran towards Maxima. &quot;YOU! You do not raise your \n&gt; voice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me young one. I do not care who you think you are. You will \n&gt; show \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the proper respect. I am the trainer here. You are the \n&gt; interloper. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you want to play games, then leave and do your programming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; elsewhere.&quot; she said, growling. Her optics red with fury, and \nthe \n&gt; fur \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the back of her neck standing up. &quot;You will learn your \nplace \n&gt; young \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one. In the pack, there is an order. And in that order, I am \nyour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supior officer.&quot;  She took a step back to recompose herself. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a more steady and lightly softer tone. &quot;You, young one are \n&gt; clever, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smart and well knowledged. But you have yet to really learn \nhow \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; use this talent to it&#39;s fullest potential. When you have, then \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shall be leader. Untill then, I am still higher ranked. You \nwill \n&gt; show \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rank respect if not the bot. Much like Hydras. He has my \n&gt; loyalty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and respect. And I shall show that to all who are around me. \nYou \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do well to do the same.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She turned and went back to the ring. Her arm still holding \nher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Maxima&#39;s optics glowed. But she would not scrap the bot who just \n&gt; seriously \n&gt; &gt; insulted her. &quot;It is you who have crossed the line. Hydras \ndeserves \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; loyalty for many reasons. YOU however,&quot; her voice still eriely \ncalm \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; obviously there was hint that she did not appreciate what KitKat \n&gt; just did, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;underestimate me. I am by NO means young. I would be surprized \n&gt; that you \n&gt; &gt; would be older than I. Rodimus himself is much younger than I. \n&gt; #2... \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor has placed ME in charge of Blackstorm. I do believe \nthat \n&gt; you have \n&gt; &gt; over stepped your bounds. If I am correct, I don&#39;t recall Hydras \n&gt; giving you a \n&gt; &gt; superior ranking let alone charge. Flicker has charge of this \n&gt; place. As does \n&gt; &gt; Perceptor. Now... if you will so kindly step aside & allow me \n&gt; finish \n&gt; &gt; Blackstorm&#39;s programming.&quot; Her crimson optics glared at Kitkat. \nShe \n&gt; knew at \n&gt; &gt; the beginning that this one would be a problem. She was right. \nSo \n&gt; many \n&gt; &gt; wanting so much. Sounded far too familiar. Sounded much like \n&gt; Starscream.\n\n\n"}}
