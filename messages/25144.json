Where&#39;s the new bot?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;DevilDuer turns around, waiting for Bigfish to get here. \n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Griplash surfaces above the water, \n&gt;swimming toward the steaming rubble that used to be a shore. \n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To missiles exploded against Recklessa&#39;s \n&gt;side, sending her spinning off sideways and dropping Astral into the water. \n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &quot;Understood,&quot; Slayer says and turns, \n&gt;flying at full speed toward Iguanus&#39; signal. \n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Fenox flies over the shots, one of them \n&gt;hitting her in the leg and nearly disabling it. She growls, firing her \n&gt;rifle down at Prebon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Starlight lands on \n&gt;the ground, pulling out her charge launcher and firing at Prebon. \n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Havoc flies out of the safety of the \n&gt;shields of the Alliance base, pursuing Slayer and firing rapidly at the \n&gt;bot.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Big fish&quot; wrote: &gt; :::Bigfish::: &gt; Im fine. \n&gt;::bigfish continuse to swim forward with devil duer.::\n&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
