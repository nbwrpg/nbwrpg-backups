We have managed to round \n&gt;&gt; everyone up, but we&#39;re still trying to apprehend Darkhawk. Night Shift is \n&gt;&gt; attempting that now. Legacy, while I have your attention, I need to \n&gt;&gt; confirm some intel with you, regarding an ancient legend about the \n&gt;&gt; mythical Hydra. From what I&#39;ve read, a hydra can not be killed by \n&gt;&gt; decapitation, which only promotes the growth of multiple heads at one \n&gt;&gt; time. Yet, in this legend, it gives the clue on how to slay the beast. \n&gt;&gt; Direct fire is the only way to slay a hydra. Can this knowledge be \n&gt;&gt; adapted and utilized as a weapon against Hydras? Can Rodimus and I use \n&gt;&gt; the powers within us to subdue him as this legend fortells? I wish to \n&gt;&gt; confirm this before I proceede.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy paused for a moment in an obvious attempt to recall the\n&gt; requested information. &quot;You are referencing a human mythological\n&gt; narrative.&quot; Legacy stated. &quot;Human datum is not my forte, however I\n&gt; have been programed with much of their lore.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy floated clearly into view near the Black Fortress as he\n&gt; continued his communication with Tuscon, &quot;The one fable recounts a\n&gt; greek hero identified as Hercules who was able to slay the\n&gt; mythological beast by cutting off each cranial appendage and then\n&gt; burning the stump before a new set would grow. An interesting addition\n&gt; to that is that one appendage - or head was said to be immortal or\n&gt; unkillable, and had to be placed under a rock.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;As to whether this is applicable to Hydras?&quot; Legacy paused for a\n&gt; moment and then continued, &quot;Insufficient data, however all presumptive\n&gt; analysis would seem to indicate that it would be largely ineffective.\n&gt; Niether Galvatron nor Megatron, the two sparks that make up Hydras,\n&gt; have evinced any specific or unusual weakness towards matix energies.\n&gt; Despite outward appearance Hydras is still generally Cybertronian in\n&gt; make up, his outward appearance is only an adaptation to his\n&gt; surroundings. Also he does not appear to have any of the specific\n&gt; vulnerablities or benefits of being a mythological hydra, save for the\n&gt; ones created by his transform circuits and innate weaponry and\n&gt; abilities.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy hovered over the ground for a moment as he observed the\n&gt; surrounding area, then with the grinding of gears he shifted into his\n&gt; alternate mode, that of a cybertronian tank, complete with a massive\n&gt; foward cannon and a dual turrent cannon as well. &quot;What gives me pause\n&gt; . . . &quot; Legacy said as he he landed on the ground, the force of his\n&gt; landing cracking the ground beneath him slightly. &quot;. . . is that the\n&gt; civilization that created that myth on this planet will not exist for\n&gt; the greater part of 4 million years. How is it that you have come\n&gt; across such information?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he sent his question to Tuscon Legacy turned his attention to Rat\n&gt; Trap and Quickstride,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Outside, Rat Trap and Quickstride also get the transmission.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap, I read ya Legacy, Quickstride&#39;n I are on standby out \n&gt;&gt; here, just in case they need a little distraction and some backup.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps it is time for that diversion, as from all indication the\n&gt; entirety of Predacon forces are closing in on Tuscon and Rodimus&#39;\n&gt; position.&quot; Legacy said to Rat Trap and Quickstride as he oriented his\n&gt; cannon on the Black Fortress&#39; main entrance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Prepare yourselves!&quot; Legacy said both over the radio to the others as\n&gt; well as to those nearby. Meanwhile his fore cannon glowed for a moment\n&gt; looking like a spear of corruscating energy. Then it errupted and\n&gt; massive energies went hurtling at the Black Fortress, creating a\n&gt; searing path across the magma before striking home against the front\n&gt; door!\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Airly, it&#39;s up to you if Legacy is able to force open the fornt door.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
