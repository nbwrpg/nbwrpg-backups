Right now, I am preparing for Botcon, so I don&#39;t have time to\nread the messages.  Also, my dad reinstalled Netscape 2-3 times since I\nwrote in my character, so I&#39;ve lost almost all of the messages.  My dad\nis getting a bit freaked out when we log on and receive at LEAST 50\nmessages at a time.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has said what is going on,\nas I have to just drag them all to my folder before reading the\nmessages.\n\nI think we should have a message board instead of an e-mail system, just\nto make things easier.  Well, tell me what you think on Sunday.  I&#39;m\ngoing to Botcon for the weekend.  &#39;Later.\n\n\nAnolis\n\ncrow_lord@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:Okay i go away for 6 hours, when i get back i have to read 200\n&gt; mails. What is worng here. To many mails. Why can&#39;t all of you get a\n&gt; life. Maybee we should make a limit of mails sent in a day so peoe\n&gt; dont have to readd 1000 mails if they go away for a weekend. GET A\n&gt; LIFE.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
