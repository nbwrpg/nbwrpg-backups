She knelt down on one knee \nand put her hands up to her head. She had hit the tree head first and \nknocked herself out. Now she had a gash on the side of her head and \nwas feeling dizzy. She held her head, waiting for hte dizziness to go \naway so she could follow her predacon friends.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Berserk:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever this planet was, Berserk wasn&#39;t happy with it. It didn&#39;t \n&gt; suit his needs. He missed the buildings and life of Cybertron. The \n&gt; planet was organic, and it confused him. How could a robot survive \n&gt; here? He followed the edge of a forest, dirt on his heavy \nshoulders, \n&gt; knees and forearms. \n&gt; \n&gt; The clone growled at this. How as he going to get out of this?\n&gt; \n&gt; He froze. He stood by a tree, half of his body hidden as he saw a \n&gt; group of bots walking. They were Predacon. Inside he was surprised, \n&gt; but he wasn&#39;t much of an expressional bot. He bared his teeth some, \n&gt; studying them. He took a step forward. They had to be prisioners \nhere \n&gt; too. He needed to get to them, but he hesitated. He knew when other \n&gt; bots saw him, it was fear.\n\n\n"}}
