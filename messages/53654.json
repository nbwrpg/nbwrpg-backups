The shuttle looks something like a Bident but instead=\r\n of two \n&gt; pokers it has two lightning bolts.  It is a metallic silver/whit=\r\ne \n&gt; color.\n&gt;   \n&gt;      But enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique =\r\nspaceship \n&gt; were two individuals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over t=\r\nheir \n&gt; metallic though was more metallic but this is where the two \n&gt; indi=\r\nviduals looked different.  One was a shinny red metallic and the \n&gt; other w=\r\nas a shinny blue metallic.  So for now they shall be known as \n&gt; Red and Bl=\r\nue.  Red was studying a map of the world known as Earth.  \n&gt; Blue was sitti=\r\nng in the pilot&#39;s chair but instead of carefully \n&gt; planning the course he =\r\nhad his legs up on the controls and was \n&gt; twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n  &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red said as he turned and faced his \n&gt; comrade, &quot;What the =\r\nGrease Bolting are you doing!  Why aren&#39;t you \n&gt; planning our landing!  I d=\r\non&#39;t want to crash.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  Bl=\r\nue said as he let out a small \n&gt; chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with the=\r\n flow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;We need a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;YOU =\r\nNEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Poor Poor Blue, if only he l=\r\nisten to his brother.  But he \n&gt; decided to not listen to his brother and d=\r\necided to go with the \n&gt; flow.  Well now they are flowing on the mountains =\r\nof the Northern \n&gt; Continent where they crashed.  Their exact location of t=\r\nhe crash is \n&gt; (using the map on the events page) as far east of the Predac=\r\non base \n&gt; as possible and about an inch up.  It looks like these two bots =\r\nneed \n&gt; a rescue operation. (Hint:  I just making the rescue operation to s=\r\nee \n&gt; which groups are active and that is how I am going to decide who to \n=\r\n&gt; join to rescue me.)  (So Bots, move out.)\n\n\n"}}
