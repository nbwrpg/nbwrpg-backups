It was attraction...and love. But in a sense she knew what they were long before now, right around the time that she had patched his wound with moss. But the thought of his previous wounds brought her attention to his fresh ones, some in which she had helped create. The fact still bothered her but he had assured her that it was just a mistake, but it could have been a mistake that could have cost his life. The fact that he was now in Beast Mode comforted her, his repair system could begin on the major damage and ensure his complete recovery. So, now that the enemy had been defeated and they had won the day they were left alone again with their thoughts. But even now that their thought were left to roam where ever and not concentrate on battle they still had to get back to base, this was an unfortunate thought alone to Iron Raptor. She wanted to be with Prowl again, in his arms and safe in his spark.\nThey had not had the chance to be alone, a price that being in a war had to be paid. Despite what both of them felt and longed for, the cold but true facts.\nIron Raptor then turned to Prowl and nodded at his last suggestion, to return to base. Liono had called them, they must go.\nShe had heard his comment on reminding him not to piss her off but she was in no situation to smile or be marry about much, they were both damaged and...appart.\nA fact that she hated as much as she hoped Prowl did too, it almost felt...volnerable being from him.\nIron Raptor looked at the surrounding area one last time but then looked back at Prowl, not bothering to transform into her Beast Mode.\nShe then began to walk towards him, her back almost screaming from the wounds but she didn&#39;t really hear it, to busy thinking about that fact that they had not had much time alone and that the rage was slowly dying destructing her too much.*\n\n&quot; If we must.&quot;\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
