As much as she wanted him to \nstay with her, she knew he was needed at the ark. &quot;Love, I need you \nto go with the others to help rebuild the Ark.  Your the best driller \nand tunneler around. Surely they will need your strength and skill in \nthe rebuilding.&quot; She kissed him again and then turned, opened the \ndoor to her room, and motioned for him to go. &quot;HUrry up and get \nthere, get that ship build and hurry back to me.&quot;  she the let an \nevil grin creep across her face. &quot;I&quot;ll have a home coming suprize \nwaiting for you when you get back.&quot;  She smiled at him.\n\n\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe transformed into mouse mode and scurried along, trying to keep \nDestructor in her sight.  She had no clue why she was even going to \nthe ark.  She was a pred, they were maximals, sworn enemies. Why help \nthem?  Why not attack and kill them while they were down? She coudn&#39;t \nunderstand.  But, this was her last chance to be with a group, and \nshe needed the protection of a group as long as Megatron was around.  \nShe followed and would arrive to the ark soon enough. Then she would \ntalk to Destructor about having his logic circuits checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  The horsemen transformed to robot mode. Turned to see that their \nleader had \n&gt; not yet arrived. They pondered why Kit Kat would send so little \nforces. \n&gt; Megatron would not dare to attack now. Unless they where completely \ninsane. \n&gt; And their still was the missing death. What happened to him?\n&gt; \n&gt; Destructor:: It seemed as if Kit Kat would not allow Drill Bit to \ngo. So he \n&gt; looked to dark mouse...&quot;Let us be off. The more time we waste here \nthe more \n&gt; chances of our destruction grows.&quot; He tried not to show it but when \nKit kat \n&gt; walked off he was very dissapointed in her. She let her emotions \ncloud her \n&gt; judgment. He turned and flew out of the base not looking back. He \nwas hopeful \n&gt; that dark mouse would follow with out a problem. If not then she \nwould only \n&gt; get in the way anyway.\n\n\n"}}
