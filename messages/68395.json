A cecophony of thoughts and\nmemories flooded his consciousness as he watched, the name Megatron\nfloating amongst the wave. A constant litanty, part statement part\nquestion, &quot;Megatron, who is the true Megaton.&quot; \n\nIt was as if somthing in his programing was attempting to emerge.  It\nreminded him of how he felt when he first emerged here, and that drive\nto find Megatron, but more pronounced. When he heard from Hydras in the\nbegining he thought his duty was answered, and yet now perhaps there\nwas doubt. \n\nIt was as if there was something he was suppose to do or remember, but\nhe could not . . . yet!\n\nWith a shake of his head he cleared his thoughts as the image of\nMegatron faded. In frustration and a desire to cover his distraction he\ngrunted and spoke over his radio, &quot;Hydras, you had better if get out\nhere if you wish to resolve this as you had hoped!&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n--- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt; \n&gt; Dodging Trelos while hovering in vehicle mode was in no way easy.  He\n&gt; recieved signifigant scratches to his ventral heatshielding, but in a\n&gt; few minutes it would be repaired.  In the meantime he transformed and\n&gt; focused his attention to Myrmidon.  A small panel on his chest opened\n&gt; and a communication holo emitter.  He made contact with Megatron via\n&gt; internal radio, and the image of the large and powerful Megatron X\n&gt; stood before Myrmidon.  Body very different, but his head and faced\n&gt; almost unchanged, save for a youthful countance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;*Hmm?  WHo are these creatures?  They look like slag in a slag heap.\n&gt;  Ah, I see now, they cower under that Hydras, huh?  Hmpt!  Pitiful\n&gt; excuses for Decepticons.  They can&#39;t conquer Prehistory Earth, what\n&gt; would make them suitable to follow me?*&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know, they talk an awful lot.  Maybe you should give thema\n&gt; chance?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;*YOU give them a second chance.  I&#39;m dealing with more important\n&gt; matters!*&quot;\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
