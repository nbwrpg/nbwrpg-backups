I&#39;m thinking Van and Raven use the technology from their zoids \nto create the Liger Zero and the Berserk Fury, and give it to their \nkids.  Finally, something in which the Ultimate Xes are piloted by \nreal warriors, instead of a 10 year old barely out of dipers, and \nsome junk dealer, who only win because of the Organoid system.  Jamee \nwould have made a better star for that show (later on anyway), he was \nunstopable WITHOUT a system that makes all the decesions for you.  \nThe freaken&#39; Liger didn&#39;t NEED a pilot, Bit just got in the way, and \nit was the Liger&#39;s Organoid system that beat the Berserk Fury, not \nBit.  The kid had already proven he was better than Bit in a normal \nZoid.  But if it&#39;s Van and Raven&#39;s kids duking it out, you KNOW it&#39;s \nmore than the organoid system.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; No... it will not be silver Surfer.
