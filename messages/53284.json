I&#39;m sick\n&gt; &gt; and tired of this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question simply being shrugged off (unless I\n&gt; &gt; missed the post in which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; case I apologize)!  Now if you people simply can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; remember this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; let&#39;s review.  I left a while back.  I said that\n&gt; &gt; Cardhead could have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Flicker, and Winged Warrior could have Owlhawk.  I\n&gt; &gt; came back.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cardhead told me she couldn&#39;t remember where\n&gt; &gt; Flicker was, but hadn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; posted with him in a week so I could take over\n&gt; &gt; from whereever I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted too.  Winged Warrior said roughly the same\n&gt; &gt; thing about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk, except he failed to mention whether or\n&gt; &gt; not he had even used \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Owlhawk, and for that matter if Owlhawk had\n&gt; &gt; finished his training \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the Mech girl.
