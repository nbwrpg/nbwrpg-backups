It was a look of sligh=\r\nt annoyance and the fact that Uproar could have been treated long before hi=\r\ns symptoms got worse.  Yet he keeps an even demeanor.\n\n&quot; Legacy, i would ha=\r\nve wanted to know about this sooner...  Uproar&#39;s condition has grown worse =\r\nand so far he has not seen treatment when we obviously have the means to tr=\r\neat him..  Well, that&#39;s over now, but I want him treated now, and then you =\r\ncan do the same for me.  I want no delays and no excuses.  Do I make myself=\r\n clear?&quot;\n\nRattrap nods as he goes to join Windlord.\n\n&quot; Right on it boss.  Y=\r\nou can count on us.  By the way, be careful around Wings, he&#39;s kinda look&#39;n=\r\n like he&#39;s ready ta give someone the business.&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises his han=\r\nd.\n\n&quot; I got a question.  Legacy says he knows how ta cure Energon Dispersal=\r\n syndrome.  Howcome he hasn&#39;t helped Uproar yet and why hasn&#39;t anyone notic=\r\ned that ?  I mean he&#39;s one of us too, we should worry about him.&quot;\n\nNightshi=\r\nft nods in agreement.\n\n&quot; Yeah what he said, and what about Cheetor, Rhinox =\r\nand Optimus Primal?  We cant leave until we find them.&quot;\n\nLocal artist who s=\r\npecializes in illustration, using traditional and digital media.  \n\nI also =\r\nspecialize in hand made crafts.
