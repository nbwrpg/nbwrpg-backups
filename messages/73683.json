They were a little outside\n&gt; imme=\r\ndiate scanning range, and it would only be a deliberate effort to\n&gt; scan th=\r\ne location that would easily reveal their location.\n&gt; \n&gt; They were reasonab=\r\nly safe so long as the proper precautions were kept.\n&gt; \n&gt; RIPPERSNAPPER and=\r\n BLOT disappeared near to the cave, presumably they\n&gt; were digging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of=\r\nf to one side a human was kneeling in the brush, then a second,\n&gt; looking a=\r\nt the PREDACONS, but neither of them daring to move. Two\n&gt; males.\n&gt; \n&gt; They=\r\n gestured to each other and then made to back away, hoping to stay\n&gt; unnoti=\r\nced.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT stayed quiet as the TERRORCONS began to dig and sec=\r\nure the area. All of them over in their beast modes, using hand signals to =\r\ngesture to one another, and growls and quiet threats.  None of them, despit=\r\ne their bravado, wished to be anywhere in range of the attentions of the AR=\r\nK now as they continued to dig.\n\nAnd then DINOBOT saw the human.  Whisperin=\r\ng.. &quot;Insipid flesh creature..&quot;  His optics glowed over and then went to fir=\r\ne a blast of energy at the human&#39;s feet.  &quot;Remain quiet or the next one wil=\r\nl be through your head.  Understand me?&quot;\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; TARANULUS accepted the=\r\n report, at least a recording of it was taken.\n&gt; It is apparent that he was=\r\n otherwise engaged, perhaps dealing with\n&gt; ANTAGONY.\n&gt; \n&gt; And as far as BLA=\r\nCKARAKNIA&#39;S override codes, yes they all been taken\n&gt; from her by TARANULUS=\r\n, but she was more than skilled enough to learn\n&gt; new ones . . . or perhaps=\r\n have some secreted away somewhere that she\n&gt; could recover.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe=\r\n MAXIMALS would have changed the access codes years ago regardless.  But fo=\r\nr now..  Temptation gave in.  The ARK would be focused on other things.\n\nAn=\r\nd so BLACKARACHNIA went to stalk towards it, her stealth mode on full power=\r\n, trying to find a wya to sneak in.\n\n\n\n"}}
