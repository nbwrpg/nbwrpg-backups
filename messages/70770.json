He had many things he wanted to share with her, one of them being O=\r\nptimus Prime&#39;s legacy.  \n\n&quot; You&#39;re looking at the most legendary Autobot le=\r\nader of all time.  This is Optimus Prime, created and restorred by Alpha Tr=\r\nion vorns ago. Before he became the great leader that he was, he went by th=\r\ne name, of Orion Pax, a brave Autobot who didn&#39;t believe in giving up witho=\r\nut a fight.  One day, Orion Pax suffered greatly in battle, and was brought=\r\n  to Alpha trion where he became Optimus Prime.&quot; \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The=\r\nre are so many things I never got to ask you. One of them being, how does o=\r\nne find the perfect balance between trust and loyalty? And how does one fin=\r\nd peace in an atmosphere full of tension? But most of all Optimus, our path=\r\ns appear to be the same, our values, our courage, our strength and our fait=\r\nh in those around us. Are our origins alike? If so, is there a direction I =\r\nshould be going toward? One that will help me to guide the Autobots and Max=\r\nimals to finding the road toward peaceful existance? If anyone would know t=\r\nhese answers, you would.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He puts a tiny orb of his own spark into =\r\na container, and gives it as an offering to Optimus Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe body and form of Optimus Prime remained absolutely still, there\n&gt; was n=\r\no discernable movement from him, no spark of energy, no sign of\n&gt; recogniti=\r\non of any type. It could be that the Matrix energy that had\n&gt; been animate =\r\nbefore has been temporarily used up, or perhaps the\n&gt; situation now was not=\r\n sufficiently critical so as to call it into\n&gt; being. In either case Optimu=\r\ns prime looked, for all intents and\n&gt; purposes, as dead as any robot can ap=\r\npear and still be awaiting a\n&gt; rebirth in another few million years.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
