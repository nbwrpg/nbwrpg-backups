Both of them take a moment to observe the room, noting any defenses that are obvious and directed at them. However that moment is brief as Cyclonus quickly orients himself on Hydras. As the two step a few paces closer it is obvious to anyone who is paying attention to such things, that at the moment niether Cyclonus nor Scourge have any faction markings - no Predacon, Decepticon or Minion symbols. \n\nThe duo stopped before Hydras&#39; throne as Cyclonus began to speak, &quot;Greetings Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice and demeanor were calm and seemingly unaffected by the possible danger of this encounter as he continued. &quot;We have come because danger is soon coming to us, to all of us.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; optics narrow slightly as if examining Hydras for something, &quot;We have come to see if you are ready.&quot;\n\nEven as Cyclonus spoke, Scourge glanced at Perceptor and Darkhawk, casually acknowledging their presence, even as he casually dismissed them, as he stood protectively close to Cyclonus, he felt that things could get dangerous in a hury. \n\n&lt;TAG&gt;\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
