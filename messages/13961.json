Two bots, who had just \ntravelled from Cybertron step out, and begin DNA Scanning. The ships \nscanners find two acceptable matches. When Scanning the mountains, it \nfinds a Goat. When searching the plains, it comes across a Zebra. The \nbots are given there forms. They exit the ship.\n\n&quot;Ha ha! Finaly, Gotron has arrived!!!!!&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh shut up!&quot;\n\n&quot;Be quiet Zava. Now, where are you going?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m gonna go find Deemos and The Chosne Ones. All that destruction! \nThanks for the ride, Gotron. Maybe see you again someday.&quot;\n\nZava took off to find the Chosen Ones.\n\n&quot;Good, she&#39;s gone. Now to finish the job and join The Alliance!&quot;\n\nGotrn pulled out his rocket launcher and fired continually at his \nship. It blew up in a huge explosion of fire.\n\n&quot;No one is getting off this planet now!&quot;\n\nGotrn takes off heading for the Alliance base.\n\n\n"}}
