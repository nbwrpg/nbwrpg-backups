He \nopened the kit and took out a screwdriver, a wrench, and some small spare \nparts (screws, bolts, etc.)  He proceeds to open a storage compartment in his \nleft arm.  When it is open he finds he already has those things built in.  He \ntosses the ones from the tool kit over his shoulder.  He also finds a pair of \ngoggles that serve to both protect his optics and scan for tiny breaks in the \nconnection.  He looks at his right arm and finds a small soldering iron built \nin.  He stands up and walks back to the bridge.  He puts the goggles on and \ninspects the panel again.  He finds many minute breaks which he repairs \nquickly.  Might as well fix the parts before he gets power back up.\n\n    He begins tracing the connection back to the generator.  He finally finds \nthe break and repairs it.  As he does this the ship comes back to life.  His \njob done he looses focus and stares into space.\n\n::Aerotaur::\n    He hears a noise inside the ship and sees light inside the base.  He runs \nin after seeing Nightlight&#39;s wounds.  He goes down the hall to the med lab.  \nHe gently places Nightlight into the CR chamber he had brought from Perplex&#39;s \nship.  He then sits down to wait.\n\n"}}
