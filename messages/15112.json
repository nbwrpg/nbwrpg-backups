I&#39;e been reding your posts wrong\n&gt; sometimes. My fault. Sorry.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream looked around. A sorry bunch of Predacons lost in the\n&gt; wilderness. He looked at everyone. Drilbit, Atma, Pseudo, Phobia,\n&gt; himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All right, 5 of us. We each vote. Can&#39;t vote for yourselves. I gotta\n&gt; put my vote towards Phobia. He saved our butts back at the cave, and\n&gt; he was willing to sacrifice himself to save us all. I think he&#39;d have\n&gt; the courage and guts to make a leader.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
