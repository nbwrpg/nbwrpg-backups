This was \nnot a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bustling place like R=\r\nelay, a fortress like Olympus or a haven of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prosperity as Atlantis. P=\r\nentatron certainly wasn&#39;t an easy \nplace for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nice girl, but it was =\r\nalright.

She had chang=\r\ned \nback,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but by then, she was roaming the streets, fighting off the =\r\nurge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes against her better judgement. The more you resisted, =\r\n\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worse it would be when she gave in - one way or another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Creep. That was how the hoboes referred to her.

Sh=\r\ne was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting weaker, which was not a good sign, and she was halfway =\r\n\nthrough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a big boulevard.
