I think its best you keep your \n&gt; memory, I need \n&gt; &gt; you to remmeber always where your loyalty is. Do not dissapoint \nme \n&gt; you have \n&gt; &gt; so much potential. Now go and get in ur pod. We&#39;ll launch you far \n&gt; out of \n&gt; &gt; thier sensors so they cant tell u didnt fall from space.   You&#39;ll \n&gt; then land \n&gt; &gt; safely infront of the tripred base and get rescuded. Just make \nthe \n&gt; black \n&gt; &gt; light go around to make it look like ur scanning for a beast \nmode. \n&gt; Quilldart \n&gt; &gt; over there is installing a cover signal so all theyd be able to \n&gt; trace is a \n&gt; &gt; protoform until ur ready to get out.
