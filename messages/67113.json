La=\r\nrge\n&gt; bird-like wings extend from his back, folding behind\n&gt; him like some =\r\nregal cloak. His head appears to a large\n&gt; jungle cat&#39;s, jaws opened wide a=\r\ns if in perpetual\n&gt; roar.

Placing a =\r\nclenched fist in front of his chest, he\n&gt; bows his head to Hydras. &quot;My lieg=\r\ne.&quot; he intones in a\n&gt; deep reverberous voice. \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;       \n______________________________________________________________=\r\n_______\n_______________\n&gt; Luggage?
