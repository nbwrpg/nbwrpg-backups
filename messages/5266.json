She didn&#39;t \nlike this.  She looked around and called out, &quot;Hello, it&#39;s me, Battera. \nVulios? Are you here? Are you OK?&quot;\nShe looked about and saw no one, not Vulios or anyone.\nShe looked at the ground. She didn&#39;t like this.  She had a sinking feeling \nin her spark.\n&quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to show right now.  He won&#39;t want to see me \nanyways.&quot;\nShe looked at CyberShark. &quot;Let&#39;s go.
