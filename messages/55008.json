You never taught \nme \n&gt; to &quot;crush&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enemies. You taught me to do what was right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Optimus mentioned Magnus, Rodimus became angered.

I see that \n&gt; things \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have changed in my absence. But, no more worries, things will \nbe \n&gt; put \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to rights.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;Which is what I have come here to discuss, All these \n&gt; pathetic, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weak factions. Where are the Autobots and Decepticons of old? \n&gt; From \n&gt; &gt; &gt; what I have learned in the data disks, that I stole, there are \n&gt; many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller factions here. The NWO? The Tripreds, even the \nMaximals \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons; what are all these things?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;You two are the leaders of some prominent groups, \nRodimus, \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; act as though I taught you nothing,&quot; He walked over to him, \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; placed his hand on his shoulder, as he had left his gun on a \n&gt; ripped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; apart stump. Secretly he had placed a bug on his shoulder, \nvery \n&gt; tiny, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the size of a freckle. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you crushed those \nthat \n&gt; seek \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to rip your faction apart?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      He let go and walked to Hydra, &quot;And you, although part of \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may have killed me long ago, you have fallen from your vaunted \n&gt; seat. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You have had to merge with the new Megatron. Galvatron not \n&gt; enough for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Prime held Hydra&#39;s upper arm, and placed a bug on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Then he turned and walked away, back to where he had \n&gt; begun. &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have crossed galaxies to put things to right here,&quot; He bent \ndown \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grab his gun, which he promptly attached to his leg.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      &quot;You are both free to go,&quot; He said, then smiled at \n&gt; Rodimus, &quot;Oh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yes, one last thing...You both remember Magnus, right? Well, \nhe \n&gt; gave \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his life to bring me back, and look at how well his wish was \n&gt; granted!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      He transformed into his truck mode and lifted off, flying \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over Rodimus&#39;s and Hydra&#39;s head.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: The bugs are simple tracers, they won&#39;t do much more \nthan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say &quot;Hey! Rodimus/Hydra is here!&quot; Detected easily enough, with \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; right equipment, which most bases would have. Removal is easy \n&gt; too.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
