Ill be back to check on you buddy&quot;. Even though he didnt\n&gt; show it, he truly did enjoy all of the Stunticons&#39; company, except for\n&gt; Motormaster, and he would make those Maximals pay for injuring his\ncomerade\n&gt; in arms. Espeacially Prowl, he kept going over it in his head, the death\nof\n&gt; the late Prowl, back on and Autobot shuttle, Scavanger had hit him well\n&gt; place in the chest, and Prowl&#39;s smoking body hit the ground inactive. It\n&gt; would happen to this Prowl to, Wildrider swore, clenching his fist, as he\n&gt; headed to the storage room, for more metal for Beastbox.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
