His comm-link was flashing with a message from \nB=\r\nluestreak, but he was too busy to notice.\n\nQuestions were running through h=\r\nis mind, his logic center trying to \nmake sence of them. He frowns.

But=\r\n I had a lot to \nexplain in a \n&gt; really short amount of time. But I did try=\r\n to make it as \ninteresting as \n&gt; possible, and if you read this I promise =\r\nthat you&#39;ll find out quite \na bit \n&gt; about IR that she didn&#39;t even know her=\r\nself.\n&gt; I hope you at least enjoy it a little.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply=\r\n sighed. A good few dozen tones of scrap armor \nplating \n&gt; would kill a bot=\r\n, but she was still slightly nerved by losing on of \nher own.\n&gt; Maybe=85may=\r\nbe if she had been there to stop the battle instead of at \nthe CF \n&gt; instea=\r\nd=85maybe=85maybe she could have stopped this from happening.\n&gt; But then a =\r\nsuddenly familiar voice fills her internal sensors, \ncausing her \n&gt; to lowe=\r\nr her head a bit. *\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot;It&#39;s about time you got here!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron=\r\n Raptor growled and looked around the scraps which surrounded \nher, \n&gt; tryi=\r\nng to pinpoint Iris&#39;s current location.\n&gt; Her voice was a bit of a growl*\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot; I found her=85.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * All she had to do was look down, and there in=\r\n a cracked monitor \nscreen was \n&gt; a pulsating star right between her front =\r\nlimbs, which was Iris&#39;s \nsymbol \n&gt; which she used to communicate over progr=\r\nams.\n&gt; It was obvious she was running on her self -power, the screen not \nf=\r\nuzzy at \n&gt; all.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked down at Iris.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Geez=85haven&#39;t s=\r\neen your ugly mug for a while=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She teased. *\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Well=85=\r\nI wasn&#39;t quite expecting to see the one you&#39;re wearing \nfor \n&gt; quite some t=\r\nime yet. So let me assure you, Toad Face. The surprise \nis \n&gt; mutual=85&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * Iron Raptor&#39;s expression changed instantly as soon as Iris \nmentioned =\r\nthat \n&gt; she wasn&#39;t supposed to look like this=85YET?!!\n&gt; She bent over the =\r\nscreen.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; What do you mean, `yet&#39;? Was this supposed to happen?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * Iris didn&#39;t answer at first, her symbol simply pulsating for a \nmoment. =\r\n\n&gt; Finally she spoke in rather a serious tone.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; You know WHAT =\r\nyou are, right? And that the Second Beast \nMode was \n&gt; programmed into you,=\r\n correct?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply nodded, faintly wondering when Prowl w=\r\nas going \nto come \n&gt; over and see this too. It seemed important enough=85.\n=\r\n&gt; Iris continued.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Well=85that Second Beast Mode was originally your=\r\n real beast mode=85\nand when \n&gt; you crashed on this planet it just so happe=\r\nned that another beast \nmode was \n&gt; scanned for you since your first couldn=\r\n&#39;t survive on this planet on \nits own.\n&gt; So, a raptor was scanned and since=\r\n your SBM wasn&#39;t able to exist \nwith long \n&gt; exposure to this planets atmos=\r\nphere it became something which you \ncould call \n&gt; upon when you needed to=\r\n=85but not for long.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor took this all in the best she coul=\r\nd, finding all of \nthis new.\n&gt; She looked over her shoulder for a split sec=\r\nond to see if Prowl had \ncome \n&gt; over or was listening, all of this informa=\r\ntion new to her too.\n&gt; She then looked back towards the star.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot;=\r\nWell=85through the months you&#39;ve been here your SBM has gotten \nuse to \n&gt; t=\r\nhe atmosphere and now=85wants to become the dominant mode again. \nBut, your=\r\n \n&gt; raptor mode is very stubborn and wouldn&#39;t give it up so=85it merged=85\n=\r\nand now \n&gt; they&#39;re still fighting for which can dominate as the real beast =\r\n\nmode. \n&gt; Understand?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply nodded, her head a bit num=\r\nb with the new \ninformation \n&gt; and trying to take it all in, finding it not=\r\n quite as difficult as \nshe \n&gt; thought.\n&gt; She rolled her shoulders a bit to=\r\n get rid of a growing knot that \nwas \n&gt; building in them.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So=85what=\r\n you&#39;re saying is that when I landed on this planet my SBM \nwas my \n&gt; real =\r\nmode?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And then  somehow a new beast mode was sca=\r\nnned for me and since \nthe SBM \n&gt; wasn&#39;t use to the atmosphere it let  the =\r\nraptor take over?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Then, once the SBM got use to =\r\nthe atmosphere it wanted to be the \nmain \n&gt; beast mode again=85but the rapt=\r\nor doesn&#39;t want to give it up so \nthey&#39;re \n&gt; fighting now?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yo=\r\nu got it, kid-o.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply sighed and then lay down, it al=\r\nl a bit too \nmuch to \n&gt; bring in=85but it all made perfect sense.\n&gt; She lay=\r\n her head on her clawed hands and closed her eyes, laying \nperfectly \n&gt; sti=\r\nll.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So=85you knew this was going to happen?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Anyone wi=\r\nth half a brain could see that such a powerful \nbeast mode \n&gt; wasn&#39;t going =\r\nto stay quiet forever. It had had a taste for power \nbefore, \n&gt; then was in=\r\n an unfamiliar place and decided to lay low until it \nknew it&#39;s \n&gt; terrain =\r\nlike any clearly thinking thing. But finally when it knew \nwhat it \n&gt; was u=\r\np against it made itself strong and then tried to take over \nagain only \n&gt; =\r\nto find that it&#39;s past position was already filled. And it did when \nany \n&gt;=\r\n proud thing would, it tried to take back what was rightfully its \nown. But=\r\n \n&gt; its competition hasn&#39;t given in=85so=85that was what the pain was. Both=\r\n \nof your \n&gt; beast modes dukeing it out, and they still fight on now and wi=\r\nll \nforever \n&gt; until only one of them is left surviving. That&#39;s why you mer=\r\nged, \neach had \n&gt; had a moment to try and transform but they both did it at=\r\n once=85\nmixed a bit \n&gt; of your DNA and here you are now.\n&gt; Clearly showing=\r\n two beast modes which are only half transformed. \nEach trying \n&gt; to kill t=\r\nhe other so that it can fully transform and take the place \nas your \n&gt; beas=\r\nt mode.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply opened her eyes and lifted her head.*\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot; And what happens if one kills the other?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Half of you wil=\r\nl die=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply shook her head, wondering just when the=\r\n \ndifficulties \n&gt; and problems would finally stop. Everything happening so =\r\nfast and \nnow \n&gt; finding out that she could die if one of her modes died as=\r\n well.\n&gt; She then looked down at the star with a blank look.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; And if=\r\n neither  gives in?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Then you will remain like this until one =\r\neventually does \ndie, unable \n&gt; to transform because your spark is so corru=\r\npted by the modes that \nit doesn&#39;t \n&gt; know beast from bot.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Rap=\r\ntor then sighed and looked up at the sky, wondering just \nhow it \n&gt; could b=\r\ne such a good day with such rotten things happening now.\n&gt; She then slowly =\r\nlooked off towards Prowl, her eyes basically saying \nthat she \n&gt; didn&#39;t kno=\r\nw what to do now=85.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n____________________________________________=\r\n__________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hot=\r\nmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, cre=\r\nate your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
