The Rock, when he first came in, was jammed down everyone&#39;s throats. \nRVD has also earned his dues. DDP and Kanyon are 2 of the most talented \nwrestlers today. Kanyon knows moves, major advantage over Matt Hardy. I don&#39;t \ncare if he doesn&#39;t spit in his hand. The majority of the good wrestlers are \nplaced in WCW ECW. You like WWF better, because they&#39;re good guys, and \ntherefore you cheer them on, much like what marks generally do. No shame in \nthat, but what I said is completely true and it&#39;s not worth arguing the \ntruth. PA: Booker T has been wrestling for 15 years now. HE&#39;S paid his \ndues... &gt;&gt;\n\nNo...then I am not a &#39;mark&#39;.  Who the hell comes up with these gay words like \n&quot;bomdigity&quot; and making &quot;tight&quot; into a meaning for &quot;cool&quot;?  When the Rock \nfirst came into the WWF he wasn&#39;t the Rock.  He was Dwayne Johnson.  And he \nwas booed.  Then he was Flex Kavana.  And he was booed.  Then he was Rocky \nMaiva, and he was booed.  Then he became the Rock.  Then because of this \ngreat character he had made, he gained popularity and is as great as he is.  \nHe has charisma and personality.  He has great moves and talent.  He&#39;s not a \nbabyface, by the way, he&#39;s a heel.  So you&#39;re wrong about that.  The only \ntime I root for babyfaces is when they&#39;re ridiculously outnumbered and \nsomeone is to much of a wuss to fight them.  Which, gee, the Rock always goes \nin headfirst.  And I like bad guys majorly, hence the whole Decepticon thing \nwith me.  In G1 they&#39;re trash-talked and always lose, but they&#39;re still cool \nbecause they have attitude unlike the mostly monotonic attitude of the \nAutobots.  &quot;They&#39;re in trouble we must aid them.&quot;  But the Decepticons, \n&quot;They&#39;re in trouble, let&#39;s sit back and watch &#39;em burn!&quot;  Rock isn&#39;t really a \nbad guy, but he sure as hell isn&#39;t a babyface.\n\nSee, if you&#39;d read what I type, you&#39;d notice I talked about the charisma and \nmoves.  Costumes aren&#39;t that important.  Hell, look at Kane.  What he&#39;s \nwearing now is gay.  Before that he had it perfected.  I don&#39;t like the whole \nbiker thing with Undertaker.  But that&#39;s okay, because they make up for it \nwith skill and cool attitudes.  The WCW lacks those.\n\nIf WCW or ECW were any good, they wouldn&#39;t have fallen.  They&#39;re just \nbreeding grounds for really good wrestlers like Stone Cold and such who join \nthe WCW.  Only reason WWF superstars joined WCW is there contracts would end \nwith the WWF and ol&#39; Turner would be there waving muchos money in their face. \n Booker T.&#39;s been wrestling in what for 15 years?  He sure as hell sucks for \ngoing that long.  \n\nThe Rock has NEVER backed down from a fight.  Everyone else has.  Stone Cold, \nKurt Angle, Shane O&#39;Mac, all of &#39;em.  That&#39;s part of the Rock&#39;s character.  \nHe won&#39;t back down, even if he gets the hell beat out of him.  Sometimes he \nwins, sometimes he doesn&#39;t.\n\n-L. Unitron\n\n\n\n"}}
