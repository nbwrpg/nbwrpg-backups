I suggest \nthis: who has skills in HTMl help to up date the site; who have \nskills in draw and use programs as adobe or corel, help to do banners \nand a new front images. Who have suggestion of promottions, help to \npromote the site, find out who is still active and not posting and \ninvite them to come back.\n\nTo all: try to post very often and answer the post of every new \nmember.\n\nIt&#39;s a hard work but we can revive this site if we work together\n\n\n"}}
