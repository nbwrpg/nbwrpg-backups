Oh, and you know how \nKinger is \n&gt; always complaining about moding? Yes, well, in the past several \nposts he has \n&gt; said that Hell Beast is dead. I think that qualifies as a mode.\n&gt; \n&gt;     The Virus Scanner loacted the Virus. Indded it had surrounded \nthe Spark \n&gt; of Hell Beast. But, luckily this Virus Scanner could hold it off \nfor awhile.\n&gt;     &quot;Hmm....were going to need something to get rid of this Virus. \nAnd I just \n&gt; know what will do the trick. Call Darkmouse.&quot; Megatron ordered. He \nwas going \n&gt; to beg her, do anything, for a Liquid Energon transfussion. Just \nenough to \n&gt; kill the Virus off, not nearly as much as she has in her body.\n&gt;     Looking to the comm, Megatron says, &quot;Darkmouse, This is \nCommander \n&gt; MEgatron. I beseech you to allow us a quart of your Liquid Energon \nblood. \n&gt; Senator Hell Beast is currently ill and needs it to combat a Virus. \nIf you \n&gt; allow us what we ask, we will grant you a favor. Please think our \noffer over. \n&gt; Perhaps this could be the first steps to a treaty of peace between \nour \n&gt; factions. Thank you agian.&quot; He said finally and logged off, hoping \nshe would \n&gt; accept.\n\n\n"}}
