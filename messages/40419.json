I will accept that absorbing thing however as for using\n&gt; &gt; it to better herself I will ignore that since that entire energy\n&gt; &gt; absorbing and bettering thing is not listed anywhere in\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmares bio. Which I just looked at, and if it suddenly\n&gt; &gt; &quot;appeared&quot; there I would be very suspicious of it. Also note that\n&gt; &gt; energy from sparks doesnt act like normal energy. Since\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare isnt a creation of the Bamphomet and the energy is\n&gt; &gt; specifically created to be used solely by those he creates it would\n&gt; &gt; have a very bad negative effect on blacknightmare if she absorbed it\n&gt; &gt; and/or tried to use it to improve anything.
