But he didn&#39;t \nknow what good he would do. He may just get in the way.\n\nSomething hard hit the top of his head, freezing his thoughts. He cried out \nin pain, grabbing for his head. He looked down, seeing that a heavy shard of \nrock had broken off from the ceiling of the tunnel. That was the signal for \nhim to get the Inferno out of there. He wasn&#39;t needed.\n\nHe ducked his head, a little embarassed. &quot;Ah&#39;ll jus&#39; go. Hollar if ya need \nanythin&#39;!&quot; He walked out as quickly as he could. As he exited, he saw that \nhis body was covered in black dust and soot. He wiped at his arms and chest. \nHe would have to clean this off. He transformed to beast mode and left the \ncave.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
