He hoisted Spinister over his shoulder, then\ngrabbed Jagged and Needlenose, and lifted them off the ground by their\narms, then headed back to the CR chambers. He placed each once in\ncarefully, then entered one of his own, and set it on the same setting\nas Jaggeds, replication of Alien lifeform.\n\nApeface trudged over to the hole in the side of the ship, as Spasma rode\non his back. &quot;We take to the air?&quot; He asked Quake.\n\n"}}
