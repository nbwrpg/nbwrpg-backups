She could see a wolf \nlimping long on the ground.  She flew down to make sure it was him \nand not a pred or a regular wolf.\n\nShe flew up to him and landed.  She looked at him. &quot;Lunarpine. Oh my \ngosh am I happy to see you. I missed you so...&quot; her voice trailed off \nas she saw how damaged her was.  She wasn&#39;t sure if she should get \nmad now or wait until he was in better condition to yell at him. She \nwould wait, but just for a little while.\n\nShe transformed into bot mode. &quot;So, how was your camping trip?&quot; she \nsaid with a slight touch of sarcasm. &quot;You know, for a few days of fun \nin the sun, you look a bit worn out.  You feeling OK?&quot;  She knelt \ndown and patted his head and scratched his ears.  She saw the mech \nfluid coming out of his mouth. Now she was getting really concerned.\n&quot;If you stay in beast mode I can carry to back to the base.  You look \nlike you could use a CR chamber pretty badly.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; The wolf stumbled again, mech fluid dripping from his jaw,his \n&gt; internal injuries had reopened. he had to continue. he could \nenvision \n&gt; Shadow Wings grief, he could envision the sight of Deathscythe \n&gt; spitting on his spark laughing at Lunarpine for his stupidity. he \n&gt; smelled the air, the smell of past battles was growing stronger, he \n&gt; figured he was inside the Maximal scanning zone, he hoped the Ark \n&gt; could spare a bot to help him back yo the base. he looked to the \nsky, \n&gt; the sky above glittered by the light of the half moon. He looked at \n&gt; the half moon and opened his fluidy jaw.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Howwwwwwlllllll&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He pressed on with the thought of what he&#39;d do when he met up with \n&gt; the Pred that did this to him. &quot;I have your scent monster&quot; the \nwords \n&gt; echoed through his mind. The wolf had another reason for survival, \n&gt; revenge.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
