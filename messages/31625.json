She just wished that he was there right now so she could\nstrangle his throat!\nCRASH!\nGlass shattered everywhere and Iron drew her fist back from the console\nscreen, but by then the conversation had ended and screen had gone black.*\n\n&quot; Well, SCREW you TOO!&quot;\n\n* She shouted before whipping around and storming out of the room, deciding \nto not even bother to clean up because the ship was enough in shambls that a \nshattered screen looked common place.\nThat was another thing that made her angry.\nYet, instead of heading right outside Iron headed towards the armoury,\nthrowing open the door and searching through the room for pieces to portable \nautoguns.\nGrabbing a large sack at the door when she walked in, she started grabbing \npieces from shelves and throwing them into it, taking power sources and \nplacing them into the sack too.\nNow with what she needed she was about to walk out of the room but stopped \nwhen she saw a portable shield...or rather a couple. Grabbing them as well \nshe headed out of the room with the sack over her shoulder and towards the \nbase doors.\nSomeone had to get things going right out there and a little extra firepower \nnever hurt anyone...except the enemy.\nReaching the doors she exited and looked around that the battle, moving out \ntowards it a bit before going off to the side and then setting the sack \ndown, taking out a shield. Looking it over she activated it and then set it \ndown infront of her, then began work on constructing the first autogun.\nHer thoughts already telling Prowl that she was out there and what she was \nup to.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
