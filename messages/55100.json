Throwing her back off her feet, \nagain she \n&gt; slid towards the edge of a nearby cliff. Again, she attempted to \nget up... \n&gt; then collapsed. Attempted to get up again.. then collapsed \nfinally, unable to \n&gt; move. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her Techno-organic form... smoldering... heavily damaged. She hung \nonto \n&gt; functioning. This was no different than all the other times \nbefore. But... \n&gt; the other times, she didn&#39;t have a delicate techo-organic body. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her form laid there on the edge of the cliff... unmoving.\n\n\n"}}
