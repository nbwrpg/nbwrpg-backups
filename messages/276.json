There was a small lava pool to the left and it gave off \nenough heat to bite back the morning chill.\nHe walked towards the right and stopped when he was fare enough from the \nlava to be comfortable, he then bent and set Tavatron onto the ground as \ncarefully as he could. There was no telling how damaged her repair mode \nwould get if he would have just dropped her.\nDinobot straightened up and looked back towards to mouth of the cave, \nTavatron would be safe here until he returned with breakfast.*\n\n&quot; I do not have anything edible at hand, however, I am leaving to hunt. You \nshall be safe here until my return.&quot;\n\n* It was then that Dinobot turned and walked towards the cave mouth, he \nwouldn&#39;t be long and he would try and bring back a fare sized catch.\nOnce outside he transformed into his Beast Mode and stalked off into the \nsurrounding trees.                                             The morning \nwas young and a predator&#39;s stomach growled!*\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
