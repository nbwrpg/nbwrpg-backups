It was difficult because \nof his diplomatic traing. Set just hoped Hell Beast couldnt detect him lying \nto him. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: A mining operation? Thats what Ive been doing for the past \nyear!\n\n::: Set ::: Yes, but we need the energon badly. Our fleets are getting \ndry....the Senate said you were taking to long.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Nonsense! I own the Senate! They take there orders from \nme...as dose the TriPredicus Council.\n\n::; Set lughed. He knew that was a flat out lie ::: The TriPredicus Council?! \nYeah....I bet.\n\n::: Hell Beast :: Silence. Im giving the orders now. Im taking this ship \nunder my control because I belive you are a Predacon defector on a Maximal \nReconnisis mission. Dont move.\n\n::: Set glanced at Jackle. THe tiny bot pointed a pistol to Set&#39;s head, where \na tiny red dot targeted him between the eyes :::\n\n::: Set ::: No need for this, Senator. We will cooperate with you entirely.\n\n::: Secretly, he glanced over to Killer, sending a silent message to help him \nout. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Take me to your bridge, I wish to review your computer \ndata.\n\n::: Set ::: hu...oh...We in the process of cleaning up the bridge from the \ncrash-\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Enough of this! Your a traitor and I will prove it!\n\n::: Set agian glances at Killer...but then realizes something. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Alright, I&#39;ll admit why we are really here.\n\n::: Hell Beast pushed Jackles pistol down ::: Excellent. Now we are getting \nsomewhere.\n\n::: Set ::: I am a Predacon Intelligence officer, as is Shuko. We were sent \nhere to evaluate your progress and assist in any thing you may need for a \nbrief stay.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Proff?\n\n::: Set ::: Ah....yes. Um, proff? we have the data the TriPredicus Council \nsent us about you and what we know about your so called Beast Wars.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Then why didnt you contact us in the beggining?\n\n::: Set ::: With the transwarp corridor still open and the asteriods...our \ncommunications were to disrupted to do anything.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Really? What dose the golden disk mean? \n\n::: Set thought for a moment. He knew it was what Megatron stole...but he \ndidnt know what was on it. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Well?\n\n::: Set ::: It means...\n\n::: He knew it mut be important...:::\n\n::: Set ::: Ah, It has important information on it....vital to your mission.\n\n::: Hell Beast sat back. His red eyes went into slits :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Very good guess. Very well. I belive you for the moment. \nAlthough, I will be leaving a garrison behinde, for your help of course.\n\n::: Set cursed under his breath. THis helpful garrison Hell Beast was going \nto leave wold be a group of spies. :::\n\n::: Set ::: That is alright. We have numerous-\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: I insist. Do you think its wise to question a Senator?\n\n::: Set :: Not at all. Im just concerned for your safety. You need all the \ntroops you have. It would be a waste to leave them here.\n\n::: Hell Beast paused ::: Oh no. I do have a certian Predacon in mind who \ncould help both of us greatly.\n\n::: Set ::: Who would this be?\n\n::: Hell Beast raised his hand holding an empty spark chamber. It was similar \nto Rampages. It had energon knifes that would stab the spark, to control the \nbot in question. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: The clone of a mad scientist, Transanulas. He will serve \nour needs.\n\n::: Set nodded. At least he got him out of leaving a whole garrison behinde \nto spy on them. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron in his damaged form came to the ship. It was somewhat quiet now. \nHe could see a Predacon symbol on the starboard side of the ship. With a bit \nof hope he buzzed to the open hatch and went inside. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: At last...I will have a new body and revenge!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
