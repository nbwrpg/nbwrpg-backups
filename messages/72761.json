He steps back, slowly as his passengers also\n&gt; look shocked themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No way, that should have at least dazed him.  I think we&#39;re all over our\n&gt; heads on this one, guys.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I bet if that old silver dragon was around, whoever is causing all this,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be doing it now.  There has to be some sort of connection between\n&gt; the dragon, and whatever darkness that&#39;s looming over us.  And what if the\n&gt; only way to stop it, is something only the dragon knew?  We&#39;ll never know.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;We&#39;re not in over our heads, we&#39;re out of it!

While he looked aggressive he was not actually\nattacking. In fact none of them were. And then there was a flash and\nCYCLONUS and the sweeps vanished!\n\n&quot;Blast!&quot; SKY SHADOW said as he looked up and then at the others. &quot;Why\nwould they put holograms here? What is the purpose?&quot;\n\n&quot;A distraction!&quot; BANTOR said suddenly. &quot;But why, from what?&quot;\n\n&quot;Interesting.&quot; CRYOTEK said as he stepped out from his own firing\npoint. &quot;What do you think of this . . . ?&quot; CRYOTEK turned to look at\nwhere HYDRAS was standing before the batle started . . .\n\nLEO PRIME nodded as he stepped back to look at the empty spot where\nHYDRAS once stood. &quot;I think we found our reason.&quot;\n\nHYDRAS had vanished.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
