She then \ncarefully, set everything down where is was supposed to be. She \nslowly drifted off to sleep in the corner. But as she slept, her \ndreams seamed to come alive in the room.  She dreamed of sparring \nwith Lunarpine in the forest like she used to.  \n\nIn the lab, two drones that were laying in the corner suddenly stood \nup. They started to spar right there in the lab.  One tried to pounce \non the other and showed actions that resembled a wolf&#39;s actions. The \nother flapped it arms and simulated owl like trates.  The drones \nwrestled and sparred.  The one that represented Lunarpine put it&#39;s \nfront arms out and stuck it&#39;s backside in the air and wiggled it like \nit was wagging a tail. The other that represented Ice/ShadowWing \nflapped it&#39;s arms and stood there a few feet away from the other \ndrone. It then folded it&#39;s arms under like folding wings. Then the \nowl drone jumped and landed on the wolf drone.\n\nThey rolled and tussled on the lab floor. All the while, Ice dreamed \nof the fun times of sparring with Lunarpine.\n\n\n"}}
