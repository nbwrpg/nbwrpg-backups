Wildrider dosent believe in hand\n&gt; shakes).\n\n\n::Domnijoe, Blindchaos::\n\n Domnijoe turned to Cyclonus. \n    &quot;Full Fledged &#39;Cons, eh?&quot; She snorted. &quot;I thought I was already \none. Ah well...I&#39;ll do things by your books. If I ain&#39;t a &#39;Con by yer \nstandards, then I ain&#39;t a &#39;Con.&quot; She pointed to Blindchaos who now \njoined them. &quot;I&#39;m sure my buddy will feel the same way.&quot;\n     She returned Wildrider&#39;s grin, though hers was that of a chronic \ntrickster with ideas.... Her mischeviousness was bright in her eyes. \nShe eagerly clanged knuckles with him. Domnijoe had a feeling she was \ngonna like this guy, even if his spit was disgusting.\n    &quot;The world can always do with more scrap metal&quot; she said, her \nsmirk suddenly sly. &quot;and I&#39;m willing to help make it.&quot;\n    Blindchaos transformed at this point, satisfied that the new \ncomers were not a threat. His grin was large, friendly and free. It \nalmost oozed it was so disgustingly sweet. \n    &quot;Scrap.&quot; He said in a charming voice, &quot;is everywhere. Show me \nwhere it is and I&#39;ll take care of it for you.&quot;\n\n************\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n***************\n\n\n"}}
