What the hell was wrong with this guy? \nWell, it was her problems now, she was the living being with the \nguy&#39;s memories, now. But he seemed so tormented, so hurt, so \nheartbroken. Divitri seen that he was just an idiot in love, nothing \nmore. Then what was he doing here? How was he inside of the base? \nSomebody took him in with them, perhaps? Divitri made up her mind to \nfind Gangon&#39;s girlfriend. She was nice looking, at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divitri: Whenever you need me, sir, give me a call, I will come to \nyou.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divitri said to Kluster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divitri: I have to go at the moment, but I will return shortly \nwhether called or not, count on that. I am always at your service, \neven after I am dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divitri left at that...\n\n\n"}}
