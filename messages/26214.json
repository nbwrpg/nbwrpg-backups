She fell silent, and transformed to her beast mode. Having \nfur helped warm her a little, but it was still fairly cold. Tucking \nher wings across her back, she lowered herself to the ground beside \nCarnage, and rested her chin on her front paws. She gazed into the \ndarkened forest, thinking.\n\n&quot;Well I&#39;m certainly not out here for a title. It&#39;s not as if I&#39;m \ngoing to call myself Teltoli SilverWing: Fighter Expert at the end of \nthe day&quot; She said the last sentance sarcastically, but the first was \nsincere, with a voice that had undercurrents of hope in it.\n\nThe gears in her mind were ticking away as she thought to come up \nwith a suitable answer.\n\n&quot;I mean, you have a lot of experiance from what I&#39;ve seen,&quot; She \nturned her gaze towards her friend, still keeping her chin rested on \nher paws &quot;and you&#39;ve gotten even better through tremendous and bloody \nbattles. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have that experiance, or even want \nto, but I need to learn how to fight before I get myself killed. And \nthen what will bots view me as? &#39;Poor Teltoli, the teenager who \nwanted to be an adult and only got herself killed through \nfoolishness&#39;. That&#39;ll be the words on my gravestone if I don&#39;t train, \nor at least get better at fighting&quot;\n\nThe Fuzor blew out a heavy sigh, and swished her tail gently over the \nground behind her, getting the silver tip a little dirty. She scowled \nand reminded herself to clean it later on.\n\n&quot;And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get a better training out of anyone \nthan you&quot;\n\n\n"}}
