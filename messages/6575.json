The Destrocons have already \nengaged them,&quot; Bobertron said to CyberShark. &quot;I need you to use your cloaking \ndevice and get as close as you can and do as much damage as possible to the \nhull, so we can get inside.&quot;\n    &quot;Understood. I will go immediately,&quot; CyberShark said. He started to run \nto the entrance of the base. Once getting there he transformed and flew off. \n    Nearing the Iron Fist he cloaked, he hoped their scanners were at least a \nfew years old. (His cloaking technology is very new.) He got really close and \nstarted to fire from his primary blaster.\n(Can I post damage for a ship? Or is that moding? If not then) The plasma \ngrenades found their mark and started to tear the hull.\n(If so then) The plasma grenades found their mark, CyberShark flew to another \nspot on the ship and started to shoot again. He hoped that the grenades would \ndo at least a little damage.\n\n"}}
