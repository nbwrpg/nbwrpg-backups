She was just \ncrossing a river, when everything when black.  She woke up a mile \ndown river, on the side of the river bank.  She slowly got up and \nwalked a few feet, then fell to the ground.  She closed her eyes and \ntried to think of what just happened.  She lay there, feeling an \nimmence pain in her head. She transformed into bot mode and sat down \non the side of the river. &quot;I must have hit a rock when I wasn&#39;t \nlooking.&quot;  She glanced around, but saw only trees around her. &quot;And \nwhere am I now? I must have floated here, but where&#39;s here?&quot;\n\nShe stood up, putting her hand to her forehead, and started to walk \nonlong what looked like a path. It lead to the Allience base.\n\n\n::KitKat3::\nShe woke up and shook her head.  &quot;OUCH! That hurt like the pit. What \nhappened?&quot;  She looked around, but saw no other bots in sight.  She \nsniffed, but only caught her own scent.  She decided to keep going.  \nShe walked along, hoping to make it to the base soon. \n\n\n"}}
