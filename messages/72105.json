There was a beep indicating activation and then he shifted\ninto beast mode, a large polar bear. Following suit PROWL became an\nowl, WOLFGANG became a wolf and RAMULUS an ibex, all of them\ntransmetaled and ready for action.\n\nThe trip inside the jungle was swift at first, the ground still\nflattened by what appeared to be a tremendous stampeed of large\ncreatures, presumably the stampeed of dinosaurs that had rushed out\nand had reached as far as HYDRAS&#39; base hundred of miles away before\nbeing stopped.\n\nThe path continued into the jungle, and was just begining to fade when\nthe sound of something crashing through the jungle foliage could be\nheard coming from several hundred yards in front of them. As they\napproached, from the sound of things it was several somethings, four\nof them, each of them larger then any one of them by the sound and\nlooks of things!\n\nThey were closing fast!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
