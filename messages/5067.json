She snarled at his greeting.*\n\n&quot; To bad I can&#39;t say the same for you!&quot;\n\n* She listened to his statement for them to go along with them to their base, a smile developing on her face as she then put her gun away.\nIt was a bit hard not to notice the huge rifle aiming at her head but then simply shook her head, she had far more to do then just be carried off by the Alliance.\nIron Raptor put her hands on her hips for a moment before shaking her head again...giving Tavatron a knowing look to just go along with it.*\n\n&quot; You know I&#39;d love to go back to your place for dinner but I&#39;m a little to busy right now.&quot;\n\n* She then chanced something that a bot would say was crazy but she had no time to argue with these...bots.\nIron Raptor walked up to Zardus but then shouldered past him, simply walking by Predabot but keeping in mind that it wouldn&#39;t be nice to be shot by a giant rifle.\nWith more guts then she cared to admit she then looked back over her shoulder towards the Alliance leader.*\n\n&quot; Maybe some other time. Come on Tav, time&#39;s a wastin.&quot;\n\n* With that she then turned her head towards the direction of the Ark and kept walking, if she could just get herself and Tavatron a few more feet from the Alliance then they could make a run for it. If not...then damage was clearly seen in the future!*\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
