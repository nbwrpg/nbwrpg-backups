Quake\nraised his fist again, and brought it down, narrowly missing Jagged, and\nsmashing another table into dust. &quot;You should have stayed out kid.&quot; He\nthreatened, as Jagged kept trying to move away. Swing after swing went\nover his head, to his side, narrowly missing, until he was caught\nstraight in the gut by a kick, followed up by a metal cracking upercut,\nwhich sent him flying into a wall. Quake moved in for the kill. &quot;Yeah,\nthis is it.&quot; He said. He knew it was nothing like the action a war\nprovides, but it would have to do. He cupped the back of Jagged&#39;s head\nwith one hand, and pulled it forward a little bit, as he drove his fist\nstraight into his enemies face. Metal crunched, and gave to the strength\nof the blow. He stood up, and put his foot on Jagged&#39;s throat, getting a\ngood look at his crushed face. Jagged looked up, through cracked optic\nsensors, at a real bad Decepticon, and saw his short pointless life\nflash before his eyes.\n\n&quot;Come on Quake, he&#39;s just a kid.&quot; Slugslinger said from over at a stool. \n\n&quot;Nunh unh. He&#39;s a loud mouth punk, i&#39;ve dealt with him before. He sure\ncan&#39;t back up his words though.&quot; he put pressure on to Jagged&#39;s throat,\nwatching him squirm for gas exchange. He was to busy laughing to notice\nthe room becoming more hazy, and heavier than just a bit of foul oil\nbeing burned.\n\n"}}
