He also had two jade eye \nbeams that spit out at Ra and Zues :::\n\n::: Jackle, Gremlin, and Transanulas just began the random assult, making \nrandom targets and taking the stress of the two main gunners, Marine and Hell \nBeast. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Once we get Set, I suspect his creations will make a hasty \nretreat.\n\n::: Marine, in a gravely, gruff voice that seemed to say he had been a vetren \nin many wars, ::: I do agree Commander. We have the tactical advantage of \noutnumbering them and we know the valley much better. Besides, I do belive \nthey are cowards.\n\n::: Hell Beast decided that not only the turtle bot was a warrior, but a \nskilled wiseman. Whatever ship this bot came out of, Hell Beast was glad to \nhave him on his side. It seemd as though the trtle belived he was in a \nconstant war, and he did have a unique respect for rank and order. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Yes Marine. Now, we&#39;ll need to get behinde them, once we \nsplit them apart, we will win.\n\n:::: Marine ::: But Commander, they used the same technique on us earlier in \nthe forest. Im sure thats what they are attempting as we speak.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, yes. Any suggestions?\n\n::: Marine ::: Send Black Aracnia, Pheniox, and Gremlin to flank there \nposition. They will attack from behinde while we assult from the front. No \ndoubt there will be casualties though...\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Good thinking. We will contact Zardus as well...prehaps \nhalf of his team can help us here, and the other half can attack the \nNewcomers ship directly.\n\n::: Marine took out a feild communicator designed to be used in heavey combat \n:::\n\n::: Marine ::: Commander Zardus of the Allience, this is General Marine of \nthe Predacon Empire. We request your assistance. I will send out the map of \nwhats going on and where you should attack. I advise you split up your men \nand send half to help us, and the other half to attack the Newcomers ship.\n\n::: He then put it away and continued firing :::\n\n::: Hell Beast noticed how Marine made himself General, and how he referred \nto the Predacons as the Predacon Empire. Truly he did have complete loyalty \nto the cause, and if he were born on Cybertron, he would have been a great \ntransformer. Now, though, he was a fantastic general who would no doubt help \nthe Predacons in there victories. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Set watched as the Turtle bot sent his message. He cursed and then tried \nto his his large green head. That warrior was single handedly crippling Set&#39;s \ncampagin...he would have to get rid of Marine or convert him. :::\n\n::: Ra ::: Master Set! Master Set! The transmission the Turtle bot just sent \nwas to Zardus of the Allience! \n\n::: Set ::: Damn! Tell Shuko to send out a dispatch to the Alliences base. \nWe&#39;ll keep them busy there.\n\n::: Ra ::: I dont think Master Shuko has any spare warriors!\n\n::: Set ::: He is a smart Predacon, he wil lthink of something. Now, Zues, \ncan you form Dark Messhia and crush these bugs ?!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron watched as the fuzor listened to the battle outside :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Dont worry. Your all fixed up now. \n\n::: He pointed to a seat where Quickstrike was to sit. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: We are only here for a short time. A coallition with Hell \nBeast. And as your commander, Im ordering you to accompany me to the \nNewcomers vessle. We will set up a small fortification there and monitor \nthere communications and dispatches.\n\n::: He turned to leave ::: Get ready, we wil ldepart soon.\n\n"}}
