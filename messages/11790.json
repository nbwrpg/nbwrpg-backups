She \nchecked a few lines and replaced more of them.  She put in a few \npower surge protectors and disconnected a few old power packs that \nwere melted together.  She crawled out from under the console and \nlooked for her screwdriver.  She was covered with soot and ash and \ngrease.  She found it and crawled back in under the console.  She \nfixed a few more circuits and crawled back out.  She went back to the \nenginering room and found a spare mother board and a few CPU&#39;s that \nshe could connect to fix Teletran with.  She took it all back up to \nthe computer room and started working again.\n\n\n"}}
