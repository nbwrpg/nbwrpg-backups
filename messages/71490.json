You&#39;re right, I do need a few=\r\n more hours in CR.  Quickstride, Legacy is your best bet for engineering pu=\r\nrposes, he can help you with research, development and construction.  What =\r\nyou&#39;re proposing seems a bit complex, and it&#39;s always good to have someone =\r\nelse with you to collaborate with.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nods enthusiastically.\n\n&quot; =\r\nI was hoping ta have his support actually, well do.  There&#39;s a few things I=\r\n need ta sort out as far as materials.. And of course design and functionab=\r\nility.  &quot;\n\nTucson smiles gently and then turns to the little green mech.\n\n&quot;=\r\n I assure you that if you assist us in locating the escaped predicons, you =\r\nwill be granted immunity from enemy forces.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Leo Prime.  =\r\n\n\n&quot; I have a feeling Hydras may take advantage of the situation and attempt=\r\n another assault on this parameter.  Be sure our boundaries are well guarde=\r\nd around the clock, and have everyone take turns running guard duty.&quot;\n\nHe n=\r\nods as a signal that things were adjourned for the time being.  \n\n&quot; That pr=\r\netty much covers everything, Leo Prime, thank you.&quot;\n\nHe tries to get up fro=\r\nm his seat and stumbles.  Quickstride catches him.\n\n&quot; Whoa, careful sir.  L=\r\neo, better call someone for transport to the CR chambers, his balance is re=\r\nally messed up.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Jul 21,=\r\n 2011, at 2:14 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods in agreement.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Very well Leo Prime.  Quickstri=\r\nde will head the construction of the wind\n&gt;&gt; and hydro turbines.  Anyone wh=\r\no wishes to be on that team, report to\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride for instruction.   As=\r\n for Cheetor, I&#39;m afraid he has yet to be\n&gt;&gt; found.  Nightshift and Rattrap=\r\n did all they could to search for him, and I\n&gt;&gt; do believe Nightshift is se=\r\nverely damaged and will need immediate repairs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME =\r\nnodded, =E2=80=9CQuickstride will head that team. Coordinate with\n&gt; Legacy =\r\non that as well. He is primarily the Ark=E2=80=99s guardian and has\n&gt; been =\r\neffecting repairs for some time. His knowledge of science and\n&gt; general eng=\r\nineering seems to be off the charts.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot sits =\r\nup and looks to Leo Prime.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;He&#39;s not listening to me.  Maybe he&#39;ll l=\r\nisten to you.  He&#39;s already taken\n&gt;&gt; more of his share of hard hits and if =\r\nhe thinks he&#39;s gonna go out there and\n&gt;&gt; do it all again, he&#39;s flipped a mi=\r\ncrochip or two. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson directs his attention over to Straight Shot=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; I know, I know, you have every right to not approve of my action=\r\ns, but I\n&gt;&gt; failed this faction once, I will not fail it again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Str=\r\naight Shot swallows hard as a tear trickles down her right eye.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; No=\r\n, what happened back then wasn&#39;t your fault.  None of it was.  Leo he&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nblaming himself for what happened to Rodimus and the others on himself.  He=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; thinks that if he had just been a little more careful, he could&#39;ve prev=\r\nented\n&gt;&gt; Hydras from winning that battle.  But it wasn&#39;t his fault.  I was =\r\nin his cab\n&gt;&gt; with him as an on board scout, looking out for possible ambus=\r\nh.  I saw\n&gt;&gt; someone in the skies far off behind us and I froze because he =\r\nmoved in\n&gt;&gt; really fast.  By the time Cyclonus moved in for the shot, I cou=\r\nld barely say\n&gt;&gt; anything.  I was terrified.  Then that&#39;s when it happened.=\r\n  I don&#39;t remember\n&gt;&gt; too much after that but he was not the bot who failed=\r\n the faction, I was.\n&gt;&gt; And there isn&#39;t a day that goes by without me being=\r\n reminded of that costly\n&gt;&gt; error I made out on that battle field.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nTucson moves over to his sister and puts a hand on her shoulder.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; N=\r\no, that was never your fault.  It was mine.  I should have never asked\n&gt;&gt; y=\r\nou toventure out with me on such a dangerous mission.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He then looks=\r\n to everyone.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Times are about to get difficult.  In order to win t=\r\nhe battle ahead we\n&gt;&gt; have to work together, and we need to remain strong. =\r\n We will overcome as we\n&gt;&gt; have for centuries.  Freedom is the right for al=\r\nl sentient beings.  Now let\n&gt;&gt; us win it, for this planet, for us and for P=\r\nrimus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a look from LEO PRIME as he watches the sc=\r\nene unfold. =E2=80=9CYou do\n&gt; look like you need more time in the CR chambe=\r\nr before you can resume\n&gt; full duty status Tuscon.=E2=80=9D LEO said soberl=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; LORD ELDER, who had just walked into the room nodded as he walked\n&gt;=\r\n straight up the middle isle. =E2=80=9CYep, Tuscon is known for trying to p=\r\nush\n&gt; himself too hard. If he balks too much, perhaps I can get Santon over=\r\n\n&gt; there to give him a sedative.=E2=80=9D ELDER pointed at the bulky medic =\r\nwho\n&gt; was sitting on the stage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although LORD ELDER was being a bit fa=\r\ncetious SANTON nodded grimly as\n&gt; he looked over at TUSCON, =E2=80=9CYes, r=\r\nest would be the order of the door.\n&gt; And a few more hours in the CR.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson puts an arm around Talon with a playful smile=\r\n on his face.  It would\n&gt;&gt; be his only moment of light heartedness.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot; You&#39;re absolutely right, Talon but it&#39;s a shame that CR chambers are only=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; designed for one individual at a time.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He wispers quietly with =\r\na cat like grin on his face.  He then turns to Leo\n&gt;&gt; Prime, with an attent=\r\nive nod.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Nightshift and Rattrap were out looking for Cheetor togeth=\r\ner but, an\n&gt;&gt; unknown insectile force attacked them and in an effort to elu=\r\nde them,\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift spun out and collided with something in the forest w=\r\nhich caused\n&gt;&gt; extensive damage.  He should be in med bay now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ratt=\r\nrap takes his seat.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late Wheels, I had ta help Ramulus ge=\r\nt Nightshift inta the med\n&gt;&gt; bay.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;That&#39;s all r=\r\night, I understand.  Now as far as the escaped enemy forces,\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to=\r\n send Silverbolt with Kup to the ship&#39;s parameter to see if you\n&gt;&gt; pick up =\r\non their signatures.  Once they&#39;ve determined the path of the\n&gt;&gt; escaped pr=\r\nedicons, I&#39;d like a full report and please, try not to take them\n&gt;&gt; on your=\r\n own.  Call for backup the minute you find them.  I worry about all\n&gt;&gt; of y=\r\nou, and if Anything ever happened to anyone of you, I&#39;d never forgive\n&gt;&gt; my=\r\nself.  &quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He sighs.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; No one has the right to control what isn=\r\n&#39;t theirs to govern.

Leo Prime,=\r\n I vote we take care of the perpetrator\n&gt;&gt; together.  He seems to need a ta=\r\nste of his own medicine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME nodded again, =E2=80=9C=\r\nAnd perhaps this mech here.=E2=80=9D He pointed to\n&gt; the green mech that ha=\r\nd the predacon IFF signal, =E2=80=9CCould help you with\n&gt; locating the ship=\r\n and finding survivors.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking back at TUSCON and then LORD =\r\nELDER as well as a few others LEO\n&gt; intoned. =E2=80=9CDoes anyone have anyt=\r\nhing else to add before I dismiss the\n&gt; meeting?=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nreston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
