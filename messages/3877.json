I&#39;m new and for the next four days I&#39;ll be introducing my chars.\n\n\n&quot;Hey Stoonbot, isn&#39;t this great?&quot;\n\nRanbis and Stoonbot are two Decepticons fighting in the very first war of \nthe auto-bots and the decepticons. But for one of them, life is about to \nchange.....\n\n&quot;Watch me toats this Auto-bot!&quot; said Stoonbot as he fired 2 missle right at \na helpless AB, &quot;Now you try.&quot;\n\nRanbis jumped into the air and was ready to frie at the auto-bot, but \nsuddenly more of them arrived and they sent Ranbis sprawling. Stoonbot took \nto the skys, and Ranbis went underground.\n\n&quot;Whoo! Sure is dark over here. I&#39;ll walk a bit further.&quot;\n\nAfter a bit of walking, he found the doors to a great chamber. It took all \nhis might, but he pushed them open. And their, standing before him, was The \nMatrix.\n\n&quot;I thought it was just a legend....&quot;\n\nRanbis moved closer.... and reached out to touch it. As soon as he did, he \nfound himself whirling around inside it with many destroyed Auto-bots. All \nof them were deciding how to punsih him. Than the ones that him and Stoonbot \njust destroyed came forward.\n\n&quot;On the other side of the galaxy, there is a war with more sophisticated \nbots from the future. Let&#39;s watch him fight there, in unknown terriotry with \nadvanced technology. Let&#39;s see how he handles there.&quot;\n\nSo it was decided. He was too be sent to the Neo beast Wars. In an instant \nRanbis found himself on a strange looking planet, with animlas and organic \nthings he had never seen before. After awhile of walking, all the energon \nexposure was getting too him, and he was at risk of losing his spark. Just \nthan though, he spotted some type of pod. It seemed that it was too much \ntechnology for such a primitive planet. He hoped into it, hoping it would \nprotect him. It closed shut on him, and a voice began speaking.\n\n&quot;DNA Scanning beggining&quot;\n\nRanbis felt weird changes, as his body was becoming complelty new. Then, he \nbegan to realize what was going on as Ranbis the Decpticon became only \nmemoires and a new more powerful bot was formed. When it was done, the new \nbot hoped out and checked himself out. Large wings. A red neck. He was in \nthe form of one of these animals on this planet. Than, everything was \nrevealed.\n\n&quot;I...I understand. No longer am I a primitive decepticon. I am an advanced \ndescendant of them, called the Predacons. I have merged robotics with \norganic material to create a stronger bot. No, the sparks in the matrix did \nnot suspect this. They thought I would die a cowards death. But now I get to \nfight in an even bigger war. I AM VULIOS THE VULTURE! A predacon, \nthrough-and-through.&quot;\n\nThe newst Predacon spread his wings for the first time and took off to find \nmore of his kind.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
