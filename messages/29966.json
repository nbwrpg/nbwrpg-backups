(considering that my box fills up with an average\nof 30 NBWRPG posts an hour, I&#39;m willing to bet that at\nleast some of you don&#39;t have time to rifle through up\nto 100 messages a day if you only have time to do\ne-mail once or twice a day.). I wouldn&#39;t mind things\nchanging. Maybe a tag system where at the end of the\nmessage everybody puts in parentheses say...(Tag: John\nDoe) or something. Or maybe an Attention system in\nevery subject header, say....&quot;Your Subject Header Here\n(ATTN: Optimus Prime)&quot;. If something is REALLY\nimportant, the subject header could be (ATTN:\nEveryone). \n\nI remember being told shortly after I joined that the\ncurrent system is SUPPOSED to be so everybody has to\ngo through every message. But considering that most of\nthe posts here are one-liners and/or complete drivel\n(that&#39;s not to say EVERY post are one-liners or drivel\nthough), doing that just seems like a Unicron-sized\nwaste of time.\n\n\nAny thoughts anyone?\n\n--- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt;     As much as I enjoy watching pointless arguments,\n&gt; this could drive another \n&gt; wedge between people in the group.  We don&#39;t need\n&gt; that.  Alten, as amusing as \n&gt; the post was, it went beyond the bounds of good\n&gt; taste.  From an objective \n&gt; perspective, Yan probably could have been less harsh\n&gt; but his point was valid.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
