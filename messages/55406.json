His mouth opened dripping venom, &quot;Those maximals are pathetic..yet \nall of our warriors are almost scrap...indeed the power of revenge is \ngreat...we must be ready.&quot; He saw Hy dras in the tank, he turned and walked \ninto the science bay and injected himself with energon. He formed a pocket and \nplaed a few injections so if he was injured it would heal him or partly. He \nsent a telepathic message to Flicker. &quot;Flicker sir, now that you are in \ncommand please come walk with me we have some things to discuss if you would \ndeem it proper.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; SharpClaw helps Destructor to the CR tank, and then returns to KitKat.

I&#39;ll take the second one.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She took a step and fell to her knees, holding her stomach were 4 \n&gt; wounds were leaking heavily.
