Wheels needs me, I can&#39;t just =\r\ndrop &#39;em like a pile of scrap, I can&#39;t. He&#39;s probably the only friend I got=\r\n other than my comrades. And besides, he&#39;s leader material, and if anyone c=\r\nan give glory back ta the Autobots, it&#39;s him. Forget about Rodimus steppn&#39; =\r\nup ta the plate, he&#39;s far too gone now. And I wonder, I wonder what would h=\r\nappen if Tucson was able ta break the hold on Roddie, what will everyone th=\r\nink of him once he came clean again? I sure know what I&#39;d think.. I&#39;d think=\r\n he&#39;s yesterday&#39;s news. Trust him again, yeah, right, over my dead aft I&#39;ll=\r\n trust that guy again. Fancy paint job or no fancy paint job, he ain&#39;t no O=\r\nptimus Prime like Wheels.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thought Rat Trap as he quietly and slowly ma=\r\nkes his way through the vent pipes of the base.\n\nScourge slowly walked down=\r\n the corridor nearest to Rat Trap&#39;s\nposition, the small cannon mount on his=\r\n head extending a red beam that\nplayed itself along the wall. &quot;I sense you =\r\nRatling.&quot; Scourge hissed in\nlow tones. &quot;You are behind the walls, cowering =\r\nwhere you think we\ncan&#39;t get you.&quot; His voice is deep and soft, almost as if=\r\n he were\ntalking more to himself then to Rat Trap - and perhaps he was. He\n=\r\nsnickered quietly.\n\nCyclonus followed Scourge a few steps back, allowing hi=\r\ns more adept\ntracker take the point on this one. For his own sake he kept h=\r\nis\noptics on full, watching the walls and cieling as well as the floor\nahea=\r\nd, you never know where the next Maximal would appear - they\nseemed to be j=\r\numping out of the very walls today.\n\nScourge suddenly came to a stop as he =\r\nlooked at a section of wall, one\nthat to the casual observer didn&#39;t look an=\r\ny different than any other,\nbut for him it brought a smile. He glanced back=\r\n at Perceptor and\nCyclonus and then back at the wall. He oriented his rifle=\r\n at the wall,\nand with a precisely targeted disintegration blast, fired at =\r\nRat\nTrap&#39;s position through the wall!\n\nOOc: Scourge is being careful to tar=\r\nget only Rat Trap, and not\nanything important like circuitry! :)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPr=\r\neston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge)\n\n"}}
