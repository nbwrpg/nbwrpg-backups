I \nreally think that if we work together, we can make the Alliance the \nmost powerful faction on this rock!&quot; Composer said with enthusiasm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Symphony woke up, lifting his head off of the control room \nboard.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Ugh, I must&#39;ve fell asleep.  I&#39;m bored.  I&#39;m going to \nexplore the land, see what I can find,&quot; He said, walking tiredly \noutside.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Symphony walked through a forest.  He was quite a ways from \nthe CF now.  He still felt a little tired, so he sat against a tree \ntrunk, and laid his little music playing device beside him.  \nListening to music helped him greatly to feel relaxed, and get some \nshut-eye.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Decapitron was now slowing down, as he was under Condor.  \nHe rolled down the window on Legtrap&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Legtrap, see if you can trap that Maximal!!!&quot; He commanded.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Legtrap nodded.  He sort of stood, half his body out the \nwindow.  Then, he got out a special gun.  He fired a big energon net \nup at Condor, in attemp to bring the bird Maximal down.  Meanwhile, \nHeadshot sat comfortably, awaiting orders from Decapitron before \ndoing anything.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Gutclaw picked up the Decepticon distress signal.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Explobody, let&#39;s go towards that signal!  If it&#39;s some \nDecepticons, we welcome them, if it&#39;s a trap, we slag any bots \nthere,&quot; He yelle up to Explobody.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Explobody nodded, as well as a mechanical bird can, and \nthen flew off towards the signal.  Gutclaw followed, running fast in \nmechanical leopard mode, looking back to see if any of the other \nDecepticons were coming.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Skullgrin recieved the Decepticon distress signal as well.  \nHe went off towards it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;         Triggerhappy picked up the distress signal from Africa.  He \nbacked off from Angel Prime, and landed then transformed to robot \nmode, with Blowpipe in his hand.  He opened his com to Cyclonus.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Cyclonus, are you getting that distress signal?  \nSkullgrin and the two newbies(Bodicons)look like they are going after \nit.  What should we do?&quot; He asked.\n\n\n"}}
