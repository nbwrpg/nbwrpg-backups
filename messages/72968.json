Once the garlic begins to sizzle, lower the heat =\r\none notch on the stove.

Once t=\r\nhis is done, drop it into the skillet and turn occasionally.\n\n5: As the chi=\r\ncken cooks, prepare a handful of fresh sage, and add it to the chicken when=\r\n it begins to have a light golden color.  Also re introduce the garlic and =\r\nadd salt, and lemon juice.  Saut=E9 until golden brown.\n\nAnd then..  ENJOY.=\r\n  ^^\n\n\n"}}
