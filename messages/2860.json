Dracona pointed to herself and then smashed\nher fist into her hand while growling. Plintissa nodded to her, some\nlanguage only understood by the People&#39;s Group.\n\nOutside, the Radicons were invited inside the base by Plintissa, but they\ndidn&#39;t know what to do, they were never invited anywhere and were exited.\nThe Radicons walked past the autoguns, relived that they didn&#39;t fire, and\nwalked into the war room. Most of the Radicons were very pleasd to see Liono\nPrime and were exited, but Stranato could care less, he just nodded to Liono\nas the Radicons all sat down.\n\nSinesis and sinister would not come into the base even though Plintissa had\nasked them to. Sinesis jumped into the lake for a swim. Sinesis had pulled\nSinister with him, and that&#39;s when Sinister realized that he was a\nprehistoric scorpion that could breath underwater. Another advantage for the\nbrothers.\n\n&quot;We shall soon rule the maxiand the Alliance and bring them to the mercy of\nthe Predacons!&quot; Sinesis said.\n\n&quot;But don&#39;t forget, even the Predacons are threats!&quot; Sinister pointed out.\nSinesis nodded ann they lay in wait in the lake...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 3:12 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked over at Prowl as she heard his concern about her\ninjuries, i being expected had lessened the annoyance in which she felt when\nhe had finally said it.\n&gt; She really didn&#39;t care if she was injured but knew that if she didn&#39;t go\nand repair she would then end up getting raged on by Prowl that it was the\nbest thing for her, so there was no real choice other then to give in.\n&gt; Iron Raptor growled at the fact of being defeated when it was only common\nsense to be worried about her, but when she heard Striker suggest that they\njust both get repaired and then meet later it was a bit better of a\nsuggestion.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh, alright.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She hated the fact that she was forced to postpone solving Ramhorn&#39;s and\nPlintissa&#39;s problem but she really hated to see Prowl worry about her and\nhated just as much to HEAR him worry, his comments on her needing repair but\nalso not thinking that he needed to as well.\n&gt; But then to add a bit of a light side to the predicament she decided to\ncast the pain away from her thought as best she could and force a slight\nsmil...as well as a mock sly look on her face.\n&gt; She then looked straight at Prowl so he would get the point.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But only if we share chambers...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * The comment was ment as nothing more then a joke to lighten the\natmosphere, but if Prowl took it another way...she had no problem with\nthat.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
