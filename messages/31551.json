A thin strip of his metal was ripped away,\nlike peeling dead skin of a cut. He snarled in pain. He looked down, and\nhis eyes were glowing red now. &quot;Grrrrrrr, I dont know how you managed to\nlive this long Autobot, but today is your last day,&quot; he threatened, soaring\nupwards, and firring from his horns, to continues streams of electricity.\n\nSinnertwin had too many targets to pick. He looked around like, and\nconfused. He then noticed the Autobot First Aid, staying away from the\nfight. &quot;We hunt&quot; one head yelled, then the other snapped at it, &quot;No I hunt&quot;\nhe shrieked. Sinnertwin leapt forward, and broke out into a run towards\nFirst Aid, firing three blasts of continues fire, on from his cannon, and\nthe others from each mouth.\n\n\nHeadstrong stopped when he notice the robot he was charging leave. He\njumped, and dug his feet into the ground, stoping himself, while tearing up\nfresh dirt. He spun around, 180 degrees, and saw Streetwise firing on\nTantrum. &quot;*Snort* Didnt know there would be AUtobots here&quot; he said, as he\nfired two laser blasts at the former Autobot.\n\n\n\n"}}
