Your life should be as you intended, and not what others have \nintend=\r\ned for you. It boils down to freedom. You have the chance to experience \nfr=\r\needom. If I were you I&#39;d take that chance now. As a matter of fact, Sco=\r\nrponok, \nScourge, what seems to be holding you two back here, when you your=\r\nselves can be \nyour own individuals as Decepticons? Does Hydras have you on=\r\n some sort of leash? \nI see no such restraints so that means if you want fr=\r\needom you should also take \nit.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night Shift could see what Tuc=\r\nson was up to. It was one of his \nthinking outside the box kind of strategi=\r\nes. And a strategy that would benefit \nall and not just one faction. Tucson=\r\n was trying to break new ground, and as \ncrazy as it all looked, he sits ba=\r\nck to watch it all take place. Tucson Prime \nnow steps asside and waits to =\r\nsee if any of them either try to destroy him, or \nactually agree with what =\r\nhe was trying to tell them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Whatever any of you \nchose, your d=\r\necision is your own and I will not interfere. We may not be allies, \nbut I =\r\ndo respect the need for one&#39;s free will. But if you attack me, do not \n=\r\nexpect me to be so forgiving.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Preston \nC=\r\narroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight \nNo=\r\ndded, she stood up with fear in her face. she was ready to follow \nRodimus&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rodimus tapped his code on the door and it slid open. \nHe =\r\nstepped out&lt;br&gt;&gt; of the chamber and looked around for a moment.
