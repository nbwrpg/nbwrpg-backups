Rodimus and even Cyclonus fell under\nthis clause. However as we have so many G1&#39;s floating around is it\npossible that you can think of another way for him to get here?\n\nAnimated Ratchet is supose to be old and I think it was hinted that he\nis old enough to be the original Ratchet.\n\nI do have a question. You already have Night Shift, Quickstride, Rat\nTrap, Straight Shot, Tucson, and Uproar, why the sudden interest in\nRatchet?\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\nOn 7/9/11, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone was playing Ratchet at all?  If not I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; mind\n&gt; Playing him.  Tucson&#39;s personality almost matches Ratchet&#39;s and yes I have\n&gt; watched all the G 1 episodes to know about how Ratchet worked.  No known as\n&gt; the most sociable mech but he is dedicated to his faction and his work.  Let\n&gt; me know if that&#39;s okay with you guys\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
