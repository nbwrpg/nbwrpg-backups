Matrix\n&gt; energy conflicts with Pit energy. Just as Chaochitan energy(the\n&gt; energy Infecticons are created from) conflicts with both of those and\n&gt; vice versa. Each used on the other has devestating effects. However\n&gt; vey few robots have the ability to draw dimension from any of the\n&gt; dimensions. Iron Raptor and Liono Prime are the only two I know of\n&gt; that can draw Matrix Energy other then Zero. And the Infecticon\n&gt; Enforcers are the only chars that can draw energy from the\n&gt; Chaochitan. There are no Pit energy drawing preds in this RPG thus\n&gt; far...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
