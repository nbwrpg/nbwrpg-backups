Weather he was talking about the intruder\n&gt; or\n&gt; the defenders at the door it is difficult to tell. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a thought Myrmidon shifted form assuming his avian mode and\n&gt; followed. While he was smaller, about the size of a large eagle, he\n&gt; was\n&gt; outfitted with boosters amd missile launchers. He fired the former as\n&gt; he pursued Malice into the base as he primed the latter, ready for\n&gt; what\n&gt; would come next. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Malice wound his way deeper into the base, Mymidon followed, his\n&gt; sensors taking in the residual heat signature and exaust output. Even\n&gt; for one without sensors Malice wasn&#39;t difficult to follow - the\n&gt; sounds\n&gt; of internal defences attempting to capture or kill him was a finger\n&gt; pointing directly at him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Arriving at the door just after Malice entered his hidey hole of a\n&gt; room, Myrmidon smiled. &quot;Good, you have trapped yourself. There are no\n&gt; other doors here.&quot; He nodded as he heard the bulkheads dropping down\n&gt; in\n&gt; different part of the base. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Computer!&quot; Myrmidon crossed his arms over his chest. &quot;Erect a\n&gt; maximum\n&gt; strength forceshield around ante cabin 447 and deactivate power.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ((OOC: Airly, you will have to let me know if that works.))\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- xochitla2006 &lt;xochitla2006@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfortress/Perceptor:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The black fortress alarms started to rang and warn about the \n&gt; &gt; intruder.
