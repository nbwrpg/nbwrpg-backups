One, I&#39;m going to keep \n&gt; all of the trippa, bropo, and tropo factions together, because you \n&gt; never post, and I haven&#39;t heard anything about them, ever. (before \n&gt; now, though i admit, i might have missed a post concerning them, if \n&gt; there was one) Two, Cyber city just suddenly appears? I know you \n&gt; posted about it being started or something, but i haven&#39;t seen any \n&gt; posts of them working, or of it being completed IC (not OOC, that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t count). Three, there was no attack. (as Azure suggested in \n&gt; his reply to this post).\n&gt; \n&gt; zzZzZZZZzzz It&#39;s much too late to be posting, oh well. =&#92;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; hi . rauq for the bases the trippa are at  minsk, belarus. tropo -\n  \n&gt; olso, norway. bropo- copperhagen, sweeden.  the trippa,bropo, and \n&gt; tropo are on the char page as one faction fix it please. oh yeah \n&gt; cyber city is completed finally!!!! they had a few problems like \nthe \n&gt; bropo/tropo attack\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cybers Will Rule.
