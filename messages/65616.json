We have pi=\r\ncked up an signal of a bot\n&gt; &gt; within the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; city. We were unable to det=\r\nect its affiliation. Approximately 4\n&gt; &gt; hours ago,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bot charged o=\r\nur shields, but eventually gave up. We have\n&gt; &gt; reason to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe it =\r\nis loose in the city right now, and I don&#39;t believe\n&gt; &gt; Atlantis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poli=\r\nce forces are capable of combating something like this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfort=\r\nunately we did not get a picture of the bot, however \nseeing\n&gt; &gt; as it\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; attacked our base, I think we need to handle this with great\n&gt; &gt; caution.=\r\n We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to be caught off guard. For now, we need to capture\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; this bot and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bring it back to our holding cell through the undergro=\r\nund \nentrance\n&gt; &gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Nightlight, si=\r\nnce you are not officially members of\n&gt; &gt; our group,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you may choose w=\r\nhether or not to join us, however the rest of \nyou\n&gt; &gt; need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gear u=\r\np and be ready for this mission immediately after this\n&gt; &gt; briefing ends.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before I continue, do you wish to join us Rodimus?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; :=\r\n:Rodimus::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus: I&#39;ll gladly join you, however request that =\r\nNightlight\n&gt; &gt; stay behind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and watch over Elita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lord per=\r\nseus turned to Nightlight\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do you wish to stay behind?&quot; he aske=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
