He had attacked me earlier, him\n&gt; winning the fight.  Upon Suukie&#39;s arrival, Suukie ignored the pleads,\ngripped\n&gt; Stinkbomb by the throat, then threw him back to the ground.  Stinkbomb\nthen\n&gt; opened fire, obviously confused, unfortunately so did Stuukie, and they\nboth\n&gt; fell.  I then left to the CR chambers, crawling.  When I got out and got\nsome\n&gt; weapons from the armory just in case, I came to find Suukie opening fire\non\n&gt; an unconscious Stinkbomb.  Afraid for my friend&#39;s life, I opened fire on\n&gt; Suukie, who had somehow been repaired from powerful laser blasts to the\nhead,\n&gt; then that weirdo,&quot; he said, referring to Plintissa, &quot;came in and &quot;rescued&quot;\n&gt; him.  Helping him escape justice.  Justice not being killing him, I was\n&gt; trying to knock him down so I could try and restrain him.  And I&#39;m sorry\nif I\n&gt; got confused, but  when arriving here, there weapons drawn, and facing\nyou,\n&gt; and that other person, I jumped to the conclusion you two were under\nattack,\n&gt; ma&#39;am.&quot; he said, pointing to Zenyak (not knowing he was a Predacon), still\na\n&gt; little amazed at the ginormous beast mode.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/960161534/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
