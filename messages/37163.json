Make sure the civilian areas are \nsecured with IGL soldiers before we arrive.  There are anti-IGL terrorist \ncells still in the civilian areas, despite our attempts to eradicate them.  \nAlso have our top engineers look over the ships systems, every circuit.  When \nwe get to this...Past Earth...no doubt there are some nasty characters afoot \nthat may want our technology.  We can&#39;t allow that.  Then if there is still \ntime, have as many volunteers as possible get into space suits, if needed, \nand help polish the outside of the Otyebis.  We want to impress those \nCybertronians on Earth.&quot;  \n\n"}}
