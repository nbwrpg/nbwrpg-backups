He quickly dimed\nhis\n&gt; optics as his head rushed. He groaned deeply. Besides the pain in his\nhead,\n&gt; he wasn&#39;t in a very comfortable position. He leaned over, and nearly lost\n&gt; his balance, despite being seated. He put his legs out to the side which\n&gt; made things a little better.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tarnation,&quot; he mumbled while opening his eyes again. He saw Stingtra and\n&gt; KitKat. He struggled to stand up and get his balance. He stepped out\nleaned\n&gt; heavily on the side of the chamber. He held his head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ah got th&#39; worst headache and ah&#39;m dizzy,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Tired too.&quot; he\n&gt; added. He felt like he was going to pass out. &quot;Ah&#39;m gonna lie down.&quot; He\n&gt; walked off into the main section of the room.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
