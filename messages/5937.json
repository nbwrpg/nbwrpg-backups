He \nfigured \n&gt; that she couldn&#39;t swim because anybody who has swam has loved the \nwater and \n&gt; wants to again (CyberShark only knew swimming bots, and I am a \nswimmer on a \n&gt; team). He neared the ocean and transformed to Beast Mode. He let \nhimself fall \n&gt; toward the ocean. When he hit it felt wonderful to be back. He swam \naround \n&gt; for a few minutes and then headed toward shore.\n&gt;     Nearing the shore he transformed back to robot mode so he \nwouldn&#39;t get \n&gt; beached. He walked out of the water and sat on the beach. He looked \nat his \n&gt; tail/hand, it was useless for swimming in robot mode. But he could \nmanage to \n&gt; teach someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; (In reality I haven&#39;t taught anyone how to swim, I&#39;ve just helped, \nso bear \n&gt; with me.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
