I know I \n&gt;&gt; will be able to do this, and if any harm comes to me, then nothing will \n&gt;&gt; be held against any of you but myself. I will take full blame for what \n&gt;&gt; happens. In Primus&#39;s speed my friends, in Primus&#39;s speed. Good will \n&gt;&gt; prevail, and the light will remain forever lit. Now, let&#39;s do this before \n&gt;&gt; we lose him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He lies still to await hookup.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon nodded as he he gestured for Legacy to begin connecting Tuscon\n&gt; to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is alien technology that is affecting Rodimus.&quot; Bump spoke up\n&gt; from his position next to Tuscon. &quot;We do not know what will happen or\n&gt; how this will affect you or Rodimus. Be very careful.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon pointed to a seperate scanning module, &quot;We will be watching\n&gt; your spark signature as well. If it should dip into critical levels we\n&gt; shall pull you out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He is ready.&quot; Legacy said as he connected two thick cables and\n&gt; several smaller ones to Tuscon&#39;s power module.\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon nodded again, &quot;Begin.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *    *    *    *    *\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Outside in the observation room, it doesn&#39;t take Straight Shot long to \n&gt;&gt; see what is going on. But deep down she knew he was doing the right \n&gt;&gt; thing, she felt it too. Night Shift could also feel what his comrade was \n&gt;&gt; up to, and a feeling of absolute positivity comes over him as well. \n&gt;&gt; Quickstride, however has the same feelings as Noctorro and Bump. But Rat \n&gt;&gt; Trap holds onto the positivity that Straight Shot and Night Shift share \n&gt;&gt; as well as Silverbolt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; I know wheels, he&#39;s gonna make it, I know he is. Somethn&#39; inside me \n&gt;&gt; tells me so and that doesn&#39;t happen too often.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot looks to him, and holds his hand.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You feel it too, so do I. He can do this, I know he can. Silverbolt&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; right, he can do this. We have to believe he can. It&#39;s our belief in him \n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s gonna make him pull through.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift keeps a finger crossed as he stands next to Silverbolt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You feel it too, huh Silverbolt. That deep down feeling that no matter \n&gt;&gt; what happens, good is gonna prevail. It&#39;s real guys, it&#39;s real. Tucson \n&gt;&gt; Prime&#39;s got somethn&#39; inside him that I can&#39;t explain but it&#39;s there and \n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s gonna work.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Just think, we&#39;ll have two Primes plus Lord Elder, and Lord Perseus on \n&gt;&gt; our side. That&#39;s really gonna put a damper on lizard lip&#39;s day. Ohh yeah, \n&gt;&gt; when we&#39;re all back tagether, look out, because that golden age is just a \n&gt;&gt; few shots away.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot listens to him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; And then maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll have something to celebrate.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Silverbolt continued to watch the operation through the glass, his\n&gt; face lightly reflected in the glass was thoughtful as his optics took\n&gt; in the scene. &quot;We will be victorious, because have to be.&quot; he said as\n&gt; his own hand clamped down. He was a soldier, a knight, who was ready\n&gt; to do battle, and yet there was nothing to battle. He felt helpless.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet none of that was on his face as he looked back, &quot;Sometimes all we\n&gt; have is hope.&quot; he said his voice confident. &quot;No doubt Hydras is also\n&gt; using this time to consoldate his black army for what ever evil scheme\n&gt; he has in mind.&quot; He smiled, &quot;But we shall be ready for him, with all\n&gt; of our combined might.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back at the operation as Tuscon was being connected, &quot;We\n&gt; will be waiting for you when you return.&quot; he said, his voice low.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
