There were only two references to weapons having a \npower supply limit at all (The Revenge of Bruticus and Five Faces of \nDarkness), and both were under very extreme circumstances.\n\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Whee... time to kill two birds with one stone. Dinobot wasn&#39;t \nusing \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; energy weapons during coming of the fuzors instead he was using a \n&gt; hand \n&gt; &gt; blaster and a shotgun laser blaster type thing. Because of this \nhe \n&gt; ran out of \n&gt; &gt; ammo. Also the weapons couldnt be solar charged because then they \n&gt; would have \n&gt; &gt; to be outraegeously used to charge and power the weapon. And if \n&gt; there were \n&gt; &gt; solar cells then there would have been power to power the weapons \n&gt; at night \n&gt; &gt; since what kind of idiot wouldn&#39;t have solar batteries that took \nin \n&gt; some of \n&gt; &gt; the energy to operate the weapon at night. This still doesn&#39;t \n&gt; explain why \n&gt; &gt; they faught at night either. Face it they needed ammo and they \ndid \n&gt; run out of \n&gt; &gt; it at times and in G1 they also ran out. Don&#39;t deny simple facts \n&gt; such as \n&gt; &gt; these because you feel you can&#39;t RP without firing 40 shots in \none \n&gt; post at an \n&gt; &gt; enemy.\n\n\n"}}
