She might have to call upon her guns soon and that \ncalled for a transformation. Though she was more eager to get home then \nfight it out with Instrat.\nCarnage glanced over her shoulder towards Teltoli and flashed her a look \nwhich spoke that it wasn&#39;t wise to act too haisty, they had plenty of time \nto beat this bot if it came down to it.\nShe then turned her head back only to find herself nose to snout with \nInstrat, growing and jerking her head back in irder to focus on her face \nproperly. Once that was done Carnage growled at Instrat, her teeth inches \naway from the fems face, her body not even moving an inch from where it had \noriginally been.**\n&quot; Just hold on here! If you would care to notice that life isn&#39;t perfect and \nno one is perfect either.&quot;\n** Carnage pointed a claw tipped finger towards Instrat.**\n&quot; As I recall a sertain female who was suddenly about to whack my head off \nin a clearing back there just because I was trying to get dinner. Then you \nrealized your mistake. MISTAKE!\nEven YOU make mistakes, just like Teltoli had. So you see, no ones perfect, \nincluding me.&quot;\n** Carnage growled and moved towards the pigs on the ground, throwing them \nonto her back before moving around Instrat with a growl.**\n&quot; Come on Teltoli, we gotta get home.&quot;\n** She would leave their guest to the storm.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
