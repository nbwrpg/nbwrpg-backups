A reborn Dece=\r\npticon remained ever vigilant and observant of all that happened... from af=\r\nar. Eager to surprise some of the occupants. \n\nCrimson optics flashed upon =\r\nreceiving data that her old opponent and archrival Elita-One still function=\r\ned... and was here upon this very world. A deep animal-metallic gurgle-grow=\r\nl eminated from her as she took note of the last location of Elita. \n\n&quot;So,&quot;=\r\n she began softly. &quot;You&#39;ve managed to escape the throws of the Abyss, have =\r\nyou.&quot; Baring her razored metallic teeth, &quot;Not for long, to be sure of that!=\r\n&quot; she hissed maliciously. \n\nA clawed finger touched another &#39;button&#39; on the=\r\n console and another holographic visual appeared of Hydras&#39; signature and s=\r\nignatures of others before they faded out in some vast area of the unknown.=\r\n A dangerous area. \n&quot;Hmmm,&quot; tapping and typing, still nothing seemed to wor=\r\nk. But there was one hint, so very tiny and barely readable of some signatu=\r\nre for but a split moment. \n\nIt appeared she will have to make herself know=\r\nn soon enough. Surprise her former allies and enemies. No one would expect =\r\nher return. \nAnd so, she powered up on an alternative energon that was deri=\r\nved from geo-thermal energy. It was not a delightful as the Cybertronian ve=\r\nrsion, but it would serve it&#39;s purpose very well and was more than tolerabl=\r\ne. \n\nOnce powered up now at full power, she exited the compound, with or wi=\r\nthout MegatronX&#39;s permission. It was time to make her presence here known. =\r\n\nLeaping off a ledge she transformed into a massively majestic Cybertronian=\r\n vessel of destruction... and took to the sky.\n\n\n"}}
