Bringing up a com to all units he yelled: &quot;Fall \nback!&quot;.  putting his arm backwards, he fired a few shots off at Zardus&#39; \nboulder, raising his missile launcher and firing a rocket off at Perndabot&#39;s \npelvis.\n------------------------------\nScattershot flew to the side, a few stray shots catching him in the side, \nyelping, he pulled out another charge, flipping DevilDuer off, he threw the \ncharge down at him.\n-----------------------------\nUnitron yelped from DevilDuer&#39;s shot, firing a single bolt of laser fire at \nthe Alliance member&#39;s left knee.  Laughing as Perndabot slams into a tree, \nhis emerald optic sensors seem to widen as he sees the missile launcher, \nleaping to the left, firing his rocket off at the Alliance base, and a few \nshots off at Perndabot, half of the Alliance member&#39;s rocket collides into \nUnitron&#39;s left side, exploding, sending Unitron into a evil looking twirl, \nUnitron slamming to the ground in pain.  Getting up, Unitron fired his last \nrocket off at DevilDuer&#39;s back, firing off a laser bolt at Zardus, rushing \noff as ordered by Koga Shuko, the owner of Shuko Internation getting up and \nleaping into the air, running into the protection of the foilage.\n-------------------------------\nAnubis, the Jackle-God (namesake, that is), laughs manically as Bloodstrike \nis impaled on his claws, but screams as a swipe from the robot&#39;s sword cuts \noff all of his fingers except his middle and pointed fingers.  Growling \nmadly, as mech-fluid shot out of his cut off fingers like a small oil gusher, \nhe stretched his remaining fingers apart as best he could, stabbing his two \nclaws at Blood&#39;s optics (one for the left optic, the other for the right).\n------------------------------\nHades, firing off a few laser blasts at an autogun, fired a missile off at \nthe Alliance base, only having two left.  Seeing Koga Shuko pinned, he fired \na rocket off at Zardus&#39; back, firing his remaining rocket at Bloodstrike&#39;s \nleft side.\n\n"}}
