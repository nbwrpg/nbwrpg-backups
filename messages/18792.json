Oh, ah, My name \nis Squizzy. What&#39;s your&#39;s?&quot;  She knelt dwn and took the bot&#39;s arm.  \nShe then stood to help the bot walk.  Squizzy used all her might to \nget this bot into the ship. She was over joyed to have another bot to \ntalk to other than that Lady Hawk. Lady Hawk wasn&#39;t really a bad bot, \nbut her attitude was getting on her nerves. And she could only go so \nlong with the nice and fluff routine.  She helped the bot towards the \nlab and to the CR room.   She carefully set the bot into the \nCR. &quot;Just get better.  Our leader will want to talk to you when you \nget out.&quot;  She smiled and then closed the door.  She turned on the CR \nand then sat down.  She had used every once of her energy to get that \nbot to the cr.  Thought Squizzy was small, she was tough.  Well...to \na point.\n\n\nKitKat::\nShe was rather pleased with how the talks went.  She felt that \nperhaps, with luck from the matrix, that this could really happen.  \nThe uniting of the Predacons.  She felt like this was the start of a \nnew rain for the Predacon Empire On Earth. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Nighteyes looked to Squizzy, &quot;Thanks...my leg, its killing me. \nI need a \n&gt; CR chamber right away...cough cough..&quot; She said as mech, mixed with \nher \n&gt; siliva splattered on the doorstep.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia sipped her glass from the toast, stood up, and followed \nher \n&gt; escourt out. &quot;I think this meeting was a success. Together, the \nPredacons \n&gt; will dominate this rock.&quot; She said, and giggled.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron and Hell Beast both leaned closer t othe screen tring \nto get a \n&gt; better look at what they were reciving. The picture was blurry, and \non top of \n&gt; that what ever it was looking at was to dark to make out.\n&gt;     &quot;This had better work, Megatron, if we get caught-&quot; Hell Beast \nsaid in a \n&gt; displeased tone. He wasnt very perceptive to this newest scheme, \nand the risk \n&gt; was high.\n&gt;     &quot;-It will work! And if it dosent then we can abort. No harm \nwill come to \n&gt; us, yesss.&quot; He said with a big dumb smile on his face. It was his \ndea, nad he \n&gt; was going to follow it through, even if Hell Beast didnt like it.\n\n\n"}}
