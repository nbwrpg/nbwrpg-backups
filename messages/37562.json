He\n&gt;transformed to his full wolf mode and raced off after the other bot. He\n&gt;rounded the corner as Grizzltron set the second bomb. &quot;Grrrrrrrrrrrr&quot; he\n&gt;snarled as he put his head down and dove full force at the bears back.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
