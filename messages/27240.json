The \nshots that are being shot in this battle would fall into the 4-shot \nmax category. My next post will be about that.\n\n::Killfest/EndBringer/Scyther/Incarcinator/Prowl/Greven/Demise::\n\nKillfest flips backwatds from the explosion of Firearm&#39;s charge \nagainst his back. He recieves Astroblast&#39;s transmission and spins \naround, flying toward the shuttle-bot.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m ready to leave,&quot; he says into his comm, boosting toward \nAstroblast with Firearm in pursuit. He was quickly losing the Maximal \nbacause Firearm had to deal with avoiding the Energonians&#39; gunfire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer manages to stabalize himself in space, flying toward \nAstroblast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther stops in midflight, recieving an order from Killfest to \nretreat. He activates his comm.\n\n&quot;Pinsir, Incarcinator, meet me back at the shuttle, we&#39;re getting out \nof here,&quot; he says into the comm, boosting back toward the shuttle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator growls, continuing to try and crush Prowl in his grasp. \nThe Maximals armor was very strong, but that didn&#39;t stop Incarcinator \nfrom continuing to try to squeeze Prowl to death. He feels Prowl&#39;s \npalms pushing on him to try to get him away, but the Maximal had no \nchance of success with just pushing. Incarcinator recieves Scyther&#39;s \ntransmission and activates his commlink to reply.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m just a bin b-&quot; is all he could say before two plates slide aside \non Prowl&#39;s palms, Bluestreaks daggers shooting out and passing into \nand all the way through Incarcinator&#39;s torso, crossing somewhere \ninside him and emerging from his back. His grip on Prowl fails, the \nbot choking on some mechfluid and going into stasis lock.\n\nProwl pulls the daggers out of Incarcinator, boosting off back toward \nthe battle and leaving the stasis-locked bot floating toward earth.\n\n&quot;Thanks, Bluestreak,&quot; he says, looking back at the four streams of \nmechfluid emerging from Incarcinator&#39;s body.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven and Demise also recieve Killfest&#39;s transmission, but their \nshuttle had been destroyed when they arrived. Grimmler turns, flying \ntoward a Predacon shuttle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise stabalizes in the air, also flying toward a Predacon shuttle \nupon recieving Killfest&#39;s orders.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: yah... 25 shots everytime is way extreme even if it is with in \nthe rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; Astroblast having transformed into shuttle mode already, opens \n&gt; a comm-link to Killfest and EndBringer, &quot;Looks like a retreat this \ntime, \n&gt; are you coming?&quot; He swoops towards Motormaster catching him in \n&gt; his hatch.\n\n\n"}}
