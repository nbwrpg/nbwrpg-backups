It passed around the\nship one time, dipped a wing in salute and then continued on its way\nback towards the ARK.\n\nChecking his gear NIGHTSHIFT notes that his short ranged probes are in\nfull working order and he had a few, enough to check over small things\nor areas relatively quickly.\n\n(OOC: Small meaning locks and machines smaller than a breadbox)\n\nAs for the rest of his recon equipment and devices, everything was\nworking well. He had the standard fare for a recon officer.\n\nOn the console in front of WINDLORD the sensors were displaying that\nthe protohumans had went back into their village and were going about\nthe everday things of life. Some were milling around in different\nstructures, others were sitting outside running sharp stones over the\ninside of animal skins or perhaps sharpening sticks. Some appeared to\nbe preparing food or cleaning. No one appeared to be doing anything\nout of the ordinary.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
