But her body was to weak by damage and a bit of hunger to respond.\nIt also detected sone sort of sound, first high pitched ( the whistle ) and then scattered other vibrations that were of speech.\nShe shivered again as both her arms were taken hold of, her wings limp against her back as she was hauled upright.\nThe night air was full of chill but her shivers didn&#39;t get any worse, her senses alive but the body not able to repond.\nThe fuzor fembot slowly turned her head to the right and opened her optics the slightest crack, still not able to see before going unconsious.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
