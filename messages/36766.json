Maybe a two hour drive max. I&#39;m not  \nsure where your location is, but if yer in a mountanous \nregion, it&#39;s in a dry valley. If yer elsewhere, Redhot is lying \nexposed. In either case, he&#39;s easy to spot form both ground and the \nair. There does not appear to be a ship, or other means of transport \nand nobody that injured can fly.\n    When you get there, the atmosphere feels charged with energy with \nno known cause. It is VERY NOTICABLE and limited to a few feet around \nRedhot. \n\n    Hope that helps. *Grin*\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n*************************\n\n\n"}}
