Now we must begin this mission. We arrre \n&gt; going to make contact with the three main groupes. Battera, go to \nthe \n&gt; Cybertronian Fire and contact the Maximals. Cybershark, you can go \nto \n&gt; The Predacons. I chose you for this mission because you are the \n&gt; greatest warrior here, and you can get yourself out of trouble. But \n&gt; only fire if you are fired upon first. Soundwave, you can go talk \nto \n&gt; Zardus and The Alliance. Tell them all about this place, where we \n&gt; would just like to talk. Just the leaders, for this first meeting. \n&gt; They may not want peace, but get them to come and hear what we have \n&gt; to say. After this meeting they can make a choice. Battera, The \n&gt; Maximals are having a hard time. I don&#39;t know exactly what, but \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; picked up transmissions signaling somethong towards a kidnapping. \n&gt; Help them in anyway you can. I want status reports at the end of \neach \n&gt; day from all of you, and return here in a week. There we can all \n&gt; discuss how each of the leaders feel about this idea. If it&#39;s going \n&gt; good, we will ask them to come for the meeting. If not, we will try \n&gt; another ploy. I am going to stay here and work on away to get the \n&gt; smaller factions to join us for later meetings. All right team, \nlet&#39;s \n&gt; do this!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
