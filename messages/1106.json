She knew he had his \nreasons, but whatever the reason it was not worth it. It was obvious he was \nin pain, &#39;bots don&#39;t just cough up mech-fluid for the hell of it.\n\nTavatron took a deep breath and calmed herself. She wasn&#39;t angry, just \nconcerned. She crouched beside Dinobot, though he had said he was alright \nshe knew better. She&#39;d seen too many battles not to know when a &#39;bot was in \npain:\n\n&quot;We have to get you to an &#39;R chamber, now.&quot; Tavatron gave Dinobot a look \nthat basically said &#39;if you say no I&#39;ll drag you there myself&#39;. She wasn&#39;t \ngoing to let him continue to battle in this state.\n\nTavatron&#39;s head snapped up when she saw the weapon&#39;s fire coming toward the \nark:\n\n&quot;Oh slag...&quot; Tavatron opened a channel to Iron Raptor:\n\n&quot;Commander, we are under heavy fire. I repeat, we are under attack.&quot; \nTavatron closed the channel and returned her attention to Dinobot. There was \nno way they could get inside the ark without getting blown to pieces.\n\nTavatron sighed inwardly, under normal circumstances she would leave Dinobot \nwhere he was and attack the intruders, but she couldn&#39;t, something was \nstopping her. It was feeling, she just couldn&#39;t leave him, it wouldn&#39;t be... \nhonorable:\n\n&quot;We have to get to shelter. The attackers are heavily armed. We would be at \na serious disadvantage if we remained in the open.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
