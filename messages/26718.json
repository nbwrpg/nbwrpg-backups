I too shall take part in the silence of Sunday. May his soul sit alongside the Lord.)\r\n\r\n** Carnage�s optics were closed but she already knew the shape and shadows of the forest so that they were not needed, with the fresh scent of the morning dew drizzling from the end of wet leafs from plants and the trees above.\r\nThe clouds above the tree line were as white as angel�s wings, moving slowly, always changing shape as they drifted in the direction of upper wind currents. The sun was, just now, appearing over the far mountains to the east where a flock of small birds flew from tree to tree in a cloud of flapping wings.\r\nIt was morning, where all day creatures opened their eyes and natural instincts kicked in to scurry around and find food, others of their kind or new shelters. Where the creatures of the night disappeared into holes in the ground or other dens where they slept away the day only to appear at dusk and then hunt for foods. Nature seemed very simply but it was very complex, even though it didn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure that out.\r\nCarnage heaved a sigh and sat back a bit, opening her optics to gave into the sky and see that it was soon that she would have to wake Teltoli so that they could be well on their way by mid-morning. The pigs would have to be dug and cleaned, one eaten for a morning meal. Then she would have to set Teltoli upon her task before she made her way home with what was left of her catch she had nearly been killed for.\r\nShe had sat there most of dawn just thinking of what task she could get Teltoli to complete in order to prove that she was ready, something that wouldn&#39;t be easy but one that anyone could do if they put their minds to it. After all, there was no point in giving her something a weathered soldier would be able to do when she didn&#39;t even know half the training. That would be sending her to her death. Even though she would be doing things such as that when they were through.\r\nCarnage took in a deep breath of the crisp morning air, still sitting in her spot.\r\nIt would be many years before Teltoli could fight a war and had the knowledge to survive it. What the fuzor was asking for wasn&#39;t just a month long program and would take a total of 11 years to complete if she was a slow learner. If not, then 7 years would be the least.\r\nCarnage had been a slow learner but no instructor had ever tough her, she had had to learn on her own by watching others and making things up on her own to improve those moves so that they were comfortable for her. But she had learned even more when she had gone into company business and actually worked for them, seeing things on the battlefields she hadn&#39;t even dreamed were possible. And so she had learned and trained herself there as well.\r\nLIFE! Was what taught. Not books, not teachers or instructors, nothing but life! Because in life, at times, there were no second chances to make up some test you had missed last week. You did what you did and if it wasn&#39;t done right then you paid the price. There was always a price. But it was mostly paid in wounds that left scars, sometimes even amputated limbs that couldn&#39;t be replaced.\r\nThat was how she had learned.\r\nBut, luckily, that wasn&#39;t how Teltoli had to. But she would make her work, make her know the things she did. IF...she passed the task.\r\nCarnage eased to her feet and looked around before converting into beast mode and moving back towards the large tree where their meals were waiting under.\r\nThe walk was refreshing and she liked it, but even before she broke from the bush and ended up by the tree she knew that Teltoli wasn&#39;t asleep any longer and had climbed the tree. What she was doing up there was her business but would have to be stopped to come down and eat.\r\nShe moved from the forest and moved over to the dirt at the bottom of the tree, not looking up but setting to work on digging up their meals so that they would have full stomachs when she set out in different directions.\r\nIt wasn&#39;t long before Carnage slung the pigs out from their hole and filled it again, turning to look at them and shaking her head.\r\nShe could already see that one was bloated from the moisture that seeped into the ground, ruined, and the other had a hole in it where a beetle had been munching on it through the night. That one could be saved but the other had to be thrown out. Where other creatures could eat it. Nothing was put to waste in the forest.\r\nCarnage ripped a hole in the bloated boar so that blood ran out and would let any hungry animal know that there was meat to be had, tossing it into the forest as far as she could before setting to work on the sow.\r\nThis one would have to be cooked, to get rid of any germs that got into it through the night, slicing off the meat juts below the hole with a claw so that the beetle wouldn&#39;t get any further. Tossing that too.\r\nCarnage looked up at the tree then and spotted Teltoli, sighing and shifting as she looked.** &quot; Get down here and try to find some dry timber so we can eat!&quot; ** she bellowed up at her, and expecting her to move quickly before the wetness of the ground bloated this meal too.**\r\n\r\n( Carnage: I have also given up on Hotmail, since I cannot wait for it to righten itself and I have posts to catch up upon. So my new address is carnage@..., which does indeed work much better. I would like to thank tmrattrap for being the first to post Dinobot&#39;s post for me, and Yanshosh for trying.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
