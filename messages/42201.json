She started to feel some of her internal \ncircuits start to short out due to the heat. Her vision was no help. \nInstead of a thick dark fog, she saw a red and yellow fog.  She \ncursed her situation under her breath.  She fired her weapon one more \ntime, then collapsed to her knees.  The heat was so intence, it was \nalmost unbearable.  Smoke was starting to seep from the joints around \nher neck and shoulders.  She tried to hold on as long as she could.  \nShe leaned up, fired another shot, then blacked out. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Lusbel/Attilla::\n&gt; \n&gt; Luzbel and aTTilla didn&#39;t heard her.
