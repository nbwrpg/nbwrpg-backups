You still live in the swamps?&quot; She \ndidn&#39;t whine, exactly, it was more of a statement.\n\nSuddenly she smiled. &quot;Do you remember that other huge raptor.. Rage, \nI think it was? Boy, I remember that really clearly. She always \nthought I was like a little kid..&quot; She crossed her arms across her \nchest, almost in defence of herself. &quot;Let&#39;s see how much of a kid I \nam now..&quot; She huffed.\n\n&#39;Okay, so maybe I haven&#39;t grown up much. I&#39;m still a spoiled brat.. \nbut at least I learnt some more fighting techniques&#39; She thought \nsilently to herself.\n\nStill being in robot mode, the Fuzor ran her hand along the leaves of \nsome bush leaves. She eyes were wide with an almost childish delight. \n&quot;Earth is so much more.. scenic.. than Cybertron. I mean first of all \nthere&#39;s different colors, not just grey and blue of the cities. And \nthere&#39;s all different types of species of animals..&quot; Her voice was \nawed, as if coming to Earth was a whole new experiance.\n\nThe Fuzor broke out of her stunned gazing &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Carnage, I must \nbe boring you with my babbling&quot; She cast a apologetic look at her \nfriend.\n\n\n"}}
