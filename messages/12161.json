You fool! What in the Pit do you think you&#39;re doing?!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Now she knew, knew that she was a Predacon and one that had to escape\nand\n&gt; get back to the base.\n&gt; And she also knew that Grimmler didn&#39;t love her, thinking that it must\nhave\n&gt; been something that some dolt forced into both of their minds.\n&gt; But there was one thing for sure, she had to get away. AND, if she ever\n&gt; caught the bot who had done this to her he would had wished that he had\n&gt; never come online!\n&gt; With a growl BrightBlade spun towards Smokescreen, her hand still in the\n&gt; cuffs but not really caring.\n&gt; She had to get away, and it seemed as if the only way was through the\nfront\n&gt; door.\n&gt; Without a single glance she sprang for the door, easily side-stepping\n&gt; Smokescreen and running out into the hall.\n&gt; Whether it be quto defences or armed bots, she had to get through them and\n&gt; away from this base.\n&gt; BrightBlade opened her com-link to Perndabot.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Perndabot. I&#39;ll be out in a nano-click. Be ready, you&#39;ll have a few bots\n&gt; to fire at.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * With that she whirled around and scanned, locating the exit to the ship\n&gt; and any other possable escape rouites.\n&gt; She HAD to get out!*\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
