Her ears slowly swiveled forward and became straight again, listening to the tempo and time between each one of his breaths.\nHer head turned to the side so that she was looking at him by her left eyes, judging his stance as her instinct instructed her to.\nZyber then straightened her head out to look at him but kept her head low, the sign of respect and no harm still in her posture.\nShe took a few steps towards him but stopped just in case he took it the wrong way, then raising her head and looking around cautiously.
