Of course it\n&gt; was all in jest but he couldn&#39;t help play the part of a formidable predator.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Excuse me Night Viper but, do you always talk to a Prime in that manner?\n&gt; FYI , my full name is TUCSON PRIME, not tall and scaly.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gives him the draconic grin .\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just so you know for future reference.&quot;\n\nNIGHT VIPER spins around to face TUSCON, he had not been talking to\nhim at the time but about him, but the point stood. &quot;Yes sir, your\nPrimeship, of course.&quot; He saluted him with a smile. &quot;It won&#39;t happen\nagain suh!&quot; He said.\n\nAbout that time BIG CONVOY came out of the tunnel that exited high up\non the hallway&#39;s wall. He landed on the floor, while not nearly as\ngracefully as that of NIGHT VIPER and perhaps TUSCON, but his bulk\nmade little noise as it came down. More of a combat landing, but it\nwas solid enough.\n\nLooking around he glanced at the scene, LONG RACK and the rest loking\nat TUSCON PRIME and NIGHT VIPER, the latter standing at attention\nsaluting the former. He shook his head, &quot;You got the stash ready?&quot; He\nsaid looking over at LONGRACK.\n\nThe tall yet slimly built second officer nodded, &quot;Of course, right\nhere boss.&quot; He said, holding out a rather large case to him. He nodded\nover at TUSCON, &quot;What about the Prime?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll handle it.&quot; CONVOY said as he turned to look at TUSCON.\n\nOpeneing the case there were two missile racks which he carefully slid\non each shoulder, increasing his bulk for a moment before they folded\ninto his shoulders, and he picked up a rather large looking cannon and\nhefted it experimantally. He nodded, satisfied.\n\n&quot;Tuscon Prime.&quot; BIG CONVOY said, emphasising the &#39;Prime&#39; part of\nTUSCON&#39;s name presumably for the benfit of the others, &quot;You need any\nsort of weaponry or armaments before we move on?&quot; He glanced up at the\ngrating they had just come out of, he closed it with the tip of his\ncannon.\n\n&quot;I would suspect they will soon discover our ruse.&quot; He looked at\nTUSCON directly, &quot;I need to know if you&#39;re ready? This is going to get\nreally messy really fast.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
