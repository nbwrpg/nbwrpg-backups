On our way here we saw \nyou, so I know where to go.&quot;\n\nFliq went to Beast Mode and scampered off, still excited about having \nthis much agility. Brix turned to Ramulus.\n\n&quot;So shall we go?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois saw that his attacks weren&#39;t working. He had to use all of his \nmind strength. He locked on Galvatron and entered his mind.\n\n&quot;Hello Galvatron. Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to stop \npeace? Because if you don&#39;t turn around right now, and take your gang \nwith you. This is what will happen.&quot;\n\nVulois showed him a picture of a ship, with every bot in it, leaving \nfor Cybertron. Every bot except Galvatron. He was in the laval pits, \nburing up and melting. Vulois tapped his sense circuts to make him \nfeel the pain of the image, at a x10 rate. He than locked it out with \na huge password that only he knew. It would take Galvatron weeks to \nfigure it out.\n\n&quot;Leave Galvatron. Leave us, and no harm will come to you. Stay, and \nthis will happen. If you go, I will remove the image. But until you \ndo, the pain will always be there. If you kill me, it will not go. \nNOW LEAVE!!!&quot;\n\nVulois snapped back into his body. He had his blasters at the ready, \nwatching Galvatron.\n\n\n"}}
