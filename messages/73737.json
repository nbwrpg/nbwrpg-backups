He co=\r\nuld see the statue not\n&gt; &gt; too far off and the trail that led between the t=\r\nown and the cave and\n&gt; &gt; the town and the mine entrance to the cave.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; From the cave there was the sounds of dim laser fire, it came out\n&gt; &gt; so=\r\nunding somewhat like aggressive crickets as things went back and\n&gt; &gt; forth!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a vague sense of PREDACON in the area but nothing speci=\r\nfic,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps they were in hiding, waiting for the nest moment of attack=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deep behind a small hill, out of optical sight of TUCSON and the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; others the PREDACONS were watching, crouching silently. The humans\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n that DINOBOT shot at had frozen, apparently in fight, that is until\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ney looked up at the hovering form of TUCSON in the air.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They smile=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Covered by underbrush and foliage, they could see him, but they=\r\n were,\n&gt; &gt; at the moment, still hidden from view. However it was obvious th=\r\ney\n&gt; &gt; were planning something,.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suddenly there was a strange sort=\r\n of &#39;THUD&#39;, then some sort of\n&gt; &gt; explosion errupted and the cave and tunne=\r\nl collapsed bringing tons of\n&gt; &gt; rock towards RAT TRAP and PERCEPTOR as the=\r\ny struggled to get out of\n&gt; &gt; the cave!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was nothing from ROD=\r\nIMUS!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a manical grin from DINOBOT then, &quot;Rocks fall,=\r\n everyMaximal dies.  Come, we must complete the rest of our mission now whi=\r\nle they are suitably distracted.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Which was to secure a perimeter and =\r\nthen setup the sensor units for reinforcements to arrive.  Now with the MAX=\r\nIMALS at the nearby ARK hopefully further distracted, they could accomplish=\r\n this without further issue then as DINOBOT&#39;s optics flickered then, signal=\r\nling to the TERRORCONS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even better, the protohumans had scattered now=\r\n, so they would hvae no issues hopefully wtih them acting as runners to ale=\r\nrt the MAXIMALS to their positioning.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
