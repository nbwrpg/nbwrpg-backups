She \nhonestly didn&#39;t like to hide from battle, but she had no choice. The \nmajority of her life lead to hiding, running and fighting for her very life. \nShe charged a little ahead of Carnage.\n\n&quot;Let me approach them first,&quot; she said, then made a limp to her walk, \nputting more appearance to her damage. She had to pull this off.\n\nShe walked closer to the Ark, with her head down, walking to the main \ndoorway of the ship. She had to know by now they could see her.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
