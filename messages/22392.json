Just as black as the rest \nof the suit. All except the silver face-plate which covered her mouth and \nnose.\nNow, if never before, she liiked like a real knight, brandeshing a sword \nover her head.\nHer voice sounding cold  with a twist of brutal sarcasm behind it.\nThe sword held high.*\n\n&quot; What time is it Mr.Wolf?&quot;\n\n* In one fluid movement her body shifted, straining in the armor to make it \nmove faster then it was made to.\nSparks flying up from the joints as she took two very quick steps, armor \nscreeching as she brought the sword down in one fluid stroke.*\n\n&quot; Your time!!!&quot;\n\n* And with that, the blade glew blue for one split second before and energy \nslash was released from the blade, hutting the ground as it sliced towards \nShadow.\nIron Raptors body left in still ness, the blade&#39;s tip touching the ground \nwith her head forward, watching the energy slash heading for her target.\nAll the time thinking...&lt;where the hell did all THAT come from?!!&gt;*\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
