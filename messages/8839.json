She saw a hollow log \nlaying among a small, thick grove of trees.  She crawled into the log \nand curled up.  She put the rat down next to her. She whispered, &quot;Now \nyou stay still my little one, or we may be slagged.  I just hope that \nno one saw me duck in here.  I just hope that I lost them in the \nforest.&quot;  She was fearful that if caught, they would kill her. Or \nworse, kill her pet and then her.  She knew she was a pred, but she \ndidn&#39;t feel much like one. What she did feel, was scared. \n\n\n"}}
