As they grabbed his legs from behind he started to stumble, &quot;Who\nchallenges Menasor&quot; he yells, the voice booming around that area. Then the\nsecond robot grabs him, and he starts to fall forward, &quot;NO&quot; he screams as\nall 45 feet of metalic monster falls forward towards the rest of the\nbattling robots. His body becomes grounded, hitting the earth very hard,\ncausing huge rifts in the earth to go outwards. He lays motionless, close\nto Firearm, and the rest of the battling factions.\n\n\n\n"}}
