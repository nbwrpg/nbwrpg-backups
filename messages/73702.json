He could see the statue not\n&gt; t=\r\noo far off and the trail that led between the town and the cave and\n&gt; the t=\r\nown and the mine entrance to the cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; From the cave there was the sou=\r\nnds of dim laser fire, it came out\n&gt; sounding somewhat like aggressive cric=\r\nkets as things went back and\n&gt; forth!\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a vague sense of PREDA=\r\nCON in the area but nothing specific,\n&gt; perhaps they were in hiding, waitin=\r\ng for the nest moment of attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep behind a small hill, out of opti=\r\ncal sight of TUCSON and the\n&gt; others the PREDACONS were watching, crouching=\r\n silently. The humans\n&gt; that DINOBOT shot at had frozen, apparently in figh=\r\nt, that is until\n&gt; they looked up at the hovering form of TUCSON in the air=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; They smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Covered by underbrush and foliage, they could see =\r\nhim, but they were,\n&gt; at the moment, still hidden from view. However it was=\r\n obvious they\n&gt; were planning something,.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly there was a strange=\r\n sort of &#39;THUD&#39;, then some sort of\n&gt; explosion errupted and the cave and tu=\r\nnnel collapsed bringing tons of\n&gt; rock towards RAT TRAP and PERCEPTOR as th=\r\ney struggled to get out of\n&gt; the cave!\n&gt; \n&gt; There was nothing from RODIMUS!=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\nThere was a manical grin from DINOBOT then, &quot;Rocks fall, everyMaximal=\r\n dies.  Come, we must complete the rest of our mission now while they are s=\r\nuitably distracted.&quot;\n\nWhich was to secure a perimeter and then setup the se=\r\nnsor units for reinforcements to arrive.  Now with the MAXIMALS at the near=\r\nby ARK hopefully further distracted, they could accomplish this without fur=\r\nther issue then as DINOBOT&#39;s optics flickered then, signalling to the TERRO=\r\nRCONS.\n\nEven better, the protohumans had scattered now, so they would hvae =\r\nno issues hopefully wtih them acting as runners to alert the MAXIMALS to th=\r\neir positioning.\n\n\n"}}
