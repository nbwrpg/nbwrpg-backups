He \nwatched the destruction of Megatron, and cried out in joy as it \nhappened. Now their group could be free of his tyrany, and they could \nblossom as a real power under KitKat. But than he began thinking. He \nknew the original Megatron better than anyone. After all, he was the \none who had ended his life the first time. And according to stories, \nthis Megatron was supposed to be even more crafty than the original. \nIt said that he was sentenced to death for his treachery on the Beast \nWars. How he escaped Maximal prisons was beyond him.(I would really \nlike to know that, I wasn&#39;t here when that happened and it would be \ninteresting to see.) Megatron wouldn&#39;t put himself in that much \ndanger, and allow himself to be destroyed so easily. But, he couldn&#39;t \nbe a clone because his pigmentation was te right color. So what went \nthrough Megatron&#39;s head as he was so risky. Starscream went to bot \nmode and walked over to the fallen head of Megatron. It&#39;s face had \ngone blank, and was burned around the edges. He gazed at it, trying \nto find something that would indicate that this is not Megatron.(The \neyes went out so I can&#39;t say that.) Nothing. He looked at KitKat, \ngiving the head to her.\n\n&quot;Here, keep this as a token of our liberation today. But what I was \nthinking is that we could run some tests on it. We may have defeated \nMegatron, but our war with them is far from over. Maybe he&#39;s got some \nback-up files that are still useful about his plans in his head. \nInferno won&#39;t forget this, and Black Arachnia will gladly take \ncommand again and try to defeat us. We need to know everything about \nthem that we can.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Gotron stopped dead in his tracks as he was running back \nto the Alliance base. He had done this mission, but was he really \nneeded at the Alliance? He never really got the glamour missions he \nwas hoping for. But he didn&#39;t want to give up the Alliance. He always \nwanted to join his friend Starscream. He needed an idea. He sent a \ncomm to Wheeljack who was far ahead.\n\n&quot;I won&#39;t be re-joining you at the Alliance base. Tell Zardus that I \nam going to act as a transmitter of messages, sort of like an \nambassador to the new Pred group. When we get information on the war \nagainst Megatron, I will contact him.&quot;\n\nGotron opened a comm to his friend Starscream\n\n&quot;Starscream? It&#39;s Gotron. You there?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, buddy. We just killed Megatron! We&#39;re free! Ain&#39;t that great?&quot;\n\n&quot;Cool. Listen, The Alliance wants to keep close ties with this new \nPred group. We were all wondering if I could come stay with you guys \nfor a bit and relay stuff to Zardus. Is that okay?&quot;\n\n&quot;Hold on. Let me ask KitKat.&quot;\n\nHe turned to her.\n\n&quot;Is it okay if my friend Gotron comes and acts as an ambassador of \nthe Alliance? The group I brought aren&#39;t really Alliance. They are \njust on peace terms with them.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
