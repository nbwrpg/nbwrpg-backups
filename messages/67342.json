Sorry about all the details\n&gt; &gt; not being covered. Basically, I wanted=\r\n to reintroduce an old\n&gt; &gt; character\n&gt; &gt; and have a go at the Minions. Pres=\r\nton, to help you out, Vorpal was\n&gt; &gt; deliberately not fleshed out. He&#39;s a m=\r\nilitary Genius and a tyrant,\n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; little else is known. That&#39;s what =\r\nmakes him scary.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Then I will maintain that secrecy. I will use th=\r\ne trio of minions\n&gt; I sent A-blade&#39;s way for the moment, if that&#39;s okay wit=\r\nh all. I would\n&gt; think that a battle directly with Vorpal would need some d=\r\netails for\n&gt; him if Azureblade is as powerful as he seems? I will be postin=\r\ng\n&gt; hopefully tommorrow, and always I am open to comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (=\r\nDa&#39;minion)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do =\r\nYou Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
