Child flew to the \nmountain and went immediately to the cave with his stuff. he gathered it and \nthen took some of Vulois&#39;s. Then he went to the Book cave. he saw what Vulois \nhad written and cried. When he stopped he garbed the book and flew back to \nthe SkySchorchers (Spelling?):::\n\nchild: &#39;All right guys would you just watch this stuff and make sure no one \ntouches it, its relay important. i will be right back.&quot;\n\n:::Child back to the mountain and screamed at the tope of his lungs:::\n\nChild: &quot;Angle!!! Come here NOW I will kill you in memory if Vulois!&quot;\n\n:::Angel steeped out of a cave and looked right at the 5 year old bot. He \nraised his hands and spoke:::\n\nAngel: &quot;Hello, and good bye!&quot;\n\nChild; &quot;No, good bye to you!&quot;\n\n:::Child took all his power and forged it into a single, sword shaped, bar. \nHe threw it at Angel. The blade slipped into Angels rides penetrating his \nspark:::\n\nAngel: &quot;I...If ...If I have to die then you will come with me!&quot;\n\n:::Angel opened a crag in the earth, but Child dident fall into it. Angel \nfelt life leaving him. All his dark power exiting his body. The pitt \nswallowing his spark whole. Angel died:::\n\n:::Child saw Angel die and flew back to The SkySchorchers:::\n\nChild; &quot;thanks! Now will you come with me, or do you have plans of your own?&quot;\n\n"}}
