Skulletron thought about where\nto go next.  Then suddenly, for a moment, the word Torture was ringing in\nhis head.\n\n\t&quot;No!  No!&quot; Then the ringing stopped, &quot;No! Uh, no place is more important\nthan the torture chamber!  You know, capturing all those Maximals and\nPredacons!  They need to be tortured to even get a word out of &#39;em!&quot;\n\n\tSkulletron had wondered why Torture had come to his head.  Could it have\nanything to do with his past?  Oh well, no time to worry about that.  If he\nwas tormented in the past, he would get revenge by joining the Alliance and\nserving Zardus.\n\n\n"}}
