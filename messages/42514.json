If Ice hadn&#39;t stepped\n&gt; between them the blast would ha=\r\nve hit him. He reached to draw his\n&gt; weapon when Ice rose her wings blockin=\r\ng his shot. &quot;Get down!,&quot; he\n&gt; yelled trying to take aim at the insane bot.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;None of that in here.&quot; Ice yelled equally demanding, &quot;This is a\n&gt; =\r\nplace of peace and it&#39;ll stay that way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Grizzltron wasn&#39;t very hap=\r\npy that thier chat was inturupted. He\n&gt; fealt outnumbered and outgunned. Hi=\r\ns firepower was the only thing\n&gt; seperating him and the odds. Veratis wrapp=\r\ned his large bat wings\n&gt; around the bear bot and used his unseemingly stren=\r\ngth to hold\n&gt; Grizzltrons arms at his sides. &quot;I already warned you once tha=\r\nt that\n&gt; will not be permitted in my home.&quot; The old scientist bit down on t=\r\nhe\n&gt; other bots shoulder draining enough energy to weaken him enough to\n&gt; f=\r\norce him into a CR chamber.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That should give him some time to cool=\r\n down.&quot; Veratis says\n&gt; transforming back to his robot mode. &quot;Now then Muste=\r\nx was it?

She thought about thier times together an=\r\nd had to go\n&gt; with Mustex, She remembered all the times she&#39;d tried to help=\r\n her\n&gt; love and ended up getting herself hurt and in one case nearly lost\n&gt;=\r\n her spark.
