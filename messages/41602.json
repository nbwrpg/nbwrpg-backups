Devil Gigatron knows\n&gt;peace isn&#39;t the answer because of the amount of monkey crap bots on this \n&gt;past\n&gt;Earth. Instead of going around whining and begging every faction of \n&gt;Jabroni&#39;s\n&gt;on this dust ball Devil Gigatron suggests this... Devil Gigatron says that \n&gt;we\n&gt;should cut the crap and lay the Giga-Smackdown on every base on this damn\n&gt;planet. Although apparently something in leadership here seems to be\n&gt;lacking... Devil Gigatron sees you have a mighty big base here, yet, it \n&gt;looks\n&gt;like something out of a slum where Drive bys are frequent! Instead of\n&gt;constantly sitting here asking for peace or something which I believe you\n&gt;Jabronis are doing, you should get get with the program and beat the mess \n&gt;out\n&gt;of other factions before...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Devil Gigatron grins and then transforms into a gigantic hand.\n&gt;\n&gt;Devil Gigatron: &quot;Before Devil Gigatron decides to lay the Giga-Slapdown on\n&gt;you not once(he then holds up only one finger), not twice(now having two\n&gt;fingers up), But Three times!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Three fingers are now raised and point at Iron Raptor before Devil Gigatron\n&gt;transforms into robot mode. He then looks up into the sky with his hands up\n&gt;before he places one up to his mouth while holding a microphone not there\n&gt;before.\n&gt;\n&gt;Devil Gigatron: &quot;If you smeeeellllll what Devil Gigatron.... is cooking!&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
