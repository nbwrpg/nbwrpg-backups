Those bots would never\nbe able to stand up to the advanced technology that the Galactors were\nmade of.\n\n&quot;Galaxor, seperate,&quot; he says calmly, splitting into the five seperate\nbots: Supernova, Flare, Slasys, Vycir, and Scrap. However, before they\nhit the ground they combine again, creating two jets, one consisting\nof Supernova, Scrap, and Slasys, the other one of Flare and Vycir. The\nFlare/Vycir jet cloaks, firing two large grenades down at the\nTerrorcons while the other jet fires two missiles at them, Scrap&#39;s\nrepair system getting to work on the damage that had been delt to\nSupernova while he was part of Galaxor. Both jets quickly gain\naltitude.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;LurkerAbyss&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Cutthroat::\n&gt; \n&gt;      Cutthroat instantly seperated from Abominus, then landed on the\nground and ran beside Hun-Grr.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Maybe other gestalt seperate, and we have small war,&quot;\nCutthroat said, referring to Galaxor.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Alloran2@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 05, 2001 9:31 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Abominus kicks ass...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC: Soulstice, I posted for Abominus two days ago!
