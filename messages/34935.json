Menasor, a little \n&gt; disoriented, swings a large round house punch at Prowl.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Astroblast pulls up, missiles grazing his bottom. He catches one \n&gt; missile with his tractor beam, and turns it around sending it back \nat \n&gt; the jet he can see behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade&#39;s cloaking energy is depleted, he decloaks, and \n&gt; laughs. &quot;Astroblast open your hatch a bit, I&#39;m going to toss some \n&gt; demo packs at the tailers.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Astroblast&#39;s hatch opens up enough or Switchblade to toss something \n&gt; out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade pulls out two antimatter demo charges. &quot;Food for thought \n&gt; stupid jet.&quot; He mutters to himself, as he sets the charges to \n&gt; detonate when they reach the jet that he can see behind. He throws \n&gt; one at the jets behind, waits a second, then throws the other in the \n&gt; same matter. The explosion should deter any further followers.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Rippersnapper growls and grows even more angrier at the \n&gt; word, &quot;retreat&quot;. &quot;Rippersnapper no want retreat, Rippersnapper want \n&gt; destroy Maximal!&quot; lasers from Orion sear his optics, rendering him \n&gt; blinded for a second, the Rippersnapper reluctantly transforms, \n&gt; following Astroblast.
