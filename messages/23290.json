I know, the soft bend\nbefore the strong, right before the strong decapitates them. So be careful\naround the strong willed if your will is weak. You may not believe you have\na weak will sometimes, but just be careful. Some guy thought he&#39;s trick me\none time. He&#39;s dead, his trick didn&#39;t work. I&#39;m strong minded, I don&#39;t fall\nfor stuff. They even tried hyptonizing me. I pretended to by under his\ncontrol, then proceeded to tear him apart. He was weak minded.
