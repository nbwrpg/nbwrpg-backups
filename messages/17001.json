But she had never seen him before and \nwas wary of the new bot. She sniff the air around him and picked up \nthe scent of Maximal from him.  She transformed into bot mde and \nlooked at him, waiting for him to reply.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine approached the Ark, it was still in multiple pieces, \nmostly\n&gt; scattered on the ground. He remembered the scanners and wondered if \nthey&#39;d\n&gt; recognize him. The scanners clicked, beeped and the door slid open, \nhe may\n&gt; have had a new body but Veratis had used the same DNA scans from \nhis old\n&gt; body. Sounds echoed through the halls which made it sound as if the \nship was\n&gt; speaking to him. he heard Ramulus explaining something and decided \nto see\n&gt; what his associate was up to.. It sounded like preperation for a \nbattle,\n&gt; maybe Lunarpine would get the chance to test out his new body after \nall.\n\n\n"}}
