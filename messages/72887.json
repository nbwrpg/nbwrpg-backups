However the optics that\n&gt; GRIML=\r\nOCK turned back on WHEELIE were not the ones of a friend, they\n&gt; were ones =\r\nof a raging monster!\n&gt; \n&gt; GRIMLOCK roared again as he stepped towards WHEEL=\r\nIE his jaws opened wide!\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThis was confirmation enough for WHEELI=\r\nE that something was in control of GRIMLOCK, as if his optics had gone red.=\r\n  All was clear now.\n\nDodging to the side of the sudden smash, WHEELIE went=\r\n to do what he did best.  &quot;I thought GRIMLOCK was strong, but here you are =\r\nplaying to someone else&#39;s SONG!&quot;\n\nDodging at long range, trying to get GRIM=\r\nLOCK off balance, nto yet drawing his weapon, &quot;Here I see you out for play,=\r\n under someone else&#39;s sway!  I thought the DINOBOTS were the strongest of h=\r\ntem all, not playing to someone else&#39;s thrall!&quot;\n\nAt this point, firing his =\r\nsmall energon slingshot with a bolt aimed at GRIMLOCK&#39;s &#39;nose&#39; in recreatio=\r\nn of a long ago event, &quot;And here I thought you were mad, but this is all ju=\r\nst really sad!  I thought I would see you great, not playing to someone els=\r\ne&#39;s skate!&quot;\n\nWHEELIE knew two things - that GRIMLOCK hated doing what anote=\r\nhr told him, and that he got angry very easily.  So WHEELIE was hoping that=\r\n by making Grimlock as ANGRY as the little bot (relatively) could, he could=\r\n help GRIMLOCK shake it off..  OR DIE TRYING.\n\n\n\n"}}
