On my back.&quot;\n\n* She blew on it to cool it a bit before turning towards the bed and walking\nover to it again, sitting at it&#39;s edge and holding cups rip up to the\ncreatures lips.\nZyber tilted her head as she studied the animals features, wondering just\nwhat it could be.but she could never guess. It was everything. *\n\n&quot; Here you go. Drink it lightly and slowly, it is fairly potent. It will\nwarm you up.and begin small repairs of your internals.&quot;\n\n* She waited patiently for him to drink, just hoping that he wouldn&#39;t try\nand lunge out of bed again. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
