He looks at her, as she runs up to him.\n\n&quot;Prowl here tried to help me take on Oblitertron,&quot; he says sadly, holding out \nProwl&#39;s smashed and battered body for Iron Raptor to take. Prowl was in \nterrible shape. His chest plate was smashed in, one of his arms almost \nsevered, and both wings broken. His mech fluid covered both him and Firearm, \nand was now making a puddle on the floor. Circuits were jammed and sticking \nout around his torso. Prowl had stopped breathing by now, and was hardly \nalive.\n\n&quot;I think he&#39;s too far gone for a CR,&quot; Firearm says sadly, handing Prowl to \nIron Raptor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n(Sorry if this is inacurate, but its been a long time since I&#39;ve seen TF: The \nMovie, and my VCR is busted, so I can&#39;t watch it.)\n\nInside Prowl&#39;s mind, a scene was taking place. A scene from his previous \ndeath. He was sitting in an Autobot shuttle, monitoring a screen. They were \nheaded to earth, to Autobot City. Deep in thought, Prowl watches the screen, \nglancing at the Autobots around him.\n\nAn explosion behind shakes him out of his thoughts, followed by a yell. \n&quot;Decepticons!&quot;\n\nProwl gets out of his chair, spinning around and firing a shot at the group \nof Decepticons in the shuttle. His shot misses, blowing up a piece of \nequipment in the back of the shuttle. A yellow bot, one of the \nConstructocons, fires a shot at Prowl, hitting the Autobot in the chest.\n\nProwl&#39;s systems yell at him in pain as Scavenger&#39;s shot hits, overheating \nmost of his circuits. His optic sensors start smoking as Prowl falls to his \nknees, the rest of his body overbalancing and falling as well. Prowl&#39;s optics \ndeactivate, the Autobot dead in a few seconds.\n\n"}}
