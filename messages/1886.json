The only cover they had \nwere the giant tree&#39;s that hadnt been destroyed long ago. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: When we reach your base, I will contact Shredder and \nQuickstrike. \n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Yes...and you can tell your little friend to get out of my \nsystems!\n\n::: Megatron ::: Of course....\n\n::: Jackle glanced behinde him to see Ra, Set, and a dozen battle droids in \npursuit :::\n\n::: Jackle ::: We cant out run them! I say we stay and fight!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Agreed. Ill send out a distress call to Inferno, Tankkor, \nRampage, Mosquitor, Gangon, and Brightblade! Once we capture these pests, the \nothers will fall slowly.\n\n::: They saw an up coming fallen tree. They dove behinde it and began to \nexchange fire. Within munutes several of the weak battle droids were \ndestroyed. But now they could see Ares join the battle. :::\n\n::: Jackle ::: Damn...these guys came to this planet expecting a full out war!\n\n::: Megatron snapped ::: No kidding you flae bitten nusience! Now keep firing!\n\n::: Hell Beast sent out his message. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Pheniox rested in the command chair of the Darkside. Black Aracnia paced \nthe room. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Damn it! I wish I knew what was going \non...communication has been so slow lately. And no Predacons have reported \nback to base recently.\n\n::: Gremlin marched into the room :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Figures your still here.\n\n::: Gremlin said with his gravely voice ::: Silence. If you were paying \nattention, you would have seen that our Commander just called for \nreinforcements!\n\n::: Pheniox ::: We cant leave the ship!\n\n::: Gremlin ::: I can.\n\n::: With that he stormed out of the room, heading for Hell Beast. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Marine and Transanulas, who had left Quickstrike to die in the forest \nwith his own stuborness, saw the battle unfold before them :::\n\n::: Marine ::: My programming says that that figure is Hell Beast, my \ncommander.\n\n::: Transanulas ::: Oh no. Hes an asshole. we won-\n\n::: Marine, with his giant green hand slaped the spider :::\n\n::: Marine ::: That is treason! As your general, I demand you follow my \norders and fight!\n\n::: Transanulas said nothing as he and Marine krept behinde Hell Beast, \nJackle, Megatron, and just arriving, Gremlin. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Who are you?!\n\n::: Marine ::: I am Marine. Your new general. I wish to serve you and crush \nour enemy&#39;s.\n\n::: Hell Beast took one look at the giant turtle bot who seemed strikingly \nsimilar to Rhinox ::: Your hired! Now fight!\n\n"}}
