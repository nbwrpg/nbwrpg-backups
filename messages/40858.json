He pulled up and changed his \ncourse, \n&gt; &gt; heading for Asia and his velocity increasing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He sent out a comm. to everyone who had fought along with the Neo \nCons and \n&gt; &gt; the Neo Decepticons as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Shockwave, we have done sufficient damage here, to \ncontinue would be \n&gt; &gt; a meaningless waste of resources.

He transformed to \nhis biped \n&gt; &gt; mode to keep from leaking to much mech-fluid.  He fired off a few \noptic \n&gt; &gt; blasts down at Starstomp, heading for Asia as he was ordered.\n\n\n"}}
