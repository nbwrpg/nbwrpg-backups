He nods at \n&gt; DrillBit&#39;s request to discuss the matter, and turns from Angel \nPrime. \n&gt; Once he was sure that Angel Prime couldn&#39;t see his face, it relaxed \n&gt; into the look of disgust that showed his opinion of the offer. \n&gt; Killfest didn&#39;t like Maximals. Attacking Hell Beast&#39;s forces and \n&gt; indirectly helping the Maximals was one thing, but allying with \nthem \n&gt; was quite another.\n&gt; \n&gt; He walks up to DrillBit, waiting for Darkfate to join them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He looked to the others.
