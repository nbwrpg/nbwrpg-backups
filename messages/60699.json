A curiosity, \nshe could be a great leader.  He could use someone like her back in \nthe Fleet.\n&gt; &quot;Hydras is a throwback.  A mistake.  He is a combination of \nQuintesson programming and Unicron&#39;s lunacy.  He is no leader.  I&#39;ll \neven go as far as to say he doesn&#39;t even have a Matrix Chamber.&quot;\n&gt; He smirked and brought a hand to the center of his chest, where a \nhighly stylized purple insignia resided.\n&gt; &quot;True Cybertronian Leaders are more capable than he.
