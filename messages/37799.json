The computer was on the\nfritz, the defenses, shields, autoguns, and repair systems were down and ZOE\nwas missing in action.\n\nDrillbit, and Killfests shots hit him hard sending him careening into a\nwall. An explosion rocked the bridge as the fuel tanks started exploding.\nIgnatius forced himself to his feat fireing two talon missles at Drillbit\nand 25 shots from his talons at Killfest and the Destrocons.\n\nThe computer flashed to life once again trying to get control again. The\nshields rose but quickly dissipated as the virus continued to degrade it&#39;s\nsystems. with only one alternative it scanned the room for Ignatius. When\nIgnatius was close enough a surge of power arced from it&#39;s terminal sending\nwaves of power through the Trainer. The computer flashed one more time\nbefore all systems crashed leaving it as a lifeless hulk no more usefull\nthan an overgrown paperweight.\n\nIgnatius felt the surge of power rejuvinate his systems, he was now back to\n100% strength.
