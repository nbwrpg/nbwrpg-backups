Good then. I guess this is the whole of the\ncrew. I&#39;d tell you more about this mission, but not in here. Too many\nears and I don&#39;t trust about all of them. Suffice it to say, your\npaycheck is sitting calmly on the mobile station and you are eligible\nto 3.75% of the profits we make on this operation. The number might\nseem low, but wait for the real thing! Now come along and let&#39;s go\nsomewhere more private.\n\nIronically, he was saying this precise sentence in the precise place\nand to the precise poeple in which circumstances it seemed weird. In\nfact, one of the pleasure bots was saying the same thing to a drunken\nminer who was nearly passed out on the floor. Lucky for her, the guy\nhad already paid her, twice rather than once, drunk as he was.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --Rukus--\n&gt; \n&gt; Rukus&#39;s caught Krhinos and Dracon being a conversation, and stands \n&gt; slowly from his table, setting his drink aside, and brushing off the \n&gt; pleasure bots which were starting to get on his nerves. He almost \n&gt; starts a fight with a drunken tech bot, but decides not to cause a \n&gt; notable disturbance, or ruckus, so early on the journey.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sliding smoothly between tables, he avoids a serving bot, and finds \n&gt; himself next to Dracon and Krhinos with a shot of energin in his \n&gt; hands that he swiped unnoticeably from the serving bot as he passed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Krhinos...&quot; he says softly, then nods to Dracon. &quot;I&#39;m Rukus, check \n&gt; the roster, I signed on late. When do we leave?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ooc: \n&gt; Sorry, didn&#39;t know we&#39;d started posting for this yet, so i missed \n&gt; the queue. I&#39;m here now!

It \n&gt; took\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   him straight at the top stair of the huge space station. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   disembarked and walked into the office of Tycoon, his \n&gt; entrepreneur\n&gt; &gt; boss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Hi Krhinos. Sit down please. You&#39;ve got a new mission!\n&gt; &gt; Energon?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Krhinos: Just a small glass, you know I&#39;m trying to quit... \n&gt; So, what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the new deal? The Tripredacus again?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Not this time. (He poured the liquid energon in two \n&gt; small\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   glasses and handed one to his employee.) They&#39;ve offered great\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   contracts, but they&#39;re ending their invasion soon. They don&#39;t \n&gt; need any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   more ore. (He sipped a little from his cup) This contractor \n&gt; wished to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   remain anonymous, but it&#39;s going to be one of our biggest \n&gt; offer yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Basically, we have been given the mining rights for a whole \n&gt; planet!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Krhinos nearly choked on his energon. A planet! StarDrill Inc \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   become the most profitable company in the whole system!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Krhinos: You serious, Tyke?!? A planet!? Which one just for \n&gt; fun?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon smiled grimly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon: Earth! We have the rights to mine Earth! The human \n&gt; cradle\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   itself! (Seeing Krhinos&#39;s unbelieving face, he held a hand \n&gt; up.) Now,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   now... It&#39;s the prehistoric Earth, not that rebellious \n&gt; headquarter of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   today&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Krhinos: What are we looking for? Iron? Radium?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon: All you can find! You get a full mobile mining base \n&gt; that you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   can keep in orbit, a small outpost on the planet from which \n&gt; you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ship the resources, I&#39;ll even grant you that Mammoth Drill you \n&gt; love so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   much. In short, do your best! Oh... I almost forgot... I got \n&gt; you a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   mercenaries to bring along. They should be in the Mess Hall by \n&gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Take &#39;em along. They&#39;ll help you a lot, it&#39;s on their \n&gt; contract. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   isn&#39;t, just pay them on the company&#39;s account.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Krhinos: Will do, Boss. Thanks a lot! I&#39; make this mission pay \n&gt; up!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   The massive bot stood up, finished his drink in a nano and \n&gt; saluted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Tycoon one last time before going to the Mess Hall. It was the \n&gt; kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   bar where he&#39;d expect anything, from the lowly pleasure bots \n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   drunken brawls. He looked around, trying to find some \n&gt; relatively fresh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   mercs in the crowd...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
