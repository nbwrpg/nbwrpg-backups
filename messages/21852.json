And troops, aim the guns at the rest.\n\nZeni backed away from Deemos. Rizopas ran out, and reached out and grabbed\nhim. Zeni struggled to get free, but then held his hands together and then\nfired a beam of energy that blew Rizopas&#39; head off. Rizopas&#39; head rolled to\nDoom Ice&#39;s feet, all of this happening in a few seconds. Zeni drops from\nRizopas&#39; arms. Deemos ran and swung out with a punch and sends Zeni flying\ninto a large rock as he jumped down out of Rizopas&#39; grip. He fell to the\nground, unconcious. There was a crack on the rock. Gramps is horrified and\ntrembles with fear. Technosis runs to Zeni.\n\nTechnosis: This is all my fault, all my fault.\n\nDeemos: You and me, Aerotaur, one on one, what do you think about it? It&#39;ll\nbe a fair fight, just one on one, fight me, you win and I&#39;ll leave along\nwith my group, here. Mafia, watch the old man.\n\nDeemos stands waiting for Aerotaur to respond.\n\n\n"}}
