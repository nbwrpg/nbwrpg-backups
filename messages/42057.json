The link he had with FZ was very hazy, but the Iron Fist&#39;s optical feed from the outside was as good as ever. Zardus tapping a few buttons, the autoguns rise again and point at Halucigen, this time opening full fire (he might have escaped before the shields went back up, your choice, but the firepower would go past the shields). Several missile launchers also slide out, firing a total of four missiles at Halucigen.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; As the tail stung into the foot of FZ Halucigen finally found a reason \n&gt; to smile.  Waiting a second for it to fully reach the mainstream, \n&gt; Halucigen gave a order through the bot.\n&gt; &#39;Open the shields, and put away the autoguns, or better yet, have \n&gt; the autoguns shoot you&#39;\n&gt; Opening his wings preparing to fly out.  Then remembering where \n&gt; he had known Zardus to be  looked over.\n\n\n"}}
