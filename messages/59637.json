She had been trapped in a quintesson trap for sometime. \nOnly \n&gt; now it had released her and she was free to go back to her \nfriends. \n&gt; She was after all, a fox pup.  She didn&#39;t have a care in the world \n&gt; except for telling her trainer BlackFang that she was OK and that \nshe \n&gt; wanted to go back to training with him. He was her best friend as \nfar \n&gt; as she was concerned. &quot;BLACKFANG!!! I&quot;M HOME!!! I&quot;M HOME!!!&quot;  She \nran \n&gt; right up to the front doors of the maximal base and saw a bot \nlaying \n&gt; there at the doors. She didn&#39;t know what the matter was, but even \nin \n&gt; her young mind, she knew something was wrong. She opened up an \n&gt; emergency channel. It broadcast over all frequencies and the base \n&gt; intercom. &quot;HEY GUYS! It&#39;s me, Camoflage. I&#39;m home. And there is a \nbot \n&gt; here in trouble out here. Hey guys, open up. I&#39;m hungry too.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
