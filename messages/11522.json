He hadn&#39;t gotten enough satisfaction of killing that peace \nloving freak of a Predacon to be doing this, not nearly enough.  It also \nseemed that Nemesis Enforcer was on a power trip.\n\n&quot;Are we done?&quot; Scavenger asked.\n\n&quot;I think so.&quot; Hiss replied to his comrade.\n\n&quot;Yes, we are done.  The repairs have been complete.  Let&#39;s go see our \ncurrent...leader...about new orders, if any.&quot; Dark One, Breakdown, Pyro, \nHiss, and Scavenger walked off for the bridge.\n\n---\n\nThe Oblitercons were stopped by Scattershot, who was standing, arms crossed, \nin front of the door to the bridge.\n\n&quot;Halt!&quot; he yelled with a demented smile.  &quot;Who goes there?&quot;\n\n&quot;Out of the way, we&#39;re going to see Nemesis.&quot; Dark One replied in an annoyed \ntone, pushing the underling out of the way.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s Emperor Nemesis Enforcer to you!&quot; Scattershot yelled.\n\nDark One sighed.  Why him?  All he wanted to do was work as a mercenary for a \ncompetent leader.  Not a bunch of psychotic killers.  The door opened, all \nthe mercenaries stepping through, not a single light in the bridge.\n\n&quot;Welcome.&quot; Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s voice seemed to boom.\n\n&quot;What the?&quot;\n\n&quot;Silence.  The repairs are finished.  I have made schematics for you, plans \nyou will begin after a night on a recharge bed.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re using the intercom to make your voice seem more powerful?&quot; Hiss \nasked, looking around.\n\nA light suddenly made on, Nemesis Enforcer on a black hover chair, five feet \noff the ground.  &quot;Wonderful, isn&#39;t it!?&quot;\n\nAll the Oblitercons sighed, each talking to each other about how crazy \nNemesis and Scattershot were, leaving the room, Scattershot entering.\n\n&quot;Emperor, they should be punished for their infidelity!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, General.  They should.  But there is no time for that, there are WORLDS \nto conquer!&quot; \n\n\n\n"}}
