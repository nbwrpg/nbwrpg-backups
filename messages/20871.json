She could tell he still cared for her as she \ndid for him. \n\nShe frowned a bit. &quot;Well, gee, things are going to get really boring \naround here aren&#39;t they.&quot; She sighed and knew it was to the good of \nthe planet.\n\nShe heard him give the order to transform. She didn&#39;t think she was \ngoing to change into what she already knew she could change into. She \nstood on her hind legs and engaged the transfomation order.\n\nShe felt something tingle in her body.  Huge gray wings appeared on \nher back. Her head changed into that of a great owl, but her body was \nthat of a polar bear.\nShe squawked and roared. She looked at herself and felt something \nmove inside. She Reared up and finished her transfomation into a \nGreat Owl. She squawked and shifted again. Into full polar bear mode.\n\nher bot mode was now replaced with a griffen type of mode, but \ninstead of Eagle and lion, it was owl and polarbear.\n\nShe looked at Veratis in her bot mode. &quot;OK, so how was that?&quot; \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis stepped back at Ice&#39;s first movement toward him. He was but \na morsel\n&gt; to her now, Her thoughts came to him and he saw the truth about her\n&gt; feelings. he extended a hand and patted her on the top of the \nhead. &quot;No harm\n&gt; was done this time, the virus was contained on time.&quot; he turned \nback to the\n&gt; scans &quot;Until we get the virus entirely out of your system you&#39;re \nstill under\n&gt; quarentine, the only contact you should have is with me or \nLunarpine.&quot; He\n&gt; knew that if her control over her telepathic abilities was that \nfragile\n&gt; she&#39;d know the reasons behind it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine grinned a devilish grin at her thoughts to him. She \ndidn&#39;t have to\n&gt; tell him her fealings for him, he suspected they hadn&#39;t changed. &quot;I \nknow\n&gt; Wing me too.&quot; he said leaving Veratis out of the loop.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis studied the makeup of the DNA strands. She was a bear, \nthere was no\n&gt; sign of the Owl DNA. Then it hit him like a brick, the DNA strands \nwere\n&gt; intertwined around her techno core. &quot;Try and transform and see what\n&gt; happens.&quot; He told her as he tried to put together the last couple \npieces of\n&gt; her existence. If his hypothesis (OOH Big word.) was correct there \nwas more\n&gt; to her than meets the eye.(Little transformers pun intended.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;logomorph@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 14, 2000 6:03 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Ice\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She looked down at Lunarpine. She had a slight smile slip across \nher\n&gt; &gt; he face. She cold still read his mind even though he tried to hide\n&gt; &gt; his thoughts. She was pleased that he liked her new form.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She looked at Veratis as he scanned her. She ws glad that the \nvirus\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t going to kill her or get her killed. &quot;That is good news. \nBut\n&gt; &gt; what happens now?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She read his thoughts and the smile on her face dissappeared. She\n&gt; &gt; could read the anger in his mind. She lower her body down and \nchanged\n&gt; &gt; into full bear mode. She took a step closer to Veratis. She put \nher\n&gt; &gt; thoughts in his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think that I was \nhurting\n&gt; &gt; you. I was more afraid of what Lunarpine thought and didn&#39;t want \nto\n&gt; &gt; face that. I didn&#39;t think I could spread the virus as I was. I \ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know it could have the effect that it could have. Or that it was\n&gt; &gt; putting anything it touched in jeopardy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She nuzzled her huge head against Veratis shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t do it again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She turned and faced Lunarpine. She smiled again and filled his \nhead\n&gt; &gt; with thought of how much she cared for him and how much she had\n&gt; &gt; missed him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
