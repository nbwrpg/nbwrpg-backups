You look like you&#39;ve been smashed through the Pit,\n&gt; torn apart like a git.  To you I would suggest, you can only lay down to be\n&gt; fixed and rest.  Over to the two of them, I would suggest they get you to\n&gt; stay down again.  Before you go out half cocked, I would suggest they make\n&gt; sure you&#39;re stasis locked.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pausing to look over at UNUS.  &quot;Things are getting potentially very bad.\n&gt; With MAGMATRON out and had.  Most would have htought he was dead.  IF he is\n&gt; here, things will be worse before we can get ahead.  Combined with the\n&gt; presence of CRYOTEK, if the two would meet all would go to Drek.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nodding quietly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here, and I think there&#39;s nothing you\n&gt; have to fear.  Take your time, here&#39;ll you&#39;ll stay, or I&#39;ll rhyme until you\n&gt; go away!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS gave WHEELIE a sour look as he reluctantly leaned back on the\nbed he was on, realizing he was not going to the get the support that\nhe wanted. &quot;Fine.&quot; he said as looked at UNUS and WHEELIE.\n\nUNUS was looking thoughtful as he watched RODIMUS and WHEELIE, &quot;I\ndon&#39;t know much about Magmatron, except that he had Saberback build\nus.&quot; His words were careful as if he were dipping back as far into his\nmemory as he could go.\n\nIf there was little known about Magmatron, there was even less known\nabout Saberback. Some called him a wizard others called him a\nscientist, but as to where he came from or what his true goals were\nnone knew. He has served with MAGMATRON for as far back as anyone\ncould remember. Rarely seen in the past he was elusive, secretive and\nas wicked as they came.\n\nThe nurse looked at UNUS and WHEELIE, &quot;Perhaps we should let this one\nrest for a while. &quot; She glanced back at RODIMUS.\n\nUNUS nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot; He said as he looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Perhaps we\nshould give him more time to recover.&quot; His words bordering somewhere\nbetween a command and a suggestion.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
