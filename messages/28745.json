He\n&gt; &gt; took his seat slowly, eagerly awaiting Veratis to decide thier \nnext move.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; thought about the previous attempts at communication and realized \nthat\n&gt; &gt; Megaton had made the most progress of them all. The foxbot \nsnapped to\n&gt; &gt; attension when his mentor finally spoke.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Find me some compatible DNA from the files.&quot; Veratis instructed \nrubbing\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; chin in concentration. &quot;DNA that could be used to find \nsomething.&quot; He\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; use her name but Foxfingers knew exactly what Veratis was \nsearching for.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk had been instructed to maintain radio silence when she \nleft. The\n&gt; &gt; fct that she didn&#39;t break it didn&#39;t surprise her father. The fact \nthat she\n&gt; &gt; was weeks overdue concerned Veratis though. Deep down inside he \nknew she\n&gt; &gt; could handle herself but she&#39;d never been exposed to these \nsituations\n&gt; before\n&gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The computers beeped and crackled as the selected DNA was \ninserted into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; scanner to create the next bot. The protoform slid into place, \nreceiving\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; link from the scanner. &quot;Insert the virus&quot; Veratis called out over \nthe\n&gt; noise\n&gt; &gt; of the computer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The young assistant did as he was told and was rewarded with \nsuccess. He\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; a little more carefull with his selection this time. The mistake \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Megaton had taught him well. This time he used the DNA from two \nfemales.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; was proud of his choices, but Veratis was still wary. Foxfingers \nselected\n&gt; &gt; the DNA from two of the best hunters he could think of.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The stasis pod opened and out stepped a shapely silver female, her\n&gt; features\n&gt; &gt; glimmering in the light of the lab. Foxfingers regretted knowing \nthat soon\n&gt; &gt; the virus would take hold and she would lose her robot \nform. &quot;Hello,\n&gt; welcome\n&gt; &gt; to life as we know it.&quot; The foxbot said to her, trying to watch \nher moves\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; much out of interest as caution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Where am I and where is my unit?&quot; the shining bot queried to her\n&gt; &gt; benefactors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You are where you are needed most my associate. &quot;There was a \nglimmer of\n&gt; &gt; hope in the old bots eyes when he saw what Foxfingers had \ndone. &quot;Your unit\n&gt; &gt; as you put it is in protoform and not ready yet.&quot; he was carefull \nto\n&gt; choose\n&gt; &gt; his words so he didn&#39;t upset his new hope. &quot;I need your help my \ndear.&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; tried to be forward with the bot but didn&#39;t want to say to \nmuch. &quot;My\n&gt; &gt; daughter is missing, she left to collect samples of the wildlife \nand\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; return.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The bot remained in a tall dominant stance, keeping eye contact \nwith her\n&gt; &gt; creator and his assistant. &quot;Give me the information on the \nwildlife she\n&gt; went\n&gt; &gt; after and I&#39;ll find her.&quot; There was no doubt in the females voice \nabout\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; success. her alternate forms showed even greater odds against \nfailure.\n&gt; Even\n&gt; &gt; if the wildlife Veratis had mentioned was translife the female \nwas sure\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t faulter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After The beautiful young female had gathered the information she\n&gt; &gt; transformed into a small and muscular silver furred wolf. her \nshining coat\n&gt; &gt; reflecting the room around her. As quicly as she had scanned the\n&gt; information\n&gt; &gt; she sprinted outside and transformed again. This time she formed \na large\n&gt; &gt; silver and black hawk. the ice and snow of the frigid norwegian \nlandscape\n&gt; &gt; pailed to the glory of the majestic hawk taking flight heading \ntoward Lady\n&gt; &gt; Hawks last known position. (Saudi Arabia) With one last call back \nto the\n&gt; &gt; base she swore into her commlink. &quot;I will return your daughter to \nyou, you\n&gt; &gt; have the word of Silver Scout.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
