How is it that I can communicate with you, \nbut I can&#39;t move my body? How is this possable?&quot;\n\nShe was starting to get scared.  She never comprehended that this \nsort of thing was even possable, let alone happen to her.  She \nwondered if this was a perminant state that she would have to live \nwith, or was it temporary?  She felt an influx of power as her body \nstarted to change physically.  White hair started to grow on her head \nand wings started to grow from her shoulder blades.  \n\nShe paniced and screamed in her mind.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Veratis was in shock, Shadow Wing was somehow communicating with \nhim without\n&gt; the use of receptors.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How are you doing this?&quot; he asked trying to control his shock. If \nshe could\n&gt; truly read his mind she&#39;d sense wonder, confusion, curiosity, and a \nbot who\n&gt; was truly at a loss for words. His experiments somehow gave her \nabilities\n&gt; she hadn&#39;t had in her old form.\n\n\n\n"}}
