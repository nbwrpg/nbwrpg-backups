He \nmoves to the second one.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: In case from the craziness of my past posts you couldn&#39;t tell \n&gt; Rhesus is sort of a Kung Fu guy who feels he lost his honor (except \n&gt; now it&#39;s because they abandoned and outpost).\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhesus has the 2 thrusters/cannons down and is rummaging in the \n&gt; shuttle for tools.  He picks up a small holograpic projector and \nlooks \n&gt; sadly at it.  He sits down and begins to meditate.  He turns on the \n&gt; projector. A picture of a girl bot comes up. The projector starts \n&gt; playing a recording of a woman singing the &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; theme:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                 I don&#39;t know\n&gt;                 what words I can say.\n&gt;                 The wind has a way\n&gt;                 to talk to me.\n&gt;                 Flowers sleep\n&gt;                 a silent lullaby.\n&gt;                 I pray for reply.\n&gt;                 I&#39;m reeeeaaaaady.\n&gt;                 (I forget how the next verse goes and that&#39;s \nactually \n&gt; a traslated version they sing twice in the series not the one they \n&gt; sing at the end of each episode in Japanese).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  During this Rhesus has flashbacks (hey I needed to introduce some \n&gt; conflict).  A small out post with the girl, Mustex, Stallex is born, \n&gt; they constantly try with there few resorces to figure out why \nStallex \n&gt; has to constantly upgrade like organics to adulthood over the last \n10 \n&gt; months (I just dicided to say he ages 12 times faster than human \nkids \n&gt; although it will stop after 20 months and return to normal), then an \n&gt; attack, fighters are everywhere, they four of them are running to \nthe \n&gt; shuttle, 20 ft. away she&#39;s grabbed from behind, she&#39;s held around \nthe \n&gt; neck by a large shadowy bot he can&#39;t quite make out, she screams at \n&gt; him to go, he screams he won&#39;t but pushed the button to close the \ndoor \n&gt; anyway like a coward, and the shuttle takes off.\n&gt; \n&gt; He stands up crying. He stops still looking sad.  He gets his tools \n&gt; and gets back to work on the cannons.\n\n\n"}}
