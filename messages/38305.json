They continued training untill they were done with the\nsession, and then Supernova opened his comm to Zardus.\n\n&quot;Commander,&quot; he transmitted to Zardus, &quot;this is Supernova. Requesting\npermission to join the Gestalt League for the IGL.&quot;\n\n\n\nAntagony had been looking for Zardus, and then she saw him walking\nthrough one of the hallways of the Iron Fist. She jogged to catch up\nwith him, and finally reached him.\n\n&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; she said when she approached, &quot;I&#39;m Antagony, the new\nAlliance member. Perndabot said that I should talk to you.&quot;\n\n\n\nCepta saw Squacktalk get killed, turning around and running out of\nthe room, trying to get as far away from that place as she could. She\nwas very scared, and wasn&#39;t used at all to such violence.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
