Why destroy them all?  We can use him, take to \nUnicron to serve with us.&quot;\n&gt; She finished in time for Organics to appear and open up on \nBlacknightmare.  Hellplague sighs and turns to face Malice, only to \nget punched in the face.\n&gt; &quot;My, we have a temper.  I will enjoy breaking that habit.&quot; \n&gt; Hellplague launches herself on Malice, wrapping her arms around \nhis waist, swinging her body behind him, and then picked him up.  \nShe threw him to the ground, and sat on his chest.  He was \ntemporarily stunned, so she took the stray chance to cup his face \nand kiss him again.  The bounty hunter roused around to find himself \nbeing kissed a second time.  The minion breaks the kiss, a satisfied \nlook on her face.\n&gt; &quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; Malice said in a deep, unforgiving \nvoice,&quot;cause that may be the last one you get.&quot;\n&gt; The minion was genuinly suprised, even as Malice delivered a \npunishing blow to her exposed abdomine.  She stood, then doubled \nover, gasping for breath.  malice sood and stretched his back.  He \nhad his sinister grin as he approached, and then charged.  Body \nchecking Hellplague, Malice used the momentuum to punch, kick and \nslash, with his claws and limbs.  Hellplague came to rest near a \nridge over looking an enormous energon deposit.  She looke over the \nedge down into the glowing chasm, and as Malice charged again, got \nan idea.  Just before he got to her, Hellplague jumped up and over \nthe hunter, and kicked hard, sending him to the chasm floor.  Malice \nfell, tumbled, and came o rest, impaled with giant shards of energon \npiercing his body.  He rests motionless, before the rest of the \nfighters to see.  Hellplague staggers to her feet, and looks down to \nthe bounty hunter.\n&gt; &quot;Tsk, a shame.  I wanted to have fun with him.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNighmare:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;EXCUSE ME HELLPLAGUE!!!&quot;said annoyed BlackNightmare &quot;This male \nIT&#39;S \n&gt; MINE!!!!

He drew his sword and prepared to strike \n&gt; the final blow to Blacknightmare.  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Without warning, the sixth minion sprang into action.  She dived \n&gt; down on the bounty hunter and tackled him.  Both roll around on \nthe \n&gt; ground until they are a fair distance away from the rest of the \n&gt; fighting.  They rested, with the sixth minion sitting on top of \n&gt; Malice, and both trying to force the other away.  She leaned down \n&gt; until their faces were only inches apart.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My, a powerful one.  And what is your name?&quot; she asked in a \n&gt; seductive tone.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My name, is Malice, the single most powerful bounty hunter to \n&gt; walk any world,&quot; the transmetal male said as he continued pushing \n&gt; against his opponent,&quot;and who are you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My name is Hellplague,&quot; she said, and stole a kiss before \npushing \n&gt; herself off the hunter.  Said hunter stood and tried to wipe the \n&gt; action from his face.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You ought to keep your face to your self, lady, it will get you \n&gt; in trouble one of these days.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague smirked and giggled to herself, thenm both charged \n&gt; forward and engaged in another stalemate.\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
