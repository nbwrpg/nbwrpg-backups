Keep\n&gt;&gt; alert&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fractyl&#39;s now more serpantine head nodded as he looked at Hydras as he\n&gt; hovered on reptillian wings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Inferno smiled as he looked at his master, &quot;I am ready my master.&quot; he\n&gt; said. his optics bright and ready.\n&gt;\n&gt; Iguanus, in his reptile mode swished his tail, the frill around his\n&gt; collar rufling slightly as he nodded to his commander. &quot;I am ready\n&gt; Hydras.&quot; he said.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras tunr on the BlackFortress&#39;s defences and looking to the others\n&gt;&gt; predacons he motioned to follow him. before left unprotected his base he\n&gt;&gt; liked to be sure that nothing else was around his base\n&gt;\n&gt; The base systems turned on at once, the hum of full power to all\n&gt; systems could be heard in the throne room. All indicator lights showed\n&gt; green, and at the moment there was no unauthorized energy signatures\n&gt; on displayed, all appeared as it should be.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then he left and went to Cyclonus&#39;s location\n&gt;\n&gt; If Hydras chooses he could simply locate Cyclonus via radio and note\n&gt; that Cyclonus&#39; radio signature placed him deep in the tunnel track\n&gt; that the Maximals had used a while back. He was down in the caves and\n&gt; approximately 30 miles distance from  from Hydras&#39; fortress,\n&gt; presumably still searching for Scourge. His signature is along with\n&gt; two others: Bruticus-X, a highly profficient Predacon tracker as well\n&gt; as security officer, as well as another Predacon called simply enough,\n&gt; Insecticon who highly skilled in surveillance and tracking.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: It&#39;s up to you Airily if you have Hydras go to Cyclonus&#39;\n&gt; position or just scan for his radio, either way is cool.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
