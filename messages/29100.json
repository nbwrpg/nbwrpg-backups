As someone who just today watched TF: The Movie\n&gt; for like, the 50th time, it&#39;s clear I love\n&gt; Transformers.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT, I just joined this RP yesterday. Anybody mind\n&gt; filling me in on what&#39;s going on? (I&#39;m loyal to\n&gt; Generation 1 and Beast Wars. Beast Machines was OKAY,\n&gt; but I just did not get anything that came post-movie.\n&gt; The magic, as they say...was gone after the TF: Movie\n&gt; mega-massacre. I can&#39;t get ahold of any of the\n&gt; Japanese episodes, Although I WILL watch the NEW\n&gt; TRANSFORMERS SHOW oh so faithfully.\n&gt; (Autobots...Decepticons...*sigh* Home at last). My\n&gt; favorite characters are in no particular order, both\n&gt; the original and Beast Wars Megatrons (but I favor the\n&gt; Decepticon to the Predacon), Dinobot, Optimus Prime,\n&gt; Cheetor, Waspinator (My favorite Predacon. Hey, who\n&gt; doesn&#39;t just laugh their asses off at\n&gt; &quot;WASSSSPINATORRRR TERRORIZZZZZZZZZZZE!&quot;), Grimlock and\n&gt; probably my favorite overall...Unicron (who I will say\n&gt; has probably THE BEST theme music in all of TF lore).\n&gt; I just wish Hasbro would stop pushing them to sell\n&gt; TOYS before telling stories. Then it would get REALLY\n&gt; good. \n&gt; \n&gt; Somebody mind telling me exactly WHAT is going on\n&gt; storylinewise? I have a couple of characters in mind.\n&gt; Even though I&#39;ll probably only use one or two in this\n&gt; RP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hummer: An Autobot, transforms into a Humvee. Real\n&gt; wiseass. Has a sarcastic remark for every occasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killshot: Decepticon (or he could be a Destron,\n&gt; whatever you guys have) who transforms into a very\n&gt; large machine gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Omicron: (so far my favorite) A planet-sized destroyer\n&gt; of worlds created by the same entity that created\n&gt; Unicron. Omicron is also twice the size of Unicron.\n&gt; He&#39;s been dormant for 6 million years until something\n&gt; awakens him. He could be a common villian for a later\n&gt; storyline.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can somebody bring me up to speed on what&#39;s\n&gt; happening? Thanx.\n&gt; \n&gt; AIM is KevServo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
