I think my readouts did\n&gt; &gt; suggest there was a base somewhere out at sea.

And what Mustex doesn&#39;t know\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; that I&#39;m considering using this as a major part in\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; attack strategy that would annialate the Iron Fist\n&gt; &gt; (considering mind you I still have to work some\n&gt; major\n&gt; &gt; bugs out).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thunderstorm: Uuhh...
