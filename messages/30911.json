He transforms and pulls out his grenade launcher,\nbut before he can start a fire fight, a blast of powerful energy hits him\nin the side, sending him flying. Another large blast can be heard, and the\nsame type of fusion energy rockets towards Rippersnapper.\n\nSinnertwin falls into a few trees a bit of a way off, and hits hard. His\nbody still smoking from the blast, but no real damage done to him.\n\n\n\n"}}
