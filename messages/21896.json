She was breathing hard and \nsweating under her fur.  The drain from her energy supply made her \nfeel light headed. She watched Razor Claw go into the CR. She stepped \ncloser to it as he called to her. She smiled. &quot;Thank you. And I&#39;m \nsorry for biting you. I didn&#39;t want to hurt you. But, I had to do \nsomething. I couldn&#39;t let the others get hurt either. Welcome to our \ngroup.&quot;\n\nShe moved over to her corner and sat down in polarbear mode.

Veratis \nsmiled \n&gt; as he looked in at the latest addition to thier group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw called for Ice to come closer. &quot;I heard your name during \n&gt; the fight, Ice, It suits you well.&quot; he stared out at the prototype \n&gt; for his kind and smiled. \n&gt; \n&gt; (Got to go, Dinners in an hour and I have Potatos to finish.)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Yeah you did.
