But with the dagger wound in her leg, \nshe couldn&#39;t run fast enough. Her side hurt from Killers first slash \nat her and now her hand was gone. She hoped that she could make it to \nthe Ark and prayed to the Matrix that her wing would heal faster so \nshe could fly out of there.  Lunarpine was right in that I&#39;d never \nmake it in a real fight, she told herself and kept running.  She was \ngetting tired and the pain was dragging her down. \n\n\n"}}
