Blaze stepped closer\n&gt; to the console looking\n&gt; at the controls. Being a yechnologies specialist\n&gt; meant she could figure out\n&gt; almost any technology. She stood aside for\n&gt; Blacknightmare. the young female\n&gt; bott didn&#39;t want to show off in front of the\n&gt; Predacon so she stood to the\n&gt; side of the console to allow Blacknightmare room to\n&gt; access whatever she\n&gt; needed.\n&gt; ::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well &quot; said kindly the femme &quot;We can find out\n&gt; that... Follow me&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; While she walked to other register room &quot;If you&#39;re\n&gt; in this base then,\n&gt; you belong here&quot; said Blacknightmare &quot;We should\n&gt; check data bases and\n&gt; regist you, I guess that you don&#39;t know who&#39;s the\n&gt; leader here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
