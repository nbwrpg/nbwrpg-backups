As someone who just today watched TF: The Movie\nfor like, the 50th time, it&#39;s clear I love\nTransformers.\n\nBUT, I just joined this RP yesterday. Anybody mind\nfilling me in on what&#39;s going on? (I&#39;m loyal to\nGeneration 1 and Beast Wars. Beast Machines was OKAY,\nbut I just did not get anything that came post-movie.\nThe magic, as they say...was gone after the TF: Movie\nmega-massacre. I can&#39;t get ahold of any of the\nJapanese episodes, Although I WILL watch the NEW\nTRANSFORMERS SHOW oh so faithfully.\n(Autobots...Decepticons...*sigh* Home at last). My\nfavorite characters are in no particular order, both\nthe original and Beast Wars Megatrons (but I favor the\nDecepticon to the Predacon), Dinobot, Optimus Prime,\nCheetor, Waspinator (My favorite Predacon. Hey, who\ndoesn&#39;t just laugh their asses off at\n&quot;WASSSSPINATORRRR TERRORIZZZZZZZZZZZE!&quot;), Grimlock and\nprobably my favorite overall...Unicron (who I will say\nhas probably THE BEST theme music in all of TF lore).\nI just wish Hasbro would stop pushing them to sell\nTOYS before telling stories. Then it would get REALLY\ngood. \n\nSomebody mind telling me exactly WHAT is going on\nstorylinewise? I have a couple of characters in mind.\nEven though I&#39;ll probably only use one or two in this\nRP.\n\nHummer: An Autobot, transforms into a Humvee. Real\nwiseass. Has a sarcastic remark for every occasion.\n\nKillshot: Decepticon (or he could be a Destron,\nwhatever you guys have) who transforms into a very\nlarge machine gun.\n\nOmicron: (so far my favorite) A planet-sized destroyer\nof worlds created by the same entity that created\nUnicron. Omicron is also twice the size of Unicron.\nHe&#39;s been dormant for 6 million years until something\nawakens him. He could be a common villian for a later\nstoryline.\n\nSo can somebody bring me up to speed on what&#39;s\nhappening? Thanx.\n\nAIM is KevServo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo! Mail. \nhttp://personal.mail.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
