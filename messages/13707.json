She \nkissed him,&quot;Thank you.&quot;  She smiled at him and walked down te hall \ntowards the main room.  She took over the com-center and started \nworking on the autogun ranges andhoping to expand them.  She looked \non the scanner and saw a pod had crashed near the base and two bots \nwhere outside the pod, not moving from thier current location.\n(GoldenEye and Dollen)\nShe spoke out to Drillbit.  &quot;Hey, Drillbit.  I have a pod on the west \nside of the base.  Two bots near the pod.  You want to go and get \nthem and bring them here?&quot;\n\nShe scanned sigantures and smiled,&quot;And they are Predacons.  Ah, more \ntroops for Megatron. Yes, please go and get them. we may need them.&quot;\n\n\nDarkMouse::\n\nShe looked at Quickstrike and then to Aracnia. &quot;Look, Megatron isn&#39;t \nour friend. You heard the bug, he&#39;s mad.  When he gets mad, things \nget ugly.&quot;  She sniffed the air and could smell Megatron on the \nwind.  She knew, it was already to late.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looked to Kitkat when Waspinator entered the \ncave. &quot;Your in \n&gt; command until my return. I want you to get rid of those \ninvaders....failure \n&gt; is not an option. I dont think I need to remind you. And tell \nStarscream if \n&gt; he wants to join he had better pick up a blaster and shoot someone!&quot;\n&gt;     He began to leave, but turned agian. &quot;Waspinator, Atma, and \nPurseudo are \n&gt; under you command as well as the others. Use it wisely.&quot;\n&gt;     He exited the cave and the fans slid out and he took to the sky \nheading \n&gt; from the predacon bunker.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;When will he get here?!!&quot; Tarantulas demanded to Aracnia.\n&gt;     She turned to him, angry. &quot;I dont know! But hes going to help \nus, despite \n&gt; what Quickstrike and Darkmouse say. He should be here soon.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Hah, so will the Aliens.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
