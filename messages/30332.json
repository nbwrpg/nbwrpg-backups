He reached down as if to\nscoop some out with his claws. In his eyes he had two fistfulls of lava, but\nin reality he had two claws of dirt. He pulled his claws back and threw the\nmolten earth/ dirt at Ice. &quot;You will move or you WILL be destroyed.&quot; he\nyells knowing that the &quot;teddy&quot; bear in front of him wasn&#39;t worth his effort.\n\nLunarpine stood up again, the hair on his back looked like needles. &quot;Leave\nher alone monster&quot; He yelled. The wolf fired a sonic howl at his nemesis\nhoping to stop the beast from reaching his objective.\n\nMagaton was hit by a solid wave of force as the howl overcame him, &quot;If thats\nyour best than I haven&#39;t a worry.&quot; He swung a wing to the side creating a\ngust of wind sending the wolf rolling across the ground.

She used her mind to send the\nmessage\n&gt; to him, she focused her thoughts to make him see the ground he was on turn\n&gt; to molten lava.  The closer he came to Ice and Lunarpine, the more intense\n&gt; the image got.
