So far, \nwe&#39;re \n&gt; ok here. but from what I can make out, there are some really mean \n&gt; bots outside somewhere.

She carried \nthe \n&gt; baby in her small child arms and tried to be a big bot for her and \n&gt; the baby. She just walked around the halls, talking in a soft voice \n&gt; and trying to keep the baby calm despite the fact that her own \nfears \n&gt; were growing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Elita::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elita ended to drink her bottle and she started to smile and purr\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
