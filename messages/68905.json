The shuttle a=\r\nnd \nArk weapons do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jhiaxus notices where the Maixmals are co=\r\nncentraiting their fire \nand turns about, opening laser \n&gt; fire on the same=\r\n targets.\n\nAs normal Scourge is indistinguishable from other sweeps and so =\r\nis \nignored by the cannon fire, but the other minion in the air is not as \n=\r\nfortunate as multiple guns opened up on Tumult! While he is highly \nagile a=\r\nnd very well armored, several shots hit him, causing him to \nflip through t=\r\nhe air like so much scrap! He is unable to return fire \nas he attempts to m=\r\nove away!\n\nHowever as soon as the Maximals and Autobots stop focusing on th=\r\ne \nsweeps they on the other hand open fire on the shields that legacy is \nh=\r\nolding in place, causing it to flicker and weaken visibly. It is \nclear tha=\r\nt without the shuttle or Ark to augment his own weapons the \nsweeps will qu=\r\nickly deplete his power reserves. \n\n---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n\nAs Scorponok unleashed a full weapon batte=\r\nries onslaught, several \nsweeps are caught in the fire and explode, spewing=\r\n debris on the \nground. However the other six Sweeps swing around and open =\r\nfire on \nthe hopefully more stationary and vulnerable Scorponok!\n\n---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecibel laug=\r\nhed as the sweeps moved in over Predicons, raining \ndestruction down on the=\r\nm. She was in the upper skies, allowing the \nsweeps to absorb the opening s=\r\nalvo of weapons as she targets Hydras&#39; \nshuttle again with more sonic missi=\r\nles! The sweeps on the other hand \ntake the brunt of the attacks, a few exp=\r\nloding like miniature \nfireballs!\n\n----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n\n&gt; As Cyc&#39;s laser blasts come at him, Rodimu=\r\ns transforms to bot mode, \nleaping over the lasers.\n&gt; He is close to Cyclon=\r\nus, coming at him in a flying kick position.\n\nCyclonus watched the nimble A=\r\nutobot leap at him, his face calm almost \nspeculative as he observes. &quot;Inte=\r\nresting . . . &quot; He said as he \nstepped to one side of the kick as he at the=\r\n same time charged his \npalm blasters and opened fire on Rodimus as he pass=\r\ned by him, &quot; . . . \nbut ultimately useless.&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
