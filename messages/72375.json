Do I have permission ta use my quills?  Wh=\r\noever has my brother&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and the others really need a taste of their o=\r\nwn medicine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap raises his hand.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&quot; And I would like permission ta give Rodimus a piece of my mind whenever h=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shows his face again!  If he hadn&#39;t gone all evil on us the firs=\r\nt time, we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be in this mess!  And Tucson wouldn&#39;t be out t=\r\nhere risk&#39;n his neck&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; just ta save his aft!  What kind of a leader =\r\njust up and disappears when his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; crew needs him most, and comes bac=\r\nk a super villain?!  NONE!  If anyone&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should bear the matrix, it&#39;s=\r\n gotta be someone we can all trust.  Someone who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sticks by us no m=\r\natter what.  And someone who has a good head on their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shoulders.  =\r\nLeo Prime, please, don&#39;t let Rodimus back inta leadership.  It&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was=\r\n one of Tucson&#39;s wishes before he left ta go after Wheelie.  Promise me&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; you&#39;ll keep that promise?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move =\r\nand constantly busy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Oct 5, 2011, at 12:29 PM, Super C=\r\nyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nsupercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straigh=\r\nt Shot&#39;s heart sinks upon listening to Legacy, as does Rattrap&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; We were afraid you&#39;d say that. Aww pits over s=\r\nlag! Could we for once,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have the chance ta get the upper =\r\nhand?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ther=\r\ne was a slight chuckle from LORD EDLER, &quot;If it were easy then they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t call Maximals heroes.&quot; He stepped foward, &quot;But it&#39;s going to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; be up to us to save the day.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WING C=\r\nALIBER walked back from the shuttle back to the area where the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n rest of them were standing. &quot;The last I heard he had the ship called&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; the Dinosaur. For some reason his men tended to have a dinosaur mot=\r\nif&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to them.&quot; CALIBER shrugged slightly. &quot;If he still has the s=\r\nhip, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; might be in that jungle area.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; ELDER nodded, &quot;It is certainly big enough to hold his ship.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;That jungle will eventually be large enough to encompass se=\r\nveral&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; conntries in what will be later known as Central America=\r\n.&quot; LEGACY said&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in his cold tones. &quot;It is large enough to hold =\r\nthat ship and hide it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; from our sensors. From our initial scans=\r\n that Jungle, at least that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; foward area is producing a wave ef=\r\nfect that resembles a Unicronian&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; energy signature. It has the =\r\naffect of blocking standard comlink&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; signals as well as inhibit=\r\ning scanning beams.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ELDER furrowed his brow as i=\r\nf trying to remember something, then he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; shook his head. &quot;A shi=\r\np could bve in there and hidden well, but I have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; been watching=\r\n for quite some time now. I don&#39;t have any record of a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ship as=\r\n large as the Dinsaur is reputed to be landing on Earth.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; As they talked LEO PRIME walked into the room, &quot;Alright men strap =\r\non&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; your gear and let&#39;s get ready.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; W=\r\nOLFGANG and RAMULUS were helping NIGHTSHIFT to get to the CR chamber&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; as the LEO had entered. &quot;You&#39;re not going to use that shuttle.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; WOLFGANG said. &quot;It&#39;s going to need some repairs.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; LEO nodded, &quot;No, we are going to use mine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Just outside of the Ark a ship seemed to almost materialize as its&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; cloak disappated, revealing the ship the LEO PRIME and his crew h=\r\nad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; arrived on. The ship was alrady starting to glow as its eng=\r\nines&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; powered up and a ramp began to lower.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; (LEO&#39;s Ship:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/n=\r\nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/1078733870/view&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/1078733870/view&quot;&gt;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/1078733870/view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Turning to the others LEO PRIME spoke, &quot;Legacy=\r\n, stay here and take&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; charge of the Ark until Polar Claw is ful=\r\nl repaired.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Straightshot, Quickstride, Rat Trap=\r\n&quot; LEO called out. &quot;I will need&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; your skills on this mission.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as he spoke TORCA and his crew were already b=\r\noarding the ship,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; followed by SANTON and WINGCALIBER.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO Turned to the others. &quot;Bump and Legacy will take care=\r\n of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wounded until we return.
