And they\n&gt; would likely to have at least an escort, or an honor guard.  Probably elite\n&gt; soldiers and veterans, perhaps those who fought in the GREAT WAR.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As much as he enjoyed combat against MAXIMAL OPPRESSORS, the thought of\n&gt; taking a PRIME on in combat along with their personal escort would be\n&gt; suicide, even by his standards.\n&gt;\n&gt; If such a powerful soldier was here, then why would he also be attempting to\n&gt; engage in a truce wtih the PREDACONS?\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT offered as a &#39;suggestion&#39; to HYDRAS, &quot;Garner as much intelligence as\n&gt; you can from this newcomer as to waht the circumstances are, and attempt to\n&gt; negotiate for as full a price as you can for our direct..  Assistance.  So\n&gt; that we might have a full picture of circumstances.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKYSHADOW nodded in agreement as he looked to see the image of LEO\nPRIME staring out through the viewscreen, able to see only HYDRAS but\npossibly aware that others were looking back at him.\n\nTurning to VICEGRIP there was a chuckle from SKYSHADOW, &quot;Maybe the\nMaximals are planning something, an offensive against us?&quot; He shrugged\nslightly. &quot;They have been getting more agressive with that Tuscon at\ntheir head, even if he does seem to be a bit trusting.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, BLACKARACHNIA gave a mental sigh.  WHy did the interesting\n&gt; ones always be the ones that enjoyed playing too much?  Smiling back up at\n&gt; CRYOTEK.  &quot;Ohh, I guess you&#39;ll have to learn thigns on your own time.&quot;\n&gt; Giving a wink, &quot;And I&#39;ll enjoy going along with you for every moment of it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Waiting for HYDRAS and TARANTALUS to give out the mission roders to see what\n&gt; she would be made to do as far as retrieval went.\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Oh I am sure we both have so many things to learn.&quot; CRYOTEK said in a\nlow conspirital whisper, one that was easily loud enough for most of\nthe others to hear. &quot;Things which will be revealed in their own time.&quot;\nHe gave her a knowing smile and wink as he turned his attention to\nHYDRAS and then FRACTYL in turn\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;DO IT!!!&quot; commanded the male at fractyl &quot;AS FAST AS NOW&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a quick jerky nod from FRACTYL, &quot;Yes, of course sir.&quot; He\nsaid. &quot;It is just a matter of cross circuiting its internal return\nmechanism with its internal beacon, and then inserting my own bit of\nprogramming that I have been workiing on . . .&quot;\n\nFRACTYL flipped the device over in his hands, his nimble fingers\nmanipulating the device. Then it beeped and then pulsed once and then\nbegan to display a locator signal on its small screen.\n\n&quot;If you take the device it can lead you to the location.&quot; FRACTYL\nglanced down at the device and then back up to HYDRAS, &quot;It is not\nopertaing on standard Maximal or Predacon frequencies a strange\nUnicronian frequency.&quot; he said. &quot;In fact the transmission itself is\nusing a version of Angolmois energy.&quot;\n\nAngolmois Energy, a word used only in hushed whispers. It is an energy\nsaid to be composed of Unicron&#39;s own life energy, his &#39;blood&#39; so to\nspeak (if he were human) and it is said to have strange properties and\nunknown capabilities.\n\nFRACTYL handed the device to HYDRAS.\n\n&quot;Isn&#39;t that the same type of energy we have detected as comming from\nthat jungle?&quot; CRYOTEK asked, although it is obvious he already knew\nthe answer.\n\nFRACTYL nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
