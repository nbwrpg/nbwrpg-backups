He dumped them all around the hunter and went to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \n&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more \n&gt; alert.  \n&gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; settled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot \nto \n&gt; &gt; it, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder \n&gt; immediatly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his \nbonds, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and \ntouched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and \n&gt; &gt; scooted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back \n&gt; onto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his \nankles \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his \n&gt; arms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and \nstraddled \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting \n&gt; herself \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her arms resting on his chest.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little \n&gt; lizard \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a \n&gt; &gt; devious \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smirk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

For whatever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; purpose, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wants him alive.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his &lt;BR&gt;&gt;

of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon &lt;BR&gt;&gt; storage.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to &lt;BR&gt;Malice&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; new &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; residence.&nbsp; He dumped them all around the hunter and went to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.&nbsp; His vision was blurred &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the\n familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; alert.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; settled &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.&nbsp; He touched his foot &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.&nbsp; His shoulder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; immediatly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.&nbsp; He set up and tried to break his &lt;BR&gt;bonds, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.&nbsp; He scooted forward and &lt;BR&gt;touched &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.&nbsp; He quickly healed the rest of his body and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; scooted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up &lt;BR&gt;when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.&nbsp; She walked over and pushed him back &lt;BR&gt;&gt; onto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bed.&nbsp; She put\n what looked like gravitity weights on his &lt;BR&gt;ankles &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.&nbsp; She repeated the same proceedure on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.&nbsp; She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.&nbsp; He tried to get up, but his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; arms &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.&nbsp; Hellplague smiled and &lt;BR&gt;straddled &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; herself &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her arms resting on his chest.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lizard &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I\n may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; devious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smirk.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
