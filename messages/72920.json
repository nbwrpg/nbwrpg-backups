Me Wheelie think Grimlock smash those who think he\n&gt; begot.  Of what me Wheelie know, Grimlock never let others say where he go.\n&gt; Me Wheelie thing it is to say, that GRIMLOCK not follow orders any time of\n&gt; day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dodging over to the side then if SLAG were to charge towards him, trying to\n&gt; keep up teh banter, &quot;Me Wheelie know GRIMLOCK no follow orders from PRIME,\n&gt; me WHEELIE think you following on someone else&#39;s TIME.  Why ar eyou doing\n&gt; what they say, without making them have to pay?
