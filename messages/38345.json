Not showing \nany fright however. &quot;Our power was already absolute, but you could \nnot wield it Megatron. All you did was bring in a filter so you \nwouldn&#39;t have to take the full fall when you cannot win a battle.  \nAnd my loyalty is not to you, but to the Decepticons, which is the \nbeggining of all and end of everytthing. Not you, or Soundwave, or \neven me, but the power which flows through the Decepticon name \nMegatron. That is what you always failed to know!&quot;  \nFirestrike looked surprised not knowing where all of these felling \ncame from.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron overheard the last part, and smiled. Yes, that&#39;s it, show \nyour\n&gt; fury Firestike, he thought to himself. I serve the cause, so must \nyou,\n&gt; but don&#39;t forget, I have become part of the cause, he continued to\n&gt; think.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned around, and held out a hand. &quot;I again apologize for my \nneed to\n&gt; open fire on you Firestrike, but if you had interfered, Shockwave \nwould\n&gt; never have joined us, and our power would not be absolute. But you \nserve\n&gt; the cause, our Destiny, and that is all that is importan.&quot; He then\n&gt; looked downcast. &quot;But showing loyalty helps our cause, don&#39;t forget\n&gt; that.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
