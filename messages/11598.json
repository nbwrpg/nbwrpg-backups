Nah, I&#39;m having my doubts.  I \nneed everyone involved and to get along with each other just long \nenough to pull it off. And I got the feeling it isn&#39;t going to \nhappen. For one, Terrorsaur doesn&#39;t like the plan at all and probably \nwon&#39;t talk to me about it.  For two, I have two bots who are still in \nthe training stages. They can fight, but they need to understand and \nknow more about what we are dealing with. That could take months.  \nAnd for three, if Terrorsaur tells Megatron, I might as well blow my \nown head off because Megatron will most likely do it for me.&quot; she \ngave a deep sigh. &quot;Nah, it will never work.&quot; She finishe her drink in \none gulp and went back to get another.  She sat back down and downed \nhalf of her second drink in one swallow. &quot;Nah, it just won&#39;t work. \nI&#39;m sorry Drillbit.&quot;  She stared at her glass.\n\n\n"}}
