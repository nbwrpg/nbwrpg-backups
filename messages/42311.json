You \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; just grab bots out of other bots&#39; hands. You can attempt to, but \nthe \n&gt; other person has to post if the attempt was successful. You can&#39;t \n&gt; place a time bomb and have it explode in the same post, you have to \n&gt; let the other person reply. There were also some minor things about \n&gt; doing too many things in one post. Anyways, watch yourselves next \n&gt; time!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; PS (to everyone). I wasn&#39;t on yesterday cause I was recabling my \n&gt; house / setting up a new server. Some of you might have noticed \nthat \n&gt; the login script doesn&#39;t work right now. I&#39;m still battling with \nthe \n&gt; server to get that working. I wasn&#39;t on today cause I had work \n(yup, \n&gt; work on a saturday sucks), and then a few friends came over and we \n&gt; had an unplanned LAN party, which took up the rest of the time. I&#39;m \n&gt; kinda pooped so I&#39;ll make a few quick posts and then go to sleep. \n&gt; I&#39;ll post in full tomorrow, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Luzbel/Attilla::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Attilla saw what Galvatron had done, he cursed and quickly \n&gt; flew \n&gt; &gt; a way his brother before the bomb exploted, Luzbel didn&#39;t let go \nof \n&gt; &gt; Panzer and bomb damaged slighty his armor; after explotion, \nLuzbel \n&gt; &gt; landed in order to check Panzer&#39;s status; Attilla landed too, and \n&gt; &gt; walked some steps and stopped near his brother.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While Luzbel did that, Attilla was on guard and ready to fight; \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t like that Galvatron didnt strike back or any other group \nof \n&gt; &gt; bots caught them unawared. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Galvatron stopped. &quot;You know what.....the hell with this.
