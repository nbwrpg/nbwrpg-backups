And like any other part of\nmy life, I want things to get better. If I am elected to the council, I\nwill do everything in my power to make things beter. I will listen to\neveryones ideas, and if they will help the RPG, I will try to impliment\nthem. \n And if we want to talk about RP ability, you all know me. Even though\nthis was my first RPG, I know the rules well, and rarely mode.\nI would like to think of everyone in this RPG as friends, and would\nappreciate you&#39;re vote. Thank you!\n\n"}}
