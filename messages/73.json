She snickered and \nsmiled before laying her head on her paws, it had been a fun day.\nTeltoli&#39;s smile widened even further as Carnage rolled onto her side with a \nloud...THUMP! Now the Fuzor only saw the back of the brown and black \nreptile, she sighed and closed her eyes...she would sleep well.\nCarnage, on the other hand, withered and writhed in her sleep. The memories \nwere back and with a fierce vengeance now that Carnage wasn&#39;t awake and \ncouldn&#39;t just push them back in the depths of her memory, they came to the \nsurface and spilled forth in one terrifying nightmare!\nEverything came to the surface, the destruction of her home world, the \nPredacons taking her in and teaching her how to kill, her friendship with \nDinobot,and finally his....death! Everything!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
