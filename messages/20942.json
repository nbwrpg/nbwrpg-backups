But she braces herself.\n\nBut then at Reptilicas report that they were merged again she slowly gets to \nher feet, hanging onto the wall for support just in case the base decided to \nshake again.\nThough, Desmonus turnes her amber optics towards Reptilica.*\n\n&quot; But why did we have to relocate in the first place. I thought that we had \nalready chosen our landing spot the last time we set down?&quot;\n\n* Desmonus steps away from the wall a bit, but keeping a bit close to it \njust to make sure she had something to support her if something else \nhappened.\nShe began to dust off her armor and her wings, looking behind to make sure \nthere weren&#39;t any smudges on her rear.\nNothing.\nDesmonus looked towards Bloodystrike as he turned his gaze towards her.\nBut glad that at least it was the drink he was after at the moment.*\n\n&quot; Sounds good to me. Hmm...what would you recommend?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
