Halucigen unfortuantly found \n&gt; nothing of much importance, besides the message to the dark lord, \n&gt; and a message to a new being.  He would get to this being, and \n&gt; bring him as his own. Then meet the Dark One.  But why would FZ \n&gt; have a contact with him as well. It was all very confusing.\n\n\n"}}
