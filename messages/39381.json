Battle might be soon in coming.\n&gt;But not before she had enough information to go on. And with a thoughtful\n&gt;expression she nodded.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Thanx, Cyndro.

Large shoulder-plates, flowing\n&gt;cape and steps that nearly rattled the city. Impressive or not, it was\n&gt;unwise to get on her bad side.\n&gt;And with a metal ring of resting armor she came to an eased stop beside\n&gt;HotRod.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; I&#39;m here.
