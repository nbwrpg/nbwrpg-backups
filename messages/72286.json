A quiet shaking of his head as hew shipered, as if half in\n&gt; fear, ahlf in shock, half in (he&#39;s bad at math) surprise and half mourning.\n&gt; &quot;Grimlock, you say?  With four others..  Dinosaurs if I may?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The bit with the &#39;black large car&#39; and the other &#39;Maximal&#39; hitting him for a\n&gt; few moments as he forced some coolant to pump through his systems and cut\n&gt; back his emotional subroutines, &quot;For who those two were, I don&#39;t know.  But\n&gt; I do not know where to go.  If Grimlock is here, why I say..  Would he\n&gt; attack another in such a way?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shaking his head quietly, processing.  Assuming that it meant Grimlock and\n&gt; hte other Dinobots were here on Earth as well, even Grimlock in a poor mood\n&gt; would not attack a Maximal with intent to kill.  He might beat them some or\n&gt; intimidate, but if what he was being told was true and Grimlock had not held\n&gt; back..\n&gt;\n&gt; Something was wrong.  Definitely wrong.  Grimlock was too stubborn to be\n&gt; reprogrammed, and the Predacons, like the Decepticons had tended to utilize\n&gt; far more blatant methodologies in reprogramming, at least as he was aware\n&gt; of.  And would hardly had let the Dinobots randomly wander around the\n&gt; landscape either.  Even in here.  That left the Unicronians, whom what\n&gt; little nkowledge of their participation in the BEAST WARS he had read of\n&gt; preferred more blatant things as signs of their corruption, like heavy\n&gt; upgrades or slave collars..\n&gt;\n&gt; So, that left one hideously disquieting thought in WHEELIE that with what\n&gt; limited data he had seemed the likeliest bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; That GRIMLOCK and the DINOBOTS had attacked another Maximal brutally and of\n&gt; their own free processor and subroutines.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if so..\n&gt;\n&gt; WHY?\n\nYes, why were the the &#39;Dinobots&#39; acting so un&#39;bot&#39; like, attacking\nseemingly anyone, that was just so unlike them. Sure they have always\nbeen aggressive and stubborn and rebellious, but they always seemed to\nstop just short of outright attacking, at least with the Autobots.\n\nBut then again not much was heard from them once the great wars were\nover and the peace accord set in. Most people may have thought they\nwent their own way, perhaps to fight wars elsewhere in the galaxy, or\nperhaps they finally learned the ways of peace. There were many\nAutobots who were unable to stop their violent ways after the war had\nended, and had to taken in by the Peace Keepers to be re-educated. But\nsurely GRIMLOCK and his men were not among those, no never them. Their\ncontribution to the war had been too great, too important, their\nlegacy to important.\n\nNo, not the Dinobots . . .\n\nUNUS looked at WHEELIE and nodded. &quot;If those other ones were not your\nfriends, then who are they?&quot; The question somewhat rhetorical as he\nruminated over the question.\n\nDARKHOOF looked confused, &quot;They had the symbol that the other one\ndescribed.&quot; He said pointing at the door, behind which RODIMUS was\nlaying.\n\nThere was a friendly smile from UNUS as he put a comforting hand on\nDARKHOOF, &quot;If they were not individuals that this one has met, they\ncan still be part of his people.&quot; He nodded to him, &quot;I am sure you did\nrightly.&quot;\n\nDARKHOOF nodded a smile on his face again. He seemed young, if he were\nhuman he would probrably be in his late teens somewhere, perhaps his\nearly twenties. Young and impressionable, full of hope.\n\nAnd the hope is dimmed.\n\nDARKHOOF paused for a moment and then looked at UNUS and then the\nothers like ASTRA, FIREHORN and then his optics coming to rest on\nWHEELIE. &quot;I left Raintree to watch after I left. She is really good at\nthat.&quot; He said, a small selfconscious smile on his face for a moment\nbefore he continued. &quot;Your friends . . . I mean the others with that\nsymbol that we were told to watch for, the wheeled vehicle.&quot;\n\nHe paused, &quot;Raintree said one of them called him Nightshift was\nheavilly damaged, another, the commander she thinks was also damaged\nheavily, but they escaped to their shuttle.&quot; DARKHOOF looked up at\nUNUS, &quot;Swoop was chasing them at the end as they took off. The shuttle\ntook heavy damage from Grimlock and Slag.&quot;\n\n&quot;What of the other, the dragon.&quot; UNUS said gently.\n\nDARKHOOF paused for a moment, obviously in communication with\nRAINTREE, &quot;She says that he was weakened by his battle with Grimlock\nand his men and was taken away by some of Magamtron&#39;s forces, led by\nGuiledart.&quot;\n\nUNUS nodded sagely. &quot;That is not good, that is not good at all.&quot; He\nlooked over at WHEELIE, &quot;Are there any more of your kind here? Perhaps\nyou warn them of what is going on?&quot;\n\nWhich is ofcourse an interesting proposition, except that despite the\nfact that the Cornu appear to be communicating, the Maximal (and\nPredacon) radio&#39;s still appear to still be down.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
