These codes won&#39;t work.  They may be able get\nthrough the energy shield but my new organic shiled only reacts to the\ncodes. That is why I had them specially numbered and incripted. I\nunderstand from your bio that you are the tech master here at Chivtron\nand feel free to remain that. My function is defense strictly and that\nis what i am doing. Now please don&#39;t get jealous that I was able to\nget the shields up and protect the base where you couldn&#39;t.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt;     He stands out of sight on the bridge watching as people get\ntheir codes.\n&gt; He walks off to an auxiliary computer.  &quot;He comes in and thinks he\nruns this\n&gt; tech operation now.  We&#39;ll see about that.&quot;  He uses the computer to\ntake a\n&gt; look at the program creating and controlling the shielding codes.\n&gt; &quot;Interesting work, I&#39;m almost impressed.&quot;  He then sets about a\nflurry of\n&gt; programing to duplicate the program.  It didn&#39;t take very long\nbecause he had\n&gt; a template by looking at Grounded&#39;s program.  He then created four\ncodes.  He\n&gt; connected himself to the computer and downloaded one code.  With\nthat done he\n&gt; sets up a fire wall so that only he can get at this new program.  He\nopens a\n&gt; tight band com to Aerotaur, Perplex, and Windlord.  &quot;Please come to my\n&gt; position.&quot;  He was going to offer a code to Nightlight but he had\nseen her\n&gt; receive one from Grounded.\n\n\n"}}
