Why would Dracona do this? She couldn&#39;t be rep=\r\nrogrammed, she had a device that could prevent it. Plintissa knew that her =\r\nonly friend was against her.\n\n  &quot;Artist, we have to go back and try to conv=\r\nince Dracona.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n  &quot;I agree, we must face danger, and not fl=\r\nee. Oops.&quot; Artist said. Plintissa snickered.\n\n  &quot;It&#39;s okay, Artist, if you =\r\nhave to rhyme, then rhyme.&quot; Plintissa said. Artist smiled and both of them =\r\nreturned to Team Ultima&#39;s base.\n\n  Dracona looked to Train Wreck.\n\n  &quot;YOU! =\r\nWhat are you doing?&quot; Dracona yelled. Train Wreck smiled.\n\n  &quot;Stealing your =\r\nequipment, what does it look like?&quot; Train Wreck said. Dracona growled.\n\n  &quot;=\r\nI thought I reprogrammed you!&quot; Dracona said.\n\n  &quot;Yeah? I used your own inve=\r\nntion against you! And I used it on my friends, too!&quot; Train Wreck said. Arr=\r\now stepped up by Train Wreck. They both looked at Blender and Stronghold. B=\r\n;ender walks up. Stronghold does. Stronghold reaches out and grabs Train Wr=\r\neck, forcing him down and sticking a rifle to the back of his head. Blender=\r\n grabs Arrow and drags him down as well.\n\n  &quot;Sorry old friends, but Dracona=\r\n&#39;s deal is a BETTER deal!&quot; Blender said.\n\n  &quot;Outside, I don&#39;t want any bloo=\r\nd in the base.&quot;  Dracona said. Train Wreck and Arrow were drug outside. Tra=\r\nin Wreck suddenly lurched out and hit Blender. Stronghold was hit by Arrow,=\r\n who had escaped. Stronghold and Blender chased Arrow and Train Wreck into =\r\nthe jungle. Stronghold struggles with Train Wreck. Arrow is hit so hard by =\r\nBlender he is put into stasis lock. Train Wreck is beat senseless by both o=\r\nf S.A.B. Inc. (Stronghold and Blender Incompany.) Train Wreck tries all of =\r\nhis submissions but Stronghold and Blender always save each other. Train Wr=\r\neck is held in the air by Stronghold. Blender laughs. Train Wreck is almost=\r\n dead, his mech fluid is flooding the jungle and is almost drowning Arrow. =\r\nBlender pops a spinning saw blade from his forearm and slams it through Tra=\r\nin Wreck. Stronghold drops Train Wreck and laughs. Blender reaches down and=\r\n snaps Train Wreck&#39;s neck. Blender and Stronghold bow to each other and tur=\r\nn to Arrow. Arrow wakes up for a few seconds and looks at them.\n\n  &quot;Wha?&quot; A=\r\nrrow asks. Stronghold reaches out and looks into a hole. He sweeps all of T=\r\nrain Wreck&#39;s mech fluid into it.\n\n  &quot;Sayonara ass!&quot; Blender said. Stronghol=\r\nd jumps into the pit of mech fluid and sticks Arrow&#39;s head under. Arrow fin=\r\nally stops struggling. Stronghold drops Arrow and Blender kicks him. They b=\r\noth laugh and walk back towards Team Ultima base. They both take out cigars=\r\n and smoke them in satisfaction of their acompishments.\n\n  Stranato suddenl=\r\ny grabs his chest in pain. Airbomber stares at him. Stranato suddenly start=\r\ns changing form. Stranato now looks a little different. Airbomber screams a=\r\nnd is also slightly morphed.\n\n  &quot;What does this mean?&quot; Airbomber asked Stra=\r\nnato.\n\n  &quot;It means that...Train Wreck and Arrow are dead. I can feel it.&quot; S=\r\ntranato said.\n\n  &quot;What? How?&quot; Airbomber said desperatley.\n\n  &quot;It appears ou=\r\nr plan didn&#39;t work out.&quot; Stranato said.\n\n  &quot;Plan?&quot; Airbomber replies.\n\n  &quot;Y=\r\nes, none of the Radiocns were reprogrammed really.&quot; Stranato replied sadly.=\r\n\n\n  &quot;Then why are Train Wreck and Arrow dead?&quot; Airbomber asked.\n\n  &quot;They we=\r\nre killed...by Stronghold and Blender.&quot; Stranato replied sadly.\n\n  &quot;WHAT! O=\r\nur friends killed out friends!?!?!?!?&quot; Airbomber said.\n\n  &quot;Sadly, yes, they=\r\n betrayed us, but out friends, now live on in us.&quot; Stranato said.\n\n  &quot;Huh?&quot;=\r\n Airbomber questioned.\n\n  &quot;Their sparks joined in with ours, we now posses =\r\ntheir power, the Radicons are no more, let us say goodbye to our good frien=\r\nds as their spiritual sparks head toward the Matrix. Airbomber and Stranato=\r\n stood in silence, saluting Arrow and Train Wreck. Airbomber puts his arm a=\r\nround Infectra and cries. Stranato also cannot keep character, and is cryin=\r\ng as well.\n\n  Gangon starts to fade away, realizing he isn&#39;t wanted anymore=\r\n.\n   \n  Lightmare&#39;s spark floats slowly toward the Matrix, unsure if she wa=\r\nnts to go there. Arrow and Train Wreck&#39;s sparks come by. Lightmare&#39;s spark =\r\nnotices them. The former Radicons floated into the Matrix. Lightmare&#39;s spar=\r\nk lit up and followed them.\n\n  Deemos and Inzoola sit there VERY bored. The=\r\ny couldn&#39;t believe that nobody was paying attention to them!\n\n  &quot;I don&#39;t be=\r\nlieve this, how can they treat me like this!?&quot; Deemos yelled.\n\n  &quot;If your b=\r\nored, we could always go find a spot and...be alone.&quot; Inzola said. Deemos j=\r\nust stared coldly. Inzola frowned, she knew Deemos felt unimportant, but ri=\r\nght now he was making her feel pretty unimportant, too!\n\n  Sinesis is still=\r\n healing up in the CR Chamber of Team Ultima base.\n\n  Dracona calls Zardus =\r\non her comm unit.\n\n  &quot;Zardus, this is former Alliance warrior Dracona, I wi=\r\nsh to make...an Alliance with the Alliance.&quot; She said.\n\n  Plintissa noticed=\r\n Stronghold and Blender, she and Artist slowly sneaking up behind them.\n\n  =\r\nSinister is &quot;Alone&quot; with Blizzard...\n\n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_065D_01BFFB5B.C1390B00\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;~~~~~~~~~~Infectra/T=\r\nwister~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;*Infectra frowns and=\r\n puts her arms around Airbomber.
