Soon he \narrives at Megatron, &quot;Hey Megs, whadda ya want me to do?&quot; He says \nthen takes a closer look at the bots with Megatron. One that was \nquite damaged, he didn&#39;t know. The other however, was... Shockwave?!? \nHe stopped looking before it became a stare and waits impassively for \nMegatron&#39;s response.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;We are too vulnerable right now to launch attacks.&quot; Megatron turned\n&gt; around, showing the base. &quot;It is right in the open, where the \nStunticons\n&gt; landed it. They may be formidable warriors, but they have no sense \nof\n&gt; defense.&quot; Megatron opened his com-link once again. &quot;Switchblade, I \nneed\n&gt; you out here on the double.&quot; He looked at Shockwave. &quot;Switchblade \ncan\n&gt; fix him.&quot; he commented.\n\n\n"}}
