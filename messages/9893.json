He called her a logical bot, obviously feeding into \nher ego.\n&gt;     &quot;Megatron, I want nothing more than to see the Predacons \nvictorious in \n&gt; all things. I know by us joining forces we could make it happen. \nAll I ask is \n&gt; I be your sub-commander. If you refuse, I will kill Quickstrike \nnow, and take \n&gt; the Darkside files and destroy them.&quot; She said, very \ndiplomatically. She was \n&gt; dealing with Megatron, and even though in the past they rarely got \nalong she \n&gt; knew he was the better leader.\n&gt;     Waiting for a response she turned to see the fuzor in the \nshafts agian. \n&gt; &quot;What dose he think this is? A game of cat and mouse? He&#39;ll have to \nbe \n&gt; immobilized until negotiations are settled. I wouldnt want him to \ndo \n&gt; something that might give his fraction the upper hand...&quot; She said.\n&gt;     Aracnia, still in the command chair, brought over a keypad. On \nit, she \n&gt; initiated the ventalation patrol sentinels. They were small \nspherical bots \n&gt; who hovered through out the vent. If a foreign object was found \nwithin the \n&gt; vent, they would use a high powered electrical charge to stun \nwhatever it was \n&gt; based on size, weight, and mass. They would keep the fuzor busy at \nleast for \n&gt; awhile. After all, such small bots as those were easy to get rid of \nwith one \n&gt; good blast. \n&gt;     &quot;That should do the trick. They will swarm him in minutes. As \nfor the \n&gt; rat, shes gone I belive. And, just in case she wants to come back \nin....&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia initiated a force feild around the hatch door \ncontianing the \n&gt; hole. Darkmouse would need to find another way into the ship is she \nwas to \n&gt; rescue her beloved Quickstrike.\n\n\n"}}
