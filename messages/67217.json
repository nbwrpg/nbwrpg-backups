As silent as death and as smooth as silk\nthey make their way through the earth&#39;s skies. At first careful only to\njust barely touch the inside the atmosphere, like a stone skipping off\na blue lit pond, and then with increasing boldness they slip within the\nembrace of earthï¿½s atmosphere, to watch with great interest the\ninhabitants of this planet. \n\nInvisible to the optic and sensor alike the silent invaders take\npassive scans of the limping prison ship, the damaged orbital factory\nand the plethora of biological and technological forms on the planet\nbelow. Like a whispering vapor they examine and move about, and then\njust as suddenly as they have come, they vanish. \n\nBut they will return ....\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nOOC: I would suspect that if anyone is monitoring from Cryonosis, they\nmay have picked up something, but only intermittantly, and with no\ndefinite readings. It could be mistaken for fog, only it was moving. It\nwould take someone skilled and awake at thier post to see even this\nmuch. \n\nOOC: THE PRISON SHIP - Did you want to be part of this as well? I could\nignore you if you like or bring you and your prisoners in on it as\nwell? It may not happen next post, but I am just curious.\n\nOOC: I hope to be posting the next move for Cyclonus, Scourge and the\ncrew perhaps tommorrow. If Nic is unable to post, I certainly\nunderstand, and if he does not want me to auto Vorpal, I can understand\nthat too. Nightstrike, did you want to come along if Vorpal is unable\nto respond in time? In either case I will bring us to earth, and all\nthe fun that will bring! &gt;:)\n\nPreston\n(Minions!)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
