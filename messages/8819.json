He didn&#39;t know how the \nMaximals would set the timeline straight, but everything must have \nturned out right, he still existed. \n\nIt was later in the day, the sun wasn&#39;t beating down as much. He was \nlonely. A lone wolf in a pack, a duck without a flocking group to \njoin. (It&#39;s a comparison, he didn&#39;t accualy turn into a duck.) He \nremembered his first day as a wolf, the pack recognized him as alien \nto thier group and chased him off.\n\n&quot;Theres gotta be others&quot; he said out loud to himself remembering \nStriker. If Striker existed then why not other wolves? If not for his \npledge of loyalty as it was, to Ramulus he&#39;d set out right now to \nfind his answers. Duty came first, before friendship, before \ninformation, even before his own personal feelings.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She stepped out of the chamber.
