Well,\ntell you what, i&#39;ll tag along with your friend if you still want her to be\nyour partner!&quot; Lightmare said.

You have that affect on me baby, your great!&quot; Gangon said. &quot;What?&quot;\nLightmare said disgustingly. Gangon looked at Lightmare. &quot;Your still welcome\nto come with us though.&quot; Gangon said. &quot;What?&quot; Lightmare said. &quot;I&#39;m sure you\nneed a partner, Lightmare, now you can have two!&quot; Gangon said. &quot;WHAT?&quot;\nLightmare said.

That\n&gt; just wasn&#39;t her way of doing things. She would brood about it on her own\n&gt; time, as she had about other things that had caused her to become\nstressed.\n&gt; BrightBlade then opened her com-link to Gangon.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll just leave you and...your new partner to your...amusements. See ya\n&gt; back at base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * The last sentence was a bit bitter and harsh but she really didn&#39;t care,\n&gt; as long as she was understood.\n&gt; She then walked away from the direct approach towards the base and soon\n&gt; began to take the longer way, a way that would give her enough time to\n&gt; think.And a way that would give her great distance from the...pair.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Never lose a file again.
