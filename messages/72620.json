I mean WE watchers we sent back by the council to\nkeep an optic on things. At first we were to chronicle the unfolding\nevents here on Earth, but never to interfere. To observe how the\nhumans and other life forms progressed and catalog all we found and\nsend word back to Cybertron.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER shook his head, &quot;But then the Mephilis crash landed setting\nuntold number of criminals free on Earth and it changed our entire\nmission.&quot;\n\nOOC: Sandy, feel free to read to read the background and history on\nour wikisite. But treat it as rumor as I am changing a few things -\nNot BIG changes, but small subtle  things. So some things might not be\nquite true.\n\nhttp://www.wikihost.org//w/nbwrpg_wiki/summary\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
