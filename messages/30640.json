She stood up and heard \nReptilica ask about her.  She went to transform into her leopard mode \nout of habit, and instead, transformed into a cat mode. But it looked \nlike she was a chrome panther or something.  She looked at herself \nand sighed. &quot;No, it&#39;s no good. I&#39;m completely without a mode. It&#39;s \nuseless. I&#39;m useless.&quot;  She transformed into bot mode and walked off \nthe shuttle.  She was still stunning, but without a beast mode, she \nwas all  in chrome.  \n\n\n"}}
