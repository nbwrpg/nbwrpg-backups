I - just picked up another Autobot si=\r\ngnature... It&#39;s Night Shift, he made it... He actually made it out of that =\r\nlast skirmish unharmed..  According to the transmission I&#39;m getting, he&#39;s a=\r\nt the old Maximal base.  Night Shift is specially trained in Special Ops mi=\r\nssion work.  When in doubt send in a specialist.  Prowl and Mirage trained =\r\nhim personally, and with your guidence and his help, I think we have a good=\r\n chance at doing things without being discovered. Night Shift also knows ho=\r\nw to pretend.  One time, he actually cloaked his Autobot symbol and made it=\r\n appear Decepticon so he could sneak around Megatron without being suspecte=\r\nd of double crossing.....  Wait a minute...  Kup, what if he did that for u=\r\ns again?  What if he went in as a pretender, cloaked the Decepticon faction=\r\n symbol and his signature to match theirs, could he actually pull off a res=\r\ncue right under their noses?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We will get them back My friend&quot;Said camly the m=\r\nale&quot;We must to plan it well in order to dont have another mia&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From=\r\n: Sandy \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 16, 2010 11:31 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n&gt; Subject: Re: Back to the Ark\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Before he could answer Kup=\r\n, Tucson listens to the voice of the Matrix,Kup and to Lord Elder. Once aga=\r\nin they had caught him just in time to pull him from what could have been a=\r\nn emotional disaster. He was thankful for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I guess I don&#39;t know=\r\n the difference between being too self absorbed and when it&#39;s all right to =\r\nactually state how valuable one self is to a cause. I have to stop doubting=\r\n myself as far as worth is concerned. I&#39;ll kick myself in the aft to improv=\r\ne if I have to.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He then thinks about his disability and pauses for j=\r\nust a moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Well, now that I need to kind of change gears for a mo=\r\nment, I suppose I should see myself as an innovator, who&#39;s self worth is ra=\r\nther valuable to the cause of turning things around for everyone and not ju=\r\nst for himself. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m a God, and that to me would be far too f=\r\netched. But now, if I were to rate my self worth, I&#39;d say my role as an Aut=\r\nobot is valuable. If I had not persisted in trying to find out what happene=\r\nd to Rodimus, not only would I not have found him, I would not have been ab=\r\nle to stop the same thing from happening to others. And now that I do reali=\r\nze what&#39;s going on, and the fact that I could have nearly fallen down the s=\r\name path, which I hope never to do, thanks to all of you, and the voice I k=\r\neep hearing, I can finally do some real good around here. And I promise, I&#39;=\r\nll work with each and every one of you, to the best of my abilities,\n&gt; and =\r\ntry to come up with new ways upon which to do so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Another pause.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot; Now that I&#39;ve woken up a bit, I suppose I&#39;d like to be able to see again=\r\n, I just haven&#39;t really gotten around to asking someone on how to repair my=\r\n visual circuitry... Heh, truth is, I&#39;m one of the biggest procrastinators =\r\non Cybertron. I guess I&#39;ve just been putting it off too long, after getting=\r\n used to not having my sight, it just became second nature to me. And in so=\r\nme respects, perhaps I did not want to actually &quot;See&quot; the truth of the situ=\r\nation. And of course, major confession coming out here... At the time, Ratc=\r\nhet was doing repairs and well I didn&#39;t want to burden him with anything...=\r\n He had enough going on. After a while I completely forgot and then another=\r\n major war happened and before I knew it I lost track of time.. But now the=\r\nre is time for the repair. I just need to have my circuitry examined before=\r\n it is repaired...

He\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; lost the energy matrix and himself in that loss. He will need your\n&gt; &gt; he=\r\nlp to remember his own value. Only then can the power of the matrix\n&gt; &gt; hel=\r\np him.
