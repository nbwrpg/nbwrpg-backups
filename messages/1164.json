He would like to \nhire our services for a blank protoform.  Send him back a message, saying we \nwill send three people.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who are the three?&quot;\n\n&quot;Breakdown, Hiss, and Pyro, Pyro you will fix up first.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very well, Dark One.&quot;\n::Hiss began to make a laser beam communication, sending out a transmission \nthat went as followed:\n\n&lt;Unknown employeer, we are currently busy, but will send three members of our \nteam to help your comrade.  We do not know if that will be enough, or soon \nenough.  They should arrive in one mega-cycle.  Reply if that does not suit \nyour needs&gt;\n\n::Dark One went up to Zardus::\n&quot;I believe we proved ourselves well.  So, for thirty lunar cycles (days) we \nwill require a certain sum of energon.  Then at the end of that thirty \nperiod, we have the option of re-negotiating that contract or closing it.  We \nalso hold the right to be employeed by other people, as long as it does not \naffect your team, as in we will not attack any of its members unless \nnecessary, and we will not attack your base or any of your lands.  I trust \nyou will find those terms acceptable.&quot;\n\n"}}
