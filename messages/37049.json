HE stands silently and looks outside a nearby window \nand sighs thinking of Cybertron and what was happening on the planet. \nHe goes into a daze as he remembers the events that transpired a \nshort time before his arrival... He was running... running from a \nmenace unlike anything the cybertronians had faced, they were small \nrobotic arachnids that were given the name replicators by their \noriginal creators who the Infecticons had destroyed. They transported \nthe things to Cybertron during a great battle between the Maximal and \nPredacon fleets. There they used the very metal the planet was made \nof to Replicate. Before anyone could notice there was over a billion \nlurking in the depths of Cybertron. Zero recalls the sky of cybertron \nwhen the Infecticons broke through the combined Maximal and Predacon \nfleet... they were red with fire, all over ships of energy and metal \nwe slamming into buildings, and if that wasnt enough the Replicators \nmade their presence known on the southern half of the planet and \nquickly overtook it. Zero himself was on the planets equator. Above \nhim an Infecticon Marauder with several Deathgliders and Abyss&#39; were \nchasing down a squadron of Maximal Blurr fighters. Before he knew it \nhe was surrounded by Infecticon Infantry each firing plasma blasts at \nhim and his Partner. Both bots began a mad dash for a bunker that had \nbeen established in the city as a last defense against the \nreplicators and ground troops. However before they could get there \nthey were blocked off by Replicators. They both ducked into another \nalley but were faced with dead end. Zero watched helpessly as his \nfriend panicked beside him and ran out of the alley only to be cut \ndown by an uncountable number of blasts, the only part of him left \nwas a hand. Zero Turned and activated his boosters which were blasted \na sometime before hand and were severely damaged. He slowly rose into \nthe air when a bright flash erupted from beneath him. A portal. \nBefore he knew what was happenening he was blasted from behind and \nsent barreling down into the portal. That was where his day dream \nended.. and upon its conclusion Zero fell to his knees and clnched \nhis fists in anger as he placed his ehad against the wall trying to \nsupress the memory...\n\n\n\n&gt;In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Arrow: I killed them.
