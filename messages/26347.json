There was \nsomething he couldn&#39;t remember, something about a TF city a long long \ntime ago. That was strange. Prowl could usually remember most things \nin his life, yet he didn&#39;t think he was a Maximal during that memory. \nHe frowns, storing that thought on secondary datattracks to tend to \nit later.\n\n&quot;Hmm... Yes, I like the sound of that. Especially the wall. We can \ntransfer all the CF defences onto it.&quot; Prowl turns his head to look \nat Epyon. &quot;Are your ship&#39;s shields functional?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Epyon::\n&gt; \n&gt; He didn&#39;t like being ignored, and walked with Prowl.\n&gt; &quot;You are right. Maybe we can merge them here. There is enough of the\n&gt; StarJumper to turn this into a battle city. We could use the CF as \nthe\n&gt; main part. Then we could build complexes around that. And surrond \nall\n&gt; that will heavy weapons, and probably a wall.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; He followed Prowl, and Epyon. He liked this idea.\n&gt; &quot;Prowl, this sounds good.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
