It&#39;s good to be back in the swing of things! Oh, and Yanshosh...it was very kind of you to put IR in a CR chamber while my Hot Mail problem was going on.\nThanx!)\n\n* Zyber sniffed the wind and still followed the sent of some strange being.*\n( I&#39;m still a little off track, I&#39;m not sure if Striker&#39;s still out there. Sorry if I&#39;m wrong.)\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor sighed and opened her optics a little, what had happened? She noted that she was in a CR chamber but that was about all that made sense, she snarled as she felt the pain in her neck and chest. She knew that the healing process was not yet complete.\nIron Raptor sighed and gasped, she said through clenched teeth.*\n\n&quot; Computer, how did I get here?&quot;\n\n* With a slightly muffled tome the computer responded.*\n\nCOMP: &quot;Subject Prowl has brought primary subject to CR chambers.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor closed her optics as a tired and warn sleep began to overtake her, another favor that she owed her Maximal friend. But as she was injured she made a personal note to check on everybot when she had recovered, even though she was no longer in command she still cared about the wellbeing of the Maximal troops.\nBesides, if it wasn&#39;t for them the Alliance would have total control over the Ark as well as the Preds. Even though they had lost the base was still theirs! So in truth, did they truly loose?\nIron Raptor quickly slipped into a dreamless sleep but was thankful that Prowl had saved her life.*\n\n( OK, Someone wanted me to say the damage that the Ark got...well here it is:\nStructural damage to the roof and main side, a few more gashes and holes to the left side of the ship. A few systems such as...uh...secondary scanners and autoguns 1 through 3 have been knocked off line. I think that that&#39;s about fair. Besides, the Maximals will have their hands full with just the first two.\nWell, there it is.)\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
