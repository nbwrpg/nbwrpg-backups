However, the tiny \nfur-ball was relitively new to her.\nChuckling to herself as she sees Shadow Cat give her brother slag.\nThey were bothing just like she remembered them to be. Shadow Cat so serious \nat times and then have her own sense of humor�Snow Tech just seeming to be a \nwalking joke.\nBut when Shadow Cat turned to her she blushed.*\n\n� Yeah, I guess I have.�\n\n* Looking at a whist of hair that fell over her eyes, simply moving it out \nof the way.\nIron Raptor steps back though when the fembot moves towards her to give her \na hug, never really seeming like one who liked them.\nIn the old days she had never liked sentimant, and now that she was with \nProwl she really didn�t think it was that bad. But she only didn�t mind it \nfrom him, everyone else�she didn�t think so. Then smiling while she falls \nand yells at her brother.*\n\n&lt; Hopeless.&gt;\n\n* She thinks to herself.\nShe didn�t see Snow Tech get to his feet and dust himself on, looking in \nsurprise as he had grabbed her arm.\nIron Raptor looked at Snow Tech as if she thought he was crazy as he spoke \nto Prowl, then her look turned into a smile and she laughed at what he said.\nThis really WAS Snow Tech.\nShe doesn�t move to get her arm out of his grasp, knowing that he was simply \njoking around as usual.\nBut then Iron Raptor�s laugh dies away to a chuckle and then nothing as she \nfeels Prowls anger, simply looking at him in surprise as she feels the anger \ncoming from him. It hadn�t numbed her like last time because she hadn�t just \ncome out of battle rage, it just come this time.\nBut then Iron Raptor got a little edgy when Prowl had taken a step towards \nSnow Tech, wondering why he was acting to hostile to a silly joke.\nShe saw him take out and point his wing missiles towards Snow Tech, her \nexpression turning angry as well but not as enraged as Prowls.\n\n&lt; What do you think you�re doing?&gt;\n\nBut then Iron Raptor answers Prowls question.\n\n&lt; It�s just a joke, love. He does that all the time.&gt;\n\nHer attention then caught by Snow Tech as he speaks to her.\nBut then as everything wore on she simply rolled her eyes and shook her \nhead.\nThey were both turning out to be complete idiots�.\nStepping out from between the shield that Snow Tech had just activated she \ngave Prowl  look that said everything, he was acting just like a child along \nwith her friend.\nSimply stepping off to the side and crossing her arms, looking at both of \nthem from under her bangs.\n\n&lt; Why don�t you two just get into a pissing contest and get it over with?&gt;\n\nBut she just stood there as Prowl simply walked over to her as if nothing \nhappened, sliding an arm around her.\nShe wasn�t impressed at all, by any of them.\n\n&lt; I�m waiting for my friends first, so we can get back to base together.&gt;\n\nIron Raptor then looked towards Snow Tech, glad to at least have the weapons \nput away and emotions not so powerful as before.*\n\n� We�re going back to base now, Snow Tech, maybe Shadow Cat can fly you?�\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
