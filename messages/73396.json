This must happen ta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; r=\r\neptiles all the time. I&#39;ve even heard of spiders shedding skins if you can\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that. Ughhh.. I bet Tarantulus does that too, when he&#39;s in =\r\nspider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mode. Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, dragons are thought =\r\nta breathe fire,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but you don&#39;t seem ta do that huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Tucson shakes his head.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; No, but I do recall being able =\r\nto produce some electrical particles using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same principle . And=\r\n when I roar, it mimics the sound of thunder. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suspect the old dra=\r\ngon was some sort of elemental master. He breathes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lightning and ro=\r\nars out thunder through his vocal chords.

Ya never know, your first kid might end up=\r\n being a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dragon, or ya might get lucky and have one of each.

Reptiles a=\r\nnd birds normally produce eggs that hatch when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they&#39;ve fully develo=\r\nped. The only exception is, that some snake species\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually bare l=\r\nive young. Now that could happen too, but for the most part,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dragon=\r\ns lay eggs and so do birds. Soooo, you guys might just produce a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sm=\r\nall clutch of eggs that need ta be incubated over a course of time. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; dunno, its just some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve read that too at one po=\r\nint. You&#39;re correct, it could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen that way. Which makes me curio=\r\nus as to other organic properties I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be experiencing.. Like =\r\nhunger... I admit, I snapped up a fish from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a near by water source =\r\nand I consumed it in beast mode. And the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mammals for some odd=\r\n reason sparked my appetite. But I didn&#39;t have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spark to hunt th=\r\nem. I merely got a meal from the water instead. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar no=\r\nds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Confession, I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In=\r\n beast mode of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course. And it tasted really good too. I bet Stanton=\r\n would know what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happening to us, right Stanton?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As TUCSON and NIGHTSHIFT talked a troubled expression was =\r\non BUMP&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; face.

It&#39;=\r\nll make us all the more formidable against our enemies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Tucson nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If I may, I want their wishes fully gran=\r\nted and acted upon.

This further loosens up dull scale like f=\r\nilm which comes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off like silver translucent material, si=\r\nmilar to what a snake sheds.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Beneath it, brilliant shimm=\r\nering scales emerge. It was like he was slowly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolving =\r\nbeneath an old skin. And as serpents do, his tail seems to grow a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; tiny bit longer with the shedding of his old skin. Yet this was o=\r\nnly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happening in his beast mode.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Hmm.. Talon, could you scratch behind my neck for me? It&#39;s=\r\n the one place&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t reach. I&#39;ve never encountered she=\r\ndding, and this must be what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to the old dragon =\r\nfrom time to time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar looks to t=\r\nhe shed material curiously and paws at it. He finds it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nard like metal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Woah, it got really=\r\n hard. Like armor almost. Neat. This must happen ta&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rept=\r\niles all the time. I&#39;ve even heard of spiders shedding skins if you can&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that. Ughhh.. I bet Tarantulus does that too, when =\r\nhe&#39;s in spider&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode. Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, d=\r\nragons are thought ta breathe fire,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but you don&#39;t seem t=\r\na do that huh?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson shakes his hea=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; No, but I do recall being able t=\r\no produce some electrical particles using&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same princ=\r\niple . And when I roar, it mimics the sound of thunder. I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; suspect the old dragon was some sort of elemental master. He breathes&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lightning and roars out thunder through his vocal chords. I=\r\n&#39;m beginning to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think he may have past that down to me.&quot;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar chuckles.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; That means when you and Talon have a family, your offs=\r\npring is gonna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inherit that ability. Ya never know, your=\r\n first kid might end up being a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon, or ya might get =\r\nlucky and have one of each. But if it does take&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after de=\r\nar old dad, better make sure it&#39;s not a fire breather.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson chuckles and rubs his paw on Uproars head, messin=\r\ng up his fur in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playful manner.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; We&#39;ll see, don&#39;t count the dragons before they hatch.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar continues to laugh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; No, seriously, dragons are known ta have more t=\r\nhan just one offspring.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They&#39;re like gators and crocs, t=\r\nhey tend to have a clutch of eggs that hatch&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into hatchl=\r\nings. Reptiles and birds normally produce eggs that hatch when&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; they&#39;ve fully developed. The only exception is, that some snake spec=\r\nies&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually bare live young. Now that could happen too,=\r\n but for the most part,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dragons lay eggs and so do birds=\r\n. Soooo, you guys might just produce a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; small clutch of e=\r\nggs that need ta be incubated over a course of time. I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\nunno, its just some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; It=\r\n&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve read that too at one point. You&#39;re correct, it could&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; happen that way. Which makes me curious as to other organic p=\r\nroperties I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be experiencing.. Like hunger... I a=\r\ndmit, I snapped up a fish from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a near by water source an=\r\nd I consumed it in beast mode. And the other&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mammals for=\r\n some odd reason sparked my appetite. But I didn&#39;t have the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; spark to hunt them. I merely got a meal from the water instead. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar nods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &quot; Confession, I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mode=\r\n of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course. And it tasted really good too. I bet Stanton=\r\n would know what&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happening to us, right Stanton?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As TUCSON=\r\n and NIGHTSHIFT talked a troubled expression was on BUMP&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fa=\r\nce. He glanced over at SANTON who only nodded.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;You must be careful.&quot; SANTON said as he and BUMP carefully prepared&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; NIGHTSHIFT in an effort to cure him of the spreading metallic&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; infection. &quot;Despite the fact that we have these beast modes we ar=\r\ne not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; truly organic life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; BUMP =\r\nnodded, &quot;We still have gyro stabilizers instead of fluid based&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; inner ear chambers. We have energon pumps instead of organic hearts.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; He shook his head, &quot;We are not truely beasts with genetic codes =\r\nwho&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lay eggs and such.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There wa=\r\ns a pause as BUMP reached over to pull a sensor closer to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; NIG=\r\nHTSHIFT, &quot;Just because the natural animals do certain things&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndoesn&#39;t mean that we do.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; SANTON said, =\r\n&quot;We do not become animals, we only simulate them&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; closely enou=\r\ngh that we become virtually indistinguishable from them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I have analyzed the infection.&quot; LEGACY said as he turned and f=\r\naced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the others folding his arms behind his back. &quot;This &#39;infe=\r\nction&#39; is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; trying to terminate you Nightshift.&quot; LEGACY sai=\r\nd in cold&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; matter-of-fact tones. &quot;It is trying to strip you of=\r\n all your organic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; componants to make you completely Cybertron=\r\nian.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Pre=\r\nston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!--=\r\n end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-9DB92F57-B0C7-4407-9E65-E28429793503--\r\n\n"}}
