He was quickly losing the Maximal \n&gt; bacause Firearm had to deal with avoiding the Energonians&#39; gunfire.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; EndBringer manages to stabalize himself in space, flying toward \n&gt; Astroblast.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther stops in midflight, recieving an order from Killfest to \n&gt; retreat. He activates his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Pinsir, Incarcinator, meet me back at the shuttle, we&#39;re getting out \n&gt; of here,&quot; he says into the comm, boosting back toward the shuttle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator growls, continuing to try and crush Prowl in his grasp. \n&gt; The Maximals armor was very strong, but that didn&#39;t stop Incarcinator \n&gt; from continuing to try to squeeze Prowl to death. He feels Prowl&#39;s \n&gt; palms pushing on him to try to get him away, but the Maximal had no \n&gt; chance of success with just pushing.

His grip on Prowl fails, the \n&gt; bot choking on some mechfluid and going into stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl pulls the daggers out of Incarcinator, boosting off back toward \n&gt; the battle and leaving the stasis-locked bot floating toward earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thanks, Bluestreak,&quot; he says, looking back at the four streams of \n&gt; mechfluid emerging from Incarcinator&#39;s body.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Greven and Demise also recieve Killfest&#39;s transmission, but their \n&gt; shuttle had been destroyed when they arrived.
