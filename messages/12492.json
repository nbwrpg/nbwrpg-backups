Currently, the majority of his troops were gone. Where could they be?\nHe\n&gt; was agrivated enough. Taking his commlink, &quot;Predacons, sound off. Give\nyour\n&gt; current location and status.&quot; He demanded, a tone of anger in his deep,\ntact\n&gt; voice.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Black Aracnia rumaged in the store room until she found the box\ncotaining\n&gt; the body parts of Tarantulas. It was actually marked, DO NOT OPEN UNDER\nANY\n&gt; CIRCUMSTANCES! SIGNED TRANSANULAS. That bastard had him here the whole\ntime...\n&gt;     She dragged the bow out of the room, and was going to take it to the\n&gt; engin room. Somehow, possibly a subconscience kick in the head by\nTarantulas,\n&gt; she knew she would find what she was looking for in there.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
