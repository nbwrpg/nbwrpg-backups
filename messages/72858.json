THe\n&gt; Cybertronian &#39;senses&#39; were just mechanical approximations, they were still\n&gt; electronic based.  Enhanced hearing would work, but not using sonar for\n&gt; aerial pings.  Using telescopic enhanced vision would work, but not using an\n&gt; infrared scanner.  Whomever had set up this blocking system was incredibly\n&gt; specific for whatever reason, with what systems oeprated and what ones did\n&gt; not.  However, she was able to begin to backtrack over towards the source of\n&gt; it, and use the spikes of increased blocking to try and..  Track it&#39;s source\n&gt; more effectively, just going in the direction where she could sense less.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIt was not that enhanced senses worked in one form but not the other,\nbut it was the way that they worked that changed. In robot mode the\nsensors tended to be active, sending out beams of varying energies to\nbe bounced back and read for analysis. In beast mode these tended to\nbe more passive, absorbing what was already there.\n\nFor the most part it has been radio and sonar waves that had been cut\noff in the beginning but as they approached the cave other sensor\ntypes were being muffled more, escpecially the active ones until they\nwere nearly gone.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT gave a low bow, &quot;In the tunnels, Sir, I will lead you down towards\n&gt; where we were going with the others.  I can lead us or we can let one of the\n&gt; MAXIMALS go down.  Perhpas if the PRIME would care to take point down\n&gt; through the caveners?  It seems we can trace things simply by where we\n&gt; cannot trace them effectively.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME frowned for a moment as he thought about it.\n\n&quot;That sounds like an excellent plan.&quot; CRYOTEK said as he looked at LEO.\n\nSKYSHADOW nodded as he smiled mischievously, &quot;Of course.&quot; He gestured\nto t LEO, &quot;After you Maximal Prime.&quot;\n\n&quot;No problem, we&#39;ve got this.&quot; BANTOR said as he glanced at LEO and\nTORCA the FUSZOR commander.\n\nLEO PRIME nodded, &quot;Let&#39;s go, it&#39;s time to end this. Staying out here\ntalking is not helping.&quot;\n\nWith a resolute step LEO PRIME began to lead the others down. He could\nalso feel the change in his sensors, their loss of effectiveness as he\nturned in different directions.\n\nAs the group ventured inside TORCA spoke softly, &quot;Why would someone\nallow their base of operations to be so readily located like this if\nit is suppose to be hidden in a cave?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
