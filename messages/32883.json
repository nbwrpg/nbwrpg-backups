This was a most \ndisapointing result for a plan, but he had anticipated this turn in \nevents. It was time for the Decepticons to move out of the vulnerable \nposition they were in. He remembered the G1 Predacon ship. He stepped \nout of Astroblast, and looked at his troops. &quot;Astroblast, I hope they \nare out of the jamming zone, radio Autofire, and tell him to meet me \nhere&quot;. He then looked at both the new robots.\n\n\nOOC:If so could you repost, also would my teamates mind if I posted \nfor him now?\n\nAbominus let out a anamalistic growl, and aimed both of his shoulder \ncannons at Galaxor, still on the ground, and lets loose a burst of \npower. &quot;Abominus....Cru....Crus.....Destroy&quot;, he uttered in a hollow \nempty voice.\n\n\n\n"}}
