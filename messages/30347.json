Speedbreaker dosent looked to bothered. &quot;Good to see you mighty\nMegatron&quot; he blurts.\n\n\nMegatron smiles at Cyclonus and Scourges faith. They were the ones he was\nmost worried about following him. This would be easier than he thought.\n\n\n\nMotormaster turns to Killfest, &quot;Do what you need to&quot; then he thinks\nhesitatnly, &quot;I&#39;ll do what I need to&quot;. Motormaster is having problems\nanalysing this. Plus, all he can hear is a roaring laughter. &quot;Shut up\nWildrider&quot; he yells, as he whirls his body around, bringing a fist into\nWildriders head, knocking his head from his shoulders. The smoking hole in\nthe top of the body, emits a sickening burning of circuits, and the body\nfalls down, as his computer mutters something about stasis lock.\n\nHe turns his attention to Megatron. &quot;How do I know you are the real thing?&quot;\nHe questions harshly. &quot;We never brought you back to life, and Astroblast\nsaw your damaged body thrown from him in the year 2005. We saw you come\nback as Galvatron. You cant be real&quot; he accuses, visibly upset that his\nleader, would be portrayed.\n\n\nHe stroms towards Scourge and Cyclonus, &quot;Get off your knees. He&#39;s not the\nreal thing,&quot; He yells at them. Then turns to Megatron, and points a finger\naccusingly. &quot;How dare you mock the memory of mighty Megatron, you cant be\nthe real thing&quot; he says, in rage.\n\n\n\n"}}
