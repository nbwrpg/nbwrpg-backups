Megatron never told him what \nto do, so that left him to monitor the other&#39;s work. While Waspinator passed \na few times by him, going back and forth; that made him a little dizzy. He \nstood outside of the cave, a few strides away from the mouth of it, watching \nthe horizon and other little things that needed to be observed.\n\nHe slowly turned his head, hearing that Scorponok was going to make a last \ntrip to Predacon base. &quot;Hey, while yer there, go t&#39; th&#39; CR room an&#39; bring \nback mah fur pelt ah left in there.&quot; he said to him, not looking him in the \neye.\n\nThen something came to his thoughts. &quot;Hey boss, what about that rat? Hell \nBeast already kill him?&quot; He crossed his arms.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
