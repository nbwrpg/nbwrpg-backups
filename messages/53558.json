Any tech-bot could do you that \nfavor - \n&gt; &gt; knowing our resident genius, Wheeljack-X, he&#39;d be happy to \nhelp.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A whispering voice causes her ears to prick up, despite knowing \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; there was nobody to make the sound - it&#39;s not coming through the \n&gt; air, \n&gt; &gt; but rather in her mind.  Empath blinks.  &quot;Did you hear something?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cocking a brow. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; she glanced about her. She was \nuneasy \n&gt; enough as it was, & now Empath had to make her even more uneasy. \n&gt; \n&gt; Wheeljack-X, huh? she thought. Seemed that if he would become \n&gt; involved that something may go wrong. But then again, if he was \nlike \n&gt; the Wheeljack she &#39;knew&#39;, then he was a genius is some form. But \n&gt; would he even attempt to return her to her former form?\n&gt; \n&gt; She moved a couple paces from Empath. &quot;Thank you. It seems I still \n&gt; have a lot to do.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; With that, she padded away from Empath. Walking past Windlord, not \n&gt; stopping. &quot;I ask at least that no one follows me, won&#39;t attract as \n&gt; much attention if I am unaccompanied by some form of .. Autobot.&quot; \nshe \n&gt; growled as she padded by him & then broke out into a run.\n\n&quot;Good luck, old friend,&quot; Empath says softly, knowing Maxima won&#39;t \nhear her.  The femme heads back to the others.  &quot;Let her go.  She \nwon&#39;t cause any trouble.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
