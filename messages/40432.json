His scanners were already busy trying to find anything interesting.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&quot;Kind of stupid for two bots to attempt to take over a Decepticon commander,&quot; Autofire&#39;s voice sounds from the doorway as he steps out of the shadows. He had a missile launcher in one hand, pointed at Darkwing, and a chain gun in the other, aimed up at the jet that was Dreadwing. Both of his shoulder cannons were armed, one aimed at Darkwing and one at Dreadwing. His eyes were burning red with charged energy for an optic blast.\n\nWithout saying anything, Autofire pulls the trigger on his chain gun, sending 23 shots at Dreadwing, along with four shouts from his shoulder cannon.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStratus swims through the water toward the ship, his scanners detecting possibly active autoguns and plotting a path to avoid them. He was advancing slowly, but he wasn&#39;t getting hurt, either. (Are there any active defences on or near that ship?)\n\n\n"}}
