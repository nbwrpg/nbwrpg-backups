Then the feeling grew, and grew. Joy and power flooded \nhis body. the world was a new! what was happening he still had no idea, but \nthe burden of knowledge  was lifted. The knowledge remained, but he felt no \nburden from it. he was in bliss. As the energy filled him all pain exited his \nbody glowed. his world became a wonderful balance of peace and happiness \nnothing could stop him. if you looked at Him threw an Amber spy glass you \nwould have seen a world of light. The energy roared within him and it still \ngrew. That was when the matrix spoke:::\n\n&quot;And Jeramy said onto them &#39;live in the glory of god in the highest, Maker of \nheaven and earth!&#39; and the night sky was alight with a thousand singing \nangles in all there glory!&quot;\n\n:::And child began, unintentionally to sing. His sweet soprano tearing the \nnight sky with joy:::\n\nChild:  &#39;oh come to me angels&#39;\n    &#39;Sing on high the holy one&#39;\n    &#39;And let there be peace on.. to...&#39;\n                &#39;The world!&#39;\n\n"}}
