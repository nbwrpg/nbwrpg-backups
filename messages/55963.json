She opened her optics slightly, and out of the \ncorner of her optic, she could see a male bot figure picking her up.  \nShe couldn&#39;t tell who it was. But her wolf nose told her that it was \nanother wolf bot. She was about to try to talk when a surge of pain \nran through her belly. She threw her head back and arched her back in \nwrithing agony. &quot;AAAHHHHHHHHH!&quot; screaming out in anguish.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Maximal wolf looked at his Predacon opponent.

In exchange, you must not leave the area or cause \ntrouble.\n&gt; You know that an accident happens much too fast in surgeries...\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, he transformed and took Kitkat in his arms, being careful\n&gt; not to touch her where internal leaks were obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Cam, head back to base now and warn Kenzo he&#39;s needed \nright\n&gt; away to help this bot.
