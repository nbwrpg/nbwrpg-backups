He had to get out of here\nas well.  He stood up, and then headed for the exit.  He was limping, and\nthen he fell down again.  He struggled to get back up, but he did, and\nlimped his way out of the engine room.  He stopped, and then spat out\nmech-fluid.  He looked at his chest, it was all dented, and there was some\nmech-fluid pouring out.  His back was also injured.  He could tell that this\nwas his day.  He awaited the matrix.  The matrix.  No.  There was no matrix\nto go to.  He was right, he simply didn&#39;t belong.  He fell foward, face\nfirst, and then started crawling.  He transformed into vehicle mode and sped\noff, later he transformed back, and opened the hatch.  He made it!!!!!  And\nhe was still alive!  Well, at least he made it alive out of the Ark.  But,\noutside the Ark, would be a whole different story.  He prayed for a miracle\nto happen, as he started limping away from the battle, holding his right\nshoulder.\n\n\n"}}
