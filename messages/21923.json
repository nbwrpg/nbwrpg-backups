She hadn&#39;t deleted \nit. He thought she would because of the danger, but she decided. He \nlooked around. &quot;Did ya get uh pod?&quot; Oh, he hoped she did, then he \nwould have no idea how to get their offspring on-line. If they could \nget the spark into the pod, it would be fine.\n\nThis whole thing made him nervous. It could harm her, and he didn&#39;t \nwant that. If it started to, he&#39;d destroy it. He didn&#39;t want to loose \nher because of it. It wasn&#39;t anything to him yet.\n\nHe grabbed her around the waist, just incase to steady her. Now he \nneeded a place to take her. He picked her up in his arms. He heard a \nfemale lost a lot of energy from his type of procedure.\n\n&quot;Tell me what t&#39; do,&quot; he said. What room would work in bringing it on-\nline? \n\nHe thought. Maybe he could get someone to help.  \n\n\n"}}
