He came to like right before BrightBlade was slagged and\n&gt; captured, so I&#39;d be surprised if he did no anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster nods, walking to the cell. He kneels down, picking up\n&gt; Gangon&#39;s remains. The slightly sickened look was obvious on Kluster&#39;s\n&gt; face.\n&gt;\n&gt; He carrues Gangon to the next room, motioning for Ice and Gangon to\n&gt; follow. Putting Gangon&#39;s head in the space provided on the console,\n&gt; Kluster begins the scan. A proccess indicator quickly begins counting\n&gt; toward 100%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Divitri: Go ahead and scan him, he&#39;s your prisoner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Remember, Zardus, he was a common heartbroken fool who never knew\n&gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; about the Predacons, and didn&#39;t know anything about the groups who\n&gt; opposed\n&gt; &gt; them, neither.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
