She still couldn&#39;t smell \nanything.  The cool breaze blew by her ears and then a horrific \nthought entered her mind. I&#39;m Upwind, they could smell me, she \nthought.  She ran wide and went about half a mile out to the side and \ncirled back up behind them.  She was cloaked, but now, she could \nsmell the preds.  She could smell Spears and Prebon, but there were \nother smell that she couldn&#39;t make out.  She crept up onto a small \nbluff and waited.  (Unknowingly, she is sitting on a bluff that is 25 \nyards away from where Slayer is perched, but she can&#39;t smell or see \nSlayer,)  She crouched under the tall grasses and a small bush.  She \nwatched and waited for the meeting to take place. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Smokescreen/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus frowns at Lunarpine&#39;s question, looking down at the anti-\nchip weapon \n&gt; he was carrying. &quot;If they were reprogrammed, you mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sighs. &quot;Then this weapon will be useless.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus looks up at the sky. Firearm and Proto were flying high \noverhead, \n&gt; cloaked. Smokescreen was scouting ahead on foot, also cloaked. \nSomewhere in \n&gt; the area, Brix, Fliq, and Snow Cat were also making their way to \nthe meeting \n&gt; place, hopefully also cloaked. That made 8 bots, all out to rescue \nStriker \n&gt; and Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then we&#39;ll need to get them and programm them back to Maximal, I \nguess.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Cloaked on his cliff, Slayer scans the area, searching for any \nMaximals. \n&gt; Catching a glimpse of Ramulus in the distance, Slayer&#39;s face twists \ninto an \n&gt; evil smile.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They are on their way, Master,&quot; he says into his comm-link, \nwatching Ramulus \n&gt; carefully.\n\n\n"}}
