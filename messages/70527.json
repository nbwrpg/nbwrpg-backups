No maximals for\n&gt;&gt; now&quot;then he opened his comlink to every Predacon and said &quot;Give me \n&gt;&gt; regular\n&gt;&gt; reports of your duties&quot;and he send a secret message to Cyclonus&quot;Keep an \n&gt;&gt; eye\n&gt;&gt; in that spider, if you smell something fishy kill him in the spot&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Predacons grumble at Hydras for telling them they wouldn&#39;t be in\n&gt; battle any time soon, but the grumbling was muted with that hint of\n&gt; fear and respect for thier leader, none of them seemed inclined to say\n&gt; anything against Hydras in the open - in other words they were being\n&gt; typical Predacons. Each of them began wondering off to get back to\n&gt; whatever duties they had before the meeting was called.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Soon enough Hydras stood alone in the throne room. There was only him\n&gt; and the hum of machinery and monitors in the room around him. Even\n&gt; Inferno, his most loyal troop had left the room, although he was\n&gt; standing just outside of the door should Hydras have need of him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus sent back to Hydras, &quot;I will have Taratulus watch at all times.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
