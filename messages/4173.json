He did not see Magmatron \nanywhere. &quot;This is to be expected.&quot; He went on his way to the real location \nafter reciving a silent transmission from Magmatron.\n    He reached the base. Inside he found a new impressive Magmatron. Looking \naround he saw all the computer equpment. On one screen he saw a digram of a \nkey, he didn&#39;t know what it was for. \n    &quot;Commander Magmatron may I tour the base?&quot; Bazooka asked. Magmatron let \nhim. On his way through he found a huge cash of weapons. Some were bigger \nthan his hands, his hands are pretty big.\n    &quot;This is enough to kill even Optimus.&quot; Bazooka said. In another room he \nfound a lab. Magmatron came up behind him. &quot;What is this for?&quot; Bazooka asked.\n    &quot;Just in case any of my troops will be destroyed when the Ark is. It will \nalter their forms just slightly so that they have no Decpticon or Autobot \ntraces left in them. That way they will not be destroyed.&quot; Magmatron replied.   \n\n"}}
