She didn&#39;t know.  She \nwanted to go back and find out, but that might mean her death.  She was \nhurting from the shock from the grid.  She let go of the branch and glided \naround in the cool air.  Part of her left wing was torn.  Her leg was \nscratched to heck.  She wanted a place to land and rest.  She went over the \nhills and around a few mountains.\nShe found a tree near a cave and rested in the branches.\n\n------Original Message-------\n&gt;From: minime_316@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n&gt;Vulois took a few shots to the neck area, barely missing his nervous\n&gt;system. The pain was sharp and it sent him back into a corner.\n&gt;Terminess screamed. But Vulois&#39; attention was not the matter at hand,\n&gt;but Battera. After the last few weeks they had been together, they\n&gt;had been good friends. Battera helped him escape from the Pred base\n&gt;once. Now only hse escaped. He hopes she realizes she can never go\n&gt;back. Join up with Megatron, everyone knows he wants to betray Hell\n&gt;Beast, or go freelance, or join the Maximals if she doesn&#39;t want to\n&gt;hurt anyone. But she can never go back to Hell Beast. Now Vulois put\n&gt;a plan to action.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Hell Beast.....I don&#39;t know what Scourge heard, but all I was saying\n&gt;was that our group needed to protect you from mutiny and keep the TM3\n&gt;safe, only the last one doesn&#39;t really matter now. I destroyed the\n&gt;bugs because you need to have more faith in us. You didn&#39;t even make\n&gt;us your second in commmands, like you promised. But I still have\n&gt;faith that we can work this out, Hell Beast. In a sign of good faith,\n&gt;I will go quietly to the brig. Terminess, you too.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois struggled to stand up. Once to his feet, he waited for the\n&gt;Preds to arrest him.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
