When \nhe got back and sat down, he began to speak again.  &quot;Now we must plan our \nassault.  I recommend a wedge formation with the most heavily armored bot \ntaking point.  That way we won&#39;t be hitting ourselves.&quot;  Something registered \nin his mind.  &quot;I have to go to the old base.  To see if there&#39;s anything to \nsalvage.&quot;\n\n    He leapt to his feet and ran out of the base.  Outside, he flew off to \nthe destroyed Sulaco.  He wasn&#39;t sure what he was looking for but he quickly \nfound it.  An egg was sitting on the ground buried under some light rubble.  \n&quot;Interesting.&quot;  He picked it up and flew back to the new Destron base.  He \nleft the egg on an examining table and began studying it.\n\n"}}
