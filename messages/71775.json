I had to keep an constant optic on\nthem.&quot; He smiled slightly, &quot;But they did have their uses.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sooo.&quot; CRYOTEK said, the word sounding almost like a sigh as he\nglanced out of the window in the room which, among other things,\nshowed a bit of his shuttle as it sat outside HYDRAS&#39; ship. &quot;I took\neverything of value from there and I have come here.&quot;\n\nThere was another shrug as CRYOTEK turned back to HYDRAS, &quot;I don&#39;t\nknow where they came from or where they went.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did they have anything like this?&quot; SCOURGE said as he pulled out the\ndevice that DARK RODIMUS had used to escape. The device looked to be\nabout the size of a hand gun with lots of lights and such. although in\nthis case most of them were nurnt out.\n\nCRYOTEK shook his head, &quot;No. But then again I didn&#39;t see what they used.&quot;\n\nFrom his position on the table FRACTYL looked over, &quot;Let me see that.&quot;\nHolding his hand out for the device.\n\nSCOURGE looked as if he were going to keep it for a moment, but then\nhanded it over.\n\n&quot;Hmmmmm.&quot; FRACTYL said as examined the device, turining it over in\nhands. &quot;I wonder if we could get it working again.&quot; His voice trailed\noff as he pulled out a small hand held scanner.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
