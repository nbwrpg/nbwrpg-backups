Fire erupted from the back of the \nstrange craft, which at a first glance would make one think that the strange \nthing was on fire.\n\nBut in reality several boosters in the back had activated, and the once \nspinning egg was now moving at an incredible speed steadily, without \nspinning.  It reached the atmosphere in seconds, and continued on a direct \ncourse for what would be known as Mt. St. Hilary, the place where the Autobot \ncraft crashed.\n\nThe ship stopped suddenly, without slowing down, fifteen feet from the ground.\n\n"}}
