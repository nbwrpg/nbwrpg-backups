She hated him.  She decided that if he was ever in \ntrouble, she would turn off her comm-link and ignore him.  She went back to \nher console and completed her reports.  She strted thinking about her \nprogramming.  She hated this servent programming. She wanted to be more of a \nfighter and less of a maintenance bot.\n\n---------Original Message---------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 30, 2000 2:36pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nTerrorsaur:\n\n\nTerrorsaur couldn&#39;t stop growling at the mouse-bot. She was nothing but a\nservant to what he saw. What good was she? All that she did was give him\nenergon that he didn&#39;t want. What a waste of bot!\n\nHe transformed to his robot mode and walked widely around her. He needed\nsomething to do, but he wasn&#39;t going to ask that female bot.\n\nHe looked around. Where was that other flier?\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
