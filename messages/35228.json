Sunstreaker adds his two sense\n&gt; into this, &quot;Well I think your making a mistake, Grimlock has a point,&quot;.\n&gt; Sideswipe looks at his brother, &quot;Shut up, he&#39;ll do fine, thats why\n&gt; Grimlock is going along, to keep him on his toes,&quot;. &quot;Enough&quot; Ironhide\n&gt; says, as he gets up and transforms, heading for the area of launch.\n&gt; Sideswipe and Sunstreaker quickly follow suite. Then the image zooms in\n&gt; and out, then in again. Then in the rafters there is movement, and a\n&gt; clicking noise can be heard, then a transformation, as a camera turns\n&gt; into three robots, and flies up through a hole in the cieling, followed\n&gt; by a bat. The four robots float through Cybertrons skies, away from the\n&gt; Autobot/Maximal zone, towards Predacon territory. Soon, they will arrive\n&gt; at their destination.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ironhide Transforms when he reaches a large garage. Sideswipe and his\n&gt; brother stay in their car modes. &quot;Come on Hoist, dont be late for lift\n&gt; off&quot; he yells into the garrage. Hoist walks out, bidding farewell to\n&gt; Grapple. &quot;You sure you want to go through with this?&quot; Ironhide asks.\n&gt; &quot;Sure Im sure&quot; he says, transforming into his tow truck, and zooming\n&gt; ahead, then followed by Ironhide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Grimlock watches Swoop leave their domain. &quot;Come Dinobots, time we go,\n&gt; Show Maximals how you do Exploring&quot; he boasts, as he stands up.\n\n\n"}}
