Another thing, why \ndon&#39;t you take damage?  OH!  Another one!  So, keep it up.  I dare \nyou.  Enough to moderate your worthless hide.  Oh, and that will be \nso much fun!  You know what happens when you get moderated?  There&#39;s \na setting that makes it so I have to approve all your posts!  FUN?  \nISN&#39;T IT?!  So if you go accusing someone of moding, and you have no \nclue about it, Jason Lind, shut the hell up.  Your the worst moder \nhere.  And I mean that.
