Veratis was a \nweek \n&gt; old bot who didn&#39;t seem to pose much of a threat but that&#39;s when \n&gt; things have been hitting him lately. \n&gt; \n&gt; Both bots remained silent for a long time before the silence was \n&gt; finally broken by Veratis. &quot;You seem tired my friend, how long has \nit \n&gt; been since you recharged?&quot; The scientist seemed naturally worried \n&gt; about his guest but he had other things on his mind as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine couldn&#39;t understand Veratis&#39;s hospitality but his host \nhad \n&gt; yet to give him any reason to deny his problems. &quot;It&#39;s been a \nwhile, \n&gt; I think that It&#39;s been a day or so. I could be wrong.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then you must rest my new friend.&quot; Veratis&#39; grin showed no more \nthan \n&gt; a lonely bot looking for company. &quot;Sit right here and I&#39;ll be right \n&gt; back.&quot; The host left the room with a seemingly anxious manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine knew that all this hospitality wasn&#39;t because of his \nhosts  \n&gt; need for company. His wolf senses told him there were two others \n&gt; accompanying Veratis, thier scents were week so it&#39;d been some time \n&gt; since thier departure. Still he didn&#39;t want to seem an ungrateful \n&gt; guest so he decided to play along for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis returned carrying a tray with old style energeon cubes, He \n&gt; placed the tray between them and picked up two. He handed one to \n&gt; Lunarpine and held one up to himself. &quot;You still don&#39;t trust me? \nwell \n&gt; then a toast, To the earning of trust.&quot; he then raised the cube to \n&gt; his mettalic lips and drained it dry.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cube handed to Lunarpine didn&#39;t smell right, it had a distinct \n&gt; scent added to it. He set it back on the tray and picked up another \n&gt; one. this one smelled different, it was pure energeon, at least it \n&gt; smelled pure. The wolf tipped his head back, looking at Veratis the \n&gt; whole way. &quot;Ya to earning trust.&quot; He too sucked the energeon dry. \nIt \n&gt; fealt reinviggorating to recharge. He tried to stand, to feal the \n&gt; energy returning to his body. That was his second mistake. The \n&gt; wolfbot collapsed to the floor, going into stasis lock.\n\n\n"}}
