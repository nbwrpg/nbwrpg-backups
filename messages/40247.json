His eyes were totally devoid of feeling,\nwhatever the creature was thinking, it was most likely a survival\nprogram. He took a step back to get a better look, his massive foot\nlifting up, and moving towards the forest area that was lit. Sinnertwin\nlooked up, quickly transformed, and scrambled out of the way, as his\nbody area was replaced by the foot, which crunched into the ground,\ncausing a slight tremor across the small island, as the ground began to\nsplit open. His huge foot easily sank into the rock, as he turned, to\nlook out over the horizen. He then shifted his head, looking downward.\n&quot;What we do?&quot; he asked towards no one in perticular, his deafening voice\nshaking the air. What was left of the forest erupted with life, as herds\nof animals scrambled away in fear at the sudden comotion.\n\n"}}
