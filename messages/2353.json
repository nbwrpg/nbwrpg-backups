You had Scamrock grab\nthem,\n&gt; which would cause them to explode because of impact.  That was your\nmistake\n&gt; by doing that.  Also, I read in a few posts that the People&#39;s Base\nexploded,\n&gt; I didn&#39;t see the actual post where it exploded, and I never saw your\n&#39;sister&#39;\n&gt; , but evidently since I didn&#39;t get the e-mail, you can&#39;t blame me)\n&gt;\n&gt; The Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Nemesis Enforcer/Anubis/Hades/Unitron/Koga\n&gt; Shuko/Scattershot:\n&gt;\n&gt; Oblitertron raised both of his arms in triumph, splitting into five\nseperate\n&gt; pieces, each transforming into a robot, the Oblitercons landing in a line.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark One: &quot;Alright, the base is crushed, this...Dracona&#39;s base is in\n&gt; ruins...her forces are destroyed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Breakdown: &quot;I think Nemesis called for reinforcements.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Pyro: &quot;Then let&#39;s fire a few shots off and pull back to re-energize.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiss: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scavenger raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Scamrock,\nthe\n&gt; other Oblitercons charging off towards the Alliance base, not really\ncaring\n&gt; about finishing them off, leaving Nemesis and Scattershot alone with the f\nour\n&gt; Newcomers.\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer fired two optic blasts at the People&#39;s base&#39;s rubble,\n&gt; turning, a clawed fist sending him slamming into a trunk.  Anubis grabbed\nhim\n&gt; by the neck, kneeing him in the face twice, backhanded him with claws.\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Scattershot fired off twenty explosive bullets down randomly at the\nRadicons,\n&gt; deciding he really didn&#39;t enjoy them without a bomb, he&#39;d have to go bumb\n&gt; some off other people.  Raising an &#39;eyebrow&#39;, he fired off ten shots,\nAnubis\n&gt; slamming into a tree, the tree hitting the ground.  Landing to the ground,\n&gt; his side aching from previous wounds, he didn&#39;t spot Unitron from behind,\nsix\n&gt; laser bolts tearing into the Alliance member&#39;s back, sending him crashing\nto\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt; ------------\n&gt; &quot;Excellent, Unitron.  Let&#39;s move out!  Hades, grab Anubis.  It&#39;s time to\nget\n&gt; rejuvinated.  The people here shouldn&#39;t hinder our plans, their base is\n&gt; destroyed.&quot;  Unitron ordered, Hades picking Anubis up, the Newcomers\nheading\n&gt; back towards their downed ship to recieve repairs.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959480510/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
