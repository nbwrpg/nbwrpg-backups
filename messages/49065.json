The Pred Leader ignores\n&gt; his damages, and leaps up transforming into dragon form. He quickly\n&gt; starts accelerating away from the Maximal base.\n&gt;\n\n{Talos}\n\n    The mammoth watched as Megatron ran from the battle the limited\npredicons trailing him. He sighed looking around at his fellow maximals and\nthe few autobots with them and nodded, it was a victory. Something to boost\nmorale even if only slightly. Turning he calle dout to his troops, &quot;Maximals\ndis-engage, get the injured back to base. I want a volunteer from the\nuninjured bots to tack Megatron and his cronies, if they see you high tail\nit back to base but try and get a reasonable location of the pred base.&quot;\n\n    Turning he glared at Grimlock who was fuming, watching the predicons\nescape. &quot;As for you Grimlock, I don&#39;t care if you were a king or lord of the\nentire universe. You&#39;re under my command here and when I give an order I\nexpect it to be carried out!&quot;\n\n    Growling Grimlock turned, the dinobots dino form eyes narrowing as it\nregarded Talos, &quot;Me Grimlock say me not follow bad orders. Me Grimlock\nwarrior! Me stay and munch predicon metal!&quot;\n\n    &quot;You didn&#39;t even do that, or need I remind you your blasting flames only\nhelped to mask the predicons you over grown metallic lizard. But this isn&#39;t\nthe place. Transform and head back to base I&#39;ll deal with you later.&quot; Talos\ngrowled turning to look over the energon and the scattered equipment picking\nup some of the energon collection and proceeded to start filling some of the\ncontainers. &quot;Kup I&#39;m going to need your help to transport this energon back\nto base to restock our supplies.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
