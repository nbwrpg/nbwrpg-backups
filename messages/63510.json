From the inside the\ncaptain began to attach it with a welding torch, from the outside:\nBetaspiel (who is the only one between the three of them that actually\nhad any ship repair experience, began welding it to the outside.  Once\nit was in place, they got a soldering tool and sealed all the cracks\nin the armor.  They then took a break.\n\nThe sun beat down, making all the metal click a little as it expanded.\n The warden went back inside to check on his inmates.  Betaspeil\nclimbed to the top of the ship to see what could be seen from there. \nThe ship was situated about 15 klicks east from the edge of this\ndesert which surrounded the ship on all sides.  Nobody from the ship\nhad actually left to investigate what was over there, they had been\ntoo busy trying to stay alive after the prison break.\n\nAfter their brief rest break, Tigon grabbed one of his prisoners who\nhad some electrical training and set him with the captain to work in\nthe bridge.  Betaspeil and Tigon escorted another prisoner outside\nwhere they had him paint the newly patched hull.  Tigon guarded the\nprisoner, and Beta examined one of the ship&#39;s defensive cannons on the\nlower side of the hull, it had been shot out in an earlier exchange\nwith a prisoner and it needed to be completely overhauled.  He\nunhooked it from the ship and brought it into the cargo room.  Tigon&#39;s\nprisoner finished his painting job and was put back in his cell.\n\nThe captain seemed pleased with his captive&#39;s work.  He leaned on a\nwall, as the prisoner put the finishing touches on one of the control\npanels that had been shot up.  After the work was done, he was\nrewarded with a trip to the CR chamber, then he was put back in his\ncell.\n\nIt was a good day of work, but they still had lots to do...\n\n(to be continued)\n\n\nOn Thu, 17 Feb 2005 23:05:46 -0800, rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The meeting took place in the cargo bay (the other meeting rooms were\n&gt; not large enough to accommodate Tigon).  The captain set up some\n&gt; crates as chairs and one as a table.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, here&#39;s the situation.  I think we can safely assume that our\n&gt; repair bot friend is long gone since he hasn&#39;t showed his face in\n&gt; quite a while.  Here&#39;s the crew roster as it stands now:\n&gt; \n&gt; Me\n&gt; Tigon\n&gt; Betaspiel\n&gt; \n&gt; We have 4 healthy prisoners, 2 are too dangerous to be let out, 2 can\n&gt; be used for labor, right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, I am certain that the two you are referring to absolutely\n&gt; cannot be released, for any reason.  But actually we have about 14\n&gt; incarcerated.  I have confirmed 3 of those dead, and 5 of those\n&gt; missing.  The rest are in stasis.  Continue&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Right, we have 5 crewmen in stasis, 3 confirmed dead.  That leaves 13\n&gt; missing.  But that&#39;s not important now.  We need to focus our repair\n&gt; work, also it would be a good idea to get some more information about\n&gt; the area around the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know it&#39;s been easy to just spend all our time doing our own thing,\n&gt; but I think its time we act like a crew again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any questions? ideas?  anything?!?!?!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tigon and Betaspeil shook their heads.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ok, lets start by repairing the bridge.  I know we don&#39;t&#39; have a lot\n&gt; of technical skills amongst the three of us, but these repairs are\n&gt; long overdue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dismissed&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 14 Feb 2005 23:04:55 -0800, rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The warden paced back and forth....  one of the prisoners came to the\n&gt; &gt; front of his cell, but quickly realized that they wouldnt&#39; get\n&gt; &gt; anywhere through annoying the warden, the warden threatened to\n&gt; &gt; severely damage anyone trying to annoy him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *beep* &quot;Tigon, this is the captain, please take the intercom link in\n&gt; &gt; your office.&quot; *click*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tigon (the warden) walked back into his office, that he barely fit\n&gt; &gt; into and sat down in his especially large chair.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes&quot; replied Tigon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We haven&#39;t had a meeting in a while, lets get together at 19:00... ok?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ok...... is that all?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;....We think we have found a trace of that pesky theif that helped us\n&gt; &gt; out a stellar cycle ago.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll talk about it at the meeting... make sure your jail is\n&gt; &gt; secure when you leave&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;When have I not done my job?&quot; he said with a chuckle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, you have a point there....
