Stars shed \nimmense\n&gt; amount of energy,  the planets constantly rotate on an axis, and a \nworm\n&gt; hole opens up. But upon closer inspection, the worm hole is neither\n&gt; natural, or peaceful like its surrounding. A very small interstellar\n&gt; shuttle emerges from the worm hole, with laser fire on its tail. The\n&gt; thrusters are burning more than they normally should, for they are \ndamaged,\n&gt; and the ship starts to careen out of control, towards the third \nplanet from\n&gt; the power eminating star.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the shuttle three robots run around, but it is to dark to \nmake out\n&gt; their appearance, the only light, comes from small fires bursting up\n&gt; everywhere. One of the larger ones stops at a fire, and aims both \nhands at\n&gt; it. A swhirl of blue energy builds up, then shoots a beam of liquid\n&gt; nitrogen at the fire putting it out. Another, very small robot gets \ninto\n&gt; the control chair, and attempts to steer the ship, &quot;No good, its \nout of\n&gt; control&quot; he says. Then the third robot runs over to a consol, &quot;Hey, \ndont\n&gt; worry guys, i&#39;ll send a distress signal, just close the transwarp \nportal,\n&gt; before our friends follow us&quot;.  At the calm words of the blue robot \nat the\n&gt; consol, the one in the control chair flips a button.\n&gt; \n&gt; Outside, the worm hole closes up, and all is as it should have \nbeen, except\n&gt; for the small ship, starting to burn as it enters the atmosphere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Over an old Autobot frequency, and emergency signal \nbegins, &quot;emergency, our\n&gt; ship is out of control, we will require assistance, and more than \nlikely,\n&gt; repairs when we crash&quot; and this message plays over loops, as the \nship\n&gt; descends towards Turkey, making a flaming path through the \natmosphere on\n&gt; its descent.\n\n\n"}}
