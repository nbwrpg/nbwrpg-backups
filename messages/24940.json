After that was done she typed in a few more commands and \ntargeted Unitron and Firestarter with several flamethowers per &#39;bot. They \nemerged from beneath retractable floor boards beside the entrance to the \nbridge.\n\nA few moments later they fired a powerful burst of fire at the two invading \n&#39;bots. She had rerouted some additional power to them in order to get her \npoint across. She wanted them out... now. This may be Kluster&#39;s ship, but \nshe was it&#39;s tech &#39;bot, and she wasn&#39;t going to let it fall into enemy \nhands.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
