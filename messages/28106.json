Later he\nlanded, and saw Darkfate.\n\n            &quot;Sir, sorry for my tardiness!  I guess that won&#39;t get me up in\nthe ranks!

He didn&#39;t care about HotRod\nanymore.  But he couldn&#39;t waste his enemy.  This was not a sign of\nintelligence, Skullgrin remained dumb as ever in Pretender mode, but it was\nan instinct.  Skullgrin lifted his sword with Hot Rod still on it and\nquickly swung it at Cheetor, dodiging the blades, so that Hot Rod and the\nsword would smack Cheetor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n           Triggerhappy brought out his gun, and put the tip of it right at\nCondor&#39;s forehead.\n\n            &quot;Like my friend Astroblast says, shut your mouth and remain\nstill!
