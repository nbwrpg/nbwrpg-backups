Everybody was in the cargo section.\n\nDaemos: Gesper is swimming, somewhere between the Autobot base and \nhere. We shall go get him firsthand. (he opens a line with the Tripred \nbase) Tankor, you keep the base while we are away. Do not hesitate to \neradicate any potential threat.\n\nTankor: I will do so, sir.\n\nDaemos: Good. Here we go!\n\nHe violently jerks the controls and the ship takes off, full throttle. \nMelchana and Jetstormmanaged to stay on their feet, but Belthassan did \nnot. He crashed into the wall of the compartment.\n\nDaemos looked at Gesper&#39;s position. He was far, but the Hellgate was a \nfast ship. He would be in there soon enough.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -- Anachronox --\n&gt; \n&gt; Anachronox nods to Jetstorm. &quot;Good.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He gets into the ship, and waits for Daemos. Soon after, the rest of \n&gt; the crew arrives, Daemos included, and they prepare for launch. The \n&gt; large bot grabs something(he&#39;s following orders =P).\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: I couldn&#39;t tell whether Anachronox and Jetstorm were supposed \n&gt; to get into the ship or not, so you&#39;ll have to confirm this for me. \n&gt; (even if it might result in me doing a repost.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Crane is almost done... there... I&#39;ll tell Daemos. (He \n&gt; opens \n&gt; &gt; a commline with Daemos.) Daemos, sir, the ship is good.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Alright you two. Wait for us for now. We&#39;re going to pick \n&gt; &gt; Gesper on the way, and then, it&#39;s operation fruits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Roger. Heard that, Anachronox?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Soon, Daemos, Melchana and Belthassan got aboard. Daemos took the \n&gt; &gt; commands of the ship while the two others got in the personnel \n&gt; &gt; section.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Everyone, hold to something. The worst is the take off! \n&gt; Tell \n&gt; &gt; me when you&#39;re ready.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
