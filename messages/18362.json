The\nscientist gathered DNA samples and injected them into the translife on my\nold planet. They destroyed the insecticons and saved the planet from being a\nbuffet.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to give up to much information about her origin so\nshe turned back to the Dna readouts.\n\n&quot;I hope to save and restore other planets that have suffered at translife\nhands, I feel we owe the universe that much for the damage done in the great\nwars.&quot; She studied the samples more closely &quot;Perhaps these two animals\naren&#39;t the best example but it&#39;s just a sample for Zardus to see.&quot;\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 17, 2000 6:46 AM\nSubject: Re: To make a long story short (To late) Part 2\n\n\n&gt; Squizzy::\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodded.  She didn&#39;t know what this bot was up to, but the whole\n&gt; idea wasn&#39;t all that bad. &quot;So your not going to destroy the\n&gt; ecosystem, mearly help it along so both bot and naute can coexist?&quot;\n&gt; She smiled. &quot;I had never seen that done before, but if it is\n&gt; possable, that nature and bot can exist in harmony like that, I&#39;d be\n&gt; glad to help try.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She smiled and showed her willingness to help.  But her mind was\n&gt; trying to figure out what this bot was really up to.  This bot wasn&#39;t\n&gt; what she appeared to be.  There was something that LadyHawk was\n&gt; hiding.   But she couldn&#39;t quite figure it out.  She wondered why\n&gt; this bot, who knew all this knowledge was having her do most of the\n&gt; work? Then it came to her, LadyHawk didn&#39;t know it all.  But then, if\n&gt; she didn&#39;t know, why pretend to know.  To save her tail feathers?\n&gt; Most llikely.  But for now, Squizzy would play along and find out all\n&gt; she could.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk was startled by the revelation. She tried to remain\n&gt; collected.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Are we not disrupting this planets growth just by being here?&quot;\n&gt; Lady Hawk\n&gt; &gt; knew the results every time technology was introduced into an\n&gt; ecosystem. &quot;My\n&gt; &gt; hopes aren&#39;t to upset the natural balance but to create a middle\n&gt; ground\n&gt; &gt; between what we are and what the planet could be.&quot; It was an\n&gt; argument her\n&gt; &gt; father had used hundreds of times but every time the warmongers\n&gt; would turn\n&gt; &gt; the argument around and throw it in his face.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
