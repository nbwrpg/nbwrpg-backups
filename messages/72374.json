What kind of a leader just up and disappears when his\n&gt; crew needs him most, and comes back a super villain?!  NONE!  If anyone\n&gt; should bear the matrix, it&#39;s gotta be someone we can all trust.  Someone who\n&gt; sticks by us no matter what.  And someone who has a good head on their\n&gt; shoulders.  Leo Prime, please, don&#39;t let Rodimus back inta leadership.  It\n&gt; was one of Tucson&#39;s wishes before he left ta go after Wheelie.

For some reason his men tended to have a dinosaur motif\n&gt;&gt; to them.&quot; CALIBER shrugged slightly. &quot;If he still has the ship, it\n&gt;&gt; might be in that jungle area.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ELDER nodded, &quot;It is certainly big enough to hold his ship.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;That jungle will eventually be large enough to encompass several\n&gt;&gt; conntries in what will be later known as Central America.&quot; LEGACY said\n&gt;&gt; in his cold tones. &quot;It is large enough to hold that ship and hide it\n&gt;&gt; from our sensors. From our initial scans that Jungle, at least that\n&gt;&gt; foward area is producing a wave effect that resembles a Unicronian\n&gt;&gt; energy signature. It has the affect of blocking standard comlink\n&gt;&gt; signals as well as inhibiting scanning beams.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ELDER furrowed his brow as if trying to remember something, then he\n&gt;&gt; shook his head. &quot;A ship could bve in there and hidden well, but I have\n&gt;&gt; been watching for quite some time now. I don&#39;t have any record of a\n&gt;&gt; ship as large as the Dinsaur is reputed to be landing on Earth.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As they talked LEO PRIME walked into the room, &quot;Alright men strap on\n&gt;&gt; your gear and let&#39;s get ready.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WOLFGANG and RAMULUS were helping NIGHTSHIFT to get to the CR chamber\n&gt;&gt; as the LEO had entered. &quot;You&#39;re not going to use that shuttle.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; WOLFGANG said. &quot;It&#39;s going to need some repairs.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO nodded, &quot;No, we are going to use mine.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just outside of the Ark a ship seemed to almost materialize as its\n&gt;&gt; cloak disappated, revealing the ship the LEO PRIME and his crew had\n&gt;&gt; arrived on. The ship was alrady starting to glow as its engines\n&gt;&gt; powered up and a ramp began to lower.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (LEO&#39;s Ship:\n&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/54620451/pic/1078733870/view)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Turning to the others LEO PRIME spoke, &quot;Legacy, stay here and take\n&gt;&gt; charge of the Ark until Polar Claw is full repaired.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Straightshot, Quickstride, Rat Trap&quot; LEO called out. &quot;I will need\n&gt;&gt; your skills on this mission.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as he spoke TORCA and his crew were already boarding the ship,\n&gt;&gt; followed by SANTON and WINGCALIBER.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO Turned to the others. &quot;Bump and Legacy will take care of the\n&gt;&gt; wounded until we return.
