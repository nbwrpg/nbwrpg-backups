The only way I&#39;m leaving is if I lose my\n&gt; internet connection for a long time. Not going to\n&gt; happan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it would be cool if we all got together one\n&gt; day. It would be sweet to actually meet and talk to\n&gt; everyone. A lot of us have been together here for a\n&gt; long time now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh and Dewy, dont use a Glock, use a Colt!\n&gt; Especially a 45cal.
