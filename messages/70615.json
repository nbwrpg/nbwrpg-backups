She rubs her \n&gt; shoulders with a gentile touch.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right, she does right now, but that&#39;s gonna change real soon, \n&gt; you&#39;ll see, she&#39;ll remember who you are, and love you just as much as she \n&gt; loved you before all this happened to her.  And ya know what?  When we get \n&gt; both your parents back, I&#39;m sure Rodimus is gonna have a few exo skeletons \n&gt; ta pick with those insectoids. And if she knows your heart is pouring out \n&gt; to her, she&#39;ll feel it, even if she&#39;s changed, there is no greater power \n&gt; than what&#39;s in your heart, actually in all our hearts.  You have so much \n&gt; love ta share and that alone will be like a bright light, guiding her \n&gt; home.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift approaches, and kneels down to Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right, that little heart of yours has more power in it than any \n&gt; super destructive force those baddies are puttn&#39; out on their end. And I \n&gt; know it&#39;s got all its hopes on Rodimus and Nightlight&#39;s recovery.  It will \n&gt; bring them home, that&#39;s for sure, it&#39;ll bring them home.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap couldn&#39;t wait to see what Rodimus and Tucson would do once they \n&gt; recovered from the ordeal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just wait till they all come outa this..  Those creeps are gonna get \n&gt; what&#39;s comming ta them big time, and I&#39;m sure glad I&#39;m on this side of the \n&gt; fence.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride ponders for just a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If ya ask me, I think Tucson Prime&#39;s gonna give them a run for their \n&gt; energon too.  Before he underwent the whole upgrade thing, he was a real \n&gt; spit fire, according to Night Shift.  Nothing really scared him, and where \n&gt; there&#39;s a will he finds a way.  And yes, if there&#39;s one thing he does that \n&gt; manages to scare the bolts out of us, is when he puts himself in mortal \n&gt; danger just so we don&#39;t have to be in the thick of it.  Yeah, there&#39;s \n&gt; somethn&#39; different about &#39;em all right, just wait till Rodimus starts \n&gt; workn&#39; with &#39;em... That oughta be amusing..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He watches as the operation continues.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;She looks so sick, so changed...&quot;sobbed the girl\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sandy&quot; &lt;magicquartz@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 17, 2010 9:44 PM\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Into the LIGHT!/Down the rabbit hole (Tuscon & Rodimus)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson&#39;s chest continues to pulsate, with the light growing brighter \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; brighter.
