His metal, jet-like wings made \nhim soar through the sky. Heading high up, he took some time to feel \nthe wind on his face. After staying still in the sky for a moment, he \ncame back down fast. He broke his fall near the treetops. Finding \nMistra again, he decided to ask some questions. The emotions he felt \nin her motivated him to continue.\n\nAzureBlade: Mistra! Over here! (he came down lower, but was still in \nmiddair) Can I ask you something? What do you remember about yourself?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; AzureBlade stepped outside the cave and into the forest. The sun \nwas \n&gt; &gt; high in the sky, and a few clouds were crawling westwards. He \n&gt; &gt; stretched his wings, made of metal. He then turned to Mistra, and, \n&gt; &gt; even though she must have looked grotesque to another bot, she \nseemed \n&gt; &gt; beautiful to him. He had never felt that way. After the atrocities \nhe \n&gt; &gt; had commited at the capture of his brother and the slaughter of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; two Decepticons, this feeling was a bliss. He was feeling peaceful \n&gt; &gt; just looking at her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: I know you will be able! If you need help however, I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; sure I&#39;ll be able to carry you to the city!&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra stepped out into the sunlight, enjoying the bright sunlight. \nA bit \n&gt; odd, considering her beast form was partially a creature who \npreferred the \n&gt; dark. Then again, she wasn&#39;t truely a bat, was she? With a stretch \nof her \n&gt; own, she unfolded her own wings and smiled again at Azure. Hopefully \nhe \n&gt; didn&#39;t mind her company much...especially since she liked having him \naround \n&gt; when it came down to it. And he was the only one she knew or trusted \nby now.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank you Azure...&quot; she said softly, smiling still.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;OOC: Can you give me your address so I can send it back?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: ^_^ Sure! I&#39;m HanaKirei85@a... ^_^. Hehe!\n\n\n"}}
