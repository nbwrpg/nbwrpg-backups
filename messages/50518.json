The Pred leader eyes the two but is hardly worried about any \ndeceitful action; entrance auto guns would have made short work of \nFlicker and Pheonix had either of them left the area. \n\n&quot;Flicker I presume. What exactly bring you to the Pred base?&quot; \nMegatron seems outwardly without a care as to why they may be at the \nPred base, but inwardly, he is slightly curious.\n\nHe is interrupted by a commlink from Perceptor, &quot;Yes Perceptor, go \nmeet the bot, and bring him to the entrance, I&#39;m there now, and so \nare two other bots.&quot; A small smiles creeps to his face; the \nPredacons forces were growing.\n\nBefore he can&#39;t say any more, another commlink is redirected from \nthe central comm center, to him from another bot \n(Slaughter/Skulletron), &quot;This is Megatron, state your faction and \nwhy you are here.&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade stares at the floor for a bit, realizing that Megatron \nhas either forgotten about him, or has become preoccupied. Not \ncaring in the slightest what Megatron is and isn&#39;t doing right now, \nSwitchblade heads for the exit of the lab. \n\nThere was one last change that he needed to test out. In addition to \ntransforming into a cassette, Switchblade had modified the cassette \nmode somewhat, giving it four spiderlike legs, one on each corner. \nThe small cyber bug form was exceptionally weak to attacks, but it \nsort of made up for it in it&#39;s small size and admirable speed. This \nmode also allowed him to travel through the ship in the walls with \nease.\n\nAnd so, Switchblade&#39;s form shrunk as he transformed into cassette \nmode. Metallic legs spurted from the corners of the cassette, and an \noptic sensor extended itself a bit from the top of the cassette. The \ncassette then folded slightly leaving the remainder cyber bug a \nsleek black-green body, which proceeded to climb up a wall, and let \nitself into the ventilation. (I wonder if ships have ventilation. \nThe ARE transformers... *shrugs*)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker flies in.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
