Cyclonus, S=\r\ncourge and the others slept, in blissful ignorance of the\n&gt; events transpir=\r\ning around the base. \n&gt; \n&gt; However for a few of them, appearances were dece=\r\nptive. \n&gt; \n&gt; For Cyclonus and Scourge they fought a war, not one of armor a=\r\nnd \nsteel\n&gt; but of programming and free will. The shell programming that he=\r\nld\n&gt; their loyalty to Unicron was disintegrating, but the break down was\n&gt; =\r\nnot pretty. \n&gt; \n&gt; Inside them Shell program raged as slowly lost its hold i=\r\nt had on\n&gt; them. Slowly though things began to settle as Cyclonus and Scour=\r\nge\n&gt; began to assert their own will, for perhaps the first time in \ndecades=\r\n,\n&gt; if not their lives. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;FOOLISH!&quot; The voice of Unicron echoed inside=\r\n Cyclonus and Scourge&#39;s\n&gt; head. &quot;You have escaped me for only a moment!

That is where you=\r\n are wrong.&quot; Unicron&#39;s voice spoke\n&gt; softly, &quot;You have the greatest potenti=\r\nal of all my creations, \nperhaps\n&gt; even more then Galvatron or Vorpal, but =\r\nyou will always have this\n&gt; final flaw, it is as the core of your very bein=\r\ng, inextricably part \nof\n&gt; your construction: You need to follow!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NO=\r\n!&quot; Cyclonus barked, his voice suddenly horse. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes!&quot; Unicron&#39;s voice =\r\ncackled gleefully. &quot;I will see you again. And\n&gt; you will fall under MY WILL=\r\n ONCE MORE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus just shook his head back and forth as he shut hi=\r\ns eyes.\n&gt; Scourge glared at Unicron before his world also went dark. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n************ ********* ********* ********* *\n&gt; \n&gt; Back in the real world, i=\r\nn the recharge pods Cyclonus and Scourge&#39;s\n&gt; optics flickered and returned =\r\nto life! \n&gt; \n&gt; With explosive power both pods burst apart as Cyclonus and S=\r\ncourge\n&gt; step out and looked around. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Cyclonus rasped as he\n=\r\n&gt; looked around. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I smell Predacons.&quot; Scourge said as he too glanced =\r\naround, his \nweapon\n&gt; drawn and ready. &quot;They never smelled quite right! Dec=\r\nepticons had a\n&gt; better feel to them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nods, &quot;Come, let us se=\r\ne who dares hold us! Yes, they have\n&gt; much to explain!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus looke=\r\nd over at the main door to the room they were in. \nWith a\n&gt; simple gesture =\r\nand just a touch of power it exploded off its hinges,\n&gt; flying against the =\r\nfar wall. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a slight nod Cyclonus stepped out of the room and bega=\r\nn to \nwalk,\n&gt; Scourge following behind him like a shadow!\n&gt; \n&gt; ************=\r\n ********* ********* ****\n&gt; \n&gt; As Cyclonus stepped out of the room, and the=\r\n smoke began to settle,\n&gt; another chamber occupant came to life for a momen=\r\nt: Dark Rodimus. \nFor\n&gt; a moment his optics brightened as he watched the ca=\r\nrnage.
