A smile forming across her lips at the thought of 6 bots actually heeding the bluff of one Maximal.\nProwl was brave, she knew that. And that was also one of the reasons she loved him, courage to her went a long way.\nBut as she watched the scene she watched Prowl even more then the Alliance, how confident he was in his idea, how well he was convincing the Alliance that such a simple lie�was true. Noticing just how clearly he was keeping calm, just like the professional he was.\nBut then her mind suddenly switched to the thought of what had happened to her back in the brig, when she had NOT remained calm and her two beast modes merged. The thought of how bloodthirsty and raged she had become sending a shiver down her spine. It wasn&#39;t like her, not like her at all.\nShe knew that both her beast modes were unstable but she had no idea that they were this bad, bad enough to make her forget her own robotic mind and replace it with the rage and bloodlust of two overpowering creatures.\nHer creators had known that as well, known that in that state she couldn�t be controlled. That was also the reason that they got rid of her, had deactivated her and placed her in stasis. Sent her into space within a pod and hoped for the best, that she would be destroyed somehow. Never to land upon a world again and express such rage, to never show that there were such things�as monsters.\nIron Raptor watched as the Alliance stood aside with much difficulty, letting Prowl walk through as he still held the fake detonator. She, simply following after him but her smile wiped completely off her face. Still deep in thought as she followed him through the crowd of Alliance bots.\nWas that what she was, a monster that HER OWN creators couldn�t deal with? So they got rid of her, hoping that something would destroy her because they could not? Because they had worked much too heard to simply pull the plug and extinguish her spark?\nIron Raptor sighed heavily and looked down at her own hand, looking at the features upon it.\nWas she so different? She had two arms, two legs, optics, nose, mouth, a�spark. What made her so different? \nShe then strained her hand and watched as 5 raptor claws extended from her fingers.\nIt was the beast modes; they were what made her so different. What made her seem monstrous in the faces of her enemies? But could she blame them for thinking of her like that, no. Her Second Beast Mode was monstrous and not just because of its size either.\nHer Second Beast Mode represented the largest land carnivore on her home planet, Sirose. And their natural behaviors did not very much from any other creature besides the facts that they were ruthlessly aggressive, they were solitary, cybertronien flesh made no difference to them then real flesh, and they could attack for no reason.\nBut with the instincts of her raptor mode it evened her out, dampening the bloodlust of the Nostelgia. (her SBM.)\nWith another sigh she then retracted her claws and looked up at Prowl, yes; her SBM was dampened down by her raptor mode�until that time in the brig. There both of her beast modes had let go and expressed their true selves, expressed just what rage was.\nIron Raptor looked down for a moment before looking back up at Prowl, she would have to tell him all of this some day�and soon. She couldn�t keep a secret like this from him, it wasn�t right�not at all. She loved him and since she did it was her duty to tell him the truth.\nWith a glance behind her back to see if the others were coming, she then simply followed Prowl. Now thinking of the easiest way to tell him that�she was a monster.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
