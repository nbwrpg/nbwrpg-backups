The scanners clicked, beeped and the door slid open, he may\nhave had a new body but Veratis had used the same DNA scans from his old\nbody. Sounds echoed through the halls which made it sound as if the ship was\nspeaking to him. he heard Ramulus explaining something and decided to see\nwhat his associate was up to.. It sounded like preperation for a battle,\nmaybe Lunarpine would get the chance to test out his new body after all.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
