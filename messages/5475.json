He \nnever really trusted that spider, but he thought it might be good for \nrelations if he was nice to people who would be ememies someday. Like \nPantron, he knew he proboly wouldn&#39;t come back, and he really didn&#39;t care. He \nalso knew that Bobertron proboly would side with Pantron, but he couldn&#39;t be \nsure on that one. \n    He set the Autoguns to reconize Phobias&#39; and Pantron&#39;s signal as an \nememy, so they would have a big surprise if they came back.\n\n"}}
