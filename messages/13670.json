Galvatron, fully healed, was plotting \nhis next attack.  Then all of a sudden, a pod crashed near them.  It opened \nup and a massive(Optimal Optimus sized) robot stepped out.  One of the \ngreatest Decepticon leaders ever, DEATHSAURUS!::\nGalvatron: Deathsaurus? but you were destroyed by Star Saber!\nDeathsaurus: Ah yes, Galvatron! My impudent successor. Do you call this hunk \nof junk a base?\nGalvatron: Why yes i do!  I lead a faction known as the Neocons.  Would you \nlike to join?\nDeathsaurus: I&#39;ve got a better idea.  We fight for leadership!\n::Galvatron needed no more hints.  He took a sword out of subspace, and \nDeathsaurus followed suit. They locked swords.  After a long time, the battle \nseemed to be nearly over::\nDeathsarus: You fought well(pant) Galvatron.\nGalvatron: As did you.\nDeathsaurus: Good bye, Galvatron........ Tigerbreast, Eaglebreast, attack!\n::Tigerbreast and Eaglebreast deploy and rip Galvatron apart.  Megastorm \nsees::\nMegastorm: NOOOO! I was supposed to kill him!\nDeathsaurus: And i&#39;m supposed to kill you!\n::He runs at him and slices his head off.  Mech fluid everywhere, the battle \nhad ended.  The Aerocons, who had been watching in horror, found that \nDeathsaurus was there new leader!\nDeathsaurus:  From now on the Neocons will be led to glory and honor! under \nme!\n\nOOC: please put Galvatron and Megastorm on the deceased list, killed by \nDeathsaurus,.\n\n"}}
