Casting his mind back to the\npast, there were several choices, both Autobot and\nDecepticons. The first and most obvious choice was\nBludgeon- his mastery of the martial arts combined\nwith his warrior&#39;s steely determination, made him a\nnatural choice. Then there was Grimlock, his power and\nfierce battle skill made him a natural. However, he\nwas in for a surprise with what he was shwon next- the\nimage of a maximal gestalt- a form shared by the\noriginal sliverbolt, prowl and ironhide, whose spark\nwould consist of noone less than the legendary Ultra\nMagnus himself (namely Magnaboss). Next up he decided\non Skyfire, Carnivac, and Hardhead.  Primus had two\nmore surprises in store for him though- one was a\nwarrior whose small size had never deterred his\ncourage, and who while becoming gloomy in his later\nyears, was the embodiment of the spirit of an Autobot\nanother champion- one he and Alpha Trion had restored\nso long ago- one who&#39;d fought the Decepticons and\nsaved many an Autobot life, and who would come to\ntouch the lives of so many, a warrior among the\nAutobots withought equal: the legendary Optimus Prime\nhimself.\n\n&quot;Primus, have them briefed and reformed in their most\noptimised forms and have them meet me outside the Ark-\nwe haven&#39;t much time.&quot;\n\nThe form of Primus smiled a wide and beaming grin.\n\n&quot;You have chosen wisely my child- they shall join you\nshortly.&quot;\n\nWith that, Shadimus felt something wierd happen inside\nhim, as he saw the Primus in the Matrix, fly binside\nhim and assimilate itself, before suddenyly finding\nhimself in the present day. Shadimus sat for a minute,\ndazed and confused, getting his bearings back before\nslowly rising, feeling very light headed as he did so.\n\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
