He did not like his tone of voice, and \nfelt that his explanation could have been a little less brash.  Especially \nwhen you&#39;re addressing a Prime officer.  His expression hardens quickly.\n\n&quot; I appreciate your concerns but I do NOT appreciate your tone of voice! \nIt&#39;s as if you&#39;re trying to stop me from doing what needs to be done!  This \nwar can not be fought by ourselves, they out number us! And I will do \neverything in my power to be sure that our numbers stay stable!&quot;\n\nStraight Shot swallows hard, she holds Elita in her arms, knowing that when \nTucson loses his temper, the whole planet would pretty much know that it was \ntime to leave him alone.\n\n&quot;Not good, so not good.  If there&#39;s one thing I learned was not ta get on \nTucson&#39;s bad side. Not pretty.&quot;\n\nShe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve seen what happens when someone pushes his buttons the wrong way. He&#39;s \nlike Ratchet, but kind of three times worse.  If he wants ta turn a bot inta \nscrap metal, he&#39;ll do it.  It&#39;s happened before..  Umm, maybe I shouldn&#39;t - \nhave mentioned that huh?&quot;\n\nQuickstride now hears Tucson raising his voice, and looks up to him.\n\n&quot;Uh ohh..  Something tells me we better take cover.&quot;\n\nIt was apparent in the clenching of his fists, that Tucson was quite ready \nto defend his arguements in any means possible.  It was what he did when he \noften lost his temper.  Straight Shot takes the brave step to try and calm \nhim down.\n\n&quot;Hey, maybe you guys can work something out?  You&#39;re right, we do need help \nbut Legacy&#39;s right too.  It might upset the time balance if we attempt ta \nwake up the Ark too soon.&quot;\n\nTucson turns to her.\n\n&quot; Remember what Master Yokitron told us vorns ago?&quot;\n\nShe nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes, sometimes the unthinkable must be the thinkable.  It was his way of \nsaying that in desperate times, desperate measures can not be avoided.  Even \nif the balance of time does get disrupted.&quot;\n\nHe nodds.\n\n&quot; Exactly.  We need help, and maybe it isn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime, \nbut we must try and revive others to assist us in battle.  Legacy, I warn \nyou now, insubordination will not be tolerated.  Am I understood?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He kneels next to the body of Optimus Prime, as a strong desire to do \n&gt; &gt; so, compells him to place a hand upon his chest, where his Matrix lays \n&gt; &gt; dorment. He did not know what to expect but something was telling him to \n&gt; &gt; do exactly what he was doing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I - think I may have something that belongs to you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NO YOU DO NOT&quot; The cold voice of Legacy, the Ark&#39;s temporal guardian\n&gt; can be heard as he stood on the other side of the large form Optimus.\n&gt; His single cyclopean gaze watched Tuscon unflichingly as the slight\n&gt; tingling sensation of a forceshield could be seen and felt as it\n&gt; extended itself over Optimus Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Autobots and Decepticons must remain undesturbed.&quot; Legacy&#39;s voice\n&gt; is authoritative and final. &quot;Any disrutpution of them, even a\n&gt; reinfusement of his matrix with any that you contain risks a temporal\n&gt; contamination.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy began to walk towards Tuscon, &quot;I do not know what you intend to\n&gt; do Tuscon.&quot; Legacy gestured towads the other fallen Autobots and\n&gt; Decepticons in the room, &quot;But it is my primary function to protect\n&gt; them and their role in the temporal unfolding that is to come, to\n&gt; protect not just the present but the future that is to come. Whatever\n&gt; your plan, it cannot involve them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
