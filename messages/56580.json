He \n&gt; &gt; screeched as his chest burst with an electric explosion, missile \n&gt; shrapnel was \n&gt; &gt; mixed in with his robotic organs, his snake skin was lying around \n&gt; him in \n&gt; &gt; shards. He knew better then to try and transform, but the nano \n&gt; system would \n&gt; &gt; no begin if he didn&#39;t... &quot;N-n-n-nightV-v-I-perrrrr Terrrrrorize!&quot; \n&gt; He screamed \n&gt; &gt; as hi changed... what lay against the tree was what some would \n&gt; describe as a \n&gt; &gt; &quot;roadkill&quot; The hood was gone shredded the snake face was skeletal \n&gt; down one \n&gt; &gt; side its eyes were blinded. The body itself was skinless, and \n&gt; almost zombie \n&gt; &gt; like. &quot;Eeeeeraghhh!&quot; He coiled himself into a knot and hugged \n&gt; against the \n&gt; &gt; tree as his entire body began sparking... Through the pain all he \n&gt; could think \n&gt; &gt; about was StarStorm, He let his snake tongue flick out and he \nwent \n&gt; towrads \n&gt; &gt; the direction she last headed, but as soon as he began to slither \n&gt; another \n&gt; &gt; pulse of electricity went though him and his body went into \nstasis \n&gt; lock. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ssstarssstorm.....&quot; He blacked out and lay silent.\n\n\n"}}
