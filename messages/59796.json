Something was not right- Tyrael was\n&gt; not prone to rash action- whatever he just found, it\n&gt; must have been something worthy of some serious worry.\n&gt;  Brisky walking over to Tyrael, he decided that\n&gt; whatever it was, they were all best prepared if they\n&gt; knew exactly what they were dealing with.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What is it?
