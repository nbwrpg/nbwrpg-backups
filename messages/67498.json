Also I can only assume that since no one\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; responded before when I was verifying positions, everyone save for\n&gt; &gt; Cy=\r\nclonus, Scourge, Rodimus, Remus, and the sweeps was still at \nAtlantis\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nduring the battle??? Which would mean that all would have some \ndistance\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; to make up before they would catch up with Cyc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also I am havin=\r\ng to assume that Cyclonus and crew are being shot \nat\n&gt; &gt; BEFORE they fade =\r\nfrom visual range, but they are moving fast. Cyc \nis\n&gt; &gt; not going to hang =\r\naround. So please consider my responses an \namending\n&gt; &gt; of my last post.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the air, the fading from view but not quite g=\r\none Cyclonus is \nmoving\n&gt; &gt; swiftly through the air. His body is digesting =\r\nthe new power it \nhas\n&gt; &gt; recieved and is enjoying it. Power flows through =\r\nhis circuits as \nhis\n&gt; &gt; own systems merge with the now corrupted power of =\r\nthe matrix. His \nform\n&gt; &gt; seems to radiate a new power, his fusion powered =\r\nengines \nthrusting him\n&gt; &gt; foward at amazing speeds. He knew he would be ab=\r\nle to hold this \nnew\n&gt; &gt; power, his instructions from Unicron had said as m=\r\nuch, but the \nsheer\n&gt; &gt; power was almost intoxicating. Internally he smiled=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was then that bullets from a gatling gun caught up with him, =\r\n\nlightly\n&gt; &gt; scored his armor and then fell behind as the Cyclonus whipped =\r\n\nfoward!\n&gt; &gt; It was not that the guns lacked power, but simply the speed th=\r\nat \nthese\n&gt; &gt; ships were flying and the distance they were away, by the tim=\r\ne the\n&gt; &gt; bullets caught up they were as pebbles striking titanium shields.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Howerever Cyclonus did have a response as twin missiles errupted=\r\n \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; beneath his wings. For a moment the missiles seemed to hover \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; as they changed direction orienting on thier target. Then they \nburst\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n into explosive movement, glowing with encapselated power. Rather \nthen\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n missiles with flame behind them as Cyclonus&#39; missiles looked \nbefore,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthey were now like twin suns as they fairly irradiated power and\n&gt; &gt; destru=\r\nction as they moved toward the source of the bullets: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the miss=\r\niles streak passed, the sweeps fall in behind Cyclonus \nand\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, fo=\r\nrming a protective shield as they pick up speed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the moment Re=\r\nmus is ignored as the Unicronians moved foward,\n&gt; &gt; picking up speed!\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; ______________________________=\r\n____________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen pal. \n&gt; &gt; Text or chat wit=\r\nh friends inside Yahoo!
