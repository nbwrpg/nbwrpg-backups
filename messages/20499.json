Her shoulder felt like it was on fire. She \ngroaned a bit, but didn&#39;t stop. The snow was falling harder now.  She \nlooked back behind her and saw the massive paw prints. She \nsmiled. &quot;At least I&#39;m not as small as I used to be.&quot; She turned and \nkept walking north.  \n\nShe looked out and saw a large patch of ice. She tapped the ice with \nher paw. It looked solid enough. She stepped out onto the ice. About \nhalf way out, she saw fish, trapped in the ice. Her noce picked up on \nthe scent and she felt her empty stomach growl a little. She \nscratched at the ice, trying to get to the fish. She managed to pull \none fish out. But it wasn&#39;t even a mouthful.  But it wasn&#39;t all that \nbad either. She saw another one and pawed at the ice.  She stopped \npawing when she heard a loud crack. &quot;Oh no..that doesn&#39;t sound to \ngood.&quot;  She hear another loud crack as the ice under her started to \ngive way. She moved just in time and watches the ice fall into the \nwater. She sighed and looked at the hole in the ice. She wished she \nhad a fishing pole right then. She sighed and kept walking north. She \njust ignore her shoulder and kept walking. Leaving a small trail as \nshe walked. The wound wasn&#39;t closing, and a small part of the metal \nskeleton could be seen at the joint.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Blah! GTG.
