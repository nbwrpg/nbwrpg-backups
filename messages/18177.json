It \nslided down to the metal center of her shoulder.  She roared out and \nslashed at Blenders face with bother her front claws and tried to \nbite his neck or shoulder. She was extremely angery and wasn&#39;t going \nto hold back.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blender swiped his saw blade at Feline&#39;s face as she jumped close. \nThen\n&gt; Blender was hit by Scavenger&#39;s shots.
