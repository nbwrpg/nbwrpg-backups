Fracturcon quickly does a self d=\r\niagnostic to insure his CR chamber has completely repaired him.  The diagno=\r\nstic computer soon says, &quot;Operating at 100% efficency.&quot;  As soon as Fractur=\r\ncon hears the results he makes his way to his main computer.\nFracturcon:&quot;Ca=\r\nlculate distances from all Predicon, Maximal, & Alliance bases.  Also give =\r\nme a run down of all human tribes scattered across the planet.&quot;\n\nAs the com=\r\nputer begins it&#39;s scans and calculations, Fracturcon walks over to a contai=\r\nner with a Skull & Crossbone insignia on it.  As Fracturcon gazes upon the =\r\ninsignia a grim, yet sad, expression comes over his face.\n\nFracturcon: &quot;If =\r\nthe computer calculations are what I think they are, I may have no choice b=\r\nut to take the ultimate step in preserving our history, even if it means de=\r\nstorying part of this planet.  All might not be lost, if I can recruit some=\r\n bots from each faction, I may be able to eliminate Earth&#39;s intruders witho=\r\nut resorting to the doomsday weapon.\n\nAs Fracturcon stares at the container=\r\n the computer blips & then says, &quot;Calculations complete.  All faction bases=\r\n are within target area.  Human loses are within acceptable parameters & wi=\r\nll not result in alteration of current timeline.&quot;\n\nFracturcon grins & think=\r\ns to himself, &quot;Game set & match you Transforming scum.  I hold the final ke=\r\ny to Earth&#39;s victory.&quot;\n\nFracturcon:&quot;Computer, locate transformer Dinobot & =\r\nsend message Code Red.  Message is to read: Dinobot I know of your heroic d=\r\needs when you fought alongside Optimus Primal & the Maximals during the fir=\r\nst Beast Wars.  I also know the ultimate price you were willing to pay to p=\r\nerserve Earth&#39;s history & it&#39;s human inhabitants.  I am here to make sure t=\r\nhe timeline is not corrupted by the current factions of Maximal & Predicons=\r\n.  I have weapon in my possession that will insure all Transformers, includ=\r\ning myself, will not make it off this planet alive.  I am prepared to use t=\r\nhis weapon to insure that the timeline will not be altered by the current B=\r\nEast War taking place on this planet.  I would rather find a  more acceptab=\r\nle solution to the problem though.  I respect and admire your code of honor=\r\n for which you live by & request your help in putting a more peaceful end t=\r\no the BEast Wars.  Please meet me at this location which I have transmitted=\r\n along with this message.&quot;\n\nAnd with that the message ends and the corrodin=\r\nates for Fracturcon&#39;s base is transmitted to Dinobot.\n\nFracturcon walks to =\r\nthe entrance & waits.  He waits & hopes that the Beast Wars greatest warrio=\r\nr will come & aid him in stopping the war.  If not he knows the only other =\r\noption he has is to destory what he vowed he would never destroy again.\n\n**=\r\n***Internet E-Mail Confidentiality**********************************\nNotice=\r\n:  This e-mail may contain information which is privileged and confidential=\r\n.
