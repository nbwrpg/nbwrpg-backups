Beast mode.&quot; Sniper turns into his beast mode as his \ncomputer starts internal repairs. &quot;So, why does it look like the ark \nisn&#39;t as habited as it used to be?&quot; Sniper didn&#39;t know of the new \nmaximal base. He guessed that when he sees Prowl, Striker, or maybe \none of the other bots then he could tell them his story of why he \nfired oon this bot. Yes, he was a maximal, His plan was something\nthat \nback fired. His plan was to be the death of Hell Beast. He would \nsneak into the Predacon ranks and when him and Hell Beast were alone. \nHe would kill Hell Beast. But now Hell Beast is gone. he could use \nHell Beast leaving in his story. But he had to wait till the right \nperson before he told his story. Someone with about as much rank as\nhe \nhad before he put his plan to action. He looked at the two bots that \ncaptored him. &quot;So are we leaving now or what?&quot; Sniper was ready to \nleave for the Brig. &quot;So who is my escort?&quot;   \n\n\n"}}
