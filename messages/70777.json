But when Rodimus was taken, like you my heart spark felt \n&gt; like it had shattered into a thousand pieces.  But I can tell you this. I \n&gt; feel it deep down inside my spark, that your mother will return to you and \n&gt; she will be very happy to see you once again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He listens to voices comming from the other&#39;s direction.  He then turns \n&gt; his head back to Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; About Perceptor, he really is trying hard to redeem himself, yet, I \n&gt; don&#39;t think the others quite understand how hard it is to do such a thing. \n&gt; Like you, I see it too.  He&#39;s trying very hard to become one of us, but \n&gt; there are a few of our comrades who do not have as much faith as we do. \n&gt; Faith is important if we&#39;re going to combat Hydras.  We&#39;ll need it, and if \n&gt; you have that faith, so do I.  Come, I think it&#39;s time we had a talk with \n&gt; the other Autobots and Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gently carries Elita in his arm, and walks back into the room where Kup \n&gt; and the others are.  His expression was quite serious at this point, yet \n&gt; not one that would indicate anger so to speak.  Rat Trap now sees his \n&gt; expression and looks to the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I - do believe this is a good time for me ta go out&#39;n try ta find \n&gt; somethn&#39; ta eat.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gets into rat mode.  Quickstride transforms into his equine mode, and \n&gt; follows him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yep, right on, my stomach&#39;s growling too..  Wonder if there&#39;s any more of \n&gt; those bean pods out there..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift and Straight Shot also read the expression on their leader&#39;s \n&gt; face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, this would be a good time ta look for Energon deposits that we can \n&gt; convert inta useable energy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds and joins Night Shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good idea, never know when we&#39;ll need more fuel.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was now alone with everyone in the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If we&#39;re going to gain the upper hand on Hydras, we have mostly \n&gt; everything we need, except for one thing, which is most imperative to our \n&gt; cause.  Faith.  We have that with each other, but when it comes to those \n&gt; who are trying to turn over a new leaf, I see a lack of it.  I can not \n&gt; stress enough on the importance of all around faith in each other.  If we \n&gt; do not have that, we are not ready to confront our worst enemy.  Rodimus \n&gt; would surely agree with me, that faith is of the essence, because at \n&gt; first, I too was distrustful of Rodimus once he had been freed of the \n&gt; shell program.  But now I see where that distrust would have gotten me, \n&gt; and I too had to come around and give faith a chance.  I know we can do \n&gt; that, we&#39;re Autobots and Maximals.  We believe in each other, and now, \n&gt; among us, is a Predacon who has shown great courage by helping us here \n&gt; now.  Please, do not let distrust weaken your faith.  It&#39;s what Hydras \n&gt; would want, to see us fall and I&#39;m not about to let that happen, and \n&gt; neither should any of you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stands tall, holding Elita in his arm.  His posture as clearly as \n&gt; strong as Optimus Prime&#39;s, as well as his vocalizer which now bears \n&gt; striking resemblence to that of the legendary Autobot leader.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ELita:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita smiled when she heard how was her dad as younger then her smile\n&gt;&gt; quickly faded &quot;before my parent were captured...

Before I was rendered blind, we&#39;d do many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; missions side by side.  Of course, him being Hot Rod, a sports vehcile \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; me, an average compact SUV, off roading vehicle, with no interest in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; speed, we&#39;d often kid each other about speed versus rugged durability \n&gt;&gt; &gt; over\n&gt;&gt; &gt; off road terrain.  One day, we were driving toward a mission to stop\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s path of destruction, when our path got blasted by unknown\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enemy fire.  We knew we couldn&#39;t let a rock slide stop us, and we \n&gt;&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I knew I could&#39;ve just drove over it, and gotten to the other side with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problem. But Rodimus wasn&#39;t built for that in his alt form.  We never \n&gt;&gt; &gt; left\n&gt;&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s side that day.  We found a way to get around that obsticle\n&gt;&gt; &gt; together, even though we had conflicting ideas on how to do it, but,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; eventually we did compromise and we thwarted Galvatron with the aid of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other Autobots.  Sometimes opposites work well together, and Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; proved it that day.  I guess that&#39;s what drove me to rescue him. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t think of how I would manage, if I had not had him by my side.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He gently rubs Elita&#39;s shoulders.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I wish I could remember what happened to Bumblebee and Spike, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kremzeem, but after I was rendered off line for several vorns, I lost a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; good portion of my memory. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Like Rodimus, Tucson&#39;s gentile embrace takes on a paternal aspect. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; holds Elita as if she were his own.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; And don&#39;t you worry about your mother, Stanton will find a way to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; bring\n&gt;&gt; &gt; her back, I&#39;m sure of it.  But you also have to keep that hope alive in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your heart.  The more hope, the more chances of her healing.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson was now swapping his status to a more parental role.  It felt \n&gt;&gt; &gt; good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to be with Elita, and right at this moment, he wasn&#39;t about to trade \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; joy with anything else.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elita:ow\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elita took Tucson&#39;s Hand as a lost child seeking  a friend, she was in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; her\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; robot mode that had a strong look of Nightlight with the golden-red\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; colors\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Mom told me that story... and other ones...
