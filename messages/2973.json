Holds the Locket and the\n&gt; Holocube she gave him. As he enters the weapon room &quot;I hate blasters\nrelics\n&gt; of an Archaic age if only I could find something better.&quot; Liono  picks up\nthe\n&gt; Lion&#39;s Claw and attaches the twin pulse Cannon to forearm and loads\nChaingun\n&gt; in the Lion&#39;s mouth in the center of his chest. Liono exits the weapon\nroom\n&gt; sealing it with his private code forbidding entry to those that lack his\n&gt; code. Liono enters his chamber goes to the back wall where grabs his Sword\n&gt; from its case.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tigerhawk sits in the secure sector hard at work on the on the Terra Star\nas\n&gt; he installs the lends and defense/heat shielding plate. He continues to\nweld\n&gt; the plates on with a torch.\n&gt;\n&gt; Liono exits chamber as he scans for the other signatures starts racing\n&gt; throughout the hallways. As Liono arrives at the corner before the others\ncan\n&gt; see him and places a small transparent cube on the ceiling and waits until\n&gt; Prowl and Iron pass by and A Liono slides out Cutting off Plissanta and\nCrew.\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m asking you nicely to leave.&quot;\n&gt; ((The Liono at the corner is a Hologram))\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Want to win airfare to Vegas for you and 20 friends, $15,000 and a\n&gt; suite at Bellagio for New Year&#39;s?
