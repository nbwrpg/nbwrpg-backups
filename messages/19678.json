He frowns, looking at his wrist comp and \nscanning through the reports. That wasn&#39;t right... The ship that had \nexploded had emitted almost no energy, not enough to even register on \nmore than visuals. The pods seemed real though..\n\n&quot;WarMachine,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;There are a few pods near the \nbase, could you retreave them?&quot;\n\nWith that, Zardus walks into the lab. &quot;Strap down anything fragile,&quot; \nhe says to Lady Hawk and Squizzy, &quot;We&#39;re moving to a new base. Or \nrather moving this base to it.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWarMachine nods as he recieves Zardus&#39; transmission. &quot;On my way,&quot; he \nsays, heading for the pods.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike waits for Life to answer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica enters the bridge of the Alliance base, sitting down at the \nscanners, frowning as he recieves the transmission.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer frowns as he sees the gun in Vamprah&#39;s hand. Reaching out \ncarefully, he tries to take the gun from her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk got an idea, maybe having an assistant wasn&#39;t such a bad \nidea.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Say, you wouldn&#39;t know how to find CR information for a repaired \nbot would\n&gt; you? These systems just aren&#39;t up to the standards meant for a bot \nof my\n&gt; status.&quot; She was hoping that Squizzy could gain the information she \ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; find.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I could make it worth your effort to help me gain the information I \nneed.&quot;\n&gt; Lady Hawk knew that a bot with the information she&#39;d given would \nhave to\n&gt; fully understand the technology involved.
