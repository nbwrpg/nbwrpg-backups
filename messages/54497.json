Switching it on to full power \ncauses quite a wind, and Jackie smiles behind his protective \nfaceplate.  He&#39;s partly counting on that wind to keep him safe.\n\nThe Autobot opens the main doors just far enough for his sample drone \nto get through, and gives his windmaker one final adjustment to make \nsure it&#39;s blowing the right way.  Then he opens a three-foot hole in \nthe shields and sends the plastic &#39;bot on its way.  &quot;Taking sample \nnow,&quot; he reports over the comm, raising his voice to compensate for \nthe loud whirring of the fan.  &quot;No problems thus far.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; Kup(via commlink): Hmm, that&#39;s a good idea.
