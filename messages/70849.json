&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus wont be very happy if we delete all her memories togehter the\n&gt; corrupted programs&quot;hisse Perceptor&quot;it msut exist away to do it... could we\n&gt; contain her memories and delete the programs? or insolate one and eraser \n&gt; it\n&gt; and then erase the other?&quot;\n\nLegacy looked like he was about to say something when Santon stepped\nin smoothly. &quot;Legacy is right.&quot; Santon started with with a casual nod\nto the larger and more formidable temporal soldier. &quot;But he is also\nmore linear.&quot; Santon said as he looked at Perceptor. &quot;Sometimes too\nlinear.&quot;\n\nLegacy&#39;s optic flashed but he remained silent.\n\n&quot;He is right in that memory and personality are interdependent. One\nsupports the other.&quot; Santon pointed to Nightlight, &quot;If we keep her\nmemories but delete her programming then she will remember that she\nloves Rodimus but without a personality structure to back that then\neither her files will become corrupt or her personality matrix will\ncreate a reason which may recreate the problem that was there in the\nfirst place.&quot;\n\nSanton frowned, &quot;What do you think her personality will do with the\nmemories of her evil deeds, her desires to do them, how she felt when\nshe did them?&quot;\n\nSanton paused thoughtfully as Bump turned away from his console and\nspoke. &quot;If we are going to do this then we will have to create a\ntotally new personality profile, one that will take into account her\nentire store of memories.&quot;\n\nSanton nodded, &quot;Yeah, what if don&#39;t delete the personality, since it\nis already there, but modify it?&quot; Santon looked at Legacy and then\nPerceptor, not sure if what he was saying was really possible.\n\nIf it were possible, Legacy looked unsure as well. This was all new\nterritory for them as well.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
