But she knew that she had to be a role model,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and knew in her own heart, that Tucson wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he was going to bring Rodimus back, no matter what was thrown in front \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him.  She goes over to Elita, as Rat Trap follows her, wanting to help \n&gt;&gt; &gt; her\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out as well.  For a moment, they hold hands as they both smile into \n&gt;&gt; &gt; each\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other&#39;s eyes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot then goes to Elita, and puts a gentile hand on her \n&gt;&gt; &gt; shoulder.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; On Earth, there&#39;s this popular term known as &quot;The Knight in Shining\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Armor.&quot;  Who would ride into the occasion and smite evil demons when \n&gt;&gt; &gt; they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; threatened to cast darkness and dispair on the innocent.  Even though \n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t ride a horse with fancy armor, and carry a lance and a shield,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson is one of those Knights.  He won&#39;t give up until the dragon or \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this case, the insect is slayed and Rodimus brought safely back to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness.  He will win this battle for Rodimus, I know he will.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap thinks for a moment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Ya know, she&#39;s got a point Elita, everything Wheels did up till now, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything he actually succeeded in doing, that took real courage and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; determination and in those days, on Earth, that&#39;s what medevil knights \n&gt;&gt; &gt; are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; made of. So yeah, he&#39;s definitely one of them, a Knight in shining \n&gt;&gt; &gt; silver\n&gt;&gt; &gt; armor and when the lights strike against his paint job, he&#39;ll blind the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; eyes of those who aren&#39;t used to such light.  Your dad&#39;ll be saved, I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he will.  Wheels ain&#39;t gonna leave a fight unfaught.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Night Shift walks over to them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Bet your rear bumpers he&#39;s not.  He&#39;s gonna kick bug aft big time, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; when he does, he ain&#39;t gonna stop there, he&#39;s gonna fight hard until\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there&#39;s some sorta sense of peace on this planet. It&#39;s who he is and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he does.  And it&#39;s that drive that earned him his name in the first \n&gt;&gt; &gt; place.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Eventually the Decepticons, Predacons and Unicronians are gonna \n&gt;&gt; &gt; definitely\n&gt;&gt; &gt; know who he is and what he&#39;s capable of doing.  Any decendent of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Optimus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Prime is gonna be sure the job gets done.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; That gets a few heads to turn, as Quickstride, Rat Trap and Straight \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Shot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; look at him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; What&#39;dya say?  No way, really?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As Quickstride scratches behind an ear. Straight Shot and Rat Trap \n&gt;&gt; &gt; gawk.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Wha?  Ya mean all this time I fought with Tucson in the past, and all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; along, come ta find out he&#39;s related ta Optimus Prime? Wow...  I - had \n&gt;&gt; &gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; idea..  No wonder why he&#39;s got so much courage and determination and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; selflessness. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap chimes in.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, that sure explains a lot.  I knew there was somethn&#39; familliar\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about &#39;em, but I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it till Nightshift said\n&gt;&gt; &gt; somethn&#39;.  Yeah, it makes sense, his alt form, a large truck with a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; large\n&gt;&gt; &gt; trailer, he&#39;s just as tall, body features almost like Optimus Prime&#39;s..\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Slightly different but nearly the same.. And his voice, the patterns \n&gt;&gt; &gt; are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; almost like the big guy&#39;s..  But still I never really put that together\n&gt;&gt; &gt; until now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson doesn&#39;t know that I know about it.  I just so happened ta look \n&gt;&gt; &gt; up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; somethn&#39; in his file one day, when he asked me ta look over it for &#39;em \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there it was.  Same molds used ta build Optimus.  Of course a lotta \n&gt;&gt; &gt; things\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were changed over the years, and Tucson came out different, color sceme\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and all, but he&#39;s definitely got Optimus Prime&#39;s attributes and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; physical\n&gt;&gt; &gt; strength.  Well, that came after he got the power of the Matrix..  But \n&gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sure had the back bone when he was just his normal self.  And Elita, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can count on him ta deliver, and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s gonna do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; They all now gather around Elita to offer their reassurance.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PErceptor/Elita:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Amazing&quot; say dryly Perceptor while he senzed all that power&quot;None of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Predacons had held such power&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Then his practical mind focused in wish Rodimus and tucson back and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; well,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kup prayed to PRimus for the comming back of their friends.

A power so simple yet so powerful \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those with pure hearts possess it.  You&#39;re feeling it too, you have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; power, we all do.  We just gotta tap into it, and let it be felt by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and Rodimus Prime.  If they can feel that we&#39;re pulling for them,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; find the strength to make it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap smiles back to them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;She&#39;s right Silverbolt, we can do this, we got what it takes, it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; our\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hearts, and no one can take that away from us, no one.
