We would be rid of both at once, not having to forsake a\n&gt;   single bot on the venture.  If only there was a way to con those goody\n&gt;   goodies into believing that self sacrifice was the only way. Perhaps\n&gt;   even going so far as to have them reprogrammed into doing so. Someone\n&gt;   could perhaps sneak into thier base and reprogram thier cr chambers.\n&gt;   Inserting a program to which they must obey and in killing Unicron get\n&gt;   themselves killed in the process. Killing two bots with one shot, as\n&gt;   it were.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
