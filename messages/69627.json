He concentrates the energy from hi=\r\ns all wheel drive systems into that one hand and uses it as a vise around R=\r\nodimus&#39;s fist.  \n\n&quot; Trust me, I don&#39;t want to do this Rodimus.  I&#39;m not get=\r\nting any enjoyment out of what I&#39;m doing.  But if this is the only way to g=\r\net through to you, then so be it.&quot;\n\nWith his free hand, Tucson now concentr=\r\nates the all wheel drive power into his left arm, and manages to twist Rodi=\r\nmus&#39;s arms behind him, holding him in a powerful grapple.  His hands clamp =\r\ndown painfully hard onto Rodimus&#39;s arms, and his grip remains as solid as a=\r\n powerful vise.  \n\n&quot; You fail to see that what Hydras, Scourge and Cyclonus=\r\n are doing, is merely using you as a pawn.  They&#39;ve tampered with you and h=\r\nave no intentions of giving you power. All they want is the power you posse=\r\nss, and it appears they are succeeding in doing so.  I know you have it wit=\r\nhin you to conquor this hold they have over you. You just have to want it b=\r\nad enough to do it.  The Rodimus I know would NEVER fall to such low standa=\r\nrds.  THE RODIMUS I KNOW WOULD BE STRONG AND RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BE=\r\nFALL HIM!  But I see you are not that Rodimus anymore.  You have become no =\r\nbetter than MEGATRON!  IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!  TO HAVE A HISTORY THE SAME =\r\nAS THE INFAMOUS DECEPTICON LEADER WHO WROTE HIS OWN DEMISE?!  TO HAVE EVERY=\r\nONE DESPISE YOU AND WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO DESTROY YOU?!  IS THAT HOW YO=\r\nU WISH TO BE REVERED?!  I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!  DO YOU HEAR ME, I WILL=\r\n NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!&quot;\n\nHe finally rams Rodimus up against a wall with a po=\r\nwerful slam, and holds him there.\n\n&quot;BY THE NAME OF PRIMUS I WILL NOT LOSE M=\r\nY LEADER TO CORRUPTED FORCES!&quot;\n\nDetermination mixed with rage.  It was what=\r\n Tucson was now feeling.  He had been subdued enough, and now he was itchin=\r\ng to show his true colors.  Even though he had used a bit of brute strength=\r\n against Rodimus, he takes great care not to damage him gravely.\n\n--- In nb=\r\nwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot; I&#39;m =\r\nsure you wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do this either Optimus, and \n&gt; &gt;I can see =\r\nwhy that sometimes the hardest lessons are learned when you face an \n&gt; &gt;ene=\r\nmy upon who has been your comrade for many years. But if this were you, I \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;trust you would do the same.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment, as Rodimus stood there =\r\nbefore this somewhat smaller Autobot there was a brief moment of clarity, a=\r\n small instant of indecision. This Autobot showed a bravery and strength th=\r\nat seemed oddly familiar to him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot; All right, have it your way Rodim=\r\nus. This is going to hurt me \n&gt; &gt;more than it will hurt you.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; However=\r\n the moment passed as the dark Predacon shell programming that twisted his =\r\nown kicked in. He smiled, as he cracked his knuckles, &quot;You&#39;re right, this i=\r\ns *will* hurt you more than it will hurt me.&quot; Rodimus replied in mocking to=\r\nnes. \n&gt; \n&gt; With a quick motion he stepped foward to snap a quick punch towa=\r\nrds Tuscon&#39;s head, ready to end this battle with this little upstart Autobo=\r\nt - there was something about him that annoyed him!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime Cy=\r\nclonus and Scourge had stepped back; watching the opening of the battle wit=\r\nh looks of eagerness as they studied the moves of both combants.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
