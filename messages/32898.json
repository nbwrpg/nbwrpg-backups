He lands on his butt, firing a large barrauge of\nweaponfire from his various weapons, all at Abominus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAutofire was about halfway across the ocean, and speeding toward the\nDark Avion.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gestalt_menasor@y... wrote:\n&gt; Speedbreaker starts to lower towards the rest of the Decepticons, \n&gt; letting go of Symphony for safety measures, from 50 feet in the air. \n&gt; He then lands, &quot;Speedbreaker reporting for duty.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron snarls at Autofire&#39;s pull out of the battle. This was a most \n&gt; disapointing result for a plan, but he had anticipated this turn in \n&gt; events. It was time for the Decepticons to move out of the vulnerable \n&gt; position they were in. He remembered the G1 Predacon ship. He stepped \n&gt; out of Astroblast, and looked at his troops. &quot;Astroblast, I hope they \n&gt; are out of the jamming zone, radio Autofire, and tell him to meet me \n&gt; here&quot;. He then looked at both the new robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:If so could you repost, also would my teamates mind if I posted \n&gt; for him now?\n&gt; \n&gt; Abominus let out a anamalistic growl, and aimed both of his shoulder \n&gt; cannons at Galaxor, still on the ground, and lets loose a burst of \n&gt; power. &quot;Abominus....Cru....Crus.....Destroy&quot;, he uttered in a hollow \n&gt; empty voice.\n\n\n"}}
