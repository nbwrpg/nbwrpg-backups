Shut the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hell up.  The best you can do is yell and call\n&gt; names to people?  \n&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s your best then just be quiet.  It&#39;s\n&gt; unproductive and it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; irritating as hell since it has no purpose.  You\n&gt; want to complain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like a ninny, do it PRIVATELY.  Dewboy&#39;s ideas\n&gt; have been creative \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting, the only problem is they don&#39;t fit\n&gt; in that well with \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RPG and once he gets used to it he&#39;ll have some\n&gt; pretty darn good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas, and I&#39;m betting far better ones than you\n&gt; have ever or will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ever come up with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, to simplify, shut up with the OOCs where you\n&gt; insult everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ja?
