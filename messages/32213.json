If you cna convince him and allow\nme to do some mechanical &#39;repairs&#39; to his cerebal circuts i may be\nable to completely get rid of his old memories completely by erasing\nall that happened before this amnesia came on....but there is a chance\nthat i could reawaken the memories while i am at it causing him to\nrevert to his old self...whatever that may be...before i can erase it.\nSo it is up to you and the others if you would like me to do this\nlittle &#39; repair&#39;.
