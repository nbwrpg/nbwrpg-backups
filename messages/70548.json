He turned back to Kup, &quot;Also I\n&gt; have heard that a new Prime has been raised, in addition to Rodimus\n&gt; that is already here. Torca&#39;s optics looked troubled, &quot;Never has this\n&gt; been the case before of having TWO Primes serving together and the\n&gt; High council has become troubled by it. They do not know what this\n&gt; means.&quot;\n\n&quot;At least that no means a big brawl&quot; said dryly Perceptor&quot;If two predacons \ncomanders were in same base, that will end in a civil war&quot;\n\nKup shoock his head &quot;I&#39;m worried about Nightlight... she was acting estrange \nin the predacon base...
