The warden from outside through the door.  Celeron from behind a console and the captian crouching near the door.\n\nBOOM!\n\nThe door boke open revealing the heartstopping ominous figure of Fumeral, armed to the teeth.  Fumeral leveled a barage of energy weapon fire at Celeron.  He began to walk forward by was knocked back by the Warden&#39;s powerful weapons.  The captain threw a granade behind Fumeral and a few seconds later it went off sending shrapnal flying and gaping holes in the walls near it.  Fumeral was knocked off his feet then a piece of the structure caved in on him, Temporarily pinning him to the floor.\n\nThe captian placed a device on Fumeral&#39;s back which disabled his motor functions essentially paralysing him.\n\n&quot;Captian...You may have caught me this time.  But I am not so easily broken.  One day, when you are sleeping.  I will make you suffer great pain!&quot;\n\n&quot;Fumeral...You have said that to me since you first came aboard.  You have anger problems.  It would have done you good to talk to our counselor but you insisted on killing her.  I have no choice but to deactivate you indefinitely.&quot;\n\n&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;\n\nThe Captain placed his hand behind Fumeral&#39;s neck and used a techinique which deactivate him as promised.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll put together a holding chamber.&quot;  Said the warden carrying Fumeral back down to the detention deck.\n\nCeleron stood up.  His hiding over.  Now came the long explanation to Captian.  Celeron hoped that he would not be mistaken for an escaped criminal.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nGet 25MB, POP3, Spam Filtering with LYCOS MAIL PLUS for $19.95/year.\nhttp://login.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus&ref=lmtplus\n\n"}}
