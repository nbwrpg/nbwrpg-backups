Welcome back Soundwave.&quot; Switcblade\n&gt; twirls his twin \n&gt; welders, and finishes welding on the last piece of\n&gt; plate armour for \n&gt; that Firestrike&#39;s new leg. &quot;What can I do for you\n&gt; two?&quot; He smiles \n&gt; nonchalantly as he leans against the wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave is about to speak when he is interupted by\n&gt; a commlink from \n&gt; Astrotrain. &quot;Astrotrain here, I&#39;m heading to Africa\n&gt; now, can you \n&gt; upload the coordinates of Spasstik to me?&quot; Soundwave\n&gt; turns and stars \n&gt; walking to the control room, &quot;One moment, Soundwave\n&gt; will bring \n&gt; update you.&quot; Soundwave leaves Frenzy and Switchblade\n&gt; in the lab.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he reaches the control room, he reaches for a\n&gt; keyboard, and \n&gt; types a few commands into it. A visual display of\n&gt; where Spasstik is \n&gt; appears on the monitors. &quot;Astrotrain, head to these\n&gt; coordinates.&quot; \n&gt; Soundwave uploads the coordinates to Astrotrain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Astrotrain transforms into Train mode, and starts\n&gt; accelerating. He \n&gt; transforms into Shuttle mode, and peels away from\n&gt; the ground, as he \n&gt; heads towards Africa. &quot;Be there in about 30 mins,\n&gt; Astrotrain out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave stands there impassivly.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, back at Switcblade&#39;s lab,\n&gt; \n&gt; Switcblade&#39;s right eyebrow rises, &quot;You&#39;re still\n&gt; here?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Frenzy frowns, &quot;Your tin can doesn&#39;t pull enough\n&gt; weight... we bust \n&gt; our bust and get our asses kicked, and you laze\n&gt; around and drive our \n&gt; ship...&quot; Frenzy shakes his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade slowly walks across the room, to a table\n&gt; with a wierd \n&gt; looking piece of equipment, or a body part or\n&gt; something. Frenzy \n&gt; keeps his eyes on the Switchblade, not trusting him\n&gt; for a moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade picks up the thing, and points on end at\n&gt; Frenzy, &quot;This, \n&gt; my friend, is what I like to call an incinerator. In\n&gt; this case, it \n&gt; could incinerate you... or not.&quot; He picks up a piece\n&gt; of discarded \n&gt; shrapnel, and smiles, &quot;Watch and learn.&quot; He tosses\n&gt; the piece up, \n&gt; aims the thing at it, and as the shrapnel reaces the\n&gt; maximum height \n&gt; of it&#39;s trajectory, a burst of white hot fire spears\n&gt; out of now \n&gt; apparent weapon, melting the shrapnel into a little\n&gt; puddle at \n&gt; Frenzy&#39;s feet. &quot;Now, when you&#39;ve got something you\n&gt; want to say to \n&gt; me, come back.&quot; Switchblade levels the weapon at\n&gt; Frenzy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frenzy&#39;s eyes widden, and twitch from side to side,\n&gt; as the display \n&gt; unfolds.  &quot;I, uhh, bye!&quot; He backs out of the room,\n&gt; and slowly down \n&gt; the hall, back where he came from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade smiles. &lt;Foolish Frenzy&gt; He chuckles to\n&gt; himself, and \n&gt; continues his work.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Spasstik begins bounding away from the\n&gt; battlefield, holding \n&gt; Megatron\n&gt; &gt; carefully in his jaw.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frenzy arrives at the docked base holding onto\n&gt; Soundwave. (rAuq,\n&gt; &gt; whenever you want him, take him). Soundwave leaps\n&gt; into the air\n&gt; &gt; unfolding, and transforming into his large robot\n&gt; mode. He presses a\n&gt; &gt; button on his chest, opening a link to Astrotrain.\n&gt; &quot;Astrotrain, \n&gt; pick up\n&gt; &gt; Spasstik from Africa, then bring Abominus and the\n&gt; ship.&quot; He walks \n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; the ship followed by Frenzy, until he reaches\n&gt; Switchblade&#39;s lab.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frenzy folds his arms with a smug look on his\n&gt; face. &quot;Long time no \n&gt; see,\n&gt; &gt; Switchblade.&quot; he finishes with a small hint of\n&gt; disdain in his \n&gt; voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
