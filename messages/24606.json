Chordate was right. \nThe small gestalt had mangaged to do some damage to the hull, but not enough \nto be concerned with right now:\n\n&quot;Hull integrity just dropped to 79.5% and holding. If it drops below 60% we \nmay have a problem.&quot;\n\nThey needed the main console, but without the proper equipment there was \nnothing she or Chordate couldn&#39;t do about it. She got the impretion he \ndidn&#39;t really want her here, well tough. With the lockdown in effect she \nwasn&#39;t going anywhere.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
