Pantron closley by his side. They where quite a \nteam. Yes they where. But know they had to make a choice. They looked to the \nleft to the maximal bases direction. They then turned to the right towards \nthe destron base. They where torn between old bielefs and new recreations. \nThey each sent a comm to either base. Who ever replied fort they decided \nwould be their new home. The message just stated that they where two bots and \nthat they where searching for a new group.(one to the cf and one to the \nmagmatron&#39;s base.)\n\n"}}
