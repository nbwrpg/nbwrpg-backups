Enhanced senses\n&gt; wo=\r\nrked just fine in beast modes, but the cybertronian &#39;sensors&#39; did\n&gt; not see=\r\nm to operate as they should. There was a growing level of\n&gt; interference as=\r\n the approached the cave that was before them. It had\n&gt; been getting progre=\r\nssively worse as they came, but here, at the\n&gt; entrance, and presumably if =\r\nthey went in, it would spike as it became\n&gt; more pronounced.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nNow TH=\r\nAT was something that definitely piqued her attention.  THe Cybertronian &#39;s=\r\nenses&#39; were just mechanical approximations, they were still electronic base=\r\nd.  Enhanced hearing would work, but not using sonar for aerial pings.  Usi=\r\nng telescopic enhanced vision would work, but not using an infrared scanner=\r\n.  Whomever had set up this blocking system was incredibly specific for wha=\r\ntever reason, with what systems oeprated and what ones did not.  However, s=\r\nhe was able to begin to backtrack over towards the source of it, and use th=\r\ne spikes of increased blocking to try and..  Track it&#39;s source more effecti=\r\nvely, just going in the direction where she could sense less.\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; SK=\r\nYSHADOW nodded, as he stroked his chin, &quot;We must be getting close to\n&gt; the =\r\nsource of whatever this place is.&quot; He said thoughtfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I concur.&quot; C=\r\nRYOTEK said as he looked at DINOBOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Great!&quot; BANTOR said, &quot;Now if you=\r\n could just show this barrier we can\n&gt; get on our way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME grun=\r\nted, &quot;Easy Bantor.&quot; He said laying a calming hand on the\n&gt; FUZOR.&quot; He looke=\r\nd at CRYOTEK, &quot;I can feel the power of whatever this\n&gt; thing getting strong=\r\ner even as we stand here.&quot; He looked back a the\n&gt; cave, &quot;I don&#39;t think we h=\r\nave much more time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK nodded, &quot;Show us what you have DINOBOT.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nDINOBOT gave a low bow, &quot;In the tunnels, Sir, I will lead you do=\r\nwn towards where we were going with the others.  I can lead us or we can le=\r\nt one of the MAXIMALS go down.  Perhpas if the PRIME would care to take poi=\r\nnt down through the caveners?  It seems we can trace things simply by where=\r\n we cannot trace them effectively.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
