Now, any information?&quot;\nIris:&quot; Well, as you already know, the Predacon&#39;s have split up into two \ngropes, right? There are a few energy signatures at the Predacon base but \ntwo have just began to leave it. And there are a few more to the north, they \nwere travailing at 80 mph but now have slowed down considerably. Anything \nelse you would like to know?&quot;\n\n*Iron Raptor smiled, the system that she had been given by her creators was \nworking like a charm! She then noticed Plintissa looking over her shoulder \nbut turned back to the star.*\n\n&quot; No, that was all I needed to know. Thanx.&quot;\nIris: &quot; Now, about that upgrade?&quot;\n*Iron Raptor sighed and shook her head.*\n&quot; We&#39;ll see what I can scrounge up, Iris. I can&#39;t make any promises, you \nknow that.&quot;\nIris: *sigh*&quot; Yeah! I know. Well, I guess that you&#39;ll be deactivating me \nnow, huh?&quot;\n* Iron Raptor nodded*\n&quot; Afraid so. See you later then.&quot;\n* Iron Raptor disconnected her hand from the impute, took the cord from the \ncomputer screen and placed back in her wrist, the shades then slid back into \nher brow and she turned to Plintissa.The star on the screen now gone.*\n\n&quot; I was checking on the details of what Tigerhawk had told me about the \nPredacons, now I know more about their locations. Any further questions?&quot;\n\n( I know that this post was a long one but I&#39;ll try and make them shorter in \nthe future.)\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
