She missed him a lot and wished \nto see him again. Then again, he may not recongnize her in her new \nform. She wondered if he would still be happy to see her in her new \nform. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Yes, I understand. What am I supposed \nto do now? I&#39;m not fully complete yet.  This form is still changing. \nand I don&#39;t know...&quot; she stopped and doubled over as she clutched at \nher stomach.  Her internal circuits were in the last stages of \ngeneration.  She held onto the table for suport. She fell to her \nknees nd transformed into beast mode. The form was in finally stages \nof completetion.  Normall a bot is asleep through this and doesn&#39;t \nexperience pain, but she was wide awake and going through the ordeal. \nShe transformed into polar bear with the owl wings protruding from \nher shoulder blades. Her hands transformed into massive paws with \nhuge claws.  Her white fur now covered her completely and her eyes \nwere a pearcing bright blue. Her sence of smell and hearing was \ngreatly increased and she roared out a bear roar as she finished her \nchange.  She stood in beast mode and looked at Vertis. Her wings \nextended over her and her bear head up. She said in a shocked \nvoice, &quot;By the matrix....&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t reach him because your link was broken when I removed \nyour spark\n&gt; from his old body.&quot; he figured that was a logical assumption to \ntell her.\n&gt; &quot;Now you will just have to stop worrying about him for a while and \nstart\n&gt; thinking about yourself. You have a very unexpected form and will \nneed time\n&gt; to adjust. Lunarpine is a bigbot that can take care of himself.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis studied the readings he&#39;d been taking the whole time she was\n&gt; forming. He set down the results he&#39;d found, turned to her looked \nher\n&gt; directly in the eyes. &quot;Lunarpine promised he&#39;d return for you. I \nthink he&#39;d\n&gt; crawl on his belly if he had to. Any bot who&#39;d risk his own \nexistence to\n&gt; carry two sparks isn&#39;t one to give up easily. He&#39;ll be back.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
