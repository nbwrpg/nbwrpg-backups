I have been sick this week.\n&gt;&gt; Sore throat, Lost voice, generally achy and the lot of it all. I took\n&gt;&gt; several days off from work as well. I am coming to the mending side of\n&gt;&gt; things with judicious applications of NyQuil and Apple cider Vinegar,\n&gt;&gt; honey and Cheyenne pepper\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I hope to post soon. I generally don&#39;t have too much in the way of\n&gt;&gt; creativity when sick :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
