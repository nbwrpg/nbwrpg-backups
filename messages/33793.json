And\nas for interaction, if I don&#39;t interact with myself then my characters could\nto walk around for eternity. It&#39;s not fun interacting for me, altough I\ndon&#39;t know what it&#39;s like since everyone ignores my posts. And it depends on\nwhat happens in the future as my staying. And the rules about a member only\nbeing able to have 6 bots for each team screws me up, cause I happen to have\n7 with the alliance so I&#39;ll have to make one leave. I&#39;m not saying I hate\nthe new rules but they totally screwed my story lines and future ideas.\n\nSo, I guess I&#39;ll stay till I start to get tired of my stinky characters and\nslice their legs off. I guess I&#39;ll post one of my characters leaving the\nalliance and pretending I never brought those bots in. I thank anyone who\nread their posts and found them amusing, or someone who read their posts.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 04, 2001 1:27 AM\nSubject: Re: (unknown)\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t wanna argue about that, because that would require going into\n&gt; uncivil conversation, but I urge you to think about staying. 17 chars\n&gt; are very hard to have interact anyways, and its better to interact\n&gt; with other people&#39;s characters than your own.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;*Orchid*&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, but thats unfair to me because I post for all of my\n&gt; characters. And I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t see anything childish about it cause I never said I hated the\n&gt; rule. I\n&gt; &gt; simply said that I can&#39;t just get rid of those characters cause\n&gt; their the\n&gt; &gt; only thing that keeps me in this RPG and I can&#39;t get rid of some of\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; because they interact with each other tons.
