The CF is on lockdown. There is no way to get into the CF. Also, \nthe shields were up and only Firefox has the privelage of posting \ndamage on the CF.  If you somehow did get in, you&#39;d find that the \nbridge is under complete lockdown and can&#39;t be entered. If you \nsomehow got through that, you would find that the main console is \ncompletely destroyed, as are most of the other consoles, and that \nevery computer in the area is covered with a foot-thick metal plate \n(bridge lockdown). Only Hysteria and Chordate can cancel the lockdown \nright now (Kluster&#39;s left arm was removed, and it had his comm on it, \nwhich was his way to communicate with the CF from a distance). \nHysteria&#39;s comp is destroyed too I think, and Chordate is a hostage \nright now, so the lockdown is stuck in place. There is also a \nlockdown in the room containing the main core, so you wouldn&#39;t be \nable to get in there either.\n\n2. I don&#39;t think portable endless power-sources like that one are \nfair, so I&#39;m not going to allow it (unless a whole lot of people want \nit).\n\n3. Please post damage for all your chars.\n\n4. Rhinox wasn&#39;t in the CF. He was outside when the lockdown took \nplace, and therefore couldn&#39;t have gotten inside.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; [Forget the last post sent it without finishing.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime/Icedragon/Rhinox\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime puts up a stasis field. he opens a com to Icedragon.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;put the vortex in the main core of the CF the power will raise the \nshields \n&gt; again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Angel Prime lets down the stasis field and starts to fire fireballs \nat FZ.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Icedragon makes a mad dash toward the CF but one of the shots hit \nhis left \n&gt; foot. he falls down but gets back up and starts to run. he freexe a \nsmall \n&gt; part of the shields of the CF and flicks it giving him a couple of \nseconds \n&gt; to get threw it. after that he runs and heads to the Main Core \nplaces the \n&gt; Vortex opener right inside and opens it. the vortex opener will \nkeep under \n&gt; control while giving energy to the CF.
