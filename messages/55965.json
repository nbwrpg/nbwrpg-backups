Her body was limp as she had no \n&gt; energy left to resist. She opened her optics slightly, and out of the \n&gt; corner of her optic, she could see a male bot figure picking her up.  \n&gt; She couldn&#39;t tell who it was. But her wolf nose told her that it was \n&gt; another wolf bot. She was about to try to talk when a surge of pain \n&gt; ran through her belly. She threw her head back and arched her back in \n&gt; writhing agony. &quot;AAAHHHHHHHHH!&quot; screaming out in anguish.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The Maximal wolf looked at his Predacon opponent.
