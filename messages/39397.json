He was \n&gt;aiming\n&gt; &gt;his Sniper rifle at the crowd of a maximals.  He was there to assinate \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt;President of Macrosoft.  The Presidents Name was Bill Setag(Gates\n&gt; &gt;Backwards).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Just Then Mr. Setag move to the left.  MadMoo looked through the \n&gt;Scope\n&gt; &gt;one last time and fired.  Setag Robotic Head Flew off as he fell to the\n&gt; &gt;ground, his Spark Failing him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    The Crowd ran around wild with the resent assination.  MadMoo got up\n&gt; &gt;from\n&gt; &gt;his place in the catwalks and ran for the exit.  When he open the Exit\n&gt; &gt;door,\n&gt; &gt;he noticed about 5 Cop Cars just pulling up outside.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;That Son of a Rust Picket set me up.&quot;  MadMoo said to himself as he\n&gt; &gt;ran\n&gt; &gt;in he other direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    He open an other door seeing police coming up a staircase.  The lead\n&gt; &gt;police Officer told him not to move.  MadMoo took out a smoke Gernade and\n&gt; &gt;threw it at the officers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;Get Down, its a Gernade.&quot;  The lead police officer yelled as his\n&gt; &gt;sqradon\n&gt; &gt;ducked down covering their heads.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    MadMoo closed the door.  He found a Metal Rod and slamed it in the \n&gt;door\n&gt; &gt;handle, making it impossile to open.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    MadMoo looked around where he was and noticed he was in a storage \n&gt;area.\n&gt; &gt;He grabbed a rope, blanket, and a Computer Printer.  He tied the Rope\n&gt; &gt;around\n&gt; &gt;the Computer Printer.  With the blanket he folded it up and put it in one\n&gt; &gt;of\n&gt; &gt;his storage pit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;Hmm, If I hold the Gernade for 2.3562 secounds then throw it the \n&gt;hole\n&gt; &gt;should be big enough.&quot;  MadMoo says as he takes out a gernade.  He pulls\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt;pin.  Excatly 2.3562 seconds after he pulled the pin, he threw it at the\n&gt; &gt;roof.  Right as the very tip of the gernade hit the roof, it went off.\n&gt; &gt;There was a 11 foot hole(In Radius) in the metalic roof.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    MadMoo took the Printer and threw it up at the hole.  It landed on \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt;roof.  MadMoo then grabbed the rope and climb up it.  Somehow the printer\n&gt; &gt;held and he made it to the roof.  He then ran to the edge and jumped.  He\n&gt; &gt;quickly wiped out the blanket and used it as a Parachute.  He made it\n&gt; &gt;Saftley on the ground.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;OOC:Sorry for not finishing this, I gtg.
