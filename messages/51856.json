So who are these Predacons you work for? And when can \nI see \n&gt; Megatron, I haven&#39;t talked to him in quite sometime.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: This may be confusing being that you have a different \nMegatron. But \n&gt; Tyrant has been in stasis for a super long time so he basically \nsleeped \n&gt; through the whole Beast Wars ordeal. And he got sucked through a \nblackhole \n&gt; and got spit oput into this timeperiod and landed here on earth. \nSo he doesnt \n&gt; know about Megatron 2 or that he went back intime so he will be \nquite \n&gt; confused at all of this.\n\n\n"}}
