He starts by contacting K=\r\nup and his team.\n\n&quot; Tucson to Kup, over.  The enemy seems to be gaining gro=\r\nund but it could be some time before they reach us.  That could give you an=\r\nd your team time to mobilize and divise a strategy that best fits your need=\r\ns.  I&#39;m fully confident in your abilities to assemble a plan, and any imput=\r\n you can give us is valuable.  But be careful, they could sneak up on us at=\r\n any time.&quot;\n\nNight Shift now helps Talon, by sticking close to her, as he t=\r\noo fires rounds but keeps a shield over Talon and himself.\n\n&quot; I got your ba=\r\nck Talon, ain&#39;t gonna let no preds or cons take any pop shots at any of us!=\r\n&quot;\n\nTucson now contacts Rat Trap and Windlord.\n\n&quot; Tucson to Rat Trap and Win=\r\ndlord, over.  What&#39;s your position?&quot;\n\nRat Trap responds.\n\n&quot;Umm, we didn&#39;t e=\r\nxactly get inta the fortress Wheels... We&#39;re tryn&#39; but the only hole we cou=\r\nld find was a crevace in the wall.&quot;\n\nTucson responds.\n\n&quot; As long as you&#39;re =\r\nboth safe, that&#39;s all that counts.&quot;\n\nRat Trap sighs.\n\n&quot;Ain&#39;t good enough Wh=\r\neels, I want this ta work, not fail.  The only way ta get in is ta blast th=\r\nis wall, but that&#39;ll start a riot for sure, and we don&#39;t wanna do that.&quot;\n\nT=\r\nucson thinks for a moment.\n\n&quot;Hmmm...  You&#39;re right about the shots, we woul=\r\ndn&#39;t want to do that...  But a chemical agent, similar to acid, may be able=\r\n to burn a way into that wall, without making any noise or disruptive movem=\r\nent..&quot;\n\nRat Trap raises an optic.\n\n&quot;Ohhh yeahhhh, an acidic compound... Lik=\r\ne the stuff in batteries..  Lemme see what I got under my fur, I know I kep=\r\nt some goodies under here....&quot;\n\nHe digs into his fur, and grins.\n\n&quot;Bingo.. =\r\n I found this while scrounging one day...  An old battery cell I picked up =\r\nsomewhere..  All we gotta do is open this up, get to the acidic chamber, an=\r\nd see if that eats through the wall.

The skies are\n&gt; fai=\r\nrly lit with smoke, fire and bright lights as the Maximals and\n&gt; Autobots a=\r\nttempt to defend themselves and their position. EMP rounds,\n&gt; while missing=\r\n their intended targets still disrupt the sweeps\n&gt; targeting locks for a mo=\r\nment a send their radar systems into temporary\n&gt; shut down. This allows Tal=\r\non&#39;s weapons fire to find a home, brining\n&gt; down yet another sweep, leaving=\r\n two of them in the air overhead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Tuscon is able to get an a=\r\nssessment of the situation as\n&gt; there are currently no combatants on the gr=\r\nound. The sweeps are down\n&gt; to two now, well under half the number they sta=\r\nrted out with. However\n&gt; he can see in the distance there are more sweeps r=\r\nising from an open\n&gt; door at the tower, and there are others as well. He st=\r\nill can get a\n&gt; bead on the sweeps, but the others rising up he had met bef=\r\nore =96 the\n&gt; soldiers Cyclonus had brought the tower when Tuscon was tryin=\r\ng to\n&gt; fight his way out. However as the tower is still many kilometers awa=\r\ny\n&gt; it will take a little bit of time for them to reach his position.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n***************************************************************************=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile at the tower itself Rat Trap and Windlord are unable to fin=\r\nd\n&gt; a true &#39;hole&#39; in the tower itself. There does not appear to be any\n&gt; op=\r\nen vents or handy cracks that lead thier way in. All the vents are\n&gt; curren=\r\ntly closed, firmly and securely, and they would need to be,\n&gt; after all thi=\r\ns is a tower designed to descend into liquid rock.\n&gt; However they are able =\r\nto find a spot where the walls on the upper\n&gt; tower jut out slightly, a sma=\r\nll crevass. However it is very small, and\n&gt; it in no way leads into the tow=\r\ner itself, but it is merely a small\n&gt; cubby hole type structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; The o=\r\nnly way discernable into the tower itself, short of blowing a\n&gt; hole in the=\r\n wall, and judgingh by the material of the wall this would\n&gt; take a lot of =\r\nfirepower, the only way in is the large door that the\n&gt; soldiers had just l=\r\neft from - the door that is even now continuing to\n&gt; close.\n&gt; \n&gt; **********=\r\n*****************************************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; At t=\r\nhe Ark there is no answer to Quickstride&#39;s challenge.
