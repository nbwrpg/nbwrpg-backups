Why should I not just\n&gt; kill you now and \n&gt; be done with it?&quot; He finishes figuring that Flicker\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t know \n&gt; that they Preds had finished setting up their\n&gt; defenses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Off comm, &quot;Goood Perceptor, that means we now have\n&gt; two missile \n&gt; turrets, two laser cannons, and 4 auto guns.\n&gt; Sufficient firepower \n&gt; for the moment.&quot; He turns to Quickstrike as the\n&gt; cobra-scorpion fuzor \n&gt; enters the control room.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickstrike. Notify the rest of the Predacons that\n&gt; they are to \n&gt; report to the control room. We will attack the\n&gt; Maximals soon \n&gt; enough.&quot; Megatron goes back to his scan, which has\n&gt; just finished. He \n&gt; examines the offensive/defensive capabilites that\n&gt; the scanners were \n&gt; able to detect. (your queue Kyle, I dunno how much\n&gt; horsepower the \n&gt; car that Flicker is driving has ^^)\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; The flickering pulse of a laser welder casts an erie\n&gt; glow around \n&gt; Switchblade&#39;s lab. The small black bot hadn&#39;t been\n&gt; out of the CR \n&gt; chamber long, but he had immediately noticed that\n&gt; further repairs \n&gt; were needed, since some of his parts were destroyed\n&gt; when Megatron... \n&gt; &lt;No...&gt; he thinks to himself as he finishes up the\n&gt; addition of some \n&gt; new parts to replace the old ones. Megatron was a\n&gt; problem which he \n&gt; couldn&#39;t deal with at the moment, so he refused to\n&gt; dwell on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clenching and unclenching his hand, he tested out\n&gt; some of the new \n&gt; joints, nodding to himself as they performed\n&gt; admirably as his \n&gt; request. The right side of his head no longer\n&gt; resembled the rest of \n&gt; his head, a smooth silvery surface now covered the\n&gt; right side of his \n&gt; head and flared out slightly behind his head almost\n&gt; like a crude \n&gt; drawing of a birds wing feathers. His right eye was\n&gt; now surrounded \n&gt; by the silvery material, and it had a dark,\n&gt; enveloping, reddish glow \n&gt; instead of it&#39;s original greenish glow, which his\n&gt; left eye still \n&gt; had. \n&gt; \n&gt; His vision shifted into a red blur as he tested out\n&gt; the new eye. \n&gt; It&#39;s infrared capabilities were excellent, and he\n&gt; wondered if he had \n&gt; the capability of shortening the wavelength even\n&gt; more. Shrugging \n&gt; carelessly, he moves onto the next part switch. His\n&gt; chest plating \n&gt; had been entirely destroyed in the blast, as well as\n&gt; his minor \n&gt; cloaking ability. Intead of trying to make another\n&gt; cloaking device --\n&gt;  which he didn&#39;t think he had the parts for anyway\n&gt; -- he had modifed \n&gt; a little thing he was working on. Something he\n&gt; called a Distort \n&gt; shield. Working in conjunction with two disks on his\n&gt; arms, it \n&gt; created a sort of protection field around him. THe\n&gt; only probem he \n&gt; could see with it was that even if it could block an\n&gt; attack, who&#39;s \n&gt; to say that the attack wouldn&#39;t have enough force to\n&gt; knock him \n&gt; around anyway. He hoped he didn&#39;t have to test it\n&gt; out in battle \n&gt; anytime soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade looked around his lab, and his eyes fell\n&gt; onto his \n&gt; pistols, which he put back into this hip ejectors,\n&gt; and then he sat \n&gt; down, waiting for a summons from Megatron, who would\n&gt; probably \n&gt; realize that the small bot would have gotten out of\n&gt; the CR by now.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Flicker sends another transmission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Flicker:  I repeat we request permission to land.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
