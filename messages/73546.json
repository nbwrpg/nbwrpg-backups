But one thing didn&#39;t change, I was st=\r\nill battling blindness off and on. Then, a third change, due to extensive d=\r\namage to my previous form, which could not be repaired, I was guided to my =\r\nfinal evolution, this one. All of these things wouldn&#39;t have come about if =\r\nI had never met you. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Talon, I will mi=\r\nss this planet as much as you are, and hopefully we can tell our offspring =\r\nall about this planet and it&#39;s wondrous varieties of life that live here.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rodent climbs down=\r\n and drops a nut into his hand, and chatters to him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; This is for us to keep?
