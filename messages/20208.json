He left the ship&#39;s auto-guns \nand shields on. He headed out in beast mode, and traveled to the \nlocation of the base. He still kept a careful eye out, since to him \nno day would be safe alone, and being Predacon. A battle could always \nstart. \n\nPast the distance, he came across a downed ship. It had to be the \nbase Black Arachnia had told him. He transformed to robot mode and \nlooked around. He watched for the auto-guns. They better know he was \ncoming.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
