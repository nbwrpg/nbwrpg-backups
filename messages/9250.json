It walks \nalmost silently through the trees and bushes.  It smells a wolf near \nby.\n\nIt&#39;s hunger knows no bounds and it is very hungery.  It follows the \nscent trail and passes an old pod.  It reaches up with it&#39;s paws and \nholds it&#39;s head up to look inside the pod.  It sniffs around and \nsmells the scent of decay and old metal.  It nudges some remains of a \nbot with it&#39;s paw.  The torso of the bot crumbles and falls apart.\nThe Tiger jumps back and growls.  It hits the pod with it&#39;s enormous \npaws and shakes the pod.  It roars and backs up a few paces.  It runs \nand rams into the pod, turning the pod over and dumping the remains \nof the bot on the ground.  The tiger walks around the pod and sees \nthe remains on the ground.  It walks over and starts to knaw on the \nremains.  \n\nWhen finished, the tiger sniffs the air and finds the scent of the \nwolf again. The tiger walks away from the pod and follows the trail \nof the wolf.\n\n(OK Lunarpine, you now have something following you. Watch out)\n\n\n"}}
