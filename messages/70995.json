He&#39;s going to now stand back=\r\n and let the fuzors begin their work. But he&#39;s also going to give the impre=\r\nssion of complete surrender at the same time. \n\n  Meanwhile, Uproar and Qui=\r\nckstride are completely at a loss as to how to fix things at the Ark. And n=\r\now, they&#39;re going to look up to Rodimus to do the right thing. Both of them=\r\n are rookie Maximals, so do expect some comic relief from those two. Uproar=\r\ns biggest weakness is his perpetual curiosity which is harmless enough but =\r\noften gets him into sticky situations. Quickstride&#39;s weakness is often his =\r\nscatterbrained nature, which also provides a little comic relief. If Rodimu=\r\ns can put these two guys on the right track, then he shouldn&#39;t have any rea=\r\nsons to doubt himself as a leader.\n\n  Hope this helps. BTW, Tucson is willi=\r\nng to meet with Legacy, on neutral grounds, but feels it&#39;s best that Legacy=\r\n does leave the Ark for saftey purposes. Remember, he does have that weakne=\r\nss for losing his temper, and he may have made it sound rather harsh, when =\r\nhe informed Legacy that he was to vacate the Ark. But in doing so, he could=\r\n privately meet with the bot to try and get an idea as to what page he&#39;s ac=\r\ntually on, and why he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing. And if he has indeed turned =\r\nevil. Tucson is extremely confused as to why Legacy would intentionally har=\r\nm his comrades, and he&#39;s hiding confusion behind his anger. But he will not=\r\n make any violent actions against him, he just wants honest answers. \n\n  Ok=\r\nay, that&#39;s definitely it for now.

At the same time much of the\n  &gt; Predacon army is standing there,=\r\n either in front of them, or flying over\n  &gt; head. I had posted that the pr=\r\neds were picking up those discarded weapons\n  &gt; while other were watching.\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; However in message #70988 Tuscon is able to pick up a weapon, aim =\r\nit at\n  &gt; someone, then with the help of the other Maximals choose not to f=\r\nire, they\n  &gt; are able to talk back and forth a few times, salute each othe=\r\nr and then\n  &gt; Tuscon drives off with no one stopping him.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; How do =\r\nwe reconcile all of that?

He was about to\n  &gt; &gt; say\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsomething when Uproar ran towards the Ark to be let in . . .\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed li=\r\nke a round bolt of\n  &gt; &gt; lightening\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared, sending Uproar flying=\r\n several yards through the air, to land\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; heavily on the ground! Evid=\r\nently the Ark shielding was still in place,\n  &gt; &gt; and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; it was not al=\r\nlowing anyone in.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here! =\r\nIf we are going to get back in,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; then we need to work together. That=\r\n shield is supposed to hold off all\n  &gt; &gt; the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacon forces. We a=\r\nre not going to get in by brute force.&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; As Rodimus talked t=\r\nhree other Maximals seemed to almost materialize out\n  &gt; &gt; of\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; the u=\r\nnderbrush, such was their skills at camouflage.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; The first w=\r\nas Wing Caliber, (See: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an\n  &gt; &gt; old\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Maximal stratagist and military teacher, who from the brownish feathers\n =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; along his frame turned into some sort of eagle.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nnext was Leo II, (\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Lioconv=\r\noy_gathering.jpg ) the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked mu=\r\nch like him, and who had\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously picked up many of his mannerisms=\r\n. His body was powerfully built\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; and heavily armored. He looked to t=\r\nurn into a lion.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; The third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/w=\r\niki/Ramulus) who had like the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; others been on patrol for a while, su=\r\nrveying the area and trying to keep\n  &gt; &gt; it\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; free from Predacon inv=\r\nasion.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo II, obviously =\r\nthe leader of the\n  &gt; &gt; other\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of sight,\n  &gt;=\r\n &gt; and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; then we can discuss it.&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; *Meanwhile Inside t=\r\nhe Ark:*\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor had received Tuscon&#39;s message and sent a=\r\nttempted to send a\n  &gt; &gt; message\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; to Lord elder, however at the mome=\r\nnt there was no answer from the elder\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; At t=\r\nhe same time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with the\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; others, his single optic glowing in the darkness.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It wou=\r\nld seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems are being held at minimal\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nevels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his gaze to the wall panel nearest\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Nightlight. A small light blinked, indicating her spark was still online=\r\n,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; but that there was not enough power to reboot her systems.\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness=\r\n, lit by\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He =\r\nraised his\n  &gt; &gt; right\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon=\r\n on it and begin to emit\n  &gt; &gt; light\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; from it, much like a flash lig=\r\nht or a beacon so that the room was\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated. He casually looked=\r\n around, &quot;Perhaps we could locate a back\n  &gt; &gt; out\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; or reserve power=\r\n system . . . &quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s message came in. =\r\nHe turned to look at Santon,\n  &gt; &gt; Bump\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; and Perceptor, a look of di=\r\nsbelief momentarily flashing across his face.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy straig=\r\nhtened as his cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will\n  &gt; &gt; not\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; comply with your command. I have been tasked with . . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt; . .=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; . the protection of the Ark as well as that of the Matrix. I will =\r\nnot\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; knowingly leave the Ark undefended or the Matrix in the hands o=\r\nf\n  &gt; &gt; another.&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy turned to look at his console as h=\r\ne understoodf what happened.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Communications had been cut part way t=\r\nhrough his message. He turned to\n  &gt; &gt; look\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; at the others, his sing=\r\nle optic cold, &quot;It is illogical to believe that I\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; would attempt to =\r\nharm the Ark or allow anyone to take it from the\n  &gt;

Tucson hasn&#39;t \n  moved, he&#39;s signa=\r\nlled Noctorro to move in slowly, and in phases. He&#39;s going to \n  now stand =\r\nback and let the fuzors begin their work. But he&#39;s also going to \n  give th=\r\ne impression of complete surrender at the same time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, \n  =\r\nUproar and Quickstride are completely at a loss as to how to fix things at =\r\nthe \n  Ark. And now, they&#39;re going to look up to Rodimus to do the right th=\r\ning. Both \n  of them are rookie Maximals, so do expect some comic relief fr=\r\nom those two. \n  Uproars biggest weakness is his perpetual curiosity which =\r\nis harmless enough \n  but often gets him into sticky situations. Quickstrid=\r\ne&#39;s weakness is often his \n  scatterbrained nature, which also provides a l=\r\nittle comic relief. If Rodimus \n  can put these two guys on the right track=\r\n, then he shouldn&#39;t have any reasons \n  to doubt himself as a leader.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Hope this helps. BTW, Tucson is willing \n  to meet with Legacy, on neutra=\r\nl grounds, but feels it&#39;s best that Legacy does \n  leave the Ark for saftey=\r\n purposes. Remember, he does have that weakness for \n  losing his temper, a=\r\nnd he may have made it sound rather harsh, when he \n  informed Legacy that =\r\nhe was to vacate the Ark. But in doing so, he could \n  privately meet with =\r\nthe bot to try and get an idea as to what page he&#39;s \n  actually on, and why=\r\n he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing. And if he has indeed turned \n  evil. Tucson is=\r\n extremely confused as to why Legacy would intentionally harm \n  his comrad=\r\nes, and he&#39;s hiding confusion behind his anger. But he will not make \n  any=\r\n violent actions against him, he just wants honest answers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Okay, \n=\r\n  that&#39;s definitely it for now.

You start your post w=\r\nith Tuscon in the middle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of a very \n  tense stand off with him bein=\r\ng defensless and you end it with him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  being on the way to the Ark=\r\n. Basically you made no allowance for \n  someone,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; presumably Hydras=\r\n, to stop Tuscon from leaving - which is \n  what most evil bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guys=\r\n would do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In message #70973 \n  the demand was that the Ma=\r\nximals and Autobots lay down&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thier weapons \n  if they wanted Nightl=\r\night to live.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In message #70975 Tuscon \n  gives the order =\r\nfor all the Maximals and such to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; comply. And in that \n  post you wr=\r\nite that Night Shift subspaces his weapon, as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Straight Shot \n  tran=\r\nsforms into her robot mode, disarming her own weaponry as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  well.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In message #70978 Tuscon lays down his weapon and in \n  Me=\r\nssage #70987 Kup and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Talon do the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This would=\r\n \n  mean that all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are now&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  weaponless, and so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much of \n =\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Predacon army is standing there, either in front of them, or \n=\r\n  flying over&lt;BR&gt;&gt; head. I had posted that the preds were picking up tho=\r\nse \n  discarded weapons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; while other were watching.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n However \n  in message #70988 Tuscon is able to pick up a weapon, aim it at=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  someone, then with the help of the other Maximals choose not to=\r\n fire, \n  they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are able to talk back and forth a few times, salute =\r\neach other \n  and then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tuscon drives off with no one stopping him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  How do we reconcile all of that? Since you already had =\r\nTuscon sending&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  messages out and your characters already respondi=\r\nng, if we had someone \n  stop&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you in the middle of all of that, it =\r\nwould make it confusing as \n  to what&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happened and what didn&#39;t.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tuscon should not \n  have been able to point a weapon, talk, =\r\ntransform and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; drive away with \n  no response. Does that make sense?=\r\n Anything we post in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; middle of \n  that would only confuse thing=\r\ns worse.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We might need some \n  editing. Like Tuscon just d=\r\noes the first part of that,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not leave \n  yet. Allow the rest of=\r\n us to post a response first, then if it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is \n  reasonable based on =\r\nthe responses he leaves?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Again, not \n  trying to to be cri=\r\ntical, but keeping it fair.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&gt; On Sat, =\r\nJan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; \n  wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; OOC: I did an edit but \n  I guess I&#39;l=\r\nl add Uproar back in.

Rodimus \n  sho=\r\nuld be on his way, and I&#39;m&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sure he&#39;s gonna bring help. Go on, =\r\n\n  you got an Ark ta save.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He salutes Tucson.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson looks back to his adversaries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &quot; Even though I&#39;d like nothing better than to vanquish y=\r\nour evil hold \n  on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this planet, I&#39;ve come to realize that a f=\r\nar more critical \n  situation has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just arrisen. I am not givin=\r\ng up in cowardice, and \n  this is NOT the last you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will see or=\r\n hear of me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He transforms into his truck mod=\r\ne, and then pivots his many \n  wheels, puts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himself in reverse=\r\n to make a swing around, as back \n  up signals sound, to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; safel=\r\ny bring his trailer around without \n  touching anyone or anything. Then a&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; hiss of his hydraulics and he \n  rolls away toward the Ark.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, the situation \n  at the Ark has escalated.=\r\n I am heading back to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ensure the saftey \n  of our comrades, an=\r\nd to personally oust Legacy myself. And&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as for \n  your assista=\r\nnce, I thank you profusely for your efforts. By the way,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; th=\r\nis is the part where you take my place and win the war.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With that transmitted, Tucson accerates as he kicks up dirt \n  u=\r\nnder his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; enormous tires. Now thinking about Legacy, was turnin=\r\ng \n  on the short fuse&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; once again. He sends another message.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;You leave me no choice Legacy. No choice but t=\r\no oust you \n  myself. Keep in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind that you have but a limited=\r\n time to change \n  your mind and comply with my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; demands! And i=\r\nf anyone is harmed in \n  the mean time, I WILL GIVE TO YOU WHICH&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; YOU GIVE TO \n  THEM!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside, with Quickstrid=\r\ne and Rodimus, Uproar \n  trots over to them, and lies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; down in =\r\nthe grasses.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;m sorry, I lost it for a minu=\r\nte there..

I hate that I&#39;m able ta \n  do this. My ears just caught a&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; transmission from Tucson Prime. \n  He&#39;s heading back, and judging by=\r\n the tone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of his voice, he&#39;s in \n  a beast of a mood. Said som=\r\neth&#39;n about ousting Legacy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the hard \n  way. I hate ta see what=\r\n that entails..&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Uproar grins \n  kiddingly.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;And I thought my temper was nasty. \n  Sounds like he&#39;=\r\ns got a shorter fuse&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than I do.

While Rodimus didn&#39;t \n  know that much&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Legacy, having only seen \n  him briefly while being rescued and repaire=\r\nd,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; there&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; was nothing to hint that this at=\r\ntack was Legacy&#39;s doing. He was about \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; something when Uproar ran towards the \n  Ark to be let in . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;KRACK \n  POW&lt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, \n  what seemed like a round bolt =\r\nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lightening&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  appeared, sending Uproar fl=\r\nying several yards through the air, to land&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; heavily on=\r\n the ground! Evidently the Ark shielding was still in \n  place,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it was not allowing anyone \n  in.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get over \n  here! If we are go=\r\ning to get back in,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then we need to work \n  together. Tha=\r\nt shield is supposed to hold off all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; =\r\nPredacon forces.

A small light blinked, indicating her \n  spark was still online,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but that there was not enough power \n  to reboot her syst=\r\nems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He turned to look \n  at the others=\r\n, his face glowing in the darkness, lit by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his \n  own opt=\r\nic, and the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  r=\r\night&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it a=\r\nnd \n  begin to emit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; light&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from it, much like=\r\n a flash \n  light or a beacon so that the room was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; illumi=\r\nnated. He \n  casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locate a back&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; \n  out&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or reserve power system . . . &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s message came in.
