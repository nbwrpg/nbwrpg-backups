Maybe we can rig a repulser \nfield to push it out there.  I&#39;m sure we can reconfigure the main \ntractor emitter to suit our purposes.&quot;\n&gt; Malice took the generator and check the hole in the sphere for \nsize.  It would fit, so he fit it inside and plugged it up with the \ncross section he cut.  He used the sword to seal the hole and the \nsphere itself was ready.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m tired.  I use a bunch of energy cutting on this thing.&quot;\n&gt; He let a yawn escape, and rested his weight against the sphere.\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC- You&#39;re back!  Yeah!  Remember, beat up your boss!  He can&#39;t do \nthat to you!  \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She watched Malice work on the sphere. She was impressed by his \nsheer \n&gt; strength, but kept working. She put the finishing touches on the \n&gt; machine and sighed. &quot;It&#39;s done. Now, once we get this inside the \nyour \n&gt; big ball there, how are we going to get it outside the planet&#39;s \n&gt; atmosphere without the whole thing melting, buring up, or just \n&gt; returning to earth?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; While Wolfblade made the final adjustments to the generator, \nMalice \n&gt; was about to &#39;adjust&#39; the sphere.  They needed the generator inside \n&gt; the basalt sphere, so the easiest way would be to cut it open and \n&gt; install.  Malice drew his sword.  It looked like a hammered out \n&gt; backbone.  It was more of a saw than a sword.  It also had cables \n&gt; running the length from the tip to the hilt.  When the bottom half \nof \n&gt; the handle was unscrewed and slid inside the other half, it created \na \n&gt; whip like saw weapon.  Malice could also channel energy into it, \n&gt; making it more or less leathal.  In this application, Malice poured \n&gt; so of his stored energy into it, making it like a torch.  He \nplunged \n&gt; the blade into the sphere and in a circular motioin, cut a cross \n&gt; section wide enough to slide the generator inside.  He pulled the \n&gt; section out and drew out the heat so he could set it down.  All \nthat \n&gt; was left was installing the generator and figure out where they \nwere \n&gt; going to launch it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:WOlfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She was glad to be back in the lab. Malice was obviously \n&gt; &gt; uncomfortable around her as his body language showed very well. \nHer \n&gt; &gt; systems were re-setting themselves, but it seemed to taking an \n&gt; &gt; eternity for her.  She glanced up at Malice and felt her belly \nturn \n&gt; &gt; upside down.  She picked up a small set of tools and started to \n&gt; &gt; finish the small touches on thier project. &quot;Uh, by the way, erhm, \n&gt; &gt; well, thanks for your help. Back there....I mean.&quot;  She tried to \n&gt; hide \n&gt; &gt; her face behind the large sphere on the work bench. She wasn&#39;t \nsure \n&gt; &gt; why some of her circuits were acting as funny as they were. Or \nwny \n&gt; &gt; some of her lanugage skills went haywire a little while ago. She \n&gt; told \n&gt; &gt; herself she would put herself in a CR chamber when this was done \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; run a complete diognostic on herself. However, she had to admit, \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt; to herself, she thought she was feeling something when she \nthought, \n&gt; &gt; saw or looked at Malice. She looked and found herself staring at \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; sphere as she had gotten lost in thought, She shook her head and \n&gt; &gt; returned to work. &quot;Hope this works.
