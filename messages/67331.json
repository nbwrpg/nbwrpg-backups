Sorry about all the details\nnot be=\r\ning covered. Basically, I wanted to reintroduce an old character\nand have a=\r\n go at the Minions. Preston, to help you out, Vorpal was\ndeliberately not f=\r\nleshed out. He&#39;s a military Genius and a tyrant, but\nlittle else is known. =\r\nThat&#39;s what makes him scary.\n\nBIC:\n\nThe raider was almost on the brink of b=\r\nreaking the atmosphere. Time to\nget protected. He started transforming, tho=\r\nusands of small pieces\nmoving into place as he rearranged his structure to =\r\nthat of a comet\njust like the one he had ridden. The airless atmosphere of =\r\nthe Moon\nwas not much, but it was still dangerous without protection. He bu=\r\nrned\nhis way downwards.\n\nOnce the burning stopped, it all went very fast. H=\r\ne crashed landed and\ncreated a crater in doing do.\n\nSlowly after, he unfold=\r\ned and looked around. He finished transforming\nand made his weapon systems =\r\nwere operational at full power.\n\n???: MINIONS! I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU DEA=\r\nTH! I AM THE REAPER THAT\nWILL REMOVE YOUR STAIN ON THE UNIVERSE! FEAR ME, F=\r\nOR I AM AZUREBLADE!\n\nThere. The challenge was issued. He readied his pulse =\r\ncannon, his\nmissile launcher and his sword.

(=\r\nif he gave you his permisison then no problem). The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base=\r\n is a rumor and a mystery so far. No action has taken place\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there. I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it would be better if you let Nic introduce it since he\ncreated=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, anyone can create minions, you don&#39;t necessari=\r\nly have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exclusive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the minions, and it wouldn&#39;t be =\r\na problem for Nic to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously play minions and someone attackin=\r\ng minions. Those are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In message 67223=\r\n Nic said &#39;Vorpal is a major NPC. I have no trouble\n&gt; &gt; about someone else\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; controlling him.&#39; So I am taking just taking temporary control. If Nic\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; wants him then he is his to take at his leasure.
