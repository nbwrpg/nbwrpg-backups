I just got an emergency distress beacon f=\r\nrom Night Shift, he&#39;s in trouble, and it looks like he needs my help!  Talo=\r\nn, Nightshift needs me, I&#39;m sorry, but I have to again.  I love you too muc=\r\nh to lose you to Hydras and the others.  Stay safe with Lord Perseus, I&#39;ll =\r\nbe back here as soon as I get Night Shift out of danger.
