The predacons and the \nnewcomers are jointly attacking the Ark. If the maximals fall, there is \nnothing to prevent Hell Beast to turn on us. So...&quot;\n\nHe turns to look at the scanners once again, a plan forming in his mind as he \nsees that Iron Raptor and Tavatron had left the Ark.\n\n&quot;Nemesis Enforcer, Scattershot, Delta, DevilDuer, Zergling, Oinker, you will \ngo to the Ark, attacking the attackers from behind.&quot;\n\nHe turns to the Oblitercons. &quot;If you will participate in this battle, I will \nadd a bonus of 100 kilograms of energon to your payment. If so, also go \nattack the Ark.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Reptilica and Bloodystrike. &quot;You two and Perndabot will \naccompany me to intercept Iron Raptor and her friend. They will come in \nusefull in future dealings with the maximals. As soon as we have secured \nthose two, me and Perndabot will join the battle at the Ark, Reptilica and \nBloodystrike will stay here and defend the base in case of an attack.&quot;\n\nHe looks around the room. &quot;Any questions?&quot;\n\n"}}
