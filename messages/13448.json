She \nturns away from the computer.\n    &quot;Ah good. Glad you could make it. Quickstrike, we need your computer \nskills to get the main power generator up and running. Meantime DarkMouse and \nI will take a look around the bunker a little more. Tarantulas,&quot; She paused \nan looked at him in puzzlement for a moment, &quot;You can start reading the \ncommander, or whatever was in charge here, journal entry&#39;s. Got it?&quot;\n    Tarantulas transformed and nodded. He walked over to one of the terminals \nand began to read. Aracnia took Dark Mouses shoulder and began to lead her \nback out the door into the dark hallway to investigate.\n\n    Megatron was indeed tired. Waspinators infernal humming was the only \nthing keeping him awake. He was mostly watching radar and filling out the \ndaily report.\n    &quot;Megatron made cat bot commander! Why not Waspinator?&quot; He said suddenly, \nwith out any hesitation.\n    Megatron turned a heavey optic to him. &quot;Your stupid, and an idiot. Kitkat \nis smart a reliable. Answer your question?&quot;\n\n"}}
