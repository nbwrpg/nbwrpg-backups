Fangs that inject venom. Venom will send\n&gt; most average BW bot into stasis, but not kill.\n&gt; Alliegance: Predacon\n&gt;\n&gt; She was made on Cybertron, by the Predacon Council.  She was designed\n&gt; to be a spy and assassin.  Her moto, SEEK,SEDUCE,DESTROY.  She had\n&gt; killed many Maximal officails on Cybertron and was working her way\n&gt; around to the top leaders.  She was the best in her field.  The\n&gt; Predacon Council had made other bots for the same purpose as she, but\n&gt; she had out done them all.  But because of her skill, a few of the\n&gt; Predacon leaders felt she might become a threat to them.  She knew\n&gt; too much and they now wanted rid of her.  She had just killed one of\n&gt; the Maximal Council leaders and was then turned in by one of the\n&gt; Predacon Council members.  She had to flee Cybertron or be exacuted.\n&gt; But her programs of killing and information gathering were still\n&gt; strong and for the Predacon cause despire the fact they betrayed her.\n&gt; She stole a small transport ship and sped off from Cybertron.  She\n&gt; didn&#39;t know if she would ever return, but for now, the further away\n&gt; she got, the safer she felt.\n&gt;\n&gt; She was deep into space, when a black hole opened up infront of her\n&gt; ship.  Seconds later, her ship was sucked into the vortex of space.\n&gt; She tried to fight, but the ship couldn&#39;t break free.  She blacked\n&gt; out from the g-forces of the black hole as the ship was sucked in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her ship finally flew throught the hole in space and ended up near\n&gt; the solor system on Earth.  Her ship had lost power and engine drive\n&gt; while in the black hole.  The only systems that remained active were\n&gt; life support.  She was in stasis lock at the helm of the ship.  AS\n&gt; the ship drifted past the planets, it was hit by space debre and\n&gt; rubble.  Small meteors collided and smashed parts of the exterior\n&gt; drive system and parts of the navigational systems.  The ship\n&gt; evertually drifted near earth, where the gravitational pull had\n&gt; started to pull the ship into the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  The ship fell\n&gt; from the sky and landed  100 yards from the Allience base.  The\n&gt; transport ship was about the size of the NASA Space shuttle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Venomess was still out cold, her body slumped over the control\n&gt; console.  Her body bruised but for the most part, undamaged.  The\n&gt; ship had sustained a lot of damage and would never fly again. Smoke\n&gt; poured out of the tail and engine rooms.  The wings were torn off\n&gt; upon impact.  One wing flew off and hit against the Allience ship.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
