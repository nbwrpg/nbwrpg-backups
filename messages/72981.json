Something stops him from making a foolish mistake.\n&gt; Instead he transforms into robot mode and nods to his comrades.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Intuition just told me to take a different approach to this situation.\n&gt; Something that only Master Yoketron would do at a time like this.  I must\n&gt; remember my training, and why I was chosen to undergo such mentor ship .&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks to Leo and Big Convoy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, we still have a bit of a way to go by the sound of things, and\n&gt; I think a two phased strategy is better than a one shot deal.  Since I&#39;ve\n&gt; been blind for a long time, I can navigate in darkness rather quickly.  It&#39;s\n&gt; best you allow me to go ahead and map a way for you to allow easier access\n&gt; and cut down on time expansion.  Leo, Big Convoy, I would like the heavier\n&gt; Maximals to follow behind with you, and the Maximals who are swift and\n&gt; agility based to follow me.  You can chose whoever you deem fits either\n&gt; category.  This also holds true for the Predicons assisting in our efforts.\n&gt; We have a greater chance at success if we work strategically.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO PRIME looked over at BIG CONVOY.\n\n&quot;Yeah, they are all like this in the begining.&quot; CONVOY said. &quot;Young\nand full of confidence.&quot; There was a chuckle from CONVOY, &quot;As the\nhumans have said, ten foot tall and bullet proof.&quot;\n\nLooking back at TUSCON there was a nod from LEO PRIME, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; He\nsaid as the other MAXIMALS rallied up around them.\n\nAs they moved on the tunnel turned abruptly and showed them the\nreasoning for the flickering light as the tunnel ended at a ledge, a\nledge that was hundreds of feet from the floor of a vast cavern, the\ncieling of which was nearly fifty feet above the top of the tunnel\nthey had just emerged from. The cavern stretched out for perhaps a\nmile or more in diameter and was maybe two or three hundred feet from\nfloor to cieling.\n\nThe cieling itself had large stalactites reaching down perhaps 30 feet\nfrom the cieiling, while there are an equal number of stalagmites\nrising from the floor. There is even a sparse type of fungi-like\nvegatation down here, although it is different from anything seen on\nthe surface.\n\nIn the center of the chasm, about a mile away from the tunnel entrance\nthere was a large cylinder of yellow light fire rising from the floor\nof the cave and disapearing into a hole in the cieling. It\nsuperficially looked like fire it also had the look of some sort of\nenergy as sparks crackled and arced all around it.\n\nIt is this flickering light that was noticable from the tunnel as the\nlight itself bathed the cavern.\n\nAt the bottom of the the columb of fire was a large black pit and\nhanging suspended above it by blackened chains was a tiny figure in\nred . . . OPTIMUS PRIME who was being bathed in that very fire!\n\nAlthough it was difficult to see at nearly a mile distant, the tiny\nfigures of MAGMATRON and SABERBACK were standing watching. Around them\nwere arrayed SHARKTICONS and some others that from that distance\nappeared to be DINOBOTS or at least something akin to them.\n\nBut even at the distance there was a booming chuckle that sounded like\nit came from SABERBACK even though he was still merely a mile away!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
