For those\nwith enhanced senses=\r\n this place was teeming with all sorts of life\nfrom the large to the small.=\r\n However one thing would make itself\nabundantly clear to cybertronians almo=\r\nst immediately. All\ncommunications appeared to be out. All tracking beacons=\r\n, com-links and\nsignals had been cut off. For those inside the jungle there=\r\n was no\ncommunication at all with the outside, and to those outside the jun=\r\ngle\nit was as if TUSCON and WHEELIE had just disappeared.\n\nHowever, interes=\r\ntingly enough, the sensors of anyone with even a\nmodicum of detection gear =\r\nshould be able to pick up a low level &#39;hum&#39;\nof strange energy that suffused=\r\n the entire area. Not a force field but\njust an energy wave that was in the=\r\n background of things. To those who\nwere familiar with it, the =91hum=92 ha=\r\nd a Unicronian signature to it\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - WHEELIE&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not having a more exp=\r\nlicit idea fo what was going on, Wheelie gingerly\n&gt; continued, one step at =\r\na time, going slowly and warily.  Keeping his energon\n&gt; slingshot in a subs=\r\npace pocket but fully charged, so should it come over to\n&gt; combat he could =\r\nimmediately whip it out to engage someone, and keeping\n&gt; enough space betwe=\r\nen himself and the underbrush if he was ambushed he would\n&gt; have some room =\r\nto react.\n\n&lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n\nThe trek that WHEELIE is on has brought him out=\r\n into more open areas\nof the jungle. The canopy of trees has grown unusuall=\r\ny thick meaning\nthat the underbrush has died back, leaving the floor of the=\r\n jungle,\nwhile uneven, relatively clear of plant life. The area is dark, bu=\r\nt\nnot overly so, much like a day in the open as the sun was setting, or\nper=\r\nhaps behind dense storm clouds.\n\nThe silence around WHEELIE was becoming mo=\r\nre pronounced as he moved\nforward. He could see signs that larger animals h=\r\nad indeed moved\nthrough the area. The bark had been knocked off or actual d=\r\nents or\ncuts made in the trees themselves.\n\nTwin optics appeared glowing fr=\r\nom the shadows but strangely enough\nWHEELIE is unable to lock on it with an=\r\ny sort of sensors.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he nears a large tree, his outs=\r\ntretched arms allow him to catch a giant\n&gt; branch with both hands as he swi=\r\nngs off it like a skilled gymnast .  After a\n&gt; spin or two, to build his mo=\r\nmentum, he vaults to a lower branch and\n&gt; continues to do so until he final=\r\nly touches down for a flawless landing as\n&gt; he uses his arms for balance.  =\r\nLeaf litter falls in his wake as he first\n&gt; looks around to get his bearing=\r\ns.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON landed on the jungle floor high over head a flock of b=\r\nirds\nat the top of the canopy of trees rose into the air obviously startled=\r\n\nby his passing, the sound of their calls filling the air for a moment.\nHow=\r\never soon enough the birds flew off to find new places to roost and\nto find=\r\n food.\n\nThe ground that TUSCON has landed is still relatively open, but he =\r\ncan\neasily make out the path leading further into the jungle where the\ntree=\r\ns and undergrowth would make travel more difficult for anyone.\nLarge trees =\r\nsurround him on all sides. Many of them had been knocked\ndown by large anim=\r\nals of some sort, but the evidence of this\ndestruction became less and less=\r\n the further in he looked.\n\nEnhanced senses could easily make out the pleth=\r\nora of life that lived\nin the jungle as animals and birds of all shapes and=\r\n sizes made their\nhome in the miles and miles of this wooded area. However =\r\nhis enhanced\nsenses could also pick up the movement of something else, that=\r\n moved\nout in the brush ahead of him. However his sensors were unable to pi=\r\nck\nup on it. He could see a figure ahead that looked vaguely humanoid in\nth=\r\ne distance, although with the brush and foliage between him and them\nit was=\r\n difficult to distinguish size and configuration.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
