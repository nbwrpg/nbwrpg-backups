It was low, and sounded evil.  Much like the greatest Leader of the Decepticons.  He served up a large glass for himself, he had nothing to fear.  He designed the waveform to affect a tolerance of standard Maximal thermal regulators.  His entire body was custom componants, plus he was turned into Transmetal 2.

One of his most potent drinks flopped.  \nAs far as he knew, no Maximal or Predacon could handle the energy \nwaveform.  It was just not feasible.  Perhaps systems could be \nadjusted to tolerate just a little more, but this was ridicules.  He \ncould out drink any Seeker, Wrecker, Gestalt, Triplechanger, and even \nSupreme Commander.  This wasn&#39;t right.\n&gt; Then it hit him.\n&gt; &lt;She might be hiding the problems that stuff is causing her.  That \nexplains the optic color.  If so, then I&#39;ll catch her in the act.  \nHmp, she should be an actress on Broadway or something.&gt;\n&gt; As he dove into a series of spare part compartments and drew from \nthe liquors, he began to create a second energy format.  As he mixed \na new drink in a new glass, he secretly added extra energy and \nmanipulated it into this secondary waveform.  It did not affect the \ncolor, taste, smell, or texture, but it would cause a specific \nproblem.  This attempt, was aimed at her thermal regulator.  In her \ncurrent state, she would seek more than liquid refreshment.  Sure it \nwas a cruel joke, but at least it wasn&#39;t going to harm her.  She \ncould just run a diagnostic cycle on her systems and the problem \nwould cease to be.  With a big smirk, he served his worthy opponant \nthe new cocktail.\n&gt; &quot;See if this razes your regulators.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She took the glass and sniffed it. &quot;Hmm, smells delightful.&quot;  She \n&gt; downed it and grinned.

What she wasn&#39;t \n&gt; going to do was give him the satisfaction of knowing the that the \n&gt; drink overpowered some of her systems enough so that she couldn&#39;t \n&gt; stand up.
