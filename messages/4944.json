The ice on the cieling form little iceicles and the water in the cave \nis frozen solid. Megatron set his command center far back into the cave, in \none of its larger caverens. Ra and Waspinator monitor the computers, and \nMegatron finishes assembling his command chair, which he feels he possibly \ncould not lead and properly command, with out it. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Soon, very soon we wil be the victors in this war. As soon \nas the Maximal base is destroyed, we will sweep in and take command of the \nsituation, seeing as how Hell Beast was a coward and retreated.\n\n::: Waspinator ::: What about the Allience?\n\n::: Ra ::: Yes, they have been far to quiet recently.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Zardus is a wise leader. He wouldnt get mixed up in this \ndisput that has raged on for generations.\n\n::: Ra ::: Or he could be waiting to strike us all down. Once the Maximals \nare gone, that will leave the Predacons, Newcomers, and Allience at the top \nof the food chain. Now that the NEwcomers and Predacons are working \ntogether....they might come after us next.\n\n::: Megatron ::: Doubtful. Besides, they wouldnt kill us. They would force us \ninto there little peace treaty. As for the Allience, I find it very unclear \nwhat they in tend to do. One thing is for sure, once the Maximals are gone \nthey will need to reveal just what there intentions are. Are they with us? \nAre they agianst us? Or, are they going to let us go about our business \nuninterrupted, yes.\n\n::: Waspinator ::: Waspinator thinks things are going to be alot more \ninteresting around here.\n\n::: Megatron laughs ::: Oh yes. Im hoping on it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast looks to Gremlin and Jackle standing guard on the monitor. \nPheniox and Black Aracnia completely cleared out the lab, and the Stasis pod \nwas being taken apart peice by peice. :::\n\n::: Transanulas sat on computer duty ::: Hell Beast, it seems the Predacons \nare doing quite well in the battle.\n\n::: Hell Beast, in the command chair ::: And what of the other fractions?\n\n::: Transanulas ::: The Allience has sent a transmission saying they will \nhelp the Maximals. And Megatron and his group are quiet.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: I see. Well, if the Allience wants to get involved, they \nhave alot to get involved with. Zardus is a good leader who wouldnt jepordise \nhis group for a dispute like this unless he felt it was nessecery.\n\n::: Transanulas ::: So, we wont attack them?\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Not unless it is completely unavoid able, no. I respect \nZardus.\n\n::: Scourge, from behinde them drinking something, ::: Well, if I was in \ncommand, I think I would attack there base now.\n\n::: Hell Beasr frowned in disgust ::: Fool. That would cause this to be a...a \nWorld War. Every fraction fighting for dominence. It would be completely \nignorant.\n\n::: Scourge frowned and sipped his drink. :::\n\n"}}
