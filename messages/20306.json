Normally the wounds would have been healed soon as they opened. &quot;You\nare correct child, I will need a name to call you. Subject just seems to\nimproper when it involves a living um being.&quot; the word creature came to mind\nbut sounded almost insulting. &quot;I will call you &quot;Ice&quot; for now until a more\nsuitable name comes up.&quot;\n\nThe computer beeped signifying the door opening under a recognizable\nsignature. Veratis thought nothing of it. Lady Hawk, and Foxfingers should\nbe returning any time now. He hadn&#39;t heard from either one in a while and\nwas beginning to worry. He put his mind at ease by deciding that they must\nbe caught up in all the excitement of this amazing new world.\n\nA large figure entered the room and stayed to the Shadows. &quot;I leave for a\nfew days and this is what happens? Do I have to watch you every moment? Good\nto see you&#39;re up and about Wing.&quot; Lunarpine stepped forward in half wolf\nform carrying the sample of DNA from Shadow Wings grave sight. &quot;I guess you\nwon&#39;t need this after all.&quot;\n\n&quot;Veratis half smiled. The rejection to the bear DNA was causing the\ndegeneration, now that they had the right sample he might be able to\nstabilize her. &quot;I hate to say it but you&#39;ll need to spend a few more hours\nin the CR.&quot; he turns back to Lunarpine, &quot;And you, I give you a simple task\nand a new body and you turn it into a war. I&#39;ll see you both in a while.&quot;\nHe adjusted the intake valve on the chamber with the owl DNA knowing he\nwouldn&#39;t have to explain to &quot;Ice&quot;\n\nLunarpine stepped into another chamber looking one last time at Shadow Wings\nnew form. He wanted to throw his arms around her but figured it&#39;d hurt to\nmuch. A bear hug and his wounds would make him regret surviving. &quot;I&#39;ll see\nyou soon&quot; he said to both Veratis and Wing as the door closed.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 6:34 AM\nSubject: Re: New bot\n\n\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked at Veratis. She felt a twinge of pain as her other wing\n&gt; stated to fall off her right shoulder. She growled and reached over\n&gt; her shoulder and ripped it off.  The deep red fluid started to flow\n&gt; down her shoulder and down her side. Her white fur was turning\n&gt; crimson from the blood. She threw down her wings and looked at\n&gt; Veratis. &quot;So now I am a new life form.&quot; She growled. She wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; quite what to do or what to make of all this. She lowered herself\n&gt; down on all fours. Her shoulders were dripping with the red fluid.\n&gt; &quot;So now that I am this...new form. Give me a new name.  I am no\n&gt; longer the bot Shadow Wing.&quot;  She looked down. &quot;No...I am no longer\n&gt; the embodement of Shadow Wing. I am still who I am, but no longer\n&gt; what I was. Veratis, you made this change possable. I ask you...give\n&gt; me a name.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Sorry I missed yesterday, work had me busy.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veratis studied the results of the scans from the CR chamber. &quot;The\n&gt; virus\n&gt; &gt; seems to have mutated your DNA into a dominant organic form.&quot; you\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; something new to translife.&quot; He had a flare for the obvious. the\n&gt; life form\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;d been trying for so long to create was now a reality.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
