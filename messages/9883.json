He didn&#39;t want to \nchance transforming to wolf for fear he wouldn&#39;t have the energy to \nchange back if he had to fight. landmarks were beginning to look \nfamiliar so he knew he was headed in the right direction. He had a \nlong walk ahead of him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine&#39;s optics came back online first, he could see the setting \nsun and\n&gt; the rising moon, he could feel his systems slowly coming back \nonline, he\n&gt; could hear static in his ears and through his comm, his internal \nrepair\n&gt; system was working it&#39;s magic, slowly he was regaining power.\n&gt; \n&gt; He tried to pull himself to his feat, big mistake, his left arm \ncollapsed\n&gt; beneath him. pain receptors were deffinately online. He used his \nright arm\n&gt; to get back on his feat, it was only a matter of time before the \npred\n&gt; realized it was duped and returned. He had to move himself, at \nleast until\n&gt; repairs were complete to his comm. He started walking, he just \nhoped it was\n&gt; the right direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 02, 2000 4:43 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: my last post for tonight\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine awoke seated next to the stasis pod. he was week, but \nstill\n&gt; &gt; functioning. &quot;Computer report.&quot; There was no answer. his power \nlevels\n&gt; &gt; were so low that his internal computer had shut itself off.
