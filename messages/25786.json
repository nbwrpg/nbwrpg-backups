I forgot about the post with Icedragon! Sorry.\n\n* Iron Raptor suddenly looked towards Icedragon as he came up to her, her \nsystems listening carfully once he mantioned the maximal matrix.\nShe looked down at the device and lifted a brow. This was given to the best \nMaximals?\n&lt; Fat chance for that.&gt; she thought. There were better Maximals then her, \nshe was positive. But for some dumb reason she had been chosen for 3rd in \ncommand then then was stuck with the role of comamnder.\nShe didn&#39;t mind it, it had all just been so sudden. She was still trying to \nget use to it.\nBut then she heard of Icedragon&#39;s phrase about having to put it into her \nspark, looking right at her chest right away.\nShe had no chambers or anything in her body that she could just open up and \nstick this in. It was all one solid piece now.\n&lt; Guess there&#39;s disadvantages to everything.&gt; But she made it a note to do \nthis later, even if it meant surgery.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
