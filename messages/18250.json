One more false accusation, and you&#39;re GONE. \nGot that? Now, I took the time out of my lunch half-hour to search \nthrough the posts and get KSL&#39;s last three that had firing. Please \nreview:\n\n\nScattershot/Nemesis Enforcer/Dark One:\n\n\nScattershot watches as a few autoguns open fire on Sharpedge and \nJeststorm, \nScattershot descending a missile blast sending him plumetting into \nthe ground.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer blocked the blasts with his wings, which were badly \ndamaged. \n He fired off twenty-five rapid blasts at Jestorm, and 10 rapid optic \nblasts \noff at Jeststorm.\n\n---\n\nDark One, now turned around, fired off two missiles at Sharpedge.\n\n\n\n- Now, that&#39;s 25 rapid fire and 10 optics, and then two missiles. \nAnything wrong with that?\n\n\n\nDark One/Scattershot/Nemesis Enforcer:\n\n\n\nDark One barrel rolls, his wings getting clipped, though he still wa \nsin the \nair.  He awaited the chance to fire again as he started to turn \naround.\n\n---\n\nScattershot sidestepped in the air again, barely dodging the \nmissiles, the \nexplosions sending him flying backwards.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer flew up, a few blasts hitting his legs and feet.  He \nfired \noff twenty-five rapid laser blasts from his rifle at Jestorm, \nfollowed by \ntwelve rapid optic blasts at Jestorm&#39;s sternum.\n\n\n\n- 25 rapid fire lasers and 12 rapid fire optic blasts.\n\n\n\nNemesis Enforcer/Scattershot/Dark One/Shockwave:\n\n\nNemesis Enforcer blocks with his wings, but is sent flying back, \nslamming to \nthe ground,  firing 10 rapid optic blasts at Jetstorm&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nScattershot yelled as the missiles came, twirling through the air \nletting \nthem pass, keeping a cool composure on the outside, the inside he was \ngetting \nbeat.  The shockwave of the missiles had almost made him lose his \nbalance in \nthe air and crash.\n\nBut he was able to stay up.  Reaching into subspace, he pulled out \ntwo \ngrenades, one for each hand.  He dropped both grenades down at \nSharpedge, \nboth explosives set to go off on impact.\n\n---\n\nDark One got a target lock on Diskus, but saw that Nemesis Enforcer \nwas \nnearly beaten in his current situation.  Jetstorm (Dark One doesn&#39;t \nknow who \nhe is though) looked like a formidable opponent though.  Changing his \ncourse, \nhe fired twenty-five rapid laser blasts off at Jestorm&#39;s back.\n\nThe black jet fighter continued with on course, his missile launchers \narming.\n\n------\n\nShockwave stepped out of the forest, looking at the battle and \ncarnage.  Even \nif he could&#39;ve smiled, he wouldn&#39;t have.  His white right hand \ntransformed \ninto a long barrel.  The &#39;Decepticon&#39; looked around for a target, \nAlliance or \notherwise.\n\n\n- 10 rapid optic blasts, 2 grenades, 25 rapid laser shots.\n\n\nAlso, if you&#39;d notice, Unitron takes falling as an action. So unlike \nyou or me, when one of his bots falls, or even turns, he waits for \nthe next post to say it. Example:\n\n---\n\nScattershot sidestepped in the air again, barely dodging the \nmissiles, the \nexplosions sending him flying backwards.\n\n---\n\nIf that was my char, Scattershot would have jumped up, or regained \nbalance and returned fire. But he didn&#39;t. I copy-pasted these emails \nin a hurry (I&#39;m running out of time), but if you can find ANY others \nthat break the rule, forward away.\n\nOne more false accusation though, and I&#39;m either going to moderate or \nremove you. I&#39;m getting sick of this. People have to learn to take \ndefeat without whining.\n\n\nP.S. If you can&#39;t find any moding emails from Unitron, you will \nappologize to him.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
