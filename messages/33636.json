Second thought, that sucked. Here we go. Alloran joined this RPG the\n&gt; same time I did. We&#39;ve both known the hardships of working in the RPG and\n&gt; not getting everything explained properly, the way it should be. Finally,\n&gt; when we learned, we both found ourselves still being harrassed for all the\n&gt; wrong reasons. KSLawdogg arranged one of Alloran&#39;s character&#39;s death\nbecause\n&gt; he didn&#39;t like organics. Alloran has been the most patient, kindhearted\n&gt; person I&#39;ve ever known. I once got mad at him when he told me that he had\na\n&gt; character named Snare and I took offense to it. But he instantly made me\n&gt; feel like a mean spirited person by actually showing his bigness and\ntelling\n&gt; me that he didn&#39;t mean any harm. Alloran is not someone you would have to\n&gt; argue with. The way he explains things tells it all. You won&#39;t get beaten\n&gt; down verbally for asking him a question he doesn&#39;t like or accidentally\n&gt; mode. He&#39;ll merely state the problem and you&#39;ll find yourself with a good\n&gt; RPGer, who doubles as a fantastic person and friend, with extreme patience\n&gt; and understanding. Alloran would never treat himself superior over anyone,\n&gt; and will never insult your family because of some lame reason like &quot;you\n&gt; mode&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t like you, I never have,&quot; he&#39;s truly your best choice for\n&gt; council member. And he&#39;s got my vote...\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 30, 2001 11:39 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [NBWRPG] Election\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Vote for Alloran, because he really cares.
