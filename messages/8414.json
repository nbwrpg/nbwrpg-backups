He couldn&#39;t belive she thought \nthat she could actually defeat him! The smile disapears from his face as he \nsees the other rocket heading for him.\n\nZardus raises an arm to shield his face, flying sideways, but a bit too late. \nThe rocket grazes his arm, exploding. Zardus is blown the oposite direction, \nhis jetpack coming back on to stop him from slamming into a tree. He growls. \nApart from being charred, there was no major damage as far as his systems \ncould detect.\n\nHe sets his jetpack on full power, flying toward Kamodia and deactivating it \na bit off the ground, falling the rest of the way. He lands perfectly, \nrolling to his feet near Kamodia and taking out his sword in one fluid \nmotion. He slashes the sword at Kamodia.\n\n"}}
