On instinct programming he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into robot mode, and lied there, unmoving, eyes \n&gt; shut. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There were no more energon surges going through him, but he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seemed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite dead. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        That&#39;s when the hunger took over, his eyes whipped \n&gt; open, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reveal a new colour. His optics, which were normally light \n&gt; blue, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turned a frightening blood red. The colour almost illuminated \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room. When Vampirtron spole, it was with a slight \n&gt; modification to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vocal center, his voice was deeper and almost seemed to echo. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        &quot;Activating Mayfair Recording,&quot; He said, in a very \n&gt; flat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tone. Then his voice picked up emotions that weren&#39;t his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own, &quot;Ahh, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greetings,&quot; He said in a chipper voice, &quot;I see you have found \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pet. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, isn&#39;t this a golden opportunity? I think it is. What \n&gt; can I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you about Experiment 666? Well, he has no spark for one, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ironically, one of the most compasionate transformers I&#39;ve \n&gt; ever \n&gt; &gt; &gt; met. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How does he stay alive? Well, he feeds on other transformers. \n&gt; How \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does he make this process happen? Well, if this recording has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activated, I think you&#39;re all going to get a personal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstration.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vampirtron sat unmoving still, &quot;End of Mayfair Recording.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        Vampirtron sat still for a few more seconds, but \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up towards the nearest person, Nightlight. He opened his \n&gt; mouth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wide \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in midair, and huge canine teeth extended, with little drills \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end.
