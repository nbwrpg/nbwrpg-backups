He didnt like the idea of being controlled, by anyone.\nHe\n&gt; stood up and took a good look at himself. He looked the same in warrior\nmode\n&gt; as he did in his past life. The only wepon he could account for was a\n&gt; grapling gun. It was large, bulky, but very effective.\n&gt;     He transformed into his demonic centiped beast mode. It looked the\nsame\n&gt; as well. He hoovered in the air, his mouth full of jagged teeth and the\n&gt; grappling gun opened and closed, and the spikes that covered his body\nflexed\n&gt; and pulsed.\n&gt;     &quot;I dont suppose this is to bad after all, Autofire. Whoever this Vok\nis,\n&gt; it knows its weponry.&quot; He said, cruising in the hot air.\n&gt;     Useing his eight bug eyes, Adrax scanned the area for miles ahead. He\ngot\n&gt; the direction of the Predacon base, and with Autofire, began the journey.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
