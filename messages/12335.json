Its optics flickered on. This was no\nlonger the body of RebelYell. It now belonged to the\nrevived Maximal Sideswipe. Sideswipe shook his head\nfrom side to side, trying to throw off his feeling of\ngrogginess.He looked down at his sleek new black body.\n&quot;By the Matrix!&quot; he said softly.&quot;What happened to me?&quot;\nThe last thing he knew he was being blasted by\nMegastorm. Now he found himself in a body that was not\nhis own.Just then he noticed the sound of weapons\nfire.\nHe looked up. He recognized that ship. It was the Ark,\nand it was under heavy attack. He picked up the chain\ngun and laser rifle that were still lying on the\nground and rushed off to join the battle.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
