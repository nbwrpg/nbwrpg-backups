I was not getting angry at Airly.  You&#39;re\nnot on the council.  And I&#39;m DEFINATELY not gay, no\nmatter what the other people at school say.  Way back\nwhen dinosaurs roamed the Earth, I was in\nKindergarden, and everyone else dreamed of being the\nRed Ranger, I dreamed of doing the Pink and Yellow\nRangers, so I was straight back when most of you still\nthought girls were &quot;icky&quot;.\n\n--- Eric Bischoff &lt;1641coburn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Look Kyle, you better shut up now.  First of\n&gt; all, everybody knows that you&#39;re hetrophobic.  I\n&gt; have nothing wrong with gay people.  But that&#39;s not\n&gt; the point.  I was using &quot;faggot&quot; as a general\n&gt; insult.  Err, that&#39;s not the point either.  The\n&gt; point is, the more that I look at the post, the more\n&gt; I see how you we&#39;re getting angry at Airly more than\n&gt; being helpful.  And, always remember, listen to the\n&gt; nWo, and don&#39;t try to fight us.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; The preceding announcement has been paid for by the \n&gt; New World Order\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
