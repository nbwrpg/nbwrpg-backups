It had taken three weeks to clear the\nrubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a total\nloss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\ndestroyed ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably be\nmodified to be used by the loca police.\n\n&quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked the mayor, already knowing the answer.\n\n&quot;Yes.  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that our presence in the city\nmerely aggrivates conditions.  Without us, this island would become a\nmuch lower priority for our enemies.  Though I hope we can continue\nour research together; and I promise we will do anything we can to\nhelp the city.&quot;\n\n&quot;So where will you be going?&quot; the mayor asked after a moment of silence.\n\nPerseus walked to the windows and sighed.\n\n&quot;We Maximals have been divided for too long.  With this Unicronian\nthreat, and our recent truce with Megatron. it would be apropriate for\nus to put our diferences aside and work together.  So we&#39;ll first be\ngoing to meet with Lord Elder.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well my friend, I wish you the best of success.  You are always welcome here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;\n\n"}}
