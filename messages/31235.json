There were many advanteges tho \nto\n&gt; this new being....He transformed into a plant and decided to test \nhis\n&gt; abilities...First he tried his defense...With a single thought he \ngrew\n&gt; to an enormous tree..Planted hard in the ground unable to \nmove &quot;Great&quot;\n&gt; he thought. I am a frikkin tree.  He shrunk back down to a small\n&gt; plant...He could control his roots through the ground and he sped \nthem\n&gt; through the ground 200 m in all directions and then they\n&gt; stopped....not a bad limit....he then popped into the ground \nleaving a\n&gt; small hole and instantaneously grew 200 m away from the ends of one \nof\n&gt; his roots....He then agian shot his roots back to where he had come\n&gt; from and went back....He transformed to a bot. &quot;I should set some\n&gt; defence up and find out about this planet.

He was about 5 feet tall and not very large at \nall.\n&gt; &gt; But he could feel he had incridble speed. He reached to his side \nand\n&gt; &gt; grabbed two tubes from his hips.
