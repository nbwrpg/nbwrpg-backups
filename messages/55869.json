You do not raise your voice \nto me young one. I do not care who you think you are. You will show \nthe proper respect. I am the trainer here. You are the interloper. If \nyou want to play games, then leave and do your programming \nelsewhere.&quot; she said, growling. Her optics red with fury, and the fur \non the back of her neck standing up. &quot;You will learn your place young \none. In the pack, there is an order. And in that order, I am your \nsupior officer.&quot;  She took a step back to recompose herself. \n\nIn a more steady and lightly softer tone. &quot;You, young one are clever, \nsmart and well knowledged. But you have yet to really learn how to \nuse this talent to it&#39;s fullest potential. When you have, then you \nshall be leader. Untill then, I am still higher ranked. You will show \nthe rank respect if not the bot. Much like Hydras. He has my loyalty \nand respect. And I shall show that to all who are around me. You will \ndo well to do the same.&quot;\n\nShe turned and went back to the ring. Her arm still holding her \nstomach.\n\n\n"}}
