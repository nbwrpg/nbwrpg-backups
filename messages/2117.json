He struggles to his feet, takes out his launcher and fires at \nthe foilage that Shuko and co. ran off into. His eyes widen as he sees a \ncharge land near him.\n\nHe rolls away from it, but the thing explodes, sending a tree chunk flying in \nhis direction. The tree trunk hits his leg, nearly disabling it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeathStorm flies into the battle, firing shots off at Unitron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer grunts as farther shots hit him, an explosion from a charge sending \nhim flying through a boulder. He barely manages to sit up, firing a few \nhorribly aimed shots at the retreating preds.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot screams as his pelvic area is mutilated by further attacks. He \nfalls to the ground, trying to aim his gun at his attacker as he fires.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike dodges but yells as Anubis&#39; claws slash through his right optic \nand through half of his face. He fires some more shots at the predacon from \npoint-blank range.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeep inside the alliance base, the power supply shuts down to minimum energy \nusage, due to shield overloading. Outside, the shield flickers and \ndissapears, but the autoguns keep firing.\n\n"}}
