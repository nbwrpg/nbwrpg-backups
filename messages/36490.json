Instead \nwith his mouth still open, he laughed.  This was unexpected.  Unfortunately \nhe hadn&#39;t planned on needing to prevent this event.  It still amused him \nbecause now no one could move.  Neither the attackers nor the defenders could \nmove without the trap being disengaged.  So he stood and laughed.  Ignatius \nhad just signed his own death certificate.  The others would want to kill him \nonce they were released.\n\n"}}
