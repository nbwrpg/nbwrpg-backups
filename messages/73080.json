They might =\r\nbe dangerous over in\n&gt; &gt; numbers, but individually they were not threats.  =\r\nHOwever, thanks to the\n&gt; &gt; drilling, with luck he might ISOLATE small pocke=\r\nts of them to eliminate\n&gt; &gt; groupings cluster by cluster.  Ignoring the bra=\r\nwling leaders for now - that\n&gt; &gt; was the battle of the leaders, not his mis=\r\nsion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What injuries he would take would hopefully be minor, and his=\r\n superior skill\n&gt; &gt; would allow him to take on pockets of sharkticons one a=\r\nt a time!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - DINOBOT AND VICEGRIP&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But at this point, DI=\r\nNOBOT was intercepted then by the charging SHARKTICON,\n&gt; &gt; and his response=\r\n oer was qutie brutal!  Metallidiko taught to do the most\n&gt; &gt; powerful blow=\r\n when your enemy could not resist it, so his large tail cannon\n&gt; &gt; swung ar=\r\nound on his arm then to try and blast it over at point blank range\n&gt; &gt; in t=\r\nhe faceplate!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP just went to transform now back =\r\nto his robot mode,\n&gt; &gt; attempting to use his superior strength to try and p=\r\nickl up one SHARKTICOn\n&gt; &gt; and then toss it over at the rest like a bowling=\r\n ball!\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT was having a powerful affect on the SHARKTICON he was f=\r\nacing.\n&gt; While they were better trained the the SHARKTICONS of old, they we=\r\nre\n&gt; still no match for his martial arts moves as several of them fell to\n&gt;=\r\n DINOBOT&#39;S bliningly fast moves!\n&gt; \n&gt; The same thing was happening with VIC=\r\nE GRIP! Picking up one he was\n&gt; able to send that hapless SHARKTICON sailin=\r\ng into several of his\n&gt; companions, all of them landing on the ground in a =\r\nheap!\n&gt; \n&gt; Up ahead SKYSHADOW and his FUZORS were up ahead cutting a wide s=\r\nwath\n&gt; into the SHARKTICONS as well. Thier ferocious attcks eating quickly\n=\r\n&gt; into their numbers.\n&gt; \n&gt; However the battle was not over as still more SH=\r\nARKTICONS were\n&gt; streaming over to them led by their leader SKYBYTE, who li=\r\nke most\n&gt; proud DECEPTICOn and PREDACON generals were was leading from the =\r\nback!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Attack my prcious armies, attack!&quot; He whooped in delight pushin=\r\ng the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS forward!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - NIGHTLIGHT&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;NO!... STAY=\r\n AWAY OFF ME!!!&quot; Said the femm while she weakly stuggle creating enoguh\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n noise to be notice, she acummulated all the enrgy that she could and shoot=\r\n a enrgy ball\n&gt; &gt; at Saberback&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; SABERBACK seemed mo=\r\nre surprised by NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s attack then truly hurt\n&gt; by it, although it di=\r\nd cause him to back up a few steps as the\n&gt; explosion went off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n - STRAIGHT SHOT&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot turns her head quickly in Nightligh=\r\nt&#39;s direction and quickly\n&gt; &gt; bounds over to her as quickly as she can.  Wh=\r\nile kicking up some dust, at a\n&gt; &gt; sharp halt, she releases a barrage of ex=\r\nplosive quills in Saberback&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; direction in attempts to back Nightlight =\r\nup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;HEY, UGLY!  EVER FEEL STUCK AT YOUR JOB?!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sev=\r\neral quills sink deep into SABERBACK and he hissed in pain. Pulling\n&gt; out h=\r\nis cannon he pointed it at NIGHTLIGHT as the small wine of a full\n&gt; charge =\r\ncould be heard, &quot;Try that again and it will be this Maximal of\n&gt; yours that=\r\n will pay the penalty!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile two soldiers were rushing towards ST=\r\nRAIGHT SHOT, they looked\n&gt; somehting like DINOBOTS but with signifigantly l=\r\ness armor. Thier\n&gt; weapons were out and facing STRAIGHT SHOT as they pounde=\r\nd forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   As Tucson rears up to bravely fa=\r\nce Magmatron, he returns to robot mode\n&gt; &gt; .  With a brave face, he stands =\r\nfirm and ready to take on his challenger.\n&gt; &gt; Yet while he does so he casua=\r\nlly shifts a foot across the ground and\n&gt; &gt; dislodges a fairly good sized s=\r\ntone of diamond like volcanic rock.  He\n&gt; &gt; crouches down to pick it up.  S=\r\nlowly Tucson rises to his feet.  He playfully\n&gt; &gt; handles the stone for a m=\r\noment or so.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Size isn&#39;t everything, Magmatron.  Sometimes the mos=\r\nt successful warriors\n&gt; &gt; are no bigger than I am.  Yet you may not underst=\r\nand what I&#39;m telling you\n&gt; &gt; because these were the words of Yoketron.  And=\r\n I&#39;m not about to divulge any\n&gt; &gt; of his secrets to the likes of you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; He turns away for a moment, as if not about to do anything.  He takes a=\r\n step\n&gt; &gt; back but then, he takes a running start, and a quick leap in the =\r\nair\n&gt; &gt; followed by a very quick toss of the stone in an attempt to strike =\r\nMagmatron\n&gt; &gt; in one of his eyes!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The stone flies at bullet speed.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The stone sailed gracefully through the air, twisting and turning. It\n=\r\n&gt; rose in a powerful arc, only to be pulled down by the force of gravity\n&gt; =\r\nand the unerring aim of TUSCON. With a snap it hit MAGMATRON right\n&gt; betwee=\r\nn the optics causing the large mech to step back a pace or two!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A roc=\r\nk?&quot; He said as he felt his head as if half expecting something\n&gt; of far mor=\r\ne danger and yet finding none. &quot;Is that all you have?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He smiled darkl=\r\ny as he looked at TUSCON and then LEO and BIG CONVOY as\n&gt; they all stood be=\r\nfore him. &quot;Ahh, then it comes down to this then, the\n&gt; three of you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHe chuckled darkly as he wiped away the stone that had lodged itself\n&gt; in h=\r\nis faceplate, it hit the ground and bounced away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile MAGMATRON =\r\nassumed a martial arts pose of his own, gesturing\n&gt; for them to come foward=\r\n, &quot;all of you!, come!&quot; He gestured as he swung\n&gt; his large sword and then a=\r\nssumed another pose of calm readiness. &quot;It\n&gt; is time to finish this!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAt the same time RODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS continued to fight!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Kick -=\r\n punch - block - spin kick, high kick - duck\n&gt; \n&gt; The very air was full of =\r\nthe movements of the two, they were seemingly\n&gt; a mirror image of each othe=\r\nr, one of bright hot fire the other one of\n&gt; the blackest of night - cold a=\r\nnd deadly!\n&gt; \n&gt; They fought each other RODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS, thier figh=\r\nt taking\n&gt; them  towards OPTIMUS PRIME as the one time AUTOBOT leader lay h=\r\nanging\n&gt; by his hands over the pit.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
