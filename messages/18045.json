She turned her back to her and worked on the\n&gt; computer, gathering the info.  She wasn&#39;t really happy with this bot.\n&gt; Something about her felt fake. But she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it.\n&gt; Her mongoose insticts told her that there was a snake near by. She\n&gt; glanced back at LadyHawk and smiled. Then turned back to the computer\n&gt; console. She watched as the printer printed up the sheets and she\n&gt; folded them up and placed them on the counter for later on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her sweet, innocent, friendly nature would give her the advantage.\n&gt; She only played at being this little helpless bot that was just so\n&gt; helpful.  She was still new enough to this group that she couldn&#39;t do\n&gt; anything.  She wondered seince she was no fighter, if she could work\n&gt; her way up through the ranks and see just how far she could go.  She\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to stay with these bots yet or not.  Sh\n&gt; also wasn&#39;t sure if they were the strongest group around. IF they\n&gt; were the best, she would stay with them. If not, she would learn all\n&gt; she could and then turn over the info to the strongest group. Her\n&gt; survival insticts were on full swing.  For her, insticts were a more\n&gt; involved thought proccess, not just a gut feeling.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk curled up in a corner with her wings folded around her.\n&gt; Squizzy\n&gt; &gt; might not be entirely incompetent after all, &quot;If there are any\n&gt; problems wake\n&gt; &gt; me, with any luck you&#39;ll turn out to be a usefull lackey yet.&quot; she\n&gt; closed\n&gt; &gt; two of her eyes, keeping the third one active and on Squizzy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
