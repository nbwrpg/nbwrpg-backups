The body was made to \nbe the master in war. Spying, fighting, piloting, hacking, if it was in a \nwar he knows what to do, but the Protoforms did some no one could see \ncoming.  They developed a new characteristic���emotions.  In all the other \nProtoform it led to the death of them.  Porotoform 5 was let off easy with \nonly the death of his spark.  Zardus one day found my old, lifeless body and \nbegan what he called �Project X� not many people were in on this project.  \nHe began to remodel, and reprogram.  Adding a couple of extra thing for his \nprotection.  For years he looked for the perfect spark.  He was either \ndistracted by other battles or the spark just slipped thought his fingers.  \nDelta�s eye were now open��..he can�t remember much most on the memory was \nlost in the re-programming. He looks around seeing 2 people in the room. One \nhe knew who he was right off as Zardus.\n\n�I AM REBORN!!�\n\n/_&#92;Delta/_&#92;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
