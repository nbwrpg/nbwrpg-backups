Upwards the pod was propelled until it broke surface.  After that, \nRagnus transformed into his Red Dragon mode and ripped his way out of the \npod.  As he took to the air he searched for the attackers.\n\n\n&gt;\t&quot;Uhh RAGNUS!&quot; Switchblade yells in the large bot&#39;s ear,\n&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve gotta get those jets off our back, and fast.&quot; Not waiting for\n&gt;an answer, he manually controls the autoguns and missiles\n&gt;launcher, firing off a successful thirty bullets, and two missiles at\n&gt;the attacking ship.\n&gt;\tNoting that the sensors pick up Astroblast&#39;s signature near by\n&gt;on the Azores Islands, he opens a commlink to Astroblast.\n&gt;&quot;Astroblast, we&#39;ve got a bogey on our back side making passes\n&gt;with missiles, and I&#39;m not sure how much longer we can hold out.\n&gt;Get your self over here and eliminate the enemy. I&#39;m trying to deter\n&gt;him with the ship&#39;s defenses, but, well, I&#39;m not having much luck.&quot;\n&gt;Switchblade sighs as he closes the commlink. Scanners indicate\n&gt;that the ship is heading past the tip of Newfoundland this moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tAstroblast looks up as he receives the commlink, replying\n&gt;immediately. &quot;All right, we can&#39;t lose the ship now, I&#39;ll be right\n&gt;over.&quot; He opens a commlink to Stratus. &quot;Stratus, the main base is\n&gt;under attack and I&quot;m going over to mess up a bot, so you&#39;re in\n&gt;charge of getting that ship down there to the surface. Abominus will\n&gt;try to help.&quot; He chuckles, &quot;Astroblast out.&quot;\n&gt;\tThe moderately tall subcommander transforms into spaceship\n&gt;mode, and fires his rear and vertical thrusters at once, heading off\n&gt;towards the Dark Avian. His scanners pick up the enemy quite\n&gt;quickly but he is too far away to engage.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
