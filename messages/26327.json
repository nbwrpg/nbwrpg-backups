This is what he dreamed:\n    \n    The Autobot=\r\ns had been making a mosterous creature to battle the Decpticons. They had b=\r\nuilt him smaller so he would be easy to control. He was quite ugly, and the=\r\ny had decided to bring him on the Ark to finish. They put him in a Stasis P=\r\nod of the day and left. Then the Decpticons attacked. \n    The monster had =\r\nawoken. He left the safty of the Stasis Pod and learned of the Decpticons. =\r\nHe had drained one of it&#39;s mech fluid and learned much about their life, an=\r\nd the Vivodes. He now considered himself one of these creatures, a Vivode D=\r\necpticon.\n    He knew the Ark was going to crash, and he programmed his pod=\r\n to exit and find a safe spot to land, he planned on becoming a major playe=\r\nr in the upcoming war. It never happened. His Pod landed saftly. But it was=\r\n swallowed by the Earth. He lay dormant for centuries, and had learned of a=\r\nll that had happened. He had a connection to the Autobots, and thus could s=\r\nee the Great War. Then came the Beast Wars, and with it, Trantulas. He some=\r\nhow had a connection to this one as well, but not from the Autobot part of =\r\nhim, it was from the Vivode part. He watched the Beast Wars until the momen=\r\nt Trantulas died. He knew that the time of his awakening was coming close a=\r\nt hand. All he needed were pawns to bring him about.\n    He had gone insane=\r\n while waiting and he now thought the Autobots would awaken and destroy all=\r\n. He now thought that he had to destroy them, for his sake, and all Transfo=\r\nrmers.\n\n    And now he had them, Battera and Cerberus. They would bring abo=\r\nut the destruction of all Transformers decended from Autobot, his makers.
