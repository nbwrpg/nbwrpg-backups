What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; Tavatron knew something was definitely wrong this \ntime. Dinobot didn&#39;t just drop his weapon, something had to be seriously \nwrong. Tavatron fired her optic lasers at Sinesis&#39; chest. She unshesthed her \nstaff and held it in a fighting stance.\n\nShe knew Dinobot was trying to protect her, and she appreciated it, she \nreally did. No one had ever cared enough about her to risk their own welfare \nin exchange for her safety. It was... nice.\n\nTavatron snarled at Sinesis and fired her optic lasers at him multiple \ntimes.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
