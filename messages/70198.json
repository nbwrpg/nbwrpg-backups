Nightshift&#39;s right. I shouldn&#39;t try to do this \n&gt;&gt; alone. And I know you wish to redeem yourself faithfully. Well, this is \n&gt;&gt; where we begin. I trust you&#39;ll be able to handle this with ease.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He alligns his missile launchers in anticipation of a shoot out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus nodded as he checked his rifle, his photon eliminator, the\n&gt; weapon was still full of power and ready to go, as was the rest of his\n&gt; weaponry. He looked back up at Tuscon and nodded, &quot;Ready!&quot; he said\n&gt; with a grim intensity.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup attached himself the device and coneccted his traking devices to keep \n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; eye in predacon signatures and looking to Nightlight and then to Rodimus, \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; said &quot;I&#39;ll care her with my life...&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The old Autobot waited to Rodimus response, perhaps he would like to tell\n&gt;&gt; something else before take her with him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at Kup, &quot;Take her, protect her. I have trusted you with\n&gt; my life in the past, and now I trust you with hers.&quot; Rodimus&#39;\n&gt; attention was ripped away from Kup by Darkhawk . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;YOU WONT GO TO ANY WHERE!!!!&quot;Said Darkhwak aiming his gun\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes they will!&quot; Rodimus said as he stepped slightly from his postion,\n&gt; hopefully drawing attention away from Kup and Nightlight to him.\n&gt; Flicking his weapon to full stunning power he fired at Darkhawk,\n&gt; trying to stun him and take him out of action.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as Rodimus acted, Cyclonus, Deepstryke, and Phobia stepped around\n&gt; the corner weapons already drawn, backing up Scourge, Scorponok and\n&gt; Darkhawk. Thier presence making the count atleast six Predacon,\n&gt; Decepticons and Minions against four beleagered Maximals and Autobots\n&gt; - well only three if Kup actually leaves!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Cyclonus intoned dangerously, his voice deep and commanding, &quot;they \n&gt; won&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Without a thought Rodimus clicked his weapon over to combat mode and\n&gt; sent beams of searing electricity at Cyclonus and the others with him,\n&gt; forcing them to step back. &quot;GO!&quot; Rodimus barked at Kup, &quot;We will\n&gt; follow when we can!&quot; He said without thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus and the others forces of Hydras began returning fire lighting\n&gt; up the hallway!\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus spoke to Tuscon without turning away from the firefight, &quot;We\n&gt; may want fall back, Hydras himself will be here soon!&quot; It was not fear\n&gt; in Rodimus voice, only the grim reality of battle and the stating of\n&gt; options. It was clear by Rodimus&#39; actions that he was ready to lay\n&gt; down his life in protection of the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LEGACY, Quickstride, Rat Trap\n&gt; Location: Outside the Black fortress\n&gt;\n&gt; In the distance, should either Rat Trap or Quickstride be looking in\n&gt; the proper direction the large form of Legacy could be made out in the\n&gt; distance. A small but growing black spec appearing on the horizon. He\n&gt; was still in his military satalite mode, and that was becoming more\n&gt; and more evident as time passed as his shape slowly became more clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Maximals and Autobots&quot; Legacy&#39;s familiar yet cold voice reached\n&gt; through the encrypted Autobot channels hopefully to catch Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; attention, but at the very least Rat Trap and Quickstride, &quot;What is\n&gt; your status? I shall be arriving in 187.55 astro seconds.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Airly, if you want Talon and the shuttle to accompany that is\n&gt; fine. It is up to Kraftlos if he want&#39;s his characters aboard as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
