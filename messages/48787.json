Unitron (Sorry, can&#39;t remember the other name, it bei=\r\nng new and all, and I love Unicron rip offs!) is absolutely correct about t=\r\nhis when he said that we&#39;re all being punished for something dipshit (Dewbo=\r\ny) did. Second, Hugar is thrown off the council by someone who was voted in=\r\n for EQUAL POWER. You threw off someone of EQUAL POWER, rAuq, and without t=\r\nhe people voting for it. The people of the RPG are allowed to make this cho=\r\nice for a reason. Zardus thought it would make the RPG a better community, =\r\nand it has. It is stupid to try to revoke the people&#39;s privileges. We might=\r\n as well have a tyrannical ruler instead of a US President! Then without th=\r\ne people voting him in, we have Warrior Azure as a moderator. I am in no wa=\r\ny saying he won&#39;t make a good moderator, but that still is not the point. H=\r\ne wasn&#39;t voted into office. He just is suddenly assigned to the position be=\r\ncause &quot;rAuq says so&quot; WHATSUPWITHAT!?!? This seems to be a matter of someone=\r\n&#39;s head getting a little too big, maybe. Oh, you can moderate me if you wan=\r\nt, but if you do, I&#39;ll leave, and I won&#39;t ever come back. What&#39;s important =\r\nis that I stood up for what is right.
