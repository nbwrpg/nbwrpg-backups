He knew something had to\nbe done, and did=\r\n not care what condition he was in. For now, Rat Trap had\nstopped the leaki=\r\nng of battery fluid, and for this moment, with the regular\nflow of fluid ba=\r\nck into his system, he could at least transform into his\nrobot mode, with j=\r\nust a bit of pain from his injurred arm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Torca, thank you for your he=\r\nlp, I appreciate it deeply. Now, it&#39;s my\nturn to contribute to the cause. T=\r\nhe only way we&#39;ll be able to regain\ncontrol of the Ark, is if we throw off =\r\na disrupter wave, that will cancel\nout enemy programming. I am now capable =\r\nof doing so since we are at such\nclose range.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He narrows his optics da=\r\nngerously. This meant he was fully prepared to do\nwhatever it took to regai=\r\nn the Ark&#39;s control.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift transforms and prepares to back up h=\r\nis commander.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; This is gonna work, I know it will.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson then tr=\r\nansmits to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, as full control of the Ark is re establis=\r\nhed, it will be your\n&gt; opportunity to head a clean sweep of the Ark entirel=\r\ny. That means any\nenemy\n&gt; forces that are still present, will be yours for =\r\nthe capture. But do not\n&gt; destroy. Anyone you find, will be valuable for qu=\r\nestioning. Once captured,\n&gt; they&#39;re to be brought to the questioning room, =\r\nwhere I will personally\n&gt; question them myself. Good luck comrade.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n=\r\n\nRodimus responded, =93Gotcha. We=92ll be ready.=94\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; His expre=\r\nssion turns resolute as he now stands solidly with a firm foot on\nthe groun=\r\nd. He begins to transmit the most powerful sonar wave ever emitted\nby his s=\r\nystems.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, I&#39;m transmitting now. Be prepared. Leo ll, I&#39;ll need y=\r\nou to head\n&gt; another scouring team on the outer parameter of the Ark. No do=\r\nubt if there\n&gt; are any enemy forces that have escaped, they may still be wi=\r\nthin range of\n&gt; capture. Take the south parameter and extend your search as=\r\n widely as you\nsee\n&gt; fit. Noctorro, I will need you to head a group of Maxi=\r\nmals to scour the\nNorth\n&gt; Parameter outside the Ark&#39;s boundaries. The furth=\r\ner we go, the better our\n&gt; chances are at capturing enemy intruders. Night =\r\nShift, I want you to go\nwith\n&gt; Kup, and scour the East Paramater. Talon, Wi=\r\nndlord, Rat Trap, you will\ntake\n&gt; the West Parameter. Go as far as all of y=\r\nou see fit, but safely within\nrange.\n&gt; It&#39;s our only assurance of securing =\r\nour base from further attack.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLeagcy responded, =93Understood. Shu=\r\ntting down shield now.=94 He said. The\nreason behind this maneuver was obvi=\r\nous, if he did not, the shield would\nmore than likely repel most if not all=\r\n of Tuscon=92s blast wave.\n\nAt the same time each of the Maximals gave thei=\r\nr assent to Tuscon and go off\nin different directions. It was time to clean=\r\n up the area around the Ark,\nand make sure there were not other surprises w=\r\naiting for them.\n\nMeanwhile Tuscon began his wave assault! Like a tidal wav=\r\ne constructed of\nultrasonic sound the blast began to roll over the Ark, the=\r\n very air\nshimmering in its path.\n\nInside the Ark different systems began t=\r\no spark as the energy quickly\noverloaded delicate systems. Legacy quickly a=\r\nttempted to reroute power, but\neven he was not entirely successful.\n\nOn the=\r\n bridge several systems shorted causing other back up systems to kick\ninto =\r\nplace. All over the Ark, power that had been previously shut off turned\nbac=\r\nk on flooding the Ark with lights once again . . . and then sending parts\no=\r\nf it back into darkness as circuit breakers blew.\n\n=93FRELL!=94 The intrude=\r\nr barked as he shimmered for a moment, his cloaking\ndevice temporarily shor=\r\nted by Tuscon=92s blast. He looked up, but at the\nmoment there was no one n=\r\near him, the other Maximals having caught up with\nthe little femme bot were=\r\n a few hallways away.\n\nWith the skill of a master ninja he stepped into the=\r\n shadows as he pulled\nout his blades.\n\nMEANWHILE NEAR HYDRAS:\n\nScourge knee=\r\nled down next to Hydras, as all the sweeps were doing to keep\nthe lead Pred=\r\nacon hidden from the sensor beams from the Ark.\n\n=93ACK!=94 Scourge said as=\r\n he watched Tuscon fire his beam at the Ark, =93That\nmust of hurt!=94 He co=\r\nuld see the power moving over the Ark.\n\nOne of the Sweeps nudged Scourge an=\r\nd pointed at two Maximals approaching\ntheir position, it was Nightshift and=\r\n Kup. If that got much closer their\ncover would be blown!\n\nA message came f=\r\nrom Nighrazor, =93Whatever you=92re going to do Hydras you had\nbetter do it=\r\n now, the bots are waking up.=94\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\r\n--bcaec53f9797c7d591049e3a0483\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;ON THE BRIDGE:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&g=\r\nt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt; Quickstride gives a somewhat relieved sm=\r\nile, and looks to Wing Caliber, with a short sigh.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&gt; &quot;Thanks, that cuts a lot of pause time out that&#39;s for sure=\r\n.
