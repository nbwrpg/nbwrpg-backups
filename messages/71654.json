She looks around quick=\r\nly and realizes the\n&gt; terrain was full of trees that may be damaged but wer=\r\ne still stable enough\n&gt; to hold her weight.  She jumps up to catch a hangin=\r\ng branch and like a\n&gt; skilled acrobat, she manages to swing herself up high=\r\ner into the trees.\n&gt; From there, she could see a large branch severely crac=\r\nked, hanging right\n&gt; over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.     She then spots a large t=\r\nree root at the edge\n&gt; of what looked like a tar pool.  How convenient was =\r\nthat?  And she certainly\n&gt; was fast enough to dart out of the way if she ha=\r\nd to.  But if she could only\n&gt; break that branch without falling out of the=\r\n tree herself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda predictabl=\r\ne..  So why not try\n&gt; something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n She examines the crack in the branch.  She finds that with just a strong h=\r\nit\n&gt; with a sharp object, the branch would definitely come down. She raises=\r\n a\n&gt; brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the branch.  She=\r\n hits\n&gt; her target as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from the damage=\r\nd tree\n&gt; with a loud creaking noise.  She hoped her first plan of attack wo=\r\nuld work.\n&gt; Phase two would also prove difficult as she waits to see how th=\r\ne chips fall,\n&gt; literally.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Timber..&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW =96 Dark Rodimus&gt;\n\n(OOC: =\r\nRemember, I said the figure stepped into a clearing.

He watched her swing up into the trees and try to\nbring a branch dow=\r\nn.\n\n=93How very amusing.=94 He said the smile on DARK RODIMUS=92 face was b=\r\narely\nvisible in the fading moonlight that cut through all the barren trees=\r\n.\nMost of the leaves and even a lot of the bark had been either knocked\nor =\r\nburned away from the trees making them look like so many match\nsticks. Even=\r\n the tar pit had not escaped the ravages of the fires that\nhad recently bur=\r\nned through, it was dried up and looked almost solid\nthe water leeched away=\r\n by the heat that had so recently ripped through\nthe area.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Night=\r\nshift&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Nightshift watches from a good distance as Straight Sh=\r\not attempts\n&gt; to play decoy with Dark Rodimus.
