Two male figure watched the scene in a corritor without disturb: \n&gt; Kup\n&gt; and windlord .\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus just sat there as holding his darling wife as slowly energy\nbegan to fill her systems. �Take it easy.� He said to her as he gently\ntried to allow her to lay back and rest. �We have so many things to\ncatch up on so many things to do.�\n\nFor the moment work was forgotten, all other cares and concerns were\nput to the side as he sat there and looked at Nightlight just so happy\nthat she was alive again with her full memories.\n\nYes, things were looking good.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup had a wide smile in his face and Windlord looked more serious, still \n&gt; he\n&gt; remember all the pain that hydras forced him to do... Or more accurately \n&gt; he\n&gt; willing did as Predacon\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor laughted quietly and said &quot;If you want to do that not know\n&gt; LEgacy&#39;s faction, what would you do with me that still I&#39;m a predacon?&quot;\n&gt; then he smirked, and stated to observe the reacion of Nightlight and \n&gt; smiled\n&gt; &quot;She seems to be totally healed and with no psicological damage... \n&gt; Amazing&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nOutside Leo II walked up and through the glass. �It seems we have\ncause to celebrate.� He said.\n\n�And so many things to think about.� Torca said causing Leo II to look at \nhim.\n\n�It�s why I came back.� Torca said in response to the look.\n\nBoth he and Leo had just come out of the recharging chambers and\nlooked as if they had just walked off the assembly line.\n\nLeo II nodded, �Yes I know.� He looked saddened and then looked back\nat Rodimus through the glass again. �There are going to be some hard\nchoices to make.�\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar winces with a sheepish look on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ooops, I - didn&#39;t hear ya comming.. Okay, okay, so yeah, I&#39;m rankn&#39; on \n&gt; &#39;em\n&gt; my bad. But seriously, okay, Legacy works well in battles but his social\n&gt; skills, leave lots ta be desired.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot shrugs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m staying out of this. I&#39;m not the one who brought up the counting\n&gt; thing.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride nudges Uproar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nice going, open mouth insert paw.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uproar shrugs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, it&#39;s kinda true. Every time we try ta ask &#39;em a question we get\n&gt; blown off.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yeah, that part is kind of right. He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable\n&gt; part, and nothing against him but, he is treading on thin ice with Tucson\n&gt; sir, and I really think someone should talk to Tucson before he blows his\n&gt; own stack. I can see it in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him \n&gt; that\n&gt; seems troubling. One of these days a real fight between them will break \n&gt; out\n&gt; and there may be no way ta stop it. I tried talking to Tucson but he&#39;s as\n&gt; stubborn as Ratchet in that respect. So, how do we hold the peace with \n&gt; both\n&gt; of them, because I&#39;d really like ta know that.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Straightshot, Uproar, Quickstride and Perceptor talked Lord Elder\nstopped but kept his back to them a smile blooming across his face. As\nthey talked about what they truly thought of Legacy and his\nrelationship with Tuscon Elder nodded and turned his face now more\nsomber and sober.\n\n�You are right.� He said as he walked back towards them. �I had\ntrouble getting to know Legacy, even though it was just me and him\nguarding the Ark together for a while.�\n\nElder shrugged, �Heck, sometimes I STILL feel like I don�t know him\nwell.� He glanced at each of them. �But maybe we can all try a little\nharder.�\n\nGlancing back in the direction of where Tuscon was Elder nodded\nsolemnly. �I will see if I can talk with Tuscon.� He looked back at\nthe others. �If they got into it I don�t know who would win the\nbattle, but I also feel they it would not be good . . . for any of\nus.�\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The would be a Prime problem&quot;commended dryly the Predacon\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nElder looked back at the others, a smile coming back on his face.\n�Perhaps you guys should take the time to get to know Perceptor a\nlittle better. After all, up until now we have only known him an\nadversary.� Lord Elder gestured at Perceptor with a friendly shooing\nmotion.\n\n�I will, in the mean time go and have a talk with Tuscon.� Elder\nturned to walk away.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
