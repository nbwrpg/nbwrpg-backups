She had felt the jolt and cringed, just as long as they made \nit to the island in one piece she didn&#39;t care.\nCarnage looked at Cyber Claw as she flew up beside her and spoke, she \nsnarled at what she told her. But what could she do about it, she was \ndangling from the front paws of a wolf with wings and couldn&#39;t do much. She \nsighed...*\n\n&quot; Fine, whatever. I don&#39;t care anymore.&quot;\n\n**********************************************************\n\n* Dinobot entered into the Ark, his rifle by his side incase somebot got the \nstupid idea to jump him. He snarled and looked at the Predacon&#39;s infront of \nhim, he had made the promise to himself that he wouldn&#39;t let the bots inside \nof the ship get hurt and he planned to keep it! No matter the cost!\nSuddenly he saw something that he had been waiting for ever since he had \ncome back online, something that suddenly made his mech fluid boil in his \nveins!\nHe growled...Megatron!\nHis adrenalin rose and he gripped the rifle tighter, the back of his enemy \nwas turned to him but he knew who it was! He knew that voice that ripped \nthrough his mind by spark, that poumpous and arrogant sound that had once \ntold him that he was defeated mearly because he wasn&#39;t transmetal. Well, now \nthings had changed!\nDinobot roared in rage at the back of his enemy...*\n\n&quot; MEGATRON!!!&quot;\n\n*Even before the echo of his voice died away Dinobot advanced towards the \nPredacon&#39;s back, he raised the rifle and began to fire. All action and \nscreams were drowned out by his pure rage towards this bot, all he saw and \nheard was the Predacon in which he fired upon. Megatron!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
