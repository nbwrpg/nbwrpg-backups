Vulois quickly responded.\n\n&quot;Excellent! Now hurry and bring the driver here. The sooner Hell \nBeast gets it, the sooner we can go home.&quot;\n\nVulois turns back to Hell Beast.\n\n&quot;So, sir, will you grant Terminess her lab?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTerminess continued to work dilegently on the Pred base&#39;s auto-guns \nand shields.\n\n&quot;Soon, with a lot more work, the auto-guns will activate as soon as \nthey detect any signature that is not Predacon within a certain \ndistance. They will start firing once the signature gets a bit \ncloser. No more motion detection. To get inside the Pred base, a bot \nwould have to destroy the auto-guns. Hehehehehe!&quot;\n\nTerminess continues to mumble to herself as she works on the auto-\nguns.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nOctociz s now very scared. No Maximal has seemed to respond to \nBronco&#39;s message. Maybe they don&#39;t care about him. Maybe they didn&#39;t \nget the message. Maybe they have more important things, like an \nattack. Whatever the case, Octociz sucks up his fear and begins to \npray to The Matrix of Leadership. If he is going to die today, he&#39;ll \ndo it with honour, and not like a cowardly little school fem-bot. \nBronco looks at him and smiles.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re here. This is a famous spot in Maximal history. See the water \ndown there? Buried beneath there is the remnants of the Axalon. The \noriginal base of the Maximals in the Beast Wars. Optimus Primal, \nRhinox, Cheetor, Rat Trap, Dino-bot, Tigertron, and Airazor all \nserved here with honour and respect. And in one mega-cycle, you will \ndie with respect. A simple execution, and then you&#39;re body will be \ndumped into the sea to be buried with the Axalon. A true Maximal \ndeath. What&#39;s that? You don&#39;t want to die? We&#39;ll, you had better \nhurry for your Maximal friends to come save you, and bring me my \ncomputer, or it&#39;s all over.&quot;\n\nOctociz resumed his praying, hoping, pleading that the Maximals would \ncome in time.\n\n\n"}}
