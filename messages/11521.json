Letting his feet hit the grassy ground, he \nstopped moving for a moment.  How was he going to help Bright Blade?  He had \nno idea where she&#39;d be coming from.  No idea how to get into the base.\n\nAlthough, she&#39;d probably tell him where she was, and if to provide cover \nfire.  He took out his missile launcher, getting on his abdomen.  He began \ncrawling for the Cybertronian Fire.  He would take a position, and wait for a \nmessage.  If he didn&#39;t get one soon, maybe he could convince the rest of the \nAlliance to aid him, after all, Bright Blade MUST&#39;VE found something of \nimportance.\n\n"}}
