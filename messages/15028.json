He wondered \nwhat Panzertron had wanted to talk to him about. He narrows his eyes, his \nscanners reporting a Maximal signature.\n\nZardus growls. It was one of the signatures of the bots that the Alliance had \ntaken hostage earlier...\n\n&quot;Dark One, are you and your team busy right now?&quot; he says into his comm-link, \ntracking the signature.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOblitertron stops a few miles away from the Cybertronian Fire, watching the \nMaximals get away. They were lucky this time, next time they&#39;d all die....\n\nThe gestalt group seperates again, Dark One recieving Zardus&#39; transmission.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he replies, &quot;The Maximals got away, this time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; sounds Zardus; voice, &quot;There are a pair of Maximals in Grid 36,&quot; \n(OOC: I forgot the coordinates they were in, so I&#39;m guessing), &quot;One of them \nis one of the past hostages, the other one is another Maximal.&quot;\n\nDark One growls. He still remembered crawling to the CR chambers after the \nMaximal rescue mission...\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; he says to his team, &quot;We&#39;ve got Maximals to kill.&quot;\n\nWith that, he flies off toward Dinobot&#39;s and Tavatron&#39;s position, the rest of \nthe Oblitercons following on the ground.\n\n"}}
