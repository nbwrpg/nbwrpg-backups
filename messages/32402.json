She stood up and \nstretched.\n\n&quot;Where am I?&quot; She said to herself as she looked around the forest. The last \nthing she remembered was being put in a pod and sent off. Animals made noise \naround her, making her uncomfortable. She was not a social robot, so being \naround alot of beings usually made her uncomfortable.\n\nAntagony looked down at herself and saw that she was a dark purple, with \nskin-tight armor plates attached onto her body. Her armor did a good job at \nshowing off her curves. She couldn&#39;t tell exactly what she looked like since \nshe didn&#39;t have a mirror, but what she saw was good. She looked up to see if \nanyone was coming.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
