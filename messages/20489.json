She lifted her head and looked \naround. Her shoulder was becoming extremly painful. She winced and \nlayed her head back down. She was thinking about how Lunarpine had \nreacted to her. She was certain that he wasn&#39;t happy with her new \nform. She sighed and stood up. She smelled that scent again. She \nlooked and saw a form coming towards her. She didn&#39;t think anything \nof it and kept walking. Leaving a puddle of blood in the snow where \nshe had layed down at. Her bandaged was soaked and was falling off. \nShe shrugged her shoulder and let out a pained roar. THe bandage fell \nto the ground and she sniffed it. It smelled aweful and acidy. \n\nShe walked on, as the snow fell to the ground a little harder. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Wolf::\n&gt; \n&gt; An organic arctic wolf made its way over the cold snow, sniffing \nfor \n&gt; food.
