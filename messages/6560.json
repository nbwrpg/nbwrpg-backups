Dark One was tilting his head back, trying \nto avoid Iron Raptor&#39;s jaws. Punch growls.\n\n&quot;Enough!&quot; he says, walking over to Pyro, who was holding Tavatron, &quot;You will \nstop struggling now, or your friend will die before she has the opportunity \nfor a good scream or two,&quot; he lowers his gun to press against Tavatron&#39;s \nneck, ready to pull the trigger.\n\nAs Punch was saying this, Dark One lifts his rifle, slamming it down as hard \nas he could at Iron Raptor&#39;s head.\n\n"}}
