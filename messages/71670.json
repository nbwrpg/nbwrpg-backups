She opens a com link to Tucson directly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, l=\r\nook, I think ya might have ta take leadership privileges\n&gt; &gt; away from Rodi=\r\nmus.  He&#39;s turned evil again.  And I don&#39;t think Nightshift or\n&gt; &gt; anyone e=\r\nlse is gonna trust him after this.

Tuscon can\n&gt; carry him or let him fly on his own, but =\r\ncaring for him as in trying\n&gt; to bind his injuries or something is not poss=\r\nible while in flight.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the =\r\ndamaged Fuzors and I will\n&gt; &gt; stand guard with them until help arrives.  In=\r\n the mean time, Rodimus has\n&gt; &gt; fallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;=\r\ns best if he is barred from\n&gt; &gt; leadership duties until further notice.  I =\r\ndon&#39;t like being this harsh, but\n&gt; &gt; right now he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell B=\r\nump to secure Nightlight in the med\n&gt; &gt; bay and put the Ark in immediate lo=\r\nckdown.
