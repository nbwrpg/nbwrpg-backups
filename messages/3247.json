She felt safe in his arms as they flew together.*\n*As they flew, she had to remind herself,*\n&quot;Now don&#39;t let your spark run away with you. Remember, your supposed to be \nmaking war, not love.&quot;\n*She felt her face plates flush a little.  She was starting to get mad at \nherself.  She was starting to like this bot whom she had just met.*\n\n*She told herself*\n&quot;Remember, you just met.  Don&#39;t loose your head.  Act yourself, be calm. And \nkeep in mind that your here to fight.  Your a fighter now no matter how you \nfeel about fighting.  So just grin and bear it and keep your head.&quot;\n\n*She wondered if other bots got into fights with themselves and lost.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n&gt;Arcangel/Tritan/Shocker/Firestorm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Arcangel: puts a blind fold on Ursa Major head over her optics and start to\n&gt;by picking her and flys out of the base with her in his arms toward the\n&gt;maximal base.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Tritan an shocker fly form there postion to Liono and ask him if they could\n&gt;join the maximals.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Firestorm:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;starts to fly to the crash sight.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
