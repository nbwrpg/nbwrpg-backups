He laughed, stumbling back as a third shot hits him in the \nchest.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Oblitercon growled, transforming into his HUMVEE mode and \ndriving at \n&gt; Necromancer, firing.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Koj&#39;s shot hit the outside of Pyro&#39;s cannon, leaving a dent in it. \nThe \n&gt; Alliance member yelled in rage, scorching the forest while trying\nto \nhit Koj \n&gt; with his flames.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scavanger yelled as a blade went halfway through his cannon. He \njumped back, \n&gt; transforming into bot mode and landing a few feet from the Maximal \nfemm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking a rocket launcher out of subspace, the bot fired it at \nTavatron, \n&gt; aiming for her feet.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Dark One and Firearm hovered a few dozen feet away from each other, \nboth of \n&gt; them having their weapons ready. The Alliance bot watched his \nopponent \n&gt; carefully, waiting for him to make the first mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm growled, his weapons ready as well. He glanced quickly at \nthe ground, \n&gt; seeing the seperate scirmishes beneath.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How about a deal?&quot; Firearm said, loudly enough for Dark One to \nhear. It was \n&gt; obvious to him that this bot had some authority, and he could see a \nway to \n&gt; limit the bloodshed, &quot;We fight right now. Just me and you. If I\nwin, \nyou \n&gt; leave these Maximals alone, if you win, we&#39;ll leave.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One considered the offer carefully, looking over the bigger\nbot \nin front \n&gt; of him. He was positive that he could take him. He had, after all, \ntaken on \n&gt; much bigger bots before. &quot;Agreed.&quot; he said, activating his comm as \nhe nods, \n&gt; sending a transmission to all the Oblitercons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold your fire,&quot; the transmission read, &quot;Me and the Maximal \ncommander here,&quot; \n&gt; he figured Firearm was the highest ranking Maximal, since he was\nthe \none that \n&gt; offered the duel, &quot;Are going to fight one on one. Untill then,\nthere \nwill be \n&gt; no further fighting, understood?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked back at Firearm, nodding. &quot;I&#39;m ready, Maximal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm grinned. &quot;Maximals,&quot; he said into his comm, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take \ntheir \n&gt; leader on a one-on-one. Whoever wins will be the winning faction of \nthis \n&gt; battle. It&#39;ll help limit the bloodshed. Hold your fire untill then, \nguys. \n&gt; This&#39;ll be over shortly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm turned back to Dark One, his sword ready. &quot;Well, shall we?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One laughed, firing a plasma rifle into the Maximal&#39;s chest. \nThe two \n&gt; bots flew toward each other, their swords clashing when they met...\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; The Oblitercons stopped firing as they got the transmision, holding \ntheir \n&gt; fire. Each one looked at their Maximal opponent, ready to fight in \ncase the \n&gt; Maximals didn&#39;t follow the agreement.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto&#39;s eyes widened as he recieved Firearm&#39;s transmission, the \nMaximal \n&gt; flying back a bit to give the two enemies space for battles.\n&gt; \n&gt; He hoped that Firearm knew what he was doing, a dead Maximal was\nnot \nthe \n&gt; greatest thing in the world to get out of this mission.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Prowl recieved Firearm&#39;s orders as he flew into the battle,\nfrowning \nas his \n&gt; computer reports the message to him. A duel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl shook his head, hovering in the air a few dozen feet behind \nthe two \n&gt; duelers. He wouldn&#39;t have trusted the Alliance with a one on one \nduel, but \n&gt; perhaps it was possible...\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl glanced at the ground, hoping that the Maximals would hold \ntheir fire.\n\n\n"}}
