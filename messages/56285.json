She contemplated however, about the 2 joining \nher. How in \n&gt; the world so many came with her, she didn&#39;t know. 1 was too many in \nher \n&gt; opinion. This personal mission she wished to keep secret. If the \nothers found \n&gt; out... then the future as well as the past would possibly be \ndestroyed. \n&gt; A terrible twist panged her lasercore. She couldn&#39;t allow that to \nhappen to \n&gt; the one she swore loyalty to many years ago. \n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing back at Blackstorm & Battera, she opened her com. &gt;&quot;I know \nyou were \n&gt; to stay with me, Blackstorm. However, if you go further than a \ncertain \n&gt; point.... even I will not allow it.&quot;&lt; She pondered a moment as she \nwished she \n&gt; had her form back at the thought of her destination. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Battera..
