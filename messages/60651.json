Is she generally this annoying?&quot; he \n&gt; asked.  \n&gt; &gt; He was trully interested, he wanted a good way to torture her \nback \n&gt; for what ever she had in mind fo him.  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague was not too far away.  Far enough to be out of sight, \n&gt; close enough to hear the conversation.  She fought the urge o run \nup \n&gt; behind him and pummel him, but she also just wanted to be around \n&gt; him.  A strange thought indeed for a Minion.  She pushed hat aside \n&gt; and began linking the sensors on Malice&#39;s body to a computer \npanel.  \n&gt; She intialized the connection and something bizarre happened.  \n&gt; Malice went rigid, emitted a pained groan, then completely shut \n&gt; down.  Hellplague ran in after she was recieving no info on \nMalice&#39;s \n&gt; body.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What happened?

She \nturned \n&gt; &gt; to Necross and splattercannon and told them to pull him to his \n&gt; feet \n&gt; &gt; as she lessened the gravity holding him down.  The males obeyed \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; pulled Malice up roughly.  The bounty hunter leaned against \n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon as the sudden climbing to his feet made him a \n&gt; little \n&gt; &gt; light headed.  He stood up straight and tried to look behind \nhim, \n&gt; &gt; because he couldn&#39;t see that mischevious Hellplague and that was \n&gt; &gt; cause for worry.  The Sweep commander shoo-ed away Necross and \n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon as she wrapped her arms around Malice&#39;s waist.   \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; males obeyed with hesitation, while Necross left the room \n&gt; entirely, \n&gt; &gt; Splattercannon took position by the door.  Malice looked at the \n&gt; arms \n&gt; &gt; around his waist and looked back at the femme biehind him.  It \nwas \n&gt; &gt; at this time he actually noticed, she was kinda pretty.  She \nlooked\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  like a Generation One Decepticon, only with no insignia.  But \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; though passed out of his mind as quickly as it entered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;&#39;Scuse me, but I fel I must tell you something.  I&#39;m taken.  \nA \n&gt; &gt; little Maxi down there is waiting on me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Minion did not speak, but walked around in front of \nMalice, \n&gt; &gt; her arms still around his waist.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well she&#39;s down there, and I&#39;m right here in front of you.  \n&gt; &gt; Besides, I can offer you more than that Maximal-&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Maxitron actually,&quot; the hunter corrected,&quot;it seems she was \n&gt; dumped \n&gt; &gt; here on accident while dealing with her universe&#39;s Unicron.&quot; he \n&gt; &gt; added with a grin.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Whatever.  It doesn&#39;t matter, my pet WILL come around and \n&gt; accept \n&gt; &gt; me.
