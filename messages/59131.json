Let me try to answer.\n\nBasically, we need to know where our storylines are going. Also, we \nneed to see what we can do to actually have more posts.\n\nI agree that we could use a different forum, but we don&#39;t have access \nto a board of our own. If anyone could help us for that, it would be \ngreat. So, since in game posting slows down a lot during the \nholidays, we thought that it might be a good thing to organize a RPG \ndiscussion period at that time.\n\nI hope this clears any uncertainties. If you have suggestions, feel \nfree to share them!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Uh, I just got here. But if I have a vote, what are the issues to \nbe \n&gt; discussed?  Personally, I&#39;d either post the issues and then go a \nchat \n&gt; room or message board and discuss them, or something else.  Posting \n&gt; seems slow as it is.
