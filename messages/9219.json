She was just another ignorant bot. She shook her \nmane and walked towards a field of green grass. There, she grazed for a \nshort while. From Quickstrike&#39;s mind, she found out what could be lurking in \nthe outside. She would have to break it to the sooner or later.\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Mon, 31 Jul 2000 00:21:29 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat:;\n&gt;\n&gt;Waited for Rowdy to reply.

Quickstrike? No\n&gt;way. Rowdy? He wouldn&#39;t go back to that cave would he?&quot;  She ran out\n&gt;and into the trees.  She tried searching for his scent.

So, this was going to be her new home. It looked rugged, and\n&gt;too unorganized to be Predacon worthy. What she didn&#39;t like was the\n&gt;thought of the little snake-bot being the leader of them. It just\n&gt;didn&#39;t settle down in her mind right. He had a harem, or those two\n&gt;females just favored him. She hoped they were because she wasn&#39;t\n&gt;going to be a part of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;She looked over and saw KitKat in the distance. She listened in. She\n&gt;was looking for Rowdy Wolf. She walked closer until she was close\n&gt;enough for her to reach her mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;You won&#39;t find him,&quot; she said to her. &quot;He is what your little snake-\n&gt;bot would have become.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
