You&#39;re ideas\ncould be worth considering, but the considering would be pointless because\nyou&#39;re ideas suck.  You think you&#39;re ideas are great and that you&#39;re\nawesome, well guess what?  You act like an immature 13-year old or\nsomething, because all you do is rant and rave and say stuff and continue to\nget on my nerves!  Man, if there wasn&#39;t any of those weird &quot;nice-guys&quot; such\nas rauq on the council, but instead me, you would soooooo have your ass\nkicked!  And now, the council is either going to act like the Corporate\nidiots called the McMahons and start lecturing me on how I shouldn&#39;t swear\nand crap and say the truth by saying your ideas suck, and/or you&#39;re going to\nreply to this with your monotonous whining...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Kyle Stewart&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 21, 2002 5:57 PM\nSubject: Re: Poll results for nbwrpg\n\n\n&gt; (mindless rant in 3....2...1...) DID YOU NOT READ IT\n&gt; OR ARE YOU JUST TO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND IT!  GOOD\n&gt; RPING WOULD EARN MORE POINTS THAN WINNING BATTLES (I\n&gt; noted making a char successfully act messed up in da&#39;\n&gt; head would get more points than winning a fight)\n&gt; WINNING BATTLES WOULDN&#39;T GET YOU NEARLY AS MANY POINTS\n&gt; YOU MORON!\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; a) impractical\n&gt; &gt; b) unfair\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not as simple as scoring a fight, for one thing\n&gt; &gt; someone would have to\n&gt; &gt; keep track of it and that person would have to be\n&gt; &gt; impartial.  No one here is\n&gt; &gt; impartial.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s unfair because there&#39;s more to RP&#39;ing than just\n&gt; &gt; fighting.  In fact one\n&gt; &gt; of the biggest complaints before the restart was\n&gt; &gt; that there were too many\n&gt; &gt; pointless battles.  To make it all about fighting\n&gt; &gt; would be a mistake.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and resubmit\n&gt; &gt; your idea to the council,\n&gt; &gt; I suggest you send it to the council.  Your idea has\n&gt; &gt; merit and might work if\n&gt; &gt; you can fix the flaws.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
