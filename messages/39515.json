However then next 15 struck something... not \nhim... but Hacha. For as the remaining blasts closed in on him he \nbrought the small bot to their direction letting them slam into the \nsmall robot...which probably isnt to good for him. Hellpeon then \nlaughs as he moves an arm over some of the holes and then moves them \naway as they begin to heal themselves.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;You got one good shot off on me... but at what cost? YOur \nlittle friend here?&quot;\n\nHellpeon smirked and held up the beaten for Of Hacha before he \nblasted the small bot towards Ultimo with a large blast of Chaochitan \nenergy. A moment later he flew at Ulimo himself and tried to Run him \nthrough with his sabre.\n\n\n"}}
