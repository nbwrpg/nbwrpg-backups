Rodimus is definitly\nnot doubting himself in this. He is pretty much back to his old self\nagain. However Tuscon is asking Rodimus to work with people who had\nonly recently did worse than kill him - they stripped him of his old\nidentity and made him into a monster and had him help try to destroy\nhis family and friends - some of which he actually did do. And worse\nthan that, he enjoyed it.\n\nThink about if someone did that to you personally. Caused you to turn\nagainst everything you knew, caused you to try to kill your family.\nAnd the change was so extreme that not only did you do it, but you\nfound yourself wanting to do it. Then you were rescued and woke up\nfrom it. Now someone is saying you have to work with those same poeple\nwho did that to you. Can you imagine the feelings you would have\ntrying to do that?\n\nTHAT is the test that Rodimus is working with, not self doubt.\n\nIt is fortunate that Rodimus working with Cyclonus who took no actual\npart in that effort.\n\nSo we can imagine this will be something they discuss later :)\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 8/11/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Everything checks out.  And Tucson&#39;s strategy is derived from a TF Cybertron\n&gt; episode where in order to defeat Unicron, Optimus and Galvatron realized\n&gt; they needed to team up to defeat him.  Till All Are One, was the theme of\n&gt; their. battle and thus Tucson has also come to a similar conclusion.  It\n&gt; appears insane but it was something that had to be done despite the concern\n&gt; and dislike of the strategy.  It wasn&#39;t an easy decision to make but Tucson\n&gt; showed a great courage in doing things off the beaten path.  It&#39;s very\n&gt; obvious that Rodimus is showing his weakness of self doubt which he&#39;s\n&gt; projecting off of Tucson, who will have no part of such negativity.  It&#39;s\n&gt; not that he hates Rodimus it&#39;s the fact that he knows Rodimus can overcome\n&gt; his apprehensions if he puts his mind to it.  So of course Tucson will sort\n&gt; of give him a swift nip at his backside in order to get his message across\n&gt; to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; But he too has a weakness, his beastly temper which he has had throughout\n&gt; his life.  The temper of a creature who&#39;s breath can melt mountains,\n&gt; supposedly.  The dragon was sort of Tucson&#39;s birth sign and it was no\n&gt; surprise that he would become one later on in life.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it appears the two Primes are at their greatest test.  They must both\n&gt; help each other to overcome a lack of self confidence and learn to do things\n&gt; off the beaten path and at the same time, learn to quell a temper who&#39;s\n&gt; effects could have highly destructive consequences.  Good thing Leo Prime\n&gt; came into the picture because as Rodimus and Tucson learn their hardest\n&gt; lessons he is there to keep things stable between the factions.\n&gt;\n&gt; So this is getting very interesting indeed.  It may take a while but\n&gt; eventually things will work out for everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 11, 2011, at 7:48 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OOC: He was passing beneath Waspinator, on his way toward the dinosaurs.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry about the mixup.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OOC: No problem.
