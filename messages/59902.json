He wanders \n&gt; &gt; outside of the base, searching for lava tubes or something.  \nAfter \n&gt; &gt; about a megacycle of wandering and searching, he finally found a \n&gt; &gt; basalt based lava flow and transformed.  He wadded about knee \ndeep \n&gt; &gt; and absorbed the heat so he would not melt or warp his legs.  He \n&gt; got \n&gt; &gt; a hand full of the heavy thick stuff, and drew the heat out, \n&gt; leaving \n&gt; &gt; a solid mass.  He then dipped it into the lava, pulled it out, \nand \n&gt; &gt; repeated the process until it was halfway up his chest after \n&gt; several \n&gt; &gt; megacycles.  He rolled it out of the lava stream and began to \nroll \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; back to the base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Two megacycles later, Malice finally rolled the crude sphere \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; ball into the base.  He rolled it into the cargo bay, and went to \n&gt; &gt; find Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey Wolfblade, I finished the sphere!
