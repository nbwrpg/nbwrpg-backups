Gatara reloads her double weapon and holds it pointed at the \nPred, forgoing the cloak to emphasize her point: &quot;Rogues don&#39;t play \naround, Predacon.  And if you&#39;re dealing with us alone, you do it on \nour terms; time is not a factor.  Why would you be so interested in \nsomeone who surrendered herself after you nearly died protecting \nher?  What makes her worth anything to YOU?&quot;\n\nThe other two flank the monstrous bot, as if she needs it to heighten \nher already imposing appearance.\n\nOOC: Gatara was the only Rogue of these three personally involved in \nthat encounter, so she&#39;s the only one Flicker will recognize.  \nHowever, he&#39;ll probably realize that Jayde and Riekan are nothing to \nsneeze at either.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Back at the base:\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  LOOK I DON&#39;T HAVE TIME TO PLAY AROUND!  I&#39;D\n&gt; SAY YOU&#39;D BE ABLE TO REPAIR, OR AT LEAST GET A GOOD\n&gt; START ON REPAIRING YOUR SHIP IF YOU TRADE WITH ME!
