She sat next to the now shielded hatch and \nlooked at the situation.  She could hear Megatron talking to some \nohter bot on the other side of the ship. megatron&#39;s voice carried \nwell.\nSo she had a choice, she could tell Megatron to try to talk to them \nabout releasing Quickstrike.  Or she could try to attempt to break in \nand save him on her own. She thought for a moment.  She could do both.\n\nShe ran around the ship until Megatron came into view.  She walked \ncalmly over to megatron and whispered to him, &quot;They have Quickstrike \nprisoner in the ship.  See if they will release him.&quot;  She then spoke \nin a louder voice so she knew she would be heard,&quot;I will return to \nthe base Commander. I need to use the CR chamber and then I shall \nreturn to your side. Oh great Commander Megatron.&quot; She curtsied, \nturned and walked away like she was heading for her base. \n\nShe walked through the trees, doubled back and went back to the hatch \nway.  She thought, if there was one hatch, surely there must be \nanother somewhere.  She started her recon around looking for another \nway in.\n\n\n"}}
