Threat level: 95%&quot;\nQuatro said data aloud.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Quatro grabbed a smoke bomb, and threw it over by Autofire\nand whoever was with him.  Then, Quatro quickly fired a plasma-wave\nfrom his gun in Autofire&#39;s direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Quatro opened his comm-link to all Maximals in and around CF.\n&gt;\n&gt;         &quot;I&#39;ve found some Decepticons hiding out here!&quot; Quatro\nshouted into it.\n&gt;\n&gt;          Quatro ran into the CF, ready to blast anything that\nentered, namely, Decepticons or Preds.\n\n\n"}}
