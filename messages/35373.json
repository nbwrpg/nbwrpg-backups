Upon coming to a mound of scraps the bot sits down on and\ngoes to kick a small piece out from the pile when all of a sudden the\nmound opens up reaveling a hole with a stiarway.  He looks into it and\ntransforms into his large bug monster mode and his infrared vision\ncomes on. He begins his long descent down into the secret chamber\nholding the Autobot&#39;s ship, the &#39;Hidden One&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
