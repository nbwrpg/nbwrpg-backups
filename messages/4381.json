She was starting to like \nhim.  And yet she knew that she never had a chance.  She thought of \nScorponok.  She liked him too.  But same thing, there were other female bots \naround that they must have liked more than her.\nShe smiled at Quickstrike. It was a small and almost shy smile. She wanted \nher commanders happy with her and her work.\n&quot;If it pleases you commander, please take a look at the tunnel.  I hope you \nlike it.  I did everything I could think of to make it invisible from the \noutside. An it is sturdy.  We can take many blasts and it won&#39;t collapse.&quot;\nShe got up and walked to the escape tunnel.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
