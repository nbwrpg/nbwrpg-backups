She felt the \nship move again. She wanted to know what was going on. She \ntransformed into cobra mode and slithered her way to the bridge.\nShe heard the transmission staing that all bots not busy need to \nreport to Zardus for digging assignments. She frowned, &quot;I&#39;m not a \nworking drone.&quot; She muttered to herself. She slithers along and \nslithered onto the bridge.\n\nSquizzy::\nShe woke up and opened the chamber door. She stood just outside of \nthe door when she felt the floor move. She hung onto the CR door and \nlooked around. She was in the lab. There were two bots under black \nsheets, laying on two tables. She wondered where she was and what was \ngoing on.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any real problem with Cybershark moving far, but I do \n&gt; have a bot chasing him and its a bit not fair.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Demolition/Havoc/Repressor/DevilDuer/Reptilica/Bloodystrike\n::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks at the hole that had been dug, nodding in aprooval. \nThe \n&gt; work drones combined with \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent,&quot; he says, activating his comm-link, &quot;All bots step \nback, \n&gt; the Alliance base is coming back in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The shuttles carrying the Alliance base begin to move closer \n&gt; together. The Alliance base will need to be connected in the air \nand \n&gt; then lowered.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Alliance commander looks down at his wrist comp, studying the \n&gt; scanning reports he had noticed earlier. The Predacons were \n&gt; definitely doing something...\n&gt; \n&gt; The Predacons in that base were not his allies. Zardus&#39; eyes narrow \n&gt; as he sees the spark signatures of Megatron and Hell Beast. He \npushes \n&gt; a few buttons, opening a channel to the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maximals,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;The Predacon base is displaying \n&gt; some activity that you might want to check. It could have something \n&gt; to do with you, I suggest you check it out. Megatron and Hell Beast \n&gt; are involved.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He ends the transmission, opening his comm to the Alliance again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oblitercons, WarMachines, Chosen Ones, Dark One, Flesh Ripper, \nDark \n&gt; Claw, Scattershot, Sixshot, Ares,&quot; he looks across the island, \nseeing \n&gt; the four Predacons, &quot;And you four, report to me, I have a mission \nfor \n&gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A plan was forming in his mind. If the Maximals supported him in \n&gt; this, and pronably even if they didn&#39;t, he could take out an enemy \n&gt; Predacon base.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demolition exits the Iron Fist, having put Zergling in a CR \nchamber, \n&gt; set it to put him into stasis lock, locked it, and ordered the \n&gt; autoguns to take him out if he emerged.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You wanted to see me?&quot; he says, walking toward Zardus.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc swears as he looses Cybershark&#39;s signature, turning around \nand \n&gt; recieving Zardus&#39; transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going full speed, he sets off for the Iron Fist.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer frowns. &quot;Hmm.. We don-AAAHH!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He&#39;s thrown to his feet again as the shuttles begin to unite the \n&gt; Alliance base in midair, the floor shaking more then ever.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m gonna give Zardus a piece of my mind after this!!&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica sighs, getitng to his feet, Bloodystrike doing the same \n&gt; right next to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I guess we&#39;re movi-AAAHH!!&quot; both bots are thrown to the floor \nagain, \n&gt; Bloodystrike sliding down the hallway as the Alliance base shakes \n&gt; again.\n\n\n"}}
