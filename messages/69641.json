There was nothing that did n=\r\not ache or throb.  Yet, he makes no groans or expression of his agony.  He =\r\nmerely sighs heavilly to try and catch his breath.  He came to the realizat=\r\nion that if he is going to get out of his predicament in one piece he would=\r\n have to try a move that no one would ever dream he would try.  But Hydras =\r\nand the others have seemed to have caught onto him, including Zarak.  He ha=\r\nd already scanned him and found his schematics out.  Now, they wanted to qu=\r\nestion him.  Though battered and dented and in a state of disrepair, the th=\r\nought of them trying to get him to answer their questions so that they coul=\r\nd use him for their own evil gain, that was definitely not going to fly wit=\r\nh him.\n\nThrough all his damages, he finds himself still able to get on his =\r\nknees to assume a transforming position, and then painfully transforms into=\r\n his SUV mode. \n\n&quot; You - forgot - something.  My - engine - is still - in t=\r\nact.&quot; \n\nHe puts himself into drive and screeches his back tires, now daring=\r\n to make a move on wheels.  Smoke from  his duel exhaust system fills the r=\r\noom and even though it was painful to roll his tires, he keeps at it, to tr=\r\ny and fill the room with a bit of a smoke screen.  He was adept in these co=\r\nnditions because he couldn&#39;t see anything anyway. Before moving he makes su=\r\nre he fills the room with enough smoke to cloud things a bit.  He had to ma=\r\nke his move, because his energy reserves would not last him much longer. Hi=\r\ns energon level drops dangerously low, yet he knew that maybe with what lit=\r\ntle he had left, he could get out of there and hopefully gain a bit of grou=\r\nnd away from the tower.  He uses his sonar systems to navigate around Rodim=\r\nus,Scourge and Cyclonus, desperately looking for a way out.  But at the sam=\r\ne time, he picks up another familliar signature.  Nightlight.  He comes to =\r\na screeching halt.  And now, finds that there is not enough fuel to get him=\r\nself out of the tower.  He would have to remain where he was.  And in his p=\r\nresent SUV mode.  \n\n&quot;N - Night - Nightlight...  Here....&quot;  \n\nHis engine shu=\r\nts down.  Clearly there was not enough energy to make his escape, and he ha=\r\nd not the heart to leave a comrade behind.  No matter if it were a Maximal =\r\nor an Autobot.  His headlights dim, as his body now goes off line due to en=\r\nergy exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras frowned and he without mercy trow awayTucson and st=\r\narted to beat him savagely while with his multiple heads were bitting him t=\r\noo.
