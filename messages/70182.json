She started to feel tired, unexplained tired,\n&gt; as if she handt slept in several days. she had to hold a piper in order to\n&gt; avoid fell but he couldnt be stand up for so long. A chorus of voices arouse\n&gt; in her head while her vision became blurry. She couldnt fight that feeling\n&gt; for so long.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup emerged from a corritor holding his dart gun looking to Nightlight and\n&gt; later to Rodimus said in low voice &quot;Forgive me... i beg your fogiveness but\n&gt; i cant let her escape... Time is short... She will sleep a while... we can\n&gt; reprogram her... and then she will understand all... &quot;\n\nRodiums looked as the woman he loved slumped over. He reached down and\ngrabbed her before she hit the ground, and gently lifted her in his\narms, the movement seemingly effortless as he looked over at Kup.\n\nNoting the weapon Kup had was not a blaster but a stun gun, and\nremembering the strange way Nightlight had acted he though that this\nmight had been the best way. But he couldn&#39;t help but feel a stab of\nanger as he glanced down at Nightlight as she lay unconscious in his\narms.\n\nAs Kup took left to help Tuscon, Rodimus followed as it was also in\nthe direction that led out of this place. Rodimus couldn&#39;t ever\nremember wanting to leave place so bad as he wanted to leave this\nblack fortress of Hydras&#39;!\n\n(TBC)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
