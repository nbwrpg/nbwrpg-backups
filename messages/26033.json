Yay!!! LOL Well there was no chance I \nwasn&#39;t gonna make it out.. but when they put the injections in, Mum \nsure thought so.. *wince, but laughs at her Mum* I thought she was \nmore scared about it than I was. 7 injections in the right ear and \nabout 5 in the other.. *sigh*\n\nBut the numbing stuff (anisthetic.. spelling mistake, I&#39;m sure of it) \nis still working, so I&#39;m in a good mood. Apart from the fact that my \nbandage looks like an onion wrapped around my head.. without the \npointy bit at the top *_* And it&#39;ll be there for the next week. WAH!!\n\nThanks to Zardus, Carnage, Soulstice and Airshadow for wishing me \nwell *_*\n\nOkay.. so.. talk to ya later!\n\n\nSteph F.
