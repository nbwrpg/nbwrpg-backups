If so, they act as if they are \nprogrammed to be Predatrons.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice scoffed and turned to Windlord.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to find some energon.  If Kup comes looking for me or \nneeds me, tell him just outside the base entrance.&quot;\n&gt; He then marched past them both, his tail trailing behind him.  Sure \nenough, he detected a raw energon deposit.  It was buried in the \nrock, so Malice crushed the stone barrier.  Once he was finished, he \nbeheld a extremly high density deposit of energon.  It would soon \nkill any Maximal or Predacon, but Malice was differant all together.  \nHis endurance and fuel efficentcy was superior to most.  He started \ntearing hunks of crystallized energon and stuffed them in his mouth, \ncrunching them and swallowing before another handful filled his \nmouth.  He ate for ten straight minutes, before slowing down, and \nfive minutes later he was pulling large, whole shards to take back to \nhis quarters.  He carried the armful of toxic stuff into his chamber \nand put them in an upright storage locker.  He left his quarters and \nsought out Kup again.  He found him, still in the Cr room.  There was \ntension in the place as Malice picked out the lone Predacon and \nslowly approached him. \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; WOlfBlade. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you always this rude and impolite with those who are to be \nyour \n&gt; allies. If so, you show incredible lack of manner for one trying to \n&gt; show how superior they are. Anyway, Yes, I know how to defeat him. \n&gt; Myself and the Maxitrons have deafed him many times. He&#39;s tough, \nyes, \n&gt; hard to take down, yes, and very adaptive. We have not been able to \n&gt; take him down the same way twice. BUt he&#39;s not some \nsupertranformer. \n&gt; He&#39;s only 200 yards tall. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s as big as a planet. \nHe&#39;s \n&gt; just a pain n the tail. That&#39;s it.&quot;  She glared at Malice. &quot;And by \n&gt; the way, I&#39;ve never said I beat him completely on my own. But I&#39;ve \n&gt; fought him enough to were it would only take ten of us and not the \n&gt; whole base. WE would adapt to. I mean, sure he was evolving as \nwell, \n&gt; but he&#39;s not the smartest thing in the universe. He&#39;s too self \n&gt; centered to think bout how to really grow in intelegence. Oh, and \n&gt; Malice, the next time you decide to insult someone, please \nremember, \n&gt; they may be the one watching your back when you most need it. I \n&gt; already learned that lesson.&quot;  She looked at Windlord. &quot;Well, let&#39;s \n&gt; go inside. I&#39;m starved. Please lead the way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
