We are not from this \nera. We come from many centuries after the tenth great war. We \nAngelions are the children of both Maximals and Predacons. \nTransformers from our time live in peace and harmony altogether. \nHowever, since the discovery of transwarp technology, time has been \naltered. This whole war IS a disruption of its own.\nAs for our weapons... they are inside us, parts of us like bones or \nveins. We demand that you trust us that we will not use them. Should \nthis be a trap, however, it would be an illogical one. We are only \ntwo, and all the factions here are more than enough to obliterate us.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramiel made another call for the conference.\n\nRamiel:\nTo all factions, we are Angelions. We are organizing a conference, \nand we need one unarmed representant of each faction to join us.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Liono::\n&gt; Liono eyes grow wide as he thinks for a moment. &quot;Your here about \nthe time \n&gt; disruptions?&quot; Liono&#39;s tone changes and grows a little more \noffensive as he \n&gt; uncross his arms. &quot;I&#39;m Liono guardian of the Ark and one of three \nMatrix \n&gt; masters. Cybertron should be grateful that they haven&#39;t suffered \nanymore \n&gt; than they have. The Maximals squabble like perpetual children and \nare sorely \n&gt; out numbers if you want to help join them.&quot; Liono touches his \nbraces and \n&gt; feels the surge of power. &quot;How do I know your not armed or setting \nsome trap \n&gt; after all your not maximals so your word is worthless and honor is \njust as \n&gt; fleeting as a spring rain.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at \nhttp://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
