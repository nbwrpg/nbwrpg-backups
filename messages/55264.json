Perceptor&#39;s message bellowed \nand he saw the anger in Rodimus&#39;s eyes..&quot;Yes Prime do it use your anger I love \nit!&quot; As Rodimus lept off at incredible speed He shot fire from his mouth,the \ntwo tails lashing out toslice open the bot, his eyes shot out the lasers and \nhis shoulder blasters rang out 15 shots all right onto the coming Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I hope you dont mind a little CC. I posted for a little damage to Hydras, \n&gt; but nothing critical.\n&gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; Rodimus brought his arms down in a &quot;x&quot; formation, forcing the swords, and \n&gt; Hydras&#39; arms down. Rodimus then grabbed Hydras around the wrist with his left \n&gt; hand. He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, down into Hydras&#39; \n&gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs up to double \n&gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to his feet.\n&gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.\n&gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had been lost. \n&gt; But then...\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in cold fluid!\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, while letting \n&gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost fomeing at the \n&gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger causes his &gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His gaze locked on Hydras.\n&gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech fluids from \n&gt; his mouth at Hydras.\n&gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!\n&gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets. Full power all \n&gt; at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an airborn 300mph!\n&gt; : : Kup : :\n&gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...\n&gt; Kup: Give her here...\n&gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a picture on all of \n&gt; the monitors.\n&gt; Kup: By primus no... How could they?! She was a mother, a good bot, she didn&#39;t \n&gt; deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...\n&gt; Kup drops to the floor.\n&gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. Her father is the \n&gt; commander, and she just lost her mother...\n&gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.\n&gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader is gone, and a &gt; killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty those Predacons now, for what \n&gt; Rodimus will do to them. May primus have pitty on their sparks...\n&gt; OOC: I hope I really showed the emotion I meant to in this post. The hatred, the \n&gt; sarrow, all of it.\n&gt;  airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;To all maxiamls, and specially to you...

Soon \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; program was downloaded; her memories, ereased; Perceptor knew \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals could try to reprogram her so he dowloaded too a special \n&gt; &gt; &gt; program that would active when Maximals attemp to reprogram \n&gt; her... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This program had the objective to destroy the spark.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor opened his com link with Hydras &quot;Master Hydras, it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done...
