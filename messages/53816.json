It was that of a female, but the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figure seemed to belie the possibility of anything but fear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Darkangel : : &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkangel was paying attention to the computer and did not&lt;BR&gt;notice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the movement in the pod. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suddenly the wave from the new bot struck, and Darkangel&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eyes grew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wide and bright. He seemed to start sweating immediatly. His hands&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to his head, and it became obvious he was in pain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkangel: Ahhhhh! What the hell is wrong with me?! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bat bot fell to the ground in stasis. The wave had&lt;BR&gt;knocked him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; out. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;Inside&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pod, something began to move. The file had not been totally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uploaded, but it was not an essential part. The protoform&lt;BR&gt;was now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fully awake and knew what was happening around.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More out of instinct than by real malevolence, it sent a wave of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distress on Darkangel&#39;s mind. It could freeze him in place and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; leave&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him shaking, but the effects were variable depending on many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; factors.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, it was a disturbing sensation that would likely&lt;BR&gt;leave him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Darkangel : : &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He recieved the comm message from Tyrael, and opened a return&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; channel. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkangel: Understood. I&#39;ll begin work on this right away. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkangel got the pod he had returned with ans set it up in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a lab,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connected to the computer system. First he got the black&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; canister and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unloaded it&#39;s contents into the pod, so it would be part of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protoform. That was easy. Now Darkangel was at the keyboards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; running&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through millions of files looking for the correct one. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally after about ten minutes he found Burrock.dna on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He selected the file and began to upload it into the pod. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; computer&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said it would take twenty minutes to complete the upload. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darkangel: Ok, I guess I&#39;ll be here for a while... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tyrael&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opened a frequency with Darkangel.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: Darkangel, this is Tyrael. I want you to create&lt;BR&gt;this new&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bot I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was talking about, since I can&#39;t be there right now. Go into&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the lab&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a blank stasis pod and download the Burrock.DNA file&lt;BR&gt;in it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Then,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include the black canister to its composition.
