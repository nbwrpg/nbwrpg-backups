Being an Au=\r\ntobot, he couldn&#39;t resist the urge to help someone in need. He kneels down,=\r\n yet cautiously looks around before doing anything, and also remembering th=\r\nat it was not wise to move an injured person, especially if they had any un=\r\nknown fractures. His Sonar equipment scans the figure for fractures and inj=\r\nuries.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmmm... Strange.. I better stay with this person to see if I ge=\r\nt any signs of life.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He rides the rail car, never leaving the figure&#39;s=\r\n side.\n\nAs Tuscon get&#39;s close to the figure it began to stir. Tuscon&#39;s scan=\r\ns\nshow light damage to the figure&#39;s systems, but that its repair systems\nha=\r\nve been taxed hard, evidently it had been much more heavily damaged\nbut sel=\r\nf repair circuits had brought it back to a more balanced state.\n\nThe figure=\r\n began to stir, perhaps its proximate sensors were reacting\nto Tuscon&#39;s pre=\r\nsence. The figure looked to be an older male, perhaps\nwith some sort of gro=\r\nund based vehicular form based on its shape and\nconfiguarion.\n\nThe figure s=\r\nuddenly sat up and slid into a corner, &quot;Who are you?&quot; he\nsaid in a raspy bu=\r\nt definitly male voice. The hum of a laser gun could\nbe heard as he pulled =\r\na weapon out and aimed it at Tuscon, &quot;Get back,\nor I will fire!&quot;\n\nOutside t=\r\nhe sounds of metal on metal could be heard as the creatures\nstill seemed to=\r\n be active somewhere outside the Magna-railcar as the\ncar itself still made=\r\n its way along its track.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
