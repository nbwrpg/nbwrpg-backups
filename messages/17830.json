The trainers hit you with a mind-\ncontroll chip. You have been serving them for a little while. Ramulus \nmade a counter chip, and shot it into you. It should have fried the \nTrainer one, but it might not have. They&#39;re all still at the battle.&quot;\n\nHe looks her over, &quot;We&#39;re going to have to get that chip out of you. \nDo you mind coming with me to the Cybertronian Fire?&quot;\n\nSmokescreen turns his head, the sound of footsteps announcing \nFirearm&#39;s arrival a few seconds before the Maximal walks in. Firearm \nwalks over to the CR chamber and puts BlueStreak in.\n\n&quot;The Trainers left,&quot; Firearm says to Smokescreen, glancing at Spears, \n&quot;Striker looks like he&#39;s been reprogrammed. He nearly killed Ramulus, \nhit BlueStreak pretty hard, and killed a Maximal femm. The weapon \nRamulus got us didn&#39;t do anything against him, so he isn&#39;t chipped. \nHe left with the Trainers, so we didn&#39;t get him.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Spears::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Smokescreen,&quot;yeah, I think so. what happened? last \n&gt; thing I remember was fighing with Striker and the others against \nsome \n&gt; jerks who called thenselves the Trainers. Did I get hit or \nsomething? \n&gt; I don&#39;t remember getting hit?&quot; She put her hands on her head as she \n&gt; felt a little power surge, but it quickly faded.\n&gt; &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;\n&gt; She slowly stepped out of the CR chamber.  She noticed he had his \n&gt; hand on his gun.&quot;What? You think I&#39;m going to attack or something?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
