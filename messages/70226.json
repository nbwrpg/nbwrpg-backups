We&#39;re in a bit of a bind, I&#39;ve lost my visual capability and I&#39;m w=\r\nithout my sonar equipment.  But I&#39;m not completely helpless.  We need an es=\r\ncape route but I can feel a down draft of air coming inside here..  Not sur=\r\ne where it&#39;s from, I&#39;m trying to determine that right now.  Will update you=\r\n soon, Tucson Prime Signing off.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, on a stasis berth, a ti=\r\nny Autobot Femme begins to stirr from what appears to be quite a long nap. =\r\n She takes a deep breath in, and slowly opens her big blue optics.  She too=\r\n, can hear Lord Perseus&#39;s voice and tries to reply as best she can.\n\n&quot;Lord =\r\nPerseus....  Huh?  Wha?  I&#39;m - in the Ark...  How&#39;d - I get here?  Last thi=\r\nng - I remember ... Tucson..  Ohh no, Tucson!&quot;\n\nShe tries to get to her fee=\r\nt, and stumbles onto the floor on her knees.\n\n&quot;Gotta - find Tucson!  He - n=\r\needs me.&quot;\n\nShe wanders out of the stasis quarters, and slowly makes her way=\r\n into the main lobby of the Ark, where she finds Lord Elder, and Elita.  Sh=\r\ne can barely keep on her feet, and uses a door way to keep herself upright.=\r\n  She quickly recognizes both Lord Elder and Elita and slowly shuffles over=\r\n to them, but realizes she is still in much need of recovery and Energon.  =\r\nHer nap was long, and her legs had forgotten how to carry her.  She gets to=\r\n Lord Elder, and collapses to her knees once again.\n\n&quot;S&#39;cuse me.  I&#39;m sorry=\r\n, I - was trying to - see if Tucson was here.  Last - thing I remember.. A =\r\n- blast from behind, and then, nothing. I - heard a voice from Lord Perseus=\r\n..  That&#39;s - what got me out of stasis. &quot; \n\nSlowly she remembers what her l=\r\negs are for and stands up on them.\n\n&quot; Lord Elder, maybe you - know where Tu=\r\ncson is.  I - gotta find him, make sure he&#39;s - in one piece, ya know?  Afte=\r\nr all, he&#39;s kinda, sorta my big brother, can&#39;t abandon my only family membe=\r\nr can I?&quot;\n\nSlowly she regains her perky personality.  She checks over her a=\r\nrrows and forearm darts.\n\n&quot;And if I ever set eyes on any of those Decepticr=\r\neeps, I&#39;m gonna do more than just shove a few arrows up their afts, I&#39;ll st=\r\nick a few up their afterburners too for good measure!&quot;\n\nHer eyes glow brigh=\r\nt blue with recovered resentfulness toward the enemy.  \n\n&quot;Hmph, especially =\r\nScorponok, he deserves it the most. Oooh I hate that overgrown arachnid!&quot;\n\n=\r\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC:  I&#39;v=\r\ne been away a while, but I&#39;ve skimmed over what&#39;s happened.
