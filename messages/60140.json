It was really a fighter with a long range booster.  It \ncame online and accessed the booster&#39;s long range sensors.  It \ndetected several things: multiple bases planet side, and the looming \nUnicron in high orbit.  The craft banke, and made way for the far \nside of the planet, away from Unicron.  It skimmed across the \natmosphere and then entered the atmosphere.  It was going to come \ndown somewhee between all the bases.  After re-entry, the booster \nsection jetisoned and the fighter spread its wings and touched off \nthe engines.  It was then it detected the signal it was looking \nfor.  It was coming fom a base with many Maximal signatures.\n&gt; &lt;I have found him!  At long last, I found him!&gt;\n&gt; It altered course and bee- lined for the Maximal base.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into \ndamnation.  May God have mercy, for I have none.
