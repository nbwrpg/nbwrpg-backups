He&#39;ll confirm it whenever Hotmail starts working \nagain.\n\nThis is Carnage from this point on:\n\n\n** Dinobot growled as Tavatron approached him and the small ball of \nfur on his nose, knowing that she was trying to help him but not \nquite wanting anyone near him at the moment. Glaring at the fembot as \nhe stood there and watched her hand come closer and closer to the \nblack ball of lint.\nFor some unexplainable reason Tavatron&#39;s sudden apology heightened \nhis aggression and his eyes turned into slits. This was pathetic! \nSince when had he needed the help of others in a foolish situation \nsuch as this? It was...absurd! A grown man such as himself with a \nhistory of bloodshed, seeming helpless just because a black ball from \nHell landed on his snout! \nWhat foolishness!     However, Dinobot remained where he was as \nTavatron leaned close and the small creature decided to use her nose \nas a target, the female jumping back and whimpering quietly in alarm.\nDinobot only snarled and rolled his eyes, getting sick of the little \ngame, which this creature was deciding to play with the both of them. \nThinking and wondering if it had any clue that it would be nothing \nbut stray whips of fuzz on the wind if he ever got his transmetal \nclaws on it. It was already stamped DEAD as far as he was \nconcerned.    Dinobot jerked his head towards Tavatron as she tore \nher staff from sub-space, wondering if she was going to take some \nsort of revenge upon the ball-o-fuzz resting comfortably upon his \nmost highly reflective snout. However, was not eager to see if his \nthoughts were false...or her aim. There was one fact, which Tavatron \nwould have to catch up upon before she so much of moved a metallic \nmuscle, and that was that if she hit him instead of the cat she would \nhave a pair of transmetal fangs to try and pry off of her throat. She \nwas indeed his friend, yes...but no bot hit him and got away with it.\nDinobot snarled in response to her telling of him to remain still, \nshaking his head to try and rid himself of the creature before moving \nit down and reaching towards it with his own claws. If it tried to \nswat him, he would simply squish it, then peel it off of his snout. \nWhich suited him just as well.**\n\n\n\n"}}
