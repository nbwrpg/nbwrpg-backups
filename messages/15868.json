He peered in \nthe hole.\n\n&quot;Ah, you are awake! And I should have remembered to pull out your \ntransformation circuts. You would&#39;ve have gotten out of your chains. \nI hope you like my new army member. Isn&#39;t she just precious? \nFortunatly for you yo won&#39;t have to stay here long, unless my pan \ngoes ill. If it does than you stay forever. Spears has already told \nme the answer to this question, but maybe she is low ranking and \ndoesn&#39;t know the real answer. So I will ask you, and if you do not \ngive me the correct answer I will terminate Spears. Who is the \nMaximal leader?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\n&quot;Alright, nic job Ramulus! But here we go...coming in back to \nEarth!!!&quot;\n\nBrix was able to pull the bottom up at the last second, letting the \nshuttle hit the ground evenly. I tall shook, neraly throwing the two \nsoldiers out of their chairs. It went along the ground for a bit \nuntil finaly stopping just infront of the group. Brix Fliq and \nRamulus had returned to Earth! Brix and Fliq got out of the shuttle \nto greet the group.\n\n&quot;Hey guys! We come bearing new computer boards and new hull. So \nwhat&#39;s this problem we have?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
