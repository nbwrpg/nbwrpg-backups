Anyway, here it is:\n\nWith my school year drawing to a close, I&#39;m considering coming back \nfor the summer. I have a suggestion though for a new faction (please \nnote, this will for a while at least be a one man faction). I need \ncouncil approval though, and to know how much they can do. Here it \nis: \n\nAll these being have some ability to predict the future, they \nincrease this by stealing the &quot;hero/villan potential&quot; from various \nsubjects who had the potential to be heros/villans (also killing the \nsubjects, but you have to immobilize them for a few minutes). \n\nTheir leader is named Seer. He supposedly cannot die, but he never \ncome to earth so he&#39;s a none factor. All his minions are required to \ngive some of their stolen hero/villan potential to him, and he has \nincredible power, he also gives each of his servants a prophesy \ntelling some detail of their deaths to help delay it. \n\nThe reason they send their minions to earth (only one at a time, \nwhich is why it&#39;s one man, they don&#39;t want to do to much damage), is \nbecause over millions of years the change caused by someone with \neven a small bit of hero/villan potential is incredible, so the \npotential they can steal is almost limitless. They give their \nservants a target before sending them back. \n\nI haven&#39;t thought out all the details, but the first minion would be \nnamed Fortuneteller (a female), and her prophesy would be: \n\nSo long as you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will take your \nlife (so long as you give Seer his fair share of the potential you \nsteal no transmetal will kill you). \n\nHe also has a council of three other powerful members of his \nfaction, who will die, but share a prophecy of their death: \n\nOne will die by fire, one by ice, and the last must perish thrice \n(essentially one will die, but his/her spark will return to Seer for \na new body, after which one will die by fire, then the first will \ndie again, but the same thing will happen, then one will die by ice, \nthen the first will die and stay dead, but they don&#39;t know which is \nwhich and won&#39;t chance it putting themselves in danger). \n\nSo I want to know how much prescience I&#39;m allowed? How can that \neffect the game? And is it o.k. to dictate how my characters can die \n(they can still have the crap beaten out of them, but they can&#39;t be \ndestroyed any other way).\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I would like to draw attention to the message board, and the \n&gt; message \n&gt; &gt; I posted there at least a week ago.\n\n\n"}}
