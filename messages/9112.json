He was out looking for \nanswers or trouble which ever came first.The wolf left scanner range \nand continued. he thought he was going north by northeast, but he \nwasn&#39;t sure. he&#39;d find a place to hold up until dark, then work his \nway from there.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine decided that it was long past time to handle things, he \n&gt; didn&#39;t know what things, he just knew that when the time came he&#39;d \n&gt; know. He walked to the exit checking the logs. Prowl was missing, \n&gt; Striker was at the Cybertronian Fire, Ramhorn was in critical \n&gt; condition, Ramulus was checked out with Spears, and Kluster was at \n&gt; the Fire too. This place was losing leaders like a cockroach loses \n&gt; shells. &quot;This is Lunarpine logging out for a while, I&#39;ll be back \nwhen \n&gt; it&#39;s time to be back.&quot; He transformed to wolf mode and began to run \n&gt; off. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Shadow Wing&#39; I&#39;m comeing back, I promised to \n&gt; protect your spark, so I&#39;ll return for that promise.&quot; He thought, \n&gt; this time making sure he wasn&#39;t speaking out loud.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Out of the engine room walked the Grey and White bot, Lunarpine \n&gt; went \n&gt; &gt; to check on Ramhorn, still in the stasis pod looking dead, &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; should&#39;ve been here sooner my friend, can you forgive me for my \n&gt; &gt; mistake?&quot; the bot in the CR chamber didn&#39;t move. &quot;If you can hear \n&gt; me, \n&gt; &gt; speak up, yell at me, climb out and hit me, just show me you&#39;ll \nbe \n&gt; &gt; alright.&quot; Again it didn&#39;t move. &quot;Damn it Ramhorn, Damn it all to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; pit, do something.&quot; Lunarpine punched the wall near the CR \nchamber, \n&gt; &gt; turns and walks out of the room with his head held low.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She perched high up in a tree.  She looked out and saw the \n&gt; &gt; expansion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the forest open up in front of her.  She wondered how she \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine would ever make things work.  One minute, they were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; laughing and having fun.  And the next, trying to bite each \n&gt; other&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heads off.  She knew that in the wild, wolves and owls mated \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; life.  But how one Cybertron would she make things work for her \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine, she had no idea.  She looked and saw the clouds \nmoving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly across the sky.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She looked down and saw a rabbit hopping long the forest floor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She shook her head, she wasn&#39;t in the mood to hunt. She knew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine needed to be in the company of other wolves.  She \ntoo, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; longed for the company of other owls.  She was willing to give \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up for him.  But she knew that he would never give up being a \n&gt; wolf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for her.  She would have to learn to just accept things as they \n&gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not what she wished they would be.  She felt, somewhere in her \n&gt; &gt; spark, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that someday she might have to give up and let her wild wolf go \n&gt; &gt; free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She somehow knew that that day would eventually come.  She let \na \n&gt; &gt; tear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; roll off her cheek and down her beak.  &quot;Wolves belong in the \nwild \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need to be free. If need be, I&#39;ll give you that freedom \n&gt; Lunarpine.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she said to herself.\n\n\n"}}
