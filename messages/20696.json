Nothing would\nstop him from finding her, He&#39;d travelled to far and worked to hard to bring\nher back to let her succome to a virus. The bloodstains in the snow were\ngetting larger. Her wounds had opened worse. The half wolf was determined to\nreturn her to Veratis&#39; base without any harm.\n\nMeanwhile Foxfingers flew across the sea to the country where they&#39;d landed.\nHe was far enough away from Predacon territory to risk a transmission.\n&quot;Foxfingers to home, I&#39;m on my way back with lots of goodies.&quot; His\nhoverboard switched into high gear as he streaked across the water.\n\nVeratis heard the transmission and replied in kind. &quot;Where the underworld\nhave you been? You should have been back long ago.&quot; He hesitated to deliver\nthe bad news to him, Things were falling apart before his very eyes, The\nvirus was loose, Lunarpine still hadn&#39;t found Ice and Lady Hawk still hadn&#39;t\nreturned. The bleak news echoed through his memory like a chiming bell.\nThings just couldn&#39;t get much worse.\n\nFoxfingers slowed down when he heard the news. He remembered the tracking\ndevice on his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve accompanied me far enough Preds.&quot; He flew\nlow and dropped it on the icy beach. The tracking device still functioned,\nThe Predacons could track him this far, and he wasn&#39;t worried about anything\nelse.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 13, 2000 6:47 AM\nSubject: Re: Ice\n\n\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt;\n&gt; She drifted in and out of consiousness. She lay on her side, feeling\n&gt; the soft snow fall onto her white fur. She starting to feel cold, for\n&gt; the first time.  She had lost a lot of blood and was now feeiling the\n&gt; effects of it. She could see her breath in the cold air.\n&gt;\n&gt; She then thought she caught a scent on the wind. It reminded her of\n&gt; Lunarpine. But she thought her tired mind was playing tricks on her.\n&gt; She closed her eyes and fell unconsious in the snow. Just on the\n&gt; other side of the ice field.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine pressed on through the snow and ice, he found a fresh\n&gt; trail of\n&gt; &gt; blood on the ground. He picked up Ice&#39;s scent and continued\n&gt; forward. He came\n&gt; &gt; upon what appeared to be a frozen river. he could see a hole in it.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; feared the worst, if she fell in it could spread the virus even\n&gt; faster. He\n&gt; &gt; contacted Veratis hoping the old bot would put his fears to rest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;No sign of the virus in the water.&quot; Veratis said with a sigh of\n&gt; relief.\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;d lost her on his scanners but could still give Lunarpine a\n&gt; direction to\n&gt; &gt; head in in order to find her and bring her back.He hoped she was\n&gt; only a\n&gt; &gt; carrier and not a victim. Veratis knew that Lunarpines body was\n&gt; immune to\n&gt; &gt; the virus, unless it had mutated inside Ice.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine was relieved at the close call, he again transformed,\n&gt; this time\n&gt; &gt; into his half wolf stage and began moving. He&#39;d lost a little speed\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; gained strength which caused him to move a little faster, he could\n&gt; force his\n&gt; &gt; way through the snow more easily than run through. He howled to the\n&gt; sky\n&gt; &gt; hoping Ice would get the message and come home. He missed Shadow\n&gt; Wing. He\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t get to know Ice, and now he might never get the chance. He\n&gt; might have\n&gt; &gt; shed a tear if the freezing winds hadn&#39;t frozen his ducts. This was\n&gt; like he\n&gt; &gt; remembered his crash site was like in northern canada. A frozen\n&gt; wonderland\n&gt; &gt; where he&#39;d met her, now it was his turn to search for her, He was\n&gt; glad, he never thought he&#39;d have the chance again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
