If you have it against Tankor, \nwhy not tell him directly by PRIVATE EMAIL...\nRudra could moderate you, but what good would that do? Slow the \ngame? Isn&#39;t slow enough like that? His job here is to make the rpg \nwork just as it is my job, which I am doing right now by the way. This \nmeans that we try to keep a good attitude between people.\nAlso, I think that Tankor did not mode but that his hyper-lengthy \nabsences just disrupt the flow of the game and that is what happened. \nTHAT is getting annoying.\nFinally, I&#39;d like it if people would at least try to stay polite to \neach other, and that means you as well, Rudra. I think you&#39;ll know \nwhat I mean. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m better than anyone here and I feel \nthat there are many players better than me, but I think respect should \nbe the guideline around here.\n\nIf that is the last OOC post for some time, maybe I&#39;ll feel like I&#39;m \nnot doing this for nothing.\n\nps: I will not moderate the jackass who answers this post on the rpg, \nbut you can be sure he&#39;ll hear of me being mad. Ya don&#39;t want that.\n\npps: I don&#39;t mind private emails though. I don&#39;t always get it through \nHotmail, so you can use n.marion@... too.\n\n\n"}}
