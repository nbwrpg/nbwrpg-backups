However as I sit here and read my mail, I see the \ngroup \n&gt; being polarized.  This deeply upsets me.\n&gt; \n&gt;     I did not know Minime well.  In fact I hardly, if ever \ninteracted with \n&gt; him.  However we were instructed to remember him.  Do we honor this \nmemory by \n&gt; arguing amongst ourselves?  Will we slowly drive the members of \nthis group \n&gt; away until we run out of targets and turn against each other?  Or \nwill we \n&gt; stop the senseless bickering, honor him with a day of silence, and \ncontinue \n&gt; on mourning and remembering in our own ways?\n\n\n"}}
