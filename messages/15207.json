Thats one of the reasons I came \nback. Besides, \n&gt; you wouldnt know how to use them to there fullest potential.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia spun around to Darkmouse. She didnt look to good, not \nat all. &quot;I \n&gt; think you ought to get in a CR chamber, now.&quot; She pointed out  the \ndoor to \n&gt; the CR room.\n&gt;     Paralysis jumped up and walked to the two fembots. &quot;Commander, \nwhat about \n&gt; Rampage? Are we moving?&quot; He asked rather egar.\n&gt;     She turned her attention to the frog. &quot;Yes, we are. As soon as \nTarantulas \n&gt; gets Kitkat and the others here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tarantulas gives a chuckle to Phobia, a bit confused about his \nremark. \n&gt; Once agian he looks around, &quot;ARE WE GOING OR NOT?!! WE HAVE CR \nCHAMBERS AT \n&gt; THE BASE!!!!! LETS MOVE OUT!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Rampage now marched through the ship, it creaked under his \nheavey body. \n&gt; He had to bring the main power back on, warm things up for Aracnia. \nThe rooms \n&gt; that had been left so quickly were still a mess, and the corridors \nwere \n&gt; scattered with debris. This place needed some work.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, what a sight it shall be to have the Predacons together \nonce agian! \n&gt; Soon, Megatron will join us too....and we will rule this planet! \nBawhahah!&quot; \n&gt; He mused to himself, finally reaching the control room where he \nwould \n&gt; reestablish power to the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Inferno, in flight mode, zoomed across the sky holding his \npistol. it had \n&gt; been a long time scince he had actually gone out and patroled, but \nhe was \n&gt; actually going to meet with the new Royalty, Black Aracnia. He \nwould reach \n&gt; the bunker soon.\n&gt;     As his rear burst out in fire, sending him faster, he spotted \nthe opening \n&gt; to the bunker. &quot;AH Ha! The Royalty! Fear not, Inferno has come for \nyou my \n&gt; Queen!&quot;  He yelled with excitement and began to plummit towrds the \nground.\n&gt;     He landed, and tucked his balster away. There, leaning on the \nentrance, \n&gt; he saw Quickstrike. A bit puzzled at first he realized who it was \nan \n&gt; approached.\n&gt;     &quot;Hail fuzor Quickstrike. Where can I locate the Royalty?!!!&quot; He \nsaid, \n&gt; saluteing when he said Royalty. He then ducked his head, arched his \n&gt; shoulders, and looked around the area suspiciously.\n&gt;     He frowned and tilted his head, closer this time, and waited \nfor the \n&gt; answer.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron had had the best CR dip in a long time. Waspinator had \nthe same, \n&gt; and was now talking to Adrax. Megatron just sat and thought about \nhis plans. \n&gt; Uniting the predacons into one fraction would be hard, impossible. \nBut from \n&gt; the rumors Aracnia had already begun. He would have to talk to her \nabout \n&gt; that....for now he just relaxed in the tank.\n\n\n"}}
