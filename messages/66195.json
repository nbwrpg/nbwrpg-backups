A\n&gt; &gt; large\n&gt; &gt; &gt; orbital factory was about 80 nano-klik=\r\ns away from the front of\nthe ship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The path the computer has c=\r\nharted for us to get back into orbit\n&gt; &gt; goes inside\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the safety margi=\r\nn of that orbital... there&#39;s a chance we might\nhit it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If the=\r\n only alternative is crashing.
