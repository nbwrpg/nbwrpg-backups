The Maximals and Predacons were\narguing yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again when the Tripreds arrived. They had been lurking in the\n&gt; &gt; ranks of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Preds and had waited the right moment to strike.

We decided to retreat so\n&gt; &gt; that we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could better resist them. We embarked on a ship, Maximals and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons, and departed for Earth.
