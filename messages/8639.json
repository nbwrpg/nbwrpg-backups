He growls, \nfiring again at Arcangel.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the missiles coming at him, the Alliance \nbot trying to jump away, but not in time. The first one hits him in the \nchest, smashing him through three trees and out of the other missiles&#39; path. \nHe falls from the tree to the ground, going into stasis lock.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus dives under a missile, looking at Kamodia. This was getting pointless. \nThe Alliance commander looks behind him at Arcangel, Icedragon, and Shocker.\n\n&quot;Reptilica,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;You, BloodyStrike, and Scattershot get \nout here and help.&quot;\n\n&quot;I can do even better...&quot; Reptilica&#39;s voice replies as Zardus fires at \nKamodia.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn the Alliance base, Reptilica turns to face Prowl, Prowl stopping in his \ntracks.\n\n&quot;Allright, Maximal, here&#39;s the deal. Some of your friends are attacking the \nArk. You call them off and we continue. You don&#39;t and you&#39;re welcome to blow \nus all up.&quot;\n\nProwl nods. &quot;Allright,&quot; he says, activating his comm as he loses his temper.\n\n&quot;Arcangel,&quot; he says into his comm, his voice containing anger, &quot;Retreat NOW! \nI want to have a talk with you later on about following orders.&quot;\n\nReptilica nods, resuming his course toward the entrance of the base.\n\n"}}
