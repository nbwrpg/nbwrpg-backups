She pressed a few buttons \nand the Chamber extracted a few cells off the bot.  She brought the \nsample over to Lady Hawk and set them down on the table in front of \nher. \n&quot;You have a point.  But then again, don&#39;t you think the Matrix had \nthis planned out long ago? In order to have balance, the matrix \ncreated both Autobot and Decepticon.  Maximal and Predacon.  This had \nto have happened for a reason. But what that reason is, I am not \nsure.&quot;  She went back to corner of the room as started looking at the \npaper work.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk took it for granted that Squizzy would understand. Two \nfacts were\n&gt; relevant to her. &quot;Predacons fight because they are programmed as \nwarriors.\n&gt; Maximals fight because Predacons exist.&quot; She tried to explain the \nsource of\n&gt; her beliefs but found it hard to put into words without instegating \nmore\n&gt; questions. &quot;I&#39;ll take you somewhere where I can make it more clear \nto you\n&gt; sometime. &quot; she said trying to change the subject. &quot;I have work to \ndo, If\n&gt; you wish to assist me you can bring me a sample of this new bots \nDNA&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
