I ran away \nfrom the battle, the battle that *I* caused, and left my fellow \nMaximals to die. What have I done? Some might argue that it was bound \nto happen anyway, that the Maximals will always battle the Alliance, \nbut it was I who needed help and .. shut *up* Teltoli.\n\nForgive me, I always babble. Whether it&#39;s a side effect of the nerves \nof the battle, or not, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever know.\n\nI&#39;m sure the Maximals are doing fine, anyway.\n\nProbably.\n\nDammit Teltoli, you need to concentrate on finding Carnage, and \nbuilding up your friendship again!\n\nDon&#39;t you just hate those thoughts that pop into your head, right \nwhen you don&#39;t want them to? I think it&#39;s called Impulse Thinking, \nand it happens all the time to me. Right when you don&#39;t want a memory \nto be brought up, you remember it with such clarity you start to feel \nguilty all over again? Oh yeah...\n\nNo, don&#39;t me wrong, I&#39;ve had the best life one could possible have. \nMy parents are still alive (I think), I was an only child so I got \nall the attention. No tragic deaths, No life scarring happenings, \nnothing. You know - that kinda makes me feel guilty too. Carnage had \ntragic deaths, and she coped with it kinda well. And here I am, \nmoping over a tiny little something. Wait, I&#39;m not moping, I&#39;m.. \n*shut* *up* Teltoli!\n\nSigh.\n\nI hope Carnage *is* around here somewhere, otherwise I will totally \nbe wasting my time. What if she&#39;s in the Jungle or something? Do \nRaptors even go in the Jungle? The first time I met her, it was in a \nswamp, and she was stalking me. Ech.. swamp. \n\nBesides, if she was in these .. grasslands, I would surely be able to \nsee her..\n\n\n"}}
