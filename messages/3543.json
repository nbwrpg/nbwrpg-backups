He \nwatched as she struggled with her wounds under the straps. He could tell \nclearly that she was in great pain.\n\nHe almost felt sorry for her. He stepped forward, with a curious, hurtful \nlook in his eyes. He was going to do something. He was, after all, a \ngentlebot when he wanted to be. He knew there was one enemy near-by, and \nanother that could knock his head off just for interfering. But slag those \ntwo, he was curious, and had to find out.\n\nHe quickly approached the table where she layed straped, listening carefully \nto the two spiders behind him. He stared intesnsely at Dark Mouse.\n\n&quot;Calm down,&quot; he said to her, barely thinking.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
