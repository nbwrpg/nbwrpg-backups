For how Starscream\n&gt;died, I assume that the blast from Galvatron killed him, and if it\n&gt;didnt, the Decepticons hunted him down.\n&gt;\n&gt;I too am really excited for the new series, but I agree. I hope they\n&gt;are the Decepticons. The toys look rad though.\n&gt;\n&gt;www.bwtf.com has some good pictures of them.\n&gt;\n&gt;Alloran, you are totally right, and i&#39;m sorry. But as far as I know,\n&gt;Abominus dosent have missile lauchers.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
