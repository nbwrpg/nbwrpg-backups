Jetstorm flew in at the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; moment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tankor: Back so soon?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm took an irritated look.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: How does it concern you? Those angelions were mere \n&gt; &gt; mockery...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They both entered the control room where Daemos, Belthassan and \n&gt; &gt; Anachronox were. Melchana came in moments later.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Alright. We will start now, no need to wait for Strika... \n&gt; &gt; Tripredacus, we are on the brink of a new age. In short time, we \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; start to gather more and more energon, and send it back to Raiko-\n&gt; Fhi \n&gt; &gt; 8. However, there are shadows in our skies. First, the \n&gt; Infecticons. We \n&gt; &gt; shall deal with them in their own time. Also, more concretely, we \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; to deal with a direct threat to our plan. Prophecy, display world \n&gt; map, \n&gt; &gt; energon concentration and Spark location.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The computer complied.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Geological study reveals that fertile grounds for the \n&gt; energon \n&gt; &gt; fruits are in this area (points towards greece). However, There \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; many transformers in there, more precisely inside the volcano \n&gt; named \n&gt; &gt; the Etna. I do not know exactly who is there, but expectations \nare \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; worst, hopes for the best. Gesper will soon be recalled as to \n&gt; permit \n&gt; &gt; the assistance of Prophetus in case of danger, so this means the \n&gt; &gt; Prophets go. I shall go too. Anachronox will be coming as well as \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm. Tankor, you will be in charge of the Shadow Destiny \n&gt; until we \n&gt; &gt; return. Questions?\n\n\n"}}
