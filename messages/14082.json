Put your hands in the air or prepare to get \nfried!&quot; Aracnia said as she drew her bowcaster.\n    Hell Beast, better yet, Apollo, laughed at her. &quot;Foolish transformer. You \ndo not know what your dealing with. Stand aside or I will be forced to \ndestroy you.&quot;\n    Tarantulas didnt like it ethier. He hated the Vok, and these Aliens were \nfar more annoying. &quot;What do you want, exactly. Maximals? We have three of \nthem.....take them if you like.&quot;\n    Hell Beast glanced over to them. The Armada would be able to drain there \nenergy to power several different functions. &quot;Very well. I will take the \nMaximals. But for now I am going into that bunker to further my \ninvestigation.&quot;\n    The Predacons agreed and let him go, but what no one saw was Megatron \nsneaking away secretly, back to the Cave.\n\n"}}
