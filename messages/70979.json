I have some tasks to do here&quot;\n\nThen Percertor send a private heavely encoded message to Rodimus and Tucson \n&quot;when this ordeal finish, i have some information that need to be shared.&quot; \nafter those events looking to Stanton and Bump said &quot;Situation is critica, \nElita is somewhere here, and our dear friend Legacy is wandering around too. \nWe must find her before this piece of junk and try to save Nightlight at \nsame time, I need the help of one of you... I know a way to free \nNightlight... Do you trust me?&quot;\n\n**********\n\nElita as soon as she heard the voices in her comlink and the lights turn \noff, she sought for a hideout. If a enemie was inside, it was smart not to \nbe in plain sight... Maybe she could ambush him and show her daddy and \nmommie how fierce she could be, she transforms to her beast mode and hide \nbehinds some pipers, listening and waitting in silence.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Sandy\nSent: Tuesday, January 18, 2011 9:15 PM\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Wicked Blades in the Dark!!\n\nQuickstride now trots toward Rodimus.  He wasn&#39;t sure as to what would \nhappen but he does as Rodimus asks.  But first he sniffs the Autobot to be \nsure his scent and signature are not tarnished.\n\n&quot;Nice shot but just in case... Don&#39;t take this the wrong way Rodimus, \nhmm....  Well, certainly smell the same and your signature&#39;s the same.. \nOkay, I can trust ya.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give ya a ride, \nbecause well, I&#39;m not transmetal, but I can certainly help ya.&quot;\n\nBack at the battle field, Tucson lays the weapons down as requested.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll do as requested, but I&#39;m counting on you to keep your end of the \nbargain....  You know, the voice, it&#39;s familliar....  Legacy...  It&#39;s either \nit&#39;s you, Legacy, or it&#39;s a trick.  If it is you, I ask only this, why?  Why \nwould you carry out such a deception for such a long time?  And why did I \nnot listen when it was imperative to do so?&quot;\n\nHe lays them down.\n\n&quot; If you must take someone, why not take me?  The power of the Matrix burns \nbright in my chest, it&#39;s what you want isn&#39;t it?  Then come, take it, but \nleave Rodimus, Lord Elder, and the rest of the Autobots and Maximals alone. \nThat is why I&#39;ve been given this power, so that they can live without fear \nor danger.  And if I must sacrifice myself to do so, then so be it.&quot;\n\nHe steps forward, and then stops, standing couragiously in front of his \ncomrades, to ensure their saftey.  Yet he makes no moves to attack himself. \nIn order to brace himself calmly, he closes his optics, waiting to see if \nthe voice takes up his offer.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I second that question. Tell us, what must we do in order to ensure the\n&gt; saftey of our comrade? We will retreat, as you demand, only if you keep \n&gt; your\n&gt; end of the bargain.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He still holds a resolute expression on his face. Tucson was ready for\n&gt; anything, but now his own stability could possibly be tested this day.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dark voice chuckled, a deep raspy voice, &quot;I don&#39;t believe I have given\n&gt; you a choice. You will lay down your weapons or you will loose more than\n&gt; your companion.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The sound of the metal scraping on metal can be heard. &quot;Optimus, Hound,\n&gt; Bluestreak . . . &quot; the voice echoes slightly as if the speaker is in a \n&gt; large\n&gt; room, it trailed off ominously.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Who are you?&quot;demanded Perceptor whose still showed a cold blood\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A quiet voice came over the speakers, &quot;You have forgotten me Perceptor, so\n&gt; soon?&quot; There was a chuckle, &quot;Ahhh, but then we never had a chance to truly\n&gt; get to know each other.&quot; There was a short pause and then the voice said,\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps we will soon enough.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Talon a Windlord were shocked and they didnt knew what to do.\n&gt; &gt; Hydras was slighty surpriced but waited to know more, he typed\n&gt; &gt; to Cyclonus, using a secret channel, in order to find it out\n&gt; &gt; what goin on\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus sent a quiet message back. &quot;It is Nightrazor, one of the soldiers \n&gt; I\n&gt; brought with me. He is a Ninja assassin, with many skills.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Back at the Ark, Quickstride was also becoming highly suspicious as to\n&gt; what was happening. He knew now that he had to try and keep in touch with\n&gt; Stanton and the others, inside the Ark. He now resorts to his com link.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Quickstride ta Stanton, over, what&#39;s gon&#39; on in there? I&#39;m not likn&#39;\n&gt; thiis. Maaan, I wish Uproar was still around.... I kinda miss the way he&#39;d\n&gt; claw metal doors ta shreads.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a pause and then Stanton&#39;s voice comes in a fierce whisper, &quot;I\n&gt; don&#39;t know. The power is out, and Nightlight is barely alive. This piece \n&gt; of\n&gt; scrap is holding her hostage!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump cut in, &quot;I don&#39;t know what has happened to Elita.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Santon and Bump talked another voice cut in, this one over the Autobot\n&gt; and Maximal channels, it was heavily encrypted &quot;Stall them!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It was Rodimus&#39; voice, and he was speaking rapidly. &quot;I think I have a way \n&gt; to\n&gt; get us out of this! I have rounded up the Fuzors that were on patrol. \n&gt; Stall\n&gt; as long as you can!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A small stone hit Quickstride in the back! &quot;Quickstride!&quot; Rodimus&#39;\n&gt; whispered, it is obvious he was the one that threw it to get his attention\n&gt; &quot;Come this way.&quot; He was some distance away, waving him over to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
