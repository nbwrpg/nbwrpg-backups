But, as\n&gt; someone with over 20 characters, I have to tell you, having to deal with\ntons\n&gt; of damage to post is hard, and it is not easy to deal with, I&#39;ll let you\ngo\n&gt; on that last post, but please don&#39;t do that again.  Saying all your\n&gt; characters are badly damaged is unfair)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot/Serpentor/Chaos/Minion/Unitron/Demon\nWulf/Flesh\n&gt; Ripper/Dark Claw:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nemesis Enforcer brought up his left wing to block most of the laser\nbolts,\n&gt; not even feeling anything, but a few bolts hit him in the right side.\n&gt; Stumbling back, Nemesis Enforcer quickly stood up again, firing off 25\nrapid\n&gt; laser bolts at Jetstorm&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot jumped to the side as the missiles struck near him, sending\nhim\n&gt; flying through the air several feet, slamming to the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Unitron raised both rifles, firing off three bolts from each off at Diskus\n&gt; (six total), two optic blasts lancing out from his green optic sensors at\n&gt; Shockaract.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Serpentor fired off a blast from his plasma launcher at Serge&#39;s neck.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Demon Wulf looked up in annoyance, firing off three red optic blasts at\n&gt; Diskus&#39; chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Flesh Ripper fired off three bolts from his rifle at Grenade&#39;s left leg.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Dark Claw raised his left open palm, a ball of black energy in hand.
