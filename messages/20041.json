He smiles, looking at the fifth one already in the clearing. \nHe turns around, activating his comm-link.\n\n&quot;Alliance members, we&#39;re moving to a new location. Anyone in the base \nbrace yourselves, anyone not at base, contact the base for new \ncoordinates.&quot;\n\nHe taps a few buttons, issuing a seperation command. Blast doors shut \nin various places of the Alliance base as panels split up, the base \nbeginning to seperate. A few seconds later, the base was laying in \nfive pieces in the clearing. The left one was the residential area, \nthe right one the labs and CR room, back one was the cargo holds and \nweapon rooms, and the front one was the bridge, training room, and \nother such facilities. In the middle sections were the power supply, \nshields generators, and the anti-gravity devices which had mobolized \nthe Alliance base in the past (before the anti moble base rule). \nSince the base was disconnected from the power supply, it had no \npower, an all the facilities were shut off, except for the ones in \nthe power supply section.\n\nThe four IF shuttles fly toward the sections of the base, the one on \nthe clearing also flying up to help.\n\nZardus smiles, taching each shuttle hatch on to a section of the \nAlliance base. His comm-link was flshing with Kluster&#39;s message, but \nhe was too busy to notice.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer swears as the base shakes, watching the CR chambers and \nother devices shut down.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re movin&#39;,&quot; he says to Diamond after he recieves Zardus&#39; \ntransmission, &quot;Better brace yerself.&quot;\n\nHe could feel the base lifting into the air, causing him to stumble \nsideways to regain his balance.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike and Reptilica jump back as the door of the Alliance base \nshuts, both of them falling as the base shakes.\n\n&quot;Bloodystrike swears, sliding down the hallway as the section they \nwere in was lifted into the air.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I sent it twice because if the first one just now arrived and \nI sent it \n&gt; friday. Also something has come up I have to take care of in person \nso this \n&gt; battle is put in 5 place in my to do list sorry. I&#39;ll explain when \nI have \n&gt; more time. If I don&#39;t counter attack or post in 3 days call it a \ndraw and \n&gt; continue without me. Even though I still will come for Zardus fate \nin the \n&gt; real world opposes me right now. Also if that is the limits of the \nAlliances \n&gt; Power we are not impressed people have rated them as higher that \nwhat they \n&gt; are or I was led to expect to much.\n\n\n"}}
