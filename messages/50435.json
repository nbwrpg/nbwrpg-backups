But Rauq, even you have to\n&gt; admit that HNC&#39;s \n&gt; inaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to\n&gt; read the first \n&gt; line, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s\n&gt; start-up is the most \n&gt; over-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all you\n&gt; need is a shot of \n&gt; Dr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a ripoff\n&gt; of every single \n&gt; horror movie out there.  \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as characters are concerned, Terminion and \n&gt; Skullertron/Slaughter actually display both\n&gt; personality and \n&gt; potential.  The remaining four have been\n&gt; cannon-fodder thus far.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to prove\n&gt; me right or wrong \n&gt; by roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a serious\n&gt; RPG, not a \n&gt; slapstick movie, so if I see another post/exchange\n&gt; like HNC&#39;s first \n&gt; one, where everyone involved is an absolute idiot, I\n&gt; will ingore \n&gt; every post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s)\n&gt; regardless of who \n&gt; they are or think they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering.\n&gt; Megatron is waiting \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of which\n&gt; are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt; &gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post about\n&gt; right now, but I \n&gt; &gt; still have to read the posts up till when i last\n&gt; checked em.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this\n&gt; obviously aint \n&gt; &gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises verbal\n&gt; shields*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease fire\n&gt; in this flame war \n&gt; &gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it started\n&gt; wrong right from \n&gt; &gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; been said, were \n&gt; said, \n&gt; &gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at\n&gt; defusing the situation \n&gt; &gt; and it blew up. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting\n&gt; style, that&#39;s your \n&gt; &gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with\n&gt; a bunch of \n&gt; &gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the\n&gt; way you&#39;d like \n&gt; &gt; him to post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting,\n&gt; if you want to say \n&gt; &gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find it\n&gt; really hard to \n&gt; &gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog\n&gt; shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the same context.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut\n&gt; up about this \n&gt; &gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing.\n&gt; Nothing anyone can \n&gt; &gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being\n&gt; quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; &gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
