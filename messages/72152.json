E=\r\nither\n&gt; he has moved her to this location at some point . . . &quot; SKYSHADOW\n&gt;=\r\n turned to look at the open door that led into the room TARANTULUS was\n&gt; in=\r\n just off the cargo bay, &quot; . . . or he was already here.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n=\r\n\nDINOBOT nodded over at SKY SHADOW, &quot;So he would know his own boltholes wit=\r\nhin it. A nd how to bypass them.  It wonders what else he has stashed away,=\r\n from the old day or the new one.  I would suggest we keep an optic upon hi=\r\nm, but he would only do so if he allowed it.&quot;\n\nPausing, and walking along q=\r\nuietly wtih SKY SHADOW, lsitening to what the other mech said.  &quot;So, we sha=\r\nll have to scour the entire ship to see what little schemes he has.&quot;\n\n\n&lt;OLD=\r\n - TARANTALUS&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Any way you like my sweet.&quot; he said in low tones, his=\r\n optics filled\n&gt; with wicked amusement.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nThere wa=\r\ns a nod, and a flutter of her optics, &quot;Of course.  Whatever gets the job do=\r\nne.&quot;\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK nodded, his stance, that of a dignifi=\r\ned gentleman, and yet\n&gt; here was a certain glance from his optics that said=\r\n something more.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nTo BLACKARACHNIA, CRYOTEK was n=\r\no more a GENTLEMECH than the MEGATRON of old could be counted to keep his w=\r\nord.\n\nShe kept up a winking vibe going at him, the first of the game to com=\r\ne.\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What a cute thing!&quot;said hidras while he wat=\r\nched Blackarachnia &quot;Smart,\n&gt; &gt; poisonus, and I hope that you havent any dis=\r\nloyalty in your genes... It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; for your own good, I would hate to rip of=\r\nf with my bare hands your\n&gt; &gt; beautifull body; but I will do it if were nec=\r\nesary&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nAt thsi point, BLACKARACHNIA turned over =\r\nto HYDRAS then and gave him a formal curtsy, her legs clacking up along her=\r\n back like mandibles, &quot;Of course my Lord.  A pleasure to serve..  Under you=\r\n again.&quot;\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh I am sure that nothing as delicate a=\r\ns this could have treachery in\n&gt; her proccessors.&quot; CRYOTEK said as his crim=\r\nson optics watched\n&gt; BLACKARACHNIA closely. While he words and even tone he=\r\nld hints of dry\n&gt; humor, his gaze however was dark, watchful and not entire=\r\nly tusting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking at Inferno said &quot;My loyal soldier, I have a spec=\r\nial mission for\n&gt; &gt; you&quot;he started to download some codes and a map&quot;Thjis i=\r\ns the map of our old\n&gt; &gt; base: the Blackfortress and I need that you bring =\r\nme a... special item that\n&gt; &gt; is in my former chambers;with those codes you=\r\n can open and unlock the roomn\n&gt; &gt; and the deposit box... Fractil, the trea=\r\ncherous spider and the dark lady...\n&gt; &gt; Come with me I need you for create =\r\na new predacon&quot;he typed some stuff and a\n&gt; &gt; drone with a caged vampire com=\r\ne in&quot;We have alot to do and we need more\n&gt; &gt; troops&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT/BLA=\r\nCKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nThere was a nod over from BLACKARACHNIA as she turend, &quot;As you=\r\n command, LORD.  ARe there any other sorts of traps within it we should e a=\r\nware of to risk setting off?&quot;\n\nGlancing over at TARANTALUS with a half blin=\r\nk of confusion.  After all, the MEGATRON of old would have not remotely tru=\r\nsted TARANTALUS to take something &#39;delicate&#39; from his personal quarters no =\r\nless, without a scheme in place. But this was NOT the Megatron she was used=\r\n to now, was it?  This was HYDRAS.\n\nAt this point, her nodding over at HYDR=\r\nAS and CRYOTEK.\n\nWASPINATOR piped up, &quot;So, what going do with rest of Bug B=\r\nots.  ME not want go out and get blown up!&quot;\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There was an answ=\r\nering nod from INFERNO. &quot;As you command your highness.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But wasn&#39;t yo=\r\nur base destroyed Mighty Hydras?&quot; SKYSHADOW said as he\n&gt; looked at HYDRAS.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; INFERNO glared at SKYSHADOW, &quot;Do not question the royalty!&quot; He looked\n=\r\n&gt; at HYDRAS, &quot;I am ready and at your command!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to leave, giv=\r\ning SKYSHADOW one last glare before moving\n&gt; towards the door.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - D=\r\nINOBOT/WASPINATOR&gt;\n\nWASPINATOR continued, &quot;So, Ant Bot always still aft kiz=\r\nzer.  Wazzpinator stay herez, where not be blown upz!&quot;\n\nDINBOOT glanced to =\r\nSKY SHADOW, &quot;I see that he has not changed.  And shall I be accompanying yo=\r\nu for when the other..
