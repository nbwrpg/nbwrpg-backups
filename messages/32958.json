Hot Rdo never did kill Unicron in the movie. His body\n&gt;was destroyed and the head left in Cybertron orbit was sevearly damaged.\n&gt;But in the third season of G1 (TF: 2010 in Japan) he twice tryed to\n&gt;restore his body, and in one ep restored StarScream to life.\n&gt;(Some how StarScream&#39;s body was again destroyed before his Beast Wars\n&gt;appearance. Ok thats the end of my G1 rant.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
