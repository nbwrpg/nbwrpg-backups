You make it \nAlloran. Just nothing for fighting. We&#39;re a peace mission.)arrived \nagain.\n\n&quot;Wha do you think? This is the new embassy. More safety, nore \nsecurity, harder to find us. We&#39;re rebuilding all the equipment here. \nBut before we do that there&#39;s an evil Child and I must face. It might \nbe a horrible ending. We could be sucked into the black abyss. But I \nthink we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;\n\nVulois put his hands on Child&#39;s body.\n\n&quot;Come on Child....feel the Matrix. Come back to us.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq tapped on the back of the shuttle.\n\n&quot;This back plate is holding most of it, but we still need more. Let&#39;s \njust scrounge up some rubble and than patch it together.
