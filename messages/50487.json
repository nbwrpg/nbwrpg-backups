I&#39;m not \nthat surprised you came on over to leave your lip imprints \neverywhere, Cassidy. You are queen of ass kissing. And you couldn&#39;t \nbe more incorrect about the people here. The people here are \ncomplete asswipes who cannot resist putting my, Lurker and former \nmember Hollywood Narrator&#39;s posts down. Well, not really me, because \nyou all thought I was DEAD, eh? Well, if I was, it&#39;d be better then \nthis. This RPG has fallen from grace, and it ain&#39;t gonna get up. I \nused to be able to squeeze some fun out this RPG, but that time is \ngone. Ever since the restart, this RPG has been resisting the fact \nthat it just needs to lie down in it&#39;s own grave that it&#39;s very own \nmembers and moderators have dug. The restart introduced brand new \nsparkling fresh rules! Like a 5 character limit! And what a crock of \nshit this was! I was going to leave then, but stayed anyway, because \nof my wanting to keep this RPG far from death. I realize now, that \nit isn&#39;t possible. Not when you have shit for brains like Cardhead \nand Airly here. And Airly, you bitch, in case you did not know, you \nintroduced a new misery to my life in my time of being here. I have \nput up with your shitty English and god awful posts, filled with \nmodes of ridiculous attacks and ignoring my attacks. I could not be \nhappier as I bid you all a middle finger, with the exception of \nLurker. I will remember this RPG, for being where I first met him. \nAnd before I go, I want to wish Airly a lightening bolt to the \nskull, and Cassidy, you will soon find that if you post, you be put \ndown, and that the only one in this RPG with any sense is Lurker and \nthat you will soon come to regret your ass kissing. Lurker, see you \nin the INCREDIBLY AWESOME DBZSF, MAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!! And bye to you \nall.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Hop Along Cassidy \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 2:20 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Nice group... ^.^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC: Hi, everyone. ^_^ I know this is sort of out of the blue, \nbut I just felt the need to compliment NBW RPG. It seems like a very \nnice RPG, if you ask me. Most of the writers are very good, and \ntheir posts seem well written. I really do enjoy looking through the \nposts. Haha, I don&#39;t understand a lot of stuff, because I don&#39;t know \nmuch about Neo Beast Wars, but I do like how this RPG is built. You \nguys do an excellent job, and I thought you deserved to hear it from \nsomeone who&#39;s not really in the RPG. ^_^ All of you are quite lucky \nto have such a great owner who keeps the place in shape and \ntogether. But, what&#39;s an RPG without the members? ^.~ Well, before I \nend up writing a speech so long that you guys forget what I&#39;m \ntalking about (hee hee, trust me, I can do it... ^_~) I guess I had \nbetter shut up. ^_^ You guys are terrific! Keep up the good work, \nand support each other so this RPG will last! I just know you guys! \ncan do it! *cheers* NBWRPG! NBWRPG!
