If that is incorrect please let\nme know and I will make changes.\n\nBIC:\n\nIn the air sweeps continue to rain firepower on city below. In some\nplaces people are continuing to be corralled into larger building\nstructures, while in other places the sweeps fire with seeming abandon.\nWith a frightening intelligence a few �wings� of sweeps break off and\nbegin to target the anti-aircraft batteries, disintegration beams\ncutting through skies like energized ginsue knives. \n\nMeanwhile in the air a short distance from the maximal base\nRavenchief�s volley of missiles flew at Cyclonus, only to be evaded by\nthe craft. Boosters flared as Cyclonus swung to one side, allowing the\nmissiles to fly past him. With a short burst of cannon fire he blew\nthem out of the sky, and then he continued on. \n\nHowever Ravenchief was not to be left without company, Scourge banked\naround also, his sweep craft uniquely agile and swift. As he came\naround a red targeting laser blared out �painting� Ravenchief, �You are\na fool to stand against us Maximal! You only have termination to look\nforward to!� Scourge opened up with his acid cannons!\n\nOn the shoreline the sweeps lost interest in searching for Trelos,\nperhaps they lost his scent, so turned their attention to Doc. \n\nAs Doc�s blast lanced out, catching one sweep in the wing casing it to\nsmoke a little. Meanwhile the unmistakable smell of acid began filling\nthe air as red targeting beams danced around Doc�s position and two\nother sweeps began to open fire on Doc.\n\nOn the railing above Doc�s position, Kup managed to hit one of the\nsweeps but the other - either it was more agile or more lucky - but it\nmanaged to avoid him. Even as that happened several other sweeps swung\ninto position ready to open fire as targeting beams lanced out again,\nbut just suddenly they broke position! \n\nThe reason for this became more evident as the now open air rippled and\ntwin missiles approached Kup and Rodimus� positions, fire and wind\ntrailing behind them like a vortex. As the missiles approached it was\nobvious that they were the same type of missiles fired from Cyclonus\nearlier and that these missiles were going to do quite a bit of damage!\n\nAt the Maximal base, sweeps continued to pound on it in an attempt to\nbreak its shield defenses!\n\nOOC: Don�t forget Nightstrike and Darkfate were commanded by Cyclonus\nto either take the Maximal base or Destroy it with the help of the\nsweeps left behind.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
