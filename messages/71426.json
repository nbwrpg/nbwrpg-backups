He heaves a sigh and kneels down to Wheelie.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I was=\r\n going to give you a lecture and a warning but I realize you just comeback =\r\nonline after many vorns .   You were not aware of my change of status to Pr=\r\nime office and perhaps mistook me for my previous status.  I&#39;ll let it go t=\r\nhis one time, Wheelie but keep in mind that a Prime is a Prime no matter wh=\r\no they are.   All right, you&#39;re free to roam the Auto base now.  Please try=\r\n not to get sent to my office again, okay?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a smile of understand=\r\ning, Tucson opens the door to let Wheelie go on his   way.   Once having le=\r\nt Wheelie free, he waits for Talon with a light hearted smile on his face.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n\nOOC - Uhm, I posted Wheelie leaving your quarters and he never entered=\r\n them in the first place, then him heading out.  So there&#39;s no way he coudl=\r\n have been there, and he wouldn&#39;t have gone back over to them!  So will pos=\r\ne this as taking place out in the ship corridors.  Thanks!\n\nAlso, I appreci=\r\nate your posting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how you have each and every charac=\r\nter of your&#39;s coming up, then doing something to me, then knowing each and =\r\nevery thing that happened to each adn every other one that did, and them al=\r\nl having the exact same opinions over on everyone as everyone else did.  \n\n=\r\nAlso, unless your characte ris  asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emphatical=\r\nly order him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere far els=\r\ne after you for a setup.  Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to go ba=\r\nck to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s not e=\r\nspecially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well when I pos=\r\nd him trying to leave.  So, if going to go somewhere with him, please give =\r\nme a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time.  It&#39;s two times you posed him e=\r\nxtensively going with your characters when it was not in character for him =\r\nto do so.\n\nIf your characters have had interactions with him in the past or=\r\n things I should know of, let me know?  As I have no idea where Wheelie int=\r\neracted with Tuscon or how they would have remotely konwn of one another, a=\r\nnd you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the past, when I hav=\r\ne no idea of that.\n\nSo again, if they&#39;ve had interactions as NPC&#39;s, let me =\r\nknow their generic history so I can respond appropriately.  If he&#39;s going t=\r\no be told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a chance to respond =\r\nappropriately if he does or not, or make it something like a specific order=\r\n in the case someone is a superior.  And it&#39;s also rather weird how your ch=\r\naracers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opininos and back one=\r\n another up to the hilt on thier interactions and everything.  I feel kind =\r\nof wedged into a corner by this.\n\nI understand I&#39;m new to the gruop and you=\r\n&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather hemmed in on the character wi=\r\nth what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how things operate, and how you =\r\nhave all of your alts congregating and making me feel pressed into a corner=\r\n.\n\nAnyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bit too negative, thank you very =\r\nmuch for the welcome here and for playing wtih me and interacting with Whee=\r\nlie.\n\n&lt;Back In Character&gt;\n\nWheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes=\r\n over at him, &quot;What is this with all of you?  You&#39;re back and forth whateve=\r\nr I do.  This is what Prime is, just a rank?  It seems like it&#39;s just sort =\r\nof dank.  We had four of five in a room, that&#39;s not a level of doom and glo=\r\nom.&quot;\n\nThen, walking away from Tuscon, but looking behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re =\r\ngood with all of your friends, congrualtions on the promotion and to whatev=\r\ner ends.  But we, we were never friends.  We went back and forth in our way=\r\ns, and I respect your orders for these days.  But we&#39;re not here to have fu=\r\nn, we&#39;re here to fight and run and gun.&quot;\n\nWheelie leaning against the wall,=\r\n &quot;I&#39;ll work wtih you, if you do tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is hell.  =\r\nI&#39;d prefer to keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they try a=\r\nnd be nice.  But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to do=\r\n, or how you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew.  So by al lmeans, give me some =\r\nspace, we&#39;re here to fight for the future of our race.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
