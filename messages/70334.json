He was going to attempt something he \n&gt; had never done before with his sonar systems.  He attempts to amplify the \n&gt; signal via trailer speakers, to see if that would immobilize the insects \n&gt; long enough to allow himself and the group to continue uninterrupted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot could tell what he was up to. Simply because before the \n&gt; accident, none of them ever separated from each other during a tough \n&gt; battle.  As his sister, she knew when her big brother was up to something \n&gt; substantial.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He&#39;s positioned a pair of trailer amplifiers.  Perceptor, sorry, but \n&gt; you&#39;ll want to turn off the audio sensors again.  Ohhh, he&#39;s only done \n&gt; this one other time and lemme tell ya, you want sonic boom you got it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She turns off her audio sensors also, as does Quickstride who can actually \n&gt; surmise what Tucson Prime was now up to.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I wanna keep my ears thanks very much.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson provides a count down until deployment of his amplified sonar \n&gt; attack.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It looks like someone ignorred my warning shots.
