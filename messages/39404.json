Ready to move out \nand assist the Chevron cause at my command.&quot;\n\n* Thus...she placed her faith in the Maximal that stood at her side. As \nsquad leader for this mission.\nIt HAD occurred to her time and time again that, someday and soon, she had \nto single out and officially title a transformer to take up the role of \n2nd-In-Command.\nBut her attention was soon grasped by AzureBlade; a pleased look crossing \nher features when he bowed but then that expression was wiped clean off her \nface when he suddenly spoke his TRUE name.\n&lt; Protoform Z?!&gt;\nShe remembered the reports on the Protoform X that was in the original Beast \nWars...and she remembered the fight she had with it before she was named \n3rd-in-command.\nSlag! That had been one tough bot.\nAnd here, bot bowing right in front of her was just ANOTHER of those \ncreatures.\nIron Raptor&#39;s expression became cold as she eyed AzureBlade, a thoughtful \nbrow lifting. The dominant claw on her boot armor coming down and sparks \nflew as the tip collided with the armored floor.\nIt was questionable...yes. But could she condemn another prototype that was \nno different then herself?\nHer expression softened a bit.*\n\n&quot; AzureBlade...though I know nothing of your sins I am sure that, as long as \nyour actions remain true to the Maximal cause, orders are followed, and your \nloyalty remains pure for the remainder of your existence, all will be \nforgiven.&quot;\n\n* A growl tricked from her throat as blue eyes narrowed.*\n\n&quot; But for a time being you will remain close to me. So that you not only \nshow that you are worthy to the fellow Maximals but to me as well.\nUntil you have proven so, your acceptance into this unit is reserved.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked down at him.*\n\n&quot; Do you understand?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
