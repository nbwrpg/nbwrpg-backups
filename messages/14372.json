You and him usually post minutes apart, and\n&gt; when you can&#39;t post, by a magical coincidence he can&#39;t post either.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois looks at Windrazor and Terradive.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is what I like to call the &quot;nerve center of the mountain. Eight\n&gt; different tunnels to go through. One leads to my lair, seven will\n&gt; lead deeper and deeper into the mountain with twists and turns that\n&gt; you won&#39;t remember your way back, and the last one leads to a giant\n&gt; lake of Alligators. We have a 1/8 chance that we will end up in the\n&gt; right one. But I think this is the one. Follow me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois heads down one of the tunnels.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Fliq\n&gt;\n&gt; Fliq leads Ramulus to the hull around the  mid-section.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Okay, this should do. Let&#39;s wait for Brix.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix walks into the storage room and finds a box full of tools.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in here somewhere. I&#39;ll just take the box.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just than Brix thought he heard the sound of footsteps.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Huh? Wha? Forget it. My imagination.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brix heads down to where Fliq and Ramulus are, but the sound still\n&gt; follows....\n&gt; (Ooh! Spooky.)\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream heres the yelling of words between KitKat and Testifyer.\n&gt; He runs out of his room and does a flip over Testifyer&#39;s head,\n&gt; pulling out his two blasters in the process. He landed, turned around\n&gt; and put them against Testifyer&#39;s head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do that again, and so help me Matrix I&#39;l blow your f&#39;n head off.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt;\n&gt; Gotron saw that Reptillica was handling it, and went back to his post.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Zava\n&gt;\n&gt; Zava watched as Deemos made plans.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What?!?
