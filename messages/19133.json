All he saw was \nflowers and plants. The golden sunshine touching his face. But suddenly the \nsky went black and a dark figure rose from the horizon. He pointed at him \nwith his skeleton type fingers..he saw visions of death and destruction. He \ncryed as these images passed through his body. Finaly he shot at the figure \nand it went away. And all was peacful again in his dreams. He sighed and \nlaied in the grass. The evil being was but into dormancy...but for how long?\n\n"}}
