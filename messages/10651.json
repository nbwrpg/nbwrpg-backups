Necromancer stopped and looked over at\nHell Drak.\n\n\t&quot;My scanners are detecting two Maximals named Dinobot and Tavatron\nnearby,&quot; Necromancer said to Hell Drak.\n\n\tHell Drak looked at Necromancer, &quot;Well, what are you waiting for brother? \nLet&#39;s go check it out!!!&quot; Hell Drak said and ran off towards Dinobot and\nTavatron&#39;s location.\n\n\t&quot;Hey!  Wait up sister!!&quot; Necromancer shouted as he ran to catch up with\nher.\n\n\tNecromancer and Hell Drak reached a beautiful place after running a bit.\n\n\t&quot;It&#39;s a paradise, brother!&quot; Hell Drak said as she gazed around.\n\n\t&quot;Yes, sister, it is indeed a paradise.  I&#39;d hate to think what would\nhappen if Predacons found this place,&quot; Necromancer said, also staring\naround in awe.\n\n\tSuddenly, Necromancer and Hell Drak&#39;s attention was caught by two bots.  \n\n\t&quot;My scanners show that these are the two Maximals we were looking for\nwhile we came here,&quot; Hell Drak said to Necromancer quietly.  Hell Drak and\nNecromancer walked over to Dinobot and Tavatron.  Necromancer stepped up\nand spoke.\n\n\t&quot;Don&#39;t pull out your weapons, we are not hostile bots.  My name is\nNecromancer and this is my sister--&quot; Necromancer was interrupted by Hell\nDrak.\n\n\t&quot;The name&#39;s Hell Drak,&quot; She said.\n\n\tNecromancer continued, &quot;Anyway, we were sent to Earth to help you and the\nother Maximals.  Our scanners detected you two nearby so we decided to come\nand meet you.  The scanners tell us that you are Dinobot and you are\nTavatron, am I correct?&quot; Necromancer said, hoping that he and his sister\ncould gain their trust.\n\n\n"}}
