You use that\n&gt; bomb of yours and we are all dead. I value the lives of my team more\n&gt; than my hurt pride in the matter. Second, You seam to be very good at\n&gt; what you do. I wish to be allies instead of enemies. But, if you wish\n&gt; not to be allies, then after you have left my ship, we will be\n&gt; enemies. But I gave my word. And I must keep it. Honor demands it. No\n&gt; matter how I feel about it later, I must keep my word. Even now. yes\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t mind turning you into scrap for what you did to my ship,\n&gt; but my word is binding. I can not go back on it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She waited. She knew no matter how the others would feel about this,\n&gt; she had to keep her promise and release this fox.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now please, I have many things to deal with. Come out, and I will\n&gt; walk you out of my base. I wish no more damage. And I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; get blown up. So stick to my side and I shall make sure you get out.\n&gt; Do you understand? Please come out and then leave my ship. As I said,\n&gt; I value the lives of my pack. And I don&#39;t want to get blown to the\n&gt; pit myself either.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; KitKats offer sounded to good to be true, he comes into her base,\n&gt; &gt; steals genetic material, damages her home and she lets him walk\n&gt; out?\n&gt; &gt; There was something about KitKat that he didn&#39;t trust. He had to\n&gt; &gt; admit that for a Predacon &quot;B&quot; um I mean Witch she was atractive. He\n&gt; &gt; just didn&#39;t want to be fooled by another pretty face. &quot;You want to\n&gt; &gt; know why I broke in here? I don&#39;t even know that, It&#39;s my function,\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s what I do.&quot; he knew that Name Function and online date were\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; three things a POW could offer. &quot;Now what makes me so special that\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;d go so far out of your way to track me down just to let me go\n&gt; &gt; again?&quot; He wasn&#39;t used to the offer she was making him. He wanted\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; go free but he wanted to know why she was being such a nice puppy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
