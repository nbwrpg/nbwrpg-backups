And evidently it&#39;s \neither destroyed or your characters can&#39;t get to it.  So you bring in a TM4 \ndriver?  Excuse me if I scoff a little!\n    This is getting ridiculous, and out of hand.  First the magical driver, \nthen the magical speaking with the Matrix and Oracle and such, and now this \ncrap.  Believe me, I&#39;m not going to let that driver be legal.  Your \ncharacters finding all the super powerful stuff, is not fair.  And having \nthem just appear, is also unfair.\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n"}}
