He had heard Perceptor&#39;s message.  \n\n&quot;Rodimus, =\r\ndisregard that last request.  But keep an eye on the chamber, where the Aut=\r\nobots sleep.  I have a feeling Nightrazor will indeed try to infiltrate it,=\r\n and lay harm to those who are fallen.&quot;\n\nHe knew it wouldn&#39;t be easy.  The =\r\npower of the Matrix was not a toy, but a responsibility.  Heading Perceptor=\r\n&#39;s request honorably was one of those responsibilites.  Yet, he knew it did=\r\n not prevent him from stalking Nightrazor through the darkened corridors of=\r\n the Ark.\n\n&quot; Hang on Talon, as soon as this threat is passed, we can both r=\r\nest.&quot;\n\nHe puts a hand to his chest.\n\nStraight Shot grumbles under her breat=\r\nh.\n\n&quot;Ughhhh!  Why?!  Why can&#39;t we blow off a few plane brains huh?!  What d=\r\no they deserve ta live for?!&quot;\n\nTucson puts a gentile hand on Straight Shot =\r\nwhile she remains in her weapon mode.\n\n&quot; They don&#39;t but their judgement wil=\r\nl come in another form, it&#39;s just not time yet.  It&#39;s not up to us to speed=\r\n up the process.&quot; \n\nStraight Shot tenses up a bit.\n\n&quot;I can tell in your voi=\r\nce that&#39;s not what you hoped for either.  C&#39;mon, you can&#39;t fool me Tucson. =\r\n You want it just as bad as anyone else, if not more so.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;=\r\nI want them stopped, no doubt about that.  If I could have the freedom to s=\r\nend all of them back to Char with their afts up their processors, I would. =\r\n But now I don&#39;t have that freedom. I can&#39;t dishonor what has been given to=\r\n me. But, you&#39;re right, I can admit what I really want, and yes, that&#39;s wha=\r\nt I really want.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot clears her throat.\n\n&quot;Well said.&quot;\n\nTucson c=\r\nontinues to think while stalking Nightrazor.\n\n&quot; This planet deserves better=\r\n than what Hydras can give it.

They caught onta us! Now what?!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He s=\r\ncreaches to Night Shift as he dodges the blasts on screeching tires.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;I dunno Rat trap, I&#39;m go&#39;n as fast as I can! I&#39;m not a speedster, I&#39;m a=\r\nn off roader.... Waaaaiiiit, that&#39;s it... We all know that jets can&#39;t fly i=\r\nn heavy vegitation right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Uh huh, Oh, I=\r\n get it, well ya better do it fast buddy or else we&#39;re done for!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNight Shift chuckles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Better get inside, it&#39;s a lot more fun when=\r\n you&#39;re buckled in.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap quickly gets inside, and settles him=\r\nself in the driver&#39;s seat, resorting to robot mode, buckling the seat belt.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Heeey, you&#39;re right, it is a lot more fun in the driver&#39;s seat. =\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Night Shift turns off the beaten path, and heads down a rather s=\r\nteep slope, as his tires roll over rough terrain, heading right for a patch=\r\n of heavy vegitation. His suspension system is now put to the test as he ro=\r\nlls along without a worry in the world, knowing that perhaps this would pro=\r\nve difficult for a sweep to follow him in such thick brush cover. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Okay, hopefully this will get those air heads off our tail pipe.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Back at the Ark, Tucson realizes that he&#39;s lost Nightrazor for the moment=\r\n, and decides not to try a shot at him. Instead, he concentrates and decide=\r\ns it&#39;s best to just follow him. Yet he wanted Nightrazor to know he was the=\r\nre. But without a fix on him, he had to start from scratch.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; All =\r\nright, I never said this was going to be easy. Sorry Straight Shot, but I b=\r\nelieve he&#39;s on the move again.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot goes along with him.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;No probs, things happen. Now what?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson narrows a bro=\r\nw.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; We play his game. I have control of the PA system in the Ark,=\r\n so it&#39;s time he knew who he was up against. I also had time to anaylize wh=\r\no he is. Name is Nightrazor, one of Cyclonus&#39;s Ninjabots. It came up on my =\r\nintel search system.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He turns on the PA on his gauntlett.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t make this harder than it has to be, Nightrazor.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He narr=\r\nows his optics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s it, if Sonar is the only way to stop him t=\r\nhen so be it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot squeals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh no, not again, =\r\nthat last one really hurt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He sighs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorry, I have to.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a look of sheer determination, he again activates a sonar wa=\r\nve formidable enough to rattle the relays of any bot around. He realized he=\r\n could not let go of his sonar attack, due to the fact it was the only way =\r\nto capture Nightrazor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m tired of antics, and I&#39;m tired of game=\r\ns! This is OUR Ark and it&#39;s MY duty to keep it safe! And safe it will be!&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was clear that Tucson was truely losing his temper. Through his=\r\n injuries, he remains strong, stubborn and resolute. There would be no stop=\r\nping him from protecting his comrades, and his base. And there would be no =\r\nstopping him from protecting the bodies of the Autobots who have yet to awa=\r\nken many years afterwards.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rodimus, I need you to concentrate yo=\r\nur vigil over the sleeping Autobots! And be sure no harm comes to Optimus P=\r\nrime! I have a feeling that Nightrazor, our so called intruder has been sen=\r\nt here to destroy his body and those of our sleeping comrades! If one Autob=\r\not is touched, do not hesitate to do the same to a Decepticon! It&#39;s a life =\r\nfor a life and I&#39;m NOT taking anyone&#39;s scrap anymore!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He transmit=\r\ns to Torca and the other Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Torca, if you can hear me, I n=\r\need you and the others to bare down on Hydras and the other predacons with =\r\nno holds barred! That means, if they take anyone&#39;s life, or attempt to, ret=\r\nurn the favor at will! They want to play rough, they got it! Because if the=\r\ny think we&#39;re going to fall to them, THEY&#39;RE SADLY MISTAKEN!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He s=\r\nlams a foot down hard, and at the same time, lets loose another round of fo=\r\nrmidable sonar waves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonu=\r\ns &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I figured I would post first bef=\r\nore I decided if Tuscon would hit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor still had that last mov=\r\ne.

We don&#39;t want any of these pieces of scrap gett=\r\ning inside the Ark!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Noctorro, Airhammer and Quicksi=\r\nlver did what they could to harass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other fliers like Waspinator, =\r\nDeepstryke and even Cyclonus while Bantor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entered the fray with a wil=\r\nd abandon as he leaped after Hydras, hoping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distract him long enou=\r\ngh to allow the others to come in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kup&#39;s blasts are powerful a=\r\ns he attempted to fire at the sweeps as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However what he got in =\r\nreturn was several shots from Scourge as he lined up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Autobot. =\r\n&quot;Foolish prey!&quot; Scourge said as he came around for another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run, his a=\r\nuto canons opening fire on Kup!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile as the sweeps came a=\r\nfter Nightshift and Ratrap, Nightshift\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into his SUV mode =\r\nand began zipping through enemy fire hoping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dodge the well aimed b=\r\nlasts of the sweeps. However the sweeps are designed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to capture pray,=\r\n and so as Nighshift picks up speed, the sweeps quickly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oblige the Ma=\r\nximals by firing sizzling hot disintegration beams at them as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they fl=\r\ny after them!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Elita noded and Took ramulus&#39;s hand, she was unusually quiet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus looked at Elita, &quot;I will protect you.

While\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhe is far more durable than he once was, moving silently and stealthily is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not an easy task, especially with his injuries.
