Gabriel took a shot to the leg. It was minor \ndamage nothing serious. He dove down and pulled out another bomb. He inhanced \nits power and planted it on the bot&#39;s back while savior distracted him with \nfire energy blast. He pressed the button. He was too close so he would gain \ndamage from the explosion. He heard the bomb and was tossed to the tree and  \nhe struggled to get up.\n\n"}}
