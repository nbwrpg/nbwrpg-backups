Oh well, i suppose that&#39;s what i get for\n&gt; using WinXP; new OS \n&gt; = new bugs. =P\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve read the post concerning the\n&gt; energon being shot \n&gt; out of his (whoever he is) mouth, but I think that\n&gt; if your (dewboy) \n&gt; character is shooting energon out of his mouth, it&#39;s\n&gt; not going to be \n&gt; that powerful because it&#39;ll have to be in lessened\n&gt; amounts. It&#39;s not \n&gt; a slag fest, so don&#39;t just try to kill each other,\n&gt; rp it out; and, \n&gt; generally speaking, when there is a fight, both\n&gt; sides usually get \n&gt; damaged. =P\n&gt; \n&gt; Yah, nuclear firepower and any nuclear type weapons\n&gt; are not allowed \n&gt; at the moment.

Well.... its\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; secret and as far as you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bringing in hugar I dont remember him ever\n&gt; saying he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was your lap dog and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would do everything you say. He reads the post\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows whats going on, if he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finds a problem with it or nother council member\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finds something so wrong \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they will bring it up and say to possibly to\n&gt; change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. Also demanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; person to take damage doesn&#39;t really look good\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you and claiming that they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be moderated because you want them to be\n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make you look \n&gt; &gt; &gt; good. And as for a mutate making a barrier when\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got scared that caused \n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage, that never happened, when he got sacred\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; channeled energy in its \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mouth and fired it at at a bot. And what type of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; radiation is it? Nuclear? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Energon? If its nuclear then I believe thats\n&gt; illegal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am I correct Rauq?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Find a job, post your resume.\n&gt; &gt; http://careers.yahoo.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
