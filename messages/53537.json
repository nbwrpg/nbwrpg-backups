It will all depend on how the\n&gt; Tripreds want to act it out also, on their strategy.

If we can bring it into play, their firepower \n&gt; &gt; advantage will be negated.  And its cloaking ability is quite \nuseful \n&gt; &gt; for setting traps.&quot;  Devilcat smiles as an idea strikes \nhim.  &quot;That \n&gt; &gt; could be used to our advantage here as well.  If the enemy comes \n&gt; &gt; expecting the defense capabilities of one starship and they are \nmet \n&gt; &gt; with two, it will make a mess of their attack plans.

In this case, The maximals could hold \nthe \n&gt; &gt; line\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here while the Rogues go and destroy the remaining attackers at \n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; base. The preds tend to strike with all forces, but I don&#39;t \nknow \n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Tripreds.

If we focus \nall \n&gt; &gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attention on the Tripredacus forces, Hydras is free to strike \nas \n&gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chooses.
