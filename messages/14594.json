CyberShark gave it \nto her when he first met her.  So she would be able to enter the \nDestron base and not get fired on by the autoguns.  But Battera is at \nthe Cybertron Fire.  She knows nothing of the activities at the \nDestron base at this point.  She only visited the base for a brief \ntime anyway.  But she still has that device on her. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;David Torrey&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The only way his bomb could pass detection was if it had a Destron \nsignal, and only one of extreme importance, the Virus I decided to \nwipe out the computer system, a fail safe kicked in, and the new \ncomputer doesn&#39;t recognize any signals, Destron or otherwise, it will \nshoot everything, it assessed that if It shot the bomb it would bring \nharm to the ship, it can&#39;t allow that to happen, so it ejected it, \nwhere it goes is up to Earth2025. The only bot that can enter the \nship is Shredder, because Magmatron gave him a device so the \ncomputers would recognize him as a Destron, actually, I believe \nBattera still has one.\n\n\n"}}
