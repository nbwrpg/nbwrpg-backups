He studied the insturments carefully trying to\nfind the logic to the situation. The sensors showed nothing more than a\nnormal protoform with the basic abilities of such. He could see the fur\nbeginning to form. It had to be slowed until Lunarpine returned. &quot;I&#39;m afraid\nthat theres only one alternative.&quot; He thought about the virus again, he\ndidn&#39;t want to use it not knowing what side effects it might have but he\ndidn&#39;t want her suffering any longer than she had to.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to be honest with you&quot; he said using a slow bedside manner voice\nHe saw no reason to lie to her when she could read his mind. &quot;I developed a\ntype of virus that slows down translife abilities, I&#39;d prefer not to use it\nbut it could help you adapt, the choice is yours.&quot; he was up against a wall\nin this situation. Shadow Wing was confused and it seemed she was\nfrightened. In a way he was frightened too. But such choices were best left\nto the patient, not the (Mad) scientist.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 27, 2000 6:31 AM\nSubject: Re: Fw: Sparks\n\n\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt;\n&gt; She could sence the feelings and shock that ran through Veratis&#39; mind.\n&gt; &quot;Veratis, what happened? How is it that I can communicate with you,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t move my body? How is this possable?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She was starting to get scared.  She never comprehended that this\n&gt; sort of thing was even possable, let alone happen to her.  She\n&gt; wondered if this was a perminant state that she would have to live\n&gt; with, or was it temporary?  She felt an influx of power as her body\n&gt; started to change physically.  White hair started to grow on her head\n&gt; and wings started to grow from her shoulder blades.\n&gt;\n&gt; She paniced and screamed in her mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis was in shock, Shadow Wing was somehow communicating with\n&gt; him without\n&gt; &gt; the use of receptors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;How are you doing this?&quot; he asked trying to control his shock. If\n&gt; she could\n&gt; &gt; truly read his mind she&#39;d sense wonder, confusion, curiosity, and a\n&gt; bot who\n&gt; &gt; was truly at a loss for words. His experiments somehow gave her\n&gt; abilities\n&gt; &gt; she hadn&#39;t had in her old form.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
