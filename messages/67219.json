In the distance the sun was just\nbeginning to show its face over the horizon, its harsh light bringing\nout that strange redness that gave this place its name: the searing\neye. Moving in the fading darkness, sweeps patrolled the area, looking\nlike so many flies on a dead landscape. Cyclonus� powerful frame stood\nresolute and still, his typically foreboding and grim form seemed to\nexude a strange sense of inner peace as the powerful Unicron Herald\ngazed at the vista before him. \n\nLike some dark raptor Scourge landed next to his commander, for the\nmoment breaking the peace and serenity around them. �It is done.�\nScourge�s voice breaks into Cyclonus� contemplation. �They have\nreturned, and it is much as we thought. A few of the cybertronians are\nlooking skyward, but for the most part they are squabbling amongst\nthemselves.� Scourge held out a data chip to Cyclonus. �As you can see,\nwith our forces they will be an easy victory for us.� \n\nCyclonus nodded as faced Scourge and took the chip, glancing at the\ninformation on it.  �Then it is time.� He placed the chip into\nsubspace. �Then by Unicron�s command the earth must be made ready for\nassimilation and any bearer of the matrix must be destroyed.  Nothing\ncan be allowed to stand in our way!�\n\nScourge nodded, an eager smile spread across his face. �And nothing\nwill. But where shall we go first my lord?�\n\nCyclonus looked skyward as if his optics could pierce the veil of\ndistance between earth and them, silent for a moment. Then he turned\nback to Scourge. �We go to Atlantis.�\n\n Scourge nodded as the duo changed forms, both assuming deadly aerial\nmodes. Cyclonus� voice echoed through Minion communication channels.\n�To the air! Minions! Unicronians! The time is NIGH!� \n\nCyclonus, Scourge and the sweeps burst into the air, boosters lighting\nup the skies like a second sun, one that quickly fades into the\ndistance as the approach their goal.\n\nNext post Earth!\n\n    --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOOC: Any Minion who wants to join, jump on board, just post your way\nin. I am sure as we close in long ranged sensors will pick us up.\n\nAlso the lists seem to say that there are two or maybe more Matrixes,\nso if someone could fill me in?\n\nPreston\n(Cyclons/Scourge)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
