It was all about speed, precision, balance, \n  =\r\ndiscipline, grace, and of course effectiveness.\n\n  He could see potential i=\r\nn her and turns his head in both Nightlight and \n  Bumps direction.\n\n  &quot; Bu=\r\nmp&#39;s right, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential \n  =\r\nfor train&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot. You got the right moves, mody, and grace, and=\r\n \n  once you&#39;re trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Master=\r\n \n  Yokitron once said, that a student often shows potential even if they d=\r\non&#39;t \n  realize it themselves. Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the=\r\n \n  training, just see me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training=\r\n \n  program for ya. Hmm, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too.. It&#39;s=\r\n a \n  perfect opportunity for both of you ta get some extra training under =\r\nyour \n  belts.&quot;\n\n  He positions himself again.\n\n  &quot; It would really help bo=\r\nth of you out a lot, see&#39;n what Hydras managed ta \n  pull on ya in the past=\r\n. The reason why it didn&#39;t work on Tucson or me, is \n  that Master Yokitron=\r\n&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritually for what could \n  come down the p=\r\nike. Clear minds empty of thoughts are less likely ta get \n  infected by ne=\r\ngative influences, simply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta \n  hold onto=\r\n. Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark. Bad stuff just goes in one \n  way, a=\r\nnd out the other. You guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took \n  you.=\r\n And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be. I bet my spark plugs \n  th=\r\nat if you and Rodimus train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our level \n=\r\n  and that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autobots this side of the \n =\r\n galaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors perceive. This type of =\r\n\n  strength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and harmony. A perfect =\r\n\n  balance between spark, soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lotta dexteri=\r\nty \n  aquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity that makes even T=\r\nucson \n  Prime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Commander. It&#39;s=\r\n a \n  difference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S the dire=\r\nction \n  Tucson is gonna take, and if you guys were trained in our art, so =\r\nmore power \n  to ya.&quot;\n\n  He then looks to Bump, as the repair bench does it=\r\ns job to repair the \n  internal damages done to him.\n\n  &quot; Speakn&#39; of perfor=\r\nmance, that reminds me... I need new hydraulic shock \n  absorbers, timing b=\r\nelt, and I know my struts need work, new tires, body \n  work, and Ty Rods f=\r\nixed. Oh yeah, need a new front and back end alignment \n  too.&quot;\n\n  To repai=\r\nr the damgages to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehicle \n  mode,=\r\n to prepare for the rest of his repairs. He also notices a busted \n  headli=\r\nght on the left side.\n\n  &quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for the left side=\r\n, new bumpers, front, \n  back, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up=\r\n. Probably because I \n  smacked that tree real hard in alt form. After this=\r\n is all done, I am so \n  gonna give those preds the bill, literally. In oth=\r\ner words, I need a total \n  overhaul ta my alt form. And if you can help it=\r\n, I&#39;d like ta hold onta this \n  one for a while.&quot;\n\n  --- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Stood up And leave her daughter in the bed, she smiled and \n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; said\n  &gt; &gt; to her daughter &quot;I be righ back in no time, just remain he=\r\nre&quot;\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Nightlight smile=\r\nd and she walked toward the interior of the cr, she \n  &gt; &gt; looked\n  &gt; &gt; to =\r\nBump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive skills that I \n  &gt; &gt; =\r\nmay\n  &gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT qu=\r\nizzically, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He\n  &gt; manipulated a few controls on his scr=\r\neen. &quot;If you are looking for a\n  &gt; specific ability, I can see what I can d=\r\no, but as far as skills, that\n  &gt; is something you learn.

Bump&#39;s rig=\r\nht, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya \n  gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential &lt;BR&gt;for =\r\ntrain&#39;n ya as a Ninjabot. You \n  got the right moves, mody, and grace, and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;once you&#39;re trained, there&#39;s \n  gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight. Mas=\r\nter &lt;BR&gt;Yokitron once said, that a \n  student often shows potential even if=\r\n they don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;realize it themselves. \n  Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if =\r\nya want the &lt;BR&gt;training, just see me after \n  we get repaired, and I&#39;ll se=\r\nt up a training &lt;BR&gt;program for ya. Hmm, maybe \n  Rodimus might wanna join =\r\nin on it too.. It&#39;s a &lt;BR&gt;perfect opportunity for \n  both of you ta get som=\r\ne extra training under your &lt;BR&gt;belts.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He \n  positions himself agai=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; It would really help both of you out a lot, \n  see&#39;n what Hydra=\r\ns managed ta &lt;BR&gt;pull on ya in the past. The reason why it \n  didn&#39;t work o=\r\nn Tucson or me, is &lt;BR&gt;that Master Yokitron&#39;s training sorta \n  prepared us=\r\n spiritually for what could &lt;BR&gt;come down the pike. Clear minds \n  empty of=\r\n thoughts are less likely ta get &lt;BR&gt;infected by negative influences, \n  si=\r\nmply because there&#39;s no thought energy ta &lt;BR&gt;hold onto. Clear mind, clear =\r\n\n  soul, clear spark. Bad stuff just goes in one &lt;BR&gt;way, and out the other=\r\n. You \n  guys had a lot on your minds when Hydras took &lt;BR&gt;you. And that co=\r\nuldn&#39;t be \n  helped, but now it can be. I bet my spark plugs &lt;BR&gt;that if yo=\r\nu and Rodimus \n  train with me, I can get both of ya up ta our level &lt;BR&gt;an=\r\nd that&#39;ll make you a \n  pair of the strongest Autobots this side of the &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;galaxy, but not the type \n  of strength most warriors perceive. This type =\r\nof &lt;BR&gt;strength is the strength \n  of spirit, inner peace, and harmony. A p=\r\nerfect &lt;BR&gt;balance between spark, \n  soul, and mind. And yeah, there&#39;s a lo=\r\ntta dexterity &lt;BR&gt;aquired in Ninjabot \n  training, the type of dexterity th=\r\nat makes even Tucson &lt;BR&gt;Prime a bit \n  different then the traditional Auto=\r\nbot Commander. It&#39;s a &lt;BR&gt;difference Hydras \n  has no inclination how ta fe=\r\nnd off. THAT&#39;S the direction &lt;BR&gt;Tucson is gonna \n  take, and if you guys w=\r\nere trained in our art, so more power &lt;BR&gt;to \n  ya.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He then looks t=\r\no Bump, as the repair bench does its job to repair \n  the &lt;BR&gt;internal dama=\r\nges done to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; Speakn&#39; of performance, that \n  reminds me... I n=\r\need new hydraulic shock &lt;BR&gt;absorbers, timing belt, and I \n  know my struts=\r\n need work, new tires, body &lt;BR&gt;work, and Ty Rods fixed. Oh \n  yeah, need a=\r\n new front and back end alignment &lt;BR&gt;too.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To repair the \n  damgage=\r\ns to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehicle &lt;BR&gt;mode, to \n  prepa=\r\nre for the rest of his repairs. He also notices a busted &lt;BR&gt;headlight on \n=\r\n  the left side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for the left side,=\r\n new \n  bumpers, front, &lt;BR&gt;back, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39;=\r\n up. \n  Probably because I &lt;BR&gt;smacked that tree real hard in alt form. Aft=\r\ner this is \n  all done, I am so &lt;BR&gt;gonna give those preds the bill, litera=\r\nlly. In other \n  words, I need a total &lt;BR&gt;overhaul ta my alt form. And if =\r\nyou can help it, I&#39;d \n  like ta hold onta this &lt;BR&gt;one for a while.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;--- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, Super \n  Cyclonus =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight Stood up And leave her \n  daughter in the be=\r\nd, she smiled and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to her \n  daughter &quot;I be =\r\nrigh back in no time, just remain here&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &quot;Yes M=\r\nommie&quot;said happily Elita&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight \n  smiled and=\r\n she walked toward the interior of the cr, she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  looked&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; to Bump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive \n  skills=\r\n that I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &l=\r\nt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT quizzically, &quot;What do \n=\r\n  you mean?&quot; He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; manipulated a few controls on his screen. &quot;If you a=\r\nre \n  looking for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; specific ability, I can see what I can do, but =\r\nas far as \n  skills, that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is something you learn.
