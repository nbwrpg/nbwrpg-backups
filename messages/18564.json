So I will be on more than usual.  As \nschool work permits me, that is.  Aren&#39;t you all just so lucky?  Also, \nfootball ends on the 25th, and I&#39;ll be getting home two hours earlier, so \nI&#39;ll be on EVEN more.

He would crush these pathetic ants, one by one.  No matter how long \nit took.  The behemoth burst out into laughter as autogun fire stung into his \nback.  \n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf looked at the battle, his blade at the ready.  &quot;Brothers, we have \nremained idle enough.  CRUSH THEM!&quot; he howled, firing off three optic blasts \nat Jestorm, a burst of flames emitting from his open mouth, heading for \nJetstorm.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off three bolts from his rifle at Sharpedge.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw, still in his &quot;vehicle&quot; mode, firing off two missiles, one from \neach missile launcher installed in his vehicle mode, at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nChaos fired off ten rapid optic blasts at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nMinion fired took out his automatic rifle, firing off twenty-five explosive \nshells at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nUnitron, still in tank mode, targeted with his cannon, firing off a single \nblast at Kracken.\n\n---\n\nSixshot gained altitude, getting a target lock, and firing off two seeking \nmissiles down at Gigas.\n\n---\n\nAres transformed to tank mode, firing off three laser blasts from all four of \nhis cannons, a total of sixteen shots lancing out at Sharpedge.\n========\n\nSerpentor looked at the Alliance bot who had told him to join the battle.  \n&quot;Fine.&quot; he said, rubbing his mech-fluid soaked face from the shrapnel of the \nexploding Diskus.  He ran off for the Mafia base.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re to injured.&quot; Scattershot said, taking out a charge and setting it in \nthe middle of the pieces of Diskus, the bomb set for 20 seconds.\n\nNemesis Enforcer and Scattershot entered the Alliance base as the bomb \nexploded, no flames or burning pieces of metal coming near the base.\n\n\n"}}
