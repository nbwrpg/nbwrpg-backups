She opened her eyes, but they \nwouldn&#39;t open all the way.  Her head felt like a ship was blasting \nit.  The knocking sounded like thunder in her ears.  She spoke \nsoftly,&quot;yeah,yeah,I&#39;m coming.&quot;  She slowly got up and went to the \ndoor.  She opened the door and saw Drillbit standing there. She said \non a gruff whisper,&quot;hello there.&quot; She had her hand on her head. She \nhad dark circles around her eyes and her tail was just hanging down \nand not swaying around like normal.  &quot;Come on in.&quot; She left the door \nopen for him.  She slowly sat in her chair. &quot;Just please keep our \nvoice down untill the ship stops firing it&#39;s cannons inside my head.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ridumus continued to work on the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; DrillBit woke up, and walked to KitKat&#39;s door.
