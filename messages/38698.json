The reptillian beast stalked through the\ncave hunting his unsuspecting prey. Necromancers scent was strong, the\nmutant knew that his DNA doner was near, Looking over a series of\nStalactites he creapt closer. From where he was he could see what he&#39;d come\nfor. Somehow the Mutant hadn&#39;t suspected that the hunt would end this\neasily, or this quickly. The mighty T-Rex dove forward biting down on what\nhe believed was his enemy. His attitude quickly changed with the realization\nthat all he had was a pile of shedded scales. &quot;So you&#39;ve gotten rid of your\nold form. That won&#39;t save you, one day soon I will execute you like the\ninferior unit you are.&quot; The mutants insanity was obvious but his logic\nwouldn&#39;t be denied.
