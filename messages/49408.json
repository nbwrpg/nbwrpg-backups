I never saw Coming of the \nFuzors, but I do know that Dinobot&#39;s only ranged weapons have been \nenergy-based, regardless of which version of Dinobot it is.  And as \nanyone who knows anything about science can tell you, energy weapons \ndon&#39;t have &quot;ammo&quot; per se and thuswise don&#39;t need reloading.  If it&#39;s \nnot a built-in device, it may require a fresh power pack once in a \nwhile.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok pals I don&#39;t know what do you think to do about RPg&#39;s \nsituation... \n&gt; but I&#39;ll start to do something right now.\n\n\n"}}
