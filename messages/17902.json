Got it? Good. Get creative, but knock off the cussing.  I \n&gt; mean, my chars don&#39;t go calling the other chars names like that. \n&gt; Battera called Vulois a creep.  KitKat refered to Megatron as a \n&gt; jerk.  Come on.  Get creative please. Thank you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Battera::\n&gt; She flew high and went into a cloud bank. &quot;That inferior piece of \n&gt; Cybertrash.  He just hauled of and hit me for no reason. Huh, I \n&gt; should have let him stayed tied up.&quot;  She landed a few miles away \n&gt; from the allience base, just at the boarder of thier scanners.  She \n&gt; landed in a tree and rubbed the side of her face.  It stung and \n&gt; burned slightly. &quot;He&#39;s so high and mighty,he&#39;s such a creep. Just hit \n&gt; a bot for no reason. And that ladyhawk feather head,royalty huh? They \n&gt; can all go to the pit. I&#39;m tired of being pushed around. So I&#39;m not \n&gt; royalty. So I&#39;m not some special big hot shot from the outer limits \n&gt; or something.&quot;  SHe turned her head back towards the direction of the \n&gt; alliance base and stuck her tongue out. &quot;FFFBBBBRRRTTT. To the \n&gt; darkest corner of the pit with you. Who needs you anyway. I don&#39;t.&quot; \n&gt; she lightly touches the mark on the side of her face. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure \n&gt; I repay you for this.&quot;  She sat in the tree. Not realizing she was \n&gt; still in the scanner range, she hung upside down in the high branches \n&gt; of the tree.  Her wings wrapped around her and tried to conseal \n&gt; herself in the shadow.  &quot;Yeah, who needs them anyway.&quot; She kept an \n&gt; eye out for passing bots, but would remain quiet. She was too mad to \n&gt; think correctly and decided to try to calm down before doing anything \n&gt; else. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
