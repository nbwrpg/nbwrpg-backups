Jeez, what does a bot have to do to get chipped?\n\n::Striker::\n\nStriker stumbles back as the chip hits him in the neck, one of his shoulder \nblasters spinning around to fire at it. The shot misses by an inch, burning a \nhole through his head. Various major systems were destroyed: personality \ncircuits, data tracks, neural centrals, and other important functions.\n\nNot enough resources to maintain it, Striker&#39;s internal computer shuts down, \nits self destruct program destroyed along with all the other systems. He \nslumps to one knee as his shoulder blasters stop firing. With a final exhale \nof breath, Striker falls down to the floor, not dead, but no longer who he \nwas. He was now a blank protoform, ready for new programming.\n\n"}}
