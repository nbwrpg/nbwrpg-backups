She scrambles aside as Spike comes her way, pulling out her \nnailgun and sending a barrage of her own spikes after her opponent.  \nHer right arm hangs useless, the shoulder badly damaged.  However, \nher left shoulder and arm - with which she holds her weapon - are \nintact, as is the (plainly visible) black-skull insignia of the \nRogues on that shoulder.\n\nDevilcat/Riekan/Torin::\n\n&quot;... so that&#39;s the story,&quot; Torin finishes up as the trio nears their \ndestination.\n\n&quot;I see.
