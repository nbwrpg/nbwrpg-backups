Glad to see the \nreaction to my return. I&#39;ll now take back the chars that I lent out before \nlast friday.\n\nForgive me if this post is a bit inaccurate, but I just read a whole lot of \nposts, and am a bit confused.\n\n::Zardus/Prowl/Autofire/Striker/Shredder/Rex/Firearm/Kluster::\n\nZardus opens his eyes. He wasn&#39;t feeling well. The Alliance commander looks \ndown at his arm, seeing the last traces of the shimmering which had phazed \nhim out days before dissapear. He hated that feeling, it always left him \ndizzy. Zardus clentches his fist, relieved to have a physical body once \nagain, after his absence. He stands up, looking around the lab of the \nAlliance base.\n\nWalking toward a computer console, the Alliance commander presses a few \nbuttons, a table rising out of the floor in the middle of the room. On the \ntable was strapped the femm that Reptilica and Bloodystrike had brought in a \nfew days ago (IR&#39;s new char).\n\nZardus taps his wrist, his wrist comp popping up. Tapping a few buttons, he \nchecks the messages he had recieved. He smiles at Skulletron&#39;s report. The \npair seemed to be doing well.... But it was too dangerous to send a reply, \nthe Cybertronian Fire would probably detect it.\n\nZardus looks over the &#39;resumes&#39; from Inzola and Stranato. He activates his \ncomm-link, sending the two bots a transmission (I&#39;m assuming that the resumes \nhad their names on them).\n\n&quot;Inzola and Stranato,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;I understand that you wish to \njoin. Is this correct?&quot;\n\nZardus looks back at the femm on the table. She&#39;d have to wait, he had more \nimportant things to do. The Alliance commander turns around, exiting the lab \nand heading for the bridge.\n\n&quot;All Alliance members,&quot; he says into his comm-link, sending the transmission \nto all Alliance bots except for Skulletron and Feline (because they&#39;re in the \nCF), &quot;I&#39;m back. I&#39;ll be at the bridge catching up on recent events.&quot;\n\nHe switches his comm to Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s frequency.\n\n&quot;Nemesis, I have returned, has anything major happened lately?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl appears back at the CR room of the Cybertronian Fire. He looks around, \na bit dazed.\n\n&quot;Computer, locate Iron Raptor,&quot; he says to the nearest console, a location \ncoming up on the screen. Prowl walks off toward the location, eager to see \nthe bot he loves once again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAutofire looks after Paralysis as the bot runs off toward the gunfire, then \nturning to look at Adrax.\n\n&quot;Should we help &#39;im?&quot; he asks, looking around the room.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker appears back at the Ark, nearly falling as his body phazes in. He was \ndizzy, the ussual result of these sort of things. The Maximal looks around, \nnoting that alot more panels have fallen from the cealing. He activates his \ncomm-link, setting it on a Maximal frequency.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m back, everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;What&#39;d I miss?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nShredder appears in the jungle, looking around. Mantella was nowhere to be \nseen. His scanners reported that she was a bit away, slowly heading toward \nthe Destron base. He takes off at a jog, heading for her.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing BrightBlade and Gangon fall, Firearm walks over to BrightBlade, \npicking her up and putting her over his shoulder, Rex doing the same to \nGangon. Firearm activates his comm-link, sending a transmission to Chordate.\n\n&quot;Sir, the intruders are neutralized. What do you want done with them?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster blinks, appearing in the cargo hold of the CF. He activates his comm, \nheading for the bridge.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m back, Chordate, how&#39;s the intruder situation?&quot; he asks into his comm, \nexiting the cargo hold.\n\n"}}
