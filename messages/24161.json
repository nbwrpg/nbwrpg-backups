If he hadn&#39;t jumped in Optimus could have killed Megatron right\nthere at Autobot city. Instead Megatron used him as a hostage, and shot\nPrime several time. Optimus later died.\nHis thoughts were interupted with the drop kick. He hit the ground, and\nstrugled back to his feet.\n&quot;Just how the hell are you a million years old? There wern&#39;t any\nMaximals or Predicons then. Just a small war on Cybertron between the\nAutobots and Decepticons!&quot; \nHe sent a round house kick at Unitron&#39;s chest.\n\n"}}
