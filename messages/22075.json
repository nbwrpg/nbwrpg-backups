She smiled. This \n&gt; looked like a crew that she could get along with. She looked up at \n&gt; Killfest and smiled, showing her fangs slightly. &quot;This is the only \n&gt; pod that I could get. And it&#39;s a long walk back so I suggest that \nwe \n&gt; get as many of you inside. I will come back for those who can&#39;t fit \n&gt; on this trip.&quot; She looked Killfest up and down. She liked him. He \n&gt; appealed to her reptile side. &quot;Hold on a nano second.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She walked into the pod and dumped the crates that were in the \ncargo \n&gt; hold of the pod. She walked back out and looked at Killfest. &quot;I \nhave \n&gt; made a little more room in here. Get you and those who can fit \ninside \n&gt; and I&#39;ll have to come back for the rest.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
