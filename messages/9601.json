His eight eyes \ngleamed in the sunlight as they finally made it to some sort of civilization. \nHe looked closer to see that they had reached Predacon territory, but they \njust stumbled apon a protohuman hunting party.\n    &quot;Ah, a feast, or at least it would be if I wasnt trapped in this \nminiscule form! None-the-less, a feast i shall make of them!&quot; He said, \nplunging down on them from the sky.\n    Many of the humans thrust spears at him, even basic arrows, and clubs. \nThey did little damage and as he got closer many of them scattered. Adrax \nsnapped his jaw quickly around one large alpha male, as it would seem because \nhe was the biggest and seemed to be leading them.\n    In his Predacon shell, Adrax could swallow the human whole as he was able \nto in his past life. Now, like a snake, he choked his pery until the human \nturned a chill pale. With his insect like arks, he ripped the meal into \nsmaller parts and gobbled them quickly. The process was much longer than \nexpected, and when he went to find another human, they were gone.\n    Adrax, spinning the the air, blood staining his mouth full of jagged \nteeth, &quot;Hairless apes! You cant run forever!&quot;\n    With that, he turned to his counterpart and then looked in the direction \nof the base which wasnt to far off now. He took to the air once more and \nproceeded on to the destination.\n\n"}}
