He didn&#39;t like loosing his \ntemper at base, and the only ones there to yell at were the females.\n\nHe saw a rather large rock formation in the distance. He slowed his pace and \nstopped to study it. &quot;Say look at that.&quot; he said. He blinked at it. He \nzoomed in on it with his optics and found out that it was a cave. It had a \npointed top and a rather open area around the front.\n\nHe nodded his head to Stingtra. &quot;Wanna go check that out? Could be somethin&#39; \ninterestin&#39;.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
