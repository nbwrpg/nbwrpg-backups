He growls, listening to what \nVoluis had to say. His eyes widen slightly as Voluis shows him the vision of \nfighting bots. He calms down slightly. It was only natural: Maximals and \nPredacons always founght, and killed, each other.\n\nRex calmy looks at the next vision, then narrowing his eyes at Voluis&#39; words. \nHe might be a racist (or a factionist), but he had his reasons. Many of them. \nRex growls as he feels the presence leave his mind, the Maximal looking at \nBattera.\n\n&quot;This Voluis seems to have interesting abilties,&quot; he says to her, &quot;But how \ncan he be sure that the Predacons and the Alliance cooperate?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus gallops out of the forest, coming to stop near Brix/Octociz.\n\n&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, there was a canyon in the way,&quot; he says, transforming. He \nwalks over to the pod, looking from it to Brix/Octociz. He had never done \nsomething quite like this before.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he says, walking toward the other bot, &quot;How exactly do we \ntransfer your spark?&quot;\n\n"}}
