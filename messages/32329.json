And Airly, the Brotherhood has no gestalts, so none of them are \naround in response to your question.\n\nAlso, who is in control of the CF, posting damage wise that is?  Just want to \nknow who to yell at.)\n\nThe Protectobots/The Oblitercons/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark Claw/Nemesis\nEnforcer/Scattershot/Imprisoner/Predator/Choran/Shockwave/Unitron/Firestarter/\nDouble Punch/Manterror/Injector/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Smokescreen/\nSerpentor/Teufel/Unicron:\n\n\n\nUnicron flew alongside his newest creation.  Teufel.  In a language from \nEarth (German) &quot;teufel&quot; meant &quot;devil&quot;.  It didn&#39;t really fit the nature of \nthis newest addition to the Brotherhood ranks.  The Chaos-Bringer just liked \nthe sound.\n\nAt first glance, most would say Teufel was rather bland and nothing special.  \nAt a second and closer glance, the assumptions would be confirmed.  His body \nwas armored above average, and a few cannons were hidden inside his frame.  \nHe was far from defenseless.  Just featureless.  It looked like he had no \nmouth, audio receptors, &#39;nose&#39;, or optics.  No sign of a beast or alternate \nmode.\n\n&quot;Teufel, arm your missiles.  In a while we will arrive at the battle and aid \nmy followers.&quot; Unicron ordered.\n\n&quot;Understood.&quot; a bland, monotone and overall boring voice replied.  A robot \nwouldn&#39;t want to get into a long conversation with someone with a voice like \nthat.  It&#39;d be...just plain to boring.\n\n===\n\nDemon Wulf was struck by a few laser bolts and growled, but he was close to \nmerging.  He fired a widespread of flames from his mouth, intercepting four \nmissiles heading for him from Silverbolt and Depth Charge.  The resulting \nexplosions sent some light flames and small amount of shrapnel at Demon Wulf, \nbut the Vok creation ignored it to the best of his abilities.\n\nHe raised his sword, firing off an energy-signature seeking missile at \nSilverbolt&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper saw the inbound Demise and chuckled, slashing out with his right \narm&#39;s, his claws out and ready to show why exactly he had been named &quot;Flesh \nRipper&quot; (hence his claws are above the average animals...) at Demise&#39;s right \nhand (assuming he&#39;s reaching with both arms).\n\nSimultaneously with his left arm he slashed diagonally up at the Predacon&#39;s \nabs, the boosters in his feet charging up quickly ready to blast off at top \nspeed.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw felt several shots hit him, yet he continued, rising in the air \nrapidly in his biped form.  In his right hand formed a black orb of energy \nwith the destructive capability of a charge.  The Vok threw the orb down \ntowards Incarninator.\n\n---\n\nDark One had reached Hiss, and discontinued his firing upon Demon Wulf \nbecause of the ineffectiveness and the task before him.  &quot;Hold on you idiot.&quot; \nhe chuckled to Hiss, taking out a few basic repair tools, getting to work on \nHiss, hoping no one would be cheap.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown pushed up, five rapid optic blasts piercing into his shoulder and \ntwo more into his right pec.  He stumbled back in pain, cursing and returning \nfire with three optic blasts at the insect bot, making his way towards Dark \nOne.\n\n---\n\nPyro cursed as his shots did absolutely nothing to Abominus.  Of course, if \nhis fire balls didn&#39;t hurt Vehement, they certainly weren&#39;t going to hurt a \n&#39;bot two or three times bigger than the Brotherhood leader.\n\n&quot;Oh, slag!&quot; he yelled, jumping quickly, the laser blast from Abominus leavin&#39; \na crater and sending Pyro flipping through the air, landing on his right arm.\n\n---\n\nHiss and Scavenger remained down for the count and in stasis lock.\n\n---\n\n(Gonna wait for Rdhal to get back to continue fight between Hot Spot and \nHeadstrong)\n\n---\n\nGroove looked to Abominous and if he could&#39;ve would&#39;ve crapped in his pants.  \nStunned with fear, the shot from the Decepticon gestalt struck him dead on, \nsending him flipping back a dozen feet and crashing down.\n\nHe had a large gash in his chest and he stood still, trying to recollect his \nthoughts that seemed slightly out of reach.\n\n---\n\nBlades saw Groove&#39;s predicament and pulled off his attack.  He armed his \nfourteen missile tube and launched off four missiles at Abominous&#39; cervix.\n\n---\n\nFirst Aid remained a charred mess.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise dived to his right, landing on his side and rolling.  As he rolled \nhe fired off four blasts from his photon pistol.  He intercepted two incoming \nmissiles, one nearly hitting him and sending shrapnel into his face.  He let \nout a yell and stopped rolling, covering his face.  A missile struck him in \nthe back and he went limp for a second.  Then he started twitching as he \nstarted to save strength for a second wind.\n\n---\n\nBlasts strike Imprisoner and his entire frame shakes.  &quot;Idiots.  I doubt \nthey&#39;ve even caught on by now.&quot; he said to himself.  He noticed the tide of \nbattle, but didn&#39;t want to completely give himself away.  Until he noticed an \ninsignificant robot open fire on Choran.\n\nHe armed his launchers, firing off four more missiles at the Cybertronian \nFire as he did an intense scan to determine the strength of the shields.\n\nThe cannon on his form swiveled, firing off three blasts at Prowl.\n\n---\n\nPredator painfully got to his feet, firing off two rockets at the \nCybertronian Fire.  Weapons fire struck him and almost knocked him off \nbalance but he stayed on his feet.\n\n---\n\nChoran saw incoming missiles and simply fired off five rapid optic blasts to \nintercept them.  He raised his rifle, firing off twenty rapid laser blasts at \nDepth Charge&#39;s torso.\n\n---\n\nShockwave was interested.  Everyone was going at a relatively less important \nwarrior.  Unitron.  Since no one fired at him other than easily dodgable \nautogun fire, he decided to aid his comrade in arms.  He armed four flares, \nlaunching them off to intercept weapons fire.  One intercepted Incarcinator&#39;s \nshells.  One missed its target.  One going off prematurely to take out \nZardus&#39; missiles.  And the last but not least destroying the missiles heading \nfor Sun Crusher.\n\nHe armed his own missile launchers, tired of saving fellow Decepticons who \ncouldn&#39;t handle things themselves.  He launched off two missiles at the \nCybertronian Fire, logic telling him victory was within his grasp.  Once the \nshields fell, it would all be over for the ship.\n\n---\n\nAutogun fire raked along the fire-red space fighter&#39;s frame doing little \ndamage, and a flare from the same fighter intercepted two seeking missiles \nfrom the Element.  He armed his launchers, firing off two energy-signature \nseeking missiles at Endbringer.\n\nFrom his nosecone ten rapid laser blasts erupted as he rolled through the \nair, the energy heading for the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nUnitron&#39;s worries were down quite a bit when all that was heading for him was \nfifty rounds.  He dived down and did a barrel roll, several shells embedded \ninto his wing and frame but not hitting anything to vital.\n\nA blast from another enemy pierced through his back dorsal fins and hurt his \nvelocity, but he was still fast as lightning striking the ground again and \nagain.  He fired off twenty-five rapid laser blasts at Zardus&#39; pelvis.  He \nlaunched one energy-signature seeking missile at Killfest and another heading \nfor Rhinox.\n\n---\n\nBeeline fired ten rapid blasts from its optics, only intercepting three \ncharges inbound for its creator.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch felt a charge striking him in the back, but he held his ground.  \nHe turned around with a deep pain in his chest as some kind of liquid leaked \ndown his back.  He raised his scorpion tail.  Using visuals from Beeline, he \nwas able to deduce almost exactly where the cloaked enemy was if he hadn&#39;t \nmoved.  He raised both pinchers, firing off four missiles so that the area \nwhere the cloaked enemy was would be the center.  The resulting pre-mature \nexplosions from his missiles would hit that area and anything in a 20 yrd \nradius (including up and down).\n\nHe began modifying his scanners internally to try and at least get a fringe \nlike affect for his attacker at least.  He made a note to add an upgrade to \nhis optic sensors.\n\n---\n\nInjector felt a few optic blasts impact and he flew back through the air \nslightly.  &quot;Slagger.&quot; he yelled, firing down two stinger missiles at the very \ntemporarily downed Breakdown.\n\n---\n\nManterror shook from shots as his exo-skeleton took all the hits.  He cursed \nin rage, firing off two ion disks from both arms.  Two ion disks headed for \nPerceptor, the other two for the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nSmokescreen looked to the Predacon, Killfest, and noted he was firing at \nVehement.  He powered up his optics, ready to open fire, but stopped.  He \ncouldn&#39;t take on Vehement alone, and whoever was firing on Vehement would be \nhelpful.  He would only take down Vehement&#39;s attacker when Vehement himself \nwere down.\n\nHe raised his rifle, getting a clear shot on Vehement, who still hadn&#39;t \nnoticed the Warrior of Light.  Smokescreen would wait for the perfect moment, \nwhen Vehement replied to Killfest&#39;s attack with a barrage of deadly force.\n\n---\n\nVehement slid through the air gracefully, a missile and the EMP bolt going by \nhim.  He swung his left arm, piercing through the missile and causing it to \nexplode.  It charred from his left hand&#39;s fingertips to the forearm.  There \nwere even some shrapnel pieces stuck in him.\n\nHe ignored it though, raising his right arm that had a large barrel where a \nhand, forearm, and elbow should be.  He launched off two energy-signature \nseeking missiles.\n\nHe raised his left arm, a near invisible sonic wave shooting out at the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher watched missiles heading for him get intercepted and he simply \nsighed.  It was a test of endurance, this battle.  He didn&#39;t need heathens \nhelping him.  He raised both arms, launching four missiles down at EndBringer.\n\n---\n\nReflector laughed at Streetwise.  &quot;Take that heathen dog!&quot; he yelled, filling \nwith laughter.  He raised his right arm, the double-barreled weapon attached \nto it launching off two missiles from each barrel.  Four missiles spread out, \ntwo energy-signature seeking missiles heading for Killfest.  The other two \nmissiles were regular missiles that headed for the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n---\n\nScattershot flew hard left, easily avoiding the behemoth, Abominous&#39;, shot.  \n&quot;Hm.&quot; he said, reaching into subspace for the appropriate weapon of \ndestructive capability.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer touched down to the ground, rifle aimed at Serpentor&#39;s neck \nas he began walking towards his enemy.  He fired a few shots, but the snake \nrolled out of the way.\n\nAs he adjusted his aim, Serpentor threw his plasma launcher at Nemesis.\n\n---\n\nThe plasma launcher soared true, striking Nemesis dead on in the face and \nsending him sprawling back.  &quot;Take that batman!&quot; he hissed, reaching into \nsubspace and taking out his sword.  He walked briskly towards Nemesis \nEnforcer, sword at the ready to slice down and decapitate a robot.\n\n\n"}}
