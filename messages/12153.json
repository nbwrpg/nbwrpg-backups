OK WHO said \neveryone could go in the ark and blow it up. you all are stupid did you all \nnot understand if the ark goes very few bots would still exist. there is no \nway any of your guys would have been able to get into the ark except for \nzergling and Punch. they would have killed each other with the bombs. when \nArcangel,Silverbolt, and Brooder arrived they got in the way of the door so \nhow the fuck did all these people get into the ark. I say take one of those \nbombs stick it up zerglings ass. That was the bigest mode I ever heard worse \nthen what I do. and if any of you all understand what it means firing \nrockets down the haul. It maens that when i fire rockets they are heading \ndown the walls of the ship. If you don&#39;t understand that GO TO SCHOOL YOU \nRETARD. Also logomorgh why do all of your char keep dying? I will leave it \nat that.]\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
