He now tries to hold on with his legs, rather than hands.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Woahh, I dunno how this is gonna work big guy.. Guess we&#39;ll find out eventually.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride faces the fortress, and stands his ground. The wind blows breezes through his mane as he looks onward, ears forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Remember Rat Trap, we don&#39;t make any moves unless they come after us first.&quot;\n\nAs Rat Trap and Quickstride prepare themselves Scourge merely moved to\nfloat approximately 30 feet above them, somewhere between their\nposition and the fortress itself. He directed his scanners downward to\nexamine them, his own sense of curiosity aroused.\n\n&quot;As Hydras has not seen fit to have you destroyed utterly yet, I give\nyou time to try and run.&quot; Scourge chuckled to himself, &quot;Stationary\nprey is always of so little sport.&quot;\n\nScourge&#39;s cannons come online, disintegration beams and laser cutters,\ndesigned to mow down prey and finish them off, however he as yet he\nhas not fired. Instead Scourge&#39;s engines were completely silent as he\nhung there watching, like some lone aerial wolf or eagle, ready to\npounce on a rabbit.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
