She smiled at his offer to move closer, silently getting to her feet and walking over to a place beside him. She then settled herself down and crossed her legs; it was one of the more comfortable poses to sit in. The tale of how he had gotten here was fascinating and she loved the way he told it, so straightforward and true. But just like him she didn�t remember how she had gotten there�she didn�t even try to remember any more�just lived her life in the Now and not in the Then.\nZyber looked up at the roof and looked at the reflection of the fire on the rock, giving the entire cave a red glow.\nSuddenly her internal computer gave a small warning, detecting another signature not to far from their current position. She looked surprised for a moment but then looked over at Rowdy, would he want to know that there were 2 strangers near his home? The way he had taken to Striker she guessed not, but it was important to let him know about it. *\n\n� Rowdy? There are two separate energy signatures located near by.�\n\n* She watched him for a moment, her voice had been soft as not to frighten him with the sudden sound of a voice in his cave again.\nZyber turned her head and then looked out of the opening in the cave, one energy signature suggested that one of the bots was a wolf (Lunarpine.), the other she couldn�t quite identify. With a small growl she then slowly stood up and walked over to the mouth of Rowdy�s cave, she put a hand on the side as she looked out at the night. She took in a deep breath and drew in the comfort of the night, a cool but warm wind moving her fur around a bit. Zyber then turned back towards Rowdy, a twinkle in her optics�the thought of running through the night alive in her veins. She smiled at him, she wanted to go and see who the new comers were to the land�but wondered if he would come with her.\nThe rising quarter moon Shawn down towards the mouth of Rowdy�s cave, outlining Zyber�s form in silver while turning the rest of her black/red.\nZyber then looked off into the night again, her instincts telling her to investigate the new bots. *\n\n� I am going to see whom these new strangers are, you are welcome to join me if you wish?�\n\n* With that she silently transformed into her beast mode, her cold blue eyes looked back at Rowdy for one last time before turning back towards the night and then her whole form disappearing from the mouth of the cave.\nZyber felt so free as she ran from her last position and down towards the dark forest, her white wolf form making her look like a ghost as she glided with ease down from Rowdy�s cave.\nShe entered into the forest and made her way easily towards the new bots on the other side, the strange wolf�s scent  (Lunapine) fresh and easy to follow. It wasn�t long until Zyber came over a rise and spotted the two bots, both of them seeming strange to her. She slowly moved a little closer towards the pair, her nose to the wind.\nZyber�s fur glistened in the moonlight as she came to rest on the tip of an outcrop from a rocky ridge, standing quietly and watching the strangers to the land at a distance but one in which they could see her if they looked her way. To one in which did not know her she looked like a ghost of the wild, mysterious and beautiful.\nAlmost as if a phantom from a mountain peak the she wolf threw her head back and howled longingly towards the moon, it was the time of the Hunt�the time for mountain phantoms to roam. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
