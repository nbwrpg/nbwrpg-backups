We&#39;re gonna need a diversion, to distract them a \nsmall\n&gt; bit.  Whee, Jume, and Skullgrin, you guys attack that area, and \nwait until\n&gt; they come out.  Actually, Skullgrin, you attack that other area, so \nthey\n&gt; have two areas to deal with, that side and that side.  Then, \nBlindfear, I\n&gt; want you to attack the entrance.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll be at the back, \nand I&#39;ll\n&gt; be calling in for reinforcements from the base!  And, just keep \nattacking\n&gt; until my word.  Oh, Skullgrin, Jume and Whee, when your attacking, \nslowly\n&gt; take your attack to the entrance, so then you&#39;ll all be at the \nentrance\n&gt; attacking.  It may seem like they outnumber you, but in fact, once \nthe\n&gt; reinforcements arrive, we&#39;ll do fine.  Then, we must move our way \ninside the\n&gt; base!  Some Decepticons will stay out here and battle these guys, \nand some\n&gt; others will start rampaging inside.  Now, let&#39;s do it.  Wait till I \nget\n&gt; where I need to be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Triggerhappy went behind the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now!&quot;  he said through comm, &quot;Blindfear, attack front, Jume, Whee \nand\n&gt; Skullgrin, attack the sides!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Skullgrin nodded, and JUme and Whee did also.  Jume and Whee went \nto their\n&gt; issued side, and Skullgrin went to his.  Skullgrin fired some shots \nat the\n&gt; base.  Jume and Whee also fired their weapons at it.  Triggerhappy \nwas ready\n&gt; to ask for reinforcements.  He decided to send a message to the \nwhole Dark\n&gt; Avian(technology, gotta love it!).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Decepticons, I repeat, all Decepticons!  We are carrying out\n&gt; infiltration of Maximal City!  The ones here right now are \nSkullgrin,\n&gt; Blindfear, Jume, and Whee!  I request that reinforcements arrive at \nmy\n&gt; location and attack as quick as possible!!!!!
