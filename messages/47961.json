I am sure you have heard of Megatron&#39;s latest escapade? Our \n mission is to get him... and slay him. He jeopardizes the Tripredacus \nCouncil&#39;s influence on the Predacons.

Of course, this was a quality \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; looked forward to exploit. He would make a great leader... after \n&gt; him. \n&gt; &gt; The only important thing was to be sure to have the black one on \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: I am glad to see you too, Shadow Star. I am here to give \n&gt; you a \n&gt; &gt; command. As you might know, I have been given Gorefeast&#39;s \nposition. \n&gt; As \n&gt; &gt; such, I am about to embark on a mission, and the council has given \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; free choice of my crew.

The \n&gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had looked at right after was Bleeder, Shadow Star&#39;s superior \n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They had both talked, and Tyrael had explained his reason&#39;s \nfor \n&gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice. Bleeder had been in agreement. Now, Tyrael had to \n&gt; announce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the principal interested...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   He went to the junior officer&#39;s quarters. He hoped the young \n&gt; &gt; &gt; officer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was there. After searching for a few minutes, he found the \n&gt; bot&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; door, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and pressed the button announcing him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Tyrael: I am Colonel Tyrael. I have come to meet with you, \n&gt; &gt; Shadow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Star.\n\n\n"}}
