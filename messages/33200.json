We go in fast and hard, take no \nprisoners, I want to establish ourselves as a strong fighting force. \nAfter the attack we will retreat, I am going to give a time limit on \nthis, we don&#39;t want to risk to much damage to our systems, yet. I \ngive you an hour to fight after I give the go ahead. There are plenty \nof weapons in the cache. YOu can have whatever you need.&quot;\n     He commed the Destrocons. &quot;I am going to need your flight \nabilities, report to the command room and we will discuss it.&quot;\n     He turned back to the rest of his troops, then directly to \nCygnar, &quot;Where is the weakest base on the North American continent? \nAnd is it true that you have established another base in what wil \nbecome Syria?
