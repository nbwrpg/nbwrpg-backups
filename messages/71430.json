But=\r\n keep in mind, it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a friend as well as a comrade by you=\r\nr side. I learned that many vorns ago when I started working with the Autob=\r\nots.

So there&#39;s no way he coudl have been there, and he wouldn&#39;=\r\nt have gone back over to them! So will pose this as taking place out in the=\r\n ship corridors. Thanks!\n\n    Also, I appreciate your posting, but it&#39;s sor=\r\nt of weird how you have each and every character of your&#39;s coming up, then =\r\ndoing something to me, then knowing each and every thing that happened to e=\r\nach adn every other one that did, and them all having the exact same opinio=\r\nns over on everyone as everyone else did. \n\n    Also, unless your characte =\r\nris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emphatically order him to do something=\r\n, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere far else after you for a setup. Sin=\r\nce it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to go back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice=\r\n now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s not especially fond of Tuscon, nor=\r\n him following someone else as well when I posd him trying to leave. So, if=\r\n going to go somewhere with him, please give me a cahnce to respond to it a=\r\nhead of time. It&#39;s two times you posed him extensively going with your char=\r\nacters when it was not in character for him to do so.\n\n    If your characte=\r\nrs have had interactions with him in the past or things I should know of, l=\r\net me know? As I have no idea where Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how t=\r\nhey would have remotely konwn of one another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly =\r\nthat Tuscon knows him from the past, when I have no idea of that.\n\n    So a=\r\ngain, if they&#39;ve had interactions as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic histo=\r\nry so I can respond appropriately. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere=\r\n wtih someone, either give me a chance to respond appropriately if he does =\r\nor not, or make it something like a specific order in the case someone is a=\r\n superior. And it&#39;s also rather weird how your characers come up from nowhe=\r\nre, all have the exact same opininos and back one another up to the hilt on=\r\n thier interactions and everything. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by =\r\nthis.\n\n    I understand I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much long=\r\ner, I just feel rather hemmed in on the character with what you&#39;re doing an=\r\nd am confused as to how things operate, and how you have all of your alts c=\r\nongregating and making me feel pressed into a corner.\n\n    Anyways, sorry i=\r\nf this is coming fof a bit too negative, thank you very much for the welcom=\r\ne here and for playing wtih me and interacting with Wheelie.\n\n    &lt;Back In =\r\nCharacter&gt;\n\n    Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at hi=\r\nm, &quot;What is this with all of you? You&#39;re back and forth whatever I do. This=\r\n is what Prime is, just a rank? It seems like it&#39;s just sort of dank. We ha=\r\nd four of five in a room, that&#39;s not a level of doom and gloom.&quot;\n\n    Then,=\r\n walking away from Tuscon, but looking behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with a=\r\nll of your friends, congrualtions on the promotion and to whatever ends. Bu=\r\nt we, we were never friends. We went back and forth in our ways, and I resp=\r\nect your orders for these days. But we&#39;re not here to have fun, we&#39;re here =\r\nto fight and run and gun.&quot;\n\n    Wheelie leaning against the wall, &quot;I&#39;ll wor=\r\nk wtih you, if you do tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is hell. I&#39;d prefer =\r\nto keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they try and be nice.=\r\n But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to do, or how you=\r\n&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew. So by al lmeans, give me some space, we&#39;re =\r\nhere to fight for the future of our race.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_002C_01CC3D02.9EF88DA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\ndir=3Dltr bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Ca=\r\nlibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Talon / WIndlord:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Talon smiled and kissed Tucson.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;******************************&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Windlord=E2=80=99s face turned serious and said =\r\n=E2=80=9CI reallywill miss that planet when \nwe leave, I born here...

He heaves a sigh and kneels down to \n  =\r\n  Wheelie.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; I was going to give you a lecture and a warni=\r\nng \n    but I realize you just comeback online after many vorns . You were =\r\nnot aware \n    of my change of status to Prime office and perhaps mistook m=\r\ne for my \n    previous status. I&#39;ll let it go this one time, Wheelie but ke=\r\nep in mind that \n    a Prime is a Prime no matter who they are. All right, =\r\nyou&#39;re free to roam \n    the Auto base now. Please try not to get sent to m=\r\ny office again, \n    okay?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With a smile of understanding,=\r\n Tucson opens the door \n    to let Wheelie go on his way. Once having let W=\r\nheelie free, he waits for \n    Talon with a light hearted smile on his face=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OOC - Uhm, I \n    posted Wheelie leaving your quarters an=\r\nd he never entered them in the first \n    place, then him heading out. So t=\r\nhere&#39;s no way he coudl have been there, and \n    he wouldn&#39;t have gone back=\r\n over to them! So will pose this as taking place \n    out in the ship corri=\r\ndors. Thanks!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, I appreciate your posting, \n    but it&#39;s sort of=\r\n weird how you have each and every character of your&#39;s \n    coming up, then=\r\n doing something to me, then knowing each and every thing \n    that happene=\r\nd to each adn every other one that did, and them all having the \n    exact =\r\nsame opinions over on everyone as everyone else did. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, \n    unl=\r\ness your characte ris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emphatically order \n=\r\n    him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere far else aft=\r\ner \n    you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to go bac=\r\nk to \n    Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s n=\r\not \n    especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well w=\r\nhen I \n    posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him,=\r\n please give \n    me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two time=\r\ns you posed him \n    extensively going with your characters when it was not=\r\n in character for him \n    to do so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If your characters have had int=\r\neractions with him in the \n    past or things I should know of, let me know=\r\n? As I have no idea where \n    Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they w=\r\nould have remotely konwn of one \n    another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly =\r\nthat Tuscon knows him from the past, \n    when I have no idea of that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;So again, if they&#39;ve had interactions as \n    NPC&#39;s, let me know their g=\r\neneric history so I can respond appropriately. If \n    he&#39;s going to be tol=\r\nd to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me a chance \n    to respond app=\r\nropriately if he does or not, or make it something like a \n    specific ord=\r\ner in the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rather weird \n    how y=\r\nour characers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same opininos \n    a=\r\nnd back one another up to the hilt on thier interactions and everything. I =\r\n\n    feel kind of wedged into a corner by this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I understand I&#39;m new=\r\n to \n    the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather hem=\r\nmed in on \n    the character with what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to h=\r\now things \n    operate, and how you have all of your alts congregating and =\r\nmaking me feel \n    pressed into a corner.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyways, sorry if this is=\r\n coming fof a bit too \n    negative, thank you very much for the welcome he=\r\nre and for playing wtih me \n    and interacting with Wheelie.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;Ba=\r\nck In \n    Character&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, =\r\ngazes over \n    at him, &quot;What is this with all of you? You&#39;re back and fort=\r\nh whatever I do. \n    This is what Prime is, just a rank? It seems like it&#39;=\r\ns just sort of dank. We \n    had four of five in a room, that&#39;s not a level=\r\n of doom and \n    gloom.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then, walking away from Tuscon, but lookin=\r\ng behind, &quot;I&#39;m glad \n    you&#39;re good with all of your friends, congrualtion=\r\ns on the promotion and to \n    whatever ends. But we, we were never friends=\r\n. We went back and forth in our \n    ways, and I respect your orders for th=\r\nese days. But we&#39;re not here to have \n    fun, we&#39;re here to fight and run =\r\nand gun.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wheelie leaning against \n    the wall, &quot;I&#39;ll work wtih you=\r\n, if you do tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is \n    hell. I&#39;d prefer to ke=\r\nep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they \n    try and be nice.=\r\n But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to \n    do, or ho=\r\nw you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew. So by al lmeans, give me some \n    spa=\r\nce, we&#39;re here to fight for the future of our race.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- =\r\nend group email --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot; width=\r\n=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white; CLEAR: both&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_002C_01CC3D02.9EF88DA0--\r\n\n"}}
