Hi, just reminding everybody that I control\n&gt;Optimus Prime. You never came to me with any sort of question, it is\n&gt;listed on the site as me controlling him. Could you please think of\n&gt;someone else to be instead of Optimus Prime? Cause he&#39;s kinda mine.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
