The two bots inside\nfrantically trying to get enough power to them to\nenter the atmospher of earth. The tall, lanky male bot\nfinally stood, nodding to his female counter-part,\nthen turning to the screen, said in a deep voice.*\n\n &quot; We are coming I.R.&quot;\n\n * The ship gave a jerk and began it&#39;s decent into the\natmosphere, the sheilds sputtering and dieing, giving\nthe ship full brunt of the atmospheric preassure. With\nthe hull and outer ship burning away, the two bots\nclimbed into thier stasis pods, sealing them off. The\nship passed the atmosphere, half disolved. Pieces of\nit scattering. It impacted the earth and came to rest\na half mile away from the Ark, their exact spot, they\nhad wanted to land. Smoke rose from the beaten and\nburned-out ship, sending out a beaken to anyone of\ntheir presence. The ship&#39;s program sputtered to life,\nsearching for two sutible life forms.*\n\n * Scanning..... Life-forms..Found*\n\n * The scanning program sparked and died. The two\nstasis pods hissed and slowly opened, showing a\nfemale, Black Panther and a male, Siberian Tiger. The\ntwo&#39;s eye&#39;s flutttered and came online, showing pure\ngreen. They sat up, and, looking at each-other smiled,\nshowing sharp teeth. They stood up on their new feet\nand initiated their scanners, probing for the spark\nthey came half a galaxy away to find.*\n\n * Spark..Found, Locked*\n\n * They gathered up two, small caskets in their teeth\nand started toward the signal. They walked and jogged\nthrough the forest, following the signal alone, and,\nstumbiling onto a clearing with a large ship in the\ncenter, stopped.*\n\n *Spark inside*\n\n* The male bot frowned, that looked maximal made, he\nturned to the female and nodded again. They dropped\ntheir loads and in almost perfect harmony said,*\n\n &quot;Snow Tech...&quot;\n &quot;Shadow Cat,&quot;\n\n &quot;MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n\n * They pressed the com-links on their breast\nplate&#39;s.*\n\n &quot;This is Snow Tech and Shadow Cat, We request\npermmision to enter?&quot;\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
