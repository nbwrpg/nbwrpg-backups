The sound of Gangon�s \nvoice was always welcoming, it giving her great comfort in the worst of \ntimes.\nShe then looked back up at Perndabot with the same smile, it then turning to \na sly one in which she was well known for. The sound of doubt in his voice \nwas not exactly what she would call welcoming but she didn�t expect over \nconfidence in herself either, but with her skills and past experience this \nmission was practically the easiest she had ever embarked upon.\nBrightBlade nodded as she took in his warning. It was very sensible but she \nknew that if he had any real doubts he could always turn back.\nShe then looked back towards Gangon�s spark as Prendabot had taken a step \ntowards her.  The spark beginning to go din with being separated from his \nbody.\nWith a sigh BrightBlade quickly took two pieces of a sphere from a \ncompartment in her leg and pressed them together, locks on either side \nfusing to each other to create a ball of clear materiel.\nIt was a device she was hoping to use on one of the Maximals, a stasis ball \nthat was designed to hold a single spark. She was hoping to bring back the \nspark of a Maximal to fuse within a Predacon protoform, thus creating \nanother soldier to fight in Hell Beasts forces. But it was obvious that she \nnow had to use the ball for a more better purpose, to keep her friend alive.\nWith a whooshing sound the ball opened, a light mist escaping from it as she \nheld it towards Gangon�s spark. It would sustain him for 48 days if she \nchose plenty of time to either locate his body or to find him a new one. But \nthis would have to do for now.\nBrightBlade smiled towards the spark and gestured with her head towards the \nopen stasis ball. *\n\n� In you get. It�ll keep you from fading and even repair what damage you�ve \nsustained. It�s only temporary. Just until I find your body or get you a new \none. You should still be able to communicate though.�\n\n* She then held the ball closer to him so that he could waste no time in \ngetting into it, she then would close the ball and place it back in her leg \ncompartment. Thus still being able to hear him, actually being inside her \nbody and all.\nBrightBlade then turned her head towards Perndabot as he asked her if Gangon \nwas coming, still holding him in one hand that ball in the other. She nodded \nand smiled up at him, careful not to move so that none of her curves could \nbe seen. *\n\n� Yes, he�s intended to come with us. I hope you don�t mind. I�m not one to \nabandon friends when they need me the most, a quality that most Predacons \nlack.�\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
