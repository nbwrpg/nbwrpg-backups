We were on the side of a building back \non Cybertron.  The ledge was slippery, but I didn&#39;t care. I just kept \nwalking with the others. It was night time, dark, and a few thrill \nseakers out for fun.  But someone shot at us and we tried to move out \nof the way.  I watched as one friend fall off the ledge.  It was like \nwatching a hologram piture show, but in slow motion.&quot;  she stopped \nfor a moment and looked at the floor.\n\n&quot;All I could do was watch.  I saw him fall to the water below.  I \nnever saw him again.  i don&#39;t know if he survived or not. But he was \ngone.  Then we were fired upon again.  I tried to move fast enough, \nbut I wasn&#39;t.  The ledge was shot out from under me and I fell. I saw \nthe world pass by like a blurr.  I looked at the ledge but my other \nfriends had gone.  I fell into the water.  It was like hitting \nsteal.&quot; she paused.\n&quot; I don&#39;t know how I got to the streets again, I just found myself \nwalking down the streets of Cybertron and not knowing how I got \nthere.&quot; she paused, &quot;but that&#39;s why I&#39;m terrified of heights.  I have \nbeen ever since that  night.&quot; \n\n\n"}}
