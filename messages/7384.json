He dropped it for now, it was probably a \ngrudge that aall the Maximals have against him. &quot;If Megatron took off \nthrough the woods I&#39;ll find him, and when I do he&#39;s slag.&quot; \nImmediately the wolf remembered another score he had to settle.

She discovered \nthat \n&gt; she just couldn&#39;t help but like him. Only, it was more \nthan &#39;like&#39;.  \n&gt; But she wasn&#39;t quite sure how much more than &#39;like&#39; it was, but she \n&gt; thought is was a whole lot more than &#39;like&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
