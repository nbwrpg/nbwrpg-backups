In the \nmeantime Iron Raptor said she�d RP Tav for me, and if Yanshosh needs \nHysteria for anything he can RP her^_^ I guess I�ll see you guys in two \nweeks! Oh, dcoburn, I�m not gonna acknowledge you in my post cause I won�t \nbe able to finish anything I start^_^ I�ll leave that to Carnage and IR)\n\nTavatron watched quietly as Dinobot continued to groom himself. The various \nshards of broken armor being tossed aside without a second thought. She \nbacked up a bit, doing her best to avoid the mech stained ground. She hated \nthe smell of the silver robotic fluid, not to mention the taste. Half the \ntime she wouldn�t even lick her own wounds. Tavatron sighed as she gazed \nskyward, watching the sun as it began it�s descent below the horizon. The \nsound of the babbling brook sending a slight shiver of relaxation through \nher body. Forget the base, she could spend the rest of her life right here.\n\nFinally Tavatron opened her eyes. Her gaze was met by a small puddle of \nfluid that had begun to form around her knees and lower legs. She hadn�t \nrealized Dinobot was bleeding this badly. He needed medical attention, and \nsoon. Tavatron transformed to beast mode, perhaps she would be able to get \nsome hunting done before they set out again. Food would help restore some of \ntheir lost strength. Tavatron, now on all fours, raised her snout towards \nthe darkening sky and let loose one long, endless howl. She was asking the \nwolves of the surrounding area if there was any large game nearby. A reply \nof several howls immediately sounded from deep within the surrounding trees. \nTavatron sighed, there was nothing to hunt but small rabbits and a few \nlarger birds. She just didn�t have the energy for a rabbit hunt.\n\nTavarton sat back on her haunches, her eyes eagerly searching the \nsurrounding trees for any signs of life. She hadn�t realized just how hungry \nshe was. A small snarl escaped her lips as she dropped to the ground. Her \njoints were still sore, but she was more or less repaired. Her internal \nsystems had done a thorough job of repairing her. She lifted an eye ridge as \nshe looked at Dinobot from the corner of her optic. For a second he seemed \nto be looking at her as well, but quickly averted his gaze. Perhaps he \ndidn�t want her to see what she already knew. He had to be concerned about \nhis welfare. Any �bot with the amount of damage he had sustained would be.\n\nTavatron growled softly, wondering why he wasn�t at least licking his \nwounds. Any predator worth their hunting prowess would know that the best \nway to stop the flow of blood was to lick the wound clean. She continued to \nlook Dinobot over. He was in pretty bad shape. His TM2 armor was quite \ndamaged, not to mention the various pieces of shrapnel that were most likely \nstill caught in his chest. The smallest pieces were the hardest to remove. \nTavatron�s ears perked as it dawned on her, he was a TM2! Why hadn�t she \nthought of it before? He didn�t have the organic compound necessary to clot \nhis blood. He probably had to let his wounds bleed out. That could be a \ncostly decision, but one he most likely had to accept:\n\n&quot;I am not going to let you bleed to death. There must be something I can \ndo?&quot;\n\nTavatron continued to lay a few feet from him, her paws stretched even \nfurther before her. She loved stretching in beast mode, feeling each muscle, \neach tendon, pulling beneath her organic skin. Tavatron sighed softly as she \ncontinued to watch Dinobot, concern written on her face. She already knew \nwhat she could do, but not necessarily what she wanted to do. Just the \nthought of tasting mech-fluid made her grimace. Tavatron sighed as she \nstood, took a deep breath, and walked toward Dinobot:\n\n&quot;Try to hold still, alright? I don�t want to do this anymore than you want \nme too, but I am not going to let you bleed to death.&quot;\n\nTavatron placed a firm paw on his back as she leaned her head down toward \nhis injured side. She quickly began licking away the excess fluid, doing her \nbest to clean the wound before the taste of fluid sent her into convulsions. \nTavatron finished in a matter of moments, but the taste still lingered. \nTavatron turned away from Dinobot as she lowered her head toward the ground, \nspitting out the silver fluid that coated her tongue. She ran toward the \nedge of the brook, dipping her snout in the cool water as she swallowed \nmouthfuls of water. Finally she just laid down beside the stream, she didn�t \nregret what she�d done, she just really didn�t like the taste of fluid. She \nnever had and she never will.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
