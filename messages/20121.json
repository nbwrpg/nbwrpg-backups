She fell forward\nand landed on her hands and knees. She turned her head, looking at\nLadyHawk, &quot;Why? I thought you were a friend?&quot;\n\nLady Hawk looked down at Squizzy, &quot;I am a friend,  but I can&#39;t risk my\nscience being turned into a weapon. She lowered herself to finish the\nmongoose but hesitated.\n\nSquizzy, felt sick to her stomach and light headed. She couldn&#39;t understand,\nwhy was this bot\nof science attacking her. &quot;I wanted to see the nature bots too.&quot; She fell\ndown and layed on her side. She felt disoriented and fearful.\n\nLady Hawk saw her error at the next moment. she couldn&#39;t let Zardus have the\nexperiments, and she couldn&#39;t allow Squizzy to stay here either. she tried\nto pick her up when Najah attacked.Lady Hawk wasn&#39;t trained as a warrior,\nshe was to wrapped up with Squizzy that she didn&#39;t see Najah until she was\nwrapped up in Najahs coils. Lady Hawk managed to get her talons up in time\nto block Najahs bite. Useing all her strength she held on for dear life,\ntrying to break the snakes hold on her. &quot;Snakes were supposed to be eaten by\nhawks, not the other way around.&quot; she thought as the snakes bite came\ncloser. She looked back towards Squizzy, she hoped the mongoose could handle\nthe snake for her unfortunately Najah had other ideas. One of those ideas\nseemed to involve a Hawk dinner.\n\nNajah started crush Lady HAwk&#39;s body as if he were a phyton. Lady Hawk was\nbeginning to feal like a recycled can. &quot;Would you stop already? we&#39;re\nsupposed to be on the same side.&quot; Somehow she knew that Najah probably\ndidn&#39;t care about sides. She tried to squirm with no effect. her only hope\nwas that someone on the alliance would pull the snake off. Najah tried again\nto bite her knowing that his mortal poyson would  do all work. The half Hawk\nsnapped forward trying to bite the snake. This creature needed to learn not\nto mess with royalty.\n\n\n ----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 05, 2000 12:01 PM\nSubject: Najah bites at Lady hawk\n\n\n&gt; ::Najah::\n&gt;\n&gt; Najah didn&#39;t like that no one over him kill the bird\n&gt; so that he, in his beast mode, moved quikcly and\n&gt; toward her and bite her while his snake-body involed\n&gt; her in a mortal hugg.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Demoliton::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He detached from War Machine, and went to bot mode.\n&gt; &gt; He fired on Lady\n&gt; &gt; Hawk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
