Cyclonus was not sure if\nit would be any time soon before it would.\n\nBehind Cyclonus the door opened and Scourge stepped in and looked\naround. &quot;Any news yet?&quot; His voice grumpy as he glanced at the view\nscreen Cyclonus was looking at.\n\n&quot;No Scourge.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice was calm and low, and it was obvious from\nhis tone that this was a common exchange between them. Cyclonus\npatiently waiting for any communication from the Earth, and Scourge\nimpatiently asking if there was any word. &quot;I am sure it will be soon.&quot;\n\nAs if on cue the console beeped to announce incomming data. Cyclonus\nlooked down at it as he checked the authenication codes and accepted\nthe feed. \n\nFor a long moment Cyclonus read as Scourge read over his shoulder.\nWords scrolled past them at dizzying speed. When it finally came to a\nstop Scourge sat down in a nearby chair and shook his head a small\nsmile on his face. \n\nCyclonus on the other hand stored the data on his own personal chip as\nwell as the base computers. He looked at Scourge, &quot;Have the soldiers on\nEarth keep an optic fastened to the Maximals at Atlantis. Let us know\nwhen they are to depart.&quot; \n\nCyclonus stood and smiled as he reached over and tapped a few keys on\nthe computer, &quot;We on the other hand have other things to accomplish.&quot; \n\nOn the wall the small viewscreen showed the coordinates of the Black\nFortress - it blinks once and then turned solid. \n\nCyclonus turned to Scourge, &quot;Come, we have much to accomplish. Prepare\nthe sweeps.&quot;\n\nScourge nodded almost eagerly as he followed Cyclonus through the doors\nexiting the chamber, already chattering orders on his radio.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
