I could do with a little spy work mysel=\r\nf, if I don&#39;t use my skills I&#39;ll lose my touch.  All right, I&#39;m in on it.&quot;\n=\r\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot;I agree.  Infiltration is the best method.  And to do it i=\r\nndirectly is even better.  Cheetor, Rat Trap, Nightshift, three of our best=\r\n infiltrators, who can virtually go in undetected.  Cheetor, Night Shift, y=\r\nou can probably cover the parameters in a shorter time span, so you will be=\r\n given the task of infiltrating the fortress from a wider vantage point.  R=\r\nat Trap, you will take a more direct course through any small space you can=\r\n find at the fortress.  But keep in mind, first, you want to access the com=\r\nplex, get a feel for your surroundings, and remain silent, so is not to be =\r\nsuspected too early in the game.&quot;\n\nRat Trap salutes.\n\n&quot;Gotycha Wheels.  Not=\r\n one peep outa me or one action till you say so.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks to Che=\r\netor.\n\n&quot;Meanwhile, we might be able ta draw up a map for Lord Elder&#39;n Tucso=\r\nn.  We get the lay of the land down, and we got a good chance at this missi=\r\non.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to them.\n\n&quot; You guys are still gonna need backup.=\r\n And since Tucson&#39;s needed here, because he&#39;s strong enough ta guard the Ar=\r\nk, we should definitely have some solid protection out there for you.&quot;\n\nShe=\r\n turns her gaze over to Rodimus as if to drop a very subtle hint.\n\n&quot; And wh=\r\no better ta provide that than you.  I know you can do it Rodimus Prime, It&#39;=\r\ns like Tucson said, with faith in each other, we can do anything.&quot;\n\nTucson =\r\nsmiles.\n\n&quot; She&#39;s right, Rodimus, if anyone can be a stronghold for this mis=\r\nsion, it&#39;s you.  She has faith in you, and so do I.  This may prove to be a=\r\n challenging mission but I know you are more than capable of doing it.  So,=\r\n as a fellow Prime, will you do me the honor of accepting her request?&quot;\n\n--=\r\n- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Well, you heard it straight from Lo=\r\nrd Elder, Straight Shot.

Oh well, you&#39;re right. We got enough power here to=\r\n take down Hydras if we put our sparks to it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap grins.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Oooooh A big brain storm is hitting my tiny processor... When in doub=\r\nt, send the little guys in ta do the dirty work. I could go with Cheetor, a=\r\nnd like I did before, sneak into the small spaces and have myself a little =\r\nfun... Ya know, cross a few wires.... Technical difficulties...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ni=\r\nght Shift steps forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Or try ta connect with their central comp=\r\nuter system from here&#39;n ya know, infiltrate without physcially infiltrating=\r\n....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap bounces with excitement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ooooh, I like that=\r\n.

After a=\r\nll, sometimes we have to think off the pavement don&#39;t we?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor was=\r\n looking decidedly excited as talk was centered around\n&gt; infiltrating the P=\r\nredacon base, his optics blazed slightly as he\n&gt; nodded. His smile dimmed a=\r\n bit though when the talk turned to\n&gt; technological infiltration methods as=\r\n his brow furrowed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder on the other hand just nodded as the ot=\r\nhers talked. It\n&gt; looked as if he were about to say something when his atte=\r\nntion\n&gt; suddenly distracted by a chirp on the communications board, he walk=\r\ned\n&gt; over to it and began to type in a series of commands and listen to\n&gt; s=\r\nomething.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor looked at Elder for a moment as he worked and then b=\r\nack at\n&gt; Tuscon and Rat Trap, crossing his arms over his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t you =\r\nhave\n&gt; to have some sort of physical link to thier system?&quot; Cheetor said,\n&gt;=\r\n although it is obvious that his knowledge of electronics and hacking\n&gt; was=\r\n somewhat limited. &quot;Maybe we still need to infiltrate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pre=\r\nston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
