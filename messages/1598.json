She slowly raised her head and carefully flexed a paw, \nwatching the organic muscles flex and pull beneath her fur. She yawned, \nexposing multiple small, gleaming teeth. Tavatron sighed, she was still \ntired, but her hunger was greater than her need for further rest.\n\nTavatron&#39;s fur rustled softly as she stood, her stomach growling. She closed \nher optics, still not fully awake. Tavatron gasped as a mirage of images \nbombarded her senses. The Alliance, Maximals, Predacons... all lying on a \nbroken and charred battlefield...\n\nTavatron&#39;s optics snapped open. What was that? Tav shook her head, \ndispelling the images as quickly as they had appeared. She looked down at \nDinobot, he looked so... so...\n\nDinobot lay with a look of emptiness on his face, as if he lived in a world \nof dreamless nights and battle-scarred days. Tavatron sighed, didn&#39;t he \ndream? Dream of something better? Something... more?\n\nDreams of a better life were the only thing that got her through the last \nwar. Without her dreams she would have gone offline stellercycles ago.\n\nTavatron placed a gentle paw on Dinobot&#39;s shoulder:\n\n&quot;Dinobot?&quot; Tav whispered. She gently shook him. She didn&#39;t know why she \nwanted to wake him, maybe just to be sure he was alive. He had come so close \nto death, and she too close to losing a friend.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
