I&#39;m wondering how he could \n&gt;possibly be\n&gt;   winning the council, look what he sent, it&#39;s right below this. \n&gt;Apparently,\n&gt;   I&#39;m the same person as everyone who wants to use Jume in their posts. \n&gt;Hedge\n&gt;   is incredibly immature to keep this going on and on. The word incredibly\n&gt;   should be emphasized...\n&gt;     &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   (Paranoia cannot hinder ones effect in the Council, Hedge will make a \n&gt;fine\n&gt;   Councilmember.  Just look at Yan.  He&#39;s still frantically searching for \n&gt;who\n&gt;   egged and TPed his house :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
