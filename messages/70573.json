He sighs heavilly, as his \n&gt; chest rises and falls with each breath.  The light in his chest continues \n&gt; to pulsate, and even brighter than before.  Straight Shot, who was perhaps \n&gt; the clossest to Tucson as well as Rat Trap, could now feel something they \n&gt; had not yet felt before.  Something deep down in their hearts, a power \n&gt; unlike any other, yet simple enough where those who had a heart could feel \n&gt; it. They look to each other.  Straight Shot puts a hand on his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I ain&#39;t never felt like this before but I definitely am think&#39;n what \n&gt; you&#39;re think&#39;n.  No one should have ta fight a battle on their own, and if \n&gt; Wheels is gonna win this, he needs our support big time.  Notice how his \n&gt; chest glows brighter, when we get closser ta the glass? That&#39;s what he \n&gt; needs, he needs ALL of us ta believe in him, it&#39;s in our hearts, not in \n&gt; our weapons.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He faces everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Guys, Wheels is fightn&#39; a battle of his life in there, and we all know \n&gt; that no great leader should ever have ta believe that he&#39;s alone in \n&gt; battle.  He&#39;s got what it takes in his heart ta stay a float, but, he \n&gt; needs somethn&#39; extra ta go the distance completely.  It&#39;s like he said, we \n&gt; all got somethn&#39; those creepoids don&#39;t have.  And it&#39;s so simple that even \n&gt; organics have it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride puts a hand over his chest.  He was very concerned for Tucson \n&gt; and Rodimus.  So much so that he had been trying to hold back a tear but \n&gt; one just simply escapes and cascades down his faceplate.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re right Rat Trap, no great warrior fights alone.  We can&#39;t let \n&gt; Tucson and Rodimus die, we just can&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot steps forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And we&#39;re not going to either.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift could hear what was going on, and like Tucson he was a \n&gt; fighter.  And a fighter with a heart bigger than his own chest cavity.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No great warrior fights alone.  Tucson, if you can hear us, big guy, \n&gt; we&#39;re all behind ya a hundred percent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s at this time, when a simple red light begins to pulsate in Night \n&gt; Shift.  The same thing happens to Straight Shot, Rat Trap, and \n&gt; Quickstride.  And spiritually, they pour their hearts and souls into \n&gt; hoping that Tucson can pull through and succeed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Elita started to sob and she opened a com link and said to her dad &quot;Dad \n&gt;&gt; &gt; wake\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up...

Your father is under the care of the best doctors we\n&gt;&gt; have, and we have Tuscon sharing his power with him to give him the\n&gt;&gt; strength to hold on.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silverbolt glances over at Tuscon and Rodimus, &quot;See look.&quot; he pointed\n&gt;&gt; at Tuscon&#39;s glowing chest and the energy that seemed to be radiating\n&gt;&gt; from it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Before anyone could think, in his state of unconsciousness, Tucson \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extends\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his hand out as far as he can, hoping that it will touch upon \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hand, even if it were only his fingers. He begins to talk in his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sleep.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The distance that seperates Tuscon from Rodimus is fairly short, only\n&gt;&gt; a few feet. He is just outside of arm&#39;s reach. Legacy glanced over at\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon as his brain wave patturn indicated that he was rising up into\n&gt;&gt; a more wakeful state of sleep for some reason. He moved quickly as he\n&gt;&gt; saw Tuscon&#39;s hand reaching for Rodimus snf stepped around the beds . .\n&gt;&gt; .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Just - a hand - a - way. Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He fights hard to extend his arm far enough to attempt to feel \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hand.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy was about to touch Tuscon&#39;s hand, pehpas help him make the\n&gt;&gt; contact when several of the tendrils that lay on Rodimus, some of the\n&gt;&gt; last few reached out and grabbed hold of Tuscon&#39;s arm! A shock of\n&gt;&gt; energy went through it as it glowed blue for a moment, then red and\n&gt;&gt; then began to settle down into a color that was unsettling close to\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon&#39;s color.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Quickly!&quot; Legacy said to bump and Santon, his voice louder than\n&gt;&gt; normal, &quot;This tendril must be severed from Tuscon&#39;s arm.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With a nod from Santon, Bump came over with a laser cutter and began\n&gt;&gt; working on it as Santon continued to work on Rodimus. This proceedure\n&gt;&gt; was proving to be far more difficult then he had at first anticipated.\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile Tuscon&#39;s form goes limp as he fell back into the deep states\n&gt;&gt; of sleep.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
