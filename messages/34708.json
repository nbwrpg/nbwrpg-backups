Let me begin.&quot; His translucent \n&gt; corporal body begins to shimmer as he recounts what he and the \n&gt; other Ikoto had said. &quot;We, the Ikoto, would like to propose a bet, \nor \n&gt; gamble you could say, on the fate of that planet, Earth. We \n&gt; propose that the Ikoto chose a group of sentient beings, like the \n&gt; ones you already have messed with, and put them on the planet. \n&gt; There they will be empowered with tasks, tasks of utmost \n&gt; importance in their minds. The group that the Ikoto choose will \n&gt; have to defeat your group, and gain control of the planet. Likewise, \n&gt; your chosen ones will have to defeat the bots chosen by the Ikoto. \n&gt; If our side succeeds, we will do what we will with the planet,&quot; \n&gt; continued Azafroth knowing full well that the Vok knew what the \n&gt; Ikoto would do, &quot;and if your side succeeds, then we will leave.&quot; The \n&gt; Ikoto&#39;s body shimmers in cruel delight at the game, knowing that \n&gt; their choice of chosen robots was the ultimate irony. Azafroth \n&gt; emanated a cold amused smile. Uokarase buts into the telepathik \n&gt; war zone, and put mental pressure on the Vok representative, \n&gt; &quot;Well, what do you say?&quot; Uokarase&#39;s thoughts speed intently \n&gt; around the groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 15 May 2001, at 6:07, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::The Vok::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If Voks frowned, this one would have.
