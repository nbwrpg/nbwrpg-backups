Remember, Megatron and the rest scanned dinosaur bones to get t=\r\nheir shapes. Although I will allow for a small area where time has &#39;forgott=\r\non&#39; things and maybe a FEW to still be around in hidden nooks and crannies,=\r\n but there are no where NEAR enough on the Earth as a whole to account for =\r\nthe numbers Nightshift and Rat Trap or the numbers that Hydras and his team=\r\n just faced down. \n\nHow did they get here? Are there more, and what does th=\r\nis mean for old Earth? \n\nStay tuned. \n\n- Preston\n\n\n"}}
