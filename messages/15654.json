Ramulus, if you&#39;ve been sick before, you&#39;ll definity be \nsick now. There&#39;s nothing like entering an atmosphere. It&#39;s worse \nthan leaving. And we don&#39;t even know if what we have will hold. I&#39;ll \nsend a long message to the Ark. I hope it will make it. It&#39;ll \nprobably come in cracky, but they&#39;ll understand.&quot;\n\nBrix opened a channel.\n\n&quot;Ark, this is the shuttle Iron Ram. Onboard we have Brix, Fliq and \nRamulus. We have completed our mission on the moon to collect parts \nto rebuild The Ark. Please be prepared for our arrival.&quot;\n\nBrix began descent.......\n\n\n"}}
