He had \n&gt; also listened to Lord Elder and thought it was best to allow him to do \n&gt; what he needed to do.  With Tallon and Perceptor in his cab, he was more \n&gt; than content and rolls at a good reasonable speed with the two of them in \n&gt; his cab.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thank you Perceptor, I&#39;m honored to have you with us.  Now, this is what \n&gt; I call valuable, having friends among you through the best and worst of \n&gt; times, knowing that your comrades are willing to make a great effort to \n&gt; preserve what is most precious, is something even the most priceless of \n&gt; articles can never hold an ounce of wealth to.  Tallon, after hearing how \n&gt; you became one of us, it honors me to see how much you have evolved and \n&gt; for that my compassion for you will never die.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He thinks for a moment, about Hydras, and gathers his words carefully.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I doubt very much that Hydras has any capacity to feel the compassion \n&gt; that all of us are capable of feeling.  I know that will be a downfall for \n&gt; him, because without compassion there can be no loyalty, no honor, and \n&gt; most certainly no assurance of victory.  And without those elements, I \n&gt; doubt very much he will be able to hold his place on the upper hand for \n&gt; much longer.  We have to gather our forces, come together as one, and only \n&gt; then will we be able to take back what is rightfully ours and preserve \n&gt; what is remaining of our planet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With his words he comes to a slow stop.  His sonar systems could only \n&gt; carry him to a certain range, but then realizes that he&#39;s out of range for \n&gt; proper echolocation system function.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tallon, I&#39;m out of range for my sonar system.  Could you take my wheel \n&gt; for me?  I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone or any of you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson opens the passenger&#39;s side door for Perceptor, hearing that he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on that side. He was happy to have passengers, because to him, having \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comrades around was a great comfort.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Tuscon opened his door to let Talon, Perceptor and Lord Elder in,\n&gt;&gt; Elder just waved Tuscon on, &quot;No, I will need to talk Cheetor alone.\n&gt;&gt; Just because he has yet to come to know Perceptor here, does not give\n&gt;&gt; him leave to talk to you as he wishes is. I will pull him aside to\n&gt;&gt; talk to him. I&#39;ll get back to you.&quot; Elder chuckled, &quot;Cheetor should be\n&gt;&gt; okay, Ramulus is the one that may need more time than most. He has not\n&gt;&gt; been one to trust anyone.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder turned aside to catch up with Cheetor who was walking off to one\n&gt;&gt; side, although sullen, still had a good pace. Elder was forced to jog\n&gt;&gt; for a moment and lay a comforting hand on the young Maximal&#39;s shoulder\n&gt;&gt; and pull him to a stop. The two began walking together at a somewhat\n&gt;&gt; slower pace talking in low tones.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
