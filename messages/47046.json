Time for tactical plan. The area we&#39;re going to \noccupy is on the south-east side of the Etna Volcano. It&#39;s about 6 \nklicks from the mouth of the volcano. It&#39;s a rocky place, and a little \nslopy as well. Be careful though. Geological reports state it is still \nactive, and lava holes could be still soft. Anachronox and Jetstorm, \nyou will act as the vanguard. I&#39;m counting on both of you to secure \nthe hotspot if we are not welcome. The Prophets will drop 1 minute \nafter you. They&#39;ll relieve you if we are attacked. Understood? As for \nme, I&#39;ll land the ship one klickk farther and join the fray with the \nseeds. Questions?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The same warmth engulfs Belthassan. One moment he was passing out, \nthe \n&gt; next, he was fully able bodied. He stood up slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: Thank you, friend. This was truly... energizing!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, Gesper, we are going on potentially enemy territory. This is \n&gt; operation GardenParty. We are supposed to plant fruits and keep the \n&gt; enclave until we can harvest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gesper nods and unstraps the device. Belthassan does so too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: Daemos, everyone is okay. Please proceed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: I read you.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship accelerates towards greece.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; -- Anachronox --\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anachronox straps on the box that Melchana tosses him and presses \n&gt; &gt; his hand to it. &quot;What is supposed to happen Melchana?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Melchana: Follow me!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She grabs Gesper and drags him the nearest she can to the \npiloting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; room. She leaves him on the floor, goes into the room, and \nbrings \n&gt; &gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some sort of techno-organic &quot;metal&quot; box.
