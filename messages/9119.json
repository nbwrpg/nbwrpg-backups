She placed her hands on the side of his head and focused on him. \n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Keep your mind quiet, &lt;/EM&gt;she said to Stingtra. &lt;EM&gt;Don&#39;t interfere. &lt;/EM&gt;She went into Quickstrike&#39;s mind, fighting through&nbsp;the images of his past that screamed at her earlier. She darkened it out, going deeper into his mind, telling him to stay calm and speak to him, to tell her what happened. She felt his skittishness, almost demanding to leave him alone and get away. She argued back that she was there to help, and if he didn&#39;t let go, he would be in permit stasis lock. After that, he reluctantly let go, and told her. \n&lt;P&gt;She saw the images of the dark waters, Stingtra, the Vok symbols, and the tentacle-like arm that had him, that kept on dragging him. She felt just as upset as he was, feeling for a few seconds that it had her too. She dimmed to optics until they had them closed. \n&lt;P&gt;She went into his mind further, to where KitKat said the wolf was. She saw the wires, she saw the ground that didn&#39;t seem normal. She held his head tight, trying not to let go. She had to know. If this little bot was so valuable, she had to know in order to help him. \n&lt;P&gt;She hung in there with him, feeling his feelings and almost feeling his pain. She saw the wolf being built, and it was put to life because of his energy. Then it dawned---it was going to use him. She forced herself more, but Primus she wanted out. \n&lt;P&gt;The wolf, the third wolf. The heavy furred, big wolf. She heard him screaming &lt;EM&gt;Get out of here! I&#39;ll deal with this thing! Go!&lt;/EM&gt; \n&lt;P&gt;He saved them. He saved Quickstrike&#39;s sanity. \n&lt;P&gt;Wildfire let go, freeing herself, and gasped. He crawled away from him and stood up, walking away from a few steps. He held her chest and looked at Stingtra. \n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;He&#39;s lucky, &lt;/EM&gt;she said to her. &lt;EM&gt;He&#39;ll live. If it wasn&#39;t for Rowdy Wolf, he would of became theirs. They had his mind, but when he was taken away, the link was broken. Be grateful for that. Keep him in the CR for the moment. He&#39;ll be all right in a few megacycles. But take him out of it later. He needs to be with the others.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
