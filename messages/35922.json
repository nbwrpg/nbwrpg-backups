The idea is to get inside the Trainer \ndefenses.  First we&#39;re sending the Destrocons and Halucigen in to cause a \nruckus.  They need to go in with a show.  We want them to know that the \ndistraction is coming.&quot;  He turns to Ramjet and Halucigen.  &quot;That means that \nif you have Guiledart&#39;s signal maskers they must be left here.  The last \nthing we need is for them to know we can hide from them.  You are to bombard \nthe shields with everything you&#39;ve got.  Make them think it&#39;s the real \nattack.  We need to be under the shields within ten minutes after the first \nattack.  We then come around and flank them.  This gives them no where to \nrun.&quot;\n\n"}}
