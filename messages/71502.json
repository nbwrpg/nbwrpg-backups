I must&#39;ve=\r\n ended up there so many times that I lost count.

Ratchet was aware of=\r\n that, and he never got agitated when I came in.  But what was worse, I&#39;d n=\r\never hear the end of it from Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.  Slag, those two we=\r\nre always rank&#39;n on me.  But I tried ta ignore &#39;em.  Then one day, Ohh this=\r\n is sweet, one day it happened again and I wound back up in Ratchet&#39;s offic=\r\ne. Tucson was mak&#39;n a delivery of supplies before he got shot blind, and th=\r\nose two were pull&#39;n their scrap on me.  Well, not only did he hear them, he=\r\n saw them do&#39;n it and slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson that time, be=\r\ncause he had the look of destruction in his eyes.  Now mind ya, they knew b=\r\netter not ta scrap around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real good if they =\r\ndid.  All they had ta do was look into his optics and they turned around an=\r\nd apologized ta me without a single word outa Tucson&#39;s mouth.  After that, =\r\nit never happened again.&quot;\n\n  He sighs gently.\n\n  &quot; Happy ta say that there =\r\nwas never any ridicule ever said about anyone after that.  Optimus was glad=\r\n about that, so he let Tucson&#39;s temper slide somewhat.  It kept the speedst=\r\ners in line and guys like us, Hound, Trail Breaker, and Beach Comber were h=\r\nappy not ta get ranked on because of our lack of speed.  And definitely no =\r\none ever messed with Ratchet.  Ohh no, that was considered taboo.

I \n  =\r\nsure hated those guys, I wasn&#39;t as fast as they were and they knew it.&nbsp=\r\n; \n  So of course they&#39;d always chose me as their target.&nbsp; Ratchet was=\r\n aware \n  of that, and he never got agitated when I came in.&nbsp;

Then one \n  day, Ohh this is sweet, one day it happened aga=\r\nin and I wound back up in \n  Ratchet&#39;s office. Tucson was mak&#39;n a delivery =\r\nof supplies before he got shot \n  blind, and those two were pull&#39;n their sc=\r\nrap on me.&nbsp; Well, not only did \n  he hear them, he saw them do&#39;n it an=\r\nd slag, you didn&#39;t wanna be around Tucson \n  that time, because he had the =\r\nlook of destruction in his eyes.&nbsp; Now mind \n  ya, they knew better not=\r\n ta scrap around with him because he&#39;d slag &#39;em real \n  good if they did.&n=\r\nbsp; All they had ta do was look into his optics and they \n  turned around =\r\nand apologized ta me without a single word outa Tucson&#39;s \n  mouth.&nbsp; Af=\r\nter that, it never happened again.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;He sig=\r\nhs gently.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&quot; Happy ta say that there was n=\r\never any ridicule ever said about anyone \n  after that.&nbsp; Optimus was g=\r\nlad about that, so he let Tucson&#39;s temper slide \n  somewhat.&nbsp; It kept =\r\nthe speedsters in line and guys like us, Hound, Trail \n  Breaker, and Beach=\r\n Comber were happy not ta get ranked on because of our lack \n  of speed.&nb=\r\nsp; And definitely no one ever messed with Ratchet.&nbsp; Ohh no, \n  that w=\r\nas considered taboo.&nbsp; Maan I sure miss those times.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Jul 21, 2=\r\n011, at 3:11 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@hot=\r\nmail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...&quot;&gt;airly2002@...=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&gt; \n  wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE type=3D&quot;ci=\r\nte&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n    &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n    &lt;DIV dir=3D=\r\nltr&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 1=\r\n2pt&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;Nightlight:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;=E2=80=9CI=\r\n=E2=80=99m very lucky to have Rodimus in my life=E2=80=9Dsaid Nightlight =\r\n=E2=80=9CThat and \n    the birth of Elita were the best things that happene=\r\nd in my life=E2=80=9D&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV \n    style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT=\r\n-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; =\r\nTEXT-DECORATION: none&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt tahoma&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT size=3D3 face=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND:=\r\n #f5f5f5&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dmagicquartz@... \n    href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;Sandy Panico&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:=\r\n&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, July 19, 2011 8:50 AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: MEdic B=\r\nay&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV \n    style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; =\r\nFONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n    style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-=\r\nCOLOR: #f5f5f5&quot; size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT \n    style=3D&quot;BACKGROUN=\r\nD-COLOR: #f5f5f5&quot; size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!-- |**|end egp ht=\r\nml banner|**| --&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;Nightshift turns his head to Nightlight and reac=\r\nhes out to put a \n    friendly hand on hers, to show his support.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n   =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&quot; It&#39;s okay, Bump knows what he&#39;s do&#39;n.&nbsp; I=\r\nn no time you&#39;ll be back \n    on your feet bust&#39;n Predacon and Decepticon a=\r\nft from here back ta \n    Cybertron.&nbsp; And none of those jokers are gon=\r\nna think twice about mess&#39;n \n    with you again.
