It looked more like a well dressed \nprison cell to her. She turned and looked at Chordate. &quot;Thank you \nagain. Here, as a sign of trust.&quot; She pulled a long bladed dagger out \nof her wing sheath. &quot;Take this and know I have only one left for \nprotection.&quot; SHe turned and walked into the room.  She could have \nbanged her head against the wall for giving up her only other blade \nand letting him know that she had only one blade left on her. She \nfelt like a fool for just walking into the room.  She had to help \nVulois, but she still felt foolish for being stupidly honest. It left \nher at a disadvantage. And she knew it.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Chordate/Smokescreen:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chordate and Smokescreen lead her to a room in the aft of the craft \n(near the \n&gt; back of the ship).
