She smiled, &quot;Yeah, Megatron will make short work out of \nher.  That stuff I gave her will hit her like a ton of bricks.  Then \nshe will tell him everything.&quot;she chuckled, &quot;No matter how strong she \nis, she will feel very happy in a few moments.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dracona just lay there and started to laugh.
