Too \nmany rules makes for a sad rpg, but oposite to that, too few also \nmakes for a sad rpg. We&#39;ve brought rule creating to where it is now, \nand we don&#39;t really want to create many more rules. There is no \nrule about naming other people&#39;s characters, but there is a rule \nabout calling their characters by their names if the names haven&#39;t \nbeen said. There is no rule about naming a new element, but that \nisn&#39;t the problem, it is what the element can to that makes us \nquestion your motives. There is no rule about having a base around \nthe moon, but likewise, there isn&#39;t a rule that says that it would be \nallowed. Since the council now know of what you want to do, the \nwe can talk about it, and decide what to allow, and what not to. \nThere are more unspoken rules, things that you just don&#39;t do, than \nwritten ones. From now on, I suggest you ask the council about \nanything that isn&#39;t (or is) in the rules. Even if it&#39;s not there, it could \nstill be disallowed, and we don&#39;t want to have you start posting \nabout something absurd and causing an uproar like what happened \nwith the Alliance story.\n\nAlso, read the post entitled &quot; - A - u - t - o - b - o - t - s - &quot; written \nby me, there&#39;s an ooc message after it that concerns you. \nHopefully, you will find it helpful. =)\n\nOn 31 Jul 2001, at 22:37, dewboy30816@... wrote:\n\n&gt;  I&#39;ve already read the rules.

On another rpg I wrote for my first\n&gt; entree that I had barely survived 2 years on the planet Nagas. By the\n&gt; way I&#39;ll go read over them,but I&#39;m pretty sure there are no rule\n&gt; against naming other players characters, naming a new element(I&#39;ll do\n&gt; that later), or declaring that the moon is really a giant robot that I\n&gt; may later use as a base(I just want to know if you can list it on the\n&gt; map).\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
