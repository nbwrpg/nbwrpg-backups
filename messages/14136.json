She could feel \nher energy slipping away.  But she wasn&#39;t going to let these maximals \ntake her base away and hurt any more of her team members.\nShe was leaking badly.  She kept firing.  She started feeling numb in \nher legs and arms.  Her torso wasn&#39;t hurting as much as it was. the \npain was going away.\n\nShe opened her link,&quot;Drillbit, just in case, I love you.&quot;  She closed \nher link and stood up on wobbly legs.  She stood out infront of the \nbase and yelled at the maximals. &quot;YOU LEAVE US ALONE.  YOU TOOK TWO \nOF MY FRIENDS, AND YOU&#39;LL TAKE NO MORE WHILE I&#39;M ALIVE!&quot;  She opened \nfire on them.  She shot 4 grenades and shot her rifle at them.  She \naimed at the Chosen ones and Deemos.  She shot two grenades at \nBlender and Stronghold. \n\n\n"}}
