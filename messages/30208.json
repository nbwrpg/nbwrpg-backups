She felt like herold \nself again.  She came to a small pod which appeared to have been there for a \nlong time. She looked around, but didn&#39;t smell any other bots near by.  She \ntranformed into bot mode and checked out the pod.  She smiled and wondered \nif it was the answer to her situation. &quot;Perhaps I can use this to fix up my \nlittle cruiser.&quot;  She opened up a panel and stuck her hand inside, trying to \nfind the release mechanism for the propulsion ciruits.  She pulled her hand \nback as she felt something sharp puncture her skin.  She saw a strange \nspider biting her arm.  &quot;Get off me you little insect.&quot;(yes I know a spider \nis an arachnid and not an insect)\nShe threw it to the ground and stepped on it, crushing it under her foot.  \nShe sneered at the pod. &quot;I&#39;ll not touch that thing again if it&#39;s going to \nbite me back like that.&quot;\nWith that, she transformed into leopard mode and continued on her way.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
