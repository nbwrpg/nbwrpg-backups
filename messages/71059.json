I&#39;ve worked with the control box b=\r\nefore and about this bomb, I haven&#39;t defused one in a long time but I do kn=\r\now how to. It&#39;s a good thing I paid attention in the technological training=\r\n sessions.&quot;\n\nHe climbs up to the control box, and gently opens the door, vi=\r\na a manual button on the side.  He looks at the inner workings and assesses=\r\n what needs to be done.  \n\n&quot;Oh boy..  Okaaay, well, here&#39;s what I think guy=\r\ns..  The wiring appears to have been altered somewhat, which means whoever =\r\nour intruder is, is rather skilled in this field.  But, it doesn&#39;t mean it =\r\ncan&#39;t falter.  I overheard Tucson talking about trying to disrupt this with=\r\n a sonar wave, and truthfully, I think it&#39;s our best shot. After that, I ca=\r\nn get to the bomb and stop it from going off.&quot;\n\nUproar nodds.\n\nWell, there =\r\nya have it Leo ll.  It&#39;s up ta the boss ta step in first.  I hope he&#39;s clos=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nOutside the Ark, Tucson now finds himself within range to execute the =\r\nsonar disruption plan.  He begins to transmit while enroute.\n\n&quot;All right, T=\r\nucson to Rodimus, and Legacy.  I am within range and transmitting now.  You=\r\n should begin to see a disruption in the Ark&#39;s systems in the form of stati=\r\nc and audio interference.  Once you see that, it&#39;s time to move in and quic=\r\nkly regain control of the mainframe.   This should also bring our enemy out=\r\n of hiding, once realizing what is happening. It will be your opportunity t=\r\no seize and immobilize him.&quot;\n\nRat Trap senses the wave.\n\n&quot;Owww, Wheels, is =\r\nit supposed ta hurt our ears?&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\nI&#39;m sorry Rat Trap, I know, =\r\nI did not have time to configure a saftey buffer for the transmission.  I a=\r\nppologize for any pain any of you feel, and now suggest that all of you tur=\r\nn off your audio sensors now.  That goes for you as well, Rodimus, Legacy, =\r\neveryone.  This transmission is going to cause more than just a mild disrup=\r\ntion, it may also cause you moderate to severe discomfort.\n\nThe sonar wave =\r\ngains in strength, as Rat Trap does as told.  The ground beneath them begin=\r\ns to vibrate with the transmission yet, Tucson seems to continue driving ov=\r\ner it at a steady speed.\n\nNight Shift steadies himself on the shakey ground=\r\n beneath his tires.\n\n&quot;Woahh, that&#39;s some heavy sonar you&#39;re puttn&#39; out big =\r\nguy..  Let&#39;s hope this works.&quot;\n\nTucson knew he would have to amplify the wa=\r\nve.  He now activates his built in amplifiers to do so.\n\n&quot; Get ready, I&#39;m a=\r\nmplifying the transmission.&quot;\n\nUpon doing that, the ground vibrates just a t=\r\nad more.  Pebbles dance in all directions as Tucson comes closer and closer=\r\n to the Ark.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hmm, I wonder...

As the two approached\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; position they could both see the red be=\r\nams of the two&#39;s targeting\n&gt; sensors before they actually came into view.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; As Perceptor came around the corner Rodimus&#39; and Ramulus pointed their\n=\r\n&gt; weapons at him for a moment and then stopped. Rodimus smiled sheepishly,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Sorry Perceptor, its old habit.&quot; Lowering their weapons Rodimus continue=\r\nd,\n&gt; &quot;I take it that Nightlight is out of danger?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus talked R=\r\namulus continued to look around, peering down around the\n&gt; corner. &quot;I don&#39;t=\r\n like this, something is wrong.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I agree.&quot; Rodimus said as he got a c=\r\nall from Tuscon . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tucson Prime to Rodimus Prime, =\r\nover. As soon as I am close enough to the\n&gt; ark, I am going to attempt a sh=\r\nort range sonar disruption intercept of the\n&gt; Ark&#39;s systems. Hopefully this=\r\n will cause enough of a falter, for us to\n&gt; regain control of the system vi=\r\na an interruption of frequencies. Tell -\n&gt; Legacy to be ready to intercept =\r\nthe mainframe on my mark. Tucson Prime out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; =\r\nCame Rodimus&#39; reply. His voice was quiet and firm. &quot;What ever\n&gt; you do, do =\r\nit quickly. I have Legacy with me right now, we will be ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimu=\r\ns turned to Legacy, &quot;I am not sure exactly how Tuscon plans to\n&gt; overload t=\r\nhese systems, they were designed to hold off the Predacon army,\n&gt; but hopef=\r\nully he has a plan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy nodded, &quot;Perhaps. I will be ready in eithe=\r\nr case.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus grunted as he and Ramulus brought their weapons to fu=\r\nll power. &quot;In\n&gt; any case, be ready for anything.&quot; Rodius began to lead the =\r\nway down the\n&gt; hall. &quot;Now we have to get to one of the control rooms.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Ramulus pointed to a nearby door, &quot;There.&quot; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt; As they made thie=\r\nr way over another call came from Tuscon . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rodim=\r\nus, as soon as we can regain control of the Ark, and the enemy\n&gt; &gt; is subdu=\r\ned, I&#39;d like everyone to meet in the control room, so we can\n&gt; figure\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nut how to deal with the intruder in an apropriate manner. I&#39;d like\n&gt; everyo=\r\nne&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; imput as how to go about it.

He\n&gt; could not hel=\r\np but feel the slightest bit of fear and apprehension as he\n&gt; sought to def=\r\neat this enemy and implement this plan of Tuscon&#39;s. Every\n&gt; moment that he =\r\nwas trying to get into the control room was a moment that he\n&gt; was leaving =\r\nElita unguarded.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We jsut arrived&quot;said the Predacon le=\r\nader while he set in a place where he\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; see the Maximal Group wit=\r\nhout been seen or detected, then he sent his\n&gt; coordinates\n&gt; &gt; to Blackrazo=\r\nr &quot;Be ready to left the base...
