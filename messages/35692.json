A very\n&gt; dark and Sinister looking one taking up the lead, with a proud blue\n&gt; warrior in the front, and a swaggering gorilla. Beside them walked four\n&gt; small robots, each 4 feet in height. The gorilla began to pound his\n&gt; chest. &quot;Yes, for to long you tell us not to fight in war&quot; he howled\n&gt; pointing at the three characters around the table. &quot;Me very sick of you&quot;\n&gt; he said, spitting a large gob of oil onto the table.\n&gt; \n&gt; The three predacons could barely keep from gagging, this gorilla emmited\n&gt; a disgusting oder. &quot;The gruffer one took time to finally break the\n&gt; braggarts speech. &quot;Well now we want you to fight. The Autobots are going\n&gt; to try something, and if we are ever going to revolt, they musnt be\n&gt; allowed to see what has happened on earth&quot; he says. &quot;Speaking of which&quot;\n&gt; another one started. &quot;It is time we contacted Motormaster. He turned\n&gt; around, and clicked a few keys with a nimble hand, a moniter roaring to\n&gt; life, and begining to send a message across space, and time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
