Maybe we can take a few of them out.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Elder walks over to a side hatch and opens it, allowing the air rushing by the shuttle to make noise and cause havok.

He switches the weapon to plasma shots and takes aim. He fires three carefully aimed blasts at the Minion duo.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 5/5/08, Super Cyclonus &lt;I&gt;&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: Minions at the ARK!&lt;BR&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, May 5, 2008, 5:07 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=yiv1622931288&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nightstrike/ Darkfate:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nightstrike and Darkfate just arrived when battle started and they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; were ready to support their fellows and opened fire againts the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enemie.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;((OOC: I am going to assume that Nightstrike and Darkfate and firing&lt;BR&gt;standard laser attacks this time. If you could, please define what&lt;BR&gt;ordinance you are using so I know how to have Legacy respond. Thanks))&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the last two minions make thier way onto the battle field they are&lt;BR&gt;scanned and targetted, even as they launch thier own attacks. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nightstrike and Darkfate&#39;s lasers reach through the air towards the&lt;BR&gt;crimson and black hover tank. They strike! Thier twin attacks searing&lt;BR&gt;along the dense armor of the craft, creating small scorched lines along&lt;BR&gt;the exterior, but other wise leaving it remarkably unharmed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tank on the other hand brought its twin mounted rear cannon to bear&lt;BR&gt;on the duo and began a\n firing rapid plasma beam attacks into the air,&lt;BR&gt;targetting thier wings and engiens!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even as this happened, Decibel and Tummult both swung through the air&lt;BR&gt;in wide arks, swiftly comming back around, thier engienes screaming as&lt;BR&gt;they brought to bear thier firepower! Twin missiles, a full spread&lt;BR&gt;launch from each of them and moved in the direction of Legacy!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The strike was tremendous, Tummult&#39;s ballistic missiles and Decibel&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;sonic ones created a true cecophany of sound light and power. However&lt;BR&gt;as the tank moved smoothly out from beneath the blast, the energy of&lt;BR&gt;the attack sloughing off newly errected shields, it was obvious they&lt;BR&gt;had underestimated this foe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ::Lord Elder::&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As the Maximal&#39;s Matrix Quest shuttle nears the Ark, Elder looks out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the view ports down at Mt. St. Hillary.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Elder: We&#39;re late! There is a battle down there. Minions... I&#39;m sure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the\n Maximal craft came into range, the ship was scanned as the tank&lt;BR&gt;below targetted it. After a short moment the targeting beams from the&lt;BR&gt;tank switched focus, the shuttle is apparently being ignored. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Hover tank turned its attention to the minions in the air, firing&lt;BR&gt;blasts at the dodging aircraft. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tummult continued his upward climb until he also saw the approaching&lt;BR&gt;Maximals. A grunt and a sight escaped him as he saw thier chance for&lt;BR&gt;success retreating from thier grasp. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Minions, RETREAT!&quot; Tummult&#39;s deep voice transmitted over thier radios&lt;BR&gt;on encrypted channels. &quot;Thier are too many for us to take. Phobia, get&lt;BR&gt;Deepstryke and get out of there!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tummult continued to climb as Phobia transformed and latched on to&lt;BR&gt;Deepstryke with some sort of cable. Decibel grumbled and circled, but&lt;BR&gt;only fired covering shots to aid thier escape from the tank below. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Tag Nightstrike, Darkfate and\n Maximals)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;(Da&#39;minions &amp; Legacy)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _&lt;BR&gt;Be a better friend, newshound, and &lt;BR&gt;know-it-all with Yahoo!
