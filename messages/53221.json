She watched this new creature. By the looks\nof it, \n&gt; they were similar to her, a mix of organic & cybernetic. \n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Trans-organics!&#39; she thought. Was this a horrible experiment by the\nQuints? \n&gt; They attempted this long ago.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You were very poor in stealth.&quot; She called out in a feline femme\nvoice, with \n&gt; a slight deep sophistication to it. &quot;Are you Autobot or Decepticon?\nOr are \n&gt; you a pathetic Transorganic experiment created by the Quints?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She stayed in the shadows, out of sight... for now. Waiting to see\nwho this \n&gt; newcomer was & what they were. Her questions were mounting.\n\nMelchana focused her optics and saw vaguely the feline form in the\ndark. Then she started laughing out loud.\n\nMelchana: Autobots? Decepticons? Quintesson expirement? Oh boy! You\nare funny! Me and all the new rulers of this planet have nothing to do\nwith any of those!\n\nShe walked a little closer, but still at a good range.\n\nMelchana: I&#39;m Melchana. A Tripredacus. I&#39;m not organic, even partly,\nbut my body is composed of nanites that imitate organic matter... only\nbetter. As for you... we detected you and we wanted to see what you\nwere. What are you?\n\n\n"}}
