Defend one who escalates for you?  Yes, I gave them a bit=\r\n of lip, they were the ones who attacked me quip for quip.  I ran my vocali=\r\nzer, they went ot blows, that&#39;s called putting fists to someone&#39;s nose.  Th=\r\ney were teh ones who just went, to try and skewer me for time ill spent.  S=\r\no, if you&#39;re going to defend someone, who would assault another Autobot for=\r\n annoyance well done.  I would ask, is that what you want?  To let them esc=\r\nalate and do whateve they want?  To know that they are immune, to being on =\r\nwhatever their tune?&quot;\n\nWheelie went on, &quot;I see now that you&#39;re no Prime.  A=\r\n Prime understands things most of the time.  A prime does not bully for his=\r\n own rank.  A Prime does not protect those who pick fights in the dank.  A =\r\nPrime is worthy of respect, a Prime does not make others hit the deck.  If =\r\nthis is what you will do, make excuses for those around you.  Then I would =\r\nsay, I shall not give the same to you.  Until I see that you change what yo=\r\nu do.&quot;\n\nOOC Uhm, Quartz, Wheelie was basically giving your characters some =\r\nsass, but then Rattrap and  Straight Shot then tried to assault him, which =\r\nif it had worked would have sent him to the medbay, and now Tuscon is getti=\r\nng in Leo Prime&#39;s face for having attempted to stop Autobots from starting =\r\na fight in the medbay.  I&#39;m aware he&#39;s your character and protecting his si=\r\nster, but I can&#39;t see this exactly as something a Prime would do. :)\n\nAnd i=\r\nn the future, please don&#39;t powerpose me, pranks or otherwise - especially w=\r\nhen it comes to something that would inflict significant damage, liek slamm=\r\ning him into quills!\n\n\n"}}
