He knelt down on his \nhands\n&gt; and knees, and then various parts of his body folded around,\n&gt; transforming, until he was in police car mode. He then opened his \ntrunk\n&gt; up, as the seats inside folded down, to provide enough room for the\n&gt; seeker to lie down.\n\n::REDHOT::\n\n    Figuring a ride was better than wasting precious energy, Redhot \neagerly crawled into Firedrill and snuggled down for a well deserved \nrest. He was careful not to injure himself, or Firedrill. Redhot \ndidn&#39;t feel it was the most comfortable spot he&#39;d ever been in, but \nconcidering the situation, he didn&#39;t complain. It wasn&#39;t long before \nthe sounds of a snoozing seeker rose into the air.\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n*******************************\n\n\n"}}
