You can&#39;t save \neveryone all the time, Tucson, it&#39;s impossible. But look at all the good \nyou&#39;ve already achieved.  Perceptor is here with us now, and having a better \nlife thanks to you and Rodimus, Nightlight, and Windlord are back with us \nagain, thanks to your efforts.  And know something?  That&#39;s a pretty big \naccomplishment.&quot;\n\nTucson smiles.\n\n&quot;I only - wish I could do more.&quot;\n\nQuickstride pats Tucson on his shoulder.\n\n&quot; Heey, you&#39;ve done more than your share of good deeds already sir. We can \nall attest to that.  You went out there and you showed Hydras a thing or two \nwhen you strategically got our comrades out of his clutches.  Without your \nstrategies we wouldn&#39;t have everyone back with us.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot;Yeah, ya might not have defeated hydras in a one on one, but you did show \nhim a thing or two when you stepped up to the plate, and coordinated the \nrescue efforts.  I don&#39;t think they saw that one comming.&quot;\n\nTucson&#39;s grin grows.\n\n&quot; Hmm, then I - suppose as soon as I&#39;m well enough, we - should try and \nthink ahead and - hopefully plan our precautionary measures against - future \nattacks.&quot;\n\nThat made Straight Shot smile.  She was happy to see Tucson comming to his \nsenses.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Besides&quot;said dryly Perceptor&quot;You cant save all&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: Sandy\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 27, 2011 10:20 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: BATTLE at the Ark!\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson listens to Rodimus and Legacy but as always he was going to prepare \n&gt; a\n&gt; reason for his actions, and before he can even speak, the inevitable\n&gt; happens.  He falls to one knee and then to the other.  The battery fluid\n&gt; loss had indeed taken him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride and Uproar are quick to try and catch him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Woahh, Rodimus and Legacy have a point Sir.  It&#39;s time you took care of\n&gt; your own needs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Replies Quickstride as he and Uproar now help him to his feet.  Tucson \n&gt; still\n&gt; had that apprehension.  Although he needed help, he still felt that the\n&gt; needs of his comrades had to come first.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; My - own needs - can wait.  The - others need help more than I do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot could see what was happening.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stubborn as usual.  C&#39;mon Tucson, Rodimus and Legacy are right, you need \n&gt; ta\n&gt; take care of yourself! I know what happened in the past was hard for you \n&gt; ta\n&gt; take, but that wasn&#39;t your fault!  You got struck from behind by Cyclonus,\n&gt; and there was no way of predicting that!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I - could have prevented it though.  And I - can&#39;t - let it happen \n&gt; again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot could see that Tucson did need help urgently.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy, please get Tucson ta the CR Chambers ASAP.  And make sure he\n&gt; actually takes your advice.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson couldn&#39;t say anything else.  He knew his little sister was right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to Rodimus now knowing why Tucson was acting as he \n&gt; was.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t out of revenge, it was out of compassion, and guilt.  But a \n&gt; guilt\n&gt; he did not deserve to carry.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He feels really bad about what happened..  He thinks that your\n&gt; disappearence and abduction was his fault.  In all truths it was no one&#39;s\n&gt; fault but Hydras&#39;s.  Before he became a Prime, he really took his job\n&gt; seriously and still does but back then, for an Autobot, he was all\n&gt; dedication and didn&#39;t care what kind of consequences he&#39;d face while going\n&gt; above and beyond the call of duty.  All he cares about is his comrades, \n&gt; and\n&gt; even back then, his loyalty was soley for you and the others.  He was \n&gt; always\n&gt; so proud to be working with you, and would do anything to uphold the level\n&gt; of heroism that&#39;s always expected of Autobot and Maximal kind.  Then, that\n&gt; day, the time you were taken from us..  That was the day he was trying to\n&gt; divert enemy attentions away from you by doing what was highly\n&gt; uncharacteristic of himself.  Decoy work was always deemed for those who\n&gt; were natural built speedsters, but he&#39;s no speedster.  When he chose his\n&gt; form, he chose the working class vehicle, which is known more for strength\n&gt; and durability than speed. But out of desperation to try and save you, he\n&gt; did what he normally didn&#39;t do, and then, that&#39;s when he got shot by\n&gt; Cyclonus. It took him off line instantly.  He doesn&#39;t remember anything\n&gt; after that.  I was taken off line at the same time, but, I did stay\n&gt; conscious enough to see the blast. Shortly after he went off line, I did.\n&gt; But strange, I remember more than he does.  And that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting as \n&gt; he\n&gt; is.  He&#39;s trying to sorta make up for lost time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me. It&#39;s about time I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired from Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; You really should have an assistant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you to assist me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon strangely. &quot;Tuscon!&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice had a\n&gt; &gt; surprised\n&gt; &gt; timber to it, the look on his face turning to full blown \n&gt; &gt; incredulousness.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You have just been through two battles, the first one nearly killed \n&gt; &gt; you,\n&gt; &gt; and you still haven&#39;t recovered the energon from that. And now you are\n&gt; &gt; going\n&gt; &gt; to start trying to repair others?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus shook his head, &quot;From what I have been told Legacy has been one \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the ones who worked on Nightlight, why don&#39;t we let him continue to work\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; a medic until our two doctors are able to be recovered, assuming that is\n&gt; &gt; possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy&#39;s single optic flashed as he looked at Tuscon and Rodimus. While \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; was face was as cold as ever, there was the impression of annoyance \n&gt; &gt; coming\n&gt; &gt; from him. &quot;I have the sum total of Maximal and Predacon medical,\n&gt; &gt; technological, historical and military knowledge up to approximately 57 \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; this planet years from now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Focusing on Tuscon Legacy continued, &quot;For you to attempt repairs in your\n&gt; &gt; damaged state is both illogical and potentially detrimental to your \n&gt; &gt; health\n&gt; &gt; and the health of those that you are desiring to repair. You cannot know\n&gt; &gt; how\n&gt; &gt; much longer your systems will continue with out failure. Should they \n&gt; &gt; fail\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; an inopportune moment it could have catastrophic results.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor nodded and watched in silence at the dormant figure of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after a large while he followed Tucson and said &quot;I offer mi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; asistance...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I have somne ideas to keep safe the ark and with out changes for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time line&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and kup went inside the ark and closed it down, they walked\n&gt; &gt; towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cr chambers and windlord opened his comlink to Rodimus and Tucson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Windlord and Kup to the Primes... the Ark is locked down, we request\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permition to go to a Cr&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson nodds to Perceptor with a smile of appreciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you Perceptor, of course, you&#39;re welcome to assist me and I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; always use some advice.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He opens the channel to Windlord and Kup.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Permission granted Windlord and Kup. Rest easy my friends.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Windlord and Kup step into the recharging chamber, the fuzors also \n&gt; &gt; show\n&gt; &gt; up. From the damage on their frames they have the same thought in mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Good battle.&quot; Noctorro said to Kup and Windlord, &quot;But I look forward to \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; time when we can live in peace, and will not be battling the Predacons.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He\n&gt; &gt; sighed as his CR chamber opened. He turned and stepped back into it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The other Fuzor&#39;s followed suit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;As long as Hydras is still around it won&#39;t happen!&quot; Bantor said\n&gt; &gt; sarcastically.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Torca nodded sagely, &quot;There may yet come a time.&quot; He said as he checked\n&gt; &gt; over\n&gt; &gt; his soldiers and then stepped into his own chamber. &quot;But until then we\n&gt; &gt; must\n&gt; &gt; be vigilant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He nodded as the door of the recharge pod closed and he begins the\n&gt; &gt; proccess\n&gt; &gt; of being repaired.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
