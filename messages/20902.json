The CR tank was\n&gt; regenerating the body nicely. It was already 25% complete. She had\n&gt; all the DNA scanned into the computer and let the tank do the rest.\n&gt; She had to make a few modifications on the weapons and scanners. The\n&gt; ones on the old bot were out of date and she simply upgraded the bot\n&gt; to modern standards.\n&gt;\n&gt; While the Beholder clone was in the tank, she went to work on the\n&gt; Feline clone. She had to reassemble it somewhat and check the back up\n&gt; memory diskes. Both bots had thier old memories intact and she could\n&gt; download them into the clones once they were complete. This would\n&gt; give the clones thier old personality and habits. They would also\n&gt; recognize thier old comrads and such. This would make things easier\n&gt; instead of programing them as new bots entirely.\n&gt;\n&gt; She finished with Feline&#39;s DNA and hooked up another CR tank. She\n&gt; then ran the programs and started to generate the Feline clone.\n&gt; She smiled and felt rather sure of her work. She had cloned bots\n&gt; before, but from living specimens, not the remains of a bot. But it\n&gt; still involved the same stuff, so she felt confident that her work\n&gt; would turn out just right.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
