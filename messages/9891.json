And for the past few clicks his side had been bleeding like it had never bled before!\nHis breath was just beginning to quicken within his metallic lungs but he ignored it, as well as the pain in which his wounded side was creating.\nAs far as he was concerned, as long as Tavatron was safe and away from danger, every pain was worth suffering through. And this pain was no exception.\nBefore he had began this series of movements he was almost sure that Tavatron would have been holding on so tightly that she would be cutting off his air supply, however, as close as her grip was to that, the only thing he really found a bit uncomfortable was the fact that she had plastered her body against his back!\nBut as he leapt from one particularly large tree to the other he noticed that her grip eased off a bit, not that he could blame her for holding as tight as before. If he had been in her situation he wouldn�t have gotten on at all!\nAs Dinobot continued the criss-cross action through the forest he was surprised to find that Tavatron had become a little bolder, her head now level with his.\nThe feel of her muscles against his back had changed as well, they seemed tense but with a pleasured quality behind them. Was Tavatron actually enjoying herself?\nDinobot was surprised to realize this as his scanning system remained targeted on all that lay before him, to make sure that he didn�t suddenly leap against the wrong tree and go down as it cracked and fell.\nBut soon he heard something that he had not heard in the longest of times, it was laughter? Yes. Yes it was. It was Tavatron�s laughter.\nAs his scanners indicated that they were nearing the half waypoint he began to pick up his pace, the surroundings becoming nothing more then a multicolored blur.\nThough he was relieved that Tavatron was no longer stressed with this situation he began to find himself looking up into the trees, searching for one that would be an ideal resting place. His side reminding him of his damage as it suddenly spasms with pain, a sharp growl escaping his metallic mouth and causing him to wrench again.\nThis was NOT good!\nGlancing quickly to the trunk of the next tree his hind limbs hit, he noticed that each time he impacted his own mech-fluid spattered against the trunk. His mind just wondering of how long it had been doing that before he noticed, and if Tavatron even noticed before him?\nBut if his wound was bleeding THAT bad then it was a fairly obvious sign that it had to be treated quickly, before the enemy could pick up on the fluid spatters that would lead them to Tavatron at a moment�s notice!\nScanning quickly he noticed that they were just entering the half way point, the perfect time to stop and survey all that�s happened and all that had to be done, and he was sure that his lungs would be thankful for the short rest as well.\nDinobot looked on as a clearing came into view, the very point in which he had mapped as their collective area.\n Lush green covered the ground, clean and fresh water flowed from a small waterfall part way to the top of a rock wall as ancient and as tall as the trees themselves. The softest grass and sweetest water he had ever come across, having discovered this glade while scouting for Predacons years ago.\nIt had been so long since he had every returned, always occupied with the past battles of the Beast Wars to ever come back to a place of such peace. Eventually forgotten in time, then remembered in a new one.\nDinobot sprung from one tree to the other until he spotted another known feature of such a peaceful place, an old stump in which was much taller and bigger around then he.\nSlowing his pace he soon propelled himself from the last of the great trees that lined the glade and came to a stop on the surface of the stump, it�s location being at the edge of the clearing.\nHe raised his head and looked around the clearing slowly, noting that everything was as it was when he had last been there.\nThe canopy of leaves above their heads protected from the harshest of rain, as well as dappled the glade with streams of sunlight�as it was doing this day. A small rainbow glowed above the mist at the base of the waterfall, simmering light from above catching the water droplets and illuminated the color prisms hidden within each one.\nThis truly was a planet of many beauties, and once in a while a worn and battle sore warrior could stop and reflect upon such locations of rare comfort.\nDinobot let out a sigh of relief as he slowly stepped down from the great stump and began to move towards the babbling brook at the far corner of the glade, surprised yet relieved that the Alliance had never found such a wonderful place and ruined it.*\n\n� We may rest here�for a time.�\n\n* But they COULD rest there for a time, safe from the enemy while both of them rested and gather their wits.\nNow that he was no longer forced to move quickly and forget his pains, Dinobot limped slightly. Though, he would be limping heavily if he had not been so determined to get Tavatron and himself to water first, knowing that he needed to restock on liquids and thinking of how Tavatron might have to do the same.\nThe sun streaks reflected against his armor as he walked towards the fresh source of nourishment, finally reaching the brook with a sudden flourish of color.\nThinking that it was just wild clover Dinobot had walked up to the edge of the brook and had lowered his snout to the cool water, a sudden rush of color fluttering into the air as a swarm of butterflies took wing. Rising into the air on either side of Tavatron and himself.\nA warm evening threatening as the streaks of sunlight soon turned into gold, a warm wind rustling the leaves of the surrounding trees as the few clouds above were painted pink with the sure signs of a warm night ahead.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
