Once he sat down, she \nwould feel a little better.  The drug hadn&#39;t kicked in all the way \nand when it did,he would feel 100 feet tall and Lazar proof.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; (Sounds like Hotmail didn&#39;t post.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike: \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike glowered at Dark Mouse, then stopped when she put her \narm around \n&gt; his shoulder.
