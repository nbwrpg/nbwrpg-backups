In a sector of what \nwe know\n&gt; as the milky way in the past there is a planet ravaged by a war and \nstill\n&gt; to be ravaged in the future. Filled with countless life, oceans, \nand land\n&gt; masses a small planet could forever change the future. In all its \nnatural\n&gt; glory the badlands of this planet earth has a scaring remain of the \nfirst\n&gt; battle, a space cruiser of sorts sticks out of this land as it \ndosent\n&gt; belong, the predacon shuttle stolen by a band of renegade \npredacons. As we\n&gt; zoom in we see it has not been used in a while and all but \nabandond, almost.\n&gt; \n&gt; A fimiliar hum emits from the wreckage underneath the dry molten \nrock. In a\n&gt; melodic form a voice unheard speaks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Stored enough energy for emergency frequency. Initiating&quot; at that \nthe\n&gt; melodical voice stops and begins to radio any cybertronian \nfrequency.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Emergency, cybertronian unit off line, in need of assistance&quot; \nbeams the\n&gt; computer. &quot;In need of assistance, head to these coordinates \nimidiatly.....&quot;\n&gt; As the unheard noise go&#39;s offline everything returns to normal, as \nit\n&gt; should be.\n\n\n"}}
