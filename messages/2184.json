And, if it was by getting to Plintissa&#39;s &quot;CR Chamber&quot;,\n&gt; I&#39;d have to say...please stop moding already.  Gosh, you make me wanna\nkick\n&gt; the crap out of someone.  A CR takes energy.  A base takes energy.  How\ndoes\n&gt; Plintissa even know how to build one?  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a complicated\nprocess.\n&gt; Where the Hell did she get the Cybertronian components from on Past Earth,\n&gt; where the wheel hasn&#39;t even been invented.  How did she get all the scrap\n&gt; metal?  Where is she getting the energy to power the CR Chamber?  Think\n&gt; before you post, god.  And another thing, you never posted for the charge\n&gt; Ramhorn tossed into the bridge set to explode in five seconds.  Did\nSuukie,\n&gt; with all his wounds, mystically get out of the bridge via teleportation?\nI&#39;m\n&gt; really ticked, and now you&#39;re bringing in the rock?  I have to agree with\n&gt; Talon, that is a dumb idea.  That ruins the entire thing.  I&#39;m willing to\n&gt; take this up with Yanshosh/Zardus (and the Council), but you are driving\nmy\n&gt; patience, and I&#39;m you&#39;re doing the same to a lot of other people, with\nyour\n&gt; whole &quot;destroy the Ark&#39;s defenses, steal the Autobot/Decepticon bodies, go\n&gt; into an underground base which you made lickety split in a few seconds&quot;.\n&gt; That is moding.  You even admitted to moding, on purpose, so no one could\n&gt; ruin it.  That&#39;s part of the RPG, TheCode, everyone participates.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stinkbomb/Ramhorn:\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959379710/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
