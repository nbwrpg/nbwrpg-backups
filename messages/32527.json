With a large sneer on his face he reaches down with one hand and \nencircles Switchblade&#39;s head. Then in one fluid moting his arm swings \nback, taking Switchblades body with it, and he lets go, sending \nSwitchblade to the rear. &quot;Your seat awaits you my lord&quot; Motormaster \nsays to Megatron, moving out of the way, motioning to the seat. \nMegatron sits down in the command chair. &quot;I am taking control \nAstroblast, you will drop us off at the following coordinates, then \nhead back to base with these orders.&quot; He types the orders into \nAstroblast, then waites until he is given control.\n\n\n\n"}}
