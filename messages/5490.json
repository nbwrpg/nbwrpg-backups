Pack up \nand move out.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus nods as he picks up Striker&#39;s transmission, walking into the bridge. \nHe walks over to a functional console.\n\n&quot;Computer,&quot; he says, &quot;I need a total backup of all of the Ark&#39;s recording \nchips and programming.&quot;\n\nThe computer beeps, getting to work on the project. Several moments later, a \ndisk emerges, which Ramulus picks up and puts in a storage compartment.\n\nRamulus turns, walking off toward his quarters to pick up a few things.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl almost jumps at Striker&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;A new base!&quot; he says, excitement clearly audible in his voice, &quot;Let&#39;s get \npacked! We can repair this dump later,&quot; he says to Bluestreak, walking off \ninto the Ark.\n\n"}}
