She \nhad to admit if nothing else that he was rather a unique creature, looking \nas if he had scanned every animal, fish, insect, and bird on the planet when \nhe had landed.\nBut even if he was not quite praportioned right, he was still a rather nice \nbot none the less.\nShe smiles as he answeres her.*\n\n&quot; That is good. I was not sure whether or not that salve would work on a bot \nwith as much power as you. I have only used it on myself before.&quot;\n\n*Zyber lay back down onto her stomach as she watched Blaster look into the \nfire and then turn his eyes back at her, though watching every one of his \nmoves.\nShe was way to trustworthy, she knew that. And she trusted sometimes when it \ncould be the worst thing for her.\nBut she simply nodded as he thanked her for saving his life, but then looked \nat him point blank when he asked for her to fill in more information for her \non tis planet.\nHowever, that was information with which she could give.*\n\n&quot; There is a bit.&quot;\n\n* Through her scouting and such she had come to know quite a bit, but why \nthis Blaster would want to know was beyond her.*\n\n&quot; There is a new Maximal ship, the Cybertronian Fire. Which is located in \nthe plains of Africa.\nThere is a new leader for the Predacons.\nOther then that there are other battles but nothing too seriouse.\nIron Raptor is leading the Maximals.\nThe winds are changing and the herds are moving south, leaving almost no \nfood in the north here.\nThe enire planet is changing in fact, climate, sea level. But nothing out of \nthe ordinery.&quot;\n\n* Zyber then stretched again and yawned a bit.*\n\n&quot; Is there anything specific you would like to know?&quot;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
