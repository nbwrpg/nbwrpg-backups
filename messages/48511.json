Inside, Shadow Star deactivated 5 of the 6 \n&gt; cannons and their power went directly into the shields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Star: The cannons are all down except one, Sir. The shields \nare \n&gt; now at 200% of their normal capacity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Perfect. Now, everybody hangs on to something.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship started to enter the transwarp passage. It shook heavily \nand \n&gt; started to revolve on itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael fell on the ground, but managed to transform to phoenix mode \n&gt; and to fly in the air.
