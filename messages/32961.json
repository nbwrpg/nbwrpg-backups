This started after they did Transformers: Headmasters.\n&gt;Anyway here is what I came up with in my head to fit &#39;Car Robots&#39; in.\n&gt;After the TF race stoped all contact with Earth, the great upgrade\n&gt;happaned, and they became Maximals and Predacons. After Beast Wars Neo,\n&gt;a group of Predacons(Destron/Destronger in Japan) went back in time, to\n&gt;Earth. Why? We dont know. Anyway Optimus Prime(Fire Convoy) and the last\n&gt;Autobots followed. What I dont gat is why the original TF&#39;s arn&#39;t in it.\n&gt;It is in 2000, so it would be 5 years before Tf: The Movie.\n&gt;\n&gt;Things are going to get wierder because in a few months America is going\n&gt;to &#39;car&#39; TF&#39;s again. A new toy line called TF: Robots in Desquise will\n&gt;be released. Also &#39;Car Robots&#39; will be inported, and tweaked a little so\n&gt;it fits the American continuity. It will probably have Predacons, after\n&gt;Beast Machines, going to Earth, and finding that the last Autobots were\n&gt;hiding there. They will probably change the year 2000 thing and set in a\n&gt;appropriat year. Well I hope I cleared things up, although I probably\n&gt;confused you even more.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
