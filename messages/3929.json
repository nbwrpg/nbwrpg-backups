She \ngrowled as she watched it happen. She couldn&#39;t let the attackers escape \nwithout having one of them answer her. The two Predacons she spoke with were \nno use to her, since they knew nothing about Megatron, even spouting any lie \nabout him.\n\nShe flew closer to the center of the conflict, and hovered above a bot \ncalling into his comm-link to the Maximals. It was Zardus, and he looked \npromising. He seemed to be the one that was in charge of the attack.\n\nShe lowered down to the flier until she was behind him. &quot;Hey you!&quot; she \nsnapped at him. She prepared herself just in case he fired. Megatron may \nhave told him about her.\n\n\n(Just a note before someone barks at me: Cyb doesn&#39;t know the Alliance \nmembers aren&#39;t Predacons.)\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
