Getting a lock, he fired a \nlarge explosive shell at Dark Mouse.\n\n---\n\nScavenger drove over Ramhorn&#39;s charred body, a scraping heard as the tires \n(made out of a flexible strong metal) scraped against Ramhorn&#39;s body, the \nside cannons opening fire, twenty &quot;bullets&quot; in all from the cannons heading \nat Ultracon.\n\n---\n\nHiss landed, firing three fusion blasts at Shockwave, the robot not belonging \nto any factions falling back as the blats cut into his abdomen.\n\n---\n\nDark One flew overhead, bringing up his targeting computer.  Locking on, he \nfired a single missile at Dark Mouse.\n\n---\n\nShockwave raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Hiss, then \ncharging off, retreating from the newly arrived reinforcments as he saw Hell \nBeast, Gremlin, Jackle, and Marine arrive.  &quot;Logic dictates that I should \nleave immediately.&quot; Shockwave commented, transforming to space fighter mode \nand launching into the air.\n\n"}}
