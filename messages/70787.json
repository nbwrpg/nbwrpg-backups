He would have done the same for his offspring if h=\r\ne had any.  Which brought him to think about Talon, and his future with her=\r\n.  His love for her would never wane, and now, more than ever, he wanted so=\r\n much to strengthen their bond.  But he had to conscentrate on the tasks at=\r\n hand now.  After all, like Rodimus He too must carry himself like a Prime.=\r\n  He gives a smile of approval, as Straight Shot transforms and connects he=\r\nrself to his back, in cross bow mode.  \n\n&quot; Now that we have Nightlight, Rod=\r\nimus and Windlord back with us here, it&#39;s time to think about how we&#39;re goi=\r\nng to weaken Hydras and the insectoids, thus returning this planet to a mor=\r\ne peaceful state of being.  We were not the only ones affected by Hydras, I=\r\n&#39;m sure of it, so if we do this in our honor, we should carry out our missi=\r\non for the preservation of this planet, and the innocent who reside here.  =\r\nAfter all, it&#39;s what we do best, all of us.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;No let me =\r\nexplain myself&quot;replied perceptor he tought a second and said &quot;My\n&gt; &gt; sugges=\r\ntion is swich thier signatures, specialy Nightlight&#39;s; if Hydras is\n&gt; &gt; see=\r\nking recapture her again, he will have to find her firts; let me tell me\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; how: every cr in Blackfortress or our old base have a record of every bot=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; signature that have been inside even in some cases took samples of the=\r\nm...\n&gt; &gt; do you remember what happened with Dinobot and his double in Beast=\r\n wars? or\n&gt; &gt; with Optimus Prime&#39;s puppet that MEgatron attemped to use aga=\r\ninst Autobots?\n&gt; &gt; something like that could happen again and had happened =\r\nin Neo beast\n&gt; &gt; wars...
