He viewed his scanner reports in slight \ndissapointment, seeing that he was too late to beat the slag out of \nHell Beast. Oh well, life was full of dissapointments.\n\nPicking out a random bot, Killfest arms his missile launcher and EMP \nrifle, firing off two missiles and three EMP blasts at Vehement. Over \nhis team&#39;s communication system, he told his troops not to fire on \nany Decepticons.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven also flies into the battlefield, seeing Sun Crusher. He aims \nboth of his missile launchers, firing two missiles from each at the \nbot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer doesn&#39;t bother to keep his jetpack any longer than \nneccessary to get him to the battle. He arrives, throwing his jetpack \ndown at Reflector as he flies down toward him, his tentacles ready to \nshock the slag out of the Brotherhood member.\n\n\n\n"}}
