Men, always greedy.\nBut she could use this fact as well, probably eating her fill without really \nharming either of them...they&#39;de just need a napp for a while.\n\nAt first she just thought that Bloodystrike was just going to show her his \nquarters, probably wanting to brage about them. But then she clued in, and \nnarrowed her optics a bit.\nSo, that was what they were both after? Well, she could play this game \ntoo...making the suffer and wait just a while longer before she fed.\n\nThen noticing the Reptilica also wanted to show her his quarters as well, \nbut restraining against both of them the best she could without being \nobviouse.\nThough...it was a bit useless, being dragged down the hall by both males, \neach in hope to probably get her to themselves and alone so that they can \neventually pull off what they had in mind for her.\nBut that sort of thing barely even made her care, being such a simple thing \nthat beings such as these could be pleased with.\nSimple pleasures for simple minds.\nFeeding upon her pray was where she got her pleasure from, but that would \nall come in time.\n\nHowever, their arguing was getting tirsome, and she was actually beginning \nto get tired of it.*\n\n&quot; Hmm...maybe a tour isn&#39;t best viewed on an empty stomach...perhaps a hot \ndrink would be nice...get to know my fellow bots...&quot;\n\n* She gave each of their hands an extra squeeze.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
