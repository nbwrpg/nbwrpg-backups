He has no beast mode \nsince his armor is tolerable to energon. He saw the Preds retreat \nfrom the Allience battle so he followed them. He stalked by the \ncouncil base, and when Killfest and his group went inside, he caught \nthe door before it closed. Berserk is a pro at sneaking around and \nkilling his victims within seconds. He was made to do that. Does that \nanswer your question?)\n\n\nBeserk:\n\n\n\nBeserk growled from the hit from his back. He lifted upright, baring \nhis teeth. He watched Apocolypse walk away. No one attacked him and \ngot away with it alive. He withdrew his clash sword, ready to attack \nhim.\n\n\n"}}
