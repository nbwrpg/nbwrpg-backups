Under normal circumstances, a transfor=\r\nmer&#39;s spark would\n&gt; &gt; merely be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished after its energy dropped=\r\n to a level where the spark\n&gt; &gt; could no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; longer maintain cohesion.  H=\r\nowever it appeared that someone had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intentionally routed an energy co=\r\nnduit directly from her mouth \n&gt; right\n&gt; &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battery-like object=\r\n next to her spark; allowing her to feast on \n&gt; other&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparks to kee=\r\np her own intact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether this had been done as a temporary me=\r\nasure to keep her \n&gt; alive,\n&gt; &gt; or as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means to make her kill, and k=\r\nill often; the Bushido Predecons \n&gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sustain her needs for en=\r\nergy even if they emptied all the prisons \n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Valley Mine Penta=\r\ntron.  Celeron estimated that she would have had \n&gt; to eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximat=\r\nely one spark every two days and that the battery could\n&gt; &gt; sustain a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little over a week or\n&gt; &gt; about =\r\n200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Fr=\r\nom the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. He would first need to gen=\r\neration some sort of substitute \n&gt; energon\n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to feed into her=\r\n spark so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other people&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; sparks and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he c=\r\nould keep her well-fed while he tried to come up with a \n&gt; solution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n2. He would eventually need to figure out where this leak was and\n&gt; &gt; repai=\r\nr it;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then finally removing the conduits that allowed her to eat spar=\r\nks \n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He had never done surgery, but=\r\n it didn&#39;t really bother him that he\n&gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; working on a living=\r\n being.  Perhaps he might even have the time \n&gt; to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some, &quot;enhanc=\r\nements&quot; to her design, that is, if Kratos would let\n&gt; &gt; him.  He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; type=\r\nd up all this data and sent it to Kratos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Celeron to Kratos, =\r\nI have determined that I need to perform \n&gt; surgery\n&gt; &gt; on our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hungry=\r\n friend.
