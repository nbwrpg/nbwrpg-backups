BTW this is the most strangle post that I&#39;ve done.\n\nStarice/Khonkolor:\n\nAll baby&#39;s behavoir made a Starice a clue what the baby needed... \nMILK! but how get some milk? Starice knew that Khonkolor loved drink \nmilk (he was a big cat after all) and that before they arrived, he \nhad kept in the ship several milk&#39;s bottles.\n\nStarice opened her com link &quot;Khonkolor, I was wondering if you can \nlet me take some milk&#39;s bottles...&quot;\n\n&quot;Is it for the baby isn&#39;t?&quot; replied Khonkolor &quot;I&#39;ve heard the news \nwhen you told it to Epyon... well go to this part of the ship (he \ngave her the datums) and type this password... take all that you \nneed.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks&quot; Said Starice, took the baby in arm and kissed her \nforehead &quot;come little one, you will dinner soon...&quot;\n\nShe left the lab with the baby.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Moon Mist&quot; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BB: Sorry I&#39;m so late on posting, guys. Had dinner with friends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whimpers came from the kit when she couldn&#39;t feed, her tiny tummy \ngrumbling \n&gt; with an empty sound.\n&gt; The sound of the thing that was holding her wasn&#39;t mommy and she \nwas \n&gt; confused. Where was the warm side and milk her brain was trying to \nfind?\n&gt; She was starting to make tiny yipps when she was suddenly washed, \n&gt; remembering how her mothers tongue use to run over her back and she \nbecame \n&gt; quiet, thinking mommy had come back.\n&gt; And on reaction she tried to find the war side and suckle but there \nwas \n&gt; nothing there! Mommy was just there, where was she again?\n&gt; The she-kit turned a bit in Starice&#39;s arms, thinking that the warm \nside was \n&gt; just behind her where it usually was when it wasn&#39;t in front.\n&gt; But it wasn&#39;t there either!\n&gt; Milk! Where was milk? Where there was milk there was mommy.\n&gt; By this time Starice had taken the kit to the lab, and all the \nsounds \n&gt; confusing the baby and making her mew/whine.\n&gt; (mews are little whimpering sounds for the baby)\n&gt; Now time passed and before and knew it something strange smelling \nwas put by \n&gt; her nose (e-cubes + o-food). She didn&#39;t know what it was so she \nsniffed the \n&gt; cubes, the smell not registering in her mind as something she could \neat but \n&gt; when her nose touched a cube sitting on top another one the jerky \nmovements \n&gt; of her body made it fall off, surprising her and she yipped.\n&gt; Drawing back into Starice&#39;s arms she cuddled into them, trying to \nhide from \n&gt; what made the scary sound. But soon she became brave since there \nwas no more \n&gt; of the sound and moved in Starice&#39;s arms again, suddenly bumping \nher nose on \n&gt; her fingers.\n&gt; The shape of their tips reminded her of her mother&#39;s teats  and she \nopened \n&gt; her tiny mouth, trying to suckle from them.\n&gt; Her mind thinking milk again. Her itty-bitty paws moved unsteadily \ntowards \n&gt; the sides of Starice&#39;s hand, trying to massage the milk from \nmommy&#39;s side.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
