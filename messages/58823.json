There had been a volcanic \neruption only days ago. The land was still smoking and the soil would \ntake years to recover...\n\nHe loved that place!\n\nAries: Ah! This is the kinda place I could live in! No disturbing \nneighbours, a way to make the yokels believe you&#39;re a god and you \nwant a virgin to keep you from destroying them, and (picking an olive \nfrom the upper branches of a partly burnt tree) plenty of oil!\n\nJust then, the third occupant said something.\n\nDracon: Go that way.\n\nAries: What? What are you talking about?\n\nThere was no answer. None was needed.\n\nAries: Huh... Okay then...\n\nAries knew who was the boss. Without knowing it, he was coming closer \nand closer to the Predacon base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He was lurking in the night. The Humans wanted their kid back. He \n&gt; would oblige them... to a point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Already, the small girl was shaking back into conscience. Quite \nfast, \n&gt; it would seem, as she was now screaming for her parents to save \nher. \n&gt; He and his companions smiled at the thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; The large muscular man arrived with two smaller ones. The freed the \n&gt; girl from the plants that tightly held her. None of them saw the... \n&gt; thing leap from the top of the tree. None of them survived to tell \n&gt; the tale.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had heard one of his friend say that he was a machine, but he \ndid \n&gt; not believe it one bit. He circled the place where the humans died, \n&gt; and swiftly decided that he would eat them. He savagely tore at \nthree \n&gt; of them with three different heads at the same time. Blood covered \n&gt; his mouth and that of his friends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries: Enough now! Leo, you stop being such a loser and accept it! \n&gt; We&#39;re not a stupid mindless beast!\n&gt; \n&gt; Leo: Aries, shut up! I&#39;m in charge now! You could never prove that \n&gt; before and you&#39;re not going to start now!\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries: Oh yes I will!\n&gt; \n&gt; With a cry of excruciating pain, Leo was relegated to a spectator \n&gt; position. Aries was now in command and he transformed.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was not tall, nor was he very impressive. He was just a simple \n&gt; robot. It was more than enoughto prove a point, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aries:Ha ha! See now? Okay, The food&#39;s not good anymore. Let&#39;s fly \n&gt; away.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, he stretched his leathery wings and started to cross the \n&gt; Mediterranean sea, heading for Greece.\n\n\n"}}
