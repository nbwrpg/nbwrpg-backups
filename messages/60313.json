They had hurt him yes, but far from dead was he. Clinging to the walls of earth slowly the silver ooze climbed and climbed ever so slightly. Over the course of years it clung and scratched its way back to the sun. With a spurt liek an eruption of a gyser a shiny line of silver shot into the air. Hovering in the air it molded into a metallic ball. The sun gleamed against it showing the spark in its center. Its conciousness searched and searched for a memory a form it could manifest into. Suddenly it sprang forth arms and legs. It had transformed into Rodimus Prime. Lookign at his hands and feet his reformed memory circuts connected with his dark spark. The gangled voice that came forth was his spark in a projected form and not of Rodimus Prime..&quot;P..rrrrr....o...t...o..lives!&quot; Suddenly with a burst he transformed into Starscream&#39;s jet mode and blasted off towards the nearest Predacon base. &quot;Attention to any predacons please contact me and lead me to your base.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
