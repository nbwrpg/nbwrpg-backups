Okay, okay, so yeah, I&#39;m rankn&#39; on &#39;em \nmy bad.  But seriously, okay, Legacy works well in battles but his social \nskills, leave lots ta be desired.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot shrugs.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m staying out of this.  I&#39;m not the one who brought up the counting \nthing.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nudges Uproar.\n\n&quot;Nice going, open mouth insert paw.&quot;\n\nUproar shrugs.\n\n&quot; Well, it&#39;s kinda true.  Every time we try ta ask &#39;em a question we get \nblown off.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds.\n\n&quot; Yeah, that part is kind of right.  He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable \npart, and nothing against him but, he is treading on thin ice with Tucson \nsir, and I really think someone should talk to Tucson before he blows his \nown stack.  I can see it in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him that \nseems troubling.  One of these days a real fight between them will break out \nand there may be no way ta stop it.  I tried talking to Tucson but he&#39;s as \nstubborn as Ratchet in that respect.  So, how do we hold the peace with both \nof them, because I&#39;d really like ta know that.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Is that what that vibration was all about? I thought it was another \n&gt; &gt; quake. Okay so what did Legacy do ta deserve another shout match with \n&gt; &gt; Tucson?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride looks back to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The usual, he tried to go against Tucson&#39;s orders. And you know what \n&gt; &gt; happens if we disrespect a Prime, right?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh yeah, that&#39;s why I would never dare ta do anything like that, noooo \n&gt; &gt; waaaay, especially with Tucson. As far as I&#39;m concerned, like Rodimus, \n&gt; &gt; what he says, goes. Legacy better watch his step, that&#39;s two strikes \n&gt; &gt; against him now. And yeah, I&#39;ve been keepn&#39; count.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot frowns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s even still with us. Something about him so creeps me \n&gt; &gt; out it&#39;s not funny.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Elder watched as Legacy walked away and Tuscon and Talon began\n&gt; talking. He sighed again and began walking to where the others were.\n&gt; He could hear thier conversation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Are you really counting?&quot; Lord Elder and Quickstride a curious look\n&gt; on his face. His face and form looked a little bigger than before, his\n&gt; face clear and shiny, and yet he still managed to have a haggered look\n&gt; on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;While you are counting, don&#39;t forget while everyone else was off\n&gt; fighting in the battle when Cyclonus and his drones were sacking\n&gt; everyone including the Predacons that Legacy single handedly held the\n&gt; Ark against 5 of Cyclonus&#39; most powerful cronies. When we had to go\n&gt; rescue Rodimus who was there helping, taking much of the damage and\n&gt; expending his precious energon to shield you guys. That was Legacy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Elder frowned, &quot;Has anyone ever even talked with legacy? Does\n&gt; anyone even know the first thing about him? He arrived here from\n&gt; Primus knows where and no one even asked him anything. You trust him\n&gt; when the energon chips are down, but now you are ready to boot him\n&gt; out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What are we Maximals or rabble. If we turn to fighting among\n&gt; ourselves then what are we?&quot; Lord Elder shook his head as he began to\n&gt; walk away. &quot;And before you go betting on who would win the battle you\n&gt; were discussing, you might want to find out more about Legacy first.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
