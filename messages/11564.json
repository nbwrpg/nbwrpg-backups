She turned down the hallway and \nwent to the mess hall.  She went over to the bar, poured herself an \nenergin and sat down at a table.  She didn&#39;t even take a sip of her \ndrink.  She just sat there looking at the glass.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; DrillBit still stood in KitKat&#39;s room.\n&gt; &quot;So when do you want to attack?&quot; He asked KitKat.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus grabbed some tools, and began working on the Ark.\n\n\n"}}
