Using her telescopic \nvision, she saw Cyber Claw getting the wiring beat out of her.  She wasn&#39;t \nsure about what faction Cyber Claw was, but she didn&#39;t like the odds.  Three \nto one is a bit uneven, she thought.\n&quot;Maybe I can help even up the odds a little.&quot;\nShe swooped down and screached at Cyber Claw, &quot;GET DOWN!&quot;\nShadow Wing swooped down and dive bombed the other Preds and shot at them \nwith her optic lazars.  She didn&#39;t climb out of the dive right away, but \nflew right past Cyber Claw.\n&quot;Move it if you want to live.&quot;\nShe flapped her wings and flew through the trees and climbed back into the \nair for a second round.\n\n---------Original Message-------------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Cyber Claw:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cyber Claw bared her teeth as she saw the Predacons open fire on her. She\n&gt;lifted herself into the air, shifted herself to the right. Two shots,\n&gt;including missiles went by her. As she raised her arm to fire back with a\n&gt;mini missile that layed underneath her forearm, she was hit on the left\n&gt;shoulder by a signature seaking missile. She was thrown to the ground. The\n&gt;spikes on her shoulder shattered off of her, falling to the ground like\n&gt;shattering glass.\n&gt;\n&gt;She growled from the shot, trying to move. She had to move before they\n&gt;killed her. She made herself crawl. She looked back to the group.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;You think I&#39;m a Maximal. I am not. I am one of you. Sadly that it sounds.&quot;\n&gt;She stood up.\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
