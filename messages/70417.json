They&#39;ll need the CR chamber \n&gt; stabilized &#39;n ready ta go ASAP.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re right, let&#39;s go.  Besides, I think Wheels looks about ready ta \n&gt; lose his temper...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They retreat into the CR chamber area.  Tucson&#39;s brow narrows yet not much \n&gt; on the line of words comes out right away.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Must we always assume the worst Cheetor?  Must we always follow a \n&gt; similar path even if it may lead us over a cliff to our demise?  Talon is \n&gt; right, Perceptor risked his own life so that we may still remain \n&gt; functionable.  If he were to turn his back on us, he would have done that \n&gt; vorns ago.  Now, I will not hear another negative word about Perceptor. \n&gt; Not in my pressence.  He has risked his life for us, and now we must do \n&gt; him the respect of showing him our thanks for his efforts.  Now, enough \n&gt; bickering, we have a tunnel to seal off and Rodimus Prime to bring back \n&gt; online.  I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to see any of you bickering either.  Am \n&gt; I understood Cheetor?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His voice as deep as Optimus Prime&#39;s, Tucson Prime speaks his word \n&gt; assertively without being aggressive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride watches things unfold.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wow, ya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure knows his \n&gt; words of wisdom.
