He had no idea where he was, except that it was a\ndesert like area.  Hmmmm.  Where could he be?  He looked around, and all he\nsaw was sand, sand, sand.  Then, his eyes were drawn to a, a source of\nwater!  A river!  Yes!  Yes, this told him where he was!  He was in Egypt,\nby the Nile River!  Suddenly, he saw a base!!!!!!!!!  Strange place for a\nbase to be.  Yet, if any cloaked bots dared to try and enter the base, they\nwould be seen, because of the sand blowing in the wind.  He was tired,\nshelterless and defenceless.  He had been hopeless as well until he found\nthis base.  Here he could find all the solutions to his problems.  He could\nrest, be sheltered and maybe even get some new weapons.  But, then he\nthought closely for a moment.  First of all, he would have to be careful of\nthe exterior defences.  Second of all, they might not trust him.  He would\nhave to make a deal with them.  Yes a perfect deal, whatever side they\nwere, he would help them fight against their enemies for a couple days. \nThen he would thank them, and leave them.  Yes, that would work, since he\nwas a neutral bot, showing allegiance to no one.  He stayed a distance, and\ntried his comm-link.\n\n\t&quot;Is anyone in this base?  I repeat, is anyone in this base?  If you read\nme, please tell me your faction.  I repeat, please tell me your faction. \nThis is not an enemy trick, I assure you,&quot; Hakibuscon said.\n\n\n"}}
