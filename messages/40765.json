I&#39;m loaded with posts AGAIN!\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Yes. It was our temporary base until it was destroyed beyond recognition.\n&gt;Then rebuilt and launched to a safer location.\n&gt;From there we moved onto the Cybertronian Fire. It was the largest war ship\n&gt;then but soon it was outclassed and outgunned. Meeting the same fate as the\n&gt;Ark. Soo...it was dismantled and what remains were left were used to help\n&gt;fortify the Maximal City.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor began to walk away from the city a little, at a slow pace.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; As for allies...we don&#39;t have many...if any anymore.  There are a few\n&gt;factions that have aided us, even the Alliance at times. But the Maximals\n&gt;are basically alone on this planet.  Cheated, ransacked and generally \n&gt;beaten\n&gt;beyond recognition. That has been our fate so far.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* It was lack of leadership, she knew. There were great warriors here but\n&gt;with poor leadership all they&#39;ve been getting was beaten up. And it wasn&#39;t\n&gt;hard to notice that all of the battles they HAVE WON...weren&#39;t led by her \n&gt;at\n&gt;all.\n&gt;&lt; I was never made to lead. I was made to follow.&gt;*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
