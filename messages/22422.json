Just what do you think you&#39;re doing letting that \nfeatherhead push you around like that?!!&gt;\n\n* It was Iris.\nBut she wasn&#39;t in her main hard drive or anything...and she couldn&#39;t see the \nmomotor anywhere either.\nThen...where was she?\nIron Raptor growled as she turned on her heel a bit, seeing something off in \nthe distance and zeroing in on it with her scanners.\nJust as Prowl jogged up to her she finally saw just what it was....*\n\n&lt; I don&#39;t believe it....&gt;\n\n* Iron Raptor glanced towards Prowl for a moment, sending him an image of \nwhat she saw...it was another bot.\nSitting on a rotten stump only about 100 meters from where they stood now, \nfemale...and clad in armor.\nRather similar to the armor Iron Raptor wore...only it was read and had less \nof a build to it. A black cape flittering in the wind as the bot just sat \nthere, resting it&#39;s arms on its knees and......looking right at them.\nBut then suddenly Iron Raptor heard laughter in her mind.*\n\nIRIS: &lt; Finally spotted me, huh? What do you think?&gt;\n\n* And with that the bot stood, obviously female...and obviously Iris.\nBut she just stood there, almost as if staring her down from the distance.\nNow...THIS was new!\nObviously the merge didn&#39;t just have side effects on Iron Raptor and Prowl!*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
