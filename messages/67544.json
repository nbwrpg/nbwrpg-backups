First the Decepticons. Hat=\r\ning\nthem for destroying Cybertron, for ruining the balance, for unlocking\nU=\r\nnicron (though I only found out much later), and for killing Prime.\nWe mana=\r\nged to suppress them, to oppress them, to reduce their\nmalevolence to just =\r\na bitter resentment. That suited us fine. We them\nreformatted. We became Ma=\r\nximals and they Predacons.\n\nAfter a long time, I came here. I had heard the=\r\n stories, and I hated\nthe slavedrivers that had attacked our colonies. I us=\r\ned my hatred\nconstructively, and I helped rebuild those broken lives. I thr=\r\new my\nlot in with them so that nothing like that would happen again. Ever.\n=\r\n\nOf course, I couldn&#39;t have been more misguided. The Minions, those\nFallen =\r\nSpawns wrecked us more effectively than our terrible civil wars\never did. A=\r\nnd I hated them for that.\n\nNow, I see that the alliance we had does not hol=\r\nd anymore. I should\nhate you for that. Surprisingly, I don&#39;t think I do. I =\r\nmight become\nsoft. Maybe I just start looking at the big picture. Whatever =\r\nit is, I\nhave to do what I must do. Why? Because I can. No better reason, i=\r\ns there?\n\n                                  *****\n\nHe rose. The hinges on t=\r\nhe restraints groaned as he forced to get away\nfrom the wall.\n\n???: That&#39;s =\r\nit, my slave! Show me how strong you are! Show me the\nstuff of your will!\n\n=\r\nWith a thunderous clap, the restraints broke free from the wall. He\nwas not=\r\n held anymore.\n\n???: Yes! That&#39;s it! Now bow before your master!\n\nA thin, e=\r\nvil smile.\n\n???: No.\n\n???: No? [A hearty, maniacal laugh] You don&#39;t underst=\r\nand who you&#39;re\nplaying with, Magnus!\n\n???: I do. Don&#39;t you remember? Your f=\r\norced repairs, your tweakings,\nyour adjustments. You changed my spark. Ultr=\r\na Magnus is dead. So are you.\n\nIn a flash, he who had been Ultras Magnus ro=\r\nse his powerful arms and\nbore everything he had on his would-be master. Mac=\r\nhine guns roared,\nRPGs thudded, laser rifle blazed. In a short few seconds,=\r\n only a\nsmoldering scrap remained, spark cavity now empty.\n\n???: I&#39;m Ultra =\r\nMagnum, and I&#39;m the boss around.\n\nSlowly, with cold determination and a bur=\r\nning hatred, Ultra Magnum\nmade his way outside, leaving more Iron Skull cor=\r\npses around. Magnus\nhad died inside, and the monster lived in his stead.\n\n\n"}}
