Logically their path would turn at different\npoints, changing as they came to points were they\ncould not dig through. Instead however he just turned and watched as\nMegatron opened fire on the hole!\n\n&gt; The blast was long a fair powerful, widening the tunnel entrance slightly\n&gt; as the eart ad rockwas heated and melted.  When the blast subsided,\n&gt; Megatron stood up straight to observe his handy work.\n\nThe\nground fairly buckled and distorted as the powerful blast turned stone\nand dust into liquid and smoke and the power of Megatron&#39;s cannon reaching\ntowards the very bowels of the earth! \n\nAs Megatron stepped back\nto observe his handy work, steam and waves of heat blasted out of the\nhole as newly created gasses were released from the hole into the air!\nThe hole was now several times larger, and perfectly circular as it\nextended downward in the same direction as the original hole. The sides\nof the new tunnel were now firmly packed, smooth and stone-like, steam\nhissing from them as they cooled. The length of the tunnel extended far\ninto the darkness of the subterainian earth terminated somewhere far beneath the ground.  \n\n&quot;INTERESTING.&quot;\nLegacy said as he oriented his arm cannon down into the hole and\nscanned the results of Megatron&#39;s work. &quot;THE NEWLY CREATED HOLE EXTENDS\nSEVERAL KILOMETERS INTO THE LITHOSPHERE.&quot;\n\nBeneath their feet the ground began to rumble . . .\n\n&quot;HOWEVER\n. . . &quot;  Legacy continued after a brief pause, &quot;I AM DETECTING RISE IN\nAMBIENT HEAT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THIS HOLE.&quot; Legacy began to\nrise into the air, &quot;I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE RELOCATE OURSELVES WITH ALL\nSPEED.&quot;\n\n(TAG: Megatron, Kup, Grimlock) \n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
