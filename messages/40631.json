He will be unavailable for \n&gt; some time, he&#39;ll be attending some gladiator event or something. He was \n&gt; trying to get an arrangement with Zardus, leader of the Alliance and said he \n&gt; would recommend us to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Haha! Old friend! You haven&#39;t changed at all! Always trying to prove you are \n&gt; the best! Well, for the Tripredacus and the Matrix, I widh you luck!\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana:\n&gt; Yeah, but maybe his mercenary act is going to get him killed... Too much \n&gt; enemies means you never miss some fun, but sooner or later, he will be done \n&gt; for good!\n&gt; \n&gt; Gesper:\n&gt; So what do we do? Do we work for Zardus for some time?\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; Perhaps... (he thinks for a bit) Gesper, you will stay here to establish the \n&gt; perimeter defenses. Get the shield online and reconfigure the surrounding \n&gt; techno-organic vegetation so it can provide us with some defensive \n&gt; firepower. Melchana, connect the shield&#39;s absoring devices to the Shadow \n&gt; Destiny&#39;s generator. I&#39;ll be looking at the tactical emplacement of the base \n&gt; and bring modifications to the orders I gave if need be. Gesper, if Zardus \n&gt; sends a message, relay it to me in top priority. He is likely to be an ally \n&gt; to us in this war. If he wants our assistance, I will go along with \n&gt; Melchana.\n&gt; \n&gt; The two others acknowledge their orders, Melchana hoping that Zardus will \n&gt; call soon...\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; T�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \n&gt; http://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nREPLY SOON          HARLEY PARRY FROM ST.THOMAS\n\n_______________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet your free @... address at http://mail.yahoo.ca\n\n"}}
