How=\r\never CRYOTEK\n&gt; had made his way back to stand with DINOBOT and SKYSHADOW. &quot;=\r\nWe may\n&gt; need them before we get to the end of this.&quot; CRYOTEK said\n&gt; though=\r\ntfully. &quot;This is obviously a trap of some sort and unfortunately\n&gt; we seem =\r\nto be caught within it as much as the Maximals are.&quot; he said\n&gt; in a low voi=\r\nce.\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW nodded, &quot;Unfortunately I have to agree.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK gl=\r\nanced at DINOBOT, &quot;But go ahead and do what you can to keep\n&gt; them off bala=\r\nnce.

Oh yes for a grave price you get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n cooperation from a Predacon.  Now you tell me Leo, I&#39;m listening, how is i=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that this alliance happened so easily?  I will take back what I =\r\nsaid and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; things will be as they stand, with you in command of cour=\r\nse.  The truth Leo,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; all I want   IS THE TRUTH.  You can tell me th=\r\nat can you?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He stands firm with a thrash of his tail.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME stood there grinding his teeth, well he would if he had an=\r\ny&lt;br&gt;\nin robot mode. He glared at TUSCON. &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed that Hydras&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nisn&#39;t here, or Cyclonus or Scourge or any of the sweeps?&quot; LEO said,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nhis voice calm but seething with his own anger. &quot;The Predacons come&lt;br&gt;\nfo=\r\nr the same reason as we, to locate their missing comrades and to&lt;br&gt;\nfind o=\r\nut what is at the bottom of this jungle. The same reasons that&lt;br&gt;\nthey wer=\r\ne ready to do so before.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO paused for emphasis, &quot;There is no of=\r\nfer of any life for a life for&lt;br&gt;\nthis mission, and if you claim to know w=\r\nhat it is to be a Prime then&lt;br&gt;\nyou would know that I would never sell som=\r\neone&#39;s life for this.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven as he spoke LEO kept silent on the mat=\r\nters closest to him, like&lt;br&gt;\nthe suspicion that the PREDACONS did have som=\r\ne other agenda, some&lt;br&gt;\nother reason for being here. But it was not someth=\r\ning he was willing&lt;br&gt;\nto give voice to so close to finding out what was go=\r\ning on.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, witness=\r\ning the seeming altercation of aggression circuits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; between LEO PRI=\r\nME and TUSCON PRIME as DINOBOT went out of the tunnel,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; flanking ov=\r\ner towards SKY SHADOW with a look of..  AMUSEMENT upon his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; facepla=\r\nte, but remaining in silence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Staying on inter-Predacon r=\r\nadio, which hopefully at close range would work&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then, and not be a=\r\nudible to the MAXIMALS, and sending a signal to CRYOTEK.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;We se=\r\nem to be restrained down here for now.  What are your orders then?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Press on or attempt to instigate altercations within the MAXIMALS?&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nActually inside the caves radios were completely=\r\n out. However CRYOTEK&lt;br&gt;\nhad made his way back to stand with DINOBOT and S=\r\nKYSHADOW. &quot;We may&lt;br&gt;\nneed them before we get to the end of this.&quot; CRYOTEK =\r\nsaid&lt;br&gt;\nthoughtfully. &quot;This is obviously a trap of some sort and unfortuna=\r\ntely&lt;br&gt;\nwe seem to be caught within it as much as the Maximals are.&quot; he sa=\r\nid&lt;br&gt;\nin a low voice.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSKYSHADOW nodded, &quot;Unfortunately I have to =\r\nagree.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK glanced at DINOBOT, &quot;But go ahead and do what you =\r\ncan to keep&lt;br&gt;\nthem off balance. We can&#39;t have them ready to turn against =\r\nus too&lt;br&gt;\nsoon.&quot; He grunted, &quot;Hydras has been taken from us, that seriousl=\r\ny&lt;br&gt;\nchanges the balance of power here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The aerial Predacons up aboveground seemed to be cut off from th=\r\nem for now,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who had not followed them underground (such as WASPINA=\r\nTOAR and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; BLACKARACHNIA).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DRILL BIT had dug back =\r\nunderground once his bait had been laid, digging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; underneath.  VICE=\r\n GRIP remained at hte rear of the tunnel, still cloaked,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and attem=\r\npting to (and most likely failing) to scan whatever had seemingly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ncut off the tunnel back to the surface.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nActiv=\r\ne sensors are down here inside the cave, however vibrations can&lt;br&gt;\nbe sens=\r\ned by DRILLBIT, vibrations that center roughly about in the&lt;br&gt;\nentrance ch=\r\namber where they first entered into the caves. Vibrations&lt;br&gt;\nwere very fam=\r\niliar to DRILL BIT and but centered on that entrance way&lt;br&gt;\nbut spreading =\r\nout to affect even the tunnels he was digging. . .&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven above the =\r\nrest of the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS began to feel a&lt;br&gt;\nrumble and then a sh=\r\naking, the rumbling quickly being felt down the&lt;br&gt;\npaths to where the rest=\r\n of the MAXIMALS and the PREDACONS stood.&lt;br&gt;\nAnyone who had ever had any e=\r\nxperience inside of caves or in&lt;br&gt;\nunderground setting knew what they were=\r\n feeling.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe opening tremors for a CAVE IN!!!!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe wall=\r\ns began to shake as stone and rocks began to fall. The&lt;br&gt;\napparent only wa=\r\ny to safety lay in further into the caves themselves,&lt;br&gt;\nsince, strangely =\r\nenough, it was the cave through which most of the&lt;br&gt;\nMAXIMALS and PREDACON=\r\n had entered this place was from where it seemed&lt;br&gt;\nto be extending from.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt was like they were being pushed or herded forward!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TA=\r\nG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group =\r\nemail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-02EABB1E-6AF6-4454-B083-B6666C3E4A4D--\r\n\n"}}
