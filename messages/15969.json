What was so special about \nhim? It didn&#39;t matter. In a few days she would be beggin...for me to \nhurt him! But for today he would spare him.\n\n&quot;Hammer, stop firing.(&quot;done boss.&quot;) I have shown Mercy today, but if \nhe is insolent again, than he will not be so lucky.&quot;\n\nPrebon pressed two buttons on the controls. One drew back the guns \ninto the wall, but the other flipped out a very small spy cam in the \ntop corner. The image was broadcasted to Hammer in the main bridge. \nHe turned to Spears.\n\n&quot;Remember! No aiding him, no giving him anything without his \npermission. If he tries to escape you will do everything in your \npower to stop him, and if he still escapes, you will kill yourself a \nmile outside the base. Understand? Good.&quot;\n\nPrebon walked to the main bridge where Hammer was watching Striker \nthrough the camera.\n\n&quot;If he tries anything, kill him. Soon we go for Ramulus.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix continued to stare at the group.\n\n&quot;So who&#39;s gonna help me install these computer boards? We won&#39;t know \nabout the ship without them!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
