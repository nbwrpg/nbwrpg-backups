He dove down when he saw a metalic object about \n&gt; half-way between the pod and the ship.  He saw a dark figure....\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello?  What are you doing here?

He and \n&gt; Celeron met in mid-air about half way between the two places and \n&gt; they were both almost hit by the firepower of the angry prisoner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Why would you imprison somebody with their weapons still \n&gt; weapons?&quot; Celeron angrily asked Tigon (the warden).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tigon hadn&#39;t waited to listen to Celeron, he was already locked \nin \n&gt; a battle with the prisoner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The prisoner fired a volley of three shots which hit Tigon in \nthe \n&gt; chest.  Tigon blasted the prisoner with his main gun, and then \n&gt; kicked the prisoner out of the air.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron decided to sneak over to the pod and see what he could \n&gt; learn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The prisoner got back up and got up real close to Tigon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You won&#39;t take me back!  NEVER!&quot; at that, he started firing \n&gt; violently.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tigon tried to shield his face with his arm; he tripped and fell \n&gt; over backwards down a hill.  The prisoner saw his chance and \njumped \n&gt; on Tigon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron decided to intervene (there would always be time to pick \n&gt; through the pod later) he charged up his arm cannons and sneaked \nup \n&gt; behind the raging prisoner.  Tigon was not moving and the prisoner \n&gt; was trying to break open the armor on his back.  Celeron fired \nboth \n&gt; of his cannons pointblank into the prisoner.  He was blown back a \n&gt; few yards and fell into the sand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron decided that if he didn&#39;t act now, he&#39;d lose too and \ncould \n&gt; possibly die.  He grabbed a pair of handcuffs from Tigon&#39;s tools, \n&gt; and he shot at the prisoner to make sure he was down.  When cuffed \n&gt; the prisoner, the prisoner tried to break free.  Tigon reactivated \n&gt; just in time to see Celeron attempting to disarm the prisoner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;This prisoner has a protective field that keeps him from being \n&gt; disarmed.  The only way I could detain him, was to render him \n&gt; unconscious.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The prisoner was still struggling, Tigon took a device from his \n&gt; kit and strapped it to the prisoner&#39;s neck.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now we can momentarily control him.&quot; Tigon explained.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron kicked the prisoner who was now powerless to resist \nhim.  \n&gt; Tigon glared at Celeron and Celeron immediately stopped.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When they got back into the ship The Warden chained the prisoner \n&gt; to the wall and had Celeron guard him.  Tigon then prepared a \n&gt; chamber to keep the prisoner in.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey...isn&#39;t there some way to disarm him?&quot; Celeron asked.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I haven&#39;t found a way to.  I&#39;ve been trying for several years.  \n&gt; He has an energon field that is generated when someone tries to \n&gt; tamper with his weapons.  I&#39;ve given up trying&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Celeron thought that this was a challenge worth trying.
