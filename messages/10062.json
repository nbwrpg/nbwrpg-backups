She noticed that he frowned at her .  \nShe heard his words come out of his mouth, but his voice told her \nsomething different.  She saw that now, things between them would be \ndifferent.  He would no longer see her as a friend, more like a \npossable threat.  He would no longer trust her with anything.  She \nwanted to be friends and friends must be honest with each other. She \nwas now regretting her dicision. Maybe honesty wasn&#39;t the best polocy.\nShe walked along side him in silence.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker stops as he hears Spears&#39; story, his wolf face frowning. \nCould he \n&gt; accept Spears, if she&#39;d been a Predacon in the pase?
