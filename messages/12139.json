Aquarious, Nighteyes, and Paddletail \nhad thought and thought and thought of a way to escape but it seemed \nimpossible. They had to make contact with some Maximals. They had to get out \nand talk to there brothers and sister. If they didnt get out soon, they knew \nthese crule Predacons would reprogram them, or worse.\n    &quot;I cant take this anymore! PREDACONS! COME AND GET ME!&quot; Aquarious, the \ndolphin, screamed. He needed water to survive, and he had been without for \nseveral days. Soon, he would die.\n    &quot;Aquarious! Shh! If they come who knows what they might do to us!&quot; \nPaddletail said, nervously.\n    Nighteyes remain quiet. SH ewanted someone to come. Anything was better \nthan this. She was loseing her mind.\n\n"}}
