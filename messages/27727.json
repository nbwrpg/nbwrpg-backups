She was hurt, and he could see in his mind exactly \nwhere she was and what was wrong. He looks ahead of him in time to \nsee three blasts coming at him, too close to dodge. The blasts hit \nProwl, sending him flying back and spinning out of control.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Composer/Triggerhappy/Orchestra::\n&gt; \n&gt;           Composer crosses his arms.\n&gt; \n&gt;            &quot;Let&#39;s see what our work has accomplished,&quot; He said.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;           Triggerhappy gets hit in the right wing by Prowl&#39;s shots, \nand\n&gt; damages it, making Triggerhappy lose balance, tilting to the left a \nbit.\n&gt; Then, suddenly, Triggerhappy is hit by Brainstorm&#39;s photon blasts \nfrom\n&gt; behind, damaging him some more.  Triggerhappy tries to turn around, \nbut is\n&gt; hit by Chromedome&#39;s shots, and now he is badly damaged.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;And I thought Autobots were bad, these Maximals are like \ngiant\n&gt; bumblebees with an extralarge stinger!&quot; He said to himself.\n&gt; \n&gt;            Triggerhappy is starting to go down, his engines had \nbeen a\n&gt; little damaged as well.  Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have the logic to \nretreat, and\n&gt; so he turned around and began firing his photon blasters at Prowl.  \nThis\n&gt; Prowl was bugging him, Prowl was very fast, and had a sleek body.\n&gt; Triggerhappy would strike him down if it was the last thing he did \nin this\n&gt; battle.  Of course, Triggerhappy didn&#39;t have to fight alone.  He \nshouted\n&gt; down to Motormaster and the others, trying to make himself clear \nover his\n&gt; engines.  The ash started to get to him and his optics too.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;Hey guys!  We gotta scrap these muthas!!!&quot; He yelled \ndown.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;          Orchestra ran after Blacknightmare.  He went to her side.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &quot;It&#39;s been a while since I last engaged in combat.  The \nlast time\n&gt; I ever saw the face of war was centuries ago, when I was along \nComposer&#39;s\n&gt; side, always trying to do my stealthy work, but also observing the \nbattles,&quot;\n&gt; He said.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Orchestra slowly moved his arm towards Blacknightmare, \nslowly and\n&gt; silently attempting to put his arm around her waist.\n\n\n"}}
