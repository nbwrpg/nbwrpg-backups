The lesser outposts had been\neasily snatche=\r\nd and a lot of Bushidos had even jumped ship to\ncooperate. Good. The bigger=\r\n one still had to be secured more\ncompletely, but progress was showing at a=\r\n lot of places. Wherever the\nIron Skulls were underrepresented, though, the=\r\ny had been easily\nthwarted. But one battle was still running. The most impo=\r\nrtant one and\nthe symbolic key to victory.\n\nRelay.\n\nOnce the Parliament was=\r\n in his hands, the Maximals would be deeply\naffected and their morale would=\r\n lose them, making the rest a matter of\nnumbers and military superiority fo=\r\nr him. Things were going well.\n\n*******\n\nA Predacon bomber ran another pass=\r\n at the slowly rising Silver Wing\nfortifications, destroying an accumulated=\r\n effort to pieces of\nsmoldering scrap. He was then chased by two lighter Ma=\r\nximals who tried\nto shoot him down only to be terminated by the more prepar=\r\ned Preds\ninside the Parliament.\n\nDeadfur swore. This was a Coup, no mistake=\r\n, and he realized the Skulls\nhad a lot to win by pulling this one off. They=\r\n had locked themselves\nup, but the Silver Wings could seemingly not crack t=\r\nhat tough nut.\n\nDeadfur: Look, Razorwing, we don&#39;t have much of a choice. W=\r\ne&#39;ll have\nto blast the building open or something so as to really shake the=\r\nir\ndefenses down. I know they&#39;re prepared, but only for the obvious,\nmeanin=\r\ng your style of combat. My suggestion is collateral damage. They\nwon&#39;t expe=\r\nct that from you.\n\nHe turned to Remus for an opinion, then back to Razorwin=\r\ng.\n\n\n"}}
