If you want to assume\nthat your characters have captured the kitty kitty (Myrmidon) that is\ncool, or if you want to just let him go, that is cool too - your\nchoice, either one should prove to be an easy matter. He won&#39;t put up\nmuch of a fight against either.  :)\n\nFeel free to post in one or more of your bots into the meeting at the\nArk, I would love to have your input. :)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
