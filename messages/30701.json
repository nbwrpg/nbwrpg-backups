She \nkept her gaze skyward. &quot;So, like those stars, Mommy and Daddy are \nstill there, I just can&#39;t see them? But I can&#39;t hear them either. Or \nhug them. Or anything else.  What good is it to have them here, if \nyou can&#39;t hug them, or look at them, or play with them.&quot;  She sat on \nher hind legs and pouted. &quot;I don&#39;t get it. Why do bots leave in the \nfirst place? Why can&#39;t they just stay here forever?&quot;  She swatted her \npaw at a weed sticking up out of the ground,&quot;I don&#39;t like the Matrix. \nIt&#39;s mean. Worse than that spider bot I met once. I don&#39;t get it. Mom \nand Dad were Maximals.  So does the Matrix only take Maximals?  And \nif I&#39;m a predacon, then that means I won&#39;t see my mommy and daddy \never again huh?&quot;  She sniffled. &quot;It&#39;s just not fair and I don&#39;t like \nit. It&#39;s mean is what it is.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Nightlight::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They are there...&quot; said Nightlight &quot;When day comes you can&#39;t see \n&gt; them, but you know that they are there... the same happen with your \n&gt; mom and your dad... they always will be with you altought you can&#39;t \n&gt; see them...
