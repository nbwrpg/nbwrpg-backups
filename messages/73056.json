Tucson was one of those students\n&gt; &gt; wor=\r\nthy of such an ancient art. He performs the maneuver in draconic form,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nas he gracefully twists his body around to attempt to meet the blast with\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; his blocking maneuver. He spins swiftly on one foot, as his tail coils\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; around his body as part of the block.

I =\r\nam running with the thought that he is\n&gt; using a part of his body, an arm, =\r\nleg, tail?\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BACK IN CHARACTER&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The blast that contacts TUSCON is =\r\nsuper heated ionized matter heated\n&gt; to the point that it is almost energy,=\r\n sweeping across him and the\n&gt; others almost like water from a hose. It has=\r\n the capacity to literally\n&gt; melt the hardest metals and evaporate the less=\r\ner ones. It was this\n&gt; that TUSCON was trying to block, the searing hot mat=\r\nerial spraying\n&gt; across him!\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME leaped back well aware of the l=\r\nethal properties of plasma!\n&gt; His movements were agile and well coordinated=\r\n as he landed in a squat\n&gt; his weapons out and firing at the much larger MA=\r\nGMATRON!\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVOY grunted as the Plasma caught him in the chest knoc=\r\nking him\n&gt; backwards through the air and sent him slamming into the ground,=\r\n his\n&gt; broad chest black and burnt, smoke rising from its surface!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Is=\r\n that all you&#39;ve got?&quot; CONVOY chuckled as he struggled to sit up\n&gt; and then=\r\n coughed up a dark fluid. It&#39;s going to take more than that!&quot;\n&gt; Despite his=\r\n bravado he was slow about getting to his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; MAGMATRON laughed as h=\r\ne watched the result, LEO PRIME&#39;s attack seeming\n&gt; to be little more than a=\r\nn annoyance as he brushed it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dark form of the evil RODIMUS ju=\r\nst stared down TUSCON and the\n&gt; others, his weapon out, but casually slung =\r\nover his shoulder. &quot;What of\n&gt; Optimus?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said with a casual dis=\r\ndain.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Finish him.&quot; MAGMATRON said, &quot;He is nothing to us now but an em=\r\npty shell.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; DARK RODIMUS nodded and turned away he could see CRYOTEK m=\r\noving\n&gt; through the air at OPTIMUS PRIME as well, now in his great draconic=\r\n\n&gt; form his wings outstretched. &quot;Now, you are mine! There is no one here\n&gt; =\r\nto protect you from my breath! from my final attack!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a final bea=\r\nt of his wing he looked as if he were taking a breath,\n&gt; the very air becom=\r\ning frosty and cold as he smiled at the blackened\n&gt; form of OPTIMUS PRIME .=\r\n . . when a cannon blast erupted across the\n&gt; room lighting it up for a mom=\r\nent and struck CRYOTEK full on in the\n&gt; chest!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;KRACKTHOOM!!&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nNot while there is a amp left in my spark chamber will you touch the\n&gt; fram=\r\ne of Optimus ever again!&quot; said a familiar voice, one that caused\n&gt; DARK ROD=\r\nIMUS and even MAGMATRON to pause and look over.\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice was that of =\r\nRODIMUS PRIME, standing resplendently on the\n&gt; other side of the room, smok=\r\ne rising from the business end of his\n&gt; weapon.\n&gt; CRYOTEK landed in a heap =\r\non the far side of the battle, his wings\n&gt; burnt and tangled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Around R=\r\nODIMUS were standing four strange looking figures, three male\n&gt; and one fem=\r\nale.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1=\r\n443963172/view\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-C36991EB-5EF9-4454-A958-F921AD4F62D4\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stuck by the fatal p=\r\nroperties of Magmatron&#39;s blast, the Silver Dragon gathers what little stren=\r\ngth left as he stumbles back up onto all fours. &nbsp;Down but not out, he =\r\nsteps over to Rodimus Prime, now seeing for himself that one of them was an=\r\n evil clone. &nbsp;He takes a deep breath.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; One o=\r\nf you is real but one of you isn&#39;t . &nbsp;The real Rodimus was given a gif=\r\nt by the old Silver Dragon who lived in the cave above the Ark. &nbsp;Could=\r\n you now show me that gift? &nbsp;That is the real Rodimus Prime.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He could barely move but he was determined to put the matte=\r\nr to rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for =\r\nthings you already posses. &nbsp;Nothing is worth more than family and frie=\r\nnds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Feb 7, 2012, at 4:37 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n=\r\n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; OOC - Writing this here, and I assume all the Maximals=\r\n/Predacons are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; together with Tuscon.  if I&#39;m incorrect in things (=\r\naka they&#39;re separated&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; while being rushed by the Sharkticons), let =\r\nme know and will rewrite!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC: Basically they are kind of bunched =\r\nup, yep. :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As they were seemin=\r\ngly rusehd by a legion of SHARKTICONS, the PREDACONS were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; faced wi=\r\nth a contradiction from the days of old  - the Predacacons were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ba=\r\nrely in many cases bigger than the Sharkticons, who had much more intense&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; numbers and were deadly in close range!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT f=\r\nell back, &quot;WE will be overwhelmed in close quarters.

RISE!&quot; With&lt;br&gt;\nthat he transformed into his shark mode an=\r\nd began to fly as did the&lt;br&gt;\nSHARTICONS with him rising around the upper s=\r\nides of the massive cave!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith large, micro serrated teeth at leas=\r\nt three launched themselves at&lt;br&gt;\nDINOBOT, coming at him with a menacing f=\r\nerocity!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwhile RAT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE face their own enemies=\r\n as each of&lt;br&gt;\nthem have two SHARKTICONS flying at them, their mouths open=\r\n wide, the&lt;br&gt;\nteeth ready to rend flesh, bone and metal!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nVICEGRIP=\r\n is also beset with SHARKTICONS of his own as they circled&lt;br&gt;\naround to st=\r\nrike at him!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC: Don&#39;t forget, they are Sharkticons, individually=\r\n they are push&lt;br&gt;\novers - although there are a lot of them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With the blast coming fast and furious, Tucso=\r\nn swiftly reacts and without&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a fit of rage but a quiet, swift and =\r\ngraceful interlude of dexterity and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; balance, he attempts to deflec=\r\nt the blast with a complex blocking maneuver&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; using a combination o=\r\nf Tai Chi and deflective artistry only taught by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yoketron himself,=\r\n which was rarely taught to anyone except to those he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; felt were de=\r\nserving of the training.  Tucson was one of those students&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worthy =\r\nof such an ancient art.  He performs the maneuver in draconic form,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; as he gracefully twists his body around to attempt to meet the blast with=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his blocking maneuver.  He spins swiftly on one foot, as his tail=\r\n coils&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; around his body as part of the block.  He hoped it would he=\r\nlp, his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; comrades were depending on him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It would=\r\n almost appear that Master Yoketron was alive and well inside&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucs=\r\non.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC: I am unsure what Tuscon is using to actually block the Pl=\r\nasma&lt;br&gt;\nblast coming from Magmatron? I am running with the thought that he=\r\n is&lt;br&gt;\nusing a part of his body, an arm, leg, tail?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;BACK IN C=\r\nHARACTER&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe blast that contacts TUSCON is super heated ionize=\r\nd matter heated&lt;br&gt;\nto the point that it is almost energy, sweeping across =\r\nhim and the&lt;br&gt;\nothers almost like water from a hose. It has the capacity t=\r\no literally&lt;br&gt;\nmelt the hardest metals and evaporate the lesser ones. It w=\r\nas this&lt;br&gt;\nthat TUSCON was trying to block, the searing hot material spray=\r\ning&lt;br&gt;\nacross him!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME leaped back well aware of the lethal=\r\n properties of plasma!&lt;br&gt;\nHis movements were agile and well coordinated as=\r\n he landed in a squat&lt;br&gt;\nhis weapons out and firing at the much larger MAG=\r\nMATRON!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBIG CONVOY grunted as the Plasma caught him in the chest k=\r\nnocking him&lt;br&gt;\nbackwards through the air and sent him slamming into the gr=\r\nound, his&lt;br&gt;\nbroad chest black and burnt, smoke rising from its surface!&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Is that all you&#39;ve got?&quot; CONVOY chuckled as he struggled to sit up=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nand then coughed up a dark fluid. It&#39;s going to take more than that!&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nDespite his bravado he was slow about getting to his feet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMAG=\r\nMATRON laughed as he watched the result, LEO PRIME&#39;s attack seeming&lt;br&gt;\nto =\r\nbe little more than an annoyance as he brushed it off.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe dark fo=\r\nrm of the evil RODIMUS just stared down TUSCON and the&lt;br&gt;\nothers, his weap=\r\non out, but casually slung over his shoulder. &quot;What of&lt;br&gt;\nOptimus?&quot; DARK R=\r\nODIMUS said with a casual disdain.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Finish him.&quot; MAGMATRON said, &quot;=\r\nHe is nothing to us now but an empty shell.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDARK RODIMUS nodded a=\r\nnd turned away he could see CRYOTEK moving&lt;br&gt;\nthrough the air at OPTIMUS P=\r\nRIME as well, now in his great draconic&lt;br&gt;\nform his wings outstretched. &quot;N=\r\now, you are mine! There is no one here&lt;br&gt;\nto protect you from my breath! f=\r\nrom my final attack!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith a final beat of his wing he looked as i=\r\nf he were taking a breath,&lt;br&gt;\nthe very air becoming frosty and cold as he =\r\nsmiled at the blackened&lt;br&gt;\nform of OPTIMUS PRIME . . . when a cannon blast=\r\n erupted across the&lt;br&gt;\nroom lighting it up for a moment and struck CRYOTEK=\r\n full on in the&lt;br&gt;\nchest!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;KRACKTHOOM!!&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;=\r\nNot while there is a amp left in my spark chamber will you touch the&lt;br&gt;\nfr=\r\name of Optimus ever again!&quot; said a familiar voice, one that caused&lt;br&gt;\nDARK=\r\n RODIMUS and even MAGMATRON to pause and look over.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe voice was =\r\nthat of RODIMUS PRIME, standing resplendently on the&lt;br&gt;\nother side of the =\r\nroom, smoke rising from the business end of his&lt;br&gt;\nweapon.&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK lan=\r\nded in a heap on the far side of the battle, his wings&lt;br&gt;\nburnt and tangle=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAround RODIMUS were standing four strange looking figures, thre=\r\ne male&lt;br&gt;\nand one female.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1443963172/view&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1443963172/view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group e=\r\nmail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-C36991EB-5EF9-4454-A958-F921AD4F62D4--\r\n\n"}}
