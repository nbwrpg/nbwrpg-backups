She opened her eyes and \nlooked\n&gt; &gt; about.  Her vision was somewhat blurred.  She saw a figure \nstanding\n&gt; &gt; near by.  She tried to talk, but she could only whisper,&quot;where am \nI?\n&gt; &gt; who are you?&quot;  She felt another pulse of energy surge through her \nand\n&gt; &gt; her body shook violently for a bit.  She closed her eyes and \nwaited\n&gt; &gt; for the shaking to stop.  She could still feel pain in her arms \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; the tubes.  She tried to move her arms and legs, but they would \nnot\n&gt; &gt; respond.  She felt a single tear run down her cheek.  She wanted \nto\n&gt; &gt; stop shaking and get up, but her body wouldn&#39;t listen to her.  She\n&gt; &gt; felt fear, cold,pain, and sorrow all at once.  She couldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; understand why this was happeneing.  She was starting to forget \nher\n&gt; &gt; trip to the Matrix.  She could remember a voice from somewhere, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; the memory was fading.  She  felt her body stop shaking and now \nwas a\n&gt; &gt; only shivering slightly.  She felt her spark pound in her chest.  \nshe\n&gt; &gt; opened her eyes and her vision was clear this time.  She saw Black\n&gt; &gt; Aracnia near her.  She tried to smile.  She\n&gt; &gt; whispered, &quot;black....arac....nia&quot;  her voice jsut wouldn&#39;t come \nout\n&gt; &gt; like she wanted it too.  Her body felt cold, now damp, and heavy \nto\n&gt; &gt; her.  She just looked at Black Aracnia, not being able to speak at\n&gt; &gt; the moment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Black Aracnia saw the mouse awaken. It had taken long \nenough.\n&gt; &gt; Now, she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had to wait until the spasams stoped and then, of course, she \nwould\n&gt; &gt; need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in bed for a day or so.
