I have enough problems.&quot;\n\nShe opened her link,&quot;You want your friend. You meet me at the \nentrance. Don&#39;t try anything.  I will be there with him.&quot;\n\nShe closed her link and walked in and grabbed Airbomber by the wrist \nand drew her gun.  She aimed it for his head. &quot;You will come with me. \nYour friends want you back.&quot;  She sighed. &quot;Look. I&#39;m doing you a \nfavor.  The only thing I want in return, it that if I call on your \nhelp, you help me.  Got it? I don&#39;t want to kill you. So you will \ncome with me now, quietly and don&#39;t try anything.  And then you will \nbe released and returned to your friends.  Nod your head if you \nunderstand me.&quot;  She waited for Airbomber to reapond.\n\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Infectra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Infectra calls KitKat on her Commlink*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Infectra: &quot;What&#39;s going to become of Airbomber?

Deemos was charred and burnt.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Let&#39;s go back, we suffered alot of damage, I think we need more \nbots for out army.&quot; Deemos said.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;We are 7 now, should we join Psuedo?&quot; Doom Ice asked.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Nope, we kill Psuedo.&quot; Deemos replied.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kiss him goodbye then.&quot; Doom Ice said. She smiled, that \nmade Deemos smile.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;What about Airbomber?&#39; Artist askes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Don&#39;t worry, his death may be slow and torturous, but he died \nfor the right cause, my cause, and the universal cause, to protect \nall bots everywhere, the Chosen One cause.&quot; Deemos said. He \ninvisioned himself standing on top of the Earth, poisoning everyone \nand ruling the universe. He envisions himself destroying Unicron, and \ngetting possesion of both the Matrix of Leadership and Matrix of \nConquest. His dreams must come true, with or without Inzola. Inzola&#39;s \nabsense has boosted his confidence, that little slagging homewrecker, \nStranato did him a favor. The Chosen Ones start back to base, the \nautoguns blasting Rizopas once more in the back before they walk \naway. Rizopas follows, one hand on his back. There were 7 now, but \nwho knows who could join them next?...\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\n\n\n"}}
