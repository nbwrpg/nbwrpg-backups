Night =\r\nShift, we got definite Minion and Insecticon signatures all around this pla=\r\nce.  I got a feel&#39;n that if we&#39;re gonna get Cheetor outa here, we&#39;re gonna =\r\nneed some backup.&quot;\n\nHe sends the feed back to Night Shift.\n\n&quot;Gotchya, woah,=\r\n you&#39;re right.  It might take more than just us ta get &#39;em outa here.  I&#39;m =\r\ngonna try&#39;n connect with Rodimus but I&#39;m not so sure we&#39;re in range.&quot;\n\nHe s=\r\ntays in vehicle form, and tries his long range radio system, to contact Rod=\r\nimus.\n\n&quot;Night Shift ta Rodimus, over.  Rat Trap and I are on a rescue missi=\r\non, ta find Cheetor, and now, we got multiple Minion and Decepticon signatu=\r\nres runn&#39;n rampant and there&#39;s only two of us here.  I can transmit our exa=\r\nct location right now, and hopefully you&#39;ll be able ta send some bots out h=\r\nere ta give us a hand.

He keeps quiet and uses his nose and\n&gt; ea=\r\nrs to direct him toward the source of the fire blasts. He hoped he could\n&gt; =\r\nat least see if Cheetor was anywhere close by. But like everything else, it=\r\n\n&gt; would be a shot in the dark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rat Trap moved forward, =\r\nusing his small size and stealth he could easily\n&gt; discern the obvious sign=\r\natures of both Minion as well as the insectile\n&gt; creatures that they had fa=\r\nced before.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he came though the last of the brush he could finally m=\r\nake out the scene!\n&gt; \n&gt; All around were more bodies of offline insectile cr=\r\neatures as well as\n&gt; Insecticons, but in the air a battle was raging! There=\r\n were many duplicates\n&gt; of the deluxe Insecticons of Chop Shop, Ransack, Ba=\r\nrrage and even Venom was\n&gt; flying through the air - all of them having a de=\r\nfinite minion energy\n&gt; signature. At the same time the insectile creatures =\r\nwere also present in\n&gt; large numbers, attacking these insecticon clones, it=\r\n looked as if a storm of\n&gt; mechanized insects were fighting back and forth.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In the center of all of this two large figures were battling, one loo=\r\nking\n&gt; like a large heavily armored wasp/mantid cross breed and the other l=\r\nooking\n&gt; like a powerful two headed dragon. Both of them moved around each =\r\nother\n&gt; warily as they looked each other over. The dual headed dragon of co=\r\nurse had\n&gt; the minion signature, while the other had the other was insectil=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rat Trap was taking all of this in several Insecticons landed on=\r\n the\n&gt; ground beside him bursting the over hanging brush, one was a Ransack=\r\n clone,\n&gt; the other a barrage. However what was immediately obvious was tha=\r\nt they were\n&gt; both offline, more victims of the battle above.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the m=\r\noment there was no sign of Cheetor, but the battle is large enough\n&gt; that t=\r\nhey could be in another section, or possibly not even here at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TA=\r\nG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
