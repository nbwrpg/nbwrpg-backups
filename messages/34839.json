He \nlistens\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; intently\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; to Ironhide&#39;s speech. He is silent as he takes in the \nunsettling\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; information. He approaches the Speakers podium, clears his\n&gt; throat\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; and begins his speech, &quot;I, I am ready to accept your \ncharge to\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that I have trained long for this task, and will\n&gt; strive to\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; complete it as diplomatically as possible,&quot; he \nsighs, &quot;but I\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; doubt\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; that the possibility of a quiet end will ever occur.&quot; He \npauses\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; for\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; measure, &quot;I have almost completed the selectioning \nprocess. I\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; have chosen up till this time: Jazz, JetV, Crossroads,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Trailblazer,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Metalwarhawk, Gold bug, and just recently, Artemis. All \nof these\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; bots I feel are suited for the mission, and their skills\n&gt; would be\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; vital\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; to our success. Do any council members disagree with my\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; choices?&quot; Pacifix steps down to await the Council.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; On 15 May 2001, at 18:51, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Okay everyone, I am really letting the creative \njuices\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; flow\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; here.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If some of this dosent work with your characters or \nstories in\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RPG, just say that it is a different time than which \nyour\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; character\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came from. :) Also all the Autobots in this scene have \nbeen\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; remade\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smaller for fuel reasons. Also for a note, Ironhide has \nbeen\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; remade\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the Matrix, and due to his history, he is one of \nthe main\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; characters.  Here we go.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The massive iron doors Pacifix walks up too open up, \nthe gears\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grinding, and it leads into an enormous chambre, well \nlight by\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; energon\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powered lights. The room is a large dome, with many \nchairs and\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; tables\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where a hundred Autobots sit. Most of the Autobots were \ngiven\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; this\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high privelage for the name they made during one of the \ngreat\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; wars.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Painted all over are the symbols of Maximal, Predacon, \nand\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Autobot. In\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the centre, over the highest stand, is a large image of \nthe\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Autobots\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greatest Hero, Optimus Prime. All along the walls there \nare\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; pictures\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of legends who have ceased to exist, and died for the \ncause.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Brawn&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; face is at one end, Ratchet and Prowl at another, \nIronhide at\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; one\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corner, surrounded by many Autobots that preexist them. \nOne\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; though,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is very famous, Alpha Trion. In the centre of all \nthe\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; podiums is\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an energon fountain. It harmoneusly gushes a soft pink \nenergy,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives the room a light pink colour.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a large hush over the crowd, as a red old \nAutobot, at\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; the top\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and centre of the room stands up. He then begins to \nspeak, and\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other Autobots follow his every word. &quot;Greetings \nPacifix&quot; he\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; says\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; in a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rough deep voice. The Autobot Ironhide&#39;s voice can be \nheard by\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; all. He\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaks with wisdom, and kind words. To his right and \nleft,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; standing\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind him are Sunstreaker and Sideswipe, his body \nguards. To\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; his\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right sitting down is his peer, the old Autobot known \nas Kup,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; who\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watches all of this with an unussually sense of \ncalmness.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Beside\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the once human, now robot Spike. A few more \nrecognizable\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Autobots\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sit around. &quot;As you know&quot; Ironhide continues, &quot;We have \nfinally\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; achieved what we set out to millions of years ago. \nPeace&quot; he\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; says,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every robot in the room nodding at the last word. &quot;But \nit\n&gt; is an\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; uneasy\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peace, for even though we have all but stopped the\n&gt; Decepticons,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; we\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have reasons to believe their decendants, the Predacons,\n&gt; do not\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; follow\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this peace willfully&quot; he says in a grave tone. &quot;We even \nhave\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; strong\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that points to the fact that they have released\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Decepticon\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; war Criminals from confinment, to try to change time on \nthe\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; planet\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Earth&quot; he says, thinking back to that time, four \nmillion years\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; ago,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when the Ark, and Nemesis crash landed on the planet, \nbringing\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their million year Strugle. He remembers the battles \nthey had\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; there,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and how it helped turn the tide of War for the \nAutobots. &quot;We\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; sent\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scouting ship to earth already, with two Autobot \nVeterans.\n&gt; They\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not made contact with us however, and their ship is not\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; emmiting a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signal. We fear the Predacons may be on to us. That is \nwhy we\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; have\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; summoned you Pacifix. The Predacons will not notice if a\n&gt; rookie\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commander goes missing, but we have reason to believe \nyou are\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect leader for this mission. We also know that one \nof your\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; friends\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was in that scout ship, and understand you will most \nlikely\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; want\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; retrieve him. We have faith in your Pacifist reasoning, \nand\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; think\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would best represent us. We have already selected a few\n&gt; Autobot\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; veterans to go with you, and we understand you are also\n&gt; putting\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; crew\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of you own together&quot; Ironhide says, pausing for Pacifix \nto\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; respond.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
