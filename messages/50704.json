The Commander turns around in his \nchair \n&gt; to look out the large window. All he could see was the last of what \n&gt; seemd to be a fire trail going down in the hills north of the base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: What on Cybertron was that?!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile in the control room Kup was still at the sensor station \n&gt; when it picked up a signal. It was close and fast. The station \n&gt; started a siren and started to flash alert lights.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup had been paying little attention to the screens and the \nalarms \n&gt; and lights caused him to jump, nearly falling out of his chair. He \n&gt; gets back up and tries to ID what the trouble was.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: What in the bloody hell?! If this is the Predacons I&#39;m going \n&gt; to incenerate their hides!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup then figured out what had happaned, from the sensor data.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup was about to contact Rodimus when the Commander&#39;s voice came \n&gt; over the comm system.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Prime to control room, what&#39;s goind on? Did you \npick \n&gt; up that activity outside?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup hit a button so he could reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: We picked it up alright, Sir. It scared the hell out of me! \n&gt; The sensors read it as some sort of crystalized structure. Want me \nto \n&gt; go check it out?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Not alone, old timer, I&#39;m coming also. I&#39;ll be \nright \n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kup: Old timer?!
