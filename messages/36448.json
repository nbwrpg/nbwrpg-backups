Not Nemesis Enforcer!&quot; he said as he burst out into evil cackling for \nno real reason.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer remained in the CR pool, still a little ways to go before \ngetting out of the pool.\n\n===\n\nIn Brazil, South America, Choran jumped up in excitement.  &quot;The ship!  It \njust passed Pluto!&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; \n\n&quot;Predator, you idiot!  That&#39;s the farthest planet from the Sun in this \npitiful solar system.  That means in only a short eighteen cycles our ship \nwill land and carry us back to safety!&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent!  And with the information we have we will earn enough money to \nreturn with larger numbers and capture our prey.  Or we will be the heralds \nof a mighty Predacon warlord who wishes to easily squash all the enemy forces \non this pitiful rock even!&quot;\n\n&quot;The first one is possible, but the second one is a long shot.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up, Predator!&quot;\n\n"}}
