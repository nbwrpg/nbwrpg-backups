Two large claws extend \nfrom\n&gt; one large piece of silver metalic body with orange legs sorounding \nit, and\n&gt; a tail with a stigner curled around the body. The hum from the \ncomputer\n&gt; eminates from this body.\n&gt; \n&gt; Computer: &quot;Unit free of rocks, commencing reactivation...&quot; with \nthat the\n&gt; computer hum dies down, replaced with a groan from the body. It \ntrys to\n&gt; stand up and right itself uncurling its legs from around its body. \nAfter it\n&gt; rights itself its eyes slowly open, but when it sees the robots \nsurrounding\n&gt; it, it nervously starts clicking its pinshers and moves backward.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strange Scorpion: &quot; You&#39;re, you&#39;re not Megatron&quot; it stammers weakly \nwith a\n&gt; hint of worry. Looking at the giant female he stammers \nagain, &quot;youre not\n&gt; Blackaraknia&quot; his claws start to click faster showing his worry and \nhe\n&gt; starts to speak to no one in particular &quot;where the slag am I, \nwhat&#39;s going\n&gt; on&quot; then realizes he&#39;s surrounded again silences and the look of \nworry\n&gt; replaces his face again.\n\n\n"}}
