Radistor looked to see who shot at him and turned back as\nOblitertron fired at him and threw his sword. Radistor leapt the shot with\nAirbomber&#39;s jumping power but fell down as the sword came to him. Radistor\nlifted his hands as the sword went crashing into him, slicing into his chest\nand sticking there. Radistor reached up and pulled the sword from his chest,\ndropping it, he walked toward Oblitertron.\n\n&quot;You are a powerful adversary, I commend you and recomend you, for the\nMaximals, why do you fight us? We are all with each other now, and I&#39;m\ntrusting that the Alliance wil boot you out if they found you doing this, so\nI offer you another chance, I am not one to forsake my olympian ways.&quot;\nRadistor said, obviously, the confused Stranato, leader of the Radicons, was\nin control...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 20, 2000 4:14 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars RPG\n\n\n(Liono, you are just ticking me of man.  You mode really bad (no offense\nintended), but this takes the cake.  No chance in &quot;The Void&quot; am I going to\naccep that mode.  How the heck did Tigerhawk salvage the &quot;Nemesis&quot; fusion\ncannon?  How is he lifting it?  How is he aiming?  How is he still standing\nform the kickback?   How is he supplying it ith power?  That is a mode, and\nif you continue with it, you&#39;re going to get kicked out of the RPG.  Alo,\nCode, don&#39;t post damage.  Grabbing and twisting my hands, is a posting\ndamage.  You can say attempts, but you can&#39;t say you did.   Don&#39;t do that\nplease.  Wait until I actually reply.  Thank you)\n\n\nOblitertron/Nemesis Enforcer/Hades/Anubis/Beachcomber/Unitron:\n\n\n\nOblitertron chuckled deeply as Radastro formed, shot shitting him, though\nthe\nmachine gun and gattling gun&#39;s bullets didn&#39;t really do much against his\nheavily armored form, remembering how easy it had been to crush him.  Seeing\nhim to begin to charge towards him, Oblitertron pulled his sword out of\nsubspace in a blink of an eye, throwing the sword at the approaching\nRidister&#39;s chest, firing an optic blast at Ridistor&#39;s left knee as the sword\nleft his hand.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Hmmm...I&#39;d prefer waiting until the Maximals had their backs turned, but\nwhen Zardus gives orders, I take them...mosto f the time.&quot; Nemesis chuckled,\nraising his rapid fire laser rifle, firing off twenty rapid blasts of laser\nenergy at the back of Radistor&#39;s head.  &quot;ALLIANCE, KILL &#39;EM, KILL &#39;EM ALL!&quot;\n\n---\n\nAnubis chuckled.  &quot;By the Void, d�j� vu.&quot; he said, slowly edging away,\nraising his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Radistor&#39;s side.\n\n---\n\nHades chuckled as well.  &quot;I thought we killed those fools.  Must be using\nmagic or something.&quot; he &quot;joked&quot; raising his missile launcher and firing a\nrocket off at the back of Radistor&#39;s left knee.\n\n---\n\nUnitron was watching the display of stupidity from the Maximals.\nIntercepted\ncoms told him the attacking gestalt, who he&#39;d though they had killed,\ndespite\ndirect orders, was now going to get them all further beaten.  As they had\nbefore, killing of treaties.  HE HAD TO HELP!  Putting his rifles in\nsubspace, he took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at the\nmiddle\nof Radister&#39;s back.\n\n---\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMake new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\nhttp://click.egroups.com/1/5530/10/_/_/_/961532083/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
