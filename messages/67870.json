Yeah I know\nthere is the old hatreds, but except what is happening now with Hydras\nwhat have the two overall factions been doing here on earth?? Have\nthere been any real sustained conflicts?? It looks to me like both\nsides pretty don&#39;t fight much as they are both looking over thier\nshoulders waiting on Unicron to attack. You may have a skirmish, but I\nhave not really seen any attacks from the preds on the maxi&#39;s. \n\nInfact, why are the Maximals and Predicons here on earth? and what do\nthey hope to accomplish? I would assume the Preds came for some dark\npurpose and the Maximals came to protect?? but from what??\n\nHelp! \n\nThese questions may be answered elswhere, and I apologize of they are,\nbut any help would be greatly appreciated. :)\n\nTanks\nPreston\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
