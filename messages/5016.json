She \nlooked at Cybershark.\n&quot;Who is your commander?&quot;\nShe prayed it wasn&#39;t HellBeast.  If he answered with that name then she \nwould take off as fast as she could.  If it wasn&#39;t, she would think about \nhaving the repair work done to her wing.  But why was he so....so..., she \ncouldn&#39;t put her finger on it.  He was showing that he cared about her. That \nmade her very defensive.  With his persistance in wanting her to have her \nwing fixed, she wondered if it was a trap.  But he made sence, her wing \nwould rip apart eventually if it wasn&#39;t fixed.\n\n----------Original Message--------\nFrom: Dachande85@...\nReply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nTo: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n::CyberShark::\n\n&quot;I am offering you a chance to be repaired, that&#39;s all, if you wish to\nleave after that then you will be free to go.
