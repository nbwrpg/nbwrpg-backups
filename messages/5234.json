To grind them up and recycle thier remanes into\n&quot;modern art&quot;. Somehow he knew his instincts weren&#39;t those of a wild wolf,\nbut those of a warrior whos fealt more than his share of losses. Did the\nothers Shadow Wing spoke of feal the same, or was it a simple character\nmalfunction? He had to know the truth.\n\n&quot;These others you mentioned? Lunarpine asked in a lost voice,&quot; Who are they?\nAre they animals like us or are they still protoforms?&quot; He didn&#39;t know\nexactly what a &quot;protoform&quot; is but for an inexplicable reason the word fit.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Logo morph &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2000 6:17 AM\nSubject: Re: The great North\n\n\n&gt; OOC:(Have fun on your vacation.
