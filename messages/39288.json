The events page should be fully up to date as of this \n&gt;point. If I missed something on it, someone tell me. As soon as the new \n&gt;login system is out, the site will be much more easilly updatable.\n&gt;\n&gt;So far, I&#39;ve planned the following for the new login script:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Everything the current one offers.\n&gt;- Members will be able to post fanfiction and fanart without having to go \n&gt;through the slow proccess of having me put it up.\n&gt;- The council will be able to create polls and update the site.\n&gt;- If KSL wants is fine with it, I can implement a member profile thing much \n&gt;like his NBWRPers site.\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s all for the moment. I think I forgot half of it though.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., lordofdarkness11001@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hey everybody i will be making my own events page for this rpg on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new website\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
