PREPARE&quot;\n\n. . . . . . . . . . \n\nMeanwhile up above, as Legacy was sounding the alarm the massive form of Marauder appeared in the skies! \n\nGiant wings beat the air lazily as he dropped out of the skies. His body was well defended, covered as it were in thick ice blue and black armored plates. His entire frame was thick and powerful, mute testimony to his function, to bring war and destruction!  Powerful claws hung not only from his feet but also from the tips of his wings ready to snatch and rend anything that close enough. Behind him, Marauder&#39;s powerful long tail trailed, looking ready smash and crush, although the rear most section almost looked as if it could retract to extend perhaps a cannon, or a blade. However to his front was perhaps his more unique feature. Instead of a single draconic head, there were two, both of them grinning as the great beast descended! \n\n&quot;You have what is mine!&quot; said on of the heads, &quot;You will release your minion captive, or you will be destroyed!&quot; said the other. \n\nIt is quite obvious that at the moment this Marauder was unaware that there were two . . . or perhaps more minions here. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Legacy/Marauder)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
