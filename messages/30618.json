Ha ha ha&quot; he finished, he then looked at \nStratus. &quot;And\n&gt; you, do you wish to serve the Decepticon Empire&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron looked at Cyclonus, &quot;Then I look forward to you working \nfor me&quot; he\n&gt; said smiling. He then looked at Triggerhappy and Skullgrin. &quot;The \nsame for\n&gt; you&quot; he said, then he snarled. &quot;Galvatron wasted all four of your \ntalents,\n&gt; I could see that through his eyes, but I wont, we will take every\n&gt; oportunity to crush our enemies&quot; he finished, as his eyes began to \nglow\n&gt; red. &quot;Bodicon eh&quot; he said, now adressing the Bodicons, &quot;Then I \nexpect your\n&gt; loyalty, and look forward to seeing your results on the battle \nfield.\n&gt; Motormaster&quot; He blurted quickly. &quot;Get Wildrider and yourselves to \nthe\n&gt; repair bay&quot; he said pointing at Wildrider&#39;s corpse. &quot;Decepticons, \nwe have\n&gt; an empire to retake. Decepticons, FOREVER&quot; He screamed. Motormaster \npicked\n&gt; up Wildrider, and took him inside the ship, Megatron addressed his \ntroops\n&gt; again. &quot;Does anyone here have technilogical skills, to repair my \nmind?&quot; he\n&gt; asked.\n\n\n"}}
