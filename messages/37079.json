He WAS an offworlder and an Alpha \nCentaurian, but he was also a Transformer. He was born and raised on \nCybertron... but in a way he felt the stranger would never\nunderstand. \nHe swallows hard, wishing he didn&#39;t have to be secretive. His eyes \nclose, trying to rest.\n       (OOC: His injuries are substantial. It looks like he&#39;s been \nmauled by something huge. His wings are pitted and knawed, and it \nlooks like he had taken some lazerfire. His cockpit is cracked,\nalmost \nto the point of shattering. His lazerfire holes have melted edges. \nThey appear to be the only thing keeping his cockpit together.\n       Internally it looks like a lazer bolt has bounced around. A \nfuel line has been severed and Redhot is on the verge of bleeding to \ndeath. Other Systems are singed or burned. What appeared to be his \n...engine... took the most substantal injuries. As alien as it \nappears, it looks remotely &#39;familiar&#39; and BC could possibly bluff his \nway around.)\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n******************************\n\n\n"}}
