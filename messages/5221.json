I don&#39;t like it \n            in here neither!&quot; A=\r\nrrow said. Stranato looked at him like he was \n            going to kill hi=\r\nm. Arrow cowered in the corner.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;You see? That&#39;s why you fail, Arrow, you d=\r\non&#39;t \n            stand up against Stranato and his stupid rules! This was =\r\nour idea!&quot; \n            Train Wreck yelled.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Yeah, and nobody is getting ou=\r\nt of here until we \n            are all friends again.&quot; Airbomber said.&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Str=\r\nanato sighed in disapointment. Arrow stood up \n            again, and start=\r\ned pacing the room. Stronghold and Blender started \n            to look in =\r\ncracks in the wall for something to drink, despite plenty \n            of w=\r\nater in this room. Train Wreck was discussing something with \n            A=\r\nrrow and Airbomber, and Stronghold and Blender joined them before \n        =\r\n    long.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&quot;Say, you guys, it&#39;s really lonely sitting here \n            with=\r\n nothing to do, and--&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n         =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Shut up and get your ass over here! Of course you \n=\r\n            can join us!&quot; Arrow said, cutting off Stranato. Stranato walks =\r\nover \n            and sits with them. Stronghold pulls out a pack of playin=\r\ng \n            cards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Plintissa and Dracona smile to each other and walk \n =\r\n           up and out of the secret passgeway, taking a walk across a \n    =\r\n        field...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_09E3_01BFE21C.7D4FB2C0--\r\n\n"}}
