She \nlifted herself into the air, shifted herself to the right. Two shots, \nincluding missiles went by her. As she raised her arm to fire back with a \nmini missile that layed underneath her forearm, she was hit on the left \nshoulder by a signature seaking missile. She was thrown to the ground. The \nspikes on her shoulder shattered off of her, falling to the ground like \nshattering glass.\n\nShe growled from the shot, trying to move. She had to move before they \nkilled her. She made herself crawl. She looked back to the group.\n\n&quot;You think I&#39;m a Maximal. I am not. I am one of you. Sadly that it sounds.&quot; \nShe stood up.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
