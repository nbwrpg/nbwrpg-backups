More and more he felt most \n&gt; confident in Rodimus&#39;s abilities to return to his leadership duties.  He \n&gt; had held back hoping Rodimus would make the right decision, to his \n&gt; assurance he had.  He nodds in agreement of getting out of there, and also \n&gt; respects Perceptor&#39;s wish to have his feedom of choice.  And then he gets \n&gt; the all clear from Dark Hawk to help him.  Tucson Prime kneels down and \n&gt; gently picks him up, and carefully, without hurting him, places the stasis \n&gt; cuffs on Darkhawk.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, Dark Hawk is sedated and securred.  The way you&#39;re speaking \n&gt; of Perceptor better be a safe route. I don&#39;t wish to endanger the lives of \n&gt; anyone, especially Darkhawk who is seriously injured.  If you deviate from \n&gt; this route you speak of, you&#39;ll have me to answer to.  And believe me, you \n&gt; do not want to catch me in a bad mood.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right Mr. Shadey, he don&#39;t take no nonsense from anyone.  Now, \n&gt; let&#39;s make it outa here in one piece while we still can&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson directs an ear toward Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Good work Rodimus.  Your decisions would have also been mine.  I now \n&gt; believe that soon enough you will be able to assume leadership duties.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, with Straight Shot&#39;s coming online once more, Rat Trap senses \n&gt; another Autobot signature appearing on his list of active Maximals and \n&gt; Autobots.  He looks to Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Legacy, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but my energy signature reading&#39;s just \n&gt; picked up the pressense of another Autobot.  Hmm, wonder who it is...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He pulls of a profiler on his gauntlett device, and drums up Straight \n&gt; Shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ooooh Primus, things are gonna get interestn&#39; at the Ark.  It&#39;s another \n&gt; femme bot, and this one&#39;s got some spunk.. And a fist full of arrows... \n&gt; Umm, wouldn&#39;t wanna insult her that&#39;s for sure...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the Ark..\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot manages to find a supply of energon and gets herself enough \n&gt; to get back on her feet.  She sips on it slowly as she now gains more \n&gt; strength throughout her body.  She walks over to Elita.  It had been a \n&gt; long time since she had seen her last.  She was elated to see how much she \n&gt; had grown and shows her elation through a smile.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Elita, it&#39;s been a long time, I missed you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She then looks to Lord Elder.  She had met him at one time, but did not \n&gt; get the chance to really know him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Right?  It&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were introduced \n&gt; a while ago, but, maybe ya don&#39;t remember who I am.  If not, I&#39;m Straight \n&gt; Shot, Tucson&#39;s half sister and his all time favorite weapon of choice. \n&gt; But we&#39;re not cheating, he does all the aiming and firing when he uses me. \n&gt; Oh, yeah, ya might not know that part. My alt modes are Cross Bow and \n&gt; regular bow.  So, um, speakn&#39; of my half brother..  He is okay right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kup/Perceptor:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;ME!!! an autobot????&quot;laughted Perceptor as if had heard a Joke&quot;If as\n&gt;&gt; Predacon I felt bored sometimes... as Autobot, I would be a thousand \n&gt;&gt; more&quot;\n&gt;&gt; then he said gloomy and camly walked towards the tunnel that he cames\n&gt;&gt; from&quot;Yes, you and Nightlight were a refreshing change for me... Our\n&gt;&gt; &#39;friendship&#39; to name it somehow was something that I havent had in a \n&gt;&gt; while,\n&gt;&gt; and her... well she wanst like most of female Predacons that I have to \n&gt;&gt; deal\n&gt;&gt; with: Overobsessed Power hunger and vain withches.
