She stays on the\n&gt; � &gt; ground, and notices Nightlight being approached by Depp. A\n&gt; � &gt; growing sense of doom builds as she gets to her feet and fires two\n&gt; � &gt; disks at Depp. Immediately after firing the disks, she puts her gun\n&gt; � &gt; away and starts to sprint towards Depp thinking, &lt;&lt;I can&#39;t let this\n&gt; � &gt; happen...&gt;&gt; as she prepares for close combat mode.
