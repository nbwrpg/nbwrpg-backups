A slight wavering in the air disturbed a flock \nof parots that where resting on a branch nearby. The plank that had let the \nmonstorous things onto the planet extended again. The erie light once more \nspliied onto the scenery of the lush forest. But this time instead of giant \nmonsters coming from the door, a small, littel black fuzz ball with horns \nand bat wings flew out, flying into the night-time sky. Making little \nhumming noises that where out of tune...... The plank closed once more, \nreturning the forest to it&#39;s original form.*\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
