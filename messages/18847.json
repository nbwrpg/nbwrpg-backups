Turned to see that their leader had \nnot yet arrived. They pondered why Kit Kat would send so little forces. \nMegatron would not dare to attack now. Unless they where completely insane. \nAnd their still was the missing death. What happened to him?\n\nDestructor:: It seemed as if Kit Kat would not allow Drill Bit to go. So he \nlooked to dark mouse...&quot;Let us be off. The more time we waste here the more \nchances of our destruction grows.&quot; He tried not to show it but when Kit kat \nwalked off he was very dissapointed in her. She let her emotions cloud her \njudgment. He turned and flew out of the base not looking back. He was hopeful \nthat dark mouse would follow with out a problem. If not then she would only \nget in the way anyway.\n\n"}}
