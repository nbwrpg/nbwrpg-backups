She smiled up at him as he apologizes, but for what she didn&#39;t know. He&#39;d done nothing wrong, nothing at all.\nShe was about to tell him that when he kissed her again, basically making her forget everything besides the feel of his lips against hers and the taste of his mouth.\nShe sighed as he broke away from her and continued his apology, looking up at him with love.\nIron Raptor locks her optics on Prowls as he looked to her, seeing the massive amount of love filling his optics completely.\nShe actually found herself thinking of why Prowl didn&#39;t have a girlfriend already when she came along, thinking of just how much any fembot had missed if she had ever passed him up.\nShe relaxed fully in his arms as she saw him lean in close, meeting his lips with hers half way. Lightly stroking the back of his neck with her hand as their lips remained locked, thinking about how after the turmoil of getting in there to rescue her he deserved to relax a bit too.*\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
