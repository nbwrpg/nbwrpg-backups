On instinct programming he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into robot mode, and lied there, unmoving, eyes shut. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There were no more energon surges going through him, but he \n&gt; seemed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; quite dead. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        That&#39;s when the hunger took over, his eyes whipped open, \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reveal a new colour. His optics, which were normally light blue, \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned a frightening blood red. The colour almost illuminated the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; room. When Vampirtron spole, it was with a slight modification to \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vocal center, his voice was deeper and almost seemed to echo. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        &quot;Activating Mayfair Recording,&quot; He said, in a very flat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tone. Then his voice picked up emotions that weren&#39;t his \n&gt; own, &quot;Ahh, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; greetings,&quot; He said in a chipper voice, &quot;I see you have found my \n&gt; pet. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, isn&#39;t this a golden opportunity? I think it is. What can I \n&gt; tell \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you about Experiment 666? Well, he has no spark for one, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ironically, one of the most compasionate transformers I&#39;ve ever \n&gt; met. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How does he stay alive? Well, he feeds on other transformers. How \n&gt; &gt; &gt; does he make this process happen? Well, if this recording has \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; activated, I think you&#39;re all going to get a personal \n&gt; demonstration.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vampirtron sat unmoving still, &quot;End of Mayfair Recording.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        Vampirtron sat still for a few more seconds, but then \n&gt; leaped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up towards the nearest person, Nightlight. He opened his mouth \n&gt; wide \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in midair, and huge canine teeth extended, with little drills at \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; end. His claws extended and he reached out to grab her... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    RoboRick007 wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     : :  Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Rodimus Prime: Ok, just tell me what you need when you need \n&gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to see Vampirtron not in pain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       From: airly2000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Sent: Saturday, August 17, 2002 2:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Subject: Re: Artifact 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Nightlight::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Nighlight looked to Rodimus and said &quot;it seems that all \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       right, but perhaps we might need a hand&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       --- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       &gt; Rodimus walks into the med room where Nightlight and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vampirtron are.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       &gt; Rodimus Prime: How are things going?
