And it was\n&gt; obvious with the damage she had.\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked the edge of the forest, heading back to the Predacon cave.\n&gt; Against the quiet of the ambient, she heard a wolf howl. It was a\n&gt; deep-voiced wolf, and possible very large. It was at a distance, but\n&gt; she sensed something different from it. It revealed to her that it\n&gt; was not just an ordanary wolf. It was a wolf-bot, like the she-wolf\n&gt; back at base.\n&gt;\n&gt; This wolf, she could tell was not the Predacon she-wolf, but the\n&gt; missing Rowdy Wolf. She felt the danger from him, and the sorrow.\n&gt;\n&gt; ~No,~ she said to herself and bolted as fast as she could to the\n&gt; Predacon cave. At the entrace of it, she called: ~He&#39;s here! He&#39;s out\n&gt; there!~ She sent that image of Rowdy Wolf from the source of little\n&gt; Quickstrike&#39;s mind, and shaped it differently, as a darker figure,\n&gt; and a more colder face.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
