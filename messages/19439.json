Thus become free from them.&quot;  \nShe looked at the ground as she remembered when she found the way to \nbreak her link and become free.  That was a few months before the \ncouncil even realized she was no longer in thier control.\n&quot;Yeah,  the cuffs and other devices were good, but not fool proof.&quot;\nShe smiled slightly, thinking, this fool beat out a fool proof system.\n&quot;You said you use chips now? Things must have advanced since I left \nhome.&quot;\n\nShe stood up and walked over to the machine,&quot;So what will this thing \ntell us about that necklace?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer&#39;s eyes follow Diamond&#39;s as she looks down at her wrists, \n&gt; the Alliance bot noticing the cuffs. He looks back up as she covers \n&gt; them by folding her arms, his gaze locking on the machine&#39;s screen \nas \n&gt; he thinks over her words. He&#39;d have to watch her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmm,&quot; he says, glancing at her, not acting any different than he \nwas \n&gt; before he noticed the cuffs, or at least not showing outside, &quot;I \n&gt; found it better to make a small chip and plug it into their head. \n&gt; Easier that way, all the neural connections are closer. Mine warped \n&gt; the bot&#39;s mind untill they wanted to do as I say, but most of the \n&gt; bots on this planet are far too advanced for the old design.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
