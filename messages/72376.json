Yes, they were built invisible, or at least heavily resistant to scanne=\r\nrs.  While he could not say how resistant a proper Maximal would register h=\r\ner, as his sensors were woefully minimal, he could at least tell she was bu=\r\nilt that way.  Wondering just why someone would make an army of such robots=\r\n and then let them get away.\n\nThe chillig thing he could think of is that i=\r\nnvesting so much effort in and then letting them escape without pursuing th=\r\nem..  Had whomever made them wanted this or permitted it to happen?\n\nWHEELI=\r\nE sat back as he finally decided he could only go in.
