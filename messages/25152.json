She wondered \nslightly if she could make it back to the swamps before the eye of the storm \ncame, and she doubted it.\nThis particular storm would last a solid day or two before the eye came and \nthey would have sunshine and blue skies, then there would be more of the \nrain as the remainder of the storm passed by.\nBut Carnage had always loved the smell of wet earth, plus it was welcome \nafter a long and hot day sunning.\nCarnage glanced over to Teltoli and chuckled as she hard her, wondering just \nhow she could ever think that her swamp smelled bad. But she&#39;de lived in it \nfor years, so it was a welcome scent by now and had no stench to it.**\n&quot; Yes, I still live there.&quot;\n** She continued on her way, occasionally slowing in order to make sure that \nher bleeding prey didn&#39;t fall from her back and onto the ground. She had \nenough to wash besides dirt.\nBut Carnage nodded to Teltoli.**\n&quot; How could I ever forget? Rude slagging bugger if you ask me! But I think \nthat her name was Cyber...um...........Claw or something to that effect.&quot;\n** Carnage lifted a brow as Teltoli tried to make herself look more adult \nthen she was, and she succeeded...partly. But Carnage knew that she had more \nto learn in order to become a truly accomplished soldier. There were things \nthat she would have to learn...that Carnage could teach her.\nShe wondered slightly if Teltoli would let her do that, teach her. She had \nnever done it before but Carnage knew enough that others didn&#39;t even know \ncould be learned. Things that living a life of...basically carnage...had \nthought her.\nCarnage bumped Teltoli with her tail and looked at her.** &quot; You&#39;re not all \nTHAT grown up yet, girl. You still gotta lot to learn about war and what \nit&#39;s all about.&quot; ** Carnage gave her a slight smile before looking ahead \nagain, then hearing her ramble on about earth and how it was far better then \nCybertron.\nShe had to agree with her there, and if she had the choice she was going to \nstay there too. Not go back with anyone if the Beast Wars ever ended...and \nthat was no time soon.\nBut then Carnage shook her head slightly.** &quot; No, it&#39;s ok. I&#39;ve never liked \nwalking quietly anyway.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
