He looked at them. From \nhis studies he knew that the red one was Inferno, but the \nothers....they were like him, but blue. He whispered a message in a \nsecret frequency.\n\n&quot;Phobia? KitKat? Anyone? It&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the ruins. Inferno \nis here, probably planning an ambush. But he&#39;s brought 5 other \npeople, who look exactly like him except they are blue. Almost \nlike.....clones. My God! If Megatron has mastered cloning technology, \nhe will have a never ending army! Please hurry. The Lavacons and I \nwill engage.&quot;\n\nHe quietly walked over to the Lavacons.\n\n&quot;Soldiers! Your time has come! Those 6 bots over there are servants \nof the Enemey. We must engage them!&quot; Starscream waited for the \nLavacons to arouse.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron helped Wheeljack get it on the platform.\n\n&quot;Come, on. Let&#39;s go. Zardus needs to see this.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois came out of stasis lock for a second, noticing that he was \nmoving. He was still very groggy though.\n\n&quot;Where am I....&quot; But before he could get a clear picture, he went \nback to stasis, his head wires still frazzeled.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq heard what Ramulus said.\n\n&quot;What? You mean we might not even fight? This sucks.&quot; They laughed as \nthey continued walking in cloak. They walked a bit with Ramulus and \nthan turned off track to join Snowcat so that the Trainers couldn&#39;t \nsmell anything.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon laughed.\n\n&quot;Excellent Slayer. First clear shot you get, take him out. If you do \nthis succesfully, you will get a large reward.&quot; He turned to Spears, \npulling out his blaster.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to have this to your head during the process. The safety \nis on, so it won&#39;t fire. Just keep your coll and scream your head \noff.&quot; Prebon laughed at how dumb that sounded. He opened a comm to \nHammer.\n\n&quot;Are you all in place?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes sir. If we here gun fire than we&#39;ll be there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent. Their&#39;s me, and you Spears, and Slayer, and the other \nfour Trainers, and Savage. That&#39;s 8. Their is no way they could&#39;ve \ngotten a force larger than 8 in the short time they had.&quot; He grabbed \nSpears&#39; arm and put the gun to her head, waiting for the time.\n\n&quot;Everything will be all right,&quot; He whispered to her, kissing her \ncheek.\n\n\n"}}
