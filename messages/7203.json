He \nprefered to be fighting, hunting, pushing himself, and his opponent \nto thier fullest like he did with Shadow Wing. He also knew that he \nhad a problem submitting to rage. It nearly cost him a friend, and \nlater on his eyesight. His anger nealy got him into a fight with \nRipper back at the Ark. It fealt like a battle was taking place \ninside of him between the wolf and the bot, he didn&#39;t know which was \nwinning, but he knew it had to stop. There were two possible endings, \nconfront it or be deleated by it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed into bot mode and wrapped her arms around \nLunarpine&#39;s \n&gt; neck. She felt his soft fur against her arms and face and she \ngently \n&gt; hugged him. She smiled and said in a soft voice,&quot; Your welcome. \n&gt; Anything for a good friend like you.&quot;  She was just happy to be \nwith \n&gt; him, no matter what, she wanted to be with him. And she wasn&#39;t \nafraid \n&gt; to admit that to herself any more.\n&gt; &quot;I understand and what you said made sence.  I should be more \ncareful \n&gt; in battle and not try to kill an entire army by myself. Besides, I \n&gt; got most of the moves from you anyway. Your a good teacher you \nknow. \n&gt; Despite what you think, you&#39;ve taught me a lot.  About myself and \n&gt; about you. Thank you for that.&quot;\n&gt; She gave a gently squeeze around his thick wolf neck. She was just \n&gt; happy he was alive and thankful to the matrix that he wasn&#39;t mad at \n&gt; her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If you want, I can get another kill for you.  I figured since you \n&gt; saved my tail feathers a few times, I owed you dinner at least.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Sorry I didn&#39;t get back sooner)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Responding to all posts)\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine looked up at Shadow Wing, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ve already \n&gt; eaten,&quot; he says\n&gt; &gt; glancing behind a nearby rock where the remains of an antelope \nlay, \n&gt; it&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; been a while since the kill, insects were already takeing care of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; leftovers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m glad you found me.&quot; he rolled over exposing his vulnerable \n&gt; side.&quot;Take\n&gt; &gt; your best shot, I deserve it for how I treated you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He paused waiting for her response.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that you couldn&#39;t fight at my side, I just meant \n&gt; that there\n&gt; &gt; were other bots needing your help more.&quot; He was trying to choose \n&gt; his words\n&gt; &gt; wisely to avoid sticking another paw in his mouth. &quot;I&#39;m a wolf, \nmy \n&gt; sense of\n&gt; &gt; smells better than most bots sight.
