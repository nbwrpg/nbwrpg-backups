She wanted to just fly off \nand enjoy the sky and wind under her wings.  But she was curious as \ntot he big red flyer she saw leaving the volcano though.  Then she \nthought about how someone knew she was there.  Her eyes widened.  She \nsuddenly realized that she was flying over a base.  It was well \nhidden but it was there.  That&#39;s why the flyer left the base of the \nvolcano and that&#39;s why someone talked to her thought the telecomm.  \nThere was a base down there that she couldn&#39;t see.  She used her \nsonar and found the hollow of the volcano and the base inside. She \nkept going on the same flight path hoping that they woudn;t thin her \na threat.  If the base opened fire on her, she would have a slim to \nnone chance of making out alive.\n\n\n\n"}}
