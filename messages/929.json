She hated to fall back and under cover from a Maximal attack, \nbut it was her own fault for underestimating her opponent and she was the \nresult.\nBrightBlade felt weak and began to shiver a little, she was not only loosing \nmech-fluid fast but she was loosing her temperature fast as well.\nShe was tired, covered in mech-fluid and dirt...and obviously stasis lock \nwasn&#39;t to far away if she sustained any other forms of major damage. But for \nnow she just rested with her partner by her side and waited, biding their \ntime until both of them could get back at the Maximals and let the slag hit \nthe fan!\nBrightBlade couldn&#39;t help but rest her head on Gangon&#39;s own        \nchest-plate, she was so tired, cold and he was so warm. She closed her \noptics and if it wasn&#39;t for the explosions and charges going off around her \nshe even might have fallen asleep right there, but now she just rested and \nsilently waited until she could get back at the Maximal Tavatron who had \ndone this to Gangon and herself, it would be a pleasant revenge!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
