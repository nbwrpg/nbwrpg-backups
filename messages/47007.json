(quite weak shots at that) So, there are really only 25 \nfireblasts heading at Skyburst, not 50.\n\nIn Beast Wars, it took from 1-4 missiles to KO a bot. The damamge is \nsignificantly less here, but anyone who takes two missiles (for \nexample) is going to be hurtin. That brings me to accepting damage. \n\nAlso, transforming and firing is ok, BUT firing, transforming, and \nfiring again is pushing the limits. Remember that your posts are \ninstantaneous, or close to it, so they happen really quickly.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; D-13 easily avoids the shots.D-13 transforms and fires his laser \n25 times at \n&gt; Skyburst transforms back into dragon mode and shoots 50 fire \nblasts at \n&gt; skyburst for good measure then starts flying to where he is.\n\n\n"}}
