He giv=\r\nes Airhammer a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; We owe ya big time, thanks for the lift.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap gets into his seat and quickly gets into the observation systems.\n\n&quot; =\r\nSo what the pit&#39;s mak&#39;n all that noise out there?  Look&#39;n for thermal reads=\r\n now.  And Night Shift we got plenty of cats work&#39;n for us now, can&#39;t ya se=\r\nttle for someth&#39;n else like someth&#39;n in the Canine family?&quot;\n\nNight Shift ey=\r\nes Rat Trap.\n\n&quot; No offense but if I&#39;m gonna trade up for a more suitable al=\r\nt form, it&#39;s gotta be what I want and what I feel suits me the best.  That =\r\ncat reminds me of myself and who I am.  If that&#39;s what I want, I shouldn&#39;t =\r\nbe questioned about my personal choice.&quot;\n\nRat Trap glares back. \n\n&quot; But, bu=\r\nt that&#39;s the form that Ravage took.  Do ya really wanna be like him?&quot;\n\nNigh=\r\nt Shift knew the question would come up.  He glares back.\n\n&quot; So that&#39;s it. =\r\n Just because that cat is associated with a Decepticon spy, the species as =\r\na whole is tainted.  I get the fuss now.  Any of you guys ever thought that=\r\n sometimes think&#39;n outside the box isn&#39;t all that bad sometimes?  C&#39;mon, gi=\r\nmme some slack!  If I want this feline as my alt form it&#39;s my choice.  And =\r\nif Tucson was here he&#39;d respect that so please, respect my choices, it&#39;s al=\r\nl I ask.&quot;\n\nRat Trap bows his head, crestfallen.\n\n&quot;Ohh, I suppose you&#39;re rig=\r\nht about that.  Wheels wouldn&#39;t be so happy with any of us if we didn&#39;t lea=\r\nrn ta accept another bots choice, especially one that impacts them long ter=\r\nm.&quot;\n\nNight Shift pats Rat Trap on the shoulder.\n\n&quot; Thanks, I know it sounds=\r\n strange but that&#39;s the form that fits me best.&quot; \n\nHe turns to Ramulus.\n\n&quot; =\r\nLook I know you&#39;re not a fan of the form but, it&#39;s my life, my form and my =\r\nchoice.  Now I got the visual scan of that big cat.  Where do we go from he=\r\nre?&quot;\n\nHis expression remains stern.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly=\r\n busy. \n"}}
