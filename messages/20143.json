She woke up and jerked around \nas her new form became fully awake. She hit the chamber door with her \nhuge paw. The sound echoed in the chamber and was almost deffening. \nShe thought about how to get out.  She didn&#39;t have hands anymore, \nthey were huge paws with gigantic claws. She thought about how to get \nout.  She heard Veratis thoughts, Till all are one. She thought out \nto him,&quot;Can I get out of here, it&#39;s cramped.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine reached the transport pod and transformed to his half \nwolf \n&gt; state, he tried to operate the controls but unfortunately his large \n&gt; claws were to awkward to set the coordinates. He knew he was out of \n&gt; options, if he turned to robot mode he&#39;d collapse into stasis lock \ndo \n&gt; to the shot he&#39;d taken in the gut. There were no options open to \nhim \n&gt; except take a chance on auto pilot. &quot;Computer return me to Veratis&#39; \n&gt; position.&quot; The computer came to life and carried him skyward. the \n&gt; only drawback to using the computer was that the coordinates would \n&gt; automatically be relayed through the maximal network including the \n&gt; one on the CF. Lunarpines wounds were still healing, to bad they \n&gt; weren&#39;t healing faster. He really wanted to find the trainers base \n&gt; and put an end to them. He opened his comm to Ramulus &quot;If theres a \n&gt; tracker available you might want to send it into the mountains to \n&gt; track Slayer.&quot; he caught his breath. &quot;Slayer left a trail of mech \n&gt; fluid long enough for a blindbot to follow, I&#39;m going offline for a \n&gt; bit, My destination&#39;s in the computer, I&#39;ll be back when I can.&quot; He \n&gt; signed off and sat in the control seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Veratis watched the screen to see what the virus was \ndoing \n&gt; to Shadow Wings body. he&#39;d taken away most of the signs that she \nwas \n&gt; a translifeform. It was as if he&#39;d created a new breed of \ntranslife. \n&gt; the way the matrix had intended. He smiled a sly grin and held back \na \n&gt; sinister laugh. The words came to him again, &quot;Till all are one&quot; He \n&gt; stepped back, suddenly seeing what exactly the words meant, \nTranslife \n&gt; and nature would become one and this freak before him was the \n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers curled up in the corner of his forcefield away from any \n&gt; security cameras. To anyone watching he would appear to have given \nup \n&gt; and curled up in fear. Not this bot though. He&#39;d been through \ntougher \n&gt; situations, escaping this one would be a piece of datacake. He \nslowly \n&gt; removed his cutting torch from his side and began to use it on the \n&gt; floor. He&#39;d soon be free to roam, but with the information he&#39;d \njust \n&gt; uncovered he&#39;d have to escape and report his findings to Veratis \nand \n&gt; the Maximals if they&#39;d listen to him after the stunt he&#39;d pulled \nback \n&gt; on the CF. &quot;Theres not a forcefield that can hold me.&quot; he thought \nas \n&gt; his torch cut through the floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nearby a spider watched curiosly as the foxbot attempted his \nescape. \n&gt; The foxbots key to survival was escape, the spider anylized the \n&gt; possability and knew that it wasn&#39;t right for it&#39;s kind. Long as \nthe \n&gt; predacons didn&#39;t know that some spiders were still active they \ncould \n&gt; still survive.\n\n\n"}}
