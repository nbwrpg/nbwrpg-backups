She looked at her \nlegs. She didn&#39;t want a drone to look after her. She didn&#39;t want \nanyone to look after.  She wanted to go and fight with the others.  \nShe was feeling depressed by all this.  Her body wasn&#39;t working \nright. She was shaking and she couldn&#39;t transform.  She was stuck in \nthis useless bot mode.  She hated being useless. She hated not being \nable to fight. She would rather be dead than have bots have to wait \non her.  She tried to stand up and lean against the table.  But her \nlegs just wouldn&#39;t hold her up.  She fell to the floor again.  She \nhit her fists against the floor as hard as she could.  She sat up and \nhit the table. She cut her hand on the table frame.  She saw her hand \nleaking. But it wasn&#39;t mech fluid.  It glowed and looked a different \ncolor. She stared at it with wonder and a little fear. This was the \nstuff that Black Aracnia ahd pumped through her to bring her back. \nShe watched as the cut healed up almost right away. She screamed out. \nThat scared her more than death did.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Black Aracnia smiled at Darkmouse, she was a tough little \ncookie to go \n&gt; through all of this. &quot;Very good. Take your time. Also, if you \nlike,  can have \n&gt; you placed in your quarters with a medical droid to watch over you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Paralysis looked at the virtual map and saw that several \nAllience members \n&gt; were assulting the skeleton of the once proud, but now shattered \nArk. He \n&gt; slammed his fist down and cursed.\n&gt;     Aerostreak, Gunatix, and Grappler sat on the bridge, learning a \nfew \n&gt; things from Paralysis. They were as shocked as he was.\n&gt;     &quot;Black Aracnia! The Allience is attacking the Ark!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia stormed out of Darkmouses room without saying goodbye. \nRight now \n&gt; she had extreamly important matters to deal with. She ran down the \ncorridor \n&gt; and into the bridge. She saw firsthand what was going on.\n&gt;     &quot;Well well, about time the Allience finally grows a backbone \nand dose \n&gt; something! Send a transmission to Darkone telling him that you, \nAerostreak, \n&gt; Grappler, Adrax, and Autofire will be joining them. I will maintain \nthings \n&gt; here and join you. Quickstrike will man the computers. Also, Atma, \nDecadel, \n&gt; and Hibichi..er..whatever, will join you as well. Hurry!&quot; She \nordered, \n&gt; looking to her crew.\n\n\n"}}
