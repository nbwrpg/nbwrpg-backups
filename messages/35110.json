As Iron Raptor, though still Arkness Prime.\nAll but one of her modes was damaged, but it was well worth it.\nThough she looked back at Prowl and smiled, putting an arm around his \nshoulders and walking along with him towards the city. &lt; I love you too...&gt;.\nBut still she felt an ache in her spark, where the CF use to be. She had \ngrown to like that ship, though it kept getting beaten up.  She had thought \nof it as a home, like she had the Ark.\nNow both were gone.\nIt was hard, trying to settle in only to have your home taken away, or made \ninto something else.\nBut this city could protect the Maximals better then the CF could,but still \nshe felt uneasy. Almost like she would rather sleep outside instead.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
