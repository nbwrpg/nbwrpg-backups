He knew they had lost \nthe ownership of the Predacons ship, but Hell Beast&#39;s troops were the ones \nloosing. They now had a ship and computer with them that wouldn&#39;t listen to \ntheir commands. It was a dead ship. When ever they&#39;ll get the auto-guns \nbrought back on-line, the ship will turn on them. She still had the \nprograming he gave Her earlier. The fools. And they would never get Her back \nthe way she was without him. They would never guess he was he one that did \nall this. And he would never crack.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
