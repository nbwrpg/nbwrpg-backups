I&#39;ve even worked out a line of \nOptimuses after Primal since we don&#39;t know what happened to him so far \nas I know. Optimus Primitive, Optimus Fur, Optimus Fir (don&#39;t ask me \nhow to verbaly distinguish), and Optimus Fury the apprentise of \nOptimus Fir who someday will lead the Malacons to glory (I hope. By \nthe way is anyone interested in a Malacon Char and could you bring \nback the Anglions remember they&#39;re clueless about the Malacons).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; OOC again: Yeah, but it would have to be optimus Primal since I&#39;m \nnot \n&gt; sure if the original BW/BM Optimus was used.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Why can&#39;t we just say Optimus started a minor religion that was \n&gt; mostly \n&gt; &gt; stamped out? We could say everyone else on his team was against \nit. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; was never in this game was he?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I&#39;m afraid this won&#39;t work because the Cybertron used \nbefore \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heavily populated. The story you tell me about implies that only \na \n&gt; &gt; few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bots were left, but this contradicts what has happened on \n&gt; cybertron. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I guess nothing holds you from using the story on \nanother \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world, with some minor changes. There is a bot owned by Lord of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Darkness (wonder where he is now) named Cheetor, and a \nX-Predacon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; named Black Arachnia.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O.k. and Optimus was quickly arrested after discovering the \n&gt; orocal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone thought that was that, but a few of his followers \n&gt; &gt; survived? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He never fought a second war or rescued any sparks, and barely \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to find out about organic core and its superiority to \n&gt; water?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry Dewboy. I know you want this plot to work, but It \n&gt; &gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t. It&#39;s just like saying Mustex knows about Veratis when \n&gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not actually met in the RPG. The basic story of a rebelling \n&gt; &gt; &gt; faction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sending a member to Earth was good, but you can not say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Techno-organics were on cybertron because it is not the \n&gt; &gt; Cybertron \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has been going on. Beast Machines never happened. This means \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals safely arrived on Cybertron, took Megatron to a \ntrial \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something, and, in some way, he went back to Earth. That&#39;s \nit. \n&gt; &gt; BM \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never happened because if it did, Megatron never could have \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; went \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to Earth, he would have been a part of Cybertron. It&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; hard, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have to deal with it.\n\n\n"}}
