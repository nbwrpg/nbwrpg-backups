Still beside Prowl she then opened her com-link to put out a warning to all the other Maximals but it was nothing but static, turning off her communicator she then spoke to the only system that was available all the time.*\n\n� Iris, locate intruders and destroy them, put base on red alert.�\n\nIRIS: *sigh* � I�m on it, just getting everything on line.�\n\n*With that the base was put on red alert, in every coradore red lights lit up the halls, the internal guns dropped from the roof and began to scan for Predacon energy signatures.\nA few hatches in the roof of the Ark slid open and a pair of motion sensory guns dropped from the roof overhead of the 3 invading Predacons and soon targeted their signatures, a flash of light erupting from them as they began to fire upon them.\nIris&#39;s voice echoing throughout the base and being heard even outside of it.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Alert, Predacons have infultrated base, Alert! Located in gride 6-1-7-5, ALERT!&quot;\n\n*The weapons fired heavily towards Black Arachnia, Inferno and Rampage, no chance that they would cease unless they either eliminated the enemy or were called off. Iris lining up the next course of defences as she then connected the power server to the shield conduet, a grey shiled slowly developing in front and then slowly expanding around the base�blocking Predacon charges. The shield would not last for too long but as the base had been repaired it had been gaining power as well, being able to then activate the shiled and hold it.\nThe remaining online auto guns activated and then swivvled to aim towards and target the firing Predacons, powerful charges firing towards the enemy.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
