These Maximals wern&#39;t tough at\n&gt; all, the Alliance commander thinks, looking down at the Maximals who\n&gt; had done this much damage to the Predacon cave, and were now being\n&gt; shot at by his troops. Zardus was a bit surprised at how soft the\n&gt; Predacons have gotten, letting the Maximals get them like this.\n&gt;\n&gt; He activates his comm-link. &quot;Predacon commander,&quot; he says into it,\n&gt; sending the transmission on a Predacon frequency, &quot;This is Zardus.
