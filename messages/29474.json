The ones she&#39;d known were savage ferocious beasts with\ninsect like skin that made them difficult to kill. &quot;My technology was meant\nfor science, exploration, and colinization purposes, not to create an\nuncontrollable killer.&quot; She could tell that Zardus&#39; attention wasn&#39;t\nentirely on her. she wished she could transform to her half mode so she\ncould use her third eye to see what he was doing.\n\n&gt; &quot;Yes, there&#39;ll be security,&quot; Zardus says to Lady Hawk after ending\n&gt; the transmission to Mortem. &quot;If the bot is uncontrollable it&#39;ll have\n&gt; to be redone. Once you&#39;re successful, you&#39;ll be free to go.&quot;\n\nThis was the best offer she had heard yet. She wanted away from this group.\nso far she&#39;d been wrapped up by one member(Najah) and shot at by another\n(Gotron). If these bots were supposed to be on her side then she hated to\nthink what they&#39;d do to thier enemies. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can find a comprimise.&quot;\nShe says willing to do almost anything to get out of there.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk looked at the details from the project. In her travells\n&gt; she&#39;d seen\n&gt; &gt; parasites like this. there were few good qualities to balance but\n&gt; she didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have much of a choice. &quot;I can do this alone if you wish but why\n&gt; would you\n&gt; &gt; want such horrible creatures? She remembered the planets where such\n&gt; &gt; creatures existed were virtually lifeless. (Wheres Sigourny Weaver\n&gt; when we\n&gt; &gt; need her?) The only thing that she could do was combine the\n&gt; alliance DNA and\n&gt; &gt; hope for a more controllable creature. &quot;You will of course provide\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; security to watch the results.&quot; Lady Hawk was hesitant about the\n&gt; experiment\n&gt; &gt; but she knew that this was exactly the reason Veratis had taught\n&gt; her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
