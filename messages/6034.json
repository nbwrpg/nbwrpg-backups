That was Zardus.  I&#39;m not \ntrying to keep IR there at all costs.  I&#39;m doing it out of my character&#39;s \nbetter judgement.  \n\nRamhorn believes that IR is probably already dead, or demands or something \nlike that would&#39;ve happened.  Or she may have been tortured and info lost.  \nTaking a chunk of Maximal forces from the Ark and other ship is a stupid \ntactic to him.\n\nKluster, well, Kluster thinks most of the Maximals on Past Earth are a bunch \nof incompitent fools and to him, they&#39;re proving his theory.\n\nAs for Nemesis Enforcer, he knows that he&#39;s a little crazy, he&#39;s not a \ndiplomat, and that if he blows the diplo mission with Panzertron, he&#39;ll \nprobably be in trouble with Zardus.\n\nIt&#39;s not up to me or ANY of my characters to let IR go.  I&#39;m sorry that she \nis being detained, it&#39;s obviously gonna make things boring.  But, I can&#39;t do \nanything about it)\n\n"}}
