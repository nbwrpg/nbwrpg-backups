Shaking her head, her warrior instincts kick in. \nShe crouches, and looks for enemies, attempting to ensure that her \nposition was safe.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hotgy69420&quot; &lt;Hottie4u2have1@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lynxiz this is Panthro come to our base. thank you.Ohh yeah i have \n&gt; the base location on a message aswell\n\n\n"}}
