It took a lot of effort \nand energy, but she finally got the form to sit up again.  She tried \nto connect to the optics of the bot, to try to see.  The optics on \nthe form flickered as she tried, but then they went dark.  She \ncouldn&#39;t find the right connection.  She didn&#39;t want to give up \nthough.  She had the bot sitting upright on the table.  She tried to \nmove the legs, but it was proving to difficult to do too much at \nonce.  She didn&#39;t feel like she was apart of this form.  More like \njust at the controls, but not inside it like her old form.   She \nstopped and just fucused on the bot sitting up.  It stayed in the \npossision.  She typed up on the screen for Veratis to read,&quot;Hey, I \nthink I&#39;m getting the hang of it now.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
