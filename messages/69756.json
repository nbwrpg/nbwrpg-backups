He wasn&#39;t mu=\r\nch for burning rubber needlessly, and always took caution instead of wreckl=\r\nesness when it came to his driving habits. Right down to signalling a right=\r\n turn when it came time to turn right, and keeping his speed at a reasonabl=\r\ne clip. When he feels the ground beneath his tires become rough, he shifts =\r\ninto manual gear to activate his all wheel drive system, and is careful to =\r\ntake it easy through rocky river beds. Water splashes up over his cab, as d=\r\noes mud. But it doesn&#39;t bother him in the least.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; I wish I could =\r\nsay enjoy the ride, maybe one of these days I can.

I wish I could get there sooner but if I go too fast, I&#39;l=\r\nl kick up dust, and that&#39;s a dead giveaway. This way, if I stick to moist g=\r\nround for most of the journey, and if I can help it, through grassy plains,=\r\n I may be able to avoid being seen. So far I think sticking to water ways i=\r\ns best. No dust, no prints, no scent, no can track.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He continues =\r\nto buffer his and Lord Elder&#39;s signatures so is to appear that they are not=\r\n even enroute to the Ark.
