By Fell to earth you\n&gt; &gt; mean in a s=\r\ntasis pod?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, is Lio Convoy taken? I think he&#39;d make a cool Pas=\r\nficus Maximal,\n&gt; &gt; and Big Convoy, for the silver wings....how many charact=\r\ners can I \n&gt; have?\n&gt; &gt; Also I wonder, are you accepting characters from Ani=\r\nmated that have no\n&gt; &gt; same named char here?
