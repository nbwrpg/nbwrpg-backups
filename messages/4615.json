He felt a heavyness on his tail, weighing it down. He\n&gt; bobbed it and looked over. The first thing that he saw Stingtra. Thank\n&gt; Primus she followed orders. The other thing that he saw was a blanket over\n&gt; his legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; He stood up, and went to take it off, but his claws wouldn&#39;t reach. He\ntried\n&gt; left, then right. He tried to throw it off with his tail, hoping that it\n&gt; would slide off, but it didn&#39;t. What did she do, staple it on?\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Get this thing off,&quot; he quietly said.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; GIVE YOUR WIFE A BREAK!
