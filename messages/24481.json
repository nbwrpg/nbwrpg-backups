To a young Predacon&#39;s mind, it was nothing. She came \nfrom a line of warriors, and the scenes did nothing but show her war, \nsomething she was shown to at the first few moments of her time on-\nline. \n\nShe turned her head to Omnious. &quot;Do you want something?&quot; she said, \nlooking non-impressed. Then she realized this was not an usual place. \nShe never seen this bot before. &quot;Hold up, who are you anyways?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
