I&#39;m happy to see that all of you are showing the initiative to \nhave faith in the unknown.  This will only strengthen our bonds and our \nforces.\nHe then turns his head toward the direction of Rodimus.\n\n&quot;I notice you&#39;re a tad quiet Rodimus, I understand if something is bothering \nyou and I&#39;m here to listen if you need to get a few things off your mind.  I \nrealize that you have been through a lot, and most of it unpleasent.  I \nassure you Hydras will not get away with what he did to you and neither will \nthe rest of his lackies.&quot;\n\nA stone solid look of determination comes over Tucson&#39;s face.  Like Optimus \nhe was not one to shy away from working toward a resolve.\n\n&quot; And if I must, if given the challenge, I will face him if he so choses, on \na one to one basis.  He took something very valuable away from me, my \ncomrades, and my friends.  And now, it&#39;s time I took something away from \nhim.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We should do it with Nightlight First, after we restore her to her\n&gt; &gt; primitive self&quot;said Perceptor&quot;She is who are in the most imediate \n&gt; &gt; risk...\n&gt; &gt; ok&quot;he said while he faced Staton and the others &quot;I need your help...
