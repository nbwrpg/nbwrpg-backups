He shakes his head, cursing the pit for the \npresence of insane bots.\n\nSitting down in his normal chair, Chordate looks at the security cameras, his \neyes widening when he sees Koj flying through the halls. Swearing under his \nbreath as he taps a few buttons, Chordate activates a lockdown of the \ncorridor, doors closing and locking in the area where Koj was. Autoguns stand \nready as Chordate activates the intercom, setting it to only sound in Koj&#39;s \narea.\n\n&quot;Stop where you are,&quot; he says, &quot;Why are you smashing through doors?&quot;\n\n"}}
