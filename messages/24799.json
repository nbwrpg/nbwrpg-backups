Two large claws extend from\none large piece of silver metalic body with orange legs sorounding it, and\na tail with a stigner curled around the body. The hum from the computer\neminates from this body.\n\nComputer: &quot;Unit free of rocks, commencing reactivation...&quot; with that the\ncomputer hum dies down, replaced with a groan from the body.

Looking at the giant female he stammers again, &quot;youre not\nBlackaraknia&quot; his claws start to click faster showing his worry and he\nstarts to speak to no one in particular &quot;where the slag am I, what&#39;s going\non&quot; then realizes he&#39;s surrounded again silences and the look of worry\nreplaces his face again.\n\n\n\n"}}
