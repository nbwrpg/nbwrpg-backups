The nine foot tall Vehement stepped out of the CR \nchamber, heading \n&gt; for the bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement arrived on the bridge, looking to his two soldiers.\n&gt; &quot;What have you found so far?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, Archbishop, there are several bases.  There is an area where \ntwo bases \n&gt; are together.  I believe that&#39;s where the strongest faction \nresides.  It&#39;s on \n&gt; an island also, and I&#39;m detecting over twenty-five different energy \n&gt; sigantures.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hmmm...that&#39;s many for Earth.  I&#39;m surprised.&quot; Vehement \nreplied.  &quot;Go on.  \n&gt; Is anyone near us?  Where are we?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are in what will be known as Ulaanbaator, Mongolia in the Gobi \nDesert in \n&gt; the continent of Asia.  There is no one that close to us.  We are \nsurrounded \n&gt; by complete desert.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement looked to Reflector and Sun Crusher.  &quot;Open up a comm. \ntransmission \n&gt; to ALL frequencies.  I will speak.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, Archbishop.&quot; Reflector replied, going to his terminal and \npressing in a \n&gt; few commands.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Attention, all residents of Past Earth.  I am Vehement.  My \nbattlecruiser \n&gt; has crashed on this planet as I&#39;m sure you know by now.  My base is \nbadly \n&gt; damaged and is in need of serious repair.  Any assistance would be \nthankful.&quot; \n&gt; he signaled Reflector to end the transmission.  &quot;Play that \ncontinously for \n&gt; five mega-cycles.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Sun Crusher said, walking over to Reflector&#39;s terminal \nand \n&gt; pressing a few commands.  &quot;Done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good.  What is the status of the base?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Surprisingly,&quot; Sun Crusher said with a smile, &quot;all weapons are \nintact, all \n&gt; CR pools and chambers are fully functional, and our shields and \nother primary \n&gt; systems are intact.  Energy reserves are down to 74% though, and \nthere are \n&gt; several breaches in the hull.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How long would it take to repair the hull?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A mega-cycle.  They aren&#39;t bad.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do we have any solar panels?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good.  Set those up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;ll take two mega-cycles.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll keep defenses active while you do that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Sun Crusher acknowledge, him and Reflector walking \nout of the \n&gt; bridge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement sat in his command chair, smiling as the transmission \ncontinuously \n&gt; played to all bases and everyone on Earth.\n\n\n"}}
