Running her optics to an ultravi=\r\nolet mode if it was availabile, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; seeing fi she could begin to r=\r\nun energy blockage traces, to hopefully track&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; where teh jamming wa=\r\ns heavier.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And as the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS seemed to be=\r\n readying to travel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; underground, she went over to try and scan the=\r\n area to see where further&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; signatures might be coming from.  Still=\r\n not breaking her cloak, intent on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; staying aboveground.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\nlt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimply put, the closer they got to the cave, the heavie=\r\nr the jamming&lt;br&gt;\ngot. It was as if it was a foci of some sort, perhaps one=\r\n of the&lt;br&gt;\nplaces, if not THE place from which the disruptive energies wer=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\ncoming from.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT sat =\r\nto the back as the MAXIMALS went to go down teh tunnel.  IF&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there =\r\nwas an ambush ahead, then they would take the brunt of it, and any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n hidden defenses would target and attrite them first.  While also giving th=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PREDACONS effective control of the tunnel up to the surface in c=\r\nase a quick&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; escape was needed or other uses could be maintained fo=\r\nr it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Speaking over to TORCA, &quot;I would assume a question =\r\nof geology.  Their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; facility, if it is such, is probably undergroun=\r\nd quite simply as that is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; where the most stable ground is.  Aboveg=\r\nround things are too muddy for a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; solid base iwthout using heavy te=\r\nchnology to establish it.  Which wold be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more noticable to outside=\r\n analysis.  So they have a stable base in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; caverns.  It also ma=\r\ny have to do something with their jamming technology as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; well.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Not saying the obvious &#39;it was a trap&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTORCA grunted as if he suspected that something more was at play =\r\nhere&lt;br&gt;\nas well, however he continued to followed LEO PRIME into the cave&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nopening.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe cave itself was quite large, at least once you pa=\r\nssed through the&lt;br&gt;\nmouth of it. It quickly began to descend its curving p=\r\nath leading&lt;br&gt;\nfurther and further into the darkness that was below. The w=\r\nalls were&lt;br&gt;\nlike any other cave, rough and natural, thee was no ambient l=\r\night in&lt;br&gt;\nhere, except for whatever light spilled in from the mouth of th=\r\ne cave&lt;br&gt;\nor what the PREDACONS and MAXIMALS cared to utilize.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSe=\r\nnsors were getting more and more muffled as they passed into it.&lt;br&gt;\nPassiv=\r\ne ones still abosorbed, but active ones were basically of little&lt;br&gt;\nto no =\r\nuse beyond a few feet espeacially ones that used radio or energy&lt;br&gt;\nwaves =\r\nthat went outside the normal visual or auditory ranges.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAhead of t=\r\nhem they could hear something roar in the distance,&lt;br&gt;\nsomething loud and =\r\nreptillian - it was TUSCON! From the sound of it,&lt;br&gt;\nhe was perhaps severa=\r\nl hundred meters ahead of them deeper into the&lt;br&gt;\ncave.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever b=\r\nehind them, as the last of the PREDACONS were making their&lt;br&gt;\nway in, a me=\r\ntallic &#39;door&#39; slid across the mouth of the cave blocking&lt;br&gt;\nout any extern=\r\nal light as well as any chance of egress.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe trap, at least this =\r\nsection of it, had been sprung!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC: Adam the &#39;door&#39; will wait for=\r\n all the preds and maxi&#39;s, but it is&lt;br&gt;\nup to you if Blackarachnia was ins=\r\nide or outside when the door closed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-2DEBEDEF-7A89-4143-922F-08686370D109--\r\n\n"}}
