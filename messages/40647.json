I&#39;m an Abyssian Badass, so don&#39;t **** with me!  Oh, and everybody, I&#39;ve finally came to the conclusion that I really am a good RPer.  Still not good enough for council =)=(  but who cares?  See, if it weren&#39;t for me realising how much NBWRPG means to me and how big a part of my life it has been, is, and will be, I&#39;d still be calling myself nothing.  But anyway, get used to the new: Abyssian Badass!  Yeah!  \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:   Necromancer smiled as he realised how much he loved being a Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Sister, why don&#39;t we get in touch with our old Maximal friends again, like Firearm and Prowl?&quot; Necromancer suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;I wouldn&#39;t call them friends, but at least it&#39;s something to do,&quot; Hell Drak said.\n&gt; \n&gt;         For once, Necromancer didn&#39;t sigh at Hell Drak&#39;s snobby behavior.  He just shrugged.  Necromancer and Hell Drak went off to Prowl and Orion&#39;s position.  They got there in a few minutes(sorry if they are like a billion miles away, if they were, then scratch this rest).  \n&gt; \n&gt;          &quot;Prowl!  Orion!  Good to see you guys again!&quot; Necromancer greeted heartily. \n&gt; \n&gt;          Hell Drak was silent.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Abyssian By Birth~\n&gt; ~Badass By Choice~\n\n\n"}}
