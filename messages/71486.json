In the front ranks are\nwahat seemed to be literally hundreds of armored horns! Triceratops\nand stegasaurai where leading the pack, followed by larger\ntyranosaurases and other assorted and large reptiles. Hovering over\nthe group were flying reptiles, some as small as birds and some with\nwings spans as large as 30 feet.\n\nHowever station in the middle of all of that was singular creature, a\ndinobot, around whom all the other creatures seemed to be moving. He\nwas floating about 30 feet above the center of the giant mass, his\noptics dark and his arms folded over his chest.\n\nThe herd was still moving towards HYDRAS&#39; base.\n\n&quot;Sire?&quot; Inferno said as he stood next to HYDRAS, his ever faithful\nguardian, &quot;What are your orders?&quot;\n\nThis was a sentiment that seemed echoed by many of the others. The\nfuzors milled about, glancing between HYDRAS and SKYSHADOW, the fuzor\ncommander, a sense of dread apparent on their faces, the numbers here\nwere truely staggering.\n\nCYCLONUS stood on the other side of HYDRAS, with DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA\nand NIGHTRAZOR standing with him.\n\nThe rest of HYDRAS&#39; men were kind spread about, glancing back at their\nleader and then at the coming GIANT WAVE of dinosaur flesh.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
