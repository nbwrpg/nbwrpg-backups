She gazed silently \nforward, her head slightly raised. She thought she heard something�\n\nIt was nothing. Nothing at all. Who was she kidding? The entire run to this \nsecluded spot she thought she had heard a �bot following her. As the wind \nshifted and changed direction it brought a familiar scent to fem �bot. A \nscent that vanished with the dying wind. There was no one behind her. She \nhad rown used to Dinobot�s constant companionship. Tavatron absentmindedly \nbegan flicking small pebbles and dirt clods over the cliff�s edge. She began \ntiming their descent, until they were no longer visible.\n\n*flick* �3 �2 �1\n\n*flick* �5 �4 �3 �\n\nTavatron whipped her head around. There was definitely someone there� A \nsmall smile was all that betrayed her solemn appearance. The brush behind \nher continued to rustle softly and the heavy breathing of a seemingly \ninjured �bot echoed in her ears. Her augmented hearing had picked up \nsomething a while ago. Well, maybe he did care enough to follow her. That \ndidn�t mean she had to acknowledge his presence� yet. Again, a small smile \nwas etched on her dark muzzle. Her head was facing the forest again, the one \nthat lay below the cliff. It reminded her of peaceful times. Of times when \nher biggest concern was avoiding the cops. Now, however, things had changed. \nShe wasn�t running from cops anymore, she was surviving a war.\n\nShe never had much of a childhood. She had always been on the move. Ever \nsince her parents� s-since�\n\nA heavy sigh was all that penetrated the growing silence. She had never \nreally known them, so why did she miss them so slaggin� much?! Not too long \nago �bots would call her callous, cold-hearted, perhaps even a little� dark. \nIf only they had known. But that would mean talking about things she had \nlong since repressed. She rarely let herself get close to other �bots. It \njust made the pain of losing them greater.\n\nShe had gone to great lengths to avoid much contact with other �bots. But \nshe had made a mistake. She�d let her guard down, and look what happened.\n\n*Look what happened indeed�*\n\nThe wind picked up again, carrying with it the familiar scent she had \nnoticed earlier.\n\n*you made a friend.*\n\nTavatron slowly got to her feet. Her muscles had stiffened from the long \nrun. She cautiously stretched her right hindleg, then her left.  Next she \ndid a full body stretch, all the while listening as Dinobot emerged from the \nforest. His breathing was labored. Actually, she was surprised he was \ncapable of keeping pace with her in his current state. Tavatron finished her \nstretching just as he spoke.\n\nHis voice sounded pained, maybe a little annoyed. Tavatron breathed a sigh \nof relief. She was beginning to worry she had done something she would \nregret for the rest of her life. Slag, he could attack her honor for the \nrest of eternity, she�d still be his friend. Who was she kidding? Of course \nit had hurt her deeply when he said things like that, but only because she \ncared about what he thought. When he said she was no warrior she had begun \nto doubt herself. Something she had rarely done.\n\nTavatron stretched her front paw one more time before transforming and \nturning to face a weary Dinobot. Judging from the way he held his side his \ninjuries were still plaguing  him. He had come after, she thought he \nwouldn�t have bothered. Perhaps she had misjudged him:\n\n&quot;Well, I�m glad to see you�re up and about.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
