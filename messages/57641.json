He was expendable after all. If he \ncould bring justice along the way, the better.\n\nHe raised his dual cannon and pressed it against the ship&#39;s somputer \nmainframe. His finger swiftly tightened the trigger and stayed there \nfor a long moment. The cryo-clip steadily emptied itself, until it \nwas down to 3%.\n\nMeanwhile, he was exposed to most of the shots, some of which hit \ncritical elements of his structure.\n\nAzureBlade: You&#39;ve only started to pay, renegade.
