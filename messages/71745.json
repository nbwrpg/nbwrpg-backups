Hello, who&#39;s the spiny one in your\n&gt; cab?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot waddles out of Nightshift and sits up to look to Rattrap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s me, Straight Shot.  I sort of had a little form change.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap grins.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not baaaad, I like it.  Ooooh do those quills launch out or just fall\n&gt; out?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot ponders the question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Good question.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs they talked WING CALIBER walked out of the entrance of the Ark as\nwell and just took a moment to just watch them. He crossed his arms\nover his chest a small smile on his face. They reminded him of all the\nsoldiers he had trained over the centuries as they came together.\n\n&quot;Straight Shot.&quot; WING CALIBER said as he watched them get closer, he\nwas always the soldier and teacher. &quot;You need to practice first and\nlet some of the med techs go over you to make sure you know what you\ncan do.&quot;\n\nHe looked up as he could see the shuttle in the distance returning to\nthe Ark as well. He wondered how SILVERBOLT would fare. he heard the\nreports and he was worried.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
