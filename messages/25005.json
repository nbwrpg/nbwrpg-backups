She plummeted to the ground crashing harder than a\n&gt; Delta jet.\n&gt; &gt; Her body was torn with cuts and dents from the beating she&#39;d taken.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blaze voice came through a static filled channel. &quot;Prebon, what did\n&gt; you lead\n&gt; &gt; us into?&quot; It was rare to hear such tone from his troops, The female\n&gt; had used\n&gt; &gt; his name without a title before it. The chain of command was\n&gt; falling around\n&gt; &gt; him,(Or is that fallout?) The Trainers commander was no longer in\n&gt; control of\n&gt; &gt; his troops fate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The new shoreline was smoking with residual energy when a hand\n&gt; washed up on\n&gt; &gt; it, It was Hammers, the proud warrior had fallen to a superior\n&gt; force. His\n&gt; &gt; spark may have survived but if it had it was buried somewhere in the\n&gt; &gt; aftermath of the devastation. (Hammer is dead)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bullet&#39;s battle scarred frame lay a few miles inward from where the\n&gt; blast\n&gt; &gt; had hit, He lay in Stasis lock with holes through him that made him\n&gt; resemble\n&gt; &gt; swiss cheese. One leg was broken, the other was in pieces scattered\n&gt; from the\n&gt; &gt; focal point to the landing point. his arms were slung about like a\n&gt; puppet\n&gt; &gt; after the strings were cut. His face resembled the aftermath of a\n&gt; Mike Tyson\n&gt; &gt; fight, his left eye was melted shut, right eye hanging by a wire.\n&gt; Nose was\n&gt; &gt; dented inward from the force of the blast. his jaw had been broken\n&gt; open and\n&gt; &gt; half fallen off. One ear was still intact while the other looked as\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; someone had taken a bite out of it.(Completing the Tyson reference.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Havoc fires two more missiles at Bullet.

A panel slides aside on the top of it,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a mean looking large cannon slides out. It aims at the shore of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spain, three miles away, where most of the attackers were.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A wide glowing beam emerges from the cannon, making its way with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great speed toward the beach. It hits land in three seconds, with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more energy than it had used last time during its demonstration of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destroying a whole mountain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The shockwave from the blast reaches even the Alliance base,\n&gt; although\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cannon was designed not to leave a big shockwave. Water rushes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the beach, which was now little more than smoking rocks.\n&gt; Hissing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and steam rise up as cold water hits the rocks, making the area\n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely impossible to see through, although the Iron Fist&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanners were not affected by the water.

He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t see the shots, and two of them slam into his leg.
