If there was one, it&#39;d be a \nhatch). That hatch was probably designed to withstand laser shots and \nmissiles by the dozen!\n\nHe runs through the door, realizing why it had given in. It was \ndesigned to withstand things from the outside, from the inside could \nbe a different matter.\n\nA blast wall shuts the corridor after he runs by, Prowl jumping into \nthe air and transforming into beast mode. There was a few thousand \nmiles to the Ark, he figured he could catch her by then.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * the halls whizzed by as she kept increasing her speed, knowing \nthat she \n&gt; was heading towards the Ark but not knowing just how little of it \nwas \n&gt; left...if anything.\n&gt; But she heard Prowls footsteps thundering behind her, a ting of \nannoyance \n&gt; brushing over her.\n&gt; Hadn&#39;t she told him to remain behind?\n&gt; She sighed, couldn&#39;t he just stay behind just once when she asked \nhim to? \n&gt; Just once?!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Since she knew that she couldn&#39;t stop she simply increased her \nspeed and \n&gt; headed for the back exit, her hightened scanners telling her that \nit was \n&gt; less then 50ft ahead.\n&gt; With no time to lose she rounded the corner and spotted the door, \nonly \n&gt; bunching her muscles to go at her fastest, lowering her head.\n&gt; She had no time to wait for it to open, there wasn&#39;t enough time. \nShe wanted \n&gt; to know what was going on and she wanted to know NOW!!\n&gt; \n&gt; With an echoing slam she plowed into the door, literally ripping it \noff it&#39;s \n&gt; hinges and throwing it off several feet beyond the base.\n&gt; And without even pausing pace she continued out into the tall \nyellow grasses \n&gt; if the plains around the base, though her bulk kept her from \ndisappearing \n&gt; into it&#39;s depths.*\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________IRIS\n&gt; \n&gt; ( Thanx, Yanshosh.I had forgotten.)\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her systems were depleted, she had to say that much, but \neverything \n&gt; worked. However...when she had thought that it was just dark in the \nruins of \n&gt; the Ark she hadn&#39;t known that all of the systems were completely \n&gt; destroyed...and there was nothing left to be able to actually call \nit a ship \n&gt; anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; But she still knew that Iron Raptor was on her way there raight at \nthat \n&gt; moment...with Prowl in hot persuit no doubt.\n&gt; But there would still be the questions to answer...and the \ndownloading.\n&gt; That was right, she would have to be downloaded back into Iron \nRaptors \n&gt; systems. Not only because that there was no Ark to exist in \nanymore, but \n&gt; also that this new beast mode was SUPPOSED to be. It wasn&#39;t a \nmutation, it \n&gt; was already in her systems. And she would have to teach that fem \nhow to \n&gt; access it properly.\n&gt; There would be so much to learn in so little time,and there wasa \nlot of work \n&gt; to be done.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
