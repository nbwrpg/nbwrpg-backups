He hefts \nBelthassan gently, and turns to face Melchana, &quot;Melchana, lead that \nway, I won&#39;t allow Belthassan to lose functionality while I can \nprevent it.&quot; He looks around, but doesn&#39;t know where to go, so he \njust waits for Melchana.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Belthassan is at sea, holding Gesper. The Hellgate is right above \nthem \n&gt; but they need help fast to get out of the water.\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana looks around, trying to find some kind of vine. She sees \nthe \n&gt; crane, but it is not long enough to get them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana: AAAAAARGHH! Stupid technological ship! You can&#39;t find a \nvine \n&gt; when you need one!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jetstorm is panicked. He was not prepared for this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jetstorm: Melchana! Why don&#39;t you do something?\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana: And why are you not doing anything, Nutbrain?\n&gt; \n&gt; Daemos: Jetstorm, for the Matrix&#39;s sake! You&#39;re a hawk! Fly down \nthere \n&gt; and pick them up!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jetstorm: Y... Yeah... That&#39;s right... I can fly...\n&gt; \n&gt; He transforms to hawk mode and flies down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jetstorm: Bel! Hold on to my talons!\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: Finally! (He spits some water out) It was time one of \nyou \n&gt; acted!\n&gt; \n&gt; The waves were strong and violent. Belthassan had to use great \nstamina \n&gt; to keep his head out. He made a sweep with his hand to grab the \ntalon, \n&gt; but missed it widely. Still holding his brother, he moved his legs \nand \n&gt; swam nearer. The second pass succeeded, and Jetstorm used his \nlarge \n&gt; wings to get back and into the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as they were inside, Daemos closed the doors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Melchana: Anachronox, help me get them to regenerative units! It \nwon&#39;t \n&gt; get them to full health, but it will at least get them back in \nsome \n&gt; sort of shape!\n\n\n"}}
