One of the four opened a link to the\nleader &quot;Should we attack?&quot; it asked thinking about taking advantage of the\nsituation.\n\n&quot;Hold your ground and let them waste thier energy, one injured bot will be\neasier to take out than two.&quot; THe leader flew lower and landed on a\nbuildings ledge. &quot;I&#39;ll give you the signal, wait until then.&quot;\n\nTaking notes on the battle the four noted the big bots missle launchers, the\nmissles could easily be refitted to fit them. The prizes of the attack were\nlooking better and better.\n\nThe ground collapsed beneath the monsterbot causing it to drop below ground,\nit appeared the drunken bot had won.\n\nSuddenly rubble burst from the hole, the monsterbot presenting himself back\ninto the battle.\n\nShortly later the fight seemed over, the leader of the four observers was\nready to make his move. A shadow passed overhead as Grimlock flew overhead.\nAgain he had to delay his attack. The other Dinobots arrived on the scene\nmaking the prize that much juicier. He didn&#39;t want to wait any longer.\n&quot;Cybrats move, pick your targets and make every shot count.&quot; being the only\nflyer he flew down toward Grimlock fireing two piercing missles at the\nDinobot leader. If successfull the missles would pierce the Dinobots armor\nand explode from the inside.\n\nArty rolled in from behind fireing two sidewinders at Slag and four shots\nfrom his cannon at Repugnus.\n\nDogged launched a taser line at the bum, then tossed a smoke grenade into\nthe middle of the action to blind the prey. The Cybrats had optical implants\ndesigned to see through the smoke, Most other senses would be blind.\n\nBrandings flamethrowers flipped onto her arms launching flames at the blind\nside of Repugnus. her optics locked on, her aim was infalible, her ability\nto down the target was out of necessity, there was nothing personal about\nthe battle the Cybrats would have attacked any other factions the same way.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, May 26, 2001 2:25 PM\nSubject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n\n\n&gt; ::Repugnus::\n&gt; Repugnus looses his grip on the bot as he walks.\n&gt; &quot;Talk, or I&#39;ll send you to the pit.&quot;\n&gt; He he takes a swing with his large pincers at the bots head.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yanshosh@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The large bot mumbles something incoherent and continues forward even\n&gt; &gt; though he was pinned.
