The Tripredacus lady walks to \nthe west side of the ship.\n\nMelchana: The ship, Firedrill, is divided in three parts. The west \nside contains the cargo part, the right is where the renewal chamber \nis. The tower contains the Matrix Chamber and the command room. For \nnow, we&#39;re going to the cargo bay where Belthassan is likely to be.\n\nShe enters the bay. Tankor is there with Belthassan, inventoring the \nenergon fruits. They were huge fruits holding a massive bright \nblue charge of energon.\n\nBelthassan: Ah! Sister! How good to see you! And you as well, \nFiredrill!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -- Firedrill --\n&gt; \n&gt; Firedrill nods, &quot;Sure,&quot; He follows Melchana, all the while glancing \n&gt; around him at new surroundings, a sense of culture shock hits him \n&gt; momentarily, but he shrugs it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Melchana shoots a sideglance at him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Melchana: Yes, is it not? The feeling of the reformatting ritual \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; also a... strong experience. We had to reformat the whole \n&gt; landscape in \n&gt; &gt; order to power to our base. Follow me. My brother is waiting for \n&gt; us \n&gt; &gt; now. Do you want to meet him before you go to the Renewal Chamber?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She rises from the piloting seat and slowly walks out.\n\n\n"}}
