She had a regal air about her, since she thought of\n&gt;   herself as almost royalty since she was decedant from a high arachnid\n&gt;   background.  Her form moved and swayed in one fluid motion as she\n&gt;   walked.  \n&gt;   &quot;So, who is it exactly that you&#39;ll be introducing me to? And what are\n&gt;   thier ranks?&quot; Keeping her tone of voice as if she was speaking to a\n&gt;   bot of equal statis, though she didn&#39;t think any bot could be.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
