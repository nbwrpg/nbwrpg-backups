I&#39;m taking back control of the Oblitercons \nfrom Zardus, and I must say, this is one of the most entertaining battles \nsince my time in the RPG, I LOVE WAR)\n\n\nNemesis Enforcer/The Oblitercons/Scattershot/Unitron/Punch/Demon Wulf/Flesh \nRipper/Dark Claw/Minion/Chaos/Serpentor/Sixshot/Ares/Shockwave:\n\n\n\nNemesis Enforcer dodged Shokaract&#39;s missiles easily by taking off into the \nair, but ten of Jetstorm&#39;s blasts dug into his abdomen.  Yelling out in pain, \nNemesis fired off 25 rapid laser bolts off at Jetstorm.  &quot;YOU AREN&#39;T MAKING \nME HAPPY!&quot;\n\n--\n\nScattershot laughed (since Sharpedge wasn&#39;t exactly point blank, that&#39;s what \nI&#39;m basing this one, Alloran), taking off into the air, firing off 20 rounds \nof bullets down at Sharpedge, all of the Mafia&#39;s blasts and other weapons \nfire passing under him harmlessly.\n\n---\n\nUnitron transforms into his tank mode, firing off blasts that intercepted \nthree of the missiles, one digging into his side making a huge dent.  The \nmachine gun mounted on the top of his tank mode swerved, firing off 25 rapid \nlaser bolts at Stronghold&#39;s chest.\n\n-----\n\nSerpentor sidesteps, a single blast digging into his right side, his armor \ndamged in that section somewhat badly.  Raising his weapon, Serpentor fired a \nblast from his plasma launcher off at Blender.\n\nPunch, inside the Alliance base, directs most of the Alliance base&#39;s autoguns \nto fire upon Diskus, Deemos, Gigas, and Blender.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf laughs as the four blasts hit his chest.  Not even flinching, \nDemon Wulf looks down to the charred part of his chest and gives a slight \nsmirk, showing off his rows of deadly teeth.\n\nRaising his optics, he fired off three pairs of crimson lasers from his optic \nsensors at Gigas&#39; sternum, at the same time raising his sword, the blade \nlaunching off, now a missile, heading at Gigas&#39; pelvis, a new blade replacing \nthe old one.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw laughs loudly as the blasts strike his chest.  Raising both palms \nnow, two black balls of energy appear in them, Dark Claw throwing both \nexplosive balls of energy with a grenade-like effect at Shockaract.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper is engulfed in flames, stepping out of the flames laughing, his \nfur singed.  Raising his rifle, he fired off four blasts at Serge&#39;s neck, \nthree optic blasts at Serge&#39;s legs.\n\n---\n\nChaos caugh three blasts in his grill, the other five smashed into his left \nlight.  Activating his missile launcher in the back of his trailer mode, he \nfired off two missiles at Rizopas.\n\n---\n\nMinion caught all the bullets in his hood, transforming to robot mode.  He \nraised his rocket launcher, firing off a missile at Ice Doom&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nDark One transformed into jet fighter mode, launching into the air, firing \ntwo missiles down at Diskus.\n\n---\n\nPyro, still in tank mode, fired off three fire balls at Diskus.\n\n---\n\nHiss raised his fusion cannon, firing four blasts off at Shockaract.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown transformed into his artillery mode, firing off a mortar at Ice \nDemon.\n\n---\n\nScavenger took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Blender&#39;s \npelvis.\n\n---\n\nSixshot flew into the seen in his space fighter mode, firing off twenty-five \nrapid laser blasts down at Gigas.  &quot;Zardus, I wish to join your group.  Shuko \nis dead, there&#39;s nothing left!  I need sanctuary, as does Ares.&quot;\n\n---\n\nAres, in tank mode, drove up, the four barrels of his tank mode moving \nslighty, three shots from each firing off, a total of twelve laser bolts \nerupting from the barrels of the tank , all heading for Grenade.\n\n======\n\nShockwave finished his regeneration in the forest close to the Alliance base. \n He could hear the mass gunfire, and the numerous explosions.  It was \ninteresting.  On foot, he headed for the Alliance base conserve energy.\n\n"}}
