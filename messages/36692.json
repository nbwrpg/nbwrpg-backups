The combined attacked of Mosquitor, Zardus, \nHurricane was enough to Aelo, who fell in stasis lock.\n\nOcipite avoided most of the shots of Wheeljack and Hurricane&#39;s \nLightning bolt when she saw Aelo fell in stasis lock she knew that \nshe was lost; she started to look a round searching a exit... but she \nwas surrounded by enemies.\n\nJust a thing could help her, she started to absorb the limited energy \nthat the ship could have... her eyes started to get a pale blue \nshine... When she tought that she has enough she shot the energy, \ndoing that computer&#39;s screen started to brake, and the lights turned \noff.\n\nOcipite know that it was a small chance, she ran towards the exit \navoiding Mosquitor and the acyd that was in the floor. SHe left the \nroom and lost inside the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; :::Wheeljack/Hurricane:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Wheeljack dodges a few of the shots, but gets hit by most. he \nfires 12 \n&gt; shots at Aelo and 12 at Ocipite::\n&gt; ~~~~~\n&gt; Hurricane: Oh, you want a piece of me?
