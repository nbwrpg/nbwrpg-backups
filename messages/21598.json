Then he had a idea.\n\n\n\nArcangel open his chest plate and pulled out the maximal matrix.\n\n\n\nArcangel:\n\n\n\n\n&quot;you all know what this lets see what would happen if I used this. If I can. \nHot Rod time to put your spark back into place.&quot;\n\n\n\nAs he opened weird fellings started to go over him. He could not tell what \nwas happening life,truth,Justice,love,peace,darkness,evil, and pain all came \nto his mined at once. He was changing again this time. he could feel more \npower then ever he was Angel Prime. Then a huge blue blast came at Hot Rod \nto change him back to a maximal. Arcangel was bigger and older looking his \nblue and silver armor shined better then ever. his eyes burned like fire. He \nwas truely the next Prime to rise.\n\n\n\nFury fired a net at Feline then transformed and fell backwards at the sight \nof Angel Prime.\n\n\n\n[yanshosh when you put the new chars list make it Angel Prime instead of \nArcangel. RoboRick plz do not make Hot Rod into Rodimus Prime anytime soon \nplz.]\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
