But she knew that she had to be a role model, and k=\r\nnew in her own heart, that Tucson wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer and he was=\r\n going to bring Rodimus back, no matter what was thrown in front of him.  S=\r\nhe goes over to Elita, as Rat Trap follows her, wanting to help her out as =\r\nwell.  For a moment, they hold hands as they both smile into each other&#39;s e=\r\nyes.\n\nStraight Shot then goes to Elita, and puts a gentile hand on her shou=\r\nlder. \n\n&quot; On Earth, there&#39;s this popular term known as &quot;The Knight in Shini=\r\nng Armor.&quot;  Who would ride into the occasion and smite evil demons when the=\r\ny threatened to cast darkness and dispair on the innocent.  Even though he =\r\ndoesn&#39;t ride a horse with fancy armor, and carry a lance and a shield, Tucs=\r\non is one of those Knights.  He won&#39;t give up until the dragon or in this c=\r\nase, the insect is slayed and Rodimus brought safely back to consciousness.=\r\n  He will win this battle for Rodimus, I know he will.&quot;\n\nRat Trap thinks fo=\r\nr a moment.\n\n&quot;Ya know, she&#39;s got a point Elita, everything Wheels did up ti=\r\nll now, and everything he actually succeeded in doing, that took real coura=\r\nge and determination and in those days, on Earth, that&#39;s what medevil knigh=\r\nts are made of. So yeah, he&#39;s definitely one of them, a Knight in shining s=\r\nilver armor and when the lights strike against his paint job, he&#39;ll blind t=\r\nhe eyes of those who aren&#39;t used to such light.  Your dad&#39;ll be saved, I kn=\r\now he will.  Wheels ain&#39;t gonna leave a fight unfaught.&quot;\n\nNight Shift walks=\r\n over to them.\n\n&quot;Bet your rear bumpers he&#39;s not.  He&#39;s gonna kick bug aft b=\r\nig time, and when he does, he ain&#39;t gonna stop there, he&#39;s gonna fight hard=\r\n until there&#39;s some sorta sense of peace on this planet. It&#39;s who he is and=\r\n what he does.  And it&#39;s that drive that earned him his name in the first p=\r\nlace.  Eventually the Decepticons, Predacons and Unicronians are gonna defi=\r\nnitely know who he is and what he&#39;s capable of doing.  Any decendent of Opt=\r\nimus Prime is gonna be sure the job gets done.&quot;\n\nThat gets a few heads to t=\r\nurn, as Quickstride, Rat Trap and Straight Shot look at him.\n\n&quot; What&#39;dya sa=\r\ny?  No way, really?&quot;\n\nAs Quickstride scratches behind an ear. Straight Shot=\r\n and Rat Trap gawk.\n\n&quot; Wha?  Ya mean all this time I fought with Tucson in =\r\nthe past, and all along, come ta find out he&#39;s related ta Optimus Prime? Wo=\r\nw...  I - had no idea..  No wonder why he&#39;s got so much courage and determi=\r\nnation and selflessness. &quot;\n\nRat Trap chimes in.\n\n&quot; Well, that sure explains=\r\n a lot.  I knew there was somethn&#39; familliar about &#39;em, but I couldn&#39;t put =\r\nmy finger on it till Nightshift said somethn&#39;.  Yeah, it makes sense, his a=\r\nlt form, a large truck with a large trailer, he&#39;s just as tall, body featur=\r\nes almost like Optimus Prime&#39;s..  Slightly different but nearly the same.. =\r\nAnd his voice, the patterns are almost like the big guy&#39;s..  But still I ne=\r\nver really put that together until now.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot; Tucson does=\r\nn&#39;t know that I know about it.  I just so happened ta look up somethn&#39; in h=\r\nis file one day, when he asked me ta look over it for &#39;em and there it was.=\r\n  Same molds used ta build Optimus.  Of course a lotta things were changed =\r\nover the years, and Tucson came out different, color sceme and all, but he&#39;=\r\ns definitely got Optimus Prime&#39;s attributes and physical strength.  Well, t=\r\nhat came after he got the power of the Matrix..  But he sure had the back b=\r\none when he was just his normal self.  And Elita, you can count on him ta d=\r\neliver, and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s gonna do.&quot;\n\nThey all now gather around=\r\n Elita to offer their reassurance.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly20=\r\n02@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; PErceptor/Elita:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Amazing&quot; say dryly Perceptor whil=\r\ne he senzed all that power&quot;None of all \n&gt; Predacons had held such power&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Then his practical mind focused in wish Rodimus and tucson back and well=\r\n, \n&gt; Kup prayed to PRimus for the comming back of their friends.

A power so simple yet so pow=\r\nerful that only \n&gt; &gt; those with pure hearts possess it.  You&#39;re feeling it =\r\ntoo, you have that \n&gt; &gt; power, we all do.  We just gotta tap into it, and l=\r\net it be felt by Tucson \n&gt; &gt; and Rodimus Prime.  If they can feel that we&#39;r=\r\ne pulling for them, they&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; find the strength to make it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat=\r\n Trap smiles back to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;She&#39;s right Silverbolt, we can do this,=\r\n we got what it takes, it&#39;s in our \n&gt; &gt; hearts, and no one can take that aw=\r\nay from us, no one.  But if Wheels&#39;n \n&gt; &gt; Speedy are gonna make it, we gott=\r\na show them that our hearts are pulln&#39; \n&gt; &gt; for them all the way.  See?
