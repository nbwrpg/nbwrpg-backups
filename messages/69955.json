If he had told him the absolute truth, that was it, the mission was a fa=\r\nilure.  Yet, there was still a way around his questions.  He knew just the =\r\ntrick.  He shows him his ability to switch signatures, this was indeed vali=\r\nd. and in doing so, when his signature is switched to Autobot/maximal frequ=\r\nency, he is in tune with what happens on the other side of the fence.\n\n&quot; Ye=\r\nah, there is somethn&#39; I should tell ya.  When I switch signatures ta keep t=\r\nhe Autobots unaware of my faction status, I&#39;m in tune with everything that =\r\nhappens.  Includn&#39; a change of status among the Autobots. I got a heck of a=\r\n vibe just now.  See this?  This little indication light, when I switched o=\r\nver, this came up.  That means one of them just got a slag of an upgrade.  =\r\nAnd I know who too.  Tucson&#39;s a Prime now.  He got his mitts on the Matrix&#39;=\r\ns power and he got it.  Slag it, I was so close ta stoppn&#39; &#39;em too.&quot;  \n\nHe =\r\nhoped his fortelling would ease suspicions among the Predacons and Deceptic=\r\nons.  After all, confessing something as such was a big gamble for any bot.=\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just ignore it, it&#39;s easier. I wasn&#39;t feeling too well when I wrote =\r\nthat. I&#39;ve got pneumonia for the second time this year, and that was perhap=\r\ns when I wasn&#39;t feeling my best. My bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Eww, oh, sorry to hear t=\r\nhat :( I hope you are feeling better now.\n&gt; I have had that once, it was no=\r\nt fun at all. Don&#39;t let us push you\n&gt; into posting before you are ready. Ta=\r\nke your time.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; Okay, so what I got ta tell ya is I think he&#39;s =\r\nplann&#39;n an all out assault on you guys, like tryn&#39; ta take this place for t=\r\nhe Maximals and Autobots. Wants ta level the fortress ta the ground. What I=\r\n think we gotta do is beat &#39;em at his own game. And he knows we&#39;re gonna tr=\r\ny&#39;n get at the Ark, and if we go there, we&#39;re done for. See? It&#39;s not easy =\r\ngettn&#39; around the guy because he ain&#39;t your average scrap heap. He don&#39;t th=\r\nink like an average Autobot. So, if I were you guys, that shell program you=\r\n got gon&#39; on, I think ya better have a bot make a backup of that&#39;n hold ont=\r\no it. Because he&#39;s gonna try&#39;n blow this place sky high, and everything wit=\r\nh it. And as far as I know he&#39;ll be barrelln&#39; in here with the rest of his =\r\nposse any time now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course he was telling them a complete lie, =\r\nhoping they&#39;d buy it. His tone shows no indication of telling a fib. Inside=\r\n he was hoping that his idea mixed with Tucson&#39;s would take hold.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scor=\r\nponok nodded thoughtfully and attentively as Nightshift talked,\n&gt; his optic=\r\n getting a speculative hue to them. &quot;How does Tuscon expect\n&gt; to accomplish=\r\n his task?&quot; the large Predacon asked, his voice betraying\n&gt; only a few misg=\r\nivings about Nightshift and his story. &quot;The Maximals\n&gt; have to know that th=\r\nis fortress can be made near impregnable should\n&gt; Hydras command it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAs Nightshift talked of the shell program Scorponok&#39;s musing attitude\n&gt; bec=\r\name sharp as he looked back at the mech. &quot;The shell program is well\n&gt; prote=\r\ncted.&quot; He said, obviously his suspicions comming once again into\n&gt; focus. &quot;=\r\nAnd with all of us here, there is no way that he could take us\n&gt; all. He al=\r\nready arttempted to break in here once, and he failed. It\n&gt; would be foolis=\r\nh for him to try again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Scorponok&#39;s optics narrow as he watched Night=\r\nshift, &quot;Unless of course\n&gt; there is something that you are holding back fro=\r\nm us . . . &quot; Scorponok\n&gt; let the question hang in the air as he waited for =\r\nNightshift&#39;s\n&gt; response, along with the potentially disasterous result shou=\r\nld\n&gt; Nightshift answer wrongly.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
