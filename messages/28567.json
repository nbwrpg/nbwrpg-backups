His \nclaws were still jammed into her back, but they slide out as Prowl \nloses stability in the air and falls. He spins around on his way \ndown, jerking his foot out of her grasp and sinking his front claws \ninto Iron Raptor&#39;s back again, his teeth bitting at her neck.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * She avoided the fireball and darts but Prowls claws were another \nstory. \n&gt; Already feeling one hitch into her back and rip a nice sized gash \nin it \n&gt; while the impact almost send her stomach to the ground.\n&gt; Back legs were the most powerful part on the body because they had \nthe mose \n&gt; muscle and force begind them , thanking the Maxtrix now that \nnothing was \n&gt; broken.\n&gt; This happend so fast, though, that she had no real time to realize \nthat \n&gt; Prowl had actually got mad and attacked her.\n&gt; &lt; Must be the beast mode.&gt; She thought while she moved to the side \na bit.\n&gt; Prowl could get himself killed unless he either mastered it in a \nshort time \n&gt; or was removed of it.  To remove it would be easy, she would just \nhave to \n&gt; transform back, or she hoped that it would work that way. But she \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; going to try it just yet.\n&gt; She was a bit too pissed off to do that.\n&gt; Iron Raptor roared and jumped, hoping to get a hand or hip, either \nwould do \n&gt; just fine. She just wanted to get Prowl down onto the ground where \nshe could \n&gt; deal with him better and his advantage of the air would be gone.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
