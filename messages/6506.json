They must not know who they are dealing with\nhere,\n&gt; just wait and see...\n&gt;\n&gt; Sinesis and Sinister were suddenly fighting side by side again, and not\n&gt; doing a very good job, neither! Assassins versus Ninja warriors, who could\n&gt; win? Deemos threw Sinesis through the air with the greatest of ease.\nSinesis\n&gt; jumped back up, but Deemos shoulder blocked him and down he went again.\n&gt; Sinister fires at Inzola, but she spins around and suddenly pulls out a\n&gt; shield, blocking the attacks. The minor wounds Deemos and Inzola had\nstarted\n&gt; to heal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Aim at their sparks...&quot; Sinesis whispered to Sinister. Sinister palyed\n&gt; dead. Sinesis roared in rage and tried to fight them both. Deemos and\nInzola\n&gt; simply stcuk their cannon to his head and fired. He flew back and also\n&gt; played dead, even though those shots hurt like the pit. Deemos and Inzola\n&gt; looked at each other and laughed, they expected them to fall for this?\nThen\n&gt; there was a ticking sound. Like a grenade. Inzola and Deemos looked behind\n&gt; them, but the grenade was a dud. Inzola turned around and both Sinesis and\n&gt; Sinister fired into her chest. Bang! Inzola flew backwards, a hole in her\n&gt; chest and her spark showing. Deemos spun a staff around in circles and\n&gt; chopped Sinister to pieces! Sinesis knocked Deemos down and scrambled to\n&gt; Inzola. He noticed the machine and ripped it out.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Healing device, eh?&quot; Sinesis said. He jabbed his claw into it, destroying\n&gt; it. A spark flew around and glowed before him. Lightmare&#39;s spark. It\n&gt; crackled a few times and fell to the ground, fading away to go wherever\nit&#39;s\n&gt; final destination was. Sinesis looked at it in puzzlement when it\n&gt; diappeared.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Never turn your back on your opponent!&quot; Deemos said, he swung his staff\nand\n&gt; Sinesis went down. Sinesis pulled out a grenade, a small one. Deemos\ngrabbed\n&gt; it from him and it shot a laser beam into Deemos&#39; chest and blew him in\n&gt; half. Sinesis stumbled over, his sneaky trick winning him the battle. He\ncut\n&gt; a hole in Deemos&#39; chest and extracted another healing device. He ripped\nthis\n&gt; one open and another spark was flying around. Sinesis tried to catch it,\nbut\n&gt; this one wasn&#39;t ready for the Matrix. Sinesis sighed and pulled out his\n&gt; blaster to shoot it. Sinesis felt a burning pain in his back, and Deemos\nwas\n&gt; standing behind him, self reattached with a bit of bonding. He simply cut\n&gt; down Sinesis, picked up Inzola, and started walking away. Sineesis and\n&gt; Sinister&#39;s parts lay in the battlefield, the spark of Gangon floating in\n&gt; front of BrightBlade...\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 12, 2000 9:38 AM\n&gt; Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/DevilDuer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perndabot, Reptilica, and Bloodystrike look slightly confused as\nSinister\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Sinesis start figting Deemoz and Inzola.
