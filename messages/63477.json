One less thing to worry about.  He had enough to worry about already, but this was a welcome relief.

But there was no good way to solve it without everyone being hurt, not that he could see.  So for now, things would have to remain as they were, and hope nothing turned sour between the three of them.  \n\nDark Mouse &lt;raccoon7679@...&gt; wrote:\nWolfblade::\n\nShe felt his hand clasp over hers and she smiled. &quot;Well, at least they\nare back.
