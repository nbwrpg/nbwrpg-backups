Well, when a website dies when the webmaster \nstops \n&gt; updating the website... right? What if we (RPGERs) do a temporary \nwebsite \n&gt; for NBW... but instead exist one webmaster, we&#39;ll have more. Then, \nif \n&gt; one of webmasters can&#39;t work on the website (or worst: quit) for a \n&gt; while, the others can keep the site running and updating it. If one \nof \n&gt; webmasters quits,  the others webmasters chooses an other member and \ntrain \n&gt; him/her, and give that person the passwords and needed information.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the website has to be updated, the webmasters share the job, \nand \n&gt; it will go much faster, since several people are doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Airly\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Check out Yahoo!
