Okay, okay, so yeah, I&#39;m rankn&#39; on &#39;em my bad.

Ever=\r\ny time we try ta ask &#39;em a question we get blown off.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Yeah, that part is kind of right.  He&#39;s not exactly the most sociable =\r\npart, and nothing against him but, he is treading on thin ice with Tucson s=\r\nir, and I really think someone should talk to Tucson before he blows his ow=\r\nn stack.  I can see it in my brother&#39;s face, there&#39;s an air about him that =\r\nseems troubling.  One of these days a real fight between them will break ou=\r\nt and there may be no way ta stop it.  I tried talking to Tucson but he&#39;s a=\r\ns stubborn as Ratchet in that respect.  So, how do we hold the peace with b=\r\noth of them, because I&#39;d really like ta know that.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Is =\r\nthat what that vibration was all about? I thought it was another quake. Oka=\r\ny so what did Legacy do ta deserve another shout match with Tucson?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Quickstride looks back to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The usual, he tried to go against=\r\n Tucson&#39;s orders. And you know what happens if we disrespect a Prime, right=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh yeah, that&#39;s why I would never dare t=\r\na do anything like that, noooo waaaay, especially with Tucson. As far as I&#39;=\r\nm concerned, like Rodimus, what he says, goes. Legacy better watch his step=\r\n, that&#39;s two strikes against him now. And yeah, I&#39;ve been keepn&#39; count.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot frowns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s even still with us.=\r\n Something about him so creeps me out it&#39;s not funny.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord=\r\n Elder watched as Legacy walked away and Tuscon and Talon began\n&gt; talking. =\r\nHe sighed again and began walking to where the others were.\n&gt; He could hear=\r\n thier conversation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you really counting?&quot; Lord Elder and Quickst=\r\nride a curious look\n&gt; on his face. His face and form looked a little bigger=\r\n than before, his\n&gt; face clear and shiny, and yet he still managed to have =\r\na haggered look\n&gt; on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;While you are counting, don&#39;t forget w=\r\nhile everyone else was off\n&gt; fighting in the battle when Cyclonus and his d=\r\nrones were sacking\n&gt; everyone including the Predacons that Legacy single ha=\r\nndedly held the\n&gt; Ark against 5 of Cyclonus&#39; most powerful cronies. When we=\r\n had to go\n&gt; rescue Rodimus who was there helping, taking much of the damag=\r\ne and\n&gt; expending his precious energon to shield you guys. That was Legacy.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder frowned, &quot;Has anyone ever even talked with legacy? Does\n&gt;=\r\n anyone even know the first thing about him? He arrived here from\n&gt; Primus =\r\nknows where and no one even asked him anything. You trust him\n&gt; when the en=\r\nergon chips are down, but now you are ready to boot him\n&gt; out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What =\r\nare we Maximals or rabble. If we turn to fighting among\n&gt; ourselves then wh=\r\nat are we?&quot; Lord Elder shook his head as he began to\n&gt; walk away. &quot;And befo=\r\nre you go betting on who would win the battle you\n&gt; were discussing, you mi=\r\nght want to find out more about Legacy first.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
