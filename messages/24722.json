The bot was no fun.\n\nTeltoli looked up in surprise as he shot the deer and the tree. She \nraised her right eyebrow, and let out a small giggle, disbelieving.\n\n&quot;Okay, you come in here, demanding that Carnage must be killed \nbecause she is killing wildlife. That I partially understand. But \nnow, you go and kill the thing you are trying to save. Or do you a \nfancy towards fat, hair, ugly pigs? So no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to \ntake you seriously, especially if you act like that!&quot;\n\nShe let out another tiny giggle, and put a hand over her mouth, \nkeeping her gun still aimed at Instrat.\n\n\n"}}
