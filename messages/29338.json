I feel like I&#39;m reading a really\n&gt; really bad fanfic, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s in\n&gt; the &quot;so bad it&#39;s FRICKIN&#39; HYSTERICAL&quot; category. But\n&gt; it&#39;s oddly Laurel and Hardy-like. Y&#39;know? Just\n&gt; thinking that somebody actually WROTE THAT and expects\n&gt; it to be taken seriously makes it laugh out loud pee\n&gt; your pants funny.\n&gt;\n&gt; Recon: Hahhaa, fifteen nuclear warheads is not enough,\n&gt; You cannot harm me, for I am beautiful!\n&gt;\n&gt; Burning Hammer: La la la la, I&#39;m IGNOOOOORING YOUUUUU!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m reminded of when I used to play Transformers with\n&gt; this friend of mine who lived down the street when I\n&gt; was a kid. Dude wouldn&#39;t accept damage if you paid\n&gt; him, ESPECIALLY if he was Optimus Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way...does anybody notice that kids in toy\n&gt; commericals in the 80&#39;s had THE MOST KICKASS PLACES TO\n&gt; PLAY? Seriously, they&#39;d always have little\n&gt; mini-jungles or rocky mountainous areas. I would\n&gt; always have...the carpet, or my bed...if it was in a\n&gt; mountainous area where my Decepticons were teaming up\n&gt; with Cobra Commander to ambush the unsuspecting\n&gt; Autobots, MAYBE the couch cushins in the floor. Those\n&gt; kids had it made, man. I swear, you could have shown\n&gt; them your brand new Fortress Maximus and it STILL\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have measured up.\n&gt;\n&gt; *dreamily* Mmmmmmmm. Fortress Maximus...\n&gt;\n&gt; Keep up the bad work you two. *ROFLMAO*\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m going upstairs now to engage in my 52nd viewing of\n&gt; Transformers: The Movie.
