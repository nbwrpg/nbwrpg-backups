There was something going on. Just as he asked what it \nwas, Dark Mouse walked out of him. He glowered a little, and decided \nto wait for her to return. He sat down in the commander&#39;s chair in \nthe bridge. He waited for minutes, but his patience was thin.\n\nHe jumped up and walked down to Dark Mouse&#39;s location, to someone&#39;s \nquarters. He leaned up against the frame of the door with his hip, \nglaring with his bright crimson optics.\n\n&quot;Hey! Ya wanna fill me in or not?&quot; he said over to her.\n\n\n"}}
