She transformed into bat \nmode and stretched her wings.  She felt great.  She needed the CR chamber \nmore than she realized.  She transformed back into bot mode. She looked to \nsee if Cybershark was still there or not.  She wanted to thank him before \nshe left. She knew she had to get out of there as soon as possable.  She \ndidn&#39;t want them to capture her and kill her like her friends. Her friends, \nshe thought, they must be dead by now.  HellBeast surely has killed them. \nShe mumbled something about how she left them when they needed her.  She sat \ndown in front of the CR chamber and covered her eyes trying to blot out the \nmemory from her mind.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
