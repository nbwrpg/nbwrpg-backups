He fires four\nmore EMP blasts, aiming them all at Hell Beast. He was glad that he\ntook out Inferno, and from the power of his EMP gun, probably for the\nentire fight, but he wanted to kill Hell Beast as well.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl avoids the missiles, feeling shots riddle his armor. He roars\nand keeps flying up, swiping his large claws at Cracken.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler dives in the air, an optic blast hitting him in the shoulder.\nHe growls and fires two more missiles at Adrax. He smiles as he sees\nthe Element (Jen, can you put G or S in parenthesis next time, to\ndistinguish between Element the gestalt, and Element then ship?) open\nfire on the attackers.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; It wasnt a mode Yan, I said he missles exploded on the right and\nleft side of \n&gt; Iron Raptor, not on her body at all.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Marine&#39;s eyes bulged with the optic blast ready to strike at\nIron \n&gt; Raptor, and they did. The sets of blasts cut thin green lines\nthrough the \n&gt; smoke at the beast. \n&gt;        Acid splattered Marine, and small holes began to bubble on\nhis armor \n&gt; as the acrid smell and steam rose. Grabbing onto his plasma assult\nriffle \n&gt; with both hands, he aimed, and released a spitfire of plasma, 25\nshots, at IR.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Craken was in his assault chapper , and picked up Prowl even\nbefore he \n&gt; left the ground. Craken, large and armed with a dual chain gun and\nmissle \n&gt; launchers, sent four missles scattering at Prowl as his chain gun\nlit up \n&gt; sending 25 shots each.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Adrax is sent to the ground as one missles explodes on his\nback, \n&gt; opening a nasty slit. He turns over and counter attacks with 15\nblasts from \n&gt; two angry optics.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast see&#39;s the discharge by Killfest on a small wrist\nradar, \n&gt; turns, and slams Inferno into them. With a bright blaze Infern ofel\nto the \n&gt; ground with his head comically spinning on his neck. Hel lBeast\ngoffed, and \n&gt; fired his chain gun at Killfest.\n&gt;        Meanwhile, The blasts fired by Element, not to sure which\none, burst \n&gt; around them. The Four Predacons began to run, taking numerous hits.\n\n\n"}}
