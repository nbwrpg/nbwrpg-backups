He had understodd Primus&#39; rationale\nfor reviving him and totally agreed, not out of\nconceit, but out of a deep understanding that unless\nthe finest warriors of all time stand together united\nas one race, they were doomed. There seemd to be a\nnumber of sparks who would make a worthy front line,\nbut how to get in touch with Primus. Shadowcaster knew\nhe could commune with other sparks only by locking\nonto strong emotions. How he&#39;d be able to commune with\nPrimusc when his current level of telepathy wwas so\nlimited was beyond him, at least for a split second.\n\nDeciding that his current form was the most compact\nway to navigate the Maximal base, he entered, then\nopened a channel to Rodimus. His tone grave and filled\nwith grim determination.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, there is something of the utmost importance\nI must discuss with you.&quot;\n\n\n\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
