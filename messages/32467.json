He raises\nhis \n&gt; right arm, equiped with his legendary weapon of destruction on it,\nand \n&gt; takes aim at the pods racing towards the ark. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what to \n&gt; do Astroblast&quot; he spits, as he pulls the trigger. &quot;They are nothing \n&gt; but stagnating waste, waiting to be born in the inferno of my fusion \n&gt; cannon&quot;. After finishing the sentence, a small huming sound builds \n&gt; inside of his weapon. Deep in it&#39;s pit two atoms begin to be forced \n&gt; together by energy process, and then a huge torrent of white energy \n&gt; begins to grow, and push outwards and grow, until it forms a large \n&gt; white bubble around the end of the cannon, straining to hold the \n&gt; enormous effects it creates. Air rips, as finally the storm hits. A \n&gt; large wide ark of fusion energy explodes from the cannon, pushing \n&gt; Megatron back a bit, as he plants his feet, unleashes a screaming \n&gt; blaze of chaotic energy towards two of the pods, it&#39;s massive area\nof \n&gt; effect. \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Wildrider approaches the pod, and quickly shifts and transforms\ntaking \n&gt; aim at it, and about to pull his trigger. Speedbreaker barrels into \n&gt; his legs however, sending the grey psychotic robot laughing maniacly \n&gt; into a rock. Speedbreaker then transforms, and takes aim himself at \n&gt; the pod, and is about to pull the trigger.\n\n\n"}}
