He goes down hard, falling on his le=\r\nft side.  The only sound that comes from him is a grunt of displeasure.  He=\r\n knew Rodimus would react as he did and in a way had positioned his body to=\r\n take the hit in a place where he knew would hurt immensely but would not c=\r\nause any loss of his senses.  \n\n&quot; I - have to admit, that - last shot was -=\r\n rather impressive.&quot;\n\nHe stays on the ground to make them think he was down=\r\n for the count, yet he had something else in mind. He didn&#39;t want to let th=\r\nem know but he was already hard at work on a plan B.  He thinks to himself.=\r\n\n\n&quot;All right, so that didn&#39;t work according to plan, so if I&#39;m going to res=\r\ntore Rodimus, I&#39;ll have to do it when I get a cue from someone or something=\r\n.  But for now, they took a cheap shot and it&#39;s time I returned the favor w=\r\nith one of my own.&quot;\n\nHe places his hands on the ground, and amzazingly enou=\r\ngh with the strength he has left from the shot, he manages to hoist himself=\r\n up with a hand stand leading into a spring back up onto his feet.  He stum=\r\nbles slightly.  He shrugs off what he thinks he can shrug off, and regroups=\r\n as best he can.  Now, instead of lying on the ground, he was concentrating=\r\n and side stepping his foe, with his hands positioned in unarmed combat, im=\r\nplementing a form of Kung Fu, which originates from Earth, known as Crane S=\r\ntyle, and mixing it with a bit of Cybertronian Know how.  After all, he was=\r\n partially trained as a Ninjabot and it was time he used those skills accor=\r\ndingly.\n\n&quot; Nothing comes easy, and I&#39;m aware of that.  I&#39;m not here to take=\r\n the easy way out.  I said I&#39;d do anything it took to restore my leader, an=\r\nd I am willing to stand by my pledge, no matter the cost to my own spark.  =\r\nSo if it means comming dangerously close to my own mortality, I accept the =\r\nchallenge.   I am willing to fight anyone who wishes to challenge me, and I=\r\n pledge to fight in Warrior&#39;s honor.&quot; \n\nHe waits to find out who will take =\r\nhim up on his offer.\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercy=\r\nclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Scourge quickly began moving his way around the room=\r\n in search of his illusive quarry. &quot;It would seem that the Autobot has a li=\r\nttle skill in evasion.&quot; Scourge said under his breath, &quot;But I will still ca=\r\ntch him. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus nodded from his position near to Hydras. He had his=\r\n weapon drawn out and at the ready, but so far had no likely target. If he =\r\nhad been aware of Tuscon&#39;s thought that it was he that controlled this new =\r\nRodimus he would have laughed. So far there was only enmity covered by a wa=\r\nrrior&#39;s respect that seperated the two. Cyclonus had no control over him in=\r\n the this new Dark Rodimus, that privalge went to Hydras and the other Pred=\r\nacons who lived here. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus continued to follow behind Scourge, his=\r\n loud foot falls sometimes earning him an annoyed glance from the hunter te=\r\nrminator. Both were ready to fall on thier prey when suddenly . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n He gathers the strength to walk into where he could be seen,\n&gt; &gt; judging b=\r\ny the heat that lights were giving off, as faint as the\n&gt; &gt; lights may be. =\r\n He stands before Cyclonus, and Scourge unarmed,\n&gt; &gt; yet ready to defend hi=\r\nmself if need be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Yes, you do have someone here.  And that someo=\r\nne is me.  I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know if you remember me or not, we may not have even=\r\n met.\n&gt; &gt;  My name is Tucson and I&#39;m proud to say that I am a member of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Autobot faction.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He then senses Rodimus not too far away.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; All right, Rodimus, I have a question for you, and you may answe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; at will.  What was the very verse that brought the Matrix of Leadersh=\r\nip\n&gt; &gt; to life, thus giving you the power of its spark?  I know you know th=\r\nis,\n&gt; &gt; and right now you may be hating my sorry servos, but I think I coul=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; use a refresher on what it was.  Can you tell me?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus =\r\nstraighted, he could feel Scourge behind him doing much the same thing. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;The fool! Scourge said, disappoinment written all over his face as well=\r\n as covering his words. &quot;I would have caught him, and now he walksd right i=\r\nnto the open?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus also turned to look at the Autbot who stepped =\r\nfrom the shadows, even as Darkhawk responded attempted to shoot the Autbot =\r\nwho called himself Tuscon. However the Autobot displayed a suprising amount=\r\n of dexterity as it not only shot once from his crossbow attempting to knoc=\r\nk the weapon from Darkhawk&#39;s hand, , but then flipped over and attempted an=\r\nother attack on him. \n&gt; \n&gt; As surprised as he was Cyclonus mearly reoriente=\r\nd his weapon on the newly positioned Tuscon as Scourge did much the same th=\r\ning. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon, no hint of recognition crossing his fa=\r\nce as he leveled his own weapon on him. &quot;The only refresher you are going t=\r\no get here is a refresher in PAIN!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; A trio of energy blasts lanced ou=\r\nt at Tuscon as Cyclonus, Scourge and Dark Rodimus opened fire!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: FY=\r\nI Scourge&#39;s armor makes him generally invisible to sensors, which would inc=\r\nlude sonar and radar. it also hides his heat personal signature as well. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
