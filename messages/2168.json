Memories.\nNothing real and nothing a bot could touch, images of the past that remained\nin the past. Nothing could bring them back to life, even though some of them\nshe longed to bring to life.\n&gt; Carnage sighed. It had turned out to be such a good day too.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
