You are still fairly damaged.&quot;\n\n* She then looked him over quickly to see if he had any other damage that \nshe didn&#39;t know about. Which there was none.\nZyber sighed in reliefe and then put all of her strength into lifting the \ngreat bulk of this bot into a sitting position.\nAfter a fair amount of sweat and muscle strain she mannaged to do so, \nslumping against the beasts chest for a moment to catch her breath.\nThe smell of the salve was strong in her nose before she sat up with a groan \nand a sigh, her tired and stressed muscles aching.\nZyber kept her hands on the beasts shoulders to make sure that he sat up, \nthen looked up into his face.*\n\n&quot; I rubbed...a salve into your chest. It&#39;s meant to clear your lungs and \nwake you up. And...I see...it worked.&quot;\n\n* She then gently pushed his shoulders back so that he could rest his back \nagainst the head-board of her bed, taking the strain off his muscles it took \nto keep him sitting up...and the strain off her shoulders that it took to \nkeep him from falling on her.*\n\n&quot; Relax. I am no harm to you.&quot;\n\n* Zyber then looked back towards the tea, then looked back towards the \nstrange creature.*\n\n&quot; Think you could drink something?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
