At least that&#39;s what Kluster had been doing,\nshooting from behind the shields.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::FireBlade::\n&gt; FireBlade got to the side of the CF and blasted the metal with a few\n&gt; more shots of his flame and a round part of the metal turned red\n&gt; hot...He covered the Flame thrower tip with hit tip of his 6 foot\nlong\n&gt; blade and jabbed it in and carved out a circle....He was in..He\nlooked\n&gt; up and saw that he was in a storage room...&quot;Nice place to enter&quot; he\n&gt; said to himself....\n\n\n"}}
