What was \nhe hiding? Tavatron sighed, no matter. When he was ready he would tell her. \nShe took a few steps, amazed at how thorough Dinobot&#39;s repair system had \nbeen. She&#39;d never experienced anything like it. It would have taken at least \na mega-cycle in the &#39;R chamber in order to repair her, though she most \nlikely wouldn&#39;t have survived without Dinobot&#39;s help.\n\nDinobot: &quot; Further more, the next time that you pull a stunt like that again \nI will personally skin you alive!&quot;\n\nTavatron turned to Dinobot, she was about to make some smart comment she \nwould soon regret, but then she stared into his optics again.

Tavatron smiled:\n\n&quot;Is that a promise?&quot; Tavatron placed a gentle hand on Dinobot&#39;s shoulder:\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I promise to never do anything like that again...&quot; Tavatron \nbent over and picked up her staff.
