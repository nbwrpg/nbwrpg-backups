She turned on the water and \nsplashed a little cold water on her face.  She smiled at her \nreflection in the mirror. Who knew how wonderful love could be, she \nthought. She turned around and saw Drillbit still asleep. She sighed \nand smiled. She walked over and kissed him on the lips.  She decided \nto leave him sleeping and very quietly walked out of her room.  she \nquietly shut the door behind her and walked out into the main room.  \nShe went over to the console.  She saw Wildfire and Megatron talking. \nWildfire looked hysterical.  She walked over to Wildfire and Megatron.\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s going on?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
