Megatron looks the\nDecepticons over, in triumph, then down at Motormaster, who is stirring.\n\nMotormaster strains to get to his feet. The fall had damaged his flight,\nand some more of his armor. He looks up at Megatron, then smiles widly.\n&quot;You,  You are our Megatron&quot; he says, with no doubt in his voice. &quot;I\nthought you were gone forever. My life, belongs to you, and the Decepticon\ndestiny Megatron. HAIL MEGATRON&quot; he shouts as loud as he can, and puts his\nfist up, signaling his choice of leaders.\n\nSpeedbreaker looks around, and follows suit, &quot;Hail Megatron&quot; as he\nduplicates Motormasters action, and is followed by Beastbox.\n\nSinnertwin looks at Hun-grr, &quot;What we do?&quot; he asks.\n\n\n\n"}}
