(ONLY with his cassettes. If anyone objects notify me.) \n&lt;Havotron is gone, and he has left us and the Constructicons \nbehind.&gt; Soundwave smiles, &lt;That means we stay with Lord \nMegatron.&gt; &quot;Rumble, Frenzy, Spasstik: Return.&quot; His chest opens \nup and Frenzy leaps up transforming into cassette mode and \nsliding in.\n\n\tBonecrusher looks at his fellow constructicons, mildly \nconfused, &quot;Uhh, so that means we are staying here? Cause I&#39;m \ngonna.&quot; He walks over to Hook. Looks at the damaged bot, and \nfrowns.\n\n&gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; &gt;|&lt; &lt;|&gt; \n\n\tSwitchblade twitches as two more missiles smash into the top \nof the ship. The armour was weakening, but could still sustain \nseveral more missile rounds. \n\t&quot;Uhh RAGNUS!&quot; Switchblade yells in the large bot&#39;s ear, \n&quot;You&#39;ve gotta get those jets off our back, and fast.&quot; Not waiting for \nan answer, he manually controls the autoguns and missiles \nlauncher, firing off a successful thirty bullets, and two missiles at \nthe attacking ship. \n\tNoting that the sensors pick up Astroblast&#39;s signature near by \non the Azores Islands, he opens a commlink to Astroblast. \n&quot;Astroblast, we&#39;ve got a bogey on our back side making passes \nwith missiles, and I&#39;m not sure how much longer we can hold out. \nGet your self over here and eliminate the enemy. I&#39;m trying to deter \nhim with the ship&#39;s defenses, but, well, I&#39;m not having much luck.&quot; \nSwitchblade sighs as he closes the commlink. Scanners indicate \nthat the ship is heading past the tip of Newfoundland this moment.\n\n\tAstroblast looks up as he receives the commlink, replying \nimmediately. &quot;All right, we can&#39;t lose the ship now, I&#39;ll be right \nover.&quot; He opens a commlink to Stratus. &quot;Stratus, the main base is \nunder attack and I&quot;m going over to mess up a bot, so you&#39;re in \ncharge of getting that ship down there to the surface. Abominus will \ntry to help.&quot; He chuckles, &quot;Astroblast out.&quot;\n\tThe moderately tall subcommander transforms into spaceship \nmode, and fires his rear and vertical thrusters at once, heading off \ntowards the Dark Avian. His scanners pick up the enemy quite \nquickly but he is too far away to engage.\n\n"}}
