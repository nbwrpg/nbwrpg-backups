However, the basic thing is that the storyline jumps forward in \ntime by one or two centuries. This doesn&#39;t mean that you lose your \ncharacters in a sort of restart; what it means is that Unicron, before \nleaving the place, locks down the chars present. They then wake up in a \nworld where things are radically different.\n\nOh, and thanks about the comment about it being well written! =)\n\n&gt;From: rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: OOC: NBW IMPORTANT\n&gt;Date: Mon, 30 May 2005 23:50:36 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;OOC: Well written, good job.  Does the name New Age mean that we&#39;re\n&gt;going with the time jump?  If so, are we creating new characters or\n&gt;just keeping the same ones?  This sounds like fun ^_^\n&gt;\n&gt;On 5/30/05, Airly &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Okey\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As some of your knows NBW will go to change a little its story line, and\n&gt; &gt; here&#39;s some ideas that Azure was working on. The plan is to keep ya \n&gt;update\n&gt; &gt; and choose the best course of action in order to cheer ups this RPG and\n&gt; &gt; upgrade it to next level. THis is one of several ideas that may appear \n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; all will be welcome to be heard. Also, it was suggested to change the \n&gt;name\n&gt; &gt; to Neo Beast War, New Age; but other titles will be considered too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s what Azure has wrote.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Neo Beast Wars: New Age\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Historical Facts\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   After Unicron left the periphery of the system, he left several \n&gt;sleeping\n&gt; &gt; Minions on the moon. He had realized that the energon present on Earth \n&gt;was\n&gt; &gt; too powerful for him to absorb right away, and had decided to keep a\n&gt; &gt; watchful eye on the planet until the crystals were ripe for his taking. \n&gt;With\n&gt; &gt; the Cybertronians out of his way, he went pleased with himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;             Yet before the Minions could awake, there came the wreckage \n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt; the Mephilis, a slaver ship. The crash on Earth caused the deaths of \n&gt;most of\n&gt; &gt; the slave drivers, and those who survived were met with the wrathful\n&gt; &gt; vengeance of the now free slaves. The slaves were from all known \n&gt;transformer\n&gt; &gt; factions and builds, a few even dating back to the era of the Great \n&gt;Wars.\n&gt; &gt; They all formed a loose society, agreeing that slavery was to be banned \n&gt;from\n&gt; &gt; their hearts, and punishable by death.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;             Fifteen years passed, and the Mephilis survivors were then\n&gt; &gt; joined by the crews of rescue ships that had finally managed to track \n&gt;them\n&gt; &gt; down. Contact was re-established with Cybertron, and colons started\n&gt; &gt; arriving, forming high-tech cities that were designed to ensure a \n&gt;central\n&gt; &gt; government on the planet. Industry and economy were bustling, and \n&gt;everybody\n&gt; &gt; was happy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;             Or rather, they would have been. The Minions awoke and soon, \n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; sort of Cold War was raging between the Unicronians and the \n&gt;Cybertronians,\n&gt; &gt; but also between the Cybertronians themselves. Old hatred died hard, and \n&gt;in\n&gt; &gt; this case, they even resurrected. The Maximals and Predacons emerged \n&gt;from\n&gt; &gt; the colonies and mistrust became rampant. Yet, some felt that it was \n&gt;their\n&gt; &gt; duties to make sure the Minions were being watched. Some, no matter \n&gt;their\n&gt; &gt; personal allegiance, collaborated and formed the Watchers, keeping the\n&gt; &gt; Unicronians in check while others were embarking on a power trip.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Cities and Locations\n&gt; &gt; Olympus Complex: The military heart of the planet. Army training \n&gt;facilities\n&gt; &gt; are located there and most weaponry is available from that city. It is\n&gt; &gt; located inside a tall mountain, with its higher rises coming out of the\n&gt; &gt; rocky top. Most military leaders come from there, such as Lord Jotunn,\n&gt; &gt; leader of the Iron Skulls Predacons. Minions are to be shot on sight in\n&gt; &gt; Olympus Complex.\n&gt; &gt; Atlantis: Located on an ancient island, this city is made up of tall \n&gt;towers\n&gt; &gt; and labs where science and knowledge reign supreme. It is the testing \n&gt;ground\n&gt; &gt; of experimental technologies. Pacificus Maximals are strong there, with \n&gt;Lord\n&gt; &gt; Perseus leading them. Violence in Atlantis results in immediate \n&gt;banishment\n&gt; &gt; from the city.\n&gt; &gt; Valley Mine Pentatron: As its name implies, this city is a mining city \n&gt;where\n&gt; &gt; much of the planet&#39;s workforce reside. It is also one of the most \n&gt;industrial\n&gt; &gt; cities in the world, and one of the most culturally universal. At the \n&gt;same\n&gt; &gt; time, shady business is frequent and law enforcement is not one of the\n&gt; &gt; priorities. Lord Spire, leader of the Bushido Predacons, holds her \n&gt;offices\n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; Cryonosis: This is the Antarctic base of the Watchers. It is loaded with\n&gt; &gt; up-to-the-minute stealth and surveillance technology. Not many dwell \n&gt;there,\n&gt; &gt; as it is the most environmentally hazardous city, but there are enough\n&gt; &gt; people to make Lord Elder, Watcher leader, proud of his achievements. \n&gt;Giving\n&gt; &gt; in to faction struggles there can result in jailing.\n&gt; &gt; Relay: If the world has a center, this is it. A city in the sky, Relay \n&gt;is\n&gt; &gt; where the lords meet and vote, where the Central Government is seated \n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; where the corporations are based. Trade is made from there, and\n&gt; &gt; transportations and communications are developed there. Lord Razorwing,\n&gt; &gt; leader of the Silver Wings Maximals, is based there. Being found guilty \n&gt;of\n&gt; &gt; corruption in Relay is punishable by public execution.\n&gt; &gt; Orbital Factories: These are the center of production for the planet.\n&gt; &gt; Searing Eye Base: Rumors say that the Minions are building a base on the\n&gt; &gt; moon, a tribute to Unicron himself. Nothing is known for sure about it, \n&gt;but\n&gt; &gt; red reflections can be seen from the natural satellite at nightï¿½\n&gt; &gt;  Factions and Groups\n&gt; &gt; Bushido Predacons: In the spirit of the warrior&#39;s way, these Predacons\n&gt; &gt; believe that preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for the\n&gt; &gt; little while they still have before the Minions start an all-out war.\n&gt; &gt; Leader: Spire.\n&gt; &gt; Iron Skulls Predacons: These Predacons think and proclaim loudly that \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals are weak and that they will bring destruction on everybody when \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; Minions act. They would rather take over the lead from the Maximals and \n&gt;act\n&gt; &gt; right now. Leader: Jotunn.\n&gt; &gt; Pacificus Maximals: The Pacificus preach that peace is the only way\n&gt; &gt; everybody can focus on the efforts against the Minions. Leader: Perseus.\n&gt; &gt; Silver Wings Maximals: The Silver Wings are convinced that the Predacons \n&gt;are\n&gt; &gt; preparing a revolution and that they want to prepare a strike against \n&gt;them.\n&gt; &gt; They think they should take them all out before things get rough. \n&gt;Leader:\n&gt; &gt; Razorwing.\n&gt; &gt; The Watchers: The Watchers are dedicated to the monitoring of the \n&gt;Minions.\n&gt; &gt; They are crafty and swift, and they are renowned Minion-killers at \n&gt;times.\n&gt; &gt; Their skills also include diplomacy, however, as members of any factions \n&gt;can\n&gt; &gt; join the Watchers. Leader: Elder.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
