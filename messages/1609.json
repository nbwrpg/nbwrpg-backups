Also, there was no \npossible way of your chars going through that far without severe moding on \nyour part. But as KSLawdogg pointed out, if RgDaN modes, it doesn&#39;t mean you \ncan mode. He has been spoken to, and is almost as close as you to being \nmoderated. You can play out your storylines as long as they arn&#39;t filled with \nmoding. So stop arguing and start RPGing. If you have further arguments, send \nthem to me.\n\n"}}
