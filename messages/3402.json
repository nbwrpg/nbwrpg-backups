The last thing they wanted was to\n&gt; start something. Ramulas Had told them this was\n&gt; prehistoric earth, and was going to show them there\n&gt; lodgings when a blast rattled the ship, and He left\n&gt; them with Dracona. They were confused. Snow Tech\n&gt; turned to Dracona,*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; Does every one come and go this way?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * A sudden screech distracted the bots once more as a\n&gt; female raptor/bot ran down the hall, followed by an\n&gt; exact copy, but male. As the male bot walked by,\n&gt; Shadow Cat tilted her head and stared at him,*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; Nice tail.&quot; *she breathed, to no one in\n&gt; particular.*\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Snow Tech Smiled to his sister, as she watched the\n&gt; bot pass,*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; Jezze, and you said i wuz bad!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Shadow Cat glared at him, and made a rude gesture\n&gt; at him. She composed herself and kicked him in the\n&gt; shin when he began to snicker. She looked at Dracona\n&gt; and said,*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; of all the sparks in the universe i had to get the\n&gt; dumbest ass-hole for a brother. and, giving Snow Tech\n&gt; an extra mean glare, started to walk after Dinobot.\n&gt; Snow Tech giggled and followed, winking at Dracona.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
