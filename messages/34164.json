His rear rockets \n&gt; fire, incinerating several shrubs and charring a tree behind him, as \n&gt; he moves forward. Slowly at first, Astroblast gains speed and \n&gt; momentum quickly, putting distance between himself and the trees \n&gt; below. He head towards the CF, and Megatron&#39;s location, reveling \n&gt; at the chance to help Maximals and their allies to their matrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Dead-End fly&#39;s past Skyscream, and lands on the ground, he \n&gt; groans. His eyes widden as he spots the impending doom. He \n&gt; quickly rolls to the side as two shells crash beside him. He rolls \n&gt; into a rock. Not a big rock, but a rock large enough to stop him \n&gt; from rolling. The third shell replaces Dead-End&#39;s arm, and some of \n&gt; his side armour, with a tangled mesh of mechafluid and wires. He \n&gt; groans, &quot;Ughh, dangnabit....&quot; He tries to get up without much \n&gt; success.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Drag Strip continues up to Incarcinator, continuing his plasma fire. \n&gt; &quot;Wildrider, join the party,&quot; he yells without looking. \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade continues work on Speedbreaker. He smiles at his \n&gt; clever disguise; the sparks coming from the laser look like the \n&gt; sparks that would come from a damaged robot, and him being \n&gt; cloaked leaves it looking like a wreck on the ground. &quot;Just wait \n&gt; Speedbreaker, you&#39;ll be up soon,&quot; he says quietly, mostly to \n&gt; himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 8 May 2001, at 18:32, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, every post sent by Scorpius, has a date on it before he\n&gt; &gt; quit.

(Just imagine they never appeared:))\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; Megatron opens up his comm-link. &quot;Astroblast, get here amediately.\nYou\n&gt; &gt; will be needed for phase two of my plan&quot; he finishes, as his\n&gt; &gt; voicepiece contracts. He smiles a twisted expression, as his eyes\n&gt; &gt; begin to glow red. &quot;Switchblade, get Speedbreaker fixed. He will\nbe\n&gt; &gt; needed for my future plans&quot;. Megatron then looks at Triggerhappy,\n&gt; &gt; Scourge, and Cyclonus. &quot;Transform my Decepticons, and ATTACK&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; yells, poiting at the Element. &quot;Nightstrike, follow their flank,\nand\n&gt; &gt; listen to Cyclonus. Motormaster, continue the plan. Skullgrin&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; yells reffering to the Pretender. &quot;Receive&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Megatron then jumps straight up into the air, and starts a back\nflip.\n&gt; &gt; As he does, he starts to fold in on himself, and shrink,\ntransforming\n&gt; &gt; into his gun mode. He then falls towards Skullgrin, waiting for\nhim to\n&gt; &gt; catch him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Motormaster walks up towards Speedbreaker, to inspect the damage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wildrider continues to fall, and gracefully just misses the\nshells, as\n&gt; &gt; he was keeping his eyes on Incarcinerator. He looks towards\nShockwave,\n&gt; &gt; and starts to laugh. &quot;Commander Shockwave.
