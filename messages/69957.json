I - don&#39;t think anyone else would have risked their life like y=\r\nou \nhad, for me. A piece of &quot; Old Junk&quot; as Nightstrike put it.. After that,=\r\n you \nstuck by me when you didn&#39;t have to. That meant quite a bit to me Tal=\r\non. It \nstill does. And now, in more ways than one.. I - meant what I said,=\r\n you&#39;re more \nbeautiful than I ever imagined before I could see what you lo=\r\noked like.

And \nI&#39;d be honored if you could continue to be beside =\r\nme not only in battle, but \ncompanionship.&lt;WBR&gt;&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He remem=\r\nbered an artifact, a tiny \nartifact that he had found on Atlantis. A compas=\r\ns, which he was able to restore \nsimply by feel alone. The compass also hel=\r\nd a tiny pearl inside, as part of its \ndecoration. He takes it out of his s=\r\nubspaced gauntlet, and presents it to \nTalon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot; Now I know=\r\n why I held onto this for so long. Before I \nleft Atlantis, I was working o=\r\nn restoring this artifact. It&#39;s nothing large, \nbut, I know it&#39;s valuable. =\r\nI&#39;d like you to have this.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \npearl sparkles as lights =\r\ntouch it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Kraftlos \n&lt;kraftlos@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;That will be fine.
