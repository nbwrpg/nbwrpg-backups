Legacy&#39;s lucky Tucson hasn&#39;t explo=\r\nded on him yet.&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises a brow.\n\n&quot; If legacy keeps oversteppin=\r\ng his boundaries, it will happen.  You should&#39;ve heard him raise his voice =\r\njust now, Kup.. Could swear the entire ark was vibrating due to the level o=\r\nf his voice.&quot;\n\nUproar now wakes up, scratching behind his head.\n\n&quot;Is that w=\r\nhat that vibration was all about? I thought it was another quake.  Okay so =\r\nwhat did Legacy do ta deserve another shout match with Tucson?&quot;\n\nQuickstrid=\r\ne looks back to him.\n\n&quot;The usual, he tried to go against Tucson&#39;s orders.  =\r\nAnd you know what happens if we disrespect a Prime, right?&quot;\n\nUproar nodds.\n=\r\n\n&quot;Ohh yeah, that&#39;s why I would never dare ta do anything like that, noooo w=\r\naaaay, especially with Tucson. As far as I&#39;m concerned, like Rodimus, what =\r\nhe says, goes.  Legacy better watch his step, that&#39;s two strikes against hi=\r\nm now.

He did not like his tone of voice, and\n&gt; &gt; felt =\r\nthat his explanation could have been a little less brash. Especially\n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nen you&#39;re addressing a Prime officer. His expression hardens quickly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot; I appreciate your concerns but I do NOT appreciate your tone of voice!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s as if you&#39;re trying to stop me from doing what needs to be done! =\r\nThis\n&gt; &gt; war can not be fought by ourselves, they out number us!

It was his way of\n&gt; &gt; saying that in desperate times,=\r\n desperate measures can not be avoided. \n&gt; &gt; Even\n&gt; &gt; if the balance of tim=\r\ne does get disrupted.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Exactly. We need help, a=\r\nnd maybe it isn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime,\n&gt; &gt; but we must try and re=\r\nvive others to assist us in battle. Legacy, I warn\n&gt; &gt; you now, insubordina=\r\ntion will not be tolerated. Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy st=\r\nood his ground, his stance not aggressive but simply solid\n&gt; and ready as h=\r\ne watched Tuscon. If Legacy had any fear of Tuscon or\n&gt; the power that he p=\r\nossessed or the anger that may be unleashed there\n&gt; was not a hint of it on=\r\n Legacy&#39;s face or demeanor. Neither was there\n&gt; any hint of it in his next =\r\nstatement. &quot;Your rank and objectives are\n&gt; duly noted and are at this junct=\r\nure irrelevant.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy&#39;s words are completely devoid of anger, aggres=\r\nsion and tact.\n&gt; They are instead just simple statements of fact as he sees=\r\n them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Legacy what are you doing?&quot; A voice rippled across the room =\r\n=96 LORD\n&gt; ELDER! &quot;You can&#39;t stand against a Prime!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am a temporal =\r\nguardian sent back to insure that all things unfold\n&gt; as they should and I =\r\nwill stand against any force that would attempt\n&gt; to disrupt that.&quot; Legacy =\r\nfolded his arms behind his back, which had\n&gt; the affect of focusing his wea=\r\npons away from Tuscon. There was still\n&gt; no hint of aggression in his tone =\r\nor stance, and for a bot as\n&gt; powerfully built as Legacy that was a difficu=\r\nlt task. Legacy was tall\n&gt; and sturdily built and he was, except for his co=\r\nlor, was an exact\n&gt; `physical&#39; replica of Shockblast; He bore a cannon on o=\r\nne hand and the\n&gt; other hand that WAS a cannon and he possessed a remorsele=\r\nss\n&gt; unflinching cyclopean gaze with which he was currently directing at\n&gt; =\r\nTuscon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder, who looked startlingly bigger and more robust stepped i=\r\nnto the\n&gt; room, walking to stand between Legacy and Tuscon. &quot;I am not talki=\r\nng\n&gt; about COMBAT.&quot; He said looking at the tall form of Legacy, &quot;I am\n&gt; tal=\r\nking about respect, chain of command, duty, honor, the things we\n&gt; Maximals=\r\n stand for.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy looked down at Lord Elder, his single optic pulsin=\r\ng\n&gt; thoughtfully, &quot;Your emotional adherence to respect is inefficient, I\n&gt; =\r\ncould not allow any disturbance to the Autobots and Decepticons that\n&gt; lay =\r\nhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder patted Legacy on the shoulder, having to reach up sl=\r\nightly\n&gt; to do so. &quot;I know Legacy, I know, but it is what makes us differen=\r\nt\n&gt; from the predacons.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy paused obviously not agreeing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor looked at tucson and said coldy &quot;that&#39;s a strategy =\r\nthat we \n&gt; &gt; cannot\n&gt; &gt; afford, but&quot;he added with another tone&quot;We can ask t=\r\no pacificus Maximals to\n&gt; &gt; join us... and fuse both factions, that will gi=\r\nve us enough streght to \n&gt; &gt; face\n&gt; &gt; hydras and whoever dares to challenge=\r\n us... By now we must to find a way \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; protect the ark&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder nodded as he turned to Perceptor and the others, &quot;Yes!=\r\n We\n&gt; can attempt to bring in others help us.&quot; Lord Elder glanced between\n&gt;=\r\n Tuscon and Legacy hoping that Tuscon would catch the hint, you can&#39;t\n&gt; bro=\r\nw beat Legacy, you have to reason with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson ack=\r\nnlowedges Perceptor but still holds a rather cold expression on \n&gt; &gt; his fa=\r\nce, which was mostly meant for Legacy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Very well Perceptor, I will=\r\n hold off until we are able to contact the \n&gt; &gt; Pacificus Maximals. If we c=\r\nan not reach them, then we might have to resort \n&gt; &gt; to other measures.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy appears unaffected by Tuscon&#39;s cold glance, however th=\r\ne shield\n&gt; that was over Optimus Prime dropped. Lord Elder just shook his h=\r\nead as\n&gt; he stepped out from between them breathing an audiable sigh of rel=\r\nief,\n&gt; hopefully the disaster has been averted for the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Without further word, Tucson quietly walks over to the body of Opt=\r\nimus \n&gt; &gt; Prime, and just stands beside him. It would appear that Straight =\r\nShot was \n&gt; &gt; right. He had learned so much, but missed the opportunity to =\r\nlearn the \n&gt; &gt; wisdom he feared he was missing. He kneels in front of the s=\r\nleeping \n&gt; &gt; Autobot Commander.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Once again I almost made a costly=\r\n mistake. I learned so much from my \n&gt; &gt; comrades and I&#39;m grateful for the =\r\nknowledge they&#39;ve given me, but still, \n&gt; &gt; Optimus, I wish I could have le=\r\narned your wisdom. I could really use it \n&gt; &gt; now. So much happening at onc=\r\ne and I don&#39;t know where to begin doing \n&gt; &gt; something about it. I should k=\r\nnow these things by now, that&#39;s why I was \n&gt; &gt; given the power of leadershi=\r\np. I can&#39;t let them down, not this time. My \n&gt; &gt; comrades have seen enough =\r\ngrief, they don&#39;t need any more of it. Now I \n&gt; &gt; wish we did have time to =\r\nwork together, one on one. That way I would be \n&gt; &gt; prepared for what comes=\r\n next.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy said nothing as Tuscon turned away and began=\r\n talking with\n&gt; Optimus Prime. After noting Tuscon&#39;s actions Legacy also tu=\r\nrned and\n&gt; walked away, seemingly harboring no ill will for Tuscon, his onl=\r\ny goal\n&gt; the protection of the Ark and most notably the current time stream=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; [MEANWHILE IN THE MEDBAY]\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus sat over his wife as she seem=\r\ned to waken . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightligh tried to make a big sfort to sit down bu=\r\nt her energy\n&gt; &gt; levels, on purpose, were to low for that, she stopped too =\r\nweak to\n&gt; &gt; move and said &quot;Rodimus...
