Two missiles explode against its rear, sending\nit flipping through the air till it regains stability and scans behind\nitself.\n\nAn identified object was right on its tail, firing madly. The object\nwas an enlongated spheare, with engines on the back and weapons all\nover.\n\n&quot;Get this gun off me!&quot; Supernova says over the comm to the Vicyr/Flare\njet. The cloaked jet recieves the orders and flies up behind the\nsphere, firing two missiles.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAutofire swirls in the air, easily avoiding the two missiles. His\nscanners get to work on locating the cloaked jet behind him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Composer/Surgital::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Composer does a few acrobatic moves in the air and dodges both\nof the lazer shots from Autofire.  Composer looked at the gestalt.  He\nfired 2 plasma shots at Surgital&#39;s forehead.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;     Surgital quickly sees the missiles and charges from the Galactor\njets coming at him, and puts the arm that is Explobody in front of him\nto block, as Explobody was the most durable Bodicon.  Surgital&#39;s arm\ntakes the damage, and takes it pretty badly, but is still intact and\nfunctional.  Then, out of nowhere, Surgital is hit dead on in the\nforehead by plasma shots, and stumbles back, then his gigantic body\nfalls backwards down on the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;YOUCH!&quot; Surgital yelped in pain, pulling his body back up onto\nits feet and vigorously rubbing his back.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Decepticons, I say we work on their shields!  But first,\nrevenge!&quot; Surgital&#39;s voice boomed over the battlefield.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Surgital lifted up the leg that was Legtrap, then bent it so his\nknee was &quot;aiming&quot; at Composer.  Then, his knee plate opened up and\nfired out a big, energon net at Composer.  He then stomped his foot\nback on the ground.  Surgital&#39;s hand converted into a spinning saw\nblade again and he turned around and attempted to cut one or both of\nthe Galactor jets.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;      Composer got caught in the massive net.  When it wrapped around\nhis body, it brought him down to the ground like a rock.  He struggled\nto get out.  The net was made of energon, and everytime he touched it\nhe was being exposed to high levels of energon which was over the\nsafety limit.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Wheeljack!  Somebody!  Gemme outta here!&quot; Composer cried for\nhelp.\n\n\n"}}
