Leave me alone!!&quot;\n\n* With that she sank away from him and scurried over to the nearest corner,\nleaving a trail of fluid in her wake.\nBrightBlade came to the corner and turned towards the three Maximals again,\ngiving them a wide eyes look as well as one of slight fear. Perhaps she\ncould play their compassion towards her benefit.\nShe pressed her back against the corner as hard as she could, giving the\nimpression that she was afraid of them to the point that she didn&#39;t want to\nbe near them.\nThrough the corner of her eye she saw Smokescreen poke his head into the\nroom, snapping her head towards him in mock surprise and then turning her\nexpression from surprise to pleading.\nHer shivering got worse but that was not fake, her temp dropping fact.\nShe looked towards Smokescreen with wide and pleading eyes, but not making\nit obvious that she was faking every bit of it.\nShe made a small reach towards him with a quick glance towards the other\nthree Maximals to appear like she was truly afraid of them. Then looking\nback towards Smokescreen, her voice a sob.*\n\n&quot; Please.don&#39;t let them hurt me anymore.&quot;\n\n* She cupped her hand to her chest and found it soaked with fluid before she\neven knew it, making her seem as if she was as timid as a child and just as\nafraid. Moving towards Smokescreen slightly with a small whimper, and\nactually mustering a few tears to fall down her cheeks as she reached out to\nhim again. Shaking and shivering, fluid covered and scared.\nShe would play the Maximals compassion for all it was worth, and if she\ndidn&#39;t seem completely helpless now then she didn&#39;t know what was.\nBut it was all an act, besides the wounds and the shivering.\nThough, it was impossible to know the difference.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
