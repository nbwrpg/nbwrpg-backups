The journey was long\n&gt;enough, and now they couldnt find the new bot.\n&gt;     Paralysis shrugged. He didnt see anything. Walking around the clearing \n&gt;he\n&gt;made sure no one else was around.\n&gt;     Then, Black Aracnia stumbled apon the empty stasis pod, and the tracks \n&gt;of\n&gt;the Allience members who stole the warrior. &quot;What?! What?! No! No! No!&quot;\n&gt;     Her fit of rage cause the birds to scatter, and a few deer to gallop\n&gt;away. She stomped the ground and, basically, threw a tantrum.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, Commander. Im sure that the bot wasnt worth it anyways.&quot; \n&gt;Paralysis\n&gt;said, unknowing it would direct her rage towrds him.\n&gt;     &quot;Shut up wart face! Lets just go home! Those damn Allience Members! \n&gt;Who\n&gt;do they think they are? The Beast Wars peace keepers or something? Argh!\n&gt;Return to base, now!&quot; She screamed.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
