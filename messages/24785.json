A tank mode. He was known as \nthe Duke of destruction. Second in command to Galvatron back on that dreaded \nplanet. When his brother had been rebuilt his signal had benn picked up by \nMegastrom. He had to use his skills to help Magma defend agaisnt this for. He \nturned into his tank mode and rolled off towards the ship.\n  Suddenly Galvatron&#39;s eyes glowed. &quot;I dont think so brother. I am here to \nhelp the destrons not to rule them. My goal is second in command and to be \nhis war general. That must be Apocalypse&#39;s ambition in me.  If you screw with \nme I will set off that destruct meckanizim I installed on you. Did you think \nI forgot?&quot; he pulled out from the mind channel and returned to concertartion \non the bots. Megastorm reached the destron base. &quot;I am here to help you. Me \nand my brother Galvatron are here to win this war for you. He is off \nfinishing his work.&quot;\n\n"}}
