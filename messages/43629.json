He gets upset again.\n\nMutate(it&#39;s shorter): No Friend. NO FRIEND!\n\nHe trys to send out energy waves but fails and even with his low \nintellegence vaguely reconizies that the he only absorbed a little of \nthe lightning and is low on power.  Still, he starts flying toward \ncentral Africa.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; Transmutate flys over the original Maximal base. Or at least where \nit \n&gt; was. He gets a sad look on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Transmutate: No friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he begins to think that maybe they made friend with the Preds \nand \n&gt; goes to see their base (I can&#39;t remember if he ever went to the Pred \n&gt; base but I can asume that Ravage told him about it).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He shouldn&#39;t be functional, but he is. Still, he looked like a \npile \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; junk.  When Transmutate started to go offline he saw a light.  In \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; light stood many transformers.  Unicron, Optimus Prime, many \nothers \n&gt; &gt; whose names have long been forgotten, others who have not yet gone \n&gt; &gt; online.  They were all heros from 1 generation or another.  They \nall \n&gt; &gt; spoke the same simultanius sentence.\n&gt; &gt; Spirits: Transmutate. Your destiny has not been fulfilled.\n&gt; &gt; He lacked the intellegence to know who they were or understand \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; they meant, but still he did.  Suddenly, he was back in his body, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; spead throughout the segmeants that had been blown apart.  He \nwaited \n&gt; &gt; for this destiny to come, but it failed.  His spark no longer had \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; power it once did, he had no power at all.  His body was useless \nto \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is stormy (you wanted to incorparate the weather didn&#39;t you).  \n&gt; All \n&gt; &gt; of a sudden a lightening bolt hits his hand.  It comes to life and \n&gt; &gt; attaches to his arm.  It continues to assemble Transmutate. He \n&gt; starts \n&gt; &gt; talking when it&#39;s finished.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Transmutate: Friend....Sil-ver-bolt.....Ra-vage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He gets a sad look.  Then he smiles stupidly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Transmutate:  Find.....Flllllllly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He flys up in the air.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Don&#39;t start complaining.  Transmutate was in one episonde of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; series.  He befriended Ravage and Silverbolt, but he hated \nfighting \n&gt; &gt; so much that when they started firing at each other he jumped in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; way of the blast and cancelled it out.  He had enormous power, but \n&gt; no \n&gt; &gt; way to control it.  When ever he attacked someone his energy just \n&gt; flew \n&gt; &gt; out in all directions. He was so badly damaged his intellegence \nwas \n&gt; &gt; barley that of a drone (Rhinox confirmed this), and I have big \nplans \n&gt; &gt; for him o.k. and a way to bring up his intellegence.\n\n\n"}}
