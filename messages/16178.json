As \nlong as he was seeing floating hands, he might as well shake them.\n\nStretching out his hand, Zardus grasps Sickle, shaking him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nChordate fired one more shot at Skulletron before stopping. He mutters an \norder, and the autoguns stop firing, the panels lifting from the computer \nequipment.\n\n&quot;Take him to the brig.
