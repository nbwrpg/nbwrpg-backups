It was like a hormone that set the being off from him, the scent of it clearly distinguishing it from him...and he knew exactly what it was. This new bot, the one who almost seemed to be imitating him...was a female.\nDinobot growled deeply in the back of his throat as he took a step towards the stranger and away from the door after looking towards Tavatron with puzzlement,but then noticing Striker come between the stranger and himself with a question that he was wondering at the same moment.\nHe looked at Striker but then locked his optic on the new bot, even his laser guiding system ready to target the stranger if needed. His muscles were tense and his aggression was rising, he didn&#39;t like the fact that there was a female bot trying to seem like him.\nHe snarled.*\n\n&quot; Yes, explain.&quot;\n\n* He looked over to Cyber Claw with his optics narrowed and his tail thrashing, he would like to hear what she had to say for herself because he knew that once he exposed her feminine origins she would have no place for error. But for now he wanted to hear what this new bot had to say, wanted to see what sort of lie she would make up to almost make him seem like he wasn&#39;t who he really was.\nDinobot crossed his arms but his tail continued to thrash,*\n\n&quot; This may prove most interesting.&quot;\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
