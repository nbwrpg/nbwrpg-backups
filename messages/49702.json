The way I saw it was that the weapon could send a bot to \nstasis lock in no time. We&#39;d like to keep this rpg as fair to everyone \nas possible.

He&#39;s not a moderator just so he can stand \naround \n&gt; &gt; and look pretty. Moderators are to be listened too, that way \n&gt; &gt; mistakes or misconceptions can be picked up and fixed before \n&gt; &gt; anything disasterous happens (we hope anyway). =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Whoah, way to point your finger in the wrong direction.  The only \n&gt; posts I made that had anything to do with the battle in the last \n&gt; couple of days were to clarify the weapon&#39;s function.  It&#39;s not like \n&gt; I kept shooting!  Jeez, just because you&#39;re a mod doesn&#39;t mean you \n&gt; automatically know everything about a weapon someone else designed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not here to stand around and look pretty either.  If anyone \nneeds \n&gt; an attitude change, it&#39;s the people who expect the new guy to not \n&gt; know shit about how RPGs work.  I&#39;ve had a ton of writing and \n&gt; roleplaying experience, thank you very much, and I know what I&#39;m \n&gt; doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; You ought to be a little more prepared for those who show up with a \n&gt; slew of ideas ready beforehand.  I&#39;m not saying all my ideas should \n&gt; go through, I&#39;m saying I have them ready for when there&#39;s an \nopening.\n\n\n"}}
