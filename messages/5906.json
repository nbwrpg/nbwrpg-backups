She dodged and swerved to miss the ice \nformations.  She was feeling fear again.  She rarely felt this emotion.  She \nfelt one other time.  That when Lunarpine scared her.  She shook her head.  \nShe had to think straight in order to keep ahead of this predacon trying to \nkill her. How did he track me, she thought. She knew she had done a good job \nof hiding her scent and flying out of most scanner ranges.  But somehow, \nthis pred found her.  She flew up into the sky.  The wind had picked up and \nwas blowing harder than before.  The north to south wind was cold and \nstrong.  She had an urge to fly back to the Maximal base.  she started to \nfly in that direction and then stopped.  She knew that she couldn&#39;t go back. \nHer spark fell for a moment as she hovered and looked to the south. She flew \nWestward, hoping to evade the Pred.  She beat her wings as fast as they \nwould go.\nShe was breathing hard now and she sould see her breath as she flew.  A gust \nof wind caught her and she tumbled a bit in the air.  She regained her \ncontrol and kept flying.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
