What I have done is opened us up to wh=\r\nat would normally be an OOC meeting, where we would all get together and di=\r\nscuss the future of the game, however I have elected to do it ICly. \n\nI kno=\r\nw most poeple who are or have been active possesed at least one bot charact=\r\ner. If you want to join in, feel free to insert your character and make a f=\r\new comments. If you have only ever had Pred/Con characters, feel free to ma=\r\nke use of a temporary Max/Bot character for the purpose of the meeting. \n\nI=\r\n am encouraging everyone who wants to to get involved in what is going on, =\r\nhave a say in what will happen next. I have a few changes in mind, most of =\r\nwhich were addressed in the opening post. But if you have any comments that=\r\n can be addressed ICly feel free to drop in. If you feel they can&#39;t feel fr=\r\nee to drop them on me off list. If you are someone who has never posted, pl=\r\nease come to me first and let me know what you intend. \n\nWhat I am doing wi=\r\nll not be something that wil be resolved over night. IE: if we resolve to s=\r\ntart attacking the Unicronians, that does not mean that next week the battl=\r\ne will be won and the game over. At the moment we are looking at what will =\r\nbe the general thrust of the game as we go forward, and as far as I am conc=\r\nerned, anyone who is active or wants to be is entitled to a say. \n\nCome one=\r\n, come all, feel free to post in. I look forward to seeing all IC. \n\nThere =\r\nis no need to comment directly to this post, unless you really want to. :)\n=\r\n\nFeel free to re-enter the game! The door is open! \n\n- Preston\n\n\n"}}
