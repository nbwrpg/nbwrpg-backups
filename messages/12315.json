All the people! Well, now I&#39;m definitely gonna\n&gt; have to make one. It will take place on Cybertron&#39;s\n&gt; present, and I have no problems with transferring\n&gt; characters from NBW to NBM or back, so feel free to\n&gt; bring your characters, but don&#39;t abandon this great\n&gt; RPG!! BTW Magmatron is going to kinda take\n&gt; Megatron&#39;s place on Cybertron, he will get control\n&gt; of a large area of the planet, but not all. And the\n&gt; forces will be Maximal, Predacon, Destron, and\n&gt; Other)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Upon returning to his base he decided to set up\n&gt; some charges in the mountain to move the ship. He\n&gt; sent robotics teams to plant these bombs.\n&gt;     &quot;All Destron forces, return to base emidetally,&quot;\n&gt; He commanded. &quot;Minor explosives will be detonating\n&gt; shortly, I need to be closer to a ocean.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (This will also give a definite place for\n&gt; Magmatron&#39;s lair. I&#39;ve also gotta make a Drake\n&gt; Magmatron figure, gotta get BM Megs for that)\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
