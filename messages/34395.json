The first system&#39;s reactivity\n&gt; brought online the massive computer that was Ragnus.\n&gt; \n&gt; The behamoth rose slowly, as his joints had not been moved in many\n&gt; years.  Spreading his wings to thier full thirty two foot span his\n&gt; external sensors came online revealing to him the interior of the\n&gt; volcano.  Looking up at the mouth of the volcano he crouched low, then\n&gt; using his powerful legs, projected himself upwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he cleared the volcano&#39;s mouth he spread his wings once again, only\n&gt; this time with the lightning speed he knew he was capable of.  The\n&gt; escaping gases propelled his huge form upwards with great speed. \n&gt; Looking around he scanned for a fresh energy source.  Locating one a\n&gt; few miles to the south he set himself in that direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; The robotic Red Dragon that was known as Sagnus had finnally risen.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
