The autoguns from the base=\r\n peppered the skies, raking through the host dropping many from the skies! =\r\nEven as the combined firepower of the=A0defenders raged across them the swe=\r\neps moved out into a slightly wider arc, seperating so as not to present su=\r\nch an easy target. With one accord thier own disintergrator cannons opened =\r\nup, tearing into the earth below them as they targetted the base and the de=\r\nfenders!\nAs Jhiaxus moved in to dogfight the sweeps, his weapons burning in=\r\nto them, they quickly spin out of his way, thier movements quick and supple=\r\n as they manuvered. However as he moved forward he realized that it was not=\r\n the effectiveness of his weapons that gained him the advantage, but it was=\r\n the design of the sweeps! As they swung away from before him, they were cl=\r\nosing in behind him, boxing him in, thier powerful canons firing. \nJust as =\r\nthe sweeps were fulling closing the trap on Jhiaxus, a few of those to his =\r\nrear exploded and began falling from the skies as Myrmidon, now in starfigh=\r\nter mode caught up, his cannons cutting a swath of wreckage through the air=\r\n. &quot;I would not recommend seperating from the group.&quot; the 6-changer&#39;s voice =\r\ncut through the channels. &quot;There are so many of them, we could all be cut o=\r\nff. We need reinforcments!&quot; \nMyrmidon banked to the left and up slightly as=\r\n the sweeps tried to box him in also, with thier numbers, it was possible i=\r\nf they were not extremely careful!\n(OOC: In addition to the defenders, the =\r\nsweeps are definitely targetting the base, are thier weapons having any eff=\r\nect?)\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
