She let out a loud roar. She \nused her claws and ripped through the strapps.  She leaped from the \ntable and looked at Zardus. SHe transformed into bot mode. &quot;OK, I WAS \nin the forest walking with two other bot. And now I&#39;m standing here \ntalking to you. Care to fill in the peices?&quot; She spread her hand out \nand her claws sprang out showing 4 inch claws.

If the \nprogramming \n&gt; was successfull (which is up to you to say, Logo), she would follow \nhis every \n&gt; command, and serve the Alliance without fail. He had also \nprogrammed her to \n&gt; be a bit promiscuous, but not a slut like DevilDuer had asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; He taps his wrist comp, making sure the connection to the device he \nhad \n&gt; implanted, which would clear Feline&#39;s programming at his command, \nwas secure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus picks up the antidote to Reptilica&#39;s venom, injecting it \ninto Feline. \n&gt; He sits back, waiting for her to wake up.\n\n\n"}}
