In battle though, I have \n&gt; seen with my own eyes, the Allience shoot on us with the maximals at \n&gt; their side. They fight together. For the longest time, the predacons \n&gt; have been fighting amonst themselves and not getting together. Now \n&gt; that I have started to form a council made up of the predacon groups, \n&gt; we are finally getting things to that we can try to get then to see \n&gt; each other as enimies, not allies. But I need someone to go into the \n&gt; Maximal camp, and get the ball rolling as it were.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
