He was ready to dodge the blast, but he doubted Hovotron would fire. The yell from Domnijoe made his smile grow wider, but he glances annoyingly at Firestrike as the dissident spoke, then returning his gaze to Hovotron.\n\n&quot;Interesting faction you have. Who exactly did you say was the commander?&quot; Autofire asks, playing off of the uncertainty of the Constructicons and whatever was going on with the bot behind Hovotron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavenger looks around uncertainly. &quot;Um, I don&#39;t know about this, guys. Should we really disobey him?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Bonecrusher / Soundwave / Switchblade ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Bonecrusher growls, looking from the furious Havotron to the \n&gt; Contructicon leaders, Scrapper and Hook. &quot;I don&#39;t like it... \n&gt; Megatron would slag me...&quot; He shudders at the though, and \n&gt; prepares to dodge an attack from Havotron, muttering, &quot;As would \n&gt; Havotron likely...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave, from behind Havotron, regards the situation. &lt;&lt;It \n&gt; appears that Hook is to damaged to form Devastator. It also seems \n&gt; that there is some Constructicon discontent. Assessing the \n&gt; situation. . .  Havotron is loosing support rapidly, and will likely \n&gt; loose this encounter. Lord Megatron will be pleased to know of the \n&gt; return of the Constructicons, and Soundwave.&gt;&gt; Having decided \n&gt; Megatron was more fit to lead the decepticon forces to victory, he \n&gt; ejects several cassettes, &quot;Frenzy, Spasstik, Rumble: eject. \n&gt; Operation Dissention.&quot; He sends a silent command to his \n&gt; cassettes: &#39;Havotron will loose this encounter to Megatron&#39;s forces, \n&gt; the Constructicons, and us. On my signal, you will attack.&#39; \n&gt; Soundwave waits patiently for the Constructicons decide which \n&gt; side they will follow: Megatron&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade spins from display to display inside the control room \n&gt; of the Dark Avian, watching the happenings outside all the while. \n&gt; He notes that the power supplies are mostly depleted, and once \n&gt; the base is moved, there will have to be an energon search to \n&gt; make sure that the base will continue running, and not off of \n&gt; auxiliary power. One bot outside, he watches with more intrest \n&gt; than the others, his former partner, is Soundwave. He watches as \n&gt; three other cassettes are ejected, and he frowns, not sure whether \n&gt; to consider him and ally or an enemy. Arming the portable laser \n&gt; turrects, he prepares to use them, regardless of who gets in the \n&gt; way outside. He frowns even more as he considers the \n&gt; consequenses of the formation of Devastator, but manages to \n&gt; convince himself that his allies outside will probably be able to \n&gt; keep him busy for long enough to allow the ship to escape the area.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade fires the directional thrusters, and turns the ship \n&gt; around in the water of Hudson&#39;s Bay to face it&#39;s exit. The rear minor \n&gt; thrust boosters fire, without a significant push, but just enough to \n&gt; get the large ship moving. While tapping on the keys, he opens a \n&gt; private encrypted commlink to his Decepticon allies, &quot;Firestrike \n&gt; report the situation outside.&quot; He asks his loyal servant with a \n&gt; devious smile, &quot;Domnijoe, BlindChaos, and Blindchaos, follow \n&gt; Firestrike&#39;s lead, for now. Autofire, hold you position unless \n&gt; attacked, then destroy the enemy.&quot; Chuckling to himself, \n&gt; Switchblade keeps a vigilate eye on the controls to the ship, \n&gt; making sure he doesn&#39;t run into any shallow water.\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: lol, been a while since I last posted with Bonecrusher... well, \n&gt; since I last posted at all I guess. =) I&#39;ve got this bad feeling \n&gt; something in this post is incorrect... oh well. =P\n\n\n"}}
