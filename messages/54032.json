Things like fear and love are beyond him other than in small \n&gt; quantities.  His free arm comes up automatically to block the sword - \n&gt; which promptly becomes lodged in it.  Between that pain and the \n&gt; emotional overload, the shark-bot is driven into the Jaws-like \n&gt; behavior people would expect of his beast form.  With a roar, he \n&gt; latches onto Dreadplague&#39;s throat with an iron grip, fairly well \n&gt; wrenching the sword out of the femme&#39;s hands and exacerbating his own \n&gt; wound.  He headbutts his antagonist, twisting the harpoon lodged in \n&gt; her body so that it starts tearing through her internal systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noir narrowly avoids the shards and retaliates with her blasters.  \n&gt; Jayde proves to be an even harder target to pin down in vehicle mode \n&gt; than as a robot, and scoots under Tyreal as he jumps.
