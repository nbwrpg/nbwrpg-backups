It&#39;s not nearly as big \nas \n&gt; a battleship, but the latter would have a rough time fighting the \n&gt; former - Rogue Star bristles with assorted weaponry, not all of it \n&gt; Cybertronian in origin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Personally, I don&#39;t care about the rubber duck.  You&#39;ll see her, \nall \n&gt; right,&quot; she tells him, &quot;but she&#39;s staying right here until exactly \n&gt; half your ship&#39;s cargo is aboard Rogue Star.  Riekan!

She&#39;s a mess - she hasn&#39;t seen the inside of a CR chamber in \na \n&gt; long time.
