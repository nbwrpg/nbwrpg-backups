In the movie half of the Matrix was used to defeat Unicron. Then\nin\n&gt; The Return of Optimus Prime Optimus used the other half to destroy the\nhate\n&gt; plague that was causing all those affected to go insane and blasting those\n&gt; who weren&#39;t infected and infecting them. The shell of the Matrix was then\n&gt; used and destroyed in another episode of G1, the reason for doing so I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; recall but in G1 the matrix of leadership was eventually gone.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
