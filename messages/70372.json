Unfortunatel=\r\ny, now that Rodimus has been found, I&#39;ve lost my vision and this time, the =\r\nonly way it can be corrected is by hand.

She then looks to Legacy.\n\n&quot;Wait a sec, I have =\r\nan idea.  Legacy, what if we shot a cable up your way and you could secure =\r\nit to something solid?  I bet we could start getting some bots out of here =\r\nsafely by just creating some sort of winch like lever.&quot;\n\nQuick Stride scrat=\r\nches behind one ear.\n\n&quot; Hmmm, that&#39;s one heck of a climb, and we dunno if t=\r\nhere is anything solid that we can attatch it to.
