This day,\n&gt; in 1999,\n&gt; &gt; we began the epic story of the Neo Beasts Wars. Over time we have\n&gt; lost\n&gt; &gt; members, banished members, and gained members. Lets hope that this\n&gt; RPG will\n&gt; &gt; continue onward and get even more successful. As for the standout\n&gt; players, we\n&gt; &gt; will be giving out awards in the near future when we get around to\n&gt; analyze\n&gt; &gt; some posts. In the meantime, keep up the RPing!\n&gt; &gt; -JP\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
