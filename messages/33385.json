He stops behind a hill, to give \nhim cover fire from anything, and transforms, flexing his large arms, \nthen ajusts his gun. &quot;Lets rip this place up Stunticons&quot; his doom \nfilled voice echoes, as he leans onto the hill, and plants his Cyclone \ngun down, waiting for more to arrive. &quot;Triggerhappy and Skullgrin come \nto our positions&quot; he commands.\n\nSpeedbreaker follows transforming, and getting beside Motormaster. He \nalso plants down, and waites.\n\n\n\n"}}
