Veratis brought you \nhere for a reason. I am not sure what that reason is, but it must be \ngood if he wanted you here. You showed yourself to be a good warrior. \nI shall be honored to fight along side you.&quot;\n\nShe looked as FoxFingers stormed off. She chuckled. &quot;Lunarpine, must \nyou tease him so? After all, he&#39;s only a little guy. We have to help \nprotect him.&quot;  She walked over and transformed into bot mode. She \nleaned down and kissed Lunarpine on the cheek. &quot;I&#39;d have done the \nsame for you, you know. And thank you for letting me fight on this \none. It felt good to &#39;stretch my wings again&#39;, so to speak.&quot;\nShe smiled warmly at him.\n\nShe turned to Veratis.&quot;Class? What class?
