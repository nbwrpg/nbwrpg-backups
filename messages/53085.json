My email has been jecked up. \nEverytime I open Outlook Express is stops responding and feezes up \nwhen it starts to download my mail. So I havn&#39;t been able to send or \nrecieve email. I&#39;m sending this one through the post feature on the \nYahoo Groups NBW site. I&#39;m going to post for all my Chars and try to \ntsya with everything. I doubt that I&#39;ll post as much though. \nHopefully I&#39;ll get my mail working again, soon.\n\nIC:\n:: Rodimus Prime ::\n\nRodimus was tired after the battle and overseeing the repair. Ultra \nMagnus hadn&#39;t answered him so he decided to go rest a bit. On his way \ninto the base he runs into Nightlight.\n\nRodimus Prime: Hey honey. I&#39;m going to get some shut eye.\n\nHe pulled her to him, and put his around her.\n\nRodimus Prime: How about you come with me?\n\nRodimus kisses her.\n\n:: Kup ::\n\nKup arrives at Razael&#39;s quarters, and knocks.\n\nKup: Razael? It&#39;s Kup, love.\n\n:: Wolfenstein ::\n\nWolf starts to head out of the Predacon base.\n\nWolfenstein: Let&#39;s go check out those black and white guys. C&#39;mon! \nBeast mode!\n\nWolf transformes and heads out towards the nWo base.\n\n:: Darkangel ::\n\nDarkangel looks out of the Tripredacus ship, at Earth. Soon it would \nall belong to them, as Cybertron fell.\n\n:: Razor ::\n\nRazor looks over the newcomer to the nWo.\n\nRazor: Well, Heartbreak, welcome to the New World Order. This here is \nyour new family. Whern you are in the nWo these bots are your \nbrothers, understand?\n\n:: Heartbreak ::\n\nHeartbreak: I do. Thanks for allowing me into this group.\n\nHeartbreak sits down and has some energin with the others.\n\n:: Diesel ::\n\nDiesel chuckled. The nWo just kept getting larger and more powerfull. \nThey were truely a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\n"}}
