The story you tell me about implies that only a \n&gt; few \n&gt; &gt; bots were left, but this contradicts what has happened on \ncybertron. \n&gt; &gt; However, I guess nothing holds you from using the story on another \n&gt; &gt; world, with some minor changes. There is a bot owned by Lord of \n&gt; &gt; Darkness (wonder where he is now) named Cheetor, and a X-Predacon \n&gt; &gt; named Black Arachnia.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; O.k. and Optimus was quickly arrested after discovering the \norocal \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone thought that was that, but a few of his followers \n&gt; survived? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He never fought a second war or rescued any sparks, and barely \nhad \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to find out about organic core and its superiority to \nwater?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., wingedwarrior41@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry Dewboy. I know you want this plot to work, but It \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t. It&#39;s just like saying Mustex knows about Veratis when \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not actually met in the RPG. The basic story of a rebelling \n&gt; &gt; faction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sending a member to Earth was good, but you can not say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Techno-organics were on cybertron because it is not the \n&gt; Cybertron \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has been going on. Beast Machines never happened. This means \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals safely arrived on Cybertron, took Megatron to a trial \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something, and, in some way, he went back to Earth. That&#39;s it. \n&gt; BM \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never happened because if it did, Megatron never could have \nhad \n&gt; &gt; went \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to Earth, he would have been a part of Cybertron. It&#39;s \n&gt; hard, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll have to deal with it.\n\n\n"}}
