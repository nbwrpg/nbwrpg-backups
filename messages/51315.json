I sent her \nan email with instructions, but i was informed that it got deleted or \nsomething. So I sent another, and since Ellen hasn&#39;t replied, and it \nposting on the messageboard, I&#39;m lead to believe that the second \nemail also got deleted. (typing up a nice two page practice post, \nalong with tips, pointers, and suggestions as well gets irritating if \nyou have to do it several times. =) Regardless, I&#39;ll put some \ninstructions here.\n\nEllen (or Sarah?), go to http://mail.yahoo.com and sign up for a \nyahoo email address. After you&#39;ve done that, log in, and send me a \nconfirmation email to show that you&#39;ve signed up. After that, I&#39;ll \ngive you further training, and instructions.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: There is something illegal there. 3 can&#39;t be at two places at \nthe \n&gt; same time.
