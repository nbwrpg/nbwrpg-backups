There is no sign of hostile intent as space debris drifts \nendless by the vastness of space. The surface of the Ark�s surface glitters \nlike a diamond in rough as a closer scan of the surface reveals thick \npatches of ice that have settled on the ship with time. The dark side of the \nmoon gentle adds to aura of the ship and the wonderment of the scene.

The autoguns fire on as many mines as possible setting them off \nin a chain reaction off exploding mines shooting and jagged SHARDS OF METAL \neverywhere. The explosion from all the mines going off in sink is  creating \nwhat looks like a wall of plasma or wave energy rushing towards the \nAstroblast ((This is a one post attacks its not a stable defense.)) and the \nCat ships as it spreads out as more mines go off wave of high power plasma.\n\n::The cat ships::\nThe two WildCats ships as the shake violently as jagged shard of metal rips \nthrough as the ship seem to have taken heave damage.\n\n::Liono::\nLiono Finishes Disarming the missiles warheads &quot;Dark, Me, and \nBluestinger,Rinoa will ride ahead in these we have a chance of beating them \nthere the wave should slow them down alot more than us there in a living \nship.\n\n::Liono,Dark,Bluestinger,Rinoa::\nClimb in to the hollow missile shells and get ready to be launched.\n\n::Koj::\nFinishes disarming 2 warheads &quot;Me and Lilly will be right with you.&quot;\n\n::Koj and Lilly::\nKoj and Lilly climb into there own missile shells with the dragons each \nbeing carried as a armor on their master.\n\n::Key and Tigerhawk::\nKey lauches the missiles for Liono&#39;s ship and Tigerhawk launches for Koj \nship.
