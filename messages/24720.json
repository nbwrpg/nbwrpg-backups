(I know he&#39;s not there but\nthere\n&gt; isn&#39;t a better name for it.)  His beast mode was that of a crane.  (You\nknow,\n&gt; the bird that stands on one leg.)  He stepped out and found that in the\ncrash\n&gt; his logic circuits were scrambled, but he was in perfect condition other\nthan\n&gt; that.  Unfortunately all he could do was give pearls of wisdom.  Now all\nhe\n&gt; could do is make things unclear with those &quot;pearls of wisdom.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
