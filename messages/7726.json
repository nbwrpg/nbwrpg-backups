She turned to Rowdy, &quot;What do you make of all\n&gt; this? They couldn&#39;t have vanished into thin air.  They didn&#39;t leave\n&gt; the cave because their scent is too strong right here.  They aren&#39;t\n&gt; dead or thier bodies would either be on the floor or floating in the\n&gt; pool. So where could they have gone? Swimming and found a cave with\n&gt; air somewhere down there do you think?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Remember four years of good friends, bad clothes, explosive chemistry\n&gt; experiments.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/7077/13/_/_/_/964136226/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
