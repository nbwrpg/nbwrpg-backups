She looks back \nat it, smiling sweetly at his compliment of her. As she took his arm, \nshe briefly wondered whether the smile was for getting possible \naccess to the comps or for getting the info he wanted.\n\n&quot;Its right this way,&quot; she says, pointing toward a corner where she \nknew a console was located, and waiting for Vlad to start walking.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Vlad did not look down at Shesta as she received a rather \nfriendly stroke behind the ear by Fenox, hearing her words rather \nthen paying attention to the world about him. His optics narrowing \nslightly as she smiled before mentioning that their computer activity \nsystems continued what information he could use to able him to locate \nVon.\n&gt; Vlad smiled wickedly to himself, flashing a rather deadly set of \nteeth. However, he quickly righted himself in appearance and all evil \naspects vanished from his features, leaving the smile of a charmingly \nhandsome young man. Vlad leaned back, paying no such a mind to the \nwolf which seemed to wish to be picking his teeth with his super \nstructure.** &quot; Sounds like perfection to my needs, My Lady.&quot; ** Vlad \nwent into a slight bow.** &quot; As I am sure you are to the many eyes of \npreying men.&quot; ** He gave her a look which went along with his charm, \nbut was in truth fake interest.\n&gt; Vlad had a long history of using people to get what he wanted, no \nmatter the cost. And a broken spark was easily patched when the other \nperson found what could mend it.\n&gt; He offered Fenox his arm so that she could lead him to a console \nwhere he could collect data on Von.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
