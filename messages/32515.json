It was nailed with the shot and rendered completley \nuseless.  He felt the blade slide out of Dinobot and backed up a step \nwhile firing another blast of flame from the tip at the outers of \nDinobot this time. On his left arm a piece of his armor slid open and \na large laser rifle shot into his hand. He fired 10 badly aimed shots \nstill feeling the effects of Dinobots attack on his face.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Dinobot snarled wickedly as his clawed hand bear down on \nFireBlade, pulling back his freed hand once the enemy&#39;s grasp had \nloosened enough. Optic laser charged while the target reeled back out \nof arms length, though the blade of the sword still bit into his \nmidsection. He had been struck and this would be no small wound, \nthighs and legs already coated with a thick layer of mech-fluid which \nseeped from around the blade. Dinobot roared but not from pain, \nmuscles tense and contracting around that of the sword which was \ninside of his structure and holding it tight. The sight already \ntarget at FireBlade&#39;s throat, he fired a combination of extreme \nplasma radiation and paralyses protons at the designated area. \nHowever, what was to some next was unexpected.\n&gt; Circuitry and armor melted as the blade seemed to erupt into a \nsingle flame, though only internals were effected. Dinobot cringed \nand suddenly jerked, sliding from the blade with a metallic ring. **\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at \nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
