Thy may have sen Malice, we might have a \nchance to get him back.&quot;\n\nWolfblade thought about it, about him.  She thought long and hard, \nand then she stood up.\n&quot;Let&#39;s go get him.&quot; \n\nBoth femmes ran out of the base, and Organics picked Wolfblade up and \ncarried herall the way to the Cannon site.\n\nDeep within the base, another answered the call.  Though he was not \nan Autobot, he still had reasons to fight.  The great black and white \nbot got up, walked through the dark corridors,and exited the now \nnearly empty base.  He detected where eveyone was headed, and he too, \ntook flight.  Megatron Revived transformed into his gunship form and \nfollowed, there fighting to be done and he wanted to be in the middle \nof it.\n\n\nHellplague waited for the rest of her strike force to achieve the \nsame altitude as he, and then they all took off for the cannon.\n&quot;For the glory of Unicron!&quot; she cried as the cannon site crept into \nher view.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you have a strategy old friend?&quot; hissed sarcastically hydras to \n&gt; Rodimus\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally Rodimus made his way outside the base.
