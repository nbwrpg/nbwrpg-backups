The idea itself was humorous to him. A femm attacking \nhim? He was sure the fight wouldn&#39;t last more than a nano-cycle. His shoulder \nblasters emerge, his hands closing around both his swords. Slayer narrows his \neyes, ready for battle.\n\nHe nearly growls in disapointment as he hears his masters orders, his \nshoulder blasters sliding back in, and his hands leaving his swords. &quot;I \napologize, Master,&quot; he says to Prebon, snarling at Spears afterwards.\n\n&quot;Watch yourself, femm,&quot; he growls at her, pushing past her and walking to the \nsuit.\n\nHe looks it over as he stops near it, not bothering to even glance back at \nSpears, his face breaking into an evil smile. It was excellent. Rocket \nlaunchers, infared goggles, a pair of swords... (I&#39;m repeating what Minime \nposted about it, not making anything up)\n\nSlayer picks up the suit and begins to put it on.\n\n"}}
