He flew up to them all checked them over.\n\n&quot;Do you have enough energy to form Element again?&quot; He asked, and smiled when \nhe got positive responces from all of them. Mantle gave the order to \ncombine, and they all did and formed Element in a few seconds. Element \nlooked around and saw Megatron heading for the Cybertronian Fire. He ran \ntoward Megatron and fired two missiles and twenty shots right at him. This \ntime no exuses like &quot;Megatron was out of range&quot; could be used, because \nElement was well within range to fire at Megatron.\n\n\nThe Galactor jets recieved Zardus&#39;s orders and then came around for another \npass. They saw Astroblast heading for the Cybertronian Fire, and set a \nhead-on collision toward him. They approached him quickly, though one of \nthem was cloaked and Astroblast wouldn&#39;t see it, and then fired two missiles \neach as soon as they were close. Both of them pulled up to avoid a \ncollision, but the missiles kept going right at Astroblast.\n\n\nThe nanobots were finished with their work on the insides of the \nCybertronian Fire. They had taken everything from the inside, and then had \ntransported it to the Element and were installing everything now. They had \ngotten the solar panels and the shield generators as soon as the shields \nwent down, and right now they were installing them on the Element. If \nAstroblast were to reach the Cybertronian Fire and break through the shell, \nhe would find himself inside a very large and just as empty dome, but there \nwas no way to tell that from the outside. The nanobots began to weaken the \nbottom of the dome and got ready to collapse it as soon as they wanted.\n\n\nCyndro was very happy with the progress that his nanobots made. The shield \ngenerators and solar panels that they brought in from the Cybertronian Fire \nwould help alot in this battle. They were being recharged now, but they \nwould soon be up and running. A few shots hit Cyndro&#39;s shields, but they \nwere minor so he just returned fire with plasm shots.\n\nCyndro didn&#39;t have too much to do, but he had to get everything programmed \nto work with the Element, so he got to that. But he&#39;d heard Epyon say \nsomething about more supplies before Epyon left, so he couldn&#39;t wait to get \nmore materials again!\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
