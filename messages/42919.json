No, he wouldn&#39;t necessarily join, although he may pretend, \nbut the Alliance and Zardus might be able to help him.  Decadel would \ncome back to Maximal City, though, to get some Terracons......Decadel \nleft Maximal City, transformed into sea-worm beast mode, dug in the \nground, and went for the Alliance base, going down deep and going \nthrough dirt and eventually water, his beast mode suited for both.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Abyssian By Birth~\n&gt; ~Badass By Choice~\n\n\n"}}
