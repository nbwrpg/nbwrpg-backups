After he was\nreformatted and lost most of it, his battle skills\nimproved and he matured quickly.  By the way I&#39;m\nleaving at 4 this afternoon (Eastern) I hope to be\nback Sunday, but don&#39;t count on anything until Monday.\n\n--- x_rauq_x &lt;x_rauq_x@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, from the council obviously. Sometimes we need\n&gt; a little \n&gt; pestering. I&#39;d didn&#39;t reply to your emails about\n&gt; Vector Sigma \n&gt; because i was unsure of it. Perhaps I should have\n&gt; said &quot;wait&quot; or \n&gt; something, but i&#39;m busy with school.
