No...she\nneeded\n&gt; better mech-fluid then that, and she was fairly picky when it came to her\n&gt; meals as well.\n&gt; However...on her way to this area she had smelled a rather deliciouse\nscent,\n&gt; one of mech-fluid but with a strong flow. ( Dinobot&#39;s) That meant that\nit&#39;s\n&gt; owner was healthy and strong, the perfect one in which she could feed.\n&gt; However, the scent had been stronger then it normaly was, then when she\n&gt; simply smelling it INSIDE the body. No...the scent was stronger because\nthe\n&gt; fluid had to be outside the body...wounded.\n&gt; She would make it a chore to find this bot whom owned such deliciouse\n&gt; mech-fluid and feed upon him, quenching her hunger with only the best.\n&gt; But she turned her amber eyes back to the battle and saw Zardus land,\nfiring\n&gt; off at some Maximals.\n&gt; Well, she guessed that it was about time that she got down and dirty, she\n&gt; folded her wings in and dove towards her target.(Deemos.)\n&gt; In mid-dive she transformed into robot mode and removed a boomerang like\n&gt; object from her back, poison dripping blades along it&#39;s edge.\n&gt; She threw her arm back and then snapped it forward, sending the poison\n&gt; boomerang towards Deemos from above.\n&gt; Battle not, feed later.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
