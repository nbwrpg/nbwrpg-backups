The half wolf transformed to full beast mode and rolled to\ncover. His sense of smell alerted him to the advancing Bat probes. He opened\ninto a full sprint catapulting himself over several of the shots opening his\nmouth wide intending to bite down hard on the probes. There were more than\nhe&#39;d origionally calculated as the probes spread out in a formation to wide\nfor the wolf to take out in one blow. Shots hit Lunarpine but the low level\nweaponry posed little more than a sting to the adrenaline pushed wolf.

Remaining in\n&gt; his half wolf form he smelled around knowing that either the Preds\n&gt; had another way out or they were trapped inside. His idea was to find\n&gt; it and direct the others out. His dampner was still active making him\n&gt; invisable to scanners. He knew that the only way he&#39;d be seen is\n&gt; direct contact. Since he could smell a bot coming from a couple miles\n&gt; away he wasn&#39;t worried about getting caught.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
