One of his most potent drinks flopped.  As far as he knew, no Maximal or Predacon could handle the energy waveform.  It was just not feasible.  Perhaps systems could be adjusted to tolerate just a little more, but this was ridicules.  He could out drink any Seeker, Wrecker, Gestalt, Triplechanger, and even Supreme Commander.

As he mixed a new drink in a new glass, he secretly added extra energy and manipulated it into this secondary waveform.  It did not affect the color, taste, smell, or texture, but it would cause a specific problem.  This attempt, was aimed at her thermal regulator.  In her current state, she would seek more than liquid refreshment.  Sure it was a cruel joke, but at least it wasn&#39;t going to harm her.  She could just run a diagnostic cycle on her systems and the problem would cease to be.
