Optimal Optimus, Hydras and Marauder are\nlarger still though, especially as the last two are currently carrying\ntwo sparks.\n\nBut the Maximals have several Ultras on their side at the moment,\nincluding Rodimus - which is another reason for them to hurry and find\nout what has happened to him - whether he has returned to the dark\nside or not. He is a powerful ally . . . or foe and could tip the\nbalance one way or another.\n\n- Preston\n\n\n\n- Preston\n\nOn 8/27/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tucson is just a little taller than his last form due to his beast form.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 27, 2011, at 4:29 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have also added the new time line in the club files section. feel\n&gt;&gt; free to lok it over as well.
