There was another bot! How the hell did he get there?, wondered Iss. \nIss breifly considered possibilities. Chances were pretty slim that the robot \nhad just &quot;woken up&quot; from some years-long slumber, and thus been previously \nmissing on sensors. That could be the messenger of another faction.\n\n&quot;Vorb&quot; sent Iss. &quot;That bot in the clearing may be another potential ally. We \nshould investigate.&quot;\n\n[I agree] sent back Vorb. [Let&#39;s go.]\n\nIss took hold over VorbIss&#39;s cooperative systems, and walked VorbIss to the \nhatch controls. Iss found the &quot;Open&quot; button and pressed it.\n\nIss spoke throught the semi-open hatch entrance. &quot;Robot, do you read me? I am \nVorbIss. Who are you, and what is your faction?&quot;\n\n::Vorb::\n\n&quot;Robot, do you read me? I am VorbIss. Who are you, and what is your faction?&quot; \nsaid Iss.\n\nVorb was unsure of Iss&#39;s abilit&#92;y to operate acceptably by himself. Iss was, \non the surface, obviously loyal to Vorb. Closer analysis of Iss, through \ntheir neural link, revealed a small issue, however: Iss was loyal to \nprotecting the body. Vorb himself, the spark, was Iss&#39;s second priority.\n\nVorb gently guided a nano-bot control tendril into position above Iss&#39;s \ncognitive processors. He took aim. He pushed.\n\n::Iss::\n\nPain! Pain! Pain! Thought was wrapping itself in a body of nanoprobes and \nVorb was is will be Iss is gone!\n\nWhat was left of Iss&#39;s mind after the inserted control tendril reeled. \nInfinite loops were cropping up. Glitches in his software suddenly appearing. \nAnd through it all, Iss&#39;s changing processors experienced everything. It \noccured to Iss that Vorb was taking over his mind, and that he had \nunderestimated the spark. That soon Iss would cease to exist, and so would \nVorb, both merging to become the entity VorbIss. This did not surprise Iss, \nthough; It was like a law of nature. As taken-for-granted as gravity.\n\nIss shuddered, then suddenly was not Iss.\n\n::VorbIss::\n\nThe weird contortions of his face finally finished, what with the messy \nbusiness of melding Iss&#39;s mind into his, VorbIss analized his situation. He \nhad a taser, a laser, and a shuttle to hide in.\n\nThrough the open shuttle doors, he took aim at the bot which had stumbled in. \n&quot;Halt. I am VorbIss, poly-consolidated intelligent robot. Explain yourself.&quot;\n\nVorbIss really really didn&#39;t want to fire. He had to act tough, of course, \nbut the energy a taser shot would cost him would be too much.\n\nVorbIss waited for a reply form the haggard bot.\n\n\n\n"}}
