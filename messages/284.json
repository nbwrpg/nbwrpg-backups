The repulsor thrusts\nwere\n&gt; blocked and there was no getting it out. MEGATRON jumped out into the\nclear\n&gt; night, followed by Rat Trap :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::; MEGATRON ::: Damn! Now were stuck...\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Rat Trap ::: Well boss....we could walk.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: MEGATRON glared at Rat trap, with his answer :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Rat Trap ::: Ok..I guess not. Well, what are you going to do now?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: MEGATRON ::: We are going to.....going to.....\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He scans the area. With his sensors he picks up an underground stream,\n&gt; and it leads back into the ocean. If they hauled the speeder into the\nstream\n&gt; they could float back into the ocean and head for the small keys that\nhooked\n&gt; out from the valley. They might be safe there, and it was unexplored\n&gt; territory. Perfect idea. ::::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: MEGATRON ::: You three, pick up the speeder and follow me to that out\n&gt; cropping. Theres a stram there. I have an idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He picks up Quickstrike and hurls him over his shoulder, as Rat Trap\n&gt; begins to lift the speeder. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: HELL BEAST looks to Brightblade ::: Ah, a true Predacon. Someone who\nwill\n&gt; go far in my institution.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: he then turns to Goron ::: You two would make an excellent team! Your\n&gt; first assignment is to locate MEGATRON and follow him. I want to know\nwhere\n&gt; he is, what he is doing, and if he is armed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: He then turns to RAMPAGE ::: Sub-commander, the Maximals have been\npests\n&gt; for a long while. And I do recall you planning our next attack. If you\nwould\n&gt; please gey right on that I would be most happy.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: HELL BEAST, in his command chair looked to his others ::: begins\nrepairs\n&gt; on the ship, and modifications. This is our sanctuary, and i will be\ndamned\n&gt; if anyone gets inside of it agian. Our next attack on the Maximals shall\nbe\n&gt; our greatest...if Rampage is a good enough general as I think he is,\nanyways.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Enjoy the award-winning journalism of The New York Times with\n&gt; convenient home delivery.
