Now there was a whole battle around her.\n&lt; You pay too much attention to one thing.&gt; She thought to herself as she \ntook a slightly stumbled step forward, feeling the gash only rip up more \nalong her seering through her mind.  It caused her to lean heavily on the \nsword, eventually dropping to her knees.*\n\n&quot; Have to...get up!&quot;\n\n&lt; If some enemy catches me like this they won&#39;t think a second to turn me \ninto scrap.&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
