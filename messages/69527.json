The more he sat there, the more he began to get in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; touch with h=\r\nis sociable side. He could sense where Talon was, and is sure to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\nut a gentile hand on her shoulder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Well, if=\r\n it hadn&#39;t been for Kup&#39;s training, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as skille=\r\nd as I am. I sure do miss him. I can&#39;t remember much about what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nally happened and how I got separated from the other Autobots.
