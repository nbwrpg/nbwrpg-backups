Its a task I trust he can accomplish.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: TRANSANULAS, in the privacy of a lab that had be kept closed for some \ntime, went to contact Quickstrike. Of course, he couldnt use the ship&#39;s \nfunctions without getting caught. But, scince Quickstrike did have control \nover the computers he might risk it. The spider walked up and typed in a \ncode. An image of QUickstrike, along with an unfimiliar bot appeared before \nhim. Quite strange....\n    He glanced around Quickstrike&#39;s surroundings. If he was going to get \nattacked there would be little chance of victory due to his leg. And the \nspider had no way to get there in time, unless he could contact \nsomeone...someone new who didnt know to much about him. ...The Oblitercons! \n:::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: OMINOUS PRIME lurked in the misty fog. Getting through the Highlands of \nthe valley was a difficult task, especially in the fog. He had set up a small \nfortification that was specifically set up for intercepting messages. And \nwith the battle ending the lines were very busy. One message intrigued the \nEnergonian very much. TRANSANULAS had sent a message to the Oblitercons....\n\n Playback----\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: Dear Oblitercons. I have come to understand that you are \nmerceneries for higher. I want your services to aid my companian. Do as he \nsays and escort him where he wishes. For your payment, I will supply you wil \na working proto-form. The proto-form needs to scan a lifeform, which you can \nselect. Once you have helped my companian, I will deliver the pod containing \nthe proto-form in it to you. Quickstrikes coordinates are 445.78....please \nhurry, this is of great urgency!\n\nEnd transmission---\n\n::: OMINOUS laughed. Prehaps his revenge could be exacted with the \nOblitercons...OMINOUS decided that he would join this elite group, and work \nfor them until he could strike back at TRANSANULAS and destroy HELL BEAST and \nhis fraction for good! ::::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: MEGATRON floated about, and finally contacted Shredder ::: \n\n::: MEGATRON ::: Shredder...I am alive and well. I want you to be in charge \nof the group for the time being. Find Quickstrike and help him. Rat Trap has \ndefected, but that is no major loss. With my current form, we can take back \nthis ship and then we can destroy the Auto-bots for good!\n\n"}}
