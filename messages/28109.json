This was not a sign of\n&gt; intelligence, Skullgrin remained dumb as ever in Pretender mode, but it was\n&gt; an instinct.  Skullgrin lifted his sword with Hot Rod still on it and\n&gt; quickly swung it at Cheetor, dodiging the blades, so that Hot Rod and the\n&gt; sword would smack Cheetor.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;            Triggerhappy brought out his gun, and put the tip of it right at\n&gt; Condor&#39;s forehead.\n&gt; \n&gt;             &quot;Like my friend Astroblast says, shut your mouth and remain\n&gt; still!
