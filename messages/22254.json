Autoguns flipped down from the cealing, rows of them aiming \nthemselves at Angel Prime. The hatch magnetically locked, three more \ndoors magneticaly locking themselves in front of it. The only other \nexit locked in the same fashion, with three doors in front of it. The \nmany autoguns swirled around to aim at Angel Prime, flamethrowers \nimbedded in several sections of the walls ready. There was no escape.\n\nThe autoguns opened fire.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Angel Prime\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he saw the hatch door closing he was not going to make it the \nmissles were \n&gt; gaining on him so he had a idea not smart but it would work. he let \nthe \n&gt; missles hit him and they push him in he was thrown in with a messed \nup \n&gt; looking back but he was in now he swam over and kicked havocs \ndecapeted body \n&gt; and he shoved his left arm blade at decs spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
