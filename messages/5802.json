She kept up pretty well.  She felt \nthe predator in her rising to the surface.  She saw him as her target.  She \nbeat her wings harder and came within a few feet of him.\n&quot;Oh I&#39;m beast enough all right.&quot;  She grinned. Her spark raced at the \nchallange.  She was about to touch him when a gust of wind caught her and \nshe rose a little too high to touch him.  She beat wing and flew after him.  \nShe was having fun.  This was a test of her endurance and skill.  At the \nsame time, she was enjoying the freedom of it all.\n\n&quot;And when I tag you, your cooking dinner tonight.&quot; She knew that aminals \ndidn&#39;t cook thier food, but she wanted to rib him back a little.  She wanted \nto see if he could take what he dished out.\n\n\n----Original Message----\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jul 5, 2000 7:43pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\nLunarpine knew Shadow Wing had the advantage in tne air, all he could\ndo to avoid her was stay in the high grass and trees, he tried to\nkeep her upwind so he could smell her. She swept low, he moved to the\nside, trying his damndest to stay ahead of her. In the wild the beast\nhad to stay ahead of the hunter, or end up lunch. Even though they\nwere only playing, he had to be a wolf, in both actions and reactions.\n\n&quot;Catch me if you can Wing, If you&#39;re beast enough.&quot; Lunarpine had to\nrattle her chains a little, if she couldn&#39;t handle a little ribbing\nthen she couldn&#39;t handle a real fight. The soldier in him had to know\nfor sure who he could depend on when the firefight began.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
