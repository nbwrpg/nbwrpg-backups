He grabs \n&gt; Organics&#39; sword and drops his disruptor rifle so she may be able to \n&gt; defend herself.  He reduces the light he gives off, but still enough \n&gt; to interfer with vision.  He tries to get up to Blacknightmare but \n&gt; is stopped by a hail of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll show you how a real Decepticon REALLY fights!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He shifts the sword to cannon mode.  The blade splits, as does the \n&gt; handle.  The two halves grow in size, until the handle attaches to \n&gt; his shoulders for support.  He aims the massive weapon on \n&gt; Blacknightmare, and begins powering up the cannon charge.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague decides to get Malice&#39;s attention by capturing \n&gt; Organics.  She succeeds and wraps an arm around her neck and hoists \n&gt; her up.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Alright Maximals!  Stop this foolishness or your little girlly \n&gt; friend has a weapon accident!&quot; the minion says as she aims one of \n&gt; her disruptors mounted in her arm to the valkyrie&#39;s head.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Malice is temporarily supercharged.  He has better speed, but \n&gt; endurance and dexterity have suffered.  He&#39;ll take more damage, but \n&gt; he also has all that energy to attack with.  He can use the cannon \n&gt; multiple times, so either evade him, or try and stop him from firing \n&gt; the cannon.  It will be a big bang.  Also, try and get Organics away \n&gt; from Hellplague.
