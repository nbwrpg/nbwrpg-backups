However, the factor that its life would be terminated none the less was still dominant, and with that single thought present in his mind Dinobot raised his free hand, the claw extended and ready to slit FireBlades throat and end his existence.  Just ready to bring down the blade, something suddenly occurred to the transmetal two: the enemy was recovering...and a scann reviled, too late, that it was enough to move.  FireBlade caught Dinobot&#39;s hand, even though the sharpness of his claws would dig into it, causing deep gashes. However, if there was surprise in him, Dinobot failed to express it.  The sword caught the x-Predacon in the stomach and bit in deep, though inner organs and circuitry were too heavily armored to be damaged fatally.  Dinobot snarled, disgusted that FireBlade had given such damage. Snapping his free hand forward, claws extended, he slashed at the enemies face while sliding off of the tip of his blade, mech-fluid flowing freely from the wound while a little trickled at the side of his mouth.  Such damage could be repaired easily, however, finding the opportunity to take the time was something else.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
