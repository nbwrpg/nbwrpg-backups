Certain that his body would not\n&gt; survive, Azureblade inverted his spark polarity so as to be\n&gt; undetectable and left its hulk. Of course, it could do nothing, but\n&gt; his mission had been a success. He proved the Minions they were as\n&gt; mortal as the rest of Transformers were.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unhindered by gravity, the spark left the moon as soon as it safely\n&gt; could and went towards Earth at speeds only energy could manage.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The body doesn&#39;t move.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The spheres paused for a moment as if scanning the inert form of\n&gt; &gt; Azureblade.
