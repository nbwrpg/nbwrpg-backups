And Zardus didn&#39;t tell you\n&gt; nothing. So, enough with the lying. Here&#39;s what we got: Blackarachnia is\n&gt; currently newly self-claimed leader of the Predacons. They stuffed\n&gt; BrightBlade away, and Quickstrike is second in command, but it hasn&#39;t sunk\n&gt; into his thick little head yet, since he&#39;s been distracted.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t give me that slag!&quot; He grabbed Dark Mouse under her arms firmly and\n&gt; lifted her up. &quot;Now get up, dang it!
