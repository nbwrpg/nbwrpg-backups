He\nhad just been through the greatest time he could remember. He went to\nthe sink, and splashed some water on his face. His optics finally\nstarted working right. He went to the mess hall, grabed a few energon\ncubes, a apple for his organics, and a glass of energin. He sat down and\nstarted eating. When he was done he would find KitKat. They had to start\nthe training soon.\n\n"}}
