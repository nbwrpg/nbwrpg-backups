There was no \npoint to the scan now, except for the fact that she read a little amount of \nshock from Prowl when he looked over security, wondering to herself what was \nwrong.\nThe next thing she knew Angel Prime had entered and room, told her he was \nleaving and left, then both Epyon and Prowl ran out towards the front of the \nship.\nShe sighed. What was wrong now?\nWithout even hesitation Iron Raptor followed, though slower then any of the \nothers.\nShe was in no hurry to find out what the problem was now, but she knew that \nit must be important for Prowl to get involved.\nLeaving Firedrill to follow her if he pleased, she walked through the walls \nof the CF, running a hand along them from time to time until the doors of \nthe CF came into view.\nFrom there she walked alone, nothing destracting her as the doors drew \ncloser. Finally, she paused at them and they both opened for her, walking \npast them as if there was nothing wrong and she was just coming out for a \nbreath of fresh air.\nAnd from there there was more then just the landscape to look at, Maximals \nof all sorts had gathered around some other transformer, but one that was, \nfor sure, no Maximal.\nIron Raptor narrowed her eyes, her voice clear and carried over everyone \nelses.*\n\n&quot; What&#39;s going on here?!&quot;\n\n\n...................................................\n\n* Slick the water running from her form, Sublime stepped from the sea and \nonto the land, thinking how strange it was to fee earth under her feet \ninstead of the smoothness of the liquid she had just came from.\nShaking herself off a bit she set out towards her destination, the Maximal \nBase.(CF)\nThere was no telling how the faction would react to meeting her and there \nwas no telling how she would feel about meeting them. BUT she was determined \nto make a proper and complete study on them, just like the remainder of the \ngroup was supposed to do with the factions they&#39;d hooked up with.\nBut from here on there was no real amount of water that she could soak in \nuntil she reached the ship, making this seem like a very uncomfortable \nquest.\nBut she was sure that the faction she was heading too had water, enough for \nher to soak in for hours.\nSublime looked back over her shoulder, half turning and looking out at the \nsea longingly. The smooth surface reflecting the last of the sun&#39;s rays as \nevening closed in.\nShe would miss the sea, but she would return. She would always return.\nAnd with that she turned back towards the land, setting out towards the \nforests and wood, until she came to the grasslands that held the CF.\nBut, just to speed up the process, her signature sent out a destress beacon \nto all Maximal foces.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
