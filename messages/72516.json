His\n&gt; &gt; &gt; voice and tone was emphatic, &quot;But if anyone wan=\r\nts to stay and try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work this out, then anyone who tries and break =\r\nthis truce they will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answer to *me*&quot; LEO was in full command mode, hi=\r\ns face calm and yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his tone firm and authoritative no matter who his=\r\n optics fell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MAXIMAL or PREDACON.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yup, LEO is trying =\r\nto hold this thing together, even if he did not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agree to it in the fi=\r\nrst place. Now it was their only shot.
