The ships bulky form crashed at the edge of a \n&gt; sw=\r\nampy jungle like area, losing several of the lower decks, and \nmany \n&gt; sens=\r\nory capabilities. The rear thrusters had also been damaged, and \n&gt; one of t=\r\nhe three had come off in the initial stages of the crash.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the slidi=\r\nng speed of the craft decreases, Megatron holds on \nwhile \n&gt; glancing at th=\r\ne rest of his crew. &quot;Stop damnit...&quot; he growls and \nhis \n&gt; words are punctu=\r\nated by a bang as he is thrown forward, almost \n&gt; losing his grips. The vis=\r\nual display of the remainging computer \n&gt; showed that the ship had crashed =\r\ninto a thickly rooted tree, and \nhad \n&gt; been slowed down enough to stop the=\r\n sliding. Their trail was rather \n&gt; obvious unfortunately, a long groove in=\r\n the rocks and soil followed \n&gt; a path that lead right to the ship. He hope=\r\nd that the Maximals had \n&gt; encountered the same situation provided they had=\r\n followed him-- no, \n&gt; he knew that they were coming, and would likely be c=\r\nlose behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing around at his crew again. He starts giving out o=\r\nrders. \nThey \n&gt; needed to move, and to move quickly. &quot;Drillbit, get on that=\r\n \ncomputer \n&gt; screen, and give me a status report, it looks bad.&quot; He steps =\r\ndown \n&gt; from the command chair, and turns to Waspinator. Waspinator, get \n&gt;=\r\n outside and do some scouting. We need to know what the terrain is \n&gt; like.=\r\n Don&#39;t go too far, try to maintaina perimeter. Come back \nwithin \n&gt; two hou=\r\nrs.&quot; (ooC: email me for info about terrain)\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaving those two to their=\r\n tasks, he turns the the rest of \ncrew. &quot;We \n&gt; have arrived, and we are by =\r\nno means prepared to do anything but \n&gt; make repairs at the moment. Nemesis=\r\n Enforcer, go to the storage \nbay, \n&gt; grab the repair kits, and some extra =\r\ncomputer parts.&quot; Megatron \n&gt; growls, &lt;DELAYS... accursed delays...&gt; &quot;Percep=\r\ntor, take \nQuickstrike. \n&gt; You two go look for a suitable place to start mi=\r\nning Energon.&quot; Last \n&gt; for the moment, &quot;Inferno, make yourself useful, and =\r\nbring back all \n&gt; the salvagable scraps of metal that you can find that cam=\r\ne off of \n&gt; the ship during the crash.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sits back in his command ch=\r\nair, &quot;Yess... Everyone else, report \n&gt; here for orders.&quot; The mighy transfor=\r\nmer known as Megatron frowns \n&gt; angrily at the unexpected results of going =\r\nthrough the time-space \n&gt; wormhole...\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: I was wondering what people=\r\n think about having our world that \n&gt; we are going to RPing on is going to =\r\nresemble a developing form of \n&gt; Pangea at about the late Triassic/early Ju=\r\nrrasic period, when it \nwas \n&gt; starting to divide into the continents. I co=\r\nuld creat a map, unless \n&gt; someone can find me a good one in black and whit=\r\ne, for the \nworldmap, \n&gt; and we could work off of of that. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for fac=\r\ntions, we were going to have 5, the Maximals, the \n&gt; Predacons, the Autobot=\r\ns, the Decepticons, and a neutral faction to \n&gt; be determined by a vote. A =\r\nquestion was brought up about groups of \n&gt; bots that weren&#39;t in factions th=\r\nat, for example, wanted to hang out \n&gt; together for survival etc. Since I&#39;m=\r\n not entirely sure how to deal \n&gt; with that thought at the moment, the coun=\r\ncil will have a discussion \n&gt; again soon regarding it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Updates for the=\r\n website will be done on thursday since that&#39;s my \nday \n&gt; off (other than t=\r\nhe weekends). I&#39;ve got to email Yan and hopefully \n&gt; get him to make some c=\r\nhanges to the website. (not text related \nones, \n&gt; cause those are the only=\r\n ones i can do)\n\n\n"}}
