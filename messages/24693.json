She slanted a look \nat Carnage and crossed her eyes, making a discreet &#39;He&#39;s crazy!&#39; \nsign. She then stifled a smirk.\n\n&quot;Good Day? Well that really depends on your point of view&quot; She said \nsarcastically, and out of the corner of her eye, she saw Sabre (the \nbald eagle) sitting on the branch directly above Instrat, lifting his \ntail slightly. Her eyes brightened, but no one else noticed. \n\nIf eagles could look mischevious, Sabre would have right then. He \naimed perfectly, and dropped his &#39;poop missile&#39; on straight perfect \naim towards the bots head, impossible to miss. \n\nThe Fuzor kept her wrist dart aimed on Instrat&#39;s head, waiting for \nthe bot to make a move.\n\n\n"}}
