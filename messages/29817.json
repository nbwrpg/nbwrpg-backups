A scientist looked into the problem and realized that\nthe planets that were avoided were full of avian life that lived off insect\nlife. The insecticons took on the survival instincts of the creatures they\nturned into. The logical solution was to create avian modes for our\ntranslife.&quot; she paused trying to speak without revealing to much. &quot;Anyway\nthe point is that everything has a predator and prey. I hope to combine\nthose qualities and remove most of the psychological fears.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 14, 2001 10:03 AM\nSubject: Re: Fighting and Creating\n\n\n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hmm...&quot; Zardus sits back, considering this new idea.
