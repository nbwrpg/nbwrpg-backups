If you do you&#39;re wrong. Your stasis pod picked your owl\nform because it best suited your function. If you attempt to change that,\nyou&#39;ll change your entire life. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t look her in the face\nbecause deep down inside he wanted this change.  He knew his reasons were\nwrong so he couldn&#39;t influence her.\n\n&quot;If you change who you are, you&#39;ll could change how I feel about you.&quot; I\nwon&#39;t be held responsible for the change. Lunarpine stepped away leaving her\nto think about one question. &quot;If you change you&#39;ll lose all ability to fly\nfree. Is that truly what you want?\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, July 28, 2000 9:41 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt;\n&gt; She turned and looked at Lunarpine. She looked into those charming\n&gt; eyes of his.\n&gt; &quot;Look, I&#39;m an owl and your a wolf.  That right there making this\n&gt; difficult.  We are two different species right now.&quot;\n&gt; She knelt down and put the scanner on the floor.  She moved to face\n&gt; Lunarpine.\n&gt; &quot;I know that a social creature, like the wolf, wil get lonely after a\n&gt; while if there are no other creatures like it around.  I too am\n&gt; lonely for the other owls back in the old forest.  So I thought that\n&gt; if I changed into a wolf, I could make you happier.&quot;  she smiled and\n&gt; looked at him with careing in her eyes.\n&gt; &quot;I just wanted to make you happy. And if this works, maybe I&#39;ll even\n&gt; see you smile once in a while too.&quot;\n&gt; She picked up the scanner and started walking down the hallway.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine held still for a moment while Shadow Wing scanned him.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; hum of the scanner causing soothing vibrations through his body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He tranformed back to bot and started to follow her back to the CR\n&gt; &gt; room. He heard what she said about being a wolf. &quot;You&#39;re what?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t know exactly what to think, &quot;Just what are you\n&gt; &gt; thinking?&quot; He was beginning to get upset &quot;Why the Pit would you\n&gt; want\n&gt; &gt; to do something like that for?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He decided to let her explain herself before he jumped to\n&gt; conclusions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (These two should be a couple, they&#39;re either loving each other or\n&gt; &gt; arguing about something.)\n&gt; &gt; (One of these days Shadow Wing POW To the Moon:)\n&gt; &gt; I gotta go do laundry, we&#39;ll pick up this argument later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
