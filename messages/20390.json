She \nentered into the engine area. She stopped and sniffed the ground, He \nwas near, but how near. She waited a few seconds. Her clone in bot \nmode came running up. She sent the message for the clone to stay and \nguard the entrance. The fox had boxed himself in. And she wanted to \ntake advantage of it. She kept her nose to the ground an followed the \nscent trail.  &quot;OK Foxy. I know your here.&quot; She smiled. &quot;You know fox, \nI am curious about something. Why sneek in here and steel stuff from \nmy lab?&quot; She then stopped in her tracks. She growled at herself \nremembering her oath to the little furball. She swore not to harm \nhim. She growled at herself for saying something like that. In the \nfuture, she would have to guard her words more closely. \n&quot;Foxy, I know you can hear me. I..I gave you my word that I wouldn&#39;t \nharm you. And..&quot; she lowered her head. She said in a dissappointed \nvoice. &quot;ANd I will keep it. I will not harm you. Autoguns, disengage.&quot;\n\nThe autoguns dissarmed. She sat down on her hind legs and looked \naround she knew he was in one of the many rooms in this area. She \nsighed. &quot;I will not harm you or let you come to harm. I gave you \nword. If nothing else, I shall keep my word. I am a bot of honor. \nDespite how I feel about it. You foxy will not be harmed. I didn&#39;t \nfire the autoguns on you nor will I.&quot; She layed down, but kept her \nhead up. &quot;I shall wait here Fox, I wish to speak to you.&quot;\n\nShe knew that if he was foolish enough to set off a charge in there, \nhe&#39;d be dead, and so would she.  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Foxfingers ran down the hall with the Wolf on his heels. &quot;Turn \nmyself \n&gt; over?&quot; he asked laughing, &quot;But I&#39;m not done on this side yet.&quot; He \n&gt; wagged his tail in the air taunting his hosts.&quot;I should be fine as \n&gt; long as they don&#39;t have autoguns down here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As if on cue he heard the familiar whir and click that the autoguns \n&gt; made. &quot;Oh recycled waste.&quot; he shouted as he put on the breaks. He \n&gt; slid ahead on the smooth surface and stopped about a foot from an \n&gt; autogun barrel. It didn&#39;t fire. That only meant that these Preds \n&gt; didn&#39;t want him dead yet. He scampered into the nearest unlocked \n&gt; door. He found himself in the engine room. A wrong turn but an \n&gt; acceptable one. He ducked behind one of the machines as the \nautoguns \n&gt; in the hall followed. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t dare fire at me while I&#39;m in \n&gt; here. he thought. If an autogun caused a leak in the engine there&#39;d \n&gt; be noone left.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
