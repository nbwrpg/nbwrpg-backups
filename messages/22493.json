She still felt like she was \nout of her league.  &quot;Well, confidence isn&#39;t easily gained. But I will \ndo my best.&quot;  She turned and walked outside. She went to the pod and \nwalked in.  She had never flown one before. She looked at the \ncontrols and sighed. &quot;Anyone knw how to fly one of these things?&quot; She \nahd never needed to fly a pod before. She had always had her own \nwings to use to get around. She nervously sat down in the pilot seat \nand looked at the controls, studying them.  &quot;Well, let&#39;s try this \nthen.&quot; She grabbed the joystick in her hand and moved it forward. \nnothing happened.  She pressed a few buttons on the console. nothing \nhappened.  She was starting to get frustrated. &quot;DARN IT, START!&quot;\n\nHer anger triggered her telekenetic powers to start up the engines \nand start up the thruster. &quot;Hey, now how did that happen? I wasn&#39;t \neven trying.&quot;  She looked as the console lights flickered and \nlistened to the roar of the engines. &quot;Wow.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine saw the worried look on her face. He followed her \noutside, &quot;He\n&gt; made the right decision, your abilities give you an advantage we \ncould never\n&gt; have.&quot; He knew that she&#39;d never led before, but now she had an \nedge. If\n&gt; she&#39;d stop thinking like a recon bot. &quot;I&#39;ll be at your side when \nthe time\n&gt; comes. I&#39;ve got confidence in you.&quot; he smiled and pet het along her \nback.\n&gt; She was no longer a typical recon bot she was now a prototype for \nVeratis&#39;\n&gt; new life. She is now stronger than she was, faster than she was, \nand even\n&gt; more powerfull than she was. If she got her confidence up she&#39;d be \nable to\n&gt; lead as well as the rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC did I tell you that Icebirds function happens to be mutant \ncommander?\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC Veratis radiod ahead to the compartment where the maximal \ntransport pod\n&gt; was kept.&quot; Razor Claw, Ice, and Lunarpine will be there shortly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers tinkered with the control settings. He knew better than \nto take\n&gt; chances of showing his face at the CF again without good reason. \nHe&#39;d stolen\n&gt; from them and he was sure that they wouldn&#39;t be happy about it.\n&gt; He completed the preflight checklist and doublechecked the \ncoordinates, &quot;All\n&gt; set, they can lift off whenever they&#39;re ready.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw was outfitted with a DNA collector. The device was a \nprobe\n&gt; extending from the hand, attached internally to a power supply box \nequipped\n&gt; with transmitter, the information from anybody he touched would be \nsent\n&gt; directly back to Veratis. The plan was brilliant.\n\n\n\n"}}
