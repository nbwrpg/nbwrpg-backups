They immediatly knew what \nwas needed.\n\n&quot;Octociz Maximize!&quot;\n\nThis was the very first time they had used this body to go to Beast \nMode. It was solid and strong, with two rocket launchers and his \nhorns could be used to grapple things. His scanners said that the bot \nhe had been talking with at the CF was coming. Good, all the help he \ncan get.\n\nOctociz was about to open fire, believing he was all alone. Then out \nof the corner of his eye he saw two bots(Rex and Firearm)who appeared \nto be Maximals. He was about to run to them, when Brix spoke up\n\nOctociz, let me handle it. I&#39;m more of the warrior.\n\nBut, Bronco could come back if you get angry enough\n\nI have to test it eventually.\n\nOctociz relinquished control to Brix, who started running towards the \ntwo bots. Careful to avoid fire, he finally reached them.\n\n&quot;Hello, my name is Brix, and I heard the transmission. Did the bot \nmake it?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
