He growls, diving quickly and firing at Arcangel.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scavanger puts his hand up to protect his face as the flame hits him,\nyelling\n&gt; in pain as the flame turns his skin black. He growls, firing back at\n&gt; Icedragon from his rifle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus flies up to the Alliance base, his head nearly getting blown off by\n&gt; flying debree from an autogun. He looks around, seeing Arcangel, Icedemon,\n&gt; Shocker, and Kamodia attacking the base. He looks down at his scanners,\n&gt; seeing the Alliance members dealing with some Maximals in the torture\n&gt; chambers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Zergling, DevilDuer,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Get out here and help\n&gt; defend the base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that, he turns toward Kamodia, firing his plasma launcher at her.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer opens his eyes, looking down at himself. He wasn&#39;t in too good a\n&gt; shape, mechfluid leaking from his wounds and a headache in his head. He\n&gt; growls as he hears Zardus&#39; transmission. Couldn&#39;t he get some rest?\n&gt;\n&gt; DevilDuer gets to his feet, using a tree branch for support. He walks out\nof\n&gt; the forest and toward the Alliance base, firing at Shocker.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Missing old school friends?
