Randomly selecting \n&gt;a\n&gt;form, the scanning mechanism entered the pod.\n&gt;\n&gt;A cycle later, the pod opened, Caitiff climbing out of the pod, shaking his\n&gt;head.  He had no idea where he was.\n&gt;&quot;Oh, by Primus, I&#39;m gonna die...I&#39;m gonna die!  On this useless jungle\n&gt;planet!&quot; he activated his scanning equipment, and detected a base that gave\n&gt;off a Maximal energy-signature, not that far southeast.\n&gt;&quot;Beast mode!&quot; Caitiff transformed into his chimpanzee mode, climbing up a\n&gt;tree, soon swinging from the longer branches to other long branches, \n&gt;heading\n&gt;for the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Caitiff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Name: Caitiff\n&gt;Gender: Male\n&gt;Alternate Mode: Chimpanzee\n&gt;Allegiance: Maximal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Description:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Character History:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Caitiff is fifty-six years in age, relatively young in Cybertronian \n&gt;society.\n&gt;Born in the province of Polyhex, he lived through a Predacon purge in \n&gt;Maximal\n&gt;law enforcement agents in that area.  Being an officer, he went out on the\n&gt;streets to combat this, and watched several of his best friends die in the\n&gt;line of duty.  When being pursued on foot, he hid in a corner, and nearly\n&gt;died, until military intervention stopped his demise.  Caitiff has been\n&gt;afraid of all Predacons ever since, and quit his job as an officer and \n&gt;became\n&gt;an electronic repair-bot, repairing broken stuff, and he also took up a \n&gt;hobby\n&gt;of Second and Third Cybertronian War equipment.  He can repair even the \n&gt;most\n&gt;damaged of stuff, as long as there&#39;s something to repair.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Character Personality:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A friendly robot, he is very likable.  But, unfortunately, he is a complete\n&gt;coward.  He is able to keep this kept hidden very well, but in a dangerous\n&gt;battle, he may lose it and could cost the life of a fellow Maximal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Character Stats:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Function: Equipment Repairs\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Strength: 7.0\n&gt;Speed: 5.5\n&gt;Rank: 2.0\n&gt;Firepower: 4.5\n&gt;Intelligence: 9.0\n&gt;Endurance: 6.0\n&gt;Courage: 2.0\n&gt;Skill: 10.0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Beast Mode Description:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a chimpanzee, he is only three foot four (3 ft, four inches).  \n&gt;Relatively\n&gt;weak, this mode isn&#39;t all that helpful, except for a fast retreat in the\n&gt;trees.  Black eyes, and tannish skin, his hair is black.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Robot Mode Description:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Brown, tawny, and black, he&#39;s a fearsome sight at 7 ft tall, somewhat\n&gt;surprising do to his nature.  Two blue Maximal symbols rest on his chest,\n&gt;almost invisible because of the hair covering his chest, abdomen, and arms.\n&gt;In his left hand, he carries a wrench.  In his right, he carries his tool\n&gt;box.  In subspace, he possesses a laser pistol, and  photon pistol, as well\n&gt;as a few spare tools.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
