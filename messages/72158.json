It does\n&gt; transfer from one mechanical apature to another, =\r\nbut rather it creates\n&gt; a temporary energized one and transfers from one in=\r\n a manner I am not\n&gt; accustomed to.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY tilted his head as he cont=\r\ninued his scan, &quot;The distances this\n&gt; bridge could reached would not be gre=\r\nat, perhaps planet wide only but\n&gt; it would cost signifigantly less in ener=\r\ngy to use.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO turned to look at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;In the last report y=\r\nou guys sent\n&gt; back didn&#39;t the Predacons recover a device that DARK RODIMUS=\r\n used\n&gt; during his transport?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LEGACY nodded, &quot;I have read the report.=\r\n If that is a controller of\n&gt; some type for this bridge network and we had =\r\naccess to this a device I\n&gt; might be able to use it to scan for its home so=\r\nurce.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Talon:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Same with you&quot;s=\r\naid Talon\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
