He stumbled back quite far actually, 5 steps\n&gt;   is kinda far for a gestalt to stumble back from a normal heighted\n&gt;   warrior&#39;s perspective.  Abominus snarled meanly at Galaxor, then\n&gt;   fired 2 beams from the lazer from his lower chest.\n&gt;   &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;   &gt;        Surgital heard the lightning bolt, and quickly turned around\n&gt;   and side-stepped just in time to avoid the lightning bolt by a speck\n&gt;   or two.  Then, Surgital converted his hand into a saw blade again,\n&gt;   and this time shot the saw blade at Lavatron&#39;s head.  (BTW, the blade\n&gt;   was shot vertical, so moving to the side gives a better chance of\n&gt;   dodging it.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
