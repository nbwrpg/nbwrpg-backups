She looks at \nManterror.  For some strange reason, she felt sorry for him.  She knew he \nwas trying to kill her, but she still felt some pity for him.  It took most \nof her strength, but she finally stood up.  She aimed her gun at Manterror.  \nShe looked at him.  She stared into his optics.*\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t want to kill you.  Please don&#39;t make me kill you.  Just \ngo and fly away from here and leave us in peace.&quot;\n\n*A tear fell down her cheek.  It was partially from the pain from her \ninjuries, partially because she knew that he would still attack her and try \nto kill her.  She knew she had to kill him or be killed.  Somehow, \nsomewhere, she hated killing.  It hurt her to her core that she would have \nto take a life in order to save others. She raised her gun and took aim on \nManterror.*\n\n&quot;Please leave.  Go, fly away.  GO! NOW! PLEASE!&quot;\n\n*Tears started to stream down her face.  This was the part in war that she \nhated most of all.  But honor somtimes demands the most disagreable of \ntasks*\n----------Original Message-------------\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: NeO bEaSt WaRs RpG\n&gt;Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2000 13:46:16 EDT\n&gt;Injector/Manterror/Double Punch/Counter Punch:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector fell back from Triceradon&#39;s shots, falling to his back.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror fell back a foot as Dark Mouse shot him, raising his arms though,\n&gt;he took precise aim at the middle of the traitor&#39;s face.  Getting ready to\n&gt;fire and hopefully finish her off, several blasts sent him slamming into a\n&gt;tree.  Quickly assessing the situation, he fired an ion disk at Triceradon,\n&gt;though a few of the Maximal&#39;s shots sent him to the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Counter Punch got behind a boulder, Triceradon&#39;s shots chipping at it.\n&gt;Getting up, he had his missile launcher in one arm, a photon rifle in the\n&gt;other.  Firing two shots off at Triceradon from the rifle, and a rocket at\n&gt;Stegotron, he let out an almost silent cry as the combined kick backs \n&gt;hurdled\n&gt;him to the ground backwards.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Double Punch leapt over a log, slamming to the ground feet first.  Raising \n&gt;a\n&gt;pincher, he launched Beeline, his cyber-bee to take up the fight as he \n&gt;slowly\n&gt;advanced.  Taking flight, the cyber-bee scanned the area of Manterror&#39;s\n&gt;coordinates.  Activating its laser weapons in its optic sensors, it \n&gt;acquired\n&gt;a target.  It dived, firing a single optic blast at Striker.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
