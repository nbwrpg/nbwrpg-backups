A mouse I might add who put the defence systems \ntogether and could defend the base from the main computer console while you \nwere away.  I was also telling Scorponok that you had gone to attack the \nMaximal base as you instructed me to do.  But you&#39;ve returned, and with \nminimal damage.  I did take the liberty of charging up a CR chamber for you \njust case you needed it.&quot; She was standing with in a few feet of Megatron.  \nShe just stood there, she saw the look of anger on his face.  But she wasn&#39;t \nafraid anymore.\n&quot;Also Quickstrike has yet to return to the base.  If you command me to do \nso, I can try to hale him for you and find out what is going on.&quot;\n\n\n---------Original Message------------\nFrom:   &lt;JP3884@a...&gt;\nDate: Tue Jun 27, 2000 0:08am\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n::: Megatron barged back into base in his large beast mode, followed by\nWaspinator.
