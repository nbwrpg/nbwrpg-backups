He\nswears to himself. This was quite enough. Megatron didn&#39;t say to\ndestroy, he said to attack.\n\n&quot;Decepticons, we&#39;ve done enough damage,&quot; he says aloud, since\ncommunication was still being jammed by the Element. Speakers on the\nfront of his vehicle mode project his voice all over the battlefield,\n&quot;Lets get out of here.&quot;\n\nWith that he looks around and turns toward the Decepticon base, flying\noff toward it but looking back to see if there were any Decepticons\nthat would need help getting back.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Razorclaw::\n&gt; The explosions envelope the area around Razorclaw. He leaps \n&gt; backwards, dodging machine gun fire, and fires twice at Khonkolor \n&gt; and Haluicigen. He notices his charred armour, and wonders how \n&gt; much more of this he can take, how soon to pull out. &lt;Where&#39;s \n&gt; Autofire?&gt; he thinks, his eyes flicking around from the enemy he \n&gt; was fighting to the rest of the battle field.\n\n\n"}}
