WE WILL RETALIATE WHEN MEGATRON SAYS WE CAN!  \nRight now we have other things to deal with.  Megatron has left to \nattend to other things.  He will attack them and pay the bastards \nback when we can.  we are now down in nubmer and need to regroup.  \nThen we will attack and crush them like the worms they are.&quot;\n\nShe stood there glareing at him and ready to explode on him.

As I&#39;ve said before, I am \n&gt; really proud of everyone. Sure, we&#39;ve had misunderstandings and \n&gt; fights, but everyone really knows that it&#39;s all about having fun. \nWe \n&gt; we&#39;re all excited about the get together in the chatroom thing, but \n&gt; now that summer&#39;s over it will be too hard to do. So this is my \nidea \n&gt; now. We add a bit to the members page. We each e-mail in something \n&gt; about ourselves, what we&#39;ve done here, what we&#39;d like to do and \n&gt; anything else you want to say. Pictures would be great. If anyone \n&gt; else has any ideas, please say so.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois turned to Child, confused at first, but than shocked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Child! Did a voice in your head tell you that?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq heard Ramulus. He looks over his shoulder to find him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh good! We thought we&#39;d lost you. Come on, Brix is waiting.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq guides Ramulus to the bridge.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream watched the battle from inside the cave. When the bot \nthat \n&gt; was leading in Megatron&#39;s place returned, he went to her full of \nrage.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thos bots outside made you kill one of our one kind. We should not \n&gt; let them get away with that! Let me lead everything we&#39;ve got out \n&gt; there in a counter attack!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Noble/Savage\n&gt; \n&gt; For years the organic beast had been lurking in the shadows of Past \n&gt; Earth, with only vague memories of what happened to him on \nCybertron \n&gt; Being in contact with a spark. Having it removed, and letting him \nuse \n&gt; his body freely. Than being encaged by Maximals. It doesn&#39;t \nremember \n&gt; how it got here though, only that bots are here and they are \nfighting \n&gt; each other. He has been watching the battles. Watching defenses \n&gt; crumble. Now it was his turn. He is too animal-like to make a plan, \n&gt; only wanting to destroy. Now is the time. Bots would pay for \n&gt; tormenting him on that starnge metalic planet. The beast Noble, and \n&gt; the monster Savage, would now destroy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Beast started running towards one of the bases.(The Ark)\n\n\n"}}
