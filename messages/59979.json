Now was not the time to dwell on lost, \nlost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; crushes or cravings. Now she was setting herself to be in \ncommand \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a group again. She hoped that with hard work, she would again \n&gt; rule \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over a group of predacons and bring them to victory over the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximals. Which was her spark&#39;s fondest wish  for her \neverntual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; future. She refocused her optics and looked at Cooley.\n\n\n"}}
