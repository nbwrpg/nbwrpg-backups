I&#39;ll try to \n&gt; get back fast, but I don&#39;t want to promise anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heads back to the mess hall, where he assumes Talos is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Unit Blackfang ready for action, sir!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He goes looking for Talos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; Mess Hall\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Things were looking better in the mess hall, the salvagable \n&gt; chairs and\n&gt; &gt; tables were upright and the bar unit and energon stores were \nalright \n&gt; for the\n&gt; &gt; moment, but they&#39;d need to begin searching for reserves soon. By \nnow \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; reports of the communications repairs had filtered in as well as \n&gt; reports of\n&gt; &gt; the sensor enhancment to the north.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Looking around he nodded to those present and made his way \nback \n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; bridge. The first day of the new beast wars had gone smoothly with \n&gt; only a\n&gt; &gt; few minor problems left to deal with. First were the two younger \n&gt; bots on\n&gt; &gt; board, he had no idea how they got there, this wasn&#39;t a passenger \n&gt; ship but\n&gt; &gt; the fact of the matter they were here and that meant they had to \nbe \n&gt; included\n&gt; &gt; in the mission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     As he walked onto the bridge nodding to Sunhawk since he \nseemed \n&gt; to be\n&gt; &gt; looking for him he took his chair and turned to regard the \n&gt; leutenient even\n&gt; &gt; as he played over the second issue in his thoughts, Sunhawk was a \n&gt; wanted\n&gt; &gt; felon. He knew it and Sunhawk knew it. However he was willing to \n&gt; give any\n&gt; &gt; bot, no matter the tarnish on his or her record, an opportunity to \n&gt; prove\n&gt; &gt; themselves. He held no doubts that Sunhawk would be taken into \n&gt; custody by\n&gt; &gt; the port officials when the mission was done with, but depending \non \n&gt; how the\n&gt; &gt; bot held himself during this mission would decide wether or not \nhe&#39;d \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; Talos&#39; good word put in for him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Turning he noticed one of the consoles blinking, turning \n&gt; distracted from\n&gt; &gt; his thoughts and Sunhawks report as he investigated. A weak signal \n&gt; was being\n&gt; &gt; caught by the new arrays dish. It seemed like an outdated distress \n&gt; beacon\n&gt; &gt; signal and maximal in design, but this algorithim hadn&#39;t been used\n&gt; &gt; since...the original beast wars.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Talos rose shaking his head, impossible. There&#39;s no way one of \n&gt; Primals\n&gt; &gt; crew could still be here could there? He couldn&#39;t chance it. \n&gt; Pressing a\n&gt; &gt; button on the comm he spoke, &quot;Hot Rod, Blackknight, report to the \n&gt; bridge for\n&gt; &gt; new orders.&quot; Sitting back in his chair he turned back to regard \n&gt; Sunhawk.\n\n\n"}}
