His massive hands denting the hull as he pulled it against the\nocean floor. He went about his task in utter silence, his face showing\nno emotion, just a neutral mask, as he did what the words repeated in\nhis head. &quot;Just drag the ship in that direction.&quot; it told him. He could\nbarely comprehend the sentence but once he began to pull it, his\ninstincts kicked in, and all of his raw power, his hydrolics burned\nenergy for this one task, using the current and density of the water to\nhis advantage to lift the impossibly huge object.\n\n"}}
