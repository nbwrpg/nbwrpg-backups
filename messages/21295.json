He hadn�t missed the smile either, but at this \nmoment, smile or not, it was about time to cut the pleasantries and get down \nto business.\nHe had indeed followed her despite his systems warnings, clearly stated in \nflashing red letters on his internal screen. Constantly relaying that his \nbody wasn�t use to heavy traveling quite yet. But Dinobot had ignored it all \nand followed in Tavatrons wake, both to make sure that she didn�t run into \ntrouble but also because he shill wanted to know just why she had left him \nin his time of need.\nAnd he wasn�t going to drop the subject or let Tavatron leave until she gave \nhim the proper answer, which didn�t classify as gibberish. Which was what \npeople did sometimes when they didn�t want to speak about anything.\n\nDinobot watched Tavatron stretched her front paw one last time before she \ntransformed and turned to look at him,  her optics meeting nothing but a \nblank and emotionless glare from him.\nCompletely hiding the betrayal and complete loss for actions he felt inside, \nonly one question beating like his fastly paced spark in his mind. Why?\nWhy did she run away from me?\nWhy does she run away from her problems?\nWhy does she run away from who she is?\nAll of those questions ran through Dinobots mind faster then the beating \nache of pain in his side which was slowly fading, enough to move the clawed \nfore-limb from his side.\nNow being able to stand squarely.\nBut all of this, even his own actions puzzled him to a point. Never before \nhad he ever actually chased down someone to answer something in which they \nseemed to be running away from.\nUsually he would have just given up on them and basically thought to the Pit \nwith it!\nHe would have never been standing there right at that moment by the edge of \na cliff, glaring at the fembot whom he just COULDN�T give up as a friend.\nOr, perhaps it had been more then that. But either way, he was there now and \nhe wasn�t going back to base. Even though he had received that transmission \nfrom Kluster.\nThough, Dinobot did feel an impulse to obey that command, he wasn�t under \nthat Maximal�s rule; so his kindly worded request he would pay no heed to \nfor the moment.\nBut now it was time to get to what he had come there for, or at least the \nmain reason anyway.\nDinobot shifted his weight for a moment, wondering slightly if he should \ntransform as well, but the fact that he still needed time to heal keep him \nin beast mode.\nA growl emanated from his throat at Tavatrons words, the only reply to them \nwith which he gave. His glare continued for a moment to deepen the words he \nsnarled.**\n\n� In yet, I still receive no explanation for your action. When I am almost \npositive you expect one from me.�\n\n** Dinobot moved towards the edge of the cliff, passing Tavatron with little \nmore then a glance.\nHe peered over the edge of the rock drop, seeing the waving canopy of forest \nbelow. But then he raised his eyes from the hights and turned his head \ntowards Tavatron, them no longer narrowed but his voice just as flat as \nbefore. But his head was a bit lowered, almost as if somebot was forcing \nthis out of him, even though he knew that that one was himself.**\n\n� If it is an apology you wish, then you�may have it.�\n\n** She had no idea just how much will power he was using just to get this \nall out, so he hoped that if nothing more she appreciated it. Growling.**\n\n� I had�no right to attack your honor and place as a warrior back there. \nHowever, with your past actions, also including your current offence, I had \nevery right to have both of those factors in doubt. I fact, I still do.\nBut I still had no right to attack you like that.�\n\n** And that was as close to an apology Tavatron was going to get from him, \nfeeling no reason to say anything further.\nDinobot then turned his eyes towards the edge of the cliff once again, \neventually following a flock of small birds as they lifted from the forest \ntop and disappeared into the distance.\nBut then his eyes narrowed and he growled, either expecting Tavatron to \nquestion exactly what she had done in the past to make him question her \nhonor and skills, or to hear her take her turn at the apology. Though, \nbefore she could reply he had one more thing to apply. Looking over his \nshoulder at the fembot.**\n\n� However, I am very disappointed in you, despite my coming here.�\n\n** Turning his head forward again, his words said and over with. Now he was \nready to receive the question or the apology.\nEven to argue this out, as long as they did something, said something, got \neverything out in the open. As long as one of those was achieved then and \nonly then would he be satisfied.\nBut Dinobot hunkered his shoulders up a bit in annoyance anyway, still not \neven believing that this one bot, this WOMAN�had gotten an apology from him. \nOf all the things in the universe, there was nothing he hated more then to \nadmit his faults, for anybot.\nBut now he had done it, and if Tavatron said anything emplying that it was \nsweet or even nice, he was going back to base without her.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
