We cannot\n&gt; allign ourselfs with a Predacon fraction that wants to see all of us dead.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Megatron frowned. Mabey Hell Beast and Zardus didnt want to join the\n&gt; Newcomers, but Megatron did. They had a plan, a motive, and minions to get\n&gt; the job done. He only wished he had the kind of resources Set and Shuko\nhad,\n&gt; then mabey he could have gotten rid of the Autobots originally. :::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Megatron ::: Well, I belive that my fraction would be-\n&gt;\n&gt; ::: Marine ::: Your fraction consits of two other bots! Shredder and\n&gt; Quickstrike!
