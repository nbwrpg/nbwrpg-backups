Like a trained soldier, he imediately moved to cover and\nsneaked through the nearest gate into the city.\n\nTrying not to be seen, he immediately found a secluded space to walk;\nwhere he could move without being seen.\n\nOOC: I&#39;m hoping he can either encounter residents or other maximals,\nbut I guess anyone would be fine.\n\nOn 1/10/08, Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hatred.\n&gt;\n&gt; Over time, I found out that, on top of being a deep feeling, it is\n&gt; also a terribly useful tool. Sharing that hatred makes people see\n&gt; things you own way, and such an agreement is the beginning of an alliance.\n&gt;\n&gt; ********************************\n&gt;\n&gt; Magnum had been in relay for some time now. Despite his massive\n&gt; appearance, he managed to stay hidden most of the time. He was vaguely\n&gt; known, asa rumor in the hoodlums of the city.\n&gt;\n&gt; Little by little, he approached Silver Wings throughout the city. He\n&gt; spoke with them, listened to them. They had been ravaged by the\n&gt; uprising the Iron Skulls had lead and viewed Jotunn&#39;s demotion as a\n&gt; candy punishment. The perpetrators, the soldiers themselves, had\n&gt; barely been chastised for that, and resentment was strong because of\n&gt; this inaction among the surviving population.\n&gt;\n&gt; He agreed with them, and told them they should get even in one way or\n&gt; another. Like a prophet, people took him to heart and remembered him.\n&gt; He was hope for the wounded, the hope of recovery and vengeance. He\n&gt; only asked them not to speak directly of him. His influence grew by\n&gt; the cycle.\n&gt;\n&gt; *********************************\n&gt;\n&gt; Intelligence reports had been scarce inside the city. Deadfur didn&#39;t\n&gt; like that. They&#39;d lost contacts there, and he&#39;d decided to stay to\n&gt; help rebuilding\n&gt;\n&gt; When an agent told him someone looking like the missing Sergeant Ultra\n&gt; Magnus was talking of getting back at the Iron Skulls in the people&#39;s\n&gt; area, that worried him. But, he didn&#39;t want to take decisions on that\n&gt; himself. He went to Razorwing and handed him the datapad that\n&gt; contained the report.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deafur: What d&#39;you make of that? Should we worry?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
