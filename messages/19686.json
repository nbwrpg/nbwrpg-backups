He heard her speak \nso he knew her transformation was successfull. She stood taller than \nhim in her bear mode. he placed his hands on her wings, by all logic \nthey shouldn&#39;t have existed. somehow her memories triggered this \nchange. He scanned her entire body, it was healthy whatever she was.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know what you did to change the dna sequencing but somehow \nyour owl form showed up.&quot; His mind was filled with a thousand \nquestions but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to ask them all. &quot;Just rest \nfor now and when you&#39;re 100 percent we&#39;ll go outside and try out your \nnew form.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; She looked down and sighed heavily.  She missed him a lot and \nwished \n&gt; to see him again. Then again, he may not recongnize her in her new \n&gt; form. She wondered if he would still be happy to see her in her new \n&gt; form. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Yes, I understand. What am I supposed \n&gt; to do now? I&#39;m not fully complete yet.  This form is still \nchanging. \n&gt; and I don&#39;t know...&quot; she stopped and doubled over as she clutched \nat \n&gt; her stomach.  Her internal circuits were in the last stages of \n&gt; generation.  She held onto the table for suport. She fell to her \n&gt; knees nd transformed into beast mode. The form was in finally \nstages \n&gt; of completetion.  Normall a bot is asleep through this and doesn&#39;t \n&gt; experience pain, but she was wide awake and going through the \nordeal. \n&gt; She transformed into polar bear with the owl wings protruding from \n&gt; her shoulder blades. Her hands transformed into massive paws with \n&gt; huge claws.  Her white fur now covered her completely and her eyes \n&gt; were a pearcing bright blue. Her sence of smell and hearing was \n&gt; greatly increased and she roared out a bear roar as she finished \nher \n&gt; change.  She stood in beast mode and looked at Vertis.

You have a very unexpected form and will \n&gt; need time\n&gt; &gt; to adjust. Lunarpine is a bigbot that can take care of himself.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis studied the readings he&#39;d been taking the whole time she \nwas\n&gt; &gt; forming.
