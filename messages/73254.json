I&#39;m only getting limited scan=\r\nning\n&gt; range.  We should probably send out a general retreat order and assu=\r\nme any\n&gt; stragglers will rejoin us soon and we can lick our wounds.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\nere was a shake of his head, &quot;And we can compare stories back at base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hissing in light pain, VICE GRIP transforming, &quot;Where is CRYOTEK anyways..=\r\n\n&gt; He hasn&#39;t put in an appearance in quite a few cycles after we went\n&gt; und=\r\nerground.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKY SHADOW looked around as did the FUZORS, =93Hydras is=\r\n missing,\nCryotek is missing.=94 He frowned as he looked up to see the flam=\r\ning\nform of RODIMUS and the large scaly form of TUSCON in the air. =93This\n=\r\ndoes not bode well for us.=94\n\nINJECTOR, another of the FUZORS looked at DI=\r\nNOBOT, =93I saw Cryotek\ntrying to attack Optimus . . Nemesis . . .  what ev=\r\ner he wanted to\ncall himself, but I haven=92t seen him  since.=94\n\nThere wa=\r\ns a nod from SKYSHADOW as he looked at DINOBOT and then at the\nothers. &quot;Pre=\r\ndacons Retreat!!!&quot; SKYSHADOW sent across the radio along\nall PREDACON chann=\r\nels. &quot;Report back to base!&quot;\n\nSKY SHADOW and the FUZORS shifted to beast mod=\r\ne and began to move off\ninto the darkening day, fiery contrails of soot and=\r\n ash streaking\nacross the skies as a wave of magma set the trees and vegata=\r\ntion\nablaze!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson hears his voice and immediately realizes t=\r\nhat the bird is actually\n&gt; Rodimus.  He widens his eyes and dives toward hi=\r\nm, flying over his leader\n&gt; with out stretched wings, acting like a shield =\r\nto protect him and\n&gt; Nightlight.  He looks down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Sorry, slight miscal=\r\nculation, won&#39;t happen again.  I thought the clouds\n&gt; held water but they d=\r\non&#39;t .  If I knew there was water I could stop the ash\n&gt; and fire.  I must =\r\ntry to climb higher, beyond the smoke cover.  But first\n&gt; your saftey is mo=\r\nst imperative.  Get into my talons, you will be safe in\n&gt; there under my dr=\r\naconic armor.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He opens his talons to receive his comrades.  Ash rains =\r\ndown on his wings\n&gt; and back yet he ignores the sting and burn of their imp=\r\nact.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON tried to fly over and protect RODIMUS it is quickly =\r\nevident\nthat RODIMUS was much larger than he had been before! He was no\nord=\r\ninary sparrow or hawk but he was a giant phoenix with flamed\nslowing off of=\r\n his wings and entire frame like a bonfire. Only his\nclaws where he held th=\r\ne smaller form of NIGHTLIGHT was cool and dark.\nAlso the soot and debris th=\r\nat were falling seemed to be doing little\nto RODIMUS as they quickly turned=\r\n to ash and char when his flames hit\nthem.\n\nThey both were flying above and=\r\n yet away from the Volcano.\n\n=93I do not think a simple rain will stop this=\r\n volcano.=94 RODIMUS said\nhis voice somehow wiser and deeper than it had be=\r\nen before. =93It is\npurging itself of a dark menace.=94\n\nEven as RODIMUS sp=\r\noke dark magma began to flow from the mountain.\n\n=93Come, we must get the r=\r\nest of the Maximals to safety.=94 RODIMUS flew\ntowards the others as the sk=\r\nies continued to darken and the ground\nbegan to turn black as it rained ash=\r\n and fire. &quot;We can do nothing but\ntry to heal and get everyone away from he=\r\nre.&quot;\n\nWith the ash falling and small burning bits of fire and brimstone,\npl=\r\nus the Magma flows this area will be dangerous until the volcano\nfueled sto=\r\nrm abates. Smoke was begining to rise from the ground as\nburning trees fell=\r\n and burned.\n\nOOC: To anyone using sensors or communications it is possible=\r\n but\nspotty. The ash still seems to have at least some of the properties of=\r\n\nthe interior of the Volcano and the distortion field that was up\npreviousl=\r\ny. IE: Sensors and radios work, but distance is shorter. It&#39;s\nlike trying s=\r\nee through a heavy driving rain.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
