Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero tempatures of space.  The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing the airlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the ground.  Hellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a room, someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.  His left shoulder was nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of semi organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.  Hellplague look disapprovingly at the sight and then turned to Splattercannon.\n&quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you can repair him.  I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;\nSplattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.  For a moment they both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before them.\n&quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; Necross said before turning to leave.\nSplattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before addressing him.\n&quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.  For whatever purpose, she wants him alive.&quot;\nNecross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his companion&#39;s grip.\n&quot;Not my problem.&quot;\nSplattercannon fumed a moment as Necross set off for parts of Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon storage.  He gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s new residence.  He dumped them all around the hunter and went to the Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\nMalice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred somewhat, but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.  He tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he settled for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to it, and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder immediatly began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, but they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and scooted to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back onto the bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles and then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on his wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his arms and legs were not going anywhere.  Hellplague smiled and straddled the\n hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting herself with her arms resting on his chest.  \n&quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little lizard and stay here where I can watch you.&quot;\nShe leaned down until her face was inches from his.\n&quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a devious smirk.\n&lt;Tag minions&gt;\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\r\n--0-164031072-1084569295=:73989\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Malice/ Hellplague/ Splattercannon/ Necross:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Malice was in stasis lock when Splattercannon exited the atmosphere.&nbsp; Thus he was spared the pain of the sub zero tempatures of space.&nbsp; The minions returned to Unicron, and after closing the airlock, Splattercannon transformed, dumping Malice on the ground.&nbsp; Hellplague and Splattercannon drag his battered body to a room, someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.&nbsp; His left shoulder was nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of semi organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.&nbsp; Hellplague look disapprovingly at the sight and then turned to Splattercannon.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you can repair him.&nbsp; I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.&nbsp; For a moment they both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before them.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; Necross said before turning to leave.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Splattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before addressing him.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.&nbsp; For whatever purpose, she wants him alive.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his companion&#39;s grip.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Not my problem.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Splattercannon fumed a moment as Necross set off for parts of Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon storage.&nbsp; He gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s new residence.&nbsp; He dumped them all around the&nbsp;hunter and went to the Repair bay to nurse his own&nbsp;injuries.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Malice finally came back online.&nbsp; His vision was blurred somewhat, but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.&nbsp;&nbsp;He tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he settled for wiggling over to the closest cube.&nbsp; He touched his foot to it, and began absorbing the energy from it.&nbsp; His shoulder immediatly began to heal itself.&nbsp; He set up and tried to break his bonds, but they were nearly unbreakable.&nbsp; He scooted forward and touched several cubes.&nbsp; He quickly healed the rest of his body and scooted to the edge of the bed.
