Wake up!&quot;\n\n* She had heard the command from Rampage to fall back and she thought it \nwise to do so, but she was so proud that they had won anyway!\nBrightBlade shook her partner&#39;s shoulder again, it was now time to go back \nfor repairs.*\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* Rage watched as Scourge began to run towards the Predacon base, was she \nrequested to follow?\nHis words were now understandable but they were still a little hard to \ngrasp, but she now felt shaken and vulnerable in this new form. She didn&#39;t \nwant to be left alone, not like this!\nRage then began to follow Scourge towards the Pred base, at least she then \nwas with something that could help her understand this new body.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
