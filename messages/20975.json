She felt her spark break, but she didn&#39;t want to show \nit to him. She thought that he wouldn&#39;t care anyhow. She said in a \nquiet voice. &quot;I&#39;ll follow you commander, where ever you lead, I&#39;ll \nfollow.&quot; She didn&#39;t look back up at him. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike glared a little harshly at Dark Mouse. He didn&#39;t like \nthe \n&gt; sound of this, but he had a feeling that Black Arachnia could \nhandle \n&gt; this. He knew how treachrous she was. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Listen,&quot; he said to her. &quot;She&#39;s mah mate an&#39; leader. Ah know she \n&gt; ain&#39;t on their side. Most certainly not on Hell Beast. He was gonna \n&gt; kill &#39;er. She&#39;s gonna do somethin&#39;, ah got uh feelin&#39;. Ah jus&#39; need \n&gt; t&#39; find out. Ah&#39;s been kept outta this fer some reason, but ah&#39;m \n&gt; gonna get inta it. Ah was busy back at base wit&#39; Rattrap. Black \n&gt; Arachnia ain&#39;t no traitor t&#39; us. Ah know she ain&#39;t. But if \nsomethin&#39; \n&gt; goes wrong, an&#39; ya think somethin&#39;s gonna happen, ya can jus&#39; \nleave. \n&gt; Ya don&#39;t have t&#39; stick by me if somethin&#39; gonna blow by yer head, \n&gt; hear? Ah&#39;ll stay &#39;til ah get uh gun t&#39; mah head, that&#39;s th&#39; way ah \n&gt; am. Ah&#39;m used t&#39; it. Ah&#39;m second in command, ah gotta stick by \nBlack \n&gt; Arachnia. But ah can still save mah own tail. Ah jus&#39; trust her a \n&gt; lot. Ya don&#39;t understand how much ah missed her. An&#39; ya don&#39;t have \n&gt; t&#39;. Ah jus&#39; need t&#39; get back wit&#39; her and find out what&#39;s th&#39; plan.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
