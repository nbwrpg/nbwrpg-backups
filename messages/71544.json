You&#39;ll be able ta defend yourself no matter if ya\n&gt; got energy weapons or not.  Your body,mind and spark become your most\n&gt; powerful defense.  You&#39;ll see when I do a few demo rounds with you guys.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He chuckles quietly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; let&#39;s hope Rodimus joins in and pays attention this time.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from BUMP as the CR chamber for NIGHTLIGHT buzzed, &quot;It\nis ready.&quot; he said without much expression. &quot;Go ahead and enter. It\nwill reconfigure you. However it will have to put you in stassis and\nreboot your systems.&quot;\n\nBUMP stepped over to help NIGHTLIGHT should she need it. &quot;I believe\nyour systems are strong enough to handle it now, but you will be\noffline for a short while.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
