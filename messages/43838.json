I think our friendship could \ndevelopp into an alliance.\nI am Gesper, Tripredacus by birth. Our faction has discovered, some \nstellar cycles (=)) ago the power of the Matrix. From that point in \nour history, we have linked ourselves with it. It has given us many \ngifts, and, in return, we have promised it to expand it knoledges to \nall Transformers. We would prefer to do it without violence, but we \nwill not refrain to use violence if that becomes necessary. I know \nwhat your positions are towards combat, but sometimes, fighting is \nnecessary. A blast of energy has been unleashed by a faction unknown \nto us against a base. They have sent a message to everyone on the \nplanet. They require us to join or to die. I was asked to tell you all \nthis and to get your position on the matter.\n\n\n"}}
