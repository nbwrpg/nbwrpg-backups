The ship was showed diferent \nrepair status.\n\nThe predacon leader opened his com link and said &quot;Gather all PRedacons that \nare fully repared  where you are, I&#39;m coming there&quot;\n\nIt was time to do something, and do it now\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Super Cyclonus\nSent: Thursday, June 16, 2011 1:36 PM\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Hydras and Predacons\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras was in his quaters with a foul mood when he opened his comlink and\n&gt; said &quot;Cyclonus... Report!&quot;\n\nCYCLONUS voice responded on the same frequency. �The ship is largely\nrepaired. It will not be worthy of flight just yet, but defenses,\nsensors and weapons are largely online.�\n\nThere was a pause from CYCLONUS as if he were perhaps consulting\nsomeone else, �The repairs to our personnel are also nearly done, only\nour most damaged soldiers are still in the repair pods, and they\nshould be out soon.�\n\n�Also.� CYCLONUS continued, his voice turning curious and surprised as\nhe spoke, �The reports from the battle scene we had discussed are\nshowing nothing. There are no bodies, no wreckage. The sweeps could\npick up residual energy reading from both Insectile as well as\nUniconrian sources, but nothing else. It is as if someone cleaned it\nall up.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
