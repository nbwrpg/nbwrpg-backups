She turned and glared at him.\n&quot;That&#39;s because I am one. I was talking to some friends who promised me a \nticket home, back to Cybertron.  But then HellBeast and his cronees came \nbusting in, accused us of mutany and told us to surrender or die.  I barely \nescaped out a ventalation shaft.  But in doing so I abandoned my friends.  I \nlet them die to save myself.  I was a coward.  I ran when I should have \nstayed to fight.&quot; She stopped yellingfor a moment.  But tears were streaming \ndown her face plates.\n&quot;I ran and left them behind to die.  I&#39;m a murderer alright.  I should have \nstayed to fight and maybe even die with them.  Instead I fled like a true \ncoward!&quot; She yelled the word coward.  She turned her back on Cybershark and \ncovered her face with her hands.\n\n\n---------Orginal Message------\nFrom:   &lt;Dachande85@a...&gt;\nDate: Thu Jun 29, 2000 2:40am\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n\n::CyberShark::\n\n    &quot;Wait!!
