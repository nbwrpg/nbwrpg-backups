Knowing that their only hope of survival was to\nsafely crash land, the pilot picked an open area of ocean and tried to\napproach at a safe angle to slow itself enough to keep the ship intact.\n\nLord Perseus and his crew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap\nbetween the part of the island where the hangers were located and the\npeninsula area where the base sat.  Suddenly the sky became dark and a\nrumbling noise could be heard, growing louder and louder.  He looked up to\nsee almost the whole sky occupied by a massive starship seemly heading\nstraight for the island.  The Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound and\ncivilians rushed to their shelters.\n\n&quot;Everyone!  To the base!  Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking out into a run.\n\nThe rumbling sound continued to get louder.  As Perseus and his crew reached\nthe base door, it was quickly opened for them then shut behind them.  He\nordered everyone to move the lower level of the base.  As the ship passed\nover the island, the sound grew so loud that the ground shook and weaker\nparts of buildings started to crumble, as in an earthquake.  The ship\ntraveled for another three miles before it touched down in the deep ocean\nwaters.  The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet below the\nsurface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on the top of an\nunderwater mountain.  The mass of water displaced by the ship started a\nmassive tsunami-like wave, going out in all directions.\n\nThe ground began to shake again and the lights flickered inside the Maximal\nbase.\n\n&quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing the last heavy door to the\nunderground section of the base.\n\nThe lights continued to flicker, then went out.\n\nAt that moment the ten-story-high wall of water struck Atlantis from the\neast, picking up all the boats in the harbor and tossing them onto the\nland.  The parts of the docks that were not made of concrete were pushed up\nand destroyed.  A moment later the water hit the buildings in the lower\nwharf area and they immediately collapsed under the intense weight of\nwater.  Likewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal\nbase was immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along\nwith everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the main\nbank of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n\nThe lower floor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from\nbombing, and as the water continued to pour over it, everything on the upper\nfloors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the bottom\nof the crater that was the base.  The buildings along the center of the town\nwere a little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged.  The\nhanger and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into the ocean.\n\nAs the water came to tower it filled up the deep trench around the structure\nthen the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except for the top five stories,\ndamaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroying the bridges\nthat allowed access to the tower.  The wave then continued across the rest\nof the island, destroying buildings and carrying away the mass of debris,\nand then all was eerily quiet.\n\r\n--0016362837a898f640046818baf2\r\nContent-Type: text/html;
