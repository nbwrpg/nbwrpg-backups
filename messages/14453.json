An annoyed hiss escaped her lips as she tryed to \nwriggle in her confinement, trying desperatly to get away from this light \nthe almost seemed to eat away at her very soul!\nHer wings stretched out on either side of her as she wriggled and squirmed.\nHowever, every action proved useless until she was finally fed up, opening \nher mouth and emitting a high pitched bat screem.\nRaising the pitch until, above, ever light in the room as well as every \nglass piece of equipment shattered.\nThe lights dimmed for a moment until finally going out, a sigh of relief \ncoming from the fembot strapped to the table.\nTHAT was better.\nShe would have raised her head to look around but there was a strap across \nher neck as well, however, that wasn&#39;t the only way that she could see.\nWith short little squeeks she sent little shock waves around the room, the \nwaves bouncing off of objects and returning to her with information about \nthe object it had bounced from.\nIt&#39;s size, shepe and depth.\nThe picture of the whole room forming in her mind from the info she \ngathered.\nThis strange room wasn&#39;t all that big, but it was large enough to house a \nfair sized Star Hopper.\nDesmonus sighed as she relaxed against the table, moving her wrists and \nankles now and again to loosen the straps.\nShe was hungry and needed to feed, and there had to be a bot or two around \nthis place that would eagerly offer up a pint or two of their mech-fluid to \na hungry fembot.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
