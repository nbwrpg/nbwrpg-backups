He \nbeat them here. He was probably better off walking back. Something \nmust have happened. But he didn&#39;t care. There was a rule, among many \nrules he learned: Only the strong survive.\n\nHe leaned on the entrance, ankles crossed, and putting weight onto \nhis shoulder. The ambient was silent and the clouds drifted slowly \npast.\n\nHe shook his head. The peaceful ambient made him feel strange. His \nbright crimson optics glowed in agitation. He walked off to the \nbunker where the ohers might be.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
