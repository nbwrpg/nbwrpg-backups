She heard noises but didn&#39;t care.  She was tired \nof not getting any assignments to do.  She walked outside the arc and went \nto the lake.  She swam in the cool water and played with the fish.  she \nloved just being able to swim freely and feel the water glide over her body \neffortlessly.  She felt like she could fly when she swam.  Her head broke \nthe surface of the water and she looked about.\n&quot;Hmm, no one about. This is good.&quot; She dove back under water and went down \ninto the depths.  She went up for air and went back down again.  She looked \naround and saw some trees that had fallen into the water and climbed over \nthen.  She found a tunnel.  Where it went to she didn&#39;t know.  She decided \nto wait before going in and exploring the tunnel. She wanted to make sure it \nwas safe so she sat on the shore bank and waited for a few moments.  If no \none came, then she would dive back down and explore the cave.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
