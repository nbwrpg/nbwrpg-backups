It was something she had never seen before, something that was new.\n She looked confused and worried as she saw the bot before her fall to the ground but then stood back up and smiled. The smile on its face had changed; it had gone from evil to more comforting and�nice. The female raptor listened to Octociz/Bronco speak and nodded, then watching in surprise as he transformed into a centaur.\nIt was all so strange and the least thing she had ever expected to happen.\nIron Raptor knew not to hurt this new bot, she would leave it to sort things out on it�s own. *\n\n� Yes. I�ll let you go. Do what you have to�just be careful.�\n\n* She watched as Octiciz/Bronco rode off into the distance but then turned back and looked down the cliff, if Tavatron were down there then she would have to let them know that everything was alright.\nIron Raptor sighed and looked at the small comp in her hands, now with no purpose but to be used later.\nIron Raptor opened her com-link to Tavatron, where ever she was in the area . *\n\n� It�s alright now, every thing�s sorted out. We can head back to base now .�\n\n* With that she simply put the computer back in her leg compartment and began to make her way down from the cliff, relieved that things had gone better then she had expected. * \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
