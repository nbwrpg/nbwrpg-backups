He started towards her\nslowly.\n\n      He was thinking about what Firearm said about two Maximals under\nattack.  Nobody knew his little secret.  This whole time, he had his mind\nconnected with the Cybertronian Fire.  He read the scanners.  The two\nMaximals under attack.  That was the Alliance&#39;s work.  Also, by this\nconnection, he now knew the Cybertronian Fire like his back hand.  He loved\nhis little mental ability.  He loved it so much, that it even scared him.\nHe also saw what was going on in just about every part of the ship.  He\nusually never paid attention to any of it, but he did like keeping a close\neye on things.  He ran up beside Feline.\n\n        He snickered, &quot;Still want that tour??  The one that Chordate\npromised but hasn&#39;t given you???  I can show you much of the ship.  Some of\nthe Maximals left, to go save fellow Maximals from the...Alliance!!  Hehe.\nI can show you around, if you want, beautiful,&quot; He said, grinning.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 18, 2000 2:36 PM\nSubject: CF.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Feline::\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked down the hall, swaying her hips and being as seductive as\n&gt; possable.  She walked towards the engine room.  Looks over her\n&gt; shoulder to see if Skulletron was following her or not. Then faces\n&gt; back down the hall with a slight smile on her face.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
