Now that he&#39;d added some cybertronian technology \nwith his systems there was a good chance that he wouldn&#39;t be blown \nout of the sky if he approached a predicon outpost.\n\nHis scans showed a 96% probability of Predicon locations. \n\nHis babies that he left behind conyinued to relay information to him \non a regular basis so he knew that Magmatrons guests turned down his \ninvatation. That would mean that Magmatron would be really pissed off \nwhen he realized Phobia didn&#39;t plan on returning.\n\nHe continues scanning the planet to find active Predicon signatures.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Cyber Claw:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyber Claw grinned at Hell Beast.
