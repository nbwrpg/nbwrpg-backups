Now they scrape by, begging for scraps.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They were indeed &#39;empties&#39; as Tankor called them, but most of them\n&gt; kept thier distance from Tankor and his troop, thier optics bright and\n&gt; eager. They looked to be all manner of shapes and sizes, some of them\n&gt; may have been construction worers, others may have been soldiers, but\n&gt; all of them looked tired, haggard, almost diseased. If this were a\n&gt; human town, humans might describe them as the wretched homeless\n&gt; beggers that clog the allyways of some of the bigger cities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tankor led Hydras and his team into the building, large doors slid\n&gt; open as he approached, and slid closed behind them, locking tight as\n&gt; they did so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tankor tiilted his head for a moment, a vacant look comming over his\n&gt; features, then he nodded and looked at Hydras, &quot;Your team will remain\n&gt; here, you will follow me to see Breakout.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
