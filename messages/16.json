My mistake. I&#39;m locked in on your signature, are \nthere any specific orders that you need me to follow? Any specific place you \nwish me to strike?&quot;\n\n* It wasn&#39;t long until Iron Raptor came to the clearing that the Pred base \nstood in and hid in the surrounding brush, she looked it over and judged \nwhere she should attack first.\nIf Liono didn&#39;t respond within a few clicks she would advance into the \nPredacon base and strike quietly, cutting the power and so on.*\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
