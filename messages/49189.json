Our first target for the Sarga will be a Vok \n&gt; emmisary named Meteera, but they figured we&#39;d also want to work on \n&gt; taking out Megatron, so we&#39;ve basically been designed as his \n&gt; executioner.  You&#39;ll find we&#39;re more than a match for him strength \n&gt; wise, we can follow every move he makes with speed, we at least as \n&gt; much fire power, and we&#39;re more capable of standing up to high \n&gt; temperatures such as his fire breath than other bots even other \n&gt; Transmetals, although nobot can take a direct hit from that and be \n&gt; TOTALLY unscathed, not even us.  Now take out the asteroids.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fires a mini plasma canon on his wrist at a nearby asteroid \n&gt; blowing it to bits, then his lower wings transform into automatic \n&gt; rifles and blast most of the rubble.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  I&#39;m trying to keep posting while I wait for the Vok Destroyer \n&gt; decesion if it ever comes.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I&#39;m still waiting on the Vok Destroyer decision.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:  The sparks continue circling closer until they connect and \n&gt; fuse \n&gt; &gt; into one.  Then a solid body forms around them.  Taller than \neither \n&gt; &gt; of there old ones it looks like an angel with 3 sets of wings, a \n&gt; top \n&gt; &gt; one being hawks, a middle one being owls, and a lower one being \n&gt; &gt; entirely cybernetic.\n\n\n"}}
