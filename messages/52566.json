The knife slashed his \nhand&#39;s back and drops of blood fell to the ground. The cyberwenom shot \nhit hard though. He countered with his two lasers which were now at \npoint blank. Then he started feeling dizzy.\n\nRagnar: Ragnar to any friendly, I have been hit bad. Need backup fast!\n\nKatya&#39;s attack being useless, she started running at about 100 mph at \nPumpskin. She planned on tackling him.\n\nBlackfang felt the pain of the blade slashing his abdomen. Then the \nlasers hit him. He flew backward a dozen meters and took a moment \nbefore standing up.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Riekan&#39;s got TWO blades.  Can&#39;t you read?\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gauss slug tags Riekan in the hip, and he takes to the air to \n&gt; compensate for the loss of mobility on the ground.  Then Fury \n&gt; attacks, slinging his lashknife in one hand and firing his \ncybervenom \n&gt; gun in the other.  The reasoning being, Ragnar couldn&#39;t very well \n&gt; dodge two simultaneous attacks if he couldn&#39;t see them coming until \n&gt; the last second.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pumpskin shortens his tentacles, using two of them to fend off \n&gt; Katya&#39;s weapons fire - as if another shot to the head could have \nmade \n&gt; him any loopier.  He uses one scimitar to parry and tie up the \n&gt; halberd and swings his other around to hopefully dig into \nBlackfang&#39;s \n&gt; side.  His eyes glow and unleash a blast at his new attacker from \n&gt; point-blank range.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ragnar transforms to man-mode and catches the blade just under his \n&gt; &gt; right arm. It digs and stays there. He manages to dodge the \nharpoon \n&gt; &gt; this time, but barely. He fires his autocannon again but he adds a \n&gt; &gt; Gauss slug. At this distance, there was no way Riekan could away \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; sonic iron bullet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The eye lasers catch Katya where her guts would have been and \n&gt; destroy \n&gt; &gt; the small laser located there. She aims her three remaining \nweapons \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; Pumpskin&#39;s head and fires.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Katya: Stravag! You machines take a lot, but I have something to \n&gt; pay \n&gt; &gt; with!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just then, Blackfang comes in, leaping and slashing with his \n&gt; halberd, \n&gt; &gt; trying to go for Pumpskin&#39;s tentacles. It would take more time to \n&gt; &gt; regenerate than with simple laser shots.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Riekan dodges to one side and launches his boomerang blades, \n&gt; &gt; followed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by another explosive harpoon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fury, still under cloak, dashes across the battlefield, \nintending \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; help his shark-friend.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pumpskin uses his longer legs to start closing the distance \n&gt; again.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya&#39;s fire impacts on his tentacles, but it turns out to be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasted effort as the damage regenerates within seconds!  The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; oversized Halloween reject returns fire with his own eye lasers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar had not seen the attack coming. In fact, he realized \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they had cloaking abilities. The harpoon exploded on his thigh \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hardly did more than to shed some armor off. He swung his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; autocannon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in line with the newly appeared Riekan and let go a double \nshot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; along \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with his two large lasers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: Maximals! They have more troops coming in, but these \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cloaking devices! Be careful!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other side of the battlefield, Katya barely escaped the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tentacles of the pumpkin bot. Her speed did help her greatly \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon was meters away from him. She aimed at the two nearest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; appendages \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tried to fry them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Stravag! Katya to Ragnar and Rodimus, I am being \n&gt; engaged. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit-and-run will have to wait a bit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang: Katya, I&#39;m coming to assist...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Neg! He is mine! Distract the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang saw the fake Optimus and fired his shotgun on him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar&#39;s only warning that he has a much closer opponent \nthan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39;s group is the distinctive &quot;k&#39;thunk&quot; sound of \nRiekan&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; gun \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; launching and explosive harpoon.  The shot forces him to \n&gt; &gt; decloak, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he retains most of the element of surprise.\n\n\n"}}
