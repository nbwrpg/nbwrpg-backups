So far, this was good.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he says in responce to Feline&#39;s question, &quot;Sabotauge would be too \ndangerous. Instead, you two are meerly scanning.&quot;\n\nHe looks at the two, wondering if they could pull this off. &quot;You two will \narrive at the Maximal base, posing as two Maximals.&quot;\n\nZardus looks at Feline, &quot;You shall use your charm, along with some help from \nSkulletron&#39;s abilities, to lure the Maximals into giving you two quarters. \nOnce inside, you will scan the ship, and use the computers in your quarters \nto find out as much as you can about it, the defences and everything. Get a \ntour if you can.&quot;\n\nHe presses a button on the holo-projector, the hologram disapearing. &quot;Then \nyou two get out.&quot;\n\nZardus looks at Skulletron, &quot;This is where your part really begins. On your \nway out, you shall tamper with the Maximals&#39; emotions. Make them mad at each \nother, or fall in love with different bots.&quot;\n\nHe presses another button on the holo-projector, an image of Iron Raptor \nappearing. &quot;This is their leader,&quot; he says, pointing to the projection, &quot;If \nyou can make them fall in love with her, it would make a good amount of \ntrouble between the Maximals. But don&#39;t overdo it, if they&#39;re killing each \nother in the halls, you&#39;ll have trouble getting out.&quot;\n\nZardus looks at the two bots, &quot;Any questions?&quot;\n\n"}}
