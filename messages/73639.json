RAT TRAP could make out the\n&gt; &gt; sound of laser=\r\n fire coming from that hole, someone was in the middle\n&gt; &gt; of battle!\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Dimly he could the voice of RODIMUS could be heard giving orders, but\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; it was difficult to make out what. However he could definitely see the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; flashes coming from it! It looked like RODIMUS and probably PERCEPTOR\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; were under attack.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The hole was easily twice as big as RAT TRAP =\r\nshould he choose to go\n&gt; &gt; through the hole.

One was to\n&gt; &gt; get into the outer cave that held the m=\r\nine shaft. Once you entered the\n&gt; &gt; mine shaft itself there was a tunnel. I=\r\nn the middle of that a cage had\n&gt; &gt; opened up to catch Nighshift a while ba=\r\nck. Perceptor also dug a second\n&gt; &gt; tunnel around that one as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Rat Trap is at the opening of that second tunnel at the cage. On the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nother side of the cage and around the corner he can see the lights and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsounds of some sort of firefight.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a =\r\nhiss from DINOBOT, &quot;Acknowledged.
