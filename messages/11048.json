She turned and looked at the Ark,\n&quot;Well, what&#39;s left of it anyways.&quot;\n\nShe looked at Striker, &quot;How soon until Ramulus gets here? THe sooner \nhe arrives, the sooner we can get the plans into action.&quot;\n\nShe walked to the entrance and went inside the ark.\nShe was starting to get mad at herself.  Another hostage situation, \nand she once again had to back down from a pred.  This was getting to \nher.  She had her spear in her hand and stuck into the wall in the \nhallway.  She left it there and walked to her quarters.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Rod sees that the battle is over.
