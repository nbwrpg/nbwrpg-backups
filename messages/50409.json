But Rauq, even you have to admit that \nHNC&#39;s \n&gt; inaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to read the first \n&gt; line, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s start-up is the most \n&gt; over-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all you need is a shot of \n&gt; Dr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a ripoff of every \nsingle \n&gt; horror movie out there.  \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as characters are concerned, Terminion and \n&gt; Skullertron/Slaughter actually display both personality and \n&gt; potential.  The remaining four have been cannon-fodder thus far.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to prove me right or \nwrong \n&gt; by roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a serious RPG, not a \n&gt; slapstick movie, so if I see another post/exchange like HNC&#39;s first \n&gt; one, where everyone involved is an absolute idiot, I will ingore \n&gt; every post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s) regardless of who \n&gt; they are or think they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering. Megatron is waiting \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of which are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt; &gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post about right now, but \nI \n&gt; &gt; still have to read the posts up till when i last checked em.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this obviously aint \n&gt; &gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises verbal shields*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease fire in this flame \nwar \n&gt; &gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it started wrong right \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have been said, were \n&gt; said, \n&gt; &gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at defusing the \nsituation \n&gt; &gt; and it blew up. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting style, that&#39;s your \n&gt; &gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with a bunch of \n&gt; &gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the way you&#39;d like \n&gt; &gt; him to post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting, if you want to \nsay \n&gt; &gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find it really hard to \n&gt; &gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the same context.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut up about this \n&gt; &gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing. Nothing anyone \ncan \n&gt; &gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; &gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
