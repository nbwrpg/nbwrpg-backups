Also I was wondering at how much =\r\nyou know about the BW&#39;s toon, so I know if I have to feed you any backgroun=\r\nd information from time to time. I just wanted to be sure we are on the sam=\r\ne sheet before we stepped forward :)\n\nAlso as for the rest, I know Airly ha=\r\ns some stuff that she is trying to accomplish as well as Sandy and Kraftlos=\r\n, as I have gotten stuff from each at different times. My goal is to touch =\r\non all of them, and keep it fun as much as I can. I am not GMing, but I am =\r\ndoing as much as I can to keep stuff moving - much like I did before. \n\nThe=\r\n question I have is: What does everyone want to see from this and from me? =\r\nIn other words: What are your thoughts?\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
