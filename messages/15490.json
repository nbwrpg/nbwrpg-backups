Good \nnight^_^)\n\nTavatron growled in anger and returned as much of Dark One&#39;s fire as \npossible. This was getting out of hand. Her sensors were inoperable, Dinobot \nwas severely injured, and they were still miles from the base. All she could \ndo was hope they could hold out long enough for help to arrive, that is if \nthey even noticed they were missing.\n\nHiss&#39;s shots catch Tavatron off-gaurd, sending her into a roll that ended \nwith her sprawled a few feet from her previous location. She quickly righted \nherself, paying her scorched armor no attention as she concentrated on the \nbattle before her.\n\nTavatron was trained for close combat, and wouldn&#39;t last long in a \nlong-range battle. The enemy had to get closer, then she could do some real \ndamage. Until then her only weapons were her optic lasers. Tavatron \ncontinued to charge and fire multiiple energy bolts at the approching enemy, \nall the while wondering if Dinobot was allright .She didn&#39;t know exactly how \nmuch fluid he had lost, but judging from the amount that covered his \nchest-plate he had been bleeding for quite a while.\n\nTavatron snarled under her breath as she waited for the arrival of help, or \nmore enemies. There was one thing she was sure of, she had not intention of \ndying today, or of letting Dinobot throw his life away in an attempt to save \nhers. This was as much her battle as it was his, and though she greatly \nappreciated and often times welcomed his help, when it came down to it she \ncould hold her own.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
