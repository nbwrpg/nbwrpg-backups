He looked around the area, with the heavy work going on. He \nremembered having ranks and jobs like that. And in surprise, he was \nglad to do things like that. It was because there was nothing else to \ndo. \n\nHe stared for a while. And to think, he had no complaints with his \nrank when the orignial Beast Wars was in place. Things were different \nnow. Some things he didn&#39;t understand. \n\n&quot;Well wanna show me where they are?&quot; he asked Paralysis, almost in a \ndemanding tone. He looked back and took a step forward. &quot;Got any \nextra fliers? Dark Mouse might need uh lift here. Ah got here faster \nthan she did. Figure that.&quot; He chuckled.\n\n\n"}}
