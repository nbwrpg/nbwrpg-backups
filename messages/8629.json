He heard the shot ricochet\n&gt; inside of its shoulder. It turned its head to Rowdy Wolf, with two beady\nred\n&gt; eyes glaring at him. He froze for a second, then came to again. &quot;Get out\nof\n&gt; here! Go!&quot; He waved his arm in the air. &quot;Slag it, run!&quot; he shouted a the\n&gt; others. He fired again, onto the Metal Beast&#39;s leg as he stomped towards\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Terrorsaur didn&#39;t seem like he was going to stay. He paced in mid-air,\n&gt; trying to study the Vok creation. He flew over top of Stingtra&#39;s head. He\n&gt; flew down and slashed at the wires that connected to Quickstrike&#39;s head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Blow the cavern!&quot; he shouted. He flew to the side and turned his shoulder\n&gt; cannons at the wall of the cavern. He fired multile times.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
