He comm&#39;s \nFirestrike, &quot;Firestrike, get back to the control room, and try to \nfind out where Nightstrike is, last I remember he was at the IGL, \nbut after that... Anyway, I&#39;m going to fix Perceptor now.&quot; He leaves \nthe wirey inards of the ship hanging out of the control panel, and \nexits out the control room door. He walks down the hallways till he \ngets to the elevator. He heads down the elevator to his Lab \nquarters. \n\n&quot;Hmmm...&quot; thinks Switchblade as he enters his Lab. Perceptor was \nneatly attached to the table. The small dark bot grabs a few scrap \nmetal parts, and a few electronics, then starts working on \nPerceptor&#39;s head.\n\n\n"}}
