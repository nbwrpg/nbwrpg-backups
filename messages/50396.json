Why should I not just kill you now and \nbe done with it?&quot; He finishes figuring that Flicker wouldn&#39;t know \nthat they Preds had finished setting up their defenses.\n\nOff comm, &quot;Goood Perceptor, that means we now have two missile \nturrets, two laser cannons, and 4 auto guns. Sufficient firepower \nfor the moment.&quot; He turns to Quickstrike as the cobra-scorpion fuzor \nenters the control room.\n\n&quot;Quickstrike. Notify the rest of the Predacons that they are to \nreport to the control room. We will attack the Maximals soon \nenough.&quot; Megatron goes back to his scan, which has just finished. He \nexamines the offensive/defensive capabilites that the scanners were \nable to detect. (your queue Kyle, I dunno how much horsepower the \ncar that Flicker is driving has ^^)\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe flickering pulse of a laser welder casts an erie glow around \nSwitchblade&#39;s lab. The small black bot hadn&#39;t been out of the CR \nchamber long, but he had immediately noticed that further repairs \nwere needed, since some of his parts were destroyed when Megatron... \n&lt;No...&gt; he thinks to himself as he finishes up the addition of some \nnew parts to replace the old ones. Megatron was a problem which he \ncouldn&#39;t deal with at the moment, so he refused to dwell on it.\n\nClenching and unclenching his hand, he tested out some of the new \njoints, nodding to himself as they performed admirably as his \nrequest. The right side of his head no longer resembled the rest of \nhis head, a smooth silvery surface now covered the right side of his \nhead and flared out slightly behind his head almost like a crude \ndrawing of a birds wing feathers. His right eye was now surrounded \nby the silvery material, and it had a dark, enveloping, reddish glow \ninstead of it&#39;s original greenish glow, which his left eye still \nhad. \n\nHis vision shifted into a red blur as he tested out the new eye. \nIt&#39;s infrared capabilities were excellent, and he wondered if he had \nthe capability of shortening the wavelength even more. Shrugging \ncarelessly, he moves onto the next part switch. His chest plating \nhad been entirely destroyed in the blast, as well as his minor \ncloaking ability. Intead of trying to make another cloaking device --\n which he didn&#39;t think he had the parts for anyway -- he had modifed \na little thing he was working on. Something he called a Distort \nshield. Working in conjunction with two disks on his arms, it \ncreated a sort of protection field around him. THe only probem he \ncould see with it was that even if it could block an attack, who&#39;s \nto say that the attack wouldn&#39;t have enough force to knock him \naround anyway. He hoped he didn&#39;t have to test it out in battle \nanytime soon.\n\nSwitchblade looked around his lab, and his eyes fell onto his \npistols, which he put back into this hip ejectors, and then he sat \ndown, waiting for a summons from Megatron, who would probably \nrealize that the small bot would have gotten out of the CR by now.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Flicker sends another transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; Flicker:  I repeat we request permission to land.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
