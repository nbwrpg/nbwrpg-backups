He blinks as she asks him something, too engrosed in looking at her to \nbe really paying attention. Prowl blinks again, trying to figure out what she \nhad said.\n\n&quot;Huh? Oh. You can send Ramulus,&quot; he says, walking toward the table and \nsitting down near Iron Raptor. He wasn&#39;t sure if she was mad at him for his \ncomment or not, so he didn&#39;t make any further move toward her, &quot;He can deal \nwith Dinobot&#39;s attitude, and he&#39;s a good scout. He&#39;ll find them.&quot;\n\n"}}
