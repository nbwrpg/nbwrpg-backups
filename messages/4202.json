Sure I slashed at Liono&#39;s backside but who wouldn&#39;t? I\njust wanted to challenge him, and when he wouldn&#39;t accept, I drove my weapon\ninto his back. Doesn&#39;t everyone deserve a second chance?&quot; Plintissa looked\ninto Iron Rator&#39;s eyes and a tear falls from her face. Plintissa looks on as\nArtist comes into the room.\n\n&quot;I wish to join you.&quot; Artist says.\n\n&quot;My true love really is dead.&quot; Plintissa whispered...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Iron Raptor&quot; &lt;ironraptor13@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 22, 2000 9:50 AM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n\n\n* Iron Raptor looked back at Plintissa as she waited for Prowl to get a move\non, the words from her old friend&#39;s mouth surprising her a little. This\nfembot before her wondering what her position in HER army was? HER army?\nSince when was the Maximal force completely hers? She knew that she was one\nof those whom looked after the well being of the Maximals troops but she\nnever even thought that they would ever be hers.she even doubted that they\neven liked her.\nThe thought was new and she was even a bit flattered by the image of her as\na leader in other&#39;s optics but she doubted that they liked her and the\nthought was banished.\nIron Raptor shrugged as she then worked her hand in a bit tighter with\nProwl&#39;s. *\n\n&quot; I have no idea, I&#39;m not commander so I don&#39;t know what you position is.\nBesides, I thought that you were the enemy now?&quot;\n\n*But then her attention turned towards Prowl as she then felt his arm go\nslack as he had fallen, her optics full of concern as she watched him raise\nto his feet. She then braced herself as he used her for support, then\nbringing a hand around him to steady him further but with enough care that\nit would not hurt him too much. The feel of his ribs against her arm made\nher want to something that would take the pain away, something that could\ncomfort him into forgetting about the pain. The look on her face was that of\nlove but enough concern that it pained her just as much as his ribs did him,\nshe so wanted to just take the pain away.but she couldn&#39;t.\nBut with the explosion behind them she then moved off towards the base but\nat a pace that Prowl could easily keep up with, a small smile on her face to\nlighten the mood as a small comment formed in her mind. *\n\n&quot; I have something that&#39;ll take the thought of pain right out of you mind,\nbut I don&#39;t think that you can&#39;t handle it right now.&quot;\n\n* With that she looked over at him with a sly look on her face, she DID have\nsomething that could take the pain right out of his mind but this wasn&#39;t the\ntime or the place for something like that. A small chuckle escaped her\nthroat as they neared the doors of the Ark, though not sure if he was in the\nmood for a small pun.\nWith the end of the chuckle she then came up to the doors and watched them\nopen, then moving into the base with Prowl in toe. The CR chambers came into\nsight and she sighed; now they could relax and repair. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\naddress on the Net!\nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
