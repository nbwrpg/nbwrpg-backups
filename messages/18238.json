She had little knowlage of the discussion about going into \n&gt; stasis.  She simply kept walking, and didn&#39;t reply.  But she was \n&gt; starting to get worried about these momentary black outs.  While\nher \n&gt; trainer side stayed ever alert to what was going on. But she \n&gt; remembered being told that she was going tothe Cybertron Fire just \nto \n&gt; get checked out.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So how is Cybertron Fire. Hope everyone back there is o\n\n\n"}}
