(so no one can land on it now).  Mi=\r\nssile\nbattery #2\n&gt; close to the tower opens fire first, six anti-aircraft m=\r\nissiles fly\ntoward\n&gt; Scourge.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Scourge strafes Ravenchief, he does a=\r\n sort of mid-air front-flip and\n&gt; flies above Scourge as he passes by.  He =\r\ncontinues to fire at Cyclonus\n&gt; launching a couple missiles from each of hi=\r\ns arm cannons and flying\ncloser\n&gt; to his target.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Perseus hurries =\r\nup the ramp with his troopers and takes a good hard\n&gt; look at the battle th=\r\nat has already started.  He motions to one of the\n&gt; troopers, who immediate=\r\nly takes off down a side-alleyway, the other one\n&gt; follows him to the centr=\r\nal roadway in the city and they look for cover.\n&gt; \n&gt; Salveo radios the alli=\r\nes at the other Maximal Base.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are under attack from multiple minio=\r\nn targets.

Also =\r\nI have to\n&gt; &gt; assume that Doc is firing at the sweeps, which btw look almos=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; identical to Scourge, since Doc is some distance from Scourge and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n cannot see him from his vantage point. If that is incorrect please let\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n me know and I will make changes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the air sweeps co=\r\nntinue to rain firepower on city below. In some\n&gt; &gt; places people are conti=\r\nnuing to be corralled into larger building\n&gt; &gt; structures, while in other p=\r\nlaces the sweeps fire with seeming\nabandon.\n&gt; &gt; With a frightening intellig=\r\nence a few &#39;wings&#39; of sweeps break off and\n&gt; &gt; begin to target the anti-air=\r\ncraft batteries, disintegration beams\n&gt; &gt; cutting through skies like energi=\r\nzed ginsue knives.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile in the air a short distance from the m=\r\naximal base\n&gt; &gt; Ravenchief&#39;s volley of missiles flew at Cyclonus, only to b=\r\ne evaded by\n&gt; &gt; the craft. Boosters flared as Cyclonus swung to one side, a=\r\nllowing the\n&gt; &gt; missiles to fly past him. With a short burst of cannon fire=\r\n he blew\n&gt; &gt; them out of the sky, and then he continued on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However=\r\n Ravenchief was not to be left without company, Scourge banked\n&gt; &gt; around a=\r\nlso, his sweep craft uniquely agile and swift. As he came\n&gt; &gt; around a red =\r\ntargeting laser blared out &#39;painting&#39; Ravenchief,\n&quot;You are\n&gt; &gt; a fool to st=\r\nand against us Maximal! You only have termination to look\n&gt; &gt; forward to!&quot; =\r\nScourge opened up with his acid cannons!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the shoreline the sweep=\r\ns lost interest in searching for Trelos,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps they lost his scent, s=\r\no turned their attention to Doc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Doc&#39;s blast lanced out, catchin=\r\ng one sweep in the wing casing it to\n&gt; &gt; smoke a little. Meanwhile the unmi=\r\nstakable smell of acid began filling\n&gt; &gt; the air as red targeting beams dan=\r\nced around Doc&#39;s position and two\n&gt; &gt; other sweeps began to open fire on Do=\r\nc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the railing above Doc&#39;s position, Kup managed to hit one of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; sweeps but the other - either it was more agile or more lucky - but =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; managed to avoid him. Even as that happened several other sweeps swu=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; into position ready to open fire as targeting beams lanced out again=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; but just suddenly they broke position!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reason for this be=\r\ncame more evident as the now open air\nrippled and\n&gt; &gt; twin missiles approac=\r\nhed Kup and Rodimus&#39; positions, fire and wind\n&gt; &gt; trailing behind them like=\r\n a vortex. As the missiles approached it was\n&gt; &gt; obvious that they were the=\r\n same type of missiles fired from Cyclonus\n&gt; &gt; earlier and that these missi=\r\nles were going to do quite a bit of\ndamage!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the Maximal base, sw=\r\neeps continued to pound on it in an attempt to\n&gt; &gt; break its shield defense=\r\ns!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Don&#39;t forget Nightstrike and Darkfate were commanded by Cyc=\r\nlonus\n&gt; &gt; to either take the Maximal base or Destroy it with the help of th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; sweeps left behind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
