He saw Depp \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;went towards him and aimed agaisnt his stomach, he covered it with a \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;wing while he moved to a side.

He fired 5 times against Barrymore, 5 to Alba, 5 to Lee, 5 \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;to Stiller, and 5 against Depp. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;After that he fell on his back.
