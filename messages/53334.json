I figured that. Just wanted to verify.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Placed the shuttle upon Automatic for a moment as she went over to \n&gt; another \n&gt; &gt; computer to analyze the data she gain after making a brief hack \n&gt; into the \n&gt; &gt; memory core. Plus her little run in with Alpha Trion & Vector Sigma \n&gt; gave her \n&gt; &gt; a little insight. But .. not much. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She gazed at the screen after entering the information. According \n&gt; to records, \n&gt; &gt; several were run off of Cybertron & to... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Earth,&quot; she was stunned to see the information. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moving back over to the controls, she punched in the coordinate for \n&gt; Earth. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; **************************\n&gt; &gt; After some time of space flight, the shuttle neared Earth. Maxima \n&gt; walked \n&gt; &gt; towards the controls-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKKREEE!! SSKKREEEEEEE!!!SSKKREEEE!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The ship shuddered as the alarms sounded. She stumbled as she made \n&gt; her way to \n&gt; &gt; the controls quickly.

It \n&gt; tumbled \n&gt; &gt; for a while, then it streaked towards Earth as it was pulled by the \n&gt; gravity \n&gt; &gt; of the planet. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Over the skies, a fireball was seen as the shuttle was burning up \n&gt; upon entry, \n&gt; &gt; eventually crashing into the body of land that would become the \n&gt; North \n&gt; &gt; America. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The ship smoked, the only passenger inside was offiline & \n&gt; unconscious. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I leave it up to who ever wishes to discover her first.\n\n\n"}}
