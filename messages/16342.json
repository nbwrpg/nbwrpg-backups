I understand. I&#39;ll just have hem get real \ndrunk and stumble around the Alliance base. As for how I know it&#39;s \nBob Skir, I went to www.bobskir.com, which is an actual website where \nyou can e-mail him questions. I&#39;ll put that up on the links in a sec. \nBut I told him about our anniversary and everything, and than he e-\nmailed me back saying he would love to go but had to check with \nmainframe and people about making this appearance, even if it is by \ncomputer. He&#39;ll e-nail me back in a few days.\n\nPrebon\n\nPrebon laughed at the demand.\n\n&quot;No way! Your little army out numbers the one I have with me. I \ncannot form Tamron because I have left two bots behind. As soon as I \ngive you Spears you will track me down to my base and attack so you \ncan get Striker. Well I don&#39;t think so. As long as their life is in \ndanger you will not attack me. One on one, one sector over here. A \nholo-map for two prisoners that could&#39;ve been mine. I think you have \npretty good deal there. Meet me ther in 2 mega cycles. Come alone. I \nwill.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
