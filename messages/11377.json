She shook and shivered as she was \nstill in a cold sweat.  Beads of sweat formed on her forehead.  She \nclentched her hand into fist. It felt good to be able to move a part \nof her body at will. She wispered to Black Aracnia,&quot;Please, I&#39;m cold.&quot;\nShe wasn&#39;t sure if the shaking was from the fact that she was cold or \nher body coming back to life. She knew she had died and had been \nbrought back, but more and more of the encounter she had was fading \nfast from her mind.  She closed her eyes and hoped the shaking would \nstop soon.  She reopened her eyes and looked at Black Aracnia, &quot;I&#39;m \nsorry.&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  \n\n\n"}}
