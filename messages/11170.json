Black Aracnia can only keep the peace for so long \nbefore the Terricons, Maximals, or whoever decide to thwart us for good!&quot; He \ncroaked.\n    &quot;What she is doing is to bring back the Predacons as they once were, in \nthe beggining. We need you, just as you need us, Megatron. Contact us soon. \nThings are getting worse by the hour, and if you dont take command then \nsomeone who dosent like you, or your fraction, might rise up.&quot; Paralysis \nsaid, desperately. If the Predacons didnt get reinforcements, soon there \nwouldnt be any Predacons left.\n\n"}}
