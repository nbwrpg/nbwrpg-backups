The pods outer layers glowed bright \nred as it heated up.  The pod decended to the ground below.  It \nstruct the ground with enough impact force, it created a crator 1/4th \na mile across.  As the dust settled, the pod cooled and slowly \nreturned to normal temperatures.  The bot inside was running internal \nand external diognostics.  Slowly, the pod opened.\nOut jumped a sleek, black bot.  She stood only 5 foot tall in bot \nform and had a sleek, streamlined look to her figure. She had a \nmatte, black finish on her body which gave off no reflection.  Her \npanther form stood out, even in bot form. She stood next to the pod, \nlooking in all directions.  She wondered where she was.  She was glad \nto have escaped the explosion on her ship. Now she had to deal with \nwhat ever lived on this planet. She noticed she hand landed in the \nmountains. Green meadows could be seen with flowers blooming in a \nrainbow of colors.  She reached down and drew her fiream.  She bore \nthe scars of many fights. She wasn&#39;t afriad of anything. She scanned \nthe area, but her scanners were still scrambled from the crash. They \nwould work in a few hours, but untill then, she would have to rely on \nher other resources. She sniffed the air, but smelled only the sweet \nfregrance of flowers.  She turned and saw a bird, small and blue, \ngliding lazily on the air currents.  She relaxed a bit, but kept her \nsidearm in hand.  Her maximal programming wasn&#39;t going to let her put \nher gaurd down. Not yet anyway.\n\nShe decided to scout the area and make the best of things.  She \ntransformed into a black panther and started heading East. \n\n\n"}}
