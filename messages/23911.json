They only paused once in a \nwhile to check their barings. They where getting closer to their targets and \nwhere getting their weapons ready to finish their mission when their \nscanners abrubtly stopped. They halted in confusion, not knowing where to go \nor what to do. They converged into a circle, surrounding their leader, who \nat the moment was checking with a small computer on his arm. He looked up \nand spoke to the crowd of looming doom.*\n\n&lt; The targets have built a scrambling device, we have to resort to a \nphysical ultra-viloet spectrum scan. Switch frequencies on comand...Now.&gt;\n\n* A wirring and buzzing sounded from their helmets, and they went limp, \ntheir systems matching their new sight program. After several seconds their \nheads snapped back up and they looked around and continued the way they had \nbeen going.*\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
