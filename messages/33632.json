Second thought, that sucked. Here we go. Alloran joined this RPG the\nsame time I did. We&#39;ve both known the hardships of working in the RPG and\nnot getting everything explained properly, the way it should be. Finally,\nwhen we learned, we both found ourselves still being harrassed for all the\nwrong reasons. KSLawdogg arranged one of Alloran&#39;s character&#39;s death because\nhe didn&#39;t like organics. Alloran has been the most patient, kindhearted\nperson I&#39;ve ever known. I once got mad at him when he told me that he had a\ncharacter named Snare and I took offense to it. But he instantly made me\nfeel like a mean spirited person by actually showing his bigness and telling\nme that he didn&#39;t mean any harm. Alloran is not someone you would have to\nargue with. The way he explains things tells it all. You won&#39;t get beaten\ndown verbally for asking him a question he doesn&#39;t like or accidentally\nmode. He&#39;ll merely state the problem and you&#39;ll find yourself with a good\nRPGer, who doubles as a fantastic person and friend, with extreme patience\nand understanding. Alloran would never treat himself superior over anyone,\nand will never insult your family because of some lame reason like &quot;you\nmode&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t like you, I never have,&quot; he&#39;s truly your best choice for\ncouncil member. And he&#39;s got my vote...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 30, 2001 11:39 PM\nSubject: Re: [NBWRPG] Election\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Vote for Alloran, because he really cares.
