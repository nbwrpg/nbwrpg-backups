He dumped them all around the hunter and went to the \n&gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \nsomewhat, \n&gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more alert.  He \n&gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \nsettled \n&gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to it, \n&gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder immediatly \n&gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, but \n&gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \n&gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and scooted \n&gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \n&gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back onto \nthe \n&gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles and \n&gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on his \n&gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \n&gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.
