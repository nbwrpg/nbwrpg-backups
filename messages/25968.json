Besides, look now! Serge has been taken \ncare of,\n&gt; there&#39;s no need to worry anymore. So let&#39;s just go back to the \nbase, now,\n&gt; okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge raised up as much as he could and fired at Perplex, knocking \nhim to\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge: Imperitent fools, you should have known you could not defeat \nsomeone\n&gt; with the power and intelligence of myself, you will regret the day \nyou even\n&gt; knew I existed! If there&#39;s one thing I learned from Deemos it&#39;s \nwhen to\n&gt; attack when they least expect it! And I taught myself how to hide \none&#39;s\n&gt; identity until the real personality is fit to escape! You have \nruined my\n&gt; plans, my beautiful plans to conquer and rule, and create a world \nfilled\n&gt; with nothingness! And now you die!\n&gt; \n&gt; Serge aimed at Windlord, but died before he could fire. Perplex \nflipped back\n&gt; to his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: What was that about?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex looked to Serge. Throughout all of his history, Serge was \nthe stupid\n&gt; one, the one who never spoke and the one who always tried to be \nhelpful. The\n&gt; crazy one, but never the wily one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: I guess we should go home now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone coughs and Perplex looks back at Serge. Serge was still \ndead.\n&gt; Perplex starts walking back towards the base...\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 21, 2001 1:47 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Clash and Serge + Cybertronian Fire battle...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Windlord::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It was my fault&quot; said the male &quot;I.. shouldn&#39;t have shot...
