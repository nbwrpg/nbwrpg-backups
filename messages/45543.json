As they walk \nthrough the walled corridors, Anachronox wonders how this base came \nto be. As they pass a fork in the passage, he ponders for a second on \nwhat the other passage lead to, &quot;Belthassan, does that other passage \nlead to a storage bay or something? Also, how did... no, how was this \nship created? It looks... odd.&quot; He frowns as he takes in the techno-\norganic base.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nPacifix is tapping his fingers on the console debating on what had \nhappened to Firedrill, and what to do next. \n\nHoist flickers into view beside him, &quot;Pacifix.&quot;\n\nPacifix jumps, &quot;Hoist!&quot; says the surprised bot, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;\n\nHoist frowns, &quot;I&#39;ve got an incomming comm from the Tripredacus... do \nyou want to take it now?&quot;\n\nPacifix nods, &quot;Sure, patch them through.&quot;\n\nHoist nods. A beeping sound comes out of the speakers and Hoist \nsays, &quot;Ok, go.&quot; and flickers out of view. Daemos&#39; voice comes \nthrough: &quot;Pacifix, we have found out what was going on in our Renewal \nChambers. The news I am about to deliver are not very encouraging...&quot;.\n\nPacifix nods to his diffuse friend. &quot;Your words alone indicate that \nsomething is wrong... so what did you find out about Firedrill? Is he \ndamaged or has something worst been discovered?&quot; \n\n--------------------------------\n\n&quot;... and that is about it about our base. Make yourself at home, and \nfeel free to ask as many questions as you&#39;d like. Pacifix, Hoist, and \nI (most of the time) will be around to clear any questions you&#39;ll \nhave up quickly and efficiently.&quot; Crossroads smiles to Gesper as he \nfinishes the tour with a run-through of his quarters.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Belthassan smiled: Good!
