The acid burned in her other \nshoulder.  She looked at Drill bit.  She felt pain surge through her \nbody.  She looked at Drillbit and then turned to look at Stingtra and \nthe others.  She felt the pain again.  She also felt tired and \ndrained.  She walked over to the tree and sat down at it&#39;s base.  She \nleaned back and rested.  She didn&#39;t have much energy left to fight \nwith.  With all the damage and loss of mech fluid, she would need \nhelp soon.  But she had to stay with her leader.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Mosquitor::\n&gt; \n&gt; Mosquitor&#39;s head detatches from his body, hitting a tree as the \nrest of him \n&gt; collapses on KitKat.\n\n\n"}}
