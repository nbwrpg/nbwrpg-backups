It had influenced Zardus to find that ship that he was in now with hopes of the Alliance taking it into their base. The mess that the Transformers had caused needed to be cleaned up.\n\nThere was still that little matter with the Ikoto, but the Vok didn&#39;t have a high regard of them in the first place; It wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had gotten bored and gave up on the bet. But the vok didn&#39;t care enough to go to Cybertron to see what was going on. Instead, it continued to concentrate on getting time as fixed as possible. Even with the Ikoto threat to Earth, there was no point in stopping what it had been doing for a while now.\n\n\n"}}
