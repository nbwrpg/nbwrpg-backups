I really wasn&#39;t planning on killing Vulois. He&#39;s just getting a\n&gt; personality change.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois saw them run out as the his clock ticked down. No point in\n&gt; sacrifing himself. With just under a second to spare, Vulois stopped\n&gt; his countdown to think.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I may still be alive, but what I said was true. My mission is over.\n&gt; There is no point in going back to Child now. We would just go back\n&gt; to the mountain and be prone for another attack. It&#39;s Child and\n&gt; Herald&#39;s turn to go about peace. I&#39;ve got nothing left except this\n&gt; mountain. Wait, I need to make it convincing!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois went to tank mode and loaded a rocket. He went down a tiny bit\n&gt; into one of the wrong tunnels, and fired. He was almost buried in\n&gt; rock. He was barely escaped as the rocket exploded just before it\n&gt; left the mountain surface so no one saw it. The explosion threw fiery\n&gt; pieces of rock into the sky. He hoped that at least some of them\n&gt; could die. But the important thing was....he was finaly free.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Convix? Are you there?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes Vulois, but I will be leaving you soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I keeping my powers?\n&gt;\n&gt; A small fraction of it as gratitude for your work. But once I leave\n&gt; you will be back to plain old normal Vulois, the Predacon.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what about the Peace Talks?\n&gt;\n&gt; Child will do it. If Nemesis doesn&#39;t bother him. Windrazor will se to\n&gt; it that he remembers the task.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what can I do?\n&gt;\n&gt; What woudl you like to do? You are free from your duty. You may do\n&gt; anything you like.\n&gt;\n&gt; I.....I want to go to Cybertron. There is work being done here, but\n&gt; not there. Both sides will have to work together in order for us to\n&gt; be saved from the nebula. I will start a small peace group there,\n&gt; focusing on organic parts. But...there is one other thing I would\n&gt; like to do first.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is that?\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to say good-bye to Battera and Cybershark. Before I go through\n&gt; The Gateway that we discovered, I will swing by the Cybertronian Fire\n&gt; and say good-bye.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you sure, Vulois? If you go, you may not like what you find. It\n&gt; may make you want to stay, and believe you have another mission.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I must! They have been the closest to me, especially Battera. I\n&gt; must see them, at least once, even if they are different.\n&gt;\n&gt; So be it. If you leave you will be seen. I will take you to the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hold on a sec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois went to bot mode and walked down that hallway, to find the\n&gt; drawing of AngelNemesis. He took his finger and begin to draw beside\n&gt; it. When he was finished, it was the picture of a small bot, casting\n&gt; out this monster form the land, and below it he wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;                     The Chosen Child will be our Saviour\n&gt;\n&gt; He spoke to Convix.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am ready. Take me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very well. When you get there, your power will be drained a bit and I\n&gt; will no longer be here to speak with you. Good-bye Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Good-bye Convix. Thank You for everything.\n&gt;\n&gt; And with that, Vulois vanished from the mountain, and from all of his\n&gt; friends lives.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
