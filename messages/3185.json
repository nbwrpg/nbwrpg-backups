Seeing\nSuukie\n&gt; on a screen he slammed a pincher on the ground.  &lt;Lord Hell Beast, the\n&gt; Maximal&#39;s &quot;allies&quot; are attacking us.  They&#39;ve tricked us!  Return\nquickly!&gt;\n&gt; Pressing a few buttons, all klaxons began to flash red, base defenses came\n&gt; online and opened fire on Suukie.  The intercom blared with Double Punch&#39;s\n&gt; steady voice.  ~All Predacons, this is Double Punch.  For now, I&#39;m in\ncommand\n&gt; until someone of higher rank relieves me.  We are under attack by the\n&gt; Maximals!  All forces are to take battle stations, and counter assault the\n&gt; enemy forces.  So far it just looks like a scouting party, but more are\n&gt; obviously on the way!  SO MOVE IT!!!~\n&gt;\n&gt; (I hope no one minds me doing this, on the Predacon&#39;s side that is)\n&gt;\n&gt; Injector jumped, having been in his quarters.  &quot;Maximals, hehe.  Time for\n&gt; them to feel my sting!&quot; he said, taking out his stinger missile launcher,\n&gt; heading for a hatch.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----\n&gt;\n&gt; Manterror in the engine doing routine check ups, hearing the intercon\nslammed\n&gt; his foot on the ground.  Pressing a few buttons, he set up a network of\nextra\n&gt; energy just in case the shields or weapons went down, he then headed for a\n&gt; hatch, banging on people&#39;s quarters and yelling brief explanations and\n&gt; telling them to &quot;Get the slag up!&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Remember Father&#39;s Day Is June 18th\n&gt; Click Here For Great Gifts!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5037/10/_/_/_/960763888/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
