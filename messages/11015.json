Randomly selecting a \nform, the scanning mechanism entered the pod.\n\nA cycle later, the pod opened, Caitiff climbing out of the pod, shaking his \nhead.  He had no idea where he was.\n&quot;Oh, by Primus, I&#39;m gonna die...I&#39;m gonna die!  On this useless jungle \nplanet!&quot; he activated his scanning equipment, and detected a base that gave \noff a Maximal energy-signature, not that far southeast.  \n&quot;Beast mode!&quot; Caitiff transformed into his chimpanzee mode, climbing up a \ntree, soon swinging from the longer branches to other long branches, heading \nfor the Cybertronian Fire.\n\n\n\nCaitiff\n\n\n\n\nName: Caitiff\nGender: Male\nAlternate Mode: Chimpanzee\nAllegiance: Maximal\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nCharacter History:\n\n\nCaitiff is fifty-six years in age, relatively young in Cybertronian society.  \nBorn in the province of Polyhex, he lived through a Predacon purge in Maximal \nlaw enforcement agents in that area.  Being an officer, he went out on the \nstreets to combat this, and watched several of his best friends die in the \nline of duty.  When being pursued on foot, he hid in a corner, and nearly \ndied, until military intervention stopped his demise.  Caitiff has been \nafraid of all Predacons ever since, and quit his job as an officer and became \nan electronic repair-bot, repairing broken stuff, and he also took up a hobby \nof Second and Third Cybertronian War equipment.  He can repair even the most \ndamaged of stuff, as long as there&#39;s something to repair.\n\n\nCharacter Personality:\n\n\nA friendly robot, he is very likable.  But, unfortunately, he is a complete \ncoward.  He is able to keep this kept hidden very well, but in a dangerous \nbattle, he may lose it and could cost the life of a fellow Maximal.  \n\n\nCharacter Stats:\n\n\nFunction: Equipment Repairs\n\n\nStrength: 7.0\nSpeed: 5.5\nRank: 2.0\nFirepower: 4.5\nIntelligence: 9.0\nEndurance: 6.0\nCourage: 2.0\nSkill: 10.0\n\n\nBeast Mode Description:\n\n\n\nAs a chimpanzee, he is only three foot four (3 ft, four inches).  Relatively \nweak, this mode isn&#39;t all that helpful, except for a fast retreat in the \ntrees.  Black eyes, and tannish skin, his hair is black.\n\n\nRobot Mode Description:    \n\n\n\nBrown, tawny, and black, he&#39;s a fearsome sight at 7 ft tall, somewhat \nsurprising do to his nature.  Two blue Maximal symbols rest on his chest, \nalmost invisible because of the hair covering his chest, abdomen, and arms.  \nIn his left hand, he carries a wrench.  In his right, he carries his tool \nbox.  In subspace, he possesses a laser pistol, and  photon pistol, as well \nas a few spare tools.\n\n"}}
