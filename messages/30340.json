Enraged, she flew off the ground and swiped at \nMegaton&#39;s face with her powerful polarbear claws. &quot;I can take you on, \nmind tricks or not!&quot; She slashed at him again and again. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton looks down at the melting rock beneath him. He reached down \nas if to\n&gt; scoop some out with his claws. In his eyes he had two fistfulls of \nlava, but\n&gt; in reality he had two claws of dirt. He pulled his claws back and \nthrew the\n&gt; molten earth/ dirt at Ice. &quot;You will move or you WILL be \ndestroyed.&quot; he\n&gt; yells knowing that the &quot;teddy&quot; bear in front of him wasn&#39;t worth \nhis effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stood up again, the hair on his back looked like \nneedles. &quot;Leave\n&gt; her alone monster&quot; He yelled. The wolf fired a sonic howl at his \nnemesis\n&gt; hoping to stop the beast from reaching his objective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Magaton was hit by a solid wave of force as the howl overcame \nhim, &quot;If thats\n&gt; your best than I haven&#39;t a worry.&quot; He swung a wing to the side \ncreating a\n&gt; gust of wind sending the wolf rolling across the ground. The battle \noutside\n&gt; the Cybertronian fire was quickly becoming an embarasment to the \nsmaller\n&gt; bots.\n\n\n\n"}}
