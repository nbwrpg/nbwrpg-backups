She typed  some buttons in order to block at Blaze\n&gt; the access to the computer. She typed some buttons more and eight\n&gt; mechanical craws appeared and took each leg and wrists of the femmes\n&gt; in order to that they couldn&#39;t do anything against her plans.\n&gt;\n&gt; She typed some buttons and a sort of gun appeared.
