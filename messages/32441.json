Oh well nothing better to \n&gt;do.\n&gt;Kinger we need to talk about what to do with the duplicate Guiledarts now.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Cygnar::\n&gt;     He was studying the egg when it began to move.  It slowly opened\n&gt;revealing a new Guiledart.  He would be useful.  Then he received the \n&gt;message\n&gt;reporting that, among other things, the original Guiledart was back.\n&gt;&quot;Interesting.  I&#39;ll call you NeoGuile for now.  Come along NeoGuile.  We&#39;re\n&gt;going to meet yourself.&quot;  He replies to the message from Apocalypse.  &quot;This\n&gt;is second in command Cygnar.  I am coming to your position with a... friend\n&gt;of yours.  I think you&#39;ll know him.&quot;  He takes off for the new position \n&gt;with\n&gt;NeoGuile following him.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
