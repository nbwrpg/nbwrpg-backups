This old warrior locked down \nhis ship as \n&gt;   it crashed into a pile of raw energon. His beast scanner came out \nand only \n&gt;   found raw energon signatures. The sound voiced. &quot;Too much energon \nerror.  A \n&gt;   skeleton of a bot came out. Its eyes red. Suddenly a white cloud \nof pure \n&gt;   energy surronded him. His hands extended forwards he looked at \nhimself. &quot;I am \n&gt;   Archon....I am energy.&quot; He floated across the grassy field. His \nship blew up \n&gt;   behind him. he sent a com to the Maximal city near by. &quot;I am \nArchon Maximal \n&gt;   warrior please respond.&quot; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
