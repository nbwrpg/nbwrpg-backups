I&#39;m a predacon. Why do you do these things. I don&#39;t \nunderstand.&quot; She was looking at him, with fear growing in her spark. \nShe couldn&#39;t understand why she felt this way. She was feeling \nsometing inside her spark and it was growing. She cared for him. But \nshe wasn&#39;t sure why. She was scared because her instincts told her to \nnever trust a maximal. But here she was, falling in love with one.  \nAll she cold do was stare at him. She couldn&#39;t even move. Her spark \nwas racing in her chest, from fear or love, she wasn\nt sure which it was.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll go in and see.&quot;\n&gt; He opened the door, and went in.\n&gt; &quot;KitKat?
