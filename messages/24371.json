Hmm, I get the distinct impression \nthe Alliance wants me dead:P\n\nTavatron/Hysteria/Rion\n\nHysteria dove to the right, barely avoiding the brunt of Obliteratron&#39;s \nattacks. She felt the sir rush by her as they struck the ground where she \nhad been standing only moments ago. She raised her arms and simultaneously \nfired two missles from each arm/shoulder cannon at Obliteratron&#39;s head. (She \nhas four, one on each shoulder and one on each arm.) Hysteria opened the \ncompartment under her arm, grabbed a charge, compressed the sides, and \ntossed it at the back of Obliteratron&#39;s left leg. It stuck on impact, and \nwas set to explode 3 seconds later with a force highly unexpected of a \nregular charge.\n\n*****\n\nTavatron flew about five yards from the force of Dark Wolf&#39;s orb. Her right \noptic was sparking, but other than that she seemd fine. Luckily the orb had \nonly grazed her. She fired her optics at Dark Wolf&#39;s chest, and managed to \nbarely dodge Scatterchot&#39;s fire. She performed a rather poor backflip, and \nlanded with a snoutfull of dust from the rounds. Tavatron held her staff in \nfront of her and charged the energon blades. The last time she tried this \nthe staff had exploded. Well, it was worth a shot. She sent a sickle shaped \nenergy blast at Scattershot&#39;s torso:\n\n&quot;Pathetic, slag-sucking Alliance &#39;bot!&quot;\n(no offense:P)\n\n(The energy blasts are about 1 ft long, and pure energon blasts. So it&#39;s \nkinda unstable^_^)\n\nRion:\n\nRion backed away a bit as Diana advanced on him. She had that look on her \nface. That look she always got when she was about to...\n\n&quot;No! Don&#39;t! Aaahhh--Hahahahehee!&quot;\n\nRion broke donw in a fit of laughter. She was Diana alright! Only one &#39;bot \nin the world knew just how tickelish he was!\n\n&quot;Dia-- haha-- na!&quot;\n\nRion could barely speak through his fits of laughter. But he was definitely \nglad to see her! He&#39;d tell her, if only he could speak!\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
