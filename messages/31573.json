If you wanted \nto be pleasent you&#39;d be here in person, so stop folling around and either \nget to the point or get lost.&quot;\n\n* Those were her words and she was sticking to them.\nShe glaced at Epyon before looking back to the screen, sensing things \nbrewing outside.\n&lt; What&#39;s the status outside?&gt; she asked Prowl, giving him a visual hint of \nwhat was happening in the controle room.\nIt had been a while since they just talked because they felt like it. \nSomething was always going on and they never had any time anymore.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
