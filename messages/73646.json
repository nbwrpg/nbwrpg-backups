The city was burnt out, old\nand rusted. Buildings had fallen over due to disuse and the power of\nthe storms and weather that had been across it over the years. Plants\nand brush had grown up all around the city and even animals were seen\nhiding amidst the old buildings and structures.\n\nOnly the plant itself seemed to be in any kind of shape, presumably\nbecause the seekers had been already working on it.\n\nHELLSCREAM was standing at the top giving orders while DIRGEGUN and\nTHRUSTOR were picking up large pieces of metal and trying to\nstrengthen their base. It would take some work to get it in shape, but\nit looked like it was possible given time.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
