He stomped forward and wrapped his tail gun&#39;s claw \naround his neck and pulled him close.\n    &quot;You will regreat ever wakeing up!&quot; Megatron hissed, letting a few \nspitlets hits his face. He squeezed harder, sinking the ridges of his claw \ndeeper into Airbombers throat. With two glareing optics, he looked to Kitkat \nto finish the intruder off. \n\n    Paralysis looked to his commander and apologised. &quot;Forgive me, Sir. Shes \nin the bunker but said to call her on your comm. Is there anything else I can \ndo for you?&quot; He said to Quickstrike, saluting.\n\n    Tarantulas was puzzled over the strange writings of the aliens that were \nscattered about, dead and rotting. The Triangle room was indeed the \nOperations Center of the bunker. It was complete with computers, \nCommunications devices, and an odd kind of screen. \n    He tried another set of decodeing programs, but to no avail. The language \nof the aliens was very complicated. It made the Vok&#39;s language look like a \nwalk in the park. Fustrated he slammed down his claw on the table.\n    The spider hissed, &quot;OH! These aliens are very crafty! But I have another \ncard up my sleeve......&quot; He then reached for one of Hell Beast&#39;s disks. The \none that had told them where this place was might tell them something about \nthis language. \n    He put the disk in and the odd runes on the screen suddenly began to \nchange into Predaconese. He could completely understand it now. Hell Beast \nmust have decoded them.....\n    &quot;Ah, excellent. Now to find out what happened here, and why.&quot; \n\n    Aracnia pushed open one of the sealed doors, now open of course. The room \nwas warm, and dark. She changed her optics into Nightvision and entered.\n    In the center of the room was a large cylider like object. She guessed it \nwas the powersource for something.....but what? As she got closer she saw the \ncontrol panel, but didnt understand a word on it. \n    She turned a left. This room was a mystery, but as soon as Tarantulas \ndecoded the runes, she would unlock this mysterious puzzle.\n    \n\n"}}
