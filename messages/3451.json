Gould&quot; &lt;black_panther_kitten@...&gt;\r\n\r\n * Snow Tech grinned at Dracona, then followed his\nsister down the hallway. After a couple of steps,\nShadow Cat is interupted from her latest hunt (namely,\nDinobot) By Ramulus, who told them they could come to\nfight with him. The only thing that Shadow Cat liked\nmore than cute bots with even cutter tails(or other)\nwas battle. She grinned at him,*\n\n &quot; Sure, sounds like fun, lets go!&quot;\n\n * And with that she followed Ramulus out of the base.\nSnow Tech yelled after her,&quot;*\n\n &quot; I&#39;m stayin here, If Inny wakes up i want to suprise\nthe slag out of her!&quot; \n\n * And with an evil chuckle, he walked towards Irons\nspark signature.*\n\n *meanwhile Shadow Cat had run off with Ramulus,\nlooking forward to battle, when her com-system beeped,\nloudly. She stopped, confused. She pushed the little\nbutton, annoyed that her fun was being interupted. A\nhologram of their small ship appeared. It&#39;s sheild\ndefences where failing, and it didn&#39;t have any other\ndefences, being a small ship. So, with a sigh, she\nwalked towards it, hopping that the sheilds didn&#39;t\nfail, and the predacons didn&#39;t get a hold of their\ncargo.....*\n\n * Snow Tech&#39;s com-system beeped, just as he was\nraising his fist to knock on iron&#39;s door, why did all\nhis fun have to be interupted all the time? frowning,\nhe pushed it. The hologram appeared, showing the ships\ndistress. He sighed, he had to go, their cargo was too\nvaluble to let anyone get a hold of. Snow Tech smiled,\nthe ships deffences might fall, and the Preds might\nget in, but HIS deffence system was still there. Let\nthe Predacons TRY to get to the hold, the only way\nthey&#39;de get there is in tiny bits.....*\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
