He knew they would detect him, but it didn&#39;t matter.  None of \n&gt; them would stand a ghost of a chance against him.  He slowed and then \n&gt; transformed into his robot mode.  He was now in visible range of the \n&gt; base, and he chuckled his old, evil sounding laugh.  He powered up \n&gt; the fusion cannon on his right arm and felt it would be an \n&gt; appropriate way of indicating his presence.\n&gt; &quot;Come out Predacons!  Your Emperor is here!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sol&#39;ludnium Prime- Orbiting Flagship of the Seventh Fleet\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Through the corridors of of the gigantic battleship Supernova, a \n&gt; large white and black robot walked toward an office door.  The large \n&gt; male hit the door bell and a voice on the other side responded.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Enter Constable.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The door slid opened and the officer stepped in.  The large office \n&gt; contained many decorations and awards the Admiral had accumulated.  \n&gt; In the center of the room was a large desk, and behind it the Admiral \n&gt; sat.  He was looking at some new business from the government that \n&gt; pretained to the fleet.  He tossed the data pad on the pile already \n&gt; on his desk and looked at the Security officer.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I see your mission to Oricron Core was a success.&quot; Hyper Convoy \n&gt; said as he stood and walked to the large window behind him.  &quot;I could \n&gt; not expect less from you, could I, Megatron Revived?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The large Neo Decepticon stepped forward, the stylized purple \n&gt; insignia on his chest fully visable.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes it was.  That prisoner was quite a hand full for the crew.  \n&gt; But overall he was apprehended without bloodshed or incident.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The Fleet Admiral smiled and turned to Megatron Revived.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You have served our government and it&#39;s citizens very well for the \n&gt; past few years.  Our Chief Exectutor, Tyrannis Kaitan, has given you \n&gt; free reign.  You are basically free to do as you choose.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hyper Convoy turned to Megatron Revived.  He extended his right \n&gt; hand, which Megatron Revived hearily shook.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I hear from your old friend Shockwave, that you brothe and sister \n&gt; are still very much alive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, the Matrix tells me they live and fight even now, but \n&gt; someplace I cannot go,&quot; Megaton Revived said, his hand over his chest \n&gt; panels.  Inside his armor exterior, a ornate golden Matrix of \n&gt; Leadership resided.  Vector Sigma gave this Matrix to the Decepticon \n&gt; Liege Maximo.  But Maximo made the mistake of leaving it behind.  Now \n&gt; Megatron possesses it, and eventually even the greatLiege will submit \n&gt; to justice.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ~*~\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Weeks later- Restricted Area MGA-0\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Weeks of travelling and bartering and threatening, Megatron Revived \n&gt; was mere meters from the jump point were the Maximals and Predacons \n&gt; jumped to the past and started the Beast Wars.  Also, Rodimus Prime \n&gt; pursued Hydras through this point, and now, he had to go through it.  \n&gt; In his armored gunship mode, Megatron Revived launched a small \n&gt; transwarp core into the Resticted area.  Undernegth of the ship was \n&gt; an engine pod with the barrel of the fusion cannon powered to life.  \n&gt; The transwarp core reached the correct area of spatial instability \n&gt; and Megatron Revived fired his mightuy fusion cannon, detonating the \n&gt; core and opened a rift in space time.  he engines touch off, and the \n&gt; gunship takes off for the rift.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ~*~\n&gt; &gt; Prehistoric Earth\n&gt; &gt; The rift emptied over the north pole of the little blue planet.  \n&gt; The white and black gunship sits motionless, observing and getting \n&gt; his bearings.  Unicron was a far distance off, but too close for \n&gt; comfort.  Megatron began scanning for signs of settlement, and found \n&gt; the closest to be the Predacon base.\n&gt; &gt; /Well, let us harass these so called decendants of the \n&gt; Decepticons.  I have wondered about them so, let&#39;s see if they live \n&gt; up to there reputation. /\n&gt; &gt; The ship changed attitude, and began to enter the atmosphere, \n&gt; headed for the Predacon base, to cause Chaos and wreak havok.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
