Turning around to look at the base. &#39;A \nrust plague?&#39; \n&gt; she thought. Then she remembered... Megatron went through such an \nordeal many \n&gt; years ago. They nearly lost their leader to such a devastating \ndisease. \n&gt; \n&gt; With every fiber of her being, both technical & organic screamed \nout in a \n&gt; primal fear of this wicked ruthless thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;Understood,&quot;&lt; her feline voice replied in a less edgy or serious \ntone, but \n&gt; softer & more... slightly compassionate sounding. \n&gt; \n&gt; She wondered how much it had evolved or devolved since last she \nheard of the \n&gt; disease. \n&gt; \n&gt; Either way... the technical part of her was in severe danger. The \nOrganic \n&gt; side was fine & safe. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glanced off in the direction of northeast. She had one idea... \nin which \n&gt; it would be dangerous. Somehow, she had to make sure no one would \nfollow her \n&gt; to destroy those she &#39;cared&#39; about the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;If you have not heard from... fear not. I shall be fine.&quot;&lt; A \nlittle more \n&gt; softly. &gt;&quot;I&#39;ll find away to stop this madness. Promise.&quot;&lt;\n\n\n"}}
