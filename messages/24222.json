He ignored the three nails \nthat dug into his knee.\n\n---\n\nPyro laughed as the fire ball hit his chest, doing nothing.  \n-Idiot-, Pyro thought, -Like a pyromaniac would allow himself to be damaged \nby his OWN weapon of choice-\n\nPyro didn&#39;t see Shocker, and was sent slamming to the side, all the missiles \ngoing by him.  He raised his weapon, firing off three fire balls at Shocker.\n\n---\n\nHiss still didn&#39;t move, but the effects of the electromagnetic pulse cannon \nas starting to wear off.\n\n---\n\nScavenger raised his chain gun, firing off 25 armor piercing rounds at Angel \nPrime when he saw him try and take out Pyro.  He ducked under the missile but \ntook the shots from Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nSixshot felt the cold of the ice breath hit him, but he ignored it, merely \nadjusting the temperature inside himself to 200 degrees farenheit.  The cold \nwould keep him from reaching critical temperatures of heat and damage any \ncomponents inside himself.\n\nThe bullets bounced off his armored form, and he swerved his turret, firing \noff two blasts from the cannon attached to his turret off at Icedragon.  The \nnails bounced off is current form.\n\n---\n \nDemon Wulf raised his palm, firing off three blasts at Depth Charge.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off 25 rapid laser blasts from his rifle at Silverbolt.  \nHe was slammed to his back by the missile, and int he process dodged the \nshots.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw fired off two missiles at the Cybertronian Fire, a missile striking \nhis armored form.  He roared in pain, transforming to his biped mode, two \nblue orbs forming, one in each hand.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch cursed as his missiles were destroyed.  He fired off one \nenergy-signature seeking missile at Tigerhawk from one pincher, and fired off \nanother at Sideswipe from the other.\n\n---\n\nInjector got hit by the blasts in his left side, and heard a right crack as \nhe began leaking mech-fluid from a portion of that side.  He cursed, firing \noff three stinger missiles at Blade Runner from one launcher, and three more \nat Orion from the other.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee ducked in mid-air under five shots, catching three in the left \npectoral.  He cursed at the pain, firing off three stinger missiles at \nShocker, firing another three from the other launcher at Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nManterror flew through the air, firing off three ion disks from one arm at \nAngel Prime, firing off another three from the other arm at Tigerhawk.\n\n---\n\nAres cursed as the missile and shots struck his armor that was starting to \ngive way.  He couldn&#39;t take much more onslaughts like that.  It was time to \nend them.  He trained all three of his cannons of his tank mode on Sideswipe, \nfiring four blasts from each, twelve shots heading for Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer yelled to Scattershot.  &quot;Fool, fight the ground troops!&quot; he \nsaid as three optic blasts from the second-in-command blew apart one of the \nthree remaining EMP cannons, and blocked an EMP blast with his left wing and \ntook flight.\n\nHe leveled his rapid-firing laser rifle, firing off 25 rapid laser blasts at \nAngel Prime.\n\n---\n\nScattershot cursed at Nemesis and raised his rifle, firing off 25 shells at \nDepth Charge.\n\n"}}
