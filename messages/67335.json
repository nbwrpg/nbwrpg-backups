Sorry about all the details\n&gt; not being covered. Basically, I wanted to reintroduce an old\n&gt; character\n&gt; and have a go at the Minions. Preston, to help you out, Vorpal was\n&gt; deliberately not fleshed out. He&#39;s a military Genius and a tyrant,\n&gt; but\n&gt; little else is known. That&#39;s what makes him scary.\n\nOOC: Then I will maintain that secrecy. I will use the trio of minions\nI sent A-blade&#39;s way for the moment, if that&#39;s okay with all. I would\nthink that a battle directly with Vorpal would need some details for\nhim if Azureblade is as powerful as he seems? I will be posting\nhopefully tommorrow, and always I am open to comments.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
