She keeps a brave face for her life long companion, and hopes =\r\nfor Rodimus Prime&#39;s recovery.  She could now see a faint blue light, eminat=\r\ning from Tucson&#39;s chest. She thought it was just a trick of the eye at firs=\r\nt, but she could see the glow getting brighter with each pulsation.  She co=\r\nuld hardly believe what she was seeing, but she knew exactly what it was.  =\r\nHe had not told anyone of his secret, not even when he was just little old =\r\nTucson. The only other Autobot who did know was Night Shift.\n\n&quot;Night Shift,=\r\n look. &quot;\n\nNight Shift looks up at the window, with a hand on the glass.\n\n&quot;T=\r\nhat&#39;s it buddy, that&#39;s it.  You got the power, use it.&quot;\n\nRat Trap looks to =\r\nthem in confusion.\n\n&quot;What the blazes is gon&#39; on in there?  Howcome Wheels i=\r\ns lit up like an over powered christmas tree?!&quot;\n\nQuick Stride too, looks su=\r\nrprised.\n\n&quot;What the slag&#39;s gon&#39; on?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot knew it was time to exp=\r\nlain herself.\n\n&quot; When Tucson was created, he was created with a special gif=\r\nt.  A gift who&#39;s power was formidable, but hardly considered destructive.  =\r\nTo a degree, we all have that power, but Tucson has an exceptionally large =\r\namount of it.  It&#39;s a power that comes at a price, a price which is paid wh=\r\nen a heart is broken.&quot;\n\nRat Trap listens closely.\n\n&quot; I dunno what we&#39;d ever=\r\n do without Wheels, or Rodimus.  They&#39;re - a part of us, and if we lose the=\r\nm, a part of us gets lost too.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot smiles.\n\n&quot; That also applies=\r\n to everyone here.  Love can hurt sometimes, but then most of the time, lov=\r\ne can be your greatest weapon.  There is no greater power than love.  Tucso=\r\nn&#39;s heart reaches out to everyone who knows him, and on a greater level, hi=\r\ns heart is reaching out to Rodimus, lighting the way for his return, as it =\r\nalso lights his way back to Talon, who he also loves dearly.&quot;\n\nShe turns to=\r\n everyone.\n\n&quot;Guys, we have to believe this will work, our hearts have got t=\r\no go out to Rodimus and Tucson.  Wherever they are, they will feel the warm=\r\npth of our compassion, and the power that grows from it.  He knows we&#39;re ro=\r\noting for him, that&#39;s why his chest is glowing.  Our faith, that&#39;s what&#39;s d=\r\noing it, our faith.  We gotta believe in it, we just got to!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;OLD=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At least that no means a big brawl&quot; said dryly Perceptor&quot;If two =\r\npredacons\n&gt; &gt; comanders were in same base, that will end in a civil war&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca frowned slightly at that, &quot;If the Predacons fell to fig=\r\nhting\n&gt; amongst themselves that would help us.
