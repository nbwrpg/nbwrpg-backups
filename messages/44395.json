Welcome back Soundwave.&quot; Switcblade twirls his twin \nwelders, and finishes welding on the last piece of plate armour for \nthat Firestrike&#39;s new leg. &quot;What can I do for you two?&quot; He smiles \nnonchalantly as he leans against the wall.\n\nSoundwave is about to speak when he is interupted by a commlink from \nAstrotrain. &quot;Astrotrain here, I&#39;m heading to Africa now, can you \nupload the coordinates of Spasstik to me?&quot; Soundwave turns and stars \nwalking to the control room, &quot;One moment, Soundwave will bring \nupdate you.&quot; Soundwave leaves Frenzy and Switchblade in the lab.\n\nWhen he reaches the control room, he reaches for a keyboard, and \ntypes a few commands into it. A visual display of where Spasstik is \nappears on the monitors. &quot;Astrotrain, head to these coordinates.&quot; \nSoundwave uploads the coordinates to Astrotrain.\n\nAstrotrain transforms into Train mode, and starts accelerating. He \ntransforms into Shuttle mode, and peels away from the ground, as he \nheads towards Africa. &quot;Be there in about 30 mins, Astrotrain out.&quot;\n\nSoundwave stands there impassivly.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile, back at Switcblade&#39;s lab,\n\nSwitcblade&#39;s right eyebrow rises, &quot;You&#39;re still here?&quot;\n\nFrenzy frowns, &quot;Your tin can doesn&#39;t pull enough weight... we bust \nour bust and get our asses kicked, and you laze around and drive our \nship...&quot; Frenzy shakes his head.\n\nSwitchblade slowly walks across the room, to a table with a wierd \nlooking piece of equipment, or a body part or something. Frenzy \nkeeps his eyes on the Switchblade, not trusting him for a moment.\n\nSwitchblade picks up the thing, and points on end at Frenzy, &quot;This, \nmy friend, is what I like to call an incinerator. In this case, it \ncould incinerate you... or not.&quot; He picks up a piece of discarded \nshrapnel, and smiles, &quot;Watch and learn.&quot; He tosses the piece up, \naims the thing at it, and as the shrapnel reaces the maximum height \nof it&#39;s trajectory, a burst of white hot fire spears out of now \napparent weapon, melting the shrapnel into a little puddle at \nFrenzy&#39;s feet. &quot;Now, when you&#39;ve got something you want to say to \nme, come back.&quot; Switchblade levels the weapon at Frenzy.\n\nFrenzy&#39;s eyes widden, and twitch from side to side, as the display \nunfolds.  &quot;I, uhh, bye!&quot; He backs out of the room, and slowly down \nthe hall, back where he came from.\n\nSwitchblade smiles. &lt;Foolish Frenzy&gt; He chuckles to himself, and \ncontinues his work.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Spasstik begins bounding away from the battlefield, holding \nMegatron\n&gt; carefully in his jaw.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frenzy arrives at the docked base holding onto Soundwave. (rAuq,\n&gt; whenever you want him, take him). Soundwave leaps into the air\n&gt; unfolding, and transforming into his large robot mode. He presses a\n&gt; button on his chest, opening a link to Astrotrain. &quot;Astrotrain, \npick up\n&gt; Spasstik from Africa, then bring Abominus and the ship.&quot; He walks \ninto\n&gt; the ship followed by Frenzy, until he reaches Switchblade&#39;s lab.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frenzy folds his arms with a smug look on his face. &quot;Long time no \nsee,\n&gt; Switchblade.&quot; he finishes with a small hint of disdain in his \nvoice.\n\n\n"}}
