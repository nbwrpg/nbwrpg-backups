He knew he had to dispose of \nthis target fast and go find wing. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt her wing and desided to try to transform.  She was \n&gt; successful.  She spread her wings and flew up just as she was about \n&gt; to reach the front of the Ark.  It was trmediously painful and the \n&gt; pain screamed through her body.  She up and landed in a tree next \nto \n&gt; the Ark. She looked down and saw Killer.  She was feeling her owl \n&gt; instincts trying to take over.  But the damage to her body was \n&gt; getting to her.  She just sat on the branch and tried to regain her \n&gt; breath.\n\n\n"}}
