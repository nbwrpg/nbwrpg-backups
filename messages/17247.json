The bot \nraises uncertainly to his feet. He stood 8 feet tall, and had a large \narray of impressive weapons. A big cannon was attatched to his \nshoulder. He looks around, seeing Whistler.\n\n&quot;You! Identify yourself! What faction are you?&quot; the bot barks, its \nweapon suddenly pointing at Whistler.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Whistler::\n&gt;     He is awakened by the crash still.  Still disoriented Whistler \nlooks \n&gt; around.  Seeing a fire near by he goes to investigate.  He finds a \nnewly \n&gt; crashed stasis pod.  &quot;Curious&quot; he thinks to himself.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
