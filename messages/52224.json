I came here to bring Talos \nback, but there&#39;s a reason they chose me: I&#39;m his cousin and Optimus \nPrime&#39;s descendant. But now, my ship seems to have been destroyed in \norbit &#39;cause I can&#39;t enter in contact with it anymore. Whatever \nhappens, I&#39;m now stuck here.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Me?  Well, the Rogues got started when I, a Predacon at the time, \n&gt; met a Maximal named Devilcat.&quot; Gatara says, rather bluntly.  &quot;He was \n&gt; a visionary; he looked past the political doublespeak the Maximal \n&gt; Elders and Tripredacus Council spouted both at each other and the \n&gt; citizenry, and he saw the uselessness of it all.  So we broke off - \n&gt; formed our own society, our own way of life.  Naturally, the \n&gt; aforementioned councils branded us as criminals the instant they \n&gt; learned what we&#39;d done.  But it was too late, and we started picking \n&gt; up recruits from all over the place.  We got established as more \nthan \n&gt; just a fringe group when we latched onto an old pleasure cruiser and \n&gt; retrofitted it to this - the Rogue Star.&quot;  She indicates their \n&gt; current surroundings.  &quot;We travelled far and wide, limited only by \n&gt; our own imaginations when we chose our destinations.  We met several \n&gt; alien races, and managed to incorporate their technology into what \nwe \n&gt; already had.  One of these called themselves the Shyft - that&#39;s \nwhere \n&gt; we got our lovely little dissapearing act.  Now, how about you - I \n&gt; imagine there&#39;s more to your story then just coming here out of thin \n&gt; air looking for a friend.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil follows and seats himself on the rather small chair. He \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; not the kind to like games though, so he did not touch the \ncommands.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: What about you? How did you join up with the others?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gatara laughs.  &quot;Of course we&#39;re not!  Some of us used to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons, some were Maximals - but no longer.  We follow our \nown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules, march to our own drum.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She leads her companion into Rogue Star&#39;s recreation area.  \n&gt; Gatara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; plunks herself down at a table with a holo-projector built in \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; games and the like.  &quot;Have a seat.  It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a chance to talk with someone from my own weight class.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
