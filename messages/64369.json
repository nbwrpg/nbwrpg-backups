The Silver Wings had taken up the defence of the\nplanet, and at the same time, had shown they were capable of producing\na warship. He was not going to let Razorwing outmaneuver him like this\nvery long.\n\nJotunn: This is Lord Jotunn. Be sure, Lord Razorwing, that I will be\npresent, he said in a low voice, yet you will not like to have me at\nyour table.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;gestaltproject@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lord Razorwing had sent troops to rescue the surviving crewmembers and\n&gt; salvage the Blackfeather. By now, anyone with minimum electronic\n&gt; senses would have realized that the Silver Wings had managed to build\n&gt; a warship. It was time to vent his fury.\n&gt; \n&gt; He called for a live connection  with the other Lords and Lady. He set\n&gt; it as a high priority message that would intenionally disturb what\n&gt; they were doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razorwing: Lords and Lady, dear colleagues, you might not have\n&gt; realized it, but we have just been caught unaware. Two minions alone\n&gt; have destroyed an orbital production plant and crippled my Silver Wing\n&gt; warship. There have been dozens of casualties, most of them workers\n&gt; from the station. This is the act we were dreading in silence. War has\n&gt; been declared! We have to act now! I thus convene an exceptional\n&gt; Governmental Session between the five of us to decide on the course of\n&gt; actions. I will welcome you here in Relay in just a few cycles. Be\n&gt; sure to be there!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: All Lords and Lady must leave their current tasks on Friday the\n&gt; 12 of august. the Session will begin Saturday during the day.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
