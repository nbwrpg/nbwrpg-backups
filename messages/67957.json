Sometime ago I started the story arc of \nhavi=\r\nng a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; third Great War break out on Cybertron between the Maximals and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons as well as any remaining Autobots and Decepticons. \nPlus\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; there is the G2 Decepticons attacking future Earth. I figure we \ncould\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do a RPG set in either of these battles.
