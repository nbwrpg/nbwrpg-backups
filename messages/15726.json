This was excellent. They had a new \n&gt; member, and a hostage who they could torture to crush spirit. Plus \n&gt; the other Maximals will undoutably try a rescue plan. And when they \n&gt; do Savage will be ready to greet them. Plus the unstoppable force \nof \n&gt; Tamron! But now that he had made himself known, word would grow. \n&gt; Others may come looking. He needed a way to gain huge power and \n&gt; influence on this planet. If there was some way to plant a major \n&gt; leader with the chip, and weild power from behind the \n&gt; scenes.....That&#39;s it! The puppetmaster plan!

A \n&gt; fire broke out inside and at the back of the shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ramulus, we nned you to put it out!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
