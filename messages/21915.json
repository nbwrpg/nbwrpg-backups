He remained still, waiting to see what Ice did next.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lunarpine saw the break in the action and took advantage. He\n&gt; transformed to his half wolf stage and dashed into the battle.\n&gt; Foxfingers rolled out and began scampering toward Lunarpine.\n&gt; Lunarpine grabbed the fox and pulled him to safety.\n&gt;\n&gt; Veratis watched as the stalemate continued. The virus seemed to have\n&gt; given Razor Claw extra abilities too. He catalogued each movement and\n&gt; each technique. Both were changed thanks to him, and both were deadly.\n&gt;\n&gt;  --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (Actually, I can&#39;t remember how he transforms, but I&#39;ll take your\n&gt; &gt; work on it.)\n&gt; &gt; Ice::\n&gt; &gt; She transformed into owl mode and flew up, and behind Razor Claw.\n&gt; &gt; She pecked on his back. &quot;Leave the fox alone.
