Thanks Alloran!)\n\nGesper maneuvered the ship and entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere. The ship shivered \nbut successfully made its entry and headed towards the newly reformatted \nAustralia.\n\nGesper:\nWe are on target. Landing site: former Simpsons Desert. Basic techno-organic \nvegetation. Wildlife: adapted to the new environnment, but still organic. \nThis is it, commander.\n\nBelthassan:\nExcellent. You know what your job is, brother...\n\nGesper didn&#39;t need to be explained. Although the reformatting process had \nbeen a total surprise, it would also permit to his ship to be deployed as a \nbase. Power, fluids, nutriments, everything would be provided by the new \nsoil. But there was one thing he would regret: if the Shadow Destiny \ntransformed into a base, it wouldn&#39;t fly for a long time...\n\nMelchana:\nI have located the Hellgate; location: grid Asuna-Typhendrix, vector 39406. \nMessage sent to lieutenant Daemos.\n\nBelthassan:\nBrace yourself for the landing, get me your report after, please...\n\nThe ship came downon its whale-like belly. Its wings rested fully extended \non each side of it. The transformation then started. An eerie dark glow was \nemitted by the ship&#39;s core. When it disappeared, a tall tower stood, and the \ntwo wings now formed a crescent-like barrier from it. Several vegetal wires \nconnected it to the ground, providing everything it needed.\n\nGesper:\nBase establishment complete. The reformatting cannon is depleted and the \ntransformation has damaged it. It is now useless.\n...\nBrother and sister, welcome to Earth!\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
