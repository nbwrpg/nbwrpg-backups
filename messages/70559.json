It was becoming quite crowded in the\nobservation room, all these maximals crowded into it to watch the\nprogress. Even Lord Elder and Cheetor were watching, although they\nwere simply monitoring it from the bridge of the ship rather than\nstanding in the observation room. Somebody had to keep an eye on\nsensors while all this was going on.\n\nThen Tuscon&#39;s chest began to glow . . .\n\n&quot;Sir&quot; Bump said to Santon as he worked on Rodimus, &quot;Look at Tuscon&#39;s chest.&quot;\n\nSanton walked over to Tuscon and began to run a scanner over him,\n&quot;Interesting.&quot; he said, there is an energy wave comming from him.&quot;\n\nLegacy glanced over, &quot;It is as predicted.&quot; he said, his voice cold and\nmatter-of-fact. &quot;Tuscon is capable is transmitting a harmonic Amares\nwave. From my understanding about it, it is typically a benificial\nphenomina for Autobots and Maximals.&quot;\n\nSanton was about to nod when the machine monitoring Rodimus began to\nchime and warble, Rodimus&#39; spark energy had just dropped off!!\n\n&quot;I thought you said beneficial!&quot; Santon said as he leaped over to\nRodimus in a desperate attempt to restart his systems.\n\nLegacy said nothing as he too attpemted to revive Rodimus.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
