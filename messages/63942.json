After that, we \nhand out those categories for the players to be in charge of. So, when \nBoybot wants to investigate on a slug that was used to kill a High Diplomat, \nhe either goes to see a scientist (controlled by Tankor, for example) or a \ngun expert investigator (controlled by someone else). These are the minor \nNPCs, those you&#39;ll meet once or twice and forget about.\n\nOf course, there are going to be major NPCs too. I think we can handle them \nwith the categories, and the players could also control them, with a few \nexceptions. The major NPCs are not characters and are thus killable. Sergent \nRoughbot, Maximal unit leader, may get in intense combat along with the unit \nthe PCs are in, but while the players&#39; chars will get out of the fight \nalive, Sarge will be killed by the frag grenade that hit too close. Also, \nthere must be no more than 1 or 2 major NPCs by category, meaning that they \nare both extremely rare and extremely valuable to the roleplaying \nexperience.
