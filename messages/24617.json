His attempt came to late as he avoided the first blast. He used\nanother howl at the enemy as the second shot struck his left leg forcing him\ninto a roll. the third shot caught him completely off gaurd as it hit his\nlower left back. The half wolf hit the ground with a crash, landing on his\nright shoulder, causing dirt into his open wounds. He transformed to his\nfull beast mode and his repair system kicked into overdrive. The wolf\nsacrificed offensive skills for repair functions. The adjustments Veratis\nhad made were coming in handy.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 27, 2000 12:23 PM\nSubject: Re: Serpentor VS Lunaprine\n\n\n&gt; Serpentor:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The serpent robot looked at Lunaprine as he jumped over him.  &quot;WHAT IN THE\n&gt; PIT ARE YOU DOING?&quot; he yelled as he watched the halfbreed run around.
