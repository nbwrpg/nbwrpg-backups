She can feel heat and ahead of her is\nsome sort of light. Stone dirt and grit crunched benath her feet as\nshe walked a slight breeze blows against her smells vaguely of rotting\nmeat and smoke. In the distance she can hear a sound, like metal on\nmetal, a clanging that echoes down the hall.\n\nShe arrives in a large chamber where the light is much brighter. Fire\nsurrounds the room on all sides, even blocking the door she had just\ncame through. The cieling is tall, hundeds of feet in the air and in\nthe center of the room is a tall mound of what look like dinosaur\nbones . . . or is it scraps of metal . . . it is difficult to tell in\nthe flickering light from the fire all around her - the heat is\nburning as she stands there.\n\nIn the center of it all she can see what appears to RODIMUS, or at\nleast two of him. One is the red, yellow and orange one that looks to\nbe her husband. The other is black, grey and silver, almost a reverse\nimage of the RODIMUS she knew - it was DARK RODIMUS!\n\nRODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS fought and that is the clanging that she\nheard, the two of them locked into combat, and she knew deep within\nher that this one was to the death.\n\n\nThe fire around her gre hotter and hotter as the battle rose in pitch\nand intensity, both combatants striking each other, large dents and\nrips mar both of their frames.\n\nBoth of them dropped their weapons, their ammunition spent and they\nrush at each other, thier faces determined. As they connect they both\nburst into flames, black and silver, red and yellow they explode into\nthousands of colors, and the whole room began to go up in flames!\n\n&quot;Nightlight I love you!&quot;\n\nNightlight . . . &quot;\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\n&quot;&quot;Nightlight!&quot; A voice calls out to her from darkness. &quot;Nightlight can\nyou hear me?&quot;\n\nAt first the voice sounded like RODIMUS, but then it reveals itself to\nbe BUMP&#39;s.\n\n&quot;Are you okay? Your readings began to spike at the end.&quot;\n\nAround NIGHTLIGHT was the familiar med chamber, BUMP was standing over\nher CR chamber looking nervous. &quot;It looks like you had some sort of\nnightmare.&quot; He paused, &quot;But it is rare for anyone to even dream in\nCR.&quot; He looked confused but relaxing as NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s readings were\nreturning to normal.\n\n&quot;Boy, you had me scared for a minute there. It&#39;s okay now. Your safe,\nits all right.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
