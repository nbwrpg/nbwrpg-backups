She raised her head and roared at the escaping enemy but was then suddenly struck in the midsection by a fairly large missile and was blown back a few steps, then looking up to see whom had shot her but then was blown back again by a second missile, then and third and a fourth. Her side was now one gaping wound in which bled freely and ran down her legs and tail, the ground becoming a bit slippery from the splattering of her fluid and the pouring of it on the ground. But then when the 20 rapid lasers struck her midsection her body tipped forward and slammed into the ground, a shower of mech fluid spewing in all directions as her feet slipped out from under her and she struck with a large rumble. She was downed!\nIron Raptor struggled to get back onto her feet before failing and looking up towards the direction in which the weapons had come, narrowing her eyes as they fell upon Shockwave but then struggling to get to her feet again. With a giant heave she managed to gain her footing and stand at her true height only to hear the plasma charges sent by Dark One from Hiss and quickly getting out of the way of the danger. She had no idea how much more damage she could take before her systems� gave out and she was forced to transform into her robot mode. \nThen suddenly snapping her head off towards Pyro as he then sent a missile towards her, just before it was about to hit she turned from it and struck it with the flat of her tail�sending the missile towards the exact bot in which had sent it.\nIron Raptor stumbled a few steps from the force of the whack she had to cause to send it back towards Pyro but regained her balance and then turned back towards him.  She was just about to go after him after the missile exploded when she heard the transmission from Zardus�they were allied with the Maximals?\nShe was not aware of this as she then looked back off towards Pyro and cringed as she saw the missile explode behind him but then left it at that. If they were allied then she would be the first to stand down, she didn�t want to scrap a faction that was now helping them now that she knew about the alliance. But then turning off towards the base, the damage being clearly seen from her view point.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
