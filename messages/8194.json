I figured out your riddle and found the \nkey. Unfortunatly it was destroyed by the predacon Megatron. I suggest we \ntake quick action to take vengence.&quot; Bobertron&#39;s optics glowed into a furious \nred. \n    &quot;How did this happen. You now how important that was! How did he get the \nkey off you!?&quot;\n    &quot;He caught me from behind. He snatched it so a recieved little damage by \nrunning scared.&quot;\n   &quot;Lets go. Tell Magmatron what has happen and im sure he&#39;ll agree. Send a \nfull force attack on Megatron.!&quot;\n\n"}}
