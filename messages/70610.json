He finds that physical fire isn&#39;t much good against the in=\r\nsects but when he did excercise spiritual power, it seemed to help Vestige =\r\nand himself immensely. He thinks for a moment and looks to Vestige.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ve=\r\nstige, our power lies in something that these insects do not have. Our hear=\r\nts. The simplest power of all, one that all living creatures are capable of=\r\n expressing, and the one ability that these creatures do not possess. We mu=\r\nst use that power now if we&#39;re going to vanquish our enemy and get Rodimus =\r\nback. it will unite all three of us, and only then, can we defeat this foe.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His chest now pulsating as it had before, with the force of a beating=\r\n heart filled with compassionate power. Several plates on his chest shift, =\r\nas a well protected heart like structure beats luminously. He looks to Vest=\r\nige.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Our compassion for each other, our loyalty to our comrades, our =\r\nlove for our fellow Autobots. That is the one power that can never be extin=\r\nguished. You believe in that power, reach down, touch it, and allow yoursel=\r\nf to allow it to flow freely within you. It will light all flames as it has=\r\n for centuries. We can do this Vestige, we can do this. For Rodimus Prime, =\r\nour hearts are with him, as his is with us. Let&#39;s unite them and end this o=\r\nnce and for all.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVestige was, like Tuscon, firing to keep off thes=\r\ne undoubteldy much\nstronger insectoid creatures. Laser beams and miniature =\r\nmissiles were\nflying throuygh the air in an effort to keep the creatures at=\r\n bay.\n\nMeanwhile the creatures continued to approach, doing thier best to\np=\r\nush through hail of weapons fire that came from the beleagered\nAutobots, ho=\r\nwever they did not appear to be faring well under the\nonslaught from Tuscon=\r\n and Vestige!\n\nHowever it was at this time that the door behind crashed ope=\r\nn and\nseveral blue and white winged flying insectoids were flying in, thier=\r\n\nstinger flashing in the light from this room!\n\n&quot;I get it now!&quot; Vestige sai=\r\nd as he turned to see thier new threat, &quot;We\nmust unite!&quot; he said as if unde=\r\nrstanding the import of Tuscon&#39;s,\nalthough not quite in the way that he mea=\r\nnt them. Turning back to fire\na few shots at the new threat of flying Insec=\r\ntoids he glanced at\nTuscon, &quot;I need to get to that bed!&quot; He said talking ab=\r\nout the bed the\ninsecoids had been working over and the figure that now lay=\r\n prone on\nit.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
