However the feline transformer quickly caught up to him \nnear the \n&gt; Maximal base.  He leaps into the air, transforming in flight and \nlaunching \n&gt; one dagger into Enertron&#39;s shoulder.  Enertron grunts and goes down \nhard, \n&gt; hitting the ground and rolling back to his feet.  He turns to face \nhis \n&gt; assailant.  Holding the shoulder of his wounded arm he glares at \nAmperion.  \n&gt; &quot;Why must you insist on this?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Amperion returns his glare.  &quot;You know full well why.&quot;  As \nEnertron \n&gt; turns to flee again Amperion grabs his arm.  The sound of tiny \nmechanisms can \n&gt; be heard as he attempts to gain Enertron&#39;s power of energy for \nhimself, \n&gt; unfortunately this is less than effective on a living bot.  \nEnertron sends a \n&gt; surge of energy through the link wiping most of Amperion&#39;s memories \nand \n&gt; leaving him a babbling mess in front of the Maximal base.  Enertron \nthen \n&gt; pulls the dagger from his shoulder and drops it next to Amperion.\n&gt; \n&gt;        With his pursuer disabled he takes flight heading aimlessly \ntoward the \n&gt; Southeast.  His wing was also damaged by the dagger, and thus his \nflight is \n&gt; both erratic and painful.  With one last hurrah he clears a tree to \nland in a \n&gt; clearing.  Unfortunately the clearing is already occupied by the \nPredacon \n&gt; base.  Bouncing off of the base he lands on the ground in severe \npain.\n\n\n"}}
