I am Councillor Azure of the Predacons,\nLord of the Antioch System and ruler of the sparks it shelters. I\nrequest your hospitality and your protection. But first, I think we\nshould get ready for a little visit. It seems that my crash landing\nhas warned Maximals of my presence, and I feel some coming here very\nsoon...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rattrap and his friends head to the signal hoping that they aren&#39;t\ntoo late\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Airly &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kup:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Ojk pals be carefull, I got preds signatures around the distress\nsignall I guess that still you can arrive first&quot;reply kup by\ncomlink&quot;but I guess that they won&#39;t broke the cease of fire while\nUnicron is here... but be caution&quot;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Tankor \n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 02, 2005 1:17 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Escape (Double... rescue?-&gt; MAximals and Predacons)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap(COMLINK) :&quot;kup where is the signal comimg from. i&#39;ll be\nthere as soon as i know where i&#39;m going&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; To the others \n&gt;  &quot;the group of you want to help out&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; BA: &quot;im in&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Silverbolt&quot; me too&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; OP:&quot; of course\n&gt; \n&gt; Rhinox:&quot;count me in to&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rattrap &quot;what about the rest of you&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
