Transforming to robot mode, he landed on his skid \nplates.\n\nCrawling over to a console, he pressed a series of commands, the computer \nvoice blaring over the comm. system.\n\n-Self destruct initiated, base will be obliterated in sixty seconds~\n\nLooking up, he saw a hole in the cieling.  A hole that had never been \nrepaired.  He remember Koga Shuko giving an order, but, no one had ever fixed \nthe hole Megatron and Ominous Prime had made.  Unitron shrugged.  Using a \nconsole for leverage he climbed up on it, leaping in a mass of pain, clinging \nonto th edge of the hole.  \n\nPulling himself up with amazing strength, he got through the hole, which was \nbarely big enough for him.\n\n-Self destruct in 15 seconds- the computer informed him.\n\nGetting into an upright position, he transformed into his jet fighter mode, \nlaunching into the sky.\n\n"}}
