She looked at the clone then past \nher, there was nothing there!

It would still take a day and a half to reach \nthe place where she was picking up the energy signatures.\nCarnage sighed, more traveling!\nShe gestured with her head for the others to follow and called back...*\n\n&quot; Come on!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
