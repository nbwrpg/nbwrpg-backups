She went up a flight of stairs and came \nto the private quarters area.  She smiled at how she managed to get \nthis far and no one had stopped her yet. Surely she had been here, \nbut why couldn&#39;t she remember, she thought.  She followed the hall \nalong, seeing a few maintenance bots here and there, but they didn&#39;t \nstop her.  She continued on, wondering just how far she&#39;d get before \nsomeone decided to make her go back.   \n\n\n"}}
