He landed and pulled out his \ngiant 7 foot long 3 foot wide sword.  As he gripped the hilt blue \nflame covered it instantly bringing it to a temperature rivaling that \nof the Pit itself.\n&quot;So you want to play with blades do you?&quot;\nHe took a swing across at Unitron then without knowing if he hit him \nmade another swipe down.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Unitron:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The near ten million year old robot sidestepped as he saw another \nrobot \n&gt; intrude, in the process avoiding Megatron&#39;s blast.  He ducked down, \nfiring \n&gt; off five rapid optic blasts at Megatron&#39;s left knee joint, and two \nblasts \n&gt; from the rifle he held in his right hand at Firestrike&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now I am sure you an impostor.  The real Megatron would not have \ncalled for \n&gt; his cronies, even if he were losing!  He had to much pride!&quot;  Still \nin a \n&gt; crouched position and ready to spring his left hand shot out and \nwith a \n&gt; magnetic attraction, the now deactivated energy blade&#39;s hilt flew \ninto his \n&gt; left hand, a fist now surrounding the hilt as the pink glow of \ndeadly energy \n&gt; extended from it for a few feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will kill all the tw--&quot; Unitron began but stopped, seeing the \nthird robot, \n&gt; Nightstrike come into view.  He kept his comm. open, just in case \nhe needed \n&gt; to call for reinforcements.\n\n\n"}}
