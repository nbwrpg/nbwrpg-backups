Dakness,=\r\n pain and even a\n&gt; strange sense of loneliness as if he has lost someone or=\r\n something,\n&gt; but he is not sure what.\n&gt; \n&gt; For HYDRAS there was only the s=\r\nensation of floating in water, his body\n&gt; moving and swaying. A curious sit=\r\nuation since as far as his internal\n&gt; diagnotics were telling him he had no=\r\n body, no frame. It was like he\n&gt; were caught in some sort of dream state.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment he could see the world of EARTH, the entirety of it, the\n=\r\n&gt; length and breadth of it. it seemed far older than he remembered it\n&gt; and=\r\n yet strangely younger. He could see the energy it held, the\n&gt; kingdoms tha=\r\nt would one day rise and fall all over the course of\n&gt; thousands and millio=\r\nns of years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he could see that the legions on the world were not =\r\nhumans but\n&gt; CYBERTRONIANS all of them with the PREDACON and even DECEPTICO=\r\nN logos\n&gt; on their chestplates.\n&gt; \n&gt; But there was somehting different abou=\r\nt it, and then it hit, the\n&gt; CYBERTRONIANS, the PREDACONS and the MAXIMALS =\r\nwere all large sized 30,\n&gt; 40 some even 50 feet tall.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All of this cou=\r\nld be yours.&quot; Said a dark and unknown voice to HYDRAS\n&gt; from somewhere that=\r\n he could not see. &quot;All you must do is be my\n&gt; follower.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What do you=\r\n say Hydras?&quot; The voice had an arrogant curiousity to it.\n&gt; &quot;think upon it.=\r\n Hydras.

His systems were slow=\r\nly\n&gt; rebooting themselves and powering up and his sensors were only telling=\r\n\n&gt; him that he was in a room of some sort with two individuals. JHIAXUS\n&gt; a=\r\nnd SCORPONOK.\n&gt; \n&gt; These two had disappeared a long while back.
