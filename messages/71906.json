T=\r\nhe knew they were in trouble for something the first time they had to repor=\r\nt, told by Leo Prime.  They knew him well, and figured that they&#39;d get a re=\r\nal earfull from him.  But then a second transmission told them that Tucson =\r\nwould be talking to them instead.  Straight Shot looks to Rattrap a little =\r\nconcerned.  She knew her brother well, and knew the tones of his voice when=\r\n he was serious about something.  She takes a seat as does Rattrap, who had=\r\n to have the first word.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m telln&#39; ya this ain&#39;t fair, Straight Sho=\r\nt.  That little go cart started it.  He just had ta open his trap and now w=\r\ne&#39;re in serious scrap for somethn&#39; we so did not start!  It stinks like the=\r\n trash compactor in the garbage bay!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Tell=\r\n me about it. And the worst part is, Tucson is giving the lecture.  I know =\r\nhe&#39;s not gonna let anyone off easy, just by the tone of his voice, it sound=\r\ned serious.  I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re getting in trouble for sticking up for o=\r\nurselves.  What&#39;s so wrong about that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She shrugs, as Rattrap sighs.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ya got me Prickles.  Oh yeah, your new nickname.  No offense.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nShe smiles.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nah, none taken, I like it.  Prickles...  That&#39;s a new on=\r\ne.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap tries to muster a smile.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Kinda like when I used ta=\r\n call your brother, Wheels..  Hmm, now I think I better call him Wings.  Th=\r\ney&#39;re big enough. Anyway, I wonder what he&#39;s gonna say ta us and what kinda=\r\n punishments he&#39;s got planned. Ya know he&#39;s gonna do that, right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Str=\r\naight Shot nodds.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yup.  Guess we just take what comes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They now=\r\n sit patiently and wait for Wheelie to come in.\n&gt;\n\n\nAt this point, Wheelie =\r\nwalked over into the briefing room.  Glancing over at Rattrap and then over=\r\n at Straight Shot, the small Survivor said nothing, merely going ovr to sit=\r\n.\n\nAt this point, not seein LEO PRIME or RODIMUS present, he quirked his he=\r\nad about.\n\nSaying nothing, then going to sit back down as he gazed upon the=\r\n others and waited for what they had all been called in for, not making con=\r\nversation and staying quiet.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
