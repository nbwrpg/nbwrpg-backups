He thinks for a moment, as does Night \n&gt;&gt; Shift,\n&gt;&gt; who seems to get the same idea as Rat Trap.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You thinkn&#39; what I&#39;m thinkn&#39; Blackie?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Looks like it, rodent bot.  That energy, the one commn&#39; from his \n&gt;&gt; chest...\n&gt;&gt; I bet it can be channeled inta one bot from the other, via the chest\n&gt;&gt; port..  That power&#39;s tryn&#39; ta reach somethn&#39; and I wonder if it&#39;s tryn&#39; \n&gt;&gt; ta\n&gt;&gt; reach Rodimus&#39;s core where his matrix was.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Before anyone could think, in his state of unconsciousness, Tucson \n&gt;&gt; extends\n&gt;&gt; his hand out as far as he can, hoping that it will touch upon Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; hand, even if it were only his fingers.  He begins to talk in his sleep.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Just - a hand - a - way.  Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He fights hard to extend his arm far enough to attempt to feel Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; hand.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Torca looked at Perceptor for a long moment, &quot;Yes.&quot; he said finally,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; speaking more to Kup than to Perceptor. &quot;We shall wait for the repairs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to be complete.&quot; He turned and looked at Kup and the others, &quot;Then we\n&gt;&gt;&gt; have many other things to discuss.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bantor walked up the hall towards where Eilta and the others were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; standing. looking at the repairs. It was becoming quite crowded in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; observation room, all these maximals crowded into it to watch the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; progress. Even Lord Elder and Cheetor were watching, although they\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were simply monitoring it from the bridge of the ship rather than\n&gt;&gt;&gt; standing in the observation room. Somebody had to keep an eye on\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sensors while all this was going on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Then Tuscon&#39;s chest began to glow . . .\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir&quot; Bump said to Santon as he worked on Rodimus, &quot;Look at Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; chest.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Santon walked over to Tuscon and began to run a scanner over him,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Interesting.&quot; he said, there is an energy wave comming from him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Legacy glanced over, &quot;It is as predicted.&quot; he said, his voice cold and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; matter-of-fact. &quot;Tuscon is capable is transmitting a harmonic Amares\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wave. From my understanding about it, it is typically a benificial\n&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomina for Autobots and Maximals.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Santon was about to nod when the machine monitoring Rodimus began to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; chime and warble, Rodimus&#39; spark energy had just dropped off!!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I thought you said beneficial!&quot; Santon said as he leaped over to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Rodimus in a desperate attempt to restart his systems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Legacy said nothing as he too attpemted to revive Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
