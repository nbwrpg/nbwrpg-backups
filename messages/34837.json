Several laser blasts streak past him,\n&gt; one hits his side armour, leaving a smoking groove. Mini rockets crash\n&gt; by him and into his top, shaking him and almost knocking out of\n&gt; flight. Astroblast swoops down towards Fireblade, and meets\n&gt; Switchblade there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade smiles, still cloaked. He throws the remains of \n&gt; Fireblade into the hatch, then hops in himself. He yells to \n&gt; Astroblast, &quot;Hey, &#39;Blast, we&#39;ve got another passenger waiting over the\n&gt; hill, make sure to get him when you leave.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Astroblast&#39;s rear thrusters launch again, as he curves around to pick\n&gt; up the last target, Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Menasor leaps forward, Prowl&#39;s missiles smashing into his virtually\n&gt; unmolested chest armour, causing him to hesitate a little.\n&gt; Incarcinator&#39;s charges land behind him, the explosions throwing up\n&gt; dirt and ashes around Menasor&#39;s feet.
