After the bite, that&#39;s when I started \nloosing my nice leopard pelt.&quot;  She lowered her head,&quot;I wasn&#39;t \nprogrammed to handle situations like this. What am I going to do?&quot;\nThen the idea struck her. She asked,&quot;UH, where are you going to take \nme to get fixed up?  Who are you? I don&#39;t want to walk into a death \ntrap. Not after..after this.&quot;  She covered her face again and cried. \nHer chrome body, still slender and cat like, shined and reflected the \nlight coming in from the windows.  It looked like a crystal prysm was \nin the window as the light and rainbows danced around inside the \nshuttle.  She tried to regain her composure and wiped her face with \nher hands. &quot;Now what do we do?&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;*Orchid*&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Armada/Blizzard/Kamodia\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (Kamodia watches as Feline walks into the shuttle.

We \nfound a\n&gt; female bot laying near the shuttle. She says she lost her beast \nmode. I\n&gt; don&#39;t know how but it appears her skin came off. I&#39;m quite \nconfused. She&#39;s\n&gt; in the shuttle with us right now. Can you bring us back in? I think \nyou\n&gt; check this out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (Armada awaits an answer from Reptilica.)\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
