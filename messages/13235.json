Hold on a bit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She walked to the holding cell and looked inside at AirBomber.\n&gt; &quot;Hey, You Airbomber?  Your coming with me. I have someone who wants\n&gt; you.  Me, I coulld careless.  I have enough problems.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She opened her link,&quot;You want your friend. You meet me at the\n&gt; entrance. Don&#39;t try anything.  I will be there with him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She closed her link and walked in and grabbed Airbomber by the wrist\n&gt; and drew her gun.  She aimed it for his head. &quot;You will come with me.\n&gt; Your friends want you back.&quot;  She sighed. &quot;Look. I&#39;m doing you a\n&gt; favor.  The only thing I want in return, it that if I call on your\n&gt; help, you help me.  Got it? I don&#39;t want to kill you. So you will\n&gt; come with me now, quietly and don&#39;t try anything.  And then you will\n&gt; be released and returned to your friends.  Nod your head if you\n&gt; understand me.&quot;  She waited for Airbomber to reapond.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Infectra\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Infectra calls KitKat on her Commlink*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Infectra: &quot;What&#39;s going to become of Airbomber?

Deemos was charred and burnt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Let&#39;s go back, we suffered alot of damage, I think we need more\n&gt; bots for out army.&quot; Deemos said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;We are 7 now, should we join Psuedo?&quot; Doom Ice asked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Nope, we kill Psuedo.&quot; Deemos replied.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kiss him goodbye then.&quot; Doom Ice said.

He\n&gt; invisioned himself standing on top of the Earth, poisoning everyone\n&gt; and ruling the universe. He envisions himself destroying Unicron, and\n&gt; getting possesion of both the Matrix of Leadership and Matrix of\n&gt; Conquest. His dreams must come true, with or without Inzola. Inzola&#39;s\n&gt; absense has boosted his confidence, that little slagging homewrecker,\n&gt; Stranato did him a favor. The Chosen Ones start back to base, the\n&gt; autoguns blasting Rizopas once more in the back before they walk\n&gt; away. Rizopas follows, one hand on his back. There were 7 now, but\n&gt; who knows who could join them next?...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ----------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
