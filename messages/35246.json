Pacifix walked outside, and stretched\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing that this would be his last day on the planet he had called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home for so many years. &quot;Ok.&quot; He opened an encrypted commlink to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Autobots who were going on the mission.

He aririve at the entrance, and hops into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, appearing at the bottom. He walks around the ship, finds a crate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to site on, moves it to the large open area which Pacifix would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably use for his farwell speech. He sits down on the crate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting for Pacifix.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 18 May 2001, at 8:08, robertdahl wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ironhide frowned at how this had degenerated.
