Well, when a website dies when the \nwebmaster \n&gt;   &gt; stops \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; updating the website... right? What if we (RPGERs) do a \ntemporary \n&gt;   &gt; website \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; for NBW... but instead exist one webmaster, we&#39;ll have more. \n&gt;   Then, \n&gt;   &gt; if \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; one of webmasters can&#39;t work on the website (or worst: quit) \nfor \n&gt;   a \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; while, the others can keep the site running and updating it. \nIf \n&gt;   one \n&gt;   &gt; of \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; webmasters quits,  the others webmasters chooses an other \nmember \n&gt;   and \n&gt;   &gt; train \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; him/her, and give that person the passwords and needed \n&gt;   information.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; When the website has to be updated, the webmasters share the \njob, \n&gt;   &gt; and \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; it will go much faster, since several people are doing it.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Airly\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Check out Yahoo!
