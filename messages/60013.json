Unicron ultimately means Primus is involved\nand it was well established in the original US comic\nthat Primus had the ability to teleport being (en\nmasse) I might add, over great distances. We see this\nin Issue 73 when Primus Teleports EVERY transformer on\nEarth at that time to Cybertron. So I can repost, but\nessentially, it wont be realistic - I mean we&#39;re\ntalking about 2 deities here in this storyline. Any\naction carries out by them that has any serious intent\nwill by its very nature be modding.\n --- airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote: \n---------------------------------\nCycodronus,\n\nI&#39;m very sorry to said this but you should repost with\nShadimus and \nthe bots that will fight with minions in Preds base,\n&#39;cause \nteletransportation isn&#39;t allowed.\n\nCya\n\nAirly\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
