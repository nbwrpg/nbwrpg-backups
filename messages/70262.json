A lot of it if not all of it, is \n&gt;&gt; actually my fault. The day we fought off Hydras&#39;s lackies two years ago, \n&gt;&gt; I had managed to deal with the ones I was fighting against and saw that \n&gt;&gt; you, Nightlight and Windlord were in desperate need of help. So I went as \n&gt;&gt; fast as I could, to try and divert enemy fire away from you, but I failed \n&gt;&gt; to check a blind spot in my rear view mirror, and I was shot from behind, \n&gt;&gt; rendering me inoperable and blind. If I had just taken more careful \n&gt;&gt; survey of what was around me, none of this, including what happened to \n&gt;&gt; you, would never have happened. Now, now is the time to make it up to \n&gt;&gt; you. We&#39;ll fight them together. Scorponok doesn&#39;t scare me, none of them \n&gt;&gt; do. All right Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me to make this easy for you because \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not! As I&#39;ve said to Scorponok before, I will not fold to any of you, \n&gt;&gt; no matter what damages you instill on me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus almost smiled as Tuscon tried so hard to take the blame, or at\n&gt; least some of it. He shook his head slightly, &quot;Because you didn&#39;t\n&gt; check a blind spot all of this happened?&quot; Rodimus turned to look back\n&gt; at the oncoming Decepticons, &quot;No, no one can say that. I have my own\n&gt; blame to bear, but this time I will bear it rather than trying to . .\n&gt; . &quot; Rodimus&#39; voice stopped mid sentence as he struggled with something\n&gt; inside his head!\n&gt;\n&gt; Jhaxius smiled as he, Cyclonus and Scourge walked foward, Cyclonus&#39;\n&gt; strides quickly bring him to the fore. &quot;Did you think we did not have\n&gt; this in mind?&quot; Cyclonus said. &quot;Rodimus, as long as he lives will still\n&gt; belong to Hydras!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Behind Cyclonus, Jhiaxus was holding a device, a miniature version of\n&gt; what was used originally to change Windlord and Rodimus into the evil\n&gt; versions of themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Jhiaxus said, &quot;The original program had gone dormant but still\n&gt; remained. It was only a matter of bringing the software back online.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus shook his head as he mouthed the word, &#39;NO&#39;. He held his head\n&gt; and fell to his knees, his palms against his ears as if he were trying\n&gt; to block out voices that he was hearing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scorponok chuckled as he resumed his robot mode and he and Scourge\n&gt; brought up the rear, &quot;Yes Brother.&quot; Scorponok said to Rodimus, &quot;Come\n&gt; back to us, we need you.&quot; his voice sarcastic and condescending.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; armor slowly began to blacken again and then shift red as if\n&gt; on fire. He glanced over at Tuscon, his optics still the amber of his\n&gt; Autobot upbringing, &quot;Get Nightlight . . . all of them out of here!&quot; he\n&gt; said, his voice hoarse and intense, &quot;This must stop here, now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus glanced at a message that he received from Perceptor . .  .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;6 cycles - P.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled as his armor shifted black again, &quot;Yes brother I hear\n&gt; you.&quot; Rodimus said as he began to walk forward. Behind his back he\n&gt; motion to Tuscon to go, &quot;GO!&quot; he said fiercely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus stopped near the device that Perceptor had planted, shielding\n&gt; it from the view of the Decepticons, &quot;Come &#39;brothers&#39;&quot; he said, &quot;We\n&gt; can end all this here and now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
