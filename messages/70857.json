She still waits to see what weapon he \nwants her to transform into.\n\n&quot;Umm Kup, ya forgot ta mention which weapon you preffer, cross bow or \ntraditional bow?  Any of them will do.&quot;\n\nTucson couldn&#39;t help but put an arm around Talon, and give her a gentile \nembrace.\n\n&quot; And as for you Talon, we will need some heavy hitters to finish the job. I \nhave full trust in you as a warrior and I&#39;d like you to join me in bringing \nup the rear.  Rodimus, you will go before me, and if anything happens to \nyou, I will back you up.&quot;\n\nNight Shift then turns to Perceptor.\n\n&quot; Okay Perceptor, looks like you&#39;n I are gon&#39; it tagether.  No worries, I&#39;ve \ndone plenty of silent infiltrations, and ben&#39; a ninjabot, I know when ta \nmake myself scarce.&quot;\n\nRat Trap now approaches Windlord.\n\n&quot;If ya want, we could team up.  That way you&#39;re not gon&#39; it alone.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Excellent idea, Rat Trap. In this case, it doesn&#39;t hurt everyone to be \nworking with another comrade, due to the magnatude of this mission. It&#39;s far \nsafer for everyone to team up with someone.&quot;\n\nQuickstride raises his hand.\n\n&quot;We forgot about Rodimus, I think I better go with him.  Y&#39;know, for extra \nfire arm support?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes, I agree.  Rodimus, I&#39;m sending Quickstride with you.  His skills on \nthe battlefield will be much needed.  And Cheetor, feel free to fall back on \nanyone you wish.  The more we work with each other, the stronger we will be. \nAnd as for Cyclonus, that is the only exception my friends.  I do not wish \nto lose any of you to his wrath, therefore, I wish to deal with him myself.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gasps.\n\n&quot;But, but, that&#39;s almost like suicide!  Ya heard Rodimus!  Ya can&#39;t do \nthat!&quot;\n\nTucson grins.\n\n&quot;Not if I listen to the power of the Matrix.  It will guide me, as it has \nguided Optimus Prime.  I will not stray from its wisdom, and nor shall I \nignore any unforseen danger.&quot;\n\nRat Trap quickly leaps up onto Tucson&#39;s leg and embraces him in rat form.\n\n&quot; Please, I almost lost ya once, I don&#39;t wanna lose ya again.&quot;\n\nTucson could understand where Rat Trap was comming from, and instead of \nbrushing him off, which he would never do, he returns the embrace.\n\n&quot; You won&#39;t, I promise you.  All I ask in return is that you continue the \nfaith.  For that is power that not even Cyclonus has, and it&#39;s that power \nwhich will see all of us through, even myself.&quot;\n\nWith a tear, Rat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;You got it Wheels, I&#39;ll never lose faith, ever.&quot;\n\nTucson then turns to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; As with Talon, I&#39;d like you to join me as well, Lord Elder.  Hydras has \ndone you great wrong and I&#39;d like you to be there to see the tables turn, \nplus, the more help we have, the better off we are. Now, as Optimus would \nsay, TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;i do&quot;said the male&quot;I have to do amends of my behavior... &quot; and looking to\n&gt; Rodimus said&quot;I acted like child and when I,... i tried to create some\n&gt; trouble among you and Nightlight... and create you some troubles with\n&gt; Hydras...

For all the\n&gt; &gt; sufering\n&gt; &gt; that he had done and for all the sufering that he forced us to do... Kup\n&gt; &gt; told me about Perceptor&#39;s situation, He surely knows every corner of \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; dammed place and if he is willing to help as he claims so he will tell \n&gt; &gt; us\n&gt; &gt; all &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kup smiled when he heard that he and Straightshot will work to gether \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; took the Arrow holster, Talon looked toTucson and smiled.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked over at Windlord, a look of shared pain in his face.\n&gt; &quot;There are several of us that he felt the sting of Hydras&#39; power.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus said as he strightened. He looked around at the others, his\n&gt; optics flashing as he contained his own internal anger. &quot;Hydras has\n&gt; long used this method of control to create his troops from the ashes\n&gt; of Maximal protoforms.&quot; His voice deep and controlled. &quot;He must be\n&gt; stopped.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Walking more or less to the middle of the room he turned to face the\n&gt; others, &quot;There is little doubt that Hydras has spent at least some of\n&gt; this time shoring up his base against the same methods that we used to\n&gt; enter before.&quot; Rodimus frowned, &quot;and Cyclonus is a force to be\n&gt; reckoned with as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning his head to look at Tuscon Rodimus continued, &quot;Like you he has\n&gt; felt the power of the Matrix and has been forever changed by it, but\n&gt; in his case it has been corrupted, a dark twisted version of it.&quot;\n&gt; Rodimus clenched his fist, &quot;But do not mistake it for a moment that\n&gt; his wisdom and cunning are greater than they had been before - he\n&gt; knows much more than he reveals.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor crossed his arms over his chest, &quot;Power or no power, we will\n&gt; blast him back to Cybertron!&quot; he said, his voice exuding that\n&gt; exuberant confidence that was ever his trademark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled, &quot;Good, we will need that spirit soon.&quot; He turned to\n&gt; look at the others, &quot;But first we need a concrete plan of action, to\n&gt; be sure that we all act together.&quot; He looked around, &quot;Is anyone\n&gt; keeping watch on Hydras&#39; base?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
