I must&#39;ve read Sharpedge&#39;s reply before \ngoing to school yesterday but didnt&#39; have time to reply to so I forgot)\n\n\nThe Oblitercons/Dark Claw/Flesh Ripper/Demon \nWulf/Sixshot/Ares/Serpentor/Unitron/Chaos/Minion/Ares:\n\n\n\n\nDark One yelled out as 34 rapid blasts sent him back a few feet, slamming to \nhis back, letting out a loud yell.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown turned his head to Dark One.  &quot;Slag!  You dirty Maximal-loving \nfreaks!&quot; ye yelled, transforming into his artillery mode.  &quot;ASSIST DARK ONE!&quot; \nhe yelled loudly, firing off a two foot long shell that would explode on \nimpact (artillery as in cannon, only cannon from 21st century) at Blender.\n\n---\n\nPyro watched Dark One fall.  &quot;Not very nice.&quot; he chuckled, firing off three \nfire balls at Blender.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three blasts from his fusion cannon at Stronghold&#39;s left knee.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired off 25 explosive shells at Stronghold&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf raised his sword to point at the Mafia base, not noticing the two \nmissiles that blew apart on him, sending him flying to the left several feet, \ncrashing to the ground hard.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw saw his leader fall.  &quot;My brother, I will avenge you.  Flesh \nRipper, aid him, I must finish what I have started.&quot; Dark Claw&#39;s voice boomed \nfrom his attack vehicle mode.  Arming the launchers, he fired off two more \nmissiles at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper raised his rifle, firing three blasts from it and 10 rapid optic \nblasts at Sharpedge.  &quot;No one defies Demon Wulf.&quot;\n\n---\n\nSixshot was now turned around, and saw Reptilica&#39;s battle.  Looked kind of \nsad.  Sixshot armed his missile launchers, firing off two missiles at \nJetstorm.\n\n---\n\nAres slowly transformed from his tank mode.  Getting up equally as slow.  \nTaking a step hurt.  Moving at all hurt!  His body was badly burned, and \nthere was a big gaping, leaking hole in his side.  &quot;Sixshot,&quot; he said into \nhis comm. unit, &quot;I&#39;m badly damaged and going back to the Alliance base for \nrepairs.&quot; Ares ended the comlink, hobbling for the Alliance base.\n\n---\n\nUnitron saw the shields flicker and die.  &quot;Victory...&quot; he saw the Oblitercons \nattacking two robots.  &quot;Fools, with their artillery we could end this!&quot; he \nsaid.  He fired off three laser bolts from each rifle.  He knew six laser \nbolts striking into the side of the base wouldn&#39;t destroy it, but he had to \ndo the most damage possible.\n\n---\n\nChaos launched two missiles from his trailer mode at the Mafia base.  He \ntransformed to robot mode, catching some autogun fire in his left leg.  \n&quot;Slag!  I&#39;m out of missiles.  Stupid base.&quot; he said, taking out his laser \nrifle and looking around for a suitable victim.\n\n---\n\nMinion fired off five rapid optic blasts at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor got up slowly.  Standing to his feet, the king cobra cursed.  His \nchest plate was smashed in, and edges of the damaged area were leaking a nice \namount of mech-fluid.  \n\nHe picked up his plasma launcher, firing off its last shot at the Mafia base. \n He tossed the energy-less weapon into subspace, retrieving a plasma rifle.\n\n"}}
