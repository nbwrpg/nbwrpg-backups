The last two\ncarried a bulky electronic thing that took much place.\n\nSquad chief: Welcome, Milady, to Relay City. Before I can let you go\nforward, I would like to make you pass the security test. Please\nremain still.\n\nThe last two guards advanced with the thing and deployed it. It was an\nelaborate scanner that detected certain weapons, but no traces of\ndangerous devices and programs.\n\nSquad Chief: I must now ask you and your guards to leave all your\nweapons in this case. It&#39;s reserved for you only so no one else will\nopen it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; LAdy Spire:\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Spire shuttle just landed and two guards left the shuttle\nbefore she did it, looking around said &quot;Hello? it&#39;s any body in home?&quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nic \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, August 13, 2005 3:35 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Towards the Meeting:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The final preparations had been made.
