She was tired and\n&gt; loosing mech fluid fast, but she wouldn&#39;t risk calling anybot from base\nwith\n&gt; a battle threatening...not just for her.\n&gt; Iron Raptor laied on her side, breathing hard but steadily, that Pred\ncould\n&gt; fight! She snarled as she slowly began to get up, first on her hands and\n&gt; knees, then her knees, finally her feet. She was unsteady but she made her\n&gt; way over to Plintissa and dropped to her knees beside her...mech fluid\n&gt; flowing from the wound in her chest and dripping from her lips...*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Are you... alright?&quot;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Your high school sweetheart-where is he now?
