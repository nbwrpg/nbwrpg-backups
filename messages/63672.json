SHe took a deep breath. &quot;Perhaps it is just\nnot my place, my lord. But I am troubled to see you so up set. Well,\nreally ticked off would be a better term for it.&quot;  She let her regal\nstance soften a bit. Beyond her understanding, it did bother her that\nher leader, one that projected such strength and wisdom would be so\nangry at things. For some dumb reason, it really did bother her. She\nmade to mental note to have her circuits and programs checked later.\nShe raised her head and regained her regal composure. &quot;I just wish\nthere was something I could do.&quot; she said in a soft tone. One could\nalmost hear the caring if one listened closely enough.  \n\nPer her programs, bots, all bots, were expendable, save herself of\ncourse. Even leaders could come and go as fate desided. It never\nbothered her before, why should he matter, but for reasons beyond her\nunderstanding, it did. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras casually looked at Reclusa and said kindly&quot;What&#39;s wrong,\nlittle one?
