What do you think?&quot;\n\nShe heard Veratis thoughts and frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t know what else to \ndo. I didn&#39;t even know I could do that?&quot; She still felt tingly all \nover. \n\nShe looked at Lunarpine. She tried to smile, but his thought read \nmuch like that of Veratis. She sighed and lowered her head. &quot;Yeah, I \nknow. It&#39;s not good. But what else can I do?&quot;\n\nShe walked over to a corner and layed down. She put her massive head \non her huge paws and gave a deep sigh. She wasn&#39;t sure what was \nhappening to her or what would happen next. She thought to \nVeratis. &quot;I have two modes and an inbetween mode. I lost my bot mode \nentirely. I&#39;m no longer a transformer. I&#39;m a freak of nature now.&quot;\n\nShe was feeling down. She was now bigger than Veratis and Lunarpine. \nShe was now afraid that if she moved the wrong way, she could hurt \nthem. She saw how Veratis jumped when she put her head near him to \nnuzzle his shoulder.  She couldn&#39;t stay here and have her love fear \nher or her modes. She sighed and hoped they would find a solution \nsoon.  AS she closed her eyes, she changed into the griffen mode \nwithout realizing it. She opened her eyes and stared down the long \nbeak of the owl.  She jumped and looked at herself. Her wings were \nthere on her back and her head was that of the owl. She layed back \ndown and sighed. She was starting to feel depressed. She looked up at \nLunarpine. &quot;well, sparring is out.....for good.&quot; \n\nShe changed back into polar bear as she rested her head back down and \nstarted to sleep in the corner. But her mind was still working. She \ncould still hear thier thoughts, even in her sleep. And controlling \nthe projection of her dreams was something she had no control over \nyet.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
