As I said, this might not please you \nvery \n&gt; &gt; much, but neither am I hot to the idea. I was sent here to get \n&gt; you, \n&gt; &gt; alive or dead. What I suggest is that you leave, in exile. You \ncan \n&gt; &gt; still have contacts with your crew, which I do not necessarily \n&gt; wish \n&gt; &gt; to see evicted, but the main thing is that you are not on Earth \n&gt; &gt; anymore. We will not chase you or anything, unless you come back. \n&gt; If \n&gt; &gt; you wish, you can negotiate to accomodate yourself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dreadplague looked at Tyrael with a struck air, then at \nDarkangel. \n&gt; &gt; Her voice came out so low that only her fellow warrior could hear \n&gt; her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dread: Is he crazy?
