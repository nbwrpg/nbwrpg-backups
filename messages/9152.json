You could see where the missiles fired \nfrom and shoot at that area, but he is invisible to the optic sensor, and by \ncharges do you mean explosives, or laser blasts?)\n\n\nPyro/Hiss/Breakdown/Scavenger/Punch/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Shockwave/Scattershot:\n\n\n\n\nPyro yelled, charges sending him slamming several feet backwards.  Getting up \nslowly, he felt a slight trickle of mech-fluid leaking down his torso.  \n\n&quot;You son of a--ooooh, the forest...thinking of heading for the forest?  \nHmmm...That gives me a reason to burn it...so they don&#39;t escape.  Yeeessssss, \nso they can&#39;t escape, that&#39;s a good reason.&quot;\n\nTransforming to his tank mode, the obsessed Predacon targeted with his \ncannon, firing three fire balls into the forest, speeding towards it to use \nhis flame thrower and really start some fun.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch cursed, being slammed to his back from the charges.  He slowly \ngot up, realizing there was a slight fringe effect where he was, his cloaking \nability damaged.\n\n-Slag- he said in his mind, raising a pincher.  &quot;You&#39;ll pay for that!&quot; he \nfired an energy-singature seeking missile off at Dinobot&#39;s back.\n\n---\n\nManterror heard missile fire, turning, spotted a Maximal opening fire on the \nPredacons.\n\n&quot;Hmmm...I think...I&#39;ll take out the one who isn&#39;t firing...seems safer.&quot; he \nraised both clawed appendages, firing two ion disks off at Tavatron&#39;s legs \nfrom behind.\n\n---\n\nScavenger screamed, transforming, leaping into the air, part of the \nparalyzing beam hitting his foot, the Predacon crashing to the ground.  \nPushing himself up, he jumped up on the back of Pyro&#39;s tank mode.\n\n&quot;Hey, Pyro, hehe.  How about a ride?&quot;\n\n&quot;Got an energon?&quot;\n\n&quot;No...&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t pick up hitch hikers!&quot; Pyro swerved quickly and unexpectedly to the \nleft, sending Scavenger screaming off the tank, crashing to the ground, Pyro \ncontinuing his short journey for the forest, firing off another fireball at \nthe forest.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown chuckled, running.  Calculating and firing, he fired a grenade off \nthat would explode on impact a few meters in front of Dinobot and Tavatron, \nhoping to keep them out of the forest they were obviously running to.  \nActivating his com, the Pred replied to Zardus&#39; transmission.\n\n&quot;WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHASE AND ABOUT TO KILL MAXIMALS!  WE HAVE NO TIME \nFOR YOUR FEMININE WANTS!&quot; he screamed, continuing to chase.\n\n\n\n---\n\nHiss cursed, blasts digging into his chest plate, knocking him back several \nfeet, steadying himself, he continued to pursue the two raptors on the ground.\n\n\n===\n\nShockwave&#39;s long range scanners picked up a few Maximal energy signatures, \nand over a dozen Predacon signatures, and he was picking up heavy weapons \nfire.\n\n&quot;The Maximals are pathetic, with one of their bases nearly obliterated.  \nLetting them lose four members will not help, and will shift the balance to \ngreatly.  That is not acceptable as of yet.&quot;\n\n\n===\n\nScattershot clapped one hand against his chest a few times.  &quot;Goodie, \nZardus,&quot; he said into his comm. unit, &quot;Can we paint the base pink?  Oooh, or \nmaybe purple?&quot; he asked in his comm., cackling madly, firing off a few rounds \nat Prowl.\n\n"}}
