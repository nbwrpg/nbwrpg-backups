The enemy.\nHowever, the order had been to cease-fire and from what his scans brought in \nfrom the remainder of the field, many Alliance members had done just that \nand gathered around FZ&#39;s position. Yet there were only a few Maximals around \nthe commanders. Which spoke plenty about Maximal faith.\nDinobot didn&#39;t like the Maximals now. They were too weak, but only because \nthey didn&#39;t know the meaning of war. That numbers were far more important \nthen how one could fight. They also fought alone, where pairs would be much \nbetter. Why else did Tavatron and himself stay close? Besides the company.\nHis mind once again on track with Tavatron he looked towards her position, \nfinding that she was a bit more damaged this time. Though he was sure that \nshe was probably sick of him coming to the rescue.\nBut once he had seen her draw back with her staff he began to walk towards \nthe commanderï¿½s position. Not simply because she had ordered it, but to get \nright into the fighting if it began again...and most of the Alliance was \nthere with FZ now.\nHe was tense and injured, which made him rather dangerous if one would be \nsmart and realize it.\nDinobot passed Tavatron by a few meters, not looking towards her but \ncontinuing on his way towards the growing crowd. His optics continuously \ntrained on the enemy as he drew closer. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
