He&#39;ll probably give the Maximals a rough time, and keep \nthem off our backs for a while.&quot; Astroblast murmurs, &quot;We can use \nit, but it can&#39;t stay here, Rippersnapper would go ballistic... there \nwould be no restraining him.&quot; Astroblast leans back to ready, and \nsays openly to Megatron, &quot;What should we do with the dissident?&quot; \nRefering to Firestrike.\n\nUnkonwing to Megatron and Astroblast, Switchblade had been \nlistening. &lt;&lt;Hmmm, interesting proposistion.&gt;&gt; He frowns at \nFirestrike. &quot;Grrr, DAMNIT... stupid faulty programming...&quot; he says \ntrying to cover for Firestrike somewhat, so that he doesn&#39;t get \nmassacred. &quot;Disable him, and I&#39;ll have him repaired.&quot; He says to \nMegs. &lt;&lt;I thought that i programmed him to be a follower, not a \nleader... something is really wrong here. Nothing that I can&#39;t fix \nanyway.&gt;&gt; He smiles at the last thought, then his face drifts back \nto impassiveness as he prepares for the wrath know as Megatron... \nHe only hopes that Megatron doesn&#39;t connect him with Firestrike&#39;s \nodd behaviour, even HE is baffled.\n\n\n\nOn 28 Jun 2001, at 6:41, LurkerAbyss wrote:\n\n&gt; ::Slaughter::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Slaughter couldn&#39;t recall anything too valuable, but he figured he\n&gt; should at least tell them who he wanted revenge on and stuff. \n&gt; Menasor&#39;s hand around his head really hurt.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Hrrr.......I was once a bot in the Alliance, named Skulletron. \n&gt;      My\n&gt; beast mode was a hyena.
