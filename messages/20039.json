Something wasn&#39;t right, Prowl knew that. He could feel the \npain in his wing, he could feel his dented torso and limbs, but he \ncouldn&#39;t feel his head. Trying to access optics or audio sensors, \nProwl&#39;s system reports that they were not there.\n\nThe Maximal reaches up to touch his head. It was there, but there \nmust be a broken connection somewhere along the way to his core \nproccessor. His scanners reported that Iron Raptor was near him, but \nhe couldn&#39;t say, hear, or see anything. He couldn&#39;t even feel his \nhead, much less nod it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; * Iron Raptor knew that he was going to try and stop her now, and \njust as \n&gt; Prowl was about to dig his talons into her she was getting ready to \nkick \n&gt; back and get him away.\n&gt; But instead, when she expected to feel him grab her she heard a few \nfrantic \n&gt; flapps of wings, a sickening crack, a few more cracks which were \nbranches of \n&gt; the forest she had just entered and another bonysounding snap.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked back over her shoulder as she ran to look for Prowl, but \nthe \n&gt; forst was to dense to see anything in it other then the bushes and \ntree.\n&gt; Her eyes scanned the area...but a little accident of her own was \njust about \n&gt; to happen!\n&gt; Not looking where she was going she ran smack dab right into a \nlarge tree \n&gt; trunk, her shoulder hit first and the trunk shattered from the \nimpact.\n&gt; Brought to a dead stop she staggered back for a few steps before \nshe simply \n&gt; sat down hard on her rear, sitting there stunned for a few moments \nas she \n&gt; just watched the tree creek and goran as it slowly fell to the \nground, \n&gt; taking a few others with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then she simply shook her hed and looked down at her shoulder, \na little \n&gt; yellow mech-fluid leeking from it. Nothing seriouse.\n&gt; Iron Raptor got to herfeet and then raised to her hind legs, taking \nthe \n&gt; weight off her shoulder which was already damaged.\n&gt; She looked around the new clearing for a moment before turning \nback, knowing \n&gt; that Prowl would have to be there somewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; It wasn&#39;t long before she finally found him, just freshly fallen \nfrom the \n&gt; trees above...since all the branches were broken and hanging.\n&gt; He must have ran into a branch as he swooped down on her, then went \nthrough \n&gt; everything else until he finally landed on his stomach on the \nforest floor.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and walked up to him, seeing his wing which \nlooked to be \n&gt; broken. Worry on her features.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Prowl?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt;transforms and falls to the ground, landing on his stomach as he \nhits\n&gt; &gt;several more branches.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
