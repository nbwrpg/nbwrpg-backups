The minion is fast and ag=\r\nile, using the air to his best \nadvantage, and the sweeps that litter the s=\r\nkies almost as cover. The \nsingle minion takes off, drawing fire away from =\r\nthe besieging sweeps, \nhis agility serving him in good stead as he maneuver=\r\ns tightly in the \nskies, his armor becoming peppered with the few shots for=\r\ntunate \nenough to actually hit him!\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Legacy&#39;s shielding continues to hold due to a new=\r\n influx \nof power coming from the Ark. With a renewed vigor Legacy&#39;s weapon=\r\ns \norient on the incoming minion sweeps and fires, a bright flash of \nlight=\r\n erupting from his primary cannon mount. His armored tank mode a \nstalwart =\r\ndefender of the ark! \n&gt;  \n&gt; --------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As this happened twin missiles fly out from just behind the main \npart o=\r\nf the battle lines, sailing through the midst of the host of \nsweeps fixing=\r\n themselves on target. With a burst of power Jhiaxus&#39; \nmissiles push forwar=\r\nd towards Tumult! \n&gt; \n&gt; The minion soldier for his part has not been paying=\r\n the proper \nattention, seeing as he has been spending his time avoiding th=\r\ne \ncopious amounts of fire power coming from the Maximals and Autbots at \nt=\r\nhe ark - so it is not until the last second that his proximity and \nlock on=\r\n alerts come to life, just before Jhiaxus&#39; missiles hit him \ndead on and hi=\r\ns world erupts in light and pain!!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Myrmidon fired sev=\r\neral shots at the encroaching \nsweeps, keeping them off Jhiaxus! However th=\r\ne six-changer takes \nseveral hits as well, the last few biting through his =\r\narmor! He \nbegins to circle towards the ground!\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Nighstrike DarkFate moved closer the ark and op=\r\nened fire against \nit, their twin fire power opening a new level of explosi=\r\nve power \nagainst the ark&#39;s shield strength. Once again the shielding flick=\r\ner, \nstutters and then with a sickening suddenness the shield dies, as \nwha=\r\nt appears to be a ball of darkness engulfs the immediate area \naround the a=\r\nrk!\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Scorpo=\r\nnok&#39;s tail attacks are remarkably effective. \nPerhaps they were not expecti=\r\nng something like that, or perhaps \nsomething else is brewing in the air! A=\r\nt any rate twin explosions \nappear as two more sweeps fall to the ground. F=\r\nour are left, flying \nattack patterns, harrying the lone Scorponok!  But th=\r\ney are now more \nwary and cautious then before as they fire again and weave=\r\n their way \nthrough the air around him. \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras&#39; transformation into beast mode causes the swee=\r\nps attacking \nhim to back up for a moment as several are fried by the outpo=\r\nuring of \nheat and fire! Decibel for her part pulled up, allowing the sweep=\r\ns to \ntake the brunt of the attack. &quot;Is that all you got. Bad breath???&quot; \nS=\r\nhe howls with laughter as she banks around, &quot;Take a tic tac!&quot; she \nfires tw=\r\nin missiles at Hydras as the other sweeps come around to also \nhelp her tak=\r\ne on the predicon commander!\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus watched as Dark Rodimus came down, as a strange calmness =\r\n\nemanating from him.  Rodimus&#39; kick is perhaps faster than cyclonus \nhad an=\r\nticipated or perhaps he simply allowed it to hit, in either \ncase the minio=\r\nn commander rolled with the sweeping kick and hit the \nground shoulder firs=\r\nt and continued spinning to rise elegantly to his \nfeet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus sho=\r\nok his head as he looked at Rodimus rather than \nattacking, &quot;The power you =\r\nonce had, the power of the matrix, its \nwisdom, its knowledge is now coursi=\r\nng through my circuits. I have \npower you do not yet understand, or perhaps=\r\n have just forgotten. You \nare less than what you were before and I am more=\r\n. How do you propose \nto beat me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus shrugged slightly as he se=\r\nttled into a combat stance, his \npalms beginning to glow once more, &quot;Were i=\r\nt up to me I would let you \nlive. But it is not up to me.&quot; Cyclonus gesture=\r\nd to Rodimus to attack \nwhen he was ready, &quot;Come to your death, Unicron has=\r\n decreed it!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
