He had been doing so well keeping it supressed the last few days, since meeting Wolfblade then Blacknightmare.  But it felt like the burning rage was returning, and didn&#39;t know when he&#39;d be able to calm down.  But thankfully it suddenly melted away when she suprised him with a passionate kiss.  At first total suprise kept him from doing anything, but he melted into the kiss and reciprocated, letting his love for her flow through him to her.  he held her closer, not willing to part with her for anything else in the world.  He&#39;d have his spark ripped out of his chest before then.  He made a realization, one that would change their lives forever, but did not break the moment of passion, feeling the need to continue it until he no longer could.\n\nDark Mouse &lt;raccoon7679@...&gt; wrote:\nWolfblade::\n\nShe felt his arms holding her.
