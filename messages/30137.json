So, as she was \nalways use to, she did it all herself.\nAt a console she called up a 3D picture of the CF and all the surrounding \nland, every signatire within the scann appearing as a red dot on the grid.\nShe looks over her shoulder-plate at Epyon as he walks into the room and \nsits down, half turning to him with a straight look.*\n\n&quot; Where were you?&quot;\n\n* She had every right to know, because it had taken him a while to get here \nafter she had told Prowl to ask him to do so.\nBut just then Prowl caught her attention as he walked into the room, seeing \nhim salute and nodded at him to be at ease.\nShe kept her attention on him as he spoke, lifting a brow and looking \nFiredrill over.\nThis new transformer could be of use, but she might have to meet the two \nothers that Prowl spoke of. But her thoughts convayed something else all \ntogether.\n&lt; After that battle I trust no one outside of this faction. But, we&#39;ll see.&gt;\nShe looked Firedrill over again.*\n\n&quot; Firedrill, what are your tallents?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
