And \nI&#39;m sorry I&#39;m only averaging one post a night. It&#39;s because of school and my \ndad working out of home and he hogs the comp. But he goes back to the office \non Monday probably so I should get the computer at nights.)\n\n\nVulois\n\nVulois heard Windrazor&#39;s comment.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a good chance we took a wrong turn, but I&#39;m pretty sure we went the \nright way. I remember these nooks. But if we took the wrong way, we&#39;re \ndoomed.&quot;\n\nVulois left that thought to sink in.\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq/Brix\n\n&quot;Cybertron?&quot;Fliq said,&quot; I...I don&#39;t really know It&#39;s been years since I saw \nit. Let me just tell you it&#39;s nothing like earth. No water, no plants \nno...no life! All metalic creatures, who either have no transformations or \nlike jets and other equipment. There&#39;s very tall buildings and and busy \nstreets. I remember....there was this one building, I think it was a weapon \nmanufacturer. My friends and I would sneak in, being the kids we were, and \nlooking at the weapons. We were eventually caught, and beaten by our \nparents. But it was worth it. I&#39;ll tell ya...it&#39;s like no place any where \nelse in the world. And I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever see it again, because it \ndoesn&#39;t have an orbit. It drifts wildly through space. It&#39;s probably \nmillions of miles from where I last saw it. Ah, but Earth is like no place \nin the universe either, with it&#39;s lushes life. And this is where we are \nneeded. I know that some people don&#39;t believe in destiny, but I think \neverything I&#39;ve done was to prepare me for this war. This wasn&#39;t the plan. \nAll 10 of us would come, and with the extra power we would easily defeat the \nPreds. But it wasn&#39;t to be.&quot;\n\nFliq sat quiet thinking about how he got to this point in his life, until \nBrix came in.\n\n&quot;Hey guys! I found the tools, so let&#39;s get working. Oh, and their was this \nweird sound following me everywhere, but it&#39;s gone now.&quot;\n\nBrix distributed the tools and started removing the hull.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream watched Testifyer just walk off and give him a dirty look. Almost \nas soon as he got outside a fight broke out. Starscream fixed a problem with \nthe structure and than went outside and saw Testifyer.\n\n&quot;You...you hurt KitKat, and than walk away from me? NO ONE WALKS AWAY FROM \nME! And stop attacking this cave. I am Starscream of the Predacons, and this \nis our castle. As it will soon be OUR WORLD! JET MODE!&quot;\n\nStarscream went to Jet Mode and and charged Testifyer head on with lasers \nfiring 10 shots.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron follows the Alliance Army headed for the fight.\n\n&quot;Good! Finaly a chance to show off my skills in combat!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nZava\n\nZava decided this would be a good time to get on the good side of Deemos.\n\n&quot;That bot, over there(Terrorsaur) would make a perfect target!&quot;\n\nZava turned on her jet pack and flew towards Terrorsaur, firing four shots \nof her plasma cannons.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
