With an insane yell, he pulls out his sword,\n&gt;jumping at DarkMouse with the sword stabbing downwards.\n&gt;\n&gt;When Mosquitor&#39;s sword&#39;s tip is inches from DarkMouse, a shape launches\n&gt;itself from the bushes, slamming it&#39;s foot across the predacon&#39;s face.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ramulus lands, grinning with the excitement of battle as he sees Mosquitor\n&gt;fall to the ground unconscious, the predacon&#39;s sword falling harmlessly \n&gt;near\n&gt;him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ramulus takes out his double-slagmaker cannon, aiming it at Counter Punch \n&gt;and\n&gt;firing.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Striker slams through a tree as the shots hit him. He stands up, his chest\n&gt;shooting sparks and his face plate burned only to be hit by the debree from\n&gt;Shockwave&#39;s missiles. He looks around at DarkMouse, Ramulus, and the other\n&gt;maximals in the area, and, deciding that they had a chance, turns to fire \n&gt;at\n&gt;Injector.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
