Plintissa wasn&#39;t mov=\r\ning. Dracona smiled and walked back toward her base. A dagger flew into Dra=\r\ncona&#39;s back. She spun around and grabbed the dagger in pain. Plintissa stoo=\r\nd there.\n\n                  &quot;You do not know when to give up, you fool, but=\r\n never mind that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t b=\r\ne able to be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand cover=\r\ned and flung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg=\r\n. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her dow=\r\nn. Dracona once again turned to her saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracon=\r\na fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dodged. Dracona started to burn everythi=\r\nng with fire beams. Plintissa still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good =\r\nfighter, but it wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life that she discovered he=\r\nr true fighting power. Plintissa beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts=\r\n were flung everywhere as Plintissa spun a simple stick through the air. Dr=\r\nacona raised the saw blade and sliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed =\r\nand sliced Plintissa several hundred times. Plintissa fell.\n\n              =\r\n    &quot;Th weak move aside and die so the strong can survive. As ancient as th=\r\ne Cosmos, that has always been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintissa, you =\r\nwere a good friend, but don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just business.&quot; Dr=\r\nacona said.\n                   \n                  Dracona pulled back the s=\r\naw blade and thrust it towards Plintissa. Plintissa grabbed her arm from ea=\r\nrlier and threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintis=\r\nsa, but as she did, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade=\r\n flew up. Dracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she fir=\r\nst arived on the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pi=\r\neces everywhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n            =\r\n      &quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your prom=\r\nise.&quot; And Dracona died smiling. Plintissa remembered that she promised Drac=\r\nona that she would never leave her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid=\r\n ran everywhere and she got weaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over t=\r\no Plintissa. He was crying, too.\n\n                  &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it h=\r\nad to end this way.&quot; Plintissa whispered.\n\n                  &quot;Why are you l=\r\neaving me, Plintissa?

He contained it in a capsule.\n\n             =\r\n     &quot;Plintissa, if you leave me, I&#39;ll...have no more reason to live, all m=\r\ny friends are gone, my helping days are over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n              =\r\n    &quot;Your helping days are never over, and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plint=\r\nissa said.\n\n                  &quot;This isn&#39;t some lame thing about how you&#39;ll =\r\nalways be in my heart, is it?&quot;\n\n                  &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; =\r\nPlintissa whispered. Artist looked at Team Ultima&#39;s base. It was destroyed,=\r\n the funny thing was, that it was destroyed by Dracona, the very one, along=\r\n with Plintissa, that originally built it. And there it was, sticking above=\r\n ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks at the base and sighs.\n\n       =\r\n           &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we have to leave.&quot; Sinesis sa=\r\nys. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n                  &quot;Blizzar=\r\nd, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n              =\r\n    Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her and =\r\nfloated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he needed to do. He opene=\r\nd his chest compartment and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plintis=\r\nsa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.\n\n                  &quot;Till all are =\r\none.&quot; Artist whispered really low. Plintissa told him she still loved him. =\r\nArtist was overjoyed! Plintissa was with him now, and now they could never =\r\nbe seperated again. Artist, completely ignoring Blizzard and Sinister, and =\r\nSinesis and Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n                  &quot;Artist, now =\r\nwe need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa said. (Remember, only A=\r\nrtist can hear Plintissa now) Artist headed toward the Maximal base, there =\r\nDracona would get a new body, one she could not attack anyone ever again in=\r\n, and where she can always be helpful. Artist held up the contained, Dracon=\r\na&#39;s spark still inside.\n\n                  &quot;I love you.&quot; Artist said seemin=\r\ngly to nobody.\n\n                  &quot;I love you too.&quot; Plintissa said to Artis=\r\nt.

Dracona fired an ice beam=\r\n, but Plintissa dodged. \n                  Dracona started to burn everythi=\r\nng with fire beams. Plintissa \n                  still avoids it.
