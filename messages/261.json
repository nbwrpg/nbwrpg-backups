&quot; My talents consist of hacking, spying, setting complicated traps,\nweapons\n&gt; hot-wiring, repair, and making harm to the Maximals.\n&gt; My personal report indicates loyalty and trust, however, if a traitor is\n&gt; found within the same strong-hold as I, I&#39;m the first one to slit his\n&gt; throat!\n&gt; I obey every command to the letter and ensure that my fellow team mates do\n&gt; it as well.\n&gt; I do not like failure!\n&gt; My pass times consist of exploring, occasional reading, repairing and\n&gt; experimenting with weapons that I have just built,and making trouble and\n&gt; just plain Hell for the Maximals.\n&gt; Is that all you wish to know, My Lord?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;
