He dumped them all around the hunter and went to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.  His vision was blurred \n&gt; &gt; somewhat, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more \nalert.  \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he \n&gt; &gt; settled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.  He touched his foot to \n&gt; it, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.  His shoulder \nimmediatly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.  He set up and tried to break his bonds, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.  He scooted forward and touched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.  He quickly healed the rest of his body and \n&gt; scooted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.  She walked over and pushed him back \nonto \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bed.  She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.  She repeated the same proceedure on \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.  She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.  He tried to get up, but his \narms \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.

&gt; &gt; someone&#39;s quarters, and dumped him on a bed.&nbsp; His left &lt;BR&gt;shoulder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly severed, and his joints, where a signifigant amount of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; semi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; organic flesh was, were worn and thinned.&nbsp; Hellplague look &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disapprovingly at the sight and then turned to\n Splattercannon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I want you and Necross to re- energize him, and see if you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; repair him.&nbsp; I must go and tend to the Sweeps.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon nodded and beckoned Necross to enter.&nbsp; For a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; moment &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they both looked down at the battered and bound hunter before &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Just get a pile of energon cubes and dump them here,&quot; &lt;BR&gt;Necross &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; said before turning to leave.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon grabbed the Minion by the shoulder before &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; addressing him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;But Hellplague told us to repair him.&nbsp; For whatever &lt;BR&gt;purpose, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wants him alive.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Necross scofted before shaking his shoulder free from his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; companion&#39;s grip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Not my problem.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splattercannon fumed a\n moment as Necross set off for parts &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Unicron unknown, then proceeded to the nearest enegon &lt;BR&gt;storage.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gathered an armfull of cubes and brought them back to Malice&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; residence.&nbsp; He dumped them all around the hunter and went to &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Repair bay to nurse his own injuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Malice finally came back online.&nbsp; His vision was blurred &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; somewhat, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but the familiar hum of energon cubes was made him more &lt;BR&gt;alert.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tied to sit up, but his left arm was pinned under him, so he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; settled &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for wiggling over to the closest cube.&nbsp; He touched his foot to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and began absorbing the energy from it.&nbsp; His shoulder &lt;BR&gt;immediatly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; began to heal itself.&nbsp; He set up and tried to break his bonds, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they were nearly unbreakable.&nbsp; He scooted forward and touched &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; several cubes.&nbsp; He quickly healed the rest of his body and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scooted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to the edge of the bed. He was about to try and stand up when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague pranced in.&nbsp; She walked over and pushed him back &lt;BR&gt;onto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bed.&nbsp; She put what looked like gravitity weights on his ankles &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then unbound his feet.&nbsp; She repeated the same proceedure on &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wrists.&nbsp; She then smiled and hit a button on her comm link and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice was pinned to the bed.&nbsp; He tried to get up, but his &lt;BR&gt;arms &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; legs were not going anywhere.&nbsp; Hellplague smiled and straddled &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; hunter&#39;s mid section, leaning forward and supporting &lt;BR&gt;herself &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; her arms resting on his chest.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Now, I think you had better just be an obediant little &lt;BR&gt;lizard &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; stay here where I can watch you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She leaned down until her face was inches from his.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Or else I may have to &#39;disipline&#39; you.&quot;she added with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; smirk.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Tag minions&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
