FZ sits back. Magmatron had definately been a worthwhile \nally.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Magmatron finished the device he had been working on since he \nhad gotten to the beast wars. It was a transdimensional gateway. The \nonly signatures that could go through were Destron signatures.\n&gt;     Magmatron took direct control over the Queen, his ultimate \ncreation. She called her minions back to the Sulaco. Then she walked \nthrough the gateway, dissappearing into the dimension of Magmatron&#39;s \nchoice.\n&gt;     He hit a few more buttons and set the Sulaco to destroy any \nopening in the mountain. This was nobody would get in to find his \nresearch, and since only a few people would know of the Sulaco he \nwouldn&#39;t worry. He then sent a comm to Zardus.\n&gt;     &quot;Alliance Commander Zardus,&quot; He started. &quot;I am dropping out of \nthis war. I am sending a download of all my finding on this planet, \nand how to use them to your advantage, I wish you luck, and when I \nreturn I hope to find that you have the utmost advantage. Good-Bye.&quot;\n&gt;     The transmission ended with the sending of the downloaded \ninformation. It contained all the information regarding the Xenomorph \nDNA, how to graft it onto an existing warrior. And it was sent triple \nencoded, tight beam sucrity line, directly to the Iron Fist&#39;s command \nroom.\n&gt;     The Destrons were all now returning to the Sulaco. Dachande had \nstayed behind, he still had business to take care of. Now that they \nwere all onboard they all walked through the gateway. Jynx, \nPraetorian, Cerberus, Obitus, Fame, Bellum, AEger. They all went to \nthe new dimension.\n&gt;     &quot;Destrons, if you want to stay on earth, well, then you need to \nleave the Sulaco within the next 20 minutes, or else you will be \nstuck,&quot; Magmatron broadcast to all Destron units, in the feild or at \nbase. \n&gt;     Then he turned and faced the Gateway. He started to step \nthrough, then remembered something. He grabbed his data tracks that \nhad everything they knew about Prime and the Autobots. Then he \nstepped through. The Gateway shut down behind him, only able to be \nactivated by his hand. He saw his new home, it was a great place, \nhuge, with many new worlds to conqure. He would be happy here.\n\n\n"}}
