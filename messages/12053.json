They could wait a moment.\nShe heard Feline speak but she held up a hand in her direction, giving the sign to be silent while Arcangel spoke.\nIron Raptor nodded as Arcangel finished, crossing her arms in thought. *\n\n� This plan of yours has a very good chance of being pulled off. But I have a few conditions before I agree to this: First, not any other bot in this station is to know of this plan of yours until I give the orders. We can�t have any security breaches. If the enemy caught wind of this they would be all over us like flies on a dung heap! Second, I want all of the extra rooms built onto the ship by the Maximals while Liono was in command destroyed. Third, the Autobots OR engines don�t go anywhere near that ship until it�s repaired. I know for a fact that we�ll be attacked while that ship is under reconstruction and both of those are too vital to be damaged. Not to mention, I want both of them cloaked while we move them, the less the enemy sees what we�re doing the better.\nI�ll also see what Iris can come up with; she might be able to shield the Ark while it�s being repaired.\nSo, what do you say?�\n\n* She looked at them with a fairly determined look, one that was stubborn as well as courageous. Those were pretty easy conditions to follow by, but if they wanted to argue about them then she would let them. Besides, she was only bot, she made mistakes too.\nIron Raptor took in a deep breath but then turned her head in Felines direction, studying the bot as she looked at her.\nBut then her optics turned to Chordate, lifting a brow-plate at his presence. She hadn�t called him, but since the fembot was new she guessed that he had shown her the way.\nYet, by the look in his eyes she could see that he was a bit annoyed by Feline being called there, probably busy with her for some reason or another. But if she didn�t know any better, she would say that there was the beginning of a little couple there.\nBut this wasn�t the time to think about such things, she continued to look at him and then Feline but her expression softened from it�s serious look she used to speak to Arcangel.*\n\n� Yes, I had called you here to speak with you, Feline.�\n\n* Her optics lifted to Chardate with a pleased look.*\n\n� And thank you for escorting her here, Chordate. It was most kind.�\n\n* Her gaze then returned to Feline and studied her again, not really seeing much other then a simple fembot who was in the audience of her commander. A little nervous but that was expected.\nIron Raptor smiled at the nervous cat, but then a sigh escaped her throat.*\n\n� But I have to postpone out meeting for a moment, I have other things that call my attention. If you please, I would like you both to wait in the next room while I deal with this. I�ll be there shortly.�\n\n* Iron Raptor gestured towards the smaller Conference Room and the back with her hand, basically telling them that she would meet them there in a few moments.\nThe wouldn�t be there long, basically because this meeting with Arcangel wouldn�t take long. She would make sure of that.\nThere was something important she had to discuss with Feline, something that she had been concerned about ever since she had gotten back from the Alliance.*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
