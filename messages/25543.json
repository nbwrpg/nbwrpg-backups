There was little doubt that Proto would fall in this battle, \nprobably Grimmler as well, them being the two most damaged.\n\n&quot;Allright. I&#39;ll go with Grimmler. Firearm and Proto will be the \nsecond team. I guess you and Prowl&#39;ll be together.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Iron Raptor for a long second and then slides a panel \naway on his head, edjecting a disk. He hands it to Iron Raptor, &quot;In \ncase I don&#39;t make it through this battle, that disk has everything I \nknow about the Cybertronian Fire, which is everything. You now have \nthe codes and everything.&quot;\n\nHe glances out at the battle. &quot;Try to be careful. The Maximals need \nyou.&quot;\n\nKluster jogs off toward the battle, taking out his missile launcher \nand cursing Angel Prime&#39;s existence. Because of one arrogant bot who \ncouldn&#39;t accept peaceful terms, many Maximals would now die. Proto \nfollows behind Kluster, taking out a rifle and knowing that he was \nmarching to certain doom as he limps after his commander.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler and Firearm look at each other, nodding. They set off toward \nthe battle, each arming their weapons.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl walks up to Iron Raptor, looking sadly after the departing \nMaximals. -That&#39;s what&#39;ll save us,- he says, -Maximal devotion. They \nknow they probably won&#39;t live through this.-\n\nHe hugs and kisses her. -Just in case we don&#39;t make it, I want you to \nknow that I&#39;ll always love you.-\n\nAnd with that, Prowl once again takes out his staff, feeling the \nenergy surge through his fingers as he takes hold of it. -Let&#39;s use \nour link to our advantage. We can relay to each other everything we \nsee. Deal?-\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor watches as Angel Prime and his small group of \nfollowers are \n&gt; fired upon by the Alliance, watching with cold eyes as charges head \ntowards \n&gt; the Maximals which had chosen to ignore her.\n&gt; In one pert of her mind she thought that it served them right, they \nwould \n&gt; have been safe if they had listened. Thinking that maybe they would \nlearn a \n&gt; lesson by this, if they lived through it.\n&gt; But Iron Raptor knew something that some of the bots already did or \nmight \n&gt; not know.\n&gt; If they stayed here only a small amout of their forces would be \nmowed down, \n&gt; but if they fought too then the Alliance would fire back and the \nwar would \n&gt; be on again.\n&gt; Chordate, she knew, wasn&#39;t going to be saved. But the Maximals \nbeing fired \n&gt; upon had the chance to be. Plus...the captives in the ship could be \nused to \n&gt; ease the force of the battle and maybe think twice.\n&gt; But the captive idea wasn&#39;t going to be used.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked at Prowl as ke spoke, then looking at the \nremainder of \n&gt; the Maximals behind her.\n&gt; There were all edgy and itchy to fight, ready to come to the \ndefence of \n&gt; their comrads. And even though Angel Prime was the last person she \nwanted to \n&gt; save right there and then, she couln&#39;t leave the Maximals out there \neither.\n&gt; She sighed and nodded.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll help him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then looked at the rest of the Maximals, still not \nsure if \n&gt; what she was doing was right. She could be sending a lot of \nMaximals to \n&gt; their deaths by doing this. But since when did Maximals leave \ncomrads \n&gt; without a hope?*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re moving out. Charge yourselves and pick someone to join with \nyou on \n&gt; the field. No point in getting picked off once we&#39;re out there. \nGoota have \n&gt; someone watching your back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She took the sword and slashed the blade out towards the battle.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; They&#39;re out there slaughtering our own kind! I don&#39;t know about \nall of you \n&gt; but I&#39;m not about to let them get away with it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Her expression became hard.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Firing in pairs will increase our chance to defeat them. Picking \nthem off \n&gt; one by one, one pair putting all of their firepower into one bot \nuntil it \n&gt; either backs off or falls. Then moving onto the next. It might take \na while \n&gt; but if we work together it&#39;ll pay off. The gustalt bots are our \nfirst \n&gt; targets, especially the ones which make up the legs. Without legs \nthey can&#39;t \n&gt; move.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked over the Maximals.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Now how many of you want to go out there and show those slags \nwhat defeat \n&gt; feels like?!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then turned back towards the battle and took a step towards \nit.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Let&#39;s go!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
