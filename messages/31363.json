He \nremembered his &quot;discussion&quot; with Chameleon but very little after \nthat. &quot;I knew I shouldn&#39;t have taken that 5th of nebulan fuel&quot; he \nmuttered placing his fingers to his temples. His pain fealt as if it \nwould break out of his head and travel down his arms. He knew that \nsomething bad had happened, he could feal the cr chamber keeping him \nsedated. He looked around the room &quot;BIG MISTAKE&quot; he thought as the \nroom seemed to spin. He would&#39;ve tossed his &quot;cookies&quot; (little comp. \njoke) if he had an organic stomach. His adrenaline rush had gone but \nnow he had to deal with the hangover that followed.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: dcoburn \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, March 29, 2001 12:14 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: BlackFortress&#39;s Cr\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ::Orchestra::\n&gt;    \n&gt;       Orchestra nodded, and patted Chameleon on the back.\n&gt;    \n&gt;       &quot;Ya, let&#39;s drink.
