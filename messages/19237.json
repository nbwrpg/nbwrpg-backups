Stay here.  Megatron said he was leaving. So I&#39;m waiting for \nhim to fall back and leave our terratory.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe looked up at KitKit and mutters,&quot;Getting along is hardly the \nwords I&#39;d use.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s alright DarkMouse.  He probably saved your life \nout there.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse:\n&quot;Like I&#39;m worth saving.&quot;\n\nKitKat::\nShe growled slightly,&quot;Every bot on my teamis worth saving. You, \nDrillbit, Destructor, War, Famine, Starscream, they all are worth \nsaving and fighting for.  You are no different than anyone else in my \npack. You are just as important to my team as all the others.  \nEveryone is worth it. Every single bot on my team is worth fighting \nfor. And don&#39;t you forget it.&quot;\n\nDarkMouse:\nShe walked off into the ship, mumbling about how she wasn&#39;t like the \nothers.\n\nKitKat::\nShe shook her head and looked up at War,&quot;She&#39;s been like that since \nshe was with Megatron. I feel sorry for her. She was programmed by a \nbot named Scorponok. Ever since, she&#39;s been in this, deep blue funk \nso to speak. One day, she&#39;ll come around. I&#39;m certain of it. All it \nwill take is a little time.&quot;\nShe looked out across the field and then back at War, &quot;Would you \nplease go to the bridge and check the long range scanners.  I want to \nmake sure that Megatron is leaving the area.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;That wouldn&#39;t have helped. Just think before you act.
