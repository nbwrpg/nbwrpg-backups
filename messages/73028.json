It was obviouslthat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he was full =\r\nof some sort of dark power.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS stood up angrilly for a =\r\nmoment but then backed up a step,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as if he were seeing something in MA=\r\nGMATRON&#39;s optics that even he had\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not seen before.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SABERBACK=\r\n nodded as he pointed at the approaching TUSCON and those\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that were wi=\r\nth him. &quot;They won&#39;t reach us yet, but soon. We must be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ready for the f=\r\ninal stage.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Stage of what?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he looked away=\r\n from MAGMATRON to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; glance at SABERBACk and then at the severaly weaken=\r\ned OPTIMUS PRIME.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Him? He is no threat to us!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; With a shake=\r\n of his head SABERBACK looked at RODIMUS, &quot;Don&#39;t worry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about that boy,=\r\n just get ready to defend yourself!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To ris=\r\ne up to an impossible challenge meant having to do something\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; extraor=\r\ndinary. But deeds of extraordinary feats did not have to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; larger\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; than life. Hearing past phrases from Master Yoketron , Tucson rides t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; torrent of water as if flying through air, as wings double as fin=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; guiding him masterfully toward the root of the problem. Saberback=\r\n. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was the one hindering his progress. Once again he shifts from d=\r\nragon to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; warrior and draws his blade while still riding the wave of =\r\nwater like a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; skilled surfer, using the walls of the cavern like a su=\r\nrf board, gaining\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; altitude and ground on Saberback. Yet he makes no =\r\nattempt to strike him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; directly. With his sword Tucson guides the wat=\r\ner over the blade, in a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sideways position, guiding a torrent of wate=\r\nr in Saberbacks direction,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an attempt to throw him off lon=\r\ng enough to rescue Optimus Prime.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; A storm can find anyone, =\r\nno matter how devious they may think they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now, it&#39;s time=\r\n that a few tables were turned. LEO! SURROUND RODIMUS\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; AND DETAIN HIM=\r\n! BIG CONVOY, I NEED YOU TO SECURE NIGHTLIGHT!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MAXIMALS, PREDACONS, =\r\nOPERATION STORM, NOW!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; LEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY, =\r\nalong with the rest of the MAXIMALS quickly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; moved down the center of t=\r\nhe room as well, allowing TUSCON to take the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lead at the moment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; VICE GRIP had fallen in over behind CRYOTEK, rea=\r\ndy over to assist in a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flanking position as they came face to face o=\r\nver with MAGMATRON and what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seemed to be.. OPTIMUS PRIME.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; DINOBOT was ahead and over to flank, and while still etnirely confused =\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; OPTIMUS was still aboard the ARK, and it was supposed to be imposs=\r\nible\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clone sparks forged from the MATRIX, he held back ove=\r\nr and waited to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attack.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let the MAXIMALS weaken themselves fi=\r\nrst after all, and then charge in!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So now, the duo of PREDACO=\r\nNS watied like stooges over for the orders to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attack, ready to rush =\r\nforwards and gut anything in their path!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Meanwhile the other PRED=\r\nACONS looked at TUSCON and then at CRYOTEK and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SKY SHADOW.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nWho does that Tuscon think he is?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the FUZORS said.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nHe doesn&#39;t rule here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;No!&quot; CRYOTEK said. &quot;But I do, and I want =\r\nOptimus Prime dead! Now Move!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; With that the PREDACONS also took =\r\nto the air and ran along the ground,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; running along with TUSCON but hav=\r\ning a very different objective in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The water flowed dow=\r\nn the center of the vast chamber, finding the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; original channel it had =\r\nonce possesed. At first it was a walkl of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; water, then a break as it fi=\r\nlled out and then it was a powerful font\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of water that ran swiftly tow=\r\nards its goal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However before it reached the pillar of fire like =\r\nenergy it bisected,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; splitting into two streams and began to flow aroun=\r\nd it. It had made\n&gt; &gt;&gt; contact with a shield, a shield which for the moment=\r\n protected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MAGMATRON, SABERBACK and DARK RODIMUS as well as other SHAR=\r\nKTICONS\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that were spilling out from the cave opening near to their loc=\r\nation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS looked up at TUSCON and the others and laughe=\r\nd as he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spoke to SABERBACK and MAGMATRON. &quot;There is no reason to worry=\r\n, that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bungling idiot TUSCON, he couldn&#39;t fight his way out of a paper=\r\n bag.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; At the same time others of MAGMATRON&#39;s troops began to app=\r\near,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dinosaur like troops of all shapes and numbers. And MAGMATRON him=\r\nself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; looked as if he had grown to nearly twice his size. He was standi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nealy a full 20&#39; tall!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He laughed as well! &quot;You have come=\r\n to your doom!&quot; His voive echoed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about the vast chamber.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thi=\r\ns was not going to be easy at all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-B8B00F10-A4E1-405E-A3DC-17FED5C8AAA8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ooc: &nbsp;I&#39;m aware of t=\r\nhat. &nbsp;Tucson&#39;s waiting for Rodimus to come out of his shell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do=\r\nn&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already p=\r\nosses. &nbsp;Nothing is worth more than family and friends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;O=\r\nn Jan 31, 2012, at 2:36 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclo=\r\nnus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:non=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;OOC: =\r\nDon&#39;t forget, there is still a shield seperating Tuscon from Dark&lt;br&gt;\nRodim=\r\nus, the same shield that is blocking the water flow and still&lt;br&gt;\nprotectin=\r\ng the enemy.

Nothing is worth more than family and frie=\r\nnds.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 31, 2012, at 2:16 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - Nightlight&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The autorepair system of Nightlight was very damaged and =\r\nvarely keep her&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; alive.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RODIMUS =\r\nlooked down at NIGHTLIGHT, his optics dark and brooding and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; th=\r\nen he looked up at SABERBACK anger painted in them clearly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;If you want your little female repaired then you had better get=\r\n your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; cranial unit out of your hind quarters!&quot; MAGMATRON said =\r\nas he looked&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; at DARK RODIMUS, his optics glowing dangerously. =\r\nIt was obviouslthat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; he was full of some sort of dark power.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS stood up angrilly for a moment but the=\r\nn backed up a step,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; as if he were seeing something in MAGMATRO=\r\nN&#39;s optics that even he had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not seen before.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; SABERBACK nodded as he pointed at the approaching TUSCON and those=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that were with him. &quot;They won&#39;t reach us yet, but soon. We mu=\r\nst be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ready for the final stage.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;S=\r\ntage of what?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he looked away from MAGMATRON to&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; glance at SABERBACk and then at the severaly weakened OPTIMUS PRIME.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Him? He is no threat to us!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With =\r\na shake of his head SABERBACK looked at RODIMUS, &quot;Don&#39;t worry&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nabout that boy, just get ready to defend yourself!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To rise up to an im=\r\npossible challenge meant having to do something&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extraordi=\r\nnary. But deeds of extraordinary feats did not have to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n larger&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than life. Hearing past phrases from Master Yoket=\r\nron , Tucson rides the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; torrent of water as if flying thro=\r\nugh air, as wings double as fins,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guiding him masterfully=\r\n toward the root of the problem. Saberback. He&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was the on=\r\ne hindering his progress. Once again he shifts from dragon to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; warrior and draws his blade while still riding the wave of water like =\r\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; skilled surfer, using the walls of the cavern like a su=\r\nrf board, gaining&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; altitude and ground on Saberback. Yet h=\r\ne makes no attempt to strike him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; directly. With his sword=\r\n Tucson guides the water over the blade, in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sideways po=\r\nsition, guiding a torrent of water in Saberbacks direction,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; an attempt to throw him off long enough to rescue O=\r\nptimus Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; A storm can find anyone=\r\n, no matter how devious they may think they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Now, it&#39;s time that a few tables were turned. LEO! SURROUND RODIM=\r\nUS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; AND DETAIN HIM! BIG CONVOY, I NEED YOU TO SECURE NIGHT=\r\nLIGHT!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; MAXIMALS, PREDACONS, OPERATION STORM, NOW!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO PRIME and BIG=\r\n CONVOY, along with the rest of the MAXIMALS quickly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; moved dow=\r\nn the center of the room as well, allowing TUSCON to take the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nlead at the moment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; VICE GRIP had fallen in over behind CRYOTEK, ready =\r\nover to assist in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; flanking position as they came face t=\r\no face over with MAGMATRON and what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seemed to be.. OPTIMU=\r\nS PRIME.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DINOBOT was ahead and over to =\r\nflank, and while still etnirely confused -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OPTIMUS was st=\r\nill aboard the ARK, and it was supposed to be impossible&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nto&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clone sparks forged from the MATRIX, he held back over=\r\n and waited to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attack.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let the MAXIMALS=\r\n weaken themselves first after all, and then charge in!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So now, the duo of PREDACONS watied like stooges over for =\r\nthe orders to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attack, ready to rush forwards and gut anyt=\r\nhing in their path!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile the other PREDACONS=\r\n looked at TUSCON and then at CRYOTEK and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; SKY SHADOW.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Who does that Tuscon think he is?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the =\r\nFUZORS said.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;He doesn&#39;t rule here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;No!&quot; CRYOTEK said. &quot;But I do, and I want Optimus Prime dead! Now Move!&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With that the PREDACONS also took to the air and r=\r\nan along the ground,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; running along with TUSCON but having a ve=\r\nry different objective in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; mind.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The =\r\nwater flowed down the center of the vast chamber, finding the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\noriginal channel it had once possesed. At first it was a walkl of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; water, then a break as it filled out and then it was a powerful font&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of water that ran swiftly towards its goal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; However before it reached the pillar of fire like energy it bisected,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; splitting into two streams and began to flow around it. It ha=\r\nd made&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; contact with a shield, a shield which for the moment pr=\r\notected&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; MAGMATRON, SABERBACK and DARK RODIMUS as well as other=\r\n SHARKTICONS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that were spilling out from the cave opening near=\r\n to their location.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS looked up at TUS=\r\nCON and the others and laughed as he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; spoke to SABERBACK and MA=\r\nGMATRON. &quot;There is no reason to worry, that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; bungling idiot TUS=\r\nCON, he couldn&#39;t fight his way out of a paper bag.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; At the same time others of MAGMATRON&#39;s troops began to appear,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; dinosaur like troops of all shapes and numbers. And MAGMATRON himself&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; looked as if he had grown to nearly twice his size. He was stan=\r\nding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; nealy a full 20&#39; tall!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He laugh=\r\ned as well! &quot;You have come to your doom!&quot; His voive echoed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; abo=\r\nut the vast chamber.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This was not going to be eas=\r\ny at all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Prest=\r\non&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end gro=\r\nup email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-B8B00F10-A4E1-405E-A3DC-17FED5C8AAA8--\r\n\n"}}
