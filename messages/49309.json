So \n&gt; Megatron would be hiding and poking his weapons over to fire at the \n&gt; moment, having some protection against weaponfire. \n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially, SS couldn&#39;t have gotten behind him, grabbed his wrist \n&gt; (which would be a mode anyway), and fired a laser at the back of his \n&gt; neck etc. I guess I need to work on my posting some more then to \n&gt; make stuff like that clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is, of course, provided that Tyrael is where I had thought he \n&gt; was. If not, we have a minor problem. =p\n\n\n"}}
