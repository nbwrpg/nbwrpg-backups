Frozen with fear, he just sits there and watches as the heavy bot falls towards him. At the last moment he squeezes his eyes shut and scrunches down. Shadow Cat was racing towards the large predacon, blazing energy surrounding her. She aimed herself at the falling predacon&#39;s head. She didn&#39;t think it would work well without one. Well, it WAS a pred, mabey it could? She gathered speed and was about to put on the last burst of speed that would bring her to the bot, but she then noticed her brother, hairless and scrunched up, waiting for the bot to fall on him.*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;What an ass!&gt;(Thinking)&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;* She re-directed her course and zoomed behind the bot and grabbed Snow Tech.*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot; Uh....Snow Tech, you can open your eyes now. It&#39;s ass isn&#39;t in your face anymore.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;* Snow Tech kept his eyes shut and spoke*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&quot; Wait a minute, my life is passing before my eyes. Wow, i never relized how dorky you looked as a baby.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;* She smaked him for the comment and flew off into the bush to drop him off. And so they could think of something to mabey defet or render helpless, the Predacon.*&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=12 src=&quot;http://64.4.16.24/emsmilep.gif&quot; width=12&gt;&nbsp;Bye!
