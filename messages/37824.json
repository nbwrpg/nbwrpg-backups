She \nsearched\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through her DNA samples and decided to use Scorpion and Snake \nDNA fused\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theAlien DNA Zardus had provided. A small pool of DNA sat \nbefore her,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already beginning to grow. Much like Doctor Frankenstein she \nwas creating\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; monster and didn&#39;t even know it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
