Yet they knew they had to keep i=\r\nt together if they were to not let Rodimus down.  Quickstride looks to his =\r\nbuddy, who looks to him as well.\n\n&quot;You think&#39;n what I&#39;m thinkn&#39;, Uproar?&quot;\n\n=\r\nUproar nodds.\n\n&quot;When in doubt, resort ta the basics.  I say we just charge =\r\ninto there, like a couple of wild animals, and get ourselves caught up in t=\r\nhe fluctuation of the force shield around it, and see if we can disrupt it =\r\nlong enough ta let Rodimus and the other guys through. Of course, in beast =\r\nmode, would kill our robot modes for sure.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re ri=\r\nght, that might just be the only way ta disrupt it.  Might sting a little b=\r\nit but it&#39;s worth the pain.  But I&#39;m a lot faster on my hooves than you are=\r\n on your paws.  I vote you stay on top of my back, I charge and that way we=\r\n both distribute the disruptive energy around the field, long enough for Ro=\r\ndimus ta get through relatively unharmed.. Hopefully. I think I did it befo=\r\nre by accident once..  Oh yeah, when this snake thing came at me from nowhe=\r\nre and spooked the living spark outa me.  The shields were up for some reas=\r\non and I ran right inta them.  Maaaan did that sting, but after a few days =\r\nin the CR chamber, I was okay.&quot;\n\nUproar nodds.\n\n&quot;If it&#39;s just a few days of=\r\n CR treatment, I don&#39;t care.  Rodimus, Sir, this may be the only way we&#39;ll =\r\nbe able ta get you guys in there. And we&#39;ll gladly do it again and again if=\r\n we have to.&quot;\n\nAt the Black fortress, inside, Rat Trap quickly looks to Win=\r\ndlord with bugged out eyes.\n\n&quot;GAHHH, OKAY, IT&#39;S TIME FOR TAKEOFF!  WE GOTTA=\r\n BOGGIE!&quot;\n\nOutside the black fortress, Night Shift desperately hops up on T=\r\nucson to try and access his shifting collumn to put him into neutral so tha=\r\nt towing him will not tax anyone who is there to push or pull him out of da=\r\nnger.  Tucson has just enough energy to lower his window, and does so for h=\r\nis comrade, who is quick to try and put him into Neutral.  There was a prob=\r\nlem though.  In order to do that someone had to step down lightly on his br=\r\nake pedal.  Tucson realized it, and with all his might, slowly plunges his =\r\nbrake on his own, as Night Shift quickly puts him into neutral.\n\n&quot;Whew, tha=\r\nnks buddy.  Okay, hang in there, we&#39;re gonna get you guys outa here pronto.=\r\n&quot;\n\nTucson responds.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s important - to secure - Talon.  Must - put my wi=\r\nndow back up.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds, as he gets down in time for Tucson to ge=\r\nt the window back up.\n\n&quot;Right  Okay, guys, we need some help now!  Tucson&#39;s=\r\n got Talon secured safely and we gotta bug outa here pronto!\n\nStraight Shot=\r\n manages to dart over to Night Shift.\n\n&quot; We gotta clear out!  The fortress =\r\nis gonna blow any time now!  Tucson&#39;s way too close, he&#39;ll get obliterated =\r\nif he stays here!&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Talon is Female\n&gt; OOC:  Oops, sorry about that=\r\n.

It was only the lengt=\r\nh of time that it would take that\n&gt; was in question, and how much more emot=\r\nional responses would inhibit the\n&gt; proccess.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon was about to say=\r\n something else when a call came in from Rodimus,\n&gt; &quot;Perceptor! how long do=\r\n we have until the tower goes up?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita hid herself a=\r\nnd carefully watched her sorrounding hopping to find\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; who was clos=\r\ne to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was more shuffling in the room with Elita, =\r\nthen the sound of something\n&gt; sniffing. &quot;Elita!&quot; A whispered voice said in =\r\nthe darkness, the voice\n&gt; sounding like Lord Elder. &quot;Where are you? I know =\r\nyou&#39;re here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Outside the Ark*\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the Ark, Up=\r\nroar and Quickstride nodd in compliance. They were ready for\n&gt; the challeng=\r\ne. They transform into their robot modes as Uproar begins to\n&gt; sharpen his =\r\nclaws, while Quickstride cracks his knuckles. The young cat now\n&gt; bares an =\r\nenthusiastic look on his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; All right, I&#39;m ready ta do this si=\r\nr. No matter what happens, there&#39;s no\n&gt; turning tail.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride =\r\nalso nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s right, no turning tail. It&#39;ll be like old times=\r\n..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at all of them, his optics clear and res=\r\nolute. &quot;I don&#39;t know\n&gt; what is going on at the battle, communications have =\r\nbeen cut off, but we\n&gt; have to trust that Tuscon and the others are able to=\r\n handle themselves.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pointing to the ark Rodimus&#39; face turned grim, &quot;O=\r\nur focus is here and now.\n&gt; We don&#39;t know who or how many are in the Ark an=\r\nd who has taken her. But we\n&gt; do know that if we don&#39;t get back in, everyon=\r\ne&#39;s life is in danger, not only\n&gt; our lives and the Maximals, but also Opti=\r\nmus Prime, and the other Autobots\n&gt; that are suppose to wake up a couple of=\r\n million years from now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Be ready.&quot; He said in serious tones. &quot;When =\r\nPerceptor gives me the go ahead,\n&gt; I will activate this device and we enter=\r\n the Ark.&quot; He took a moment to look\n&gt; at each one of them, &quot;It is almost ti=\r\nme.&quot; he said with a tone of finality.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *At the battle*\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; All right. Let&#39;s - regroup, as Noctorro has=\r\n advised.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As he tries to stand up, he finds his condition too far =\r\nadvanced, as he\n&gt; falls to his knees once more, unable to get up on his own=\r\n. He finds just\n&gt; enough energy to get into vehicle mode, seeing that this =\r\nway, at least he\n&gt; could be towwed to saftey, rolling on wheels rather than=\r\n being dragged,\n&gt; which would be difficult to do otherwise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Here-=\r\n in - this mode, it will - be easier for me - to ambulate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As Tuscon attempted to transform and move away with the help of the others=\r\n,\n&gt; Noctorro stands up, rising to his full and imposing height! Not having =\r\nmany\n&gt; of the larger weapons, Noctorro does what he does best, he leapt int=\r\no the\n&gt; fray, using his large horns and immense size to batter down as many=\r\n of the\n&gt; Predacons as he can.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Torca, stands as well,=\r\n his size actually a few inches\n&gt; taller and more massive than Noctorro! &quot;S=\r\nilverbolt! Airhammer!&quot; Torca calls,\n&gt; his voice booming across the battlefi=\r\neld. &quot;Attack pattern theta 4!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that Silverbot, who looked to be a=\r\n cross between a wolf and an eagle,\n&gt; and Airhammer who looked like both sh=\r\nark and hawk move quickly through the\n&gt; air, brining their firepower out in=\r\n an attempt to disorient the Predacons!\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment it seems to have =\r\nthat sort of affect as the sweeps pull back\n&gt; and Phobia is forced to abort=\r\n her next attack run as the Fuzors make their\n&gt; presence known.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Was=\r\npinator and Terrorsaur attempt to swing around to help, Bantor fired\n&gt; seve=\r\nral shots from his weapon stepping out from the trees, surprise and his\n&gt; f=\r\nirepower for the moment holding them at bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca looked over at Tusc=\r\non and the others and then turned back to the\n&gt; battle, bringing his own Do=\r\nrsal guns into play!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the battle field Talon continu=\r\ned moving and shooting, she didnt know\n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt; long could keep her enemis=\r\n away, Kup watched her desperate situation and\n&gt; &gt; open fire against the pr=\r\nedacons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras was really mad and said By comlink &quot;Perceptor alway=\r\n has more than a\n&gt; &gt; trick in his sleeve...

Then the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon leader started to leave the area=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras gets a message from Cyclonus, &quot;I cannot stop the d=\r\nestruction.\n&gt; Perceptor has planned this too well.

And that\n&gt; &gt; was enough to =\r\nenergize him just enough to get him to roll quickly toward\n&gt; &gt; Talon, as he=\r\n opens his cab doors right beside her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Night Shift, get - Talon in=\r\nto my cab, now!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Skyshadow laughed as he watched Talon fall=\r\n, &quot;Stay down!&quot; he said menacingly\n&gt; as he oriented his weapon on her downed=\r\n form. &quot;This will only take a mome .\n&gt; . .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *&gt;&gt;BOOM!!&lt;&lt;*\n&gt; \n&gt; Skyshado=\r\nw is hit by a blast from Torca which sends him spinning into the air\n&gt; and =\r\nsliding back several meters.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;YOU!&quot; he said, hatred written clearly on=\r\n Skyshadow&#39;s face. &quot;You and your\n&gt; accursed Fuzors!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Torca just smiled=\r\n as he held his weapon on him, &quot;You heard what your boss\n&gt; said, FLEE or fa=\r\nce my wrath!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Noctorro leaped inbetween the Predacons and Ta=\r\nlon, catching\n&gt; Injector and Buzzclaw and sent them flying through the air =\r\nas well! &quot;Go!&quot; he\n&gt; said, his vcoie deep and dangerous.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without a back=\r\nwards glance they took off into the air, fleeing after their\n&gt; master, Hydr=\r\nas! The other Predacons, seeing his flight began pulling out as\n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift is quick to follow orders, as he carefully pl=\r\naces Talon\n&gt; &gt; on Tucson&#39;s front seat. Tucson shuts his doors and secures h=\r\ner gently\n&gt; &gt; so she doesn&#39;t fall when he moves. It was just enough energy =\r\nto secure\n&gt; &gt; her, as his engine slows and once again, is idol.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ta=\r\nlon - I want you to - know that it will take more than just a shot =96\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto my arm to stop me completely.
