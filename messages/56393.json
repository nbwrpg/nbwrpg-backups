But was the only one that did not burn up \ninto crispy atoms as it descended in the form of a great revolving fireball \ndown towards the flat grasslands of ancient Africa.\nThe local wildlife having the intelligence enough to run for their pitiful \nlittle lives as the alien metallic behemoth rocketed towards them.\nThose aboard hanging on for their OWN pitiful little lives.\n\n� AH! WE�RE ALL GUNNA DIE!!� Dust Storm screeched as he hung onto whatever \nhe could, Dark Cloud included as he floated virtually in zero gravity and \nfelt the temperature rising.\nHe clung for dear life to the jet plane�s leg and began to sob. � I DON�T \nWANNA DIE!!�\nSuddenly the little dune buggy opened his optics and found that he was \nfloating right beside a porthole and could see the yellow grasslands rushing \nup to meet them, and he suddenly became calm and even smiled.\n�Hey�what�s that?�\nTo him it looked kind of pretty�but then he realized what it was and all \nsenses of calm completely escaped him. � WE�RE GUNNA HIT IT!�\n\nBut by then it was too late and ship struck ground HARD.\nSkidding along the open fields like a flat stone over a tranquil pond, \nopening up the earth like a sharp scalpel before it finally lost momentum \nand came to a slow stop.\nOnly to spew fuel from its 2 massive, broken tanks down the backside of the \ncharred hull, fiery red hot enough to catch on fire.\nAlthough, by then the 4 Decepticons inside had gathered enough wits about \nthem to vacate the area immediately and escape from their possible demise. \nRunning for their lives out into the bright sunlight of prehistoric Africa \njust as the very vessel they�d piloted only minuets ago exploded into \nnothing but wasted pieces of slag.\nThey all watched from a distance as it burned.\n\n�I�m glad we weren�t in there when THAT happened.� Blue Flame commented as \nhe stood alongside his Commanding officer at the other 2. Who all seemed to \nbe quiet for a moment and contemplate the true words of the blue semi-truck.\nBecause it WAS true.\nThey�d lost their ship, but they would have lost their lives if they�d acted \na moment too late.\nBut still, Blue Flame had to sigh in disappointment. � But now what are we \ngoing to do? We lost our research and I don�t even know where we are.� He \nfinished, looking around at the foreign planet they�d managed to crash on.\nEveryone else did the same.\n\nMountains loomed up to the East and yellow African plain stretched out in \nevery other direction as far as the optic could see. Marred by the odd \nskeletal tree, but that was about it.\nDiesel Runner planted her hands onto her metallic hips and studied their \nsurroundings closely as the crackling fire of their ship burnt behind them.\n� That tare could have taken us anywhere. Because, if you all remember, our \nresearch recorded that it was a flux in space AND time. So we could be on \nany planet, in any time period. And this place is beginning to look more and \nmore familiar the longer I look at it.�\n�How so?� Blue Flame asked, the other 2 of their team also looking to the \nbroad back of their Commander. Although she continued to look out towards \nthe horizon.\n� I mean, I�ve seen pictures of this place before back at the Research \nAcademy. Or at least a place that looked like this.� She said while \ngesturing with her hand towards the landscape. � This place reminds me of \nthe pictures of ancient Earth millions of years before our Ancestors awoke \nand started the Great War. See what I mean? There�s active volcanoes over \nthere.� D.R. pointed to a plume of steady smoke rising up from a great \ndistance away. � Although 9 chances out of 10, I�m wrong since our exit \nfactor of that tare was random. This planet is still generally young, and \nthose volcanoes prove it.�\n\nSand Storm walked up to stand beside the towering black and Decepticon and \nclapped his hands together.\n� I can�t WAIT to study this place!�\nD.R., although this was no time for light-sparks, couldn�t help but feel the \nsame way. But still� �Maybe later, Sand Storm. But right now, we have to \nsalvage what equipment we can from the ship. I think all the fuel�s burned \nup now and it�s reasonably safe.� She said as she turned back and observed \nthe dying embers of what was left.\n� Though, it�s going to take a while�.�\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\n\n\n"}}
