Razorwing spotted a window he knew\nthat w=\r\nould be the entrance. Has they broke into the parliament, Remus\nand Razorwi=\r\nng landed in the center of the the circular room. The enemy\nrapidly realize=\r\nd who they we&#39;re, and soon rain of blast and missile\nwe&#39;re exploding all ov=\r\ner the place. Some wall could give cover to\nRazorwing  and Remus but it was=\r\n just a matter of time before anyone\nget them. they had to be quick.\n\nHas R=\r\nazorwing took a small clock-looking device from under his wing,\nhe started =\r\nto ignitiating it.\n\nRazorwing: This device wont destroy the building but th=\r\nis will\ndefenitly affect all the bot in the area.\n\nRemus: What?!?!Are you c=\r\nrazy? Just in case you didn&#39;t realized, WE ARE\nIN THIS AREA!!!! \n\nRazorwing=\r\n: Calm down, youre still to green, with this technology. This\nwas made to p=\r\nrevent minions attack. At max power, this toy can affect\nthe spark of any b=\r\not from a five clicks range, but rigth now it will\nbe set for the parliamen=\r\nt dimension: about an half-click. An istead of\nturning off bots, it will kn=\r\nocked them off quite some time. The core\nof the island will not be affected=\r\n either, not at this power level.\n\nRazorwing didn&#39;t tell Remus that this wa=\r\ns just theorical : this\nsituation is the first real test of this secret pro=\r\nject. He himself\nwasn&#39;t even sure of what will happen...\n\nHas Razorwing fin=\r\nished the setting of the bomb, he realised the remus\nwas shoot on the arm a=\r\nnd some blast on the chest he didn&#39;t respond to\nanything, nad the time were=\r\n already cvounting down.\n\nHas he took Remus in his back he took radion cont=\r\nact with Deadfur \n\nRazorwing : All Rigth Deadfur prepare yoursefl to attack=\r\n i&#39;m getting out. \n\nWhile he was flying out with Remus, he capted an encryp=\r\nted message,\nbut time wasn&#39;t to this. The electromagnetic shock cause by th=\r\ne\nexplosion was weak when Razorwing was hit by it. He landed slowly on\nthe =\r\nfloor next to Deadfur. He kne the effect wouldn&#39;t last long due to\nthe smal=\r\nl force in the bomb but he was force to turn into best mode\nand offline for=\r\n a short time. Remus wasn&#39;t still inoperational.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;xochitla2006&quot; &lt;xochitla2006@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Peceptor left relay while he smirked.
