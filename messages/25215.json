She blinks them to get herself used to the light once again. She \ngroans again and sits up. That blast knocked her to the ground, which \nknocked her out.  She looks around, rubbing her head. She spies Hurricane \nasking Snow Tech to fight, hand to hand. He (hurricane) looked like he had \nbeen blasted by some sort of explosive, and cold ones at that. She smiled, \nSnow Tech was very defensive about his family.  Just then, a crackling came \nfrom her and Snow Tech&#39;s com-link. Iron Raptor wanted the to seize fire and \nto go to her. She sighed, she hoped Snow Tech heard..*\n\n* Snow Tech saw Hurricane throw down his weapon and heard his request. He \nsmiled, his auto guns folding back into their original positions. He \nadvanced in a fighting stance and growled.  He really didn&#39;t like it when \nsomeone hurt his siblings, but to shoot a bot when he or she was unarmed was \ndishonourable, so he would instead pummel his foe into oblivion!*\n* He flexed his claws and advanced slowly, ready for anything to come, but \nIrons voice cut like a knife through his concentration. She wanted him to \nretreat when this..this...creepy looking dude hurt his sister! Not a chance, \nhe would fight till the other bot gave in, or he himself could no longer \nfight!*\n\n*Shadow Cat saw that Snow Tech was not going to back off, like Iron Ordered, \nbut was going to fight. She groaned, this was not her day either. then it \ndawned on her. Snow Tech probally didn&#39;t know that she was O.k. She smiled, \nmabey there was a way to make him listen... Shge shouted out to him..*\n\n&quot; Snow Tech, back off! i&#39;m alright, we have to go, IR&#39;s calling all of us to \na seize fire! So that means STOP!!!&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech did stop, he turned and smiled at her with his most doofus grin \nhe could manage, and turned back to Hurricane and spoke.*\n\n&quot; Yeah, i guess we gotta go, We&#39;ll finish this later. MAY THE WINDS OF FATE \nSMACK YOUR SQUARE ASS!&quot;\n\n*And with a goofy laugh, he and Shadow Cat departed from the battle feild to \nsearch for Iron Raptor.*\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;SOULSTICE&quot; &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Snow Techs gas attack!\n&gt;Date: Tue, 9 Jan 2001 20:01:59 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt;Shokaract: Ah, yes, Jetstorm.\n&gt;\n&gt;Shokaract unloaded rapid fire gattling shots at the Cybertronian Fire...\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Alloran2@...\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 09, 2001 7:45 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Snow Techs gas attack!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   :::Hurricane/Jetstorm:::\n&gt;\n&gt;   ::Hurricane gets hit by a few ice rockets, but dodges the rest.
