He waved his fingers over \nthe Maximal icon he kept from his protoform and it changed to \nPredicon. He sent another message:\n\nMy name is Shadow Star. I am likely the only hope you have of winning \nwhatever war might be raging on this poor excuse for a plnet.\n\nHe could tell the evil was comming from a few bots. He hoped that \nmeant they were a small faction who would rip their own sparks out \nand lay them at the feet of the Inferno for more power.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; He transformed into bot mode and approached the base(I&#39;m guessing \n&gt; blackfortress is the one in Europe).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He arrived and flew down. He could feel evil in the air. He knew \n&gt; &gt; inside he would find bots ready to give their sparks to the \nInferno \n&gt; &gt; in a cycle. He sent out a message:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My name is Shadow Star. I wish to join you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He continues flying on. Bathing in the feel of evil. In a few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megacycles he would arrive, and find sparks ready for the \ntaking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry lunch ended and I had to go to class. No one ever told \nme \n&gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; char can get in the Pack. I mentioned he could sense evil \n&gt; &gt; (probably \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some vague mind reading that would get you about as much info \nas \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bios) so I&#39;ll say he&#39;s headed for the Pred base in Europe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I talked with both Hugar and Nemisis, Hugar doesn&#39;t \nsee a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem and says Nemesis can take it up with the council.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Forget Omega, I just realized how many goodie \ngoodies I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to make to bad apples. This is the first one. \nIt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question of: What did they do with the second blank \n&gt; after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Primal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all this time the blank protoform still sits there \n&gt; &gt; where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals have left it.  Finally, something clicks and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scanners \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; online. It takes a lizard beast mode. Then from deep in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; pit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force, the Inferno himself arises to claim the body. A \nnew \n&gt; &gt; spark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in it, Pure Black. Then the Maximal chip starts to work. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Inferno overrides it, but not totally. The spark \nturns \n&gt; &gt; blood \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; red. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A new bot arises. He is engulfed in flame. He turns into \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fairly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handsome, red eyed, muscular bot, of pure evil. He can \nsense \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with black hearts on this planet. Soon he will have \nservents \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his every wim.  He walks a few feet and stops.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bot: SHADOW STAR, BLACK DRAGON MODE!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His size increases from 10 ft. to 20 ft. as he turns into \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dragon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (o.k. I confesse I&#39;m sorta coping Cyberwolf). He flys \ntoward \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dark \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: We need to get a few things worked out for this one. \n&gt; For \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starters \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even if he gets servants I don&#39;t want the chars. Next, if \n&gt; &gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chars \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agree to serve him will he be allowed to alter their \nbeast \n&gt; &gt; modes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with himself (if you say yes their owners could decide \nhow \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; naturally they&#39;d change back if they broke up with him), \nand \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assume more servants means he&#39;s more powerful, and by the \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a spot open in the Pack it&#39;s hard enough to form one \nFaction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just try to take over the Pack one by one, oh and I don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kitkat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or Drillbit would like him becaus he has a girl problem \n(as \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rapist) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but might take the guise of controllability.\n\n\n"}}
