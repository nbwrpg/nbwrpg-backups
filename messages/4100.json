She \nlooks around for the object that was glittering earlier.  She frowns as she \ndiscovers what was glittering was a large water spring bubbling up.\n\n&quot;BLAST!&quot;\nShe was disapointed in herself.  She thought she had found something.  She \nplodded long near the spring.\n&quot;Of alll the rotton luck.&quot;\nShe just keep looking about for something, but nothing turned up.\nShe was about to give up.  All she saw was rock with lots of weeds and \nfloliage growing on it.\n&quot;Megatron will slag me for letting him down.&quot;\nShe leaned up against the rock face.  It gave way and she fell backward into \na hugh cave. &quot;WHOAH!&quot;  She landed on her backside with a thud.\n&quot;Holy Cybertron.&quot;\nThe cave was huge.  It was at least 300 feet tot he ceiling and had a huge \nhole in the top that let in light.  She wakled back intot he cave and found \nmany natural chambers in it.\n&quot;YAHOO!  I DID IT!&quot;\nShe turned on her commlink. &quot;Megaton, Mission accomplished.  Returning back \nto base.&quot;\nShe ran out of the cave, stood infrontof it to mark the quardinates and ran \nback as fast as she could to let Megatron know what she had found.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
