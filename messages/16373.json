He \nknew that Veratis controled him as long as Shadow Wing was in his \ngrasp, what was wrong with him, he knew that the shoot first method \nwas still the best course of action but he couldn&#39;t. One problem was \nthat Veratis had neglected to give him any guns. Oh well as long as \nShadow Wing would live he could sleep at night.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
