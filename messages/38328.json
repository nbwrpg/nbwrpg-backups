He looked to the \nContructicons. &quot;Scrapper, what do you have on this ship. I want those \nAutobots out of the air immediatly&quot;  Havotron began to feel his power \nof command. Yes he liked it.  He looked to his best man Spinister \ncalmly at the window. Then to the cowering Needlenos hanging on to \nthe wall beside Spinister. &quot;Spinister, get the crew into thier ranks \nand prepare for emergency battle. Needlenose, you...jsut follow him&quot;  \nHavotron turned once again looking to the screen in front of him.  &#39;I \nknow what this is&#39; he htought to himself. &#39;It is the Pit itself, and \nthe Autobots will finally melt in it.&#39;\n\nScrapper acknowledged Havotron to scared to say \nanything.  &quot;Constucticons&quot; he muttered out &quot;Get to you stations and \nwiat to fire.&quot;  He walked to a planning board.\n\nOn the Hidden One:\nJetV ran out of hte control room looking back only once to his \ncommander sitting there weakly.  He then ran to the storage area \nquickly. He wasn&#39;t sure but he could swear he heard a pounding on \nsound. &quot;Must be the fate outside that teases me with sounds&quot; he said \nto himself.\n\nCrotale continued to pound on the door.  Small dents began to show \nthrough the metal. Someone must notice them soon.  \n\nSlag looked to the pityful Autobots all cowering except the \nDinobots. &quot;Pathetic two strokes.  Grimlock show courage, and so do \nrest of Dinobots.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; D.E.D::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; The Constructicon ship begins to slowly enter the shifting space. \nOn the\n&gt; inside the lights begin to dim. In the repair bay as Nightmare lays \nHook\n&gt; down, the lights go out, his red shimmering smoke lighting up a \nsmall\n&gt; area. Scrapper begins to panik, &quot;Lord Unitron, we are being drawn \ninto a\n&gt; dangerous predicament, I suggest we pull out, and call it quits.&quot;\n&gt; Scrapper sputtered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron&#39;s eyes flared. It must be an Autobot trick. &quot;NO, we follow\n&gt; them. I want to know what they&#39;re after.&quot; Just then though, the ship\n&gt; began to sputter, as it was gaining speed being sucked in. \nSlugslinger\n&gt; and Apeface&#39;s eyes were begining to cloud over, as they were losing\n&gt; balance. Havotron looked around at the other Decepticons. &quot;Wimps, \nstand\n&gt; up.&quot; He shouted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scrapper got out of his seat. &quot;My lord, we could be ripped to \nshreds if\n&gt; we continue.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; At those words Havotron leveled his cannon at Scrapper. &quot;Get back to\n&gt; your seat.&quot; he said quietly to dot the exclamation on his point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spinister could only look on through the window. He had never seen\n&gt; anything like it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hidden One::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; He had never seen anything like it. It was so beautiful, Lightspeed\n&gt; could not take his eyes away from it. Strafe began to feel light \nheaded,\n&gt; and leaned on Afterburner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hoist looked at Pacifix, &quot;Are you all right commander?&quot; He asked\n&gt; worriedly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock looked over and noticed Pacifix. Something was going \nwrong, he\n&gt; could see some of the other Autobots get clumsy. Why wasn&#39;t Pacifix\n&gt; telling them anything. He stood up, and headed towards the back.\n\n\n"}}
