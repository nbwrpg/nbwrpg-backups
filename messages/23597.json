RPGs that allow moding make me want to kill something,\n&gt; yesss... Better get used to no moding again, Teltoli. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; And about the title: no, I&#39;m not insane, but getting there.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Starlight/Fenox/Griplash/Recklessa/Repressor/Perndabot/Rex/Kl\n&gt; uster::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks down at his wrist comp, recieving Dark Angel&#39;s\n&gt; transmission. He frowns, activating his comm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Starlight, Fenox, Griplash, Recklessa, Demolition, forget about\n&gt; whatever you were looking for.&quot; Zardus orders them over the\n&gt; comm, &quot;Report to Dark Angel&#39;s position, he needs backup against\n&gt; Maximal troops.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then opens his comm to Deemos. &quot;Deemos, some Alliance troops need\n&gt; backup at the newly arrived pod. Can you send some of your troops?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks at his wrist comp, noting that Repressor and Najah were\n&gt; in the training rooms. Gotron was talking to Lady Hawk, but thatw as\n&gt; ok. He could keep an eye on her. But there was always a later time\n&gt; for training, battle was urgent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Repressor, Najah, report to Dark Angel&#39;s position. Attack any\n&gt; Maximal troops there,&quot; he says into his comm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fenox and groop recieve Zardus&#39; transmission, turning to head toward\n&gt; the battle. They wern&#39;t very far away as it is, they could even see\n&gt; the battle on their scopes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Recklessa arrives first, yelling a battle cry as she swoops down\n&gt; toward the battle, firing two missiles at Windlord and a few optic\n&gt; shots at Aerotaur. Fenox and Starlight arrive behind her. Fenox opens\n&gt; fire with an automatic rifle at Angel Prime and Starlight fires\n&gt; stinger missiles along with a tranqualizer gun at Teltoli. Griplash\n&gt; gets there last, throwing down a charge (set to detonate on impact)\n&gt; at Teltoli&#39;s pod.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That femm is Alliance property!&quot; Fenox yells while firing. A shot\n&gt; barely misses Fenox&#39;s head as Rex flies in, firing.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, she&#39;s a Maximal,&quot; he replies, dodging a shot from Recklessa.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot looks ahead, seeing a battle and recognizing some of the\n&gt; energy signatures as Alliance. Finally!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s a battle up ahead, let&#39;s go!&quot; He says to BrightBlade (Moon\n&gt; Mist, I know you&#39;re reading this, so you better reply). He takes off\n&gt; at a run toward the battle, a missile launcher flipping into his hand.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor sighs as he recieves Zardus&#39; message, his hand jerking away\n&gt; when Najah bites him. &quot;We&#39;re needed at battle,&quot; he says to the bot he\n&gt; had been training with as he wriggles out of Najah&#39;s grasp, &quot;Let&#39;s\n&gt; go!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He runs out of the training room, heading for the exit of the Iron\n&gt; Fist.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster looks at Whistler and nods. &quot;Go ahead and help them out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Eek, sorry bout the mode, I&#39;m in the middle of another RPG\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;re allowed to do that, just not fully.. sorry again! Oh, you\n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; in the air?

She flaps the\n&gt; &gt; wings on her back, preparing to fly up, but Aerotaur succeeds in\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; flying leap, and knocks her to the side.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She hisses when they both land in the dust, opposite of Windlord,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Aerotaur is lying on top of her chest. He quickly rolls off and she\n&gt; &gt; jumps up, ready to attack again when she feels two hands grip her\n&gt; &gt; shoulders and keep her back. Aerotaur again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Bot sighs and slumps her shoulders, but obeys the unspoken\n&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; to keep back, she knows she should stay back anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come on Windlord, kick his tush!&quot; She grins.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
