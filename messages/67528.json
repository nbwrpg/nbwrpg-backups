Airly did I misinterpret what your characters were\ndoing? I just want to close up any loose ends, and make sure any and\nall got back to whatever positions they are suppose to be in. Minion\nactivity should be moving to the moon, unless some choose to go\nelsewhere. \n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion) \n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
