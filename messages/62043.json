He would have tried to fly out, but all his flying abilities\nallowed him to do is go up, which was pointing down in this case.\n\nOpening up a communication line, he soon found that this sand was\nblocking radio transmissions.  There must have been some sort of metal\nin this sand.  So left with his final option, he was going to use his\narms and legs to slowly dig himself out of the sand.  He was unable to\ntell how deep he was in the sand, but when he tried to move it\nhelped..... a little.  So he began to squirm in a way that he filled\nin the space below him, and dug out the space above him.\n\nUpon calculating the preasure on his armor, Celeron determined it\nwould take him at least 5 hours to get out to the surface. \nFortunately he had recharged before he has gotten here, but he had no\nmemory of when or why he was here.\n\nSo, Celeron put on some good music and kept digging.\n\n(To Be Continued)\n\nOOC:  I haven&#39;t posted for like 6 months.  I was posting under the\nemail address rm2kmidi.  Sorry if that&#39;s confusing.   Ummm..... yeah, \ngood to be back!\n\n"}}
