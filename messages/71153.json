Realizing the danger, Night Shift poin=\r\nts to the lava flow.\n\n&quot; This isn&#39;t good, the prints in the ground, definite=\r\nly Unicronian.  That means Cheetor&#39;s nowhere around here now, he was, got d=\r\namaged, but someone picked &#39;em up.  But now, we don&#39;t have time ta hang aro=\r\nund, because once that lava flow hits us, we&#39;re gone.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Y=\r\neah, best that we get outa here, and report what we found so far?&quot;\n\nNight S=\r\nhift nodds.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll do that, but we&#39;re not givn&#39; up on Cheetor just yet.  W=\r\ne know the signatures are Unicronian, so I think I&#39;m gonna try&#39;n keep monit=\r\noring that while we&#39;re on the move.  First things first though, we gotta bu=\r\nrn rubber and get back ta safer ground.&quot;\n\nRat Trap realized that Night Shif=\r\nt was talking vehicle.\n\n&quot;Wait, you turn ta your wheels now and if you blow =\r\na tire we&#39;re done for anyway.&quot;\n\nNight Shift sighs and transforms.\n\n&quot;Yeah we=\r\nll, can&#39;t be avoided.  C&#39;mon, we&#39;re outa here.  Fastest way ta safe ground.=\r\n&quot;\n\nRat Trap gets in and buckles himself in the driver&#39;s seat.\n\n&quot;I sure hope=\r\n you got good tires buddy.&quot;\n\nNight Shift replies.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good, tranny&#39;=\r\ns workn&#39; suspension&#39;s up ta snuff, we&#39;re as good as outa here.  No worries,=\r\n I got four wheel drive, we&#39;ll make it outa here.&quot;\n\nHe starts to roll in th=\r\ne opposite direction, hoping to get himself and Rat Trap to saftey while st=\r\nill tracking the Unicronian signature, hoping to find its origin.\n\n--- In n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift stops, the heat was getting to him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, w=\r\ne&#39;re definitely in the right direction. But this heat, I don&#39;t\n&gt; got that m=\r\nuch immunity toward extreme temperatures.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Neither do I. But we gotta continue, Cheetor&#39;s gotta be out there\n&gt; somewh=\r\nere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure he is. Hot as it is, we&#39;=\r\nll find &#39;em, I promise. We&#39;re not gonna\n&gt; give up. I only wish there was a =\r\nway around the thermal vents of this\n&gt; volcano..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap sniffs t=\r\nhe air.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;P.U! That&#39;s worse than what comes outa Quickstride&#39;s aft!&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Night Shift looks up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sulfur. Ohh yeah that stinks. C&#39;mon=\r\n, let&#39;s go. Stay close.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They continue their trek toward where the =\r\nBlack Fortress used to stand.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The remaining part of the tri=\r\np continues to get hotter and hotter as they\n&gt; approach the area where the =\r\ntower stood. Nightshift and Rat Trap&#39;s internal\n&gt; gyros and compasses tell =\r\nthem that they have found the spot where Cheetor\n&gt; had stood.\n&gt; \n&gt; This are=\r\na is still untouched by the lava itself. However it is still\n&gt; spreading ou=\r\nt across the landscape of this area and will soon envelope even\n&gt; this area=\r\n soon. It would seem that the volcano beneath the tower that\n&gt; Hydras&#39; base=\r\n stood upon is quite active once set into motion.\n&gt; \n&gt; From what the duo co=\r\nuld make out there was some sort of firefight, the\n&gt; scorched and burned re=\r\nsidue of laser fire were clearly evident in the\n&gt; surrounding soils and roc=\r\nks. Cheetor took off at a run away from the area,\n&gt; this evident by the wid=\r\nely spaced foot prints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the marks, it was plain to see that =\r\nCheetor, using his speed and\n&gt; agility had managed to avoid his attackers f=\r\nor quite some time. But then\n&gt; Nightshift spots a bit of mech fluid on the =\r\nground. Cheetor had been hit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tracks lead to another secluded spot=\r\n where Cheetor put up a fight,\n&gt; judging by the burns and scorches along th=\r\ne ground. But then there is the\n&gt; imprint of Cheetor&#39;s body on the ground. =\r\nFrom the looks of things it say\n&gt; there for quite some time, judging by the=\r\n depth of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strangely enough there are other prints on the ground, s=\r\nharps clawed feet\n&gt; that seemed to appear from no where. There is no path o=\r\nf them coming up to\n&gt; the site where Cheetor lay, nor of them leaving. But =\r\nfrom the evidence the\n&gt; large reptile picked up Cheetor and most likely fle=\r\nw off with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; A complete scan of the area reveals something interest=\r\ning, the slight\n&gt; signature of something that was unicronian in origin. Wha=\r\nt ever it was that\n&gt; carried away Cheetor, it may not have been Decepticon =\r\nor Predacon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ground rumbled as lava continued to flow. The place w=\r\nhere they were\n&gt; standing would not be stable for much longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
