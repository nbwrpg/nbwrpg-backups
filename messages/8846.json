Quckstrike and Stringtra were \nthere.  Rowdy and I found Stringtra being held out of a pond in the \ncave, by a strange, long and skinny tentical like arm.  It let her go \nand we started snooping around.  Terrorsaur and Drillbit dug and \nfound a chamber inside the cave.  A strange wolf like bot was \nstanding there.&quot; She looked at the CR chamber. Maybe that&#39;s what it \nis. You see, the creature had Quickstrike held down by wires, cords \nand such.  But I have no idea what happened to him before we got \nthere.&quot;  She whimpered, &quot;I just hope he turns out OK.&quot; She layed down \non the floor and licked her paw.  She would wait to use the CR after \nQuickstrike was out.\n\n\n"}}
