One that \nhad gotten the reaction that she had hoped.\nThe acidic saliva which coated the inside of her mouth began to ooze down \nonto the top of Prowls hand, coating it with the gewy liquid.\n\nBut then she felt his hand begin to slowly move back over her tongue, \nthinking and wondering what to do next.\nThe bot side of her wanted to simply let him go, but the beast modes wanted \nto rip his arm clear off his shoulder.\nSo, again, the beast modes would dominate!\n\nShe suddenly snapped her jaws tighter down on Prowl&#39;s hand, right to the \npoint that her teeth should go right through his armor and straight to the \nother side.\nWith swift movements she snapped her head to the side and suddenly raised to \nher hind legs, slamming both her clawed hands up against his shoulders to \nbrace herself.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
