Her head snapped towards the motion, \njust seeing the back end of Switchblade but it was too late then.\nThough a sudden sharp pain caught IR in the side as the blade of the sword \nsank in deep to her side, acidic mech-fluid spurting out from either side of \nthe blade and right towards FireBlade.\nPain exploded in her mind as bright lights before she brought herself to \nreach and grab the sword, reefing it out of her side and throwing it away ( \nthat is, if FB isn&#39;t hanging onto the handle, then she just pulled it out. \n:)\nIron Raptor hissed and bared her teeth down on FireBlade, rearing up on her \nhind legs and slamming her hands down at him, trying to pin him to the \nground.\nThough before he could stick the bomb into her tail, the end of it opened up \nto create two blades, like scissors, and positioned itself above his head.\nThough that wasn&#39;t the end of the bomb.\nSince it must have been set to blow quickly, it exploded and a ball of fire \nrushed up, creating a blinding cloud of smoak.\nAnd just then, the end of the tail whipped down, ready to snap shut on \ncontact.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
