His blade meets Grimlock&#39;s blade as he\n&gt;&gt; angles the Katana to catch the oncoming sword with the sharp side of his\n&gt;&gt; own weapon. Yet the move was only to defend himself not swing out towards\n&gt;&gt; them.  The Dinobots may be relentless but if there is a land and\n&gt;&gt; defenseless creatures being tormented by intruders, the Silver Dragon will\n&gt;&gt; not rest until the tormentors are brought to justice!   True to his\n&gt;&gt; nature, Tucson gives it his all to defend his turf.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; You leave me no choice but to fight back!   AND FIGHT I WILL!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC - Just commenting, Sandy, this is reading a bit like overkill to me.\n&gt; Tuscon has been under four rounds of attack from all five Dinobots, and has\n&gt; not taken a single hit.  He&#39;s dodged, blocked, or evaded more than fifteen\n&gt; to twenty attacks in the combat posts you&#39;ve had back and forth, which even\n&gt; for a skilled warrior would be near impossible to do.  Even Megatron was\n&gt; stalemated in direct combat wtih Grimlock, and up against all five Dinobots\n&gt; Optimus Prime nearly died.  And Tuscon here is handling them all\n&gt; effortlessly, as you&#39;ve put into your postgs not even trying to fight back.\n&gt; I&#39;m not speaking as a mod, but this is getting a bit silly as to how he&#39;s\n&gt; able to endlessly avoid every single attack they toss his way, and they&#39;re\n&gt; one of the most potent teams the Autobots had as far as fighting well and\n&gt; together went.\n\nOOC: Well actually 4, but the point is made. Tuscon blocked only one\nblade - Grimlock&#39;s in this post and the one before. At that point\nSlag&#39;s should have hit Tuscon in the back and the two on the side\nshould be strikeing. There was no acknowledgement on this post or the\nlast. No one is that fast or good.\n\nThe battle is becoming pointless.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
