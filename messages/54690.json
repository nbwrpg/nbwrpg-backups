He was heading to Earth \n=\r\n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visit some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find w=\r\nhen he got there, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided he would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable =\r\nvehicle mode. He found one in the ships \n&gt; &gt; &gt; databanks. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cybe=\r\nrtronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n truck, every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information int=\r\no \nhimself. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got up from his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chair, built for the ol=\r\nd Autobots and Decpticons, and went \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare. As he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nincorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people o=\r\nn this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             He=\r\n touched his chest, the change to actual bot \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hurt his combine=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             In the deep Prime voice that had once declared \n&gt;=\r\n to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron that &quot;one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he bo=\r\nomed, &quot;Magnus would dare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; betray me like that?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t =\r\neven sit down as he entered the atmosphere, the \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shook. He wa=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had planted on \n&gt; t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s thr=\r\nusters exploded, but the rest of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inst=\r\nead, it careened out of control and slammed into the \n&gt; &gt; ground, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nrowing Prime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his =\r\nship \n&gt; stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got u=\r\np he checked himself \n&gt; over. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, j=\r\nust his good looks were damaged. He walked back \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to lo=\r\nok. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see t=\r\nhe protoform \n&gt; &gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and=\r\n looked. His faceplate was smashed and \n&gt; dented, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the \nshoulder \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint=\r\ns on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sort of \n&gt; &gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a =\r\nbit ripped up too, but \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communications boxes on \n&gt; =\r\nthese \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible.
