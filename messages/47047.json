Only a female \nbot.. Her ears flew back, only hoping this bot would be as kind as Azure had \nbeen up till now. Even if it seemed doubtful...there was a war going on right \nnow. If this bot attacked, what would Mistra be able to do? She&#39;d have to go \noffline for a brief period to change her activation code from whatever it \nwas...she knew that much.
