Dinner...and \ndesert.\n&gt; \n&gt; Desmonus nodds at BloodyStrikes introduction with an evil glint in \nher \n&gt; optics, her stomach growling just as the smell of his mech-fluid \nrunning \n&gt; through his veins.\n&gt; She knew that he had some sort of thing for her, even if it was \njust because \n&gt; of her looks. But that was nothing more then she could have hoped \nfor, two \n&gt; gullable males who would believe anything that cam out of her \nmouth...and \n&gt; maybe all she had to do was maintain a food source was keep them \npleased.\n&gt; A small price to pay for a full stomach.\n&gt; \n&gt; She was just about to reach out and shake BloodyStrikes hand when \nReptilica \n&gt; swatted his away and replaced it with his own.\n&gt; But then she simply leaned back and crossed her arms for a moment, \nwatching \n&gt; both of the bots fight over something or a nother...most likely \nher. Which \n&gt; would serve her purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Desmonus simply sighed and then stepped forward, taking hold of \neach of \n&gt; their arms and then stepping in between them. Her voice more \nlighthearted \n&gt; then she felt.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Gentlemen, please.... You two both seem like you know this base \nfrom bolt \n&gt; to plating, and of course I&#39;m new here so I don&#39;t really know my \nway around. \n&gt; Perhaps...a tour is in order?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
