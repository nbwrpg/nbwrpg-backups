I really could use your help now, Sir.  Unicron&#39;s influence is returning and has poisoned this planet.  Now with that happening and the presence of the Decepticons and Predacons, our own forces, Autobot and Maximal are drastically out numbered.

Yes, please do that. Lord Elder if you could, allow Straightshot access to Teletran One, and see if she can acquire an Autobot frequency. Legacy, I would like you to monitor that rip in the time space continuum and see if you can get an idea as to who may have caused it. Remember, the more intel we have the better off we are.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He turns to Optimal Rodimus Prime.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are able to fly, we should scope the parameters according to what Legacy comes up with.
