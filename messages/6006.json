He then opened a comm to \nthe Iron Fist.\n    &quot;I will tell you one more time to surrender the ship, or I will destroy \nit.&quot; Magmatron said. &quot;Mantella, go back to base and tell Bobertron to press \nthe little red button in the locked glass case of my command chair. And after \nthat get some rest, you might be needing it.&quot;\n    Magmatron was prepared for the Nemisis herself. So he was hoping that if \nthis ship was going to attack his base it would have similar armaments as the \nNemisis.\n\n(I need you guys to reply, I don&#39;t care how, just reply. Even shoot me if you \nhave to just give me something to work with.)\n\n"}}
