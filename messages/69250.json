The shell p=\r\nrogramming that held\ntheir loyalty to Unicron was disintegrating, but the b=\r\nreak down was\nnot pretty. \n\nInside them Shell program raged as slowly lost =\r\nits hold it had on\nthem. Slowly though things began to settle as Cyclonus a=\r\nnd Scourge\nbegan to assert their own will, for perhaps the first time in de=\r\ncades,\nif not their lives. \n\n&quot;FOOLISH!&quot; The voice of Unicron echoed inside =\r\nCyclonus and Scourge&#39;s\nhead. &quot;You have escaped me for only a moment! You wi=\r\nll never fail to\nelude me completely!&quot;\n\n&quot;I am NO ONE&#39;S LACKY!&quot; Cyclonus&#39; vo=\r\nice spoke, firm as steel! \n\n&quot;Ahhh, Cyclonus. That is where you are wrong.&quot; =\r\nUnicron&#39;s voice spoke\nsoftly, &quot;You have the greatest potential of all my cr=\r\neations, perhaps\neven more then Galvatron or Vorpal, but you will always ha=\r\nve this\nfinal flaw, it is as the core of your very being, inextricably part=\r\n of\nyour construction: You need to follow!&quot;\n\n&quot;NO!&quot; Cyclonus barked, his voi=\r\nce suddenly horse. \n\n&quot;Yes!&quot; Unicron&#39;s voice cackled gleefully. &quot;I will see =\r\nyou again. And\nyou will fall under MY WILL ONCE MORE!&quot;\n\nCyclonus just shook=\r\n his head back and forth as he shut his eyes.\nScourge glared at Unicron bef=\r\nore his world also went dark. \n\n****************************************\n\nB=\r\nack in the real world, in the recharge pods Cyclonus and Scourge&#39;s\noptics f=\r\nlickered and returned to life! \n\nWith explosive power both pods burst apart=\r\n as Cyclonus and Scourge\nstep out and looked around. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Cyclon=\r\nus rasped as he\nlooked around. \n\n&quot;I smell Predacons.&quot; Scourge said as he to=\r\no glanced around, his weapon\ndrawn and ready. &quot;They never smelled quite rig=\r\nht! Decepticons had a\nbetter feel to them.&quot;\n\nCyclonus nods, &quot;Come, let us s=\r\nee who dares hold us! Yes, they have\nmuch to explain!&quot;\n\nCyclonus looked ove=\r\nr at the main door to the room they were in. With a\nsimple gesture and just=\r\n a touch of power it exploded off its hinges,\nflying against the far wall. =\r\n\n\nWith a slight nod Cyclonus stepped out of the room and began to walk,\nSco=\r\nurge following behind him like a shadow!\n\n*********************************=\r\n*\n\nAs Cyclonus stepped out of the room, and the smoke began to settle,\nanot=\r\nher chamber occupant came to life for a moment: Dark Rodimus. For\na moment =\r\nhis optics brightened as he watched the carnage. A smile\nwhispered across h=\r\nis face and then faded as he dropped back into\nblissful sleep and his syste=\r\nms continued to repair themselves. \n\n\n\n"}}
