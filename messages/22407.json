For the longest time, the predacons \nhave been fighting amonst themselves and not getting together. Now \nthat I have started to form a council made up of the predacon groups, \nwe are finally getting things to that we can try to get then to see \neach other as enimies, not allies. But I need someone to go into the \nMaximal camp, and get the ball rolling as it were.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Killfest::\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest nods. &quot;I see.
