Must be the n....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Before the transformer can finish his sentence he is crushed &lt;BR&gt;as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black and silver Earth semi-truck drives over him. Soon &lt;BR&gt;after, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black and yellow Earth jet fires it&#39;s weapons,\n clearing the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; area, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before landing next to the truck. The attacking vehicals &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; transform &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their robot modes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Diesel: So much for the recon mission, eh, Razor?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Razor: Yeah, but it was more fun to blow them too bits, &lt;BR&gt;Diesel.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A clicking of weapons being primed, attracts Razor and &lt;BR&gt;Diesel&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attention again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Random Tripred Flyer #3: Not all of us...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Razor draws his plasma rifle from subspace as Diesel ignites &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; laser rod sword.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Razor: Diesel, old buddy, I think you may want to contact the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rest &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n nWo...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I just thought that showing the nWo doing what I had &lt;BR&gt;them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; leave &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Earth for, fighting the Tripredacus, would be cool. I&#39;m not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reclaiming those chars or restarting the nWo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
