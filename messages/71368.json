She still was lying in the bed waitting that the scanner finished.\n&gt; Elita jumped to a side and waited that the check ends\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s one of the dorctor that attended you while you were sleeping, mom&quot;\n&gt; said ELita\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It seemed that passed years since I saw maximals or Autobots&quot; whispered\n&gt; Nightlight and looking at Bump she said &quot;I feel much better now that we\n&gt; leave the BLackFortress.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita waved happyly her tiny tail\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBUMP looked down at ELITA and NIGHTLIGHT, mother and daughter as they\nwere on the medbed. He gave a slight smile, clearly he is\nuncomfortable dealing with people on an individual level.\n\n&quot;Your life signs are much improved.&quot; He said as he turned to look at\nthe readouts. &quot;You should soon be able to get out of bed.&quot;\n\nLooking back at NIGHTLIGHT after one last glance at the sensor\ndisplays he tried to smaile brighter, but it came out looking a little\nforced. &quot;At the moment you still don&#39;t have any beast mode set up. Did\nyou want us to get you set up for the proceedure to reset you?&quot;\n\nEven as BUMP was talking to NIGHTLIGHT the doors to the medbay slid\nopen and in came NIGHTSHIFT aided by RAMULUS on one side and AIRHAMMER\non the other.\n\n&quot;You need to get to him pretty quick doc.&quot; RAMULUS said, &quot;I think he\nsaid his med are wearing off.&quot;\n\nBUMP nodded as he walked towards NIGHTSHIFT, scanner in hand. &quot;Main\ndrive shaft has been cracked.&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Coolant and oil\nleakage, electrical . . . &quot;\n\nHe looked back up at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;We should have you repaired in short\norder, but you may need a little bed rest.&quot; BUMP pulled out some sort\nof fluid disperssal unit. &quot;This should help you with the pain until we\nget you under sedation.&quot;\n\nHe held it up to NIGHTSHIFT&#39;s shoulder and activated it. &quot;Yes, the\npain should be fading even as we speak.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
