The ground shook as the \npod crashed into the side of a mountain.  The pod was embedded into \nthe ground by a few yards.  Steam and smoke rose around the pod as \nthe surface cooled from it&#39;s entry into the earth&#39;s atmsphere.  Soon \nthe pod door opened.  A large, dark figure could be seen through the \nrising smoke.  The bot strode forth.  It was a large chrome figure \nwith large dragon like wings stretching from his shoulders.  He \nscanned the area.  A forest in a temperal climate. He looked to his \nleft to see a large stag elk eyeing him.  He smiled at the animal \nand looked away.  A second later, he drew his sideblaster and shot \nthe animal dead.  The elk lay on the ground with a large smoldering \nhole in the center mass of the animal.  DeathSteel chuckled to \nhimself.  Here would be a place to start anew.  Rebuild the Predacon \nEmpire.  He smiled and scanned the area for other lifeforms. \n\n\n"}}
