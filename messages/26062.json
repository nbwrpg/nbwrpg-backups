He\n&gt; had just exited spain, and he left a trail of smoke where he had \nbeen\n&gt; damaged, and he couldnt think straight. All he wanted was to crush \nthe life\n&gt; out of one measely bot, was that to much to ask. He saw the group of\n&gt; robots, as he approached and honked his horn, which made a huge \nnoise.\n\n\n"}}
