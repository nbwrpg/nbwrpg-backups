She ws tired and she knew \nit.  She smiled and put her hand on his shoulder. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve \nbeen wondering, why did you come out here? You were safe back at the \nbase. Why&#39;d you follow me out here? I don&#39;t  get it. And another \nthing I don&#39;t get. Why does this bot feel so strongly about his past? \nI mean, I know the past, but it&#39;s like I read it in a history log.  \nIt&#39;s there, but I don&#39;t feel anything for it.&quot; She had other \nquestions reeling around in her mind, but she wasnted these few \nquestions answered first.  She turned her head and looked at \nVulois, &quot;And why do I even give a care about him.&quot; She then looked at \nCyberShark and looked into his eyes. &quot;And why do I care for you so \nmuch. Why?&quot;  She looked at him, hoping for some answers.\n\n\n"}}
