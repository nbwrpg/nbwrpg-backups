Seeing Suukie \non a screen he slammed a pincher on the ground.  &lt;Lord Hell Beast, the \nMaximal&#39;s &quot;allies&quot; are attacking us.  They&#39;ve tricked us!  Return quickly!&gt;  \nPressing a few buttons, all klaxons began to flash red, base defenses came \nonline and opened fire on Suukie.  The intercom blared with Double Punch&#39;s \nsteady voice.  ~All Predacons, this is Double Punch.  For now, I&#39;m in command \nuntil someone of higher rank relieves me.  We are under attack by the \nMaximals!  All forces are to take battle stations, and counter assault the \nenemy forces.  So far it just looks like a scouting party, but more are \nobviously on the way!  SO MOVE IT!!!~\n\n(I hope no one minds me doing this, on the Predacon&#39;s side that is)\n\nInjector jumped, having been in his quarters.  &quot;Maximals, hehe.  Time for \nthem to feel my sting!&quot; he said, taking out his stinger missile launcher, \nheading for a hatch.\n\n-----\n\nManterror in the engine doing routine check ups, hearing the intercon slammed \nhis foot on the ground.  Pressing a few buttons, he set up a network of extra \nenergy just in case the shields or weapons went down, he then headed for a \nhatch, banging on people&#39;s quarters and yelling brief explanations and \ntelling them to &quot;Get the slag up!&quot;.\n\n"}}
