Must we always follow a simila=\r\nr path even if it may lead us over a cliff to our demise? Talon is right, P=\r\nerceptor risked his own life so that we may still remain functionable. If h=\r\ne were to turn his back on us, he would have done that vorns ago. Now, I wi=\r\nll not hear another negative word about Perceptor. Not in my pressence. He =\r\nhas risked his life for us, and now we must do him the respect of showing h=\r\nim our thanks for his efforts. Now, enough bickering, we have a tunnel to s=\r\neal off and Rodimus Prime to bring back online. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want t=\r\no see any of you bickering either. Am I understood Cheetor?&quot;\n\nCheetor looke=\r\nd at Tuscon, his optics cool yet dim, then he finally\nnodded, &quot;You are in c=\r\nharge.&quot; he said, sounding sullen and crestfallen.\n&quot;If you say it, then it m=\r\nust be true.&quot; He turned and began walking\nback toward the Ark, his shoulder=\r\ns slumped, his head bowed a little.\n\nRamulus had glanced back at Cheetor an=\r\nd then Tuscon, and then just\nshook his head again as he continued to walk a=\r\nway. He had been helping\nRhinox, perhaps it was time for him to return to t=\r\nhat mission. Too\nmuch time around the Ark never made him feel good. he pref=\r\nered the\nwide open out doors, not to be confined to and one spot.\n\n&gt; &quot;Wow, =\r\nya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure knows his words =\r\nof wisdom. Definitely what Optimus Prime would&#39;ve done.&quot;\n\nLord Elder watche=\r\nd Cheetor walk back to the Ark as well, as he\nlistened to Quickstride. Elde=\r\nr folded his arms behind his back as he\nturned to look back at Quickstride,=\r\n &quot;Is it?&quot; Elder asked.\n\n&quot;Trust cannot be demanded or commanded only earned.=\r\n&quot; He said quietly.\n&quot;Cheetor was not with you to watch the events that you s=\r\naw that caused\nyou to come to trust Perceptor, how can he be expected to tr=\r\nust\nwithout it?&quot; Elder&#39;s voice was not accusatory but calm and reasoning.\n&quot;=\r\nCheetor only knows what he sees here and now, and that is a Predacon\nthat h=\r\ne has fought against for a long time. It will take time to get\nover that, t=\r\no see him as a companion, perhaps one day as a friend.&quot;\n\nElder turned to lo=\r\nok back at Perceptor, &quot;And it will take Perceptor\ntime to come to realize h=\r\nis new role here, and that the life that he\nhas known has ended, he has a n=\r\new part to play.&quot;\n\nElder looked at Cheetor and Ramulus for a moment, watchi=\r\nng each one\nwalk away in different directions. &quot;It is Tuscon&#39;s job now to b=\r\nring us\ntogether, unite us under a common banner. That is the hardest part =\r\nof\nbeing a leader, not just leading but inspiring others to follow.&quot;\n\nElder=\r\n turned to follow after Cheetor, his steps quick to catch up with\nthe swift=\r\n Maximal, he would need a pep talk.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
