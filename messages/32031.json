She was sure that his beast mode would be in controle again but had \nhopes that he might actually be able to talk to her, maybe getting a little \nmore controle this time.\nBut to her utter shock he began to bend down and try to sniff her but she \nsidles out of the way intime with a dirty look on her face and hissed at \nhim, turning her face towards FireBlade again.\n&lt; How rude! I&#39;m going to talk to him after I beat some sense into him for \nthis!&gt;*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
