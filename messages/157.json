The force of Dinobot&#39;s blow \nthrew her to the ground, her sword and staff laying somewhere in the \nsurrounding shrubbery. Dinobot&#39;s blow to her face had disabled her optic \nlasers. Now weaponless, Tavatron staggered to her feet.\n\n&quot;Damn.&quot; Tavatron snarled through clenched teeth, mech-fluid flowing freely \nfrom her wounds. She crouched low to the ground, not bothering to try and \nstop the flow of mech-fluid.\n\nTavatron growled at Dinobot while her eyes searched the surrounding area for \nher lost weapons.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sun, 16 Apr 2000 12:05:17 PDT\n&gt;\n&gt;* Dinobot snarled, the blow from Tavatron had momentarily taken him off\n&gt;balance but he then regained it quickly and stood at the ready.\n&gt;She had taken his advice and was now out of his reach, just as he had\n&gt;calculated.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; You...are more then what I first thought.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* He looked at her with his one good optic and judged how far she was from\n&gt;him, it was then that he struck!!\n&gt;With quick speed Dinobot covered the distance between him and Tavatron in\n&gt;less then a blink of an optic and raised a clawed hand.\n&gt;He brought it down hard on Tavatron&#39;s torso again and slashed just above \n&gt;the\n&gt;last wound, he then slammed his shoulder into Tavatron&#39;s cheek!*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
