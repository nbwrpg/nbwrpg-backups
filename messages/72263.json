Yet it was hard to tell how conscious he was since\n&gt; he was stuck in vehicle mode.  Transmission, brake, and wiper fluids leak\n&gt; from beneath his frame as well as antifreeze and washer fluid.  Oil and fuel\n&gt; too seem to trickle out from beneath him.  For all intensive purposes he was\n&gt; totaled.  Not one inch of his frame appeared undamaged.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ughh.  Can&#39;t transform.  Can&#39;t feel anything.  Can&#39;t see anything either.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause from RAMULUS, it sounded like he was running\nsomething over NIGHTSHIFT. &quot;I am a medic, but I am no doctor, we&#39;re\ngoing to have to get you back to a CR chamber.&quot;\n\n&quot;Can&#39;t we just pull him into robot mode?&quot; The voice was WOLFGANG&#39;s.\n&quot;There is a CR chamber at the back of the shuttle, but it&#39;s not going\nto hold him like this.&quot;\n\nRAMULUS replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe helping to get him into robot\nmode will help.&quot; His uncertainty was evident in his voice.\n\nDelicatetly RAMULUS and WOLFGANG tried to push and pull, to manuver\nNIGHTSHIFT back to robot mode.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
