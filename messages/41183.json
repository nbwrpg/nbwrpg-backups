Talking over the comm will distract one person, at most, and waste our own time. Attacking in small groups can get those small groups eliminated, although it might be very neccessary to spread their defences, yes.&quot;\n\nHe looks at a table, lost in thought for a second. &quot;Although we can indeed be suited for water.

Then small teams attack differant point of their base,\n&gt; &gt; causeing their defense to spread at minimal capacity. Those teams \n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; keep moving. Attack quickly and move to the next point of attack. \n&gt; While\n&gt; &gt; this is happaning another team, most likely us Commanders, find a \n&gt; way\n&gt; &gt; into the base and extract DarkFate. Also this will have to be done\n&gt; &gt; quickly because we are not suited for water. I still say the best \n&gt; way in\n&gt; &gt; is from me drilling up from the elow the ocean floor and into the \n&gt; base.\n&gt; &gt; The only problem is we need to know a little bit about that bases\n&gt; &gt; design.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He looked to DarkFate with a look of &#39;What do you think?&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
