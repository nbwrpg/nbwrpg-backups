It was night time, or at least that&#39;s what the low power lighting indicated.  \n&quot;Lights!&quot;\n&quot;....&quot;\n&quot;Liiights!&quot;\n&quot;....&quot;\n&quot;LIGHTS! COMPUTER! LIGHTS! #@$@#! LIGHTS!&quot;\n&quot;....&quot;\n\nCeleron removed himself from the chamber, the nice new polish on his exterior reminded him of the last time he had had a decent nap.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s odd...&quot;\n&quot;What&#39;s odd?&quot;\nThere was no reply.\n&quot;Is someone there?&quot;\n&quot;....&quot;\n&quot;Open door.&quot;\n&quot;....&quot;\n&quot;The Computer is obviously offline... hmm.&quot;\n\nCeleron pryed the door open, which actually took a few minutes since it was sealed.  He carefull walked into the hallway.  He performed a quick heat scan, and found no unusual heat radiation.  He sneaked around the corner into the hallway that lead to the bridge; and was shocked to see a hole blasted into the door.  Celeron&#39;s arm weapons came online and made a gradually higher and higher pitched whining sound (like a camera flash charging).\n\nCeleron bent down to examine the hole.  He noticed two things: It was 3 hours old, and it was done from inside the bridge.  He crawled through the hole into the bridge.\n\nHis portable computer had been smashed accross the holotable and would probably never funtion again.  The holotable had its shields on when this happened so it was undamaged from that blow, but then when the main computer&#39;s power was cut it had gone offline.  The computer room had been busted open and the power chord had been neatly severed as if they didn&#39;t want to damage it.  He reconnected the chord and the fans of the computers began to humm again.  He repair the door and closed it.\n\nThere was a noise at the door.  Celeron whiped his head around and found the muzzle of a chaingun in his neck.  His reflexes had failed him again.\n\n&quot;GET OUT!&quot;\nThe dark figure reloaded his chainguns as a show of force.\n&quot;May I ask you a few questions first?&quot;\n&quot;No...You are GOing TO LEAVE.&quot;\nThe bot smiled and insulting smile.\n&quot;Initiating energon shock in 10...&quot;\n&quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!&quot;\n&quot;7...6...5..&quot;\nThe figure vanished through the hole in the door.  Celeron quickly shot some liquid metal that he had used to repair the computer door, onto the main door.\n&quot;3....&quot;\nCeleron opened the computer room door and closed it behind him as he tried to turn around in that cramped space.\nA muffled &quot;1...&quot; could be heard in the room, and fortunatly the door protected him.\n&quot;Computer&quot;\n&quot;Yes...&quot;\n&quot;Display access log from before powerdown...&quot;\n&quot;.......&quot;\nA screen lighted up.  He saw that no one had accessed the computer accept him in the past 4 years.\n&quot;Right. Then...display security logs.&quot;\n&quot;.....&quot;\nThe screen showed an medium sized bot blast open the bridge door and causing the distruction.\n&quot;Freeze. Itentify that person.&quot;\n&quot;....Fumeral a level 4 security prisoner held on deck b3.  Would you like a criminal history?&quot;\n&quot;By all means.&quot;\n&quot;Distruction of Millitary facilities on 33223, 30 counts of Murder of those guarding those facilities, 200 random murders all carried out in a tourtous in-humane manner, killing of 12 prison guards from 233to266 ship time.  And 22 more pages of lesser offences.&quot;\n&quot;Tactical data&quot;\n&quot;He has a relatively thick armor probably stolen or fabricated on this ship.  He carries, missles and an 2 energy cannons on each arm which he has found ammunition for, he has been trained in 12 forms of battlefield combat and 6 martial arts.  He is a expert marksmen and knows how to use any object as a lethal weapon.  Clocked Landspeed:200mph Clocked airspeed:500mph.  He has been defeated and subdued a recorded 3 times, each time involved a team of 20 or more and caused heavy casualties, each fight lasted a total of 5 hours and....&quot;\n&quot;Computer I get the picture.&quot;\n&quot;Good...&quot;\n&quot;Is there a way for you to contain him?&quot;\n&quot;No...there is an offline unit, a corrections computer that is used for prison riots.  But it is located in the warden&#39;s office.  5 decks down 4 minutes into the ship.  I can open all doors up to the prison section but beyond that I cannot help you.&quot;\n&quot;Would he have broken out of there to get into here though?&quot;\n&quot;Yes...I failed to account for him as a variable.  Also you could attempt to wake surviving crew members, located in these areas displayed now.&quot;\n&quot;A team of 7 including me.&quot;\n&quot;Affimative.&quot;\n&quot;Will they want to cooperate with me?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, it is their sworn duty to combat prisoner outbreaks.&quot;\n&quot;All right.
