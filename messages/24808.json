Out came the Completed Beast mode of Galvatron. (as seen in \npicture.) The cloak of Death hung from his back. His red dragon mode now a \npure silver color. he had guns on both knees and gold should armor. His tail \ncould open up to show death&#39;s sythe. And out of his arm He could retrieve \nApocalypse&#39;s flame sword. The three where no one. He  spread his wings and \nflew off. he tried to see what his robot mode loked like. He couldnt \ntransform. He was stuck. The drill mode, the robot mode, and the dragon mode \nwhere too complex to transform into manualy. He would havbe to find another \nway. He scanned the region for another. \n\n"}}
