Just then the computer \nscreen \n&gt; comes on.  It shows a ship near the moon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Computer:  Lutienent we have deteched a transformer vessel near the \n&gt; moon.  We have also deteched close to 300 transformer signitures on \n&gt; the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  There&#39;s no way ny brother could have beaten me here and gotten \nso \n&gt; many transformers in one place.\n&gt; \n&gt; C:  Not all read Maximal.

Transwarp is out  \n&gt; because of the Asteroid belt.  It could take months to estimate the \n&gt; right timing and directions.\n&gt; \n&gt; L: DANG! Oh well you said Predicons and Decipticons.  I&#39;m sure they \n&gt; can help.  Prepare the escape pod. And fire whatever weapons we \nhave \n&gt; (just 4 small laser cannons) at that thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heads toward Eastern Asia.
