He then looks around.\n\n&quot; Great, not what =\r\nI was intending ta do.  Maan if Tucson was here now he&#39;d be ticked off big =\r\ntime.  Yo, Perceptor, Windlord, can ya hear me?  I&#39;m in a bit of a bind.  I=\r\n got my aft trapped by humans, who seem ta be from a more advanced time per=\r\niod.  Notify Lord Elder and tell him ta wire Tucson and the others.

Yet, he =\r\nmakes no moves to attack them.  The\n&gt; &gt; average panther would have lunged a=\r\nnd swiped at the Humans, yet he does\n&gt; &gt; nothing of the sort.  He senses so=\r\nmething different about these Humans.\n&gt; &gt; They did not seem to belong in th=\r\ne time period they were in.  They weren&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; Protohuman. Therefore, he did=\r\nn&#39;t need to keep his cover. He converts to\n&gt; &gt; robot mode, looks to the dar=\r\nt and back at the Humans.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;ll hit you guys on tak&#39;n this  out la=\r\nter, but seriously, I know you\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t from around here so you got some =\r\nbig time explaining ta do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He stands put, arms folded into his che=\r\nst, and a sharp eye on the Human who\n&gt; &gt; shot him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And don&#39;t even=\r\n think about nail&#39;n me with that thing again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahh yes, a =\r\nMaximal.&quot; The voice, the one that gave the command earlier\n&gt; could be heard=\r\n, it had an arrogant humor in it as it spoke. He walked\n&gt; up carrying what =\r\ncould only be a flashlight, something totally unheard\n&gt; of for the protohum=\r\nans - The flashlight was strapped to his wrist.\n&gt; &quot;You are smaller than you=\r\nr Autobot cousins, but everything we heard\n&gt; about you is all the same.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; The figure shined the light at NIGHTSHIFT for a moment and then down\n&gt; t=\r\nhe hall beyond him and then back. it showed that the gates covered\n&gt; the en=\r\ntire width and nearly height of the tunnel on both sides.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come.&quot; The =\r\nlead figure said to the other two. &quot;We have what we need,\n&gt; let us check on=\r\n the Predacons.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They turn to walk back down the tunnel in the directi=\r\non they came in.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Keep in mind Nightshift is trapped between two s=\r\ntrong gates, one\n&gt; on each side of him. Perceptor and Windlord are on one s=\r\nide of the two\n&gt; gates, the side nearest the entrance and the humans are on=\r\n the other\n&gt; side of the two gates - the side going further down the tunnel=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
