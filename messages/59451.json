Then\nto recover Shad&#39;s data tracks for restoring his body,\nPrimus goes back to the moment of his death and takes\ncomponents from him so that no data is lost (also a\nway for me to give players an idea of his death in\ncase it related to any of their characters- btw nic,\nShadimus wasn&#39;t in a shuttle when he collided into the\nnemesis, he was in his air attack mode). Then the post\nwent forward to the time of the current posts from\nother characters, so anyone capable of receiving an\nopen Maximal commumique would have heard it over their\ncomms.
