In the RPG rules charter \nit \n&gt; &gt; blatantly states that there will be no offensive drones(group \n&gt; &gt; Charachters) except for those used for Construction and repairs. \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Two drones used in Kyles post violate that rule, thus another \nreason \n&gt; &gt; why I believe we should have a temp council for the RPG. One that \n&gt; &gt; would exist until one(Im not sure if Megan is alive. heh)or two \ncome \n&gt; &gt; back. Of course once one member is back they&#39;ll have all say so \nit \n&gt; &gt; would be up to them if the temp council stayed and helped until \nall \n&gt; &gt; four members have returned. But thats just my two cents.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n\n"}}
