At the moment, you didn&#39;t post for dodging Megatron&#39;s \nattack, Sunhawk grabbed Megatron and put him into a headlock, and \nthen turned him around to face Kup&#39;s weaponfire. THAT is what&#39;s \nwrong. You should be posting that Sunhawks tries to grab Megatron to \nput him into a headlock, not that he suddenly has him in a headlock. \n=)\n\nCause talking ooc style is delaying Megatron, I&#39;m going to just go \nwith that you&#39;ve done. I&#39;m not sure that Azure wants Warhead dead, \nso Megatron is going to just try to run with Warhead. Heh, he&#39;s got \nthe whole maximal base running him down right now eh. =P\n\n-- Megatron --\n\nMegatron&#39;s axe swishes harmlessly past Sunhawk&#39;s side. The over \npowered swing allows Sunhawk to grapple him, and get him into a \nheadlock.\n\n&quot;Hah, a headlock?!&quot; Megatron gets hit by one of Kup&#39;s shots, a char \nmark appears on his back armour, then he grabs for Sunhawk&#39;s legs, \nattempting to try to throw him at Kup, along with a plasma blast. \n(he&#39;s going to throw Sunhawk and try to hit him with a plasma blast \nafter the throw)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Here&#39;s how I like to do it.
