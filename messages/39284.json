Outside at a \nportion of the large under sea base, two massive doors slide away to \nreveal a large hole in the ground. A moment later a huge claw flys up \nthrough the water and into the air beofre it latches onto the shuttle \nwith Blackknightmare inside. The claw begins to squeeze trapping the \nship in a deathgrip before it drags it under water.(Yes I got \npermission from yan for the huge claw thing :) ))\n\nBlight: &quot;Have your men arrive here in the next five minutes or else \nthat shuttle and all within it shall be melted into a puddle.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
