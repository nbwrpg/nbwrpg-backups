Some called him a wizard others called him a\n&gt; scientist, b=\r\nut as to where he came from or what his true goals were\n&gt; none knew. He has=\r\n served with MAGMATRON for as far back as anyone\n&gt; could remember. Rarely s=\r\neen in the past he was elusive, secretive and\n&gt; as wicked as they came.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The nurse looked at UNUS and WHEELIE, &quot;Perhaps we should let this one\n&gt; r=\r\nest for a while. &quot; She glanced back at RODIMUS.\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS nodded, &quot;Of cours=\r\ne.&quot; He said as he looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Perhaps we\n&gt; should give him more tim=\r\ne to recover.&quot; His words bordering somewhere\n&gt; between a command and a sugg=\r\nestion.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from WHEELIE as RODIMUS was made to lay=\r\n down and he walked out.  For this moment, his options were limited.  He co=\r\nuld not leave Rodimus, and without further assistance he could not contact =\r\nthe MAXIMALS due to the jamming field that was covering the entire basin an=\r\nd area.\n\nAt this point, he also could not ask those who lived here for furt=\r\nher help, not wanting to risk them being a target or making them take sides=\r\n over in this war.\n\nAnd also getting the &#39;suggestio&#39; over from UNUS over to=\r\nwards RODIMUS, wondering just why they were so strongly but keeping quiet a=\r\ns he spoke to RODIMUS, &quot;Yes, rest.  Your friends will be around soon.  Don&#39;=\r\nt succumb to gloom and doom.&quot;\n\nWaiting for UNUS to tell him where to go now=\r\n, not wanting to do anything aggressive, and filing away the information on=\r\n SABERBACK and MAGMATRON to tell them as soon as he could, as well as a pos=\r\nsible third army, and an outpost of escaped neutrals.\n\n\n"}}
