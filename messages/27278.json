The \n&gt; shots that are being shot in this battle would fall into the 4-shot \n&gt; max category. My next post will be about that.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Killfest/EndBringer/Scyther/Incarcinator/Prowl/Greven/Demise::\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest flips backwatds from the explosion of Firearm&#39;s charge \n&gt; against his back. He recieves Astroblast&#39;s transmission and spins \n&gt; around, flying toward the shuttle-bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m ready to leave,&quot; he says into his comm, boosting toward \n&gt; Astroblast with Firearm in pursuit. He was quickly losing the Maximal \n&gt; bacause Firearm had to deal with avoiding the Energonians&#39; gunfire.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; EndBringer manages to stabalize himself in space, flying toward \n&gt; Astroblast.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scyther stops in midflight, recieving an order from Killfest to \n&gt; retreat. He activates his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Pinsir, Incarcinator, meet me back at the shuttle, we&#39;re getting out \n&gt; of here,&quot; he says into the comm, boosting back toward the shuttle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Incarcinator growls, continuing to try and crush Prowl in his grasp. \n&gt; The Maximals armor was very strong, but that didn&#39;t stop Incarcinator \n&gt; from continuing to try to squeeze Prowl to death. He feels Prowl&#39;s \n&gt; palms pushing on him to try to get him away, but the Maximal had no \n&gt; chance of success with just pushing. Incarcinator recieves Scyther&#39;s \n&gt; transmission and activates his commlink to reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m just a bin b-&quot; is all he could say before two plates slide aside \n&gt; on Prowl&#39;s palms, Bluestreaks daggers shooting out and passing into \n&gt; and all the way through Incarcinator&#39;s torso, crossing somewhere \n&gt; inside him and emerging from his back. His grip on Prowl fails, the \n&gt; bot choking on some mechfluid and going into stasis lock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prowl pulls the daggers out of Incarcinator, boosting off back toward \n&gt; the battle and leaving the stasis-locked bot floating toward earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thanks, Bluestreak,&quot; he says, looking back at the four streams of \n&gt; mechfluid emerging from Incarcinator&#39;s body.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Greven and Demise also recieve Killfest&#39;s transmission, but their \n&gt; shuttle had been destroyed when they arrived. Grimmler turns, flying \n&gt; toward a Predacon shuttle.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Demise stabalizes in the air, also flying toward a Predacon shuttle \n&gt; upon recieving Killfest&#39;s orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: yah... 25 shots everytime is way extreme even if it is with in \n&gt; the rules.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Astroblast having transformed into shuttle mode already, opens \n&gt; &gt; a comm-link to Killfest and EndBringer, &quot;Looks like a retreat this \n&gt; time, \n&gt; &gt; are you coming?&quot; He swoops towards Motormaster catching him in \n&gt; &gt; his hatch.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
