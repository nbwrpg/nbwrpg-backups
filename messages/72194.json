Even in RODIMUS&#39; chamber it is=\r\n still somewhat\n&gt; dim. The lights brightened at his entrance, but the inter=\r\nior was still\n&gt; somehwat spartan and the walls were colored in a dark color=\r\ned paint. A\n&gt; desk and chair, a recharging chamber, a samll viewscreen and =\r\na control\n&gt; panel presumably hooked to the bases computer systems. There wa=\r\ns a\n&gt; small work out center on one side where RODIMUS could presumably work=\r\n\n&gt; on his target practice as well as work on testing the upper limits of\n&gt; =\r\nstrength and endurance.\n&gt; \n&gt; In one corner there was a picture of ELITA and=\r\n NIGHTLIGHT it looked to\n&gt; be hand drawn, although in the picture it was li=\r\nke NIGHTLIGHT was\n&gt; before she got her current fuzor beastmode, something l=\r\nike how she was\n&gt; when she first escaped HYDRAS&#39; clutches.\n&gt; \n&gt; That may al=\r\nso remind NIGHTLIGHT of what she may have heard of the\n&gt; insectile creature=\r\ns that RODIMUS mentioned. About how TUSCON and the\n&gt; others had to fight th=\r\neir way past them and escape out of the other\n&gt; side running back towards t=\r\nhe ARK. RODIMUS had nearly sacrificed his\n&gt; life at that point so that TUSC=\r\nON could escape HYDRAS&#39; base and TUSCON\n&gt; had dragged him all the way back =\r\nto be repaired. It was a thrilling\n&gt; time. It was around the time that RODI=\r\nMUS seemed to have fought off\n&gt; the last of the dark taint that had been so=\r\n much a part of his spark\n&gt; and finally freed himself of being DARK RODIMUS=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; And yet here was DARK RODIMUS again - - - strange isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; DAR=\r\nK RODIMUS turned to look at NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;So, when did you get the\n&gt; new for=\r\nm?&quot; He looked at her, examining her new frame and the changes\n&gt; it made in =\r\nher robot mode. &quot;It is very . . . becoming on you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
