It&#39;s my style of writing\nkicked in on auto pilot and i do use characters to\ninrich what i type. I forgot about that rule until\nafter i sent it. I tried to unsend but it was to late.\nI am sorry. Second i saw that my ship was in doubt\nabout letting her stay. Please note that she was\nposted coming before the maximal ship arrived and I\nused that to combine the two arrivals sort of. Look\nthis is becoming much more a head ache then i really\nintended her to be. She was ment for fun.\n\n Look I know the ship is powerful and deadly, she was\nment to be that way to add a certain deadly element to\nthe game. Her mobility is over rated and way over\nfeared. Look I wasnt nor ever planned on galvating\naround the oceans with her, simply change anchorages\ntime to time with maybe a trip to the poles or\nsomething. I even asked zardus about her capablites\nbefore i posted and he said there was nothing wrong\nwith what i posted, i got the email to prove it.\n\n Why should she be only one mobile?She while neutral\nis a predcion ship and was to make a nusiance of\nherself. taking part in dark experiments, going places\nshe shouldnt be. \n\nAs to her firepower, come on, i know games like this,\nthe firepower would almost never be used to full\nextent and weaknesswere built in anyway.  Besides why\nuse it all at once anyway, people would hate me and\nthe game would end becuase people were slagged. I\nwould be banned etc.I didn&#39;t want all this trouble\nreally its why i asked about creating her BEFORE I\nJOINED.\n\n  She can be defeated but think people if she is an\nocean bound vessel how does she hurt bases way far in\nland? Her missiles? Maybe but then those can be shot\ndown, her main armament? That&#39;s a straight beam\nweapon, she can&#39;t shot over moutains or into valleys.\nHer cannons also cant shot around the world, they got\nrange but not infinte range.\n\n  Everyone thinks she&#39;s all powerful but she&#39;s not,\nshe&#39;s got handicaps and achilles heels. Her water\nrestriction prevents access to several areas inland.\nHer deep draft forces ocean voyages, she can&#39;t steam\nup rivers. Her massive side also makes concealing\nimpossible.\n\n  Look and after these founding messages she would be\nlittle more then base of operations anyway. How many\nstories can all of what she is come into play. Besides\nher capablites make good missions for characters to.\n\n Here&#39;s a few ideas on missions-\n\n Disabling the ship&#39;s ablity to leave Earth\n Crippling her transwarp engines\n Stealing her targeting componets\n Disabling her ablity to move period\n Capturing the ship\n\n Like I said she was never ment to be such a head\nache, like i said i asked zardus before i brought her\nif she was okay. she was to be home of the militrons,\na fitting home for a militristic race of predicons. I\nam being resonable here, not a pain.\n\n  \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
