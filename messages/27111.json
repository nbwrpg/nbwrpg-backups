My bad. And yes, FireFox, Megaraptor is the most recent species of raptor found and is indeed much larger then Utahraptor. However, it was not 1996 it was discovered. I believe it was 1998. However, I may be mistaken so I draw an even and place the theory that it was somwhere from 1996-1998.)\r\n\r\n** Vlad was pleased with himself for being cunning enough to get this woman&#39;s trust on his side, even though he had no intentions to betray that trust. But also wondering if she had guessed that he was a Predacon yet, thus, the enemy. However, his mission was to learn as much about Von as possible in order to defeat him, not step over people who assist him in that quest.\r\nHe stood by as Fenox smiles sweetly at the comment he had passed moment&#39;s before and took his arm which he had offered to her, beginning to walk with her in tow towards a information station with which he could finally upload data on his missing brother. Data he could use to crush Von and take the family estate for himself. Which was a sweet thought.\r\nIt wasn&#39;t long before Vlad had walked uop to the computer, looking it over and deciding that it would be best that this woman handle the information gather and not himself, since it wouldn&#39;t be wise to ever let a stranger near to find something that the faction would be better off keeping secret.  Thusm Vlad gestured to the board with his free hand.** &quot; After you, my lady.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
