But parts of it were plant, \nnot Cybertronian machinery.\n\nFeral stood, feeling groggy, but quickly felt energized, as if he had \nadrenaline.  But he was a robot.  His optics came online, and he let out a \nscream and turned, and let out another scream, that became a laugh.\n\nVerdant rose to all four legs, wondering what was going on.  Wait, he didn&#39;t \nhave four legs!  He let out a yell, but it turned into a roar.  -What the \nPit&#39;s going on?- he asked himself, looking around and seeing a mix of plant, \nanimal, and machinery that was Feral.\n\nYou&#39;re a monster! he tried to say, but it came out as grunts.\n\n&quot;I...I can understand you!  Verdant, is that you?&quot;\n\n"}}
