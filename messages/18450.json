The\n&gt; &gt; scientist gathered DNA samples and injected them into the translife\n&gt; on my\n&gt; &gt; old planet.

But her mind was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to figure out what this bot was really up to.  This bot\n&gt; wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what she appeared to be.  There was something that LadyHawk was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hiding.   But she couldn&#39;t quite figure it out.  She wondered why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this bot, who knew all this knowledge was having her do most of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work? Then it came to her, LadyHawk didn&#39;t know it all.  But\n&gt; then, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she didn&#39;t know, why pretend to know.  To save her tail feathers?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most llikely.
