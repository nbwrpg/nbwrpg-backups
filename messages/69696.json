QUICKSTRIDE, MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Within moments he =\r\ntransforms into his robot mode and runs off in the directon of the shuttle.=\r\n Even on two feet he proves swift and wastes no time in getting to his dest=\r\nination.\n\nElder sighed as Quickstride moved off to ready the shuttle. There=\r\n was\na time many years ago when he was much like this younger Maximal, but\n=\r\ntime has worn on him.\n\nHe had just began to bring the Ark&#39;s defense systems=\r\n online when Rat\nTrap reestablished his connection to him.\n\n&gt; &quot;Sorry, ran i=\r\nnta interference, I&#39;m back online Lord Elder. I&#39;m about a quarter of the wa=\r\ny through the base&#39;s pipe system. But those uglies ain&#39;t givn&#39; up on me. I =\r\ngotta do somethn&#39; ta distract &#39;em... Now let&#39;s see.... If I was these guys =\r\nwhat would I be worried about? Hmmm, well, defenses for the most part, and =\r\nthen any circuitry related ta power, computer systems.... That&#39;s it. I bet =\r\nif I can find a few electrical ports I might be able ta pull some plugs her=\r\ne &#39;n there..&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes Rat Trap!&quot; Elder said as he watched his own defense sys=\r\ntems come\nonline under his hands, &quot;If you could bring down even some of the=\r\nir\ndefense systems, it would give us a chance!&quot;\n\nLord Elder smiled as he wa=\r\ntched first one, and then two, and finally\nall five lights went from red to=\r\n yellow and then green - the system\nwas online. The room began to hum as sy=\r\nstems fed and rerouted power\nthrough the ship. It couldn&#39;t hold off a full =\r\nscale minion attack, but\nperhaps it would give them time to get back here i=\r\nf something went\nwrong.\n\nLord Elder opened his channel to Rat Trap, &quot;We are=\r\n about to leave, do\nwhat you can.&quot; With a last glance at the controls he qu=\r\nickly left the\nroom, making his own way swiftly towards the shuttle bay.\n\n*=\r\n*********************\n\nAs Quickstride made his way towards the shuttle, he =\r\nentered the large\nentrance/exit chamber of the Ark. To the fore was a large=\r\n door way\nthat led into the outside world, although the doors leading out w=\r\nere\ncurrently closed.\n\nAll about the room there were larger ancient transfo=\r\nrmers, strewn\nabout as if cast there by some storm, or perhaps some massive=\r\n crash!\nOptimus Prime and Megatron could be seen, looking to be locked in\nb=\r\nattle even in their offline state. A quick glance around would reveal\nvario=\r\nus other Autobots and Decepticons laying around, all in a similar\noffline c=\r\nondition.\n\nIn fact the entire room looked to be battle damaged, computer sc=\r\nreens\nsmashed, consoles split, burnt and ruined. Even the walls look to be\n=\r\nbent and cracked in places, wires hung from holes in the ceiling.\n\nHowever =\r\nin the middle of all this cacophony a standard Maximal shuttle\nis positione=\r\nd, standing in a small relatively clear space in the room.\n\nAs Quickstride =\r\nentered the room a hum could be heard as the Ark&#39;s\nouter defense shields sp=\r\nrang into place.\n\nOOC: Figured I would give Quickstride some description of=\r\n the room! :)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
