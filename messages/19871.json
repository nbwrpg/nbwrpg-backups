She looked down at her wrist. &quot;I saw that you \nhad a bot with you.  I didn&#39;t realize it was Aracnia. I&#39;m having the \nconveration recorded. Just as insurance in case anything happens to \nme.&quot; She smiled at Megatron, keeping her cool. She wasn&#39;t going to \ntell him that Destructor could have been listening this whole \ntime.  &quot;Also, with a treaty,it is only temarary.  A council will be \nlong standing.  WE can all go our separate ways, but we will need the \ncouncil incase of events that may take place in the future. With the \ncouncil, the Predacons will be assured of continued rain over this \nplanet.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looks to Kitkat, &quot;I suggest a treaty with the \nAllience. Our \n&gt; might would crush the Maximals, and stamp out all the other \ndisgusting little \n&gt; groups that pain us. Then, after all is settled.....we simply end \nthe \n&gt; agreement and go about on our own agenda. And if it happens to be \nthe \n&gt; destruction of the Allience, so be it. After all....I dont think it \nwould be \n&gt; any sooner than a few months until the Maximals are on the decline.&quot;\n&gt;     He looked at her wrist. There, blinking silently, was her \ncommlink. Why \n&gt; was it blinking? What was the little doggie up to? &quot;Um, darling, \npray tell \n&gt; what is that blinking light on your commlink signify?&quot; He said, \ngazing closer.\n\n\n"}}
