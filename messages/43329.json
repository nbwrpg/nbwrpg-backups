When the Deceptigoon had grabbed the dragon lady, \nAzureBlade had begun to fear the worse. So, behind the enemy&#39;s back he \nhad powered his plasma blade and even overpowered it. It was now so \npowerful it had drained his rifle&#39;s power. Seeing her very \nexistence being in danger, the dragon slashed at Triggerhappy, aiming \nat the waist.\nAzureBlade:WWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!\n!!!!!!!!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Samir Duran&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Triggerhappy/Hell Drak::\n&gt; \n&gt; Triggerhappy was hit by 2 of the energy blasts, and slightly lost \naltitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey you-ERRGH,&quot; he yelled, as Hell Drak jumped onto the windshield.\n&gt; \n&gt; With her good claws and talons, and being an elite bot sent down to \nEarth\n&gt; with her brother, she had a good grip, and was debating on whether \nshe\n&gt; should make Triggerhappy crash, or do something else, which she \ndidn&#39;t know.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re going down, punk!  Literally!&quot; she yelled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hell Drak moved up, and fired a lazer disc at the right wing.  \nTriggerhappy\n&gt; was spiraling and moving all around, but Hell Drak held on tight.\n&gt; Triggerhappy&#39;s wing was farely damaged, and now Triggerhappy had \nlost\n&gt; balance, and was now losing altitude because of lack of balance.  \nHell Drak\n&gt; was beginning to get annoyed because Lurker is failing to use \npronouns, so I\n&gt; will use them now.  Hell Drak held onto the end, and she was trying \nto bring\n&gt; the Decepticon downwards.  If Blowpipe tried to interfere, he would \nbe\n&gt; toast.  Hell Drak brought Triggerhappy down, but then, he \ntransformed to\n&gt; robot mode, and so it looked like Hell Drak was humping him or \nsomething.\n&gt; Triggerhappy shoved her onto the ground, then he grabbed her throat, \nand put\n&gt; his gun to her head, ready to shoot......\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;AzureBlade, this is your queue!&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 10:39 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Attack!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade:\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s make a bet, lady (to Hell drak).
