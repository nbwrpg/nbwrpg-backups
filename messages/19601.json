She sat up and looked \naround the lab. Looking down at her arms, she could see the outside \nof the skin changing. It was starting to cover the outside of the \nform. She moved slowly and a bit awkward. She stood up and leaned \nagainst the table. She looked at Veratis and spoke in a very sratchy \nvoice, &quot;where is lunarpine? wil he make it back soon?&quot; SHe tried not \nto focus on the discomfort that came with the changing of her form. \nShe took a step forward and stopped. It felt all to strange to be \nwalking again. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk searched the medical files from any past injuries the \nalliance\n&gt; members might have had. she was hoping to simulate the DNA through \nthe CR\n&gt; chambers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Phobias babies watched the happenings around KitKats group. they \nwatched the\n&gt; conference with Magnus and Gabriel with simulated interest. This \nwas the\n&gt; type of agreement Phobia was hoping for. Only through peace talks \ncould the\n&gt; temporal anomalies stop. either talks or destruction.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis watched as the protoform took the shape of the DNA, then \nchange into\n&gt; owl form then a sort of robot form. he hadn&#39;t heard her in a while \nso either\n&gt; the body was using to much energy or she&#39;d learn to control it. He \nwaited\n&gt; anxiously for her to complete her transformation. He wanted to see \nwhat\n&gt; other abilities she&#39;d contracted.\n\n\n"}}
