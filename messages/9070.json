He didn&#39;t know if it the spider \nwas poisonous, or what the venom could do to his biological parts. He \ndidn&#39;t want to take chances so he avoided eating the front. Now all \nthere was was waiting.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at him.&quot;I understand.&quot; She turned and walked off.
