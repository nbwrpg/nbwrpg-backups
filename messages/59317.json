She knew her friends were in there. She \nopened her comlink to the maximal base again. &quot;OK guys, that&#39;s it. If \nyou won&#39;t let me in, then I&#39;ll get in. But gee, this is no way to \ntreat a girl on your side.&quot;  She grinned a bit. She thought \nallowed, &quot;Wonder if they are trying to get me back for switching the \nliquid energon in the mess hall to the low grade industrial emergon \nthat is barely tolerable.&quot;  She chuckled and started to walk to the \nmaximal base.  Her signal would register as as maximal. She walked up \nto the front door and looked around. &quot;Hmm, seems to be a few more \nblaster marks on the front side than I remember.&quot;  She started to \nsniff around. &quot;What is this? New scents? Not predacon. But it&#39;s not \nwhat I&#39;m used to. OK, what&#39; is going on here?&quot;  She walked around the \nfront doors of the base sniffing the ground and trying to figure out \nwhat had happened to her. &quot;THis looks like the place, even the sounds \naround here are right. Yet nothing here smells like it should. \nSomething is very, very wrong.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
