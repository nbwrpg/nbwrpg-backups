You and I will \nwork on taking that shield down!

Five seconds pass before \nthe weapon is ready, then with a thunderous roar a ball of \nconcentrated energy erupts from the barrel and explodes against the \nshields.  What with all the other weapons fire hitting that target, \nthe Maximal base isn&#39;t likely to HAVE shields anymore by he time \nGatara&#39;s strongest weapon recharges - a good five minutes down the \nroad.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras and the Predacons fire strikes the shields of the might \nMaximal base. Although the shield could be brought down, they stood \nstrong for now.\n\n\n"}}
