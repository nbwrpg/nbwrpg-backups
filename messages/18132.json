The shockwave of the missiles had almost made him lose his balance in \nthe air and crash.\n\nBut he was able to stay up.  Reaching into subspace, he pulled out two \ngrenades, one for each hand.  He dropped both grenades down at Sharpedge, \nboth explosives set to go off on impact.\n\n---\n\nDark One got a target lock on Diskus, but saw that Nemesis Enforcer was \nnearly beaten in his current situation.  Jetstorm (Dark One doesn&#39;t know who \nhe is though) looked like a formidable opponent though.  Changing his course, \nhe fired twenty-five rapid laser blasts off at Jestorm&#39;s back.\n\nThe black jet fighter continued with on course, his missile launchers arming.\n\n------\n\nShockwave stepped out of the forest, looking at the battle and carnage.  Even \nif he could&#39;ve smiled, he wouldn&#39;t have.  His white right hand transformed \ninto a long barrel.  The &#39;Decepticon&#39; looked around for a target, Alliance or \notherwise.\n\n"}}
