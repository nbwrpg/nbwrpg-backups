She began to run to the Ark, hopping over bots,\nbushes and anything else in her way, she stopped at\nthe Ark&#39;s door. Then entered. She glanced back, and\nseeing Iron in shambles, and Prowl carrying her back\nto the base, she almost passed-out herself. She had\nnot even left her 3 minutes ago and she was already\nhurt. She sighed and called Snow Tech on the\ncom-link.*\n\n &quot; Yo Bro, Iron&#39;s hurt and has ordered us NOT to fire\non the Alliance, so get your skip-plate back to the\nArk so we can re-group and get our stuff, O.K.?&quot;\n\n * She then waited for Snow Tech to come-back. Hoping\nthat he was not seriously injured.*\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo! Messenger.\nhttp://im.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
