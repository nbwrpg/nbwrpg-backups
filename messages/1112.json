Tavatron unsheathed her drill sword and ran \nin front of Dinobot.\n\nShe pointed her drill sword at his chest and stared him straight in the \noptics, a look of stern determination on her face. This time she wasn&#39;t soul \nsearching, this time she meant business:\n\n&quot;We have been ordered to return to base. You are in no condition to fight! \nPrimus help me if you do, because I will slag you myself if you engage the \nalliance!&quot;\n\nTavatron had not meant to sound so harsh, but he had not risked his life to \nsave hers just to get blown away on some personnal vendetta. Tavatron \ngrowled, her eyes narrowing to slits. She didn&#39;t want to hurt him, but she \nwould if he didn&#39;t get to an &#39;R chamber right now!\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
