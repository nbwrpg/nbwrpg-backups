She held onto the she chair next to \nher with a death grip. Her nuckles were white. She had her eyes \nclosed and gritting her teeth. She spoke in a quiet but painicked \nvoice. &quot;Please...just ...get ..me ..out...of..this ..pod..please.&quot;\nShe was almost begging him.  She just had to get her feet back onto \nfirm ground.  She was a warrior, one who feared nothing, except for \nheights and flying.  She felt about an inch tall with this whole \nsituations.  She felt totally helpless while in the pod and hated \nfeeling like that.  Heights was her one and only weakness.  She was \njust glad that Striker was on her side now that he knew about her \nacraphobia. \n\n\n"}}
