If you open fire on them now, \nthey can easily be terminated; they look to be missiles, but they seem \nto be heading towards the Ark.&quot; His hatch open&#39;s slightly. &quot;We&#39;ll have \nto return to the base... take care of our trailers quickly.\n\nSwitchblade is thrown across the storage room as the shrapnel and \nplasma bombard the ship. &quot;Uhh.&quot; He growns as he gets to his feet, \n&quot;Astroblast, watch where you&#39;re going next time,&quot; he stomps back to \nhis place, grumbling about bad drivers and stuff.\n------------------\n\nOOC: Airly, Razorclaw pounced at Khonkolor again. (also, Razorclaw is \nin Lion mode right now, that&#39;s why he&#39;s pouncing) =)\n\nRazorclaw misses his pounce, and dodges left, a trail of machine gun \nfire following him. He snarls, then fakes right and rushes Khonkolor, \nhind legs pumping, and his claws outstreched. \n------------------\n\nTantrum&#39;s body lands beside Rampage, &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m gonna have to save \nyour hide as well?&quot; Rampage grabs Tantrum, and leaps into flight, a \ngrenade from Epyon exploding underneath him, and he almost drops the \nwreckage he&#39;s carrying.\n------------------\n\nDivebomb has returned to the CF battle, and is in flight a ways above \nthe base. &quot;BOMBS AWAY, haha haaaa,&quot; he launches two large bombs at the \nCF.\n\n\n\n"}}
