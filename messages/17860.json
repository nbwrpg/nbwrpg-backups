He just hauled of and hit me for no reason. Huh, I \nshould have let him stayed tied up.&quot;  She landed a few miles away \nfrom the allience base, just at the boarder of thier scanners.  She \nlanded in a tree and rubbed the side of her face.  It stung and \nburned slightly. &quot;He&#39;s so high and mighty,he&#39;s such a creep. Just hit \na bot for no reason. And that ladyhawk feather head,royalty huh? They \ncan all go to the pit. I&#39;m tired of being pushed around. So I&#39;m not \nroyalty. So I&#39;m not some special big hot shot from the outer limits \nor something.&quot;  SHe turned her head back towards the direction of the \nalliance base and stuck her tongue out. &quot;FFFBBBBRRRTTT. To the \ndarkest corner of the pit with you. Who needs you anyway. I don&#39;t.&quot; \nshe lightly touches the mark on the side of her face. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure \nI repay you for this.&quot;  She sat in the tree. Not realizing she was \nstill in the scanner range, she hung upside down in the high branches \nof the tree.  Her wings wrapped around her and tried to conseal \nherself in the shadow.  &quot;Yeah, who needs them anyway.&quot; She kept an \neye out for passing bots, but would remain quiet. She was too mad to \nthink correctly and decided to try to calm down before doing anything \nelse. \n\n\n"}}
