She was continuing to fight\n&gt; BrightBlade and he knew that she was to busy to bother with the invading\n&gt; enemies right now...so it was up to him.\n&gt; Dinobot wiped the mech fluid from his face and walked towards the Ark, on\n&gt; his way by he retrieved his rifle and reloaded it. It just might come in\n&gt; handy.*\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3020/7/_/_/_/957050569/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
