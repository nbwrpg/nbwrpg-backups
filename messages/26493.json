The lights flicker once, then \nbecome a dull glow. She sighed, this was going to be fun. She sat beside the \nmain console and tried a few keys. Everything sparked, including the keys \nshe touched:\n\n&quot;You said it.&quot;\n\nShe turned to Firearm as she spoke, shaking her hand as a little smoke rose \nfrom it. That was the second time this ship had shocked her. She groaned and \nwent to sit beside one of the active consoles. A sketchy image of the CF&#39;s \ncurrent status appeared before her. This was going to take forever. The \nvoice that boomed over her comm, however, snapped her out of whatever state \nshe just happened to be in. Optimus was back? The Neo Beast Wars had just \ngotten a little more interesting.\n\n*****\n\nTavatron:\n\nThe voice that had been speaking to her grew silent, only to be replaced by \nanother. Optimus was alive? Tavatron stopped walking and gazed across the \nopen plain. This was something she hadn&#39;t expected. Perhaps that was the \ndisturbance she had sensed:\n\n*Guess again wolf.*\n\nThe voice was back, and seemed to have no intention of giving her any peace. \nA hundred melancholy and then destructive emotions stormed her senses. If \nshe could, she would have ripped her own spark from her chest just to shut \nit up:\n\n*Come now, that&#39;s no way to greet an old friend.*\n\nTavatron growled beneath her breath, Dinobot&#39;s current predicament catching \nher attention a few yards away. She smiled to herself, of all the &#39;bots the \ncreature had chose to land on... she couldn&#39;t help but chuckle softly. It \nwas a rather amusing site:\n\n*Ah, so THAT&#39;s him. Not much of a warrior if you ask me.*\n\nWhat little remained of Tavatron&#39;s patience vanished two seconds after the \nvoice had begun speaking about Dinobot. How could *she* know about him?! It \nwas impossible, even if *she* had been laying dormant all these years--\n\n&quot;I said shut-up.&quot;\n\nTo any &#39;bot within hearing distance she may have started sounding a little \ncrazy, but Tavatron didn&#39;t care about that right now. The voice in her head, \ngiven enough time, would drive her crazy if she didn&#39;t shut it up soon. \nTavatron walked toward Dinobot, ignoring the voice as it rambled on about \nsome long forgotten military protocols. Dinobot wasn&#39;t coming inside, well, \nher injuries could wait. She wanted to see where he was going:\n\n[To DB] &quot;Calm down, or it will just hold on tighter.&quot;\n\n*Ha, you&#39;ve always had the worst taste in friends.*\n\nTavatron ignored the voice as she tried to remove the small furry creature \nfrom Dinobot&#39;s head.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
