Pyro went into robot mode, not beast mode. He ain&#39;t got no beast mode.\n2. I&#39;ve had Scavanger and Breakdown mixed up all along! Scavanger is the \nHUMVEE, so I think it&#39;d be best to just say that Scavanger and Breakdown have \nbeen their proper selves all along (Scavanger being the HUMVEE).\n\nSorry about the inconvenience, but I&#39;m kinda writing an essay while posting, \nso I can&#39;t really concentrate too well.\n\n"}}
