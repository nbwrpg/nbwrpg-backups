As\nfor the mixup, it&#39;s all good- i recon we play it off\nwith ur characters as initially dismissing the sight\nof him as an halucination til he actually called out\nto Rattrap. Still, if you wanna take it from when\nRattrap is with Camoflage, maybe have one of the\ncharacters sense something and turn around (possibly\nBA as she&#39;d be ther most likely candidate), because\nShadowcaster has already called out to Rattrap once,\nand he&#39;s the sort of patient bot who&#39;ll wait as long\nas he has to to get a reply :).\n\n --- Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@...&gt; wrote: &gt;\nHow about you have Shadowcaster come up to my\n&gt; characters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tankor &lt;lordofdarkness11001@...&gt; wrote:Sorry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Polar Claw &lt;cycodrone@...&gt; wrote: Are you\n&gt; reading halfthe OOC posts I&#39;ve sent giving you\n&gt; vital info cause somehow i doubt it. I mean\n&gt; Rattrap&#39;s\n&gt; father who stands about 30&#39; tall and looks exactly\n&gt; how\n&gt; he did when he was alive before and in the same area\n&gt; as Nightlight, yet you totally had him ignore\n&gt; Shadowcaster. The same applies to your other BW\n&gt; characters who fought alongside Shadowcaster and\n&gt; should clearly remember him dying valiantly while\n&gt; disabling the Nemesis.
