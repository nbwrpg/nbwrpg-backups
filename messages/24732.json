Is he STILL in your back panel? I can&#39;t remember&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;* The little black piff that shot out into the un-known, came screaming down to earth. It&#39;s little red bat-wings flaping desprately as it plumeted. His her flying behind him and his gums showing due to the force of the wind against his mouth. He reached the sound barrier and accelarated fast, heading straight for an un-suspecting victims head....*&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;* Shadow Cat put down Snow Tech in a small clearing of trees. She then fluttred down to terra-firma herself, folding her wings as she did so. She then turned to Snow Tech, who was looking at himself in a puddle. His fur (all that was left) was matted and tightly curled to his body. She began to giggle. She couldn&#39;t help it. He looked so stupid! Snow Tech looked up at her and frowned. He then stuck up his nose and turned his back on his sister, giving her a perfect view of his feather-less wings. She cracked, and was soon rolling on the ground. She managed to breath after a few minites and looked up, only to start again when she saw him. She finally got ahold of herself enough for her to choke out a small sentance.*&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&quot; I.. Wish.... Iron Raptor...was here..to..injoy this!&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;* She then layed back&nbsp; and stared at the canopy of trees, then to Snow Tech, who was trying to un-curl his left-over, baked fur. It didn&#39;t make him look any better and caused Shadow Cat to start laughing again. Snow Tech looked at his sister and open his mouth*&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&quot; Shad, You are such a...&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;* Thats as far as he got. The little black cat had broken the sound barrier and had snuck up on him. The little kitten shot into the trees, rustling and breaking off branches as he went, and hit Snow Tech on the head, making him fly across the clearing and into some bushes. The little piff rebounded off his head and into the un-known again, leaving Snow Tech speaking gibberish and Shadow Cat grabbing her gut, trying to breath.*&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
