Some data came \non on the screen, and in a few seconds she had the profiles of the \nPredacon team members of the original crew under Megatron&#39;s control \nscrolling across the monitor. Pics of Megatron, Scorponok, \nWaspinator, Tarantulus, Terrorsaur, and Dinobot all scrolled through \nthe screen, all of them standing in robot mode.\n\n&quot;Any of these look familiar?&quot; she asks, looking over at Vlad.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ( Carnage: I am sorry for intruding into your conversation then, \nAlloran. My bad. And yes, FireFox, Megaraptor is the most recent \nspecies of raptor found and is indeed much larger then Utahraptor. \nHowever, it was not 1996 it was discovered. I believe it was 1998. \nHowever, I may be mistaken so I draw an even and place the theory \nthat it was somwhere from 1996-1998.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ** Vlad was pleased with himself for being cunning enough to get \nthis woman&#39;s trust on his side, even though he had no intentions to \nbetray that trust. But also wondering if she had guessed that he was \na Predacon yet, thus, the enemy. However, his mission was to learn as \nmuch about Von as possible in order to defeat him, not step over \npeople who assist him in that quest.\n&gt; He stood by as Fenox smiles sweetly at the comment he had passed \nmoment&#39;s before and took his arm which he had offered to her, \nbeginning to walk with her in tow towards a information station with \nwhich he could finally upload data on his missing brother. Data he \ncould use to crush Von and take the family estate for himself. Which \nwas a sweet thought.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t long before Vlad had walked uop to the computer, looking \nit over and deciding that it would be best that this woman handle the \ninformation gather and not himself, since it wouldn&#39;t be wise to ever \nlet a stranger near to find something that the faction would be \nbetter off keeping secret.  Thusm Vlad gestured to the board with his \nfree hand.** &quot; After you, my lady.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
