She looked from toes to head. He had an \n&gt; impressive male form. She looke down at the little red bot next to \n&gt; her. She noticed that these were the two bots in the forest she had \n&gt; seen. She lowered her head and looked thoughtful for a moment. How as \n&gt; she watched them, for a moment, she wanted to join them. Perhaps even \n&gt; play with them. Her face plates showed longing and dispair. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang had been knocked backwards and stood up on his elbow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: We didn&#39;t because you were gravely wounded and because \n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; of your comrades decided that we could do the job to fix you up.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why you&#39;re here and you&#39;re still yourself.\n\n\n"}}
