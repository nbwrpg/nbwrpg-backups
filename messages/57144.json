I haven&#39;t explained everything. I am known as\n&gt; &gt; Protoform Z, but my name is AzureBlade. I can feel things through my\n&gt; &gt; spark, things like other sparks. I felt you were wounded, so I came to\n&gt; &gt; offer my help. If you do not wish it, I will go. As for him... (He\n&gt; &gt; pointed at Scourge) I have never seen him and I do not know him.\n&gt; \n&gt; She only stood there, watching Azureblade.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He rose from the ground and walked toward Scourge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics followed Azureblade....\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: Easy now! Relax and try to focus on your internal repairs.\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re wounded too. (Turning to Maxima) Would this happen to be some\n&gt; &gt; kind of haven for the injured?\n&gt; \n&gt; This started her pondering as well. &quot;Indeed. These waters have an\nenergy to \n&gt; them to revitalize & repair.&quot; She turned to the 2, her old\npersonality was \n&gt; starting to show through now from teh innocent confusion she had\nbefore. &quot;For \n&gt; this, neither of you should speak of this place. If you cannot keep\nit a secret, \n&gt; then you shall remain here or be terminated.&quot; Her crimson optics\nglared at them \n&gt; both. &quot;Do I make myself clear?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; The powers of the waters was showing with her form repairing itself,\ndouble \n&gt; the speed as with the normal repair system. It was like the CR\nChambers but \n&gt; slightly better. \n&gt; \n&gt; Standing there before them, the waterfall behind her, her form\nshimmering \n&gt; from the energy water & the sun, her crimson optics glowing at the 2\nmale bots.\n\n\n"}}
