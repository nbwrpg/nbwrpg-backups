A huge piece of dead flesh, \npossibly a carcass, protouded out of his huge Dragon mouth. He had jagged \nsilver teeth, wand two huge black wings, shadowing over the tank turret.  Two \nice blue eyes were at the top of the head, with a pair of devilish horns \nprotrouding from the side of his head. He raised himself up and let out an \nearth-shattering roar, dropping the carcass into the water again. \n\nHe staggered for about a kilometer and then transformed into a silver and \nblack tank, the turret forming as his &#39;head. The only Dragon part of him left \nof him was his jet black wings. \n\n&quot;I am back,&quot; He growled to himself.\nHe studied the surroundings on all sides of him. He noticed a four legged \nmobile creature, with horns and small tail. He suddendly Transformed into a \nDragon and ate the horned creature, with utter content. He laughed to himself \nand then walked darker into the deep wooded area.\n\n"}}
