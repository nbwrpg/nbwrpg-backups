I was just RPGing the char and didn&#39;t \n&gt; think anything of it at the time. But, I would like to say &quot;I&#39;m \n&gt; Sorry&quot; to those who didn&#39;t appreciate that type of post. I&#39;ll not \n&gt; post like that in the future.  Thank you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Logo.\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.  \n&gt; I shall be leaving the RPG once again. And this time, I can not say \n&gt; that I&#39;ll be back.  I can be reached through my email, but I can not \n&gt; post in the RPG for a while. Due to personal circumstanses, I must \n&gt; leave.  I do beg forgiveness from the RPGers in the group and I hope \n&gt; that one day you will all forgive me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the list of the personel that will recieve my chars. \n&gt; Yanshosh:: Squizzy, GoldenEye, DarkMouse,KitKat3\n&gt; \n&gt; Alloran2: Battera, Diamond\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000: Trinity\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf: Ice\n&gt; \n&gt; tmrattrap: Feline \n&gt; \n&gt; roborick007: KitKat2\n&gt; \n&gt; Please feel free to change or do what ever with them.  I give these \n&gt; chars to you.  If I am ever able to return, I shall develope new \n&gt; chars and play them.  This won&#39;t be effective untill Wednesday or \n&gt; Thursday of this week. But I felt that I should forwarn everyone.  \nIt \n&gt; has been an honor RPGing with all of you. I thank you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lo\n\n\n"}}
