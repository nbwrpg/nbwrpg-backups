I know nobody will mis=\r\ns me, probably, because nobody ever really liked my posts. So, like Alloran=\r\n, and Zardus, and Jer, and Lurker, and many other greats before me, I&#39;m ret=\r\niring. Sorry it had to come to this. Let&#39;s see here, what should I say in m=\r\ny speech? Well, here it comes.\n\nFirst of all, thank you Alloran. You were w=\r\nhat kept me in NBW over the times, and all, and you were always fair to me =\r\nand even became my friend when I yelled out a horrible &quot;SCREW YOU!&quot; Which w=\r\nas just wrong of me, it really was. Alloran, I treasured the times we used =\r\nto make fun of Liono and the things we used to say about JP! Oh, man! I had=\r\n fun, true fun.\n\nLurker, you are one of my greatest friends, too. At first =\r\nI didn&#39;t understand you, but then I realized that we were so much alike tha=\r\nt we were meant to be friends. It&#39;s a twist of fate.\n\nJer, you da man! Ther=\r\ne, in your own words, even, Jer. You sure did make me feel bad for not talk=\r\ning to you in a while when you put me at the top of your mail. Well, you ar=\r\ne one of the ELITE man. Seriously. It&#39;s great to be your friend. JUME!!!!\n\n=\r\nJeff, you were one of the greatest moderators this RPG has ever seen. Your =\r\nbrand of fairness and punishment is unrivaled by any of the voted on Modera=\r\ntors. You were also a good friend, and I also had fun talking with you.\n\nRo=\r\nboRick, you are similar to me in several ways. Except your RPGing skills we=\r\nre never as crappy as mine started out as. HAW! But really, it&#39;s fun talkin=\r\ng to you and if you win your bid for Council Member, well, congratulations,=\r\n you deserve it. You are a good RPGer, and I hope that you have fun while I=\r\n&#39;m gone.\n\nZardus, you, I&#39;ve had a very unusual relationship with. I first r=\r\neally met you when you called me an idiot for having Sinesis sweep up  your=\r\n guy, who was it? I can&#39;t remember now, but the point is, that we soon beca=\r\nme friends. If it was not for Zardus, I would never be the RPGer I am today=\r\n, he showed me the way to do things, and I&#39;ll never go back to the ALL CAPS=\r\n NO SPACES NO PARAGRAPHS NO SENSE guy I was before. I mean, I could only th=\r\nink about myself until I received the ultimate tutor in Zardus. Besides tha=\r\nt, Zardus was always fair to me, helping me out when I had problems with ot=\r\nher RPGers.\n\nCyberwolf, Airly, you 2 are cool with me. Cyberwolf takes the =\r\nRPG very seriously, and is a great RPGer. Airly, you&#39;ve been great, a good =\r\nfriend. I&#39;m sure the 2 of you can keep NBW alive in the future.\n\nLogo: I do=\r\nn&#39;t really know what to say, besides that you were a great friend. I&#39;m sorr=\r\ny I never got one of my characters in a relationship with one of yours. Tru=\r\nly.\n\nFinally, Minime_316. Thanks. RIP my friend.\n\nWell, I guess that&#39;s it. =\r\nAnyone who wishes to keep in contact with me can e-mail me at my god awful =\r\ne-mail address, thecode@... Now, for a list!
