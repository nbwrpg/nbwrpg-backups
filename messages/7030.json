Knowing he \ncan smell the crow, she still wanted to help him.  She hoped that she \ncould help him with his optics.  She felt bad because she felt \nsomewhat to blame for his injury. She was still a little mad at him \nfor what he said about leaving the fighting to fighters. \nRight now, she just wanted to make a mends with him and hope that he \nwould except the peace offering.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a nice big crow I managed to catch.  Have dinner and we can \nhead back to the base.&quot;  She smiled, &quot;or we can stay out here and \nhang out under the stars tonight.  I don&#39;t mind either way.&quot;\nShe was glad he was still alive.  She felt a smile in her spark when \nshe looked at him.  He was a strong, couragous fighter, who cared for \nhis friends.  She was believing her spark was really falling for \nhim.  She asked herself, how else could a bot get such strong \nreactions out of her is she didn&#39;t care for them.\n\n\n\n"}}
