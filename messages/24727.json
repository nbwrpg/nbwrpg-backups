It \ncan be bad for your health!&quot;\n\n* She called to him in a light hearted tone, but keeping her guns aimed \ntowards him.\nBut her mind wasn&#39;t only on him, sje was also keeping a watchful scanner on \nNemisis above her.\nShe didn&#39;t trust just leaving a bot like that to make up whatever attack he \nwas going to do. But at the moment both him and Scattershot were fairly far \nappart and she couldn&#39;t attack both at once.\nSo while she delt with one it gave the other time to think and act out an \nattack.\nWhich was none to her banifit.\nIron Raptor snapped her head towards Nemisis Enforcer as he fired at her, \nknowing that she couldn&#39;t avoide all the shots he fired at her.\nSo she did the next best thing: retrecting the guns back into place she \nquickly armed herself with her shield and braced herself, hearing the \ncharges hit heavily and nearly knock herself off her feet.\nThe insignea on the shield glowed as it took in the energy from the blasts.\nSoon the sword would be powered again and she might have a chance to finish \nNemisis.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
