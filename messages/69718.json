I=\r\nf - you had not guarded the - Ark, all would - have been lost. I - thank yo=\r\nu deeply for your\n&gt; loyalty, and - constant vigil over the Autobot vessel. =\r\nOnce I - figure out how to revive my comrades, I - will be sure they know o=\r\nf your valliant efforts to - protect what is most precious to us. R - Rat T=\r\nap. You too, have - shown bravery in your actions. I owe you as much, if no=\r\nt more of my loyalty to you. without - your help, I would not have gotten o=\r\nut of that fortress.&quot;\n\nLord elder looked almost embarrassed as Tuscon thank=\r\ned him. &quot;I only\ndid what any Maximal would do for a comrade in arms.&quot; he sa=\r\nid, a small\nsmile appearing on his face. &quot;But before you thank me, let&#39;s ge=\r\nt you\nhome first.&quot;\n\nWith a burst of power from the engines, flames burst fr=\r\nom the VTOL\nboosters and and lifted them off the ground. As they rose the s=\r\nhuttle\nshook as the craft complained about damage from the rather rough\nlan=\r\nding. However the shuttle quickly leveled out as Lord Elder turned\nthe ship=\r\n and put them on course back towards the Ark.\n\n&gt; &quot;Not - at all. Lord Elder,=\r\n I - have one favor to ask you. I&#39;d - like to pay my respects to Optimus - =\r\nPrime once we arrive at the Ark. Do - I have permission to enter the Ark to=\r\n do so?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course Tuscon, we will all be entering the Ark.&quot; Elder said f=\r\nrom\nhis seat, his voice somewhat distracted, &quot;But make sure that you don&#39;t\n=\r\ndisturb anything. It is very important that we leave everything as we\nfind =\r\nit.&quot;\n\nThe shuttle rumbled a bit as the engines sputtered and ignited again,=\r\n\n&quot;That is if we make it back.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Lord Elder)\n\n"}}
