So we&#39;ve got two separate groups of intruders inside \nand at \n&gt; least one group outside?  I wouldn&#39;t worry about the ones outside \nunless \n&gt; they&#39;re a serious threat to the base.  Of the two inside, I suggest \npinning \n&gt; the one with the virus at a corner with bots in both halls.  The \nother \n&gt; group... hmm... the same tactic would work unless they&#39;re fast.  In \nwhich \n&gt; case the best place would be a long hallway.  They could get up to \nhigh \n&gt; speeds but there&#39;s no maneuverability at those speeds.  All it \nwould take is \n&gt; a slight kick or shot and they&#39;d lose their balance and get \nseriously \n&gt; injured.  So how many bots do we have to take on these intruders?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
