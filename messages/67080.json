He=\r\n sent also some coordinates close to his base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Deep under the earth, in=\r\n a cavern a small shelter of a\n&gt; room sits. The room looks like it may have=\r\n at one time\n&gt; been a workshop of sorts, but now it is a ruined mess.\n&gt; Com=\r\nputers that have been apparently dead for millennia\n&gt; upon millennia and ha=\r\nlf built machines line the\n&gt; rough-hewn stonewalls. Nothing moves here, not=\r\n\n&gt; insects, rodents or even air. \n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly the room begins to shake, a=\r\ns somewhere in the\n&gt; distance an earthquake makes itself felt! Walls shake\n=\r\n&gt; and stones fall; dust for the first time in many years\n&gt; is thrown into t=\r\nhe air. Walls crack and shatter as a\n&gt; crevice opens up, and somehow, from =\r\nnearly a mile up\n&gt; light streams into the room, the light shimmers, the\n&gt; w=\r\nalls again rumble for a few minutes and then water\n&gt; splashes into the cham=\r\nber and quickly fills it!\n&gt; \n&gt; The water entering the room washes away year=\r\ns of dust,\n&gt; rock and layers debris, revealing a stasis pod. Inside\n&gt; a for=\r\nm can be seen, dormant, as if waiting for\n&gt; something and yet so far nothin=\r\ng has come. But with\n&gt; the water comes silt, stone and salt, and and sparks=\r\n\n&gt; flash out, and circuits that&#39;s have been long separate\n&gt; by mere inches =\r\nare now connected and the pod flickers\n&gt; once ... twice ... and then comes =\r\nonline. \n&gt; \n&gt;      From the top of the lamps come on and light fill\n&gt; the r=\r\noom with a murky glow. Inside the pod coded\n&gt; instructions file across smal=\r\nl screens. Images of\n&gt; animals appear: an avian, a bovine, and a large jung=\r\nle\n&gt; cat, and the last almost forms an animal, but as if\n&gt; due to some bit =\r\nof damage it becomes a star fighter,\n&gt; resetting to some default mode. Inte=\r\nrior programming\n&gt; of the pod continues processing information and\n&gt; pourin=\r\ng it into the form as the machine shocks the\n&gt; occupant and begins to awake=\r\nn the 6-changer it has\n&gt; stored inside. Its forms are modified to fit the\n&gt;=\r\n programming specifications: Shark, Eagle, Auroch\n&gt; (large bull), Lion and =\r\nstar-fighter, all of them\n&gt; varying hues of dark purple and black. The comp=\r\nuter\n&gt; switches off, and the interior of the stasis chamber\n&gt; goes dark. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; A few moments pass, and then the door to the stasis\n&gt; bubbles and opens=\r\n, and what appears to be a large\n&gt; black shark swims out of the chamber, mo=\r\nves swiftly\n&gt; through the open crevice and swiftly rises to the\n&gt; surface. =\r\nBreaking into the air it shifts into the form\n&gt; of a star fighter and hover=\r\ns for a moment as if\n&gt; looking around, The world it sees is strange and new=\r\n,\n&gt; its like a babe seeing the world for the first time.\n&gt; The ship banks a=\r\nround the rather large lake that this\n&gt; creature has risen from and notes s=\r\ntructures of\n&gt; habitation in the distance. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Megatron.&quot; A deep reverbe=\r\nrous voice speaks across\n&gt; encrypted and yet ancient (Last season of BW) Pr=\r\nedecon\n&gt; channels. &quot;It is time that I begin my duties.
