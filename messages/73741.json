He could see the statue not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; too far off and the trail that led between the town and the cave and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the town and the mine entrance to the cave.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From the cave there was the sounds of dim laser fire, it came out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sounding somewhat like aggressive crickets as things went back and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; forth!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There was a vague sense of PREDACON in the area but nothing specific,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps they were in hiding, waiting for the nest moment of attack.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Deep behind a small hill, out of optical sight of TUCSON and the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; others the PREDACONS were watching, crouching silently. The humans\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that DINOBOT shot at had frozen, apparently in fight, that is until\n&gt;&gt; &gt; they looked up at the hovering form of TUCSON in the air.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; They smiled.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Covered by underbrush and foliage, they could see him, but they were,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at the moment, still hidden from view. However it was obvious they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were planning something,.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Suddenly there was a strange sort of &#39;THUD&#39;, then some sort of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; explosion errupted and the cave and tunnel collapsed bringing tons of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rock towards RAT TRAP and PERCEPTOR as they struggled to get out of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the cave!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There was nothing from RODIMUS!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There was a manical grin from DINOBOT then, &quot;Rocks fall, everyMaximal\n&gt;&gt; dies.  Come, we must complete the rest of our mission now while they are\n&gt;&gt; suitably distracted.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which was to secure a perimeter and then setup the sensor units for\n&gt;&gt; reinforcements to arrive.  Now with the MAXIMALS at the nearby ARK\n&gt;&gt; hopefully further distracted, they could accomplish this without further\n&gt;&gt; issue then as DINOBOT&#39;s optics flickered then, signalling to the\n&gt;&gt; TERRORCONS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even better, the protohumans had scattered now, so they would hvae no\n&gt;&gt; issues hopefully wtih them acting as runners to alert the MAXIMALS to\n&gt;&gt; their positioning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
