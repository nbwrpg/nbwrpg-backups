Quickly the ship unleashed a blast from the Vile cannon at the \ntrainers base shields, the blast just as big as it was the first time \nit was used. It then locked onto the Infecticon ship and fired all \nfour multi phase laser cannon blasts that were about to blow under the \nstrain of the charging. The infecticon ship is hit bythe blasts as the \nlasers pierce its shields, a moment later it fires back at the \nViolator with one of its massive cannons making on of the thrusters \nexplode outward. Inside Vile and the others fell over from the blast. \nVile then stood and set a course for Antartica.\n\nVile: &quot;With any luck the Infecticon ship wont pursue...&quot;\n\nThe violator then began to fly away from the trainer base. As this \nhappened the weapons fire that was fired at the Infecticon base were \nstopped by its shield that for the most part was invisible. The ship \nbegan to reposistion itself and once again it fired down the column of \nlight at incarcinator, the 8 rings following down to surround him. As \nthis happens 4 massive cannons along the edges of the ship begin to \naim at the trainer base before each fires a massive blast at the base, \neach blast would go through the shields even with the variable \nshielding.(Heh this is a tech on the Infecticon ship, the eight main \ncannons on the ship are able to pass through all shields no matter \nwhat since they absorb the shields energy into the blast to create a \nhole in them. Yan has the bio and alloran already knows of this so... \nshielding for the trainer base is useless since these blasts are not \nlike anything anyone has seen before. Whee not like they&#39;ll matter \nmuch longer since this ship is going to crash into the ocean in a bit) \nAs this happens two blasts from within the ships metallic ring like \nstructure fly down at Slyaer as another two fire down at starscream, \nanother 4 at the Trainers base shields, these blasts would not \npenetrate the shields since they were from other weapons.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; #1 OK, the way the post was set up it sounded like the six photon \ntorpedos\n&gt; and the two megas were coming from the same weapon.\n&gt; \n&gt; #5 Transporter technology should still be considered as a form of\n&gt; teleportation because it gives one side an unfair advantage, \nespecially when\n&gt; it can be broadcast into a base like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways\n&gt; \n&gt; The shields adapt as they were designed to to deflect the multphase \nweaponry\n&gt; and the laser cannons. The Photon torpedos detonated on impact \nshaking the\n&gt; base, Ignatius was nearly paniced by the nightmares and the shaking \nbase. He\n&gt; rushed over to the computer, &quot;Redirect all eccess shield energy into \nthe\n&gt; repulsor shields, direct it at that ship.&quot; His orders would leave \nthe base\n&gt; as a potential target for the Predacons if that much energy was \nexpended.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think so Ig!&quot; a voice called out over the speakers of the \nbase.\n&gt; &quot;That would be a major tactical mistake..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The voice was familiar to the insane Trainer, it was one he hadn&#39;t \nheard in\n&gt; ages, since it had ceased on the planet Hydrus 4. The fifth member \nof\n&gt; Prebons old unit  was in the computer. Prebon must have downloaded \nhis spark\n&gt; into the computer before they&#39;d left. &quot;I&#39;m taking over from here.&quot; \nhe said\n&gt; scanning the situation. Ignatius tried to override the computer but \nwas met\n&gt; with unexpected force. The Stasis field changed frequency, it now \nheld\n&gt; Ignatius trapped with the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Repulsor shields let out a wave drawing energy from the very \ntorpedos\n&gt; that were trying to destroy it. the explosion  shook the trainer \nbase even\n&gt; more,  disabling the repulsor array. Now the Autoguns and variable \nfreq\n&gt; shield were thier only defenses left. Autoguns continued fireing at \nthe\n&gt; Violator. They had trouble locking on target so they couldn&#39;t aim \nfor\n&gt; anything critical. The only thing they could do was aim for where \nthe\n&gt; weapons fire was comeing from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other weapons struck the shields. Two autoguns turned and fired \nthree shots\n&gt; each three at Starscream and three at Incarcinator\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Legendarynemasis@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 06, 2001 10:47 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a few serious questions/comments concerning this post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #1- isn&#39;t it illegal to fire eight missles/ procectiles from 1\n&gt; &gt; weapon?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #2- Cyanide is in a Stasis field so he wouldn&#39;t be able to \nscream\n&gt; &gt; anything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #3 Theres already 1 seemingly indestructable ship in the battle, \nis\n&gt; &gt; it legal to bring in a second?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #4- The Trainer base has it&#39;s shields up so how could you \nteleport\n&gt; &gt; anything through them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #5- I thought Teleportation was outlawed because of the abuse of\n&gt; &gt; power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; #6- can I intercept the extra missles to lower the firepower \ndown to\n&gt; &gt; legal standards?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #1 theres 8 laser cannons on the violator. Therefore 8 singular \nblasts\n&gt; &gt; are legal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #2 Ill change that\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #3 both ships are going down soon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #4 Its a beam of light it goes through the shield like sunlight \ndoes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; #5 Its not teleportation its an advanced transport system.

A door opened below the ship \nand\n&gt; &gt; the scorpion\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   tank quickly entered as did Gemini 1 and two. Vile turns to \nGemini\n&gt; &gt; 1 and 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   and growls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Cyanide may be caught but now these fools will all be\n&gt; &gt; destroyed!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Goodbye Cyanide you haved risked yourself for us all.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   And with that Vile opened a small compartment at his control\n&gt; &gt; console and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   pressed it. Immeidately two Mega photon torpedoes, six photon\n&gt; &gt; torpedoes, four\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   laser cannons, the four multi phase laser cannons, and both \nmega\n&gt; &gt; cannons,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   shooting 3 shots each opened fire on the triaer base followed \nby a\n&gt; &gt; massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   blast fired at the base from the Vile cannon. As this happened\n&gt; &gt; Vile shook his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   head and began to walk away when the Violator was hammered by \n8\n&gt; &gt; massive\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   blasts causing the ship to shake violently and throw Vile and\n&gt; &gt; Methos from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   where they were standing. Vile then got up and growls as \nGemini 2\n&gt; &gt; rushed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   his console and brought up a visual of a massive portal, with \nan\n&gt; &gt; infecticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ship exiting it and hovering over the trainer base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Vile: &quot;Infecticons... prepare to open fire on that ship with\n&gt; &gt; everything we\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   have.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   On the Infecticon ship two black beings seemingly made of \nenergy\n&gt; &gt; look at two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   orbs in front of them, one displaying Predacon and X-Predacon\n&gt; &gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   signatures as well as some unknown types. One orb begins to \nglow\n&gt; &gt; as in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   center of the large dark control room a bright circle of light\n&gt; &gt; appears. As\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   this happens, a column of light shines striaght down and into \nthe\n&gt; &gt; trainer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   base(dont worry this isnt an attack) and engulfs cyanide,  who\n&gt; &gt; immediately\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   goes into a panick.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Cyanide: &quot;No they&#39;re here! Help! Help!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   As cyanide screams 8 rings appear around him before he himself\n&gt; &gt; turns into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   being of light. Soon he dissapears with the rings forming a \nsort\n&gt; &gt; of bulge in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the column which quickly speeds up the beam of light and into \nthe\n&gt; &gt; Infecticon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ship...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
