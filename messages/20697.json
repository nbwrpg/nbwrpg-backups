She felt a presance close to \nher. She opened her mind and heard the thought of Lunarpine. He was \nclose to her. She smiled. She could read in his thoughts that he \nstill cared for her. A smiled crossed her face. She sned out the \nmental message,&quot;I&#39;m over here.&quot;\nThen she slipped into sleep. The snow half covered her, but the red \npuddle was growing under her. It was ver visible, despite the falling \nsnow.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine fought his way through ice and snow to find her. Nothing \nwould\n&gt; stop him from finding her, He&#39;d travelled to far and worked to hard \nto bring\n&gt; her back to let her succome to a virus. The bloodstains in the snow \nwere\n&gt; getting larger. Her wounds had opened worse. The half wolf was \ndetermined to\n&gt; return her to Veratis&#39; base without any harm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Foxfingers flew across the sea to the country where \nthey&#39;d landed.\n&gt; He was far enough away from Predacon territory to risk a \ntransmission.\n&gt; &quot;Foxfingers to home, I&#39;m on my way back with lots of goodies.&quot; His\n&gt; hoverboard switched into high gear as he streaked across the water.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis heard the transmission and replied in kind. &quot;Where the \nunderworld\n&gt; have you been? You should have been back long ago.&quot; He hesitated to \ndeliver\n&gt; the bad news to him, Things were falling apart before his very \neyes, The\n&gt; virus was loose, Lunarpine still hadn&#39;t found Ice and Lady Hawk \nstill hadn&#39;t\n&gt; returned. The bleak news echoed through his memory like a chiming \nbell.\n&gt; Things just couldn&#39;t get much worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foxfingers slowed down when he heard the news. He remembered the \ntracking\n&gt; device on his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve accompanied me far enough Preds.&quot; \nHe flew\n&gt; low and dropped it on the icy beach. The tracking device still \nfunctioned,\n&gt; The Predacons could track him this far, and he wasn&#39;t worried about \nanything\n&gt; else.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
