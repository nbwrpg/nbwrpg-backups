Looking at \nSniper Icedemon says we come here and help you and this what you do to say \nthank you. After That he lays there silent Tritan looks at sniper not \nthinking more he runs to his friends side but he can&#39;t help. Taking those \nhits for Prowl hurt him bad. Shocker then starts to fly away after is \nsheilds started failing. Then Tritan looks at all the maximals we came to \nask for help but then we also helped to protect you base and you fire on us. \nI thought you were the good guys. Then he turns to beast mode then start to \ndrag Icedemon away. Tritan talking to prowl: Tell liono prime I need to talk \nto him.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
