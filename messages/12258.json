I&#39;ve read them, and I realized \nsomething: Today the club had more fighting and confusion than any \nother day I&#39;ve been here! KSLaw made a good point, about how we \nshouldn&#39;t be taking up space on the boad, especially fights. If \nyou&#39;ve got a problem with someone, send them a private e-mail. The \nrest of us don&#39;t need to know about it. So everybody just keep your \ncool and concentrate on the game. We&#39;re suppost to be having fun, \nremember? And I know I&#39;m not the council or anything so this is just \nmy opinion, but if you have something OOC that you really want to \nmake sure that everybody reads, than combine it with a post. That \nwasy it will take up the same amount of space.)\n\n\n\nBronco caught up with Fliq and started pounding him to the ground. \nFliq kicekd him off and looked at him with dead eyes. He fired optic \nblasts right at Bronco, knocking back. Temporairy solution, but it \nwill hold ofr now. Fliq went to Beast Mode and lunged towards Oinker.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nVulois was about to show Windrazor the room, when he heard someone \ncalling from outside.\n\n&quot;Hold on a sec. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;\n\nVulois goes outside to meet Herald and Child.\n\n&quot;Herald! Thank you for coming. Yes, it is time to train your child. \nYou may stay with us if you want. You may have a part to play in this \nyet. Come let me show you Windrazor and the embassy, and than you may \nmake your choice.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
