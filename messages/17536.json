His \ndays on this planet are numbered, as the Alliance has been aroused to \nhis treachery. He is the most hunted man on the planet, and he will \nfall!&quot; Starscream fired off two shots from each of his guns.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron ran after Wheeljack.\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\nPrebon stopped suddenly.

He hoped Spears would get the message about not \ntalking to him about their plans any more.\n\n&quot;BE QUIET! Your friends will be here soon, and I won&#39;t be able to  \ndiscuss the exchange. NO MORE TALKING! About anything!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
