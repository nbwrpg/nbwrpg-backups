Doing a very bad job at it.\nThat was SO funny!\nPerfect timing!\nCarnage finally gave up and began laughing, shaking her head and waving her \nhand at Instrat.**\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry! I...was just thinking of something funny!&quot;\n\n** Of course she wasn&#39;t about to tell Instrat that there was a squish of \npoop plumiting towards his head.\nThat would ruin the extremely funny outcome.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
