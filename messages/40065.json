I got back from visiting relatives two days ago, and I&#39;ve \n&gt; been skimming through 300 plus posts and I&#39;m still not done (my \n&gt; apologies, but I don&#39;t live on the rpg). If you really feel like \ncalling \n&gt; me an idiot, then by all means, but keep it private. That way I can \n&gt; explain to you why you should be thinking before before making \n&gt; yourself look foolish. =) I wouldn&#39;t be still RPing if i didn&#39;t \n&gt; understand transwarp tech.

Cyberwolf has given me permission to take Megaton \nback\n&gt; &gt; in time(trans-warptechnology can do that duh it was the whole \npoint of\n&gt; &gt; beast wars) so that he can attack Stallex when he was a baby and\n&gt; &gt; barely be saved by Mustex. That way in the future Mustex will \nhave a\n&gt; &gt; rivalry with Megaton, Veratis his creator, and possibly all the\n&gt; &gt; mutants. This also explains why Mustex first downloaded his \nDatatracks\n&gt; &gt; into Stallex(for a second chance if something should happen to \n&gt; him).\n\n\n"}}
