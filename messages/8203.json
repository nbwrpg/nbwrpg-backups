A small device was fastened to her armor, it \nappeared to be a claking device of some kind. Well, that explained \neverything. Still, how did it get on her waist? She didn&#39;t remember \nfastening it, much less even seeing it before now. Had Dinobot put it \nthere? If so, when? Then it dawned on her, she hadn&#39;t realized it \nbefore, most likely because she too busy being realived to see him. \nWhen she embraced him, he must have placed it on her waist. Which \nmeant he had to touch her. That explained the feeling of hands at her \nwaist, she just hadn&#39;t realized it at the time. He had even seemed a \nlittle reluctant to let go. Tavatron smiled up at him, so perhaps he \nwasn&#39;t completely emotionless after all. There may be hope for him \nyet. \n\nTavatron was about to say something when suddenly several sirens in \nthe room began to sound. She tensed for a moment before she heard \nProwl&#39;s voice telling them to move it. She activated the device, the \nair before her shimmering slightly as Prowl and Iron Raptor came into \nfocus beside what appeared to be the only exit. Tavatron turned to \nlook at Dinobot, simultaneously drawing her sword. If they had to \nfight their way out of here she wasn&#39;t going to be caught off gaurd:\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;\n\nTavatron jogged over to Prowl and Iron Raptor, catching the tail end \nof their conversation:\n\n&quot;Just do as she says, Prowl. We&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
