You&#39;re worth more to me t=\r\nhan any precious metal or power source. And, Torca&#39;s right, I - could use a=\r\n rest, but, perhaps I will get that when I undergo the repairs to my optic =\r\nsensors. Stanton, I need to ask you a favor. One that I know is extremely d=\r\nifficult to accomplish, and one that I&#39;d never ask of you unless it was a d=\r\nire need. I would like you to attempt the delicate process of bringing my o=\r\nptic sensors back online. If it doesn&#39;t work, I understand. But I saw how i=\r\nmportant it was for me to be able to see in order to get an idea of the sit=\r\nuation at hand and how to remedy it. A blind eye can only go so far. And if=\r\n at all possible, could the same be done for Perceptor? He too, deserves a =\r\nsecond chance of seeing things in a whole new light.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSanton nodded=\r\n, a smile on his face, &quot;I had assumed that you would need\nthat sooner or la=\r\nter.&quot; He walked over to Tuscon holding a sensors a\nfew inches from the side=\r\n of his heard, apparently taking reading, &quot;The\nscanners should have a prett=\r\ny good work up on you, but once we get\nthis room ready I believe we can get=\r\n your optics wokring again.&quot;\n\nBump had walked over to Rodimus and began run=\r\nning a scanner over him\nas well. &quot;Both of you are to get rest before you go=\r\n galavanting across\nthis planet again. You have both been through a lot.&quot; B=\r\nump looked at\nboth of them meaningfuly, it was apparent he was not going to=\r\n let them\nleave the base withou some recharging and true down time.\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Then my tale has to wait&quot;said dryly Perceptor.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTorca had been w=\r\natching Tuscon and Rodimus with a critical optic as if\nweighing out how muc=\r\nh they could handle, but he glanced over at\nPerceptor, &quot;No, it does not.&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe looked back at Tuscon and then Rodimus, &quot;There are so many tales.&quot;\nhe sa=\r\nid. &quot;We all have much to discuss.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; Bump said as he glanced up =\r\nfrom his scanner reading of\nRodimus, &quot;But not in the medical chamber.&quot;\n\nTor=\r\nca smiled indulgantly at Bump, &quot;Quite right.&quot; He looked over at\nTuscon and =\r\nRodimus, &quot;Shall we take this to another room?&quot;\n\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
