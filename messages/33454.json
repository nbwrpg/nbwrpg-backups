The reason I decided to put the\n&gt;poll up was because me and Alloran got to speaking, and he said\n&gt;because Bombshell was in the fore ground during the scene, he thought\n&gt;it was him. I wanted to see what you thought, but I dont know if you\n&gt;all understood the question. There was no right or wrong awnser, as\n&gt;the writers never stated who it was. The popular opinion on the\n&gt;internet was that it was Skywarp.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
