A simple \nhit against an IF wall would do more damage to the car than the wall.\n\nAnd the autoguns are firing from pretty much all directions, Havoc \nwon&#39;t be big enough to block them all.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Prodigey child&quot; &lt;icedemon101@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Angel Prime\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; he saw dec going for a round house kick so he jumped out of the \nway. [I \n&gt; don&#39;t know if this ok with you yanshosh] he grabs Havoc and uses \nhim as a \n&gt; shield. he pulled out his light gernade and threw it at decs feet. \n[a light \n&gt; gernade sends out a blinding light for about 5 seconds]. he then \ngrabs the \n&gt; pod and turns to car mode with the pod inside it and drove right \ninto the \n&gt; wall breaking threw. [if you think about a car can go threw a \nwall.] he then \n&gt; transforms and very slowly starts flying away but he is having a \nhard time \n&gt; because his back his hurt and the pod is heavy.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
