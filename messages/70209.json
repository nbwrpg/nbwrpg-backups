Legacy is going to open an escape path f=\r\nor us. But first, it&#39;s about time I won our side some pay back.&quot;\n\nRodimus s=\r\ntarted to nod, but then looked at Tuscon, his jaw dropping!\nHe did step bac=\r\nk so that he could better cover the battle scene, but\nas he glanced about t=\r\nhe odds seemed to be heavily stacked against\nthem. He shook his head, &quot;Tusc=\r\non! I cannot let you sacrifice yourself.\nIt was I who started all of this, =\r\nand it is I who needs to step in.\nThe Autobots will need you to hold everyt=\r\nhing together.&quot;\n\n&gt; He cracks his knuckles and stares coldly at Cyclonus.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot; You want to take the Autobots down, you&#39;ll have to get past me first, C=\r\nyclonus! And this time, I&#39;m not holding anything back!&quot;\n\nCyclonus smiled at=\r\n Tuscon as he turned to face him, &quot;Then it is as I\nhoped.&quot; he said, bowing =\r\nhis head slightly at the new prime, his optics\nnever leaving Tuscon&#39;s - the=\r\n gesture of one warrior to another.\n\n&gt; Night Shift reports to Legacy, Lord =\r\nElder,Rat Trap, Lord Perseus, and Quickstride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yo, Night Shift here, I=\r\n&#39;m broadcastn&#39; from Ninjabot Radio Network, you&#39;re missn&#39; some real hot ten=\r\nsion buildn&#39; up in here. I think Tucson Prime&#39;s sick of Cyclonus&#39;s scrap an=\r\nd he&#39;s lookn&#39; ta go one on one ta show &#39;em what he&#39;s really made of. I ain&#39;=\r\nt never seen &#39;em this steamed off but slag, he&#39;s got a look in his face lik=\r\ne he&#39;s itchn&#39; ta do some major damage. Maybe you&#39;ll get in here just in tim=\r\ne ta take advantage of some newly fallen spare parts.. Maybe, that&#39;s if the=\r\nre are any.&quot;\n\nLegacy&#39;s cold voice intoned over the communication grid, &quot;Ill=\r\nogical.\nThe situation that you are in is repleate with unknown variables an=\r\nd\npermutations. To deduce a victory with such an unstable set of\nparameters=\r\n illogical and extremely dangerous.&quot;  Legacy paused as the\nsounds of explos=\r\nions could be heard in the background, &quot;I will be\nthere momentarily.&quot;\n\n&gt; &quot; =\r\nThis is it Rodimus, this is where our tables are going to turn, and then, w=\r\ne will make these Predacons and Decepticons eat their words. We aren&#39;t goin=\r\ng to run, we&#39;re going to fight and we&#39;re going to give it our all! AUTOBOTS=\r\n, MAXIMALS, ASSUME YOUR BATTLE MODES AT THIS TIME AND ERECT ALL SHIELDS SUR=\r\nROUNDING THE OLD MAXIMAL BASE AND THE ARK! WE WILL PROTECT OUR OWN AND VANQ=\r\nUISH OUR ENEMIES! WE&#39;RE GOING TO TAKE BACK THIS PLANET AND TURN THINGS AROU=\r\nND FOR THE INNOCENT! THIS FIGHT IS FOR FREEDOM, NOT POWER, AND WE WILL TAKE=\r\n IT BACK!&quot;\n\nRodimus nodded as well as he turned to face the oncoming seemin=\r\ngly\nendless hoard of Decepticons and Predacons, &quot;We stand together then\nTus=\r\ncon.&quot; he said, trying to sound more confident than he was. he knew\nthe odds=\r\n, even without Legacy&#39;s cautious wording. Rodimus&#39; weapon was\ngrowing quite=\r\n warm in his hand with the repeated use it was getting.\n\n&gt; He waits with an=\r\nticipation. Inside Tucson Prime pauses for just one moment, and then with a=\r\nlmost a roar in his voice..\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;AUTOBOTS, MAXIMALS, ATTACK!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Inside, T=\r\nucson Prime throws a powerful punch and launches one of his large missiles =\r\nfrom his missile carrier, attempting to open fire on the enemy to shake the=\r\nm up a bit. Night Shift attempts to do the same with his photon blast riffl=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s right, you be messn&#39; with the wrong bots slag balls!&quot;\n\nAll =\r\nmanner of sounds and light errupt through the halls as Tuscion&#39;s\nmissiles f=\r\nly through the air. However the missles failed to reach\ntheir intended dest=\r\nination as small rockets flew through the air from\nthe Predacon side, deton=\r\nating the missles prematurely.\n\n&quot;No, I think we have the correct ones after=\r\n all.&quot; said another cold\nvoice as Jhiaxus stood thier in the midst of the s=\r\nmoke and debris from\nthe missile, the anti missile defence obviously of his=\r\n doing. &quot;You\nhave lost Tuscon Prime.&quot; Jhiaxus said, his voice all confidenc=\r\ne as he\nbrought his own weapon to bear. He smiled at Rodimus, &quot;And soon you=\r\n\nboth will be among the Predacon ranks! Bwhahahhaa!!!!&quot;\n\nMeanwhile as the o=\r\nthers fight it out, Nightrazor shimmered and\nappeared next to Darkhawk and =\r\nbehind Nightshift! What he was about to\ndo was difficult to tell, because i=\r\nnstead of completing the move the\nfloor beneath his feet began to rumble as=\r\n large cracks ran through the\nentire hallway!\n\nIt would seem that these hal=\r\nlways were not designed to take on the\nfull brunt of two primes and several=\r\n leader class Predecaons,\nDecepticons and other various soldiers. So the wa=\r\nll shuddered and\nspilt as finally the floor gave way, sending the entire se=\r\nction of\nhall plunging downward nearly 60&#39; into a large open cavern!\n\nThe c=\r\navern was incredibly large, the cieling reaching up nearly the\nentire dista=\r\nnce back to the black Fortress above it. This chamber\nlooks to be totally u=\r\nnused, an natural chamber that shifted itself\nunder the fortress over the c=\r\nourse of time. The chamber itself is hot,\nthe smell of sulpher and ash can =\r\nbe detected. The fact that this room\nis not filled with searing, superheate=\r\nd liquid stone is miraculous.\nHowever it is obvious that too much firepower=\r\n in this room would bring\ntons of it pouring into this area at a moment&#39;s n=\r\notice!\n\nThere do not appear to be any exits from this room save the one abo=\r\nve,\nalthough a brave soul could perhaps try to make one . . . and risk\nbrin=\r\ng in the magma that most likely surrounds this room.\n\n60 feet above the cha=\r\nmber Legacy finally made it to the room above and\nscreeches to a halt. He s=\r\nends his scanners peering downward, &quot;A most\ninteresting development.&quot; he sa=\r\nid as he considered what to do to help.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
