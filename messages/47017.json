You need to fear nothing from me. \nPerhaps I \n&gt; &gt; can help you find out who you are. I have some kind of talents \nthat i \n&gt; &gt; could use. I can dive and help your spark find its way. Even if it \n&gt; &gt; turns out you are a Predacon, I will not hurt you nor will I try \nto \n&gt; &gt; modify your spark. I have sworn it and I still intend to uphold my \n&gt; &gt; word. But if you prefer to find another, I can help you find \none.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You...could help me?&quot; Mistra hesistated...would she want someone to \nbe doing \n&gt; that to her spark? Someone she barely knew just yet..? He had sworn \nnot to \n&gt; hurt her, true, and she believed him. A conclusion came to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Any help to find my identity would be appreaciated...however, not \nyet. If \n&gt; the offer would still be available to me later I mean...but for now, \nI&#39;d be \n&gt; most grateful if I could join your side...for the time at least?&quot; \nFeeling as \n&gt; though she hadn&#39;t provided enough of a reason, she added &quot;To see if \nanyone on \n&gt; whatever side I was on cares enough to choose and come after me, as \nyou did. \n&gt; If not, I would gladly stay with your faction.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
