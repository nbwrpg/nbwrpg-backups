The pieces from \n&gt; the shuttle crash were scattered for hundreds of feet. Part of the \n&gt; right wing was 318 feet from a piece of the nose.  There was a fire \n&gt; from the engine to 200 feet behind the shuttle.  All the windows \nwere \n&gt; cracked and smoke raised from the main portion of the shuttle.  The \n&gt; main portion of the shuttle was still somewhat intact.  It was \n&gt; crushed yet still large enough to hold a bot.  The bots arm was 67 \n&gt; feet from the shuttle and the rest of the bot was nowhere to be \nfound.\n&gt; \n&gt;    All of a sudden from inside the main portion of the ship the was \na \n&gt; banging.  Tick Tick Tick.  The sound of a fist against metal.  \nThere \n&gt; was screaming from inside the shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;Slag!  Everytime I come to Earth there is bad things.  Like I \n&gt; decided last time Earth will NOT be my grave.  The only problem is \nI \n&gt; am STUCK!!!&quot;  yelled the bot from within the wreck.  \n&gt; \n&gt;    Slowly the bot got his remaining arm out of the ship through a \n&gt; small hole.  He tried to squeeze out yet the hole was to small.  He \n&gt; tried to hammer his arm at the hole to make it bigger.  He tried to \n&gt; squeeze through the hole again this time he got his head through.  \n&gt; His face is silver with purple eyes and a purple forehead in the \n&gt; middle.  He has a tanish skinlike object on the sides of his face.  \n&gt; This is face is reconized to be Cheetor&#39;s.  Cheetor then squeezed \nhis \n&gt; whole body through the hole.  After he squeezed his body through \nthe \n&gt; hole, he look around and saw his left arm lieing 67 feet away.  He \n&gt; climbed out of the crater and slowly dragged himself away from the \n&gt; ship and towards the arm as mechfluid dripped from his wounds.  \n&gt; Cheetor started to wonder how long it would be until someone would \n&gt; find him.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:  Yes it is the loveable cat bot Cheetor, but what is his \npurpose \n&gt; to come back to Earth?  Do you care?\n\n\n"}}
