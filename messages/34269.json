She \n&gt; hears something first, a small pittering of footsteps, then catches \na \n&gt; flash of movement at the bottom of the mountain beside the one \n&gt; she was using as a lookout, then it was gone. &quot;Termitron, I saw \n&gt; something, let&#39;s check it out!&quot; Her face sports a grinning feline \n&gt; smile of amusement as she leaps from her perch, and half sprints \n&gt; and half slides down the mountain, dodging trees as she goes. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 9 May 2001, at 23:32, airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Termitron::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Termitron follows Lynxiz&quot;said Termitron &quot;Termitron thinks that \nthis\n&gt; &gt; place is familiar...

Her\n&gt; &gt;   breath puffs a swirling frosty mist into the crisp icy air. She\n&gt; &gt;   stretches and looks around for signs of other \nrobots. &quot;Termitron,\n&gt; &gt;   you see anything?&quot; Without really waiting for an answer, she\n&gt; &gt;   continues looking without much success. Her head tilts to look \nup at\n&gt; &gt;   the ridges surrounding the Valley, her nose twitches as she \npicks up\n&gt; &gt;   the scent of a deer, but she shurgs and continues. &quot;Termitron, \nwe&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt;   go to that peak over there and take a look around,&quot; she points \nto a\n&gt; &gt;   large mountain that protrudes nearly to the cloud line. &quot;We \nmight be\n&gt; &gt;   able to see something from there. I think I&#39;ll try a commlink\n&gt; &gt;   broadcast but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get much in this valley, \nwe&#39;re too\n&gt; &gt;   surrounded with obstructions... on the top maybe..&quot; She \nfinishes,\n&gt; &gt;   the last part to herself. She starts plodding on to the peak, \nher\n&gt; &gt;   fur tuffted ears perked and listening to see if Termitron \nfollows.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
