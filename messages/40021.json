I thought I&#39;d never say that. But it was true, that \n&gt;was REALLY awesome. Is the guy with the guitar named Super Guitar Man? \n&gt;Because that&#39;s what I&#39;d name him........GORE!...\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 10:45 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Postponed Rock of Ages\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Unknown Robots:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Deep within the depths of Cybertron in Predacon controlled territory a \n&gt;small\n&gt;   Predacon was running as fast as he could, ducking between corners and \n&gt;alleys,\n&gt;   looking over his shoulder every few seconds spotting nothing, but he \n&gt;could\n&gt;   hear it.  The distant sound of someone or something playing hard on an\n&gt;   electric guitar or two.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The Predacon turned another corner, a dead end.  He looked around, the \n&gt;once\n&gt;   faint sound getting louder and louder.  Full of fear, he began pounding \n&gt;on\n&gt;   the wall that blocked his path.  A stronger robot might&#39;ve been able to \n&gt;smash\n&gt;   his way through and continue on.  Or a robot with a jetpack or boosters\n&gt;   would&#39;ve been able to fly to safety.  But this Predacon had none of \n&gt;those.\n&gt;\n&gt;   He reached into subspace, taking out his laser rifle and turning around,\n&gt;   activating his comm. unit.  &quot;This is Alabastor!  All Defcons get over \n&gt;here!\n&gt;   They&#39;re after me!  Hurry the slag up!&quot; he screamed into his shoulder \n&gt;comm.\n&gt;   unit to his other gang members but got no reply.  He raised his pistol \n&gt;as he\n&gt;   saw something move and fired off a single bolt, the superheated laser \n&gt;digging\n&gt;   into the wall and leaving a small burned dent.\n&gt;\n&gt;   He focused, on realized it was nothing.  Just his imagination, but he \n&gt;was\n&gt;   still frantic.  &quot;I&#39;m dead...I&#39;m dead...&quot; he said looking around, \n&gt;formulating\n&gt;   a quick scheme.  He put away his rifle and took out his energon knife,\n&gt;   climbing up on a couple stacked boxes and leaping, stabbing his blade \n&gt;into\n&gt;   the wall.  It worked, as he was hanging on by the blade a few feet off \n&gt;the\n&gt;   ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;   He reached his free arm up as far as it would go, pulling himself slowly \n&gt;when\n&gt;   suddenly a sound that reminded him of laser rang out and a burning \n&gt;sensation\n&gt;   suddenly started in his back.  Alabastor lost his grip and fell in pain,\n&gt;   slamming to the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;   He shook his head, slowly getting to his feet, as painful as it was with \n&gt;the\n&gt;   wound in his back, the electric guitar riffs over.  He looked around,\n&gt;   spotting three robots.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;You bastards...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Shut up, Alabastor.  We wouldn&#39;t suggest trying to call your friends.\n&gt;   They&#39;re all dead.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Wh--&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;No, shut up.  I wasn&#39;t finished quite yet.  You see,&quot; the robot said,\n&gt;   beginning a small little tune on his electric guitar, which obviously \n&gt;wasn&#39;t\n&gt;   plugged into anything so Alabastor was a little confused how he was \n&gt;playing\n&gt;   it, but that was his least cocnern.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;You see,&quot; the robot continued, &quot;you tried to muscle in on our turf.  \n&gt;But you\n&gt;   didn&#39;t count on us, so we whiped you out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Most definately.  It was cake, man.&quot; one of the other robots said.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Hey, shut up, man.&quot; the original robot said.  &quot;Anyway, long story \n&gt;short, we\n&gt;   don&#39;t like it, you betrayed us, and now you can die.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;But I didn&#39;t do it!  It was one of my Lieutenants!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Yeah, well,&quot; the robot said, starting with a complete riff on his \n&gt;guitar,\n&gt;   turning a few dials, &quot;we don&#39;t really care.&quot; he snickered, playing a \n&gt;quick\n&gt;   hard riff, sonic waves tearing through the air towards Alabastor, \n&gt;Alabastor\n&gt;   screaming in pain as he scratched at his insides, suddenly blowing up.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;That dude was lame.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Most definately.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
