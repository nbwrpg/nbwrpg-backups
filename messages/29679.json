However, Fliq is like 8, so you&#39;ll be \nable to dwarf him pretty easily.\n\n::Fliq::\n\nFliq exhales in relief as he is released by Strafe. He didn&#39;t \nappreciate being called a housepet, but at least the bot wasn&#39;t \nhostile. He looks at Strafe as he tests out his various modes, truly \nimpressed. The CR chamber had recorded the bot&#39;s superstructure, but \nFliq hadn&#39;t gone through it yet. Seeing a live show was always better \nanyways.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re welcome on the repairs, and yeah, defectors are welcome,&quot; he \nsays, turning around and walking toward Iron Raptor&#39;s location. In \nextreme cases, Fliq knew he couldn&#39;t stand a chance against this bot, \nbut Iron Raptor probably would, and so would Prowl if he was with her.\n\n&quot;Follow me, I&#39;ll take you to the commander,&quot; he says over his \nshoulder, motioning for Strafe to follow.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kevin Ramsey &lt;kramsey20@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Fliq::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The grab caught Fliq complete unaware, the Maximal\n&gt; &gt; ending up looking \n&gt; &gt; at Strafe as he sat up. Fliq&#39;s hand moves his gun,\n&gt; &gt; pointing the \n&gt; &gt; barrel at Strafe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;My name is Fliq,&quot; Fliq says as best as he could\n&gt; &gt; right now. &quot;I&#39;m a \n&gt; &gt; Maximal. We found you in a crash site and repaired\n&gt; &gt; you, you&#39;re in our \n&gt; &gt; base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Strafe had to grin.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You actually think that after all I&#39;ve just been\n&gt; through that I&#39;m intimidated by your little gun? I\n&gt; don&#39;t think so.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Strafe used his other hand to grab Strafe&#39;s gun hand,\n&gt; pointing it elsewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maximal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He thought. &quot;So I owe my life to a housepet?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He begun to laugh, then pulled Strafe to him,\n&gt; grinning....then setting the smaller Maximal down,\n&gt; letting go and sitting up. The seeker jet thorougly\n&gt; dwarfed Fliq (Not moding. Optimus Prime himself stood\n&gt; at about 20 feet tall in robot mode).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Housepet or not, I do owe you my life. So in return,\n&gt; I give you my word that I am no threat to you or your\n&gt; allies and that unless I am physically provoked, no\n&gt; harm will come to any of you. I am Strafe, Lieutenant\n&gt; of the Death&#39;s Hand Division commanded by Colonel\n&gt; Neotron.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He bowed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Or at least I used to be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He checked his joints, tranformed into jet mode and\n&gt; back again, transforming his twin blasters to the\n&gt; double-barreled hand-wielded blaster he normally used\n&gt; and transformed them back to his arms where they\n&gt; normally resided. He could either use them as a\n&gt; double-barreled blaster or as twin blasters mounted on\n&gt; each arm (like on Starscream) depending on the\n&gt; situation.  He seemed to calm down instantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I must say...Fliq, you did a wonderful job repairing\n&gt; me...and since I can&#39;t exactly rejoin my Decepticon\n&gt; comrades and since I made sure Scud and Razor couldn&#39;t\n&gt; report back to Colonel Neotron back on Cybertron...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He chuckled with a hint of sadistic glee, then\n&gt; narrowed his eyes at Fliq. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I may as well stay here awhile. So tell me,\n&gt; housepet...are defectors welcome?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (tag Fliq...or Iron Raptor or whoever)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
