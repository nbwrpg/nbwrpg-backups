They all transform, and\n&gt; to Havotrons furious screams, enter the ship. Hook looks around, &quot;All\n&gt; right Constructicons, let&#39;s go, and show the Autobots what this ships\n&gt; got.&quot; as he leaps down, into the ship, followed by the rest. SLugslinger\n&gt; stands beside Soundwave, &quot;Dosent this remind you off the good ol days?,\n&gt; back to roaring around the Universe. Before we lost the war.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Apeface pushes Slugslinger as he climbs on, then pounds his chest, &quot;Yes,\n&gt; we go to hunt.&quot; he yelled. Nightmare carried Jagged to the CR chambers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hook walked to the other constructicons, &quot;So, let&#39;s show em what this\n&gt; babies got.&quot; He says, sitting down at the helm of the ship, in the\n&gt; navagational area. Scrapper sits beside him, at the guidance system. He\n&gt; begins to bark out orders. &quot;Mixmaster, activate the cloaking device.\n&gt; Scavanger, use our radar system to keep a bead on the hidden one,\n&gt; Bonecrusher, Lonhaul, get those weapon systems ready, to blow them outta\n&gt; the sky.&quot; he says with dry emotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havotron sits in the throne. &quot;Soundwave, block all radio transmissions,\n&gt; so we arent detected, and happy hunting boys.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; All Spinister did, was walk over to a window, and contemplativly look\n&gt; down at the ground, as the rockets burst to life, sending flames licking\n&gt; the launch pad with raw heat. He watched Cybertron become smaller, until\n&gt; it was gone. He whispered something, but nobody could make it out.\n\n\n"}}
