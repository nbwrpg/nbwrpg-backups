Killfest and several of \nhis men were moving away from the ship. what a perfect oppertunity for an \nattack.\n    &quot;Hell Beast, Im going to take a few bots with me on an attack of \nKillfests ship. We might not destroy the ship, but we sure as heck will do \nsome damage.&quot; She said, smiling.\n    &quot;Wait, what if thier secret little mission os to attack us first?&quot; He \nsaid, a tone of a know-it-all in his voice.\n    &quot;Then we shall wait, wont we? If they arrive here, we&#39;ll defend, if they \ngo someplace else, we&#39;ll attack.&quot; She snapped back, now watching the monitor \nmore closely.\n\n    Ominous watched too as Killfest and his men began to leave the ship. IT \nwas a good chance to attack, but he didnt have Quasar yet. And he wanted \nDarkmouse, and from what he recived over picked up transmissions, she was \nmoving out somewhere too. If that was the case, they could just ambush the \nescourt.\n\n"}}
