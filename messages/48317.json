He fastened Drillbit down to\nbe revived by the medic.\n\n--- Jonathan &lt;jhogan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos arrived in the CR chamber room and looked\n&gt; over the monitor\n&gt; applying to their recent guest. Examining it slowly\n&gt; his optics widened as\n&gt; the system specks were rather...unique...for a\n&gt; predicon. Shifting and moving\n&gt; from behind the console the bot moved to the CR\n&gt; chamber and pushed the\n&gt; release switch.\n&gt; \n&gt;     As the chamber door slid upwards he noted the\n&gt; predicon was both awake\n&gt; and waiting, he had expected some resistance but\n&gt; then again considering her\n&gt; configuration it wasn&#39;t a big surprise. &quot;My name is\n&gt; Talos and you are now a\n&gt; guest of the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade looked at Talos and shrugged, moving\n&gt; out of the chamber\n&gt; looking up at him, &quot;Nightshade, you really should do\n&gt; something about that\n&gt; bird bot of yours. Even we know what white flag\n&gt; conditions mean.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos tilted his head, Sunhawk hadn&#39;t mentioned\n&gt; that his prisoner had\n&gt; been taken while under truce conditions. Sighing he\n&gt; shrugged, &quot;It changes\n&gt; very little I assume you were looking for something\n&gt; and I want to know\n&gt; what.&quot; He said gruffly indicating the fem bot should\n&gt; walk before him from\n&gt; the room.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Walking out Nightshade wasn&#39;t suprised to hear\n&gt; the soft click of a\n&gt; readied weapon behind her. &quot;I came seeking the\n&gt; maximal leader of this troop,\n&gt; I have business to discuss with him or her. Mind\n&gt; escorting me to your leader\n&gt; rather than the brig?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos chuckled the nozzle of the pistol prodding\n&gt; her back, &quot;Well state\n&gt; your business, you&#39;ve met him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nightshade turned looking at Talos skepticly,\n&gt; &quot;How do I know you&#39;re\n&gt; telling the truth, the current example of maximals\n&gt; in this troop have been\n&gt; less than honorable...&quot; Her voice dropped low her\n&gt; tone almost insulting.\n&gt; &quot;Besides what I need to discuss has to be done away\n&gt; from prying optics and\n&gt; sensors. Know a place?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos nodded grimly indicating the direction\n&gt; towards the bridges ready\n&gt; room, an office of sorts for commanders of a ship.\n&gt; Putting away the pistol\n&gt; both Talos and Nightshade moved to the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
