Tucson has always kept the words of his Sensa=\r\ni  and maybe that will stop him from being brainwashed.  Rodimus never paid=\r\n that much attention to Yokitron&#39;s training but Tucson did.  He clears his =\r\nmind constantly during combat and an empty mind is one that has nothing to =\r\nsteal from.&quot;\n\nRattrap raises a brow.\n\n&quot; So that&#39;s why Wings was able ta kee=\r\np his sanity in check. Wow. Talk about being well trained.&quot; \n\nStraight shot=\r\n looks to Leo Prime.\n\n&quot; Tucson meant to attempt to train Rodimus the same w=\r\nay Master Yokitron taught him, but it might be too late for that.  It might=\r\n be too late.&quot;  \n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 10/20/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Q=\r\nuickstride prepares to move out with Rattrap and Straight Shot on his back.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  The tiny porcupine narrows her optics and raises her quills in readin=\r\ness to\n&gt; &gt; fight.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; We&#39;ll have ta worry about Uproar later.  Right =\r\nnow we got bigger problems\n&gt; &gt; ta solve.  And when I see that poor excuse f=\r\nor a Prime I&#39;m gonna let him\n&gt; &gt; have it!   And I don&#39;t care if it takes ev=\r\nery quill on my body!  Rodimus\n&gt; &gt; dissed us one time too many and I&#39;m not =\r\nabout ta take his scrap any more!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You got t=\r\nhat right, Prickles.  Same here, if I could take that miserable\n&gt; &gt; hot rod=\r\n apart tire by tire I would!  Humph!

After what Rodimus pull=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be surprised if the council allows him to keep the Matrix of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; leadership.  I seriously hope he&#39;s not allowed back as a Prime.  If\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnything, he better be stripped of that title until he really smartens up\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and does something about that dark side of his.  I know Leo Prime will do=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the right thing, and I definitely know Tucson Prime will not stand for=\r\n Hot\n&gt; &gt; Rod&#39;s unacceptable conduct.  Ohh I hate ta see what would happen w=\r\nhen those\n&gt; &gt; two meet face ta face again.  We&#39;ve seen Tucson when he&#39;s ang=\r\nry, he&#39;s like a\n&gt; &gt; tempest when he&#39;s in the worst of his moods.  And now, =\r\nyikes, look out.\n&gt; &gt; Dragons are notorious for extremely dangerous tempers.=\r\n  Well, that&#39;s if ya\n&gt; &gt; rub the scales the wrong way.  Other than that, we=\r\n need his strength and\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s got plenty of that.  Plus, he&#39;s been extrem=\r\nely generous, understanding,\n&gt; &gt; protective, and very sincere about our wel=\r\nl being.  Look what he did for\n&gt; &gt; Silverbolt, he risked his life to save h=\r\nim and now hopefully he&#39;ll pull\n&gt; &gt; through.  I can see why Nightshift, Str=\r\naight Shot, Talon and Rattrap have so\n&gt; &gt; much faith in him.  He will do an=\r\nything for us and it&#39;s time we did\n&gt; &gt; something for him.
