He could see the statue not\ntoo far off and the trail that led between the town and the cave and\nthe town and the mine entrance to the cave.\n\nFrom the cave there was the sounds of dim laser fire, it came out\nsounding somewhat like aggressive crickets as things went back and\nforth!\n\nThere was a vague sense of PREDACON in the area but nothing specific,\nperhaps they were in hiding, waiting for the nest moment of attack.\n\nDeep behind a small hill, out of optical sight of TUCSON and the\nothers the PREDACONS were watching, crouching silently. The humans\nthat DINOBOT shot at had frozen, apparently in fight, that is until\nthey looked up at the hovering form of TUCSON in the air.\n\nThey smiled.\n\nCovered by underbrush and foliage, they could see him, but they were,\nat the moment, still hidden from view. However it was obvious they\nwere planning something,.\n\nSuddenly there was a strange sort of &#39;THUD&#39;, then some sort of\nexplosion errupted and the cave and tunnel collapsed bringing tons of\nrock towards RAT TRAP and PERCEPTOR as they struggled to get out of\nthe cave!\n\nThere was nothing from RODIMUS!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
