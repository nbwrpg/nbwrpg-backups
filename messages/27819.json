No one had ever cared how he felt before, well, other then \nhis own mother and she was deceased now. Had been for almost a full \nyear, but that was expected.   \n&gt; But he just could NOT figure it out. He had come here explicitly to \nkill Von and take the right to their mother&#39;s property, now however, \nrealizing the Von had died long before he had ever expected, Vlad \nwasn&#39;t so sure that it was what he wanted anymore. Knowing now that \nhe was the last of his entire family was lonely, to put not to fine a \npoint on it.  But why did he feel this? He should have been overjoyed \nthat he was the soul keeper of the property now, didn&#39;t have to wait \nin line while Von took it instead.  But the only way that Vlad could \ndecide that he felt this way was that he would have felt that he had \nearned the right to those lands if he could have killed Von, proving \nthat he was the smarter of the two. But not only that, but he had \nlooked forward to see his older half brother, even though he was \nplanning to kill him in the end. But even then he hadn&#39;t planned to \nkill him himself he was going to hire somebot to do it for him and \neven then he was going to make sure that it was quick and painless. \nVlad would have had no other choice but to have killed Von anyway, it \nwas the only way. The way of a Predacon.\n&gt; If a Predacon wanted something he killed to get it, instead of just \ntaking when the person had the chance to take revenge and then only \ncause the Predacon troubles that could have been prevented.\n&gt; So Vlad cleared his throat and took in a deep breath, blocking out \nthe thoughts that he was alone as far as family went. But not as far \nas people, company.\n&gt; But Vlad never let any of this drip from his solid expression, \nfinally deciding that this was simply a set back and finding a way to \nget home to claim his rights before they were void. So, to replace \nwhat empty feeling might dwell in a spark which he meant to be solid \nand unyielding, he looked back at Fenox and smiled.**  &quot; Yeah, I&#39;m \nok. Just had to check something.&quot;\n&gt; ** He lifted a brow.** &quot; Hay. Would you mind if I stayed here for a \nbit. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know this world very well.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
