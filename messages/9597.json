He \nlooked out the window and saw two bots trying to attack the embassy. \nVulois contacted Convix.\n\n&quot;What can I do? I can not fight them?&quot;\n\nThis is a lesson many bots have learned. Sometimes to achieve peace, \nthere must be violence. But you have the Matrix on your side. Use \nyour mind power first. Show them your Hell. Make them understand. If \nthey don&#39;t listen...; you are a TM3 Vulois. That story about Cheetor \naccidentaly creating the driver was phony, we needed a story to lead \nyou away. The Matrix planted it there. Not personally, but with a \nmessanger like yourself. We wanted you and your chosen three to be \ndifferent, and have super bodies to protect yourselves. We got \nSoundwave, and than Battera, but there was an &quot;incident&quot; from The \nMatrix that provented you from meeting Cybershark.(this &quot;incident&quot; \nwill become a factor later on.)\n\n&quot;Than I will go.&quot;\n\nVulois stepped outside, took out his guns, and looked at the bots.\n\n&quot;Embassy, shileds up,&quot; he said very calmly. Now he was trying to get \nback to that hypnotized state, where he can use his mind in strange \nways. He knew it was possible. While he was channeling energy, an \nimpenitrable shield went up around his body. Vulois hoped it would \nlast, but he knew not. Once he was done powering up, he knew it would \ndissapear and he would have to fight.\n\n&quot;Time to come to my world.&quot; He said to the bots......\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n&quot;Alright, I&#39;m ready.&quot;\n\nThose were the last words Octociz spoke in this form. Brix came \nforward, and opened his chest plate. The two sparks flaoting so close \nwere like a burden, weighing on his heart. He felt one, and instantly \nhis mind got a picture of Octociz. This was the one. He carefully \nremoved it from the area. Once it was gone, Brix felt great. His own \nbody, where his thoughts are free. He placed the spark  in the pod \nand closed the lid. He saw through the lid the spark becoming a \nprotoform. He turned to Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Your turn.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
