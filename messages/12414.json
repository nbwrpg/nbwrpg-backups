She sees something \nmoving in the bushes below.  It kind of looks like a big mouse or \nrat.  It&#39;s deep in the bushes and she can&#39;t make it out that well.  \nShe flys over and perches about the creature.  It a bot.  A rat bot.  \nShe looks at it for a moment.  She smiles,&quot;Hello there.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
