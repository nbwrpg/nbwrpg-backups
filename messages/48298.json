Her first glances around show that she is \ntrapped inside of her pod, which seems to have been activated. She \nfumbles around with the interior controls, and hits the open button \nfor the pod only to find that the door only opens a few centimeters. \n\n&quot;Curses...&quot; she says, as she stretches her blackish red fringed arms \ndownward to grasp the slightly open edge of the pod&#39;s door. Her \nblack hands tighten as she grips the door tightly, and pushes at the \ndoor with all her strength.\n\nSlowly, the door inches its way open, and the pod slides backward in \nresponse to force. Scryed continues to push at the door, slowly \nopening it.\n\nAfter several minutes of pushing, she manages to make enough space \nto worm her way out of the pod. She drags herself out, and stands \nup. As she tries to look around her, she almost falls, but catches \nherself on the pod. Her computer systems had almost returned to full \nfunctionability.\n\n\n"}}
