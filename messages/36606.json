Ten large dents \nappear along its hull as the weapons on the ship begin to power up \nonce again. Vile presses a button making the four multi phase alser \ncannons begin to charge to overload. As this happens the Infecticon \nship begins to spin slowly as it moves past the Violator as it fires \neight massive blasts at the ship cuasing it to shake violently and \nlose more altitude. suddenly eight explosions erupt from each of the \nspots that the blasts hit causing the ship to shudder even more and \nexpel large amounts of smoke. The shields of the Violator come online \nquickly just as eight more blasts are fired at it although not as \nmassive as the past eight. The Infecticon ship, now over \nstarscream,Incarcinator, Neody, and scyther?(not suire if he arrived \nyet or not.)  Immediately the same white column that engulf Cyanide \nshoots down and surrounds Incarcinator, the bulge of light housing 8 \nrings flying down to surround him.(Yanshosh, your char so have him \nmove if you dont want him imprisoned for the time being.) \n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Trainer base shakes as the shells hit it. Ignatius scans the \narea\n&gt; looking for the attacker. &quot;Restart autoguns&quot; he instructs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10 Auto cannons raise up from the sand on all sides of the base \nfireing  two\n&gt; shots each at the invading army. (about six at Incarcerator, four at\n&gt; Starscream, and the other 10 at the Violator.)\n\n\n\n"}}
