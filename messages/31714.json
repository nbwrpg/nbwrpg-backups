Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined this RPG.  I had been doing \nsearches all over the internet for RPGs, but none really caught my eye until \ni saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG. I decided id like to check it out, and \nfell in love as soon as i read the story and looked at the characters.  I \nknew i must join immeadiately, so i used an old favorite character, Torca.  \nMy profile was an immeadiate mode, and i was pretty stupid when i was new.  I \nremember my first post like it was yesterday.  Torca burst into the Predacon \nbase and put his gun up to Quickstrike and tried to eliminate his spark.  \nTalon got really pissed at me.  But soon i started to catch on, and created \nstronger characters and some good stories.  In my time here in the RPG, i saw \nmany changes.  I&#39;ve seen ultra-powerful groups rise and fall, extremely \ntalented RPers come and go(not to mention a lot of idiots), and built \nfirendships with members.  Id like to thank Soulstice for his friendship and \npartnership, Zardus for putting up with me through my early times, and \neveryone else that ive had the pleasure(or displeasure) of RPing with, and i \nhope my next year here will be even better.  Just wanted to get that off my \nchest.\n\r\n--part1_66.d8c506b.27fba34f_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=arial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=2&gt;OOC: It&#39;s April 3rd, a day that seems ordinary to most of you, but not for \n&lt;BR&gt;me. &nbsp;Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined this RPG. &nbsp;I had been doing \n&lt;BR&gt;searches all over the internet for RPGs, but none really caught my eye until \n&lt;BR&gt;i saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG.
