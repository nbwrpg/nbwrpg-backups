She stopped and looked at SharpClaw. Her memory chip \n&gt; brought back the image of Drillbit. She stared for a moment, then \n&gt; shook her head to clear her mind of the past. She sat down at a \ntable \n&gt; and started to drink the liquid energon. What did she see in \n&gt; SharpClaw to make her think of Drillbit, she wondered. Perhaps her \n&gt; old chips just needed to be replaced. She sighed and drank her \n&gt; energon.\n\n\n"}}
