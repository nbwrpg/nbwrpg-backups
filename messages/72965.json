For if you\n&gt; were to hit SWOOP, by someone else&#39;s orders, you GRIMLOCK big goof!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Piping up now, &quot;For, as they say, DINOBOTS are GRIMLOCK&#39;S only to play.  For\n&gt; they bleong to NO ONE ELSE, and now someone is saying for him to hit what\n&gt; belongs to him, how can this travesty happen and him win?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Trying to play up that GRIMLOCK was the only one who could discipline HIS\n&gt; troops, and someone else having him DO it.. W ell, HE was the only one who\n&gt; could abuse them!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Me Grimlock say let&#39;s smash!&quot; GRIMLOCK said angrilly, &quot;And him Swoop\nsay no! Him Swoop say no smash, no kill, no destruction!&quot; GRIMLOCK&#39;s\noptics began to darken again as the anger inside him threatened to\nbubble forth again. &quot;Me Grimlock give the order and he say no!&quot;\n\nSWOOP looked torn, &quot;You Grimlock in charge!&quot; he said, &quot;But me could\nnot . . . &quot; He trailed off, not sure how to articulate the rather\ncomplex thoughts in his head.\n\n&quot;How do you follow the orders of a commander when he has become a\nmadmech.&quot;  Another voice said, this one sounding much more cultured\nand refined as compared to GRIMLOCK. Although he was clearly not one\nof GRIMLOCK&#39;s men he did have a resemblance to them. He was emerged\nfrom the brush halfway between WHEELIE and GRIMLOCK.\n\nhttp://tfwiki.net/wiki/Backstop_%28Cybertron%29\n\nBehind the new figure was TERRANOTRON in robot mode.\n\nSWOOP glanced at the new ones, &quot;Why you here Backstop? You were\nsuppose to wait.&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;See, you find new leader!&quot; GRIMLOCK roared at SWOOP!\n\nSWOOP only shook his head as he stepped back his hands up defensively.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
