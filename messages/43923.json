Wait the guys who made this site \ncopied the name? And my cousin&#39;s boyfriend said he saw a Beast Wars \nwhere Silverbolt was in command was it one of them? And for that \nmatter who made Beast Machines (by the way I didn&#39;t always think it \nwas Japanese I just remembered the poll said what&#39;s your favorite \nJAPANESE Transformer cartoon). And for that matter who made RID, and \nGo Bot (I saw just one episode of that)! And are there any plans to \nrelease these cartoons in the US?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Beast Wars 2 and Beast Wars Neo are show in the Japenese \ncartoon\n&gt; cannon. They made them after they saw our Beast Wars.\n\n\n"}}
