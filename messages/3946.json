Her fur was a bit \nsindged.  Her shoulder was out of alighnment.  Her tail had a kink in it.  \nAnd she felt like she had the stuffings beat out of her.  She groaned a \nlittle as she got up.  She stood up in otter mode on all fours. She waddled \nover and sat down near the entrance of the Arc.  She saw Oblitertron \nstanding near with Tritan and Shocker standing with weapons on Oblitertron. \nShe mumbled under her breath.\n\n&quot;Remember what happened when you left the lake, you got hurt.  Now your \ncharging back into something.  Oh, I&#39;m going to regret this.&quot;\n\nShe ran up so she was in between Shocker and Sniper.\n\n&quot;You guys need help?&quot;\n\n----------Origianl Message---------\n&gt;From: &quot;Jason Lind&quot; &lt;icedemon101@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: (unknown)\n&gt;Tritan/Shocker\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;they both flew to each side of Sniper transformed and pulled out gun and\n&gt;rocket lauchers\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Tritan:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;you better listen to sniper.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Shocker:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;if not then you won&#39;t see another moon rise.\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
