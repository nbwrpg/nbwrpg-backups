She \nthought that what he was talking about was very similar to that of \nthe maximals. Only one step above and beyond that.  But what was to \nhappen next? The Predacons and the Maximals were currently dominating \nthe planet and warring on one another. She wondered if thier little \ngroup was to become a three bot army, or would Veratis make other \nlike them and then they go and defeat all the other bots. To leave \nonly the &quot;MUTANTS&quot; to live on this planet. She sighed and continued \nto isten. She hoped that somewhere, some how, they would find a way o \nbring peace amongst the other groups and maybe just co-exist in \nharmony. She shook her head knowing that that dream would never be \nreality\n\n\n"}}
