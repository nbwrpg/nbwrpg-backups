Plintissa wasn&#39;t moving. Dracona smiled and walked back toward =\r\nher base. A dagger flew into Dracona&#39;s back. She spun around and grabbed th=\r\ne dagger in pain. Plintissa stood there.\n\n      &quot;You do not know when to gi=\r\nve up, you fool, but never mind that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you =\r\nso small you won&#39;t be able to be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She=\r\n kept her hand covered and flung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and h=\r\nit Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dac=\r\nona and took her down. Dracona once again turned to her saw blade to saw in=\r\nto Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dodged. Dracona star=\r\nted to burn everything with fire beams. Plintissa still avoids it. Plintiss=\r\na was always a good fighter, but it wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life th=\r\nat she discovered her true fighting power. Plintissa beat Dracona merciless=\r\nly. Draocona&#39;s parts were flung everywhere as Plintissa spun a simple stick=\r\n through the air. Dracona raised the saw blade and sliced the stick to piec=\r\nes. Dracona laughed and sliced Plintissa several hundred times. Plintissa f=\r\nell.\n\n      &quot;Th weak move aside and die so the strong can survive. As ancie=\r\nnt as the Cosmos, that has always been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintis=\r\nsa, you were a good friend, but don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just busin=\r\ness.&quot; Dracona said.\n       \n      Dracona pulled back the saw blade and thr=\r\nust it towards Plintissa. Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier and threw =\r\nit. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as she d=\r\nid, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. Dracon=\r\na blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first arived on the=\r\n planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces everywhere.=\r\n Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n      &quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus=\r\n I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona died smili=\r\nng. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she would never lea=\r\nve her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and she got =\r\nweaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. He was crying, =\r\ntoo.\n\n      &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintissa whispered=\r\n.\n\n      &quot;Why are you leaving me, Plintissa? Why does everyone betray me?&quot; =\r\nArtist asked.\n\n      &quot;Artist, there floats Dracona&#39;s spark, recover it, we =\r\ncan&#39;t part, she really was my friend.&quot; Artist walked up and captured the ex=\r\ntinguished spark as it tried to fly away. He contained it in a capsule.\n\n  =\r\n    &quot;Plintissa, if you leave me, I&#39;ll...have no more reason to live, all my=\r\n friends are gone, my helping days are over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n      &quot;Your hel=\r\nping days are never over, and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n =\r\n     &quot;This isn&#39;t some lame thing about how you&#39;ll always be in my heart, is=\r\n it?&quot;\n\n      &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Artist looked at=\r\n Team Ultima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, that it was des=\r\ntroyed by Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that originally buil=\r\nt it. And there it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis=\r\n looks at the base and sighs.\n\n      &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we =\r\nhave to leave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n=\r\n      &quot;Blizzard, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n=\r\n      Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her an=\r\nd floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he needed to do. He ope=\r\nned his chest compartment and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plint=\r\nissa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.\n\n      &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Arti=\r\nst whispered really low. Plintissa told him she still loved him. Artist was=\r\n overjoyed! Plintissa was with him now, and now they could never be seperat=\r\ned again. Artist, completely ignoring Blizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis an=\r\nd Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n      &quot;Artist, now we need to take care o=\r\nf Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa said. (Remember, only Artist can hear Plintis=\r\nsa now) Artist headed toward the Maximal base, there Dracona would get a ne=\r\nw body, one she could not attack anyone ever again in, and where she can al=\r\nways be helpful. Artist held up the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still inside=\r\n.\n\n      &quot;I love you.&quot; Artist said seemingly to nobody.\n\n      &quot;I love you =\r\ntoo.&quot; Plintissa said to Artist. Artist continued walking to the Maximal bas=\r\ne...\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03F2_01BFFE9D.6C150260\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Twister/Blizzard&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Twister: =\r\nI was sent on a mission to stop another bot named \nRetroflame.

Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as she did, \n      the blade c=\r\name loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. Dracona \n      blinke=\r\nd her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first arived on the \n      =\r\nplanet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces everywhere. =\r\n\n      Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus I am sorry. =\r\nPlintissa, do not \n      forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona died smiling. Pl=\r\nintissa remembered that \n      she promised Dracona that she would never le=\r\nave her sitting. Plintissa \n      cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and =\r\nshe got weaker and weaker. Artist \n      stepped slowly over to Plintissa. =\r\nHe was crying, too.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintissa \n      whispe=\r\nred.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Why ar=\r\ne you leaving me, Plintissa?

He contained it in a \n      capsule.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Plintissa, if you lea=\r\nve me, I&#39;ll...have no more reason \n      to live, all my friends are gone, =\r\nmy helping days are over.&quot; Artist \n      said.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Your helping days are never over, and w=\r\ne&#39;ll always be \n      together.&quot; Plintissa said.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;This isn&#39;t some lame thing about how =\r\nyou&#39;ll always be \n      in my heart, is it?&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whisper=\r\ned. Artist \n      looked at Team Ultima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny=\r\n thing was, that \n      it was destroyed by Dracona, the very one, along wi=\r\nth Plintissa, that \n      originally built it. And there it was, sticking a=\r\nbove ground now and \n      burning away. Sinesis looks at the base and sigh=\r\ns.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Twister,=\r\n Dracona is dead, I guess we have to leave.&quot; \n      Sinesis says.

Her spark suddenly \n      burst=\r\n from her and floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what he \n      n=\r\needed to do. He opened his chest compartment and his spark was revealed. \n =\r\n     Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his own, they became \n      one=\r\n.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Till all =\r\nare one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. \n      Plintissa told him she still =\r\nloved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plintissa \n      was with him now, and now=\r\n they could never be seperated again. Artist, \n      completely ignoring Bl=\r\nizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran \n      out into a field.&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Artist, now=\r\n we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; \n      Plintissa said. (Remember=\r\n, only Artist can hear Plintissa now) Artist \n      headed toward the Maxim=\r\nal base, there Dracona would get a new body, one \n      she could not attac=\r\nk anyone ever again in, and where she can always be \n      helpful. Artist =\r\nheld up the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still \n      inside.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;I love you.&quot; Artist said s=\r\neemingly to \n      nobody.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;I love you too.&quot; Plintissa said to Artist.
