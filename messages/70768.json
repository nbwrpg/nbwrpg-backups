But most of all O=\r\nptimus, our paths appear to be the same, our values, our courage, our stren=\r\ngth and our faith in those around us. Are our origins alike? If so, is ther=\r\ne a direction I should be going toward? One that will help me to guide the =\r\nAutobots and Maximals to finding the road toward peaceful existance?

It could be that the Matrix energy that had\nbeen animate be=\r\nfore has been temporarily used up, or perhaps the\nsituation now was not suf=\r\nficiently critical so as to call it into\nbeing.
