Pacifix rubs his chin, and thinks about how he can help the =\r\n\nnew bot. &quot;Hmmm,&quot; His thoughts cross Artemis and Icedemon, &quot;I think i \nknow=\r\n how I can help you.&quot;\n\nPacifix nods to the smaller bot who enters, &quot;Go ahea=\r\nd Jet V.&quot;\n\nHe turns back to Skullhammer, and smiles, &quot;This is Jet V, he&#39;s o=\r\nur \npilot. He&#39;ll be able to plot you a route, and I&#39;m pretty sure that \nArt=\r\nemis, a reconnaisance of our crew, is returning soon with a \nrecuruit and o=\r\nur shuttle which we are more than pleased to lend you. \nWe&#39;ll have to send =\r\nsomeone along to bring back the shuttle.&quot;\n\nHe listens carefully as Skullham=\r\nmer leans towards him, &quot;Jet V&#39;s \nlooking on the maps right now. We might no=\r\nt have up to date records, \nbut we will have general base locations and suc=\r\nh.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jet V, what have you got for us on the map?&quot; Pacifix says, looking \nb=\r\nack over his shoulder at Jet V&#39;s progress.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;polar_cla=\r\nw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (OOC) \n&gt; Thanks for outlining the base for=\r\n me. Definitely will turn out to \nbe \n&gt; of some help at one point or anothe=\r\nr. Oh, and if anyone cares, I \nsay \n&gt; that instead of making a sequel, we s=\r\nhould just restart. It would \n&gt; really help people, I think, to get a chara=\r\ncter and stick with \nthem \n&gt; through the storyline enthusiastically if some=\r\none who didn&#39;t get a \n&gt; chance to be influential in this game got the optio=\r\nn of helping \nbuild \n&gt; from a clean slate and work on their own part of the=\r\n storyline. \nThat \n&gt; way they could feel like their character and gaming po=\r\nsts actually \n&gt; have an impact on the world if they didn&#39;t get that chance =\r\nthis \ntime \n&gt; around. \n&gt; \n&gt; (IC)\n&gt; Skullhammer laughed. The deep, gravelly =\r\nlaugh came from deep \nwithin \n&gt; his mechanical vocal system. &quot;Join you! I w=\r\nish! Have you seen this \n&gt; body? The sensory suite of my pod launched early=\r\n and read an \n&gt; elephant. I also came in WAY off course.&quot; He smiled, paused=\r\n, and \n&gt; stood still for a moment. &quot;It was intended that I come to the \n&gt; A=\r\nutobots to get a vehicular form, and thus I was supposed to land \n&gt; here, a=\r\nt the base. Or close to, anyway. However, my pod&#39;s computer \n&gt; screwed up m=\r\ny thrusters all to slag. I came in far to low and \nearly \n&gt; and screamed ri=\r\nght over=85what did they call it? Umm, Africa? Yes. \nThe \n&gt; computers burnt=\r\n right out and launched the sensory orb. I ended up \n&gt; like this. Eh, I was=\r\n sent to help the allied Maximal forces here \non \n&gt; Earth in part anyway. T=\r\nhey prepared me for the eventuality of \n&gt; becoming an animal. I would have =\r\npreferred my old form, however.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Skullhammer walks closer to Pacifix a=\r\nnd inclines his head a \n&gt; little. &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to stick around the =\r\nAutobot base, and \n&gt; see some familiar styles and procedures, I suppose I h=\r\nave to at \nleast \n&gt; repot to the Maximals. Whereabouts are the friendly bas=\r\nes? And \nwhat \n&gt; is the Maximal and allied forces statuses on this planet?&quot;=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
