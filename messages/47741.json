The legendary Autobot, who had \n&gt; &gt; descided to work on a Maximal ship, made his way to the bridge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; {Talos}\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bridge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The maximal commander listened as the reports came in, the \narmory \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; imagined must have looked like a battle hit it. Sighing he righted \n&gt; &gt; himself in his chair more fully turning towards the two bots that \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; walked onto his bridge giving a nod of respect to Hot Rod, it had \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; a relative honor to serve alongside one of the more key figures in \n&gt; &gt; their peoples histories.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The other seemed to imply he was a criminal of some sort, he \n&gt; didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; really care in any case. &quot;Armory is only shook up, but reports \nseem \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; say the thrusters are off line and quite frankly scrap. We need to \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; external sensors up and see just what kind of planet we&#39;ve crashed \n&gt; &gt; ourselves on, once we can see where the slag we are we can go from \n&gt; &gt; there...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning he regarded the &#39;criminal&#39;, &quot;I don&#39;t know what in the \n&gt; Matrix \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re talking about. You appear to believe you&#39;re in trouble with \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; law but at this point I don&#39;t give a slag what you&#39;ve done. This \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; is in bad shape, we have a mission to complete and I don&#39;t have \n&gt; time \n&gt; &gt; to assign personnel to guard you in a brig.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Turning he looked the bot in the eye, &quot;Help Hot Rod get our \n&gt; &gt; sensors up and running or report yourself to the CR chambers on \n&gt; deck \n&gt; &gt; two if you&#39;re too injured to help. But if you plan on sticking \n&gt; around \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re gonna help us, now get to it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Swiveling in the chair he regarded the com, &quot;Icedemon and \n&gt; &gt; Archangel get started on repairs on either the computers or Comm \n&gt; &gt; systems. BlackKnight check the ship for any more bots whose comms \n&gt; &gt; might be down, injuries to the CR chambers those not functioning, \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; much as I hate to say it, we&#39;ll worry about later, priority on the \n&gt; &gt; operational first.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning back to look out the shattered window he silently hoped \n&gt; &gt; Megatron was as bad off as they were, if the predicons launched a \n&gt; &gt; pre-emptive strike he doubted the ship could take a beating after \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; crash. Moving to the computers he began investigating the status \nof \n&gt; &gt; the frigates weapons and defense systems, they weren&#39;t priority \none \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; the moment but he wanted at least something to re-assure the crew \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t sitting blind and utterly defenseless.\n\n\n"}}
