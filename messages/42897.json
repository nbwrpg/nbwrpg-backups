I wish I had one \n chance to meet the bastards responsible for this and....but thats not \n important. I wish to send out my hopes that no one in the rpg was hurt or \n killed in this attack. I pray for all the victims and thier familes and \n friends.  &gt;&gt;\n\nMy anger is great, I&#39;ve always hated Bin Laden, Iran, and Palestinians and \nall other Arab terrorists who wish to harm America.  Especially after I \nrecently stepped out of a cloak to further understand the world of politics.  \nI&#39;ve always hoped the Arab terrorists would be wiped out, and this only \nfurthers my opinion in my own mind.  I hope America responds to these \nterrorist attacks swiftly and brutally and that Israel helps us in paying \nback Arab terrorists ten fold.  I&#39;m obviously not happy, so I won&#39;t be \nposting today.\n\n"}}
