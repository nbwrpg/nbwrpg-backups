He sensed something was=\r\n terribly wrong and that Rodimus was in danger.  And it wasn&#39;t by the Decep=\r\nticons or Predacons.  A new enemy. It was all he needed.  But this time he =\r\nwas not going to put up with scrap.  It was the one thing that separated hi=\r\nm from Optimus Prime.  His temper was slightly shorter than his mentor&#39;s.  =\r\nHis power levels spike quickly due to his change in temper.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s where=\r\n you&#39;re wrong.

Whether or not it would hit his target was co=\r\nmpletely unknown.  He was dangerous when angry.  Straight Shot, whenever sh=\r\ne traveled with him would be sure not to push any of his buttons the wrong =\r\nway.  She could now sense that her brother was having one of those bad mood=\r\n fits.\n\n&quot;Uhh ohh, he&#39;s in that mood again...  Perceptor, guys, if I were yo=\r\nu I&#39;d shield your audio sensors.

Here along the =\r\npath, according to the reports,\n&gt; there had been a chamber that at that tim=\r\ne had distinctive minion\n&gt; signature. However the report also reported that=\r\n at last scan that\n&gt; chamber had been filling with magma, but now sensors w=\r\nere picking up\n&gt; something very different from that specific location.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n While no one was close enough to see it, it was still nearly a quarter\n&gt; o=\r\nf a mile down the tunnel, sensors showed this area to be an open\n&gt; area, on=\r\ne that stretched several hundred meters in diameter, and was a\n&gt; perfect ci=\r\nrcle. From within this chamber Rodimus Prime&#39;s signature\n&gt; could be made ou=\r\nt, although it did not appear that he was conscious at\n&gt; the moment judging=\r\n from his low energy output. Strangely his signature\n&gt; seemed to be a bit m=\r\nuffled as if something were covering it or\n&gt; attempting to remove it.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAlso from that larger chamber there is the signature of something\n&gt; truely =\r\nalien. It was not Predacon, Decepticon, Autobot or Maximal, but\n&gt; it was te=\r\nchnological life none the less.\n&gt; \n&gt; From in front of the group, just outsd=\r\nie the range of Tuscon&#39;s lights\n&gt; step figures, six of them nearly identicl=\r\ne to the ones that the group\n&gt; had already seen before. Insectile and alien=\r\n they were as big as full\n&gt; grown lions. However a seventh is there as well=\r\n. It looked much the\n&gt; same as the first ones, but was larger, nearly as la=\r\nrge as the tunnel\n&gt; itself and about as large as an elephant.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You hav=\r\ne come to feed the mistress.&quot; said the larger of the figures,\n&gt; its voice h=\r\nissing as it did so. &quot;Good. Your technological\n&gt; distinctiveness will be ad=\r\nded to our own, and we will become\n&gt; stronger.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The creatures continue=\r\nd out of the darkness and into the light, thier\n&gt; bladed feet echoing oddly=\r\n as they sliced through rubble and rock to\n&gt; attack!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Presto=\r\nn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
