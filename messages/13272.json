She drew her\n&gt; gun and fired at close range at Airbomber, aiming for his head.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Megatron roared in absolute anger as Airbomber began to shoot\n&gt; up his\n&gt; &gt; already messed up lair. He stomped forward and wrapped his tail\n&gt; gun&#39;s claw\n&gt; &gt; around his neck and pulled him close.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;You will regreat ever wakeing up!&quot; Megatron hissed, letting a\n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; spitlets hits his face. He squeezed harder, sinking the ridges of\n&gt; his claw\n&gt; &gt; deeper into Airbombers throat. With two glareing optics, he looked\n&gt; to Kitkat\n&gt; &gt; to finish the intruder off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Paralysis looked to his commander and apologised. &quot;Forgive me,\n&gt; Sir. Shes\n&gt; &gt; in the bunker but said to call her on your comm. Is there anything\n&gt; else I can\n&gt; &gt; do for you?&quot; He said to Quickstrike, saluting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Tarantulas was puzzled over the strange writings of the aliens\n&gt; that were\n&gt; &gt; scattered about, dead and rotting. The Triangle room was indeed the\n&gt; &gt; Operations Center of the bunker. It was complete with computers,\n&gt; &gt; Communications devices, and an odd kind of screen.\n&gt; &gt;     He tried another set of decodeing programs, but to no avail.\n&gt; The language\n&gt; &gt; of the aliens was very complicated. It made the Vok&#39;s language look\n&gt; like a\n&gt; &gt; walk in the park. Fustrated he slammed down his claw on the table.\n&gt; &gt;     The spider hissed, &quot;OH! These aliens are very crafty! But I\n&gt; have another\n&gt; &gt; card up my sleeve......&quot; He then reached for one of Hell Beast&#39;s\n&gt; disks. The\n&gt; &gt; one that had told them where this place was might tell them\n&gt; something about\n&gt; &gt; this language.\n&gt; &gt;     He put the disk in and the odd runes on the screen suddenly\n&gt; began to\n&gt; &gt; change into Predaconese. He could completely understand it now.\n&gt; Hell Beast\n&gt; &gt; must have decoded them.....\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Ah, excellent. Now to find out what happened here, and why.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Aracnia pushed open one of the sealed doors, now open of\n&gt; course. The room\n&gt; &gt; was warm, and dark. She changed her optics into Nightvision and\n&gt; entered.\n&gt; &gt;     In the center of the room was a large cylider like object. She\n&gt; guessed it\n&gt; &gt; was the powersource for something.....but what? As she got closer\n&gt; she saw the\n&gt; &gt; control panel, but didnt understand a word on it.\n&gt; &gt;     She turned a left. This room was a mystery, but as soon as\n&gt; Tarantulas\n&gt; &gt; decoded the runes, she would unlock this mysterious puzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
