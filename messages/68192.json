It no longer makes any attempts to raise or open its doors. As to the scans around the base, it is not difficult to locate the spider spies once full sensors are on, the more intensive scanners locate them fairly quickly. It is obvious that due to thier small size and elusive nature, passive sensors would have most likely not detect the spider spies.  \n\nOne spy is located in the shuttle bay, the other near the planning room. \n\nPreston\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
