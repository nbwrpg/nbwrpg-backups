HA! She would love \nto see them try!\nNow she was wiser, and now she was more determined then ever to get out, and \nget her revenge!\nBrightBlade pressed her finger to the small cloaking device as she heard the \nfire systems activate, they weren�t going to get her with the same trick \ntwice!!\nNow, the cloaking shield around her had a more�reflective surface to it, \nmainly so that whatever was behind and around her would look just that. So \nthere was no mistake that the sprinkler drops would be viewed as if they \nwere going through her as well.\nBesides, she was armed, and although she may not kill Rex�she wasn�t about \nto hesitate shooting him!\nThe door to the CR chamber opened, light spilling on onto her optics.\nBrightBlade smiled but made no sound, simply walking towards the opening, \nher weapon trained at Rex�s head should he discover her ploy and try \nanything.\nNo the real test of her abilities began. :\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
