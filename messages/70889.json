He knew they couldn&#39;t go any closser.\n\n&quot; Ulp.  Umm=\r\n, we better think this over before we go any closser Windlord...  Things do=\r\nn&#39;t look so good down there...  Those are seekers, and one slip from us, we=\r\n&#39;re as good as jet kill.&quot;\n\nFrom his observation post, Quickstride could sen=\r\nse the worry in Rodimus&#39;s voice.  He too was worried and continues to keep =\r\nhis ears and eyes peeled in all directions.  He paws his left front hoof.\n\n=\r\n&quot; Just what I was thinkn&#39; Rodimus.  I wonder if they got tipped off about o=\r\nur plan of action..  Slippery stuff when there&#39;s a mole involved that we do=\r\nn&#39;t know about..&quot;\n\nFrom where Night Shift was, he could not see the seekers=\r\n, yet, just by his radar systems, he could definitely tell that there was a=\r\n flying brigade around the fortress.  He slowly comes to a stop.\n\n&quot;Oh snap.=\r\n  Radar&#39;s teamn&#39; with enemy forces.  Tucson do ya copy?  We got trouble.&quot;\n\n=\r\nTucson gets the message.\n\n&quot;I copy, what&#39;s your status?&quot;\n\nNight Shift backs =\r\ninto an area, conveniently hidden by fallen boulders into a cave like struc=\r\nture, just large enough for him to park in.  He douses his headlights.\n\n&quot; B=\r\nad news, my radar&#39;s just picked up a sentry around the fortress spire, acco=\r\nrdn&#39; ta the readings, they&#39;re seekers.  Rat Trap&#39;n Windlord aint&#39; gonna get=\r\n too close ta that tower.  If they do, they&#39;re as good as prisoners.&quot;\n\nTucs=\r\non thinks.\n\n&quot; I certainly do not wish to risk their lives...  I will inform=\r\n them immediately of your findings.&quot;\n\nHe turns on his com link to Rat Trap.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Rat Trap, do you read me?  This is Tucson Prime, over.&quot;\n\nRat Trap gets t=\r\nhe message.\n\n&quot;I read ya Wheels.  And I don&#39;t like what I see down there...&quot;=\r\n\n\nTucson now turns his direction toward the sound of his sonars.  He now pi=\r\ncks up multiple pings as he too, slowly moves into position.\n\n&quot; You are awa=\r\nre of the pending danger, good.  If you can not enter the fortress, we will=\r\n find alternate ways of doing so.  Do not risk yourselves needlessly.&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;Gotchya, but, Wheels, we really do owe ya one.  If it weren&#39;=\r\nt for you, none of us would be out here fightn&#39; for what we believe in.&quot;\n\nT=\r\nucson pauses.\n\n&quot; Be careful my friends, you are far too valuable to lose.&quot;\n=\r\n\nNight Shift remains parked.\n\n&quot;This is as far as I go for now.  Unless thos=\r\ne seekers are diverted, we can&#39;t do scrap.&quot;\n\nHe turns to acknowledge Kup.  =\r\nStraight Shot looks down to Night Shift from inside Kup&#39;s cab.\n\n&quot;I got an i=\r\ndea.  It&#39;s a long shot, no pun intended but it might work. I am equipped wi=\r\nth long range equipment.  What if Kup used me as a cross bow, to take out s=\r\nome of those seekers, create a diversion so that way Windlord and Rat Trap =\r\ncould make it inside?&quot;\n\nNight Shift spins a tire.\n\n&quot;I dunno, sounds risky..=\r\n. What if they barrel after us?  I ain&#39;t a speedster.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks=\r\n at him.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s worth a shot.  Let&#39;s run it by Tucson.&quot;\n\nTucson now reciev=\r\nes a message from Straight Shot.  He ponders the daring move.\n\n&quot;Hmm, that w=\r\nould work as a diversion but it&#39;s extremely risky...  But nothing we&#39;ve nev=\r\ner dealth with before..  All right, perhaps it is necesary to make a move. =\r\n Straight Shot, Kup, I want you to position yourselves as best you can.  Ku=\r\np, take robot mode, Straight Shot, cross bow mode, and program your traject=\r\nory settings to long range.  Be sure to conceal yourselves amply.   Night S=\r\nhift, I&#39;ll need you to remain in vehicle mode, for a quick getaway.  Rodimu=\r\ns, Quickstride, it has now come to my attention that unless a diversion is =\r\nexecuted, Rat Trap and Windlord may not make it into the fortress safely.  =\r\nStraight Shot is going to provide the diversion along with Kup&#39;s help.  Be =\r\nprepared, once this diversion is in place, we may need you two to get into =\r\nbattle mode to fend off any seeker that tries to attempt an attack on the A=\r\nrk.  I know these changes are sudden, but unfortunately, there is a lot of =\r\nuncertainty in this mission.  All right, battle stations everyone, things a=\r\nre about to get rocky.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;sup=\r\nercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As most of the crew waits at the Ark, or at leas=\r\nt somewhat behind, Windlord\n&gt; and Ratrap begin the journey towards Hydras&#39; =\r\nblack tower. Most of the trip\n&gt; is largely uneventful. The duo passed over =\r\nrivers, streams, mountains and\n&gt; even an ocean to get to their destination.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As they close in to perhaps within 50 kilometers they can see the tal=\r\nl ebony\n&gt; colored spire that is the dark tower, jutting out of a large lake=\r\n of glowing\n&gt; red hot magma like some dark fist of defiance; its dark well =\r\narmored surface\n&gt; glinting in the sun like well shined onyx.\n&gt; \n&gt; As they g=\r\net closer, perhaps within 20 kilometers, they can see dots swooping\n&gt; aroun=\r\nd the tower looking something like birds of prey over a rabbit in the\n&gt; fie=\r\nlds. However the fields themselves are broken lands, rocks and stones\n&gt; jut=\r\nting out of a nearly featureless landscape.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Windlord and Rat Trap g=\r\net a little closer they can see that the dots are\n&gt; not birds at all, but t=\r\nhey are jets, each one of them an exact replica of\n&gt; Scourge! Five of them =\r\nsweep through the skies their movements are a well\n&gt; orchestrated search pa=\r\nttern. Either they were looking for something, or\n&gt; keeping an sensor open =\r\nfor anyone approaching. It was obvious that to\n&gt; approach any further in th=\r\ne open would risk detection.\n&gt; \n&gt; *     *     *     *     *     *     *    =\r\n *     *\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Rodimus nodded at Quickstride, his =\r\nface obviously\n&gt; troubled. There was a part of him that knew that he needed=\r\n to be here at the\n&gt; Ark to protect it, yet another part of him wanted to b=\r\ne there where the\n&gt; action was.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced at his screens, &quot;I don&#39;t kn=\r\now quickstride, maybe they do know of\n&gt; our plan already and are just waiti=\r\nng for us to fall into a trap they have\n&gt; set.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
