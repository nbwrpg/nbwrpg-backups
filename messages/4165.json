She tilted her head and wondered if she was \nstarting to like him. A program surge reminded her that her number one \nsuperior officer was standing right there and she needed orders from him \nonly while he was around her. Her programming commanded her to obey Megatron \nfirst, Quickstrike second and Scorponok third. She walked over and looked at \nMegatron.\n\n&quot;Commander, what would you like us to move in first?  The power supply \ngenerators and get the lighting up?  Or start with the CR chamber  just in \ncase?  I await your orders Megatron.&quot;\nShe stood infront of Megatron lowered her head to him as a sigh of \nsubmission and waited for him to give her his commands.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
