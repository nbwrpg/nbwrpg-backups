First we\nwould have to remove her from herself so that the parasite could be\nremoved. However, we would need a protoform, anther spark chamber, a\ncr chamber, and it possible, a spare brain per say to duplicate or\ndownload all her programs onto a back up just in case. Hmmm, but it&#39;s\npossible. Very possible. I wonder if we could comminucate with this,\nah, Sedna by itself? Wonder where it came from and what it needs? If\nit needs a form, then we might give it a protoform of it&#39;s own if it&#39;s\non our side. Perhaps the only way it could communicate with us at all\nwas to possess another bot to do so.&quot;  She whispered, &quot;Interesting,\nvery interesting.

But first, I must ask to be able to see the object itself\n&gt;   before I do anything. One cannot damage the host of a parasite to\n&gt;   remove the parasite. The host is the victim and must survive. But, if\n&gt;   it is discovered that it is a symbiotic relationship, both may\n&gt;   actually be benefitting. However, if from what you have told me, be as\n&gt;   little as possible as it may have been, I will endevour to\n&gt;   successfully remove this, erhm, thing from your beloved.&quot;  She tried\n&gt;   to as a little flair to her performance, hoping to the Matrix that it\n&gt;   might instill a little confidence in Rodimus that she might actually\n&gt;   know more than she did. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t really smart, she\n&gt;   was. But this would be her first mission, so to speak. And she wasn&#39;t\n&gt;   going to let anything come between her and success.
