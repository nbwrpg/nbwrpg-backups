He decided that true courtship was best kept for=\r\n when he could finally see her as he hoped to see her, with his own eyes.  =\r\nYet, at this moment he was very happy.  Just to have someone in his life wa=\r\ns a gift enough for him.\n\n&quot; When I first came back online, I thought there =\r\nmay have been a power outage in the med bay.  Then I was told it was no los=\r\ns of power.  The medics told me that the cranial shot I sustained was the c=\r\nulprit for my visual impairment and that they weren&#39;t positive, but thought=\r\n the damgage could be reversed.  After that, I recovered from other physica=\r\nl damages, but got used to being blind.  Other senses compensated for that =\r\nand I just accepted it for what it was.  Then an Autobot engineer came up w=\r\nith the idea of fitting me with a sonar system, and it worked.  I suppose I=\r\n won&#39;t be needing it anymore once the repairs are complete.  That&#39;s - if it=\r\n can be repaired.&quot;\n\nHe sighs.\n\n&quot; I knew it would take a long time, so I pro=\r\ncrastinated and things got out of hand during the wars against the predicon=\r\ns and Decepticons, so I put that on hold for a while, until we found a mome=\r\nnt of calm.  So much for that.  Now that Hydras and the Decepticons are at =\r\nfull force, and us with just a small handful of warriors, I fear that a ful=\r\nl sense of calm won&#39;t be achieved.  It&#39;s up to Rodimus, Lord Elder and myse=\r\nlf to get us to that point.  I know we can do it, and if I&#39;m going to pull =\r\nmy weight in this war, I have to have all my senses online, including my si=\r\nght.&quot;\n\nHis crystal blue optics although dimmed, shimmer like aquamarines ag=\r\nainst the sun, as the light of the room catches them.

He&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always be=\r\nen like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometim=\r\nes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happe=\r\nned ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defe=\r\nnse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe =\r\nthat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed wi=\r\nth mine too, at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about =\r\nhis thinking outside the box?

But instead o=\r\nf it exploding into shards of glass and\n&gt; &gt; debris it simply changed to sho=\r\nw a mountainous scene, a volcano, and\n&gt; &gt; then the volcano exploding to rev=\r\neal the Ark. It was obvious from the\n&gt; &gt; motion that the events were being =\r\nspeeded up for ease of viewing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Soon after it happened a small sate=\r\nllite like device rose up from the\n&gt; &gt; Ark and began to travel away from it=\r\n and after a while return. After\n&gt; &gt; another short moment, short because of=\r\n the speeded up play back,\n&gt; &gt; MEGATRON flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOU=\r\nNDWAVE and a few other\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon seekers, obviously having been repair=\r\ned by the device. They\n&gt; &gt; all land on a cliff and look back at the Ark, an=\r\nd STARSCREAM fires a\n&gt; &gt; blast at the Ark and they all fly off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ins=\r\nide the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMUS PRIME is\n&gt; &gt; als=\r\no is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Thi=\r\ns is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\n&gt; &gt; cons fell t=\r\no earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The scene fades to black.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;These sequence of cannot be disrupted.&quot; LEGACY intoned coldly.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Without the Autobots none of you would be here.&quot; LEGACY turned back\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no face STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;And without the Decepticon&#39;s attack on the Ark\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe Autobots will not survive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LEGACY folded his arms behind his ba=\r\nck, &quot;There can be no disruption of\n&gt; &gt; the time flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was a =\r\nsmall beep on LEGACY&#39;s panel causing him to look over at\n&gt; &gt; it. &quot;Interesti=\r\nng.&quot; He said curiously. &quot;It would seem that I am\n&gt; &gt; required on the bridge=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
