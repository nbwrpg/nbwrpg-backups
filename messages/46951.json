Her ears flew back, eyes darting to and \nfro \n&gt; nervously as a normal wolf would do..although she didn&#39;t run. Merely \nbacked \n&gt; up until her hind legs bumped into the status pod...she would defend \nit if \n&gt; she had to. Even if it did mean nothing...\n&gt; \n&gt; A high pitched squealing drew her attention for a split second as a \nsmall \n&gt; flock of bats flew from the cave, afraid of danger. Frankly, she \ndidn&#39;t blame \n&gt; them...but they were natural creatures of this world. Unlike \nherself. She had \n&gt; to defend what she had. Still, she couldn&#39;t help but smirk for a \nsplit \n&gt; second. So...it seemed that&#39;s where part of her beast form had come \nfrom. All \n&gt; the more unnatural...but she rather liked it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickly, her attention was drawn back to the forest as she heard \nsomeone \n&gt; approach, almost swearing she could smell them. Her wings were \nraised, in an \n&gt; effort to make herself look more menacing should this person be an \nenemy, \n&gt; fangs beared. And then, he emerged. A dragon like creature. \nLike...herself? \n&gt; Was he?\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; After some moments walking in the forest, he saw a cave. He had \n&gt; &gt; damaged some trees accidentally, so he knew he would be waited \nfor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: Greetings, my friend. I am AzureBlade, and I truly \ncome in \n&gt; &gt; peace.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Her bat wings lowered somewhat, fangs no longer beared...although \nshe was \n&gt; still ready to defend herself should she have to. Even if she stood \nno chance \n&gt; against the much larger bot (or he at least seemed large to her by \nthis \n&gt; point). Crystal blue eyes uncertain, she replied &quot;G-greetings...I am \ncalled \n&gt; Mistra...&quot; She considered, then added as an afterthought more \nquickly &quot;I \n&gt; think.&quot; Calming herself, her wings lowered a bit more &quot;You...swear \nto me you \n&gt; mean no harm?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
