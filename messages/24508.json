It was uneven odds...but Carnage had\nnot\n&gt; payed attention to honor no matter how much people told her about it...and\n&gt; how many times Dinobot tried to pound it into her skull.\n&gt; Carnage didn&#39;t lower her rifle as Instrat lowered her weapons. Making sure\n&gt; to keep a close watch on her.\n&gt;\n&gt; Beside her, Teltili looked un confusion as Instrat spoke and lowered her\n&gt; scythe.\n&gt; What was up with thi?\n&gt; Only seconds ago this woman was trying to chop their heads off!\n&gt; Teltili glanced towards Carnage for a moment and saw that she kept her\n&gt; weapin upraised, then moving to keep her dart gun aimed towards the enemy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Carnage growled for a moment, keeping her weapon aimed towards Instrat&#39;s\n&gt; head.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Honorable?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
