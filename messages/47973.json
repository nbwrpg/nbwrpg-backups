By now the\nreports of the communications repairs had filtered in as well as reports of\nthe sensor enhancment to the north.\n\n    Looking around he nodded to those present and made his way back to the\nbridge. The first day of the new beast wars had gone smoothly with only a\nfew minor problems left to deal with. First were the two younger bots on\nboard, he had no idea how they got there, this wasn&#39;t a passenger ship but\nthe fact of the matter they were here and that meant they had to be included\nin the mission.\n\n    As he walked onto the bridge nodding to Sunhawk since he seemed to be\nlooking for him he took his chair and turned to regard the leutenient even\nas he played over the second issue in his thoughts, Sunhawk was a wanted\nfelon. He knew it and Sunhawk knew it. However he was willing to give any\nbot, no matter the tarnish on his or her record, an opportunity to prove\nthemselves. He held no doubts that Sunhawk would be taken into custody by\nthe port officials when the mission was done with, but depending on how the\nbot held himself during this mission would decide wether or not he&#39;d have\nTalos&#39; good word put in for him.\n\n    Turning he noticed one of the consoles blinking, turning distracted from\nhis thoughts and Sunhawks report as he investigated. A weak signal was being\ncaught by the new arrays dish. It seemed like an outdated distress beacon\nsignal and maximal in design, but this algorithim hadn&#39;t been used\nsince...the original beast wars.\n\n    Talos rose shaking his head, impossible. There&#39;s no way one of Primals\ncrew could still be here could there? He couldn&#39;t chance it. Pressing a\nbutton on the comm he spoke, &quot;Hot Rod, Blackknight, report to the bridge for\nnew orders.&quot; Sitting back in his chair he turned back to regard Sunhawk.\n\n\n\n"}}
