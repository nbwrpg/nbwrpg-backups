You have to admit the targets were a \nlogical choice in order to start a war. If they had succeeded in \nkilling the top officers of the US armies, the president and did \ndestroy (as they unfortunately did) the WTC, it would have meant a \npolitical and economical paralysis for the US, as well as a TOTAL (and \nI mean it) loss of morale for your country... even worse than it now \nis. May the souls of the dead find peace and the most lethally wounded \nfind it soon so they dont suffer. \nBTW:Im usually not in favor of war (in this case, its not another \ncountry so US cant declare war) but I dont think it can be avoided. In \nthe case it comes sooner than expected, then good luck surviving it...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Ah hell...
