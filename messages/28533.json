This was a much more effective solution than\nfighting an potential ally. Galvatron, he thought, he knew that many off\nhis soldiers felt hatred for him, but it was a gamble when he spoke the\nwords, as the Predacons never showed this hatred towards him. Megatron\nchose his words carefully, still standing tall, to try and show his power,\n&quot;Galvatron, is on this planet, and has tampered with me, and my destiny. I\nneed you Predaking, you need me. Together, we can rebuild what Galvatron\ndestroyed.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
