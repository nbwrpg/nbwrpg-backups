He perched ontop of it like a roosting bird, and \nlooked at the things below him. He thought it was a perfect personal spot. \nIt wasn&#39;t out of sight, but he liked it. It gave him that superiority in \nheight. He ducked his head under his wing and closed his eyes.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
