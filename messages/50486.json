I&#39;m not that surprised you came on over to\n&gt; leave your lip imprints everywhere, Cassidy. You are\n&gt; queen of ass kissing. And you couldn&#39;t be more\n&gt; incorrect about the people here. The people here are\n&gt; complete asswipes who cannot resist putting my,\n&gt; Lurker and former member Hollywood Narrator&#39;s posts\n&gt; down. Well, not really me, because you all thought I\n&gt; was DEAD, eh? Well, if I was, it&#39;d be better then\n&gt; this. This RPG has fallen from grace, and it ain&#39;t\n&gt; gonna get up. I used to be able to squeeze some fun\n&gt; out this RPG, but that time is gone. Ever since the\n&gt; restart, this RPG has been resisting the fact that\n&gt; it just needs to lie down in it&#39;s own grave that\n&gt; it&#39;s very own members and moderators have dug. The\n&gt; restart introduced brand new sparkling fresh rules!\n&gt; Like a 5 character limit! And what a crock of shit\n&gt; this was! I was going to leave then, but stayed\n&gt; anyway, because of my wanting to keep this RPG far\n&gt; from death. I realize now, that it isn&#39;t possible.\n&gt; Not when you have shit for brains like Cardhead and\n&gt; Airly here. And Airly, you bitch, in case you did\n&gt; not know, you introduced a new misery to my life in\n&gt; my time of being here. I have put up with your\n&gt; shitty English and god awful posts, filled with\n&gt; modes of ridiculous attacks and ignoring my attacks.\n&gt; I could not be happier as I bid you all a middle\n&gt; finger, with the exception of Lurker. I will\n&gt; remember this RPG, for being where I first met him.\n&gt; And before I go, I want to wish Airly a lightening\n&gt; bolt to the skull, and Cassidy, you will soon find\n&gt; that if you post, you be put down, and that the only\n&gt; one in this RPG with any sense is Lurker and that\n&gt; you will soon come to regret your ass kissing.\n&gt; Lurker, see you in the INCREDIBLY AWESOME DBZSF,\n&gt; MAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!! And bye to you all.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Hop Along Cassidy \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 2:20 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Nice group... ^.^\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC: Hi, everyone. ^_^ I know this is sort of out\n&gt; of the blue, but I just felt the need to compliment\n&gt; NBW RPG. It seems like a very nice RPG, if you ask\n&gt; me. Most of the writers are very good, and their\n&gt; posts seem well written. I really do enjoy looking\n&gt; through the posts. Haha, I don&#39;t understand a lot of\n&gt; stuff, because I don&#39;t know much about Neo Beast\n&gt; Wars, but I do like how this RPG is built. You guys\n&gt; do an excellent job, and I thought you deserved to\n&gt; hear it from someone who&#39;s not really in the RPG.\n&gt; ^_^ All of you are quite lucky to have such a great\n&gt; owner who keeps the place in shape and together.\n&gt; But, what&#39;s an RPG without the members? ^.~ Well,\n&gt; before I end up writing a speech so long that you\n&gt; guys forget what I&#39;m talking about (hee hee, trust\n&gt; me, I can do it... ^_~) I guess I had better shut\n&gt; up. ^_^ You guys are terrific! Keep up the good\n&gt; work, and support each other so this RPG will last!\n&gt; I just know you guys! can do it! *cheers* NBWRPG!\n&gt; NBWRPG! NBWRPG!...\n&gt; \n&gt;   With bushels of love,\n&gt; \n&gt;   *~-Cassidy-~*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print\n&gt; your photos: Click Here\n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
