They pulled up \nbeside it, and sent a message to within.\n\n\n&quot;Hello? Is anyone there? This is Brix, formely known as Bronco. I \nhave the spark of Octociz inside of me, and if it isn&#39;t removed soon \nwe will both die. It has been a hard two weeks, and our circuts are \nalmost out. We are both loyal maximals, so do not think we will hurt \nany of you. Please, we need your help.&quot;\n\nVulois\n\nVulois sits around the embassy, and then reaches the inevitable.\n\n&quot;It looks as if my chosen three have decided not to come. I must \ncontinue alone.&quot;\n\nHe sends a message to every bot on the planet.\n\n&quot;Everyone, listen. Maximal, Predacon, Alliance or any other faction, \nlisten. This is Vulois. We have all been fighting a stupid war. \nCybertron is crumbling, and we are the only ones who can save it. I \nknow, because I have recently been inside The Matrix. I have felt \nit&#39;s despair. The only way we can rebuild Cybertron is if we all \nunite, as one. We harness the energon together, and than return to \nCybertron and unify everyone under beast modes. Please, I beg of you, \ncome to my co-ordinates and join in the very first Embassy meeting. \nYou many not want to come yet. I can understand. But please think \nabout it. Even if you here what we have to say, you don&#39;t have to \nfollow it. Please, just come and listen.&quot;\n\nHe sits and waits.\n\n\n"}}
