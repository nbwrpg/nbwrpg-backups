He decided that he would go to the tower and =\r\nvisit some of the scientists there.  He had always been welcome there and t=\r\nhey usually had interesting things to tell him.  He enjoyed learning about =\r\nnew things. \n\n  The Pasificus base was located near the edge of Atlantis.  =\r\nAlthough they greatly disliked conflict, their base was built just as stron=\r\ng as any other military base.  He liked to walk when he was in the city, be=\r\ncause people were always happy to see him and it was good to maintain good =\r\nrelations with the people that he had sworn to protect.  As he walked throu=\r\ngh the garden-like boulevard leading to the tower, citizens waved at him an=\r\nd he was greeted warmly.  Atlantis was a beautiful and friendly city. \n\n  H=\r\ne arived at the tower and the police guards there gave him a polite salute.=\r\n  They were not obligated to do so, but he was respected by everyone, espec=\r\nially the police with whom he often worked closely to help maintain order i=\r\nn the city.  In the lobby, he punched the button on the elevator and door s=\r\nlid open a moment later.  A few people got off, and Lord Perseus got on.  H=\r\ne pushed a button and the elevator took him to the floor of one of the larg=\r\ner research laboratories. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
