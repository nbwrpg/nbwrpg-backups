She landed hard \nas she hit the ground, mech fluid dripping from the wound in her chest.\nBrightBlade yipped in rage(which is what foxes do) and jumped to her \nfeet...*\n\n&quot; You wanna fight? I&#39;ll give you a fight!!!!!!&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade swerved around a tree trunk and started to fiddle with the \ninnards of her gun, she hadn&#39;t told Hell Beast that she could hot-wire \nweapons just for the fun of it.\nShe switched the charge cavity with an extra energy booster , which made the \ncharges extra powerful. She smiled as she put the gun back together again, \nnow the fun started.\nBrightBlade jumped out from behind the tree and fired at the boulder, when \nthe charge hit it the huge rock exploded into chunks. Dust rose up and \nchocked the air, it had been a pleasure to make sure that the charge had the \nforce of a sticks of TNT.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
