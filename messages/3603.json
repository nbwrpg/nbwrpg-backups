Her voice a little louder then he knew she intended it to be but the fact not bothering him, he had had others snap at him and simply paid it no mind.\nHe continued towards the intended room without a single movement to indicate that he was to turn and listen to the clone�s words but was, indeed, listening, her need to know more about Megatron clearly being heard and understood. He knew that her need for more information on the enemy in which she seeked to destroy was not hard to come by but he did not know a whole lot himself, he was also, some what, new to this time period and had lost track of what had happened after his death. His only recollection of Megatron to this current date was that he had left his one body behind and had obtained a new one, his appearance obviously changed and thus only making it more difficult to track him down, though Dinobot would know Megatron when he saw him despite what for he took.\nBut he had learned to leave that bit behind him and focus on what was really at hand, he would eventually get his shot at Megatron again but waited patiently for that day to come when he spilled the Predacon�s fluid upon the ground�hopefully before Cyber Claw got to him first.\nThe clone and himself had more in common then just having the same type of DNA, the clone�s characteristics obviously reflecting his own but had more of her own then anything. But even that was similar, if they shared anything more then most it was a strong urge to rip Megatron limb from limb. Only he didn�t go charging into things without knowing what he was up against, not this time.\nDinobot growled into the silence of the hall way and into it�s shadows, he knew not to much but he knew enough to be worth speaking to Cyber Claw, only that the hall was no place to do so and the bridge was no all that far from their present position. Not to mention the fact that the main entrance was there just in case Cyber Claw decided to run off and destroy Megatron now instead of thinking things over and really pondering to tell if they were really worth it, his opinion being that they weren�t worth killing one�s self just to be rid of a constant nightmare when it was obvious that it had forgotten about you and thus was not a threat. But that was his opinion.\nBut perhaps they could discuss this matter as they made their way towards the bridge and then that would give Cyber Claw time enough to think whether she really wished to throw her life away like a fool, when arriving there then she may have made up her mind and the door being there just incase she wished to go ahead with her plans.\nIt was suicide to him but she had to figure that out on her own, she may have been cloned from him but she had her own mind and knew how to use it.\nWith a snarl/growl he spoke�*\n\n� Come��\n\n* Never slowing down a step and never turning to see if she caught his drift he continued down the hall and towards the bridge, his one words simply requesting that she followed him towards the destination and giving her time to sort out her problems if she needed to.\nBut he was never one big for conversation but his listening skills were excellent, being able to listen and actually grasp the meanings behind the words that even the speaker did not know were there. His answers to questions always being short and to the point but he knew enough to think of what he was going to say before it left his throat, thus giving his social skills just as much edge as his aggression.\nBut with a twitch of his tail the answers to Cyber Claws need for information began to form within his mind already, what he knew and how he could tell it. Only needing Cyber Claw to follow him in order to complete the process.\nWithout looking back but slowing a fraction he spoke again�*\n\n� I do not know much but what I do will be freely spoken�if one will follow and listen.�\n\n*There, if Cyber Claw did not pick up that message in which stated that she should follow then it was her loss.\nThen suddenly a familiar scent came to his senses but one in which he had been expecting to come across for some time, it was a scent he knew just as well as his own but was more gentle and soft. That of a second fembot, that of Tavatron.\nDinobot looked about the shadows of the hall and finally spotted what his optics had been looking for, the clear and darker shape of a shapely and, obviously, feminine body leaning against the wall not too far away from his current position.\nFor a moment he was sure that he was about to get scolded for coming out and investigating the situation with Cyber Claw, knowing that he had gone against Striker�s orders to leave her alone and Tavatron�s as well. They had both clearly stated that he was not to advance towards her in a threatening manner�but he hadn�t, his advancement was that of unexpressed curiosity in order to gain information in which he wished to know.\nBut for some reason the knowledge of Tavatron�s presence calmed him a bit and almost made him forget any doubts about the situation with Cyber Claw. But the nagging feeling that she would be angry with him still lingered in the air. He looked straight at her to let her know that he knew of her presence, it was also a bit obvious for nobot could hide their scent completely.\nDinobot stopped but did not looked her straight in the optics, he had learned better then to do so now in case she found something other then what he was again. That past incident didn�t really effect him but it was still strange to have somebot care about him to the level that Tavatron did, he had never known what it was liked to be cared for�until now.\nEven though he knew his physical strength was greater then hers he was still wise to be cautious around Tavatron when she became a little intolerable of events, he had seen her in battle and knew how great a warrior she was and she had earned his respect as such. And now he wasn�t so sure about what sort of mood she was in, even though her scent could give it away it seemed that with all of the steel and structure surrounding them he couldn�t focus on one scent alone.\nDinobot looked carefully at the silouet leaning against the wall but wasn�t able to judge her mood by her stance either, he growled but not with any threat present�*\n� I will explain all and answer any questions in which you must wish to ask�but not at the moment. �\n\n*He then looked past Tavatron and down the hall towards the War room, plainly looking for a handle on the moment. *\n\n� I must escort our guest towards the Bridge, you are welcome to accompany me�as always.�\n\n* With that said he then began to move off towards the bridge again, Tavatron�s knowledge of Megatron might be able to answer Cyber Claw�s questions as well. He did not know all and Tavatron might be able to fill in a few gaps in which he had missed as well, thus satisfying everybots questions.\nHe hoped that they would follow him, Tavatron for her knowledge and company and Cyber Claw listen to the information in which he could give to the best of his ability. But if they refused to follow then he would simply continue on his way, the base shaking a bit almost seemed to give the indication of a battle out of doors and may the Matrix forbid if he missed it. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
