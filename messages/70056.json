Now I admit, I dunno if =\r\nI could ever take your job big guy. \nNot that I ain&#39;t capable of it, I know=\r\n I ain&#39;t a good match for the position. \nAnd I ain&#39;t afraid ta admit that.&quot;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tucson Prime nodds once, and \nstudies Cyclonus once more.=\r\n Something dawns on him. He seemed relieved to be \nfree of something. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Is it me Cyclonus or do you appear to be \nliberated of someth=\r\ning that may have been holding you back? Why do you work with \nHydras anywa=\r\ny? What is the purpose of working with him when you can be your own \nindivi=\r\ndual? Your life should be as you intended, and not what others have \nintend=\r\ned for you. It boils down to freedom. You have the chance to experience \nfr=\r\needom. If I were you I&#39;d take that chance now. As a matter of fact, Scorpon=\r\nok, \nScourge, what seems to be holding you two back here, when you yourselv=\r\nes can be \nyour own individuals as Decepticons? Does Hydras have you on som=\r\ne sort of leash? \nI see no such restraints so that means if you want freedo=\r\nm you should also take \nit.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Night Shift could see what Tu=\r\ncson was up to. It was one of \nhis thinking outside the box kind of strateg=\r\nies. And a strategy that would \nbenefit all and not just one faction. Tucso=\r\nn was trying to break new ground, and \nas crazy as it all looked, he sits b=\r\nack to watch it all take place. Tucson Prime \nnow steps asside and waits to=\r\n see if any of them either try to destroy him, or \nactually agree with what=\r\n he was trying to tell them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Whatever \nany of you chose, =\r\nyour decision is your own and I will not interfere. We may not \nbe allies, =\r\nbut I do respect the need for one&#39;s free will. But if you attack me, \ndo no=\r\nt expect me to be so forgiving.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Preston \nCarrol=\r\nl &lt;supercyclonus@&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nNightl=\r\night Nodded, she stood up with fear in her face. she was ready to follow \nR=\r\nodimus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus tapped his code on the door and i=\r\nt \nslid open.
