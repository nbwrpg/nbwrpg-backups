Many of the bot&#39;s logic circuits are \ndamaged beyond repair, but still operate. In short, it has driven him \nfrom being the valiant black knight to the dark stalker.\n\nReplacing the circuits would be possible, but very jeopardizing for \nBlackfang&#39;s spark. That is the one intact part inside him.\n\nOOC: Trying to replace the circuits will only kill him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wheeljack blinks.  &quot;Other wolf?
