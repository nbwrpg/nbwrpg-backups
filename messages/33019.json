What Megatron\nhad yelled had rung a bell in Autofire&#39;s mind. He had heard the same\nline on one of the shows that humans on earth called &quot;movies&quot; back\nwhen he was a bounty hunter.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gestalt_menasor@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Dont be offended by what Megatron does here, he is after all a \n&gt; jerk.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron looked up at both of them. He didnt care that they were \n&gt; taller (it&#39;s not a big deal guys). He snarled, then grimaced. He then \n&gt; took a few breaths and calmed down. &quot;No, you followed orders Autofire, \n&gt; and for that I commend you,&quot;. He then quickly snarled, &quot;but when I \n&gt; want your opinion Fireblade, I&#39;LL GIVE IT TO YOU&quot; he yelled as he sent \n&gt; a flailing backhand towards the taller robot. With Megatron&#39;s \n&gt; strength, it didnt matter how tall the robot was.\n\n\n"}}
