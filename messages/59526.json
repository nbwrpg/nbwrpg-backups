He knew\nthere was only one thing that could truly stop the\nmadness inside Azure growing any larger- the very same\nthing that was their only hope of defeating Unicron.\nTurning away from Cheetor, he faced Deathstar. \n\n&quot;Your plan is flawed Tripred. There is but one way to\ndefeat Unicron.  If you had been alive to face this\nyou would know this for yourself. As for you Rodimus,\nI am surprised. Considering that you yourself fought\nUnicron in the Earth year AD2005, I would have thought\nyou of all Cybertronians woulde no that nothing short\nof the Matrix of Leadership will destroy the chaos\nbringer. However I warn all of you that if Unicron is\nDestroyed here, then the futurew will be errevocably\nchanged. If Maximals and Predacons destroy Unicron\nhere, resulting in them being from a future that never\nwas, then the very space time continuum could destroy\nitself from the resulting paradox.  As for the\nlocation of the Matrix itself, my spark was sent from\nits resting place in the Matrix of your present day.\nPrimus himself gave me its current location. I can\ntell you now though that you wont like the answer\nthough Rodimus.&quot;\n\nShadowcaster waits for a reply.\n\nhttp://personals.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo! Personals\nNew people, new possibilities.
