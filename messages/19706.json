That wasn&#39;t right...\n&gt; The ship that had \n&gt; exploded had emitted almost no energy, not enough to\n&gt; even register on \n&gt; more than visuals.

Or \n&gt; rather moving this base to it.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; WarMachine nods as he recieves Zardus&#39; transmission.\n&gt; &quot;On my way,&quot; he \n&gt; says, heading for the pods.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike waits for Life to answer.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica enters the bridge of the Alliance base,\n&gt; sitting down at the \n&gt; scanners, frowning as he recieves the transmission.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer frowns as he sees the gun in Vamprah&#39;s\n&gt; hand.

Squizzy\n&gt; did which left two\n&gt; &gt; options, either take her back to Veratis when she\n&gt; went, or have a \n&gt; late\n&gt; &gt; supper\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
