He w=\r\nas heading to\nEarth to visit some friends. Not knowing what he would find w=\r\nhen he\ngot there, he decided he would need a suitable vehicle mode. He foun=\r\nd\none in the ships databanks. A Cybertronian tanker, complete with the\nabil=\r\nity to lift off.\n&gt; \n&gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the s=\r\ncan of the\ntruck, every little detail. Then downloaded the information into=\r\n\nhimself. He got up from his chair, built for the old Autobots and\nDecptico=\r\nns, and went to prepare. As he incorporated the designs into\nhimself he tho=\r\nught of all the people on this planet. He was ready.\n&gt; \n&gt;             He to=\r\nuched his chest, the change to actual bot had hurt\nhis combined Spark. Prim=\r\ne was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; \n&gt;             In the deep Pr=\r\nime voice that had once declared to\nMegatron that &quot;one shall stand; one sha=\r\nll fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus\nwould dare betray me like that?&quot; He didn&#39;t even=\r\n sit down as he entered\nthe atmosphere, the ship shook. He was searching fo=\r\nr the bomb that he\nknew Magnus had planted on the ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n          The ship&#39;s thrusters exploded, but the rest of the ship\ndidn&#39;t. I=\r\nnstead, it careened out of control and slammed into the\nground, throwing Pr=\r\nime out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as\nhis ship stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n           When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. He\nwas in fu=\r\nll operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked\nback to the ship =\r\nto look. He was in bad shape, his face had been\nripped apart, and the visor=\r\n over his ocular systems. Now everyone\ncould see the protoform underneath, =\r\nthe red eye that turned and\nlooked. His faceplate was smashed and dented, a=\r\nnd his &quot;windshield&quot;\nchest was broken, so one could see the shoulder joints =\r\non the inside.\nAll in all he looked like some sort of robot sent back from =\r\nthe\nfuture, to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but he\nc=\r\nould live with that.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Luckily for him, the communications b=\r\noxes on these pods\nwere nearly indestructible. He would need it to talk to =\r\nthe other\nbots.
