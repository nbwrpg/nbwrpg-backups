KitKat came and started acting all friendly, the \n&gt; thing a leader should do when welcoming a gues. He heard the order \n&gt; she gave to Destructor about the bot he had captured. He whispered \n&gt; into KitKat&#39;s ear.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like this. She&#39;s going to do something.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked to Inferno.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll go. You should be here, since it;s your base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream waled to the lab and saw the small bot reading some \npapers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Alright! What are you doing? Who gave you the permission to look \nat \n&gt; those. They are classified!&quot; He said, ripping them out of her \n&gt; hand, &quot;Now, we&#39;ve got some questions. The most importantly, where \nis \n&gt; Megatron?&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon had been watching Koj appraoch, and easily dodged his stars. \n&gt; He laughed at him, thinking how foolish it is to attack all of the \n&gt; Trainers by himself. Him, Ignatius, Bullet and Savage flew up into \n&gt; the air and surrounded him. Prebon was infront of him, Bullet \nbehind, \n&gt; Ignatius below and Savage on top. Prebon laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So you have seen us. Big mistake. You removed our chip. What a bad \n&gt; thing for you to do. You could have had a great lifestyle with us \n&gt; Koj, you have much potential. When the chip entered your spark, I \n&gt; learned much about you Koj. I know about Lilly and Soundwave. I \nalso \n&gt; know that you have something to do in the afterlife. Well tonight \nis \n&gt; the night Koj. Your wish will come true. Say hello to Lilly for me!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon jammed his lance right into Koj&#39;s throat. Bullet fired two \n&gt; missles at the back of him. Ignatius fired two feather explosives\n&gt; (Kind of like grenades. They are feathers, and 10 seconds after \nthey \n&gt; attach they explode) and Savage blew two fireballs onto Koj&#39;s head.\n\n\n"}}
