It went skidding, then it hit a tree and came to a halt.  It looked pretty damaged.  However, the bot inside wasn&#39;t, fortunately for the Maximals which he was most likely to join.  The pod scanned for a beast mode, and it chose....it chose....It broke down.  So now, the bot inside, would have no organic anything, completely mechanical.  He hadn&#39;t come out yet.  But, finally, the bot inside burst out by firing a shot from some sort of energy weapon.  There was flames and scraps of the pod door everywhere.  The bot inside emerged, and walked out of the wreckage.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Ah finally, I&#39;ve made it to this damned rock!  &#39;Bout time!&quot; the bot said, brushing some char and and stuff off of him.\n&gt; \n&gt;         The bot turned around to look at the rest of his pod.  He extanded his arm, and spread out his fingers, so that his palm was facing the wreckage.  Then, a hole in his palm opened up, then a short spikey thing came out.  It charged up some swirling energy, then, fired a blast at the crash site.  All of the scraps, grass and the tree were blown up to smithereens.  The spike thing went back inside of his hand, and the hole closed, and then he pulled back his arm, turned around and went walking towards Maximal City.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Heh, there&#39;s every need to fear, &#39;cause Weapon is here!&quot; the bot said, revealing his name to be Weapon...\n&gt; \n&gt;         Weapon, from a safe distance, stopped.  He pressed a few buttons and stuff, and eventually managed to get a fairly large fusion cannon.  He aimed it at Maximal City, and fired a blast from the fusion cannon at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~The Keeper of Souls~\n&gt; ~The Shadow of the Dark~\n&gt; ~I Am, The Lurker of the Abyss~\n\n\n"}}
