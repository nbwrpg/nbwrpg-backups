One boat is on the water obviously \n &gt;  searching, while a floating car hovers over the waters doing its own \n &gt;  search. Meanwhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd dot in the skies, \n &gt;  one that he can see to be a Predacon eagle. He is pointing at it. And \n &gt;  even as he is doing this he notes something strange coming from \n &gt;  behind the eagle. The sky for a moment seems to flash and ripple, \n &gt;  almost like lightning, and yet there is a slight rotation to the \n &gt;  flashes. \n &gt;  \n &gt;  In the skies above the eagle looks down noting Rodimus pointing at \n &gt;  him, and he begins to drop out of the skies moving out over open \n &gt;  water, preparing either to flee, or do a strafing run. In either case \n &gt;  he is totally unaware of what is transpiring over his head.\n &gt;  \n &gt;  On the grounds below Rodimus can see what is coming as his enhanced \n &gt;  vision sees two very tiny dots spiraling out from the rippling \n &gt;  flashes.

Small gouts of flames \n &gt;  flowing from him even as he impacts the water.
