No one here is \n&gt; impartial.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s unfair because there&#39;s more to RP&#39;ing than just\n&gt; fighting.  In fact one \n&gt; of the biggest complaints before the restart was\n&gt; that there were too many \n&gt; pointless battles.  To make it all about fighting\n&gt; would be a mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and resubmit\n&gt; your idea to the council, \n&gt; I suggest you send it to the council.  Your idea has\n&gt; merit and might work if \n&gt; you can fix the flaws.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
