Sorry, I didn&#39;t know I was moding. All I should\n&gt;no is that it&#39;s a memory wiping machine. I shouldn&#39;t know who it&#39;s\n&gt;for or anyone else&#39;s names. Sorry. Let me change my last post than.\n&gt;Battera, you don&#39;t have to respond back, I&#39;ll take your original\n&gt;message. Sorry again.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*Before Baterra&#39;s message*\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois looked down at the Predacon stalking him. Maybe this one could\n&gt;be good to join his group. She looks good at sneaking and spying. And\n&gt;maybe she knows how to use this mind whiping device. If it&#39;s meant\n&gt;for someone I can use them.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Hey Batgirl! How would you like new purpose in life? How would you\n&gt;like to join me?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;*After Battera&#39;s message*\n&gt;\n&gt;Vulois answers back.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Who am I? Well, I can&#39;t tell you that until you agree to join me.\n&gt;What&#39;s in it for you? How would you like to win the Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;and than go back to Cybertron to rule?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
