Anyways, let&#39;s keep it in game. \n\nBIC:\n\nYggdrasil felt a smile tug at his lips as he saw that his particle \nhits had not missed target. Hitting Devilcat was missing his target, \nas he saw the forest around slowly start to burn.\n\nWith Jayde out of the way, he knew that he was in deep trouble. He \nraised his shield against Fury&#39;s knife; it was torn out of his grip. \nHe was not in the best situation. He kept track of Fury with both \nmachine guns but did not fire.\n\nYggdrasil: I demand a cease-fire! Let me talk! I&#39;m not here for you, \nso let me explain!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: I see.  And I got an exemption on the faction bit already - \nit&#39;s \n&gt; turned out to be necessary as there&#39;s only one non-cardhead Rogue \n&gt; kicking around.  (And her controller is asleep at the switch again.) \n \n&gt; BTW, Torin hit the dirt and Fury attacked with TWO weapons capable \nof \n&gt; reaching the target - you obviously misread my last post.  (Fury&#39;s \n&gt; lashknife works both at a distance and in a melee - it&#39;s a blade \n&gt; attached to a handle by an extending cable.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jayde takes several hits as she scrambles behind cover.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Fury, whirling his lashknife in confusing patterns, closes to easy \n&gt; striking range - still outside Yggdrasil&#39;s reach - and slashes out \n&gt; with the whiplike device.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gatara and Devilcat also close in, the former trading her machine \ngun \n&gt; for a long chain and the latter brandishing his laser sword - taking \n&gt; the particle fire on his energy shield.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Torin and Riekan regroup to one side, waiting for a sniping \n&gt; opportunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Fine, I just wanted to give him a break before I started to \n&gt; &gt; accept lots of damages. And may I remind you that normal faction \n&gt; rules \n&gt; &gt; say that one player isn&#39;t supposed to possess more than 50% of a \n&gt; &gt; faction? Besides, Torin was aimed too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC: Yggdrasil knew this was getting very nasty. He managed to \nfire \n&gt; &gt; twice more with his particle canon before two bommerang blades dug \n&gt; &gt; deep in his right arm. It started feeling numb and he dropped his \n&gt; gun. \n&gt; &gt; Torin&#39;s counterattack hit him hard in the abdomen. He tries to \n&gt; reach \n&gt; &gt; for his barkskin shield to get some cover, but the blast from \n&gt; &gt; Devilcat&#39;s and Gatara&#39;s weapon throw him back, missing him by only \n&gt; &gt; a few feet in front of him. He stands and is hit by Jayde&#39;s shot. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; rises his shield and blocks Fury&#39;s venom shots and turns at Jayde \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; fires wildly his two machine guns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Freaking preds of my slag!\n\n\n"}}
