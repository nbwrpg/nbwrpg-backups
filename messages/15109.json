Drilbit, Atma, Pseudo, Phobia, \nhimself.\n\n&quot;All right, 5 of us. We each vote. Can&#39;t vote for yourselves. I gotta \nput my vote towards Phobia. He saved our butts back at the cave, and \nhe was willing to sacrifice himself to save us all. I think he&#39;d have \nthe courage and guts to make a leader.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
