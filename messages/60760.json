I nearly crashed into him when I \narrived.  Besides, I have a score to settle with him.  He is here to \ndo what he attempted years ago: destroy the Autobot Matrix.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Organics stepped forward as her step brother brought the pilot \nwith him.\n&gt; &quot;And Unicron has his minions in full force.  They managed to take \nour brother, a most powerful bounty hunter.  They took him with \nthem, up there,&quot; she said, a little sad and point up, to Unicron.\n&gt; &quot;WHAT?!?&quot; the clone roared, clinching his fists.  \n&gt; Organics rushed to calm the Emperor clone, to some avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Fortuneteller&#39;s jaw dropped, &quot;UNICRON!!!!

He noted how\n&gt; &gt; small her hand was to his, but he wasn&#39;t the average\n&gt; &gt; transformer, and the thought entertained him enough\n&gt; &gt; for a minute grin.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I think it would be best to get to a base.  With\n&gt; &gt; Unicron around, it is dangeous to remain out in the\n&gt; &gt; open.  Perhaps my step sister could arrange\n&gt; &gt; something with the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He lead Fortuneteller to Organics and Ydrassil, to\n&gt; &gt; see both the Maximal&#39;s reaction and speak with\n&gt; &gt; Organics.\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
