Firearm and Proto were flying high overhead, \ncloaked. Smokescreen was scouting ahead on foot, also cloaked. Somewhere in \nthe area, Brix, Fliq, and Snow Cat were also making their way to the meeting \nplace, hopefully also cloaked. That made 8 bots, all out to rescue Striker \nand Spears.\n\n&quot;Then we&#39;ll need to get them and programm them back to Maximal, I guess.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCloaked on his cliff, Slayer scans the area, searching for any Maximals. \nCatching a glimpse of Ramulus in the distance, Slayer&#39;s face twists into an \nevil smile.\n\n&quot;They are on their way, Master,&quot; he says into his comm-link, watching Ramulus \ncarefully.\n\n"}}
