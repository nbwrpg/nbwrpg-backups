Prebon slid him onto a CR Table \nand studied the readouts. technically his body was gone but the spark \nremained. As long as the spark could be saved the body wasn&#39;t \nimportant. &quot;Blaze, reroute his spark to a life support system.&quot; Blaze \ndidn&#39;t say a word as she did what was ordered. &quot;Welder&quot; Prebon called \nand a welder was immediately slapped in his hand. \n\nAfter hours of extensive surgery, a little blacksmith work and a lot \nof sweat, a new foot was attached to Slayer. From the knee down was \nall new hardware. &quot;Replace his Energeon and reattach the spark.&quot; The \nhard part was over, now all that was left was for Blaze to stay and \nfinish up. &quot;Report to me when you&#39;re finished.&quot; Prebon was pleased \nwith his work, and he knew that Blaze could be trusted to complete \nit. \n\n\n"}}
