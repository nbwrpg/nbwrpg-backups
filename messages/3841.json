Her\ninjury began to spew out more mech-fluid as she rolled\nover onto her stomach. groaning, she sat up slowly,\nlooking for Snow Tech, this was not there fight. They\nhad come here to look for Iron, not fight others\nbattles. Finding Iron was her first priority, but,\nthese, these BOTS had injured her, and that pissed her\noff. She scanned the battle field, looking for Snow\nTech, but instead found Iron, in her new 2nd beast\nmode. She grinned,*\n\n &quot; Iron always knew how to pick &#39;em&quot; *She muttered up\nloud*\n\n * She got to her knees, she carefully crawled over to\na pair of bushes. She sat with her back to the bushes\nand got out her little kit that she had with her.\nopening it, she got out a pair of wrist-guns. They\nwhere her favorite weapon and her most deadly. They\nwhere tipped with a deadly virus that would immobilize\nher victim and then slowly shuts them down. If they\nwhere strong enough they would survive, if they\nweren&#39;t,well...... She stood, scanning the field, she\nsaved these babies for emergencies, and this seemed to\nbe one. She saw that Tavatron was fighting two bots\nnamed Hiss and Dark One. To her, one against two\nwasn&#39;t fair, so, she targeted Hiss and fired one of\nher darts. Not looking to see if it hit or not she ran\ntowards Iron, pushing her com-link as she went.*\n\n &quot; Snow Tech, this is Shadow Cat, Try to get to Iron,\nO.K.! I&#39;ll be there.&quot;\n\n* She grinned, just like the old times, she thought.*\n\n * Snow Tech stood there, bored. He sighed, looking at\nthe battle, mabey he should help. Mabey. He looked\naround and saw a really cute bot fighting off two\nother bots. He frowned, it wasn&#39;t fair that it was two\nagainst one! I mean, those two other bots might get\nhurt! He chuckled at his lame joke, and pointed his\ngun at the bot named Dark One and fired a fair sized\nshot directly at his head. That ought to give her the\nadvantage, he thought. Then he heard his sisters\norders over his com-link.*\n\n &quot; Yadda, yadda, yadda. Is that all she does is give\norders? Jezze!&quot;\n\n * But he obediently walked towards the now noticeable\nbot on the other side of the field, hoping that he\nwouldn&#39;t get shot.*\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
