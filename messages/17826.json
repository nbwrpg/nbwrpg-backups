The Trainer chip was being \n&gt; forsed back by the maximal chip, but the maximal chip couldn&#39;t push \n&gt; out the trainer chips programming completely. the two main programs \n&gt; fought head to head and were in a tie as far as trying to push the \n&gt; other program out.  She was now dealing with two very strong \nprograms.\n&gt; \n&gt; She groaned a little inside the chamber and started to wake up. \nShe \n&gt; started to feel like her old self again.  her old Maximal self. \nShe \n&gt; opened her eyes smiled. She knocked lightly on the CR door. &quot;Hello? \n&gt; Can I get out now? I think I&#39;m ok now.  Hello\n\n\n"}}
