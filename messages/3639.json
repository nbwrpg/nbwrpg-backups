He remembered that bot self-destructing in the alliance base....\n\nTaking his launcher in one hand and an automatic in the other, he fires both \nweapons, a missile at Serpentor and several rounds at Unitron.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot runs into the battlefield. The huge bot had left after Zergling and \nNemesis, curious about the battle.\n\nHe jumps behind Sixshot, firing his missile launcher.\n\n"}}
