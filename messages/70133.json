No \n&gt;&gt; comlinks\n&gt;&gt; in or out while this talk is done&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus nodded once as he quickly walked over to one of the control\n&gt; panels on the side and activated a radio dampening field over the\n&gt; room. there would be no communications into or out of the room except\n&gt; through that panel. Cyclonus stood there to monitor the panel, in case\n&gt; anyone had a call for Huydras or anyone else.\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: In other words, if you try to call anyone to or fromthe throne\n&gt; room the call gets fowarded to the panel instead of where it was\n&gt; suppose to go)\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;One of them fell in my trap and the other was capturing while he \n&gt;&gt; attamped\n&gt;&gt; to rescu him... and more over five low rank Autobots and maximals are in \n&gt;&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; grasp right now, among prisioners and reprogramed, not counting the\n&gt;&gt; leaders.&quot; said proudly the predacon leader\n&gt;\n&gt; Deepstryke straightened, obviously impressed. &quot;It would seem that\n&gt; Cyclonus has indeed chosen well. Soon you would have this whole planet\n&gt; and beyond under your dominion.&quot; The large mech said, his voice deep\n&gt; and booming.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; said the female as she sauntered up next to Deepstryke and\n&gt; rested a hand on his broad shoulder, &quot;Unicron seems to have no need\n&gt; for us, I think this place would be rather nice.&quot; She turned and\n&gt; smiled at Hydras as she looked at him speculatively.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now that you have the Autobots, what is your plan of attack now, it\n&gt; would seem that you have the means to do a great many more things?&quot;\n&gt; Deepstryke said as he smiled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus stepped foward a step from the panel, he glanced at Hydras\n&gt; and then spoke, &quot;I think I may have something that could help with\n&gt; that.&quot; Cyclonus looked at the others, &quot;If Hydras agrees, we could once\n&gt; again attempt to recreate the sweep army we had once before, and then\n&gt; with all of our combined power we would brush all the rest of the\n&gt; Autobots and Maximals from this entire planet.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
