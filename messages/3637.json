One \nof his missile launchers fell from his hand.  Raising the other, he fired two \nstinger missiles at Striker.\n\n---\n\nCounter Punch charged in, tripping over a root that was underground, though \npartially above ground but covered by dirt.  Slamming down to the ground, his \nchin hitting a rock, he was a little dazed, but still raised his rifle, \nfiring three bolts off at Ramulus.\n\n---\n\nManterror and Injector approached from the behind the Maximals.\n\n&quot;Le-&quot; Manterror was interrupted as Ramhorn sent a right hook to the Predacons \nface, knocking him to the ground.  Injector quickly kicked Ramhorn in the \nfront of the knee joint.  As Ramhorn yelled in pain and fell, Injector fired \na stinger missile into his chest.\n\n---\n\n\n"}}
