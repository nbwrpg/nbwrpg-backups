Sleep deprivation is an ugly thing. And both Prowl and IR are \n20+ feet tall.\n\n::Prowl/Iron Raptor/Firearm::\n\nProwl roars as he feels Menasor hit the ground, both him and Iron \nRaptor ending up on top of the gestalt. Prowl lifts one foot, \nsmashing it down on one side of Menasor&#39;s back while Iron Raptor does \nthe same on the other side, both bots digging the claws of their free \nlegs into Menasor.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMenasor&#39;s grab gets Firearm&#39;s leg, pulling him down as Menasor falls. \nThe impact of the fall shakes through Firearm, his leg snapping off \nwith a sickening crunch. The Maximal falls backwards, his jetpack \nlaunching him back into the air, his head clear now but the stump of \nhis leg leaking fluid rapidly.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yanshosh, you must of missed Menasors attack on Firearm, he \nshot at\n&gt; him again. Also ,how big are IR and Prowl in the modes they are in.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; Menasor was still staring at his target. He didnt notice someong \nleaping at\n&gt; him. As they grabbed his legs from behind he started to \nstumble, &quot;Who\n&gt; challenges Menasor&quot; he yells, the voice booming around that area. \nThen the\n&gt; second robot grabs him, and he starts to fall forward, &quot;NO&quot; he \nscreams as\n&gt; all 45 feet of metalic monster falls forward towards the rest of the\n&gt; battling robots. His body becomes grounded, hitting the earth very \nhard,\n&gt; causing huge rifts in the earth to go outwards. He lays motionless, \nclose\n&gt; to Firearm, and the rest of the battling factions.\n\n\n"}}
