She \nwanted, more than anything, to go home. But then again, she also knew \nthat she could never truely go home. She started to shake a little. \nShe wrapped her wings aroud her tigher and clung to the cave ceiling. \nShe had the sence that something was going to happen.

And than he wanted peace? He was gifted by the Matrix? \nThis \n&gt; was all too much. And Battera had a point. No peace would come \nuntill \n&gt; the Alliance won the war. And he had to help them. He didn&#39;t \nrealize \n&gt; that this was the programming talking. Deep within Vulois, his \n&gt; original programming fought the chains, and seemed to be succeding, \n&gt; but this reassurane Battera put in about the Alliance drove it back \n&gt; and his current programming stayed in control. He looked up at \nthem, \n&gt; amazed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank You for telling me the truth. And you sharkbot. What is your \n&gt; name? I&#39;m sure I knew once upon a time, but I can&#39;t recall now.&quot; \nThan \n&gt; one of the things Battera had said clicked in him. &quot;Cybertron? Did \n&gt; you say Cybertron? I wanted to go back to Cybertron. That \nmeans....if \n&gt; the old me was going back, than there must be a way I discovered. \nIt \n&gt; must be buried within my Alliance Programming! We could all go \nhome!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
