She runs over and grabs the blade out of Land Mine&#39;s hands.\n&quot;Are you crazy? Don&#39;t go cutting on yourself like that. Geeez. What \nis going through your mental circuits?&quot; She wiped the blade off held \nit out of Land Mine&#39;s reach.\nShe looked at Land Mine. She sighed and spoke with a soft, concerned \nvoice. &quot;Look, if you have someting you want to talk about, why don&#39;t \nwe go for a walk and we can talk alone OK? I don&#39;t want a member of \nmy team hurting themselves like this.  Fighting Maximals will get you \nhurt soon enough.&quot; She motioned for them to go outside. &quot;Please come \nwith me and we can talk about it.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Land Mine frowns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot; Land Mine says. Land Mine already sees herself as \nuseless\n&gt; and ponders for ways of killing herself. Time Bomb is bored as Pit \nand\n&gt; ponders ways to kill himself. Deemos ponders ways to kill himself, \nand so\n&gt; does Inzola. Isn&#39;t this nice? Every one of my characters want to \nkill\n&gt; themselves. (Nothing personal everyone, it was a joke.) Now for the \nreal\n&gt; post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Land Mine frowns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank you, KitKat.&quot; She whispers. She already feels not needed. \nShe walks\n&gt; away slowly and sits in a corner. She pulls out a knife and starts \nto abuse\n&gt; herself with it, slowly cutting her wrists and letting the mech \nfluid flow\n&gt; freely. Hopefully, the mech fluid would run out quick, because she \nwas in\n&gt; lots of pain. Time Bomb walks around to the bunch inside of the \nPredacon\n&gt; cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, where&#39;s Land Mine?&quot; He asks...\n\n\n\n"}}
