She takes a deep breath in and lets it out.\n\nKatya: Simple enough, but risky. Vlad, Ragnar and I are humans stuck\nin mech shells. If the shell dissolves, then the human stays, quiaff?\nMy idea would be to expose us three to the Plague and to isolate us in\na plastic container. This way, we gain our human forms back and you\nare not harmed. The risky part is that I do not know how much we are\nfused with the mech bodies.\n\nYggdrasil: That is crazy! I will not allow you or any other to put\ntheir life in the line of such a disease! What if you are much more\nfused than you think? No, I disagree.\n\nKatya turns to Kup, her eyes almost begging him.\n\nKatya: What do you think Kup?\n\n: : Kup : : \n\nKup turns to face Katya. \n\nKup: What? How? \n\n: : Rodimus Prime : : \n\nJust then, Rodimus comes in. What&#39;s the situation? Are we safe? \n\n Azure The Warrior &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote: \n\nYggdrasil turns wearily. He had heard every bit of the conversation\nand he was not very enthusiastic either about it.\n \nYggdrasil: The first thing we could try is to coat ourselves to\nprotect us from that Plague. Some sort of Anti-rust. I want someone to\ncheck the databanks to know how the Autobots and Decepticons were\naffected and how they overcame it. If Wheeljack can, let him develop a\nvaccine. And Kup, send someone to get Rodimus. He is in the cargo bay\nlooking for a pod, if I&#39;m right.\n \nKatya entered the office at the same moment.\n \nKatya: Wait! That disease you speak of could be our salvation! At\nleast, it could be for Ragnar me and Vlad...\n \n: : Kup : : \n\nKup looks out and sees the rusty haze for himself. \n\nKup: Oh slag! Of all the damn things to happen... \n\nKup slams his fist into a near by computer terminal, putting the ship\non red alert. The alarms sound as the ship seals off, and the\ndeflector shields activate. \n\nHe then opens a comm to every Maximal in the base. \n\nKup: This is security chief Kup. We have reason to believe that a very\ninfections and lethal plague is airborn and heading this way. If you\nare infected you will not notice symptoms at first, but will later\nencounter small glitches, and eventually decay of rust. Do not leave\nthe base untill informed otherwise. \n\nKup runs for the Commanders office. \n\nKup: Come with me Aerotaur. I guess the attack on the Predacons that\nKatya and I were planning will be delayed even more. \n\nHe reaches the office and finds only Yggdrasil inside. \n\nKup: Commander, I&#39;m sure you heard my report over the comm. I&#39;m not\nsure what to do. And where is Rodimus Prime? \n\n\n\n\n"}}
