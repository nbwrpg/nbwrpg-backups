Fear showing itself in her voice.\nShe sat down in the pilot&#39;s chair and prayed to the matrix that the \nship wouldn&#39;t fall. But who knows the fickleness of the Matrix. The \nship rocked to one side and then the other as the wind pushed the \nsmall, helpless craft about. The ship creaked and the branches \nmoaned under the weight of the ship.  Then there was a loud SNAP!!  \nThe front limb broke and the ship tilted downward, nose first.  \nSmidgen screamed as the small vessal went crashing down towards \nearth.  The nose of the ship gave out a sickening crunch as it was \npushed inward.  Smidgen was thrown forward by the force of the \nimpact.  Her body was flung towards the console. She hit the console \nfull on.  The ship was now sticking straight up and down, nose down \nand tail up high.  She muttered, &quot;Thank the Matrix I&#39;m OK.&quot;\nShe started to sit up and look around.  Just as she was looking at \nthe pilots console, the little red light was still flashing. The \nhoming beacon was still going. Things might be picking up she \nthought. Then just as she went to move, a small tool kit that was \noriginally on the wall behind her seat was balancing on the back of \nher chair.  Then if fell, hitting her on the head.  The last thing \nshe remembered was hearing a clanging noise abover her, then the \nworld went black. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}}
