He&#39;d have to keep track of it.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Deep in the frozen continent know as Antartica, A purple portal \n&gt; appears. Exiting the portal is the Violator, which seems to be in far \n&gt; worse of a condition then it was before. All over te outside of ship \n&gt; electricity crackles as explosions occur near the rear of the ship. \n&gt; Inside, Vile struggles with the controls of the Violator trying to \n&gt; regain control of it as it barrels towards the face of the mountain. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vile: &quot;Damn it! The activating of the gate proved to be too much for \n&gt; the ship with its current damages. Skywarp, Methos help me pull up.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The two X-Predacons nod and at their stations pull down on two \n&gt; joysticks. The combined effort worked, the ship flew up the face of \n&gt; the montain narrowly escaping what seemed to be a certain collision. \n&gt; As the ship flew up another explosion occured destroying two of the \n&gt; ships engines sending all three of the X-Preds to the ground. As Vile \n&gt; got up he looked in horror as the ship barreled down towards a sheet \n&gt; of ice. Quickly he opened a transmission to everyone on the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vile: &quot;All men brace form impact were going to crash!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As if on cue the massive ship slammed down against the sheet of ice \n&gt; below it and began to skid across the ice. Once it came to a stop \n&gt; Vile stood and looked around, suddenly the ship began to tremble as \n&gt; the ice beneath it began to crack under the ships weight. a moment \n&gt; later the ice gave way and shattered sending everyone on the ship \n&gt; flying into the air as if there was no gravity. As the ship continued \n&gt; its plunge Vile struggled and pressed a red button causing the ships \n&gt; remaining thrusters to go online. Outside the back of the ship lit up \n&gt; as three thrusters activated and slowed the ships descent before it \n&gt; landed on a large rock surrounded by hot springs with a loud crash. \n&gt; This sent all members of the Vile Force back down onto the ships \n&gt; floors with a loud crash...\n&gt; \n&gt; Elsewhere, above Alliance Island(you know the alliances base), The \n&gt; Infecticon ship the Oblivion floats harmlessly unseen to all scanners \n&gt; and eyes. A moment later the ship dephase shifts making it visible to \n&gt; scanners and eyes again. Inside Frostbite sits with Blight by her \n&gt; side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite: &quot;Bring us into the ocean. We shall let the seas protect us \n&gt; from all and then begin &quot;Operation: Fury.&quot; The fools on the island \n&gt; below wont have a clue of what is going on until it is too late.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Frostbite laughs evily as the Infecticon ship flys about 2 miles from \n&gt; the Alliance base and begins to descend down into the depths of the \n&gt; ocean.\n\n\n"}}
