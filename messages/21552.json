I think the Predacon base can move this one time, as the \nAlliance base also moved. Alliance moved, Preds moved, and I think \nthat should be enough. How about we say that Maximals have a base \nmove left, and put this following rule into effect (I&#39;d like to hear \neveryone&#39;s oppinion on this):\n\nSince the mobile base rule has been really hazy lately, and since \nrepealing it will lead to what was happening before it was put into \neffect, how about we ban anything mobile but one to three bot \ntransports or the like. No shuttles, no subs, not flying bases, no \nspace cruisers, only small transports. That way there&#39;s no way it can \nbe a base (how can a three man transport be a base?).\n\nHow does that sound? It&#39;ll clear alot of confusion.\n\n\nBell just rang, GTG.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; OK, well, then that just shot that idea out the window didn&#39;t it? \nOK, \n&gt; then what would you suggest we have happen at this point to keep \nthe \n&gt; story line going? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (No mobile bases are the rules, whether they attack or not)\n\n\n"}}
