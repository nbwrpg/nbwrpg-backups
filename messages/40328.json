Meanwhile Blight simply smirked at \nDarkfate and then turned and headed towards one of the walls.\n\nBlight: &quot;They will work. Or you will die. As far as I can see its a \nwin-win situation for me.&quot;\n\nWith those words Blight walked through a new opening in the wall that \nsealed itself right back up after he left. He was now once again in \nthe main control room of the complex, and soon a transmission was \nopened to all of Darkfate&#39;s troops, their frequency was also \ndiscovered when Blacknightmare was scanned. He chuckled somewhat \nbefore his message played over the comm lines of every single member \nof Darkfates men.\n\nBlight: &quot;This is Blight, of the Infecticons, your commander, Darkfate \nis now our prisoner. If you do not do as we say, we shall kill him. \nYou are all to stop with whatever you are doing and are to come to \nthe location of this transmission. You will recieve further orders \nfrom me then. If you need a landmark... just hover over the big \nwhirlpool.&quot;\n\nBlight laughed to himself as he then pressed another button. Back in \nthe part of the base Alecto was in, an anti gravity device activated \nbeneath her and sent her flying out of the chamber and back to ledger \nand co. At that point the whirling water vortex greatly shrank \nleaving only a small entry point down to the same sealed off section \nof the base. And still at the bases&#39; center a massive hole was now in \nthe ground but all within the hole was metal and electronics beneath \nthat. And still the nanites continued to build down deeper into the \nalready seemingly bottomless thing.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Blacknightmare/Darkfate::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Blacknightmare felt chaotical energy  struk her but she would \nfight; \n&gt; she had a lot things to live, she had to destroy Vamprah and  the \n&gt; most important: She liked to see Orchestra again. Blacknightmare \n&gt; started to looking for a way to scape... Pain was increasing with \n&gt; every second.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Darkfate smirked and said &quot;I will be a prisioner without worth, \n&gt; unless you try to force the troops that I bring here to work for \nyou.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
