I was out doing Christmas \nshopping.\n\n* Diana giggled as she watched Rion fall over onto his back, swinging her \ntail merrily as she walked up to him a bit.\nShe wore a smile from ear to fuzzy ear, prancing in the sand where she \nstood. Glad to find that they were together and weren�t split apart, still \nwith her best friends, still on this planet.\nBut then she looked at Rion more closely as he stood up and took balance, \nnoticing a small little glint in his eyes.\nShe knew that glint!\nRion was up to something, and Diana gave him a determined little smile and \nnarrowed her eyes as she braced herself. He was good at play fighting, but \nso was she!\nHer tail swung behind her like a kitten that had zoned in on a ball of yarn.\nDiana gave a little playful yowl�the best she could manage at a roar to \nearly in her life, as Rion ran and tried to tackle her. She took the brunt \nof the weight with her shoulders but her back legs sank in the sand and she \nfound herself toppling backward and onto her back.\nShe gave another yowl as she opened her eyes and batted at Rion playfully, \ntrying to push his shoulders back so that she could flip him over but not \nextending her claws.\nSince, in their past combat training, Rion was using his feet to push his \nweight down on her, she would have to weaken or get rid of that base of \nsupport.\nWith her back legs Diana swung them a bit to dig into the sand and under his \nfeet, then bringing them up right under them to catch him by surprise and \nmaybe topple him.\nGet an enemy off their feet and they�re almost helpless! *\n\n� Betcha� I can!�\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
