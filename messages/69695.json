QUICKSTRIDE, MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n\nWithin moments he transfor=\r\nms into his robot mode and runs off in the directon of the shuttle.  Even o=\r\nn two feet he proves swift and wastes no time in getting to his destination=\r\n.\n\nAt the fortress, Rat Trap re establishes his connection to Lord Elder.\n\n=\r\n&quot;Sorry, ran inta interference, I&#39;m back online Lord Elder. I&#39;m about a quar=\r\nter of the way through the base&#39;s pipe system.  But those uglies ain&#39;t givn=\r\n&#39; up on me.  I gotta do somethn&#39; ta distract &#39;em...  Now let&#39;s see....  If =\r\nI was these guys what would I be worried about?  Hmmm, well, defenses for t=\r\nhe most part, and then any circuitry related ta power, computer systems....=\r\n  That&#39;s it.  I bet if I can find a few electrical ports I might be able ta=\r\n pull some plugs here &#39;n there..&quot;\n\nHe uses his nose to smell for a faint el=\r\nectrical smell.  He catches it and crawls into an area where he finds a few=\r\n fine wires.  They&#39;re live, as he senses.\n\n&quot;Paydirt.  Okaaay uglies, now th=\r\nis is where I be getting my sweet revenge.  I dunno what does what, but I b=\r\net if I cut one of these, or a few, I&#39;ll find out.&quot; \n\nWith his buck teeth, =\r\nhe nibbles at a few wires, and manages to snap several.  He waits to see wh=\r\nat happens.\n\nTorture Chamber...\n\nTucson did not say a word.  Yet his expres=\r\nsion says many.  His optics narrowed sharply at Darkhawk&#39;s statement, this =\r\nwould yet be another power surge, due to a shortness in temper, which often=\r\n was the case because he had not always expressed his anger and kept it in,=\r\n most of the time.  He was also fed up with Scorponok&#39;s obnoxious behavour =\r\nas well.  He balls up one fist, and manages to get some power into his all =\r\nwheel drive system to create another power grip on his hand, thus expanding=\r\n his wrist and putting strain on his restraints.  It gets to the point wher=\r\ne hydraulic pressure units within his arms, finally swell to the point wher=\r\ne the restraint on the left hand is broken off his arm.  with that, he now =\r\ngives himself a free hand and without another word, he manages to give Dark=\r\nhawk a very nasty blow to his jaw with a loud smack.  \n\n&quot; You just don&#39;t kn=\r\now when to shut up do you?!&quot;\n\nAnger.  Anger was one of the things Tucson ha=\r\nd wished he never had to show but now was forced into his current mood by D=\r\narkhawk and Scorponok, yet most of his anger he concentrates into his binds=\r\n on the torture device, one hand and one leg at a time, concentrating the a=\r\nll wheel drive power into these areas, which conserves needed energy for th=\r\ne rest of the body.  \n\n&quot; Nothing will make me fold to either one of you.  A=\r\nnd yes, I&#39;m not done fighting yet if that&#39;s what you two think. So before y=\r\nou make snap judgements of me, I caution you two to not judge a bot by his =\r\nframe.&quot;  \n\nHis backup energy supply kicks in giving him just enough energy =\r\nto transform into SUV mode.  He starts up his engine and waits for his enem=\r\nie&#39;s reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;super=\r\ncyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Actually that was Scourge&#39;s blast - but cool =\r\n:)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He starts to send Lord Elder the data relating to his position an=\r\nd location.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorry, I had ta yell because of the sound of the energ=\r\ny blasts. Okay, here&#39;s the skinny sir, we got three trapped Autobots. Night=\r\n Light who&#39;s unconcious, my new pal, Tucson, who came here tryn&#39; ta save Ro=\r\ndimus&#39;s life, even though that lousey heap of scrap doesn&#39;t deserve it for =\r\nthe treachery he&#39;s committed lately and yeah I am reffern&#39; ta Rodimus Prime=\r\n.

PREPARE&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blast!&quot; Lord Elder said as he =\r\noriented sensors in the direction of\n&gt; the Old Maximal Base, &quot;The Maximal b=\r\nase is under attack!&quot; he said. Not\n&gt; that he had seen any actually firepowe=\r\nr exchanged, but he knew how\n&gt; Minions were.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced back at the co=\r\nmputer screen, a pensive look on his face.\n&gt; &quot;God!&#39; he said. &quot;The Predacons=\r\n are not taking advantage of this\n&gt; distraction to attack. Perhaps they hav=\r\ne problems of their with Rat\n&gt; trap there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickstride, go get the s=\r\nhuttle prepped for launch. We don&#39;t have the\n&gt; numbers to fully attack the =\r\nDark Fortress, but maybe we can provide\n&gt; enough of a distraction so Rat Tr=\r\nap can escape, and maybe even rescue\n&gt; this Tuscon that Rat trap spoke of.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as he spoke, Lord Elder was working to bring the Ark&#39;s defenses\n=\r\n&gt; online. There had been a shield here, and he and legacy had been\n&gt; workin=\r\ng to get it in place before all this happened. Now would be the\n&gt; time to p=\r\nut it through it&#39;s tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Tag)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Lord Elder)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
