It was a blue \ncrystal wonderland.  She felt at home with the ice.  She figured this was \nwhere she belonged. On ice.  She flew past some caves and past another \nmountain.  She found a small cave.  She flew tothe entrance and transformed \ninto bot mode.  She walked around inside.  Surprizingly, it was warmer in \nthe cave.  She walked to one of the back caverns and found a small \nhotspring.  This would keep her warm when she slept.  She looked around.  \nthere was a small hole in the ceiling that acted as a vent foe the steam \nfrom the hotspring.  She thought her luck was turning about.  She could hunt \nthe small animals that ran around outside.  And stiil stay warm when she \nslept.  She smiled at her good fortune. &quot;Oh, this cave would be the most \nperfect spot for...&quot; she stopped.  She almost said Lunarpine.  &quot;No, maybe \nnot.  If I&#39;m here, then it wouldn&#39;t do for a warrior like him. No, not at \nall.&quot; She turned and looked up.  She found a small ledge in which she could \nrest on.  She transformed into beast mode and flew up to the ledge.  She \nfell sleep with fitfull dreams.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
