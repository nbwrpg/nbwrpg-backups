The smells of animals he had yet to encounter, but \nseemed familiar.He assumed these were the Maximals. He caught traces \nof burnt trees, and chared earth from thier previous battles, but \nsomehow the wildlife didn&#39;t seem affected.\n\n&quot;I smell something out of the ordinary.&quot;\n\nHe didn&#39;t know ordinary but he knew what he smelled didn&#39;t belong.\n\nHow far till we&#39;re at the Ark? maybe you should call ahead to be sure.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s been a while.

The green was a surprisingly nice change from\n&gt; what he was usedto. the myriad of smells told him he would eat well\n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine followed Shadow Wing toward the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So how longs it been since your last visit?&quot;He asked hoping they&#39;d\n&gt; remember her.He&#39;d hate to be greeted by gunfire.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
