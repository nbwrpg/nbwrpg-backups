He \nthrew the ball at an area only a foot from Shockaract, the ball of energy \nhaving a grenade like affect.\n\n---\n\nMinion yelled out as mutliple weapons send him cartwheeling in jeep mode, \nlanding over ten feet away from where he had been, turned over.\n\n---\n\nChaos activated the large missile launcher in the back of his vehicle mode \n(Missile trailer).  He got a target lock, and fired off a single five foot \nlong missile off at Gigas.\n\n"}}
