I had originally started gunning for a restart 6-7 months \nago, \n&gt; I just never voiced the opinion in a poll, or explained why I \nwanted \n&gt; a restart. Zardus convinced me that a restart wasn&#39;t necessary \n&gt; before, perhaps he was correct, but it&#39;s a little different this \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dewboy: Ok, stop spamming your idea to us about how to end the NBW. \n&gt; =P We understand what you want to do, and we&#39;ll... think about \nit... \n&gt; yes... think about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; RID/BM = pathetic attempts at transformers. G1 all the way! =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jonathan: You had better help/be in charge of role-playing 101. \n&gt; Especially when you just start you don&#39;t want your characters to \n&gt; die. I don&#39;t think that any of my characters have really been in a \n&gt; situation where either mine or Jer&#39;s(rdahl) bots could grab them. I \n&gt; did end up having a few bots half slagged in battle, and Lynxiz has \n&gt; a nasty scar where one of Soulstice&#39;s characters put a spear gun \n&gt; through her back. (she would have died, but other people on that \n&gt; faction took her back to base)\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes fights that should end quickly, don&#39;t and I kinda find it \n&gt; irritating. Example: the Perceptor/Firestrike fight. Firestrike has \n&gt; all the advantage. I kinda wanted it quickly, but Perceptor became \n&gt; psychic, shot the control panel (through Switchblade I might add), \n&gt; and knew every move that both Firestrike and Switchblade were going \n&gt; to do. (sorry airly, but sometimes your fights are a little far \n&gt; fetched)\n&gt; \n&gt; Role-playing 101 will likely be the best thing that could happen to \n&gt; the rpg. We&#39;ll try it, but we&#39;ll need a plan...\n&gt; \n&gt; About car transformers in the rpg. Jer and I brought in the \n&gt; Stunticons and Menasor when we joined. We had some fun causing some \n&gt; chaos. We even tried to get get to the Ark on the moon, but RyoD&#39;s \n&gt; characters somehow &quot;knew&quot; that we were going there, and decided to \n&gt; leave in a spaceship that was convieniently faster than ours. He \nhad \n&gt; also (apparently) planted several million space mines to take out \n&gt; intruders heading for the Ark. Jer and I were both going &quot;Ummm, wtf \n&gt; kinda BW rpg doesn&#39;t have the Ark as part of the conflict&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; LN: When you came into the rpg, your bots, and everything about \nthem \n&gt; was far too powerful. You seemed to have everything planned out so \n&gt; that your characters couldn&#39;t be killed, couldn&#39;t ever come into \n&gt; conflict where the couldn&#39;t win, couldn&#39;t be affected by anything \n&gt; unless you wanted them to. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but that \n&gt; conpletely turned me off from wanting to RP with your characters, \nno \n&gt; matter how good an RPer you were. \n&gt; \n&gt; If we had screwed the naysayers, we&#39;d have restarted 6 months ago \n&gt; when i wanted to originally...\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, if we intend to have a sequel (ie restart with another name) \n&gt; then OOC posts are going to be too much of a problem. However, we \nDO \n&gt; have a messageboard on the website that all people can log in and \n&gt; use. Perhaps we should continues this discussion on on the \n&gt; messageboard. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sequels would be  good. And if we did have one I would come back \n&gt; ass then \n&gt; &gt; there could be a new story. Of course, you would have to end this \n&gt; one first \n&gt; &gt; some how. Yes.... and apparrently Apocalyptic mails are \n&gt; unfavorable. But you \n&gt; &gt; know, you and Hugar are the council members. you control the fate \n&gt; of the RPG. \n&gt; &gt; YOu shouldnt be concerned with how the people are acting, I&#39;ve \n&gt; noticed a \n&gt; &gt; genral decline of posters that were here before, where have \n&gt; Gunthers and \n&gt; &gt; Rudra gone? Heh, I told you before the RPG was becoming way over \n&gt; done but \n&gt; &gt; noone listened. And now you seem to realize it so now I feel I \ncan \n&gt; say... I \n&gt; &gt; told you so.\n\n\n"}}
