The scene \n&gt; looked like a battle was brought out of know but at the same time \n&gt; everywhere. Almost as if the barriers of the dimensions folded \ninto \n&gt; two. SureStrike begins to anlyze the scene. He looks towards \nCooley \n&gt; and says &quot;Well I can pickup Dragos and Argos weapons fired here. \nBut \n&gt; this is confuzing. It is almost as if the other set of weapons \nfire \n&gt; is Identical yet seperate from the Dragos, As if there was a \nclone.&quot; \n&gt; Cooley looked towards SureStrike as if in confusion. &quot;How was our \n&gt; weapons cloned. I mean they are designed to use no traceable \n&gt; signal.&quot; Cooley said. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well there is a way, But that is if we are cloned.&quot; SureStrike \n&gt; replied to Cooley with a concerned look to him. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If that is the case then what are we doing we need to find \nDragos \n&gt; ans Argos before they die. That is if they aren&#39;t already dead \n&gt; themselves.&quot; replyed Cooley. At that they take off again to check \n&gt; the area for scraps and other parts but they find none. They Soon \n&gt; decide to setup a signal to to Report back to the maximal \n&gt; base. &quot;Maximals this is SureStrike, we are done searching section \n43 \n&gt; degrees south by 18 degrees east. We are now moving into the \n&gt; Badlands. Please do not worry bout us. I am setting up this relay \n&gt; station so we could still keep in communication.&quot; SureStrike set \nto \n&gt; the base on a repeat loop. to make sure that any maximal will get \nit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
