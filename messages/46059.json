While in \nthe air \n&gt; he transformed to his bot mode letting loose two shots from his \n&gt; rifle.  The shots hit two trees down by the beach raised up on the \n&gt; cliff a bit.  The trees fell toward the ground making a ramp down \n&gt; into the water.  Before he hit the groudn he transformed again into \n&gt; a JetSki.  Landing in between the two logs he slid into the water \n&gt; and resumed course.  Dunking under the water he shot back up \n&gt; 100 meters later transforming to his ATV with a saw buzzing as he \n&gt; went straight into a groupd of trees.  Moments later he appeared on \n&gt; the ground, trees falling behind him.  &quot;Almostt here&quot; he said.\n\n\n"}}
