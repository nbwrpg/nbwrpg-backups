Fill in the gaps and get the heck \nback to my other story(besides we&#39;ll have to go to Maximal city for \nVeratis to examine Stallex and if none of my characters exist I \nsuppose his conversation with the Mutants is all a figment of \nVeratis&#39;s imagination).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Ok, First of all if you dont want to read an OOC post styop reading \nnow and \n&gt; go to the next IC message. I gave you warning in the subject line \ntoo.\n&gt; \n&gt; No... you cant do two things at once. You never posted for mustex \nleaving to \n&gt; anywhere or arriving anywhere. Or getting the Hover Cycles \nanywhere. Yan told \n&gt; you earlier about having to post for every action taken. And it is \nin the \n&gt; rules. If you dont know the rules will be glad to supply you with a \nlink in \n&gt; this mail and c/p the rule in which it says you must post for \nleaving and \n&gt; arriving in an area. Heh this should actually save the council and \nYan some \n&gt; trouble since Yan is really busy anyways.\n&gt; \n&gt; Link: http://www.nbwrpg.com/rules.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Now for the traveling rule as well as some other rules I believe \nyou are not \n&gt; aware of:\n&gt; \n&gt; #1 Do not manage other people&#39;s characters in any way, shape, or \nform. This \n&gt; means that you cannot control them, post damage for them, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #8 Do not go vast distances in one post. If you&#39;re going from South \nAfrica to \n&gt; Europe, post your char leaving, and in about half a day or so, post \nhim/her \n&gt; arriving.\n&gt; \n&gt; #9\n&gt; The following weapons are banned. If you wish to bring in \nnew/original \n&gt; weapons, get them authorized by the council. You may not have any \nof the \n&gt; following under any condition: \n&gt; any sort of seeking missiles \n&gt; shockwaves and EMP shots \n&gt; flare bombs/flash grenades \n&gt; Weaponry that defies shields of bases and ships\n&gt; (This one I got hit with but its my fault for not following this \nrule in the \n&gt; first place, which reminds me I need to edit some bios...)\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Well I hoped this mail helped you dewboy and I hoped it helped the \ncouncil as \n&gt; well since they don&#39;t need to state the rules a billionth time \nsince I just \n&gt; gave you a link to them. Unless of course you violate the rules.\n\n\n"}}
