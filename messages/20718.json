She wasn&#39;t quite sure what he ment. \nShe scanned his mind and saw just what the virus was and what it \ncould do.  She felt fearful now.  She had thoughts about what would \nhappen if the got into a battle and her blood was spilt. It could \nendanger the planet. She was now a threat. Her worst fear was \nstarting to come true before her eyes. She would no longer ba able to \nfight with Lunarpine, she would have to be caged and kept under lock \nand key as long as she had this virus in her. Her body started to \nshake as fear started to flood her mind.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine smelled the dripping blood and knew that he had to get \nIce \n&gt; back to base quickly. He caught another scent on the wind, another \n&gt; wolf. He knew how to handle this though. He snarled loudly as a \nsign \n&gt; to the scavenger that this was his prize. He knew from pack \ninstincts \n&gt; that the other wolf would recognize Lunarpines size strength, and \n&gt; health as a sign of dominance. Ice wasn&#39;t on the menu tonight.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The clean up drones continued to take care of the virus infected \n&gt; blood. Lunarpine watched as they dusted through his footprints \n&gt; cleaning up all traces of blood. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you know this or \n&gt; not but you just came close to ending us all.&quot; He knew he was \nimmune, \n&gt; he also knew that if the virus would&#39;ve gotten out that every \nfaction \n&gt; on this tiny little world would hunt them down and force them to \n&gt; share the same fate.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
