More of a rusty smell was what this one smelled \nlike at one sniff, probably because people in metal lived here instead.\nD&#39;s ears moved in ever direction, taking in the sounds of computer consoles \nand the constant humm of systems as they worked. This was a noisy world!\nHe turned his head and looked back towards Fenox, wondering just what she \nwas going to show him and if he had ever seen anything similar.\nIn this ship, there were bound to be wonders.\nD bumped his cheek against her shoulder for a sign to move on, eager to find \nout more.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
