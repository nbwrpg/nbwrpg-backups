Why didn&#39;t this body come with a manuel?!!\nShe kept her eyes on Nemisis and narrowed her eyes at him as he pointed for \nScattershot to shot at her as he aimed. Still just laying there.\n\n&lt; What will it take to win this fight?&gt; she thought to herself, but knew \nthat Prowl would hear anyway.\nThere was already a gustalt and the Maximals were fighting like crazy.\nWhat could they do?\nIt was so frustrating!\n\nIron Raptor&#39;s eyes suddenly focused on Nemisis as she saw his weapon power \nup to fire, flipping onto her feet and staggering backwards as the pot shots \ncome raining down, dirt flying into the air.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
