What&#39;s happened?&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot;An explosion on the main bridge! I&#39;m working on it.&quot;\n\n* Iris scans through the main files of the Ark but finds nothing of main \nuse, she then goes through her own files...and a little something that might \nwork came up. She scanned over it and checked off the things that she needed \ndepending if the Ark had it available or not, most of what she needed was \nthere but some of the key things that she required to pull it off.\nIris then began to scan for substitutes, there were some but not many, she \ndownloaded what she could and began to work her magic.\nIt would take a little energy but she knew that it was passable now to \nachieve, if she was permitted to.\nIris automatically opened a channel to Liono&#39;s com-link...*\n\n&quot; Commander, I have located an auto-locater weapon in the roof of the ship, \nmay I have permission to activate it? It&#39;s energy will let off and travel \nalong the walls, it will then target and nutralize any and only Predacon \nsignatures. Almost like a mega-shock wave but only the enemy will be \neffected. Do I have permission?&quot;\n\n* This may be their last line of defence but it was up to Liono to give the \nword, Iris waited patently.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
