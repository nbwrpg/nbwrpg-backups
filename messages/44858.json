He comes from \nan alternate dimension apparently. Yep, and as for destroyng the \nevidence... well thats not going to happen. Very bad choice for a \nlocation to crash a ship.\n\nIC:\nAs Optimus Fury&#39;s ship heads towards what looks to be its \ndestruction. A beam pierces the ocean and engulfs the ship and \nquickly balances it. A moment later the ship dissapears calmly \nbeneath the water as it is dragged by the tractor to its source... At \nthe same time inside of the Oblivion, Optimus Furys signature appears \non the screen since he decided to land on a deserted for now island \nthat the massive ship happened to be off the shore of.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: So like they say my friends you lose.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: A shuttle from the future, in the Angelions time comes out of \n&gt; transwarp space. A beam shoots towards Africa and scans a black \n&gt; panther. Inside the bot is given this beast mode and REFORMATED. He \n&gt; has the same weapons as Optimus Prime in BM except he can only \n&gt; partially absorb the weapons fire. He opens a com link to his own \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot: This is Optimus Fury. I am proceeding toward the inferior \n&gt; Angilions. They will agree to be reformatted or they will join \n&gt; millions of &quot;accidental&quot; deaths since the Maxis and Preds hunted \ndown \n&gt; and destroyed Cheetor&#39;s team and killed most of there followers in \n&gt; attempts to deformat them. Because we are the Malacons. We live in \n&gt; secret, and destroy those inferior to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Comm: Good. Don&#39;t return without a prize, reformatted or dead. Soon \n&gt; with a little elbow grease (lol) we will be 2% of the population \nand \n&gt; the Angelions will still be clueless about us.\n&gt; \n&gt; He proceeds to &quot;destroy the evidense&quot; by aiming his shuttle at the \n&gt; Atlantic Ocean and parachuting out over England. When he lands he \n&gt; goes to Beast Mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; OF: Stealth Mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; Holograms make him look like a real panther.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I made sure he wasn&#39;t illegal, but you can&#39;t accept him \nwithout \n&gt; BM. Try to denig it now.\n\n\n"}}
