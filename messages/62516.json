She looked up as\n&gt; she heard Celeron move about, wondering what he was up to.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Alex &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Celeron regain conciousness.  Again he could not account for the \n&gt; loss of time, almost 70 megacycles had passed and he could not \n&gt; recall what had happened.  He looked around and saw that he was \n&gt; still in the engine room of that ship, the engine he had been \n&gt; working on was repaired almost fully.  This was greatly disturbing \n&gt; to him.  He decided to leave that room and look around to see if his \n&gt; captors were still about....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HA!  Is that all you got?  You boasted such power, such skill!
