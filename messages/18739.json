Dont be concerned with them, \nnot yet.&quot; Turning, she could hear Dark Mouses cries from the other room.\n    If Aracnia could do one thing good, it was to hold a grudge. That little \nvermine was a deserter, she left Aracnia without so much as telling anyone \nelse. Bots like those had one fate in the Predacons......death. Slow and \npainful. Of course she didnt intend to kill her little mouse, not at all, \nactually she was going to let her dangle on her hook until she came running \nback to Aracnia. Then Aracnia would inform her of what ahppens to treachorus \nPredacons....and tell her that she was no better than Megatron. That would \nsend anybot into a downward spiral of self hate and depression. Aracnia \nfrowned......what a waste of liquid energone too.\n    &quot;So, Kitkat, as I was saying......Our groups should unite. Under your \ndirection of course. Im willing to comply with you so that the Predacons can \nonce agian be united. If you want to come to my base and check that out it \ncan be arranged, anything you need I shall provide you with.&quot; Black Aracnia \nsaid, tring to ignore that idiot Starscreams rants and raves about her true \nintentions......bots like those got an even worse death than deserters....\n    Aracnia smiled, a rare event, &quot;Will you require time to think about this, \nCommander?&quot;\n\n    Nighteyes limped through the forest, turning at Aracnia cruiser. Mech \nfluid was pouring out of her like a fountian. Megatron had shot her in the \nthigh.....and she needed a CR chamber. Hell Beast cast her out for being a \nfemale, and said it would lead to internal conflict. The closest base was \nKitkats.....and she knew she would be recived very well, but death was apon \nher like the sunset was apon the land.\n    She got to the door, and fell, scratching her claws agianst the door. \n&quot;Help, please! S.O.S.! Help me, someone!&quot; She cried in vain....time was \nshort, and she began to feel light headed.\n\n"}}
