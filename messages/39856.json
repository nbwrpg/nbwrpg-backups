There he was,\nstranded millions of lightyears away from home, without his binary\npartner, beside a ship of Autobots. &quot;I&#39;m real dead.&quot; he whispered\nquietly. He turned around, and looked down at Slugslinger&#39;s bashed up\nbody, and he sneered. He pulled his leg back, and gave SLugslinger a\ngood kick. &quot;Wake up.&quot; he shouted. Maybe he should try to find the\nothers, but how? he couldn&#39;t fly, and who knows what creatures inhabited\nthis planet. For the first time, since he joined the Decepticon army, he\nfelt very much alone. He looked down towards the ground, but lifted his\nhead sudenly when he heard a noise over a hill. He quickly rushed up to\nit, his laser pistol pulled, and peered over it.\n\nOver the the rough terrain, a red earth vehicle, dated to about 1984,\nCaliburst guessed, traversed the terrain quickly. But if his internal\ncircuits were right, they werent in 1984, they were much further back.\n&quot;Autobot.&quot; He whispered to himself, as he slid back down the hill to\navoid detection. He cocked his rifle, and turned around to crawl back\nup, and took aim on the ever closing in car. His fingers quivered, his\njaw chattered, as his finger pulled back. The laser flashed from the\nbarrel of his pistol, and ripped throught the air, then through metal of\nCliffjumper&#39;s hood. Cliffjumper screams filled the valley, as he\nswerves, blinded by the pain, and rolls on to his roof, wheels still\nspinning madly. Caliburst ducks back down, and smiles at the Autobots\nscreams of pain..\n\n"}}
