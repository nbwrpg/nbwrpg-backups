Rodimus then leaps at Cyclonus with all the force his\n&gt; legs would give him. He attempts to &#39;spear&#39; aka &#39;football tackle&#39; his\n&gt; enemy.\n\nCyclonus&#39; face traces a small smile as Rodimus dodges his first attack,\nand only the sand feels the full brunt of Cyclonus&#39; failed attack. Yes\nindeed, Rodimus may still be a worthy opponant. \n\nWith a grunt Cyclonus absorbs the full brunt of Rodimus&#39; attack, and\nturns it! With a spin and twist Cyclonus rolls back, carrying Rodimus\nwith him, spinning the Autobot back over him in a sacrifice throw,\nattempting to send Rodimus sailing through the air. As smooth as ever\nCyclonus continues to roll, sweeping smoothly to his feet. He turns to\nface Rodimus, ready for the Autobot&#39;s counter. For the first time a\nsmall chuckle escapes him, Cyclonus does enjoy a good battle.\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus)\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet easy, one-click access to your favorites. \nMake Yahoo! your homepage.\nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n\n"}}
