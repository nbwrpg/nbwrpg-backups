Usually when A predacon \nwants to sit and talk it&#39;s so reinforcements could arrive. He was \noutnumbered 2 to 1 and still standing. he walked over to where kitKat \nwas and sat. &quot;OK what would you like to talk about? I know how bout \nthe sintronic cybers Cyberball team I think they could go all the way \nthis year.&quot; he was being a smartalec but he had to try to keep them \noff gaurd as long as he could.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed back to bot and looked at FoxFingers. &quot;Now, will \nyou \n&gt; quietly sit down here and talk?
