Both physical forms having \ndisappeared, and the new shell forming, Megatron&#39;s spark truely \nfeels fear. He wonders whether this is going to end up as his last \nfight... and he is ultimately surprised to find out that he senses \nvaguely the same thoughts coming from Galvatron.\n\nNow structure of the new body was beginning to take shape. Powerful \nlegs, arms, and torso developed themselves. Two sleek dragon-like \nheads began to sprout from equal distances on the top of the torso \nbetween his central head. A wire covered form of a new bot was \nbarely visible inside the fluctuating energon sphere.\n\nOnce the critical layer had been completed, the outer shell began \nforming. Sharp talons hardened on his feet and on his hands. \nStarting on his feet, dark scales begin to appear being created in \nsucession as they creep up his legs and onto the rest of his body. \nEach scale changes colour from the top to the bottom of it. The top \nof the scale is black, then its colour slowly changes into blood red \nat the bottom leaving his entire robot form looking heavily \narmoured, sleek and dangerous.\n\nHis powerful hands are black, and has jagged claws which protrude a \nbit from each finger joint like small claws. The blood red scale \nends make it look like he&#39;s always just punched something organic. \nThe large dragon bot&#39;s feet resemble the rest of his scaled body, \nexcept that their tips are sharpened points. Effective beast mode \ncombat weapons. His head has a moderately sized crown on top, and \nblood red linked scale streaks that start just between his eyes, \ncurve up over his eyes and flow backwards along the side of his head \nand stop just past the back of head, giving him an exceptionally \nevil look. His face below the blood red scale streaks, is covered \nwith a layer of smaller scales which seem to flow from the start of \nthe streaks down below his eyes, and off behind his head always \nbelow the scale streaks. \n\nOn his back, two large wings frames begins forming. A lighter \nelastic web-like version of the scales forms along the wing \nskeleton. The wings become enveloping black covers, with fiery red \nat their edges. As the wings were forming, two two wire tails form \non his back and quickly became covered with an armoured layer of \nscales. The two tails, which have a sharp knife ending of energon, \ncan be combined to make on larger type energon sword in robot mode. \n\nThe Energon sphere is begining to become diffuse, and transparent, \nall it&#39;s energy used up...\n\nooC: Take it away Mr Smith. =p\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; Galvatron seemed almost screwed over. Literally, and his eyes \nshowed it as \n&gt; Megatron powered up his gun. The betrayal of Empath had left him \nvulnerable. \n&gt; This Megatron was not worthy of such a kill. The jewel on his \nchest powered \n&gt; up as much as it could with the distraction of Empath&#39;s powers. It \nwould have \n&gt; been enough to keep him from being annihilated but escape would \nhave been his \n&gt; only option. Then the light came. From the blip he had felt from \nMegatron&#39;s \n&gt; body. It engulfed him and Megatron. He suddenly felt his body \ndissolve. His \n&gt; spark being the only thing remaining. He  saw Megatron&#39;s body do \nthe same. \n&gt; There sparks both engulfed by this artifacts light that was now \nspinning \n&gt; in-between the spark. He felt a new shell being formed around the \ntwo sparks. \n&gt; For the first time..Galvatron was afraid.\n\n\n"}}
