No appearent activity.  He \nchuckled to himself, they were definanetly unorganized.  He wanted \nto see exactly who was down in that little bunker of a base, but the \nMatrix in his chest could not connect to Vector Sigma in this time.  \nCould it?\n&gt; &#39;No, in this time Vector Sigma is still offline.  I won&#39;t be able \nconnect and see who is here.&#39;\n&gt; &quot;I grow impatient!  Show me some spinal support columns!  Or are \nyou just like the Quintessons, soft and weak?!&quot;\n&gt; The fusion cannon slowly powered up, and Megatron Revived took \naim.  He aimed at a rock formation two hundred yards from the base.\n&gt; &quot;A thirty percent blast should grab their attention, heh heh heh.&quot;\n&gt; The cannon powered to thirty percent and the massive blast was \nissued forth.  The massive violet beam struck the formation and mere \nseconds later a tremendous explosion rocked the ground.  The tall \ndust cloud greeted the grinning clone, he never powered up the \ncannon to this extent.\n&gt; &quot;Is there anyone home?  Or am I just wasting my time?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; MaximaSR74@a... wrote:\n&gt; In a message dated 5/22/04 11:35:28 PM Central Daylight Time, \nairly2002@h... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It CAN&#39;T BEE!!!!&quot;Snarled Hydras while he took off the \n&gt; microphone &quot;I&#39;M MEGATRON AND GALVATRON IN ONE!!!!! HOW COULD BE \n&gt; THAT?????... MAXIMA!!!!! Took this helmet and use it... as well as \n&gt; thjis gloves and microphone... you will control electronic-puppet \nad \n&gt; you will pretend to be me to deceive Lord Vykos other pred \nleader... \n&gt; Find out my dear what doeas he pretends... WHIL I CRUSH THAT FALSE \n&gt; BOT THAT PRETEND TO BE ME!!! &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Grabbing his arm, &quot;WAIT! Would not be wise!&quot; pausing awaiting his \nreaction. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allow me to go. Perhaps he is not aware of your presence & who \nyou are. If he is who he claims.. he would recognise who I am.&quot; Her \nvoice stern & as logical as possible. Hydras was playing a dangerous \nenough game with Vykos. Another challenger made it all the worse. \n&gt; But she was bound & determined that the one in Leadership would be \nthe one she trusted most.. the one was TRULY Megatron. & Hydras was \nhe. \n&gt; \n&gt; Gazing up at Hydras with her crimson optics.. attempting to \nconvince him. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
