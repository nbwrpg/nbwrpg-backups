He frowns, walking off to the storage rooms (or wherever he was supposed to go) as instructed. They were barely off Cybertron and the mission was already going to the pit.\n\nHe reaches the storage rooms, entering and hearing a banging noise, turning to see dents forming in one of the doors. He frowns, walking to the door. Dion puts his hand on the door and concentrates, the hand beginning to heat up at an increadible rate untill his fingers melt through the door and he rips his hand back, taking the door with it and instantly aiming a large rifle at the bot beyond it.\n\n&quot;Who in the pit are you?&quot; he asks, a bit drained as he looks at Crotale.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; OOC:Hey everyone I am back, yea you can stop cheering now, really \n&gt; (pss don&#39;t stop keep cheering) no really stop oh thank you.  Ok\n&gt; Crotale continued to pound on the door.  Small dents began to show \n&gt; through the metal. Someone must notice them soon. \n\n\n"}}
