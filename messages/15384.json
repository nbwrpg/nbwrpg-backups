He was alone again. He was\n&gt; healed on the inside, and was now fully consious. The mech fluid had\n&gt; stopped leaking, but there was still a problem: He had no arm. Almost\n&gt; as if the thought triggered it, Fliq began to feel an enormus surge\n&gt; of energy go throgu his body. He knew what it was. This is the same\n&gt; kind of feeling he got when he was inside Brix, and he became the\n&gt; centaur. But this one was going a bit different. His arm started to\n&gt; regenerate, and when it did he was fine, but other changes occured.\n&gt; His fur started to lighten, until it was almost completly white. And\n&gt; too cap it off, two massive horns greww out of his head. Fliq had\n&gt; become a fuzor. Part fox, part Ram.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Brix had been watching this, and gaped in magnificance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;By the Matrix.....&quot; Fliq stirred a little, and opened his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey Brix. How&#39;d it go?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re okay! That&#39;s great! How Ramulus doin?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ramulus. That was a weird trick he did. I saw HIS life flash before\n&gt; my eyes. Except I didn&#39;t have eyes. But I&#39;ll ask.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq focus&#39; a message into his body.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus?
