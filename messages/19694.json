This wasn&#39;t a cat he was looking at \n&gt; but a seemingly large and peturbed wolf. &quot;OKAY theres no need to be \n&gt; hasty, I&#39;m sorry about that over reaction.&quot; he didn&#39;t know what \nelse \n&gt; to do it was either beg for mercy or run like the devil himself was \n&gt; after him. Options were extremely limited right now, either run and \n&gt; risk the autoguns or try and talk his way out of trouble. He \n&gt; transformed back to bot and set his pistol down at his side. &quot;Easy \n&gt; there, I&#39;m sure we can come to some sort of arrangement.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
