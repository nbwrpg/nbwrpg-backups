There are \nquite a few people in the RPG who are set severely against that. If, however, \nno one has any problem with it, I&#39;ll repeal my decition.\n\nAs to Bob Skir, I can&#39;t believe this is actually happening! I didn&#39;t think \nthat we were this important! He&#39;s welcome to email me, but how do we know its \nthe real him?\n\n::Ramulus::\n\nRamulus spins around, his hand on his gun as he looks at the trainers. His \neyes narrow as he sees Spears in their grip.\n\nRamulus takes a few steps forward, watching the enemy carefully. He reaches \ninto a compartment with his free arm, bringing out a device.\n\n&quot;I have a holo-map right here,&quot; he yells over to them, holding up the device, \n&quot;I&#39;ll exchange it for Spears. I&#39;ll still meet you for Striker, though, if you \nwish. You can return him to me then.&quot;\n\n"}}
