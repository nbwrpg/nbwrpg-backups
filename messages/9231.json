But he paid it no mind, just found it annoying, disturbing \nhis rest. He stretched out, arching his back, and rested again. He had no \ntrouble getting back to sleep.\n\nHe dreamt of Blackarachnia. He dreamt of them in the Darkside. He could \nalmost smell the lava that sometimes lingered in the base, and he could \nalmost smell Blackarachnia. He could hear her voice, but he couldn&#39;t make \nout much of what she said.\n\nHe went to touch her, but she backed away, grinning; just like her games. He \ntried again, and this time she moved to his side and kicked his leg \nplayfully. Quickstrike thought of it fun now. He knew it was a dream, but he \nwish it was real. He wanted to be with Blackarachnia again.\n\n&quot;Told ya you&#39;d make it,&quot; he heard her say.\n&quot;What?&quot; he returned, a little confused why she said that. He was expecting \nsomething different from her. He stepped closer, and this time she stayed \nstill. He watched her figure. He couldn&#39;t make out everything. He moved in \nuntil they touched shoulders.\n\nHis moment of contempt didn&#39;t last long, something dark busted through the \nwall of the hallway, and slammed him against the other side. He saw it, \ncovered in the darkness, the Vok wolf. He opened its jaws to bite down on \nhim.\n\n&quot;NO!&quot; Quickstrike jerked up out of his sleep, kicking at the air.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
