The original transformers had Vehicle modes. You \napparently \n&gt; have seen much G1 or else you would no that. And nothing would be \nbiased. \n&gt; Small factions of Maximals would be united under one banner, ditto \nFor \n&gt; Predacons and Decepticons, and everything else. Noone would be \nbiased. Things \n&gt; would be much better as noone would continue to attack each other \nover and \n&gt; over. Senidng them to a different planet would ultimately create the \nsame \n&gt; problem now, eventually nothing would develop other than fights.\n\n\n"}}
