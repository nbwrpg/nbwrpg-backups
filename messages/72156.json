Moving in and around trees and across open terrain he is\nable to draw them further and further away.\n\nSLAG is able to muster up a good bit of ground speed even over the\nroughest of landscapes, but he is more ponderous that the quicker\nmoving SUV. And SLUDGE, is well SLUDGE. Large and powerful but not\nnessesarilly fast moving in beast mode.\n\n&quot;Me sludge think vehicle is too fast!&quot; SLUDGE said as he ran as\nswiftly as he could after NIGHTSHIFT.\n\n&quot;Well slow him down!&quot; SLAG said as he ran.\n\nSLUDGE stopped and thought for a moment and then began to stomp his\nfeet on the ground sending ground quakes at NIGHTSHIFT causing small\nfissures to open up NIGHTSHIFT, most of them 6 feet long and three or\nfour feet deep each!\n\nAt the same time SLAG stopped and just opened his mouth sending 3000\ndegrees Celcius flames at the hopefully floundering or atleast\ndistracted SUV!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOn 9/9/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot; Ohhh SCRAP!&quot; Here we go! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With a quick screetch of the tires, Nightshift speeds off to try and divert\n&gt; Slag and Sludge away from the main group.
