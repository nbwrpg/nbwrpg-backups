Again.  &quot;Black&quot; is the color the Rogues generally \nuse for their insignia.  &quot;Death&#39;s head&quot; is just a fancy term for a \nskull.

It&#39;s \n&gt; in the yahoogroup&#39;s files section. Feel free to take a look at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not quite a basic skull, but it might be what you were \nthinking \n&gt; about. *doesn&#39;t know what black death&#39;s logo looks like*\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I uploaded a nice and big Inuyasha gif that I made a few days \n&gt; ago while... well, procrastinating etc etc. So you can also take a \n&gt; look at that if you want. It could get a little choppy on older \n&gt; computers, it didn&#39;t actually make it quite userfriendly, i just \n&gt; threw it together.\n\n\n"}}
