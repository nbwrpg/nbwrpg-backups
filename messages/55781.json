He got up and wandered the \nhalls. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; found the main communications room and sat down. He picked up \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanner headset and put it on. Next, he started to adjust some \nof \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dials to start picking up most predacon frequencies and some of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximal frequencies. He listened to the scanner and hoped he \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; find out what was going on.\n\n\n"}}
