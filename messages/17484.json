She hadn&#39;t realized that that her actions were that \nof a maximal.  She looked at Drillbit. &quot;Yeah, but then, would you \nrather we did nothing and no longer exist?&quot;\n\nFeline::\nChuckling at HotRod&#39;s comment, she hooked up a small cable to the \nback of his mind and hooked him up to the mainframe.  She walked \naround the console and stood facing the console, with HotRod laying \non the table a few feet away.  She pressed a few buttons and started \nto download all the information from HotRod&#39;s memory banks.  She \nsmirked and pressed a few more buttons, sending a sleeping program to \nHotRod. He should sleep for a few hours, she thought.  She knew that \nthe downloading of all the info would take a while.  And she knew how \nHotRod&#39;s mind worked. He&#39;d get bored quickly and to make things \neasier on all, she wold just have him sleep for a while.  When he&#39;d \nwake up, he&#39;s only feel refreshed and lively.  She started wondering \nif she really cared about him.  She had to admit to herself that she \nfelt something, but under the Predacon code, you didn&#39;t care for \nanyone.  But she had to admit that she felt something. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He cought up with KitKat, and walked next to her, still in insect \nmode.\n&gt; &quot;So Megatron is trying to wipe us all out.
