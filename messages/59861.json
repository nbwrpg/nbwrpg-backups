His luck had been with him for \nthe Maximals and Predacons had returned in a mass of glory and the Pred \nhad been estatic, returning to his rightful place next to Megatron.\n\nNow that Megatron had become Hydras, the bug bot had still stayed at \nhis side, even if he did change and maybe become a bit meaner. But he \nwould still be a faithful Predacon. The large metal wasp buzzed about \nthe base, dropping to land on a nearby crate of some bots. &quot;Wazzpinator \nhelp,&quot; the bug bot buzzed. &quot;Wazzpinator help other botzz  build.&quot; \nWasipinator gave a flutter of his wings. &quot;Wazzipinator do good, not be \nblown up.&quot;\n\nOOC: This was a post that was directed to some bots that were deciding \nto build a weapon... I can&#39;t remember who they were sorry. Maybe \nsomeone could just stumble upon our little bot that would be good too \nlol\n\nOMWOS\n\n\n\n"}}
