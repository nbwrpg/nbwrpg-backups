Soon he knew the location and \nweaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n\n&quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re under attack.&quot; \nhe says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs out of the \nbase. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then activates the \ndefences.\n\nThe round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, and then a \ndeafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other than the ones \nthat the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the screech shut off, and \na jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications that the enemies \nmight have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the Element fired at \nthe hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one missile, and \nfive plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were shielded by the \nCybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one shielded :).\n\n\nMantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was immediately ready \nfor battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. A missile flew \nout of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to hit \nRippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could see Aqua firing \nhis spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried to get during \nthe last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at Rippersnapper. \nMantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped that she \nwouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n\n&quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then we&#39;ll form \nElement and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his team over the \ncommlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his missile launcher \nand fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, firing three \ncharges down at Autofire.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
