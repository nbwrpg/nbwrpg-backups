It\n&gt; would just be useless to \n&gt; have them come in since animorphs are not in any way\n&gt; affiliated with \n&gt; Transformers aside from their cards saying\n&gt; Transformers. ALthough a Hork \n&gt; Bajir with a robot mode instead of the cantuarish\n&gt; mode it has would be cool. \n&gt; THats like the only good Animorph toy I have.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
