Switchblade just finished making the \nauto \n&gt; guns and other base defenses. Otherwise it&#39;s a sitting duck. The \n&gt; armour however is heavy, and can take quite a bit of punishment \n&gt; before hurtin too much. =p (read the ooC at the end as well)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Megatron --\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron grumbles as the Predacon base is splayed with weaponfire \n&gt; from two sides. &quot;Note to self, repair sensors, and set up base \n&gt; defenses.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; He starts into a brisk walk as he heads to the base exit. He opens \na \n&gt; commlink to Switchblade, &quot;Switchblade, look around in the storage \n&gt; bay, there might be something we can use down there. We&#39;re in a bit \n&gt; of a pinch right now.&quot; He reaches the exit, and stops short.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron frowns as he opens a basewide commlink, &quot;Preceptor, \n&gt; Waspinator, Inferno if you&#39;re active, Quickstrike, Warhead, and all \n&gt; other Preds prepare for battle, this could get messy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The outer sensors pick up Tyreal&#39;s ultimatum. &quot;Hah!&quot; Megatron \nlaughs \n&gt; sarcasticly, &quot;Turn myself in... of course I&#39;m not going to agree to \n&gt; that slag...&quot; He switches to external speakers, &quot;I don&#39;t care who \n&gt; you are. Who would agree to such terms... Bewarned, if you stay \nhere \n&gt; and bother me, your lives are forfeit. You get one warning before \n&gt; death, so I hope you choose wisely.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He closes the external comm, and opens another comm to \n&gt; Switchblade. &quot;Switchblade, found anything yet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblade grumbles when he gets Megatron&#39;s first comm, &quot;Ya ya, \ni&#39;m \n&gt; looking.&quot; He fiddles around with the nearest sealed container, \n&gt; hacking the passlock, and disableing the protections. Inside he \n&gt; finds a bunch of energon pulse weapons, a newer Tripred design, \n&gt; although he&#39;s unsure how effective they are. \n&gt; \n&gt; He moves onto the next sealed crate, and is about to open it when \nhe \n&gt; gets Megatron&#39;s second message. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m looking, so lemme \n&gt; alone for a bit. You&#39;ll know if i find anything.&quot; He starts working \n&gt; on another sealed crate, wondering why his hacking process is \ntaking \n&gt; a little longer than before...\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: One more thing, the Preds are few right now, so without \n&gt; intervention, they may get a sever ass kicking. =p I&#39;d like to \n&gt; propose starting a base storyline which starts with the artifacts \n&gt; which are located in the Predacon storage bay right now. The ones \n&gt; which none of the bots know about, or what they are. Something that \n&gt; would involve triggering an effect of the artifact, which would \n&gt; cause the Predacons to win the battle, but maybe the artifact could \n&gt; switch hands, and then a sort of power struggle would ensue.\n\n\n"}}
