So before you make snap judgements of me, I caution you two to not judge a bot by his frame.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; His backup energy supply kicks in giving him just enough energy to transform into SUV mode.

You barely have the energon\nreserves to transform, never mind fight us!&quot;\n\nScorponok&#39;s shoulder-mounted cannons oriented themselves on Tuscon,\n&quot;But if you want to do this the hard . . .
