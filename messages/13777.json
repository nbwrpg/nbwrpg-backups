Also, I have only been \nhere\n&gt; for two months, so I havn&#39;t seen all the changes of the RPG. But I \nam\n&gt; going to try and say something, so here goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most RPGs do not make it over 20 members, and only last a few \nmonths.\n&gt; Here we are, one year, and nearly 50 members. Over the summer, we\n&gt; averaged a post every 30 seconds. What does this all mean? It means \nthat\n&gt; Neo Beast Wars RPG is the greatist Transformers RPG, if not the \ngreatist\n&gt; RPG there is. Lets all work to make it even better.\n&gt; HAPPY BIRTHDAY NBWRPG!!!\n\n\n"}}
