I had been fairly occupied lately and I have seemed to miss the post in which you had sent two missiles towards Dinobot. So, please do not get cross. I shall be sure to mention them in THIS post. Again, I am sorry.)\n\n* Dinobot could feel Tavatron shift and move against his armor-plated back, wondering slightly as to what she could be up to.\nBut as he brought the cool water into his mouth and drew it down his throat he happened to glance at the reflective surface of the water. And, just happened to see small twigs and sticks fly from Tavatron�s position upon his back, then looking back towards his own reflection and continued drinking.\nHe had never understood fembots and their need for cleanliness, something in which they ALL participated. Some more then others.\nHowever, he had never TRIED to understand them either. Finding their complicated and complex ways of life too puzzling for his simple mind, something that he was just fine with.\nA bit of dirt and grime had never bothered him one little bit, knowing that it could be used as camouflage as well as an agent that could cool an over heated body.\nBut he couldn�t blame any female for having the need to be clean, knowing that he could only take so much before HE TO was forced to get the grit out from between the joints.\nA warrior may be as hard as rock and as cold as ice�but that was still no excuse to look AND smell like a rancid and decaying swamp!\nSuddenly Dinobot raised one brow-plate at that thought, if they continued towards their final destination they would BOTH look and smell like a rancid swamp�because they were both going to have to go THROUGH one.\nThere was no going around it, knowing that it would take a good solar-cycle to get from one side to the other.\nAnd he couldn�t go over it with the same maneuver he had pulled with the forest trees, the dried trunks of the dead trees would snap easily and both Tavatron and himself would plummet into the gunk.\nNo, that had to go THROUGH the gunk!\nIt would be a bit slow going but no vehicle tire or treat could go through such slop, the air was to moist to allow any flyer to travel above, and if the enemy followed on foot they would either be as slow as them or simply sink into it�s mucky depths.\nIt was the perfect escape route.\nDinobot sighed as he took in another gulp of water, then looking towards another reflection as it appeared over his back. Tavatron�s reflection looked down upon the babbling surface of the stream, simply watching the image of her until the rising swarm of butterflies lifted into the air and caught her attention.\nDinobot lifted his head slightly from the water but continued to watch the reflection of Tavatron, water droplets falling from the end of his snout as he watched her bat at the flying insects playfully. \nSuddenly his scanners alerted him of yet another presence within the grove, one in which was uninvited and extremely unwanted. Identifying the intruder as Hekabuscon, a new bot to his data logs but if he was firing then he was an enemy none-the-less.\nWith a rather annoyed sigh he looked up from the water and slowly turned his head towards the enemy just as Tavatron dove from his back, his eyes focusing on the missile in which Hakibuscon had sent�just a little too late!\nDinobot growled in annoyance and growing anger as the missile dug in and exploded on impact upon his shoulder, backing a few steps from the sheer force of the blow. A shower of splintered armor and mech-fluid erupted outwards, leaving a gaping wound that reviled the joint mechanisms beneath the plates.\nEmotionless eyes glared towards Hakibuscom, an emotionless expression reflecting that in which the eyes told. However, within those cold eyes dwelled the rage of a warrior that had killed more bots that he had lived days!\nDinobot noted Tavatron�s location with less then a glance before locking eyes with the enemy again, fluid running from his clawed hand and staining the greenest of grass red.\nIt just had to happen, didn�t it?!\nAn enemy of force finally entering into the one place in which he had ever thought as actually beautiful, in the one place that really made one almost believe that there was no such thing as war and death!\nBut now it had been invaded by a shadow that brought death into a small piece of paradise in which had never known such evil.\nIt was a shame, a dear, dear shame.\nBut if he could help it he was going to end whatever battle this bot wanted to start and look back and see this very glade intaked, as if evil never existed.\nHowever, there was one thing that rose above his concern for the preservation of such natural beauty, the preservation of another beauty�that of the spark of a bot he had risked life and limb to rescue from the clutches of the enemy Alliance.\nAnd if he could keep Tavatron from sustaining fatal damage then the glade was nothing more then a sparkling whisper in the back of his mind; that would remind him in the future that there WERE such places in which one could retreat and forget all evil�if one dared to find it.\nBut he cared for her, as a fellow warrior and as a friend, and perhaps, one-day when the block of ice melted from around his own spark and the darkness faded from his mind, as something more.\nTavatron was his friend, one of few he had ever known and intended to keep.\n\tWith a snarl of pent-up rage Dinobot took two extreme strides towards Hakibuscon and transformed into robot mode on the second, swiping the second missile away to explode somewhere in the distance, then walking right up to the bot and stopping only when they were less then five feet apart.\nThe past mood in which had been nothing more then lightheartedness was now completely gone from his features, now as rock solid and tense with anger as it had always been in the past.\nTHIS was the REAL Dinobot!!\nHe narrowed his optics to mere slits as he growled deeply, his tail swaying in extreme annoyance from behind. The pain of his wounds only feeding his anger.\nHis voice was harsh and cold�*\n\n� Unless you wish to feel the cold steel of my claw pierce your spark, I suggest you leave!�\n\n* There was no hint of sarcasm in his voice at all, only the coldest fact that could turn the hottest inferno into ice!\nAnd this was no threat, it was a promise!* \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
