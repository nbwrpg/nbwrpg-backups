Terrorsaur looks like a strong flyer.  He&#39;ll \nmake it by nighfall most likely.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike took the sheet of paper in between his long fingers. He \nchuckled \n&gt; at Dark Mouse. &quot;He never met Hell Beast. Th&#39; only bot he ever came \nin \n&gt; contact wit&#39; was me.&quot; He turned and made a short whistling noise to \n&gt; Terrorsaur&#39;s direction. He waved the red flier over to him. He \nlifted his \n&gt; head, and flew over to him reluctantly. He transformed to robot \nmode in \n&gt; front of him and folded his arms.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah got uh job fer ya,&quot; Quickstrike said. &quot;Ah want ya t&#39; go t&#39; \nthese \n&gt; coordinates and find uh bot named Rowdy Wolf. He&#39;s uh big dang bot \nwit&#39; furs \n&gt; all over &#39;im. Ya can&#39;t miss &#39;im.&quot; He handed Terrorsaur the paper \nwith the \n&gt; coordinates. &quot;Ya might find &#39;im by his cave. It&#39;s north of th&#39; last \nmarker, \n&gt; past uh dead long tree. There&#39;s uh whole bunch of rocks, hills and \nboulders \n&gt; near there. But keep yer eye out on &#39;im. He&#39;ll shoot ya.&quot; \nTerrorsaur&#39;s brows \n&gt; lowered on him. &quot;Jus&#39; say ya know me an&#39; we need him here, then \nyou&#39;ll be \n&gt; fine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike nodded his head to the side and waved him off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur studied the coordinates for a moment. He gave a glance \nat him. He \n&gt; had a feeling the flier knew it was a long trip. He watched as the \nflier \n&gt; took off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike turned his body back to Dark Mouse. &quot;How long do you \nthink uh \n&gt; trip like that might take uh flier? Two days? It took me four days \nfer me t&#39; \n&gt; get back from there.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
