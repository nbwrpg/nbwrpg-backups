He pulls out his sword and stabs it right \ninto Koj&#39;s chest so the could go into back-up plan. He kicked Spears \nout of the way of the beam, letting it zoom past her by inches. Now \nit was back-up time. He sent a message to everyone.\n\n&quot;Yes, open fire! Come down Slayer! Everyone else! Ignatius, Savage, \nbarage from the skies! Hammer, Blaze, Bullet! Come down and focus on \nwhere the fire is coming from, and shoot!&quot;\n\nPretty soon this forest was filled with weapons fire. Ignatius and \nSavage were sending lasers and fireballs down to the ground. Blaze \nHammer and Bullet each fired in a direction that firing was coming \nfrom. (Bullet was firing at proto, Hammer at Firearm and Blaze at \nSnowCat.) This gave Prebon the opportunity to try and get away. He \npulled out the two cloaking devices he had saved for him and Spears, \nand attempts to move closer to stick it on her and cloak them.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix adn Fliq were about to join the battle, but they thought they \nsaw something. Some movement, up on a cliff. They decided to check it \nout, and began scaling the cliff.\n\n\n"}}
