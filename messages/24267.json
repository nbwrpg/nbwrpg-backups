He flips out one of his swords, the energy hitting it and \nsplitting.\n\nPerndabot growls, feeling the energy burn into his sides. He calmly \nwatches Iron Raptor approaching, taking out another sword and standing \nready for battle. With a large sonic sword in each hand, Perndabot was \nready for battle.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor was glad to have a little fuzz ball safe and away in \nher back \n&gt; compartment, her helm over her head and her sword drawn.\n&gt; She had barely noticed Shadow Cat and Snow Tech dropping close to \nher, her \n&gt; scanners going over the battlefield.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were Maximals and Alliance bots all over the field, and to \nchose only \n&gt; one target was diffacult. Though, the gustalts could easily be seen, \nbut \n&gt; much to big a match for just her.\n&gt; But, just as her eyes went over the field again she finally spotted \na bot \n&gt; she could get.\n&gt; To test her power out on.\n&gt; With her cape flowing in the wind of war, Iron Raptor raised her \nsword \n&gt; towards the sky, feeling the blade glow for a second before bringing \nit \n&gt; down. An energy slash sent straight for Perndabot&#39;s side.\n&gt; But before the slash would hit, she  brought her sword by her side \nand ran \n&gt; towards him, wondering just how this body could handle close \ncombat.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp:/\n\n\n"}}
