His translucent body shimmers as he decides to speed\n&gt; &gt; up the process. He projects his thoughts to Pacifix, implanting a\n&gt; &gt; thought into his head. &lt;&lt; There is an enemy outside your ship, and\n&gt; &gt; he is threatening to kill Commander Ironhide! I should save the\n&gt; &gt; Commander. &gt;&gt; Azafroth shimmers even more brightly as he observes\n&gt; &gt; his work in progress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pacifix suddenly turns and spots a bot close to Ironhide. A though\n&gt; &gt; races through his head, &lt;&lt;There is an enemy outside your ship, and\n&gt; &gt; he is threatening to kill Commander Ironhide! I should save the\n&gt; &gt; Commander.&gt;&gt; He runs towards the bot, and to the side, making sure\n&gt; &gt; that there is nobody in his line of fire. His twin autocannons begin\n&gt; &gt; firing in bursts of eight, and his arm freeze cannons launch eight\n&gt; &gt; freeze blasts in total all directed at the bot near Ironhide, Arty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
