The craw \nslipped and \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t damaged his armor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Clinging to him now, as she returned the kiss with equal passion. \n&gt; \n&gt; How did it come to this? In a way she wanted to know, in another \nshe didn&#39;t \n&gt; care. Either way, she could feel the burning her in lasercore, her \nspark of a \n&gt; unity. Ever since she first laid her optics upon Megatron... it \nhad been such \n&gt; a desire in her. But... again, as a Decepticon, her sacrifice to \nbe the best \n&gt; warrior came first. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then.. all things disappeared from her mind, her meta processor. \nOnly to \n&gt; cling to him, hold him, barely feeling their exocovers against \neachother as a \n&gt; tingling sensation rushed through her. \n&gt; \n&gt; Purring into the deep, passionate kiss. Allowing for the first \ntime to let \n&gt; such things to take her away, to distract her.. to overwhelm her.\n\n\n"}}
