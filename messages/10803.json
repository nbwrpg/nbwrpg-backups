She runs over and grabs the blade out of Land Mine&#39;s hands.\n&gt; &quot;Are you crazy? Don&#39;t go cutting on yourself like that. Geeez. What\n&gt; is going through your mental circuits?&quot; She wiped the blade off held\n&gt; it out of Land Mine&#39;s reach.\n&gt; She looked at Land Mine. She sighed and spoke with a soft, concerned\n&gt; voice. &quot;Look, if you have someting you want to talk about, why don&#39;t\n&gt; we go for a walk and we can talk alone OK? I don&#39;t want a member of\n&gt; my team hurting themselves like this.  Fighting Maximals will get you\n&gt; hurt soon enough.&quot; She motioned for them to go outside. &quot;Please come\n&gt; with me and we can talk about it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Land Mine frowns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot; Land Mine says. Land Mine already sees herself as\n&gt; useless\n&gt; &gt; and ponders for ways of killing herself. Time Bomb is bored as Pit\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; ponders ways to kill himself. Deemos ponders ways to kill himself,\n&gt; and so\n&gt; &gt; does Inzola. Isn&#39;t this nice? Every one of my characters want to\n&gt; kill\n&gt; &gt; themselves. (Nothing personal everyone, it was a joke.) Now for the\n&gt; real\n&gt; &gt; post.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Land Mine frowns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you, KitKat.&quot; She whispers. She already feels not needed.\n&gt; She walks\n&gt; &gt; away slowly and sits in a corner. She pulls out a knife and starts\n&gt; to abuse\n&gt; &gt; herself with it, slowly cutting her wrists and letting the mech\n&gt; fluid flow\n&gt; &gt; freely. Hopefully, the mech fluid would run out quick, because she\n&gt; was in\n&gt; &gt; lots of pain. Time Bomb walks around to the bunch inside of the\n&gt; Predacon\n&gt; &gt; cave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, where&#39;s Land Mine?&quot; He asks...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
