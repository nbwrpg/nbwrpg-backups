The doors then open and with a whoosh of steam a Blue and \n&gt; white Robot \n&gt; &gt; steps from it. The figures wings curl around him as a white metal \n&gt; feather \n&gt; &gt; falls to the ground. He hears the sounds of battle coming from \n&gt; outside and \n&gt; &gt; his optics begin to glow a bright green. He quickly runs through \nthe \n&gt; halls of \n&gt; &gt; the base as he heads to the exit which he reaches in a few short \n&gt; minutes. he \n&gt; &gt; then presses a button causing the door open just enough for him to \n&gt; slide out \n&gt; &gt; through which he does before it closes again. Once out in the \n&gt; sunlight the \n&gt; &gt; bot is revealed to be... Zero, the Maximal who had helped the \n&gt; Chivtrons in \n&gt; &gt; the last battle they were in against the Decepticons only to be \n&gt; placed into \n&gt; &gt; Stasis lock by his brother. He looks around and catches a glipse \nof \n&gt; &gt; Shadowstar and Luzbel.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zero: &quot;I&#39;ve been in the CR chamber too long. This base is under \n&gt; attack \n&gt; &gt; again... now I must help.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zero quickly flys up to Prowl and Shadowstar and draws his beam \n&gt; sabre which \n&gt; &gt; he uses to slash at Shadowstar as he charges at prowl.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zero: &quot;Need some help?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
