What follows is\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the\n&gt; &gt; Congressional Record:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the\n&gt; &gt; Americans as the  most generous and possibly the least\n&gt; &gt; appreciated people on all the earth. Germany, Japan and, to\n&gt; &gt; a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the\n&gt; &gt; debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of\n&gt; &gt; dollars and forgave other billions in debts.  None of these\n&gt; &gt; countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; debts to the United States.  When France was in danger of\n&gt; &gt; collapsing in 1956,  it was the Americans who propped it up,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the\n&gt; &gt; streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When earthquakes\n&gt; &gt; hit distant cities, it  is the United States that hurries in\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; to help.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by\n&gt; &gt; tornadoes.  Nobody helped.  The Marshall Plan and theTruman\n&gt; &gt; Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged\n&gt; &gt; countries.  Now newspapers in those countries are writing\n&gt; &gt; about the decadent, warmongering Americans.  I&#39;d like to see\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; just one of those countries that is gloating over the\n&gt; &gt; erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal\n&gt; &gt; the Boeing Jumbo  Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; DC10?  If so, why don&#39;t they fly them? Why do all the\n&gt; &gt; International lines except Russia fly American Planes? Why\n&gt; &gt; does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or\n&gt; &gt; woman on themoon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and\n&gt; &gt; you get radios You talk about German technocracy, and you\n&gt; &gt; get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and\n&gt; &gt; you find men on the moon -not once, but several times - and\n&gt; &gt; safely home again.  You talk about scandals, and the\n&gt; &gt; Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; to look at. Even their  draft-dodgers are not pursued and\n&gt; &gt; hounded.  They are here on our streets, and most of them,\n&gt; &gt; unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.\n&gt; &gt; When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still\n&gt; &gt; broke.  I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced\n&gt; &gt; to the help of other people in trouble.  Can you name me\n&gt; &gt; even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in\n&gt; &gt; trouble?  I don&#39;t think there was outside help even during\n&gt; &gt; the San Francisco earthquake.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I&#39;m one Canadian who\n&gt; &gt; is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around.  They\n&gt; &gt; will come out of this thing with their flag high.  And when\n&gt; &gt; they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands\n&gt; &gt; that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is not one of those.&quot;  Stand proud, America!  Wear it\n&gt; &gt; proudly!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read\n&gt; &gt; regarding the United States. It is nice that one man\n&gt; &gt; realizes it.  I only wish that the rest of the world would\n&gt; &gt; realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never\n&gt; &gt; even get a thank you for the things we do.  I would hope\n&gt; &gt; that  each of you would send this to as many people as you\n&gt; &gt; can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of\n&gt; &gt; their friends until this letter is sent to every person on\n&gt; &gt; the web.  I am just a single American that has read this, I\n&gt; &gt; SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.\n&gt; &gt; God Bless\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suzanne Goad\n&gt; &gt; Capstone\n&gt; &gt; Academic Support Programs\n&gt; &gt; Admissions and Records\n&gt; &gt; Southern Illinois University\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; cybers will rule\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Terrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?\n&gt; Donate cash, emergency relief information\n&gt; http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/\n\n\n"}}
