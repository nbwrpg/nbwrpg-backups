They also extend underwater). So, there would be \nno cover for your troops to hide, save underwater, where the Iron \nFist also has defences.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Zardus had a lockdown on the area where \nGotron shot at Lady Hawk, so she wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of the \nIron Fist.\n\nAlso, the Iron Fist is a giant battle cruiser, it&#39;d take a while to \npenetrate deep enough to take out the power source, provided you can \nget through the shields.\n\n::Iron Fist/Zardus/DevilDuer/Havoc/Slayer/Lavacons::\n\nThe Iron Fist&#39;s shields flashed to life as gunfire was detected. \nLasers and missiles hit against the shields, doing next to nothing. \nThe defence systems respond, two signature-seeking missiles firing at \neach of the attackers, and three laser batteries opening fire as well.\n\nInside the Iron Fist, Zardus laughs as he sees the report of an \nattack. With nowhere to hide, these attackers wouldn&#39;t last long at \nall...\n\n&quot;Nemesis, the Iron Fist is under attack,&quot; he says into his \ncomm, &quot;Finish up at the Cybertronian Fire as soon as you can. These \nattackers arn&#39;t any trouble at all, but there arn&#39;t many bots here \nright now. Destroy the Maximals if you can, else get back here.&quot;\n\nWith that, he set off down the hallway, toward the exit of the Iron \nFist. While walking, he activated his comm, sending orders to the \nLavacons and DevilDuer.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer arrived at the new pod, activating his comm. If he didn&#39;t \nhave his suit on, the pressure of the water would have crushed him in \nseconds.\n\n&quot;This is DevilDuer, an alliance bot. Please identify yourself,&quot; he \nsays over the comm to the new bot, recieving the orders from Zardus \nand keeping them in mind.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAt the Cybertronian Fire, the Lavacons recieve Zardus&#39;s orders, \nsplitting up into seperate bots and boosting off toward the Iron Fist.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc sighs, hearing the sounds of battle outside.\n\n&quot;Guess we fight here instead of the CF,&quot; he says to Vlad, \ntransforming into robot mode and flying out of the Iron Fist. He \nfires two missiles at Slayer, who was just flying into sight.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer dives under two missiles, growling when several shots from the \nIron Fist hit him, leaving deep dents in his armor. This warship \nseemed to have more power than the average ones. Slayer had flown \nbehind Prebon&#39;s group and got here seconds after. He thought that \nattacking a full fledged battle cruiser rather than picking on a \ncrippled ship like they were going to was pretty stupid, but he kept \nhis oppinions to himself.\n\nSlayer fires several shots at Havoc, but they don&#39;t penetrate the \nshields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Prebon sees the first set of bots rush out of the Iron \nFist. &quot;ATTACK&quot; he yells pointing in the direction of the enemy. He \npicked up his constrictor rifle and fired five shots at Sharpedge.\n&gt; He pulled the pin on a flash grenade and tossed it in front of the \ncounterattackers. The flash was harmless it was designed to disrupt \nthier sight long enough to advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hammer Ducks behind cover as the missles hit. He pops his head up \njust on time to feel a series ofpistol shots hit him in the chest to \nstomach region. He fell back behind the cover that had saved him from \nthe missles. \n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze fired her disrupror again, this time at the area of the ship \nthat held the power unit. Without power the ship would be defenseless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullit fired two missles from his wrist, and five imploder blasts \nfrom his rifle at Godfather. The blasts would destroy a target from \nthe outside in.\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Alloran2@a... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@egroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, December 26, 2000 8:32 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Washington crosses the Delaware\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   :::Sharpedge/Godfather::: \n&gt; \n&gt;   ::they get out of the CR chambers:: \n&gt;   Sharpedge: Damn, we were in there WAAY to long!
