The occupant grabs the side of \nthe stasis pod=\r\n with his left hand and pulls himself up.  He quickly \njumps out of the pod=\r\n and looks around him.\n\n&quot;Blasted Sparks, where am I?&quot;\n\nHe quickly went back=\r\n to his ship and checked the scanners.  The long \nrange scanners were damag=\r\ned in the crash, but the short ranged still \nworked and they revealed nothi=\r\nng.  No intelligent life was within \nfifty miles which obviously meant one =\r\nthing to the occupant that no \nlonger occupied the ship.  He was all alone =\r\non this world!\n\nHe started to panic while he looked around.  What could he =\r\ndo?  Maybe \nhe could get back in the stasis pod and blast out of here and s=\r\nearch \nfor a new planet?  No that wouldn&#39;t work; the stasis pod didn&#39;t have=\r\n \nenough energy to get out of the atmosphere.  He quickly checked the \nonbo=\r\nard communication unit.  Broken!  Obviously he couldn&#39;t call far \nenough fo=\r\nr help.  He finally realized that his only hope was to \nsurvive.  The first=\r\n thing you need to survive is shelter.\n\nThe bot looked around and noticed s=\r\nome hills off in the distance.  If \nthere were some hills, maybe there woul=\r\nd be some caves or caverns or \nsomething that he could survive in.   So it =\r\nwas decided he thought.  \nHe would walk to the hills and hope to find shelt=\r\ner.  \n\nHe grabbed the side of his stasis pod and started to drag it along \n=\r\nwith him.  It was heavy, but inside there was short range scanners \nand eve=\r\nn a few weeks worth of food.  The journey to the hills would \nbe long, but =\r\nat least it was a way for him to survive.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In space, sound can not b=\r\ne heard, but if it could a bystander would \n&gt; hear the loud crack hiss of a=\r\nn asteroid slamming into the cold and \n&gt; white metallic shell of a nearby s=\r\ntasis pod.  This rough nudge was \n&gt; all that was needed to change the stasi=\r\ns pod&#39;s planned orbit and \n&gt; thrust it towards the inners of the solar syst=\r\nem.  \n&gt; \n&gt; An object in motion stays in motion unless acted on and this was=\r\n \nthe \n&gt; case for the stasis pod as it drifted towards the inners of the \nS=\r\nolar \n&gt; System on a constant course until its path was caught by the \nthird=\r\n&#39;s \n&gt; planet&#39;s gravitational pull.  The pull was enough to cause the \nstasi=\r\ns \n&gt; pod to forgo its journey to the sun and instead to enter the \nprecious=\r\n \n&gt; atmosphere of the third planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the pod came screaming down thr=\r\nough the atmosphere the metal \n&gt; started to heat up.  The once white metal =\r\nstarted to burn red as \nthe \n&gt; stasis pod was quickly coming to the climax =\r\nof its journey.  A \ntrail \n&gt; of smoke could be seen by anyone that bothered=\r\n to look up into the \n&gt; day sky.  The stasis pod finally came to rest in wh=\r\nat was known as \n&gt; Maine.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The occupant of the stasis pod, who was in=\r\n a stasis, woke with the \n&gt; landing of the pod.  The occupant took a quick =\r\nbreath as the \ninternal \n&gt; speakers of the stasis pod declared,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Acqui=\r\nring Beast Mode.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The occupant let out a blood curling scream as its b=\r\nody started to \n&gt; change as it download the new mode.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
