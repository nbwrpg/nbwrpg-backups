I fear he is dead.  We \nall saw him fighting KitKat, correct?&quot;\n\nDouble Punch nodded as three acknowledgements were received in his audio \nreceptors.  &quot;Good.  Then, we must take up our arms, and join a faction that \nis against KitKat.  I suggest the Alliance.  They are by far the strongest \nand more superior.  They are not invincible, but without Hell Beast&#39;s \nleadership, we can&#39;t defeat them.  And because they ARE against KitKat, we \nwill fufill part of Hell Beast&#39;s plans, one way or another.\n\nThe other Predacons agreed with some clapping and &#39;whooping&#39;.  \n\n&quot;Let&#39;s kick tailgate!&quot; Manterror yelled.  \n\nThe four robots began marching at a quick pace for the Middle East.\n\n"}}
