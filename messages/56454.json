I&#39;m coming back soon, and I have some questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  Would Winged Warrior, and whoever I gave Flicker\n&gt; to (can&#39;t remember who) like to keep them?  I don&#39;t\n&gt; know about Owlhawk, but based on the number of posts\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen baring Flickers name he&#39;s been developed\n&gt; alot.  I&#39;d be perfectly happy giving them up, in fact\n&gt; I have another idea for a char that will either be the\n&gt; undisputed coolest char I have ever made, or be\n&gt; instantly banned in a unamimous vote by the council. \n&gt; Which brings me to question two.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.
