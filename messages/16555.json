It looked like a pistol (the weapon, not the replicator machine), \nwith a small atatchment on top. The main area fired a beam, containing a \nmodified cyber-virus to destroy the mind-controlling chip. The atatchment, \nwhich could be mistaken for a scope, held five chips, each identical to the \none that Ramulus now had in his head, designed to prevent the mind-control.\n\nSnatching about a dozen guns, Ramulus puts them in various compartments in \nhis body, and, holding two of them, runs out of the lab, speeding toward the \nexit of the CF.\n\n"}}
