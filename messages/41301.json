So I shall be using them)\n\nOblitercons/Wolfgang/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodstryke/Hugar/Thug-Bot/\nPunch/Scatterblaster/Nemesis Enforcer/Vehement/Teufel/Otyebis Staff/Ares/\nReflector/Unitron/Firestarter/Shockwave:\n\n\n\nThe Oblitercons arrived at the Otyebis, several guards escorting them to a \ndifferent corner form all the other combatants where the Gestalt Division \nmatches would take place.  They each entered a single hatch.\n\n---\n\nWolfgang, Perndabot, Bloodstryke, and Reptilica stopped, hatches with each of \ntheir names above them in view.\n\n&quot;Come on, it&#39;s time to win.&quot; Wolfgang ordered, each of them entering their \nhatch.\n\n---\n\nHugar and Thug-Bot entered their hatches, staring inside the metal arenas and \nwondering when their opponents would arrive.\n\n---\n\nPunch arrived outside of the Otyebis, but before he entered he checked his \nplasma cannon and changed to his Counter Punch mode, checking his photon \nrifle, and then reverted to his Punch mode.  He entered the Otyebis with \nescorts of course, going to his hatch and preparing for the fight.\n\n---\n\nOne of the soldiers turned to Dameos and took out his datapad.  &quot;Your \nopponent...Noble, is here and on the way here.&quot; the soldier replied, \nfollowing his group.\n\n---\n\nThe team of soldiers stopped, a hatch for each Cyber with his/her name above \nit.  &quot;Please enter those and await for your match to begin if you would.&quot;\n\n=====\n\n&quot;Full retreat!&quot; Nemesis Enforcer yelled, a punch from Vehement nearly \nshattering his entire head.  He fired off ten rapid laser bolts into the \nchest of the Archbishop without much of an effect, another punch smashing in \nhis chest.\n\nTransforming to his bat mode he sent a wing slapping forward, knocking \nVehement off balance.  With that distraction Nemesis Enforcer&#39;s boosters \nlaunched to full power, rocketing him into the sky, Teufel/Zardus&#39; missiles \nmissing him by feet, instead the shrapnel striking Vehement.\n\n&quot;No complaints from me, goomba.&quot; Scatterblaster replied to Nemesis Enforcer, \nalready in the air and undamaged.  He fired down twenty armor-piercing rounds \ndown at &quot;Zardus&quot; which struck with mild success.  Rising through the air \nfaster he and Nemesis Enforcer blasted off towards Spain.\n\n&quot;I have a match at the IGL thing...why didn&#39;t you sign up?&quot;\n\n&quot;What...?&quot; Nemesis Enforcer asked, obviously confused.\n\n&quot;The big ship that landed...&quot;\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;That broadcasted the message for ten hours on all known frequencies...?&quot;\n\n&quot;I must&#39;ve been asleep.  We can&#39;t split up.&quot;\n\n&quot;The winner gets a gestalt team but I---&quot;\n\nAt the mention of more warriors, Nemesis kicked Scatterblaster hard, \ncoincidentally sending him off in the direction of the Otyebis, the psychotic \nrobot only hearing Nemesis yells for him to win.\n\n---\n\nBack on the ground an angry Vehement looked to Teufel.  &quot;I must take part in \na competition, but I will have a replacement come.&quot; Vehement said, Teufel \nonly nodding and resuming his search for whatever Unicron wanted.\n\nActivating his inner monologue comm. he contacted Reflector.  &quot;Reflector, I \nhave a mission from the Chaos-Bringer himself.&quot;\n\n~I am ready to serve the Chaos-Bringer~\n\n&quot;Good.  Come to Teufel&#39;s coordinates, bring Sun Crusher along with you.  \nTeufel will fill you in.  He will charading as Zardus in case of trouble, so \ndo not fire on him when you arrive here.&quot;\n\n~Understood, Archbishop~\n\n&quot;I&#39;m on my way,&quot; Vehement told Teufel as he flew through the air at his top \nspeed towards the Otyebis, Teufel merely nodding as he continued his search.\n\n=======\n\nMore than two-thirds of the way towards the Ramora, Unitron continued his \nconversation with Vampriza.\n\n&quot;Your offer is to vague and we know not who you are,&quot; he replied over the \ncomm, &quot;we will need to hear more.&quot;\n\nAres pulled up next to Shockwave and his disembodied voice spoke.\n\n&quot;Emperor Shockwave, I request permission to go to the Otyebis and participate \nin the IGL.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very well, waste no energy in attempting to win,&quot; he intoned in reply, &quot;but \nbe quick.  It would be illogical to waste needed time at the alien craft if \nyou lose.&quot;\n\n&quot;Understood.&quot; Ares said, changing his course towards the Otyebis at full \nspeed.\n\n===\n\nA skimmer docked with the Otyebis, Menasor being carried to a secure gestalt \narena.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Yes, four maximals is fine.&quot; one of the Otyebis staff replied to Cledar.  \n&quot;Be fast though, we will be beginning soon.&quot;\n\n---\n\nOne IGL skimmer, carrying Sinew, got a target lock and fired off two \nrestraining bolts, one at Strafe and the other at Cliffjumper.  If they \nstruck they would fill Cliffjumper and Strafe so full of electricity it would \ntemporarily incapacitate them.\n\n"}}
