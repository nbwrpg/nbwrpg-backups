They will be qui=\r\nte a handful.  \nWorthy quarry I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; dewboy30816 &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; =\r\nwrote:Seer stared around his \ncircle.  Each wore a hood making them \n&gt; indi=\r\nstinguishable.  On his left sat Deus, a heartless opportunist; \n&gt; in front =\r\nof him sat Ex, a female bot who wished more than anything \n&gt; to know what t=\r\nhe future held; and to his right was his most \nfearsome \n&gt; ally Machina, a =\r\nwarrior who wanted merely to live forever, and was \n&gt; willing to do whateve=\r\nr it took to break the prophesy that doomed \nthe \n&gt; three of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; See=\r\nr, however, was under no such restraint.  He could not die, but \n&gt; nor coul=\r\nd he leave his palace.  In it destiny energy flowed \nthrough \n&gt; him, he kne=\r\nw all possible pasts and presents, and most futures, \nand \n&gt; existed in all=\r\n he could see.  Deus shuffled nervously, he was \n&gt; planning a betrayal, and=\r\n he knew Seer knew it, but he also knew \nthat \n&gt; his betrayal was too small=\r\n to bother with in retrospect of what \nSeer \n&gt; was trying to accomplish.  D=\r\neus&#39; companion would die, but he would \n&gt; live=85for now.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;The t=\r\nimelines are shifting wildly out of control,&quot; Seer \n&gt; said, opening the mee=\r\nting.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Yes, but is it worth the risk to intervene and try and st=\r\nop \n&gt; it,&quot; said Machina.  He had never been able to see beyond risks, \nthat=\r\n \n&gt; was why he was destined to fail at his overall purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;We =\r\n  will not stop it.  Because of this=85Neo Beast War the \n&gt; potential pasts=\r\n and presents are multiplying along with the \nfuture, \n&gt; but we must gain m=\r\nore destiny potential in order to control it.  \n&gt; Some presents are shiftin=\r\ng away, becoming obscure.  Thankfully \nthis \n&gt; course of events has provide=\r\nd us with an ample source of \npotential.  \n&gt; All actions in a past so dista=\r\nnt are magnified in the present.  By \n&gt; stealing the potential of even one =\r\nbot who vaguely resembles a \nhero \n&gt; or villain we could very well achieve =\r\nthe equivalent of destroying \n&gt; Optimus Prime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Master, I volun=\r\nteer for this service,&quot; said Ex.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;No!&quot; cut in Deus, &quot;I-I mean in=\r\n such a time period the \n&gt; destiny energy could magnify the potential for t=\r\nhe prophesy of our \n&gt; demise being fulfilled.  We must send someone else.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Who else could be entrusted with such a task?&quot; asked \n&gt; Machina=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;I will personally vouch for Fortuneteller,&quot; said Deus with \n&gt;=\r\n confidence.  All three of the other bots at the meeting burst into \n&gt; laug=\r\nhter.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;You would send one of our lowest level deviners?&quot; asked E=\r\nx.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;And your lover at that,&quot; said Machina.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Seer laugh=\r\ned for a moment with them, but then considered the \n&gt; idea.  He called on h=\r\nis prescience, and saw the potential for his \n&gt; own ends.  Fortuneteller mi=\r\nght think she was working for Deus, but \n&gt; he knew he could make her do wha=\r\ntever he wanted in the end with a \n&gt; few of Deus&#39; screams if she refused to=\r\n comply with his \nwill.  &quot;Very \n&gt; well!  She will go, and she will remember=\r\n her prophesy `So long as \n&gt; you pay the Seer&#39;s price, no Transmetal will t=\r\nake your life.&#39;  Now \n&gt; let us select the target we can gain the most by de=\r\nstroying.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Deus kissed her, and ran his fingers through her h=\r\nair.  &quot;I \n&gt; am yours,&quot; she said, &quot;what do you wish me to do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;G=\r\no to Earth.  Bring me the destiny potential of the bot you \n&gt; have been ord=\r\nered to kill.  Say he died before you got to him.  \nOnly \n&gt; you, I, and See=\r\nr will know.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;But Seer is the one who wants the destiny potenti=\r\nal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Yes, but he knows everything we&#39;ve done against him, and \n=\r\n&gt; hasn&#39;t acted.  Obviously we&#39;re necessary to avoid some future he \n&gt; would=\r\n prefer not to face.  We just need to keep working.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;But I woul=\r\nd break my prophesy, and lose my inability to be \n&gt; killed by transmetals.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Isn&#39;t it worth it?  Isn&#39;t it worth it for me?&quot;  He kissed \n&gt; h=\r\ner again.\n&gt; \n&gt;       &quot;Yes, my love.  Yes is it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: O.k., I need a v=\r\nolunteer for Fortuneteller&#39;s quarry.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
