The shot misses, sailing past Dogged and smashing \n&gt; into the roof of the tunnel. A large explosion caves that section in, \n&gt; and the bot fires again, this time right on target, the explosive round \n&gt; heading for Dogged very quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Dogged  . transforms to four treaded\n&gt;  &gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt;  &gt; Speeding through the flames, the heat warping the paint and singing the\n&gt;  &gt; metal beneath. he remained focused on the bum. The two weakest bots \n&gt; were the\n&gt;  &gt; origional targets so he remained fixxed on scrapping them first.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Arty noticed that Slags attention was turned away from him. he raised his\n&gt;  &gt; right arm and fired a sidewinder from the winglike attachment mounted at\n&gt;  &gt; it&#39;s side. his left hand found his mini launcher. he drew it from his\n&gt;  &gt; holster and fired an impact grenade toward Crossroads.
