She felt helpless and un \nable to do anything about her situation.  Then she felt a twinge of \ncourage go through her.  She tried to reopen the connection through \nthe link that Veratis had used.  She used a lot of her own energy, \nbut managed to open up a small link.  She tried to speak, but it \ndidn&#39;t work.  She found that through the computer, she could make her \nwords appear on the console. It wasn&#39;t much, but it was something.  \nShe tried to tap into other systems and possable find out more about \nher surroundings. But the computer was encoded and she couldn&#39;t get \nvery far.  She let her words form on the console screen.\n&quot;Hello? Anyone there? I need to know about my form. Can my form \nfuntion without the DNA inprinting for a short time?&quot; was what she \nhad left on the screen for Veratis to find.  She then tried to reach \na connection to her form. She tried and struggled, but couldn&#39;t make \nit work.  The mainframe blocked out most of her efforts.  She tried \nagain, but could&#39;t find the connection to the &#39;brain&#39; of the \npotoform. She got one last idea to try before giving up totally.  She \ntried to establish a connection to the body of the protoform.  She \nwas able to get a partial link to the arm of the form.  She felt it \nthe connection and she could almost feel the arm itself.  She tried \nto raise the arm up slightly.  The arm of the protoform moved up \nabout two inches off the table, then back down.  Shadow Wing felt so \nexcited that she would have jumped around if she could have.  She \ncouldn&#39;t help but feel overjoyed at her accomplishment.  never before \nwould she take moving and being able to control her own body for \ngranted again.  She was extatic.  She printed up on the console,&quot;I \ndid it, I made it move, I did it!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
