Finally, after three hundred\nyears, he has come back to a planet with such organic beauty. He makes\nsure to record a birds chirping as he passes by a tree, quite pleased in\nits pleasant sound, and resolved to study it later. He heads to the top\nof a hill, and stops, transforming. He points downward. &quot;There, there&#39;s\nCliffjumper.&quot; he says extatically, pointing at a convoy of four robots\nat the bottom.\n__________________________\n\nCliffjumper keeps on driving, leading the rest of the newly joined\nAutobots. His sensors catch a motion to his left. He transforms and\ndraws his gun, trying to make it out. &quot;okay guys, there something over\nthere, but I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s threatening or not.&quot; he says pointing up\nthe hill.\n\n"}}
