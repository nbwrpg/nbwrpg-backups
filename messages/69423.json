It had taken three weeks to clear the\n&gt; rubble and begin rebuilding; the Maximal base however, was a total\n&gt; loss: only the lower level remained, which merely contained a\n&gt; destroyed ractor system and the prison cells, which concievably be\n&gt; modified to be used by the loca police.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So you&#39;ll be leaving us?&quot; asked the mayor, already knowing the answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes.  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that our presence in the city\n&gt; merely aggrivates conditions.  Without us, this island would become a\n&gt; much lower priority for our enemies.  Though I hope we can continue\n&gt; our research together; and I promise we will do anything we can to\n&gt; help the city.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So where will you be going?&quot; the mayor asked after a moment of silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perseus walked to the windows and sighed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We Maximals have been divided for too long.  With this Unicronian\n&gt; threat, and our recent truce with Megatron. it would be apropriate for\n&gt; us to put our diferences aside and work together.  So we&#39;ll first be\n&gt; going to meet with Lord Elder.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well my friend, I wish you the best of success.  You are always welcome\n&gt; here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
