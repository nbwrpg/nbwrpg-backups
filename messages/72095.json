He&#39;s knocked off his feet which quickly triggers a fli=\r\nght response as he stumbles, crashes to the ground, and in a clumsy manner =\r\ntransforms back into his beast mode with a sizable gash on his back.  Batte=\r\nry fluid leaks steadily down his back but he was still lucky enough he had =\r\nhis legs and his wings.  So even though he hated to do it, he bounds off ho=\r\nping to get them off his back.\n\n&quot; There has to be a way to get them off my =\r\nback.  And who the pit made them that way?&quot;\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nSuper Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cornered, yet=\r\n still as calm as ever.

Not one word is uttered from him, an eerie =\r\npeace\n&gt; &gt; with explosive properties, comes in and around the Dinobots.
