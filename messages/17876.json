She noticed how \nthe area looked familiar.  She then realized where she was \ngoing. &quot;Hey, we&#39;re heading for Arachnia&#39;s lair. I may not be welcome \nthere. And what do you mean by Megatron&#39;s forces? If Megatron is \ndead, then his forces will disperse.  They won&#39;t stay together.  And \nwhy are you in such a hurry?&quot;  She ran and scurried along, gaining on \nhim and then running side by side. &quot;Hang on. If Black Aracnia doesn&#39;t \nwant me back, i&#39;m as good as scrap, would you radio ahead and find \nout what she would IF you say you found me?
