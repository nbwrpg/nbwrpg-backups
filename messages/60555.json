Then, there was the void inside, in his spark. At the \nfocus of both voids, there was the flaming wreck of the ship, \nbringing flashes in space and twinges in Templar&#39;s mind.\n\nTemplar: Why am I still living, while you, dear friend, are dead? \nTheir is no more purpose left to me now, no reasons...\n\nThe escape pod drifted aimlessly until a small piece of debris \nviolently hit it. The propulsors let go of a silvery-white steam and \nstarted spinning very fast. Templar tried to force the controls to \nobey him, but he started welcoming this instant as the one \npreceeding his death.\n\nTemplar: There it is, dear friend... I will join you nonetheless...\n\nHe tried to stay conscious long enough to greet Death with arms wide \nopen, but passed away before. However, the pod managed to place \nitself in Earth&#39;s orbit and to send out a wide range SOS signal. The \nmaximal origin of the message did betray its user, though.\n\n\n"}}
