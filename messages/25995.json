He wasn&#39;t sure if he could be\ncareful, but he was ever confident in his ability to survive. Deemos came up\nbeside Tarantopulous after he had gotten a good distance away.\n\nTarantopulous: I will not join the Alliance.\n\nDeemos: Taran, I do not expect you to join the winning faction, but please\ndo not be too upset when we crush your Maximals.\n\nTarantopulous: I&#39;m glad you understand. Why did you turn on me like that?\nWhat about the Maximals? You swore your allegiance to them.\n\nDeemos: They never accepted me.\n\nTarantopulous: How can you say that? You probably never gave them a chance!\n\nThe 2 walked together, Clash coming up closer to them in the distance.\n\nDeemos: Well, my destiny lies in a different path than your&#39;s.\n\nTarantopulous: I won&#39;t do anything to hamr you, but after we destroy the\nAlliance, I fear for your safety, I will try to get them to be merciful on\nyou.\n\nDeemos: After what I did to the Predacons, I doubt that the Maximals will\nbeat me.\n\nTarantopulous: Even if I back them up?\n\nDeemos: Against me, Taran?\n\nTarantopulous: I see what you mean, but I am a Maximal, and I must help my\ncomrades.\n\nDeemos: I will not put you down, your beliefs matter to me, but I will not\nshare them.\n\nTarantopulous: What?\n\nDeemos: What? What do you mean by what?\n\nTarantopulous: That.\n\nDeemos looks in the direction Tarantopulous was, and Clash was flying up.\nClash stops in front of them and lands.\n\nClash: Oh, ho! You want to die, too, huh?\n\nClash&#39;s arm was grown back by now.\n\nDeemos: Apparently you wish to die.\n\nTarantopulous: Mr, if you try to take me on you will not leave here alive.\n\nClash: You underestimate me.\n\nTarantopulous: No, you underestimate me, I am overestimating you.\n\nDeemos: Okay, Taran, this if your fight, not the Alliance&#39;s fight, you can\nhave it.\n\nDeemos steps backwards. Tarantopulous steps forward. Perplex comes walking\nup in the distance. Clash looks back and forth between the 2.\n\nClash: An ambush, eh? Pathetic.\n\nTarantopulous: I have nothing to do with him, he&#39;s probably on your side.\n\nClash: Enough talking, enguarde!...\n\n\n"}}
