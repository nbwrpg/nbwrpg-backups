If an RPG died because of it would be \nbecause no one wanted to go Cybertron (obvious there) or because it wasn&#39;t \ndone right.  Cybertron isn&#39;t really explored that much in the American \nTransformers cartoon, which is the only one I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d agree with LN, \ndon&#39;t base it on Beast Machines.  Yuk.  \n\nAlso, on Cybertron, we could do more stuff.  In example, the first two \nseasons of TFs, undoubtedly the best but I guess you could say &#39;restricted&#39; \nto Earth and occassional visits to Earth.  Season three, undoubtedly not the \nbest, did have many episodes OFF of Cybertron and Earth.  Going to different \nplanets, etc.  A good concept there, even if most art and writing was...shall \nwe say lacking?  Again, season three wasn&#39;t the best but it had a LOT of \nopportunities that this RPG would have as well.  Not to mention we&#39;d get to \nmake our own Cybertron and, well, yeah, I went over that.\n\nThe biggest problem is we&#39;d have to make our own Cybertron.  I mean, we know \nwhat Earth looks like, all the places, the geography.  Buuuut, we don&#39;t know \nthat for Cybertron and we&#39;d need to create it.\n\nAs for the protohumans, early in the RPG people were equipping huge gumby \nsquads of protohumans with weapons and using them as massively destructive \narmies so they were banned, as they should be.  The RPG&#39;s got along fine with \ngumbies that can&#39;t fight.\n\n\n-L. Unitron   \n\n"}}
