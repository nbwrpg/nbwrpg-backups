Don&#39;t worry about the small stuff.\n&gt; For things can always be worse. Look at me, I lost an arm. But I&#39;m\n&gt; still here and I got my arm back.  So don&#39;t worry about the small\n&gt; stuff.&quot; She looked at the blade that she had given back to Land Mine\n&gt; and thought about cutting her own arm. She shook her head.\n&gt; &quot;look, I&#39;m going to go hunting here in a little while. Your welcome\n&gt; to join me if you want.&quot; She got up and walked to  the door of the\n&gt; lab.\n&gt; &quot;Smile, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
