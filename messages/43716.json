The story\n&gt; so far has been \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal\n&gt; University is 30 for \n&gt; 34 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a\n&gt; total of 50 \n&gt; points.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But can the last rank Gorrilaz with the help of\n&gt; Gorzo beat the \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rank Ballers?  Lets go down to the court to see\n&gt; what happens.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello, we have 20\n&gt; secounds left in the \n&gt; game. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the ball as we\n&gt; speak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot;\n&gt; passes the ball in to \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo\n&gt; Dribbles the ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bot with a\n&gt; jersey that \n&gt; says &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Bentals passes\n&gt; it a bot with \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball\n&gt; to Bentals and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to\n&gt; the 3-point line \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jumps up making it look like a jump shot.  At\n&gt; the last second he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the\n&gt; goal, whose jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an\n&gt; Alley-op(SP?).  \n&gt; Bots \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  The bots\n&gt; jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a\n&gt; bot with a jersey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look\n&gt; Stupid.)  Rauq starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when he trips\n&gt; over his own feet.  \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ball leaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo\n&gt; hands.  Gorzo, who is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; standing behind the 3-point line and takes a\n&gt; jump shot.  The ball \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sails into the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST POCKET, THE\n&gt; GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n&gt; 106.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Gorzo jersey 5\n&gt; years earlier was in \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle.  He is Flying around\n&gt; Earth.  All of a \n&gt; sudden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right wing catches on fire and falls down\n&gt; towards Earth as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle falls down with the wing.  The shuttle\n&gt; lands near Mid-\n&gt; Africa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys Characters\n&gt; are.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
