He saw that now, he fealt for her but knew that a wolf and \nan owl weren&#39;t meant to work together, were they? He turned back to \nthe crow and gobbled it up. In his world scavenging food was just as \nimportant as hunting it. Shadow Wing was a good hunter as an owl but \nshe didn&#39;t seam to realize that she was more. she has the ability to \nchange into something that gives her an edge yo the hunt. If she \ncould learn that, she might survive. In the cold he&#39;d want her at his \nside, but he still wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d fight in this climate. Her \nemotions were her weakness. One moment she wanted the hunt, the kill, \nthe next moment she wanted to run away and hide. \n&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; he said more to himself than to her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to \ndo that to help you survive.&quot;\nLunarpine wiped his mouth and headed back to base, alone again.\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She froze for a second when he yelled BANG.  She fell to the ground \nas he \n&gt; let her go.  She couldn&#39;t say anything.  She looked at him for a \nmoment.  \n&gt; She she flew off.  She didn&#39;t say a word.  She just flew off into \nthe sky.  \n&gt; She was hurt inside.  The game went to far.  She flew even higher \ninto the \n&gt; sky.  She knew that he would never want her for a partner now.  She \nstarted \n&gt; to sob as she flew into the clouds.  It hurt her down to her \nspark.  She \n&gt; didn&#39;t want to back to the base.  She didn&#39;t even want to look at \nhim.  He \n&gt; scared her.  She also let herself fall for him.  She let her spark \nfall for \n&gt; him.  But that was one mistake that she would not go and do again. \nNever \n&gt; again, she thought. She flew through the cloud bank, hoping to lose \nherself \n&gt; in the cool air of the upper sky.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----original message-----\n&gt; &gt;From: cyberwolf4@p...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The wolfbot knew not to push his &quot;Wild&quot; side to far. Owls and \nwolves\n&gt; &gt;competed in the frozen wilderness he came from, but not here. Pain\n&gt; &gt;scorched through his right arm (The one holding her). He knew not \nto\n&gt; &gt;release her or she&#39;d claw hhis eyes out. In beast mode her talons\n&gt; &gt;were her most powerful weapon. Lunarpine lowered his claw anr \npulled\n&gt; &gt;his rifle. holding it up he pointed to the owls chest. Her head\n&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t as big a part of her robot mode, destroy it and she&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt;repairable. he was aiming for the one part that held her spark in\n&gt; &gt;both modes. &quot;BANG&quot; Lunarpine shouted, &quot;Game over&quot; He dropped her to\n&gt; &gt;the ground and jumped back ready to react if necessary. &quot;When I \nplay\n&gt; &gt;Wing it&#39;s for keeps. So will the Predicons.
