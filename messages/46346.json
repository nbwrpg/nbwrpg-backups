Maybe you should rename your character, unless he truly \nis a\n&gt; &gt; member of the Tripreds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually the Tripredacus he might be refering to is the trio of \npredacon\n&gt; leaders on cybertron who hold the title: Tripredacus Council. Ravage \nwould\n&gt; count as a Tripredacus Agent. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Can easily see where the confusion mounts... :o)\n\n\n"}}
