It wouldn&#39;t be easy \n&gt; &gt; attempt=\r\ning to turn Rodimus around.  He simply sighs, and does not give \n&gt; &gt; anyone=\r\n the satisfaction of losing his temper.  The less he expressed his \n&gt; &gt; dis=\r\ndain, the more he hoped to cause a bit of frustration among his \n&gt; &gt; captiv=\r\nes.  He had an old saying.  &quot;Don&#39;t get mad, use your strongest of \n&gt; &gt; attr=\r\nibutes and talents to passively retaliate against your enemies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh=\r\nh well, I may be in trouble for a while, and it wouldn&#39;t be the first \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntime.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He shrugs Rodimus off casually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the fortress=\r\n, Rat Trap gets Lord Elder&#39;s message, and replies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Lord Elder, so=\r\nrry for not gettn&#39; back ta ya so soon.  We had a little \n&gt; &gt; glitch in our =\r\nbattle plans...  Tucson Prime told us ta stay outside the \n&gt; &gt; fortress, an=\r\nd we did, and when he went inside with Kup ta try&#39;n get \n&gt; &gt; Nightshift out=\r\n, he got captured, again.  But this time I think he wanted \n&gt; &gt; ta get capt=\r\nured..  Some sorta new strategy he&#39;s tryn&#39; out.  As for us... \n&gt; &gt; I - dunn=\r\no but Quickstride&#39;s got that look in his eyes.. He&#39;s itchn&#39; for a \n&gt; &gt; figh=\r\nt. Normally I would just stay out of it, but, ya know somethn&#39;, I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; it=\r\nchn&#39; for some payback too.  Wheels is in there and he&#39;s givn&#39; it his \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nll!  The least we can do is return the favor and do our part out here. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n We&#39;ll keep the com link open sir, so that way ya know we&#39;re still with \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ya.... Nowwwww, let&#39;s see, I&#39;m on your back Quickstride and when you get =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; your hooves movn&#39; you get &#39;em movn&#39;...  All we need is a long piece of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; metal and we got ourselves a lance...  Get my drift?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickst=\r\nride nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; My charge, your lance....  Ohhh yeahh I do.  The old =\r\nJousting game. But \n&gt; &gt; remember, as Maximals, we don&#39;t make any moves unle=\r\nss we&#39;re attacked \n&gt; &gt; first.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.  He spots something.=\r\n  A long pipe like object that appears \n&gt; &gt; to be a broken off piece of pip=\r\ne from some form of fallen aircraft.  It \n&gt; &gt; proves to not have rusted and=\r\n in good condition.  He scans the ground and \n&gt; &gt; finds what looks like a p=\r\nointed missile head, perhaps from a missile that \n&gt; &gt; had not fired.  He pu=\r\nts the two of them together and with a small welding \n&gt; &gt; tool, he fashions=\r\n a make shift lance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What&#39;dya think?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride grins.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That&#39;ll do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap grins also.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Rat Trap Maxim=\r\nize.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gets into his robot mode, and gets up onto Quickstride&#39;s b=\r\nack, holding \n&gt; &gt; the lance in his left hand while holding onto Quickstride=\r\n&#39;s mane with the \n&gt; &gt; other.  He then realizes that one more thing is missi=\r\nng.  A shield.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Forgot the shield.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride sniffs at a=\r\n broken off door of a vehicle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Found one.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap is giv=\r\nen the car door.  He now tries to hold on with his legs, \n&gt; &gt; rather than h=\r\nands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, I dunno how this is gonna work big guy..  Guess we&#39;ll=\r\n find out \n&gt; &gt; eventually.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quickstride faces the fortress, and sta=\r\nnds his ground.  The wind blows \n&gt; &gt; breezes through his mane as he looks o=\r\nnward, ears forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Remember Rat Trap, we don&#39;t make any moves un=\r\nless they come after us \n&gt; &gt; first.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Back in the fortress in a diff=\r\nerent cell, Night Shift keeps an ear out on \n&gt; &gt; what goes on behind the do=\r\nor.  He calmly remembers all of his ninjabot \n&gt; &gt; training, and a few hand =\r\nexcercises he had been taught to make his wrists \n&gt; &gt; more limber and fluid=\r\n.  He had hoped that these would accidentally, on \n&gt; &gt; purpose slip one of =\r\nhis hands if not both out of his restraints and be \n&gt; &gt; able to slip them b=\r\nack in at a moment&#39;s notice, then back out without \n&gt; &gt; anyone ever catchin=\r\ng onto him.  Without a word, he keeps his eyes open, \n&gt; &gt; not one ounce of =\r\nbody language, and attempts his excercises he had learned \n&gt; &gt; from his men=\r\ntor, Prowl.  He thinks to himself while attempting it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay Prowl=\r\n, I ain&#39;t done this one in a while, let&#39;s see if I remember \n&gt; &gt; that littl=\r\ne excercise ya taught me...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hydras/Perceptor:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hdyras sent a pr=\r\nivate message to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I want to speak with you when your shif=\r\nt ends.
