Someone adapted to this world.&quot; It was \nthe same answer Lunarpine had gotten since the first time he&#39;d asked \nthe question. \n\n&quot;That&#39;s not good enough anymore, Why did you change me?&quot; Lunarpine \nwas beginning to become furious with the scientist.\n\nThere was a pause in the room, the tension could&#39;ve been cut with a \nknife. &quot;Because you could be more. I saw you as the perfect \nbeneficiary of my treatment. You&#39;re a better Translife form now. The \nscience bot seemed out of his mind but that didn&#39;t stop Lunarpine \nfrom asking the next question\n\n&quot;How am I better? I&#39;m still a wolfbot.&quot; He&#39;d thought about it for a \nwhile, he did feal different somehow. (In case you&#39;re wondering yes \nhis eyes are healed in his new body.)\n\n&quot;Step outside and I&#39;ll demonstrate.&quot; Veratis had Lunarpines full \nattention now so he followed him out. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She felt cold.  She tried as hard as she cold to try to connect to \n&gt; Lunarpine, but couldn&#39;t find a connection.  She felt alone and \n&gt; helpless.  She couldn&#39;t defend herself without a body, but she \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; want to give up.  She tried again to connect with Lunarpine, but \n&gt; still couldn&#39;t find a connection.  She felt her spark fall and she \n&gt; had no choice but to give up and wait.\n\n\n"}}
