Basically the world went from G1/G2 to Animated\nto Beast Wars back on old Earth - Beast Machines never happened.\n\nSo for Yokatron: (Yes I am stealing the name Prowl-Z from Adam for the\nname of the animated version of Prowl, I hope he doesn&#39;t mind)\n\n***************\nYoketron is a wise old Autobot responsible for training the Autobot\nCyber-Ninja Corps at the Cyber-Ninja Dojo, but more importantly, he\nprotects the Autobots&#39; cache of protoforms, which will have to be\nactivated if Project Omega fails. He is a master of many martial arts,\nincluding Circuit-Su, Metallikato, Crystalocution, diffusion,\nTekkaido, Tahtib-tron and Laser Lathi.\n\nOne of Yoketron&#39;s former students, Lockdown, betrayed him, stealing\nmost of the protoforms for the Decepticons, and leaving Yoketron to\ndie. Prowl-Z returned during the aftermath, and he attempted to revive\nYoketron by transferring his spark to a protoform that had been left\nbehind. Though Yoketron formed from the new Protoform, Yoketron\nchastised Prowl-Z for not accepting fate, telling him he &quot;...must not\nsacrifice a piece of the future to bring back the past.&quot; As he told\nProwl-Z that he would understand when his time came, Yoketron\nrelinquished his spark, and his new body grayed.\n**************\n\nSo yes Yoketron is dead, killed by Lockdown, however that leaves\nseveral things open - In who&#39;s employ was Lockdown, it could easily\nhave been BLUDGEON. The manner of Yoketron&#39;s death has been kept from\nthe public at large. In fact I would imagine that the story is that\nsince he was considered old, that he sucummed to the ravages of time.\nMOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS STORY.\n\nI am unsure at what point Tuscon and Nightshift left the Dojo and came\nto Earth, so he may not be aware that Yoketron is dead, or if he is,\nhe may not know how. I will leave that up to Sandy how much Tuscon and\nNightshift know and how much they may have told Straight Shot.\n\nHowever the revelation that Bludgeon could have been behind it, or\neven part of of it at all would be new knowledge. Most will not have\nany knowledge unless they have some special connection to someone who\nwas in on matters, or was in it themselves.\n\nI invite questions and/or comments.\n\n-  Preston\n\n"}}
