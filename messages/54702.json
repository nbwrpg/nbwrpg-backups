Light started to glow at the base of the display. As the Major\npunched some keys, the image of a tough looking bot formed.\n\nTyrael: This is, or rather was, my predecessor. I executed him on\norders of the Tripredacus council for his incompetence at keeping the\nPredacon Renegade Megatron. Megatron escaped his Maximal jailors and\nwas pursued by them here. I was ordered to lead the Tripredacus\nStrikers and to capture or terminate the criminal. You see, he is\nunpredictable and dangerous. He could have threatened our plans, but,\nfortunately, his absence from Cybertron only made it better.\n\nHe punched another key. It showed the battle in which the renegade had\nfused, right in front of his former ship.\n\nTyrael: While I was here trying to get Megatron, the Council decided\nto act. Led by General Blackheart, our forces conquered Cybertron with\nmuch ease. The Maximal Council got bogged down and they were either\neradicated or they fled. Here, however, Megatron fused with Galvatron\nhimself, leading to the creation of Hydras. He is a wicked one, and my\ngoal is still to take him out.\n\nOnce again, the image changed. It was the battle at Maximal Base,\nwhere he had lost his ship.\n\nTyrael: As you can see, my first command was lost. I was soon joined\nby General Blackheart himself and some of his most elite troops. Alas,\nthe General seems to have ceased all functions some time ago. I took\ncommand and am now the Tripredacus leader. With the fall of Cybertron,\nthough, our goal has changed. We will eradicate every bot on this\nplanet who does not willingly join us. The Rogues are a particularly\npesky band, and I would like to blast them all first, but that will be\nseen later.\n\nOnce again\n\n\n"}}
