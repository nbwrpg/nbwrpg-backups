Even if\nit didnt get past the armour, it would severly burn it, most likely. I&#39;m\nnot sure, but just standing on the ground isnt grounding it either, you\nneed rubber, wood, or glass, and even with those, if there is enough\nvoltage, it dosent matter if your grounded, it will still dammage things\na little. (IE: trees don&#39;t conduct, but if are struck by lightning are\ndestroyed).\n\n\n\nLegendarynemasis@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; And unless its grounded the Electricity will overload the systems if\n&gt; it is prolonged or a powerful enough blast. Much like if a lightning\n&gt; bolt hits a generator, it doesnt use that energy, it shorts out or in\n&gt; some cases explodes. Im not saying the electricity would short out\n&gt; trainwreck in one blast although it is intense, im just saying ti\n&gt; should hurt him some amount. Gemini Dragons firepower is rated at a\n&gt; 10 I believe...\n\n"}}
