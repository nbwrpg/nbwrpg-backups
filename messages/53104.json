Attacking their ship full\n&gt; &gt; frontal would only get you killed. You might try going for subtlety,\n&gt; &gt; but their defence seems good, so it would be risky. There&#39;s always\n&gt; &gt; time for an alliance, but with who, that remains to be seen. The\n&gt; &gt; decision is yours. What will you do?\n\n\n"}}
