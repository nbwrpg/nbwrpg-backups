First rule of thumb, act only in defense, and not in offense.  One\n&gt; of Yoketron&#39;s golden rules.  I haven&#39;t forgotten them even today.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He had learned a lot from Yoketron, and he thinks back on everything he was\n&gt; taught and how he developed into who he was today.  His temper still needed\n&gt; work, and he was aware of his weakness from day one.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll be honest with you, Big Convoy, I sought Yoketron&#39;s training because\n&gt; I have a weakness I needed to work on.  I have an extremely short fuse of a\n&gt; temper, and I&#39;m still working on it.  As a rookie, I knew right away I\n&gt; needed to do something about it, so I sought Yoketron&#39;s training, which did\n&gt; help somewhat but not completely.  But what he taught me, I consider it\n&gt; priceless. I hope to return to Yoketron to complete my training, because I\n&gt; do know I have not yet completed it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He closes his eyes for a moment, and slowly draws his sword into defense\n&gt; position.  His posture changes as he prepares to take a combative pose.  His\n&gt; feet and legs, appear to be ready to spring into action at a moment&#39;s\n&gt; notice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I think we&#39;ll be joined shortly by unwanted company.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\nEven as TUSCON spoke those words his com-links sprang to life as\nLONGRACK&#39;s voice began to speak across the channel, &quot;Sir. We have\ncopmmandeered part of their system. I am diverting the alerts away\nfrom your location.&quot;\n\nIt was obvious from BIG CONVOY&#39;s reaction that he was also recieving\nthe transmission. It was confirmed as CONVOY spoke, &quot;Can reach the\nother Maximals, they need to be warned?&quot;\n\nThere was a brief pause and then LONGRACK responded, &quot;No. We cannot\nreach them as yet, I will see if I can get a link.&quot;\n\nCONVOY grunted, &quot;Let me know as soon as you get one.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course sir.&quot; LONGRACK&#39;s voice was calm and factual, belying the\nfact that he was scrunched up at the top of an elevator shaft, hacking\ninto an enemies compter network.  &quot;If you continue to the left you\nwill be heading towards Rhinox&#39;s location. The systems list his\nquarters as close by section A-121 on your level.&quot;\n\nLONGRACK continued, &quot;Curious?&quot; There was a slight grunt, &quot;Did you are\nright outside of ?? . . .  Well of course you didn&#39;t. But you are\nright outside of what the computer lists as Rodimus&#39; chambers.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
