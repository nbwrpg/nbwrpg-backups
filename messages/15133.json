This not for \nmass moding or my little endeavour with JP3884, nothing like that. I am \nleaving because I have simply lost interest and ran out of ideas. I could \nkeep up if I wanted to time was not an issue. After I am gone to can do \nwhatever with my characters and the Pred Base. Good Bye everyone I had a \ngreat time rping with all of you. I just simply lost interest and motivation.\n\nPS: If you want to say Good bye to me don&#39;t do it over egroups because by the \ntime most of you get this message I will have already unsubscibed.\n\nGood bye everyone. I hope you can keep this RPG going forever :)!\n\n"}}
