As \nshe got closer, she heard the sounds of battle.  Lazar fire, grenades \nexploding, guns firing.  She smiled, &quot;Ah finally, a little \nexcitement.&quot;  She wouldn&#39;t get there for another half hour of flying \ntime. But with her sensitive hearing, she knew that when she got \nthere, she would see action.  She smiled at the thought.  Then she \nfrowned at remembering what a weak, peaceful bot she had been.  She \ncussed under her breath for being such a disgusting, snivelling, \nweakling of a bot.   She felt freed of her maximal tenancies and \nfound herself craving some fun on the battle field.\n\n\n"}}
