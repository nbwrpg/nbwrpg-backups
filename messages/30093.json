(Well actually, \n&gt;it&#39;s one of the later ones if you include the chars I used to have before I \n&gt;left the RPG and came back)  Also, I can&#39;t do much with Symphony because \n&gt;he&#39;s in stasis lock.\n&gt;OOC2:Alten, about seeing grosser things in posts, things involving parts \n&gt;like penises and tits and stuff is one thing, gore and violence is another. \n&gt;  Read on, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.\n&gt;\n&gt;::Composer/Orchestra/Skullgrin/Triggerhappy/Bodicons\n&gt;/Cutthroat::\n&gt;\n&gt;        Composer looked at the datapad, mumbling a few &quot;mm&#39;kay&quot;&#39;s and &quot;got \n&gt;that&quot;&#39;s, then threw it back to Wheeljack.\n&gt;\n&gt;         &quot;Okay, I got this figured out.  So, let&#39;s get to work.  Now, \n&gt;first, we need the materials and and other things like that, do we got that \n&gt;stuff?&quot; Composer asked.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Orchestra got out of his CR Chamber.  He was healed now.\n&gt;\n&gt;        &quot;That feels better,&quot; he said to himself.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Orchestra walked around the BlackFortress, giving himself a tour.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Skullgrin walked up to Triggerhappy, Gutclaw and Explobody.\n&gt;\n&gt;         &quot;Let&#39;s go back to base everybody!&quot; he suggested.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Triggerhappy flew off, and Skullgrin, Explobody and Gutclaw \n&gt;followed behind.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;        Decapitron, Headshot and Legtrap continued driving, and followed \n&gt;Condor to the cave where Condor, Symphony, Switchblade and the Terrorcons \n&gt;were.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Decapitron activated his brakes.  Headshot and Legtrap got out of \n&gt;Decapitron, then Decapitron transformed back to robot mode, and walked into \n&gt;the cave with Headshot and Legtrap close behind him.\n&gt;\n&gt;        &quot;Terrorcons!!!  We&#39;ve been given strict orders from Motormaster NOT \n&gt;to kill the Maximal hostage!&quot; Decapitron shouted.\n&gt;\n&gt;         &quot;I also highly suggest that you spare the life of that Maximal,&quot; \n&gt;Headshot said, then nodded at Symphony,&quot;Motormaster may have a use for him \n&gt;as well!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Legtrap tried shoving the Terrorcons out of the way, then trapped \n&gt;Symphony&#39;s body in a net.  He then dragged the ripped up Maximal in its net \n&gt;over to where Switchblade and Condor were.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Decapitron and Headshot walked over there as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;        &quot;As you said, let&#39;s keep this Maximal as well for a hostage.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;        Decapitron looked back at the Terrorcons.  They looked hungry.  \n&gt;Decapitron picked up Symphony&#39;s torn off arm, and tossed it to the \n&gt;Terrorcons to feed on, as well as some other bits and scraps of Maximal \n&gt;metal.\n&gt;\n&gt;        &quot;Chew on that,&quot; he muttered.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;       Cutthroat grabbed a small chunk of metal that had been torn from \n&gt;Symphony&#39;s back and scarfed it down, then he piggishly started tearing at \n&gt;Symphony&#39;s ripped off arm.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
