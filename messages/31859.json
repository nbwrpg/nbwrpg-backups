Now! It&#39;s cramped in here!&gt;\n&lt; Go away!&gt;\nSBM: &lt; Bite me!&gt; it pushed more.\nRight about now her spark was beating rapidly, meaning that her metabilism \nwas becoming hyperactive...the sort of rate her SBM needed to function at. \nThough, her rate of functions was much more quick them Prowls, her build to \nstrike with speed and not with brawn, though everything slowed down when she \nhad to resort to that.\n&lt; Noo!&gt;\nSlowly the SBM began to gain ground, pain eminating from every join in her \nbody as they began to mutate and expand, the exo-structire print of the \nnightmare beginning to imprint itself into her armor.\nSlowly and painfully her armor seemed to split down the middle, light \neminating from inside. And in a rush of speed and grinding of gears her \nentire body too the shape of the one thing that she hated the most, her \ninner self.\nSBM: &lt; You failed!&gt;\n&lt;...like always.&gt;\nNothing worked out as she planned, ever. Either something was in the way, \nbattle always interfeared, or people didn&#39;t follow commands.\nIt was deppressing, and she almost didn&#39;t remember what being happy felt \nlike.\nThe instincts of the beast mode tried to take over, but the sinking feeling \nof disappointment kept it at bay, too thick to go through.\nThe feeling was very strong and she wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Prowl felt \nit...but it seemed everything she felt these days seemed to leave him \nuneffected, so this probably wouldn&#39;t be any different.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
