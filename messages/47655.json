He looked around at the \nothers\n&gt; strewn about in the crash. Some he knew would never rise again, \nothers had\n&gt; already begun to move, to shake off the effects of the forced \nlanding.\n&gt; &quot;Everyone who isn&#39;t deactivated sound off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     His words while commanding were spoken lightly, no need to \nshoutat them\n&gt; yet after the crash. Sitting up in his chair he reached out touching \na comm\n&gt; button, frowning at the crackle and hiss as he opened the line to \nthe\n&gt; thruster section of the frigate. Smacking the panel with his \nmetallic fist\n&gt; he was rewarded by the ping of connection, &quot;Engineering report, how \nbad&#39;s\n&gt; the damage...can we lift off again anytime soon?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Shaking the last few webs of energon from his memory circuits he \ngot a\n&gt; good look outside the ships main window, or at least the massive \nshattered\n&gt; remains of the window. Outside the sky was clear and clouds covered \nthe sky\n&gt; in fluffy patches. At least they didn&#39;t land in the middle of a \ndesert,\n&gt; that&#39;s all they needed, sand in their joints, or worse, snow....he \ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; mind cold weather assignments so much it&#39;s just he disliked snow \nitself and\n&gt; the cold that came with it....\n&gt; \n&gt;     Shaking his head again he frowned, that window needed repairing \nif they\n&gt; were gonna lift off again, the blast doors that sheilded them could \nstill be\n&gt; working but flying based on sensors alone was always risky. Touching \nthe\n&gt; communication button again, &quot;Engineering, status on thrusters and \ngeneral\n&gt; ship systems.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC)\n&gt; \n&gt;     Just to beat rauq to the punch the first post for the new beast \nwars...\n&gt; :)\n\n\n"}}
