I had originally started gunning for a restart 6-7 months ago, \nI just never voiced the opinion in a poll, or explained why I wanted \na restart. Zardus convinced me that a restart wasn&#39;t necessary \nbefore, perhaps he was correct, but it&#39;s a little different this \ntime.\n\nDewboy: Ok, stop spamming your idea to us about how to end the NBW. \n=P We understand what you want to do, and we&#39;ll... think about it... \nyes... think about it.\n\nRID/BM = pathetic attempts at transformers. G1 all the way! =)\n\nJonathan: You had better help/be in charge of role-playing 101. \nEspecially when you just start you don&#39;t want your characters to \ndie. I don&#39;t think that any of my characters have really been in a \nsituation where either mine or Jer&#39;s(rdahl) bots could grab them. I \ndid end up having a few bots half slagged in battle, and Lynxiz has \na nasty scar where one of Soulstice&#39;s characters put a spear gun \nthrough her back. (she would have died, but other people on that \nfaction took her back to base)\n\nSometimes fights that should end quickly, don&#39;t and I kinda find it \nirritating. Example: the Perceptor/Firestrike fight. Firestrike has \nall the advantage. I kinda wanted it quickly, but Perceptor became \npsychic, shot the control panel (through Switchblade I might add), \nand knew every move that both Firestrike and Switchblade were going \nto do. (sorry airly, but sometimes your fights are a little far \nfetched)\n\nRole-playing 101 will likely be the best thing that could happen to \nthe rpg. We&#39;ll try it, but we&#39;ll need a plan...\n\nAbout car transformers in the rpg. Jer and I brought in the \nStunticons and Menasor when we joined. We had some fun causing some \nchaos. We even tried to get get to the Ark on the moon, but RyoD&#39;s \ncharacters somehow &quot;knew&quot; that we were going there, and decided to \nleave in a spaceship that was convieniently faster than ours. He had \nalso (apparently) planted several million space mines to take out \nintruders heading for the Ark. Jer and I were both going &quot;Ummm, wtf \nkinda BW rpg doesn&#39;t have the Ark as part of the conflict&quot;\n\nLN: When you came into the rpg, your bots, and everything about them \nwas far too powerful. You seemed to have everything planned out so \nthat your characters couldn&#39;t be killed, couldn&#39;t ever come into \nconflict where the couldn&#39;t win, couldn&#39;t be affected by anything \nunless you wanted them to. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but that \nconpletely turned me off from wanting to RP with your characters, no \nmatter how good an RPer you were. \n\nIf we had screwed the naysayers, we&#39;d have restarted 6 months ago \nwhen i wanted to originally...\n\nWell, if we intend to have a sequel (ie restart with another name) \nthen OOC posts are going to be too much of a problem. However, we DO \nhave a messageboard on the website that all people can log in and \nuse. Perhaps we should continues this discussion on on the \nmessageboard. =)\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sequels would be  good. And if we did have one I would come back \nass then \n&gt; there could be a new story. Of course, you would have to end this \none first \n&gt; some how. Yes.... and apparrently Apocalyptic mails are \nunfavorable. But you \n&gt; know, you and Hugar are the council members. you control the fate \nof the RPG. \n&gt; YOu shouldnt be concerned with how the people are acting, I&#39;ve \nnoticed a \n&gt; genral decline of posters that were here before, where have \nGunthers and \n&gt; Rudra gone? Heh, I told you before the RPG was becoming way over \ndone but \n&gt; noone listened. And now you seem to realize it so now I feel I can \nsay... I \n&gt; told you so.\n\n\n"}}
