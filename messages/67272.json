Red like the landscape it flew from, it rose \ninto \n&gt;  the a=\r\nir. Then with a smooth twist of hue it turned black as the \n&gt;  shadows of s=\r\npace enveloped it. Like some black fog hunter-\n&gt;  terminators, or sweeps as=\r\n some call them, along with their leader \n&gt;  Scourge, gathered themselves u=\r\nnder the direction of the mighty \n&gt;  Cyclonus. Then with lightening swiftne=\r\nss boosters flared turning \nthe \n&gt;  surface of the moon crimson for the bri=\r\nefest of moments before \nthey \n&gt;  struck out across open space, moving with=\r\n precision and ease \ntoward \n&gt;  the unsuspecting inhabitants of the earth. =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Inside the pacifist Maximal base in Atlantis the computers \ncontinu=\r\ned \n&gt;  to monitor the grounds, primarily attempting to keep track of the \n&gt;=\r\n  fleeing Trelos. But as always a few cones were pointed skyward, \n&gt;  alway=\r\ns on the look out for Minions. What they saw today the \ncomputers \n&gt;  had n=\r\no way to understand. Something that was there and yet not \nthere. \n&gt;  The s=\r\nlightest bit of distortion, that under normal circumstances \n&gt;  would have =\r\nbeen ignored, but in this case was large, and worse \nyet, \n&gt;  it was moving=\r\n. (OOC: Think of Predator&#39;s invisibility when he \nmoved) \n&gt;  \n&gt;  A yellow w=\r\narning light began to go off in the pacifist command \n&gt;  center, as the com=\r\nputer screen automatically projected course and \n&gt;  heading. Approximated h=\r\neading: Atlantis. Unfortunately no one was \n&gt;  there to notice.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  On t=\r\nhe grounds of Atlantis the pursuit of Trelos continues as \nseveral \n&gt;  Maxi=\r\nmals attempt to retrieve the rather elusive Predacon from his \n&gt;  newest hi=\r\nding spot, underwater. One boat is on the water \nobviously \n&gt;  searching, w=\r\nhile a floating car hovers over the waters doing its \nown \n&gt;  search. Meanw=\r\nhile Rodimus has noted a rather odd dot in the \nskies, \n&gt;  one that he can =\r\nsee to be a Predacon eagle. He is pointing at it. \nAnd \n&gt;  even as he is do=\r\ning this he notes something strange coming from \n&gt;  behind the eagle. The s=\r\nky for a moment seems to flash and ripple, \n&gt;  almost like lightning, and y=\r\net there is a slight rotation to the \n&gt;  flashes. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the skies abov=\r\ne the eagle looks down noting Rodimus pointing \nat \n&gt;  him, and he begins t=\r\no drop out of the skies moving out over open \n&gt;  water, preparing either to=\r\n flee, or do a strafing run. In either \ncase \n&gt;  he is totally unaware of w=\r\nhat is transpiring over his head.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  On the grounds below Rodimus can s=\r\nee what is coming as his \nenhanced \n&gt;  vision sees two very tiny dots spira=\r\nling out from the rippling \n&gt;  flashes. At the same time Klaxons begin to g=\r\no off as base \ncomputers \n&gt;  do actually recognize this threat: MISSILES!\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  Erupting out of the skies, twin missiles streak across the skies, \n&gt; =\r\n vortexes of flames spiraling after them like crimson, cone shaped \n&gt;  cont=\r\nrails. They slam into communication towers, and the towers as \n&gt;  well as a=\r\n few outlying buildings burst into flames. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  In the background, almos=\r\nt unnoticed, a Myrmidon spirals out of \nthe \n&gt;  skies, the recipient of sev=\r\neral laser blasts. Small gouts of \nflames \n&gt;  flowing from him even as he i=\r\nmpacts the water. Myrmidon sinks \nbeneath \n&gt;  the waves.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  And flying =\r\nfrom amidst this bombardment Cyclonus rises high into \nthe \n&gt;  air.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  =\r\n&quot;The days you have known are over. All that you have belongs to \nus! \n&gt;  Re=\r\nsist and be destroyed!! THE MINIONS OF UNICRON HAVE COME!&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Even Cycl=\r\nonus spoke sweeps arrive seeming to almost darken the \nskies \n&gt;  for a moms=\r\nnt, disintegrator blasts providing bright flashes of \nlight \n&gt;  as they bat=\r\nh Atlantis and the Maximal base in war.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - =\r\n- - - - - - - - - -\n&gt;  \n&gt;  OOC: I am sure other Maximal and Predacon bases/=\r\nHQ&#39;s will note \n&gt;  something similar to what the Maximal base in Atlantis n=\r\noted, \nfeel \n&gt;  free for anyone to jump in, if it makes sense. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  The =\r\nonly thing of note is that the Sweeps and Scourge cannot be \n&gt;  locked on t=\r\no with sensors (check out their profiles on wiki). \nThat \n&gt;  should not aff=\r\nect most of you very much, since most of you shoot \nby \n&gt;  sight anyways, u=\r\nnless you are using base sensors or some remote \n&gt;  sensing capability. \n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt;  Also any Minions that chose to come with are in this group as \nwell.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;      \n&gt;                                \n&gt; \n&gt;  ____________________=\r\n______________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
