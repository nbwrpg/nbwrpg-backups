She did keep her word. If she was going to \nhit you, by Primus she was going to hit you. He backed up, and shifted his \nlong body until he could turn around. He passed the main computer room and \ncame to a different vent face. He punched it out with a very large claw. He \ncrawled down the wall of the room.\n\nHe transformed to robot mode and looked around. From the looks of it, he was \nin the engine room. He knew now that he wasn&#39;t going to get a chance to do \nwhat Megatron told him to do.\n\nHe had a crazy, suicial idea.
