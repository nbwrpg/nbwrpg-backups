A very\ndark and Sinister looking one taking up the lead, with a proud blue\nwarrior in the front, and a swaggering gorilla. Beside them walked four\nsmall robots, each 4 feet in height. The gorilla began to pound his\nchest. &quot;Yes, for to long you tell us not to fight in war&quot; he howled\npointing at the three characters around the table. &quot;Me very sick of you&quot;\nhe said, spitting a large gob of oil onto the table. \n\nThe three predacons could barely keep from gagging, this gorilla emmited\na disgusting oder. &quot;The gruffer one took time to finally break the\nbraggarts speech. &quot;Well now we want you to fight. The Autobots are going\nto try something, and if we are ever going to revolt, they musnt be\nallowed to see what has happened on earth&quot; he says. &quot;Speaking of which&quot;\nanother one started. &quot;It is time we contacted Motormaster. He turned\naround, and clicked a few keys with a nimble hand, a moniter roaring to\nlife, and begining to send a message across space, and time.\n\n"}}
