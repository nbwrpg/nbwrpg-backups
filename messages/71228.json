I added it\nin, but=\r\n it is not as smooth as I would have liked it to be. Ahh well\nsuch is life.=\r\n Good posting Sandy by the way! :)\n\nIC:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Legacy=\r\n on a dime. He did not like his tone of voice, and\n&gt; felt that his explanat=\r\nion could have been a little less brash. Especially\n&gt; when you&#39;re addressin=\r\ng a Prime officer. His expression hardens quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I appreciate your =\r\nconcerns but I do NOT appreciate your tone of voice!\n&gt; It&#39;s as if you&#39;re tr=\r\nying to stop me from doing what needs to be done! This\n&gt; war can not be fou=\r\nght by ourselves, they out number us! And I will do\n&gt; everything in my powe=\r\nr to be sure that our numbers stay stable!&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nYes, sometimes the unthinkable must be the thinkable. It was his way of\n&gt; s=\r\naying that in desperate times, desperate measures can not be avoided. Even\n=\r\n&gt; if the balance of time does get disrupted.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Exactly. =\r\nWe need help, and maybe it isn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime,\n&gt; but we mu=\r\nst try and revive others to assist us in battle. Legacy, I warn\n&gt; you now, =\r\ninsubordination will not be tolerated. Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy s=\r\ntood his ground, his stance not aggressive but simply solid\nand ready as he=\r\n watched Tuscon. If Legacy had any fear of Tuscon or\nthe power that he poss=\r\nessed or the anger that may be unleashed there\nwas not a hint of it on Lega=\r\ncy=92s face or demeanor. Neither was there\nany hint of it in his next state=\r\nment. =93Your rank and objectives are\nduly noted and are at this juncture i=\r\nrrelevant.=94\n\nLegacy=92s words are completely devoid of anger, aggression =\r\nand tact.\nThey are instead just simple statements of fact as he sees them.\n=\r\n\n=93Legacy what are you doing?=94 A voice rippled across the room =96 LORD\n=\r\nELDER! =93You can=92t stand against a Prime!=94\n\n=93I am a temporal guardia=\r\nn sent back to insure that all things unfold\nas they should and I will stan=\r\nd against any force that would attempt\nto disrupt that.=94 Legacy folded hi=\r\ns arms behind his back, which had\nthe affect of focusing his weapons away f=\r\nrom Tuscon. There was still\nno hint of aggression in his tone or stance, an=\r\nd for a bot as\npowerfully built as Legacy that was a difficult task. Legacy=\r\n was tall\nand sturdily built and he was, except for his color, was an exact=\r\n\n=91physical=92 replica of Shockblast; He bore a cannon on one hand and the=\r\n\nother hand that WAS a cannon and he possessed a remorseless\nunflinching cy=\r\nclopean gaze with which he was currently directing at\nTuscon.\n\nElder, who l=\r\nooked startlingly bigger and more robust stepped into the\nroom, walking to =\r\nstand between Legacy and Tuscon. =93I am not talking\nabout COMBAT.=94 He sa=\r\nid looking at the tall form of Legacy, =93I am\ntalking about respect, chain=\r\n of command, duty, honor, the things we\nMaximals stand for.=94\n\nLegacy look=\r\ned down at Lord Elder, his single optic pulsing\nthoughtfully, =93Your emoti=\r\nonal adherence to respect is inefficient, I\ncould not allow any disturbance=\r\n to the Autobots and Decepticons that\nlay here.=94\n\nLord Elder patted Legac=\r\ny on the shoulder, having to reach up slightly\nto do so. =93I know Legacy, =\r\nI know, but it is what makes us different\nfrom the predacons.=94\n\nLegacy pa=\r\nused obviously not agreeing.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor looked at tucson and sa=\r\nid coldy &quot;that&#39;s a strategy that we cannot\n&gt; afford, but&quot;he added with anot=\r\nher tone&quot;We can ask to pacificus Maximals to\n&gt; join us... and fuse both fac=\r\ntions, that will give us enough streght to face\n&gt; hydras and whoever dares =\r\nto challenge us... By now we must to find a way to\n&gt; protect the ark&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n\nLord Elder nodded as he turned to Perceptor and the others, =93Yes! We=\r\n\ncan attempt to bring in others help us.=94 Lord Elder glanced between\nTusc=\r\non and Legacy hoping that Tuscon would catch the hint, you can=92t\nbrow bea=\r\nt Legacy, you have to reason with him.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson acknlowedges Per=\r\nceptor but still holds a rather cold expression on his face, which was most=\r\nly meant for Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Very well Perceptor, I will hold off until we are=\r\n able to contact the Pacificus Maximals. If we can not reach them, then we =\r\nmight have to resort to other measures.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy appears unaffected =\r\nby Tuscon=92s cold glance, however the shield\nthat was over Optimus Prime d=\r\nropped. Lord Elder just shook his head as\nhe stepped out from between them =\r\nbreathing an audiable sigh of relief,\nhopefully the disaster has been avert=\r\ned for the moment.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Without further word, Tucson quietly walks =\r\nover to the body of Optimus Prime, and just stands beside him. It would app=\r\near that Straight Shot was right. He had learned so much, but missed the op=\r\nportunity to learn the wisdom he feared he was missing. He kneels in front =\r\nof the sleeping Autobot Commander.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Once again I almost made a costly =\r\nmistake. I learned so much from my comrades and I&#39;m grateful for the knowle=\r\ndge they&#39;ve given me, but still, Optimus, I wish I could have learned your =\r\nwisdom. I could really use it now. So much happening at once and I don&#39;t kn=\r\now where to begin doing something about it. I should know these things by n=\r\now, that&#39;s why I was given the power of leadership. I can&#39;t let them down, =\r\nnot this time. My comrades have seen enough grief, they don&#39;t need any more=\r\n of it. Now I wish we did have time to work together, one on one. That way =\r\nI would be prepared for what comes next.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy said nothing as Tu=\r\nscon turned away and began talking with\nOptimus Prime. After noting Tuscon=\r\n=92s actions Legacy also turned and\nwalked away, seemingly harboring no ill=\r\n will for Tuscon, his only goal\nthe protection of the Ark and most notably =\r\nthe current time stream.\n\n[MEANWHILE IN THE MEDBAY]\n\nRodimus sat over his w=\r\nife as she seemed to waken . . .\n\n&gt; Nightligh tried to make a big sfort to =\r\nsit down but her energy\n&gt; levels, on purpose, were to low for that, she sto=\r\npped too weak to\n&gt; move and said &quot;Rodimus... Are you you?... Is that nightm=\r\nare finaly\n&gt; over????&quot;\n\nRodimus leaned close to her so that she could clear=\r\nly hear his words\nand see his face. =93Yes my love, the darkness has past, =\r\nthe nightmare\nhas ended.=94\n\nRodimus smiled warmly and encouragingly as he =\r\ngently turned up her\npower levels a little and helped her sit up. =93You ar=\r\ne safe at the\nArk.=94\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
