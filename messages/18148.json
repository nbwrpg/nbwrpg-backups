He \ndodges the dark flame rocket, but Gets hit by the dark heat blasts. He fired \n18 rapid fire optic blasts at Nemises Enforcer, 12 energy blasts at Dark One, \n12 at Astral, and 12 at Fenox.  Sharpedge shoots the grenades to destroy \nthem, but only one is destroyed.  The other one hit his foot, and destroyed \nit.  he gets hit in the leg by the gatling guns.  Now limping, he fires 1 \nmissle up at Scattershot, and 1 at Recklessa::\n\n"}}
