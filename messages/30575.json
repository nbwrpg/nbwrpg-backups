She was out of breath, but glad \nshe made it finally. She opened her commlink. &quot;Hello, anyone inside \nthe base? It&#39;s me, KitKat. Let me in, please.&quot;  She transformed into \nbot mode and waited outside.\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe saw KitKat3 out side, &quot;Welcome back.  You might want to get in \nhere, trouble is around.&quot; She opened the entrance for KitKat3\n\n::KitKat3::\nShe walked in, and looked around.  She was impressed with how things \nhad changed and how well the Pack had done in her absences.  She went \ndown the hall, wondering who she might find. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::KitKat2::\nShe wandered around for a while.  She followed her nose.  She thought \nshe was backtracking her own scent, but in actuallity, she was \nfollowing the scent of her now twin.  She followed it to the base, \nbut it wasn&#39;t the BlackFortress.  She sniffed around and noticed the \nscent of other preds, but none from her pack.  She stood outside the \nentrance and waited. \n\n\n"}}
