Now, if I wanted to, I could constrict your weapons to the point=\r\n of implosion, just with a coil of my tail but, I think I&#39;ll be nice this t=\r\nime and spare you all the humility. I wouldn&#39;t want you to look bad around =\r\nyour master would I?  But how fun it would be to sssstrangle all of you in =\r\nthe coils of my tail.&quot;\n\nHe talks with a chilling hiss in his voice.  He kne=\r\nw that a little theatrics went a long way.  When in doubt play the part of =\r\na beast that is commonly feared for his predatory nature.  It was definitel=\r\ny not in his character but he knew he had to step outside the box this time=\r\n.  Everyone depended on him, and he wasn&#39;t about to let anyone down.  \n\nAlo=\r\nng the way, he comes across a piece of metal on the ground.  It gets caught=\r\n in his tail which coils around it, breaking it into tiny pieces,\n\nPerpetua=\r\nlly on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Sep 22, 2011, at 12:08 PM, Super =\r\nCyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson backs awa=\r\ny with a smug grin of his own.
