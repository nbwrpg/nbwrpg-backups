Now he wants Panzertron (the\nbot)\n&gt; to be simply left in the IF.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/The Oblitercons/DevilDuer/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus growls as Deemos crawls off (that was pretty cheap, Soulstice, I\n&gt; didn&#39;t get a chance to respond). &quot;Kill him,&quot; he says into his comm-link,\n&gt; sending it to all Alliance members.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Oblitercons nod, Dark one flying up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oblitercons, unite!&quot; he orders, the other four jumping up and\ntransforming\n&gt; into various body parts. In several seconds, Oblitertron roars, running\nafter\n&gt; Surge, firing his giant laser gun, along with his optic lasers at the\n&gt; Maximal. He slowly gains on Surge, continuing to fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; Behind him, Zardus, Reptilica, and Bloodystrike follow behind, also firing\n&gt; their weapons at Deemos and group, their jetpacks blazing on full power in\n&gt; order to keep up with the giant bot.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer looks around him, at the Alliance bots still there. &quot;I think we\n&gt; should get back to base,&quot; he says, &quot;Anyone need a CR chamber?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
