Now I need a few (the more the better) to help me test it.\n\nThe script can be found at:\n\nhttp://nbwrpg.com/nbwrpg/cgi-bin/Login/login.cgi\n\nWhat I want you guys to do is log in as the test account (username:\n&quot;test&quot;, password: &quot;test&quot;. CASE SENSITIVE, no quote marks), and put the\nserver through as much hell as possible. Make profiles with funky\ncharacters, HTML code, names with spaces, names with funky characters,\nanything imaginable to try to completely confuse the system. If it\ncrashes on you, please email me and tell me exactly what you did prior\nto it crashing, and I&#39;ll fix the bug. Right now all that is available\nis the character editor/maker/viewer/killer, but as soon as it is\ntotaly debugged, more stuff will be made available, like polls, chat,\nand stuff like that.\n\nI hope as many people as possible participate in this. Besides, its\nfun crashing my comp, and here&#39;s your chance to! :-)\n\nI&#39;ll be expecting a flood of bug reports tomorrow. Get to work,\ntesters! I&#39;m also totaly wasted from all the programming, so I&#39;m going\nto bed. Goodnight, everyone.\n\n\n"}}
