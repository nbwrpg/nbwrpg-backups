A transmission to the Predacon base is eminating \nfrom one of the CF&#39;s rooms.  I&#39;ve tracked the room.  I&#39;m going to seal it and \nhave a few Maxis guard it until we&#39;re ready to move in.&quot;\n\nChordate pressed a few buttons, initiating a security lock down for the room \nsending out the transmission (The one BrightBlade is in).  \n\nThe only door to the room seals shut, only being able to be opened via the \nbridge, and the &#39;air vents&#39; sealed shut, a steel plate coming down from the \ninside and shutting behind it, making the only air vent unaccessable.\n\nThree feet behind that one, several bars 5 inches wide slid upwards, locking \nto form another barrier.\n\n---\n\nChordate looked at the scanners once more.  \n\n&quot;No energy signature, slag I hate cloaking devices.&quot; Chordate activated the \nfire systems, several sprinklers activating in the room, foam flame retardent \nerupting out of the side of the walls all over.\n\nChordate activated the intercom.  &quot;Attention, intruder, you&#39;re never going to \nget out, that is all.&quot;\n\nChordate chuckled, reactivating the intercom.  &quot;I request at least three \nMaximals to go to (saying the name of the room doesn&#39;t work for me, so let&#39;s \npretend Chordate just did, since I have no idea what room BrightBlade picked, \nbut Chordate&#39;s scanners would), there is a cloaked intruder there.  It is \nsealed shut.  I will wait till you get there, and advise youf urther.&quot; \n\n"}}
