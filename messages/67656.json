Desp=\r\nite his massive\nappearance, he managed to stay hidden most of the time. He =\r\nwas vaguely\nknown, asa rumor in the hoodlums of the city.\n\nLittle by little=\r\n, he approached Silver Wings throughout the city. He\nspoke with them, liste=\r\nned to them. They had been ravaged by the\nuprising the Iron Skulls had lead=\r\n and viewed Jotunn&#39;s demotion as a\ncandy punishment. The perpetrators, the =\r\nsoldiers themselves, had\nbarely been chastised for that, and resentment was=\r\n strong because of\nthis inaction among the surviving population.\n\nHe agreed=\r\n with them, and told them they should get even in one way or\nanother. Like =\r\na prophet, people took him to heart and remembered him.\nHe was hope for the=\r\n wounded, the hope of recovery and vengeance. He\nonly asked them not to spe=\r\nak directly of him. His influence grew by\nthe cycle.\n\n*********************=\r\n************\n\nIntelligence reports had been scarce inside the city. Deadfur=\r\n didn&#39;t\nlike that. They&#39;d lost contacts there, and he&#39;d decided to stay to\n=\r\nhelp rebuilding\n\nWhen an agent told him someone looking like the missing Se=\r\nrgeant Ultra\nMagnus was talking of getting back at the Iron Skulls in the p=\r\neople&#39;s\narea, that worried him. But, he didn&#39;t want to take decisions on th=\r\nat\nhimself. He went to Razorwing and handed him the datapad that\ncontained =\r\nthe report.\n\nDeafur: What d&#39;you make of that? Should we worry?\n\n\n"}}
