I could use a partner like \nyourself....between me and you, I plan on finding Megatron. At least he has \nambition, instead of just pointless battles.&quot;\n    He then turned to Kitkat, &quot;So, what is your answer?!&quot;\n\n    Megatron drew back in suspicion as Adrax opened the door and looked down \non them. He didnt look thrilled to see them....\n    &quot;Two fools from the valley. Why do you bother us/ we want to be left in \nsolitude!&quot; Adrax yelled.\n    Megatron turned on the charm. &quot;Ah, Adrax! Long time scince...well...who \ncan remember. Listen, I need a place to lay low for awhile...&quot;\n    Adrax glared. &quot;You want a place to be safe while you plot the demise of \nthe Maximlas....and Predacons.&quot;\n    &quot;You know about that?&quot;\n    &quot;Yes, Autofire and myself keep track of theres things.&quot;\n    &quot;Oh, yes. Of course...&quot;\n    Meg&#39;s trailed off. He didnt know what to do. He had to stay here, there \nwas no where else. &quot;If you let us stay, we will work to join the Predacons as \none. I swaer on my rank.&quot;\n    &quot;You have no rank scum! But....with a large group of Predacons, we would \ndominate and bring all this mess under order.&quot; Adrax pondered.\n    &quot;Yes, we would. How bout it?&quot; Megatron said with a smile.\n    Adrax said nothing, and opened the door.\n\n"}}
