His \nhands slide to her back as as she puts her head on his shoulder, clearing the \nthought of the battle or of damage totaly from his mind as he felt her \nagainst him. He nods as he hears her speak, the vibrations sending an \nexciting feeling up his spine.\n\n&quot;All right,&quot; he says, his breath speeding up as she strokes his neck. \nWhatever he was about to add was forgotten as she quickly kisses him, walking \noff toward Plintissa.\n\nHe follows her, his eyes glued to her body as she moves toward Plintissa. He \nwalks up to her as Plintissa and Dracona do, and puts an arm around her \nwaist, pressing her to him. He growls silently as he hears the sound of shots \nfollowed by an avalance outside.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll go see what&#39;s up,&quot; he says, kissing Iron Raptor, reluctantly letting go \nof her, and walking off toward the exit of the Ark, his hand on his gun just \nin case.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker walks out of the CR chamber, recieving Bronko&#39;s transmission. He \ncurses under his breath, sending a comm to Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;A bot has just sent a transmission that requires your attention,&quot; he says \ninto his comm-link, walking off toward the bridge,\n\n"}}
