Do what any respective GM would d, adopt the cahrachters \ninto their \n&gt; own and try to spread them amongst players. Heh If I was a council \nmember i&#39;d \n&gt; do it. I&#39;ve GMed a few years so I know what to do and when to do \nit. Right \n&gt; now the RPG is losing people left and right and that needs to be \nstopped.\n\n\n"}}
