He did not want any fighting in the Ark among any Maximal, Pred=\r\nacon or Autobot for that matter.  But bringing them all together under one =\r\nbanner would be most difficult especially to a new Prime who was just start=\r\ning out.  He uses his sonar systems to follow Ramulus, Cheetor and Lord Eld=\r\ner, transforms into truck mode, and rolls at a reasonable speed up to Lord =\r\nElder, and rolls slowly beside him.  \n\n&quot; Your words are very wise Lord Elde=\r\nr.  Bringing everyone together will not be easy, and I admit, I don&#39;t know =\r\neverything either.  But I do know that I sense great strength among our gro=\r\nup, a strength I&#39;ve never quite sensed before.  A strength to overcome diff=\r\nerences and to be able to work together under one roof.  We just need to le=\r\narn how to tap into that strength and we haven&#39;t quite gotten that far, at =\r\nleast, I haven&#39;t.&quot;\n\nHe stops and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n\n&quot;Get in, wh=\r\neels work faster than feet.&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carro=\r\nll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Must we always assume the worst Cheet=\r\nor? Must we always follow a similar path even if it may lead us over a clif=\r\nf to our demise? Talon is right, Perceptor risked his own life so that we m=\r\nay still remain functionable. If he were to turn his back on us, he would h=\r\nave done that vorns ago. Now, I will not hear another negative word about P=\r\nerceptor. Not in my pressence. He has risked his life for us, and now we mu=\r\nst do him the respect of showing him our thanks for his efforts. Now, enoug=\r\nh bickering, we have a tunnel to seal off and Rodimus Prime to bring back o=\r\nnline. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to see any of you bickering either. Am I u=\r\nnderstood Cheetor?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheetor looked at Tuscon, his optics cool yet dim,=\r\n then he finally\n&gt; nodded, &quot;You are in charge.&quot; he said, sounding sullen an=\r\nd crestfallen.\n&gt; &quot;If you say it, then it must be true.&quot; He turned and began=\r\n walking\n&gt; back toward the Ark, his shoulders slumped, his head bowed a lit=\r\ntle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus had glanced back at Cheetor and then Tuscon, and then jus=\r\nt\n&gt; shook his head again as he continued to walk away. He had been helping\n=\r\n&gt; Rhinox, perhaps it was time for him to return to that mission. Too\n&gt; much=\r\n time around the Ark never made him feel good. he prefered the\n&gt; wide open =\r\nout doors, not to be confined to and one spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, ya know Lord El=\r\nder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure knows his words of wisdom. Defi=\r\nnitely what Optimus Prime would&#39;ve done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder watched Cheetor w=\r\nalk back to the Ark as well, as he\n&gt; listened to Quickstride. Elder folded =\r\nhis arms behind his back as he\n&gt; turned to look back at Quickstride, &quot;Is it=\r\n?&quot; Elder asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Trust cannot be demanded or commanded only earned.&quot; H=\r\ne said quietly.\n&gt; &quot;Cheetor was not with you to watch the events that you sa=\r\nw that caused\n&gt; you to come to trust Perceptor, how can he be expected to t=\r\nrust\n&gt; without it?&quot; Elder&#39;s voice was not accusatory but calm and reasoning=\r\n.\n&gt; &quot;Cheetor only knows what he sees here and now, and that is a Predacon\n&gt;=\r\n that he has fought against for a long time. It will take time to get\n&gt; ove=\r\nr that, to see him as a companion, perhaps one day as a friend.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder=\r\n turned to look back at Perceptor, &quot;And it will take Perceptor\n&gt; time to co=\r\nme to realize his new role here, and that the life that he\n&gt; has known has =\r\nended, he has a new part to play.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder looked at Cheetor and Ramulus=\r\n for a moment, watching each one\n&gt; walk away in different directions. &quot;It i=\r\ns Tuscon&#39;s job now to bring us\n&gt; together, unite us under a common banner. =\r\nThat is the hardest part of\n&gt; being a leader, not just leading but inspirin=\r\ng others to follow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder turned to follow after Cheetor, his steps q=\r\nuick to catch up with\n&gt; the swift Maximal, he would need a pep talk.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\nTAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
