Please do not assume that a character you have\nhas worked with another character or has been friends or enemies of a\ncertain character without discussing it first, its only fairt here\ncould be factors that you as a player are unaware of.\n\nI have modified the histories of some of the characters from what they\nwere in the cartoon to merge the competing continuities together. Some\nthings do not easily fit together and so require me to get creative\nand also Most the time I will probrably say yes, but there will be\nsometimes I will have to say no and the same with other people as\nwell.\n\nAnyways,\nGame on!\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
