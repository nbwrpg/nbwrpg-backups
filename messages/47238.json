A new poll has been created for the \nnbwrpg group:\n\nI think the council usurped power for \nthe restart decision which should belong \nto the playeres.  Also I think so many \nnew players are here that neither \nrestart nor sequel is required.  We \nshould just put all the inactive chars \nin a magnetic field until the owners \nreturn.  Do you agree? \n\n  o yes, the council usurped power \n  o no, the council still usurped power \n  o yes, but the council did not usurp power \n  o no, the council did not usurp power \n  o what does usurp mean? \n\n\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/polls \n\nNote: Please do not reply to this message.
