The Maximal had to do something to \nkeep his strength up. he had to transform and conserve energy.\n\nLunarpine transformed to his Wolf mode and began to drink from the \nstream.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Darkness had fallen on the land, the moon shown brightly over him, \n&gt; Lunarpine could feel his solar converters beginning to work. he was \n&gt; getting stronger, his internal systems had repaired the mech fluid \n&gt; leaks so he wasn&#39;t going to slip into stasis. He didn&#39;t want to \n&gt; chance transforming to wolf for fear he wouldn&#39;t have the energy to \n&gt; change back if he had to fight. landmarks were beginning to look \n&gt; familiar so he knew he was headed in the right direction.

He used his \n&gt; right arm\n&gt; &gt; to get back on his feat, it was only a matter of time before the \n&gt; pred\n&gt; &gt; realized it was duped and returned.
