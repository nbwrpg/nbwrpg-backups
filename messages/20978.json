A female \nPredacon \n&gt; leader? he thought.  Interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My coordinates are 87-1-28 Sector Eminent.  How many troops will \nyou be \n&gt; sending?

Dark \nOne \n&gt; transformed into his jet fighter mode, his cockpit opening and Hiss \nclimbing \n&gt; inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark One took off for the base, the three other Oblitercons \nclimbing into a \n&gt; shuttle that took off after Dark One.\n\n\n"}}
