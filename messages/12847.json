Are you nuts?&quot;  Her instincts told \nher to listen to this bot.  She felt stupid for doing it, but she ran \nfor the clearing.  She was jogging more than running.  She ran back \nthrough the trees.  She weaved in and out through the groves and into \nthe clearing.  She stayed near the trees, but out far enough to get a \nclear shot at the bot trying to kill her.  She stopped and tried to \ncatch her breath.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DeathScythe/Ramulus::\n&gt; \n&gt; DeathScythe chuckles to himself.
