Dracona pointed to Panthyria.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Panthyria, she&#39;s new around here!&quot; Dracona\n&gt; said. Plintissa nodded.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hello, Panthyria, nice to see another GOOD Maximal\n&gt; make it to the planet,\n&gt; because there&#39;s some pretty rotten ones here you\n&gt; have to watch out for.\n&gt; First, Ramhorn, accuses people of killing when they\n&gt; did nothing, second,\n&gt; Iron Raptor, sad to say but it&#39;s true, Iron Raptor\n&gt; became my friend and\n&gt; dumped me as soon as she got a boyfriend, and third,\n&gt; Liono, the leader of\n&gt; the Maximals, watch out for him, because Suukie took\n&gt; many shots for him and\n&gt; he never thanked him and then he insulted me and my\n&gt; team, even after I\n&gt; protected him he still insulted me!&quot; Plintissa said\n&gt; to Panthyria. Plintissa\n&gt; gasped and looked around, no Suukie in sight.\n&gt; Plintissa walked over and\n&gt; grabbed the note off of Stronghold, who never ceased\n&gt; his card game.\n&gt; Plintissa read it and found that Suukie was at the\n&gt; Predacon base to prove\n&gt; himself because he had been a burden the time he was\n&gt; repairing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right, troops! line up!&quot; Plintissa ordered.\n&gt; Dracona walked into line,\n&gt; and then Airbomber, then Stranato, then Train Wreck,\n&gt; then Arrow, and then,\n&gt; with a little persuasion, Scamrock and Stronghold.\n&gt; Sinesis and Sinister came\n&gt; walking up, looking angrier than ever before!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Panthyria, you can help us if you wish to, we need\n&gt; help, we have to go to\n&gt; the Pred base and battle the Predacons, Suukie is\n&gt; there and he&#39;s going to be\n&gt; killed if we don&#39;t do anything, so lets MOVE IT!&quot;\n&gt; Plintissa ordered. The\n&gt; People&#39;s Group (I&#39;m just going to call it the\n&gt; populists from now on, it&#39;s\n&gt; easier.) turned into their Beast Modes. Plintissa\n&gt; sent a come right away\n&gt; comm message to Wrath and Kamodia and The Populists\n&gt; were on their way to the\n&gt; Pred base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suukie aproached the Predacon base and fired at the\n&gt; base insanely, not\n&gt; thinking about his own welfare...\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 11, 2000 12:43 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramhorn/Beachcomber/Smokescreen:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramhorn looked to Plintissa.  &quot;Apology not\n&gt; accepted.
