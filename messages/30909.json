He will think he has always\n&gt; been a Decepticon&quot;. What Megatron wasnt telling everyone, was that he was\n&gt; also putting in a fail safe. At the Bodicons words, he turn around done,\n&gt; and retracts his slithery mechanism. &quot;Yes I have big plans, and you five\n&gt; will get to see some action, are you all fully energized?&quot; he asked. He\n&gt; then responded to the comm links, &quot;Astroblast, refuel, we will need you\n&gt; soon. Stunticons, you are all dismissed, Terrorcons, Terrorcons,&quot; Megatron\n&gt; was having problems reaching them. He shut down his comm-link, and left the\n&gt; room. &quot;Worry about Condor later Switchblade, we have a world to take.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
