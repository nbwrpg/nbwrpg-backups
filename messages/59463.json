I can&#39;t remember where Cheetor was \nduring this battle &gt;_&lt; Plus I got a madeup, should I post the bio here \ntoo?\n\n~Past~\nCheetor snapped his head up at the sound of familar weaponry, eyes \nscanning for the source, already knowing who it was.  `Not again,&#39; was \nall he could think. The side of good was to win, no one was supposed to \ndie. So many had already passed on to the Matrix. He growled to \nhimself, he should be out there helping, not stuck inside this ancient \nship that was their way home. His hands tightened, the metal creaking \nunder his restraint. \n\nHe let out a yell of rage, slamming his hand down on the controls just \nas Rhinox beside him spoke of Shadimus. &quot;Rest in peace,&quot; he whispered.\n\n~Present~\nThe feline robot stretched almost lazily in his room, taking a well; in \nhis opinion, deserved catnap. Just as he was drifting off, his ear \ntwitched at the sound of yelling and rolled over, his paws coming up to \nclamp over his ears. That didn&#39;t help as it only trapped the sound and \nhe groaned before finally rolling off his bed and growling slightly to \nhimself. \n\n&quot;Can&#39;t a bot get some sleep around here?&quot; He streched again, before \npadding out of his room in beast mode. \n\nOOC: Would Cheetor still be his Transmetal 2 self, or Trans Organic?\n\nOMWOS\n\n\n\n"}}
