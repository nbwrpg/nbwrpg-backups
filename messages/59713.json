I&#39;m in 50 lists, over half of those are RPGs... \nso... makes \n&gt; it difficult for me to... check 100+ emails a day when I don&#39;t \nhave much time \n&gt; as it is. I prefer to have a life than just online. Thank you. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; My other issue... I&#39;ve mentioned this to Airly... about in the \nsubject \n&gt; heading.. putting the title of the &quot;scene&quot; then in (( ))  put the \ncharacter that is \n&gt; posting followed by an ATTN then the characters that are to read & \nrespond to \n&gt; a certain post.\n&gt; I&#39;ve learned this from a couple other RPGs in which has made \nRPGing MUCH \n&gt; easier... defered from wrong posting, blitz posted, etc. Keeping \nthe story at a \n&gt; steady enough pace & a VERY good storyline too. \n&gt; Maybe we can adopt this? Would be SOOOO much easier especially on \nsomeone who \n&gt; doesn&#39;t particularly want to read TONS of email that does not \npertain to them \n&gt; since reading something I really don&#39;t need to know can confuse. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Much appreciated, :: again bows a la Jack Sparrow:: \n&gt; Stac\n&gt; ~Maxima\n\n\n"}}
