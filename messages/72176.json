There was somehting ceremonial\n&gt;=\r\n and even crisp in the movements.\n&gt; \n&gt; ASTRA, noticing WHEELIE&#39;s hesitation=\r\n, &quot;Unus will answer that\n&gt; question.&quot; she said as she gestured for him to c=\r\nome, her movments also\n&gt; becoming a litle straighter and taller.\n&gt; \n&gt; On th=\r\ne otherside of the door was a large chamber with other figures\n&gt; moving abo=\r\nut, all of them looking much like ASTRA and FIREHORN. They\n&gt; were not quite=\r\n clones, but they were variations on the same theme.\n&gt; Similar colors, size=\r\n and presumably abilities although there were\n&gt; slight differences for thos=\r\ne who were observant enough to catch them.\n&gt; \n&gt; The room itself was semiorn=\r\nate with precious gems of different sorts\n&gt; lining the walls, strange and e=\r\nxotic metals taking up the rest of it.\n&gt; Pictures had been painted and plac=\r\ned in various places, and even\n&gt; ornate flowers were allowed to grow around=\r\n the room, the flowers\n&gt; carefully placed to give the room an exotic look.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The intrior of the room was quite large with pillars placed\n&gt; strategi=\r\naclly around the room, providing support for the stone ceiling\n&gt; of the roo=\r\nm. There were no widows visible in the chamber although\n&gt; there were doors =\r\nleading to other parts of the structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the center of the room was=\r\n a figure who looked much like ASTRA and\n&gt; FIREHORN as well as the others i=\r\nn the room but he looked to be a\n&gt; little larger and massive as he sat on t=\r\nhe throne that was positioned\n&gt; in the cetner of the room as well. He seeme=\r\nd to be listening to the\n&gt; report of several figures before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That=\r\n is Unus.&quot; ASTRA said quietly as she directed her gaze to the\n&gt; figure on t=\r\nhe throne.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nThere was a careful pause from WHEELIE as h=\r\ne nodded over at Astra and Firehorn, and then he spoke simply, &quot;Until the d=\r\nay we meet again, I hope that this is not the end.&quot;\n\nAt this point, recogni=\r\nzing the solemnity of the room, WHEELIE depowered his weapon and went to sh=\r\neathe it.  Even if this group would end being adversaries, he wuold not ins=\r\ntigate a conflict with them or endanger what they ahd built here, whatever =\r\nit was with things he did not recognize, beyond even what he had seen of th=\r\ne Quintessons and of Unicron in his own way.\n\nGiving them an example of a C=\r\nybertronian salute, not specific to any faction, Wheelie quietly went in ov=\r\ner to the central chamber.\n\n&lt;OLD - UNUS&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS looked away from those =\r\nwho were talking to him as he spotted\n&gt; WHEELIE and gestured for him to com=\r\ne foward. &quot;Come come.&quot; he said\n&gt; encouragingly. The few other individuals w=\r\nho were milling about the\n&gt; room stepping back so that Wheelie could ventur=\r\ne foward to the throne\n&gt; if he chose. They all turned to look at him as if =\r\nappraising him, as\n&gt; if they had not seen the one of his build and construc=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nOOC - Must..  Resist..  Urge..  To abuse fact o=\r\nnly thing that rhymes wtih Unus is Anus..\n\nWHEELIE entered ni, glancing abo=\r\nut the chamber, not quite reverently, but curiously, &quot;What are you?  Where =\r\ndid you come from, what do you do?&quot;  Seeing if eh could get any sort of ifn=\r\normation on what this mysterious base was for.\n\n\n"}}
