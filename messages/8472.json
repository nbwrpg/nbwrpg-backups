She didn&#39;t care \nanymore. She looked around the lab.  She saw the box sitting on the \ncounter.  It was the one that Scorponok had told her not to touch. \nShe was so mad and hurt by him she didn&#39;t care at all about \nanything.  She walked over to the box, picked it up and looked at \nit.  She felt a tear run down her face.  She raised the box up over \nher head and threw as hard as she could onto the floor.  It broke \ninto a million pieces.  When it broke, she fell to the floor in \nstasis lock, with her memory erased.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
