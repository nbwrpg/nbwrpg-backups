Me and Yan always used to \ntalk about how in 25 years NBW will still be here, we would all still \nbe together, but it would be so much more advanced. Wouldn&#39;t that be \ncool? The only way I&#39;m leaving is if I lose my internet connection \nfor a long time. Not going to happan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it would be cool if we all got together one day. It would \nbe sweet to actually meet and talk to everyone. A lot of us have been \ntogether here for a long time now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh and Dewy, dont use a Glock, use a Colt! Especially a 45cal.
