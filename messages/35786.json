The other\n&gt; half, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanical one, in a final fight over organic life and it&#39;s\n&gt; future on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cyberetron proved a failure for the organic bot.  In the battle\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raged against each other.  With a qucik snap of his wrist the\n&gt; organic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bot lashed his special energon whips across his arch-enemy&#39;s face,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blinding him instantly. He remembers how the bot crazed, firing\n&gt; al over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the place, and with a crazy shot it all went black for the\n&gt; protector of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organic life.  The shot had put his spark into stasis lock. What\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to his foe, his evil half, he did not know. Until not\n&gt; long ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Axis looked to Aerotaur. &quot;All right, he&#39;s yours.  I am here if\n&gt; you need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me&quot;  He then turned and noticed Windlord in some trouble.  He\n&gt; fired two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missiles at the traiter McGowan while Lokk and Seekker continued\n&gt; to fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 25 shots each at the foe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lynxiz ran out after Lynxiz and spotting Stranato decides it is\n&gt; time for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; payback.
