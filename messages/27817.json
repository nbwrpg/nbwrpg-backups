He nods.\n\n&quot;Yes, I would enjoy a chance at battle against Hell Beast,&quot; he says, \nwaiting for Zardus to reply to DarkFate.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus taps a few buttons, making the channel that he and Darkfate \nwere on secure.\n\n&quot;My scanners detect only two of his Predacons in your area,&quot; he says \nto Darkfate, &quot;I have a potential mutiny in my base, so I don&#39;t know \nif I can send troops.&quot;\n\nHe frowns, noticing something on the scanner reports of the CF. \nUnitron&#39;s signature was there, but Unitron was also in the base..\n\n&quot;I have to go for a few moments,&quot; he says to Darkfate, &quot;There&#39;s \nsomething I need to take care of.&quot;\n\nHe closes the channel and turns to FZ.\n\n&quot;Go to the CF and oversee that everything is going fine. There&#39;s \nsomething up.&quot;\n\nFZ nods, turning around and walking out of the bridge. He exits the \nIron Fist and blasts off, heading toward the CF at top speed.\n\nZardus turns back in his chair, remembering something. The Destrons! \nThey were allies of the Alliance as well..\n\n&quot;Zardus to Magmatron,&quot; he says into his comm, opening a channel to \nMagmatron, &quot;My troops are currently attacking Hell Beast&#39;s base. If \nyou could aid us there, or perhaps attack his troops at the \nCybertronian Fire, it would be greatly appreciated and repaid. I \nawait your answer.&quot;\n\nHe closes the channel, sending a transmission to Darkfate again. &quot;I&#39;m \nsending a bot to help you out. That&#39;s all I can muster at the moment \nthough.&quot;\n\nHe taps a few buttons, sending Bloodystrike an order.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike sighs, changing course half-way to the Alliance base and \nheading for the Black Fortress instead.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (There will be mass delays for any posting today from me, for two \nreasons.  \n&gt; My brother has a friend over and they plan on the computers a lot, \nand I&#39;m \n&gt; playing Smackdown! 2 quite a bit on the ol&#39; playstation)\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement/Shockwave/Reflector/Sun Crusher/Unicron/The Protectobots:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement was lying on the ground, but kept his blood red optics \nlooking at \n&gt; the sun as the solar technology in them absorbed great amounts of \nenergy, his \n&gt; overall power level back up to 65% again.  \n&gt; \n&gt; He stood, firing off a wide blast of optic energy, intercepting \nthree charges \n&gt; heading for Sun Crusher.  Twenty five blasts struck Vehement&#39;s \narmor, not \n&gt; penetrating it or even coming close to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ginormous robot stretched an arm with a sick smile.  His left \narm \n&gt; transformed into a wide cannon as a eight foot long broadsword \nappeared in \n&gt; his right hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising the cannon of an arm, he launching two energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missiles at Iron Raptor&#39;s abdomen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving the point of the broadsword to point at Condor, a fire ball \nerrupting \n&gt; from it at the enemy&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector felt a surge of power, that told him Unicron was \nsiphoning more \n&gt; power to him.  Getting up and ignoring the pain as twenty-three \nshots dug \n&gt; into his body, he raised an arm, launching two missile at IRIS from \nhis wrist \n&gt; cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher rolled to the left, the explosions from the charge \nsending him \n&gt; flipping through the air, slamming painfully to his legs, almost \ncausing him \n&gt; to crash to the ground.  &quot;That&#39;s it, heathens,&quot; he said, spitting \nmech-fluid \n&gt; into the burnt grass before him, &quot;you want to die painfully, be my \nguest.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that, his shaped twisted into the form of a tank, Sun Crusher \nthe hover \n&gt; tank bringing a long barrel to point at the CF, launching three \nexplosive \n&gt; shells from the bowels of the tank.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron, still disguised as Unitron, activated a comm. link to all \nAlliance \n&gt; members at the scene of the Cybertronian Fire.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All Alliance warriors, this is Unitron,&quot; his voice sounding \nexactly like \n&gt; Unitron&#39;s, his appearance the same as well, &quot;I received orders from \nZardus, \n&gt; leave everyone alone and focus solely on crippling the Cybertronian \nFire \n&gt; beyond repair.  Then make a full retreat.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave was flying at his top speed for atmospheric conditions in \nhis space \n&gt; fighter mode, arming all his weapons.  The cause would not fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot looked at two CR chambers, noticing First Aid and Blades \nwere still \n&gt; badly damaged.  He then looked over to Groove and Streetwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blades is closer to being repaired.  I will stay here and have him \ngo out to \n&gt; help you while you attack the enemies outside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove and Streetwise nodded, runinng as fast as they could for \ntheir nearest \n&gt; exit out of the ship that wasn&#39;t a large hole in the ship.\n\n\n"}}
