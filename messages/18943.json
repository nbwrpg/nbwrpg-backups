At the same time, he fired two fire balls \nforward at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\nHiss ducked under the missile, the explosion almost toppling him over.  He \nreturned fire with three fusion blasts at Stronghold.  &quot;WHY WON&#39;T YOU DIE?!&quot;\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired off 25 explosive rounds at Rizopas.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf took a few steps back, sidestepping, a dent in his abdomen armor \nfrom the big autoguns.  &quot;These fools anger me.&quot; he said quitely, firing off \nanother blade missile from his sword at the Mafia base.\n\n---\n\n&quot;I agree brother.  They do not know when to surrender or when to DIE.&quot; Flesh \nRipper yelled out, firing three blasts from his rifle at Blender.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw formed two orbs, both blew, both the size of two of his fists, and \none in each hand.  He threw both orbs, with the effects of grenades, at the \nMafia Base.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor cursed.  &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right, why don&#39;t we just attack the base, \nand IGNORE ALL THE SLAGGING ENEMIES SHOOTING AT US!&quot; he screamed, firing off \nthree bolts from his plasma rifle at Sharpedge, 15 rapid optic blasts at \nJetstorm.\n\n---\n\nSixshot, in a strafing run, fired two missiles at the Mafia base.  &quot;The \nshields are back up,&quot; he commented to himself as he gained altitude, &quot;great.&quot;\n\n---\n\nUnitron spun in the air, avoiding minimal autogun fire.  Loading his missile \nlaunchers, he pulled up, then dived straight down at the Mafia base.  He \nfired two missiles down, and then pulled up.\n\n---\n\nMinion slammed to the ground from autogun fire.\n\n---\n\nChaos cursed.  &quot;One cycle.  Excellent.&quot; he fired off 25 rapid optic blasts at \nSharpedge.\n\n"}}
