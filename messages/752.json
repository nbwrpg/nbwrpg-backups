She transformed to \nher robot mode and flew off after them. She thought this was a little risky, \nbut there was no way around it. She had better transform to beast mode as \nfast as she could without getting caught. The Maximals could see her. And \nthey knew her. They knew her ways of getting around.\n\nShe flew up beside Carnage and said, &quot;I have a plan of how I&#39;m going  to get \nin. Now, don&#39;t get mad at me and dont&#39; give me away. I&#39;m going to \nimpersonate Dinobot. I&#39;ll act as him until we are repaired.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
