All this OOC arguing reminded me that I have a message \nboard\n&gt; &gt; ready, made of pure and simple C++ (well, some C too, but I didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; write that part). Anyways, all I need now are some suggestions \nfor the\n&gt; &gt; coloring. THe colors I need are:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Post background color 1 & 2.\n&gt; &gt; Post text color 1 & 2.\n&gt; &gt; What I should cover the walls of my room (that&#39;s the most crucial\n&gt; &gt; one).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyways, the post and text colors are like the ones on EZBoard and\n&gt; &gt; stuff. They alternate with every post in the topics. I think \nthose are\n&gt; &gt; the only ones I need. As soon as I get some suggestions, I&#39;ll put \nup\n&gt; &gt; the message board, and then we can discuss Physics on that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PS. I just fixed my keyboard using nothing but a screwdriver and \nthe\n&gt; &gt; sink, so it might not be working well. If there are any typos, \nits the\n&gt; &gt; sink&#39;s fault.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Enough with the OOC arguing.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
