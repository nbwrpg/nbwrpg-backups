She\n&gt; &gt; &gt;turns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;toward Windlord and gently places her hands on either side of\n&gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;head.  &quot;It&#39;s easier to show you than tell you,&quot; she\n&gt;says.  &quot;Try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relax - I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;She reaches out with her mind, drawing Windlord&#39;s feelings for\n&gt;her\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the surface.  Empath&#39;s gratified to learn that her initial\n&gt; &gt; &gt;assessment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;was correct, but she&#39;s not done.  Briefly, she opens her own\n&gt;mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the Maximal, allowing him to see all she&#39;s seen - from her\n&gt;creation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;millions of years ago, through the Great War, to the pain of\n&gt;losing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Skywarp to Galvatron&#39;s selfish machinations.  She shows him the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reformatting, when she became a predacon trapped under\n&gt;Galvatron&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;control; finding the Soul Orb and accidentally freeing\n&gt;herself; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;finally, she shows the recent events that have drawn them to\n&gt;this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;moment - and the fact that her own emotions mirror his.\n&gt; &gt; http://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n�nete al mayor servicio mundial de correo electr�nico: \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
