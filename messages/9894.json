She looked and saw \nshe was in the CR chamber. She gave a sigh of relief. She thought she \nwas a goner for a while.  She looked down and noticed her left arm \nwas gone.  She touched the wire exposed stump where her arm used to \nbe.  She had seen Stingtra shoot off her own hand and rebuild another \none.  But KitKat had never lost a limb before and she found it \ndisturbing.  She relaxed in the chamber and let it do it&#39;s work.  \nWhen she got out, she would try to find a way to replace the arm that \nwas lost. At least she hoped she could replace it.\n\n\n"}}
