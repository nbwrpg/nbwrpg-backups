Though his lives he had fought cowards and every time one escaped him he only promised himself that they would be defeated next time. And so that promise was made again, but he would deal with FireBlade again when the time came, until then, he would concern himself with other targets.  However, just whom would feel his transmetal blades this time was not as easy a choice as some would think.  Though the nearest body would be the wisest choice, and the last strategy had worked so to use the same was a possibility. However, to depend on a single set of actions without exploring the capabilities of other was foolish.  Dinobot was wise enough not to make that mistake.\r\nAdvancing through the continuing battle, though a percentage of the enemy had fled, he scanned to acquire a new victim.  It was his long-range heat sensitive imaging, however, that determined just whom he was to go after.\r\nAbominus.\r\nHowever, there was a rather dominant problem as to what the target had proven to be.  A gestalt. So indeed, a possibility of victory against such a foe was next to nothing, though not a person ever discouraged causing such a problem such pain. In yet, Dinobot knew his abilities enough to know that he was more likely to end up on a journey back to the matrix before he could defeat Abominus, so another target was to be selected.
