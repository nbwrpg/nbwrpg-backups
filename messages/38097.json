I&#39;m not willing to risk\nmy life for some dead cause.&quot; he pleaded. Havotron stood up, and fired\nhis cannon at Slugslinger, the beam of energy ricochaing off of his\nshoulder, sending him to the ground in a heap of smoke. \n\n&quot;Any one else want to question our mission?&quot; Unitron asked. \n\nHook stood for a second pleading, &quot;Havotron, you could damage our ship\nif you fire agaahhhhhhhhh.&quot; Hook screamed in pain as he was met by the\nsame power to his chest, he fell over twitching.\n\nHavotron stood there, his cannon fuming. &quot;Soundwave, take Hook&#39;s place,\nNightmare, get Hook out of the way.&quot; he ordered. &quot;Anyone else want to\ntaste my power?&quot; At that most of the Decepticons cowered. Spinister\nwalked up quietly towards Havotron, catching him of guard. Havotron\nturned the cannon on Spinister, who camly pointed at the screen, showing\nthe Autobot shuttle. \n\n&quot;Yes, you have a point. The Autobots are the enemy. Continue on the\ncourse.&quot; he said, calming down, and sitting down. \n\nNightmare, walked up, and pulled Hook out of the way.\n\n"}}
