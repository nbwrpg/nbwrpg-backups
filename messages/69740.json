Kraftlos described it a bit in Message #69458, and of course T=\r\nuscon left on his mission to the black fortress from there, so you should b=\r\ne familiar with it already :) Just don&#39;t forget the huge two headed dragon =\r\nfloating above it. So far it has not attacked. \n\nSince this is Kraftlos&#39; sh=\r\now over there, you might want to get with him as well if you have any quest=\r\nions. I will help as I can :)\n\nThe Ark of course looks much like it did in =\r\nthe old 80&#39;s cartoon, except that you have Autobots and Decepticons laying =\r\naround inside it . . . much like the description I gave for Quickstride&#39;s b=\r\nenefit. Also there is a force field which Lord Elder or Kup can lower to le=\r\nt Tuscon in.\n\nI hope this is helpful?\n\nPreston\n\n\n"}}
