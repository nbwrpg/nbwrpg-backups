Well its a hologram \nbut \n&gt; I cant reveal who it is yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; And upon those words the room went dark again and then features \n&gt; reappeared, this time it looked like the room Blacknightmare was in \n&gt; first with the same pedestal that the orb came up off of. Slowly \n&gt; three other orbs flew all around Blacknightmare and scanned every \nbit \n&gt; of info about her and everything that has been done before they \n&gt; dissapeared into the pedestal. Slowly three chambers in the floor \n&gt; opened and then three holograms appeared over them, disturbingly \n&gt; lifelike. The first Hellpeon, the second Orchestra, the third \nshowing \n&gt; a much larger robot. The Hellpeon hologram walks up to \nBlacknightmare \n&gt; and stares down at her as it laughs evily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellpeon: &quot;Predacon trash, what makes you think your so smart? You \n&gt; will be destroyed by the Bamphomet and then devoured. I should not \n&gt; even waste my time with you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Holo-Hellpeon walks on back over to where he appeared and stands \n&gt; there. Next, the Orchestra Hologram walked over to Blacknightmare \nand \n&gt; placed a hand on her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Holo-Orchestra: &quot;Come my love, The Alliance has been destroyed \n&gt; completely let us go and salvage all their technology and use it to \n&gt; defeat our enemies. Then we can live together in peace..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Orchestra Hologram then stepped away back to his place. Finally \n&gt; the third unknown Hologram steps up to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; \n&gt; ????: &quot;Come with me child and together we shall take over the \n&gt; Universe! All shall fall before my will for I am the god of all \n&gt; Infecticons. IF you defy me then death shall be your fate.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The third being then walks back over to where it appeared over and \n&gt; Misfire floated over to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misfire: &quot;You must choose one of those three selections and then \n&gt; descend into the chamber beneath the one you choose. Once you have \n&gt; selected your choice you will go to the next level. Where you go \nand \n&gt; what happens to you depends on your choice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With that said Misfire descneds into the pedestal over the ground \nand \n&gt; then dissapears with it as it descends.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The femme said &quot;The Bamphomet&quot;\n\n\n"}}
