He\n&gt;=\r\n helped with its repairs, but there is no telling how long he was here\n&gt; be=\r\nfore we got here.&quot; He looked at DINOBOT, &quot;He might even have a few\n&gt; other =\r\nthings we haven&#39;t found yet.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nThere was a pause from D=\r\nINOBOT.  What would the Megatron of old do in such a circumstance?\n\nMemory =\r\nFile Delta Three Seven Beta Four Gamma:\n\nAssault upon the Ark, Quickstrike =\r\nis sent in at point, and detonates a Maximal explosives cache and has a gia=\r\nnt rock fall on him, crushing him to stasis lock.\n\nMegatron crowing, &quot;When =\r\nlooking for booby traps, always send the boob in first.&quot;\n\nThe suggested act=\r\nion came to DINOBOT&#39;s processor instantly.  &quot;We should take Waspinator.&quot;\n\n\n=\r\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And BLACKARACHNIA was right, CRYOTEK was as sneaky and as wic=\r\nked as\n&gt; they came. It was he that fostered the great MEGATRON and taught h=\r\nim\n&gt; much of what he knew,  the MEGATRON that had stolen the golden disk\n&gt; =\r\nand fled to old Earth with it, the old MEGATRON who now existed, at\n&gt; least=\r\n in part, inside the form of HYDRAS.\n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nAnd so BLACKAR=\r\nACHNIA knew that CRYOTEK wasn&#39;t here out of the goodness of his fuel pump a=\r\ns far as evil criminal overlords went.  He was here for either of two thing=\r\ns, or both.\n\nHE was either here for revenge, or to turn events on Earth to =\r\nhis own favor.  Probably both, despite what they said abuot mixing business=\r\n and pleasure.\n\nThe third possibility disspelled itself as rapidly as her p=\r\nrocessor offered it up, that whatever he had seen in the future with HYDRAS=\r\n chagning things was so terrifying he had come to undo it was removed as fa=\r\nst as her processor offered it as she deleted that analytical subroutine fo=\r\nr wasting data time.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTULUS stepped foward looking =\r\nat HYDRAS a smile on his face.\n&gt; &quot;There are no traps.&quot; He said hoping to re=\r\nassure, but as everyone\n&gt; know, TARANTULUS was not the most trustworthy of =\r\nsoldiers, usually\n&gt; having his own agenda on things.\n\n&lt;DINOBOT&gt;\n\nDINOBOT me=\r\nrely sneered over at Tarantalus, &quot;Of course.  And next you will have prime =\r\nreal estate right under Iacon for which you can sell me at a steal.  Do not=\r\n try my time wtih idiocy, Spider.  I might decide to torture you just for o=\r\nld time&#39;s sake regardless of whether you tell the truth.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nKY SHADOW looked at DINOBOT a small smile on his face. &quot;Different\n&gt; ship, M=\r\negatron has become Hydras, but the same forces seems to be at\n&gt; play.&quot;\n\n&lt;NE=\r\nW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nDINOBOT merely nodded, &quot;I know.  But still, spark bindings, e=\r\nspecially of those of such power and magesty, never go so smoothly.  I am s=\r\nure he will surprise us.&quot;\n\n&lt;OLD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK nodded to HYDRAS, &quot;=\r\nPerhaps we should adjourn back to your\n&gt; meeting room?&quot; He said as he held =\r\nout a genteel hand to BLACHARACHNIA,\n&gt; his clawed hand looking clean and ma=\r\nnicured as he opened his fingers\n&gt; much like a gentlemech might before an e=\r\nsteemed lady. &quot;Will you do me\n&gt; the honor of walking with me?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=\r\nTher was a sultry smile from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;WHy of course, my Leige.&quot;  Giv=\r\ning a low saunter and a blatant &#39;wink&#39; to him, while opening a back channel=\r\n quadruple encrypted communications channel to Tarantalus, turning her form=\r\n to a living microphone for him to hear what HYDRAS and CRYOTEK were about =\r\nto discuss.\n\n\n"}}
