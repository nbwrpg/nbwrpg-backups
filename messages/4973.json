Taking a step back, \nhe fired three optic blasts at Oinker&#39;s pelvis, a rocket at Rhinox&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nSixshot awoke, the continous attacks of the petty peace loving Maximals \nattacking a robot that was unconsciouss.  Taking out his rifle as his chest \ngot cut up, he shoved his laser rifle 1 inch from Zergling&#39;s sternum, firing \noff two blasts at near point blank range.\n\n---\n\nUnitron raised his rifles, firing four laser bolts from each, four heading \nfor Oinker, the other four for Sniper.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor raised his plasma rifle, firing a rocket from his launcher off at \nSniper&#39;s left side, firing two plasma bolts.  One of the bolts missed, the \nother blew off DeathStorm&#39;s head off of Scattershot&#39;s.\n\n"}}
