She had looked over at\n&gt; the strange horse when it had transformed and studied it&#39;s structure,\nsimply\n&gt; normal and nothing more. BrightBlade was disappointed, she had though that\n&gt; if anything was to come out of that pod it was to be some sort of strong\n&gt; bot, not some horse that new nothing other then to flit it&#39;s hair about!\n&gt; She looked at Gangon, his jaw dropped at the bot&#39;s beauty, why was it men\n&gt; always fell for something that knew how to strut about? The question\n&gt; confused her but at least this new bot could serve Hell Beast, just as she\n&gt; and Gangon had been.\n&gt; BrightBlade transformed into her robot mode and then walked around the new\n&gt; bot, judging it even closer. She then stopped in front of it and crossed\nher\n&gt; arms, not much to her taste but she could tell without a doubt that Gangon\n&gt; liked it.\n&gt; She snapper her head towards him with a sharp snarl.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Close that yap of your&#39;s, you arachnid bafoon!You&#39;re making a mockery of\n&gt; yourself!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then looked back at the new bot, her optics narrowing to mear\nslits.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not much power in THIS thing but as long as it&#39;s loyal to My Lord Hell\n&gt; Beast it may be usefull.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; CLICK HERE AND START SAVING ON LONG DISTANCE BILLS TODAY!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4125/10/_/_/_/959991011/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
