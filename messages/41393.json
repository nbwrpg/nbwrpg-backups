This is just as well, as the Decepticon war machine\nwouldnt have a clue as to what pressure means. He continues to look\naround, but not with curiosity, for he is not intelligent enough for\nsuch an emotion. He is simply looking for anything that could be\nconsidered hostile, as his massive frame finally reaches the ocean\nfloor. He takes one plodding step forwards, then another, causing the\nocean floor to first rumble, then on one step to crack, as he moves\ntowards the signal his computers provide him with.\n\nMany of the aquatic life down here has never seen anything like it, a\ncreature causing such a great disturbance, as things scramble out of\nAbominus&#39; way. It dosent matter however, as Abominus dosent notice it,\nthere is no spark in his eyes to show he knows what is happening around\nhim, he just notices one fish, that isnt leaving. Abominus stops moving,\nand begins to speak. &quot;Grrrrrrrr.......what......do?&quot; he asks.\n\n"}}
