I had to go \r\n&gt;to this awards banquet for day school and changed my Internet provider. The \r\n&gt;reason none of my characters have Bios is because for a while me and friend \r\n&gt;have be reading books on animation and studying it in my art class. So I \r\n&gt;going to Try ((Try Being the key word)) to animate a 3 minute short for my \r\n&gt;bios one for each characters. But to see if this works the way I want I&#39;m \r\n&gt;going to try to do a general music video for the Neo Beast Wars. This is \r\n&gt;long time taking process which means with day school, night school, work, \r\n&gt;and mischief, the two of us will be working on this in our spare time. But \r\n&gt;before I start I want to ask permission to animate and draw your characters \r\n&gt;for the general Music Video. The characters that get picked we will be \r\n&gt;listed and we are picking by the Bios you posted on the Web site if your bio \r\n&gt;reads well enough to draw you then your character may get picked. If you \r\n&gt;don&#39;t want to be drawn say so and you will not be picked. Characters that \r\n&gt;are drawn will be drawn in a drawn by Gene in Transformers G1 style or with \r\n&gt;strong anime edge by me. Before I start if I make this and it is decent will \r\n&gt;you add it to the page Yan?))\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;::The WildCats::\r\n&gt;All of the Wild C.A.T.S enter stealth mode and fall back to Cats Layer.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\r\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!

And they are:\r\n\r\nMaximal Blossom\r\ngender:female\r\nalternate form:pink and white car \r\nBackround:She and Dinobot have known each other since they were kids and in the process fallen in love with other. They now have a son name Buddy.She&#39;s also good friends with Rinox,and Optimus. \r\n\r\nMaximal Butterfreak\r\ngender:female\r\nbeast form:butterfly\r\nBackround:Dinobots &#39;sister&#39;. When Butterfreak was still a protoform her original spark faded &#39;cause of a mis-fired blast. Dinobot was the only one on the scene,and so he willing gave half his spark to her. So the two are in a way brother and sister because of the spark they now share.   \r\n\r\nMaximal Buddy \r\ngender:male\r\nAlternate form(s):grey and white car and helicopter\r\nbackround:the off spring of Blossom and Dinobot. Buddy wanted a bat beast form but his father disagreed saying it would be too dagerous. Born during the beast wars (first season near the end) Buddy wanted at first to grow up like any other normal kid but was stuck where he was. After the beast wars had ended Buddy got the chance to know Cybertron,unlike earth which he calls home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
