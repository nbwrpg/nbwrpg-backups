Megatron\n&gt; floated for a second, looking the area over, then\n&gt; turned his head\n&gt; towards Prowl, all emotion gone from Megatron&#39;s\n&gt; face. His lips moved in\n&gt; rythmic unison, giving the simple message.\n&gt; &quot;Decepticons are under my\n&gt; protection, Prowl, I sentence you to oblivion for\n&gt; destroying a superior\n&gt; being.&quot; His eyes lit up in a demonic red fury, as he\n&gt; coldly and\n&gt; collectivly held up his fusion cannon. A blast\n&gt; errupted from it, heading\n&gt; towards Prowl, as it pushed Megatron backwards. He\n&gt; then whirled, and\n&gt; fired several times towards the Maximal city,\n&gt; raining destruction upon\n&gt; them, for the loss of what he hoped to be his\n&gt; bodyguard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave however intercepted Switchblade&#39;s\n&gt; transmission, and recorded\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
