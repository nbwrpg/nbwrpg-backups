That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; depend on the strength of the opponent, so it&#39;s legal. But twisting\nsomeone&#39;s\n&gt; arms would depend on the other bot&#39;s strengh, so you&#39;d need to wait for\nhim\n&gt; to respond.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Perndabot/Reptilica/Bloodystrike::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus spins around, looking at Cyber Claw. He looks from her to\nOblitertron\n&gt; and the conflict on the ground, an annoyed look on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wait,&quot; he says to Cyber Claw and proceeds to fly down toward the\nconflict,\n&gt; his gun ready.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright,&quot; he says to the bots near the Ark, &quot;Maximals, lower your\nweapons.\n&gt; Oblitertron, stand down. The next bot to fire a shot dies.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus scans the bots in front of him, gun ready just in case.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot walks up near Zardus, his gun also ready. The huge bot looks\n&gt; threateningly at the maximals, ready to open fire.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica and Bloodystrike return to the alliance base, dropping off the\n&gt; energon they had mined.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I NEVER want to see another energon cube in my life!!&quot; Bloodystrike yells\n&gt; out, throwing a box against the wall, &quot;And don&#39;t say anything!&quot; he snaps\nat\n&gt; Reptilica.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reptilica chuckles, walking off toward the bridge, Bloodystrike following\n&gt; him. Once there, he sees the conflict near the Ark on the scanners.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey, Bloodystrike, want to come with me and check this out?&quot; he asks his\n&gt; partner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bloodystrike nods. &quot;Might as well.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The two bots exit the base, setting off toward the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Visit Firetalk.com - click below.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5479/10/_/_/_/961542554/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
