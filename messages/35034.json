The shiny bright red car transforms, folding up into \na standing position. He was closely followed by a interesting looking \njet cruising on the ground, who also transformed, and landed beside \nhim. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Lightspeed, looks like we&#39;ll be partners on this \nvoyage,&quot; the car said, holding out his hand friendly. The jet on the \nother hand looked nervous.\n\n\n"}}
