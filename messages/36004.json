He noticed the second shot but \ndidn&#39;t have\n&gt; time to move as it collided with him sending him rolling back from \nthe\n&gt; impact. He reached up to feal his shoulder quickly learning that a \ngaping\n&gt; hole was now where his plating had been. He tried to move his arm, \npain\n&gt; shooting through every servo in his body. His hand opened dropping \nhis disk\n&gt; launcher to the ground. He opened a link to the others, &quot;The preys \nbiting\n&gt; back.&quot; He shouts trying to hold back his pain. &quot;Do we really need \nthe\n&gt; supplies this badly?&quot; The Cybrats had normally taken whatever they \nneeded\n&gt; but now what Dogged needed was a medic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogged fealt a mysterious wave of virtigo come over him. He thought \nthat the\n&gt; injuries were causing his mental state. He glanced in the direction \nof\n&gt; Repugnus and quickly realized that it was the Monsterbot who was \ncausing his\n&gt; problems. He tried to recover his launcher when pain shit through \nhis\n&gt; injured arm. The smallest of the Cybrats was nothing more than a \nuseless\n&gt; target. In his condition ther was no way he&#39;d be of any use to his \nteam.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 4:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just a reminder: this is all taking place in an underground \ntunnel.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The bot ducks quickly, a laser passing overhead. He straightens \nand slams\n&gt; his fist into the piece of metal heading for him, knocking it aside.\n&gt; Reaching behind him, he takes out a very large, mean-looking rifle, \naiming\n&gt; it at Dogged. He pulls the trigger once, nearly stumbling back from \nthe\n&gt; recoil. The shot misses, sailing past Dogged and smashing into the \nroof of\n&gt; the tunnel. A large explosion caves that section in, and the bot \nfires\n&gt; again, this time right on target, the explosive round heading for \nDogged\n&gt; very quickly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dogged  . transforms to four treaded\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speeding through the flames, the heat warping the paint and \nsinging the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metal beneath. he remained focused on the bum. The two weakest \nbots were\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; origional targets so he remained fixxed on scrapping them first.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arty noticed that Slags attention was turned away from him. he \nraised\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right arm and fired a sidewinder from the winglike attachment \nmounted at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s side. his left hand found his mini launcher. he drew it \nfrom his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; holster and fired an impact grenade toward Crossroads. His \nequilibreum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; caused dizzyness and he stumbled backwards his weight carrying \nhim\n&gt; towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pacifix.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Switchblades optics began to blurr as Repugnus&#39;s waves took \nthier\n&gt; effect. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to adjust his optics to compensate but it was no use. he \nflew\n&gt; backward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly until he could feal the building behind him. he dug his \nfeet into\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; side hopeing that the effect would wear off shortly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@n...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 9:54 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Repugnus/Slag/JetV::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Repugnus continues running at Switchblade while emitting \ncolor waves\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disrupt the bots optic sensors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Slag::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Slag spits another wave of fire towards Dogged.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JetV arrives at the battle scene some bit away.
