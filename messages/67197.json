Quickly they descend to the surface of the \nmoon like some=\r\n dark plague upon an unsuspecting victim. Many seem to \ndisappear beneath t=\r\nhe surface, while others scour the surface, moving \nto and fro over the app=\r\narently dead surface of earth&#39;s moon. \n\nTwo of the shadows break away from =\r\nthe rest, shift into a humanoid \nform and land. &quot;Is this the correct place?=\r\n If he was here we would \nhave found him by now!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Said the other fi=\r\ngure, his figure is sleek and agile, purple \nframed with silver highlights.=\r\n &quot;Have patience. No doubt he has just \nhidden his signature. We know where =\r\nto look though.&quot;\n\nThe first figure nodded as the two continued on, his form=\r\n looking \nwinged as the shadows played over his blue and white form. \n\nBefo=\r\nre long they came to a large set of doors, set into a \nmountainside. Doors =\r\nconstructed in such a way that they would be \nhidden if they were not stand=\r\ning open as if beckoning the duo inside. \n\nWithout a glance the larger purp=\r\nle figure stepped inside, even as the \nwinged one hesitated. &quot;Come.&quot; Said t=\r\nhe first in calm confident \ntones. &quot;He is here. I can feel him.&quot; The other =\r\nfollowed, looks of \nboth fear and confidence fighting a war on his metallic=\r\nally bearded \nface. \n\nGreat vaulting caverns greeted the two as they walked=\r\n; ancient stone, \nunworked and yet beautiful in its own way. &quot;He is here, V=\r\norpal is \nhere.&quot; The winged figure&#39;s voice is confidence and almost aggress=\r\nion \nas he spoke.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; Said the other figure, his steps measured and con=\r\nfident. &quot;As \nUnicron had already told us.&quot; Quickly they emerged into a larg=\r\ne \nchamber filled with dim lights and probing shadows. Moving to the \ncente=\r\nr of the chamber, to the front of what could only be a throne \nthey stood f=\r\ninally before the presence of Vorpal, Leader of the \nminions in this area. =\r\n\n\n&quot;My lord.&quot; Said the larger purple armored figure as he knelt. &quot;I am \nCycl=\r\nonus.&quot; He gestured behind him as the other also followed \nsuit, &quot;and this i=\r\ns Scourge. We have been sent by Mighty Unicron to \naid you in the eradicati=\r\non of all his enemies.&quot; Cyclonus bowed his \nhead. &quot;What are your orders?&quot;\n\n=\r\nOOC: Please note that this is NOT the Cyclonus and Scourge that \npreviously=\r\n appeared on this website. I note that they have been \nabsent since about 2=\r\n001. So you can think of these as clones or total \nreformats of them from U=\r\nnicron. But since they have been gone for so \nlong, and they are characters=\r\n that belong to Hasbro or who ever, I \nhope no one objects to their use. Th=\r\ney will not have the memories of \nthose that already appeared. I can rename=\r\n them if it makes it easier \nfor the group as a whole.\n\n\n\n"}}
