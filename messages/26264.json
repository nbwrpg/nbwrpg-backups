But she knew that she wasn&#39;t as good as they said she was.\nShe had been away while her beast mode had taken controle, and she had only \nreturned while the battle had happened. A real leader wouldn&#39;t do that.\nBut people learned from the past and she had.*\n\n&quot; Well, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m as great as all that but your offer sounds \npretty good to me. The more skilled warriors we have the better.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor held out a hand.*\n\n&quot; I accept.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
