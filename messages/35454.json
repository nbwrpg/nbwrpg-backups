He sensed that somehow it\nwasn&#39;t real. Standing before him were five recruits fresh off the assembly\nline. He somehow knew that the group was learning the fine art of Predacon\nwarfare. A female stepped forward fireing a series of bolts from her rifle.\nThe opposition collapsed, parylized with the effects of a disruptor blast.\n\nNext a creature of raw power transformed and bullrushed the door. The\nentrance exploded from the force of the impact destroying two more bots\ninside.\n\nA strong Sturdy bot helped the fourth bot set up some sort of shield\ngenerator to keep reinforcements from interfering with the excercise.\n\nAbove thier heads the fifth member of the unit used a sniper rifle to handle\nany opposition left. The excersize took less than 10 minutes earth time but\nit wasn&#39;t fast enough for his taste. If he wanted the excersize done right\nhe&#39;d demand strict obedience. Somehow he knew that no matter what happened\nto them they were his.\n\n\n"}}
