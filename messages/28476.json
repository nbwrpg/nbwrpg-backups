The orb heading for him struck the shields of the Element and \ndidn&#39;t go further. He watched Cinder roll out of the way of the missile, the \nexplosion throwing her around a bit. Mantle sighed. The Maximal he had been \ntrying to save was captured by the giant robot on the battlefield. He wasn&#39;t \ngoing to let that happen. Mantle formed a temporary bond when dealing \ndirectly with a bot like did with Firearm, and he wasn&#39;t going to sit back \nwhile Firearm was taken. He rose back into the air, which was strange \nbecause he had no visible way to fly, and emerged from behind the shields of \nthe Element.\n\n&quot;Eletors, lets combine and get that Maximal back!&quot; He yelled to his brothers \nand sisters. They all stopped in their tracks and ran back to him, silently \njumping into the air. He could feel that they were all excited about this, \nand so was he, but he was more mature than his team and could take the news \nof making Element without too much excitement. He muttered a command and \nbegan to feel the transformation of his body. In several seconds he was \ntransformed into the torso and head of Element. The other eletors also \ntransformed into body parts, joining up with him. Cinder and Aqua formed the \nlegs, and Mist and Rocky formed the arms. Element stood almost 50 feet tall. \nHe growled loudly, looking at Menasor. Element&#39;s coloring consisted of \neverything from, light blue to brown, the color of his bodyparts depending \non who formed them.\n\n&quot;Unhand that Maximal!&quot; Element exlaimed and took off at a run toward \nMenasor. The earth shook as his feet touched it, and imprints were left \nwhere he stepped. The minds of Mantle, Mist, Rocky, Aqua, and Cinder were \nmerged into one. Element was very intellegent, and just as deadly. He jumped \ninto the air as he ran, and two large wings, like those of a plane, emerged \nfrom his back. Powerful engines roared to life on the back of each wing, \nsending him flying at Menasor. Four missile launchers, two on each wing, \neach launched two missiles at the other gestalt. Element was going to get \nFirearm back, even if he had to kill Menasor to do it.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
