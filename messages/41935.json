Inside the bots mind raced images, once \nagain of his ancient past and the everlasting battle between good \nand evil.  The face of good, his own, and the face of evil, the face \nthat touched every last fear receptor in his cerebul circuts, much \nlike his own.  This evil face, had once almost killed Grounded, and \nvise versa.   The images in his mind continued.  Of battles, and \nworst of all, the carbon life forms that were destroyed, by the \nrecklessness of Grounded himself.\n\n"}}
