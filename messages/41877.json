The Rock has been shoved down my throat and out my ass. It \nhurts to have to listen to him. RVD and Stone Cold are super talented, and \nChris Kanyon and DDP are so incredible that you&#39;ll go blind if you try to \nwatch a match featuring that numb and dumb Matt Hardy. I don&#39;t rank wrestlers \non their mic skills. No offense, Unitron, please don&#39;t take this personally, \nbut are you a mark? I have friends who are marks... &gt;&gt;\n\n(The Rock hasn&#39;t been crammed.  He&#39;s earned all his dues.  Hell, he could&#39;ve \nmade millions playing as a pro football player if it weren&#39;t for an injury.  \nA guy that can go from being a pro football player to the greatest wrestler \nin history is a man that deserves respect and recognition.  No WCW has ever \ndone that, and never will.\n\nChris Kanyon and DDP? Heh, what a bunch of losers.  &quot;It&#39;s me, it&#39;s me, it&#39;s \nDDP.&quot; Gee, that sounds a LOT like the Road Dogg ::cough:: rip off ::cough::  \nAnd hey, dude, I said the only good talent in the Alliance comes from the \nformer WWF stars in it.  I&#39;m pretty sure Stone Cold was in the WWF.  Stone \nCold has switched sides so many times it&#39;s just plain stupid.  Matt Hardy has \nmore skill than DDP and Kanyon combined.  \n\nThe WCW and ECW crumbled.  The WWF stood tall and proud and kicking butt.  \nWhy?  WWF owns WCW and ECW.  The WWF is the master of ownage.  I don&#39;t know \nwhat a mark is, though in assassination terms it means I&#39;m someone&#39;s target.  \nSo, hopefully, no I am not a mark.  I find today&#39;s slang idiotic and simply \ncontinues to devastate the English language.  But what I find interesting is \nyou didn&#39;t respond to over two-thirds of what I said.)\n\n\n"}}
