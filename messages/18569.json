But he never did.\nIron Raptor applied pressure to the tube until she felt it slidinw doen his \nthroat and towards his stomach, finally stopping when she felt resistance at \nthe end of the tube.\nIt had reached the destination.\nShe then leaned back and looked at the tube as it protruded from Dinobots \nmouth, gesturing to Prowl that he could let go.\nHowever, she wasn&#39;t done yet.\nIron Raptor stalked over to a small cupboard in the room and flung the doors \nopen, reaching in the shuffling about until she came out with a piece of \ncloth.\nShe easily tore the piece in two and walked back to the injured bot, simply \nplacing the cloth over his teeth so that the tube would remain intact.\nThen, leaning over to the energon bag she flicked a switch and the liquid \nbegan to flow slowly down the tube and into Dinobots stomach.\nThere, that task was done.\nNow...to the air.\n\nIron Raptor walked over and took the air resporator, which would breath for \nthe warrior once it was instulled, and a tube.\nShe quickly scanned the interior of his neck and discovered the internal \nsystem which controled his breathing.\nIron Raptor quickly brought the resporator over to the metal table and \nhooked up the tube, knowing that they now had less then 2 min to get \neverything working right again.\nWith no time to spare she simply stood up and retracted the claws from her \nfingertips, simply slashing across Dinobot&#39;s neck and thrusting the tube \ninto the opening, doing the same to it as she did the stomach tube. Pushing \nit into the lungs until she felt resistance, then simply switching the \nresporator on.\nNow, that was all that she could do for him.\nIron Raptor sighed and placed a cloth over the fresh wound in Dinobots neck \nto soak up any fluid that might escape.\nShe then leaned back and looked over at prowl, her arms and torso completely \ncovered in mech-fluid.*\n\n&quot; Now...we wait.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
