By doing so you\n&gt; &gt; overstepped my command and agreed to=\r\n something I would never agree to.\n&gt; &gt; Needless to say when all is said and=\r\n done, I expect you to answer for your\n&gt; &gt; actions and I demand that your u=\r\nnspeakable bargain be renounced immediately,\n&gt; &gt; as well as your chain of c=\r\nommand. I will allow you to remain among us but\n&gt; &gt; keep in mind you will b=\r\ne under my command. The same will hold true for\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus upon his return=\r\n. And now, to take your place, I hereby request that\n&gt; &gt; Big Convoy assists=\r\n me in leadership of our troop.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns to Big Convoy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; =\r\nI would be honored if you would take your place beside me as leader of my\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Maximal clan.

In fact there were three. One led back in the\n&gt; direction he came, ano=\r\nther led further down into darkness and the\n&gt; third led upwards, and that w=\r\nas the direction he thought he heard LEO\n&gt; PRIME&#39;s voice, along with severa=\r\nl other voices.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVOY glanced at TUSCON at his offer, &quot;You mean y=\r\nou believe this\n&gt; Predacon about Leo Prime?&quot; CONVOY had a surprised look on=\r\n his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was an amused glance over at the roar=\r\ning TUSCON, and DRILL BIt\n&gt; &gt; murmured, &quot;Really, Maximal, you should have b=\r\neen a Predacon. You acn&#39;t go\n&gt; &gt; half a breem without screaming at someone.=\r\n.&quot; Audible only to those paying\n&gt; &gt; -close- attention given all of the yell=\r\ning going around at hte moment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Listening as the MAXIMALS came down=\r\n the hole, DRILL BIT, not yet aware of\n&gt; &gt; the slamming trap up top, whispe=\r\nred, &quot;Right ons chedule.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then as the MAXIMALS and possibly teh PRE=\r\nDACONS were coming on down,\n&gt; &gt; went to transform and then dig away undergr=\r\nound to lie in wait anew.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson growls back at Drill =\r\nBit with a snarl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Just focus on what you&#39;re doing and mind your o=\r\nwn business. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He tries very hard to keep his composure but it was =\r\ndifficult to resist the\n&gt; &gt; temptation of snapping Drill bit to smitherines=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; As this was going on BIG CONVOY was looking at the upward path as he=\r\n\n&gt; could see others approaching.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was LEO PRIME followed closely by =\r\na mech that TUSCON probrably only\n&gt; knew by reputation . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; He was rumored to have been amongst the PREDACON faction although it\n&gt;=\r\n could never quite be proven. There were some who even speculated he\n&gt; ran =\r\nit until MEGATRON took over, but it could never be proven. Even\n&gt; with the =\r\ntheft of the golden disk, which cast many allegations his way\n&gt; nothing eve=\r\nr stuck to him. However he disappeared soon after.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind CRYOTEK was =\r\nother MAXIMALS, TORCA plus his FUZORS, minus\n&gt; SILVBERBOLT who was still at=\r\n the Ark. WINGCALBER and SANTON were also\n&gt; in accompanyment, as well as RA=\r\nT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Behind the MAXIMALS curiously bringing up the =\r\nrear was SKYSHADOW and\n&gt; his FUZOR team along with DINOBOT and WASPINATOR.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHADOW seemed to be wearing a pointedly irritated look on his face\n=\r\n&gt; as he walked. Occasionally he looked behind him at the locked door\n&gt; that=\r\n TUSCON could not see.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO came up to BIG CONVOY and shook hands. &quot;Wel=\r\ncome.&quot; LEO said. &quot;It\n&gt; has been some time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BIG CONVOY nodded, &quot;It has=\r\n indeed.&quot; He said.

He had to gain full co=\r\nmmand of his division&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and it meant having to tell Leo in a civil m=\r\nanner that it was best for him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to stand down and return full leade=\r\nrship to Tucson Prime, who would never in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his life, submit to such=\r\n an unspeakable demand of trading a life in exchange&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for cooperati=\r\non.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So he sends a message to Leo hoping it would reach hi=\r\nm.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Leo, it has come to my attention that you have made an=\r\n unspeakable demand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with the Predicons in order to establish their=\r\n cooperation.  By doing so you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; overstepped my command and agreed t=\r\no something I would never agree to.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Needless to say when all is sa=\r\nid and done, I expect you to answer for your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; actions and I demand =\r\nthat your unspeakable bargain be renounced immediately,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as well as=\r\n your chain of command.  I will allow you to remain among us but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; k=\r\neep in mind you will be under my command.  The same will hold true for&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Rodimus upon his return.  And now, to take your place, I hereby reques=\r\nt that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Big Convoy assists me in leadership of our troop.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Big Convoy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I would be honored if=\r\n you would take your place beside me as leader of my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maximal clan.=\r\n  My command is your command and you have proven to be more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than t=\r\nrustworthy.  Everyone, you are all welcome among my clan.  Our home is&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; your home now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON&#39;s attempt to send=\r\n a radio wave signal is met with static as the&lt;br&gt;\ntransmission was complet=\r\nely lost.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever TUSCON&#39;s hearing is able to pick up the sound of=\r\n many&lt;br&gt;\nindividuals approaching from one of the paths leading away from w=\r\nhere&lt;br&gt;\nhe was standing. In fact there were three. One led back in the&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\ndirection he came, another led further down into darkness and the&lt;br&gt;\nthir=\r\nd led upwards, and that was the direction he thought he heard LEO&lt;br&gt;\nPRIME=\r\n&#39;s voice, along with several other voices.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBIG CONVOY glanced at T=\r\nUSCON at his offer, &quot;You mean you believe this&lt;br&gt;\nPredacon about Leo Prime=\r\n?&quot; CONVOY had a surprised look on his face.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There was an amused glance over at the roaring TUSCON, and DRI=\r\nLL BIt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; murmured, &quot;Really, Maximal, you should have been a Predacon=\r\n. You acn&#39;t go&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; half a breem without screaming at someone..&quot; Audibl=\r\ne only to those paying&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -close- attention given all of the yelling =\r\ngoing around at hte moment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Listening as the MAXIMALS cam=\r\ne down the hole, DRILL BIT, not yet aware of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the slamming trap up =\r\ntop, whispered, &quot;Right ons chedule.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then as the MAXIMALS=\r\n and possibly teh PREDACONS were coming on down,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; went to transform=\r\n and then dig away underground to lie in wait anew.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson growls back at Drill Bit with a snarl.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Just focus on what you&#39;re doing and mind your own business. &quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He tries very hard to keep his composure but it was diffic=\r\nult to resist the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; temptation of snapping Drill bit to smitherines.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs this was going on BIG CONVOY was looking at the upward path as=\r\n he&lt;br&gt;\ncould see others approaching.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt was LEO PRIME followed cl=\r\nosely by a mech that TUSCON probrably only&lt;br&gt;\nknew by reputation . . .&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nCRYOTEK.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe was rumored to have been amongst the PREDACON fa=\r\nction although it&lt;br&gt;\ncould never quite be proven. There were some who even=\r\n speculated he&lt;br&gt;\nran it until MEGATRON took over, but it could never be p=\r\nroven. Even&lt;br&gt;\nwith the theft of the golden disk, which cast many allegati=\r\nons his way&lt;br&gt;\nnothing ever stuck to him. However he disappeared soon afte=\r\nr.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBehind CRYOTEK was other MAXIMALS, TORCA plus his FUZORS, minus=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nSILVBERBOLT who was still at the Ark. WINGCALBER and SANTON were also&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nin accompanyment, as well as RAT TRAP and QUICKSTRIDE.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBehind =\r\nthe MAXIMALS curiously bringing up the rear was SKYSHADOW and&lt;br&gt;\nhis FUZOR=\r\n team along with DINOBOT and WASPINATOR.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSKYSHADOW seemed to be we=\r\naring a pointedly irritated look on his face&lt;br&gt;\nas he walked. Occasionally=\r\n he looked behind him at the locked door&lt;br&gt;\nthat TUSCON could not see.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO came up to BIG CONVOY and shook hands. &quot;Welcome.&quot; LEO said. &quot;It&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nhas been some time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBIG CONVOY nodded, &quot;It has indeed.&quot; He sai=\r\nd. He jerked his head in&lt;br&gt;\nTUSCON&#39;s direction and the pile of dirt that u=\r\nsed to be DRILLBIT,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Tuscon want&#39;s to talk to you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME =\r\nglanced at his soldiers behind him for a moment ands then&lt;br&gt;\nturned to TUS=\r\nCON a curious look on his face, &quot;So what&#39;s the situation&lt;br&gt;\ndown here?&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- =\r\nend group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-A811DA9B-7E37-4CE9-B0F5-F50D4AD1A07E--\r\n\n"}}
