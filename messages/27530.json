He smiles to himself. Ever since arriving at this planet, \nKillfest hadn&#39;t seen a bot as tall as himself, untill now. Killfest \napproaches Megaton, looking at him at eye level. He glances down at \nDrillBit.\n\n&quot;What happened while I was up in space fighting?&quot; he asks DrillBit, \nlooking around at the group.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer gets in a CR, his damage beginning to be repaired.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megaton looked back and forth from Darkfate to Drillbit, he wasn&#39;t \nquite\n&gt; sure exactly who was in charge. &quot;The news I bring is good for \neverybody\n&gt; except our enemies. The part dragon-TRex- robot said watching his \nsubjects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkmouse growls, looking up at Megaton and showing no fear. &quot;I&#39;d\n&gt; watch yourself if I were you. These are my friends you&#39;re around.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The 14 foot bot scoffed at the mouses statement about having \nfriends. &quot;There\n&gt; are no friends in wartime Mouse, We have only temporary \nconveniences when\n&gt; thier needed.&quot; He knew that he had the right idea because the way \nwar works\n&gt; isn&#39;t friendly.\n&gt; \n&gt; :::Starscream:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::He had gotten over the shock of seeing Megaton and realized that \nif\n&gt; he is joining them, They might as well be on friendlier terms::\n&gt; Starscream: It seems we will be allies from now on.  What do you say\n&gt; we let bygones be bygones?\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton watched Starscreams actions more than listened to his \nwords, he\n&gt; seemed sincere but as the old one often did could be hiding \nsomething. He\n&gt; sensed an awkward feeling, like someone stepping on his grave (Since\n&gt; Starscream tossed Megatron out of the ship in the movie it&#39;s \nreasonable.)\n&gt; The joys of war were presenting themselves, first he was trying to \ndestroy\n&gt; Starscream, now they were allies. &quot;I agree. We are no longer at \neach others\n&gt; backs so we can agree.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He wispered to StarScream, &quot;We will except him for now, but keep an\n&gt; optic on him. The second we have a good reason, we turn him into \nscrap.&quot;\n&gt; He then turned back to Megaton.\n&gt; &quot;Do not speak to my officers that way, please,&quot; he said, refering to\n&gt; Dark Mouse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;As you wish, I was not aware that you made her an officer, \nMegatrons files\n&gt; listed her as just another sacrifice- I mean soldier to fight for \nthe\n&gt; Predacon cause.&quot; The mutant minced his words to piss off his new \nassociates.\n&gt; He wanted thier full attention on the enemy at hand and he knew he \nhad it\n&gt; even though he knew that none of the Preds he&#39;d encountered  \ntrusted any of\n&gt; his intentions. Darkmouse was seemong a little overconfident due to \nthe\n&gt; comment so Megaton fealt that he had to put her back in the right \nplace.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t get cocky little one, even though you are high in rank you \ncould\n&gt; still easily be placed at the bottom of the food chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Get to the point, Megaton! If you want to continue to beat around \nthe\n&gt; bush, then go take a swim in the lava! Now tell us what you came to\n&gt; tell.&quot;\n&gt; He calmed himself, and his tone with the last sentance.\n&gt; He would stand up for his troops. They were family to him. Megaton\n&gt; wasn&#39;t going to come into their home, and push them around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatons focus again presented itself to Drillbit. &quot;My point is \nthat I have\n&gt; access to the other Predacon base, and a strategy that would allow \nus to\n&gt; destroy the other faction. Megaton smiled knowing that deciept and \ntrust\n&gt; were opposites in the Predacon dictionary. &quot;If you will listen to \nmy ideas\n&gt; and follow my directions we will eliminate any opposition.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Several troops of Darkfate were arriving to see what&#39;s going on.\n&gt; Darkfate felt the tention in the Black Fortress.  His four snakes\n&gt; were ready and hissing around the body of their master.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course that Megaton, won&#39;t have by now any intention to fight&quot;\n&gt; said the dragon &quot;it&#39;s not wise annoy a Dragon in his own lair... &quot; \nhe\n&gt; added &quot;What are those important news Megaton?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton stayed calm and collected as the reinforcements arrived. In \nhis mind\n&gt; he was invinceable and this group would hardly be a challenge. \nDarkfate\n&gt; spoke,  &quot;Of course that Megaton, won&#39;t have by now any intention to \nfight&quot;\n&gt; said the dragon &quot;it&#39;s not wise annoy a Dragon in his own lair... &quot; \nhe added\n&gt; &quot;What are those important news Megaton?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Megaton took a smug act into his actions. &quot;It is unwise to annoy a \ndragon in\n&gt; any lair.&quot; He wanted every bot to know who he feared. He feared no \none.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 15, 2001 8:25 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Megatons hot entrance\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate/Alecto::\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Welcome to my base, Megaton&quot; Said Darkfate &quot;I hope\n&gt; &gt; that the news that you bring us are really pleasant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I hope that you behave and don&#39;t disturb the master\n&gt; &gt; of the house&quot; said rude a femme voice. &quot;I&#39;ll be happy\n&gt; &gt; to..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ALECTO SHUT UP!!!!!&quot; screamed Darkfate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The femme smiled sarcastically and dissapear in a\n&gt; &gt; corridor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Alecto always behave in that way, don&#39;t worry...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; said Darkfate. and he came in leading the way towards\n&gt; &gt; the conference room\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- CYBERWOLF4 &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton grinned a fake smile as he still looked down\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the others. &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; glad to hear you&#39;re a bot of reason.&quot; he started\n&gt; &gt; &gt; walking toward the base,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Shall we go inside and discuss our options?&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked knowing that he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now in control wether they knew it or not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He caught Darkmouses look of disgust out of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; corner of his eyes.
