His design is\nmovie-li=\r\nke (can we say G3 now?) in the sense that his dragon mode is\nsimilar to the=\r\n way Scorponok looks like a scorpion.\n\nBic:\n\nUndisturbed, Azureblade takes =\r\nto the air and charges his blast in the\nair so that the heat detonates the =\r\nincoming rockets (or as many as\npossible) before they get to him. In the bu=\r\nilding momentum, he readies\nto attack the other Minion and aims his sword a=\r\nt the other&#39;s wings.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;superc=\r\nyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He planted his sword in the ground than backed=\r\n off a little before\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; thousands of pieces moved to form somethin=\r\ng else. His mechanical tail\n&gt; &gt; was long and seemed like a heavy flail, his=\r\n wings seemed to have been\n&gt; &gt; made to shred things up, and he seemed to lo=\r\nok like a standing\n&gt; &gt; skeleton the way his armor covered him. His neck was=\r\n extended, but\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; so much as theirs. His horns started drilling an=\r\nd he opened his jaws\n&gt; &gt; for a massive roar... followed by an equally massi=\r\nve blast of energy\n&gt; &gt; aimed at the leftmost enemy. Without waiting, he too=\r\nk the sword out\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the Moon&#39;s rocky soil and brandished it menacing=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: You amuse me Minions. You show yourselves as tough=\r\n, but\n&gt; &gt; are really nothing like the real deal. You won&#39;t amuse me for lon=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Are you in the form of a dragon brandishing a sword, or som=\r\nething\n&gt; else?\n&gt; \n&gt; As the minions get closer, thier form become clearer. T=\r\nhey do indeed\n&gt; resemble dragons at first: They have the wings, the tails a=\r\nnd head, but\n&gt; only the rear legs and small front legs. (Think wyvern or dr=\r\nake) Like\n&gt; shadows they streak through the skies even as Azureblade&#39;s deat=\r\nh\n&gt; dealing breath scortches one of them, sending it spinning in long\n&gt; loo=\r\nping circles, its armor crisping under the assault!\n&gt; \n&gt; Agile as birds and=\r\n yet as domininat as lions the other two circle for a\n&gt; moment and then one=\r\n of them alights on the ground shifting form as he\n&gt; does so. Even as the o=\r\nther circles like a vulture waiting for its prey\n&gt; to fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the int=\r\nermittent light the new commer&#39;s armor is a reflective silver\n&gt; and ebony b=\r\nlack. Standing a few arm lengths away his stance is large\n&gt; and agressive, =\r\nred horns rising from his helm, as black wings flare\n&gt; from his back. Sharp=\r\n spikes of armor extend from his shoulder plating\n&gt; as cannon mounts rest o=\r\nn his pectoral chestplates. In one hand he\n&gt; wields a wickedly curved sword=\r\n nearly as large as he is a strangly\n&gt; reflective black!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your ammusme=\r\nnt will fade with your life functions. You face Animus\n&gt; first blade of Vor=\r\npal.&quot; With a deliberate motion he points the sword at\n&gt; Azureblade even as =\r\nhis the outside calf plates of his armor open up and\n&gt; release a flurry of =\r\nrockets at Azureblade.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Animus)\n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________=\r\n___________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
