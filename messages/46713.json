I&#39;ll agree with you on \n&gt; that =\r\none. Preds and Decepticons are cowardly at best.&quot; He transforms \n&gt; into his=\r\n vehicle mode for Skullhammer, a red, black and blue sleek \n&gt; motorcycle wi=\r\nth a red seat, black side armour, and blue fenders. His \n&gt; blue Autobot sym=\r\nbols gleam on both sides of his side armour. He \n&gt; stays in motorcycle mode=\r\n for a few seconds, then his frame folds \n&gt; back into his robot mode, and h=\r\ne lands on his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I also transform into a sword and a shield, but =\r\nthere&#39;s no point in \n&gt; showing off even more.&quot; He says as he continues to f=\r\nollow Pacifix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix enters the control room, and motions for the gr=\r\noup to take a \n&gt; seat. He himself sits down in the control chair in the sou=\r\nth side of \n&gt; the room. &quot;Welcome, Skullhammer, to the Autobot base. The que=\r\nstion \n&gt; of the day is whether you intend to join us, or perhaps there was =\r\n\n&gt; another purpose for your arrival. We would be honoured to have you \n&gt; jo=\r\nin us, but we would also do all in our power to help you if you \n&gt; choose n=\r\not to stay.&quot; He looks at Crossroads who has taken a seat at \n&gt; the scanners=\r\n on the far left side, and then back to Skullhammer, his \n&gt; eyes crossing t=\r\nhe oval shaped grey and blue room, taking in the \n&gt; newer technology that w=\r\nent into the ship; the weapons systems, then \n&gt; light shielding (invisibili=\r\nty), long range to short range high \n&gt; detail scanners, and the engine cont=\r\nrols, which were destroyed \n&gt; beyond hopes of repair from their crash.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ooC: Just trying to give you an idea of the base. =3D)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwr=\r\npg@y..., &quot;polar_claw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (OOC) I sure make a h=\r\nabit of the OOC beginnings, yes? Anyhoo, I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; curious if the board=\r\n usually gets even MORE active on weekends of \n&gt; not=85\n&gt; &gt; Just so I know =\r\nif I should check in more than twice daily. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (IC) Flashing a brigh=\r\nt steel grin, Skullhammer nods in agreement. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; smaller transforme=\r\nr, indeed less aggressive for the moment than \n&gt; &gt; Crotale, seems to be a r=\r\nelatively welcoming sort of bot. His \n&gt; voice, \n&gt; &gt; resonant and full, into=\r\nnes his answer. &quot;Thank you. Yes, big I am. \n&gt; &gt; With this new form, I don&#39;t=\r\n expect many of the Preds or \n&gt; Decepticons \n&gt; &gt; on this planet to have muc=\r\nh to say when I come into the fray. \n&gt; &gt; Skullhammer&#39;s my name, by the way.=\r\n&quot; With a curious gesture, \n&gt; &gt; Skullhammer asks in kind what Crossroads&#39; al=\r\nternate form is, \n&gt; &gt; considering the transformer is so much smaller than t=\r\nhe massive \n&gt; &gt; elephant. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The elephantine transformer, still in b=\r\neast mode, takes up stride \n&gt; &gt; with the pair of Pacifix and Crossroads. Co=\r\nnsidering the \n&gt; advantages \n&gt; &gt; of shifting, the large creature attempts t=\r\no bring a transformation \n&gt; &gt; about. With a powerful flexing of his metalli=\r\nc muscles, \n&gt; Skullhammer \n&gt; &gt; realigns a myriad of parts to quickly stand =\r\nbefore them in robot \n&gt; &gt; mode. In truth, the cannons on his arm must appea=\r\nr menacing to \n&gt; &gt; someone not expecting the simple silvery-grey elephant t=\r\no appear \n&gt; &gt; armed with twin cannons built on the sides of his arms. He qu=\r\nickly \n&gt; &gt; disarms them so as not to cause any unrest, and the cannons swiv=\r\nel \n&gt; &gt; back off the top of his forearm to the side, and then backwards by =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; his elbow. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Skullhammer again flashes the same smile, a sort =\r\nof uncaring and \n&gt; &gt; honest smile that can easily show his lack of desire t=\r\no cause any \n&gt; &gt; trouble. His bright blue eyes light up as he sees the fami=\r\nliar \n&gt; style \n&gt; &gt; of base and equipment, having been stuck in a Maximal be=\r\nast \n&gt; training \n&gt; &gt; facility for the last three earth months. His chest fe=\r\natures the \n&gt; &gt; Autobot insignia prominently (much like Lioconvoy features =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; Maximal/Cybertron logo) in a brilliant red. Most of his accenting =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; parts are a red of some shade. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His strides soon take the sam=\r\ne rhythm of Pacifix&#39;s footfalls, and \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; treads along the Autobot co=\r\nmpound with quieter steps. As an \n&gt; elephant, \n&gt; &gt; his four feet make a thu=\r\nnderous racket. As a robot, his regular \n&gt; legs \n&gt; &gt; make a less violent di=\r\nn, even on metal or concrete. He follows \n&gt; &gt; Pacifix and Crossroads and wa=\r\nits to see what happens.\n\n\n"}}
