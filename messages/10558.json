He looked as \nBlack Aracnia gave Rampage the altimatuem. He slowly rose out of the shadows \nand put his arm cannon to the back of Rampage. Thunder Hammer looked at \nBlack Aracnia waitng to get a signel to open fire. A smile came across \nThunder Hammer&#39;s face, knowing he had done well.\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: NBW\n&gt;Date: Mon, 7 Aug 2000 15:41:17 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;     Black Aracnia leads the way down the hall. Behinde her Paralysis,\n&gt;Quickstrike, and Darkmouse follow. She was headed for the bridge to take \n&gt;over\n&gt;once and for all.\n&gt;     The doors slide open and Black Aracnia enters. Paralysis signals to \n&gt;the\n&gt;others to stay put until Aracnia said what she needed to say. &quot;Wait here.\n&gt;Aracnia is gonna tell him off.&quot;\n&gt;     Aracnia stands before Rampage. &quot;Now, Rampage. I have control of this\n&gt;ship, and several armed associates that will fight along with me. Let me \n&gt;rule\n&gt;the Predacons with Megatron now, peacefully, or refuse and die. I hate to \n&gt;be\n&gt;so blunt...but were short on time.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
