Fine, he \nthinks, if this bot wanted to die, so be it.\n\nReptilica aims at Testifier, firing two missiles.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing Blender and Stronghold down, Bloodystrike laughs, putting away both \nhis guns and taking out a missile launcher. He fires two missiles at Deemos, \nwhile DevilDuer shoots his pistol at Blender and Stronghold, just for thrills.\n\n"}}
