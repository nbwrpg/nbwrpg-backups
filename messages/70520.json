In the distance he could\n&gt; see what appeared to be shadowy shap=\r\nes in the air. They looked\n&gt; different from the first set of insects that h=\r\ne had seen. These were\n&gt; winged, and it was their wings in flight that he h=\r\neard as they\n&gt; approached. Also their bodies were longer, more like hornets=\r\n, although\n&gt; they had six cleaver like claws that looked sharp enough to sl=\r\nice\n&gt; through anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were three of them moving through the ai=\r\nr, in the dimming light\n&gt; Tuscon could just see that their wings were a blu=\r\ne white, their bodies\n&gt; were a darker blue. Their color scheme was startlin=\r\ng close to\n&gt; Scourge&#39;s colors, or perhaps one of his sweeps. Also Tuscon&#39;s =\r\nradar\n&gt; seemed to be unable to pick up these creatures. He could see them j=\r\nust\n&gt; fine, but his radar on which he was so used to depending was unable t=\r\no\n&gt; get a reading on them, and the insects were quickly approaching the\n&gt; c=\r\nar, the buzzing of their wings becoming louder and louder.\n&gt; \n&gt; He could he=\r\nar that same feminine voice, &quot;We are the horde, and we are\n&gt; coming for you=\r\n. You cannot escape, because there is no where to go.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile the c=\r\nar itself was puling in towards some sort of depot,\n&gt; although with the gro=\r\nwing shadows of the day it was difficult to see\n&gt; inside far enough to see =\r\nwhether there was any sort of welcoming party\n&gt; there or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nearby V=\r\nestige moaned and stirred slightly.
