I am programmed to serve you, \nundyingly.\n\n::: Megatron, in his beast mode ::: Ah yes. The process was a success. Now, \nWaspinator, contact Set, or Shuko, or both of them and let them know we have \nRa, and without him his dieties cannot form Dark Messhia.\n\n::: Waspinator nodded, and sent the message while Ra bowed contunuoulsy to \nMegatron. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Thats enough, Ra. Together, you and i are going to make a \nfew changes in the beasts wars, definetly.\n\n~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Marine took several shots, but fired two green optic laster back at \nAnubis and Hades, while Gremlin took a few shots at Shuko along with Jackle. \nPheniox, attavcking from the sky shot numerous fire balls at serpentor. The \nautoguns, and Transanulas fired at unitron.

You want to kill him? \nWell, for the time being you WILL go out there and help us get rid of these \npests or I wont tell you. Is that clear, fembot?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Set recived the Message, with Ominous behinde him. They were a bit \nshocked. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Damn! We cant attack them....they wou-\n\n::: The ship rattled and on the main veiwer was a picture of Megatron, \nWaspinator, and Ra assulting the ship. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Ominous, get out there and fight!\n\n::: Ominous looked at him in disgust ::: Agianst them, Ill be killed!\n\n::: Set ::: Coward, do I have to do everything?!!\n\n::: Ominous didnt tolerate anyone, and with that comment, Set just made his \nlist. :::\n\n::: Ominous slammed his fist into the control pannel, sending spark shooting \noff. ::: Set, one thing you should know about me is that I dont take orders \nfrom ass holes!\n\n::: Set shot Ominous who took it in his arm, and then ran out of te bridge, \nscraming, ::: Fine, lets see how much damage Megatron and his minions can do \nin here!\n\n::: Set ghasped, for Ominous had just dropped the shields and now Megatron, \nRa, and Waspinator were within the ship, blowing it to bits. :::\n\n::: Set ::: Shuko, I need some of your merceneries!
