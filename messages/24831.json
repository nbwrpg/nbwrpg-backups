Whatever just happened must have been big, \nbecause when she finally got to her feet Her console was flashing warning \nlights all over the place. The hull had been penetrated, and two enemy bots \nwere headed for the bridge, with more on the way:\n\n&quot;Hey, tha--&quot;\n\nHysteria was going to thank Chordate for the warning, but he seemed to be \nmissing. Someone, or something, must have grabbed him. Great. Just great. \nShe was alone, in the CF, and about to get her butt whupped by &#39;bots twice \nher size. Hysteria dove under her console and dug through the debri. She \npulled out an interface cord and a small portable computer. Well, she didn&#39;t \nstand a chance in an all out battle, but maybe there was something else she \ncould do.\n\nHysteria climbed on the main console and pulled herself up into the enarest \nvent. For once her size was an advantage. She could fit, but the other &#39;bots \nwouldn&#39;t get halfway in before they were stuck! She jacked into a panel a \nfew feet down the vent and booted the computer:\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t these guys ever give up?!&quot;\n\nHysteria activated several sub programs before she was able to interact with \nthe CF&#39;s mainframe. She silently typed out several codes:\n\nCF COMP: &quot;Access granted. Bridge lockdown commencing.&quot;\n\nWith a loud bang and slight shaking large, steel panels slid over the \ncomputers in the CF. The panels were thick, and nearly impenetrable without \nresulting in serious damage to the computers behind them. All but one \nemergency computer were now well protected. A slight keystroke set the \ncomputer to self-detonate. It was a last ditch effort, but a necessary one. \nThree more passwords and she was done, for now:\n\nCF COMP: &quot;Auto defences activated.&quot;\n\nThe remaining defences in the ship opened fire on Unitron and Firestarter. \nFlame throwers that had been laying dormant beneath floor panels were \nsuddenly brough to life. The few remaining autoguns sent a barage of armor \npiercing bullets at the invading &#39;bots.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
