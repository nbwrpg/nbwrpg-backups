There \nwas a good chance she was faking, he knew her internal systems would \ncompensate, but he had to be sure.\n\nBesides, a wolf never leaves prey injured. Its either dinner or \nescaped.\n\n&quot;Oh don&#39;t cry little birdy, it won&#39;t hurt very long.&quot; he turned back \ntowards Shadow Wing, baring his fangs as he spoke.

He\n&gt; waited until she was close sped up a little and called\n&gt; out, &quot;Maximize.&quot;The cry wasn&#39;t necessary but it fealt proper. A\n&gt; battle cry that brought all the different animals in the Maximal \narmy\n&gt; together. The wolf became bot again, turned and grabbed her talons,\n&gt; pulling her down. &quot;Lesson one, make your prey come to your\n&gt; strengths.&quot; With those last words Lunarpine transformed back to wolf\n&gt; and started in the other direction.&quot;By the way, you&#39;re still it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
