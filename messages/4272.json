It&#39;s just unfair.&quot; He was \nlifting really tall and heavy Blast Shields then moving them into place. &quot;But \nhe is Magmatron the Emperor of Destruction. And my boss. Drat.&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n::Magmatron::\n\n    He stood outside of his base setting up camera equipment on the \nsurrounding rocks. &quot;This should tell me when anyone arives before they are a \nthreat.&quot; He thought to himself. Bazooka came into view.\n    &quot;All (catching breath) .....Defense systems up and running. Sir&quot; Bazooka \nsaid.\n    &quot;Good, you may go the the CR chambers if nessary.&quot; Magmatron replied. He \nopened a bag at his waist. In it were two rocks, One marked with a Maximal \nSignal and sign the other with a Predacon signal and sign. &quot;Autoguns online.&quot; \nHe threw the Predacon rock. The autoguns tracked and destroyed it completly. \n&quot;Execellent&quot; Magmatron muttered to himself. He threw the Maximal rock, the \nguns did the same, destroyed it completly.\n    Off the ground he picked up a rock, taking out a symbol upon it he tossed \nit over his shoulder. The guns did not track it or fire. It was the combined \nDNA from all dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth, and some that haden&#39;t. Now the \ndinosaur transformers were safe to enter the base.\n    &quot;Bazooka anyone you would recomend as a good troop?&quot; Magmatron asked.\n    Bazooka replied: &quot;Shredder, the one who decided for me to be Predacon is \na good choice, also Black Arachnia.&quot;\n    &quot;Shredder humm...I like the sound of that name, what is his beast mode?&quot; \nMagmatron asked.\n    &quot;I don&#39;t belive he has one. But I could be wrong.&quot; Bazooka replied.\n    &quot;Well I&#39;ll have to give him a call.....&quot;\n\n"}}
