Mankind, Stone\nCold Steve Autsin, HHH, and the Undertaker all came from WCW. Sure the\nRadicalz havent done anything great, but they werent given a chance.\nNo Roland, what I meant is Mchmahon won&#39;t buy his contract and bring him\nin now.\n\nI would be all for DX if Scott Hall joined, ohhh yeah. But we probably\nwill never see Road Dogg again, cause he&#39;s a friging pot smoker.\n\n"}}
