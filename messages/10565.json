She looked at the monitor for a moment.  She \naimed two of the mamual guns at the Maximals and aimed at thier feet. \nor inches above thier heads.  She looked at Paralysis. &quot;Opps, my aim \nis a little off.&quot; She said with a slight blush in her face.  She face \nthe monitor and fored again, still hitting ground inches from the \nmaximal that she was aiming at.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Black Aracnia has enough of this.

Darkmouse and Paralysis start the manual weponry and try \nto scare \n&gt; off the Maximals, if not killing them. As for Rampage and the \nTerricons, you \n&gt; can go outside and help or get off my bridge!&quot; She yelled, taking \nthe command \n&gt; chair.\n&gt;     Now in control, Black Aracnia took the floating keyboard and \nbegan to \n&gt; start up the old rusty missle turrets. Paralysis climed into a \nsmall cockpit \n&gt; shape chaber with two large canon that he could use to blast away \nanyone \n&gt; outside the ship. He targeted the Dinobots and fired.\n&gt;     Aracnia typed in the sccess codes and off whissed three heat \nseeking \n&gt; missles, intent on making that body heat dead cold.\n\n\n"}}
