The sun was \nhigh in the sky, and a few clouds were crawling westwards. He \nstretched his wings, made of metal. He then turned to Mistra, and, \neven though she must have looked grotesque to another bot, she seemed \nbeautiful to him. He had never felt that way. After the atrocities he \nhad commited at the capture of his brother and the slaughter of the \ntwo Decepticons, this feeling was a bliss. He was feeling peaceful \njust looking at her.\n\nAzureBlade: I know you will be able! If you need help however, I&#39;m \nsure I&#39;ll be able to carry you to the city!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; AzureBlade: Then, I think we should go back to Maximal City. \nThey will \n&gt; &gt; probably be able to help you find your activation code. However, \nit is \n&gt; &gt; far away. Do you think you will be able to fly a long way?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mistra grinned &quot;I&#39;ll give it a try.&quot; She realized she hadn&#39;t yet \ntried her \n&gt; wings out for flying...but they should work well enough, considering \nher size \n&gt; in relation to them. Hopefully they&#39;d be good for long distances. \n\n\n"}}
