Oh,\n&gt; and you know how \n&gt; Kinger is \n&gt; &gt; always complaining about moding? Yes, well, in the\n&gt; past several \n&gt; posts he has \n&gt; &gt; said that Hell Beast is dead. I think that\n&gt; qualifies as a mode.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     The Virus Scanner loacted the Virus. Indded it\n&gt; had surrounded \n&gt; the Spark \n&gt; &gt; of Hell Beast. But, luckily this Virus Scanner\n&gt; could hold it off \n&gt; for awhile.\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Hmm....were going to need something to get\n&gt; rid of this Virus. \n&gt; And I just \n&gt; &gt; know what will do the trick. Call Darkmouse.&quot;\n&gt; Megatron ordered. He \n&gt; was going \n&gt; &gt; to beg her, do anything, for a Liquid Energon\n&gt; transfussion. Just \n&gt; enough to \n&gt; &gt; kill the Virus off, not nearly as much as she has\n&gt; in her body.\n&gt; &gt;     Looking to the comm, Megatron says,\n&gt; &quot;Darkmouse, This is \n&gt; Commander \n&gt; &gt; MEgatron. I beseech you to allow us a quart of\n&gt; your Liquid Energon \n&gt; blood. \n&gt; &gt; Senator Hell Beast is currently ill and needs it\n&gt; to combat a Virus. \n&gt; If you \n&gt; &gt; allow us what we ask, we will grant you a favor.\n&gt; Please think our \n&gt; offer over. \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps this could be the first steps to a treaty\n&gt; of peace between \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt; factions. Thank you agian.&quot; He said finally and\n&gt; logged off, hoping \n&gt; she would \n&gt; &gt; accept.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
