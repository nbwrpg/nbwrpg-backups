She left a \nsmall trail of blood as she made her way. But the softly falling snow \nwould cover it in a matter of minutes.  She just kept going. She \nheaded now in a northern direction. She sniffed the wind and caught \nscent of something.  She couldn&#39;t tell what it was. She shrugged her \nshoulders and kept walking. \n\nShe came to stop about an hour later.  She was starting to feel very \ntired and her shoulder was throbbing. She layed down in the snow. And \nwas almosts invisible, except for the red blood on the shoulder.  She \nput her head on her front paws and started to drift in and out of \nsleep.  The snow was lightly falling and started to cover her with a \nthin veil of snow. \n\nShe slipped into sleep and dreamed of the old times with Lunerpine.\nShe dreamed of sparring with him again. She dreamed of fighting with \nhim. She dreamed of how she managed to get him to lower his gueard \nwhen sparring and then getting him.  She had a very large grin on her \npolar bear face as she lay in the snow, sleeping.\n\n\n"}}
