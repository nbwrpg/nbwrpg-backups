Tucson was one of those students worthy of such an a=\r\nncient art.  He performs the maneuver in draconic form, as he gracefully tw=\r\nists his body around to attempt to meet the blast with his blocking maneuve=\r\nr.  He spins swiftly on one foot, as his tail coils around his body as part=\r\n of the block.
