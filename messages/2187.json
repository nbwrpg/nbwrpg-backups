Also, Allied Forces still sounds almost identical to The\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Alliance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people could get the two confused pretty easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Prowl::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prowl&#39;s hands move to get a more confortable hold on Iron Raptor.
