Her tummy, for the first \ntime in a while, was round and full of warm milk.\nHer little eyes started to close and then open again, close and open again \nuntil they closed for the last time and she fell into a very comfortable \nsnooze. Half asleep but half awake too.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
