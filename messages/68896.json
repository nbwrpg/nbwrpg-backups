Using their agility and speed they turned \nin \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies wi=\r\nth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bullets and energy!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy for his part pulled back,=\r\n using the Ark as an additional \n&gt; &gt; &gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming=\r\n sweeps. Much like Lord \n&gt; Elder&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the =\r\nsweep disperesed, leaving him \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at =\r\na time rather then destroying \n&gt; &gt; many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As =\r\nJhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; approache=\r\nd from their different vectors, they could all see the \n&gt; &gt; grim \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vis=\r\nta of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. At \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nenter of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the \nstorm \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; sweeps that floated around him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To those who had been at t=\r\nhe battle above Atlantis the sight \n&gt; &gt; brought \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Al=\r\nthough there were not as many sweep here as \n&gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlan=\r\ntis, with Cyclonus were several other minions: \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Nig=\r\nhtstrike as well as three others which were unknown - A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warning that=\r\n this battle may prove to be far more dangerous \nthen \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one b=\r\nefore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked his breath weapon attac=\r\nk proved \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps and s=\r\ninged several \nothers \n&gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the \n&gt; re=\r\nar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several \nof=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their pla=\r\nces. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from =\r\nthe \nwould-\n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to open fire on A=\r\nrk and Legacy \nas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At same time minions were receiving orders from Scourge who was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; himself floating into position and was more then ready to prove \n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nimself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are with me!

Please understand.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; --- On Wed, 7/9/08, supercyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: supercyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: The War of the ARK!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, July 9, 2008, 5:11 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Can I assume that the Maximal/Iron Skull Predacons are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on their way?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ((OOC: Sounds good to me. If you want to control them, I do not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their appearance.) )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Elder&#39;s commands were carried out by the station and the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; guns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; erupted into the air with a deadly symphony of wreckage! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Firepower &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ripped into the invaders as first\n the shuttle&#39;s batteries and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ark violently pulled sweeps from the skies! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However much like the last battle the sweeps dispersed, making &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much harder to hit. Using their agility and speed they turned &lt;BR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; air, spinning as the weapons continued to pepper the skies with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bullets and energy!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy for his part pulled back, using the Ark as an additional &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; defence as he laid into the oncoming sweeps. Much like Lord &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Elder&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attack, it was effective but the sweep disperesed, leaving him &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pick one or two out of the air at a time rather then destroying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at a time. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Jhiaxus and Scorponok, Grimlock and Hydras and Rodimus\n all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; approached from their different vectors, they could all see the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; grim &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vista of the sweeps, and the number of them was staggering. At &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; center of all this Cyclonus floated a cold calm amidst the &lt;BR&gt;storm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sweeps that floated around him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To those who had been at the battle above Atlantis the sight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; brought &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a darker reality: Although there were not as many sweep here as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; there &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; were at Atlantis, with Cyclonus were several other minions: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Darkfate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and Nightstrike as well as three others which were unknown - A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; warning that this battle may prove to be far more dangerous &lt;BR&gt;then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Grimlock landed and attacked\n his breath weapon attack proved &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; effective, striking down several sweeps and singed several &lt;BR&gt;others &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they maneuvered out of his way. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Hydras approached from the rear his guns opening up on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rear &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; flank of the sweeps, they dispersed into the skies as several &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; were brought down and many more came in to take their places. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As the sweeps coiled around, absorbing the attacks from the &lt;BR&gt;would-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; defenders, in unison they began to open fire on Ark and Legacy &lt;BR&gt;as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well as Grimlock and the defending shuttle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; At same time minions were receiving orders from Scourge who was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; himself floating into position and was more then\n ready to prove &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; himself, &quot;Tumult, Nightstrike and Darkfate You are with me! We &lt;BR&gt;go &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; destroy the ark, and TAKE the Matrix!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The answer from Tumult was quick, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; as he powered up &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; engines and maneuvered himself into position near the top of &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; host.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Strangely the response for the approaching Decepticons and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Predicons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was a bit different - Although the Sweeps avoided combat, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; combat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was initiated. Instead Hydras recieved a call: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hydras&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice crackled over the communication &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lines &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in an ancient Unicronian code. &quot;You were once Galvatron, I can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feel &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his essence within you, and I have felt it since you have\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; approached. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have given you and yours a stay of execution because of that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ancient connection between us. Approach no farther and live, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; leave &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and you will be rewarded when our work here is done.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-564119241-1216226743=:85290--\r\n\n"}}
