He lets out a very loud laugh and fires a very, very, \nlarge missile aimed directly at Rage&#39;s chest.  Unfortunately he was too \nstupid to realize the reason it should only be used in tank mode.  The one \nshot launched him backwards approximately a hundred yards and crushed him \ninto the ground dislodging Skar who fell to the ground in a stasis lock.\n\n::Knok::\n    During this time Knok had slowly climbed up the cliff and followed the \nobvious tracks of Blaise.  Curious about the battle he had snuck up to where \nSkarBlaise landed moments later.  He climbed on top of Blaise&#39;s now unmoving \nbody and placed himself where Skar had been.\n\n::KnokBlaise::\n    He stood up and his first order of business was to shout to Rage &quot;Stop!  \nDon&#39;t hurt me.  I am no longer your enemy.&quot;\n\n"}}
