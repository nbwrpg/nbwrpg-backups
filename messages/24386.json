Immortal!  As long as Majic-12 and \nSTAAR and Aspasia and Artad want it around, that is...and Icedemon, Pyro is \nnow part of Oblitertron, please restate your post\n\nJOKER&#39;S ON THE REBOUND BABY!)\n\n\nOblitertron/Sixshot/Dark Wolf/Double \nPunch/Injector/Manterror/Bumblebee/Ares/Nemesis \nEnforcer/Scattershot/Firestarter/\nChordate:\n\n\n\n\n\nOblitertron was large.  But he wasn&#39;t stupid.  Well, not that stupid.\n\nHe raised his left arm, firing off two fire balls, intercepting most of the \nmissiles, moving his head to the right, letting the missile harmlessly fly \nby.  He fired off an optic blast directly at the charge as he moved his head.\n\nHe felt the missile and shells strike him and grunted.  He grew weary of this \nweak battle.\n\nThe gestalt raised his right arm, firing off three bolts from his rifle at \nHysteria.\n\n---\n\nSixshot saw Ares had control of the situation, and shifted his aim.  He fired \noff four shots from both cannons in both batteries.\n\nSixteen blasts lanced out at Gigan.\n\n---\n\nDark Wolf let out a raspy, animal-like laugh as the optics hit his chest.  He \nlooked down at his chest, another orb forming.  He lifted it and threw his \narm forward, but turned quickly, throwing the orb at the Cybertronian Fire \ninstead.\n\nHe let out a howl as the orb got passed the shields and blew up against the \nhull of the ship.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch sidestepped, the missiles passing by, most of the shots \nfolloiwng, but two struck his left arm.  He cursed, raising both arms and \nfiring off an energy-signature seeking missile from both arms at Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nInjector ducked the laser blasts, the missile knocking him backwards.  He \nfired off 15 rapid optic blasts down at Torca.\n\n---\n\nManterror slid through the air, dodging the missile, six shots striking him \nin the side.  He flew to the side still, raising an arm, firing off three ion \ndisks down at Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee flew to the side, two nail sticking into his left shoulder.  He \nfired off two stinger missiles from both stinger missiles, four stinger \nmissiles heading for Torca.\n\n---\n\nScattershot flew forward, firing off twenty-five explosive rounds at \nTavatron, the energy blast striking him in the left side.  He slowly \ndescended, but his mind clicked, and he ignored the pain because he was \npsychotic.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer raised his rifle, firing off twenty rapid laser blasts at \nthe CF.\n\n---\n\nFirestarter flew through the air, looking around for a target, only a few \nhundred feet away.\n\n===\n\nChordate checked the readings.  Shields were only at 4%, hull was at 89%.  He \ncursed, not knowing of another ower supply to aid the shields.\n\n"}}
