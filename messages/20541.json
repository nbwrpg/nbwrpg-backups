The side \neffects could be death, but he didn&#39;t care, as long as it would help \nIron Raptor.\n\n&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound too complicated,&quot; he simply replies to Iris, looking \nback at Iron Raptor.\n\n&quot;I think we should get a bit into the wilderness though, so we \nwouldn&#39;t cause too much trouble here if something bad does happen.&quot;\n\nHis mind was merely brishing the threat of death aside, knowing that \nit was worth it for him to die for Iron Raptor.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor watched Prowl just as intently as she watched and \nlistened to \n&gt; Iris, wondering if he would really give up half his spark for her. \nBut she \n&gt; knew him, and even before she heard his reply she knew that he \nwould do it.\n&gt; She raised her head from her front limbs and stoof on all fours as \nshe heard \n&gt; Prowl replyintent in hearing what Iris&#39; answer was going to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iris would have nodded in understanding at Prowls answer...if she \nwould have \n&gt; had a head to begin with. But she simply just got down to business.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Prowl...it&#39;s very simple but very dangerouse. It has been \ntried a \n&gt; first time and in the end both sparks died, evaporated. You&#39;re \ntaking a \n&gt; great risk, but I admire your courage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor stepped forward.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s what he&#39;s known for...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she gave Prowl a little glance but then glued her \neyes to \n&gt; the star in the cracked screen again, wanting to hear just what he \nhad to \n&gt; do.\n&gt; But it always seemed that Prowl was always the one who saved her in \nthe \n&gt; end...he wouldn&#39;t let her down now.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Well, known for it or not, at least you know the prices now.\n&gt; Anyway, all you have to do Prowl is merge your spark with hers, \nstablizing \n&gt; her corrupted spark and thus calming her beats modes.\n&gt; There might be some side effects but nothing too seriouse I don&#39;t \nthink...*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
