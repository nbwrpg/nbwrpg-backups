The field \nthat he had made before once again took in all the energy and shots \nbefore flowing into Hellpeon making his eyes glow a dark red.\n\nHellpeon: &quot;YOu should know something... Chaochitan energy has odd \nafter affects once absorbed by any other then the Bamphomet and his \nelite. And since your friend or shield there absorbed it he is about \nto feel some after effects. Chaochitan energy leaves residual amounts \nleft in the bodies of those taking it in. And that... is your fatal \nflaw for I can manipulate the energy...&quot;\n\nHellpeon laughed evily as suddenly all the residual energy in guarda \nbegan to grow unstable and then exploded within it. At the same time \nthat barrier protecting hellpeon also faded.\n\nElsewhere at the Chivtron base the left head of Gemini fired an Ice \nbeam at Unitro and Shockwave. As Zero finally reached and enter the \nchivtron base.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jordan &lt;gunthers@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; it was just guarda\n&gt; \n&gt; 7/17/01 11:37:14 AM, Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yess that is right...it was i who got the 40000 post...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Gunthers, did Ultimo and Gaurda both absorb all the energy or was \nit \n&gt; &gt;just one of the two?
