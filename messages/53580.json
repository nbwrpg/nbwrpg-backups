If I \ninstalled a flight mode and associated components on your current \nbody, it would take a few hours.  On the other hand, building a \ntransformer shell from scratch could take days - but it&#39;s a lot more \nauthentic.  Or we could combine the two, giving you a temporary \nupgrade to tide you over until your new body is ready.  Either way, \nyou&#39;re putting a lot of trust in me.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
