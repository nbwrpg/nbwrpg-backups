It can smell \nthe scent of a wolf and it looks about.  It lets out a low growl and \nslowly walks on.  It follows the scent trail left by the wolf.  the \ntiger knows it&#39;s getting closer to it&#39;s prey because the scent trail \nis getting strong.  It uses stealth and cunning to follow it&#39;s next \nmeal.  It moves through the trees without a sound.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The wolf smells the air, something was coming his way, something \nbig and\n&gt; organic.
