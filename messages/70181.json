I almost forgot! Lord E=\r\nlder, Rat Trap here, and I got great news. Wheels did it sir. He was able t=\r\na jump start Rodimus and Rodimus is back on our side... Ughhh, ummm, un - f=\r\nortunately.. But, at least he&#39;s on our side again.. Anyway, they&#39;re still t=\r\nryn&#39; ta get Nightlight&#39;n Windlord outa there, and as far as I know, Rodimus=\r\n sprung everyone. Well, that wouldn&#39;tve been possible if Wheels hadn&#39;t gott=\r\nen through ta him. Anyway, that&#39;s the report, over.&quot;\n\nLord Elder sat back i=\r\nn his chair, a broad smile coming over his face as he listened. He looked o=\r\nver at Elita, &quot;You see, it is alright. Rodimus has been rescued.&quot; he said a=\r\ns he leaned forward in his chair. \n\nHe keyed his mic so that the others wou=\r\nld pick up his transmission, &quot;I am relaying this information to the others =\r\nas well, I am sure that Lord Perseus and the other maximals will be happy t=\r\no hear that we have Rodimus back.&quot; Elder said. \n\nElder was troubled though =\r\nas he transmitted the data to Legacy at the Maximal base. \n\n*     *     *  =\r\n   *     *\n\nMeawhile . . . \n\nWho: LEGACY\nLocation: Old Maximal Base - Tempo=\r\nrary Command Center\n\nLegacy received the information from Lord Elder, his s=\r\ningle optic pulsing as he read it. He looked up from the screen as he opene=\r\nd a communication channel, and boosted the gain on it with his own not inco=\r\nnsiderable skills.\n\n&quot;Autobots and Maximals!&quot; Legacy&#39;s powerful voice and tr=\r\nansmission arced over the network, attempting to reach anyone that was in t=\r\nhe vicinity of the Maximal base or in the area surrounding it. (OOC: It sho=\r\nuld reach anyone unless they don&#39;t want it to reach them)\n\n&quot;Rodimus has bee=\r\nn freed from Hydras&#39; control and now he, Tuscon, as well as those that acco=\r\nmpanied him are under fire within Hydras&#39; base. I predict with a 98.2775% c=\r\nertainty that they will need our assistance in order to be extricated from =\r\nthis.&quot;\n\nAs he talked Legacy had been on the move. he had already exited the=\r\n temporary command center and was walking to the exit of the base. &quot;I reque=\r\nst any back up that can be made available for this endeavor.&quot;\n\nWhen he reac=\r\nhed the outside Legacy shifted form, becoming a military satellite, complet=\r\ne with guns, scanners and communication gear. &quot;I am en route, and will send=\r\n data and co ordinates as requested.&quot;\n\nLegacy took to the air!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPres=\r\nton\n\n\n"}}
