(The bat probes and \nautoguns.) Have your main characters fire at him and I&#39;ll give you a \ndinner instead of minor damage.\n\nBounty ducked, sending Darkmouses blast away from him.\nThe bat probes couldn&#39;t get a positive lock on Bounty so they missed. \nThe shots from B. Nightmare, Mantys, and Wespa bounced off the \nspinning Bounty. He stopped to soon and a lone shot struck him in the \nside. He stumbled to the side and dropped his blades. Dizzy from all \nthe spinning he stumbled around VULNERABLE to any attack. His \ndepleted blasters returned to his side. He tried to see straight but \nfailed as he staggered against the wall of the Predacon Base.\n\nFinish him at your convenience Airly.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; OCC: that&#39;ll give troubles at the reaven with her leader... but ok \n&gt; just one... but you let me do to your charcter some wounds??\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC :::\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ::blacknightmare/mantys/wespa/6 probes::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;FIRE!!!!!!!&quot; screamed Blacknighmare while all bots and probes \n&gt; started shoot at the fheater of the bot... hoping that one of their \n&gt; shoots hit in the main target. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Bounty grinned, satisfied that these bots were tougher than the \n&gt; paper \n&gt; &gt; mache he&#39;d given them credit for. &quot;Bring it on birdie&quot;, he said \nas \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; continued his hopping to avoid the incoming fire.
