He fired plasma shots from his wrists the\n&gt;size of his hand. His guns came over his shoulders and\n&gt;a red point landed on hell beasts chest and a\n&gt;automatic fired numerous shots.\n&gt;--- JP3884@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;        Hell Beast fell backwards off of Rampage as\n&gt; &gt; Magnus&#39; shots rained down\n&gt; &gt; on him. Rampage was hit more than Hell Beast, but\n&gt; &gt; the giant crab pointed\n&gt; &gt; upward with his tricanon and fired at Magnus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        Tarantulas saw the shields shatter. And what\n&gt; &gt; a beautiful sight it was.\n&gt; &gt; However, the Maximals were right. The Element stood\n&gt; &gt; only a few hundred feet\n&gt; &gt; away and if the Predacons destroyed it, they\n&gt; &gt; Maximals would probly have the\n&gt; &gt; good luck of some other brand new and all powerful\n&gt; &gt; ship crashing into this\n&gt; &gt; area.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
