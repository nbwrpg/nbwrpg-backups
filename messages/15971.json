Thank you for the mercy \nthat you have shown.&quot;  She got up and looked at Prebon. Then she \nturned and took a few steps closer to the door and looked through it. \nSHe saw Striker. She snapped at him,&quot;That will teach you to show the \nMaster some respect. And don&#39;t try to leave your cell. If you try \nanything, we are both dead.&quot; She smiled evilly and walked back to \nPrebon&#39;s side. She looked at Prebon, &quot;Master, I wish to thank you for \nshowing your mercy today.&quot;  She leaned over and kissed Prebon on the \ncheek.\n\nShe thought she was going to be sick as she kissed Prebon.  She \ncouldn&#39;t believe she was doing this.  But she had to come up with \nsomething to get Prebon away from Striker so he could try to escape.  \nShe knew that she would self Destruct if he escaped, but she felt it \nwould be worth it if he got away and without that blasted chip.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon watched Spears beg for this bot.

One drew back the guns \n&gt; into the wall, but the other flipped out a very small spy cam in \nthe \n&gt; top corner. The image was broadcasted to Hammer in the main bridge. \n&gt; He turned to Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Remember! No aiding him, no giving him anything without his \n&gt; permission. If he tries to escape you will do everything in your \n&gt; power to stop him, and if he still escapes, you will kill yourself \na \n&gt; mile outside the base. Understand? Good.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon walked to the main bridge where Hammer was watching Striker \n&gt; through the camera.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If he tries anything, kill him. Soon we go for Ramulus.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix continued to stare at the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So who&#39;s gonna help me install these computer boards?
