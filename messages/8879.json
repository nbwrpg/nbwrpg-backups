Pyro growls.\n\n&quot;When we get them,&quot; he says, looking at Dinobot and patting his gun, &quot;I get \nto kill the big one.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl nods, moving closer to Iron Raptor. He could see she was not in top \nshape, carrying her might be better. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a lift,&quot; he says, turning \naround to face Reptilica and the other Alliance members.\n\n&quot;Allright,&quot; he yells out to them, &quot;Here it is!&quot;\n\nWith that, he throws the device, spinning around and grabbing Iron Raptor \naround the waist, his legs springing out as he jumps up, sweeping Iron Raptor \noff her feet and starting to fly.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; he yells down to Dinobot, clearing the trees.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica and Bloodystrike both jump for the device, smashing into each \nother. The fake detonator bounces off Reptilica&#39;s head, flying at Zardus.\n\nSeeing the Maximals take off, Scattershot, Pyro, and Breakdown go after them, \nScattershot and Breakdown following Prowl as Pyro runs at Dinobot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScavanger and Hiss turn their heads at the sound of Prowl yelling, then \nseeing the Maximals take off. Scavanger growls. &quot;Don&#39;t we get any peace?&quot;\n\nScavanger transforms into his undamaged HUMVEE mode, riding at Dinobot, Hiss \nrunning behind him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus growls as something hits him in the head, the Alliance commander \neasily catching a black device before it hits the ground. He turns around, \nlooking at Reptilica and Bloodystrike, who were staring at him in horror. He \nturns off his comm-link.\n\n&quot;What is this?&quot; he asks, looking calmly from the device to the escaping \nMaximals.\n\n&quot;Z-t-Um..,&quot; Reptilica says, trembling, &quot;The Maximal put bombs in the engine \nroom. That&#39;s the detonator. We traded the hostages for it.&quot;\n\nZardus coldly looks down at the device, his optics flashing slightly as he \nruns a scan through it, walking over to Reptilica.\n\n&quot;Idiot! Do you know what this is?&quot; he asks Reptilica, his voice starting to \nget angry. He pushes the button on the device, Reptilica gasping. A beam of \nlight emerges from the other end of the device as Reptilica and Bloodystrike \nlook at it in horror.\n\n&quot;This is a slagging flashlight,&quot; Zardus growls, Reptilica backing off. &quot;Go \nafter them, you fools!&quot;\n\nReptilica and Bloodystrike spin around, one flying off after Prowl, the other \nat Dinobot and Tavatron. Zardus crushes the flashlight, once again activating \nhis comm-link. He recieves Megatron&#39;s transmission.\n\n&quot;Hmm... A cease fire, yes,&quot; he replies, &quot;But I am too busy to help you for \nnow. When we get the base repaired, I&#39;ll contact you about further \nnegotiations.&quot;\n\n"}}
