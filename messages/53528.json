If we can bring it into play, their firepower \nadvantage will be negated.  And its cloaking ability is quite useful \nfor setting traps.&quot;  Devilcat smiles as an idea strikes him.  &quot;That \ncould be used to our advantage here as well.  If the enemy comes \nexpecting the defense capabilities of one starship and they are met \nwith two, it will make a mess of their attack plans.  Too bad it \nwould only work once.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yggdrasil nods hesitatingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: Establishing a good defense would allow our forces to\n&gt; destroy any attackers, but we would then need to root them out,\n&gt; whoever attacks first. In this case, The maximals could hold the \nline\n&gt; here while the Rogues go and destroy the remaining attackers at \ntheir\n&gt; base. The preds tend to strike with all forces, but I don&#39;t know \nabout\n&gt; the Tripreds. Besides, their ship seemed to be quite well defended.\n&gt; That would be very hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I understand that the Tripreds are much more dangerous,&quot; \nDevilcat \n&gt; &gt; points out.  &quot;But harsh experience has taught me never to \ndiscount an \n&gt; &gt; opposing force, no matter how weak it may seem.  If we focus all \nour \n&gt; &gt; attention on the Tripredacus forces, Hydras is free to strike as \nhe \n&gt; &gt; chooses.  And I know from doing it myself how devastating that \ntactic \n&gt; &gt; is when done properly.
