All she had wanted was a meal and now she was \npined in, \n&gt; now=\r\nhere to go but fight her way though. And she was vastly \noutnumbered as \n&gt; =\r\nwell.\n&gt; Rage roared/whined as she swung her body away from the directions \n=\r\nthe damage \n&gt; was coming from, only to swing into the direction which anoth=\r\ner bot \nwas \n&gt; charging her at(Hurricane) but also managed to get a few of =\r\nthe 25 \nshots \n&gt; Treadshot had aimed towards her as well.\n&gt; She backed up a=\r\n few steps to avoid the charging bot but then was \nblown onto \n&gt; her side f=\r\nrom the amo sent towards her from Treadshot.\n&gt; Rage landed hard onto her si=\r\nde, a wave of dirt billowing up as she \nslid a \n&gt; few feet, giving off a su=\r\nrprised, pained and raged roar.\n&gt; She lay there for a second before she hea=\r\nved her great body once to \ntry and \n&gt; stand, finding that she hadn&#39;t succe=\r\neded she tried again and \nmanaged to \n&gt; right herself. Her body low and sup=\r\nporting her weight with her \nfront limbs, \n&gt; looking towards her attackers.=\r\n\n&gt; She had to get away, and quickly=85before they managed to kill\nher.\n&gt; Ra=\r\nge just began to turn and head towards the forest line when she \nwas \n&gt; sud=\r\ndenly hit in the right side by a crimson beam(His), but \nabsorbing the \n&gt; i=\r\nmpact of the blow with all of her limbs.\n&gt; By now she was completely torn, =\r\nmech-fluid flowing everywhere and \nwires \n&gt; hanging from her sides.\n&gt; But n=\r\now she had more of a need to get away then ever, snapping her \nbody \n&gt; towa=\r\nrds the forest again, and began heading towards it at a dead \nrun.\n&gt; All th=\r\nat was in her mind was that she had to get away, had to get \naway!!\n&gt; She w=\r\nas almost there when something chilly suddenly struck her head \nand \n&gt; some=\r\nthing painful hit her legs at the same time, tipping her over \nand snout \n&gt;=\r\n first into the dirt.\n&gt; Her head was frozen, and she was unable to open her=\r\n mouth to give a \nroar of \n&gt; protest as dirt flew up and her body crashed t=\r\no earth.\n&gt; The only thing which stopped her body from sliding was the fact =\r\n\nthat it had \n&gt; collided into a tree, knocking the trunk of it over and cra=\r\nshing \nacross her \n&gt; body, pinning it.\n&gt; Rage struggled weakly under the we=\r\night of the tree, but soon her \nstruggling \n&gt; became weak quivers and movem=\r\nents of her muscles.\n&gt; There was no escape!:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n________________________=\r\n______________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free=\r\n E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information=\r\n about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.c=\r\nom.\n\n\n"}}
