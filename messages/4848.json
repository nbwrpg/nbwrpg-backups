She had heard Bronco�s transmission and knew that NOW was the time to act. She couldn�t wait for Striker or any others, she had to go NOW.\nWith a growl and a short nod to Tavtron she then began to run towards the position where Bronco was, the life of Octociz in her hands. But what worried her was that if she gave him the comp she would not be able to get the other bot back. How could she be garonteed that he would o what he said and hand him over to her?\nThat was the problem�she had no garontee�just her gut instincts.\nIron Raptor ran as quickly as her legs would permit, having less then a mega-cycle to get there, there was no time to waste!\nIt wasn�t long until the cliff came into sight and so did Bronco, she slowed to a jog as she then came up to the enemy in question.\nShe glared at him for a min before she looked around for Octociz�s shell, she wanted him alive�but she needed him whole as well.\nIron Raptor looked back at Bronco for a moment and then gave a silent command to transform. Now in her robot mode she reached into her leg compartment and took out the computer.\nShe looked at Bronco.*\n\n� Well, here it is. The comp that you asked for. No strings, nothing.�\n\n*She then looked at the comp but then kept it in her hand, tighening the grip on it.*\n\n� But I need Octociz�s spark first. There�s no bot here other then me so there�s no reason why you shouldn�t.�\n\n* She waited for Bronco�s reply.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
