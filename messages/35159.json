St. Hilary, \nthe place where the Ark crashed and was revived four million years later.  At \nleast, according to real history.  But now the Ark was on Luna.  So, who knew \nhow history was going to change.  It would though.  There was absolutely no \nway the Cybertronians could completely fix it.\n\nDemon Wulf gave a sick smile.  And there was no way he would let them even \ntry to fix it.  He looked back to his brethren.\n\n&quot;We will rest, and save up strength in our craft that lies in the core of \nthis mountain structure.  My brethren, when we awake, with a renewed vigour \nwe will crush all Cybertronians.&quot;\n\n===\n\nMeanwhile, in Brazil, South America, the three bounty hunters awaited their \ncraft at the site where they had originally been dropped off and then \nproceeded to kill Savanah and Spitfire.\n\nOr at least that&#39;s what Imprisoner thought there names were.  They were just \ntwo faceless Maximal pieces of trash to him.\n\n&quot;When will our ship get here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, about twenty-eight mega-cycles.&quot;\n\n&quot;Great.&quot; Predator replied.  &quot;Good job Choran, you could&#39;ve at least told us \nbeforehand so we&#39;d have a base to stay in.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up the both of you!  They probably wouldn&#39;t have let us leave anyway.  \nLet&#39;s just sit here and wait.&quot;\n\n"}}
