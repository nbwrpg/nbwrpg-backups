He did not wish to\nlet the=\r\n others discuss, merely to let them know. He signaled for the\nrecording to =\r\nbegin.\n\nJotunn: My fellow Lords, I am sure that by now you are beginning to=\r\n\nrealize what is going on. My forces have paralyzed most Governmental\narmy =\r\noutposts and, by now, have attacked the Parliament Building in\nRelay. That =\r\nattack has been thwarted, thanks to one of you&#39;s valiant\nefforts. However, =\r\nI must let you know: this is not the last of the\nIron Skulls&#39; actions.\n\nJot=\r\nunn: You might wonder at my motives. Perhaps you are starting to\ncategorize=\r\n me with Starscream or one of the Megatrons... Let me make\none thing clear:=\r\n I am not them. My objectives never were and never\nwill be anything else th=\r\nan stones on the path to the destruction of\nthe Minions and their Master. B=\r\ny seizing the power from the\nGovernment, I ensure two things: a focused vis=\r\nion as to the fight\nbefore us and a certainty that things will get done. Th=\r\ne Government\nwas only a way for us to avert our eyes from the hard, cold tr=\r\nuth: we\nare losing a war that will ultimately extinguish our sparks should =\r\nwe\ngo on like this.\n\nJotunn: I do not care if you hate me or want to destro=\r\ny me. With what\nI am doing, you might have the leisure to do so for a long =\r\ntime now=AD.\n\nHe cut the communication and ordered the message sent to the =\r\nother\nLords...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jotunn entered the underground base with a fierce determination tha=\r\nt\n&gt; unsettled even the local Garison Commander. He had been prepared to\n&gt; w=\r\nelcome his Lord, but he had not been prepared for the Lord&#39;s actual\n&gt; rejec=\r\ntion of the welcome party. Jotunn was here on business. That was\n&gt; as simpl=\r\ne as it could get.\n&gt; \n&gt; He got up on an elevator and descended further in t=\r\nhe hidden fortress.\n&gt; He had not planned to actually take the Parliament wi=\r\nth Wave 1. That,\n&gt; even with the best estimates, would have been wishful th=\r\ninking, and he\n&gt; had not survived for so long as he had on wishful thinking=\r\n. Wave 2,\n&gt; however, would show his supremacy undeniably.\n&gt; \n&gt; The elevator=\r\n stopped in front of the largest door ever seen. It was\n&gt; conceived to with=\r\nstand the worst Minions could pack. This was a place\n&gt; of the utmost securi=\r\nty and the greatest importance. He waited for the\n&gt; security lock to scan h=\r\nis energy signature and the door to open with a\n&gt; very low rumble and a con=\r\nstant shuddering. He stepped in...\n&gt; \n&gt; ...only to find the Airtankers goin=\r\ng at each other with a card game.\n&gt; \n&gt; - I say, Bombtube, that was quite a =\r\nnice bluff there. Too bad I had\n&gt; the better hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Don&#39; make me laug=\r\nh, Gunrain! I shoulda been mo careful: you can&#39;\n&gt; lie! Ther&#39; was somfin you=\r\n were up to!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Stop bickering, you two! You only got lucky for now! Lo=\r\nck-on, girl!\n&gt; Start shuffling better!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Blaming me for your loss, Mot=\r\nherload? Yet we all know Skysword&#39;s the\n&gt; biggest cheater here!\n&gt; \n&gt; Jotunn=\r\n took out a pistol and fired once. The shot rang out in the\n&gt; hangar and th=\r\ne bullet finally ended by shooting through the deck of\n&gt; cards. The Airtank=\r\ners immediately pulled out their weapons and aimed\n&gt; at the door. Once they=\r\n realized who was there, they quickly put it all\n&gt; away and stood at attent=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jotunn: Well, is this how you get ready? I believe I told the\n&gt; C=\r\nommander to have you ready to set out as soon as I got here. Has that\n&gt; not=\r\n been done?\n&gt; \n&gt; Motherload: My Lord, with all due respect, we are posted i=\r\nn that\n&gt; weakling&#39;s base, but he has no power over us. He fears us and thus=\r\n has\n&gt; no basis on which he can give us orders. We answer to you only.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Jotunn: And was it not mentioned to you I gave the order? Do not mock\n&gt; me=\r\n Motherload; you&#39;re smarter than that. You know only I command you\n&gt; and wo=\r\nuld dare issue your orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skysword: And what would be your orders no=\r\nw, O Lord?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jotunn: Stand by for two cycles. Review your weaponry. I ha=\r\nve to\n&gt; communicate with my fellow lords, but should their answer be...\n&gt; u=\r\nnsatisfactory, we head out.\n&gt; \n&gt; A grin came across Skysword&#39;s faceplate.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Skysword: =AD&quot;We&quot;, Lord?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jotunn: Yes... Me too.\n&gt; \n&gt; He left them =\r\nthere, had the door closed up, and went back to the\n&gt; command center near t=\r\nhe frozen surface.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
