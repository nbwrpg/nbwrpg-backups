You use that \nbomb of yours and we are all dead. I value the lives of my team more \nthan my hurt pride in the matter. Second, You seam to be very good at \nwhat you do. I wish to be allies instead of enemies. But, if you wish \nnot to be allies, then after you have left my ship, we will be \nenemies. But I gave my word. And I must keep it. Honor demands it. No \nmatter how I feel about it later, I must keep my word. Even now. yes \nI wouldn&#39;t mind turning you into scrap for what you did to my ship, \nbut my word is binding. I can not go back on it.&quot;\n\nShe waited. She knew no matter how the others would feel about this, \nshe had to keep her promise and release this fox. \n\n&quot;Now please, I have many things to deal with. Come out, and I will \nwalk you out of my base. I wish no more damage. And I don&#39;t want to \nget blown up. So stick to my side and I shall make sure you get out. \nDo you understand? Please come out and then leave my ship. As I said, \nI value the lives of my pack. And I don&#39;t want to get blown to the \npit myself either.&quot; \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; KitKats offer sounded to good to be true, he comes into her base, \n&gt; steals genetic material, damages her home and she lets him walk \nout? \n&gt; There was something about KitKat that he didn&#39;t trust. He had to \n&gt; admit that for a Predacon &quot;B&quot; um I mean Witch she was atractive. He \n&gt; just didn&#39;t want to be fooled by another pretty face. &quot;You want to \n&gt; know why I broke in here? I don&#39;t even know that, It&#39;s my function, \n&gt; It&#39;s what I do.&quot; he knew that Name Function and online date were \nthe \n&gt; three things a POW could offer. &quot;Now what makes me so special that \n&gt; you&#39;d go so far out of your way to track me down just to let me go \n&gt; again?&quot; He wasn&#39;t used to the offer she was making him. He wanted \nto \n&gt; go free but he wanted to know why she was being such a nice puppy.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
