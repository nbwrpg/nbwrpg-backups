I admit the part that I have with and I feel that I \nhave to =\r\ncare more of this RPG. In order to improve our situation \nhere, I have foll=\r\now suggestion in order to keep things running:\n\n1. If a player is waitting =\r\nan answer for another player and that \nanswer didnt come, I strongly sugges=\r\nt that you char focus in another \nplayer.\n\n2. In case that your char is stu=\r\nck in a situation, move him/her in \norder to you can interac with actives o=\r\nr more receptives players.\n\n\nAlso Stac suggest follow:\n\n3. If somoene is go=\r\ning to be involved, they need to make that \ncommitment to post on a regular=\r\n basis. \n\n4.  Players at least are active and post at least once a day to k=\r\neep \nthe story moving and not leave other players who are involved in the \n=\r\ndark and in hiatus... \n\nI Know that above is not always posible, but I sugg=\r\nest that you try \nto post at least once x day or not be so absent for so lo=\r\nng.\n\n\nAs Stac says &quot;When I get involved, I get involved&quot;.\n\n\nI also  want to=\r\n admit that I dont get so involved lately and I want \nto be the first one t=\r\no be involved again in this RPG. Who is with me? \nWho has a comment?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
