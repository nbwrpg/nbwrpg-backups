It could be compared to ancient \nfeudal markets on Earth from 500 AD to 1500 AD.\n\nAfter exiting the civilian area, it is clear that it is a more militarized \nzone, cameras, laser turrets, and troops being numerous.  Stopping at large \ngates that looked like potcullises the soldiers waited as every single of the \nnumerous ones were opening.\n\nNames were above each one.  From Ares to Daemos to Hot Rod, every entree of \nRound One&#39;s name was above where the portcullises had been.\n\n&quot;Please find your name and enter through.&quot;\n\n"}}
