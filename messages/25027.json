She looked like she had alot on her shoulders. Snow Tech turned to \nShadow Cat, cocks an eyebrow and smiles.*\n\n&quot; No, not at all. We are NOT going to screw up anything! NO, we are not \ngoing to help her. She is quite able to handle herself. Now sit and \nbehave!!&quot;\n\n* The threat was quite real and she had the power to back it up. But Snow \nTech was unable to realize that and looked up at her with big green eyes and \nwith a baby voice said:*\n\n&quot; Pweeze?&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat was ready to hit him, but she contained her anger and wispered \nfiercly to him,*\n\n&quot; Not a magot-ridden chance!&quot;\n\n*Snow Tech hung his head and moped. With his index finger he made swirly \nshapes with his finger. Shadow Cat sighed and looked at him.*\n\n&quot; Why would you wantto?&quot;\n\n* Snow tech replies with the same baby voice.*\n\n&quot; &quot;cause i wanna kiwl someone!&quot;\n\n  *Shadow Cat growls and turns away and mutters.*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t ask me, ask IR!&quot;\n\n*Snow Tech looks up with his eyes a-glow. He smiles and pats her on the back \nand says*\n\n&quot; I knew you&#39;d see it my way!!&quot;\n\n*Then, without warning, he stands up and shouts to Iron Raptor who is across \nthe feild,*\n\n&quot; YO! IR!! CAN I HELP? HUH? HUH?&quot;\n\n*Shadow Cat slaps her forehead and mutters, &quot;We&#39;re dead!&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
