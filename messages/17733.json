She kept her jaw locked around Striker&#39;s leg. \nhe&#39;s have to cut her head off and surgically remove her jaws off \nhim.  She knew she was dyinig. She could feel her body and spark \ngiving out. She left one message to Ramulus thought the internal \ncomputer links,&quot;Till all are one.&quot;  She then closed her eyes and \nwaited for the final blows to come. She found it strange though, she \ncould no longer feel the pain or her body, but she could taste the \nmech fluid in her mouth. She held on, hoping it would be over soon.\n\n\n"}}
