Iron Raptor looked back and saw what she had struck, she gasped is surprise as she saw that it was Prowl! It was then that she saw Annihalator shot him in the Stomach, he had obviously dodged out of the way and had caused her to strike Prowl instead. She growled deeply, the adrenaline was beginning to rise and her muscles were beginning to tense. She was sick of it all! And to add to her anger she soon felt the charges from Killer begin to hit her, her head snapped towards him but she was so engulfed in rage that she simply didn&#39;t care.\nIron Raptor swung her body around to face Annihalator and Prowl but with her tail she began to beat at the trees, her tail swung right and left...snapping tree&#39;s trunks and hearing them begin to fall. Like one massive chain saw that ate away at the forest, and she did all this right above Killer&#39;s head! Bark and wood chips flew everywhere as trees began to fall and tumble around and down on Killer, only a matter of seconds until they eventually crushed him!\nIron Raptor then snapped and snarled at Annihalator, her shoulders bunched and then released as her head shot straight for him. Her jaws weren&#39;t open for the reason that she meant to shove him out of the way and away from Prowl. One of her clawed hands came down in front of Prowl, separating him from his attacker.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
