Sky shadow,  make a search parties and they have to seach\n&gt; in groups, no body will go alone and by now leave the maximals alone, we\n&gt; dont need any futher complication, I want that you left the strongest\n&gt; warriors to protect the base; and who are the skillest techniquians that we\n&gt; have after Cyclonus?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKY SHADOW smiled as he noted that HYDRAS was looking to him to help\nwith decisions. &quot;Well let&#39;s see. Fractyl is probrably one of your\nbetter technicians, since he is more trust worthy. But then again\nTarrantulus is also good - better than Fractyl, but he seems to always\nhave his own agenda.&quot;\n\nAs they talked SCOURGE came in loking around, his face in that scowl\nhe always seem to have. &quot;Hydras. I have word from the sweeps I sent\nafter Cyclonus.&quot;\n\nSCOURGE cme to a stop in front of HYDRAS and although he stood a foot\nor two smaller than he did and had to look up in order to look HYDRAS\nin the optic there seemed to be no fear in him. &quot;They traced down the\npath that Cyclonuns and Rodimus took following back the Earth beast&#39;s\ntrail. They have not found either of them yet but the sweeps have run\ninto an area were communication is lost. They don&#39;t know hoe large it\nis but if they travel any further they will no longer be able to\nrecieve or send any messages to us.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
