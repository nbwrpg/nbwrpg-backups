However its focus once again was focused on the base that \nwas in front of it.\n\nGemini Dragon: &quot;Bah... water will not stop my flames. It is time to \nblast you all to smithereins!&quot;\n\nAnd with those words Gemini Dragon prepared to unleash another \namphobois attack. However unline the last time when the right head \nopened only smoke came out, and the left head only shot a cloud of \nmist. The tail also sizzling slightly. Not knowing what was wrong the \nbeast ran a quick diagnostic and found that the last amphobois attack \nhad drained the gestalts power reserves to depletion, and the last \nice beam and fire breath just drained its reserves completely. Upon \nthis realization the dragon sweat dropped. Before flapping its giant \nwings and beginning to fly away.\n\nGemini Dragon: &quot;Eh heh.... Illbe back for you just as soon as I get \nmore energy I&#39;ll be back to destroy you all!&quot;\n\nThe beast screeched out loudly as it made all ten of the remaining \nfunnels disenegrate into ash to hopefully cover its escape.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Seekker was hit directly by the ice beam sending the bot flying \n&gt; through the air back the way he had come.  &quot;ICCEEE \n&gt; CREEAAMM...The ICE CREAM MAN IS COMING!!!!&quot; Seekker \n&gt; yelled out as he hit the ground, icecles hangin off his bodily \nparts.  \n&gt; Getting up he tried to walk but his leg shielding shattered leaving \n&gt; only his circtutry and hydraulic parts out.  &quot;Oh my, look at me, \nI&#39;m \n&gt; unnaprotpiate&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The vines surrounding the Chivtron base where the flame hit burnt \n&gt; away, before new ones came in.  Slowly the vines began to release \n&gt; a mist of pure water.\n\n\n"}}
