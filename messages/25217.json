I just want to go on record saying I do \nnot think that of anyone, especially Yan, Ks, Jp, etc. They&#39;re the backbone \nof NBW, without them there wouldn&#39;t even be a NBW RPG.)\n\nHysteria/Tavatron\n\nHysteria:\n\nThere, now all she needed to do was enter the final code and the shields \nwould reactivate and whatever outer weapons remained would power up. Well, \neither that or the engine core would explode. She opened a comm to IR:\n\n&quot;Uh, commander I suppose, should I attempt to repower the shields or allow \nthe two aproaching Alliance &#39;bots to enter the bridge?&quot;\n\nThe scanners had picked up two new &#39;bots flying straight for the CF&#39;s \nexposed bridge. She had to do something, but if she was ordered to do \nnothing... well, all she could do was hope it wouldn&#39;t come to that.\n\nTavatron:\n\nTavatron&#39;s scanners registered Dinobot nearby, only a few meters away in \nfact, but she did nothing to acknowledge his presence other than continue \nbacking up toward Iron Raptor. Now was not the time for plesantries. \nSomething was obviously amiss here. The Alliance did not give up so readily, \nof that she was sure. She stood her ground beside Iron Raptor, her staff \nstill held beside her. She turned to face FZ and despretely tried to fight \nthe urge to rip him apart. (Nuthin&#39; personal, just some anti-FZ feelings for \nya^_^)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
