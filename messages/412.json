The Predacon fliers had ambushed Dinobot into a trap, then she was sent off to do her impressions, remaining in beast mode through the whole time. Her beast mode was perfect, and she could get his voice just right. She was sent to the Maximal&#39;s base to steal information. The Maximals were surly surprised and mad that the Dinobot that they were comming in contact with was actually Dinobot. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw thought if this was really a good idea. All this raptor was going to do is brag about Dinobot and threathen her. Cyber Claw didn&#39;t take threats every lightly. She had been threathened most of her on-line life. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
