I would have\nto let these NPC&#39;s I control fade back into the background of the moon,\nand just keep Myrmidon active. I have no problem with that, but I think\nwe have a few folks intent on hitting the moon with some serious\nfirepower. :)\n\nPreston\n\n--- Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; How many members here would be interested in starting a sister RPG to\n&gt; branch off of NBW? Sometime ago I started the story arc of having a\n&gt; third Great War break out on Cybertron between the Maximals and\n&gt; Predacons as well as any remaining Autobots and Decepticons. Plus\n&gt; there is the G2 Decepticons attacking future Earth. I figure we could\n&gt; do a RPG set in either of these battles. This would allow for new\n&gt; characters to be created and bring the NBW universe to a wider scale.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I like the idea of having it mostly based on Cybertron with maybe\n&gt; little threads branching off to the G2 conflict on Earth.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I would put the RPG on Yahoo groups and have it run the exact same\n&gt; way as NBW.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   So get back to me. Who wants the Neo Cybertron Wars RPG?\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
