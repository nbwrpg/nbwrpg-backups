But now I may \nhave a \n&gt; reason to reactivate Carnage, if Teltoli h=\r\nas not already found \nenough new \n&gt; friends?\n&gt; But, if you still want the o=\r\nld ones=85.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ** There was no point in moving from her spot to chase af=\r\nter some \nstupid \n&gt; stasis pod, it would only mean a plus sign in the popul=\r\nation number \nof \n&gt; whatever faction got there first.\n&gt; Carnage rolled over=\r\n lazily onto her other side, remembering seeing \nthat pod \n&gt; steak in from =\r\nthe sky and crash less then a click away. But the sun \nwas high \n&gt; and warm=\r\n and she had no intention on leaving the outcrop half way \nup the \n&gt; side o=\r\nf a cliff that she had spotted out and parked herself for the \n&gt; afternoon.=\r\n\n&gt; Her body was soaking up the heat as a sponge did water, and it felt \n&gt; w=\r\nonderful.\n&gt; \n&gt; It had been a while since she had had any contact with any o=\r\nf the \nrobotic \n&gt; factions which came around this dust ball of a planet=85a=\r\nlthough she \nhad kept \n&gt; updated on everything.\n&gt; Maximals had a new base a=\r\nnd leader.\n&gt; The Ark was scrap.\n&gt; Predacons were supposedly staging an atta=\r\nck.\n&gt; And the Alliance base had relocated.\n&gt; Oh course, nothing that concer=\r\nned her since she didn&#39;t belong to a \nfaction. \n&gt; And life as a solitary as=\r\nsassin wasn&#39;t all that bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carnage opened her mouth and yawned wide, =\r\nmaking a small sound \nwhich might \n&gt; be heard as cute before her jaws snapp=\r\ned shut again. Stretching out \nher arms \n&gt; and shoulders, that her fingers =\r\nat the end of her hands. Next were \nher legs \n&gt; and thigh muscles, feet and=\r\n toes. Back, neck, and finally her tail, \n&gt; stretching out straight behind =\r\nher.\n&gt; But then she simply moved her head so that the bottom of her jaw \nwa=\r\ns laying \n&gt; against the edge of the cliff, looking lazily out onto the plai=\r\nns \nwhile her \n&gt; body remained on it&#39;s side. Her lazy eyes looking towards =\r\nthe crash \nsite of \n&gt; the stasis pod or where it should be located.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sh=\r\ne remembered that it had been a while ago, almost a year, that \nshe had set=\r\n \n&gt; out towards the snow-capped hills after her friend Teltoli had \ndisappe=\r\nared. \n&gt; Maybe she had been looking for something in her sadness, never \nsh=\r\nowing it, \n&gt; but all she had found was frostbite!\n&gt; So, she had returned to=\r\n the warmer climates; raptors weren&#39;t made \nfor snow \n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; And here =\r\nshe was now, no better off then she had been after Dinobot \nhad \n&gt; died.\n&gt; =\r\nAlone, lonely, board, even at times=85depressed.\n&gt; To the Pit! She still mi=\r\nssed him!\n&gt; It had been a long time since he had passed away and still the =\r\npain \nwas \n&gt; deep. But what else could she hope to feel when something like=\r\n that \nhit so \n&gt; close to the spark?\n&gt; \n&gt; Carnage rolled over onto her back=\r\n, looking up into the great blue \nyonder, \n&gt; the occasional cloud coming in=\r\nto view.\n&gt; She remembered=85everything.\n&gt; After her friend&#39;s death she had =\r\ndisappeared from the Predacon all \ntogether, \n&gt; sinking into the swamps as =\r\nwell as she had into her sadness. From \nthen on \n&gt; they had been her home, =\r\ndrifting among the mists like a deep \nshadow. Their \n&gt; dark and deep atmosp=\r\nhere feeding her sorrow until there was nothing \nleft. \n&gt; Paling her comple=\r\nxion until there was nothing but dull grays and \nbrowns.\n&gt; But then=85one e=\r\nvening a pod landed just beyond her swamp, holding \nsomething \n&gt; that had c=\r\nhanged her life=85for a time.\n&gt; Carnage sighed.\n&gt; She lost all of her frien=\r\nds, one way or another.\n&gt; The thought of being alone causing her to feel a =\r\nstab of inner pain \nwithin \n&gt; her spark. Also feeling a bit of betrayed at =\r\nbeing left alone like \nthis, \n&gt; making it so that she no longer trusted. Bu=\r\nt these feelings didn&#39;t \nmake her \n&gt; sad, only regret.\n&gt; Regret having anyo=\r\nne to care for in the first place.\n&gt; But since Teltoli&#39;s disappearance she =\r\nhad leaned not to trust \nagain, \n&gt; becoming her old hard self.\n&gt; : I could =\r\neven almost chill Dinobot, if he was alive.:\n&gt; Another stab of regret.\n&gt; Ca=\r\nrnage growled and flopped onto her side again, moving so that she \nwas \n&gt; f=\r\nacing the rock wall and turned her back on the plains as well as \nthe rest =\r\n\n&gt; of the world.\n&gt; : Who needs `em?!:\n&gt; Muttering to herself in a grumpy to=\r\nne, one only she could hear.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Life&#39;s a bitch and then `ya die!&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_=\r\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.=\r\ncom.\n\n\n"}}
