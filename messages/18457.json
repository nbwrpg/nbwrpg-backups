Archangle had taken Trinity from the pod and taken her back \nto the Cybertron Fire.  He had her in the hallway and was telling her \nthat he would help her find her parents. But her family was all \nkilled in the ship crash, but Koj and Archangle don&#39;t know that for \nsure.  Koj just told her that her parents may still be alive and she \nis currently jumping around and all happy and stuff thinking that her \nfamily may still be alive.  But they would have to go tothe wreckage \nof the ship to know for sure.)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Alloran2@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sure, whats Arcangel doing at this moment?\n&gt; \n&gt; :::Ratchet:::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::He walks down from his work satisfied for now::\n&gt; Ratchet: Hey Ramulus!
