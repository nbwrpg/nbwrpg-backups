Oh, and Oblitertron is no where near the Ark. He&#39;s\n&gt; almost right next to the Alliance base. Do you want to rewrite your\n&gt; post, or did your chars fly to the Alliance base in one post?\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Ramulus::\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus&#39; eyes narrow as Prebon flies off. That was strange... Very\n&gt; strange, indeed. Prebon seemed to be almost desperate to give up\n&gt; Spears, and he would probably have known that he wasn&#39;t worth Striker\n&gt; in the first place. Ramulus frowns, a plan forming in his mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lost in thought, it takes Ramulus a few seconds to realize Brix was\n&gt; adressing him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wha?&quot; he says, shaking out of his trance, &quot;No, we don&#39;t go attack.\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a better idea.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He walks back to the remaining functional computer panel, inserting a\n&gt; disk and downloading the results of the chip scans. He turns to look\n&gt; at Brix and Fliq.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You two stay here in case of an attack. I got to take care of\n&gt; something.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus transforms into beast mode, galloping off at full speed for\n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
