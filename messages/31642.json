He was going to fast for\nthe other shots to hit. He growls, looking around the battle. The\nDecepticons were seriously outnumbered.\n\nActivating his comm to request assistance from Megatron, Autofire is\nmet with only static. He frowns, trying to contact any of the\nDecepticons there and resulting in more static. Deactivating his comm,\nAutofire angles up, firing two missiles at the Supernova/Scrap/Slasys jet.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jen D.&quot; &lt;jeniff@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (ooc: I&#39;m not good at battles, so sorry if this is confusing :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyndro&#39;s scanners detected weaponfire outside the Element, and\nquickly made\n&gt; a scan to find out who the attackers were. Soon he knew the location\nand\n&gt; weaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re under\nattack.&quot;\n&gt; he says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs out of the\n&gt; base. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then activates the\n&gt; defences.\n&gt;\n&gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, and then a\n&gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other than\nthe ones\n&gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the screech shut\noff, and\n&gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications that the\nenemies\n&gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the Element\nfired at\n&gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one missile,\nand\n&gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were\nshielded by the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one shielded :).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was immediately\nready\n&gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. A\nmissile flew\n&gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to hit\n&gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could see Aqua\nfiring\n&gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried to get\nduring\n&gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped that she\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then we&#39;ll form\n&gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his team over the\n&gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his missile\nlauncher\n&gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, firing three\n&gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
