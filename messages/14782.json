And if he didn&#39;t, they would win.  And he wouldn&#39;t let that\nhappen.  He didn&#39;t need to be in the useless bunch of Predacons.  He fired\nhis shoulder plasma cannons at Phobia&#39;s ship.  To escape the explosion, and\nany returning fire, he went beast mode, and underground back to his lair.\nGood.  Hell Drak was still where she was supposed to be.

Deemos stares at a eerie glow. Atma points\nto\n&gt; the ground, a light engulfs them both and blasts them both away, Psuedo\nwas\n&gt; also damaged by this.
