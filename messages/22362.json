When Gabriel planted the bomb on what \nhe thought was Amperion&#39;s back he dropped the piece of wood.  He \nnever expected that Gabriel would be stupid enough to detonate it \nbefore he got himself out of range.  Unfortunately he did.  The blast \ncaught Amperion full in the back charring his entire back to a crisp \nblackened state (think over cooked steak) fortunately for him there \nwasn&#39;t a tree as close by and he managed to turn around before \ncrashing again.  He landed, impaired but still battle worthy, and \ntook off at a run at Savior.  He is driven solely by rage and his \nalready formidable fighting skills are even better.  He unleashes a \nseires of slashes that the even the best swordsman would be hard-\npressed to dodge or block.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  The bots dodged the fire. Gabriel took a shot to the leg. It was \nminor \n&gt; damage nothing serious. He dove down and pulled out another bomb. \nHe inhanced \n&gt; its power and planted it on the bot&#39;s back while savior distracted \nhim with \n&gt; fire energy blast. He pressed the button. He was too close so he \nwould gain \n&gt; damage from the explosion. He heard the bomb and was tossed to the \ntree and  \n&gt; he struggled to get up.\n\n\n"}}
