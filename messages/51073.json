But if you&#39;re using Dragon Ball Z as an example, ( I \nsaid IF, I am not accusing) in Japan they called them &quot;Artificial \nHuman&quot; instead of androids. Keeping in mind that the English versions \nare extremely stupid, I wouldn&#39;t trust those suckas. I myself would \nclassify the characters like 17 and 18 of DBZ as cyborgs. King of like \nin The Terminator, except they feel pain where the terminator didn&#39;t. \nGeez, man, why did Dr. Gero make his machines feel pain?
