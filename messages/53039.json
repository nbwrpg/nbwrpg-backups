Unlike much of the ship, it looks entirely Cybertronian.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noir is already there.

Computer, replay visual \n&gt; from the arrival of the newest ship.&quot;  A holo-field pops up, \n&gt; displaying the Tripredacus cruiser as it came in for a landing some \n&gt; time ago.

Our ship is a distinctive one and \n&gt; has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connected officially with dozens of terrorist acts, including \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction of some important Tripredacus outposts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat considers for a moment.  Activating his comlink, he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; issues a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; command to the Rogues: &quot;Everyone meet me in the command \n&gt; center - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stat!

Seems like a warship \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since it&#39;s new, they might well have lots more where they \n&gt; come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That means they&#39;re not alone. As for personel, I can&#39;t say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fought Tripreds. But they might be elite, or they might be \n&gt; green\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies that have been placed there to man the ship. \n&gt; However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rookies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could not have landed the ship as successfully as they just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is something else. The survivors of the first group \n&gt; probably \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to observe things here and I am convinced that they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence on most people here. The newcomers now have \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; edge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frontal assault is totally out of question.\n\n\n"}}
