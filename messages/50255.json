Katya drops, evading the punches with her small \nsize. She counters with two glancing punches and a kick aimed at his \nhead.\n\nRagnar, near Rodimus, sees that he is uneasy about this.\n\nRagnar: Do not worry, Rodimus. You have to understand that we Clan \nwarriors are very proud. We will never follow someone who has not \nproven himself, for this could demonstrate weakness. A weak warrior is \nnot a good leader. (He turns to look at Rodimus) But this Owlhawk... \nhe is strong. He does lack a bit of self-control, but stepped in the \nways of the Clans, he would be a deadly one. Katya knows she is likely \nto lose, but this is more a formality. We will follow the Maximals.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime/Owlhawk::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus really didn&#39;t like this idea, but would go with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I dont think we really have to join or follow each other. Working \nas allies would be fine. However if you must do this, verywell. Go on \nOwlhawk.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Owlhawk steps out a bit with Katya. He puts his fists up and starts \nto move around a bit. A normal Maximal would probably wait for Katya \nto throw the first punch, but Owlhawk is a little bit different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Owlhawk sends two jabs at Katya&#39;s face.\n\n\n"}}
