The steady =\r\ndrone of the engines pushing the craft through the air was pretty much the =\r\nonly sound that could be heard for most of the trip. \n\nOh there was the occ=\r\nasional sporatic conversation, but by and large everyone was thinking over =\r\nwhat they knew of Cryonosis. \n\nAs they neared the Antarctic the ride began =\r\nto get a little more bumpy as the colder winds sent eddies and gusts their =\r\ndirection. However POLAR CLAW and PROWL in the front pilot seats seemed to =\r\nhave the whole thing under control. \n\n&quot;There she is.&quot; POLAR CLAW said, brea=\r\nking the silence in the cabin. A cabin viewscreen came online showing the s=\r\nhuttle passing over the many iceflows and coming onto the mainland itself. =\r\n\n\nIn the distance, was a stoutly built tower standing up like a spike, surr=\r\nounded on nearly all sides by white mountains built of ice and stone, surro=\r\nnding the tower like a natually built wall. Inside this &#39;wall&#39; was a large =\r\niced blue lake its wateres also stretching around the tower like a moat. \n\n=\r\nThe place looked isolated, cold and remote and yet strangely bueatiful all =\r\nat the same time. \n\n&quot;All right we are going in, stay frosty.&quot; POLAR CLAW sa=\r\nid. &quot;We still don&#39;t know what or who is here, but I am getting strange read=\r\nings. It&#39;s almost as if . . . &quot;\n\nThen the tower seemed to turn as weapon mo=\r\nunts began to unfold. \n\n*THOOM*  *THOOM*  *THOOM*\n\n&quot;It looks as if someone =\r\nis already here.&quot; PROWL said as the tower opened fire on the shuttle. The s=\r\nhuttle banked and turned and then bucked as it took a hit, and then another=\r\n. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
