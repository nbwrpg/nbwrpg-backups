This is \nconcerning our biggest security threat right now,no, not Deemos, but \nTrinity.  She must be trained immediatly to know how to fight, and \ntake care of herself.  She is being held back and that takes our \nattention in a fight.  Second threat is this Deemos.  Now, Sarge. I \nsay our best chance of survival against him and his growing army is a \nsurprise attack.  I would like you to devise a team, and I will show \nyou my plan.  Now Windlord, Aerotaur, and Axis.  Would you accompany \nto meet with the Cybers.\n\nHe opened a commlink to the Cybers.  &quot;This is Grounded, Defense \nCommander of the Chivtron faction.  We would like a meeting with \nyou.  I am patching through a point where we shall meet.  (today&#39;s \niceland.)  22-45-78594. Please meet us there.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
