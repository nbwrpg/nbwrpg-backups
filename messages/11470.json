It hit the ground and\nskidded for several hundred feet before it finally\ncame to a halt. The pods DNA scanner launched to find\nan appropriate life form. &quot;DNA Sequencing complete&quot; it\nsaid after several minutes. Suddenly the pod opened\nand a Russian black bear emerged. The bear sniffed the\nair and surveyed the area for a moment. &quot;RebelYell,\nMaximize!&quot; Suddenly the bear transformed into a sleek\nblack robot.&quot;Sweet&quot; RebelYell said as he looked over\nhis new form. Soon his mind turned to more important\nmatters: finding out if there were more Maximals\nnearby and finding out where he was and why he was there.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
