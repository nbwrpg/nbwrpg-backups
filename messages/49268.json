His \n&gt; &gt; motricity was still awful, but the call of the\n&gt; battle and the \n&gt; mockery \n&gt; &gt; of those Tripredacus were too strong. He managed\n&gt; to stand up, but \n&gt; &gt; putting one leg in front of the other was\n&gt; impossible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warhead: If I can not stand, I will transform!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He went into his hovercraft mode, which was much\n&gt; more mobile. He \n&gt; made \n&gt; &gt; it out of the base and, seeing Spike, fired at him\n&gt; with machine \n&gt; guns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael saw Spike too and greeted him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: Whoever you are, you are welcome with us\n&gt; Tripredacus. Now \n&gt; &gt; fight with us!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As he said these words, he received fully\n&gt; Quickstrike&#39;s energy \n&gt; blast. \n&gt; &gt; He countered, after getting up, with two light\n&gt; blasts of his own.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: Very well, Megatron. We shall have it your\n&gt; way. Know this, \n&gt; &gt; though: the Dragon is a tough kill, but the\n&gt; Phoenix rises after \n&gt; dying! \n&gt; &gt; Now get out and fight me! Tripredacus! Attack now!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Burrock, on his side, avoided the rocket shot by\n&gt; Inferno, but not \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; much. He got fried a bit from the blast, but was\n&gt; otherwise alright.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Burrock: This sure beats those other absent\n&gt; clowns!
