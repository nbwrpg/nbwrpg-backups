She pinned her ears and widened her eyes. She saw vivid images of slaughtered horses. A whole herd. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She whinnied and reared on her hind legs, with her cloudly black mane flickering. There was something here. When she fought back with her images of herself, a horse transforming into a bot, a wild horse rearing against the sunset, enough to see the reality, enough to see that there was nothing in the field, she realized the danger. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She imaged her threatful wild roaring flames, louder than her past images. He bobbed her head. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;He&#39;s here! &lt;/EM&gt;she shouted into the air, to anyone who was near. She imaged Rowdy Wolf in alarm, the same bot that appeared in Quickstrike&#39;s mind. She remembered his warning to the others that Quickstrike relapsed to her. That, &lt;EM&gt;Go, get out of here! I&#39;ll deal with this thing! Go!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;She ran until she came to KitKat. She ran past her, shouting: &lt;EM&gt;He&#39;s here!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
