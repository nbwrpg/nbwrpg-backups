Tripod is rebelling whenever I \ntry to edit the site and with school, Taekuando, and the crapload of \nother things I have to do, I have trouble finding time to post, much \nless battle with Tripod.\n\nThe new site will run directly off my comp with my new super-fast \ninternet connection, and it&#39;ll be much more automatically updated, so \nI&#39;ll have alot less trouble getting it up to date.\n\nOh, and it&#39;ll look cooler.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, nbwrpg@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Enter your vote today!
