He turns to look up at \nOblitertron while reaching out with a hand to help Iron Raptor stand up, if \nshe was in a condition to do so.\n\n&quot;Zardus,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;Call your troops off. We are allied.&quot;\n\nZardus&#39; voice replies, tinged with amusement. &quot;The situation is out of my \ncontroll, Maximal. I must remind you, though: the Maximals had opened fire on \nmy troops first, now you Maximals can deal with the punishment.&quot;\n\nProwl looks up to see Zardus hovering in the air above him, using his jetpack \nto keep him in the air. The alliance leader was obvioustly enjoying this. \nProwl curses under his breath, looking back at Oblitertron. He hoped Iron \nRaptor would get up soon. It was much easier to get a standing bot out of the \nway of a shot than a laying one.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUp in the air, Zardus flies over to Nemesis Enfocer.\n\n&quot;If Oblitertron starts having trouble, we will land, weapons aimed at their \nbacks. Don&#39;t open fire unless they do, though, the Maximals will be usefull \nagainst Set and Shuko.&quot;\n\nZardus looks down at Perndabot, who is getting up, using a boulder for \nsupport, and relays the same orders to him.\n\n"}}
