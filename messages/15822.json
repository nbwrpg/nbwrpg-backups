She smiled. Thngs were \ngoing along nicely.  She went over to her  to her benchand put the \nfinal touches on the chips.  She smiled as she worked.  \n\nThe chips were designed and prgrammed to remain undetected untill \nactivation.  Once activated, the wearer of the chip would suddenly \nhavve thier programming switched from Maximal to Allience. And would \ngive the wearer tenancies to follow her untill they met Zardus.  Then \nthey would be under Zardus&#39; control. \n\nShe had only three chips made.  She would need more time to make \nmore. But she didn&#39;t mind.  Three chips would be enough to cause \ntrouble for the Maximals anyway.\n\n\n"}}
