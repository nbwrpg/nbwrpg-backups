I fear that they \nmight bring unwanted reinforcements against Rockseeker and Lunekill. \nI want you to disguise yourself and to infiltrate them. Whatever \nhappens, find out why they come, and destroy them once you have found \nout.\n\nBloodblade: I will do as you wish, Master. No one will even remember \nwho they were.\n\nThus, Bloodblade transformed into a crimson colored starfighter and \nflew to earth, planning how he would infiltrate the attackers.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Ray of Hope:\n&gt;    Is moving towards a Jupiter takeing the blows of tthe little \narmada of ships.
