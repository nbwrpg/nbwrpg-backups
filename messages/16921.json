I need him for two of my stories. \nSoulstice, are Atma Pseudo and Technosis going to fight too? And it \nmght have been Jericho, but not Gangrel. And I don&#39;t think they would \nhave Jericho do it, because he&#39;s too popular as a face. Test is kinda \nblond, so it was probably him. He did it cause he thought he would \ntake Austin&#39;s place in the title match, not Big Show.)\n\nVulois\n\nVulois could not believe this. Some of the bots had gone down in \npain, but the more powerful ones were destroying it with evil. It was \namazing. He noticed the main one. The one whom the others tried to \nprotect(Deemos). He needed to make a direct link with him, and that \nwould mean physical contact. Than he saw Child come, and go into \nstasis lock almost immediatly.\n\n&quot;Child! Not again!&quot; He commed to the base: &quot;Windrazor, Eagel Eye, \nAfterburner! We need back up! At the end of the main tunnel we&#39;re in \na battle! Child is down!&quot;\n\nThis distraction made the odds low to Vulois. The main boss was \npowering up an ultimate weapon. But he had to try. If he died in the \nprocess, Child would lead. He had heard me speak of Battera and \nCybershark, and he would contact them and inform them. But it looked \nlike peace is finally shattered. Only one last ditch attempt.\n\nVulois tried as best he could to dodge most of the firepower in an \nattempt to get at Deemos.\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon looked sternly at Spears.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not angry with you. You and I both know who he is, or who he \nwas. I&#39;m afraid that in your anger you could let something slip and \nhe will get curious. I want to make it clear that I made every \nattempt to keep the promise I made to you. He forced me to do this \nwhen he attacked me. I&#39;ll talk with Slayer about toning things with \nyou, but just be careful around him, okay? I don&#39;t want anything \nhappening to you.&quot; He kissed Spears. &quot;You may go now. I need to speak \nwith Slayer.&quot;\n\nPrebon walked back into the room and watched Slayer put it on.\n\n&quot;Excellent. I hope you like it, because you&#39;ll be putting it to use \nright away. Your first mission is to kill Ramulus!&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
