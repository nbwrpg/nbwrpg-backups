Nightlight moaned with pain.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras and Perceptor Screamed in pain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus Prime looked over at Tuscon and then at the others as the wave\n&gt; of sensation swept over him. He could see the jerks of pain from\n&gt; Scorponok and Darkhawk as they fell down in pain, while the Autobots\n&gt; and Maximals seemed to be struggling to hold back the laughter, and\n&gt; then he felt it too. it was a wave of warmth that seemed to vibrate at\n&gt; his relays, causing him to jerk slightly as he smiled and held himself\n&gt; silent.\n&gt;\n&gt; However something was different with Scourge. He felt the wave pass\n&gt; over him, and like a wave of pain he staggered back a step, but it was\n&gt; not enough to bring him to his knees.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scorponok glanced at Scourge with pain filled optics, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you in \n&gt; pain?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scourge glanced at him and then back at the Autobots, &quot;Because I am\n&gt; not built as a Decepticon but Unicronian, we are superior.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scourge tapped his radio as he held up his weapon defensively,\n&gt; realizing that at the moment it was only he against the Autobots as\n&gt; his &#39;back up&#39; was on the ground. &quot;Sir!&quot; Scourge sent to Hydras and\n&gt; Cyclonus, &quot;Tuscon is doing that wave thing again.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ******************************************************\n&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, NIGHTRAZOR, Hydras, Perceptor\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Hallways\n&gt;\n&gt; Not far away, Cyclonus got the call and looked down as Hydras and\n&gt; Perceptor were also down in pain, &quot;We are having the same effect\n&gt; here.&quot; Cyclonus said, as he like the other Unicronian based\n&gt; transformers could feel the wave, but its affects were far less\n&gt; pronounced and a lot easier to ignore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Phobia looked at Hydras as she spoke to the others, &quot;I thought Hydras\n&gt; was Galvatron also? His Unicronian design should protect him like us?&quot;\n&gt; she looked confused and almost genuinely concerned.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus nodded, &quot;He is, but I believe that in taking on the Megatron\n&gt; Spark and his more . . . um . . . terrestrial form, that he has become\n&gt; more Decepticon than we.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus gestured at Nightrazor, &quot;Use your noise cancellation field to\n&gt; negate this until we can figure out a better solution.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightrazor nodded as he began to cancel out the effects of the sonar.\n&gt; As sonar is basically an operation of sound, Nightrazor begins\n&gt; generating a type of white noise to directly cancel out its affects.\n&gt; This is typically used to keep his movements quiet or to catch a foe\n&gt; at unawares, however this application of it was easily within his\n&gt; capabilities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus nodded as he gestured to the others, &quot;Nightrazor, stay with\n&gt; Perceptor and Hydras, it may take them a few moments to recover, and\n&gt; they may need your field until this ends.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightrazor nodded as he stood close to Hydras and Perceptor, tying to\n&gt; keep the field up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus straightened, &quot;Computer!&quot; he said as he looked around.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Working.&quot; said the cool computer voice.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Open fire on all Maximal and Autobot energy signatures.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Acknowledged.&quot; the computer voice came back, as internal gun units\n&gt; once again oriented on the Maximal and Autobot group and opened up\n&gt; again on Tuscon and his group!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Come!&quot; Cyclonus said to Phobia and Deepstryke, &quot;It is time to end\n&gt; this. Hydras will join us when he recovers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus, Deepstryke and Phobia jogged down the hall towards the\n&gt; Autobots and Maximals leaving Hydras and Perceptor to recover under\n&gt; the protection of Nightrazor&#39;s field.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
