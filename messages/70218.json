We will attempt an e=\r\nscape to reduce further risks to our ranks....  Wait a minute...  That&#39;s Da=\r\nrkhawk... He - he&#39;s calling for help.  Talon, I have to break contact for n=\r\now, need to help someone.  I&#39;ll call you back, I promise.&quot;\n\nHe breaks conta=\r\nct with Talon, hearing Darkhawk&#39;s voice.  Night Shift hears it too.\n\n&quot; Sir,=\r\n you thinkn&#39; what I&#39;m thinkn&#39;?  I mean that little pest has slagged us more=\r\n than enough times..  But deep down he&#39;s one of us.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Exact=\r\nly what I was thinking Night Shift.  Change of plans.&quot;\n\nHe lets go of his i=\r\nnverted spider maneuver as does Night Shift, who both land back on their fe=\r\net, to follow Dark Hawk&#39;s cry for help.  Like cats, as soon as their feet s=\r\nurely touch ground, they follow the sound until they find him, as they keep=\r\n their regular headlights on for light. Tucson arrives first, kneeling down=\r\n to Dark Hawk.  Night Shift now approaches as well, to assess the predacon&#39;=\r\ns injuries.\n\n&quot; Before you go nuts on us, we&#39;re here ta help not ta hurt ya.=\r\n  It&#39;s okay, we&#39;re not gonna open fire, we promise.&quot;\n\nTucson knew what was =\r\nhappening.  He had an idea all along that Hydras never gave a real scrap ab=\r\nout any of his lackies.  He felt bad for Dark Hawk, he knew that he had bee=\r\nn cast asside like a piece of trash. Instead of resenting him for his animo=\r\nsity toward him, he looks down to the fallen predacon with an air of compas=\r\nsion.\n\n&quot; Hydras may not come for you but, no matter who you are, which fact=\r\nion you&#39;re on, if you need help, I will ALWAYS come to your aid. And it&#39;s n=\r\no lie, it&#39;s a PROMISE.  Sure, you did a number on me, but, all things assid=\r\ne, I believe that really wasn&#39;t your fault.  Now, don&#39;t be alarmed, I&#39;m goi=\r\nng to lightly touch you to scan for fractures or major damages.  I want you=\r\n to tell me as soon as I touch something that hurts, so I can get an idea o=\r\nf what needs to be repaired.  Night Shift, support his upper body and try t=\r\no keep him calm.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.  Tucson now looks to Rodimus.\n\n&quot;Hmm, =\r\nstill a little dark down here.  Rodimus, could you give me some more light =\r\nplease?  I can&#39;t quite see if there&#39;s any external leakage of fluids due to=\r\n his fall.&quot;\n\nNight Shift could see that the lights were turned up as high a=\r\ns they went.  He couldn&#39;t help but interrupt.\n\n&quot;Umm, Sir, they&#39;re up as hig=\r\nh as they go...&quot;\n\nTucson was realizing what was happening.  The power that =\r\nturned him into a Prime could only give him sight temporarilly.  In order t=\r\no be able to see permanently that damage had to be maunally repaired.  Soon=\r\n, the area was becomming darker and darker.  And this time he was without h=\r\nis transmitter.  It was clear he would need assistance to vacate the area.\n=\r\n\n&quot; The Matrix must have only given me enough reprieve from my disability to=\r\n get Rodimus recovered..  I&#39;ve done that, and now...&quot;\n\nBefore he could fini=\r\nsh, the light dims and then..  Nothing.  He did not panic though, he was st=\r\nill a Prime, just a Prime who could not see.\n\n&quot;Night Shift, you&#39;ll have to =\r\ntake over for me..  Rodimus, here&#39;s your test.  Guide me back safely to the=\r\n Ark, I will help you fight, but you have to be up front and honest with me=\r\n.  Watch my back because even though I hear, I&#39;m without my transmitter, an=\r\nd I am still blind to those beyond my range of normal hearing.  Do this for=\r\n me, and I will trust you for eternity.&quot;\n\nNight Shift takes over, carefully=\r\n assessing Dark Hawk&#39;s injuries.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/hydras/Darkhawk\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;MOVE!!&quot;commadned hydras, w=\r\nhose move away of the hole.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HELP ME!!

P=\r\nhobia followed suit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus from below watched as Tuscon and Night=\r\nshift attempted to use\n&gt; &gt; some sort of ninjabot training. He shook his hea=\r\nd, wishing he had paid\n&gt; &gt; more attention to those classes. However he did =\r\nremember one thing as\n&gt; &gt; he looked upwards, &#39;always be prepared.&#39;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRodimus&#39; hand retracted and in its place was a grappling hook which he\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfired upwards, and with a click it latched onto something above. As\n&gt; &gt; fas=\r\nt as he could he began to climb out of the hole, while still\n&gt; &gt; dodging th=\r\ne firepower that was coming from above!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus swung around as he =\r\nfelt a blast of heat as several shots came\n&gt; &gt; close to hitting him, one ca=\r\nusing him to spin as his shoulder was\n&gt; &gt; clipped! &quot;We are clay pigeons dow=\r\nn here!&quot; Rodimus grunted as he\n&gt; &gt; continued to climb.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Legacy orien=\r\nted his main cannon at the Predacons and Decepticons, his\n&gt; &gt; intention was=\r\n not to hit them, but to destroy the floor beneath their\n&gt; &gt; feet, and send=\r\n them tumbling down into the hole as well! The front of\n&gt; &gt; the tank glowed=\r\n as energy was built up, and then a beam of light and\n&gt; &gt; destructive energ=\r\ny was fired from the great cannon muzzle vaporizing\n&gt; &gt; the floor!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLegacy&#39;s voice intoned over the radio, &quot;Then I would suggest vacating\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis location as soon as possible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
