Lunarpine \ncould also sense it.\n\n&quot;Do you have any idea what you&#39;re doing? there is no more Lunarpine \nno more Piston, no more Shadow Wing, there is only matrix.&quot; Something \ndidn&#39;t seem right, he&#39;d heard other bots speak of the Matrix, it \nwould never force itself upon another bot. &quot;I know now&quot; Lunarpine \nexclaimed, &quot;where I am.&quot; this isn&#39;t the matrix, &quot;this is crossways. \nwhere a bot is deemed worthy.&quot; Let me speak with my judges.&quot; \n\nPiston looked quizically at Lunarpine. &quot;You can&#39;t change your fate.&quot;\n\nA loud booming voice interupted Piston. &quot;You know that&#39;s not true \nPiston.&quot; the voice made the other spirits back up. Lunarpine didn&#39;t \nbudge. &quot;Why do you wish to change your fate warrior?&quot; The voice \nasked. Lunarpine knew the voice already had the answer, it wanted \nLunarpine to defend it with his words.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m a warrior of pride, so far every battle I&#39;ve been involved in \nsomeones been hurt by my lack of action. &quot; He took a second to gather \nthe rest of his courage, &quot;I made a Promise to Shadow Wing, A promise \nthat means more to me than my own spark.&quot;  the voice contemplated \nLunarpines words. &quot;Shadow Wings sark hasn&#39;t come to us yet, We give \nyou permission to care for it until we decide you are no longer \nworthy.&quot;\n\nPiston seemed upset by the voices decision. &quot;You will not respond&quot; \nthe voice dictated to the young bot.\n\n&quot;You have been offered another chance Lunarpine. The strength of your \nspark has earned you that, make the best of it.&quot;\n\nLunarpine somehow sensed that by getting this chance Lunarpine \nwouldn&#39;t need adjustment the next time he crossed this path, next \ntime he&#39;d be ready.\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Lunarpine understood what Piston was saying &quot;for a bot to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adjusted they send someone similar to do it&quot; PIston nodded yes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;So if a peacefull naturalist came here then another one would\n&gt; &gt; trane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them?&quot; Again piston nodded yes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw this as a chance to find Shadow Wings spark but \nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inturupted. &quot;Don&#39;t think it &quot; Pistons voice rang out. Lunarpine\n&gt; &gt; knew\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that thought and communication were one here, he could sense \nevery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bot around one of them had to be Wing. &quot;How do you communicate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directly with me?&quot; he asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m your focus point, you see me as I was because I focused on \nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directly.&quot; Piston let his gaurd down, sudenly he sensed why the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; former wolfbot was asking. &quot;No don&#39;t&quot; he cried trying to prevent\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpines form glowed brightly as he focused his energy he&#39;d \njust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realised he was IN the matrix but it took adjustment to be WITH \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; matrix.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He rached his thoughts out to Shadow Wing hoping her adjustor\n&gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gotten to her yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Wing Can You Sense Me?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (And the award for the best post in an RPG goes to drumroll \nplease)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
