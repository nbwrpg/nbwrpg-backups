What info you need from me for things or=\r\n input?\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There was no interruption, WHEELIE was allowed to go p=\r\nerch himself on\n&gt; top of the structure they had been inside of. It was rela=\r\ntively flat\n&gt; at the top, with stairs leading up to it. Had this been a tru=\r\nely\n&gt; religious place, this might have been the area were sacrifices were\n&gt;=\r\n made to angry god&#39;s and were mortals feared to tread except at the\n&gt; behes=\r\nt of the priests. However there was none of that, there was only\n&gt; stone an=\r\nd metal and the debris that had landed on it like leaves and\n&gt; such. It mad=\r\ne for a nice place for WHEELIE to sit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Time passes . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventual=\r\nly the shape of ASTRA could be seen climbing up the stair, her\n&gt; optics glo=\r\nwing slightly as the sun above was begining to set. She\n&gt; stopped as she sa=\r\nw WHEELIE, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re up here. I would not want to\n&gt; intrude.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She tu=\r\nrned as if to leave.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause from WHEELIE, just having=\r\n sat and processed things as if still, high up here over on the hill.  Of t=\r\nhe other Rodimus, he knew not.  Or of the Dinobots and what they begot.\n\nFi=\r\nnally as Astra cme up, Wheelie turned around and looked up.  &quot;Hello there. =\r\n I didn&#39;t scan you coming up a hair.  Is this what there is?  An end of thi=\r\nngs, like a quiz?&quot;\n\nThe small Mini-Vehicle taking a half roll down the plac=\r\ne he had been sitting.  &quot;Out into the light, of the next day?  Wondering if=\r\n the night will come or stay away?  Wondering what we might come to face?  =\r\nWhether it will be a disgrace?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
