Like a meteor it screamed across the sky. The maximal protoform inside instinctivly tried to salvage the ship. With little sucsess it crashed into a pile of sharp energon. A small shrpnel piece was jammed through the protoform slightly oh so slghtly penetrating his spark. The protoform took the shape of a nearby Falcon, but with a translucent body that shined blue. Inside you could see the mechanics at work, yet his outter body was the hardest material many had ever seen. Cryaltron pulled himself out of the pod and ran a diagnostic. &quot;Energon posioning iminent, spark in jeapordy, death inevitable.&quot; The shrapel still stuck out of his chest, he broke it off leaving a crystal like object infront of his doomed spark. on his robot form shoulders were sharp extendesions of energon, as were his fingers and feet. In his falcon form his wings were made of the same. His body was basicly made of hardned energon and the spark encased in an energon crystal, the spark slightly ever so slighty pierced in the front of it. &quot;How long do I have?&quot; came an voice of experience, his exact age was unknow but he survived many wars. &quot;Unclear progression unmeasurable.&quot; Cryatron snarled, &quot;Slag it!&quot; He transformed into his Falcon mode. The sun shined through him like a plate of glass...like he wasn&#39;t even there only leaving a rainbow under him as his trail. &quot;Any maximal in rage please respond.&quot; He flew off blasting his thrusters as well trying to get as far away from the  murderous energon as he could.\n\n\n"}}
