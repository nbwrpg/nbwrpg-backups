But now I may have a \nreason to reactivate Carnage, if Teltoli has not already found enough new \nfriends?\nBut, if you still want the old ones�.)\n\n** There was no point in moving from her spot to chase after some stupid \nstasis pod, it would only mean a plus sign in the population number of \nwhatever faction got there first.\nCarnage rolled over lazily onto her other side, remembering seeing that pod \nsteak in from the sky and crash less then a click away. But the sun was high \nand warm and she had no intention on leaving the outcrop half way up the \nside of a cliff that she had spotted out and parked herself for the \nafternoon.\nHer body was soaking up the heat as a sponge did water, and it felt \nwonderful.\n\nIt had been a while since she had had any contact with any of the robotic \nfactions which came around this dust ball of a planet�although she had kept \nupdated on everything.\nMaximals had a new base and leader.\nThe Ark was scrap.\nPredacons were supposedly staging an attack.\nAnd the Alliance base had relocated.\nOh course, nothing that concerned her since she didn�t belong to a faction. \nAnd life as a solitary assassin wasn�t all that bad.\n\nCarnage opened her mouth and yawned wide, making a small sound which might \nbe heard as cute before her jaws snapped shut again. Stretching out her arms \nand shoulders, that her fingers at the end of her hands. Next were her legs \nand thigh muscles, feet and toes. Back, neck, and finally her tail, \nstretching out straight behind her.\nBut then she simply moved her head so that the bottom of her jaw was laying \nagainst the edge of the cliff, looking lazily out onto the plains while her \nbody remained on it�s side. Her lazy eyes looking towards the crash site of \nthe stasis pod or where it should be located.\n\nShe remembered that it had been a while ago, almost a year, that she had set \nout towards the snow-capped hills after her friend Teltoli had disappeared. \nMaybe she had been looking for something in her sadness, never showing it, \nbut all she had found was frostbite!\nSo, she had returned to the warmer climates; raptors weren�t made for snow \nanyway.\nAnd here she was now, no better off then she had been after Dinobot had \ndied.\nAlone, lonely, board, even at times�depressed.\nTo the Pit! She still missed him!\nIt had been a long time since he had passed away and still the pain was \ndeep. But what else could she hope to feel when something like that hit so \nclose to the spark?\n\nCarnage rolled over onto her back, looking up into the great blue yonder, \nthe occasional cloud coming into view.\nShe remembered�everything.\nAfter her friend�s death she had disappeared from the Predacon all together, \nsinking into the swamps as well as she had into her sadness. From then on \nthey had been her home, drifting among the mists like a deep shadow. Their \ndark and deep atmosphere feeding her sorrow until there was nothing left. \nPaling her complexion until there was nothing but dull grays and browns.\nBut then�one evening a pod landed just beyond her swamp, holding something \nthat had changed her life�for a time.\nCarnage sighed.\nShe lost all of her friends, one way or another.\nThe thought of being alone causing her to feel a stab of inner pain within \nher spark. Also feeling a bit of betrayed at being left alone like this, \nmaking it so that she no longer trusted. But these feelings didn�t make her \nsad, only regret.\nRegret having anyone to care for in the first place.\nBut since Teltoli�s disappearance she had leaned not to trust again, \nbecoming her old hard self.\n: I could even almost chill Dinobot, if he was alive.:\nAnother stab of regret.\nCarnage growled and flopped onto her side again, moving so that she was \nfacing the rock wall and turned her back on the plains as well as the rest \nof the world.\n: Who needs �em?!:\nMuttering to herself in a grumpy tone, one only she could hear.**\n\n� Life�s a bitch and then �ya die!�\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
