Her face was covered with soot and \ngrease. She had slowly been making her way through the CF for the past ten \nminutes, doing her best to reconnect what was left of certain wires. She \nstopped crawling for a few moments while she answered IR&#39;s comm. Her \nbreathing was slightly labored:\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve been trying for the past ten minutes commander. Give me a few more \nminutes, and I should have the problem fixed.&quot;\n\nHysteria then opened a comm to Kluster:\n\n&quot;First I have to disengage the lockdown, then I&#39;ll do my best to reroute \npower, but no promises. Hysteria out.&quot;\n\nShe clambered through the remaining stretch of vent and dropped into the \ndamaged bridge:\n\n&quot;Just one more...&quot;\n\nHysteria slid under the smaller, still active console and reconnected two \nfrayed wire ends:\n\n&quot;OUCH!&quot; Hysteria pulled back and smacked her head against the underside of \nthe console. The wires had sparked her, and it hurt. She opened a comm to IR \nand Kluster:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to attempt to disengage the lockdown, wish me luck.&quot;\n\nHysteria tapped out a few codes and passwords on the small console. Outside \nthe extra layers of steel slide back, exposing the regular doors. The \nlockdown had been disengaged. A few seconds later Hysteria tapped out \nseveral more commands, and succesfully rerouted some power to the CRs. She \nopened a comm to Kluster:\n\n&quot;Reroute complete. There&#39;s some power, not much, but it should be enough.&quot;\n\nHysteria closed the comm and watched as the lights in the CF&#39;s bridge \nblinked on and off several times:\n\n&quot;I hope.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
