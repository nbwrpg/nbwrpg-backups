Fat chance!&quot;\n\n* She wiggled her toes to try and tickle Rion a bit before she finally \ndecided that she would let up.\nDiana backed off a bit and stood there watching him, keeping her face \ntowards him.\nEven though she was never trained in combat because her parents wanted her \nto grow up to be the proper ladylike princess, she knew a few things.\nMostly from either fighting with Rion or listening to his instructor when he \nwas in class.\nAnd keeping your eye on the enemy was #1.\nBut Diana still snickered at the sound of Rions whine, knowing that he was \ntrying to sound tough but it didn&#39;t work.\nThough, she had to work on her roar too, so they were basically in the same \nboat.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
