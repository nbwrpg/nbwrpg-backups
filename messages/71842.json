Si=\r\nnce you both can&#39;t do that,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll say it&#39;s not worth being a brat. I=\r\nf you two can barely work so well,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; then I&#39;d hate to see you in a sh=\r\nell. No offense, but if you can&#39;t do that,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&#39;s not worth trying to=\r\n hit you up for chat.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Leaning back against the wall, then =\r\nturning his attention back to LEO PRIME,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and crossing his arms over=\r\n as the discussion turned back to RODIMUS.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;LEO looked back f=\r\nrom WHEELIE to TUSCON, visably brining his own anger&lt;BR&gt;into check. &quot;Clear =\r\nthe room.&quot; LEO PRIME said to the others. He glanced&lt;BR&gt;at WING CALIBER, &quot;An=\r\nd keep an optic on RAT TRAP, STRAIGHT SHOT and&lt;BR&gt;WHEELIE, I will need to t=\r\nalk with them as well.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WING CALIBER nodded as he gestured for the o=\r\nthers to leave the room as&lt;BR&gt;LORD ELDER left pursing his lips thoughtfully=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was a brief glance from LEGACY and SANTON from the other roo=\r\nm.&lt;BR&gt;They were completely isolated from what was goin on in this room, but=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;TUSCON&#39;s outburst clearly had been heard in there. They quickly went&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;back to work trying to save SILVERBOLT&#39;s life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;LEO PRIME just looke=\r\nd at TUSCON as he waited for the room to clear his&lt;BR&gt;arms hanging loosely =\r\nat his sides. His optics on the Maximal Prime who&lt;BR&gt;was clearly becoming m=\r\nore unstable as time progressed, the concern for&lt;BR&gt;a brother Maximal prime=\r\n was warring with the anger he had burning in&lt;BR&gt;his spark, and it was writ=\r\nten all over his faceplate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Preston&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white; CLEAR: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n \t\t \t   \t\t  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--_c1e7e510-e7d3-4bf5-9a31-73edf68b5701_--\r\n\n"}}
