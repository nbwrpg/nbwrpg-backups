He\n&gt; activates his comm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Supernova, new orders,&quot; he says into it, &quot;Go to the following\n&gt; coordinates and attack. Its a base, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to\n&gt; handle it.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Supernova recieves the orders from Zardus, along with the coordinates\n&gt; of Hell Beast&#39;s new base. He sends an order to his team, and the\n&gt; Scrap/Flare jet swoops down, Supernova jumping up and combining with\n&gt; them. THe jet, now consisting of Scrap, Flare, and Supernova, turns\n&gt; around, heading for Hell Beast&#39;s base. The Vicir/Slasys jet turns\n&gt; also, following the rest of the Galactors.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;        Black Aracnia looked to the other Predacons after they had\n&gt; landed the\n&gt; &gt; transports containing the Ice Caves computer systems in the new HQ.\n&gt; THe\n&gt; &gt; Predacons were gathered under the largest of the transports.\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;Alright, were heading out to the CF to help Hell Beast. On\n&gt; they way\n&gt; &gt; we picked up an Allience transmission. Looks like theyre sending in\n&gt; a calvary\n&gt; &gt; of there own.&quot; She said, armed.\n&gt; &gt;        Tarantulas gave a brief chuckle. &quot;And who made you leader?&quot;\n&gt; His\n&gt; &gt; crimsom eyes were narrowed down to menacing slits.\n&gt; &gt;        Aracnia ignored him. &quot;Arm yourselfs. This is going to get\n&gt; very, very\n&gt; &gt; messy.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;        Adrax, Aerostreak, Aquarious, Black Aracnia, Gremlin,\n&gt; Jackle,\n&gt; &gt; Paddletail, Pheniox, Tankkor, and Tarantulas headed out, there\n&gt; destination\n&gt; &gt; was the Cybertronian Fire and Maximal defeat was thier goal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        Ominous Prime paced the table. He had failed miserable\n&gt; agianst the\n&gt; &gt; Maximals....and he had made enemies. He didnt care that the\n&gt; Predacons had\n&gt; &gt; vowed for revenge, it was the fact that of all the factions he\n&gt; could be\n&gt; &gt; defeated by, it had to be the Maximals. Revenge was definet.\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;I can see the CF is under heavy fire. It seems like a ripe\n&gt; &gt; oppertunity to not only seek revenge on the Maximals, but the\n&gt; Predacons are\n&gt; &gt; heading there as well.&quot; Putnam said, looking at the scans.\n&gt; &gt;        Ominous nodded.  WIthin minutes the 6 Energonians were\n&gt; airborne and\n&gt; &gt; directed towrds the Cybertronian Fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
