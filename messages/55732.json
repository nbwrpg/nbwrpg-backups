Don&#39;t worry she doesn&#39;t remember that she&#39; was once a \nmaximal \n&gt; &gt; or Rodimus&#39;s love, and a little trick will kill her if someone \n&gt; &gt; beyond me try to reprograme her...

Even going as far \nas giving \n&gt; the bot a slightly new form that can transform... as well as \nprotecting her. \n&gt; So many she had &#39;guarded&#39; over the millenia. Each of them were a \nrare case. \n&gt; \n&gt; The opportunity again was something she would enjoy. Already, she \n&gt; contemplated ways to turn the reporgrammed bot into one of on of \nthe few in \n&gt; history to be a more than lethal Decepticon fembot. &#39;She&#39;ll be \nmore than just \n&gt; Blackstorm,&#39; she thought. &#39;She&#39;ll end up to be Rodimus&#39; \ndestruction!&#39;\n\n\n"}}
