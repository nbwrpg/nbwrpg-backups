As you command.&quot;\nShe left the cave and headed back to the base.\nWhen she finally made it back to the base, she retireved one of the power \ngenerators and hooked it up to a land rover.  She slowly removed it from the \nbase and transported it to the cave.  She placed the generator where \nMegatron had specified and unhooked it from the land rover.  She started to \nget the generator hooked up and ready to function.\nA few hours later the generator was functional and ready.  She looked at the \nspace where the computer station would be.\n&quot;I&#39;m going to need help on that. I wonder if Scorponok would help me on that \nproject.&quot;\n\n\n------------Original Message---------------\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Thu, 22 Jun 2000 12:04:06 EDT\n\n&gt;::: Megatron, now within the giant space of the cavern set the stasis pod\n&gt;down. He turned to Darkmouse, Scorpinox, and Darkmouse. :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: We&#39;ll put the CR chambers over there....and the computers\n&gt;over there....Scorpinox can set up his lab in there....Darmouse can build \n&gt;the\n&gt;control station there...\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Waspinator pipes up ::: What can Waspinator do?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron ::: You can help me. Were going to be moving in the lighting\n&gt;gear and power generators. I want the scanners up by tommorow so we can see\n&gt;when....visitors arrive. Also, were going to need Energon dampeners.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Waspinatoe saluted ::: Waspinator will help!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron extends his hand to collect the files from Quickstrike :::\n&gt;Excellent.

So, the tower is messing up there transmissions?\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Pheniox ::: Yes, it should any how.\n&gt;\n&gt;::: A rock slide fills the cave with rumbling, and Set, Ra, and Ominous \n&gt;burst\n&gt;inside :::\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Set ::: It works, and it led us right to you!\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Mairne and Gremlin dive to cover, as dose Transanulas and Pheniox.
