He really didn&#39;t think \nit was a good idea. Prowl looks at Epyon.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think that would be a good idea. Most of the bots on the \nMaximal team were designed for either land or arial combat, and we&#39;d \nhave a much harder time fighting in water. And if its too far \nunderwater, we&#39;d need to wear suits or else the pressure would crush \nour superstructures.&quot;\n\nProwl frowns as he considers something. &quot;And besides, torpedos are \neasier to carry into battle than portable missiles. If we were \nattacked at an underwater base, the enemy could arrive carrying \ndozens of torpedos.&quot;\n\nHe looks around, getting an idea. &quot;Instead, we could salvage your \nship and improve the Cybertronian Fire here. If that&#39;s allright with \nyou, Commander.&quot;\n\nProwl looks over at Iron Raptor. He was used to being main adviser to \nStriker, and he hoped Iron Raptor would value his advice as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Epyon::\n&gt; \n&gt; He walked up to Iron Raptor.\n&gt; &quot;Madam Commander, I have a proposal to make. With the Cybertronian \nFire\n&gt; nearly destroyed, I think it would be a good idea to salvage what is\n&gt; possible and merge it with mybase. Between whats left of the CF and \nthe\n&gt; Star Jumper, we could build a under water city base. It would be \nmore\n&gt; defendable, do to the fact that enemys would have to fight under \nwater.\n&gt; What do you say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
