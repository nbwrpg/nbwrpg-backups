We&#39;ve thought and brainstormed, \ntweeked and polished until those characters were finally created. Now, with \ngreat pride and saticfaction, we present them to you all in an established \nand carefully assembled joint post.\nThe names of the creators of the indivual posts are in ( ).\nPlease, enjoy.\n\n( Megan )\n&gt;* There was no telling just where she was and how long she had been there; \n&gt;bright green eyes darted around to find the location and source of every \n&gt;unknown sound. A small thing in a world of giants. So she just sat there as \n&gt;she had for the past 5 cycles after stepping out of her child-sized stasis \n&gt;pod. Already in her emergency beast mode, suiting her size quite nicely. \n&gt;But as she sat there, looking around the baron wasteland she had obviously \n&gt;landed in, she went through her memory banks to make sure that she was all \n&gt;right. Her name was Diana, princess of the Golden Trade located one galaxy \n&gt;from Cybertron. Faction was Maximal. She was 6 and � years old and knew her \n&gt;multiplication tables. She had been aboard the DeltaTrica, her father�s \n&gt;ship, where she had been going with him, her mother, and some family \n&gt;friends to Sirose for the planets� Battle Gorge tournament. Her own \n&gt;bodyguard as well as her best friend�s, Prince Rion, had been entered into \n&gt;the contest to represent the houses that they served for.\n&gt;\n&gt;Diana�s eyes squinted to see far into the distance. She remembered that \n&gt;something had happened and everyone was rushing around, her parents coming \n&gt;into the room while she was playing with Rion. Under the watchful eyes of \n&gt;their guards. But her parents had looked pale. Her mother had picked her up \n&gt;and kissed her, telling her that she loved her very much. Her father had \n&gt;looked over her mother�s shoulder and said for her to be brave. After that \n&gt;she had been handed to her guard, who simply put her into an emergency \n&gt;stasis pod. There was screaming and fire. Then next thing Diana remembered \n&gt;was waking up here, with the sun shining through the pod window. Turning \n&gt;the inside into an oven�\n&gt;\n&gt;So, here she was now, in the middle of a desert and completely alone.\n&gt;\n&gt;Diana whimpered as she turned and looked towards a scuttling sound, it only \n&gt;dry grass rustling in the wind. Where was everyone? She was alone. Her \n&gt;bottom lip trembled a little as she shifted her paws in the sand, her grain \n&gt;colored fur blending in nicely. She could easily hide in the sand if it \n&gt;wasn�t for the black spots too. The emergency transformation had scanned a \n&gt;leopard cub as well as a dove, leaving her with the spotted fur and small \n&gt;white wings behind her shoulders. Diana looked around at the sand dunes as \n&gt;her fear and loneliness sank in, tears rimming her big green eyes and her \n&gt;lip trembled once more. Sitting there in the shadow of her pod, mewing \n&gt;nervously at every sound and occasional shadow. She was alone and afraid. \n&gt;Her whiskers wilting as she raised a mew to the open and sandy plains.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Mmmommmyyyy !&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;***** ( FireFox )\n&gt;\n&gt;A small, child sized escape pod had nestled itself amidst the sand dunes of \n&gt;the hot and arid landscape. If the bot housed within didn�t find shelter \n&gt;soon he would be roasted. The sound of muffled banging coupled with the \n&gt;frightened cries of a seven-year-old drew the attention of some local \n&gt;wildlife. Nothing dangerous, but nothing that would save the youngster from \n&gt;his grim fate either:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;LET ME OUT!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion twisted and turned in the small pod as he tried to force the vacuum \n&gt;seal open. He wasn�t only about to become KFC�s next big seller, but was \n&gt;quickly running out of air as well! Rion frantically beat his wings against \n&gt;the reflective metal sides. He had to do something! Anything! He was \n&gt;getting desperate. His breathing had become labored, and not because he had \n&gt;exhausted himself. The transparent status screen flickered before his blue \n&gt;optics. The lid was stuck and his oxygen was at 15% and falling fast:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;SOMEBODY! ANYBODY! HELP!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion�s cries ended in a choked sob. He wanted to go home. He missed his \n&gt;parents. He missed his friends. He even missed school! Rion blindly reached \n&gt;out for anything he could use to pry the lid open with. The air had grown \n&gt;musty and thick. Each breath had become harder to draw. The sun beat down \n&gt;on the small pod, magnified by the slick metal and glass window. The entire \n&gt;time all Rion could think about was what had happened aboard the \n&gt;DeltaTrica. They had been flying a routine route in the Sirion Galaxy. \n&gt;Well, that was what the navigator had told him after he promised to \n&gt;practice his battling somewhere other than the bridge. That was when \n&gt;everything went wrong. Rion was able to pick up some stray comments about a \n&gt;blown engine and an unexpected run-in with some old enemies. It didn�t \n&gt;really matter. All he could remember was Diana�s parents telling her to be \n&gt;brave, and then she was gone. He had chased after the guard that took her \n&gt;to the emergency pods, but got lost in the crowd. He was nearly trampled in \n&gt;the panic, but some how he found his way to what remained of the escape \n&gt;pods. He grabbed the first one he saw. Next thing he knew he was on some \n&gt;planet stuck in a pod that was supposed to save his life!!\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion grabbed the first and probably only thing he could find in the pod \n&gt;that may help him pry open the lid. It was lying next to him and seemed \n&gt;quite heavy compared to his small frame. That didn�t matter. His breathing \n&gt;had grown so shallow that he could barely see straight. He felt like he was \n&gt;under water, and any minute he could reach the surface. Rion stuck the \n&gt;other end of the object into the pod and pushed with all his might. The lid \n&gt;opened with a loud hissing sound. Rion fell over the edge and onto the \n&gt;ground gasping for air, the object was still clutched in his hand. Rion \n&gt;slowly spread his wings. Something seemed a little off about them, but he \n&gt;could worry about that later. He glanced over at his right hand. It was his \n&gt;sword! He thought he left it on the DeltaTrica! Rion quickly climbed to his \n&gt;feet, and fell right back down on his tail feathers. His wings were nestled \n&gt;comfortable behind him, and about three times as large as they should have \n&gt;been! His beast mode registered as something called a raven, but his wings \n&gt;definitely did not fit the profile. With a defeated sigh Rion sheathed his \n&gt;sword and returned to beast mode. On the plus side he could fly. That was \n&gt;actually kinda cool.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion activated his scanners and did his best to locate someone other than \n&gt;himself. He didn�t like being alone. It scared him. It scared him a lot. \n&gt;There was someone else! And the signature seemed familiar! Really \n&gt;familiar!! Maybe� Maybe it was Diana!!\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;DIANA!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rion took off in the direction of her signature. It had to be her! He just \n&gt;knew it! In his excitement Rion forgot he could fly, and instead ran on his \n&gt;skinny bird legs across the desolate desert. He had to find her!\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;DIAAAAAAA-NA!&quot;\n&gt;\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
