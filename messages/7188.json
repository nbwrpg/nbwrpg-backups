He will give us the advantage!\n\n::: Gremlin shrugs, and the four raise up. They take shots at each of the \nMaximal bots, Smokescreen, Ramulus, Kluster, Striker, and Rex. Transanulas \nsends a small batch of five cluster missles at Rex, while Gremlin uses both \noptic lasers and a semi-automatic riffle to bring down Strriker. Jackle, with \nan assult riffle fires at Smokescreen, and Hell Beast, armed with both chain \ngun and a newly added shoulder missle launcer, fire at Kluster and Ramulus. \n:::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron easily makes it into the skeleton which was once the Ark. With \nhis massive transmetal 2 body he glances around and spies what he had been \nlooking for. The powercore. He threw a detenator on it, and backed away from \nthe core. He made his way into what was left of the bridge, rummaged throught \nsome scrap and decided to threaten the Maximals on his personal comm unit. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: Attention Maximals....I have a bomb on the Ark. Ethier you \nsurrender the Cybertronian Fire, or I will blow apart the Ark and send us ALL \ninto non exsistance. And belive me. I would love nothing more than to see \nDecepticons rule the galaxy, even if it dosent mean Predacons will ever be \ncreated. You have five minutes to surrender it, and no one can make it from \nthe Cybertronian Fire to the Ark in five minutes. \n\n::: He laughs, and turns on the bomb and its five minute countdown \nbegins....:::\n\n"}}
