He particaly noticed a bot useing energy. He \nmolded into the shape of the bot. He looked at the body. He wasnt fond of it. \nHe looked at the other. A dragon. He transformed inot it. he thought... &quot;Why \nwould he stay in beast mode in a battle. He seems to be doing farely well \njust staying in it. Maybe he is stuck. Or maybe he doesnt want to show is \ntrue self just yet. What ever the reason. He watched with entertainment as \nthe bots went at eachother. The dragon then formed a new type of armor. He \ntried to scan it but it was blocked. He wondered what it could do. He \ntransformed into a liquid and watched.\n\n"}}
