Time Bomb was worried since everyone was shooting at Land Mine, he\nran\n&gt; &gt;to her and found she was wounded pretty bad. The bad part was that she\nwas\n&gt; &gt;quickly losing blood, and needed to have the blood flow stopped. He could\n&gt; &gt;burn her. No, that wouldn&#39;t work, the wound was too big and it would hurt\n&gt; &gt;her too much if he covered the whole thing. He decided he had to do a\n&gt; &gt;decent\n&gt; &gt;job, then. He powered his laser to flame mode and sent a small firey beam\n&gt; &gt;into her side. She was still bleeding, she wasn&#39;t even looking at him,\njust\n&gt; &gt;lifelessly looking at Megatron. Time Bomb knew why Land Mine always came\n&gt; &gt;prepared for this now. He took out her survival kit and wrapped her up,\n&gt; &gt;that\n&gt; &gt;would be okay for until they got back to base. Time Bomb picked up Land\n&gt; &gt;Mine, nodded to Megatron and sat down behind the rock next to Megatron...\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Wednesday, August 02, 2000 7:33 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Kick &#39;Em While They&#39;re Down\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Injector/Manterror:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Injector landed, a few feet from KitKat.  &quot;Hello, traitors!&quot; he said\n&gt; &gt;with\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smile, kicking at the side of KitKat&#39;s head, firing off a stinger\n&gt; &gt;missile\n&gt; &gt;at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Terrorsaur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manterror fired off a single ion disk at the rock Megatron was hiding\n&gt; &gt;behind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
