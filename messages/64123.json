She perceived a droning sound, monotonous and continuous, yet\n&gt;   it was fragmented as her audio receiver were rusty and in bad shape.\n&gt;   She also had some tactil perceptions... at least, enough to know that\n&gt;   she was not whole. Some of her parts were missing, and that\n&gt;   disquieting fact was more than sufficient to make her panick. She\n&gt;   started moving as best as she could, when a huge hand pinned her down\n&gt;   where she was. She realized there was talking, yet she couldn&#39;t\n&gt;   perceive it. Then, she felt something jab in one of her input at the\n&gt;   base of her skull.\n&gt; \n&gt;   She was being messengered.\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Easy now, Warrior. You are in good hands now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;What? Where am I?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Olympus Complex, this world&#39;s largest military base. You&#39;re being\n&gt;   repaired. We found you in many pieces, but don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll make you\n&gt;   better than before.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Thanks... I guess...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Rest for now, Warrior. Go into stasis, because what is about to come\n&gt;   will be painful.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   And she sank back into the nothingness of the shutdown.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   YAHOO!
