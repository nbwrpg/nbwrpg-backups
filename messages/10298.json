She also knew \nthat if he told her what realy happened, his pride would be bruised.\nBut she wanted him to tell her the truth.  If she had to speak \ntruthfully to him, he would have to be so to her.  She smiled, &quot;yup, \nI have to so he has to as well.&quot;\n\nShe wasn&#39;t mad at him, but it did hurt that he felt that he couldn&#39;t \ntell her what happened out right.  Maybe he was trying to protect his \npride? Maybe he lost the fight and didn&#39;t want to tell her? Who \nknows.
