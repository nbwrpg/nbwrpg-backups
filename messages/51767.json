What&#39;s more, they take it at Kyle, and that means you&#39;ve \ngot about a week&#39;s worth of oocs coming after. Mark my words: NO ONE \nIS MORE STUPID THAN ANYONE ELSE HERE.\nAnother thing: personnal beliefs. I don&#39;t care about the religious or \nsexual orientation. For all I know, ANYONE in this rpg could be gay \nand that WOULD CHANGE NOTHING. You&#39;re not a better person because \nyou&#39;re gay or not or christian or not. That means nothing.\nWe have an expression in Quebec that can be translated as &quot;Farting \nhigher than where the hole is&quot;. It means taking yourself for someone \nyou are not. I don&#39;t want that here. I&#39;m not asking everyone to be \nfriend with everyone, just to be respectful of them.\n\nI just want people to realize that being mean for nothing gives \nnothing. That&#39;s the kind of attitude that gets the war going in Israel \nand palestine. And I assure, I will personnally moderate anyone who \nintentionnally insults someone for an undetermined period of time.\n\n\n"}}
