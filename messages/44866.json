Very bad choice for a \n&gt; &gt; location to crash a ship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; As Optimus Fury&#39;s ship heads towards what looks to be its \n&gt; &gt; destruction.

A beam shoots towards Africa and scans a black \n&gt; &gt; &gt; panther. Inside the bot is given this beast mode and REFORMATED. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has the same weapons as Optimus Prime in BM except he can only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; partially absorb the weapons fire. He opens a com link to his \nown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bot: This is Optimus Fury. I am proceeding toward the inferior \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Angilions. They will agree to be reformatted or they will join \n&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of &quot;accidental&quot; deaths since the Maxis and Preds hunted \n&gt; &gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and destroyed Cheetor&#39;s team and killed most of there followers \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempts to deformat them. Because we are the Malacons. We live \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; secret, and destroy those inferior to us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Comm: Good. Don&#39;t return without a prize, reformatted or dead. \n&gt; Soon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a little elbow grease (lol) we will be 2% of the population \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Angelions will still be clueless about us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He proceeds to &quot;destroy the evidense&quot; by aiming his shuttle at \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atlantic Ocean and parachuting out over England.
