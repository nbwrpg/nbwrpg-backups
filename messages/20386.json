She had to give them all credit for trying, but there wasn�t much that \nthey could do on their own.\nShe made it a point to get to that subject when she got back to the CF, but \nfor now she just wanted to try and find Iris in that scrap heap.\nIron Raptor soon found her way down to level ground again, walking closer \nand closer towards the old Autobot ship�or what scrap was left of it. Her \nscanners tuned and her eyes searching, looking for the location where Iris \nmight be buarried.*\n\n\n\nDesmonus:\n\n* Desmonus could just tell that they were both surprised that she had saw \nthrough the wool they had tried to pull over her optics, but it was \ndifficult anyway. They were both as obvious as bull elephants in rutting \nseason.\nBut she couldn�t help but chuckle a bit at both their expressions, hearing \nReptilica stammering before she heard them both start to run back to her.\nMen! She thought. Give them what they want and they�ll be your slaves for \nlife�.*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
