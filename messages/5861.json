And \n&gt; learn.&quot; Magmatron said with a dark undertone. He noticed another of \nthe small \n&gt; insects. He squashed it. &quot;Bugs, nasty fellows.&quot;\n&gt;     He had decided on his course of action, and there was only one \nlogical \n&gt; step remaining. He started the recording.\n&gt;     &quot;Bobertron, if you have received this message then I am \noffline. I wish \n&gt; for you to return to the Destron base and take command. All the \naccess codes \n&gt; are in one computer, mine. They will be opened to your signature \nonly in the \n&gt; event of my death. If you do get this message, try and get Pantron \non our \n&gt; side, he will be of great help. All my plans are also in the main \ncomputer, \n&gt; no matter how different from what you thought I was planning follow \nthem \n&gt; anyway possible, I do hope you understand. Good-bye.&quot;\n&gt;     He was very proud of his work, everything was going according \nto his \n&gt; plan. He quickly made his way to near the entrance of the base \nhoping to \n&gt; catch the Destrocons before they made it too far into his base.\n\n\n"}}
