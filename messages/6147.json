He slumped \nhis shoulders. He thought, if something happened to her, it was going to be \nin his hands, and Megatron would blame him.\n\nHe was getting mad. He had little patience when it came to things like this. \nHe began to pace around his around. He had no one to lash out on, so he had \nto choice but to tense up, which led to  his pacing.\n\nHe had to get a hold of her some how. But then a logic thought hit this \nbrain. Comm-link. That was stupid! Why didn&#39;t he think of it before?  He \nforced himself to calm down, because from experience, he learned not to get \nmade at a Predacon female. With Predacon females, a tough male could always \nloose his dignity.\n\nHe opened his comm-link to Stingtra, trying to stay calm. &quot;Stingtra, ya \nthere? Jus&#39; answer me.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sat, 8 Jul 2000 17:09:22 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;*Stingtra sits down in the jungle and sits on a rock.

He wasn&#39;t a bot \n&gt;for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speed or that much endurance. He could follow a bot for miles \n&gt;following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their tracks and their signatures, but running after them wasn&#39;t such \n&gt;a\n&gt; &gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; idea. He was just too worried that Stingtra would just get herself \n&gt;into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble again. Then it would be his hide Megatron would have.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He coughed and looked around, searching for the sight of Stingtra. He\n&gt;knew\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she was around, sensing her signature near-by.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stingtra?&quot; A part of him told him go back to the cave and leave her \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inferno alone. If she choose to hurt herself, it was her fault.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But he had a thing for females.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n&gt;http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5530/13/_/_/_/963057138/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5530/13/_/_/_/963089254/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
