I know what I&#39;m doing. And it won&#39;t be a loss.&quot; She bowed her head, \nturning it to her wound on her side, caused by Mosquitor. She may have to go \nto the CR tank again.\n\nShe sometimes thought, what&#39;s the use? And she had even agreed to her \nthoughts, trying to kill herself. It didn&#39;t work. In her past, Megatron \nwould never kill her.\n\nWhy even bother with Megatron? She could live free in the Wild like she had \nbefore. She wasn&#39;t yet sure if he was still hunting her. But she still \ncouldn&#39;t escape the memories.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
