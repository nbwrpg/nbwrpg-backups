I \nhave turned \n&gt; over Commandership of the Predacons to Wild Dance Mare and I want \nhim also to \n&gt; replace me on the council. Please, do NOT take me off the list, I \nenjoy \n&gt; reading the posts but I am unable to keep up with my \nresponsabilities by \n&gt; writing them. I was one of the first members of this RPG, and after \na year I \n&gt; am proud to say it is an excellent association. Thank you all for a \nwonderful \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: The Decepticon vessle was complete. With the help from \nTransanulas and \n&gt; Gremlin they had killed alot of time. Now, they began to move \nequitment from \n&gt; Ominous Prime&#39;s lair into the ship. After the move, they began to \nseal the \n&gt; caveren and then the ship slowly exited the cave and was \nairborne. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Ominous ::: Tell Hell Beast were coming to get him.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Marine nodded and sent the message. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast shouted orders and had the Predacons that were \nleaveing with \n&gt; him take important items and leave items for the next Predacon \nCommander. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Pheniox ::: The energon cargo holds are ready to be loaded on \nthe shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast shighed. He was going to miss the Neo Beast Wars, \nbut time was \n&gt; gaining and he had to depart. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast looked at his crew ::: Pheniox, and Jackle, you will \ncome with \n&gt; me to Cybertron.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia spun around in shock, as did Demonaand a strange \nbot that \n&gt; looked similar to Hell BEast who just entered. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: What? Thats not fair! I deserve to go!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast pointed his wepon level with her head, ::: You \ndeserve to die \n&gt; with the bitch Demona!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Suddenly, Stryfe aimed his gun at Hell Beast ::: Sorry, dad, \nbut im \n&gt; taking command o-\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Jackle fired a single shot into his head, sending him into \nstasis. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Demona ::: No!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast fired on Demona, sending her down to the floor with \na groan, \n&gt; dead. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; :: Black Aracnia, in the confusion, transformed into beast mode and \nescaped \n&gt; the ship. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Bring my son with us, he can be reprogramed. \nDump the body \n&gt; of Demona is the antimatter chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~`\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: The Decepticon shuttle hovered over the Predacon base. Useing \ntractor \n&gt; beams in successfully transported the energon into its own cargo \nholds. Then, \n&gt; Hell BEast, Jackle, and Pheniox boarded. Transanulas, Gremlin, \nMArine and \n&gt; Ominous waited. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, I will miss it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Gremlin ::: What of Megatron?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: Good point.....\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Megatron glanced around his chamber, Ra had vanished, but \nWaspinator \n&gt; stayed. He felt a change going on. He knew Hell Beast was leaveing, \nbut he \n&gt; would stay to corrupt the history of Cybertron as long as he \ncould. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Set and Ra ran as swift as they could to the Decepticon \nshuttle. Quickly \n&gt; they boarded and explained themselfs. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Set ::: I cant stay here anymore! Im sure that they think Im \ndead and all \n&gt; my momey is being split up among my workers. I must go back and \nlook after \n&gt; it. Ra, being my body guard, is coming with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast nodded. He didnt care as long as he was going to be \nable to \n&gt; leave. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: The shuttle rose higher and higher through the sky until it \nmade a rather \n&gt; bumby orbit. Now, Hell BEast, Gremlin, Jackle, Pheniox, MArine, \nTransanulas, \n&gt; Ominous Prime, Set, and Ra all looked down at the prehistoic planet \nwith a \n&gt; heavey heart. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast ::: It was good while it lasted, but we must put the \npast \n&gt; behinde us. Everyone to your stations!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: They all wnet to there stations, pressed the correct keys, and \na \n&gt; transwarp corridor opened before them. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell BEast, with a sound of victory in his voice that had been \nlong \n&gt; missed, ::: Forward, set a course for Cybertron. The war agianst \nthe Maximals \n&gt; and Autobots has just begun!\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: With the laughter of the crew, the small Decepticon shuttle \npassed \n&gt; through and the corridor and it closed. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia cursed. She was now stuck on this damn planet. \nAll that \n&gt; remained was the Predacon base. She entered, set up the defences, \nand sent \n&gt; out a message. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Black Aracnia ::: All Predacons, Hell Beast has left the planet \nfor \n&gt; Cybertron. I encourage that Megatrons group come and join with Hell \nBeast&#39;s \n&gt; former group to make one powerful fraction. Sadly, I was left \nbehinde but \n&gt; that isnt going to stop me!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Thats all folks. I have said my peace with my characters. The fate \nof Black \n&gt; Aracnia and Waspinator and Rat Trap is up to Wild Dance Mare. Now, \nI want to \n&gt; write the future of my characters briefly in this next section.\n&gt; \n&gt;     After there return to Cybertron, Hell Beast resumed office as \nSenetor and \n&gt; eventually made his way on to the Council. With his supply of \nEnergon, the \n&gt; Predacons made fantastic advancements in warfare.\n&gt;     Pheniox took command of her Anti-Maximal Terrorist group and \ntook out a \n&gt; fleet of ships by the time of her death in battle. A memorial \nstands in her \n&gt; honor on Cybertron.\n&gt;     Jackle went into the Espionage business and infiltrated several \nAutobot \n&gt; offices. He was caputerd on one such mission and imprisoned. After \na messy \n&gt; and bloody escape his where-abouts are unknown.\n&gt;     Gremlin went into the military and turned out to make a \nfantastic \n&gt; Colonel. He invaded a Maximal colony and still holds it in \noccupation.\n&gt;     Transanulas, along with Ominous Prime, researched Liquid \nEnergon and with \n&gt; it made radical changes to fule. Entire fleets of Predacon ships \nnow run on \n&gt; it, and a whole new species of Transformer was created and called \n&gt; Energonians. Ominous got his wish. Transanulas, even though he is  \ninsane, is \n&gt; a respected Scientist.\n&gt;     Set returned to his company to find it broken and spilt among \nhis \n&gt; minions. He had them killed and resumed command of the largest \nPredacon \n&gt; franchise in the Galaxy. Ra is still his body guard, and also has a \nlarge \n&gt; part in the underworld of Cybertron.\n&gt;     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; ::: Hell Beast retired at his old age. On a small remote moon he \nbuilt a \n&gt; manor house. He remembers the days of the Neo Beast Wars and smiles \nat his \n&gt; successes. Now, an old bot and out of date, he mostly spends his \ntime writing \n&gt; books on his experiences and gives advice to those who are in \npolitics. With \n&gt; his influence he has gained much respect. \n&gt;     Now, he sits at a window and stares out at a planet similar to \nearth and \n&gt; wonders what the fates of his friends, commrads, and enemy&#39;s \nwere. :::\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the end of the story of Hell Beast and the first crew of \nPredacons \n&gt; that fought in the NEo Beast Wars.\n&gt; \n&gt; The End\n\n\n"}}
