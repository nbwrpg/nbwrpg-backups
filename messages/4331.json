As you command, my commander.&quot;\nShe climbed up and started up the lazar and started drilling.\nWithin minutes, 100 feet of the new tunnel had been cleared away and she \nstopped the drill to inspect the work.  She got back on the drill and aimed \nthe lazar at a slight upward angel and drilled heading to the surface.\n&quot;Hopefully in a few hours commander, we should reach the surface.  We could \nhave this tunnel completed by nightfall if luck be with us.&quot;\nShe turned and looked at Quickstrike.  She started to think that maybe he \nwasn&#39;t as bad as she origianlly thought.  She them remembered how he had two \nother bots after him and decided that he was out of reach. Besides, she \nthought, he hated her.\n&quot;Commander, don&#39;t let me keep you from your other duties.  I appreciate the \ntime you took with me here, I don&#39;t want to keep you from more important \nmatters. Your an important leader, I&#39;m sure there are other things you&#39;d \nrather do than waste yout precious time with me.&quot;\n\nShe looked down at the controls trying not to look at Quickstrike.\n\n----------------Original Message--------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 23, 2000 7:21pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n\nQuickstrike:\n\n\nQuickstrike tilted his head and pondered how he was going to do this. He\nwasn&#39;t the right bot to do this job, with the handi-cap on his hands. They\nweren&#39;t built for this operation.\n\nHe turned his head to Dark Mouse, not sure how to explain. He held his\nmismatched hands out, showing her both the arm that ended with the wide\nhooded cobra and the other with eight exremely long fingers.\n\n&quot;Maybe you should work th&#39; angles, eh?&quot; he said, drawing back his arms. The\nstrips of metal at his cheeks quivered lightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
