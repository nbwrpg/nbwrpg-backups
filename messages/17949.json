And I&#39;m sure \nthat those bots in the BW have heard of an IBM Computer, because all \nthe autobots and decepticons were all fluent in human technology, and \nI&#39;m sure that that knowledge was past on through the upgrade. And \nabout your thing with Nemesis Inforcer, there&#39;s a problem. Because \nthe Matrix is telling you to stop peace, but the Matrix was telling \nme and is telling child to make peace. What&#39;s with that?)\n\nStarscream\n\n&quot;All right, thanks KitKat. Come on, Drillbit, let&#39;s find that little \npiece of explosive diareha waiting to happen.(Get it? Because fire \ncomes out of his ass! Now that&#39;s creativity!)&quot;\n\nStarscream flys out of the base, scanning for Inferno.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois looks up, thinking he knows where Battera is. He sighs.\n\n&quot;All right, I&#39;ll leave. It&#39;s just that this image I saw really \ndisturbed me. And if I have more, I&#39;m going to go back to you. I&#39;m \nsorry for the way I treated you. If we were friends before, I would \nlike you to focus on that, and forgive me.&quot; Vulois flew out of the \ncave. Something inside him was burning up. Something was fighting. He \nflew and found a tree branch, wanting to think.\n______________________________________________________________________\nGotron\n\nGotron arrived where Zardus was, and asked him:\n\n&quot;So, what did you call me for? I was in the process of spying on \nKitKat!&quot; This wasn&#39;t true, but he wanted to look good infront of \nZardus, his idle.\n______________________________________________________________________\nPrebon\n\nPrebon sat there, with the canister containing Lightrade in his arms, \nand thought. This was the first big loss he ever had. He was dealing \nwith the big guys now. He felt as disguraged as the time his father \nwas incredibly mad at him for attacking the Maximal complex with \nLightrade.(Refered to in the first chapter of Prebon&#39;s fanfic, which \nI am in the process of writing.) But he wasn&#39;t out yet. He still had \nSlayer. And Spears&#39; programming would be fighting till the bitter \nend. And that Koj must be going nuts with the pain. Infact, this \nwasn&#39;t really a loss at all. If anything the Maximals are weaker and \nready for a finished off attack. Maybe he would attack again soon, \nbut not to finish them off. He needed a device to destory those anti-\nchips they had in their brains, and that would take time. And in that \ntime they would repair. But he will win this in the long run. What he \nneeded was an partnership. A back-up. Some group who enjoyed violence \nas much as his did. He got up and immediatly went searching the \ndatabase for his reasearch he made before he got here.\n\n\n"}}
