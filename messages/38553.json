The rpg isn&#39;t a side scroller video game where \n&gt; the winner is the one who presses the button the most times. \n&gt; Hopefully, the rpg is for acting out the personae of characters and \n&gt; having fun. If we all just tried to kill each other, then we \n(probably) \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be having fun. Don&#39;t play by who is the strongest is the \n&gt; winner. If so, you&#39;ve then effectively defeated the purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 29 Jun 2001, at 19:10, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Big words for a small team.
