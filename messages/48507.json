Inside, Shadow Star deactivated 5 of the 6 \ncannons and their power went directly into the shields.\n\nShadow Star: The cannons are all down except one, Sir. The shields are \nnow at 200% of their normal capacity.\n\nTyrael: Perfect. Now, everybody hangs on to something.\n\nThe ship started to enter the transwarp passage. It shook heavily and \nstarted to revolve on itself.\n\nTyrael fell on the ground, but managed to transform to phoenix mode \nand to fly in the air. Shadow Star grabbed a bar and twisted it due to \nthe speed of the ship.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;deltazero1&quot; &lt;DeltaZero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;ok sir&quot; talon said as he turned to face it and drove into the hole \n&gt; and out of sight\n\n\n"}}
