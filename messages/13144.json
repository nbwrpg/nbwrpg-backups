He went beast mode and then uderground, and dug to the CF.  He popped\nup and saw Necromancer, Hell Drak and Firearm.  He went back underground,\nand popped up right in front of Firearm.\n\n            &quot;Say cheese!!!!!!&quot; Decadel said and fired his shoulder photon\ncannons at Firearm, who was standing pretty close in front of him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n           Necromancer saw Decadel fire at Firearm.  Firearm would be\nblasted to the moon if he got hit!!!  Necromancer ran over and dove at\nFirearm, and the shot missed them.  OH CRAAAP!!!!!!!  Hell Drak!!!!  Oh\nno!!!  The shot hit Hell Drak and she went flying back, and hit a rock.  She\nfainted, and fell on the ground.  Necromancer went running to Hell Drak, but\nwas too late.  Decadel popped up by Hell Drak, in beast mode, and wrapped\nhis end around Hell Drak, and then he pulled her underground, to take her\nback to the Pred base.\n\n         &quot;So long, suckers!!!!!&quot;\n\nDecadel and Hell Drak were gone.

We just have to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#39;ll kill you\nPredacons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
