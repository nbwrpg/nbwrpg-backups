The room looks like it may have at one time\nbeen a workshop of sorts, but now it is a ruined mess.\nComputers that have been apparently dead for millennia\nupon millennia and half built machines line the\nrough-hewn stonewalls. Nothing moves here, not\ninsects, rodents or even air. \n\nSuddenly the room begins to shake, as somewhere in the\ndistance an earthquake makes itself felt! Walls shake\nand stones fall; dust for the first time in many years\nis thrown into the air. Walls crack and shatter as a\ncrevice opens up, and somehow, from nearly a mile up\nlight streams into the room, the light shimmers, the\nwalls again rumble for a few minutes and then water\nsplashes into the chamber and quickly fills it!\n\nThe water entering the room washes away years of dust,\nrock and layers debris, revealing a stasis pod. Inside\na form can be seen, dormant, as if waiting for\nsomething and yet so far nothing has come. But with\nthe water comes silt, stone and salt, and and sparks\nflash out, and circuits that�s have been long separate\nby mere inches are now connected and the pod flickers\nonce ... twice ... and then comes online. \n\n     From the top of the lamps come on and light fill\nthe room with a murky glow. Inside the pod coded\ninstructions file across small screens. Images of\nanimals appear: an avian, a bovine, and a large jungle\ncat, and the last almost forms an animal, but as if\ndue to some bit of damage it becomes a star fighter,\nresetting to some default mode. Interior programming\nof the pod continues processing information and\npouring it into the form as the machine shocks the\noccupant and begins to awaken the 6-changer it has\nstored inside. Its forms are modified to fit the\nprogramming specifications: Shark, Eagle, Auroch\n(large bull), Lion and star-fighter, all of them\nvarying hues of dark purple and black. The computer\nswitches off, and the interior of the stasis chamber\ngoes dark. \n\nA few moments pass, and then the door to the stasis\nbubbles and opens, and what appears to be a large\nblack shark swims out of the chamber, moves swiftly\nthrough the open crevice and swiftly rises to the\nsurface. Breaking into the air it shifts into the form\nof a star fighter and hovers for a moment as if\nlooking around, The world it sees is strange and new,\nits like a babe seeing the world for the first time.\nThe ship banks around the rather large lake that this\ncreature has risen from and notes structures of\nhabitation in the distance. \n\n�Megatron.� A deep reverberous voice speaks across\nencrypted and yet ancient (Last season of BW) Predecon\nchannels. �It is time that I begin my duties. What are\nyour orders?� With a flare of boosters it rockets out\nacross the open skies in the direction of the original\nPredecon base.\n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for a deal?
