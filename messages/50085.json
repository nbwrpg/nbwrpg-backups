Even an Elemental warrior would not completely fill \n&gt; such a huge battle armor... (She raised her voice) Who or whatever \nyou \n&gt; are, we are not hostile to you. We demand safcon, the safe passage \n&gt; through this area. I am Galaxy commander Katya Kerensky, Loremaster \nof \n&gt; the Wolf Clan, and I travel with Star Colonel Ragnar of the Ghost \nBear \n&gt; Clan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: There is more. We do not know what a Maximal is. We may not \nbe \n&gt; hostile, but in the event of your attack, we will make sure you \nregret \n&gt; ever pointing a weapon at us.

She was willing to know more of him, after he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had left the true \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wolves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Tell me, Ragnar, how was it with Phelan? And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what happened in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Arc-Royal Defense Cordon?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar smiled: Well, it has been a job to keep the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jade Falcons back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as we could from the cordon. The Kell Hounds did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help a lot, and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mech facilities helped us to rebuild a rather strong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; touman. Then, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was captured by the Bears...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Ah yes! I remember Bjorn Jorgensson saying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once you were a key \n&gt; &gt; &gt; element for the Ghost Bears. What then?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar thought for a moment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: Bjorn is a man I can call my friend, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soldier I can call a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; true warrior, and a politician of the kind of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kerenskys! He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trusted me, pushed me back to the warrior&#39;s way and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually gave me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; command of the Rasalhague Bears. I never actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dreamt of commanding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warriors of my former nation among the Clans...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya remembered the time he was a wolf. A young and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bright freeborn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior of kind of Phelan Kell. He would have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bloodnamed too if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had proved to have common genetic material with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clan bloodlines.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her mind drifted and she looked at the sky. Her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warden tendencies \n&gt; &gt; &gt; never prevented her to rise in a crusader clan, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she did not like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the idea that she would not be totally able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prevent Vlad Ward to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conquer the Inner Sphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She saw something in the sky and magnified to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough of it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, she still could not make out what it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: There is something coming. It seems metallic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and it is coming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: Then we prepare...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both transformed, once more becoming the war\n&gt; &gt; &gt; machines they guised as, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to fight if need be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
