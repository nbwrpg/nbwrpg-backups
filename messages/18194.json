He growls, his jetpack powering down as he drops toward Blender,\n&gt; slashing his sword at the bot&#39;s back as he lands.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A shot hits Bloodystrike in the chest, sending him flying backwards before\n&gt; regaining stability.\n&gt;\n&gt; He aims carefully at Shockaract, firing off two missiles. He frowns as he\n&gt; notices a femm laying in stasis lock on the ground (Vamprah), gliding in\nand\n&gt; landing near her.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica opens his eyes, going out of stasis lock. He was drenched with\nmech\n&gt; fluid, but he was still somewhat functional.\n&gt;\n&gt; A stray blast nearly hits him in the head, Reptilica realizing that he was\nin\n&gt; a battle. He gets up, running for the shuttle in which he had brought the\nVok.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer watches Najah eat a small mammal, smiling as the bot asks where\nthe\n&gt; battle is.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Right this way, follow me!&quot; he says, taking off at a run toward the\nAlliance\n&gt; base.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc shakes slightly as shots hit his armor, regaining stability as he\n&gt; climbs up in the air after dropping a bomb.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Agreed,&quot; he replies to Demolition, then switching his comm-link to\ntransmit\n&gt; to all the Warmachines, &quot;Time show these bot that battle with us means\ndeath.\n&gt; Warmachines, UNITE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With those words, Havoc transforms into a huge torso, waiting for the\nother\n&gt; Warmachines to transform into the other bodyparts.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hearing Havoc&#39;s command, Repressor transforms into a leg, hatching onto\n&gt; Havoc.
