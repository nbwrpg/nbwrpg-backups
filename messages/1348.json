She walked up to it and placer a delicate hand on the ornate carvings, they were beautiful! Like nothing she had ever seen, they also seemed so alive!\nCarnage looked over the carvings with extreme care and persuasion to make sure that her optics missed nothing, with such a beautiful door there was surely treasures behind it.\nShe smiled at the thought of such treasures, weapons that nobot had ever seen, tactical scrolls, jewel studded swords and axes, everything an assassin could possibly ask for!\nCarnage wanted to see what was on the other side of that door so much but when she went to open it it was locked, she growled but then thought that no lock could stop her from entering. But one thing did, the face that this wasn&#39;t her base and she was a stranger here.\nShe sighed as she turned away from the door, besides...there was always tomorrow.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
