She \ndidn&#39; know why, but the whole situation felt so darned familiar.  She \nsaw how Dracona wasn&#39;t waking up.  She gave her another injection of \nthe antidote.  She knew the drug wouldn&#39;t harm her in any way.  But \nshe should be waking up very soon.\n\nDarkMouse walked to the door way and looked around the main room of \nthe base.  She was wanting to talk to Scorponok.  She wanted to find \nout about her past.  Something that she had forgotten. She knew that \nshe was reprogrammed.  But what she was before the reprogramming, she \nhad no clue.  And that&#39;s what she wanted to ask him.\n\n\n"}}
