There would be no other clear way out of this cavern then!\n&gt; \n&gt; Zyber whimperes as she tried with her might to heave herself to her \nfeet, \n&gt; holding her sides as she got up and looked towards DeathScythe.\n&gt; She growled plaintivly at his words.\n&gt; \n&gt; She closed and covered her optics as he blasts open the exit again, \nonly to \n&gt; feel a wash of cold air swamp into the cavern.\n&gt; Zyber then opened her optics to see DeathScyther walk out of the \ncave, \n&gt; giving it everything she had to move quickly and try and get out \nalso. Even \n&gt; if it meant being with him again in the same situation.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t hard to know that he was going to seal up the hole again, \nand just \n&gt; as she broke into a run, so close to the enterance he fired.\n&gt; However, with a cringe she dove just under the blast, rolling out \nright into \n&gt; the back legs of DeathScythe.\n&gt; She hit hard against them, but at least she was out of the cave.\n&gt; But there was still the threat that DeathScythe just might fall \nback against \n&gt; her now...because she had struck the back of his knees!*\n\n\n"}}
