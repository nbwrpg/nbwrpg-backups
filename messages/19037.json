I&#39;ll post with the rest of my chars from school.\n\n::Prowl::\n\nProwl falls backwards as he is released, landing on his butt. He \ngritts his teeth in pain as his damaged arm hits the floor, the \nMaximal quickly jumping to his feet.\n\nHe was leaking fluids freely from wounds in his chest, and his arm \nwas sending constant screams of pain through him.\n\n&quot;Iron Raptor, are you allright?&quot;\n\nIt might have been ironic to ask that question at that point, with \nhim bleeding all over the floor and Iron Raptor standing in front of \nhim mostly unharmed, but he was worried about her mental condition \nmore than his physical.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * The sound of his pain was welcomed, but only to the more evil and \ncunning \n&gt; side of her systems which controlled her beast modes. The other \nside was \n&gt; completely applaud that she could have ever had such modes in the \nfirst \n&gt; place, even considering aborting them once or if she ever managed \nto gain \n&gt; control of her functions again.\n&gt; But even the thought of abortion brought on a more will for the \nmodes to \n&gt; live and act, which only urged them on to swamp out her systems \nmore and \n&gt; more each moment. However, they would never be able to get total \ncontrol.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creature was urged on to continue its acts as it hears Prowls \narm snap, \n&gt; the painful expression on his face rather satisfying. The mech-\nfluid only \n&gt; clarifying  it&#39;s sinful deeds.\n&gt; However, while the modes were distracted by their pleasure of \nProwls pain, \n&gt; the more logical and robotic side of her systems were slowly and \nsurely \n&gt; inching for control.\n&gt; It saw Prowl through the eyes of this mode, through the keen sight, \nwhich \n&gt; was sure enough to miss nothing. And what it saw made its spark \nalmost \n&gt; shatter in fear.\n&gt; Iron Raptors beast modes were tarring up the only bot she had ever \nloved, \n&gt; and with no reason at all.\n&gt; However, little did she know that it was only the blood lust, which \nshe had \n&gt; been keeping contained. which was being shown.\n&gt; Not enough time in the battlefield to ease the strain of two deadly \nand \n&gt; horrific beast modes. And now, released and unable to be contained, \nthey \n&gt; were expelling their rages that would have been used in war.\n&gt; \n&gt; She flexed her claws, only managing to sink them deeper into Prowls \narmor. \n&gt; Her weight baring down against him, wanting to push him to the \nfloor and \n&gt; have him off his feet. A vulnerable position for any stalked prey.\n&gt; But then she heard it, something that brought a rather surprising \nreaction \n&gt; from her.\n&gt; Love? Did she know that word, did she know that name? Yes, yes she \ndid. But \n&gt; where, how?\n&gt; The beast modes were confused, but the logic knew better.\n&gt; In one fleeting moment, as she looked into Prowls face, she knew \njust who he \n&gt; was and why he was here. She remembered.\n&gt; And in that same moment, the logic took more control over the \nmassive form.\n&gt; With a heave of her body she moved from Prowl, still in a little \nconfusion \n&gt; but not as much as before.\n&gt; But he was right, just WHAT was she doing? Attacking the only thing \nin this \n&gt; entire stinking world that she loved even more then her own self.\n&gt; \n&gt; She stepped back and looked at him, mech-fluid ridden and in pain.\n&gt; SHE was the one who had caused this, had caused the pain which \ntwisted his \n&gt; features at that very moment.\n&gt; And at that moment, she was disgusted with herself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her beast modes fought back to regain control, wanting to at least \ntaste his \n&gt; fluid against its tongue once again. But there was no way past the \nlogic \n&gt; now, the logic which could not completely master control but enough \nto know \n&gt; what it was doing was wrong. Way wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, she simply stood there now, her mouth dripping mech-fluid and \nacidic \n&gt; saliva, simply staring at Prowl with an expression which \ncommunicated her \n&gt; problem. Her body stiff and alert, but questioning of its own \nreactions \n&gt; now.*\n\n\n"}}
