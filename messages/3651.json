Glare at the Predacon as he came up from the roll in a crouch, sighting with his laser sight and firing off more then six charges before he was forced to move again from the threat of Anubis&#39;s shots from his rifle. Clearly missing two of the Predacon&#39;s charges but as he turned to fire upon the enemy the third his him in the chest plate, sparks flew but the damage was not all that great.\nDinobot staggered back a few steps before regaining his stance but then the sight of Nemesis&#39;s caused him causing him to get on the move again but this time straight for the firing enemy.\nWith a roar that could be heard over the entire field he took every one of Nemesis&#39;s shots except those in which were not straight on target, the charges causing sparks to fly where ever they hit but not stopping the advancing warrior.\nDinobot stopped a few feet from Nemesis, the damages in which he had taken clearly seen as mech fluid ran from his wounds. But despite all of the damages he still wore an expression in which clearly stated that even though his body had been hurt his determination and rage was still as strong as ever.\nWith a snarl he looked at Nemesis for a split second before sighting but this time not firing his optic laser...but his paralyzing beam in stead. It having a wider range and a more chance of hitting the enemy.*\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
