And then a shake of the head from WHEELIE.  &quot;My ALLIES\n&gt; the MAXIMALS are not, for my friends they have forgot.  On this world, if I\n&gt; must make it my home, then I will go wtih my friends or go out on my own.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE watched the erupting volcano, goign to bring out a telescopic visor\n&gt; to try and scan it from afar then to sweep it over to try and make out what\n&gt; was going on.  The AUTOBOTS had been where his friends were, and the\n&gt; AUTOBOTS were no more.  He was not fond of the MAXIMALS for he had never\n&gt; been one.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nBringing out his telescopic visor WHEELIE could clearly see the\nVolcano. At the top of it, what appeared to a large dragon remenicent\nof TUSCON and a larger flaming phoenix flying around. WHEELIE was too\nfar away to pick up anyhting like an IFF signature, even if sensors\nhad been at full strength.\n\nThe gathering clouds and ash around the Volcano were starting to\nobscure his view, until only the flames of the Phonix could be seen.\n\nBACKSTOP looked at WHEELIE, &quot;You are weclom to stay with us until you\nmake up your mind.&quot;\n\nGRIMLOCK nodded, &quot;Me Grimlock stay here. No Maximals, only old Autobots.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC - If you&#39;re wanting to fade otu WHEELIE&#39;s story here, I can do that.\n\nOOC: Sounds good to me. We can pick it later if you want or not. Your call. :)\n\n(FTB) Fade to Black\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
