What me to kill &#39;er?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Zardus walks through the halls of the Iron Fist, Panzertron explaining all\nof\n&gt; the functions to him. So far, he had grasped everything, and had seen how\nto\n&gt; put it to his advantage. Moving the Alliance here would be very rewarding.\n&gt; The only faction with an island base, and shuttles for transport.
