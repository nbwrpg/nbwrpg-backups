It \nseemed he was laying on his back on something blue that he couldn&#39;t feel, \nstaring into something whitish that he could feel pressing against his \nstomach.\n\nHis systems realign themselves and he realizes that he in laying on his \nstomach. He rolls over and sits up. He looks around again. He was on some \nsort of beach. How he got there he had no idea. The last thing he could \nremember before waking up was falling out of a cave while slashing at Zenyak.\n\nHe struggles to his feet and sets off toward the mountains he had been washed \nashore near.\n\n"}}
