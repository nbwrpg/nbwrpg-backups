Dewboy, you say \n&gt; you have all these major ideas, Send them to me and Rdahl.  Also \n&gt; dewboy, you can&#39;t just have your characters arrive in maximal city \n&gt; without posting them entering maximal city.  That means you have to \n&gt; wait for someone to let you in if you are not on the visiter list \nand \n&gt; I didn&#39;t see the post having your characters let in Maximal city.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Although asking fox to make a cartoon of the RPG would prove to be \n&gt; &gt; itneresting it would be rather difficult as I have noticed that \nthe \n&gt; beggining \n&gt; &gt; posts are no longer there and you would have to contact players \n&gt; long since \n&gt; &gt; gone on being able to use charachters they created. Plus we really \n&gt; dont have \n&gt; &gt; an episode type format so scripting the show would be even harder.\n\n\n"}}
