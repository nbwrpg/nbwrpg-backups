He heard a loud beeping, \npressing a button, it ceased.  Looking over screens of each camera, he saw \none that was flashing a light blue.  That meant to tell him where the trouble \nwas.  Looking at the screen, he saw the bot that had been captured, or so he \nthought, who was now free.\n\n&quot;These idiots.  All you have to do is, is watch them?  Is that to much to \nask?&quot;\n\nChordate pressed several commands.\n\n\n---\n\nTwo autoguns pop down from the cieling, one pointing at BrightBlade&#39;s head, \none at the back of her knees.\n\n---\n\nChordate activated the intercom for that room.  &quot;Attention Predacon, stay put \nand don&#39;t try anything, or I will stop you with deadly repeat.  I repeat \nDEADLY force.&quot;\n\nHe activated the comm. on a secured Maximal frequency.  &quot;This is Chordate, \nattention all available Maximals, a once captured intruder is FREE near CR \nchamber (instert # here), in sector (insert here).  Get there immediately, \nwatch for autogun fire, and possibly flamethrowers.  Try to take the prisoner \nalive, but you have authorization to use deadly force.&quot;\n\n-----\n\nSmokescreen recieved Chordate&#39;s transmission.  &quot;Smokescreen on it.&quot; he \nreplied, taking out his weapon (sprays chemical that knocks people out, kinda \nlike skunk&#39;s spray, only more powerful, etc, check in his profile).  He ran \nfor the location given to him. \n\n"}}
