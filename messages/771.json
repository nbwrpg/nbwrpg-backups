Not a raptor.)\n\n* Rage was just about to sink her teeth into her meal when it saw her and \njumped back, it was then that it made a few strange sounds towards her and \nattacked.\nShe shook her head as it did so but she suddenly stopped dead when 10,000 \nvolts of energy began to surge through her body.\nRage pulled back and roared, she had never had a meal attack her like this \nbefore! She took a few steps back and roared again, something was happening \ninside of her...something that seemed familiar but was so strange that it \nwas frightening!\nShe snarled in fright as the strange feeling grew and intensified, she \nslammed her head into her prey as a strange sound came from inside of her \nhead...*\n\nInternal Systems: &quot;Robotic Mode has now been activated, being will \nautomatically transform in 3.4 nanos.&quot;\n\n* Rage took another few steps back when everything began to change, she \ngrowled but finally understood the computer&#39;s last words. &#39;Nanos.&#39;\nShe roared again as a more sudden change began to occur, she began to \ntransform!\nSoon, where once stood a hungry Tarbosaurus was now a bot the size of \nMegatron himself, her face was a very light blue, her optics the color of \ngrey stone. Her body was well muscled but didn&#39;t lack the soft and supple \ncurves of a female body, grey and black armor covered her chest and pelvic \narea, arms and legs, a red loin-cloth hung down from the front and back of \nher waist area.\nRage looked in surprise at the body that she now occupied, it was strange \nand looked like the food that she was trying to hunt.\nShe looked  at Scourge and stepped back but then fell, it was almost like \nshe was one of their kind now! How could that be?!\nIt was diffacult to try and walk on these\nstrange legs, how could her prey actually be able to do that?\nRage looked up at Scourge, she breathed hard...what had he done to  her?!*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
