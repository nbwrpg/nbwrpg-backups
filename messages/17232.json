But \nsomething still bothered her.  Unless this bot that was helping them \nwas a maximal, she knew she would be expected to repay Veratis back \nfor his efforts in helping them.  She could only imagine what that \nkind of payback Veratis might want.  She suddenly felt cold and \nstarted to feel drained.  She still had to hang on untill Lunarine \nreturned.  She made a promise to never leave him and she wasn&#39;t about \nto break it now. &quot;when do you expect Luanrpine to return?&quot; her spark \njumped as the thought of being stuck here without him crossed her \nmind.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Veratis was trying to word together the proper response in \n&gt; understandable terms.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I had to remove your spark from Lunarpines, you are in a newborn \n&gt; protoform, The DNA scanners are trying to assimilate the DNA I \n&gt; imprinted and programmed to reject it. When Lunarpine returns your \n&gt; owl DNA will be the secondary scan. Since your form won&#39;t accept \nthe \n&gt; primary form it&#39;ll pick the secondary. You will be reborn and \n&gt; flightworthy in no time.&quot; He didn&#39;t expect her to fully \n&gt; understand,Protoforms don&#39;t usually have thier instincts and grasp \nof \n&gt; reality until thier transformed. He&#39;d hoped that since she was \n&gt; already activated that her logic systems were fuly operational.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
