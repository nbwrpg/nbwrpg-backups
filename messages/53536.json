Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in\n&gt; a small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning\n&gt; he came to the Church carrying a rusty, bent, old\n&gt; bird cage, and set it by the pulpit.  Eyebrows were raised and, as \nif in response, PastorThomas began to speak...\n&gt; &quot;I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a\n&gt; young boy coming toward me swinging this bird cage.\n&gt; On the bottom of the cage were three little wild birds, shivering \nwith cold and fright. I stopped the\n&gt; lad and asked, &quot;What you got there, son?&quot;\n&gt; Just some old birds,&quot; came the reply.\n&gt; What are you gonna do with them?&quot; I asked.\n&gt; Take &#39;em home and have fun with &#39;em,&quot; he answered.\n&gt; I&#39;m gonna tease &#39;em and pull out their feathers to\n&gt; make &#39;em fight. I&#39;m gonna have a real good time.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;But you&#39;ll get tired of those birds sooner or\n&gt; later. What will you do?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Oh, I got some cats,&quot; said the little boy. &quot;They\n&gt; like birds. I&#39;ll take &#39;em to them.&quot;\n&gt; The pastor was silent for a moment.\n&gt; How much do you want for those birds, son?&quot;\n&gt; Huh?? !!! Why, you don&#39;t want them birds, mister.\n&gt; They&#39;re just plain old field birds. They don&#39;t sing.\n&gt; They ain&#39;t even pretty!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;How much?&quot; the pastor asked again.\n&gt; The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and\n&gt; said, &quot;$10?&quot;\n&gt; The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten\n&gt; dollar bill. He placed it in the boy&#39;s hand. In a flash, the boy \nwas gone. The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the \nend of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting \nthe cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars \npersuaded the birds out, setting them free. Well, that explained the \nempty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell\n&gt; this story.  One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. \nSatan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and \nboasting.  &quot;Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down \nthere. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn&#39;t resist. Got &#39;em \nall!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;What are you going to do with them?&quot; Jesus asked.\n&gt; Satan replied, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m gonna have fun! I&#39;m gonna\n&gt; teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and \nabuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I&#39;m gonna teach \nthem how to invent guns and\n&gt; bombs and kill each other. I&#39;m really gonna have fun!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;And what will you do when you get done with them?&quot;\n&gt; Jesus asked.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll kill &#39;em,&quot; Satan glared proudly.\n&gt; &quot;How much do you want for them?&quot; Jesus asked.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want those people. They ain&#39;t no\n&gt; good. Why, you&#39;ll take them and they&#39;ll just hate\n&gt; you. They&#39;ll spit on you, curse you and kill you.\n&gt; You don&#39;t want those people!!&quot;\n&gt; &quot;How much? He asked again.\n&gt; Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, &quot;All your blood,\n&gt; tears and your life.&quot;\n&gt; Jesus said, &quot;DONE!&quot; Then He paid the price.\n&gt; The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and\n&gt; he walked from the pulpit.\n\n\n"}}
