If what he said \n&gt; was true, then what could this group offer her? She\n&gt; wondered what \n&gt; could they give her for what she could offer them?\n&gt; She knew that she \n&gt; had all the codes and information from the\n&gt; Cybertronian Predacon \n&gt; Council.  But what could they give her? The only\n&gt; thing she could \n&gt; think of was a safe place to stay untill she could\n&gt; figure out \n&gt; something. For now, what safety they offered was\n&gt; needed. She looked \n&gt; at Devilduer. She noticed from his actions, he was a\n&gt; seasoned \n&gt; warrior. ANd if the others were anything like him,\n&gt; they could give \n&gt; her the protection she needed. She wondered if they\n&gt; would ever think \n&gt; to ask about what she knew. Then she wondered just\n&gt; how much she would \n&gt; tell them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nThousands of Stores.  Millions of Products.
