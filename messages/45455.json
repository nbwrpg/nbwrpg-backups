Anachronox could.\n&gt; \n&gt; The large bot inside the renewal chamber twitched, then started to \n&gt; move. Inside the chamber, Anachronox&#39; eyes opened to a blurry \nworld. \n&gt; His vision quickly clear and he realized that there was simply a \n&gt; barrier between him and the what was beyond.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving his arm, he bumps the covering. A tapping sound can be heard \n&gt; on the outside. Anachronox frowns, glancing downward, he spots his \n&gt; legs and slams one knee forward into the shell with no result other \n&gt; that a heavy thud. Starting to become frustrated, his arms and legs \n&gt; simultaneously hit the shell, this time the thud reverbrates around \n&gt; in nearby rooms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deciding that alternate approach to freedom was necessary, his legs \n&gt; tense up, and four spikes lance outward, piercing the shell loud \n&gt; crack. A fracture line appears moving up the shell to the upper \n&gt; torso area. Anachronox smiles at this, &lt;a little more&gt; he thinks, \n&gt; &lt;just a little more&gt;. The spikes retract, then slam outward again, \n&gt; this time shattering the lower portion of the shell and suficiently \n&gt; weakening the top half. Glass shards are sprayed everywhere. \n&gt; Anachronx then uses his upper body to spray the remaining piece of \n&gt; the shell away from him and towards the unfortunate bot Belthassan \n&gt; who was standing in front of the once complete renewal chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking his first steps, Anachronox pushes himself out, and crouches \n&gt; as best he can on the shard covered floor. Apparently oblivious to \n&gt; the other bot he observs his surroundings, face pointing downward \n&gt; and still in crouch. His hematite black form shivers as he flexes \n&gt; his techno-organic muscles, and twists his arms testing out his \n&gt; form. &lt;I have just been created... or have I? I can remember \nthings, \n&gt; but I am not in the memories...&gt; His thoughts are of confusion but \n&gt; he appears statuesque as he ponders this question. He only utters \n&gt; one word, &quot;Anachronox...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Daemos: No, not for now. If you allow me, I will attend to those \n&gt; &gt; difficulties and contact you as soon as I am done. Shadow Destiny \n&gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A few moments later, Belthassan heard a loud scream. Knowing \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt; was wrong, he ran to the Renewal Chamber. When he arrived, he saw \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; large form of the robot, though he did not recognize him. \nHowever, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; had his idea on the matter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan: Firedrill? Is that you?\n\n\n"}}
