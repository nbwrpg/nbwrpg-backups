My name is Airshadow\n\nStarice::\n\nStarice had the sharped sigh=\r\nt of a owl (In fact her beast mode was a \nsnow owl). She was worried for he=\r\nr friend Condor when something \ncaught her attention. She took her beast mo=\r\nde, took off and tried to \nfind out what was... She landed close to the lit=\r\ntle thing and her \nsurprice was big when she saw that it was a cibertronian=\r\n baby-girl.\nStarice changed to robot mode.\n\n&quot;A baby? here?&quot; said surpriced =\r\nStarice while she knees down  to see \nher better, she took the baby in arms=\r\n, Starice didn&#39;t know what to do \nwith the baby.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Moo=\r\nn Mist&quot; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; BB: Sorry I haven&#39;t been online=\r\n. My cabin burnt and my computer \nwent with \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3 days ago BrightBl=\r\nade had died of a disease  in the forests \nsurrounding the \n&gt; Cybertronean =\r\nFire, her body left to rot with the surrounding leafs.\n&gt; But even her death=\r\n wasn&#39;t for nothing. She&#39;d died after days and \nnights of \n&gt; hard labor, tr=\r\nying to keep her little treasure alive.\n&gt; Somehow, someway, her systems had=\r\n created a child that had grown \ninside of \n&gt; her until, at the weakest poi=\r\nnt, it was born.\n&gt; A blind, tiny kit that could fit in the palm of a human =\r\nhand, a \nbaby girl \n&gt; with a mother already diseased and ready to die.\n&gt; An=\r\nd so she had, leaving the baby to suckle whatever milk was left \nin her \n&gt; =\r\nbody before she stopped producing and it dried up.\n&gt; But now the milk was g=\r\none, BrightBlade&#39;s body already beginning to \nrot, and \n&gt; the little baby s=\r\nlightly weak from malnutrition.\n&gt; Tiny as she was, still so young and blind=\r\n, she&#39;d managed to hang on \nthis \n&gt; long with a hungry tummy. Every sound c=\r\nausing her to whine and cry, \nlittle \n&gt; yipps filling the forest whenever t=\r\nhe wind picked up.  Too young to \nbe \n&gt; frightened, all she ever did was cr=\r\nawl around her mother&#39;s body, \nurged close \n&gt; by her familiar scent even wh=\r\nen hunger gnawed.\n&gt; But today the rank smell of BrightBlade&#39;s body masked h=\r\ner scent and \nthe \n&gt; little kit was confused, bleating for her mother as sh=\r\ne slowly \ncrawled on \n&gt; her tummy away from the body, trying to find the sm=\r\nell of Mom.\n&gt; She moved out towards the forest and the clearing beyond.\n&gt; B=\r\neing only 3 days old, her muscles worked in tiny spasms and she \ncouldn&#39;t \n=\r\n&gt; control them beyond crawling, but always she was yipping and crying \nout,=\r\n \n&gt; hoping for mother to hear her and come and get her. Remembering the \nfu=\r\nrry \n&gt; side where life giving milk came from.\n&gt; But her mother never came a=\r\nnd she was getting cold, her tummy \nmaking little \n&gt; hungry sounds.\n&gt; Even =\r\nthough her eyes weren&#39;t open yet she could hear, and she shots \ncoming \n&gt; f=\r\nrom the clearing reminded her of the soft rumbles her mother made. \nSo, \n&gt; =\r\nthinking of her mother, she cried louder as she tried to hurry her \ncrawlin=\r\ng, \n&gt; little red coat spotted here and there with ash as she moved along \nt=\r\nhe \n&gt; forest floor. Moving towards the battle at the maximal base. \nCoverin=\r\ng no \n&gt; more then 1-=BD feet in 2 min.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________=\r\n________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mai=\r\nl from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
