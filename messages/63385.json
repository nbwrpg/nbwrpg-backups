He tilted his head to match the tilt of hers, wondering what she meant when she said he needed maintence.  He figured she meant whatever she felt in his neck.  He smiles as she took his hand, and they started off to the bot in question.  He closed his hand around hers and smiled.\n \n&quot;You might not believe this much, but this body was constructed in an organic fashion to conserve power.  You could say I have muscles.  I guess you felt them in my neck.  I&#39;m not totally this way, the muscle sections in my chest and waist are meant to section for transformation, and I use nanobots for repairs and system maintence.&quot;\n \nHe reached over and took her other hand and put it on his right upper arm, to feel the somewhat soft and forgiving exterior and the synthetic muscles in his arm.\n\nDark Mouse &lt;raccoon7679@...&gt; wrote:\nWolfblade:\n\nShe chuckled softly, &quot;Yeah, I suppose we had better get going.&quot;  Her\nspark almost skipped a beat when he kissed her cheek.  Her hands were\nresting on his shoulders as they stood there for a moment. Her optics\nmoved slightly to glance at his neck when she felt what she thought\nwas a slight twinge in his neck. Still mezmerized by him, her optics\nrefocused on his.  She felt absolute calm at that moment. All in the\nuniverse was well. Just him and her and that&#39;s all that mattered. Even\nin that perfect peace, she felt her spark start to break. She couldn&#39;t\nshow it to him, nor would she. She leaned up and kissed his lips\nagain. &quot;Come on, we should get going. Oh, and when we get back, I\nthink you may need a tune up.&quot;  She tilted her head to the side. The\nsame side his neck had twinged at. &quot;Or if you want, I can try to fix\nit later on. Perhaps back at my quarters?&quot; she said in a playful tone. \nShe let her hands glide down his shoulders and down his arms until her\nhands met his.  She let her right arm go and still held his right hand\nwith her left.  She stood there hoping they might walk the rest of the\nway hand in hand. She did however wonder why a bot&#39;s neck hydrolics\nwould move like that. His body was acting more like an organic in that\nrespect and less like a bot. \n\n\n&quot;HA!  Is that all you got?  You boasted such power, such skill!  Where is your power and skill now?  You disappoint me, ha ha ha haa!&quot; \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
