He knew he was out of \noptions, if he turned to robot mode he&#39;d collapse into stasis lock do \nto the shot he&#39;d taken in the gut. There were no options open to him \nexcept take a chance on auto pilot. &quot;Computer return me to Veratis&#39; \nposition.&quot; The computer came to life and carried him skyward. the \nonly drawback to using the computer was that the coordinates would \nautomatically be relayed through the maximal network including the \none on the CF. Lunarpines wounds were still healing, to bad they \nweren&#39;t healing faster. He really wanted to find the trainers base \nand put an end to them. He opened his comm to Ramulus &quot;If theres a \ntracker available you might want to send it into the mountains to \ntrack Slayer.&quot; he caught his breath. &quot;Slayer left a trail of mech \nfluid long enough for a blindbot to follow, I&#39;m going offline for a \nbit, My destination&#39;s in the computer, I&#39;ll be back when I can.&quot; He \nsigned off and sat in the control seat.\n\nMeanwhile Veratis watched the screen to see what the virus was doing \nto Shadow Wings body. he&#39;d taken away most of the signs that she was \na translifeform. It was as if he&#39;d created a new breed of translife. \nthe way the matrix had intended. He smiled a sly grin and held back a \nsinister laugh. The words came to him again, &quot;Till all are one&quot; He \nstepped back, suddenly seeing what exactly the words meant, Translife \nand nature would become one and this freak before him was the \nbeginning.\n\nFoxfingers curled up in the corner of his forcefield away from any \nsecurity cameras. To anyone watching he would appear to have given up \nand curled up in fear. Not this bot though. He&#39;d been through tougher \nsituations, escaping this one would be a piece of datacake. He slowly \nremoved his cutting torch from his side and began to use it on the \nfloor. He&#39;d soon be free to roam, but with the information he&#39;d just \nuncovered he&#39;d have to escape and report his findings to Veratis and \nthe Maximals if they&#39;d listen to him after the stunt he&#39;d pulled back \non the CF. &quot;Theres not a forcefield that can hold me.&quot; he thought as \nhis torch cut through the floor.\n\nNearby a spider watched curiosly as the foxbot attempted his escape. \nThe foxbots key to survival was escape, the spider anylized the \npossability and knew that it wasn&#39;t right for it&#39;s kind. Long as the \npredacons didn&#39;t know that some spiders were still active they could \nstill survive. \n\n\n"}}
