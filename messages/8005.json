He enter Statius lock.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSniper continued running from the base. He was getting slagged\nbaddly. \nSniper continued running till he was outside of the ark. He was about \nto walk in when those autoguns fired on him. Sniper backed up till he \nwas out of range. He looked threw his scope until he spotted the \nentrance to the base. There Were no bots coming out. Odd. Sniper sent \na transmission to the ark. &quot;Hello, anybody there.&quot; (NOTE:Sniper \ndoesn&#39;t know they moverd to the CF. I&#39;m not sure if anybody is \npatrolling the ark or not. So if I dont hear a responce later today,\nI \nwill guess no one at the ark.)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOinker opens the door to the brig with his gun drawn, &quot;Ennybody in \nhyar.&quot;\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\n(Now to address this &quot;Firestorm&quot; You calling me a moding piece of \ncrap. You don&#39;t even now half of what happen while you were gone. So \nyou are making assumtions of something wrong when it might not be \nwroung because we were in a certain postion before you came. And here \nis a suggetion. Don&#39;t go complaining when you just join. Not a good \nimpression. Also you are moding to, I believe. If I am thinking\nright, \nyour character landed then walk right up to the Predacon base and is \ncontroling their autoguns, without even being acepted into the \nPredacon rank yet. YOU ARE NOT ON THE PREDACON FRIEND LIST, SO THE \nAUTOGUNS WOULD FIRE ON YOU, THEY WOULDN&#39;T LISTEN TO YOUR CHARACTER.\nTo \nall that had to sit there and read another complaint, I am truly \nsorry, but I needed to reply, because, If I didn&#39;t some of you would \nthink that I am a Scardy Cat, which I am not.)\n\n\n"}}
