He growled in mind speak ::Diablo, \nTransform!::\n\nHis Bot mode Dark Blue and Midnight Black. He legs are strong, and \nsturdy, supporting a spike at the knee which can be driven into \nopponents. His chest is plain, rippled with muscles, leading to his \narms which at the elbows have another two spikes. His face remains \nthe same, except for the fact the fur gives way to dark blue metal \nand the stalk eyes vanish.\n\nDiablo took out his scythe with his left hand and a huge machine gun \nin his right. The machine gun had poison loaded darts that would \nexplode on contact. He fired off 25 poison bullets at WindLord.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightlight&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; ::Windlord::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I figured that...&quot; replied the hawk and he took off in robot mode \n&gt; and pointed his feathers-missiles towards Devil and shot.\n\n\n"}}
