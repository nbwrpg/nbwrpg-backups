Full internal scanners \n&gt; as well as radar keeping tabs of as many as possible and stealth raised to \n&gt; keep her from being detected. The joys of being a full, proper Decepticon. \n&gt; It was equipment that she once had like this she missed utilizing. By now, \n&gt; she was a master at it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Keeping out of visual range of anyone for the time being however, she was \n&gt; keeping visual tabs upon the location where Hydras and the others were now \n&gt; located.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My dear MAxima, still there?&quot; came the voice over her comm system from \n&gt; Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, I am here,&quot; she replied.

The gates were flanked by several more drones, these\n&gt;&gt; looking like that had some sort of helicoptor altmode, who barely even\n&gt;&gt; glanced at them as they passed by. Overhead twin predacon jets, the\n&gt;&gt; same two that had been circling over the city, took off to make a\n&gt;&gt; wider circle around the city. Meanwhile a dark colored shuttle of some\n&gt;&gt; sort passed over head heading into the city, although what it was was\n&gt;&gt; difficult to make out with the dull haze of smog that blanketed the\n&gt;&gt; city.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;This way.&quot; Tankor said with only the slightest glanced upward at the\n&gt;&gt; sudden spate of airtraffic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Inside the city it seemed like there were many drones of all different\n&gt;&gt; sorts. most of them looked like drones made from the constructicons:\n&gt;&gt; Dumptrucks, cranes, bulldozers and all sorts made thier way through\n&gt;&gt; the city. The buildings did not seem to be in the best of shape, most\n&gt;&gt; of them covered in dark soot and some sort of brown dust, and while\n&gt;&gt; stable look like they have been barely maintained, some of them had\n&gt;&gt; obviously been abandoned and then pressed into some other service.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tankor He began leading them towards what was obviously the security\n&gt;&gt; building, and even it seemed like it had once been somethng else, but\n&gt;&gt; now had been pressed into this new service. As they moved several\n&gt;&gt; figures peered out at them from dark alleyways, only thier optics\n&gt;&gt; being dimly seen, but at a glance from Tankor or one of his drones\n&gt;&gt; they fled back into hiding.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Empties.&quot; Injector said as he walked, his face turned into distaste.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;They were on Cybertron before too.
