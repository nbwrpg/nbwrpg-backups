Yawn.  That felt good.  I&#39;ll be fine I have a bit of energy to\n&gt; spare.  I need so much energy because of my shall we say interesting\n&gt; physiology.  The changing forms takes a lot of energy because my\ntransforming\n&gt; protocols are a bit haywire.  But the extra energy comes in handy\nsometimes\n&gt; so I think I like the way I am.&quot;  He looks around and sees Gramps holding\nthe\n&gt; frog.  &quot;So you&#39;re choosing your forms now good.  Our group is getting\nquite\n&gt; large isn&#39;t it Windlord.  Too many more people join us and we&#39;ll need to\ncome\n&gt; up with a name for it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
