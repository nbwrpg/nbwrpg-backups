He chuckled \nat Dark Mouse. &quot;He never met Hell Beast. Th&#39; only bot he ever came in \ncontact wit&#39; was me.&quot; He turned and made a short whistling noise to \nTerrorsaur&#39;s direction. He waved the red flier over to him. He lifted his \nhead, and flew over to him reluctantly. He transformed to robot mode in \nfront of him and folded his arms.\n\n&quot;Ah got uh job fer ya,&quot; Quickstrike said. &quot;Ah want ya t&#39; go t&#39; these \ncoordinates and find uh bot named Rowdy Wolf. He&#39;s uh big dang bot wit&#39; furs \nall over &#39;im. Ya can&#39;t miss &#39;im.&quot; He handed Terrorsaur the paper with the \ncoordinates. &quot;Ya might find &#39;im by his cave. It&#39;s north of th&#39; last marker, \npast uh dead long tree. There&#39;s uh whole bunch of rocks, hills and boulders \nnear there. But keep yer eye out on &#39;im. He&#39;ll shoot ya.&quot; Terrorsaur&#39;s brows \nlowered on him. &quot;Jus&#39; say ya know me an&#39; we need him here, then you&#39;ll be \nfine.&quot;\n\nQuickstrike nodded his head to the side and waved him off.\n\nTerrorsaur studied the coordinates for a moment. He gave a glance at him. He \nhad a feeling the flier knew it was a long trip. He watched as the flier \ntook off.\n\nQuickstrike turned his body back to Dark Mouse. &quot;How long do you think uh \ntrip like that might take uh flier? Two days? It took me four days fer me t&#39; \nget back from there.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
