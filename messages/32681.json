It was unfortunate, in yet; at least the grenade launcher was unable to be used as of now.  However, on another fact, FireBlade�s sword functioned perfectly. As Dinobot was to know for a second time. Though he was ready for another attack like such he stood fast and remained in his position.  The reason being, his armor was flame retardant and even while it had melted circuits before, the last attack had been from inside.  Charging his optic laser once again, he glared past the blade of FireBlade and at the optics mounted on his face. Peering at him for one brief second yet only seeing a shell without any life source worth keeping alive. The old warrior was back.  \r\nStriking quickly his laser was set off, in yet, aimed at the hand in which held the sword, which was more annoying then, anything and the first to be dealt with. However, once fired it recharged with a paralysis stream and systems reconfigured the striking relay to emit a wider beam, one that would hit more then one area.  It was unavoidable, FireBlade�s attack. Dinobot stood too close to avoid them but his own shell would take most of the damage while his spark and internals remained safe and intacted.  However, while the enemy was concentrating upon his own attach, the reptile minded his own. The optic sight glow red for less then a second before firing the paralysis beam at the leg and torso area of FireBlade but not before 6 of the 10 shots fired at him weakened the tolerance of his super structure. **\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
