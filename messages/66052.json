This was not a\nbustlin=\r\ng place like Relay, a fortress like Olympus or a haven of\nprosperity as Atl=\r\nantis. Pentatron certainly wasn&#39;t an easy place for a\nnice girl, but it was=\r\n alright. She had never been a nice girl. She had\nnever known how to.\n\nShe =\r\nhad not been caught by the police when she had sucked that young\nbot&#39;s spar=\r\nk. The rush had allowed her, after some time, to alter her\nappearance enoug=\r\nh so to disappear for a while. She had changed back,\nbut by then, she was r=\r\noaming the streets, fighting off the urge,\nsometimes against her better jud=\r\ngement. The more you resisted, the\nworse it would be when she gave in - one=\r\n way or another.\n\nCreep. That was how the hoboes referred to her. It made h=\r\ner smile with\na clutching sadness. Somehow, she felt it was the right name =\r\nfor her. \n\nShe was dragging herself through the city at that point. She was=\r\n\ngetting weaker, which was not a good sign, and she was halfway through\na b=\r\nig boulevard. Too many people, too many lights, away, away with\nyou! She wa=\r\ns sleepy, no, please, don&#39;t close your eyes! Just... Just\na... little... bi=\r\nt.\n\nShe passed out. Energon surge. Nothing serious, technically speaking,\nb=\r\nut people have a way of panigking when things aren&#39;t as they should\nbe. A r=\r\ning of bots circled her in no time, and later on, an ambulance\npicked her u=\r\np and brought her to a gorvernment medcenter.\n\nOOC: Could someone play tech=\r\ns and wake her up, plz?\n\n\n"}}
