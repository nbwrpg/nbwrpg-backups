It was stupidity, but courage as\n&gt; well. But this was his mission. And he was done with it. It was time\n&gt; to give it to another. He held back Child.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No Child. This is what I must do. The cycle has come full circle.\n&gt; You haven&#39;t been realizing it, but you&#39;ve been training yourself. I\n&gt; thought my purpose was too free Cybertron, but I was wrong. That is\n&gt; your job, Child. My job was to guide and look after. And now it&#39;s\n&gt; done. Go to your father Child. Tell him I apologize for keepig him\n&gt; from you. Tell him of everything that has happened here. If the\n&gt; Skyschorchers and the new three want to go with you, they can, but\n&gt; they are not obligated to. Tell Battera and Cybershark the same. They\n&gt; are finally free. I just wish I could have said goodbye properly.&quot; He\n&gt; put a bubble of energy around all the others on his side.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This will take you out of the mountain safely. I am taking the evil\n&gt; ones away with me. Most of them will rot in the pitt forever. If they\n&gt; survive, than they will no that Peace conquers evil. Good-bye my\n&gt; friends. I hope to see you all in The Matrix some day.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He made the bubble disapear, and it reapeared just outside the\n&gt; mountain. He sent a quick thought into all of their minds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Go quickly now. There isn&#39;t much time. I love you all .good-bye&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turned his attention to the evil ones.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now you will all pay for the things that you have commited.&quot; Vulois\n&gt; channeled every last piece of energy he had into one system. When he\n&gt; set it off, the explosion would be hideous, &quot;There is no time for\n&gt; escape now. Computer, 5 second count down to self-destruct.\n&gt; Begin....now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As the seconds ticked away, so did Vulois&#39; life.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                           5....4...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
