By throwing the rocks with \nher beak she&#39;d lost much of her accuracy. It landed about three feet \nto his left. By hiding herself in the foliage she&#39;d given up most of \nher flying advantages. How to get up to where she was on the other \nhand, was Lunarpines main disadvantage. She thought out her strategy \nwell this time. If he could teach her to use those skills in a real \nbattle she would easily survive every time.\n\n&quot;If I&#39;d wanted to fight rocks then I wouldn&#39;t have needed a sparring \npartner. So Come out and fight you overstuffed hummingbird.&quot; he was \nhoping to rattle her nerves, make her stop thinking for a few \nseconds. A wolf can&#39;t climb trees, but a bot can, all he needed was \nfor her to lose her temper and give him an opening.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Gee thanks)\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She stayed in the tree.
