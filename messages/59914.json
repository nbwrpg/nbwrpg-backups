He wadded about knee \n&gt; &gt; deep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and absorbed the heat so he would not melt or warp his legs.  \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a hand full of the heavy thick stuff, and drew the heat out, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a solid mass.  He then dipped it into the lava, pulled it \nout, \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeated the process until it was halfway up his chest after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles.
