He looked into her \neyes as she sheathed her sword and stepped behind him. He definetly \ndidn&#39;t want her to be afraid of him. He loved her. He couldn&#39;t \nbelieve he had let anger take over.\n\nShame and regret now rose up to his mind. He was ashamed at how he \nlet the anger flow, and regretful at how he made Iron Raptor feel.\n\n-I&#39;m sorry, love,- he thinks to her, -I didn&#39;t mean to feel that way, \nI reall didn&#39;t.-\n\nProwl looks at Shadow. He would get to fight him, yes. But \nconsidering how he got the privelage, this battle was not going to be \ngood. The Maximal was ready to fight, his metallic body standing tall.\n\n-Do you think we should get this battle over with or get to the \nCybertronian Fire?- he thinks to Iron Raptor, keeping his eyes on \nShadow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Now, with her mind in more controle of her body she suddenly \nrecieved \n&gt; something that made her nearly drop her sword.\n&gt; The...intensity of Prowls anger, and the realizations of what she \nhad done \n&gt; just now.\n&gt; She had just done what she had given Prowl slag for less then 30 \ncycles ago. \n&gt; Interfering with battle.\n&gt; But it was so harsh, almost as bad as hate!\n&gt; But it effected her in rather a way that was surprising.\n&gt; She felt...felt afraid of him...felt...sad.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, right there and then she simply lifted her sword, rather slowly \nlike a \n&gt; dog who just got cought at something, and shethed it.\n&gt; Standing straight the looking back towards Prowl before she simply \nbacked \n&gt; uop behind him, her shoulders clearly slumped.\n&gt; It felt...so intense that she felt almost as if she didn&#39;t belong.\n&gt; It was wierd, how this body reacted to feelings.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
