We would be rid of both at once, not having to forsake a\nsingle bot on the venture.  If only there was a way to con those goody\ngoodies into believing that self sacrifice was the only way.

Someone\ncould perhaps sneak into thier base and reprogram thier cr chambers.\nInserting a program to which they must obey and in killing Unicron get\nthemselves killed in the process. Killing two bots with one shot, as\nit were.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What?&quot;said interested Hydras\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
