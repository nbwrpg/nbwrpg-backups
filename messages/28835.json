Striker had been a good friend and \ncommander, and Mantle was sad to discover that most of his old team \nwas gone. Behind him, Aqua put a hand on Cinder&#39;s shoulder. Cinder&#39;s \neyes were starting to fill with tears.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that one&#39;s name?&quot; Mantle asks Iron Raptor. Prowl&#39;s body, no \nlonger fueled by the emotions of Iron Raptor&#39;s second beast mode, \nreverts into his robot mode, the mechfluid-stained armor glinting in \nthe sun.\n\n&quot;Prowl!&quot; Cinder exclaims, running forward and kneeling near Prowl, \ntrying to take him into her arms.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMantle walks forward to near Iron Raptor, watching Cinder kneeling \nnear Prowl.\n\n&quot;Is there any way me and my group can help around here?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor shook her head and walked over to Prowl, looking down \nat him \n&gt; and waiting for the SBM to ware off now that she had removed hers.\n&gt; She looked back at the group, slightly surprised when Mantle came \nforward.\n&gt; So...there was another Maximals gestalt, how nice. It was good to \nhave more \n&gt; heavy hitters on the team.\n&gt; But what they wanted to know...the answer probably wasn&#39;t what they \nwanted \n&gt; to hear.\n&gt; Iron Raptor bent down to take Prowl&#39;s head in her arms, hoping that \nhe \n&gt; didn&#39;t wake up and suddenly bite her arm off.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Um...I hate to tell you this but Striker and his group don&#39;t \nexist \n&gt; anymore.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She heaved, trying to lift Prowls head.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This...&quot; she gestured to Prowl. &quot; This is the last of his crew \nand he was \n&gt; attacking me but nothing I couldn&#39;t have stopped.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
