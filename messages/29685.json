Inside, the little red robot in the control chair gets flung back\nout of the chair and against the larger robot who is trying to put out the\nfires with liquid nitrogen. The two collide, and land in the stream of\nLiquid Nitrogen, being frozen in the beam. The little blue robot presses\nthe button on the control pad to keep the emergency message playing at\nintervals, and just as he presses it, he is flung up against and engine\nwall, his back being seriously burnt, and a sickening thud can be heard as\nhis head hits metal, and rips apart.\n\nThe ship then makes hard impact with the ground, and leaves a huge running\ncrater as it moves forward, through the earth. It then runs to a stop, and\nthe back of it explodes violently, sending pieces of burning shrapnel miles\naround. The two frozen robots get thrown violently, and the larger ones\ncasing shatters, as his arm goes with it, he weakly looks up, and then\ncolapses. Everything turns silent, except for the repeating message,\n&quot;emergency, our ship is out of control, we will require assistance, and\nmore than likely,\nrepairs when we crash&quot;.\n\n\n\n"}}
