Windlord chuckled watching \nMalice as baby sitter and he said &quot;Well this little fierce and cute \nfox, is Camoflage&quot;said while he took ibn arms at Cam&quot;The youngest \nmembers of Maximals and this little one&quot;said while he looked to \nElita &quot;It&#39;s elita, daugher of our leader, Rodimus Prime and \nNighlight&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice looked down at the bot that walked in.  he shifted Elita to \nthe crook of one arm and picked up Camoflage with the other.  He \nheld her in the crook of that arm so she could see everyone.\n&gt; &quot;Elita, Camoflage, this is my half sister Organics.  She came all \nthe way here to see little ol&#39; me.&quot;\n&gt; Organics grinned.  He somehow remained the same after three \ncenturies.  Not just in personality, but his, and her own face \nlooked almost exactly the way it did three hundred years later.  She \npushed all the rumors about his temper and ruthlessness aside, they \ncouldn&#39;t possibly be true.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Could they?\n&gt; &quot;Hello little ones.  As Neutronics said, I&#39;m Organics.&quot;\n&gt; She stepped a litle closer and inspected the children Malice was \ncarrying.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, they&#39;re so cute!  Are they yours?&quot; she asked as innocently as \nshe could.\n&gt; Malice stars at his sister with a blank stare for a moment.  \n&gt; &quot;WHAT?  OF COURSE NOT!  I just happen to be baby sitting, that&#39;s \nall!&quot;\n&gt; Malice had been in an incredibly good mood as of late, but his \nsister knew which button to push.  But she also knew how to make it \nup to him, too.\n&gt; &quot;Oh don&#39;t be so grouchy.  Here, I&#39;ll take care of these two so you \nand your new lady friend can do what ever you were before.&quot; she \nsaid, holding out here ams.\n&gt; Malice looked at the children in is arms.\n&gt; &quot;Well, what do you two want?  Stay with me or go and play with \nher?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; \n&gt; She ran through the corridors and outside.  \n&gt; A short time later, she went back inside with a big look of relief \non her face plates.  She went back to Malice&#39;s room and saw the \nother bots there. &quot;What&#39;d I miss?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; She had seen Camoflage run out and walk back in. She chuckled to \nherself as she went to the lab. &quot;Well, at least the little one is \nhouse broken.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Their defenses are broken!
