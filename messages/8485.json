She flew to a tall \ntree and perched.  She could fly, but barely.  She knew she was out \nof this one for a bit. She sat on the branch watching the fluid run \nout of her wing.  She yelled at the Anubis, &quot;JERK!&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSpears:: \nShe was hit and the blast knocked her around. In that spiked ballm \nshe was able to take more damage than in her bot form.  But that last \nblast hurt a lot.  She rolled to behind a rock.  She transformed into \nbot mode and checked the damage. A lot of her quills were damaged, \nshe had cuts and small gashes on her legs and arms.  Her chest and \ntorso was relatively OK.  She pulled out a quill. She threw it at \nHades, aiming for his chest.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Anubis/Hades/Predator/Choran/Serpentor:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anubis fired two optic blasts off at the fying Shadow Wing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hades chuckled, jumping into the air several feet high, landing to \nthe \n&gt; ground, Spears missing him.
