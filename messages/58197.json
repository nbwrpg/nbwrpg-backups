He transformed to \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sturdy looking robot mode and looked around. The air was \nclear \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fresh. This was a virgin planet, untouched by the ravages of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civilization... yet. The Cybertronians posed a great threat \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It had to be dealt with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would be Lunekill&#39;s job. For now, he wanted to examine \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Energon&#39;s quality. He lifted his fist in the air and took \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; momentum. He punched through the rocks and straight into a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deposit. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, he grasped a big chunk of crystaline energon and took \nit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Appraising it like a jewel-crafter looking at a finely cut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diamond, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he lifted it to his mouth and engulfed it whole.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reaction was instantaneous and astonishing. It coursed \n&gt; &gt; through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him as a power surge, making him feel like a powerhouse. Oh, \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love this sensation of power! It was the first time he had \never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experienced something as strong as this! It did not stop \nhere, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though, as he would have expected. The surge built in him \nuntil \n&gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could no longer hold it back, then, with a crackling of \nstatic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electricity, he literally blew the top of the mountain off. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no longer control his power surge! His feelings were \namplified \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tenfolds. He was enraged!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No use for Lunekill, the Cybertronians would have to die now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He flew away and, sensing a group of Predacons, stopped. He \n&gt; &gt; lifted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double pulse gun and fired, again and again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rockseeker: Die, you oversized crawlers!\n\n\n"}}
