But when he had exclaimed with concern about her damaged back she simply looked away and into the surrounding forest, it was no real threat to her and the bleeding had begun to clot.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m alright.&quot;\n\n* She also had no real desire to transform into her Beast Mode, she wanted to remain in robot mode until she returned to base.\nIron Raptor then looked back at Prowl but then looked beyond him and into the distance, he might be angry that she didn&#39;t transform and begin internal repairs and she didn&#39;t have that spark at the moment to face him.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
