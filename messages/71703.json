Whoever attacked=\r\n the Fuzors may return to try and finish the job.  I have full faith in tha=\r\nt you will make them think twice before attempting it. &quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Before anyth=\r\ning else, Tucson gives Talon a tender embrace and a soft kiss on her forehe=\r\nad.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot; No matter what happens, I will always love you.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He then =\r\nturns to Silverbolt, kneels down and gently takes him into his arms.

I will f=\r\nly Silverbolt back to the Ark and I will inform Stanton and Bump of your lo=\r\ncation and the state of the other Fuzors.  Also, be sure Noctorro gets his =\r\nrest, he needs it.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He turns to the mouth of the cave and stops to li=\r\nsten to the activities of the skies.  He narrows a brow and looks to Silver=\r\nbolt with a bit of a heavy heart.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot; I can&#39;t waste time, I won&#39;t let y=\r\nou die, it&#39;s not your time.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He looks back to Torca and Airhammer.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &quot; Keep safe, my friends, keep safe.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; With his words he dashes out=\r\n of the cave, extends his wings and decides to  fly fast in robot mode, wit=\r\nh Silverbolt in tow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Aug 16, 2011, at 6:37 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;  wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson follows the beacon and scopes out a=\r\n place to land safely.
