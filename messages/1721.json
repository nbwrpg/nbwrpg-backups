She was used to bots sneaking up behind her but she had no clue as to what he was saying.\nProtect who? Teltoli?*\n\n&quot; What in the Pit are you talking about?&quot;\n\n* She said this in a whisper so that the other bots wouldn&#39;t hear but she kept a firm and constant glare on Tritan.*\n\n**********************\n\n* Dinobot looked up at Tavatron as she had transformed, she looked some what rested and refreshed.\nHe looked away towards the Ark&#39;s doors but then looked at the shoulder in which Tavatron&#39;s paw had rested only moments before, he growled and flexed his claws...he never did like being touched!\nHe quickly snapped his head back and moved his snout a considerable distance from Tavatron&#39;s, he didn&#39;t like even being near another bot for no particular reason as well...a cold fact since he had grown to accept that he was never comfortable with being TO close to somebot.\nDinobot was about to decline to Tavatron&#39;s offer to join her for a meal when his stomach lurched and suddenly began to crave something to dig his fangs into, he snarled and slowly rose to his feet.\nHe shook his body to get the crinks and stiffness out of his frame, there was no point in even moving if it was to move stiffly.\nNot to mention that it could also slow and limit a bot&#39;s abilities in battle, a circumstance that could lead straight to death.\nDinobot looked down at his clawed hands and flexed his digits, his stomach rumbled again and complained more loudly of it being empty.\nHe hadn&#39;t eaten that last time he had had a chance, perhaps it would be wise for him to accept Tavatron&#39;s offer before his stomach acids began to work on his internals!\nDinobot looked off towards the doors again, he had promised earlier that he would rest and feed himself...obviously now was the time to fulfill that promise.\nHe looked back at Tavatron but the thought of the taste of food cubes almost seemed to make him sick, his stomach craved the blood and meat of real food...not artificial!\nDinobot gestured towards the doors of the Ark with his snout, their real meal laid out there in the wild. A meal that was now living and breathing as they stood there, a meal that could give the thrill of the chase when hunted.\nThat was what a meal was to him, not some clear square object that tasted like styrofoam!\nHis stomach rumbled again as he stood there, but he was almost hungry enough to eat anything!\nDinobot nodded slightly, whatever kept him alive...he guessed.*\n\n&quot; The suggestion is acceptable.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
