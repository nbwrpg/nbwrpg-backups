I am currently \ndesigning \n&gt; charachters. Besides if your only reason is to go on the council is \nto \n&gt; promote your own ideas then that is a selfish idea. However my \nreasons for \n&gt; wanting to be on the council is to better the RPG and I have a \nfeeling that \n&gt; from talking with them that the coucil understands this. And as for \nme \n&gt; banning you? You arent me so don&#39;t say what I will do when you \ndon&#39;t know how \n&gt; I think. Whenever you get flamed you make comments like that that \nattract \n&gt; them. By all right I have a reason to flame you now but I choose \nnot to. But \n&gt; I would also like to point out to the RPG that whenever you make an \nOOC \n&gt; comment almost all contain some derogatory remark about me, which \nquite \n&gt; frankly I am getting sick of.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Qs7\n\n\n"}}
