St. Hilary. \n\nAs soon as she arrived, she landed at the base of the mountain. The volcano \nwas now dormant. Which was a good thing. \n\nShe glanced about, making sure no one was around. As well as scouting the \nterrain. It was slightly different than in the late 20th & early 21st \ncenturies. But.. nonetheless, this was the spot. \n\nShe strode forward & made her way into a cavern, small at the moment, that \nwould eventually serve as the main enterance. \n\nIt was truly odd to just waltz right in on the Ark. She was use to the fact \nthat there were heavy defenses in the area. Ahhh.. the good old days. It was \nsomething she missed. She smiled at the memory. \n\nTrudging further into the cavern, she soon enough came to the ark itself. \n\nStopping a moment, she gazed. She was so close. \n\nMoving further as she soon enough entered the Ark. \n\nThe light was barely there, using her animal like senses, she made her way to \nthe Teletran console. Not as crafty as old Wheeljack or Ratchet, who knew \nTeletran well enough... she still needed to find a way to boost this place. \n\nSensing the bodies everywhere, it nearly sickened her. But, she toughened up \nquickly enough as she reached Teletran 1. \n\nSensing her way around, she fiddled with the console, trying to find out \nwhich fuse or switch or whatever would help to kick on the infrared or the \nphoton lights all together. \n\nAfter a little tinkering, the lights flickered, then came on. She smiled, \n&quot;Success.&quot; \n\nShe continued to tinker with Teletran 1, seeing what she could do to \npartially put it back online. Defenses were important. As much as she hated \nthe Autobots, she could care less about the Autobot inhabitants,... but it \nwas her Decepticon comrades she was more concerned with. \n\nAfter a little time, Teletran 1 came up partially. Blinking on, then tried to \nspeak, &quot;Welco-...Dang-...Intrud-....Urgg-- Yaw-... Wuurrr-... Gggirrr-...&quot; \n\nGlancing up at the huge viewscreen as the screen flickered, then glancing \nback & focusing on the task as she hot wired & spliced, doing the best she \ncould with the little resources she had. \n\nFinally... &quot;Searching.... Systems online... Defenses down...&quot; in that \nfamiliar voice. \n\nShe got up & faced Teletran 1. \n\n&quot;Orders..&quot; it asked. \n\nShe leaned over & started to type up a few things. &quot;Current orders: secure \nperimeter. Full defense systems online. Leave repair systems offline & none \nfunctioning. Repair to be done only manually. Outer defense systems at full, \ninner sentinel systems at maximum.&quot; as she continued to type. \n\nThen uplinked to Teletran 1. &quot;Uploading information data.&quot; \n\nAfter a couple minutes... &quot;Data received.&quot; \n\nShe glanced back as she disconnected herself from Teletran 1, to see the \ndormant Autobots & Decepticons. It nearly tore her as she saw her comrades, \nbroken & damage... in total stasis & offline. All those millions of years, \nshe wondered about them, what happened to them, where they had gone. The pain \nof not knowing their fate... now.. she knew. \n\n&quot;Teletran... leave current forms in master control room/bridge untouched.&quot;\n\n&quot;Acknowledged.&quot; the voice of the great computer stated. \n\nShe went on with her supposed new duties here. This.. would be her home for a \nwhile. It was what she wanted to do when she awoke on Cybertron & came here. \nSomehow... she felt she had to be here. \n\n&quot;Teletran.. locate materials: Cybertonium, transparasteel, hydronium... &quot; she \nrambled off many metals & other things. \n\n&quot;Confirmed. Location: in the main hold. All materials there.&quot; Teletran \nconfirmed. \n\n&quot;Good.&quot; \n\nShe started to make her way from Teletran 1, as she stopped dead in her \ntracks. Her crimson optics fell upon Megatron. Propped up in a chair, \ndormant... he had fallen there when the Ark crashed on Earth. Her optics \nstared at him for the longest time. All time seemed to have melted, not \nknowing how long she watched her former Leader. How she honestly missed him. \n\nShe brought herself out of the trance. Then made her way out of the Master \nControl Room.
