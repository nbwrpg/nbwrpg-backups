I \nhad to go \n&gt; to this awards banquet for day school and changed my Internet \nprovider. The \n&gt; reason none of my characters have Bios is because for a while me \nand friend \n&gt; have be reading books on animation and studying it in my art class. \nSo I \n&gt; going to Try ((Try Being the key word)) to animate a 3 minute short \nfor my \n&gt; bios one for each characters. But to see if this works the way I \nwant I&#39;m \n&gt; going to try to do a general music video for the Neo Beast Wars. \nThis is \n&gt; long time taking process which means with day school, night school, \nwork, \n&gt; and mischief, the two of us will be working on this in our spare \ntime. But \n&gt; before I start I want to ask permission to animate and draw your \ncharacters \n&gt; for the general Music Video. The characters that get picked we will \nbe \n&gt; listed and we are picking by the Bios you posted on the Web site if \nyour bio \n&gt; reads well enough to draw you then your character may get picked. \nIf you \n&gt; don&#39;t want to be drawn say so and you will not be picked. \nCharacters that \n&gt; are drawn will be drawn in a drawn by Gene in Transformers G1 style \nor with \n&gt; strong anime edge by me. Before I start if I make this and it is \ndecent will \n&gt; you add it to the page Yan?))\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ::The WildCats::\n&gt; All of the Wild C.A.T.S enter stealth mode and fall back to Cats \nLayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
