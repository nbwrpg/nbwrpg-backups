She was breathing hard from \nrunning.  She looked around and saw the other bots.  She transformed \ninto bot mode and walked up to Destructor. &quot;OK, what do you need me \nto do?&quot;  She gave up trying to get away and just followed her \norders.  She knew that from now on, she would have to follow his \norders or get slagged.  She stood there and folded her arms. &quot;By the \nway, who&#39;s word do we have that we won&#39;t get slagged?&quot;\n\n\n::Spears::\nShe slowly woke up, mech fluid dripping from the cut on her head.  \nShe was still groggy, but she soon got her bearings and knew what had \nhappened. The room caved in and now, she was not only strapped to \ntable, but the table was on it&#39;s side and burried under ruble.  She \nwas trapped under it all and couldn&#39;t move.  She didn&#39;t the only \nthing she coud think of,  she screamed and hoped someone would hear \nher under the pile of rubble.  She yelled,&quot;HELP! CAN ANYONE HEAR ME!! \nHELP!&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt; Destructor opened his comm as he landed near the ark. &quot;Dark Mouse. \nThere is \n&gt; more at stake here than getting slaged. It&#39;s the whole universe \ngetting \n&gt; slaged. Now we need your help. Just hurry up and follow orders.&quot; he \nlooked \n&gt; around to see the destrons maximals preads standing togeather. This \nsight was \n&gt; almost a shock. This could be the benging of a new aliance.\n\n\n"}}
