Prepare for the rebirth of the original rookie monster of NBW.\n\n      BIC:\n\n      Arrow hears Diesel&#39;s voice. His back was turned to his old ally. He tries to remember where he had seen Diesel before. Memories of his past come flying back to him. They return easily when he needs them enough, he finds, the Radicons hadn&#39;t done a very good job of erasing these memories. He slowly turns around, recalling Diesel&#39;s place in his tumultuous life.\n\n      Arrow: Ah, yes, Diesel, the message. It has been a long time, hasn&#39;t it? Shall we get to business immediately?\n\n      Arrow could barely remember Razor. He didn&#39;t hold anything against the Radicons for damaging his memory so badly. They did what they had to, Arrow had attempted to kill them.\n\n      Arrow: So, what now? Do we head to Earth?\n      ~~~~~\n      Deemos was sitting in a meeting, bored.\n\n      Leader: Gentlemen, we must all band together and stop this menace! We cannot allow this other club to gain the upper hand! We truly have the best flag! The others will pay for their disagreeance!\n\n      Deemos: What kind of club is this? And is disagreeance a word?\n\n      Leader: This is not a club, this is a council. It&#39;s the Council of Evil. And yes, Disagreeance is a word.\n\n      Deemos: No, you said &quot;We cannot allow this other club to gain the upper hand,&quot; apparently if there is this &quot;other&quot; club, this is a club.\n\n      Leader: See here--\n\n      Deemos: I was the one who held a council. We were the Mafia, the most imposing group to ever exist save for the Alliance.\n\n      Leader: Sir, I&#39;m certain I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.\n\n      Deemos: If this so called council is so evil, why is it that we are not attacking, and why is it that we are not spilling blood.\n\n      Leader: Mech fluid.\n\n      Deemos: It&#39;s the same thing. I&#39;ve spilled alot of it.\n\n      Leader: Well, sir, you see, we like to bide our time, and then--\n\n      Deemos: Then you burn someone else&#39;s flag. Then they come and burn yours. You don&#39;t know what violence is. I am the epitome of violence. The innovator. The only individuals I&#39;ve seen you destroy are your own comrades. Not that it&#39;s a bad thing to destroy your comrades, I&#39;ve destroyed plenty of lackeys in my time.\n\n      Leader: I think you&#39;re only saying this because you&#39;ve joined another council! I think you need to be dealt with! You&#39;re nothing more than a vicious traitor!\n\n      Deemos: So you guys are going to deal with me? Put me away? Send me to the great junkyard in the sky?\n\n      Member: Junkyard?\n\n      Leader: Enough of this, get him!\n\n      Deemos stands up. A member sitting right next to him stands up as well, but he&#39;s too slow and too dumb. Deemos puts a pistol to his mid section quickly and fires. Several bolts rip through the robot, creating several flashes and one hole leading all the way through. The unlucky one falls to the ground. Deemos&#39; trigger finger quickly flicks a switch on the utility pistol as he swivels it around towards another member who was raising a rifle. Deemos moves forward a single step and barely dodges a shot heading his way. He fires the pistol and a barrage of 5 inch long steel nails are fired at rapid speed, piercing the head of the attackee and tearing off large chunks. Deemos quickly spins around, flicking a switch once more and he fires. Several shots hit the robot who had fired at him, cutting down the bot who shocked at Deemos&#39; speed and severing one of his arms and his head. The cut down fellow&#39;s head rolled across the floor as the body dropped.\n\n      Leader: Idiots!\n\n      Deemos quickly fired a few pellets on the ground, which erupted into tall flames. He was hidden from sight. A shot emerges from behind the flames, passing Deemos&#39; head by inches.\n\n      Leader: Did you hear that? I think I got him.\n\n      A grenade flies out from behind the fire and rolls near the Leader of the council&#39;s feet.\n\n      (Cut to)\n\n      Deemos runs through the halls of the building as a massive explosion erupts behind him, detonating the room he previously occupied. It was no problem escaping from these buffoons, he thought as he exited the building, laughing at the fact that he destroyed about 20 or so more lives. He decided to check his messages. His commlink system was designed to capture messages and hold them for a later hearing. He had two of these. He activated the first one.\n\n      Message: Hey, buddy, I got some of those (buzz) were trying to get. It was (buzz) so, you wanna (buzz) we&#39;ve--\n\n      Deemos deletes the message quickly. A wrong number and a bad commlink. He activates the next message. He listens to the code carefully then plays it back again. He plays it back a third time.\n\n      Deemos: Hmm. Maybe. This sounds like the old code.\n\n      He activates his jets and flies, planning to answer this message addressing him and the the one that he knew well back on Earth, Arrow. It had been a long time since he had come in contact with Razor. He was ready for anything...\n\n        ----- Original Message -----\n        From: RoboRick007\n        To: Neo Beast Wars\n        Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2002 11:03 PM\n        Subject: Secret Messages\n\n\n        : : Diesel : :\n\n        On Cybertron a fuel tanker truck drives down an elevated street, before pulling into what looked like an abandon building.

The others will pay for their \n      disagreeance!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: What kind of club is this? And is disagreeance a \n      word?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: This is not a club, this is a council. It&#39;s the \n      Council of Evil. And yes, Disagreeance is a word.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: No, you said &quot;We cannot allow this other club to \n      gain the upper hand,&quot; apparently if there is this &quot;other&quot; club, this is a \n      club.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: See here--&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: I was the one who held a council. We were the \n      Mafia, the most imposing group to ever exist save for the \n      Alliance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Sir, I&#39;m certain I don&#39;t know what you are \n      talking about.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: If this so called council is so evil, why is it \n      that we are not attacking, and why is it that we are not spilling \n      blood.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Mech fluid.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: It&#39;s the same thing. I&#39;ve spilled alot of \n      it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Well, sir, you see, we like to bide our time, \n      and then--&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: Then you burn someone else&#39;s flag. Then they \n      come and burn yours. You don&#39;t know what violence is. I am the epitome of \n      violence. The innovator. The only individuals I&#39;ve seen you destroy are \n      your own comrades. Not that it&#39;s a bad thing to destroy your comrades, \n      I&#39;ve destroyed plenty of lackeys in my time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: I think you&#39;re only saying this because you&#39;ve \n      joined another council! I think you need to be dealt with! You&#39;re nothing \n      more than a vicious traitor!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: So you guys are going to deal with me? Put me \n      away? Send me to the great junkyard in the sky?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Member: Junkyard?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Enough of this, get him!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos stands up. A member sitting right next to him \n      stands up as well, but he&#39;s too slow and too dumb. Deemos puts a pistol to \n      his mid section quickly and fires. Several bolts rip through the robot, \n      creating several flashes and one hole leading all the way through. The \n      unlucky one falls to the ground. Deemos&#39; trigger finger quickly flicks a \n      switch on the utility pistol as he swivels it around towards another \n      member who was raising a rifle. Deemos moves forward a single step and \n      barely dodges a shot heading his way. He fires the pistol and a barrage of \n      5 inch long steel nails are fired at rapid speed, piercing the head of the \n      attackee and tearing off large chunks. Deemos quickly spins around, \n      flicking a switch once more and he fires. Several shots hit the robot who \n      had fired at him, cutting down the bot who shocked at Deemos&#39; speed and \n      severing one of his arms and his head. The cut down fellow&#39;s head rolled \n      across the floor as the body dropped.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Idiots!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos quickly fired a few pellets on the ground, which \n      erupted into tall flames. He was hidden from sight. A shot emerges from \n      behind the flames, passing Deemos&#39; head by inches.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Leader: Did you hear that? I think I got \n      him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;A grenade flies out from behind the fire and rolls near \n      the Leader of the council&#39;s feet.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;(Cut to)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos runs through the halls of the building as a \n      massive explosion erupts behind him, detonating the room he previously \n      occupied. It was no problem escaping from these buffoons, he \n      thought&nbsp;as he exited the building, laughing at the fact that he \n      destroyed about 20 or so more lives. He decided to check his messages. His \n      commlink system was designed to capture messages and hold them for a later \n      hearing. He had two of these. He activated the first one.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Message: Hey, buddy, I got some of those (buzz) were \n      trying to get. It was (buzz) so, you wanna (buzz) we&#39;ve--&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos deletes the message quickly. A wrong number and a \n      bad commlink. He activates the next message. He listens to the code \n      carefully then plays it back again. He plays it back a&nbsp;third \n      time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Deemos: Hmm. Maybe. This sounds like the old \n      code.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;He activates his jets and flies, planning to answer this \n      message addressing him and the the one that he knew well back on Earth, \n      Arrow. It had been a long time since he had come in contact with Razor. He \n      was ready for anything...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n      style=&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;DIV style=&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message -----&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV \n        style=&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n        &lt;A title=rfa007@... \n        href=&quot;mailto:rfa007@...&quot;&gt;RoboRick007&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV style=&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n        href=&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Neo Beast Wars&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV style=&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Sunday, August 11, 2002 11:03 \n        PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV style=&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Secret Messages&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;: : Diesel : \n        :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial \n        size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;On Cybertron a fuel tanker \n        truck drives down an elevated street, before pulling into what looked \n        like an abandon building.
