Was there something there? He was \n&gt; studying her when he heard a voice comm over subspace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tripredacus Command, Cybertron: We have recieved your request agent \n&gt; Drakangel. We are currently scrambling support troops. Your \npersonal \n&gt; request has already been met. Air Commander DeathStar is leaving as \n&gt; we speak. Tripredacus Command, over and out.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the surface of Cybertron a rather large group of Tripredacus \n&gt; flyers is assembled.

I will be going to Earth to deal with our friends \nproblems \n&gt; in these... Beast Wars. I bid you farewell my troops.

Soon after, a \n&gt; black and yellow Earth jet fires it&#39;s weapons, clearing the area, \n&gt; before landing next to the truck. The attacking vehicals transform \nto \n&gt; their robot modes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Diesel: So much for the recon mission, eh, Razor?\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor: Yeah, but it was more fun to blow them too bits, Diesel.\n&gt; \n&gt; A clicking of weapons being primed, attracts Razor and Diesel&#39;s \n&gt; attention again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Random Tripred Flyer #3: Not all of us...\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor draws his plasma rifle from subspace as Diesel ignites his \n&gt; laser rod sword.\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor: Diesel, old buddy, I think you may want to contact the rest \nof \n&gt; the nWo...\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I just thought that showing the nWo doing what I had them \nleave \n&gt; Earth for, fighting the Tripredacus, would be cool.
