He walks off \nafter her but also stops as he hears the predacon&#39;s transmission.\n\nProwl looks at Iron Raptor as she begins her sentence about backstabing bots, \nbut doesn&#39;t catch the last several words as Iron Raptor nearly fell in pain. \nHe walks up to her, passing Plintissa.\n\n&quot;I think I should carry you to the CR chambers,&quot; he says, his concern clearly \nwritten in his eyes and heard in his voice as he puts out a hand to steady \nher. From the look she had in her eyes earlier, he wasn&#39;t sure wether to take \nher to the CR chambers or her quarters.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStriker sits down in the war room, waiting for the meeting to begin when he \nhears shots outside. He growls, taking out his gun and running toward the \nshots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus shruggs, not knowing the answer to Ramhorn&#39;s questions.\n\n&quot;I have no idea. Last thing I remember was being shot by predacons,&quot; he says, \n&quot;And then I woke up in a CR chamber.&quot;\n\n"}}
