Let me out.&quot;   She walked back and forth inside the pod.  She \nput her nose to the bottom of the pod and looked around.  She was \nsmall, and there was a lot of room in the pod.  She was a child as \nwere the pod was made for a large adult.  She growled and prowled \naround in side.  She felt trapped. She didn&#39;t know what was going on. \nShe sat down on her hind legs and lowered her head.  She thought \nabout how she ended up in this mess.\n\nShe was on the ship with her parents and other relitives.  She was \nmade on that ship by her parents.  That star ship was the only home \nshe had ever known.  The ship was flying through space, on a \nscientific exploration mission.  It had entered into the solor system \nand started exploring the different planets.    It was passing the \nplanet of Jupitor when it was hit my a large meteor and it&#39;s engines \nwere heavily damaged,  the captain saw on the scanners that earth, \ndespite it&#39;s distance away from the ship, would prove to be the \nbetter planet to land on and make repairs to the ship.  The ship made \nit&#39;a way through space.  It was nearing earth when it passed through \nthe meteor belt outside the planet.  It was bombarded and pummeled \nwith spase rocks and meteors from the size of a marble to the size of \na sky scraper.  The ship took a huge beating. Then the ship, as it \nlost power and sustained great damage, was pulled towards the earth \nby it&#39;s gravitaional pull.  Trinity saw her mother grab her and stick \nher into the pod as the ship heased towards the ground.  her mother \nkissed her on the nose and then closed the lid on the pod.  Her \nmother turned on the stasis lock command on the pod, putting Trinity \ninto stasis.  Then her mother launched the pod moments before impact. \n\nTrinity sighed and then looked up at the sky, through the glass top \nof the pod. She whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry mom.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
