I read some previous posts, and, really, a Transformer&#39;s RPG is\n&gt; cool!!!  Tell me how this is for a first post and new character.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; [Ganthrax]\n&gt;\n&gt; Ganthrax was settling down by a lake, watching the night stars.  The water\n&gt; glimmered from the moonlight.  Ganthrax&#39;s dark body could only be seen by\n&gt; his glowing red optics.  He walked up to the edge of the lake, and looked\nat\n&gt; his reflection.  He thought to himself, Earth was wonderful.  Marvelous.\n&gt; Ganthrax went over by some trees, and went to sleep, his red optics\ngetting\n&gt; dimmer and dimmer.  So much beauty, so many things to see, so many bots to\n&gt; kill.  Yes, Earth was wondeful.\n&gt;\n&gt; (Did I do okay?
