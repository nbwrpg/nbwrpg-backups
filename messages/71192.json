But I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll open up in=\r\n due time.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=93I understand.=94 He said as he slowed the pace of hi=\r\ns walk for the somewhat shorter Straight Shot to keep up, he could not help=\r\n but feel an urgency to get to the medical bay. But instead of letting that=\r\n show he just turned a bright smile on Straight Shot, =93I am sure she will=\r\n do just fine Quickstride. Just fine.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This willbe a very e=\r\nasy task for you Straight&quot;said PErceptor with a slight\n&gt; emotion in his voi=\r\nce, It was hard to say that if was sarcastic or not&quot;You\n&gt; will babysit Elit=\r\na for a while and after Nighlight is awake, you will\n&gt; babysitt the mom... =\r\nFor a while any way&quot;and looking to Rodimus said\n&gt; &quot;Ramulus, so far I rememb=\r\ner, had left Elita inside the Medical bay and run\n&gt; th the Battle &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Per=\r\nceptor typed some buttons and tried to find ut where are all the bots\n&gt; tha=\r\nt were in stasis inside the Ark, he alse send instructions to the\n&gt; compute=\r\nr to prepare the medical bay for all the stuff that they might need.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n\nA map appeared directing Perceptor to where the stasis pods were located.=\r\n It was not all that far from his current location. \n\nThe computer took in =\r\nPerceptor&#39;s instruction and attempted to comply, however is some of its sys=\r\ntem resources were still down it would be some time before it would be able=\r\n to complete it. \n\nLegacy turned to Perceptor, &quot;I will make repairs. Contin=\r\nue on your mission.&quot; He turned to walk off. \n\n&gt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot smile=\r\ns. She always loved to be around Elita, and was happy to\n&gt; have the job.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Oh, I&#39;d be very happy to look after Elita. Poor thing, she&#39;s been throug=\r\nh so\n&gt; much.. And not to worry, Perceptor, if any intruder dares to come an=\r\nywhere\n&gt; near her or Nightlight, they&#39;ll have plenty of arrows up their aft=\r\ns, trust me.&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Rodimus walked into the medical bay along with Pe=\r\nrceptor and Straight Shot he could see Ramulus sitting in one of the chairs=\r\n, obviously he himself was in need of repairs. \n\n=93Rodimus.=94 Ramulus sai=\r\nd as he rose to his feet. =93I have to get to the recharge chambers, but yo=\r\nur wife and child are there.=94 Ramulus pointed at a far bed where Elita la=\r\ny sleeping on Nightlight. \n\nRodimus turned to look as Straight shot went ov=\r\ner to them . . . \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds, as she gently takes E=\r\nlita into her own arms, cradling her body securely.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Straight Sho=\r\nt carried her out of the room, he could not help but give her a sad look. H=\r\ne longed to hold his daughter in his arms and hug her himself. But then his=\r\n optics turned to look at Nightlight, =93Perceptor. How is she?=94\n\nAs Rodi=\r\nmus talked the lights in the room dimmed for a moment and then came back wi=\r\nth more light. Obviously someone, probably Legacy, was making repairs to so=\r\nme of the vital systems. Lights around the room began to blink green, most =\r\nof them were ready for use. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0025_01CC1052.952F00B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;ELita/nightl=\r\night/PErceptor::&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Elita cuddle in bed and she c=\r\nontinue dreaming with her mom &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=93mom...=94sai=\r\nd the girl in a very soft voice&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;**************=\r\n********************&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PErceptor scanned Nighlig=\r\nht and said =93Her body is all right, she can \nfuction by herself as soon a=\r\ns we bring her back her coma... it=92s the mind that \nworry me=94and add dr=\r\nyly=94this will be your part of the job, Rodimus: when I remove \nthe stasis=\r\n, she will awake and you will be there...
