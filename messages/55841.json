She went and looked. Another drone was near \n&gt; by.  She saw it was about 60 yards away. She crouched down, just like \n&gt; Blackfang did.  She crawled up really slowly to the drone. She \n&gt; crawled up right under the drone. She went to pounce and banged her \n&gt; head on the underside of the drone and fell the the ground.  She \n&gt; whimpered a bit and rubbed her head with her paw. &quot;Ohhwwwwiieee, that \n&gt; hurrrtt.&quot; with a whine and a whimper.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Blackfang saw that the puppy bot was going full frontal at the \n&gt; drones.\n&gt; &gt; She would get bored soon if she went on like this. He transformed to\n&gt; &gt; wolf mode and met her near a tree.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: You&#39;re enthusiastic, but you have to be careful too. Let \n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; show you how to do this great, okay?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He squatted his large shape near the ground and advanced slowly\n&gt; &gt; through the bushed. There was a drones mere meters away. He moved\n&gt; &gt; slowly, silently, until he was just under the drone, on the other \n&gt; side\n&gt; &gt; of a shrub. Then, he jumped. Quick as a bullet, he leapt just over \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; drones and brought all his weight down on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang: I know you can do just as good. It might take time, but I\n&gt; &gt; know you can do it! Now it&#39;s your turn.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
