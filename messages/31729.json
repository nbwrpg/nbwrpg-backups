He slows the EMP grenades with his mind,\n&gt; making them fall down toward the ground before they exploded, Prowl\n&gt; out of their range. His mind gives him the warning of an approaching\n&gt; bot seconds before he hears the scream, Prowl twisting in the air and\n&gt; barely avoiding the vulture.
