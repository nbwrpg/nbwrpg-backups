So I have no clue who Prowl is looking at.\nSorry.)\n&gt;\n&gt; * Zyber trotted out of Rowdy&#39;s cave and began to sniff around for the\nplants and herds she needed to heal Striker, she kept her nose to the ground\nand soon came up with the sent of pond lily. She smiled as she began to\nfollow it&#39;s sent.\n&gt; Soon Zyber cane to a shallow pond and looked into it&#39;s waters, there was\nlily there but half of it was submerged. She sighed as she waded into the\npond and took a few of the soft white flowers from the pads.\n&gt; She walked out of the pond and shook every limb in turn until she was sure\nthat they were not soaking wet. Now it was time to find what she needed\nmost...devil&#39;s club.*\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor exited the Ark and looked up at the damage when Prowl\nmentioned it.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve got the ship&#39;s repair system working on that right now, it&#39;ll take\na few mega-cycles but it&#39;ll be done.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then looked at Prowl and smiled.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be complete before the next attack.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Iron Raptor then looked out at the scene before her and sighed, smoking\ncraters and blast areas...a typical battle field. She took a few steps\nforward and scanned, her scanners picked up a stray signature heading\ntowards the Predacon base. They indicated that the signature was that of\nPlintissa&#39;s, but why would she be going to the Pred base willingly?\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked back at Prowl with concern.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve got a stray signature on my screen here, I think that it&#39;s\nPlintissa but why would she be going to the Pred base?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest\n&gt; address on the Net!\n&gt; http://penpalmail.www.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the world?
