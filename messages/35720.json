I&#39;ll be right there as soon as I take care of these bots.&quot;\n\nShe makes her way over to the four new Maximals. &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl nods at IR&#39;s words, entering the city and making his way toward the center of it, the Element. He knew his way around the Element, so he would be able to find those holo-rooms. He had no idea where Cyndro had placed the ones on the CF.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: With this post, I finally introduce my familiar foursome and set myself right on the mark of 16 characters.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: A couple of tiny ships set down by the Maximal base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice 1: We&#39;re Maximals, we just turned on them once, but we never did them any harm, just helped out that ass Deemos a LITTLE, and he was with the Maximals, kind of, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice 2: Yeah, it&#39;s  pretty imperative we side with the Maximals about now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice 3: Besides, Arrow might be there, and we can take care of things quickly and easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice 2: We can&#39;t hear you well from all the way in the other ship, so well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice 3: Then why don&#39;t we step out of the ships, we&#39;ve landed, haven&#39;t we?\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold and Blender step out of the first ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender: Don&#39;t talk like that, it only succeeds in making me lose my cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice steps out of the second ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: I&#39;m just saying that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to stay in the ships until the Maximals find us. They probably won&#39;t, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold: Yeah, right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas stepped out from the ship next.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas: Don&#39;t be all mean, we&#39;re beyond that now, aren&#39;t we?\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold: Heh, midget&#39;s right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas: I thought we were beyond that, too? The ride over here just made you cranky!\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all, don&#39;t say anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender: Yeah, she&#39;s right. We have to think of more important things. Like killing Arrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold: Train Wreck was with him, we&#39;ll have to kill him, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: I wonder if some of the old boys are still alive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas: Like Deemos? Or Serge?\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: Or Jetstorm, or the Mini-Mob.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold: That idiot Diskus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender: How about Stranato?\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: The Godfather.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas: My old friend Sharpedge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: Was he really your friend?\n&gt; \n&gt; Rizopas: Well, why not? We both liked each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender and Stronghold both looked to each other, smoking their cigarettes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: Should we go to the Maximals and explain how we were wrong to join the opposite team and beg to go back with them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Blender: Uh, you 2 do the begging part.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stronghold: Yeah, we&#39;ll stick right here and watch you from here. We might wave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: Okay then.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice approaches the Cybertronian Fire. Rizopas nervously following her. She stops just at the range of the autoguns and calls out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doom Ice: Hey! Any room for some good Maximals?...\n\n\n"}}
