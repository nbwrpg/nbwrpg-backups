Using his shoulder cannon he shot at \nBumbleBee and then at Injector. He pulled out his spear gun and fired \nat Double Punch and Unitron. His cloak dropped because of the gun but \nhe sat up in the tree, still pretty much unable to be seen by the \nnaked optic and waited for another great hunting opportunty.\n\n\n"}}
