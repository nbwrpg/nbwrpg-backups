He \nlaunched the grenade off at Torca, a sonic blaster appearing in his left hand \nfrom subspace.  He raised that arm, firing off an arc of sonic energy from \nthe blaster at Torca&#39;s abdomen.\n\n---\n\nTwo missiles exploded against the black tank&#39;s armor, leaving large dents.  \nThe cannon raised, and three fire balls launched off at Sky Lynx.\n\n---\n\nHiss caught an EMP blast to the knee, and let out a curse, and returned fire \nwith fusion blasts, blowing apart an EMP cannon, autogun fire sending him \nflipping to his back.\n\n---\n\nScavenger jumped to his right, a few of the rapid shots from Ratchet hitting \nhis left thigh.  He got to a knee, firing off 25 shells at Ratchet.\n\n---\n\nSixshot took the rapid fifteen shots from Ratchet and burst out into \nlaughter.  &quot;UTTERLY PATHETIC!&quot; he yelled, his turret moving slightly, firing \noff another blast from his cannon in tank mode at Ratchet, this time the \nblast aimed at his sternum.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf looked over to where the flying Alliance members and the two tanks \nwere busy fighting.  He raised his sword, the blade launching out of the hilt \nas a missile, heading for Sideswipe.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch laughed as two missiles struck the ground nowhere near him.  The \nthird though struck, and sent a little big of shrapnel into his left heel.  \nBut he wasn&#39;t bleeding thanks to his armor.  He raised both pinchers, firing \noff two energy-signature seeking missiles at Orion, keeping silent so he \nwouldn&#39;t help give away his own position.\n\n---\n\nManterror laughed, and raised both arms.  He launched off a single ion disk, \nintercepting the incoming missile, covering his face to protect it from \nshrapnel.  &quot;Die.&quot; he said to himself with a vicious smile, firing off 5 ion \ndisks at Sky Lynx.  Two from one arm, three from the other.\n\n---\n\nInjector dodged the missile, but the twelve rapid blasts connected with his \nright shoulder, sending him flying backwards until he regained balance in the \nair.  He moved his right shoulder, though with much pain.  He cursed, and \nfired down six stinger missiles and ten rapid optic blasts at Sideswipe.  \nThree missiles from each launcher.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee dodged the rapid blasts but caught the missile straight in the \nchest and was sent flipping backwards.  He regained balance, and flew full \nforce,  spinning through the air on purpose, firing off 25 rapid optic blasts \nand four stinger missiles at Sideswipe, two missiles from each launcher.\n\n---\n\nAres saw the battle, and swerved his turret.  He fired off eight shots at Sky \nLynx, four shots from two of his cannons.  He moved his turret further and \nfired off eight shots at Orion, four shots from the two remaining cannons.\n\n"}}
