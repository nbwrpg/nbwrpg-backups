She placed a comforting hand on the fems \nshoulder-plate. *\n\n� Believe me, I feel for your dilemma. But it�s alright now. You�re safe \nhere and if you ever need any help then just ask. But, at the moment, I�m \nthe one that needs YOUR help.�\n\n*Her head suddenly snapped up as she heard Prowl�s comment, her teeth bared, \neyes narrowed, and on the verge of a growl. She would just let the little \ncomment sit and smolder for a while, then she would let him have it. She \njust gave him a narrow eyes smile that spoke of revenge before looking back \ntowards Feline. Her expression changing back to a heartfelt look.\nIron Raptor moved so that she was standing in the area of the floor that \nFeline was looking, looking down at her.*\n\n� I have friends. They�re missing. And I need you to help me find them.�\n\n* She then looked off towards the holo-projector, it then suddenly \nactivating on it�s own.*\n\n� One of those friends is Tavatron, field soldier,� the holo-projection of \nTavatron appeared on the flat surface of the device in robot mode, her beast \nmode projected beside her.\n� On the way back to base her signature stopped in Grid 16, exactly 30 \nclicks from the Alliance base.�\n\n* The projection then disappeared to be replaced by that of Dinobots, both \nrobot and beast mode.*\n\n� The second is Dinobot, warrior and field strategist. His signature stopped \nthe same time as Tavatron�s. Same location as well. I fear that he might \nhave been extremely damaged from Alliance attacks and may be in stasis \nlock.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then brought up the image of Tavatron as well so that both \nprojections could be seen, then turning towards Feline. *\n\n� That�s why I called you to me, Feline. To lead a search and recovery \nmission, for those two bots. Would you do this for me?�\n\n* Iron Raptor�s voice had a tick of worry to it, she was indeed worried \nabout Tavatron and Dinobot. It had been mega-cycles since she had seen them \nlast, wondering just what could be keeping them.\nShe had located their signatures and discovered that they had stopped in \nGrid 16, further research decided that those signatures weren�t moving and \nshe wanted to know why.\nFeline was just the bot she required for such a mission, new and with this \nsimple mission it would be a good starter. But if she refused, then she \nwould run the mission herself and leave this fembot to her pass times.\nIron Raptor waited for Felines answer. *\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
