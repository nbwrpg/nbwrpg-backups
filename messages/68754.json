Instead he watches as the wild blasts from the minion strike the area around him, a few of them deflected by his shielding. \n\nIt is obvious that there is some truth to legacy&#39;s decleration about his lack of energy as his shielding appears to be less able to absorb the blast from Nightstrike - had the Minion&#39;s shots been more concentrated it is possible that they may have penatrated. \n\nLegacy continues to fire blasts of electro magnetic energy at the fleeing Nightstrike!\n\n(Tag Nightstrike)\n\n&gt; Elder rushes back into the shuttle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elder: I dont want them reaching Atlantis. Use the shuttle&#39;s\n&gt; turrets and fire!\n&gt;\n&gt; The pilot does as instructed. The two turret cannons on the \n&gt; shuttle&#39;s sides take aim and fire their much larger blasts at \n&gt; Nightstrike.\n\nLegacy stepped closer to the shuttle, using it for cover as he continues to fire on the minion, even as slowly, and perhaps imperceptably at this point, his shots are begining to grow weaker. \n\nPreston\n(Legacy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
