She nodded to herself at a job well done but then heard Rowdy ask if she was going to stay, she wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted her there any longer. She had seen the look on his face when she had told him to get a fire going for Striker and was almost sure the he had then decided that she was one in which he wouldn&#39;t like, or that was they way it seemed to her anyway. Zyber kept her eyes away from Rowdy for cause that if it was true than he would be glaring at her, something that she didn&#39;t want to look up and see.\nIn a rather quiet voice she answered.*\n\n&quot; Only if you wish me to.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
