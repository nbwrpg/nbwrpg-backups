The part dragon-TRex- robot said watching his subjects.\n\nDarkmouse growls, looking up at Megaton and showing no fear. &quot;I&#39;d\nwatch yourself if I were you. These are my friends you&#39;re around.&quot;\n\nThe 14 foot bot scoffed at the mouses statement about having friends. &quot;There\nare no friends in wartime Mouse, We have only temporary conveniences when\nthier needed.&quot; He knew that he had the right idea because the way war works\nisn&#39;t friendly.\n\n:::Starscream:::\n\n::He had gotten over the shock of seeing Megaton and realized that if\nhe is joining them, They might as well be on friendlier terms::\nStarscream: It seems we will be allies from now on.  What do you say\nwe let bygones be bygones?\n\nMegaton watched Starscreams actions more than listened to his words, he\nseemed sincere but as the old one often did could be hiding something. He\nsensed an awkward feeling, like someone stepping on his grave (Since\nStarscream tossed Megatron out of the ship in the movie it&#39;s reasonable.)\nThe joys of war were presenting themselves, first he was trying to destroy\nStarscream, now they were allies. &quot;I agree. We are no longer at each others\nbacks so we can agree.&quot;\n\n::DrillBit::\n\nHe wispered to StarScream, &quot;We will except him for now, but keep an\noptic on him. The second we have a good reason, we turn him into scrap.&quot;\nHe then turned back to Megaton.\n&quot;Do not speak to my officers that way, please,&quot; he said, refering to\nDark Mouse.\n\n&quot;As you wish, I was not aware that you made her an officer, Megatrons files\nlisted her as just another sacrifice- I mean soldier to fight for the\nPredacon cause.&quot; The mutant minced his words to piss off his new associates.\nHe wanted thier full attention on the enemy at hand and he knew he had it\neven though he knew that none of the Preds he&#39;d encountered  trusted any of\nhis intentions. Darkmouse was seemong a little overconfident due to the\ncomment so Megaton fealt that he had to put her back in the right place.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t get cocky little one, even though you are high in rank you could\nstill easily be placed at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nGet to the point, Megaton! If you want to continue to beat around the\nbush, then go take a swim in the lava! Now tell us what you came to\ntell.&quot;\nHe calmed himself, and his tone with the last sentance.\nHe would stand up for his troops. They were family to him. Megaton\nwasn&#39;t going to come into their home, and push them around.\n\nMegatons focus again presented itself to Drillbit. &quot;My point is that I have\naccess to the other Predacon base, and a strategy that would allow us to\ndestroy the other faction. Megaton smiled knowing that deciept and trust\nwere opposites in the Predacon dictionary. &quot;If you will listen to my ideas\nand follow my directions we will eliminate any opposition.&quot;\n\nSeveral troops of Darkfate were arriving to see what&#39;s going on.\nDarkfate felt the tention in the Black Fortress.  His four snakes\nwere ready and hissing around the body of their master.\n\n&quot;Of course that Megaton, won&#39;t have by now any intention to fight&quot;\nsaid the dragon &quot;it&#39;s not wise annoy a Dragon in his own lair... &quot; he\nadded &quot;What are those important news Megaton?&quot;\n\nMegaton stayed calm and collected as the reinforcements arrived. In his mind\nhe was invinceable and this group would hardly be a challenge. Darkfate\nspoke,  &quot;Of course that Megaton, won&#39;t have by now any intention to fight&quot;\nsaid the dragon &quot;it&#39;s not wise annoy a Dragon in his own lair... &quot; he added\n&quot;What are those important news Megaton?&quot;\n\nMegaton took a smug act into his actions. &quot;It is unwise to annoy a dragon in\nany lair.&quot; He wanted every bot to know who he feared. He feared no one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Airshadow Nightlight &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, February 15, 2001 8:25 AM\nSubject: Re: Megatons hot entrance\n\n\n&gt; Darkfate/Alecto::\n&gt; &quot;Welcome to my base, Megaton&quot; Said Darkfate &quot;I hope\n&gt; that the news that you bring us are really pleasant.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I hope that you behave and don&#39;t disturb the master\n&gt; of the house&quot; said rude a femme voice. &quot;I&#39;ll be happy\n&gt; to..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;ALECTO SHUT UP!!!!!&quot; screamed Darkfate.\n&gt;\n&gt; The femme smiled sarcastically and dissapear in a\n&gt; corridor.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alecto always behave in that way, don&#39;t worry...&quot;\n&gt; said Darkfate. and he came in leading the way towards\n&gt; the conference room\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- CYBERWOLF4 &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megaton grinned a fake smile as he still looked down\n&gt; &gt; at the others. &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; glad to hear you&#39;re a bot of reason.&quot; he started\n&gt; &gt; walking toward the base,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Shall we go inside and discuss our options?&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; asked knowing that he was\n&gt; &gt; now in control wether they knew it or not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He caught Darkmouses look of disgust out of the\n&gt; &gt; corner of his eyes.
