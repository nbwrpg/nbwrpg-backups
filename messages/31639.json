As he fell towards first aid, one head\nsnarled, and\n&gt; the other spoke, &quot;We&#39;ll rip out your slagging fuel pump, and EAT\nIT&quot;, both\n&gt; mouths wide opend, he decended on his foe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Headstrong got his legs taken out from under him, by the force of\nthe shot\n&gt; to the torso. He tried to roll away from the searing blast of flame from\n&gt; Hot Spot, but was not very successful. He stood up, his front all\ncharred,\n&gt; and he pulled out his sword, and Plasma blaster. As soon as he\nthouched his\n&gt; sword, his figuere became hollow, and four more joined it, standing\nside by\n&gt; side. &quot;SNORT* Lucky shot Autobot, but you won&#39;t *Snort* do it again&quot; he\n&gt; said, firing three large burst of light balls from his gun.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tantrum landed near Rampage, and Transformed. &quot;Here, refuel&quot; he said, as\n&gt; one of his tanks opened for Rampage to dring from. While he did this he\n&gt; fired on Groove with his horns.\n\n\n"}}
