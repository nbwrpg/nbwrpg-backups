Plintissa wasn&#39;t moving. Dracona smiled=\r\n and walked back toward her base. A dagger flew into Dracona&#39;s back. She sp=\r\nun around and grabbed the dagger in pain. Plintissa stood there.\n\n         =\r\n       &quot;You do not know when to give up, you fool, but never mind that your=\r\n an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t be able to be seen wit=\r\nh a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand covered and flung the dagg=\r\ner back. It missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in s=\r\natisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her down. Dracona once again=\r\n turned to her saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, =\r\nbut Plintissa dodged. Dracona started to burn everything with fire beams. P=\r\nlintissa still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good fighter, but it wasn&#39;=\r\nt until now, after her bad life that she discovered her true fighting power=\r\n. Plintissa beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts were flung everywher=\r\ne as Plintissa spun a simple stick through the air. Dracona raised the saw =\r\nblade and sliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed and sliced Plintissa =\r\nseveral hundred times. Plintissa fell.\n\n                &quot;Th weak move aside=\r\n and die so the strong can survive. As ancient as the Cosmos, that has alwa=\r\nys been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintissa, you were a good friend, but=\r\n don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just business.&quot; Dracona said.\n           =\r\n      \n                Dracona pulled back the saw blade and thrust it towa=\r\nrds Plintissa. Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier and threw it. It hit =\r\nDracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, but as she did, the bla=\r\nde came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. Dracona blinked h=\r\ner eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first arived on the planet. Th=\r\ne blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces everywhere. Her spark =\r\nextinguished. Her last words were:\n\n                &quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus =\r\nI am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona died smilin=\r\ng. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she would never leav=\r\ne her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and she got w=\r\neaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. He was crying, t=\r\noo.\n\n                &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintissa =\r\nwhispered.\n\n                &quot;Why are you leaving me, Plintissa? Why does ev=\r\neryone betray me?&quot; Artist asked.\n\n                &quot;Artist, there floats Dra=\r\ncona&#39;s spark, recover it, we can&#39;t part, she really was my friend.&quot; Artist =\r\nwalked up and captured the extinguished spark as it tried to fly away. He c=\r\nontained it in a capsule.\n\n                &quot;Plintissa, if you leave me, I&#39;l=\r\nl...have no more reason to live, all my friends are gone, my helping days a=\r\nre over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n                &quot;Your helping days are never over, =\r\nand we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n                &quot;This isn&#39;t=\r\n some lame thing about how you&#39;ll always be in my heart, is it?&quot;\n\n         =\r\n       &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Artist looked at Team =\r\nUltima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, that it was destroyed=\r\n by Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that originally built it. =\r\nAnd there it was, sticking above ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks=\r\n at the base and sighs.\n\n                &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess=\r\n we have to leave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sigh=\r\ns.\n\n                &quot;Blizzard, we need to find another home, now.&quot; Sinister=\r\n said sadly.\n\n                Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her spark su=\r\nddenly burst from her and floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to him what=\r\n he needed to do. He opened his chest compartment and his spark was reveale=\r\nd. Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.\n\n      =\r\n          &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. Plintissa told h=\r\nim she still loved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plintissa was with him now, a=\r\nnd now they could never be seperated again. Artist, completely ignoring Bli=\r\nzzard and Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n       =\r\n         &quot;Artist, now we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa s=\r\naid. (Remember, only Artist can hear Plintissa now) Artist headed toward th=\r\ne Maximal base, there Dracona would get a new body, one she could not attac=\r\nk anyone ever again in, and where she can always be helpful. Artist held up=\r\n the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still inside.\n\n                &quot;I love you.=\r\n&quot; Artist said seemingly to nobody.\n\n                &quot;I love you too.&quot; Plint=\r\nissa said to Artist.

Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintiss=\r\na dodged. \n                Dracona started to burn everything with fire bea=\r\nms. Plintissa \n                still avoids it. Plintissa was always a good=\r\n fighter, but it \n                wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life that=\r\n she discovered her \n                true fighting power.

Dracona =\r\nraised the saw blade and \n                sliced the stick to pieces. Draco=\r\nna laughed and sliced Plintissa \n                several hundred times.

Dracona blinked her eye, the \n             =\r\n   one Dinobot had scarred when she first arived on the planet. The \n      =\r\n          blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces everywhere. \n =\r\n               Her spark extinguished.
