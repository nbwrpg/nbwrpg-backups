In all the bases on Earth, the warning \nsystems must have been going crazy upon detecting the object. Its \ntrajectory took it to the moon only a few minutes later. The landing \ncaused the formation of an immense crater. There, at its center, \nMeteara, the second Vok emissary, stood. She was huge, with immense \nthrusters in her back, a big pincer folding over her left arm and what \nseemed to be a destructive weapon on her right arm.\n\nMeteara: I will wait for those intruders to signal themselves again. \nThen, they will know the wrath of the Vok!\n\n\n"}}
