He walks to his run and hears \nblaster fire. He runs in and sees Hell Beast and other Predacon\nfiring \nat something near the roof. He looked up to see this weird looking \nbot. He wasn&#39;t Oragainc nor TM1 nor TM2. Scorponok slowly crept into \nhis room. He walked behind everyone so he wouldn&#39;t be noticed.\n\n\n"}}
