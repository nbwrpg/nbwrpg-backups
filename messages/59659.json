WEll, first off, wolves are not bounty \nhunters in the same way your thinking. But hunters we are. As for a \nsecret I possess, I will tell you one thing. It doesn&#39;t take two to \nkeep a secret.&quot;  She grinned and sipped her drink. &quot;However, I do \nbelieve in returning a favor for a favor. First off, Yes, I am from \nanother dimension. How I got here or why I&#39;m here is beyond my mental \nprocessors. However, I do know what will tempt Unicron. IT&#39;s three \nthings he can&#39;t resist. Energy, knowledge and metal.  HE uses metal \nto rejuvinate himself, energy for the same reasons we need it, and \nknowledge. He wants to be a god. Better than the matrix. He thinks \nhe&#39;s the smartest thing out there and that he knows everything there \nis to know except the future. But since he&#39;s almost invincable, he \ndoesn&#39;t care about attacks from smaller enemies. He&#39;s too big to \nstop. However, he can still be outsmarted. Ever hear of something \ncalled a BlackHole?  I did it once before in my universe. We had \nrigged something to make Unicron think we had found the EYE OF THE \nMATRIX.  It lets one see into the past, present and future. He wanted \nit so bad, he followed me into a black hole. I made it by chance out \nthe other end. He was way to big to fit through the small Quazar and \nwas stuck forever. So, now you have info on me.&quot; She grinned, &quot;Oh, \nand one more little thing, if you want a secret about me. I am made \nof a substance called Zianium. It&#39;s stronger and more duable than \nTransmetal. But unlike metal, it can, ah, heal itself. LIke a true \norganic can heal from a wound or sickness. And, I have a substance \nsimilar to the organic liquid called blood. It&#39;s thicker and has a \nblue color, but it&#39;s not just mech fluid. I was one of seven like \nmyself. We were the prototypes. But, well, &quot;  she looked at her \ndrink. &quot;Never mind anyway, favor returned. Find something to look \nlike an EYE OF THE MATRIX and lure Unicron into a black hole. He&#39;ll \nfall in and your rid of him.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &quot;This ability is what I was wanting to use to boost the Tripred&#39;s \ncannon.  By casting a net over large energon deposits, I can absorb \nand refine enough energy to repulse Unicron.  I&#39;m tellin&#39; you \nbecause, well three reasons.  One, I figure since you are from an \nalternate dimention.  You probably won&#39;t blab anything to just \nanyone.  Your a wolf, I am a bounty hunter.  We probably possess \nskills that complement each other.  The other?  You remind me so much \nlike Organics and myself.&quot;\n&gt; He paused to drink his whiskey- and - energon cocktail.\n&gt; &quot;Now, I have devulged a closly guarded secret.  It&#39;s your turn.&quot;   \n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She was impressed by Malice&#39;s ability to absorb energy as he could. \n&gt; But she tried not to show it. She drank her cup and looked at \n&gt; him. &quot;OK, so far, you have a gift and you don&#39;t want others to know \n&gt; about it. But a question forms in my thought procesors, why tell me \n&gt; if you don&#39;t want anyone else to know? Unless you have an offer to \n&gt; give me, plan on killing me later on, or perhaps, you have the need \n&gt; to tell me this because you need help with something related to \nthis \n&gt; little gift of yours. Tell me how close I am on that.&quot; She looked \nat \n&gt; him, &quot;But yes, I shall keep what you ask confidencial. After all, \nif \n&gt; you can&#39;t trust your fellow fighters, who can you trust.&quot;  She \nsmiled \n&gt; and winked at him. &quot;I&#39;m a wolf. We keep secrets well.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool. Try it!\n\n\n"}}
