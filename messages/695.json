His fur colour wasn&#39;t much help to blend in, but it was his beast mode, and could do nothing about that.\n\nHe sighed deeply, he could detect some energy signatures (Quickstrike, Tarantulas, and whoever else is there) on his scanners. His head constantly shifted from side to side, seeking out creatures, while his ears were pricked up. \n\nAt last, he came within sight of the bots. He saw the Snake-Scorpian was injured, quite seriously. His eyes narrowed and he mentally considered if he should go up to them.\n\nFor the moment, he would follow them. See if they were friendly. Or not.\n\n=================\n\nName: Rexon\nFaction: Neutral \nGender: Male\nBeast Mode: Grey Fox-Wolf Hybrid\n\nLooks: In Beast Mode Rexon is slightly larger and better built than Foxes are, yet slightly smaller than a Wolf. He has pale amber eyes which have an eternally absent and sorrowful look in them.\nIn Robot Mode he has pale grey armour, with a silver cape swirling behind him. A huge battle axe handle sticks out from behind his shoulder. He has the Fox-Wolf head split in half for hands. His eyes are still a pale amber, and he has fangs for teeth.\n\nPersonality: Rexon is a very mysterious, dark warrior. He preffers to keep things to himself, like Dinobot. But when in battle, he is very quick, using the huge battle axe to scrap enemies that are threatening him or friends. \n\nBackround: This warrior was once a Predacon, but he grew a severe disliking for them until the point he tried to take them all on in hand to hand battle. He escaped, but was found again and tortured. Rexon was once a very active, fast talking robot, but now he has changed.\nFrom that point on he didn&#39;t want to fight in the Wars, but since he came to Earth, he realised he had to.\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
