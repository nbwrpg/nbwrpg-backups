How ot respond, how to respond..\n\n\n&gt; UNUS nodded a=\r\ns he left the room, followed by ASTRA and FIREHORN and\n&gt; presumably WHEELIE=\r\n as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; As they did so another soldier, one looking like all the res=\r\nt of them\n&gt; came up qickly to UNUS and spoke into his ear.\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS nodded=\r\n as he looked curiously at WHEELIE and the symbol that he wore.\n&gt; \n&gt; When t=\r\nhe other soldier reached an end of whatever he was saying UNUS\n&gt; clapped hi=\r\nm on the shoulder, &quot;You have done well Darkhoof.&quot; he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Turning to =\r\nlook at WHEELIE there was a smile on UNUS&#39; face, &quot;It would\n&gt; seem that ther=\r\ne is another of your kind in here looking as well, a\n&gt; silver dragon of som=\r\ne kind? He has the other symbol that your friend\n&gt; described.&quot; Of course ta=\r\nlking about the Maximal symbol.\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS looked at DARKHOOF and then back =\r\nat WHEELIE, &quot;Somehow he ended up\n&gt; fighting Grimlock and his men.&quot; His tone=\r\n was dark as he talked. &quot;They\n&gt; patrol the jungle looking for stragglers to=\r\n pick off. From what I&#39;m\n&gt; told he was able to hide your companion and dist=\r\nract him, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; think your friend came alone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; DARKHOOF nodded=\r\n and took up the narrative at a gesture from UNUS,\n&gt; &quot;There were others.&quot; D=\r\nARKHOOF said calmly, although there was a\n&gt; tiredness in his voice. &quot;I coul=\r\ndn&#39;t couln&#39;t get close enough to see\n&gt; their symbol, but one turned into a =\r\nblack wheeled vehicle like you and\n&gt; your other friend.&quot; Evidently DARKHOOF=\r\n knew of RODIMUS.\n&gt; \n&gt; he continued, &quot;Grimlock went after them. One of them=\r\n got hurt, the\n&gt; vehicled one I believe, but they made it back their craft.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; FIREHORN nodded, &quot;Grimlock and his team are tough, but not all that =\r\nfast.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; UNUS looked at WHEELIE, &quot;Does any of this sound familar?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n=\r\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nThere was a sudden pause over from WHEELIE Then as he hear=\r\nd the name &#39;GRIMLOCK&#39;.  A quiet shaking of his head as hew shipered, as if =\r\nhalf in fear, ahlf in shock, half in (he&#39;s bad at math) surprise and half m=\r\nourning.  &quot;Grimlock, you say?  With four others..  Dinosaurs if I may?&quot;\n\nTh=\r\ne bit with the &#39;black large car&#39; and the other &#39;Maximal&#39; hitting him for a =\r\nfew moments as he forced some coolant to pump through his systems and cut b=\r\nack his emotional subroutines, &quot;For who those two were, I don&#39;t know.  But =\r\nI do not know where to go.  If Grimlock is here, why I say..  Would he atta=\r\nck another in such a way?&quot;\n\nShaking his head quietly, processing.  Assuming=\r\n that it meant Grimlock and hte other Dinobots were here on Earth as well, =\r\neven Grimlock in a poor mood would not attack a Maximal with intent to kill=\r\n.  He might beat them some or intimidate, but if what he was being told was=\r\n true and Grimlock had not held back..\n\nSomething was wrong.  Definitely wr=\r\nong.  Grimlock was too stubborn to be reprogrammed, and the Predacons, like=\r\n the Decepticons had tended to utilize far more blatant methodologies in re=\r\nprogramming, at least as he was aware of.  And would hardly had let the Din=\r\nobots randomly wander around the landscape either.  Even in here.  That lef=\r\nt the Unicronians, whom what little nkowledge of their participation in the=\r\n BEAST WARS he had read of preferred more blatant things as signs of their =\r\ncorruption, like heavy upgrades or slave collars..  \n\nSo, that left one hid=\r\neously disquieting thought in WHEELIE that with what limited data he had se=\r\nemed the likeliest bit.\n\nThat GRIMLOCK and the DINOBOTS had attacked anothe=\r\nr Maximal brutally and of their own free processor and subroutines.\n\nBut if=\r\n so..\n\nWHY?\n\n\n"}}
