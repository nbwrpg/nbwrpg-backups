She found the rusting \nremains of two bots that were chained to the wall inside the second \ncell.  She walked in and smiled. &quot;Ah yes. Well, they aren&#39;t much to \nlook at, but they will do. Surely there is enough parts undernieth \nthe rust to be of some use.&quot;  She opened a small compartment in her \nforearm and pulled out a small electron Multi-tool. She started to \nwork disasembling the bot. \nIn a half an hour, she had the first bot disected and neatly piled up \nagainst the wall.  She looked at the parts one by one to make sure \nthey were good enough to use.  She found a small chip in the chest \ncavity of the bot.  She pulled it out and looked at it. &quot;Hmmm, what \nhave we here? Ah, it&#39;s the maximal signature chip. How nice. This \ncould come in real...&quot;\nHer fingers slipped and the chip fell down her front armor and into \nher front plating. She frowned. &quot;Now how stupid can a bot get? Butter \nFingers DarkMouse.&quot; she said under her breath.  She reached around \nand tried to get the chip out, but couldn&#39;t reach it.  The chip moved \naround as she moved. The chip came to rest under some wires in her \nupper torso. She frowned but realized that the chip wouldn&#39;t do any \nharm unless it was activated. And she couldn&#39;t properly activate it \nwith it just stuck inside. SO for now, she was safe.  She decided to \nworry about the small and insignificant chip for now and went back to \nwork. She started disecting the second bot. \n\n\n"}}
