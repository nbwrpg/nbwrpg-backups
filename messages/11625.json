She hugged Chordate&#39;s arm a little tighter \nand kissed his neck again. She swayed her hips and waved her tail at \nWolveritron just incase he was looking. She smiled at Chordate. She \nwhispered to him, &quot;So where are we walking to?&quot; She licked the side \nof his neck with her rought tongue.  She noted he tasted good.  In \ncase she got hungry, he would make a good meal for her leopard mode.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Chordate:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He let out a small sigh as Feline began kissing his neck, and \npurring \n&gt; into his audio receptors.  Reaching the access hatch, he put his \nhand \n&gt; against the scanner, putting in a password.  The door opened, \n&gt; Chordate spotting Wolveritron.  &quot;Hey, go on inside.  Situation is \n&gt; under control.&quot; he said, continuing to walk.\n\n\n"}}
