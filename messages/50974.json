Hundreds of years of genetic \nselection had made him a perfect warrior, and he knew he was able to \nsurpass a mere machine, as deadly as it was.\n\nHe dodged two of the flame pillars coming at him but the third burned \nsome armor and paint over his torso. He chose to counter with full \nforce. He launched forty mini-missiles at her, but spread widely. She \nwould barely be able to escape his attack.
