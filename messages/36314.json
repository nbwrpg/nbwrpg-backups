IR pointed to \n&gt; it.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Your target&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then the two beams began to move around the symbol.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You strike the symbol, you dodge the beams. But if you get hit by \n&gt; one...you&#39;ll experience an electric shock that has the same feeling as \n&gt; getting punched in the stomach by any enemy you would face on the field.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Suddenly the beams then began to move in an eragular pattern, \n&gt; unpradictable.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; They&#39;re signature seaking, so watch it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron then stepped back and walked back to the Maximals.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; But if they hit each other they&#39;ll multiply, so if you don&#39;t want a room \n&gt; filled with them I suggest you use your brains to their full extent. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The armor rectacted from around her chest to leave a black, metal tank top \n&gt; while her arms, neck and so on was left bare.
