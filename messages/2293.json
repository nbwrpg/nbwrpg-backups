He loved it.\n\nHe soon gave up on waiting on Megatron. He wasn&#39;t a bot with much patience. \nIf he hadn&#39;t anything to do to occupy himself he&#39;d become twitchy or get \nhimself in trouble.\n\nHe walked through the halls, then though maybe he should pay Rattrap a \nlittle visit.\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: (unknown)\n&gt;Date: Wed, 24 May 2000 17:03:27 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Megatron looks to the tiny bot ::: Ah, yes.
