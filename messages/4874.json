It registered on the site though, message 4801. I&#39;m sending it again just in case some people didn&#39;t see it.)\n\nTavatron�s ears twitched, Iron Raptor�s message disturbing her somewhat peaceful sleep. The darkness that enveloped her sleeping form comforting and welcome, but no longer needed. She slowly opened her optics, letting her eyes adjust to the ark�s artificial light. She stretched, her mouth open in a wide, wolfen yawn exposing multiple steel teeth. That was the only odd thing about her beast mode. Instead of real white, wolf canines, bicuspids and the like she had silver titanium teeth. Quite effective when it came to hunting. Not to mention kicking some Pred and Alliance skid plate.\n\nTavatron groaned as she forced herself to stand, still a little groggy from her nap. She blinked her eyes several times before sending a com to Iron Raptor:\n\n&quot;On my way.&quot;\n\nTavatron left the com open as she gently nudged Dinobot�s neck with her snout to see if he was awake yet. When he failed to respond she leaned close to his snout, her ear inches from his massive jaws. She listened for a few moments. When she was satisfied that he was still breathing she pulled her head back. Being so near to such massive jaws unsettled her. Tavatron spoke into her com unit:\n\n&quot;Dinobot is� unavailable at the moment. I, however, will gladly accompany you.&quot;\n\nTavatron stretched one more time before walking on padded paws to the \nmassive ark doors. She took one last look over her shoulder at Dinobot. As much as she enjoyed his company she didn�t want to wake him from his much needed slumber. She turned back towards the hallway that lay before her, the soft click of her nails on the metallic floor sending a slight shiver down her spine. She never did like that sound, an unfortunate drawback of her beastmode. Tavatron walked across the bridge, mentally surveying the damage. They were in dire need of repairs. A pity that such a large base was not so easily defended. Tavatron walked through the ark doors, the distant clouds threatening rain.\n\nTavatron gazed up at her commander, the corners of her mouth turned up in a slight smile. She was glad to be outdoors, and to be under the command of a competent leader. She had nothing but the utmost respect for Iron Raptor. Not that she had anything against Liono, but even she had to admit that Iron Raptor was a skilled warrior and leader. Tavatron then gazed at the landscape before them, calculating how far behind she would have to remain in order to stay hidden, but not so far behind as to lose sight of her commander. She sighed softly, awaiting orders.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
