Maybe it hadn&#39;t been such \na good idea to attack these two maximals. He turns to run, but a tree branch \nhits him over the head, knocking him out.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator thrown into Iron Raptor&#39;s head by Tritan&#39;s shot and knocked \nbackwards by the impact. He flies up, his jetpack barely pulling off the \npower strain.\n\nOnce sufficiantly high, he opens fire on the three bots on the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl rubs his head as Iron Raptor&#39;s claws blot out his view of Annihilator. \nHe stands up, rubbing his head.\n\n&quot;Warning. Damage level reaching critical. Mech fluid lever low.&quot; Prowl&#39;s \ninternal computer reports in an annoying tone.\n\nProwl swears silently, rolling out from under Iron Raptor&#39;s hand and firing \nup at Annihilator.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnnihilator groans as Prowl&#39;s shot hits him, going up through his stomach. \nThe predacon slowly attemps to land when Tritan&#39;s shots hit him, sending him \nflying off into the distance.\n\n"}}
