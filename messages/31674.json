Astral growls, barking out a command to\ncombine.\n\nThe four Lavacons jump into the air, transforming into various\nbodyparts untill a 40-foot robot stood in front of Rampage, though the\nrobot was missing a left arm. Astral made a mental note to beat the\nslag out of Fenox next time he saw her.\n\n&quot;Die, slagging bot!&quot; Lavatron yells as he lifts his right arm and\npoints the palm at Rampage. Storm clouds gather above him, a lightning\nbolt flying out of his hand, heading for Rampage.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: is the Element firing four EMP blasts, one missile, and five \n&gt; plasma blasts at each bot on the field?\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Razorclaw/Divebomb/Rampage::\n&gt; Razorclaw destroys the missiles being guided at Rippersnapper \n&gt; with his lightning gun in between dodging blasts, though a couple \n&gt; are absorbed into his armour. He follows up by sending three more \n&gt; lightning blasts at Mantle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divebomb transforms, using his heightened agility to dodge straight \n&gt; up many of the shots heading at him. Two of the shots smash into \n&gt; his metallic wings, leaving charred marks, and almost knocking \n&gt; him from the sky. His rocket boosters send him straight up at an \n&gt; increasing speed, away from the near battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rampage is so angry; consequently, he has lost &quot;it&quot;. As one of the \n&gt; laser blasts hits him, he dives to the ground, dodging the missiles \n&gt; and the rest of the shots. He transforms into tiger mode as he hits \n&gt; the ground. Immediately, he begins firing as much as he can, \n&gt; pumping out continues rounds from his four leg mounted machine \n&gt; guns at Astral, and the bots around him.\n\n\n"}}
