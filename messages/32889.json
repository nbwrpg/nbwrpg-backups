I agree that there may be little chance of bonding with\n&gt;all that, and anyways, there IS a rule against superpowerful\n&gt;characters. But in any case, stop bashing each other for every post\n&gt;you make, countless OOC insults back and forth are not fun to read.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., icedemon101@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; [Recon can&#39;t be bonded with them the matrixes. Bnded meaning sharing\n&gt; &gt; with or together. which he is not so that is either another mode or a\n&gt; &gt; lie.]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Angel Prime\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;you wish Recon. you wish the elders would even give a nano second of\n&gt; &gt; there time. Stop waisting my time. when the time comes good will\n&gt; &gt; destroy Unicron. [he is just talking so the owner of unicron plz\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t take any offensce to this.] Right now you are getting on my\n&gt; &gt; nerves. Windlord  I disagree with you. I say Burning Hammer me and\n&gt; &gt; you kill Recon. Vulios,his friend, and Windlord kill the dragon.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Angel Prime fires two fireballs at Recon.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
