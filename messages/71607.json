He too \n&gt; had\n&gt; suffered many injustices from the Predacons, yet he tries to put that \n&gt; behind\n&gt; him as he sees the need to put the past behind him and move ahead.  The\n&gt; future depended on it.  In his draconic form he leaps in front of Rodimus,\n&gt; staring him in the eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;  No, it may look as if I am but in truth I am trying to make a point! \n&gt; Yes\n&gt; we have both lost a great deal to our enemy but we will lose something.\n&gt; GREATER if we don&#39;t learn to. PUT THE PAST BEHIND US!  TIL ALL ARE ONE, \n&gt; were\n&gt; the words of Primus. Till all are one.  Unicron is far beyond our factions\n&gt; alone but, if we work as one faction we have a chance to overpower this \n&gt; new\n&gt; threat.  That is what I am trying to convey.  Leo Prime, that also applies\n&gt; to you, you may not understand my reasoning but in time you will.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS PRIME just looked at TUSCON as if he has just lost his mind,\nhis optics still smoldering with his own inner emotions. &quot;You started\nthis mission in an effort to wipe out the evil.&quot; He said in clipped\ntones. &quot;And yet here we are trying to work with them to destroy a\ngreater evil.&quot;\n\nHe turned to look at TUSCON, optic to optic. &quot;And what do you think\nthey will do should they gain the upper hand, or when this is over?&quot;\n\nFolded his arms across his chest he just looked at TUSCON. &quot;Now is not\nthe time for discussions like this. But if you think I will work with\nCyclonus or any other Predacon without my hand on my weapon and my\nguard up, then you don&#39;t know me.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will finish this mission as is needed.&quot; RODIMUS PRIME said as he\nstepped around TUSCON to continue towards the Dinosaurs. &quot;Then me and\nyou are going to talk.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
