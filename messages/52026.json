And I got an exemption on the faction bit already - it&#39;s \nturned out to be necessary as there&#39;s only one non-cardhead Rogue \nkicking around.  (And her controller is asleep at the switch again.)  \nBTW, Torin hit the dirt and Fury attacked with TWO weapons capable of \nreaching the target - you obviously misread my last post.  (Fury&#39;s \nlashknife works both at a distance and in a melee - it&#39;s a blade \nattached to a handle by an extending cable.)\n\nJayde takes several hits as she scrambles behind cover.  \n\nFury, whirling his lashknife in confusing patterns, closes to easy \nstriking range - still outside Yggdrasil&#39;s reach - and slashes out \nwith the whiplike device.  \n\nGatara and Devilcat also close in, the former trading her machine gun \nfor a long chain and the latter brandishing his laser sword - taking \nthe particle fire on his energy shield.  \n\nTorin and Riekan regroup to one side, waiting for a sniping \nopportunity.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Fine, I just wanted to give him a break before I started to \n&gt; accept lots of damages. And may I remind you that normal faction \nrules \n&gt; say that one player isn&#39;t supposed to possess more than 50% of a \n&gt; faction? Besides, Torin was aimed too.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Yggdrasil knew this was getting very nasty. He managed to fire \n&gt; twice more with his particle canon before two bommerang blades dug \n&gt; deep in his right arm. It started feeling numb and he dropped his \ngun. \n&gt; Torin&#39;s counterattack hit him hard in the abdomen. He tries to \nreach \n&gt; for his barkskin shield to get some cover, but the blast from \n&gt; Devilcat&#39;s and Gatara&#39;s weapon throw him back, missing him by only \n&gt; a few feet in front of him. He stands and is hit by Jayde&#39;s shot. \nHe \n&gt; rises his shield and blocks Fury&#39;s venom shots and turns at Jayde \nand \n&gt; fires wildly his two machine guns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yggdrasil: Freaking preds of my slag!\n\n\n"}}
