I \ncan just wait here.  Really,I&#39;ll be alright. Go and have fun.&quot;\nShe motioned with her hand for him to go. She was feeling really \ndrained.  What little she had done had drained her of what little \nenergy she had.  She needed to rest and she knew it. She also didn&#39;t \nwant her friend to see her in this feeble state much longer. &quot;Well, \ngo on, I&#39;ll be ok.&quot;  the shaking started again.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; (For some reason Egroups isn&#39;t posting.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike:\n \n&gt; Quickstrike held one arm around Dark Mouse&#39;s waist, then put his\n&gt; other arm around the back of her legs, lifting her up in the next\n&gt; moment.
