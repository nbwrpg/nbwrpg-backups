I will try to be \nquicker in my replies.)\n\n** There was no telling just how long he had been out, but for him to lose \nthat much mech-fluid it had to be quite a while.\nDinobot was just barely hanging onto consciousness, or to what little he \ncould grasp with his systems as weak as they were during repair. But it \nwouldn�t take long before he would be able to take on the world again�and \nwin.\nNot many people knew it, and sometimes other TM2s didn�t have the same \nabilities, but every time he was repaired his strength increased for a short \ntime. His systems became faster and more highly placed, faster to process \ndata and even map out complicated attack patters before he every used them.\nHowever, he had just found that out when he had repaired last, so now he \nknew.\n\nHowever, he was not quite in the clear yet. His systems would be weaker now \nwhen he awoke properly before they became stronger, not use to nearly \nbleeding himself dry due to external and internal wounds.\nBut with his repair systems completely activated and functional now, there \nweren�t too many worries in his sleepy mind.\n\nDinobot slightly shifted, his claws losing their grip on the table and \nlaying flat against its smooth surface. His mind was beginning to clear the \nmore his repair system took care of the damage, but he still stayed in a \nstate which hovered between consciousness and semi-stasis lock.\nBut his stomach continued to heave due to the tubes down his throat, weakly \nchoking on them in a futile attempt to bring air into his lungs on his own. \nBut each attempt failed and he just ended up half gagging on the tubes \ninstead, his jaws trying to close but unable to due to the tubes again.\n\nWith his optics at mere slits the work came into a hazy view, finally \nretreating from the darkness in one single flash of light which was fringed \nwith the green haze of his repair system. That blinding light emitted from \nthe outside world almost making him forget what he had seen in his mind, \ndeep within it where he had pushed what feelings he ever thought he could \never have, ever, for anything or anyone.\nBut he didn�t forget, not the images, not the reality, not the last words \nspoken to a mind which knew the truth more then he knew his own spark, a \ntruth which he was not yet ready to accept quite yet. And if he could ever \naccept it and release that truth, it would change his life forever.\n\nBut for now, the world was what occupied his mind as it slowly woke up to \nit, as a small child opening its eyes for the first time and taking in every \nlittle detail of its surroundings with awe and wonder.\nHowever, as unfocused as his world was, he knew what shape�no�person now \nstood over him with a look of the same childlike wonder on her face.\nWatching the green glow of his repair system as it finished up what work it \nhad started, seeing her hazy for reach out and touch one of the green coils.\nSo much information filtered itself into his mother database through that \ncoil, just from that single touch�as brief as it had been. He could read so \nmuch from that single touch. How old she was, her current health, \nstatus�thoughts.\nYes, that one coil could reach into the very recesses of ones mind if they \ndared to stand the pain which was the price for such an experience. But this \ncontact had been so brief that all Dinobot received was a blur of relief and \nworry, yet both had been something he had expected.\n\nAs he looked on at the hazy outline of Tavatron he slightly noticed \nsomething, something about her that he remembered�the shoulder plate! It was \nmissing! That was what had drawn his attention, the mech-fluid crusted \nshoulder with which Tavatron had lost its plate in the battle with the \nAlliance bot Oblitertron, where he had received his own damage; which had \nalmost been the death of him!\nBut why wasn�t she repaired? He should have been out long enough for her to \nhave gone into one of the CR chambers in the room and repaired.\n\nHowever, even as he thought such a thing he remembered something that he \ncould not quite remember fully, something that had been more of a feeling \nthem a sight or a touch which was much easier to recall.\nDuring the early stages of stasis lock, before he had sensed the tubes had \nbeen shoved down his throat and into his stomach, he had sensed that \nsomething which had been there before had left. SomeONE which had been there \nhad left.\nLeft him, not just because they had something else to do�but left HIM.\nIt was hard to understand, but even as he looked up at Tavatron, somehow, \nsomeway�he knew that the one which had left had been her. And what \ninformation that coil had received verified that thought, relaying why she \nhad left, where she had gone when she had left, why she had returned and was \nwith him now.\nBut she had left him�even with all he had done for her�she had abandoned \nhim.\n\nAnd that was a thought he could not get out of his mind, the fact that with \nall they had been through, with all the times he had saved her life�when it \nbecame her turn to help him�she had backed away and simply abandoned him. \nAnd believe it or not, through what sheet of ice covered his spark, that \nfactor actually HURT him.\nIt not only hurt him, but made him feel as if he had been betrayed as \nwell�just as he felt betrayed that the Matrix had denied him such a heroes \ndeath as he so deserved.\nHe had trusted her, saved her life numerous times, risking his very spark, \neven held her and shared what small amounts of feelings he had let \nescape�and this was how she repaid him�by abandoning him?!\nThat was just something in which he could not come to terms with.\nHe wasn�t quite angered by it yet, but�well�he didn�t exactly know just what \nto think if it yet. But this was also by cause that his mind had not quite \nwoken yet.\n\nDinobot watched with mixed feelings as Tavatron reached over and gently \nbrushed his cheek with her fingers, looking up and into her optics as she \ngazed down at him. And it was then that she suddenly came into view, sharp \nand clear.\nHis repair coils unwrapped themselves from his chest and retreated into his \nspark, the cavity simply sliding shut to shut in the light which guided his \nvery life force.\nAnd with sudden realism the tubes suddenly made his stomach heave violently, \nhis systems completely repaired and functioning.\n\nWith a whining of gears and hydraulics which were not use to sudden movement \njust after a long period of stillness he sat up and ripped the tubes from \nhis throat in one fluid movement, then leaning over the side of the table to \nretch a bit. His stomach heaved violently a few more times, threatening to \nbring up what energon was in his stomach left to be digested.\nSo he simply leaned there on his side, coughing a few times and trying as \nhard as he could to keep the energon down. But then, when his stomach had \nfinally calmed a bit and he no longer knew the threat to throw up was there \nanymore he sat up once again but hung his head a bit, his throat a little \nraw from bringing those tubes up so quick.\n\nDinobot listened to the silence of the room as he simply sat there, \nrecovering from waking up so quickly and performing actions with which his \nbody was not yet ready to perform. Breathing deeply he took air into his \nlungs on his own since a few mega-cycles ago. But even as he sat there and \nsimply took everything in, Tavatron�s little trip from his side swamped back \ninto his main thoughts. But this time he was awake enough to react with a \nreasonable and quite rational feeling, anger.\nBut also there was the little matter of that comment she made only moments \nbefore he had sat up, a comment which needed his much-required response.\nHe then turned his optics towards Tavatron with a very deep growl, and wore \nan expression on his face which was something he was sure Tavatron had never \nseen in the entire time she had known him.\nA look of complete disrespect.\nAnd his voice was the exact same, with a tone which would have made a priest \nlook twice**\n\n� Negative. Only a warrior could kill me.
