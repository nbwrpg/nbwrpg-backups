His expression as wise\n&gt; as the one on Master Yoketron&#39;s face whenever he was challenged by students\n&gt; who felt he was a bit of a pushover.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Is that what you believe, Hot Rod?  Have you ever engaged me formally in\n&gt; combat?  And have you ever really seen beyond what your eyes see now?  I\n&gt; will not believe your words until you have proven that to me, face to face.\n&gt; One  can never fully assume until he has proven himself in valid combat.  So\n&gt; I take it you are challenging me.  In that case, I accept.  But be prepared,\n&gt; I am NOT as predictable as you think I am.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a walk around Rodimus, waiting for his reaction.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; nightlight started to wake up but she felt weak and an overhelming pain\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWalking around DARK RODIMUS entailed walking around the the force\nshield that at the moment protected him as well as the others. On the\nother side of the shield other soldiers are also appearing out of the\ncave opening on the other side of the shield.\n\nSHARKTICONS stepped out, accompanied by their dreaded master SKYBYTE.\nThen there are soldiers who look like various forms of dinosaurs, all\nof them heavily armored. They would not be push overs in a fight.\n\nNIGHTLIGHT was in a corner tucked away by DARK RODIMUS. Next to her\nwere the inert forms of STAMPY and SHARPEDGE.\n\nSTAMPY&#39;s foot twitched slightly, but he made no other sound or movement.\n\nMeanwhile near the edge of the shield DARK RODIMUS turned to look at\nTUSCON an almost feral smile on his face, &quot;You have no idea what I&#39;m\ncapable of either.&quot; He said in menacing tones. &quot;You think your master\nYokatron is the only one.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;He was just an old fool.&quot;\n\nEven as DARK RODIMUS was speaking MAGMATRON turned to glance at DARK\nRODIMUS. &quot;Quiet!&quot; He said &quot;and prepare, battle is coming!&quot;\n\nAt the same time there was a rumbling sound as the whole chamber began\nto shake! The fire that had been bathing OPTIMUS in yellow and orange\nenergies began to shift and turn colors!\n\n&quot;What the slag?&quot; SABERBACK said as he turned to gape as the pillar of\nflame like energies turned crimson red and then jet black, the fire\nsweeping over OPTIMUS.\n\nThe whole chamber began to shake is great cracks appeared along the floor!\n\nFrom above the Stalactites began to drop to the ground like huge\nspears, crashing to the floor. The water that had been rushing into\nthe room began to fall into the fissures that were opening up looking\nlike miniature waterfalls!\n\nThe shield itself began to buckle and flicker as the disruptive\nenergies flowed through it as well. Jagged black energy flowed through\nthe once translucent energy of the shield, at the same time the\nblackened energy flowed along OPTIMUS&#39; frame, flickering between\nhimself, MAGMATRON, the shield and then back to OPTIMUS himself.\n\nOPTIMUS made no movement, no response as his very armor darkened as if\nbeing burned!\n\nMeanwhile the surrounding shield flickered once and then a second time\nand then finally there was the sound of a pop and then the shield\ndropped.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
