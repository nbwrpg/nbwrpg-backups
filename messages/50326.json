You are strong. However, being \na Clansman... err... Clansbot in your case, that is more than \ntechniques. It is a lot of training, and probably a major change of \nminds. We Clans value zellbringen, single combat. Even in a melee, we \ntend to engage no more than one enemy at the time. Also, honor is \nabove everything else in every aspect of our life... except maybe \npolitics, but that is easily answered through combat. Are you willing \nto become a Clan Warrior?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Owlhawk braced himself and put his hands in front of\n&gt; him to absorb most of the shock of running into the\n&gt; wall.

If Katya does not\n&gt; &gt; agree, I will be your \n&gt; &gt; trainer.
