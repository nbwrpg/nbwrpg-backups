A \ngolden hue tendril had wrapped around the Chaos-Bringer&#39;s head and he looked \nlike he had frozen in place.  In reality he was directly linked to the highly \nadvanced computer based on similar creations by numerous alien species that \nUnicron had devoured in his long fruitful life.\n\nThe tendril unwrapped itself and Unicron&#39;s optics seemed to glow a little \nbrighter.  &quot;We must make some modifications to Teufel.  And you, Vehement, \nmust learn more about this volcanic fortress and its secrets.&quot;\n\n&quot;Understood, mighty Unicron.  For the betterment of our cause.  What shall I \ndo?&quot;\n\n&quot;Step to the Guardian and let meld with you and it will do the rest.&quot;\n\n&quot;As you command.&quot; Vehement said, stepping up to the computer.  A golden hue \ntendril extended from the glow of the Guardian and wrapped around Vehement&#39;s \nhead, his face nothing more than a blank expression.\n\n&quot;Now, Teufel, it is time to perfect you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Begriff, allmachtige Fuhrer.&quot; the robot replied, speaking in German with a \ndeep German accent.\n\nTeufel walked over to a chamber, the doors sealing.  Unicron walked over to \nthe chamber and put his hand on a golden panel, his hand and forearm lightly \nglowing gold and his optic sensors going from emerald to black.\n\n"}}
