Skyblaze comes up \nbeside her and puts a hand on her shoulder.  &quot;What&#39;s bothering you, \nchild?  You&#39;ve been here for over an hour.&quot;\n\n&quot;Father ...&quot; Phoenix looks at her aging kin.  &quot;I have to go back.  I \ncan&#39;t abandon Flicker - especially now that I have my memory back.&quot;\n\n&quot;You miss him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;  For a while, the two stand there, looking in the direction of \nthe Predacon base.\n\nThen Skyblaze speaks up again.  &quot;The Predacons aren&#39;t the ideal race \nto associate with.  Once they learn what you&#39;re capable of ...&quot;\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t leave Flicker.  I owe him too much.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then I will accompany you.&quot;  Phoenix starts, and looks up at \nSkyblaze.\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;Your power is unlike any other Lumin, my dear.  You&#39;ve been forced \ninto the shell of a transformer, and that has changed you.  You have \nto learn to control that power, otherwise you&#39;re a constant danger to \nyourself and those around you.&quot;\n\n&quot;And you can ... teach me to control it?  To stop the surges?&quot;  \nPhoenix moves a little closer, hoping beyond hope.\n\n&quot;I will try,&quot; Skyblaze promises, hugging his daughter.  &quot;You&#39;re all I \nhave left in the universe.&quot;\n\nThe pair of them fly off, Phoenix transforming to beast mode, and \nSkyblaze returning to his natural energy-based state.\n\n\n"}}
