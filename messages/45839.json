His night \nvision \n&gt; comes online, and he chuckles to himself. &lt;Hmm, thus one of \n&gt; Firestrike&#39;s weaknesses is uncovered (no means of night vision), \n&gt; perhaps unwittingly... oh well, there can be only one end to this \n&gt; situation&gt;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Softly, Switchblade presses a few buttons on the control panel, \nand \n&gt; positions himself so that Firestrike isn&#39;t in his line of fire. \n&gt; Silently, he whips two energon daggers at Perceptor, one at each \n&gt; shoulder, hoping that Firestrike&#39;s distraction would be sufficient \n&gt; to finish this.\n\n\n"}}
