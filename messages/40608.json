This is an \nRPG board,\nnot a general discussion board. If you want to discus something, do \nit over\nprivate email or on the message board on the site.\n\nI don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the \ncompletely\npointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great RPer. Now \nshut up and\ntake the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. The moment I see a char \nwith even\na variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, you&#39;ll regret it. In adition, stop \nmoding.\nYou can&#39;t make other people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for \nMustex even\nattempting to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you \nhave no part\nin the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no \nlogical way\nof knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to have them have \nthat\ninsight. Either explain how they know or drop that storyline. It \nmakes no\nsence. Also, you never even landed that lowlife seller or whatever of \nyours on\nthe planet, and I&#39;m not going to write your profiles for you. Shape \nup. Read\nthe rules and act by them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting \non every\npost. The council will catch it if its moding.\n\nEveryone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t post \nat all. I&#39;m\nvery sick of coming home from work and reading through 100 or so damn \nOOC\nposts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who sends an OOC ever \nagain. I won&#39;t,\nbut keep in mind that I&#39;m on the verge of turning into a very mean \nperson.\n\nFrom now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the site&#39;s \nmessage\nboard. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of it, as I said \nlike 10\ntimes already in this post.\n\nThere. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC messages \nstop. Its\nvery hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all this \npointless crap is\nstarting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
