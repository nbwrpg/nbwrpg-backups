It would have been better if we had had a council discussion with regards to the situation though. Analysis is best.\n&gt; \n&gt; LN:\n&gt; \n&gt; Alright, calm down and listen. You seem to be missing what I was trying to say. I think you&#39;d better reread my last post, and rethink your &#39;speech&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll admit, my last post was somewhat one sided, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from believing that mistakes can&#39;t be fixed. You say that I appease whiners? (Appease is not quite the right word for what you were trying to say, look it up in the dictionary.) How can you possibly consider them whiners when I spend more of my time trying figure out how to deal with you?! \n&gt; \n&gt; When you say the popular people get their ways, why do you say that those people are popular?\n&gt; \n&gt; ||... If you really want to be a good council member rauq and let the RPG develop then let charachters live through the choice they make. ...||\n&gt; \n&gt; Characters develope in the rpg without our help all the time. Choices only decide certain outcomes. What do you have to lose by letting BN return to Airly&#39;s control? (look at my examples in the below paragraph) Only some stuff gets erased, and that stuff is simply incorrect in the rpg.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well. I never (this is a damning word, so i&#39;ll prolly get slapped later for it) said you have to erase your posts; I wanted you to talk to Airly and figure out how you can somehow allow BN to return to Airly&#39;s control. I don&#39;t want you to &quot;kill&quot; your story line, and I don&#39;t want you to erase the past. What I do want you to do, is to work out a side story line where BN somehow escapes, or the Infecticons bug her and use her as a spy, or (as Orchestra was trying to do) have a bot remove her spark and give her a new body, or something else. I seem to be able to think of many ideas, can you think of any?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just because a choice was made in the past, doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s results can&#39;t change in the futur. True, Airly might be regretting her decision now, but instead of simply whining about it, she is doing something. NOW, before I say anything more, I&#39;d like to know, Airly, if you have said anything to LN, with respect to getting BN out of her predicament.\n&gt; \n&gt; Focus your misguided anger in a productive direction; don&#39;t prove your instability to the rpg, nobody needs/wants to hear it.\n\n\n"}}
