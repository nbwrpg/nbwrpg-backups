An exchange in return for the\n&gt; &gt; truce and our cooperation=\r\n that they will have to pay to weaken and divide\n&gt; &gt; them further. In retur=\r\nn for our assistance, we should request an intact\n&gt; &gt; stasis pod with spark=\r\ned protoform to remake toa  Predacon.  If they want our\n&gt; &gt; assistane then =\r\nthey can pay a price for it while at the same time dividing\n&gt; &gt; thier own t=\r\nroops by having to pay such a thing, which we can later take\n&gt; &gt; advantage =\r\nof.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; VICE GRIP pondered, &quot;The Maximals will be more apt to expect a=\r\n direct double\n&gt; &gt; cross in the field when it is over.  So if we do coopera=\r\nte with them and do\n&gt; &gt; not instantly engage them when whatever this crisis=\r\n is is over, it would\n&gt; &gt; disrupt any counter schemes they might have.  As =\r\nwell as keeping the new\n&gt; &gt; elements of our forces out of sight for now all=\r\nows us to take a more\n&gt; &gt; opportune moment to exploit it later, as well as =\r\nletting us gague what the\n&gt; &gt; reinforcements this new PRIME has brought wti=\r\nh him and what his own\n&gt; &gt; capabiliteis are.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a n=\r\nod of the head from SKYSHADOW as he glanced at HYDRAS.\n&gt; Obviously he was g=\r\noing to play the role of a loyal lackey, especially\n&gt; when their leader was=\r\n so close at hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I agree. I would imagine that our Lord Hydras has =\r\nplans in mind that\n&gt; would cover all of this.&quot; He said slyly, trying to kee=\r\np from assuming\n&gt; too much command lest HYDRAS lash out at him.\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYSHA=\r\nDOW folded his hands together before him in a gesture of\n&gt; humility. &quot;And I=\r\n would think that the Maximals would never send out a\n&gt; Prime without soldi=\r\ners to go with him. The question is why? They have\n&gt; not sent out a Prime i=\r\nn years.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You see, the Predacons were not properly aware of the crash =\r\nof the\n&gt; prison ship and the release of so many prisoners onto old Earth. N=\r\nor\n&gt; had anyone yet figured out how much the cumulitive affect of all these=\r\n\n&gt; constant battles could be having on the timeline.
