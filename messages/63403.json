Well, how\nabout, for a while. A short while. On second thought, I&#39;ll just get\nyou later on, when you least expect it.&quot; she said with a slightly evil\ngrin. She knew it was rather a one sided tickle fight. And her honor\nwouldn&#39;t let her do it for long. But as a femme and having fun with a\nbot that she felt was her spark mate, it was ok to do it once in a while.\n\nShe looked upward towards the forests. &quot;I wonder how close we are?&quot;\nStill holding his hands, she nudged her arm scanner with her other\nhand, still in his grasp, and checked the screen. &quot;Hmm, just two\nclicks south, and we&#39;re there.&quot;  She smiled up at him and kissed his\ncheek. &quot;See? We&#39;re at the edge of the forest now, and soon we&#39;ll be at\nour target zone.&quot;  She put the scanner away and smiled lovingly at\nhim. She leaned up and kissed him again. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; He was taken by suprise by her reaction to his confession.  He was\nticklish to a degree, but not the wide range organic life could feel.\n But he did jerk away involentarily, and did laugh.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Ah!  My secret&#39;s out!&quot; he laughed as she continued.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now that he thought about it, it was kinda unfair, he was ticklish\nand she wasn&#39;t.  He make up for that difference later, when she least\nexpected it.  but for now he had to try and evade the tickling without\nletting go of her hand.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
