She turned to Necross and splattercannon and told them to pull him to his feet as she lessened the gravity holding him down.  The males obeyed and pulled Malice up roughly.  The bounty hunter leaned against Splattercannon as the sudden climbing to his feet made him a little light headed.  He stood up straight and tried to look behind him, because he couldn&#39;t see that mischevious Hellplague and that was cause for worry.  The Sweep commander shoo-ed away Necross and Splattercannon as she wrapped her arms around Malice&#39;s waist.   The males obeyed with hesitation, while Necross left the room entirely, Splattercannon took position by the door.  Malice looked at the arms around his waist and looked back at the femme biehind him.  It was at this time he actually noticed, she was kinda pretty.  She looked\n like a Generation One Decepticon, only with no insignia.  But the though passed out of his mind as quickly as it entered.\n&quot;&#39;Scuse me, but I fel I must tell you something.

Besides, I can offer you more than that Maximal-&quot;\n&quot;Maxitron actually,&quot; the hunter corrected,&quot;it seems she was dumped here on accident while dealing with her universe&#39;s Unicron.&quot; he added with a grin.\n&quot;Whatever.  It doesn&#39;t matter, my pet WILL come around and accept me.
