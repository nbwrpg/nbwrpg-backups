I value \nyour word.  And yes, I agree, killing the Allience would make it \nweasier to kill the Maximals.  But my thinking is this, why not kill \ntwo birds with one stone.  Have Megatron fight the maximals and let \nMegatron get himself killed off.  Then we with Aracnia&#39;s help can \nfight the allience.  Once that is done, then we can finish off what \nfew maximals might remain.  Or do you think that I am not thinking \nclearly.  I would let the others perrish, but our pack here would \nremain.  I won&#39;t put you or the others in any risk unless absolutly \nnessassary.  I don&#39;t want to loose my pack. Please tell me you \nunderstand this.  You, Drillbit, Starscream, Famine, all others.  I \nam not like other Predacon leaders.  I will not sacrifice my pack for \nmyself.  I would rather give myself up and die before I loose any of \nyou.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  He swallowed. He didn&#39;t know what he could do. &quot;Do not be angry \nwith me. But \n&gt; we must discuss this. I care for you too much at this point to see \nyou make \n&gt; this mistake. Megatron will only cause your death. I am aware of \nyour clone \n&gt; of yourself.&quot; he went on a knee and lowered his head...&quot;I will not \nlet it \n&gt; come to that and that is why I need you to trust in my judgment. I \nknow that \n&gt; why you chose me for advisor. But also if you keep makeing plans \nagainst the \n&gt; maximals than my total plan woll fall apart. Even if you try to \ndestroy the \n&gt; maximals the allaincw will always end up saveing them. So we must \nattack the \n&gt; head. Destroy the alliance first. Then the maximals.&quot; he stood up \nand awaited \n&gt; for a responce.\n\n\n"}}
