But then her attention was averted back towards Prowl as she felt a little excitement in his body as he held her, and she knew that when 100 feet up in the air that could be very dangerous!\nShe could feel that he was enjoying holding her but this was hardly the time or place, she just hoped that this little fact wouldn&#39;t distract him to the point of taking his mind off of the battle where it should be�not the feel of her curves under his hand�s touch.\nBut then she suddenly heard something coming towards them and she dearly hoped that it wasn&#39;t a tree like last time, when turning her head and looked she then wished that it WAS a tree!\nShe saw the laser hit and cut through Prowl&#39;s wing and grimaced when they went into a spiral, now she knew why she hated flying!\nHer stomach felt like it was in her throat as she then realized that they were in a glide, her hands and legs clinging to Prowl as she pressed her body to him. She slowly opened her optics but still clung, fearing that they might have been scrap by now or have hit hard�but then hadn�t.\nIron Raptor then looked up at Prowl as they lost altitude; she was damaged enough without having to crash!\nThanx to the fact that he couldn�t keep his mind on the battle when she was near him. She was flattered but also a bit pissed off; this wasn�t the first time that his wondering mind had caused trouble.\nShe sighed with a bit of annoyance but also a bit of expectance, she knew that he loved her but this was just ridicules. *\n\n&quot; Keep your mind on the battle and not on me for a change, Feather Head!�\n\n* Her tone was that of a bit of amusement and annoyance mixed, there was no harsh tinge to her voice at all as she then looked back into the optics of Prowl. But then shook her head, she knew that their landing wouldn�t be the best in the world but she hoped that it wouldn�t be too rough that he fell over, she was damaged and so was he�they didn�t need further damage. \nIron Raptor then looked past Prowl�s optics and at the hole in his wing in which was the cause of them slowly losing altitude, if only there was a way to patch it fast enough that they could regain their height and get to safety. She growled, but there wasn�t a way to patch it! Not here so high but when she looked over her shoulder she then gasped�they weren�t so high anymore!\nIron Raptor looked around for the position of Oblitertron as she then heard the ground rush up, her own legs ready to absorb the impact for Prowl�s damaged leg. The Alliance mightmare wasn�t too far off but just far enough away for them to be out of it�s firing range.\nThe landing wasn�t too bad but it was bad enough that it caused Iron Raptor to land on her back and then flip onto her damaged side, a yip of pain heard as a sharp rock dug into her side.\nWith a rather pained groan she then rose to her feet but then walked over to Prowl, wondering if he was all right and not knowing how the fall had damaged him. With a gentle hand she then reached out to him, concern in her optics but also the panicked need to get him to a CR chamber but a bit relaxed that the Alliance enemy had now split up and was less of a threat. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
