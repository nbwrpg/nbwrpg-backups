Remembering she shining place that he was really destined to be, the\n&gt; Matrix.\n&gt; The more he remembered about his journey to the Matrix the more he\nrealized\n&gt; something, important.\n&gt; Which he unconsciously spoke out loud.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Life is not appreciated until one no longer has it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** But even his metallic lips moved to the words, the real impact was\nwithin\n&gt; himself.\n&gt; It was all a lie. For him, once he had had it, he didn&#39;t want to go back.\n&gt; His previous life still haunted him, and locked him in the same attitude\nand\n&gt; ways he remembered before.\n&gt; Nothing had changed about him, other then his appearance.\n&gt; Dinobot had at least thought that it would be different this time, that\nhis\n&gt; spark wouldn&#39;t be locked in the same shard of ice as before.\n&gt; That he might be able to have a proper sense of life, learn to have fun\nlike\n&gt; everyone else, maybe even learn to love.\n&gt; But NO!\n&gt; He was the same sparkless slag as he was before, and nothing, NOTHING had\n&gt; changed.\n&gt; Dinobot slammed his, now balled, fists into the scales of Necroamncer, his\n&gt; eyes clenched shut in utter disappointment, shame and hate.\n&gt; He wasn&#39;t supposed to be here, not alive and breathing! He was supposed to\n&gt; be in the Matrix, nothing more then a lost memory in this world. A story\n&gt; told to others when asked, just a tale.\n&gt; But NO!\n&gt; He had been cheated! Tricked into believing that there was something\nbeyond\n&gt; this life, into believing that there really was a place for honored\nwarriors\n&gt; like he was to finally rest and disappear into oblivion.\n&gt; His deed of saving the humans was worth THIS?!\n&gt; Leaving to journey to the Matrix, only to be forced back and to live\nagain?!\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t fair, it wasn&#39;t right!\n&gt; Dinobot suddenly got to his feet in one abrupt movement, bit head snapping\n&gt; towards the dimming stars with a roar of complete rage.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; What sort of SICK joke is THIS?!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** He had been steaming over this ever since he had merged with this\n&gt; transmehal 2 body, ever since he had returned.\n&gt; He had lied to himself over and over again that it was great to be alive\n&gt; again, when all he really wanted was to simply rest in peace!\n&gt; He hadn&#39;t returned to Earth willingly, even though he had never reached\nthe\n&gt; Matrix.\n&gt; Something had drove him back against his will, and now he was here\nfighting\n&gt; the same slaging war that he had helped create.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t fair!\n&gt; Dinobots silver fangs gleamed in the dying star and moonlight, his sides\n&gt; heaving in the deep breaths he took.\n&gt; His rage was rising again, and thus his pulse was speeding up.**\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; You brought me back here! WHY?!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ** He was hoping that the Matrix, the very thing that he was question to\n&gt; find, would hear his roars of rage.\n&gt; Not caring if a bot in this world thought he was crazy for speaking to the\n&gt; sky, though he knew for a fact that it heard him.\n&gt; Even though he didn&#39;t know it, maybe the reason that he was always so\n&gt; injured after battles was because he was secretly hoping that he would die\n&gt; again.\n&gt; But it wouldn&#39;t even be half as honorable as his past death, the very\ndeath\n&gt; that was supposed to grant him into the Matrix.\n&gt; But even as he glared into the heavens, there was no answer.\n&gt; Simply silence.and the light flaps of a dragons wings.\n&gt; Dinobot growled sharply and bowed his head, his clawed hands digging into\n&gt; their fists. Mech-fluid spilling and splattering onto the scales of\n&gt; Necromancer.\n&gt; His silver face completely shrouded in shadow, only the red slits of his\n&gt; eyes visible.\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t fair!\n&gt; And he was the one paying for it!**\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
