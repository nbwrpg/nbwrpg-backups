She grabbed KitKat by the arm and pulled \nher close. Before KitKat could react, she struck. She sunk her long \nfangs into KitKat&#39;s throat and injected an overdose of venom. She \ndrained her venom sack into KitKat&#39;s body and then pushed KitKat&#39;s \nbody to the floor.\n\nKitKat::\nShe was dumb struck as she watched Diamond sink her fangs into her \nneck. She felt the pain as the long fangs went deep inside.  She \ncouldn&#39;t move, or scream.  The venom was fast acting and within \nmoments, she felt light headed and dizzy. The pain was gone, and the \nroom started to spin.  She didn&#39;t even feel herself fall to the \nfloor. She heard her body make a small thump as she fell, but that \nwas all. She had no fear in her eyes, but had a questioning look on \nher face. She stared up at Diamond as her vision became fuzzy.\n\nDiamond::\nShe smiled evilly and bent down to KitKat&#39;s head. &quot;You want to know \nwhy. I can tell by that look on your face.&quot;\nShe reached down and picked up KitKat. She walked over to the far \ncorner of the room, it was darker and might conceal the body for a \nwhile. At least long enough to make her escape. She set KitKat&#39;s body \nin a chair in the corner.  She leaned down and grinned. &quot;My lord \nZardus wished it. And so it has happened. Don&#39;t worry, the venom will \nfinish it&#39;s work in few moments. Your already past the point of help.&quot;\nshe stood up and grinned. She bowed to KitKat.&quot;you have had the honor \nof being killed by me.&quot;\n\nWith that, Diamond turned and left the conference room.  She closed \nthe door behind her and walked away.  She made it to the main \ncorridor.  She saw two male bots fighting and DarkMouse standing \nagainst the wall.  She smiled and walked past them all, calm and \nnonshallantly.  She walked out of the entrance and then outside. She \nlooked around to make sure she wasn&#39;t followed. She set out in a dead \nrun.  She made her way to her pod. &quot;Pod, power up&quot;\nThe pod computer started up and activated the engines.  She sat down \nin the pilot seat and engaged the thrusters.  Pressing a few buttons, \nthe pod lifted up off the ground and headed off towards the Allience \nbase.\n\n::KitKat:;\n\nShe sat in the chair, her body feeling numb all over.  Her breathing \nwas getting harder. She moved her arms, but couldn&#39;t feel them.  She \nopened her commlink. &quot;Drill.....bit....help...&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
