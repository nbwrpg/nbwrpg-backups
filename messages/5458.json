Striker got a good head start on him, but he could \nstill smell his fresh trail up ahead. It was nice to finally run with \nanother wolf. He just wished Striker wouldn&#39;t be moving so fraggin \nfast.\n\nLunarpine stopped in about 10 miles out and kept his scanners tuned \nto Striker. if anything happened it would be his responsibility to \nlay down enough coverfire that Striker could escape.\n\n&quot;Open direct link to Striker.&quot;Lunarpine told his internal computer.\n&quot;This is Lunarpine to Striker, Give me the all clear and I&#39;ll come to \njoin you. If not then I got your back.&quot;\nHe knew coverfire against a ship that size would be essentially \nuseless, but there were just some protocalls you just didn&#39;t \noverlook. Letting an ally go into a possibly dangerous situation \nwithout backup was one of them.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Striker/Ramulus/Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker jumps over a hill, his wolf beastmode easily running \nthrough the \n&gt; savanas of Africa. He looks around. It was open fields for miles \naround, \n&gt; almost nothing other than grass growing there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker smiles. A siege on a ship in this terrain would be suicidal \nfor the \n&gt; attackers. There were no obstacles to hide behind, nothing to use \nto their \n&gt; advantage.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks forward, seeing the Maximal battle cruser ahead of him. \nNearing it, \n&gt; he transforms into robot mode, aproaching the ship.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster looks at the scanners as the beep, announcing a bot \naproaching. He \n&gt; hesitates before checking its faction, but is relieved to find that \nit is \n&gt; Maximal. He smiles. Finally they have made contact with the bots \nthat they \n&gt; were sent to help. He stands up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll go check it out,&quot; he says to the remainder of his crew and \nwalks out of \n&gt; the door.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker looks at the bot coming out of the opening hatch of the \nship. \n&gt; Glancing down at his scanners, he is relieved to find that the bot \nis Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I must say you chose a great spot to crash in,&quot; he says to the bot \n&gt; aproaching him, &quot;Attacks on this place would be suicidal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster grins. &quot;Thanks. My name&#39;s Kluster. I&#39;m the commander on \nthis ship.&quot; \n&gt; He stretches out a hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker nods. &quot;I&#39;m Striker. One of the Maximals here.&quot; He stretches \nout his \n&gt; own hand, the two Maximals shaking hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; They both turn their heads at the sound of hooves, seeing Ramulus \nrunning up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ramulus, this is Kluster,&quot; Striker says, &quot;Kluster, this is \nRamulus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus and Kluster nod. Kluster looks at the two Maximals in front \nof him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, how&#39;s the war going?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker sighs. &quot;Not too well, actually,&quot; he admits, &quot;A predacon \nattack has \n&gt; recently nearly destroyed our base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The smile disapears from Kluster&#39;s face. &quot;Any casualties?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker nods. &quot;Two.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster nods. &quot;Well, down to buisness.&quot; he says, &quot;The Maximal \nelders sent me \n&gt; here to help you guys out. They gave me equipment, this ship, and a \ncrew. The \n&gt; ship can support up to 140 Maximals, and can fight back quite a few \npreds, \n&gt; too! If your base is crap, you can move in here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker blinks in surprise. &quot;M-m-m-m,&quot; he stampers out in \nsurprise, &quot;Wow. \n&gt; That&#39;s a lifesaver.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster grins. &quot;I&#39;ll tell the rest of the crew we&#39;ll be having \nguests.&quot; His \n&gt; face darkens, &quot;What&#39;s left of them at least.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Striker nods, &quot;I&#39;ll come with you. Ramulus, go get the others \nready. We&#39;re \n&gt; moving in.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus nods, rather reluctantly turning around and heading back \ntoward the \n&gt; Ark. He stops, blinking. He had forgotten all about Longhunter! \nRamulus looks \n&gt; around, looking to see if she was anywhere around.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker follows Kluster into his ship, looking around at the \nimpressive \n&gt; defences. When they reach the bridge, Kluster looks at his \ncrew. &quot;Everyone, \n&gt; this is Striker, here&#39;s a Maximal on this planet,&quot; he says, &quot;The \nMaximals \n&gt; have been having some tough times lately, and are in need of a \nbase. The ship \n&gt; can support up to 140 bots, so we&#39;ll be having company soon.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
