He =\r\nknew his sword was not big as Magmatrons nor was it made to handle its powe=\r\nr.  Knowing that, he opts not to use the sword.    Narrowing a brow in thou=\r\nght he quickly goes from robot to beast mode, landing on his hind feet and =\r\nusing his front legs as arms and hands.     \n&gt; \n&gt; The sword may not have th=\r\ne strength nor the size but he knew his tail could be strong and long enoug=\r\nh of a weapon for him.  With surprising grace he whirls the tail masterfull=\r\ny into a coil and slaps at Magmatrons sword to attempt a tail block by slap=\r\nping it with the side of the skinnier part of his long tail with a forceful=\r\n swipe.  His long neck coils back like that of a serpent ready to strike.  =\r\nYet he remains calm without any explosive temperamental outbursts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; A=\r\n worthy opponent indeed.  But can you face me in  your own beast mode as I =\r\nam facing you in mine?  You seem attached to your robot mode, Magmatron, is=\r\n there something you&#39;re not telling me, about your level of expertise?  Or =\r\nis it that because you are contrived of a mixture of creatures that are not=\r\n known for combative agility?  As you can well imagine, a dragon faces simi=\r\nlar weaknesses.  And you may ask yourself why would a dragon take on a post=\r\nure that would expose him to injury?  Or is it that the dragon may have lea=\r\nrned to adapt to such weaknesses?  Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a very charismatic i=\r\nndividual but, are you witty enough to step outside the box?  Let&#39;s see if =\r\nyou are.  Come on then, I&#39;m sure a beast of your caliber can make short wor=\r\nk of a smaller mountain dragon.  Show me what you&#39;re really made of, transf=\r\norm, and face me in your beast mode!
