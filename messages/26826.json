Liono tries to stab at\n&gt;Motormaster again.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Dark Convoy fiddles with the settings of his gun for a moment, aiming\n&gt;it at Motormaster again. He fires three larger plasma blasts at the\n&gt;bot.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Seeing EndBringer taking on Koj, Killfest turns and boosts away from\n&gt;the two bots, heading toward Dark Convoy and firing his EMP rifle.\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;Koj smiles as EndBringer&#39;s electricity surges through him, his\n&gt;circuits adapting and absorbing most of it. A normal bot would be\n&gt;frying by now, but Koj had an ability to absorb energy. The Maximal\n&gt;takes out his lance, jabbing it into EndBringer&#39;s stomach.\n\n\nAs the energy fire fizles around him, one of the blasts hiting his foot, he\nfeels the familiar feel of the blade in his side again, he pulls his\nCyclone gun out of subaspace and whirls around, smoke pouring out of his\nnew wound, &quot;Back offf&quot; He shouts, opening fire at pointblank.\n\n\n\n"}}
