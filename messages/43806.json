He stopped trying to focus his eyes, as\nhis arms transformed into his trademark Piledrivers, and he blindly\nswung out at the direction the foot came from.\n\nSoundwave narrowly rolled out of the way of the rocket, but not the\nexplosion, as the shock sent Soundwave flying like a rag doll as his\nbody bounced off the ground several feet away.\n \nSpasstik&#39;s forward assault was cut short by the attack on him, as the\nforce of the blasts also sent him slidding away, grinding against the\nground. He stopped near Soundwave, and nudged the comunicator&#39;s arm,\ntrying to get a response, as Soundwave slowly began to try and push\nhimself into an upright position.\n\n"}}
