I am trying to create a cohesive history of things and I\nam creating what Cybertron is now and this is will require a soft\nreboot of Cybertron. I am basing it in part on our sister RPG site:\n\nhttp://wikihost.org/wikis/nbwrpg_wiki/wiki/start\n\nAs well as using Transformers Animated for the general FEEL and\nATMOSPHERE of Cybertron today. My history for Beast Wars basically\nuses G1/G2 cartoon from the 80&#39;s with elements from the comics and\nperhaps some of the other toons for spice. I am ignoring Beast\nMachines, although if someone wants or needs elements from it it can\nbe incorporated into what we have. For me Cybertron is still metal and\nthe Maximal council rules, and there is a cold war of sorts going on\non Cybertron between the Maximals and the Predacons. Decepticons and\nAutobots exist but are consider rare and odd, Decepticons are to be\nhunted down and Autobots are considerfed relics of times past.\n\nNone of this should affect what has already happened here on old\nEarth, but if anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free\nto let me know. I have a time line in the works to help put things\ninto perspective.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
