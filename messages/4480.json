If you don&#39;t hurry up Hell Beast will thin I&#39;m faking \nand will kill us all! Make Battera a TM3 and  bring the driver here.&quot;\n\nVulois found Hell Beast again.\n\n&quot;So, about what I said before. Terminess is brilliant! All the needs \nis a tiny lab to work on things. How about it?&quot;\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTerminess, without her lab yet, had no particular thing to work on. \nShe decided that she should work on strengthening the shields and \nauto-guns incase of attack. She left immendiatly for the control room.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n \n\nBronco, staring at an unconsious Octociz, radiod back in to the \nMaximal base.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m serious Maximals! You have 4 mega-cycles left or Octociz gets \nit. Meet me at the cliff where the Axalon fell intot the sea, or \nyou&#39;ll be down one more Maximal!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
