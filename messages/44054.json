As he slowed his pace pulling up beside the tyrant.\n\nMegatron reached down and hooked his fusion cannon to his arm. He then\nlooked down, &quot;Soundwave, Eject the Frenzy cassette. Immidiatly the\ncassette door on Soundwave opened up, as the red and black cassette flew\nloose, then transforming and growing into the cassette warrior. \n\nSoundwave then autimatically realayed the message from Perceptor to\nMegatron. &quot;We are currently pulling out, but Firestrike has gone crazy,\nand I can&#39;t afford to lose any troops right now. Continue towards base.&quot;\nHe looked down to Frenzy. &quot;Frenzy pull Soundwave and Triggerhappy out of\nhere.&quot; Then he turned his attention to Spasstik and Blowpipe, &quot;Prepare\nto open fire on my mark.&quot; Frenzy took the miniature cassette player\n(Soundwave) from Spasstik, then gripped Triggerhappy as best as he\ncould, slowly lifting him from the ground.\n\nMegatron then pointed to Prowl, &quot;Smelt him down.&quot; Megatron then aimed\nhis cannon at the Maximal leader, and fired a fusion blast.\n\nSpasstik picked different targets however. His duel laser cannons\ntargeting the running Groove. Both let out a laser beam towards the\nProtectobot. Then his rear anti neutrino grenade launchers aimed\nupwards, arcking off two grenades into the middle of the Protectobot\nformation, as the Decepticon wolf snarled with fury.\n\n"}}
