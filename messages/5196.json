Gangon started to cry, he was lonely and tied up. Sinesis and\nSinister decided that this battle wasn&#39;t worth it and headed to the top of a\nhill in the distance. They both say down, one on each side of Gangon. They\nslowly looked at Gangon. Sinister and Sinesis looked at each other. Gangon\ndidn&#39;t notice them until they were standing right in front of him, each one\nof them holding their special weapon. Gangon looked at them in terror.\nSinister stepped around behind Gangon. Sinesis did as well. they both pulled\nback their weapons.\n\n&quot;Wait! I was just waiting for my Girlfriend!&quot; Gangon said.\n\n&quot;Well when she dies you will be reunited!&quot; Sinesis screamed.\n\n&quot;Threats, always die.&quot; Sinister said.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not a threat! I&#39;m not any good!&quot; Gangon said.\n\n&quot;Then you need to die!&quot; Sinesis said. Gangon sighed, his plea for mercy\nbombing. Sinister and Sinesis, at the same time, plunged their swords right\nthrough the back of the chair and out the small bot Gangon&#39;s chest, the\nropes were cut. Sinister and Sinesis removed their swords, Gangon fell to\nthe ground, a puddle of mech fluid spilling around him. Gangon sighed.\nSinister and Sinesis climbed down the hill.\n\n&quot;Leave him to suffer!&quot; Sinesis said. Gangon gasped repeatedly, not able to\nbreath anymore. Gangon grabbed a large maple leaf, writing on it his love\nfor BrightBlade with his blood. Gangon sent it by scanning it, the message\nsent to BrightBlade. He sent anothe rone, saying to Hell Beast that he was\nsorry for failing him. Gangon collapsed, laying on the hill and slowly\ndying. Gangon rose long enough to grab his machine gun from cyberspace and\ncolapsed again. Gangon blinked a few times, his mech fluid getting into his\neyes, he just waited to die, waited to live, he didn&#39;t know what to do\nanymore. Sinesis and Sinister laughed and continued to walk on. Lightmare\nshowed up, a bit too late to help. Lightmare walked down and looked Sinesis\nand Sinister in the eyes.\n\n&quot;Hey, sorry I missed your slaughter, i wanted to help like I did in the last\n2 slaughters. Say, can I hang around you? I&#39;ll be your servant, I have\nnothing else to do.&quot; Lightmare said. Sinesis and Sinister looked at each\nother. They both grabbed Lightmare and forced her over to the tree.\nLightmare pulled her blaster out but Sinister slapped it away. Lightmare\nstruggled but it was no use. Sinister walked around to the back of the tree,\nSinesis staying in front.\n\n&quot;Nobody is around to help you now!&quot; Sinesis said. Lightmare groaned in pain\nas Sinesis punched her. Sinesis&#39; sword came out of the back of the tree,\nSinister&#39;s sword coming out of the front. Lightmare was pinned 2 ways.\nSinesis and Sinister laughed, removing their swords. They drug Lightmare to\nthe top of the hill and laid her next to Gangon.\n\n&quot;This will mean we have destroyed 3 threats!&quot; Sinister said. They both\nlaughed and walked away. Gangon and Lightmare caught a brief glimpse of each\nother, and then rolled over. Lightmare&#39;s mech fluid pouring out into the\npuddle of Gangon&#39;s, the whole hill was flooded and red...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;KSLawdogg@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 28, 2000 11:57 PM\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; Scattershot:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot got up slowly in immense pain, spotting the head of\nDeathStorm,\n&gt; picking it up and putting it on his head, he headed for the Alliance base.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Want insight into hot IPOs, investing strategies and stocks to watch?\n&gt; Red Herring FREE newsletters provide strategic analysis for investors.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5176/13/_/_/_/962251035/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
