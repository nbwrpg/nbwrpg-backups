I found them all, and all I remember after that is waking up \nto \n&gt; a horizontal light shining through the side of the storage bay. \n&gt; Looked like something burned a hole through the wall or something, \n&gt; but I can say that it was definately powerful.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With an exasperated look, &quot;So, I say whatever Perceptor we can do \n&gt; nothing right now, so nothing we will do... We&#39;re waiting for \n&gt; Megatron to come around.&quot; Switchblade smiles and empty smile to \n&gt; Preceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns back to Inferno, &quot;So he got damaged, who pulled that one \n&gt; off, there aren&#39;t many that can take him down easily.
