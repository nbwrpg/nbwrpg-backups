He yelled out in complete anger, \nstomping a foot.  &quot;RUINED!  GREAT!  SOMEONE NEEDS TO DIE!&quot;\n\nScattershot looked over his &quot;Soundwave/Stalker&quot; style armor, full of holes \nand gashes, mech-fluid sticking to his body.  &quot;Same here.  Luckily my helmet \nwasn&#39;t damaged!&quot; (I can&#39;t remember the guy&#39;s head that is his helmet!  I \ndon&#39;t believe it)\n\n&quot;Look over here, guys!&quot; Serpentor said, his plasma launcher pointed at a \nmetallic body.  The king cobra watched the other two Alliance members limp \nover Diskus, each standing a few feet away from him.\n\nNemesis Enforcer looked around, seeing flames in the trees, starting to take \nout what was left of the forest near the Alliance base.  Nemesis would have \nto have Pyro burn the rest down so no one could try and sneak up on the base. \n The autoguns were off, and Nemesis could smell the mech-fluid.\n\nLooking down on the unconscious Diskus, supposedly unconscious that is, \nNemesis Enforcer laughed, raising his weapon.  &quot;I didn&#39;t get to kill anyone.  \nThis idiot will have to do.&quot; the Alliance member chuckled madly as he pulled \nthe trigger to his rapid-firing laser rifle, twenty-five rapid bolts of red \nlaser fire heading down at Diskus&#39; torso.\n\n&quot;Wait, Nemesis!&quot; Serpentor yelled.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we take him prisoner for \ninterrogation?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, as second in command for the Alliance, I&#39;d say yes.  But as a \npsychotic Predacon, I&#39;d say waste him!&quot; Nemesis yelled, throwing his head \nback in evil laughter.\n\nSerpentor laughed, firing off a blast from his plasma launcher at Diskus.\n\nScattershot kept quiet, firing off twenty five shells down at Diskus.\n\n"}}
