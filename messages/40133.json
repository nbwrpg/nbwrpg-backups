He waits for \nDead-End and Drag Strip\n\nDead-End and Drag Strip come out of the cloud cover, and streak \ndown to land. Drag Strip lands and looks at the assembled \nDecepticons, &quot;Arrright! So where&#39;s this spaceship we needa move? \nI wanna move it now, and get the slag out of here! Wildrider, after \nthis, we can go scare the crap out of animals in the forest.&quot; He \nmakes gear shifting noises and motions as he pretends to run \ndown a deer. Stopping, he rubs his hands in anticipation. Dead-\nEnd sighs and mutters, &quot;One of these days, the animals are going \nto cause him to get wasted... Heh.&quot; Both wait for the other \nTerrorcons to arrive.\n\nRippersnapper doesn&#39;t dissapoint the Stunticons, &quot;What \nRippersnapper supposed do?&quot; He queries Astroblast.\n\nAstroblast, noting that all of the group have arrived, gives \nRippersnapper a brief summary, not wanting to confuse the mostly \nstupid bot, &quot;We will move a ship.&quot; He walks away from the bot, \nignoring any further questions. &quot;Motormaster,&quot; He says as he \napproaches, &quot;Have all of the Terrorcons arrived?&quot; He scans the \nbots present, and notices all of the Stunticons, though the \nTerrorcons seem to be lacking a member or two.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade has been in his makeshift lab for a while, cleaning up \nseveral projects. He just finished making three Nightstrike missiles \nfor one of his cohorts. &quot;There,&quot; He says to himself, now to findout if \nMegatron has anything else for me to do...&quot; He opens a commlink \nto Megatron, &quot;Megs what&#39;s going on up there? You got something \nfor me to do &#39;cause I&#39;m gettin bored here.&quot; He sends a quick \nmessage to Nightstrike, &quot;Nightstrike, your missiles are ready. Pick \nthem up whenever.&quot; Switchblade grabs his laser welders, puts \nthem away, and starts walking up through the twisting dark \nhallways of the cruiser called the Dark Avian.\n\nOn 17 Jul 2001, at 18:26, robertdahl wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Okay guys, from now on Speedbreaker is Breakdown, (thanks\n&gt; KSLAWDOGG\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sinnertwin finally parted through some clouds, his arms totally\n&gt; outstreched, he looked down and could see three Decepticons, as he\n&gt; flew towards them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster turned towards Cyclonus. &quot;Well, aparently we need Stratus\n&gt; and Astrotrain.
