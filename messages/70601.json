He draws up one of the missile barrels from his cab, and attatches it to his left arm. He saves the second for later, just in case it was needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Time for a little pest control, Prime style. All right Vestige, ready when you are, let&#39;s put these bugs in their place and get Rodimus back.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nVestige smiled again as he turned back to the insects in front of him,\nlaying down a tremendous amount of firepower!\n\nSeveral of Vestige&#39;s attacks strike home, tagging the approaching\ncreatures on thier back and head. However these creatures seemed to be\nbuilt amost like tanks! Although there were a few burnt and blackened\nareas on thier armored forms they still rushed foward to attack,\ncannons on thier backs orienting on Vestige and Tuscon and firing in\nreturn!\n\nMeanwhile from behind the buzzing sound was getting closer, and the\nroom began to rumble a little more violently. The figure on the bed\nbounced around, but otherwise did not move. The larger female that had\nbeen knocked out earlier seemed to have regained consciousness and\nwith the grinding of gears she too shifted form and rushed in to\nattack!\n\n(TAG)\n\n(OOC: I am unsure if Tuscon was firing yet or not. But if so, than the\nattacks are about as effective as Vestige&#39;s)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
