The liquid crystal display shows an increasing reactivity \nof the bot contained, which quickly levels off as it approaches a \nnormal bot&#39;s functioning range.\n\nThe chamber slides upward with an initially intense hiss, which \ngradually tapers off into an abrupt click as the chamber finishes \nrising from over top of the bot which it had been covering. \n\n&lt;Awake...&gt; thoughts trickle through the newly awakened bot&#39;s logic \ncenters as its sensors begin to take in the surroundings. The bot&#39;s \ngreyish visor turns slightly. The inpenitrable darkness is quickly \nwashed away into a view of green and black which, the bot decides, \ncould only mean night vision of sorts. The bot&#39;s vision was then \ninterupted as the visor&#39;s green-black sight became bluish with \nreddish shapes around what must be heat sources.\n\n&lt;It has been a while.&gt; If thoughts could have temperature, these \nones could have caused in ice age. &lt;This form... ahh yes, it is all \ncoming back to me.&gt; Images of a lith black form weilding black and \nsilver slienced pistols dodge weapon fire, and place three well \naimed armour piercing bullets into a bot of unknown origin&#39;s optics \nand central cicuitry flash through her logic center as it acesses \nthe bot&#39;s history.\n\nAll the history files ended with one word.\n\n&lt;...Noir...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
