She was\nfeeling better now, knowing that he seemed to be free of some terrible\nweight that was on his shoulders.  She turned to speak to him. Her\nlips started to open, then she shut them and faced forward. After a\nbit, keeping her face still forward, &quot;Where are we headed?&quot;  SInce she\nwasn&#39;t given coordinants, she felt a little unsettled.  She had always\nbeen one to take charge, now she felt uneasy knowing she would have to\ntrust him fully on completing their mission. Yet, strangely, the\nunsettled feeling wasn&#39;t fear, just a new feeling she wasn&#39;t yet used\nto. However, she felt it wouldn&#39;t take long to like it. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:  \n&gt;  \n&gt; He walked toward the coordinates given to him by Rodimus, quiet for\na bit, sorting his thoughts.  On one hand he had deeply hurt himself\nand Blacknightmare, but on the other he could live freely with his\nfirst true love, Wolfblade.  After a while he smiled, and paused in\nhis stride.  he held out his hand to Wolfblade, a smile so true and\nreflecting how he felt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Free, his spark no longer under the burden it was, free to love\nWolfblade and keep his promise to Blacknightmare and Hellplague.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
