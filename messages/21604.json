He could feel the emotions coming from her, \nconfusion, surprise, among many others, right before he heard her \nvoice.\n\nProwl opens his mouth to reply, the whole situation suddenly very \nclear to him. He had killed them, there was no denying that. His \nthoughts had caused the explosion, his mind was the mind that had \nkilled the femm he loved, along with himself. For a second, Prowl \nlooks blankly at Iron Raptor, but then his head lowers as he feels a \nsharp decrease of trust from her.\n\nShe didn&#39;t trust him, that was what was going through his mind, but \nshe had ever right not to. She had put herself in his arms through \nthe merge, and he only accomplished getting her killed, all because \nof one stupid conversation, which led to one stupid thought.\n\nFor a second he wondered if he could close his mind to her, hide the \ndespair he felt at her feelings, but he knew that he couldn&#39;t. This \nwas what the Matrix had meant of sharing himself with her, hearing \nher thoughts and feeling her feelings. But the Matrix, the Matrix had \ntold him it was not his fault. But it was, he knew that now. If he \nwasn&#39;t the one with Iron Raptor through this, perhaps she would have \ncome out much easier.\n\nHe sighs, stepping back from Iron Raptor. There were no exuses, he \nhad failed her, and he could feel the consequences in her very \nthoughts. Perhaps someone else would have done better, someone better \nsuited, like Dinobot.. The same feeling of jealousy flares up inside \nProwl, the Maximal paying no attention to it. Thet thought had done \nall the damage it could.\n\nProwl was beginning to wish he had never heard that exchange between \nIris and Iron Raptor. If it only wasn&#39;t for that talk.. No, it was \nhis fault, and his alone, and he would have to live with it, live \nwith the knowledge that through his stupid mistake, through an \ninsignificant thought of jealousy, he had killed the femm he loved.\n\nProwl looks over Iron Raptor like it was the last time he would see \nher. He couldn&#39;t feel anything from her now. No love, no hatred, \nnothing, but he was too mixed up in his own emotions: despair, anger \nat himself, sadness, and falure. Yes, he was a falure. He had been \ngiven a chance with the greatest and most beautiful girl in the \nworld, and he blew it, literaly.\n\nThe Maximal turns his head away from Iron Raptor, sighing.\n\n&quot;Yea, I guess I did,&quot; he mutters, his eyes locking on a flower \ngrowing out of the ground. It was a prehistoric species, white \nleaves, blue center. White hair and blue skin....\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked at her new blue legs as Prowl chuckled at her, \nfinding \n&gt; it a bit funny herself. Her laughter rising with his for a moment, \nsmiling \n&gt; as she reaches up her hand to take his. But she saw the blush in \nhis cheeks, \n&gt; chuckling.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I would say so.&quot; * But even those words didn&#39;t pay the fact no \ncredit, \n&gt; Prowl had done something remarkable for her that she doubted could \nhappen \n&gt; just often. And she was very proud and very thankful for him.\n&gt; But Iron Raptor simply smiled as Prowl leaned down to kiss her, \nthough \n&gt; seeing him stop when she asked him her question. Suddenly blinking \na few \n&gt; times as thoughts, not her own, come into her mind.\n&gt; Prowl...had been jelouse...and then a setting in the spark had gone \n&gt; wrong...and then the sparks had detonated.\n&gt; Iron Raptors eyes snapping up to Prowl, not exactly knowing what to \nthink \n&gt; but just nodded at his words.\n&gt; \n&gt; She then pulled herself up, wabbly on her legs and bracing herself \nwith her \n&gt; arms against Prowls chest. Still not quite believing just what she \nhad seen, \n&gt; looking at Prowl. Her voice was soft, but a little hurt.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You killed us....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * In her mind, the trust that she had felt as the merge began was \ngone, she \n&gt; perhaps trusted him now, but doubted the trust that she had felt \nfor him \n&gt; before.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
