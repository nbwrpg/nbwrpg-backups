Also, this was \na space station, and at this time of the night, lights were usually \nnot all bright and sparkle. The other reason was because the commander \nof the base considered it shook claustrophobia out of his troops.\n\nThe commander was a huge robot. He was the leader of the Quasacons, a \nhighly recognized Sadisticon unit in the Predacon ranks. He held them \nwith an iron grip and would never accept their disobeyance. However, \nhe left them sufficient space to give their ideas and express \nthemselves. He was a tough commander, not a tyrant.\n\nWarhead: All Quasacons meet up on the bridge. We have received orders \nand we all get ready now!\n\nHis voice had boomed loud in the speaker all over the base. That \nshould wake them up!\n\n\n"}}
