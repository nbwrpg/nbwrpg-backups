She heard what Stingra said to \nQuicktrike.  Shge felt sorry for him.  She turned her head to look at \nScorponok.  She liked him.  She wanted him to bfe happy with her.  She \nlooked back at Quickstrike.  She wanted to comfort him but felt like it was \nnot her place to interfere with his relationships.  She just lowered her \nhead and worked on the console.\n\nShe looked at Quickstrike and said in a low voice.\n&quot;Is everything alright commander? Is there anything I can do for you?&quot;\nShe wanted to make him happy.  Blast her programming, not only did she have \nto obey, but she liked both of them.  She felt benieth both of her \ncommanders and not worthy of either, but wanted to please both.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
