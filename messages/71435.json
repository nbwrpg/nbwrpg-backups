They&#39;re the most proactive of the trio.=\r\n  No offense ta Rodimus of course but, I think his experience with Hydras d=\r\nid a real number on him.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of emotional scarring the=\r\nre.  I really hate Hydras for what he did also but, I look at the bright si=\r\nde too, and yeah that&#39;s out there, just onna take some time ta reach it, bu=\r\nt the way I see it, there&#39;s a powerful air of determination on the part of =\r\nall the commanders and with that, we might all get what we wish for.&quot;\n\nHe t=\r\nhen sits up on his rump and looks to Windlord.\n\n&quot; Tucson Prime took one hec=\r\nk of a risk ta get us this far.  He almost lost his own spark ta pull Rodim=\r\nus away from Hydras.  And after ya left the meeting, he pledged ta face Hyd=\r\nras again in another one on one battle.  History could repeat itself becaus=\r\ne it&#39;s the same exact pledge that Optimus Prime made vorns ago when he face=\r\nd Megatron on countless one on one battles.  I read up on this in my spare =\r\ntime.  Anyway, getting back to the story, I did a little more research on T=\r\nucson.  Apparently his specs were based off of Optimus and Ultra Magnus&#39;s s=\r\npecifications, only in a smaller vehicular design at the time.  And before =\r\nhe lost his sight, he was one spry little warrior.  Nothing was impossible =\r\nto him but that did cost him though, a lot of time in the med bay, getting =\r\nbattle dents ironed out.  But no matter the cost to his structural well bei=\r\nng, Tucson never refused the opportunity to fight for the loyalty of his fa=\r\nction which in the long run, lead to the incident where he unexpectedly got=\r\n blasted off line only ta come around a lot later, finding that he had lost=\r\n his sight capabilities due to extensive damage to his optic sensors.&quot;\n\nHe =\r\nthen gets back on his hooves.\n\n&quot; losing his sight actually didn&#39;t bother hi=\r\nm though.  In fact he adapted rather quickly to his disability which now se=\r\nems the norm for him.  And there is talk of him finally getting his optics =\r\nrepaired.  But there&#39;s one tiny formality...  Before Ratchet went off line,=\r\n the Autobot&#39;s Chief Medical Officer, he specifically said and documented t=\r\nhat the complex repair be either left up to him or under his strict supervi=\r\nsion.  I guess he had a real close bond with Tucson back then.  Well that&#39;s=\r\n all I know for now.  We better get back before someone wonders where we we=\r\nnt.&quot;\n\nHe offers his back to his friend and waits for Windlord to mount up.\n=\r\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Jul 9, 2011, at 3:59 AM,=\r\n Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Windlord:\n&gt;  \n&gt; wind=\r\nlord sighed and said =E2=80=9Cbut is something that must be done to protect=\r\n it=E2=80=9D\n&gt;  \n&gt; From: Sandy Panico\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 08, 2011 6:29 AM=\r\n\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Changing times (Cue: All Maxim=\r\nals & Autobots)\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Instinct suddenly floods Tucson&#39;s logic circuit=\r\ns as Talon&#39;s kiss excites his inner spark.

Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I appreciate your =\r\nposting, but it&#39;s sort of weird how you have each and every character of yo=\r\nur&#39;s coming up, then doing something to me, then knowing each and every thi=\r\nng that happened to each adn every other one that did, and them all having =\r\nthe exact same opinions        over on everyone as everyone else did. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, unless your characte ris asuperior officer who&#39;s going to emph=\r\natically order him to do something, please don&#39;t pose him going somewhere f=\r\nar else after you for a setup. Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to =\r\ngo back to Tuscon&#39;s quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when he&#39;s =\r\nnot especially fond of Tuscon, nor him following someone else as well when =\r\nI posd him trying to leave. So, if going to go somewhere with him, please g=\r\nive me a cahnce to respond to it ahead of time. It&#39;s two times you posed hi=\r\nm extensively going with your characters when it was not in character for h=\r\nim to do so.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If your characters have had interactions with him i=\r\nn the past or things I should know of, let me know? As I have no idea where=\r\n Wheelie interacted with Tuscon or how they would have remotely konwn of on=\r\ne another, and you&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the past=\r\n, when I have no idea of that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So again, if they&#39;ve had interact=\r\nions as NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic history so I can respond appropria=\r\ntely. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere wtih someone, either give me=\r\n a chance to respond appropriately if he does or not, or make it something =\r\nlike a specific order in the case someone is a superior. And it&#39;s also rath=\r\ner weird how your characers come up from nowhere, all have the exact same o=\r\npininos and back one another up to the hilt on thier interactions and every=\r\nthing. I feel kind of wedged into a corner by this.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand=\r\n I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been here much longer, I just feel rather =\r\nhemmed in on the character with what you&#39;re doing and am confused as to how=\r\n things operate, and how you have all of your alts congregating and making =\r\nme feel pressed into a corner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyways, sorry if this is coming =\r\nfof a bit too negative, thank you very much for the welcome here and for pl=\r\naying wtih me and interacting with Wheelie.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;Back In Character&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wheelie, having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at him, &quot;W=\r\nhat is this with all of you?

Tucson Prime took one heck of a risk=\r\n ta get us this far. &nbsp;He almost lost his own spark ta pull Rodimus awa=\r\ny from Hydras. &nbsp;And after ya left the meeting, he pledged ta face Hydr=\r\nas again in another one on one battle. &nbsp;History could repeat itself be=\r\ncause it&#39;s the same exact pledge that Optimus Prime made vorns ago when he =\r\nfaced Megatron on countless one on one battles. &nbsp;I read up on this in =\r\nmy spare time. &nbsp;Anyway, getting back to the story, I did a little more=\r\n research on Tucson. &nbsp;Apparently his specs were based off of Optimus a=\r\nnd Ultra Magnus&#39;s specifications, only in a smaller vehicular design at the=\r\n time. &nbsp;And before he lost his sight, he was one spry little warrior. =\r\n&nbsp;Nothing was impossible to him but that did cost him though, a lot of =\r\ntime in the med bay, getting battle dents ironed out. &nbsp;But no matter t=\r\nhe cost to his structural well being, Tucson never refused the opportunity =\r\nto fight for the loyalty of his faction which in the long run, lead to the =\r\nincident where he unexpectedly got blasted off line only ta come around a l=\r\not later, finding that he had lost his sight capabilities due to extensive =\r\ndamage to his optic sensors.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He then gets back on=\r\n his hooves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; losing his sight actually didn&#39;t bo=\r\nther him though. &nbsp;In fact he adapted rather quickly to his disability =\r\nwhich now seems the norm for him. &nbsp;And there is talk of him finally ge=\r\ntting his optics repaired. &nbsp;But there&#39;s one tiny formality... &nbsp;Be=\r\nfore Ratchet went off line, the Autobot&#39;s Chief Medical Officer, he specifi=\r\ncally said and documented that the complex repair be either left up to him =\r\nor under his strict supervision. &nbsp;I guess he had a real close bond wit=\r\nh Tucson back then. &nbsp;Well that&#39;s all I know for now. &nbsp;We better g=\r\net back before someone wonders where we went.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He =\r\noffers his back to his friend and waits for Windlord to mount up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Ju=\r\nl 9, 2011, at 3:59 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@=\r\nhotmail.com&quot;&gt;airly2002@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;

Since it&#39;s hideously unrealistic for him to g=\r\no back to Tuscon&#39;s \n      quarters twice now as you&#39;ve posed him doing when=\r\n he&#39;s not especially fond \n      of Tuscon, nor him following someone else =\r\nas well when I posd him trying \n      to leave. So, if going to go somewher=\r\ne with him, please give me a cahnce \n      to respond to it ahead of time. =\r\nIt&#39;s two times you posed him extensively \n      going with your characters =\r\nwhen it was not in character for him to do \n      so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your charac=\r\nters have had interactions with him in the past \n      or things I should k=\r\nnow of, let me know? As I have no idea where Wheelie \n      interacted with=\r\n Tuscon or how they would have remotely konwn of one \n      another, and yo=\r\nu&#39;ve posted repeaetdly that Tuscon knows him from the past, \n      when I h=\r\nave no idea of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, if they&#39;ve had interactions \n      as=\r\n NPC&#39;s, let me know their generic history so I can respond \n      appropria=\r\ntely. If he&#39;s going to be told to go somewhere wtih someone, \n      either =\r\ngive me a chance to respond appropriately if he does or not, or \n      make=\r\n it something like a specific order in the case someone is a superior. \n   =\r\n   And it&#39;s also rather weird how your characers come up from nowhere, all =\r\n\n      have the exact same opininos and back one another up to the hilt on =\r\nthier \n      interactions and everything. I feel kind of wedged into a corn=\r\ner by \n      this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand I&#39;m new to the gruop and you&#39;ve been=\r\n here much \n      longer, I just feel rather hemmed in on the character wit=\r\nh what you&#39;re \n      doing and am confused as to how things operate, and ho=\r\nw you have all of \n      your alts congregating and making me feel pressed =\r\ninto a \n      corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, sorry if this is coming fof a bit too=\r\n negative, \n      thank you very much for the welcome here and for playing =\r\nwtih me and \n      interacting with Wheelie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;Back In Character&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelie, \n      having met Tuscon up in the hall, gazes over at h=\r\nim, &quot;What is this with \n      all of you? You&#39;re back and forth whatever I =\r\ndo. This is what Prime is, \n      just a rank? It seems like it&#39;s just sort=\r\n of dank. We had four of five in \n      a room, that&#39;s not a level of doom =\r\nand gloom.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, walking away \n      from Tuscon, but looking behin=\r\nd, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with all of your \n      friends, congrualtions on =\r\nthe promotion and to whatever ends. But we, we \n      were never friends. W=\r\ne went back and forth in our ways, and I respect your \n      orders for the=\r\nse days. But we&#39;re not here to have fun, we&#39;re here to fight \n      and run=\r\n and gun.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelie leaning against the wall, &quot;I&#39;ll work wtih \n      =\r\nyou, if you do tell, but I&#39;m a soldier, and war is hell. I&#39;d prefer to \n   =\r\n   keep my own advice, and I appreciate your friends, they try and be nice.=\r\n \n      But don&#39;t have them ganging up on me and telling me what to do, or =\r\nhow \n      you&#39;ll react, or on you&#39;ll I chew. So by al lmeans, give me some=\r\n space, \n      we&#39;re here to fight for the future of our race.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR: =\r\nwhite;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR: white;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\nCOLOR: white;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n   =\r\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-26--944565964--\r\n\n"}}
