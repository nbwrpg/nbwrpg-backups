She let \ngo of the ceiling, stretched out her wings and floated to the floor. \nShe walked out of the cave and looked around. In the canyon, her \nvoice echoed,&quot;Look...uh..if you want to talk?&quot; she paused, thinking \nif this was the right thing to do.&quot;I&#39;ll talk if you want.&quot;\nShe stood there, at the cave enterence, her wings folded around her \nlike a cape, waiting for a responce.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; (Sorry LSK, but I was only using the Qwest Internet things as a one \n&gt; time thing, because of the problems Yanshosh has had. And I&#39;m sure \n&gt; that those bots in the BW have heard of an IBM Computer, because \nall \n&gt; the autobots and decepticons were all fluent in human technology, \nand \n&gt; I&#39;m sure that that knowledge was past on through the upgrade. And \n&gt; about your thing with Nemesis Inforcer, there&#39;s a problem. Because \n&gt; the Matrix is telling you to stop peace, but the Matrix was telling \n&gt; me and is telling child to make peace.

Come on, Drillbit, let&#39;s find that \nlittle \n&gt; piece of explosive diareha waiting to happen.(Get it? Because fire \n&gt; comes out of his ass!

He sighs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right, I&#39;ll leave. It&#39;s just that this image I saw really \n&gt; disturbed me. And if I have more, I&#39;m going to go back to you. I&#39;m \n&gt; sorry for the way I treated you. If we were friends before, I would \n&gt; like you to focus on that, and forgive me.&quot; Vulois flew out of the \n&gt; cave. Something inside him was burning up. Something was fighting. \nHe \n&gt; flew and found a tree branch, wanting to think.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotron arrived where Zardus was, and asked him:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, what did you call me for? I was in the process of spying on \n&gt; KitKat!&quot; This wasn&#39;t true, but he wanted to look good infront of \n&gt; Zardus, his idle.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Prebon\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon sat there, with the canister containing Lightrade in his \narms, \n&gt; and thought. This was the first big loss he ever had. He was \ndealing \n&gt; with the big guys now. He felt as disguraged as the time his father \n&gt; was incredibly mad at him for attacking the Maximal complex with \n&gt; Lightrade.(Refered to in the first chapter of Prebon&#39;s fanfic, \nwhich \n&gt; I am in the process of writing.) But he wasn&#39;t out yet. He still \nhad \n&gt; Slayer. And Spears&#39; programming would be fighting till the bitter \n&gt; end. And that Koj must be going nuts with the pain. Infact, this \n&gt; wasn&#39;t really a loss at all. If anything the Maximals are weaker \nand \n&gt; ready for a finished off attack. Maybe he would attack again soon, \n&gt; but not to finish them off. He needed a device to destory those \nanti-\n&gt; chips they had in their brains, and that would take time. And in \nthat \n&gt; time they would repair. But he will win this in the long run. What \nhe \n&gt; needed was an partnership. A back-up. Some group who enjoyed \nviolence \n&gt; as much as his did. He got up and immediatly went searching the \n&gt; database for his reasearch he made before he got here.\n\n\n"}}
