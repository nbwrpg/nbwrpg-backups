Or at least before Oblitertron decided that they were better \ntargets then they seemed.\nHe then snapped his optics towards the huge bot once again, his teeth bared \nand his entire body tense.\nBut there was something wrong, something very wrong! He was feeling light \nheaded and the ground beneath was covered in mech-fluid, and no matter when \nhe did the floe of fluid from his chest would not cease�his spark beating \ntoo fast.\nBut, no matter how injured he was he wasn�t about to fail in his mission, to \nget Tavatron back to the CF�in one piece.\nBut then, all of a sudden he saw the huge bots optic lasers charge, aiming \nright for Prowl.\nHe knew that his optic laser was failing along with its� sight, knowing that \nhe couldn�t possibly hope to shoot that far.\nDinobot watched for one simple second, his mind reeling at what he saw.\nProwl had helped him get Tavatron back from the Alliance, and it was his \nidea that had gotten them into their base and to the chamber where she had \nbeen held. And for that, he owed him and was in his debt, because he had \nhelped bring Tavatron to safety�for a time.\nAnd he was not a bot to leave his debts unpaid.\nWith more effort then it could have ever seemed, he was there. Right in \nfront of Prowl�swinging his clawed hand against the Maximals shoulder-plate \nas hard as he could.*\n\n�Fool! Move!!�\n\n* He roared. Yet, just as his claws would have slammed against Prowl, the \noptic lasers from the giant robot slammed into his side with a force which \nsent both silver armor and fluid spraying into the air and showering each \nwith at least two gallons of mech-fluid.\nNot a sound uttered from the warriors throat, his debt repaid. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
