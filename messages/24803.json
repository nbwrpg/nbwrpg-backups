As he did he remembered that fateful day \nhere. He had been defeated by the bot. The one who killed him he had not yet \ndetected but that was another matter. After the decapataiona large ship had \nentered the earth&#39;s orbit undetected. Whe no one was left they took the \npieces of Megastrom and rebuilt him. They didnt tell him who they where and \nwhat they wanted. All he knew was when he woke up he was back on cybertron \nand awaied the return of his brother. He didnt know how he knew it was \ncomeing but iut was. When he detected him he immediatly went off towrds \nearth. He then landed here..\n\n"}}
