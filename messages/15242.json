Another of us left! That makes four. Who do we have left? Me,\n&gt; you Drillbit, Phobia, Goldeneye, Dollen and a near death KitKat. All\n&gt; that remains of Megatron&#39;s vicious army. And where is our great\n&gt; leader? HE SHOULD BE HERE!! HE&#39;S IN CHARGE!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream walked off and sat on a rock, obviously upset. He looks up\n&gt; at the rest.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;5 of us....not including KitKat. My vote for Phoiba still stands.\n&gt; Our great leader flees, our second in command his near death, and her\n&gt; replacement doesn&#39;t want the job. We have to pick between ourselves.\n&gt; First to receive 3 votes wins. No voting for yourself. In the event\n&gt; of a tie we all vote again but only for the people who tied. What do\n&gt; you say?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
