She had \nnever been very fond of flying, but could tolerate it to a certain extent. \nShe kept her gaze focused on the dragon&#39;s massive head, and did her best NOT \nto look down. The wind whipped past her, pushing back her fur and loosening \nvarious flora that had been embedded in her fur. If anything this flight \nwould make brushing her fur easier.\n\nWith a heavy sigh Tavatron crossed her arms and rested them atop \nNecromancer&#39;s back. Her head was slightly raised, but eventually that too \nwas resting atop the massive dragon. Despite her earlier nap she was still \ntired. Her shoulder throbbed occasionally, but otherwise was fine. Thinking \nof her own injuries made her wonder how Dinobot was doing. She was still \nupset at him, but not nearly as angry as she was before. His words still \nechoed in her mind, but instead of immediatly returning his verbal attack \nwith one of her own she had decided to think it over first. She still \ncouldn&#39;t figure out WHY he was so upset. Sure, she was missing her shoulder \nplate, big deal. She had been in worse condition and lived:\n\n&quot;Dinobot, can I ask you something?&quot;\n\nHer tone was normal, and rather hard to understand considering she still had \nher optics closed and had proceeded to cover them with her arms. It just \nmade the flight easier. Once she was on the ground she would be alright. \nUntil then she wasn&#39;t budging an inch:\n\n&quot;Why do you care whether or not I&#39;m scrapped? What difference does it make? \nI&#39;m no one important, just another soldier in another pointless war.&quot;\n\nWhether he chose to ignore her or continue yelling at her was up to him. \nRight now her only real concern was getting back on the ground. For some \nreason the thought of Dinobot not making it back to base in time never \ncrossed her mind. She just assumed, as always, that he would be alright. The \nthought of him NOT being alright was something she wasn&#39;t even willing to \nconsider. Despite their current argument Tavatron still considered him a \nfriend. Unfortunetly, a friendship could only take a certain amount of \nstrain before it snapped.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
