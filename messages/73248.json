BUt interruptions, as they may, the blasting mountain went\n&gt; on fire that day!\n&gt;\n&gt; WHEELIE went to turn around, and glance over at the burning, flaming ground.\n&gt;  At this point, he could only look about, glancing around and wondering\n&gt; without.  And so they could just sit and stare, wondering what was happening\n&gt; over there!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs they watched, clouds of ash and soot spread out from the newly\nerrupting Volcano sending out a large black cloud over the surrounding\narea, one that was stlowly stretching its way as far out as to where\nWHEELIE, the DINOBOTS and the TERRORCONS were.\n\nLightning and fire could be seen in the distance flashing and\nerrupting and great booming sounds of thunder.\n\nHUN-GRR looked back at WHEELIE, BACKSTOP and the DINOBOTS and then at\nhis men, &quot;Bah, this is pointless let&#39;s go.&quot; he said to the TERRORCONS.\n&quot;We have better things to do than to sit here here with these mechs.&quot;\n\n&quot;Like rip&#39;em apart!&quot; CUTHROAT said as the others chuckled.\n\nThere was a smile from HUN-GRR, &quot;Yes, but not right now. First we have\nour own matters to attend to.&quot; And of course part of that meant\neating, probrably one of HUN-GRR&#39;s favorite past times.\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; HUN-GRR said as he shifted to his beast mode, which resembled\na large multi-headed dragon!\n\nThe TERRORCONS began to run off there would be time enough for battles . . .\n\nBACKSTOP turned to look at them leaving, &quot;I suppose you will want to\nrejoin your Maximal allies now?&quot; he said quietly to WHEELIE.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
