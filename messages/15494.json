Though, that also meant that Prowl\nwould have to go now, when she actually wanted him around.\nIron Raptor sigh as she watched all three men run from the room and head\ntowards the CF exits, ready to save the two Maximals that she had been so\nworried about.\nAnd again, she was left alone. Looking at the door her lover had left by, to\ngo on a more important mission. Left alone with her thoughts, and an empty\nfeeling as well.\nThey were always too busy with something to be together anymore, Prowl and\nherself.And now he ran off to another battle, one that she had to face the\nfact that...he might not return from. And even the thought of it ciezed her\nspark, wishing lik never before that he would had tried to hug her...and she\nwould have let him.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
