Yet, as he studied this new bot he noticed that there seemed to be a very small amount of threat in the air about him, eyeing him again now but a bit more carefully then before.\nThere was no such a thing as trusting a strange bot and he wasn�t about to begin that trend, it was unwise and he had seen it lead to the deaths of more bots then he could count.\nDinobot remained the same distance from Hakibuscon as he had before, close enough to strike him down if he suddenly pulled a threatening move yet, far enough so that he could easily avoid any missile this enemy sent.\nIt seemed strange to him, how this bot had attacked them first yet had stopped as soon as he had approached him threateningly. Most enemies would have fired upon them already, not even giving him a chance to get this close. A foolish move but he had come to know that most bots WERE foolish enough to do so.\nYet, here this bot was, simply standing in front of him and staring at him like he hadn�t expected him to act so aggressively.\nDinobot snarled as he saw Hakibuscon open his mouth to speak, expecting some sort of challenge to emerge from his throat. A challenge he would accept without a second thought.\nYet, he was a bit surprised to hear such an innocent question emerge instead of the threat he was sure he would here.\nThough, the aggression did not ease from his features as he listened.\nThose simple questions could be a trick of some sort, distracting him while a larger force circled around behind them and took then by their blind side.\nHe scanned quickly, surveying the area for any possible clues of an advancing force. However, there was nothing. Not even the unmistakable signature of a cloaking device. Only them, all three of their signatures showing clearly upon his internal screen.\nHowever, there could be some other, undetectable device screening the signatures of an advancing horde, it was still wise to remain on alert just in case.\nDinobot growled deeply as Hakibuscon�s words ceased his muscles still tense and ready for the battle that just might not come�since the situation was beginning to power down.\nSo, this bot had been spying upon Predacons for the past few solar-cycles? Could it have been Tavatron and himself in which he had spied upon, or some other of the Predacon forces? \nIndeed, as much as he did not wish to think so, Dinobot WAS a Predacon. \nJust because one changed their faction did not mean that they could change the truth that existed within their DNA, and his clearly gave the truth that he was, indeed, a Predacon.\nA factor in which he would never be able to escape, as well as his past.\nDinobot glared at Hakibuscon for a moment, judging just how much this bot could possibly know of him.\nHowever, if he were to ask any questions then he would first have to answer those in which this bot had asked. A simple factor.\nDinobot narrowed his optics as he looked at Hakibuscon, not a drop of tension draining from his muscles. *\n\n�A TRUE warrior always gives his victims that chance to reconsider the situation in which they might get themselves into.�\n\n* It was the truth, a factor in which he had not learned as a Predacon, or a Maximal�but as an honorable individual.\nAs a Predacon he had learned that the main motto was to kick them while they were down, however, as a Maximal he had learned their motto of maintaining peace instead of engaging in battle. Both factors in which he could not live by, so he lived by the one in which made all the sense in the world: the Code of Honor.\nBut as much as he tried to maintain his own way of life, he sometimes lapsed into the Predacon way of living and seeing things as he had in his past. However, such times were rare now.\nDinobot growled at those past thoughts, tightening his hand into a fist�though, no claw entered him palm this time.\nHis DNA spelled out Predacon while his title spelled out Maximal. It was a difficult concept but there was no ruling out his past, he was, indeed, Predacon. It was his heritage as well as his birthright, a factor in which he could never escape. Though, he had never TRIED to escape it. Knowing that he was a Predacon, only on the Maximal side.\nFighting for their causes instead of for the Predacon�s insane causes of conquest! \nThough he had fought along side the Maximals, he had never been one of them. Nor would he ever be as long as his spark beat within his chest.\nDinobot had accepted his destiny long ago, and it was that of a Predacon which fought for the RIGHT causes. Even if that meant betraying his own kind for a better future for all, for both sides if they cared to open their optics and see it clearly.\nHe growled deeply at Hakibiscon�s words, seeming to brand him as a REAL Maximal. In which he was not.*\n\n� By title only.�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
