He \nknew getting mad at Stingtra for no reason wasn&#39;t going to help. He had to \nbe patient on a matter like this.\n\nHe paused and watched his scanners. He found Stingtra&#39;s signature and saw \nthat she was back at base. He felt like an idiot now, just trying to chase \nher tail. He growled at himself and made his way back.\n\nWhen he came back, he barely saw anyone, even when he said for no one to \nleave. Dark Mouse and Megatron wasn&#39;t here either. But he did see Stingtra \nhurting herself again. He ran over to her and knelt down. He blocked her \nhead before she hit it again over the wall of the cave.\n\n&quot;This is what ah&#39;m talkin&#39; about,&quot; he said, watching carefully with his \ntemper.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
