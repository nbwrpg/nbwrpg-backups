She was upset and sore. She didn&#39;t want to leave her forest, but she had to. If the two dinosaurs were Megatron&#39;s drones, then sooner or later, he would find out and come running to kill her. But she wasn&#39;t going to let that happen. \n&lt;P&gt;She snarled at the thoughts of him. Didn&#39;t he ever give up? Would he just leave her alone?\n&lt;P&gt;But Predacons never left traitors alone. They would be chased down until they were dead. \n&lt;P&gt;This was her second hide-out. Now she was going to go for her third. She thought this place would be safe. But no. Maybe she would be better off&nbsp; if she just left that other raptor alone. The problem was: she couldn&#39;t be safe if she knew it she was on Megatron side. They could ambush her with his fliers like before. \n&lt;P&gt;She didn&#39;t want to think about it, but there was no choice. She couldn&#39;t forget her past. It was apart of her, inbedded into her brain forever. Her confrontation with Dinobot, the beating she got from Megatron...her tretchery. It was who she was. \n&lt;P&gt;Cyber Claw paused. She looked left and right. Which way was she going to go? North? East? She snarled to herself. She could always activate her flight mode and try a way. \n&lt;P&gt;She shook her long head. Go North, she told herself. She had to try it. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotmail.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
