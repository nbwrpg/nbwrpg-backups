She went into a nose dive and pulled up at the last \nsecond, coasting only a few feet off the canyon floor. She swung and \nglided in and out of the rock structures. She skimmed her wings along \na small pond and the rose a few more feet.  She then made a sharp \nturn and quickly ducked into a cave.  She flew up into the ceiling of \nthe cave and hung, upside down on a stalagtite.  She wrapped her \nwings around her and hid in the dark of the cave.\n\n \n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Excellent insult, Minime!
