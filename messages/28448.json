Looking around the battle, Mantle saw the other Maximals \n&gt; fighting. From the look of their base, things weren&#39;t good. He looked down \n&gt; at his team, sending a message to their minds:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You guys go ahead, I&#39;ll battle from here.&quot; He looks up in time to see a big \n&gt; robot reaching for something that looked like a bunch of metal. His mind \n&gt; probed out, seeing that it was a robot. Mantle was a bit surprised at all \n&gt; the rage that he could feel around him, as well as the pain and suffering, \n&gt; but he was used to it by now. On his first several battles it surprised him, \n&gt; though, and made him a bit less good of a leader untill he got used to it. \n&gt; But he was used to it now, and no one was going to push the Maximals around \n&gt; while he was on this planet!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantle concentrated hard, making his mind reach out across the battlefield. \n&gt; He flexed his mind and Firearm&#39;s body rose from the shields, avoiding \n&gt; Menasor&#39;s grab. Mantle slowly lowered to the ground, his teeth clenched. One \n&gt; of the setbacks of his ability to use his mind to directly influence robots \n&gt; was that it created a temporary link between those robots and himself. In \n&gt; this case, Mantle could feel the pain that Firearm was feeling, and it was \n&gt; almost too much. But he held on, flipping Firearm through the air with his \n&gt; mind. Sweat poured down his forehead as he made Firearm&#39;s body quickly fly \n&gt; through the air toward the Element.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through nearly closed eyes, Mantle could see the rest of his team emerging \n&gt; from the shield, still firing. He saw that Cinder was looking through the \n&gt; battle, searching for the bot she had been worrying about as she fired more \n&gt; at Deamon Wulf. His eyes drifted to the rest of his family, seeing Rocky \n&gt; fire two more missiles at Dark Claw. Aqua nearly tripped over the uneven \n&gt; ground, causing one of his spears to dig into the earth, but the next three \n&gt; were aimed exactly at Flesh Ripper&#39;s head. Above him, Mist gained altitude, \n&gt; firing charges at Menasor&#39;s hand.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
