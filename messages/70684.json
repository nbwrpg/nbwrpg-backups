But I&#39;m =\r\nsure the others \n&gt; &gt; would be interested in hearing your story.  Why don&#39;t =\r\nyou tell them, and \n&gt; &gt; then catch up to us at a later time perhaps?  Right=\r\n now, I am tired, and I \n&gt; &gt; do need rest.  So does Rodimus.  You may use t=\r\nhe room where Optimus Prime \n&gt; &gt; rests, if you wish.  Just be sure to leave=\r\n things as they are.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He says with a gentile voice.  Before becommi=\r\nng a Prime, he had been known \n&gt; &gt; as gruff autobot, always willing to take=\r\n chances.  But now, his \n&gt; &gt; experiences begin to change him, not only on t=\r\nhe outside but on the inside \n&gt; &gt; as well.  He had learned a lot in his exp=\r\nerience while fighting beside \n&gt; &gt; Vestige in his subconcious state, and ho=\r\nw important team work was, and how \n&gt; &gt; valuable the help of others truely =\r\nis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Oh, before you go, Thank you, thank you for standing by us du=\r\nring our \n&gt; &gt; ordeal.

You&#39;re worth \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n more to me than any precious metal or power source. And, Torca&#39;s right, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; I - could use a rest, but, perhaps I will get that when I undergo the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; repairs to my optic sensors. Stanton, I need to ask you a favor. O=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that I know is extremely difficult to accomplish, and one that I=\r\n&#39;d \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never ask of you unless it was a dire need. I would like you to =\r\nattempt \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the delicate process of bringing my optic sensors back onli=\r\nne. If it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work, I understand.

A blind eye can only go so far. And =\r\nif at all possible, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could the same be done for Perceptor?
