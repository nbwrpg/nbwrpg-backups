She stepped out \nand stretched her arms.  She looked around.  She thought she hear a \nnoise like metal striking metal.  She walked down the hall and saw \nSpears walking towards her with an aggitated look on her face.\n&quot;Hey, You OK?&quot;\n\nSpears::\n&quot;No&quot; her voice sounding short and loud.\n\nShadow Wing::\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;\n\nSpears::\n&quot;Nothing.&quot; as she blew past Shadow Wing and went to her quarters.  \nShe slammed the door to her room.\n\nShadow Wing::\nShe watch the door slam shut and stood for a moment. &quot;I wonder what&#39;s \ngot her all riled up?&quot;\nShe walked down the hallway and saw the spear sticking out of the \nwall. She looked at it wided eyed for a few seconds. She wondered \nwhat happened to make Spears so upset.  \nShe went towards the entrance and saw the group standing outside. The \nPreds had left as far as she could tell.  She went down the ramp and \nover to Lunarpine.  She walked up to him and smiled at him. &quot;Hello. \nWhat&#39;s going on?&quot; she had a warm smile and her voice was light and \npleasant. &quot;What happened? They just up and left huh?&quot; She looked \naround. &quot;What? You didn&#39;t kill that aweful tiger who tried to eat me? \nShucks, I was hoping to have him as a throw rug in my quarters too.&quot; \nShe gave a slight pout and then smiled. \n\n\n\n"}}
