Beast Wars is an American/Canadian creation, \nfrom \n&gt; Mainframe Entertainment. Same thing goes for Beast Machines.  Your \ncousins \n&gt; boyfriend probably mistook Silverbolt for someone else since he has \nnever \n&gt; been in command.  Robots in Disguise originated in Japan, being the \nonly \n&gt; Japanese Transformers series so far to come to our shores. Gobots is \n&gt; COMPLETELY UNRELATED to Transformers.  It was a rival show and \ntoyline in the \n&gt; 80s, but Transformers was infinitely more popular(and better).\n\n\n"}}
