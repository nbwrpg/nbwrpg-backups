She looked around as her vision \nstarted clear up. She looked at Veratis. She stood there, with a full \npolarbear body, large white wings growing out of her shoulders.  She \ntried to get her diognasotic systems to work, and she couldn&#39;t find \nmost of her old computer systems.  &quot;What happened?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Veratis scanned Shadow Wings new form, her spark seemed in control \n&gt; regaurdless of what her form appeared to be. &quot;I&#39;ll let you out now, \n&gt; just be ready for some disorientation. your form might not be \n&gt; adjusted yet.&quot; the door to the CR chamber slid open to reveal an \n&gt; extremely large female polar bear. Veratis looked on startled, it \nwas \n&gt; no wonder she fealt cramped, instead of the proportions of a \n&gt; halfbreed polar bear/ owl, she was now the size of a full grown \npolar \n&gt; bear. &quot;My dear, I don&#39;t think Shadow Wing is appropriate anymore.&quot; \n&gt; His mind went blank, he didn&#39;t know what to make of her new form \nall \n&gt; he could see is what could now be possible.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
