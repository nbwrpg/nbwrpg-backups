Ghost Bear warrior Ragnar will fight for the proposal, and \nWolf warrio=\r\nr Vladimir Ward will fight against it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Seyla&quot; Vlad whispered the word, k=\r\nnowing that both his opponent and \nthe Loremaster and pronounced it too.\n\nR=\r\nagnar. He had thought the freebirth to be stuck in the Inner Sphere \nwith t=\r\nhe Warden Clan Wolf in exile, but the Ghost Bear had taken him \nas a bondsm=\r\nan and made him a Star Colonel in their Alpha Galaxy. He \nhad been the prot=\r\n=E9g=E9 of his nemesis, Phelan Kell, the much hated \nfreeborn Khan of those=\r\n renegade Wolves, which made Vlad even more \neager to slay him...\n\nKatya Ke=\r\nrensky of Clan Wolf rode in her new Solitaire battlemech. She \nhad been sel=\r\nected to be the loremaster for this trial and had chosen \nto test the new l=\r\night mech. Though it was a complete change from her \nTimber Wolf omnimech (=\r\nthe same her Khan had in this battle) she was \nused to, both because of its=\r\n 50 tons less, its reduced armament and \nits awesome speed, she liked the m=\r\nech so far.\nShe evaluated the warriors. Vlad had a powerful Timber Wolf. If=\r\n any \nmech could match speed, armor and firepower, this one could. Bristlin=\r\ng \nwith two box of missiles on each shoulder and lasers on each arm,the \nbi=\r\nrdlike mech was a threat. Still, Ragnar was better armed. He manned \na Dire=\r\n Wolf, a heavier version of the Timber Wolf, and probably the \nmost feared =\r\nmachine in known space. At 100 tons, the juggernaut was \narmed to the teeth=\r\n, with a gauss rifle, a heavy autocannon and lots of \nlasers. It was slower=\r\n, though, and thus, would have more trouble \ntracking the Khan. Only the pi=\r\nlots could tell the odds...\n\nKatya: Skill, warriors. The trial begins now!\n=\r\n\nRagnar sent his metal titan walking forward, sending a volley of \nlasers a=\r\nt his opponent. He was thanked by laserfire and a swarm of \nmissiles. He kn=\r\new Vlad would try to hurt him by any means possible, \nboth because of what =\r\nhe stood for and because he had once been the \nPrince of an Inner Sphere re=\r\nalm, captured by Clan Wolf. He knew that \nrushing would only make him lose =\r\nhis target, so he preferred to close \ninto range and hurt his foe with what=\r\n he could.\n\nYet, as the fighting went on, no one noticed the energy wave co=\r\nming \nin. It had taken millions of years to reach this far in the universe,=\r\n \nhaving originated from the explosion of an empty moon.\n\nThe wave hit firs=\r\nt the mechs, then the ship, setting off the \nKearny-Fuchida drives that ena=\r\nbled hyperspace jumps. Within seconds, \nthe massive destruction machines va=\r\nnished from the skies of Strana \nMechty, three Clan officers along with it.=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
