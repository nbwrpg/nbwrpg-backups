A genie pops out of the jar and says he will \ngrant three wishes, one for each of them.\n\nFirst the Canadian steps up to the genie.  &quot;I am a farmer, my father \nwas a farmer, and his father before me.  I wish the soil in Canada to \nalways be fertile.&quot;\n\nThe genie nodded, and POOF the Canadian was sent home, Canada now \nbeing a fertile land for all of eternity.\n\nThen Osama Bin Laden stepped up.  &quot;I wish there was a great wall \nsurrounding Afghanistan to keep the infidels out.&quot;\n\nThe genie nodded and POOF Osama was sent to Afghanistan, sure enough \na wall was there.\n\nNow Uncle Sam approached the genie.  Being the civil engineer he is \nhe questioned the genie.  &quot;Well, about that wall around Afghanistan.  \nDescribe it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very well,&quot; the genie replied.  &quot;The wall is 15,000 feet high and \n500 feet thick.  It is impenatrable, no one can leave Afghanistan or \nenter it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good, good.&quot; the American said smiling.  &quot;Fill it completely with \nwater.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
