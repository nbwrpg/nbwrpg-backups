This scenario=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; happened to me at one time and of all mechs I had to get tangled up wi=\r\nth, it\n&gt; &gt; happened to be Sunstreaker and Sideswipe.  At the time they felt=\r\n that they\n&gt; &gt; were the hot shots of the Autobot faction and they felt I wa=\r\ns just another\n&gt; &gt; slow moving, fuel hungry off roader, like Trail Breaker,=\r\n Hound, Beach Comber\n&gt; &gt; and even Ratchet.  Although they had the spark to =\r\nridicule Ratchet behind\n&gt; &gt; his back, it was another story when he was arou=\r\nnd them.  &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He sighs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ratchet and I had a lot in common, =\r\nmostly our short tempers and low\n&gt; &gt; tolerance for ridicule by fellow soldi=\r\ners.  That too was something I got\n&gt; &gt; ridiculed for.  One day they went to=\r\no far with their snide commentary and I\n&gt; &gt; got into a severe altercation w=\r\nith the two of them.  I&#39;m not proud of this\n&gt; &gt; mind you, but I can&#39;t deny =\r\nthat it happened.  The fight ended with\n&gt; &gt; considerable damage to me and t=\r\nhe two of them, but more so to them.  Ultra\n&gt; &gt; Magnus had to literally pry=\r\n me off of them because of the strength advantage\n&gt; &gt; I had over them.  It =\r\nwasn&#39;t long before we were all brought to Optimus Prime\n&gt; &gt; due to our disp=\r\nute that I admit that I started, and he was not happy with\n&gt; &gt; all three of=\r\n us.  He did not discriminate against any of us and gave us our\n&gt; &gt; reprima=\r\nnds as equals all at the same time.  He then told us that the lesson\n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n be learned was that we needed to work as a team if we&#39;re ever to get over\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; our differences.  The brothers were not thrilled about that and neither=\r\n was\n&gt; &gt; I .  But we still did as we were instructed, we worked together du=\r\nring a\n&gt; &gt; weeks time, learning how to cooperate and learn about who we rea=\r\nlly were on\n&gt; &gt; the inside.  We never thought it would work until..&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; He gives a sigh.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was during one of our famous battles on Cyber=\r\ntron, we were under heavy\n&gt; &gt; fire by the Seekers and and they were much fa=\r\nster in flight than we were on\n&gt; &gt; wheels.  Side Swipe was on my left and S=\r\nunstreaker was on my right, a good\n&gt; &gt; distance ahead.  I tried to keep up =\r\nwith them but at the time my alt form\n&gt; &gt; was more suited for strength rath=\r\ner than speed.  It took only one shot from\n&gt; &gt; the seekers to destroy the r=\r\noad ahead of me, taking the twins with it.  At\n&gt; &gt; that time our difference=\r\ns meant nothing to me and I quicky shifted into\n&gt; &gt; robot mode, while still=\r\n in motion, mind you, I slid on my chest for a good\n&gt; &gt; twenty feet, reache=\r\nd out and caught their back bumpers just before the fell\n&gt; &gt; hood first int=\r\no a large bottomless void, created by the seekers.  They\n&gt; &gt; quickly transf=\r\normed but I still held onto them.  As soon as they turned\n&gt; &gt; around, I ret=\r\nained my position so they could climb to safety.  I was never\n&gt; &gt; in so muc=\r\nh pain in my life after that but for the first time, they were\n&gt; &gt; extremel=\r\ny thankful for what I had done, and they apologized for all the\n&gt; &gt; ridicul=\r\ne they inflicted on me and so I did the same and we shook hands.\n&gt; &gt; After =\r\nthat, we embraced each other, thankful we all made it out in one\n&gt; &gt; piece.=\r\n  I have a feeling the same could be so with my sister, Rattrap and\n&gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nelie.  But they may need more than just a week.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perpetually on the=\r\n move and constantly busy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Aug 25, 2011, at 9:42 AM, Super Cyclo=\r\nnus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; LEO PRIME glanced over at his conso=\r\nle as it beeped at him. &quot;Wheelie\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has arrived in at the Ark again.
