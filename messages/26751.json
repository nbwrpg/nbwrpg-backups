Not really getting things until it had been \nexplained to her several times.\nDiana watched him take off, running alongside. And, of course, she was left \nto run!\nShe then remembered the small dove wings at her back, flapping them and only \ncoming out with a cooled back and a fluttering sound. Diana narrowed her \neyes in frustration. &lt; at least I can impersonate a moter boat...&gt;\nShe did a little hop, skip and a jump at Rion&#39;s tail feathers before \nsettling beside him again.*\n\n&quot; Okay!
