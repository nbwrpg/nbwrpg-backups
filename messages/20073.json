Out of it came to old bots. They had \njournied to cybertron in search of victory and found defeat. Thier old leader \nmagmatron had betrayed them and doing so is losing the war. They ahd to warn \nthem. At one time this bot was called bobertron. A honorable destron. Now a \nprimal. And the one still known as pantron also a primal. Bobertron was now \ncalled spender. They stood tall. They flew off in search of Ultra Magnus \nknowing that he must be warned of magmatrons return.\n\n"}}
