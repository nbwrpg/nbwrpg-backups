The minions are\ntrying to keep a low profile, and are acting with military tactical\nstealth, but with the exception of Blackrazor, no one is using any\ncloaking technology at the moment.\n\nSuper Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From his position much nearer to the quarry a dark figure looked from\n&gt; the shadows, his shielding protecting him from the prying optic as\nwell\n&gt; as the errant sensor. &quot;Prepare yourselves.&quot; his whisper silent voice\n&gt; emanated over the channels. He paused and looked around one last\ntime,\n&gt; passive scanners seeking anything out of the ordinary ....\n&gt;\n\nBIC:\n\nNightrazor shook his head from the shadows of his sensor cloak as he\nspoke across the encrypted channel, his voice whisper quiet, &quot;There is\nno one even remotely close who could have observed her capture. This\nplace is useless to us.&quot;\n\n-------------------------\n\nDeepstryke, the largest of the figures nodded at his radio, &quot;As I\nfigured. Moving on to Plan B.&quot; He frowned as he looked over at the\nblack and red armored minion femme. &quot;What information do we have about\nthe location of her capture.&quot;\n\nPhobia took out a small PADD and looked over, &quot;Our target&#39;s last known\nlocation was nearly one thousand meters in that direction.&quot; The femme\npoints to a place a little off the river bed and much higher up.\n&quot;Sensors detected both Maximal and Predacon energy signatures.&quot; Phobia\ncontinued to read as she checked through the last logs. &quot;There is not\nmuch else.&quot; \n\nDeepstryke looked over to where Phobia pointed, &quot;Okay, then let&#39;s move\nthere and investigate. Perhaps there is some residual energy reading.\nIf she truly was in battle and was captured there should be something:\nBits of armor, burn marks, weapon fragments, casings, something. Let&#39;s\nmove out!&quot; \n\nThe rest nod to their leader as they all take to the air, and move to\ntheir secondary location - the location of Blacknightmare&#39;s battle with\nthe Maximals and Predacons.\n\n----------\n\nIn the distance Nightrazor watched the Valley Mine, a small smile crept\nacross his face. He looked down in annoyance as his radio vibrated\nalerting him to the fact the team was moving to their new location. \n\nWith a nod and Nightrazor disappeared.\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
