She sighed and stopped at \nher room.  She opened the door and walked in.  She motioned for him \nto join her.  &quot;Would you like some berries, oranges, peaches? I have \na wide veriaty thanks to your food machine in the mess hall. What \nwould you like?&quot; She tried to be a pleasent hostess, but she still \nfelt uneasy. He was still armed and she wasn&#39;t.  He could kill her \nand make up any story he wanted.  His leader would believe him and no \none would care that she was gone.  \n\nShe put on a cheerful smile and offered him some fruit from the bowl. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Rex::\n&gt; \n&gt; Rex looks at Battera, frowning.

He growls \nsilently. There \n&gt; were better things to do than eat fruit with Preds, but if nothing \nelse, he \n&gt; could keep an eye on her and make sure she didn&#39;t get into trouble.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Allright.
