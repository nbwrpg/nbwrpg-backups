I agree. In order to=\r\n save Megatron, Perceptor may have to try and reason with Hydras to hold of=\r\nf his attack on the Ark, or else Tucson will put that arrow through Megatro=\r\nn&#39;s chest chamber without remorse. Tucson has always resented Megatron and =\r\nthe Decepticons, as much as any Autobot would but, he&#39;s highly dedicated to=\r\n his comrades and to protecting the innocent. His short temper will prove a=\r\n challenge to the opposing enemy because when he gets his mind set on doing=\r\n something he doesn&#39;t back down. But if Hydras does as he demands, then he =\r\nmay consider being a tad more merciful but not by much.

Wel=\r\nl, part of that is starting to surface.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He&#39;s lost his temper and Strai=\r\nght Shot picked up on it. But to cover\n&gt;&gt; &gt; himself, he told her it was a p=\r\nure bluff. So it looks like he&#39;s bluffing to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; try to fool the enemy, or=\r\n is it really a bluff? Did he mean everything he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said, and did he also=\r\n intend to ram his foot into Megatron&#39;s fallen body?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a great c=\r\nhance for Rodimus to over come his self doubt as his own\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comrade&#39;s emo=\r\ntional stability seems to be wearing thin. And now, he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; threatens to pu=\r\nt an arrow straight through the chest of the fallen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Decepticon leader,=\r\n if the enemy does not stand down. You could call this a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fit of bottle=\r\nd up rage that he&#39;s had for a long time, since his own\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unfortunate inc=\r\nident when he was shot down and taken off line, only to fail\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in his mi=\r\nssion to protect his comrades. He doesn&#39;t take failure very well\n&gt;&gt; &gt; since=\r\n that, and he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make sure it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ha=\r\nppen again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Straight Shot doesn&#39;t know the full scope of Tucson&#39;s=\r\n issues, it may be up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to Rodimus to fill in the gaps for her.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; As far as what happened, it was the day that Rodimus had been taken by\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hydras, as Tucson desperately tried to fend off the enemy, by providing =\r\na\n&gt;&gt; &gt; decoy to get the enemy to focus on him rather than Rodimus. He was t=\r\naken\n&gt;&gt; &gt; off line by Cyclonus long before he could actually accomplish wha=\r\nt he was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; trying to do, and the only one who saw that shot, was Straigh=\r\nt Shot, who\n&gt;&gt; &gt; just shortly after that, was taken off line herself. Tucso=\r\nn was in vehicle\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mode when it happened, and can not remember anything =\r\nof that battle due to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the cranial shot he endured. This is what makes =\r\nhim so angry. The fact\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that he feels that he failed Rodimus and the ot=\r\nhers the first time, and now\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;s in danger of failing them again. You=\r\n could say that even though he may\n&gt;&gt; &gt; think he doesn&#39;t need help, he coul=\r\nd really use Rodimus&#39;s support right\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about now.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrp=\r\ng@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC=\r\n: I hope to be posting tommorrow or so, so many things to catch up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nn so many places. But I had a question :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; How is Talon inside=\r\n Tuscon? When Tuscon transforms back into robot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mode he is roughly h=\r\numan hieght or slightly larger, the same height as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly all the Ma=\r\nximals and Predacons are more or less. Talon would be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately =\r\nthe same size as Tuscon in this form - perhaps a few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; inches shorter =\r\nor so - seeing as Tuscon is a Prime an all that. But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; having said tha=\r\nt, having Tuscon holding holding Talon inside, that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a bit .=\r\n . . um . . . messy?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And I want to apologize about Tuscon&#39;s a=\r\nrrow. It was not that it was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ineffective, but it was just that Night=\r\nrazor was not visable any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; longer. When I am crafting a post, I try t=\r\no take into account just how\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much conversation or other actions have=\r\n gone on between each move. If\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Tuscon was tapping out his communicat=\r\nion to Rodimus and Straight Shot,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then that gave Nightrazor time to =\r\nhide or make other choices. I was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; giving you a hint to that when I h=\r\nad Rodimus speak in short sentences\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and remind Tuscon that the intru=\r\nder would not wait for lengthy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; communications.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am no=\r\nt trying to be mean. As a suggestion, imagine yourself saying\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the th=\r\nings Tuscon is saying in the middle of a battle or an intense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; scene =\r\nand you will see what I mean. Imagine how many things you could\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have=\r\n done in the time that it would have taken for Tuscon to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate=\r\n the information he did in morris code to straightshot and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, not trying to be mean, just accurate and realistic as =\r\nI can be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in a made up world where robots can transform and we break =\r\nlaws of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; physics with every stroke of the pen :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Presto=\r\nn\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 11, 2011 at 10:54 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Replying to Airly&#39;s post first,=\r\n going in that sequence.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inside th=\r\ne Ark, Tucson puts his hand over his chest, and gently does as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tal=\r\non had asked.

Wonder if =\r\nthey&#39;d fall for it? It&#39;s worth a try.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uproar and Quickst=\r\nride now approach Deep Stryke and the others with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their hands up i=\r\nn submission. Quickstride is the first to approach them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Okay, okay, you got us, you got us. Why don&#39;t we just show you guys an\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy way inta the ark hmm? That way we all get what we want and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s happy.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Far outside the parameters of the =\r\nArk, Night Shift and Rat Trap look up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in awe at the dinosaurs arou=\r\nnd them. Yet they keep quiet so is not to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alarm them. Yet, contact=\r\n could not be helped as a young Stegasaurous\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noses up to Night Shi=\r\nft, who is not in the least bit frightened by it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Woah, =\r\ncheck this out.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap gasps.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh g=\r\neeze, let&#39;s hope it&#39;s parents ain&#39;t around here somewhere.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The baby dinosaur groans, and looks back into the brush. Night Shift\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curiously follows it, and notices a larger stegasaurous standing ther=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a foot raised, with a large piece of wood lodged in it&#39;s le=\r\nft front\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foot.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, don&#39;t go too close ta that =\r\nthing! We dunno if it&#39;s friendly!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yelps Rat Trap, as Nig=\r\nht Shift approaches it. He looks back to Rat Trap\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; casually.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s okay, if it was gonna do somethn&#39; it would&#39;ve done it by =\r\nnow. Okay\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; big fella, easy. This is gonna hurt.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWith a swift hand he pulls the thorn out of the dino&#39;s foot. The dino\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; roars slightly but is quickly relieved of his pain. He&#39;s soon joined by=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his mate, and it&#39;s clear to see, that this was a family of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Stegasaurouses. He looks down to Night Shift, and nudges his hand with\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his nose gently.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s okay big guy, no sweat, yo=\r\nu go back with your family.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stegasaurouses now retre=\r\nat back into the forest, yet the little one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks back once more t=\r\nhankfully and then retreats. Rat trap smiles as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; watches them re=\r\ntreat.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about meetn&#39; some pretty large friends.

Quockstride&#39;s large blast cannon\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fires repeatedly into the air keeping the vicious Predacon at bay. =\r\nOne\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of his attacks catches him in the fuselage sending Waspinato=\r\nr spinning\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the air once more, smoke trailing behind him.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Waspinator hate all this!&quot; he said as he sailed awa=\r\ny!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windlord and Kup=\r\n continue firing against Scourge and Deepstrike.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Windlord and Kup continue their firefight, Scour=\r\nge swung out around\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them, forcing them to change their attacks a=\r\nnd swing with him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Deepstryke moved higher up and the =\r\nother way, swinging his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiple cannon mounts around at the sam=\r\ne time. However instead of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; firing at Kup or Windlord he targets =\r\nthe door to the Ark!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment.

Feel free to do the same, use the mo=\r\nrse coding, it will help us\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand each other to apprehend=\r\n him sufficiantly.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Tu=\r\nscon had his hands on Rodimus to pass the message he could feel\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRodimus move in the darkness, presumably nodding his head in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; und=\r\nerstanding. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Rodimus tapped back, knowing the code Tuscon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; was using.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Need move quick&quot; Rodimus tapped back q=\r\nuickly, &quot;Intruder not wait us\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodim=\r\nus motioned for them to spread out, &quot;Your senses better, find\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sw=\r\nitch&quot; he tapped again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; He stops to feel the vibrations of the floor.

A\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross breeze as stale as it was, would navigate him toward=\r\n an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emergency generator switch.

He w=\r\norked as fast as he could.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Perceptor could not seal off the room that the Autobots were in simply\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because the front chamber leading into the Aark was one large cham=\r\nber.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was not until they got further in that it branched off i=\r\nnto other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sections.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However with a small b=\r\neep the computer came fully to like. &quot;Main power\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restored.&quot; The =\r\ncomputer said calmly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Mom...&quot;said Elita with fear, and she ran towards the Medical bay,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she almos couldnt hold her tears. She was fearing that somethign\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really bad had happened to her.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus ran as well to the medical chamber, the whole way=\r\n, glancing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back at Elita to be sure that she was keeping up. Whe=\r\nn they got there\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the door was locked, sealed with a medical priv=\r\nacy code.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;FRAG!&quot; he said as he tried the door. &quot;With=\r\n the power down it won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognize me.&quot; Then with a hum the ligh=\r\nts began to come on in the hall\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the door began to buzz as it=\r\n scanned Ramulus. &quot;Identity Ramulus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detected and confirmed.&quot; The=\r\n door slid open\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus leaped inside and looked arou=\r\nnd, and in one corner, there was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight laying on her bed, u=\r\nnconscious, but other wise okay. &quot;O\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Primus!&quot; Ramulus said in rel=\r\nief as he looked over the readings. &quot;He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was no doctor, but to hi=\r\nm everything looked okay.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile through the rest =\r\nof the Ark lights began to flicker and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blink as main power began=\r\n to reassert itself. The computer&#39;s voice\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be heard echoing=\r\n off several panels as it worked through an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; internal diagnostics=\r\n check, &quot;Predacon signatures detected.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the room w=\r\nith Perceptor the computer began quickly pin pointing the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variou=\r\ns signatures both inside and within a mile of the Ark outside.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BACK OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time Torc=\r\na, Noctorro, AirHammer, Quicksilver and Bantor,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximal Fuzo=\r\nrs took this moment of distraction to rush the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons cannons=\r\n blazing!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several sweeps fell from the skies and Scou=\r\nrge as well took another\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit, this one sending a sizzling burn u=\r\np the side of his flank.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus was also hit, altho=\r\nugh he was able to twist in the air,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turning what would have nor=\r\nmally been a devastating blow into one that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glanced off his armo=\r\nr.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deepstryke was hit several times, forcing him to b=\r\nack off, his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boosters flaring as he began to retreat.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inferno also was damaged as he took a hit that was designed for=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras, the hit sent Inferno spiraling towards the ground as we=\r\nll.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As powerful as the Predacons were, they did not h=\r\nave all their forces\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there, and the Maximals were finally gettin=\r\ng their own forces\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together. The only thing that was holding the=\r\n Predacons together was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sheer power that Cyclonus and Hydras=\r\n and to a lesser extent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge and Deepstyke were bringing to b=\r\near on the Maximals!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That might change with the Ark b=\r\neginning to power up!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pre=\r\nston\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
