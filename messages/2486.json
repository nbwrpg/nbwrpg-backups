In the center of the room was a circular \nobject, a crystaline looking shape 10 ft high going upwards, 6 feet wide.  \nOpening a small panel in the circular object Koga placed the fang in.  \nPressing a few buttons on the side, he laughed.  &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a dozen \ncycles or so to check up on you.&quot; Shuko said, going to his quarters, getting \nin his private CR chamber, letting his mind wander off as he was being slowly \nrepaired (though he really didn&#39;t need repairs).\n\n"}}
