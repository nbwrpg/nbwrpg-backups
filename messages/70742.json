They needed more information on the=\r\n insectoids before they could actually do anything about them. He had learn=\r\ned that first hand himself.\n\n&quot;I agree Rodimus, they will not know what hit =\r\nthem, but in order to create such an impact, we must know more about the in=\r\nsectoids we encountered.  I too got that impression, when we were dealing w=\r\nith them.  They seemed extremely wise as heartless as they were.  Perhaps a=\r\n recon mission is in order..&quot;\n\nHe then continues to give the spark to Stant=\r\non.\n\n&quot;I see Stanton, you know best but if this can help Nightlight physical=\r\nly, please give it to her.&quot;\n\nRat Trap raises his paw with a serious look on=\r\n his rodent face.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll do it Sir, I&#39;ll do the recon mission.&quot;\n\nNight Shif=\r\nt raises his hand.\n\n&quot;Ditto.  You want Intel, I&#39;m will&#39;n ta help.&quot;\n\nStraight=\r\n Shot raises her hand as does Quickstride who replies for them both.\n\n&quot;Well=\r\n, looks like we&#39;re in too.  You&#39;ll need backup guys, and we&#39;re just as good=\r\n as anyone for that.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s very brave of you to offer. =\r\n Rodimus, and I can guide you through the tunnels, and as soon as you learn=\r\n anything, report back to the Ark as soon as possible and do not try to for=\r\nm an attack on your own.&quot;\n\nThey all reply.\n\n&quot;Yes Sir.&quot;\n\nTucson turns his he=\r\nad back to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I can not see, and you can.  Can you remember the ge=\r\nological layout of those tunnels?  Rat Trap and the others will need those =\r\nfor recon purposes.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;superc=\r\nyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson first holds Rodimus&#39;s hand gen=\r\ntly with a smile on his face. He was happy to see his comrade back on the m=\r\nend. And now he was never going to allow anything else to happen to him. He=\r\n takes his words into consideration with a nodd of compliance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Und=\r\nerstood Rodimus. I will not underestimate Cyclonus by any means, but I will=\r\n do my best to be sure that neither he or Hydras lays another harmful hand =\r\non any of the Maximals or Autobots ever again. And this time, I&#39;m very happ=\r\ny to have the help. I&#39;ll need it, I may be a Prime, but I know even the bes=\r\nt of warriors can do with having good comrades on his side. Legacy, I will =\r\nbe grateful for anything you can do to help Perceptor. And if Perceptor is =\r\ncomfortable with the extensive repairs, by all means, do try, but if it doe=\r\nsn&#39;t work, I will also understand. When I was last examined, I was also tol=\r\nd that my damage may be far too extensive to repair by normal means.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon nodding, &quot;There are two Primes now, tho=\r\nse\n&gt; Predacons will never know what hit them.&quot; His words were firm and no\n&gt;=\r\n nonsense. &quot;But we need more information on those insects before we go\n&gt; at=\r\ntacking them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus got a thoughtful expression on his face, &quot;I see=\r\nm to have the\n&gt; impression that the insects were old. While I was connected=\r\n to them, I\n&gt; could feel that they are a race that is nearly as old as the\n=\r\n&gt; transformers, but thier form was not always an insect type. I think\n&gt; the=\r\ny are adapting to us in a way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He then turns to Stant=\r\non.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Stanton, I have something for Nightlight. I hope it will be en=\r\nough to restore her.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He opens his chest and reveals his pulsating =\r\norb, which pulsates twice and forms a smaller version of itself. The small =\r\norb of energy pulsates in time with his own. He presents it to Stanton.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot; This is what helped me to bring Rodimus back. It&#39;s a power that feed=\r\ns off of compassion, hope, understanding, and kindness. The power of unity,=\r\n and a simple force that we all possess to a level of degree. It&#39;s what dre=\r\nw Rat Trap to find me, and what drew me to Talon and all of you. And now, I=\r\n wish to extend this to Nightlight, in hopes that the compassion we all sha=\r\nre, will be enough to help her through this difficult time.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straig=\r\nht Shot smiles as her own heart spark beats within her chest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Lov=\r\ne is definitely something our enemy doesn&#39;t have. And there&#39;s no other forc=\r\ne greater than that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Santon shook his head as he smiled at=\r\n Tuscon, &quot;Thank you.&quot; he said\n&gt; gravely, &quot;But that will not help here. Her =\r\nproblem is in her spark.\n&gt; That has the power to heal her physically, but n=\r\not to restore her lost\n&gt; memories.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bump nodded agreeing with Santon, =\r\n&quot;Proceedures involving a being&#39;s\n&gt; spark are always delicate and even dange=\r\nrous.&quot; He glanced at\n&gt; Perceptor, his optics clearly mistrustful and yet ho=\r\npeful at the same\n&gt; time, &quot;Maybe this is a way Perceptor can prove that he =\r\nwants to be a\n&gt; Maximal. Help us undo what he has done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Perceptor sighted, he hoped tht he was able to see again so he decided t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; take the risk&quot;I&#39;ll undergo that scan&quot;said the male&quot;Let see if I&#39;ll be=\r\n able\n&gt; &gt; to see again&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight was in deep stasis but her face =\r\nrevealed the sadness and sufering\n&gt; &gt; of her painful experience. Altough sh=\r\ne had recovered a little under the care\n&gt; &gt; of Perceptor and Rodimus, still=\r\n she looked tin and fragile and her wrist and\n&gt; &gt; ankles showed the marks o=\r\nf her restrain inside the pod where she had been\n&gt; &gt; most time of her capti=\r\nvity\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy had been standing with Bump looking over Nightl=\r\night, &quot;I concur\n&gt; with my collegues.&quot; he said, his voice as always cold and=\r\n clear,\n&gt; &quot;Clearly we have the greatest chance of success of repairing\n&gt; Ni=\r\nghtlight with perceptor&#39;s help. After we have done this, then we can\n&gt; look=\r\n into the efficacy of repairing Perceptor.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
