With the grace of Fred Astaire he\ncharges forward causeing the missle to hit where he once stood, he ran\ntoward a nearby tree and used it to catapult him into the air in the\ndirection of Slayer. In the air Slayer had an advantage Lunarpines strategy\nwas to bring him down and fight on a level playing field.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, October 19, 2000 5:30 PM\nSubject: Trainers at the Ark\n\n\n&gt; Oooh, this could get ugly.

Not wasting anymore time, Slayer aims his gun, firing a missile at\n&gt; Lunarpine.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hearing shots, Ramulus runs out of the Ark, grabbing a cloaking device on\nhis\n&gt; way and activating it. He disappears (to the eye), running out of the Ark\nand\n&gt; firing at where Koj had said Prebon was.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Smokescreen rushes out of the base, cloaked once again. Seeing a few shots\n&gt; emerge out of nowhere (one of the Trainers&#39;), he fires at the spot,\nrunning\n&gt; to the edge of the clearing of the Ark so he could get some cover.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto flies out of the Ark, cloaking himself as he opens fire on where Koj\n&gt; had said Prebon was.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
