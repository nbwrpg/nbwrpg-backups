His right talon fired 25 shots of energy at Kali .\n&gt; \n&gt; Mech fluid was slowly seeping from his frame where a combination of \nweapons\n&gt; had penetrated. He had to think of a way out. A sudden surge and a \nvoice\n&gt; came through his head. &quot;Head northeast, theres a sinkhole near the \nold\n&gt; Predacon base. You can hide in there.&quot; Ignatius thought he was \ngoing insane\n&gt; hearing voices. He decided to sort his sanity out later.
