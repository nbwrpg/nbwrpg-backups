His expression as wise\n&gt; as the one on Master Yoketron&#39;s face whenever he was challenged by students\n&gt; who felt he was a bit of a pushover.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Is that what you believe, Hot Rod?  Have you ever engaged me formally in\n&gt; combat?  And have you ever really seen beyond what your eyes see now?  I\n&gt; will not believe your words until you have proven that to me, face to face.\n&gt; One  can never fully assume until he has proven himself in valid combat.  So\n&gt; I take it you are challenging me.  In that case, I accept.  But be prepared,\n&gt; I am NOT as predictable as you think I am.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He takes a walk around Rodimus, waiting for his reaction.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is worth more than family and friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 31, 2012, at 2:16 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - Nightlight&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The autorepair system of Nightlight was very damaged and varely keep her\n&gt;&gt; &gt; alive.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RODIMUS looked down at NIGHTLIGHT, his optics dark and brooding and\n&gt;&gt; then he looked up at SABERBACK anger painted in them clearly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;If you want your little female repaired then you had better get your\n&gt;&gt; cranial unit out of your hind quarters!&quot; MAGMATRON said as he looked\n&gt;&gt; at DARK RODIMUS, his optics glowing dangerously. It was obviouslthat\n&gt;&gt; he was full of some sort of dark power.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS stood up angrilly for a moment but then backed up a step,\n&gt;&gt; as if he were seeing something in MAGMATRON&#39;s optics that even he had\n&gt;&gt; not seen before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; SABERBACK nodded as he pointed at the approaching TUSCON and those\n&gt;&gt; that were with him. &quot;They won&#39;t reach us yet, but soon. We must be\n&gt;&gt; ready for the final stage.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Stage of what?&quot; DARK RODIMUS said as he looked away from MAGMATRON to\n&gt;&gt; glance at SABERBACk and then at the severaly weakened OPTIMUS PRIME.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Him? He is no threat to us!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With a shake of his head SABERBACK looked at RODIMUS, &quot;Don&#39;t worry\n&gt;&gt; about that boy, just get ready to defend yourself!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To rise up to an impossible challenge meant having to do something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extraordinary. But deeds of extraordinary feats did not have to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; larger\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than life. Hearing past phrases from Master Yoketron , Tucson rides the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; torrent of water as if flying through air, as wings double as fins,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guiding him masterfully toward the root of the problem. Saberback. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was the one hindering his progress. Once again he shifts from dragon to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; warrior and draws his blade while still riding the wave of water like a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; skilled surfer, using the walls of the cavern like a surf board, gaining\n&gt;&gt; &gt; altitude and ground on Saberback. Yet he makes no attempt to strike him\n&gt;&gt; &gt; directly. With his sword Tucson guides the water over the blade, in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sideways position, guiding a torrent of water in Saberbacks direction,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; an attempt to throw him off long enough to rescue Optimus Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; A storm can find anyone, no matter how devious they may think they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, it&#39;s time that a few tables were turned. LEO! SURROUND RODIMUS\n&gt;&gt; &gt; AND DETAIN HIM! BIG CONVOY, I NEED YOU TO SECURE NIGHTLIGHT!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; MAXIMALS, PREDACONS, OPERATION STORM, NOW!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY, along with the rest of the MAXIMALS quickly\n&gt;&gt; moved down the center of the room as well, allowing TUSCON to take the\n&gt;&gt; lead at the moment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; VICE GRIP had fallen in over behind CRYOTEK, ready over to assist in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; flanking position as they came face to face over with MAGMATRON and what\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seemed to be.. OPTIMUS PRIME.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DINOBOT was ahead and over to flank, and while still etnirely confused -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OPTIMUS was still aboard the ARK, and it was supposed to be impossible\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; clone sparks forged from the MATRIX, he held back over and waited to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attack.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let the MAXIMALS weaken themselves first after all, and then charge in!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So now, the duo of PREDACONS watied like stooges over for the orders to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attack, ready to rush forwards and gut anything in their path!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile the other PREDACONS looked at TUSCON and then at CRYOTEK and\n&gt;&gt; SKY SHADOW.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Who does that Tuscon think he is?&quot; INJECTOR, one of the FUZORS said.\n&gt;&gt; &quot;He doesn&#39;t rule here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;No!&quot; CRYOTEK said. &quot;But I do, and I want Optimus Prime dead! Now Move!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With that the PREDACONS also took to the air and ran along the ground,\n&gt;&gt; running along with TUSCON but having a very different objective in\n&gt;&gt; mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The water flowed down the center of the vast chamber, finding the\n&gt;&gt; original channel it had once possesed. At first it was a walkl of\n&gt;&gt; water, then a break as it filled out and then it was a powerful font\n&gt;&gt; of water that ran swiftly towards its goal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However before it reached the pillar of fire like energy it bisected,\n&gt;&gt; splitting into two streams and began to flow around it. It had made\n&gt;&gt; contact with a shield, a shield which for the moment protected\n&gt;&gt; MAGMATRON, SABERBACK and DARK RODIMUS as well as other SHARKTICONS\n&gt;&gt; that were spilling out from the cave opening near to their location.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DARK RODIMUS looked up at TUSCON and the others and laughed as he\n&gt;&gt; spoke to SABERBACK and MAGMATRON. &quot;There is no reason to worry, that\n&gt;&gt; bungling idiot TUSCON, he couldn&#39;t fight his way out of a paper bag.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the same time others of MAGMATRON&#39;s troops began to appear,\n&gt;&gt; dinosaur like troops of all shapes and numbers. And MAGMATRON himself\n&gt;&gt; looked as if he had grown to nearly twice his size. He was standing\n&gt;&gt; nealy a full 20&#39; tall!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He laughed as well! &quot;You have come to your doom!&quot; His voive echoed\n&gt;&gt; about the vast chamber.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This was not going to be easy at all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
