So with thick claws he does just that, using\n&gt; his tail for balance.  He thought of using it to swat away the weapons that\n&gt; were so annoyingly placed around him but his judgement told him otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; There would be a good possibility that he might have to tangle with an enemy\n&gt; more powerful then himself.  Yet he was prepared to do anything for the sake\n&gt; of preservation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Old dragon, could this be why you have guided me here?  This used to be\n&gt; your kingdom and now you hope that I will continue your legacy?  I hope I\n&gt; can do that old friend, I hope I can.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is no immediate answer to TUCSON&#39;s question as he was led by\nGUILEDART, HARDHEAD and HYDRA down through brush and foliage and\nacross one path and to the next.\n\nFinally they reach the clearing that held the strange energy door and\nstepped through, and immidiately they were all plunged into darkness!\n\nThe ground beneath TUSCON&#39;s feet changed as he stepped through. On one\nside there was dirt and soil mixed with leaves and discarded branches.\nOn the other side there was the hard and unyielding feel of cold\nmetal, there was a scratching noise made as TUSCON&#39;s nails raked\nacross it as he attempted to keep the same grip he had outside.\n\nAs they walked overhead lights began to flicker on and TUSCOn could\nsee that he was in a hallway, also made of metal, it had the feel of\nthe interior of a ship or perhaps a base.\n\nThey came to a single large door that looked thick enough to stop\ngrimlock and full rage! In front of it a single Predacon was standing\nand he turned to look at GUILDART as he approached. &quot;My my.&quot; He said,\na hiss in his voice. &quot;What have we got here?&quot;\n\nGUILEDART came to a stop, &quot;It is . . . good to see you Rapticon.&quot; He\nsaid as he bowed his head slightly in greeting. &quot;It is a gift for\nMagmatron.&quot; He said looking at him warilly.\n\nBehind him HARDHEAD and HYDRA kept their weapons trained on TUSCON,\nbut there was a definite fear of this creature in front of them as\nwell.\n\nRAPTICON looked nearly identicle to the transmetaled DINOBOT that\nMEGATRON had made near the end of the first Beastwars. He looked like\nan armored skeletal version with bladed claws, sharp teeth and a\nglowing mechanical optic that replaced on of his more organic looking\nones.\n\n&quot;He does look tasty.&quot; RAPTICON said as he smiled at TUSCON. &quot;But I do\nbelieve that Magmatron will want the pleasure of dealing with him\nhimself.&quot;\n\nGUIULEDART nodded, &quot;As I would have surmized.&quot;\n\nRAPTICON gestured at the door as he looked at TUSCON, &quot;Magmatron bids\nyou welcome.&quot; Although his words might seem cordial, the tone and\nmanner from RAPTICON was anything but!. Instead there was his manner\nwas that of spider inviting a fly into a web.\n\nHe chuckled as he stepped aside and the door began to iris open,\nalmost like teeth in some great maw opening.\n\nNEXT POST: MAGMATRON\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
