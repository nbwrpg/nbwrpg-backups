Now it was his turn. \nHe wasn&#39;t that into it. After she threw another into the air, he waited \nuntil it was a few inches from the ground, then he fired. The rock split \ninto two, and pieces shattered from the side as they both hit the ground. It \nwasn&#39;t his best, but it wasn&#39;t a real enemy. He was used to fighting with \nother bots, even to spar with.\n\nHe wanted to do something to entertain himself. KitKat kept him occupied. At \nleast she tried for conversation. He grin appeared on his mouth plate. &quot;Ah \ngotta idea, let&#39; give Sinester and Sinesis uh nickname. Ah&#39;m bettin&#39; on Dumb \nand Dumber.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
