That does it let teh brawl begin!&quot; Recon yelled, he ran\n&gt;   right for Terrorbot with the crystal and then flung it like a javeline \n&gt;right\n&gt;   at Terrorbot&#39;s chest. The crystal hit Terrorbot hard, he roared in pain \n&gt;as\n&gt;   he ripped it out and crushed it. He was about to blow Recon away, when \n&gt;he\n&gt;   stopped. &quot;Master,&quot; Terrorbot said. He transformed back to dragon mode \n&gt;and\n&gt;   then flew off. &quot;Master?
