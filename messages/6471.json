His gun arm trembles \nslightly, but keeps steady. He looks over at Dark One in surprise as the \nleader of the Oblitercons laughs.\n\n&quot;All blast doors, close.&quot;\n\nA grinding sound fills the area after that command from Dark One. The light \ncoming in from the hole darkens, leaving the room slightly darker. After \nseveral seconds, all goes silent.\n\n&quot;Now, Tigerhawk,&quot; Dark One says smoothly, &quot;With the blast doors closed, your \nexplosion would do little more than kill us all in here.&quot;\n\nHe looks over at Tigerhawk, his eyes narrowing. &quot;You would kill these two \nfemales along with yourself. Our deaths, however, will go unnoticed. Zardus \nwould just find more troops to replace us, or use our spare parts, and yours, \nto make more soldiers. I suggest you take your hand off that button, and toss \nit to Scatter-I mean Punch over there.&quot;\n\nScattershot jumps up and down, DeathStorm&#39;s head nearly falling off. &quot;Boom! \nDetonate it, detonate it!&quot;\n\nPunch growls, waiting for Tigerhawk to either push the button or toss him the \ndevice.\n\n"}}
