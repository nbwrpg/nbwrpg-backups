Meaning, he&#39;s surrounded by a \nmetal prison of sorts, he can&#39;t seem Switchblade or Firestrike (it \ndoesn&#39;t have bars of anything), but he can by all means talk to \nthem. You&#39;ll prolly want to repost.\n\n-- Switchblade / Astrotrain --\n\nSwitchblade smiles, &quot;Perceptor, I would have thought you smarter \nthan to try such a foolish act.&quot; He toys with the &quot;Megatron&quot; in his \nhand, and aims at the metal prison, fully prepared to destroy the \nbot, and parts of the base in the process. &quot;Is there a GOOD reason \nfor your idocy? A reason that would prevent me from shooting?&quot;\n\nAstrotrain enters the room, &quot;Whoa, what happened?&quot;\n\nSwitchblade smiles, &quot;Perceptor is about to lose control of something \nvery important to him.&quot;\n\nAstrotrain walks over to Switchblade, and glances at the metal cage. \nThen over at the control panel, and shakes his head. &quot;Are you sure \nyou want Perceptor to die?&quot;\n\nSwitchblade turns his head to face the much larger Astrotrain with a \nwarning glance, and speaks in a cautious tone, &quot;Astrotrain, such \nindecision will get you killed someday. If Perceptor dies, I could \ncare less. However, I think that Firestrike would take more pleasure \nof out of it.&quot; He spins &quot;Megatron&quot; and hands it handle first to his \nlackey. &quot;Enjoy the destruction, Firestrike.&quot; The small bot turns and \nsaunters over to his slightly singed chair, sits down, and kicks his \nfeet up.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Ok I&#39;ll repost. \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor::\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor moved slowly in the darkness and said &quot;SO...&quot;said angry \nthe \n&gt; male&quot;even I&#39;ve sworn loyalty to you Swichblade, you try to kill \n&gt; me????
