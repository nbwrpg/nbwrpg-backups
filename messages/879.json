When the dust finally \nsettled she slowly opened them, only to stare into the angry optics of \nBrightBlade.\n\nBefore Tavatron knew what had happened she was laying on her back, \nmech-fluid flowing from the wound on her chest. Tavatron instinctively \ncovered the wound, trying to slow the flow of mech-fluid, but with little \nsuccess. Tavatron looked up at BrightBlade and growled:\n\n&quot;I am not that easily defeated!&quot; Tavatron flipped to her feet (think that \nthing martial artists do when they fall down) and seperated her staff. She \nunsheathed the energon blades and threw one of the halves at BrightBlade&#39;s \nchest.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
