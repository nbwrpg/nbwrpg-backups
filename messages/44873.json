In this \nRPGs \n&gt; storyline the Maximals returned and Predacons came to Earth to \ngather energon \n&gt; to power the Predacon fleet. The maximals came back to stop them. SO \nas you \n&gt; can see BM did not happen in this RPGs story therefore it only \nexists in \n&gt; alternate dimensions. Winged was very creative with the way he \ninserted the \n&gt; reformatting idea, although I did not agree with him \ntechno-organicing \n&gt; australlia atleast he didn;t go about saying they came from the same \n&gt; cybertron as the original people. Also I have not seen a speck of \nany kind of \n&gt; moding with his charachters.\n\n\n"}}
