At the \nside of the clearing was an opened stasis pod.  He looked around fascinated, \nand looking to fight.  He spotted a large saber tooth tiger in a tree just \nbefore it crushed him.\n\n::????????::\n    He crushed the pathetic bot and transformed slashing and hacking at Amp&#39;s \nchest with his twin daggers.  Before killing him he asked &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n\n::Amp::\n    &quot;I am Amp.  But who are you?&quot;\n\n::????????::\n    &quot;I am the bot who has no name.  I was the slave of a great bot.  \nUnfortunately for him he had me trained too well.  As soon as I became a \nweapons master I killed him.  His body was never found rather it was never \nidentified.  You should be honored I shall derive my name from yours.&quot;  He \nfinishes Amp off by impaling his head with both daggers.  &quot;I am Amperion now!&quot;\n\n::Amperion::\n    &quot;He heads deep into the woods in order to find one worthy of training \nunder him.\n\n"}}
