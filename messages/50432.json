WRONG. \n&gt; Necromancer  and Hell\n&gt; Drak were  brother and sister, giant dragons  for\n&gt; beast  mode.  In a feud\n&gt; with Decadel.  Decadel captured Hell Drak,\n&gt; Necromancer had the Maximals help\n&gt; him save her.  Hell Drak was possessed by Decadel\n&gt; with his special worm\n&gt; devices, and Decadel attempted to enslave many bots.\n&gt;  I&#39;m sure not many\n&gt; remember  that.  NECROMANCER WAS TRULY ALWAYS MY\n&gt; CHARACTER.  HE WAS GIVEN\n&gt; AWAY, BECAUSE I WAS FORCED  AWAY FROM THE RPG.

(This is not intended\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; be a flame)  First of\n&gt; &gt; all, I just wanted to have an interesting\n&gt; entrance,\n&gt; &gt; you know, make  people\n&gt; &gt; notice.  Also, as for Skulletron/Slaughter having\n&gt; &gt; potential, that is a big\n&gt; &gt; understatement, if you look  back on the olden\n&gt; days \n&gt; &gt;  of NBWRPG(the better\n&gt; &gt; days) I had the &quot;potential&quot; to be one of the top\n&gt; &gt; RPers.  As I have ranted on\n&gt; &gt; about before, I am nowhere  near to being new to\n&gt; &gt; this RPG.  But thank you\n&gt; &gt; for the compliment, Skulletron was my first\n&gt; &gt; character, and this is the.....\n&gt; &gt; 3rd time, I believe....that I have brought him\n&gt; back.\n&gt; &gt;  I have always taken my\n&gt; &gt; characters seriously, and unlike my buddy\n&gt; Hollywood\n&gt; &gt; Narrator over there(this\n&gt; &gt; is not an insult  to you, HN) I always do\n&gt; &quot;serious&quot;\n&gt; &gt; characters.  Some of my\n&gt; &gt; best works include Skulletron, Decadel,\n&gt; Necromancer,\n&gt; &gt; Hell Drak, and.....\n&gt; &gt; actually, I consider just about all of my old\n&gt; &gt; characters to be good works. \n&gt; &gt; I am also impressed with the characters and plots\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; see now, and I look\n&gt; &gt; forward to bringing back old characters, debuting\n&gt; &gt; brand new ones,  and\n&gt; &gt; interacting with you guys...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -------Original Message-------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: August 05, 2002 07:48:16 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: ooC: people...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll stop when they do.  But Rauq, even you have\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; admit that HNC&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; inaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to\n&gt; &gt; read the first \n&gt; &gt; line, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; start-up is the most \n&gt; &gt; over-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all you\n&gt; &gt; need is a shot of \n&gt; &gt; Dr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a\n&gt; ripoff\n&gt; &gt; of every single \n&gt; &gt; horror movie out there.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as characters are concerned, Terminion and \n&gt; &gt; Skullertron/Slaughter actually display both\n&gt; &gt; personality and \n&gt; &gt; potential.  The remaining four have been\n&gt; &gt; cannon-fodder thus far.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to prove\n&gt; &gt; me right or wrong \n&gt; &gt; by roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a\n&gt; serious\n&gt; &gt; RPG, not a \n&gt; &gt; slapstick movie, so if I see another post/exchange\n&gt; &gt; like HNC&#39;s first \n&gt; &gt; one, where everyone involved is an absolute idiot,\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; will ingore \n&gt; &gt; every post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s)\n&gt; &gt; regardless of who \n&gt; &gt; they are or think they are.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering.\n&gt; &gt; Megatron is waiting \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; right now, but I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; still have to read the posts up till when i last\n&gt; &gt; checked em.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this\n&gt; &gt; obviously aint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises\n&gt; verbal\n&gt; &gt; shields*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease fire\n&gt; &gt; in this flame war \n&gt; &gt; &gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it\n&gt; started\n&gt; &gt; wrong right from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt; been said, were \n&gt; &gt; said, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at\n&gt; &gt; defusing the situation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and it blew up. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting\n&gt; &gt; style, that&#39;s your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it,\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a bunch of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; way you&#39;d like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting,\n&gt; &gt; if you want to say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; really hard to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog\n&gt; &gt; shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same context.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should\n&gt; shut\n&gt; &gt; up about this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing.\n&gt; &gt; Nothing anyone can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being\n&gt; &gt; quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
