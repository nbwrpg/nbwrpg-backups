He falls \nunconcious as well.  JetV sees Artemis fall and jumps for her but the \nEMP blast knocks him out finally and he falls to the ground in a dead \nheap.  Repugnus, doesn&#39;t fall quite unconcious as he switches to a \nsecond power source.  &quot;Whats happening?&quot; he siad loudly.  Then the \nship jerked propeliing him into a wall and sucking up the rest of his \nenergy.  Slag fell then stood, not daring ot give in until his own \nleader did.\n\nOutside of the Hidden one Needlenose goes unconscience.  As he falls \ninto the drift of space he nails the window of the D.E.D ship.  The \nwindow cracks and small fragments come out.  ZigZag and Suntreaker \ntransform not affected much by the emp blast. The two nebulans Attach \na wire to Needle nose and jump through a crack in the window, which \nwould be small to arobot, but perfect for a nebulan.  As they land \ninside they tie the wire to a hold and then ship jerked throwing them \nand knocking them out.  Havotron notices them.  The EMP blast weakens \nhim considerably and he makes the mistake of trying to talk, which \nuses the last of his energy and puts him out. Quake falls to the \nground as he tries to carry a weak bot.  Scrapper tries to make sense \nof something he cannot then finally falls.  The ship follows behind \nthe hidden one into the portal. As they come out Havotron comes \nto.  &quot;Spinister, where are you, get this ship in control.&quot;  He looks \nout the front window seeing Needlenose attached and begininng to heat \nup.  The fall in a crazy spin towards a island in the present day \narchpiligo of Japan.  Quake wakes up and grabs Scrapper of of him who \nhad fallen there.  &quot;Aww, jeez my back..&quot;\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Artemis/Sludge\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sludge was thrown to a ship&#39;s wall and he was knocked out.
