Suddenly the missles explode in mid air as a burst of energy\nstrikes them down. Blaze stands, disruptor in hand awaiting further attacks.\nShe aims at Hovok firing three shots from her disruptor.\n\nIgnatius joins Slayer in his attempts to bring down Wheeljack. he fires his\neyebeams at the Alliance bot, and two missles at the shields covering the\npower unit.\n\nHammer rises again and fires an energy beam across the battlefield, moving\nback and forth at Sharpedge and Godfather.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re taking abuse here&quot; Hammer calls out. With the limited cover he didn&#39;t\nfeel such a small unit could be much effect.\n\nPrebon believed differently though as he continued to push for advancement,\nthe disruptorblasts were doing thier job and weakening the shields but it\nstill wasn&#39;t fast enough. &quot;Continue the advance, so far theres been little\nresistance, as long as they can&#39;t call for reinforcements we have the upper\nhand.&quot; Prebons inspirational words pushed the Trainers forward with the need\nfor success or deleation.
