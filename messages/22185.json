She called stand down, \n&gt; something that told him to stop attacking, but she was a stranger. \nHe \n&gt; went on with the attack. He slashed at her with his sword just to \n&gt; scare her, then grabbed her around the neck with his free hand. He \n&gt; spun around and slammed her back into the wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where am I?&quot; he demanded. \n&gt; \n&gt; (Just a reminder, Berserk is a clone of Megatron except his armor \nis \n&gt; different.)\n\n\n\n"}}
