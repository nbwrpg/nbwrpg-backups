But with\nthe amount of damage she had sustained, she was surprised that she wasn&#39;t in\nstasis lock yet.\nBut she stayed there, unmoving for a few more moments. Knowing that the\nMaximals were getting closer and would be upon her in seconds.\nWith a strangled groan she tried to haul herself onto her hands and knees\nagain, but just fell to the ground again with a disdainful whimper.\nBut then, with a last desperate act of will, she began to pull herself\ntowards the shaft with her hands. Her going even slower now. But it was SO\nclose.\nWith one last pull of her arm she came to the shaft opening, snaking in her\nhand and opening the door that covered it.\nBrightBlade let out a whimper at what she saw and sank to the ground, her\nhead finally resting on her hands.\nThere was a bar over the entrance to the shaft, cutting it off so that there\nwasn&#39;t a chance in the Pit that she could get through.\nIf she had been stronger she would have just reefed the bar out and went\nthrough the shaft, but she wasn&#39;t.\nAnd now there was nowhere to run no more exits that were close by.\nShe was trapped there, exhausted and utterly defeated. Her wounds bled\ndeeply upon the floor and made it slick with her fluid, her systems slowly\nfading into the final act.stasis lock.\nBrightBlade simply stayed there and waited for the Maximals to arrive,\nprobably ready to blow her head off and there was nothing that she could do.\nBut she would get out, if it took a million years she would get out.\nShe only had to wait.\nTime would be on her side. *\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
