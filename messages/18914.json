He fires his forearm saw, it is replaced by\nanother. The saw heads for Breakdown, homing in on him and spinning deadly.\n\n&gt; Pyro ducked, the missile dragging flames into Pyro&#39;s face.

The base didn&#39;t take much damage, their shields came back\non, but the autoguns were nothing but 2 big ones.
