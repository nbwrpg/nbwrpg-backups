I&#39;ll try to \nget back fast, but I don&#39;t want to promise anything.\n\nHe heads back to the mess hall, where he assumes Talos is.\n\nBlackfang: Unit Blackfang ready for action, sir!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; He goes looking for Talos.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; {Talos}\n&gt; Mess Hall\n&gt; \n&gt;     Things were looking better in the mess hall, the salvagable \nchairs and\n&gt; tables were upright and the bar unit and energon stores were alright \nfor the\n&gt; moment, but they&#39;d need to begin searching for reserves soon. By now \nthe\n&gt; reports of the communications repairs had filtered in as well as \nreports of\n&gt; the sensor enhancment to the north.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Looking around he nodded to those present and made his way back \nto the\n&gt; bridge. The first day of the new beast wars had gone smoothly with \nonly a\n&gt; few minor problems left to deal with. First were the two younger \nbots on\n&gt; board, he had no idea how they got there, this wasn&#39;t a passenger \nship but\n&gt; the fact of the matter they were here and that meant they had to be \nincluded\n&gt; in the mission.\n&gt; \n&gt;     As he walked onto the bridge nodding to Sunhawk since he seemed \nto be\n&gt; looking for him he took his chair and turned to regard the \nleutenient even\n&gt; as he played over the second issue in his thoughts, Sunhawk was a \nwanted\n&gt; felon. He knew it and Sunhawk knew it. However he was willing to \ngive any\n&gt; bot, no matter the tarnish on his or her record, an opportunity to \nprove\n&gt; themselves. He held no doubts that Sunhawk would be taken into \ncustody by\n&gt; the port officials when the mission was done with, but depending on \nhow the\n&gt; bot held himself during this mission would decide wether or not he&#39;d \nhave\n&gt; Talos&#39; good word put in for him.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Turning he noticed one of the consoles blinking, turning \ndistracted from\n&gt; his thoughts and Sunhawks report as he investigated. A weak signal \nwas being\n&gt; caught by the new arrays dish. It seemed like an outdated distress \nbeacon\n&gt; signal and maximal in design, but this algorithim hadn&#39;t been used\n&gt; since...the original beast wars.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Talos rose shaking his head, impossible. There&#39;s no way one of \nPrimals\n&gt; crew could still be here could there? He couldn&#39;t chance it. \nPressing a\n&gt; button on the comm he spoke, &quot;Hot Rod, Blackknight, report to the \nbridge for\n&gt; new orders.&quot; Sitting back in his chair he turned back to regard \nSunhawk.\n\n\n"}}
