It \nlay \n&gt; there while she tried a new connection to it&#39;s optics.  She went \n&gt; through the optic connections from where she was up through the \n&gt; central brain stem and routed through the cranial connections to \nthe \n&gt; optics.  This time, it started to work.  She could see, like \nlooking \n&gt; through extremely blurry bionoculars.  She found the small \nconnection \n&gt; to the vocal box inside the protoform&#39;s throat.  She tried to make \nit \n&gt; speak, but only a few squeeks and some hushed  muttering came out.  \n&gt; It was going to take time to get the voice to work, but she had \n&gt; nothing but time on her hands as far as she was concerned.\n\n\n"}}
