A body, fit and pure, made for your warri=\r\nor spark.&quot; It would seem like mere moments later that the work was complete=\r\nd. The work station slid aside, then the wall seperating the two Decepticon=\r\ns slid the opposite way. Megatron X stepped forward to grasp the framework =\r\nHolding Maxima in place, pulling it forward to allow her to take her first =\r\nstep into the lab.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The frame began to fall away, leaving her to sta=\r\nnd on her own two feet before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nCrimson optics flashed brightly t=\r\nhen remained a continuous glow like burning embers. \nMoments following, her=\r\n legs moved to take her first step in this new body. What seemed wobbly at =\r\nfirst now became strong without a doubt. First step landed with a heavy met=\r\nallic thunk upon the floor. Followed by another as her other leg came up al=\r\nongside. \n\nStanding tall before Megatron X, a form ever so worthy of the ol=\r\nd Decepticon. A tall, stout, and menacing form, albeit a femme, she wasn&#39;t =\r\nthe type to be fragile. Her fingers flexed as she glanced down at them. Not=\r\n long with claws as she use to have but that could be remedied. \nSo.. now, =\r\nshe accessed her weapons. \nWith a whir and hum, chunk and tink... her weapo=\r\nns formed and transformed from her arms and shoulders, even one cannon that=\r\n flipped down from her back to poke out from beside her waist. \n\n&quot;Impressiv=\r\ne,&quot; she chimed in with that sultry malicious deep femme voice. Her tone ref=\r\nlected how pleased she was with this new form. And good ridence to the tech=\r\nno-organic form. No self-respecting Cybertronian would be techno-organic. S=\r\nhe&#39;ll leave that to the horrifying experiments conducted by the Quintessons=\r\n. \n\nThose crimson optics returned to Megatron X, looking at him, as a smile=\r\n curled upon her metallic lips. &quot;The Decepticons... return.&quot; Her optics fla=\r\nshed brightly once more. \n\n\n"}}
