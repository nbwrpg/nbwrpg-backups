Hearling him growl was nothing that even phased \nher, knowing that the Alliance was beneath her Predacon heritige. A lession \nshe had learned while watching her Lord, Hell Beast.\nTo her they were dirt, grungy dogs that simply deserved to get their butts \nwhopped when ever they cam within sight. At least, that was how she saw \nthem.\nHowever, she WAS fairly impressed of how they mannaged to capture the \nMaximals Third In Command and that other mutt, Tavatron was her \nname...wasn&#39;t it.\nShe snickered evily at the name, she remembered fighting THAT one. But then \nshe remembered just whom she was almost forced to fight just because she \npicked a battle with the she-wolf, Dinobot. Now THERE, she was out-matched. \nNo hope of leaving the field alive.\nBut then she snickered again: Herself, going after his percious Tavatron.\nAny bot whom was blind could see that there was feelings there, feelings \nthat involved the spark. But it was also a weakness. One that could be \nexploited greatly.\nBrightBlade made a mental note about such a thing, something to remember \nthen next time she came up against Dinobot&#39;s little girlfriend.\nBut then she looked back at Perndabot, his gun now level with her chest. The \nAlliance had done well, for dirt covered hounds.\nShe looked up into his face, the same defiying smile on her face.*\n\n&quot; You need not remind me, I know.&quot;\n\n* Her voice was polite and she had no harshness in it, simply stating her \nfact without any insolent actions. She didn&#39;t want to cause trouble today, \njust get back towards her journey towards the Cybertronien Fire.\nBrightBlade reached out and ran her fingure over the berrel of Perdabot&#39;s \ngun, then looking at the fingure plainly as if checking for dust.\nShe looked back to him.*\n\n&quot; Nice gun. Anyway, I have to congradulate you, on recently capturing Iron \nRaptor and that Tavatron...quite a feat I&#39;d say.&quot;\n\n* She then crossed her arms again and leaned against the tree, in no hurry \nto leave her current position.*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
