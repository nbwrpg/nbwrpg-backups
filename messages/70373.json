Again, after having found \n&gt; Rodimus, his vision begins to fail him, until everything just seems to \n&gt; black out all at once.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes Legacy, please, take him back to saftey.  Unfortunately, now that \n&gt; Rodimus has been found, I&#39;ve lost my vision and this time, the only way it \n&gt; can be corrected is by hand.  Inform Lord Elder that all is well with us, \n&gt; and hopefully we&#39;ll be able to return soon also.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks up to the entrance.  She then looks to Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Wait a sec, I have an idea.  Legacy, what if we shot a cable up your way \n&gt; and you could secure it to something solid?  I bet we could start getting \n&gt; some bots out of here safely by just creating some sort of winch like \n&gt; lever.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quick Stride scratches behind one ear.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmm, that&#39;s one heck of a climb, and we dunno if there is anything \n&gt; solid that we can attatch it to.  But I suppose we don&#39;t know until \n&gt; someone gets out of this hole, right?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns his head toward Quickstride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Affirmative.  We&#39;ll just have to go by our exploration and hope for the \n&gt; best.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Watch out this rock isnt very strong&quot;said the male &quot;I&#39;ll need a bath \n&gt;&gt; &gt; after\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this...&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor Keep digging towards the surface\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As everyone climbed or stepped out of Tuscon, Legacy did the same\n&gt;&gt; also, carefully picking up Rodimus as he did so.
