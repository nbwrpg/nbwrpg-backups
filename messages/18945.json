She got a hot cup of Cybertron\n&gt; tea and went back to the bridge.  She sat back down in the captian&#39;s\n&gt; chair and watches the external monitors.  She thought about the new\n&gt; Predacon council and how things might work out for her troops.  She\n&gt; wanted them to make it through the war and find some peace in the\n&gt; crazy world.  She thought about what would happen if she and Drillbit\n&gt; finally had the chance to settle down. She chuckled quietly to\n&gt; herself at the thought of offspring.  She shook her head and checked\n&gt; the monitors again.
