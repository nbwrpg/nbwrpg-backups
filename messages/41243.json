Then \nFiredrill\n&gt; realized he didnt need an explanation, as he could hear massive\n&gt; explosions close by. All he could think was that Cliffjumper was in\n&gt; danger, as he roared around Beachcomber, and towards the danger, \nwhile\n&gt; Beachcomber yelled something about needing a plan.\n\n::REDHOT::\n\n       Redhot was horrified at the sounds of explosions and was \nimmedaitely worried for the safety of his frind. He jumped out of the \ncab of Firedrill and hovered in after him. He was grateful that he had \nsaved his energy reserves like he had. \n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n**************************\n\n\n"}}
