It was ri=\r\nsky, \nvery risky, but his resolution didn&#39;t faulter. He was a bit thankful =\r\n\nfor Iris explaining the love thing to Iron Raptor, though. He knew \nshe co=\r\nuld be stubborn, and he might have had a bit more trouble.\n\nHe nods at Iris=\r\n&#39; last comment, his core proccessor beginning to alter \nhis spark frequency=\r\n. A lighheaded feeling passes through Prowl the \nprocedure begins, but the =\r\nMaximal ignores it.\n\n&quot;Ok, I&#39;m all set,&quot; he says, picking up the monitor and=\r\n mounting Iron \nRaptor. He was nervious, but only because he might do somet=\r\nhing wrong \nand hurt Iron Raptor, not because he might not come out of this=\r\n alive.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply looked down at Iris.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You mean to=\r\n say that we have to merge sparks? But with them \nexposed like \n&gt; that they=\r\n&#39;re more vulnerable then ever. If we&#39;re attacked we could \nboth \n&gt; die!&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * Her voice was a growl but she knew that Iris would keep calm, \neven th=\r\nough \n&gt; she did know how to pull the old programs diode.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yes,=\r\n that is a possibility=85but you have to ask yourselves \nif it&#39;s \n&gt; worth t=\r\nhe risk. You could both end up dead=85or Prowl could instead \nof you=85but =\r\n\n&gt; that would mean that you would only die later on.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor gr=\r\nowled*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Thanx, just what I needed for an emotional booster=85&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nRIS: &quot; Slag with emotions, this in deadly serious, literally! You \ntwo \n&gt; r=\r\neally have to put this into consideration.\n&gt; This has only been tried once =\r\nand both parties had died in the end=85\nAFTER the \n&gt; merge had been complet=\r\ned.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked at Prowl for a moment and then back at the \n=\r\nstar in the \n&gt; cracked screen. Her voice telling her uneasiness.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Af=\r\nter?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Yes, after. The merge had been a complete success, but t=\r\nhey \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; handle the side effects=85and they both died. I couple lik=\r\ne \nyourselves too. It \n&gt; was a shame, the woman had been carrying a fetus p=\r\nrogram( the \nprogram which \n&gt; made a child). But they took the risk and pai=\r\nd the price, it was \ntheir own \n&gt; doing.&quot;\n&gt; * But then Iris turned her atte=\r\nntion towards Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Words never do sound nearly as complicat=\r\ned as the actions. \nBut in \n&gt; this case it is fairly complicated, Prowl. Yo=\r\nu have to reconfigure \nyour \n&gt; spark signature just the right way=85and you=\r\n only have one shot at \nthis. One \n&gt; wrong setting and it won&#39;t only delete=\r\n Irons spark but your own=85at \nthe \n&gt; atomic level. Which means your spark=\r\ns will simply disintegrate very=85\nvery \n&gt; slowly=85and nothing will be abl=\r\ne to stop it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris then added, replying to Prowls other comment abo=\r\nut \nrelocating.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; And a wide open area would be more suitable t=\r\nhen a wooded \nand \n&gt; penned-in area=85the shock along after merge is comple=\r\nte could level \n100 \n&gt; clicks of forest land. If all goes well=85.\n&gt; But, y=\r\nes=85we should move.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris sighed*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Now=85if you would b=\r\ne as so kind as to pick up this monitor \nand carry \n&gt; it with you, I can&#39;t =\r\ndownload myself into Iron&#39;s program until this \n&gt; procedure is complete.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; * Iron Raptor shifted uneasily, looking around at the wreckage a \nbit b=\r\nefore \n&gt; gazing back into the cracked screen.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m not sure I like t=\r\nhis. Not at all. Why drag Prowl into this \nwhen he&#39;s \n&gt; done nothing, and n=\r\now has the risk to die along with me. It&#39;&#39; not \nright.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; So=85y=\r\nou would rather die then bring him into this, even \nafter he&#39;s \n&gt; agreed to=\r\n help?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor growled*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying. =\r\nIf dying now is my fate then I&#39;m \nalright \n&gt; with that, but=85Prowl=85it&#39;s =\r\nnot even near his time and I couldn&#39;t \nhandle \n&gt; knowing that it was becaus=\r\ne of me if he died.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; It&#39;s all part of love. Dying for each oth=\r\ner. Some may view \nit as \n&gt; foolish and others may see it as the symbol of =\r\ntrue love. There \nhave been \n&gt; people and bots alike who have lost one they=\r\n&#39;ve loved but stayed \nwith them \n&gt; still=85even after death. Laid by the si=\r\nde of the long dead corps=85all \nfor \n&gt; love.\n&gt; This is no different. Every=\r\none has their own way of expressing \nlove, \n&gt; flowers, poems, songs, laying=\r\n beside the corps of their loved one=85\nbut this \n&gt; is his way of expressin=\r\ng it, Iron. Dying for you would probably be \nhis \n&gt; sparks greatest joy, ex=\r\npressing it to the fullest. Just as concern \nis yours.\n&gt; Besides, I&#39;m sure =\r\nthat if roles were reversed YOU would be the one \nputting \n&gt; your spark on =\r\nthe line.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor simply nodded in agreement, knowing that Iris=\r\n was \nright. But \n&gt; how in the Pit did this program get so damned smart?!\n&gt;=\r\n She looked down at the star.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So=85where&#39;s the perfect place to pul=\r\nl this trip off?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Exactly 200 clicks south from this destinati=\r\non=85about half a \ndays \n&gt; ride. If we left now we should be there by=85ear=\r\nly evening tomorrow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor cringed and felt her shoulder thro=\r\nb: Ride? Great!\n&gt; She looked over towards Prowl and then at Iris again, sim=\r\nply \nwaiting now for \n&gt; when the both of them were ready.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; And=\r\n Prowl? About that reconfiguration of the signature=85it \nhas to be \n&gt; righ=\r\nt on 603.5117, and it might take a while for you to set it just \nright so \n=\r\n&gt; I suggest you begin now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * So, now Iris was ready, and also incline=\r\nd to answer any questions \nanyone \n&gt; might have.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n________________=\r\n______________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Priva=\r\nte, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share inf=\r\normation about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profil=\r\nes.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
