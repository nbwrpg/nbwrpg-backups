Just scared like 20 groups of kids, a few of them almost to\n&gt; tears! No kidding, either.\n&gt;\n&gt; Group of 15 year olds came up the driveway, laughed at our traps,\n&gt; called us suckers, reached into the candy box.... And screamed their\n&gt; heads off when their arms were grabbed! Well worth it, yessss....\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably a bit childish, but who cares?\n&gt;\n&gt; Have a great halloween everyone!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
