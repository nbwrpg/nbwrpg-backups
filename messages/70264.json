He did not like it but he \n&gt; understood why Rodimus had to send him away.  This made him overheat with \n&gt; anger as he makes it perfectly clear to Jhiaxus and the others that he was \n&gt; not about to take any of their scrap parked in an idol position!  Yet, he \n&gt; does as instructed and is lead to Perceptor via his thermal sensory board. \n&gt; Night Shift helps him to navigate through the tunnels as they quickly \n&gt; reach Perceptor.  Night Shift flings open his left door to allow Perceptor \n&gt; to ride in his cab.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, you did help us, now it&#39;s our turn ta return that favor. We&#39;re \n&gt; gettn&#39; outa here, but we ain&#39;t gonna leave ya down here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime helps to gently put Windlord and Nightlight inside Night \n&gt; Shift&#39;s back seats.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;ll do as Rodimus says.  Everyone gets out, even you Perceptor.  Night \n&gt; Shift is right, you helped us, now we help you.  Nightshift, get into my \n&gt; trailer once everyone is aboard.  I have a feeling that the ride will be \n&gt; rough and I am more equipped to deal with rough roads than you are.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Umm, hey, I got four wheel drive too, no sweat.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know but this may be more than your system can handle.  I don&#39;t want \n&gt; to risk anyone&#39;s saftey over something that could have been prevented. \n&gt; Now, as soon as we&#39;re all out safely, Night Shift, you take Windlord, \n&gt; Nightlight and Perceptor and make a B line for the Ark. I&#39;ll remain \n&gt; behind.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift knew there wasn&#39;t anything Tucson Prime could do.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Uh, uh, I think Rodimus told ya to go back for a good reason Sir.  Maybe \n&gt; it&#39;s time, ya know?  New era, new Prime?  You&#39;re it now Tucson Prime, \n&gt; you&#39;re gonna be our new hope for a better future.  And you&#39;re already don&#39; \n&gt; that.  Ohh yeah, you&#39;re gonna be a legend, and I think Rodimus knows it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson Prime pauses for a moment, and then understands what Night Shift \n&gt; was telling him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I just didn&#39;t think it would happen this soon Night Shift.  You&#39;re \n&gt; right.  We&#39;ll all leave together and get everyone back to the Ark.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In another part of the tunnel system, Quick Stride, who was full of \n&gt; determination to get at Deepstryke and the other seekers, falls for the \n&gt; lure, as Rat Trap tries desperately to go after him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wait, I smell a rat, and it&#39;s not me!  Don&#39;t fall for it Quickstride! \n&gt; IT&#39;S A TRAP!

A lot of it if not all of it, \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actually my fault. The day we fought off Hydras&#39;s lackies two years \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ago,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I had managed to deal with the ones I was fighting against and saw \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you, Nightlight and Windlord were in desperate need of help. So I went \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fast as I could, to try and divert enemy fire away from you, but I \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; failed\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to check a blind spot in my rear view mirror, and I was shot from \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; behind,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rendering me inoperable and blind. If I had just taken more careful\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; survey of what was around me, none of this, including what happened to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you, would never have happened. Now, now is the time to make it up to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you. We&#39;ll fight them together. Scorponok doesn&#39;t scare me, none of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do. All right Jhiaxus, don&#39;t expect me to make this easy for you \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not! As I&#39;ve said to Scorponok before, I will not fold to any of \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no matter what damages you instill on me!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus almost smiled as Tuscon tried so hard to take the blame, or at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; least some of it. He shook his head slightly, &quot;Because you didn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; check a blind spot all of this happened?&quot; Rodimus turned to look back\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at the oncoming Decepticons, &quot;No, no one can say that. I have my own\n&gt;&gt; &gt; blame to bear, but this time I will bear it rather than trying to . .\n&gt;&gt; &gt; . &quot; Rodimus&#39; voice stopped mid sentence as he struggled with something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; inside his head!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jhaxius smiled as he, Cyclonus and Scourge walked foward, Cyclonus&#39;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; strides quickly bring him to the fore. &quot;Did you think we did not have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this in mind?&quot; Cyclonus said. &quot;Rodimus, as long as he lives will still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; belong to Hydras!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Behind Cyclonus, Jhiaxus was holding a device, a miniature version of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what was used originally to change Windlord and Rodimus into the evil\n&gt;&gt; &gt; versions of themselves.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes.&quot; Jhiaxus said, &quot;The original program had gone dormant but still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remained. It was only a matter of bringing the software back online.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus shook his head as he mouthed the word, &#39;NO&#39;. He held his head\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and fell to his knees, his palms against his ears as if he were trying\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to block out voices that he was hearing.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scorponok chuckled as he resumed his robot mode and he and Scourge\n&gt;&gt; &gt; brought up the rear, &quot;Yes Brother.&quot; Scorponok said to Rodimus, &quot;Come\n&gt;&gt; &gt; back to us, we need you.&quot; his voice sarcastic and condescending.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; armor slowly began to blacken again and then shift red as if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on fire. He glanced over at Tuscon, his optics still the amber of his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Autobot upbringing, &quot;Get Nightlight . . . all of them out of here!&quot; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said, his voice hoarse and intense, &quot;This must stop here, now!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus glanced at a message that he received from Perceptor . .  .\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;6 cycles - P.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus smiled as his armor shifted black again, &quot;Yes brother I hear\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you.&quot; Rodimus said as he began to walk forward. Behind his back he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; motion to Tuscon to go, &quot;GO!&quot; he said fiercely.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus stopped near the device that Perceptor had planted, shielding\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it from the view of the Decepticons, &quot;Come &#39;brothers&#39;&quot; he said, &quot;We\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can end all this here and now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
