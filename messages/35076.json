Grounded transforms to robot mode and touches\nhis arm to the ground. Concentrating very hard his arm glows green.\nVines begin to shoot up out of the ground and begins to grow around\nthe shield.  Soon all that would be visible would be a alrge dome made\nof vines that would be 4 feet thick and very dense. HE stays there\noutside his arm pulsing with energy and vines growing.\n\n\n"}}
