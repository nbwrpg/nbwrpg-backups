But I do have a more logical solution, if \nyou\n&gt; &gt; care to listen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon listened to Zardus&#39; comments about the logic of his actions, \nthe\n&gt; battle seemed to be going his way so it seemed logical for Zardus \nto try to\n&gt; find a safe way out. &quot;I&#39;m a sensible bot, I&#39;m always interested in \nhearing\n&gt; logical sollutions.&quot; He replied to the tyrant aboard the Iron Fist.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK Yan, you must be in the Balearic islands (For reference sake.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The turret from the Alliance ship strikes the coast with devastating\n&gt; results. a cloud of dust and sand fills the air blocking Prebons \npoint of\n&gt; view. &quot;By the pit what have you done?&quot; Prebon shouted through the \nnoise of\n&gt; the explosion. Prebon had designed the attack as a recon assault to \nlearn\n&gt; more about the Iron fists defenses, he hadn&#39;t imagined that it&#39;s \nmain\n&gt; weapons were still operational. this threw a new twist on the whole \nwar.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the smoke cleared there was nothing left of the beach except \nash. he\n&gt; tried to raise the others over the comm but only found three active \nsignals.\n&gt; (Blaze, Ignatius and if you like Slayer.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fenox spins out of the way of the missiles, firing several shots \nback\n&gt; &gt; at them to make sure they didn&#39;t come back around. She looked \nahead,\n&gt; &gt; two shots from Blaze slamming into her left shoulder. Diving down,\n&gt; &gt; she flies under Blaze, firing up at the bot as the shore below \nthem\n&gt; &gt; is destroyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The shots hit Blaze, damaging her flightpack. the shockwave from \nthe blast\n&gt; did the rest. She plummeted to the ground crashing harder than a \nDelta jet.\n&gt; Her body was torn with cuts and dents from the beating she&#39;d taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaze voice came through a static filled channel. &quot;Prebon, what did \nyou lead\n&gt; us into?&quot; It was rare to hear such tone from his troops, The female \nhad used\n&gt; his name without a title before it. The chain of command was \nfalling around\n&gt; him,(Or is that fallout?) The Trainers commander was no longer in \ncontrol of\n&gt; his troops fate.\n&gt; \n&gt; The new shoreline was smoking with residual energy when a hand \nwashed up on\n&gt; it, It was Hammers, the proud warrior had fallen to a superior \nforce. His\n&gt; spark may have survived but if it had it was buried somewhere in the\n&gt; aftermath of the devastation. (Hammer is dead)\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullet&#39;s battle scarred frame lay a few miles inward from where the \nblast\n&gt; had hit, He lay in Stasis lock with holes through him that made him \nresemble\n&gt; swiss cheese. One leg was broken, the other was in pieces scattered \nfrom the\n&gt; focal point to the landing point. his arms were slung about like a \npuppet\n&gt; after the strings were cut. His face resembled the aftermath of a \nMike Tyson\n&gt; fight, his left eye was melted shut, right eye hanging by a wire. \nNose was\n&gt; dented inward from the force of the blast. his jaw had been broken \nopen and\n&gt; half fallen off. One ear was still intact while the other looked as \nif\n&gt; someone had taken a bite out of it.(Completing the Tyson reference.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Havoc fires two more missiles at Bullet. Even though he couldn&#39;t \nsee\n&gt; &gt; him, he could easily pick him up with the scanners\n&gt; \n&gt; The missles entered the cloud of debris and exploded.(Whether they \nhit or\n&gt; not seems pointless after the previous paragraph.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Iron Fist continues to fire its defences, missile launchers \nand\n&gt; &gt; laser bolts streaming out toward the trainers, a missile toward \neach\n&gt; &gt; one, along with a dozen or so bolts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius is struck by a series of bolts sending him tumbling into \nthe sea,\n&gt; his wings were broken so he couldn&#39;t fly and transforming was \npointless. He\n&gt; remained fully awair of the world around him as he tailspinned to \nwhat could\n&gt; be a wattery grave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Missles and bolts struck all around the Trainers leader as he \nscrambled for\n&gt; any cover he could find. He had been thoroughly seperated from his \nteam and\n&gt; that was the only fact that had kept him functional.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 29, 2000 8:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: attacking the alliance\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Allrighty, so your troops are on the beach three miles away?

Zardus \ntaps\n&gt; &gt; a few buttons on his wrist comp.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Recieving several commands from Zardus&#39;s wrist comp, the Iron Fist\n&gt; &gt; activates its main cannon. A panel slides aside on the top of it, \nand\n&gt; &gt; a mean looking large cannon slides out. It aims at the shore of\n&gt; &gt; Spain, three miles away, where most of the attackers were.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A wide glowing beam emerges from the cannon, making its way with\n&gt; &gt; great speed toward the beach. It hits land in three seconds, with\n&gt; &gt; more energy than it had used last time during its demonstration of\n&gt; &gt; destroying a whole mountain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The shockwave from the blast reaches even the Alliance base, \nalthough\n&gt; &gt; the cannon was designed not to leave a big shockwave. Water rushes\n&gt; &gt; into the beach, which was now little more than smoking rocks. \nHissing\n&gt; &gt; and steam rise up as cold water hits the rocks, making the area\n&gt; &gt; completely impossible to see through, although the Iron Fist&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; scanners were not affected by the water. The beach was destroyed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Iron Fist continues to fire its defences, missile launchers \nand\n&gt; &gt; laser bolts streaming out toward the trainers, a missile toward \neach\n&gt; &gt; one, along with a dozen or so bolts.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Havoc stares in surprise as the Iron Fist destroys the shore of\n&gt; &gt; Spain. Several shots hit the shields in front of him, reminding \nhim\n&gt; &gt; that he was in a battle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Havoc fires two more missiles at Bullet. Even though he couldn&#39;t \nsee\n&gt; &gt; him, he could easily pick him up with the scanners.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Astral yelps as the beach that he was flying over is destroyed. He\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t see the shots, and two of them slam into his leg. He \ngrowls,\n&gt; &gt; flying upward and waiting till he could see again.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Fenox spins out of the way of the missiles, firing several shots \nback\n&gt; &gt; at them to make sure they didn&#39;t come back around. She looked \nahead,\n&gt; &gt; two shots from Blaze slamming into her left shoulder. Diving down,\n&gt; &gt; she flies under Blaze, firing up at the bot as the shore below \nthem\n&gt; &gt; is destroyed.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Starlight dived out of the way, the bolt from Bullet grazing her \nback\n&gt; &gt; and leaving a wide scorch mark on it. She growls, taking out her\n&gt; &gt; charge launcher and firing two charges at Bullet. The charges \nlock on\n&gt; &gt; magnetically, zooming through the air to their target.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Slayer erupts from the water, a mad-looking Recklessa flying after\n&gt; &gt; him seconds later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m perfectly fine,&quot; he replies, spinning in the air to \navoid a\n&gt; &gt; missile from Recklessa.
