Swordance \nDID look like a cockroach! Rion started thinking back, about all the times \nDiana had tried to get Swordance to teach her the combat skills he was \nsupposed to learn. Sometimes the instructor did, and other times Swordance \nwould start yelling in some old language only she seemed to know. Rion \nreally couldn&#39;t remember what she looked like, only that she limped. That \nwas why she was an instructor instead of a general. Well, that was what \nSwordance had told him when Rion asked.\n\nRion laughed a little when Diana made the hand motions. She never did like \nspiders! Right now though, thinking about Swordance, he really had begun to \nwonder... where they all alone here? But he wouldn&#39;t tell Diana that, nuh \nuh. Rion shook his head, as if to reasure himself. Everything was fine, and \nhe knew it.\n\nRion followed Diana up the sandbank. There really was nothing! Well, they \nhad to pick some direction, and he knew there was nothing to the east, where \nhe had come from, and nothing to the west, where Diana had been:\n\n&quot;We may as well go that way!&quot;\n\nRion pointed to the North and waited for Diana to say something.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
