Currently fall apart? This was serious.\nIf that ship managed to cave in it might destroy the time continuum. Even though it wouldn�t wipe her out she was sure that Prowl would be destroyed, something that she would never want.\nIron Raptor sighed and leaned away from Prowl slightly, looking into his optics with love. But she knew that duty call again, it was time to answer that call.\nShe smiled at him with warmth as she stroked his neck one last time, then sliding her hands to his chest and leaving them there.\nFeeling his arms tighten around her she stepped closer to him, seeing the undying love in his eyes and returning it with a look of her own. *\n\n� I think we should, we wouldn�t want to keep them waiting.�\n\n* Suddenly Prowl seemed to begin to fade out, her love for him still in her optics but a look of worry as well.\nWhat was happening to him?\nShe looked around franticly, could this be some Predacon trick or something?\nIt was then that she felt his kiss, but it was also then that he disappeared.\nIt must be one of those times when he simply disappeared, reappearing in a few days like he had said before kissing her.\nShe always wondered where he went or just what happened, maybe he would tell her one day.\nWith a sigh she turned towards the exit of the CR room and began walking towards it. Still a little worry in her about Prowl, but he could look after himself.\nBut now she had to meet Brooder and Archangel in the Conference Room.\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
