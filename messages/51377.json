Sooner or later your running off is \ngoing to get someone scrapped.&quot;\n\nJayde shakes her head as the memory of the battle comes back to her.\n &quot;Hoo boy, am I gonna catch it or what.&quot;\n\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;\n\nVindicator - Bridge::\n\n*Seven Autobots are at their stations, ready for anything - or so they \nthink.*\n\nPipes: Damage report - what did that wormhole do to us?\n\nPowerglide: Shields took it on the chin, sir; it could take megacycles \nto get &#39;em back online.

The Predacons were indeed at it again.\n&gt; \n&gt; The next scanner alert triggers memories. &lt;...Vindicator...&gt; She \n&gt; thinks, then shudders slightly. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes Devilcat.&quot; Noir recovering and then quickly slides into a chair \n&gt; on the side of the room, and begins tapping some buttons on the \n&gt; console panel. Outside the Rogue Star, two identical panels open up \n&gt; on both sides of the ship. After the sliding panels had completely \n&gt; opened up, four ground to orbit LRM launchers rise up from the \nopened \n&gt; compartments. The launchers swivel around, and aim themselves along \na \n&gt; trajectory to intercept the Vindicator.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the 3d visual display at the front of the control room, the \n&gt; trajectory is shown and a lock has been established on the enemy \nship.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lock established Commander. Ready to launch at your command.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ooC: Cardhead, feel free to control Noir for the next few days if \nyou \n&gt; need too. (like for example if Noir is supposed to fire, the make \nher \n&gt; fire the missiles.)\n\n\n"}}
