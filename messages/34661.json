He notes that his next target source of \nenergy is the event horizon of a distant black hole. His thoughts \ndrift to the nearest Ikoto to him, Brodak, who stirs from his semi-\neternal feasting. &quot;Azafroth, this bores me,&quot; He breakes off from the \nenergy source, having sated himself enough for now. &quot;We will find \nsomething---&quot; he pauses to consider something, &quot;something more \ninteresting, perhaps the destruction of a planet,&quot; Azafroth&#39;s non-\nexistent eyes flare up, &quot;Ha, a suitable idea... Uokarase, what is \nyour input on this idea?&quot; The two direct their attentions to \nanother... thing feasting off the quasar. Uokarase breaks off from \nthe source to join the others in thought. &quot;I find the idea amusing, \nhow shall we go about it?&quot; Azafroth&#39;s translucent body shimmers \nmultiple colours, &quot;I have an idea. The Vok.&quot; he says simply, &quot;We \nshall dally with them. I know that they have at least one planet \nunder their control, or they attempt to dominate it. We will propose \nto them a sort of gamble on the outcome of that planet. We \npropose a bet that a group of out pawns will attempt to over thrown \nthe Vok&#39;s pawns and control the planet. If this happens we will \ncause a chain reaction explosion of the planet and,&quot; Azafroth \nalmost flickers with delight as the others listen, &quot;and we will use \nthe energy from the explosion as a charger for our bodies, much \nbetter than stupid quasars.&quot; He finishes and has left the other Ikoto \nflickering as well. Brodak and Uokarase both immediately agree, \nand they begin periodic teleporations to find the Vok.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt an indeterminable time later, the three Ikoto have traveled far, to \nan indeterminable location of energizing beauty. Azafroth projects a \nsummoning though to any nearby Vok for communication. &quot;I have \nsent out a summoning emphatic and telepathing message to all \nVok with in my range (which is large), as you have just witnessed.&quot; \nAll three beings away a response with certainty.\n\n"}}
