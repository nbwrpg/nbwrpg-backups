The only way he would know for sure =\r\nis if Dark Rodimus&#39;s spark chamber gets knocked open during the fight.  In =\r\norder to do that I was wondering if you would allow Tucson to get in a few =\r\ngood hits as he too can take a few of his own.  I fully allow for Tucson to=\r\n take a beating and I was wondering if you would allow the same for Dark Ro=\r\ndimus.  And you get to chose which mode they fight in.   \n\nAlso , whoever e=\r\nlse he&#39;s put up against, which could very well be a fellow comrade, he will=\r\n explain his strategy via silent com and inform them that he&#39;s playing the =\r\npart to be strategic.   He has to make it look real if he is going to attem=\r\npt to fool Magmatron, which is going to be an ulitimate challenge of wisdom=\r\n.  When you can&#39;t beat them you can at least act as if you&#39;re going to join=\r\n them.  And all is well if you can pull off the deception carefully.  Tucso=\r\nn realizes he can not defeat Magmatron in a one on one but, he can find a w=\r\nay around him.  He will definitely gather troops on all sides for the fight=\r\n against Magmatron, including the Preds and Decepticons who are also annoye=\r\nd with Magmatron.  I will send Airly a message about that and see what she =\r\nthinks, but only after I hear from you.  That&#39;s it for now.  Happy writing.=\r\n  ^^\n\n\n"}}
