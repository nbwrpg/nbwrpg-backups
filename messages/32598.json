Its faster, more reliable, and you don&#39;t have to rely on your\nemail that way. Here&#39;s how you do it:\n\n1. First, get a Yahoo ID, or if you have one, make sure you know the\nID and pass.\n2. Goto http://groups.yahoo.com/convwiz , fill out your email address\nand eGroups password (if you don&#39;t know the egroups password, fill out\nthe &quot;forgot password&quot; thing and they&#39;ll email you a reactivation\nnumber which you can use to change your pass from the site. After you\nfill out your email and pass, it&#39;ll ask you for your Yahoo ID and the\npassword for it, and you fill that out too. Follow whatever additional\ninstructions it throws at you, and you should have your email linked\nto your ID.\n3. Log into your email through eGroups at\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/login.cgi .\n4. There should be a link called NBWRPG on the left side of the page\nyou get after logging in, under the &quot;My Groups&quot; section. Click on it.\n5. When the main eGroups page for NBW loads up, click on the\n&quot;Messages&quot; link to the left. You can read messages and reply to them\nfrom the site, as well as start new posts, and vote in the polls.\n\nYou can also skip steps 4 and 5 by going straight to\nhttp://egroups.com/messages/nbwrpg\n\n\nAn alternate solution is to just wait for the mail server to get\nbetter, which can take quite a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Jer wanted me to ask ppl what &quot;email is bouncing messages&quot; \n&gt; mean because he can&#39;t post (again) due to that error, and he  \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know how to solve it. Anyone have any input?\n\n\n"}}
