With such heavy damages to \n&gt; essential circuits, he started wondering how he managed not to hurt \n&gt; anyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same moment, he saw Ragnar&#39;s towering form enter the lounge \nhe \n&gt; was in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: So, guys, this is the lounge, from what I make of the map. \n&gt; Your personnal quarters are on the right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: There is also an energon distributor at the end of the \nleft \n&gt; hallway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar turned at Blackfang and studied him. He was an ugly looking \n&gt; bot, but he also had a sense of nobility emanating from him. He \n&gt; reminded him a bit of Trent, the Smoke Jaguar Mechwarrior who \nbetrayed \n&gt; his Clan because of his convictions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: You are Blackfang, quiaff?\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Yeah, that&#39;s me. Ragnar, right? And who are your friends?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: This is Windlord and Aerotaur. They are new warriors here. \n(He \n&gt; stopped a moment) Perhaps you can help me. I have been here only \nfor a \n&gt; short time, and since I am not of Robotic origins, I know not what \nwe \n&gt; fight for. Maybe you can brief me, quiaff?\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang grinned: Why not? Alright, we are maximals. Our main \nenemies \n&gt; here are the Predacons, who&#39;re some kind of criminals here. Their \nboss \n&gt; has a notoriety for dangerous scheming. However, there are some \nother \n&gt; groups that just popped up since we came here. We may have to deal \n&gt; with&#39;em too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar: I thank you, Blackfang.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
