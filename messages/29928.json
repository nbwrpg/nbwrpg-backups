He was\nconfused and made a mental note to ask Veratis what had happened. Somehow he\nknew that he still had his raptor mode but didn&#39;t want to waste the\nopportunity to learn about his new form.\n\nA little outside Maximal scanners the chat between Lunarpine and Megaton\ncontinued, Megaton sensed Lunarpines lothing.\n\n&quot;You fear my size?&quot; The dragon spread his wings again, stretching them to\nthe peak of thier width. &quot;Maybe I can make you feal more comfortable.&quot; He\nquickly transformed to his warped robot/ T-rex/ Dragon form shrinking down.\nEven in this mode he was about 4 feet taller than Lunarpine and still fealt\nsuperior.\n\nLunarpine stood up straight as he could trying pathetically to look bigger\nthan he was. &quot;I&#39;ve beaten bigger bots than you.&quot;The wolfbot boasted\nattempting to impress the other bot.\n\nMegaton raised his T-rex legs to full extension making him 18- 19 feet. This\nseverely limited his mobility and coordination but the cocky mutant was sure\nhe could recover fast enough to destroy the smaller bot before any serious\ndamage was done.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Logo morph &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2001 8:10 AM\nSubject: Reclaiming my chars.\n\n\n&gt; ::DarkMouse::\n&gt; In her room in the base, she stretched her arms and yawned. &quot;Oh boy,\nanother\n&gt; day, another computer problem to fix.
