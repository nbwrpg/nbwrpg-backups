The recording played and stopped him. \nIt also allowed Magmatron a way into Bobertron&#39;s mind. (Much like Black \nArachnia and Trantulas link in the show) But he didn&#39;t have time for that \nnow, he had more important things to do.\n    He took a step forward. The figure looked at him and frowned.\n    &quot;You haven&#39;t completed my goals yet,&quot; The image said. &quot;You must soon, I \nwill be soon free from my prison.&quot;\n    &quot;Yes, my master, I will do as you command. But there are many \nTransformers on this planet. I cannot destroy them all and keep the time line \nin order.&quot; Magmatron said. His demeanor had changed very much, whereas on his \nship and almost everywhere else he was fearless and in total control. Here he \nwas in terror.\n    &quot;Then change the course of time if you must, anything to let Cybertron be \nmine.&quot; The figure said. &quot;You appear to be different.&quot;\n    &quot;I have assumed a beast mode and a new name. Here I am known as \nMagmatron.&quot; He said.\n    &quot;Judge, I will make you into a more powerful transformer, you must do \nwhatever is nessary to assure my victory this time. I do not wish to be \nstopped by Matrix. Do what you must do.&quot; He said. \n    A light emitted from the stone wall, Magmatron was taken into it. He saw \nhis controller. He flew closer to him. A red light emitted from the center of \nhis master. He started to change Magmatron into a more powerful form. His \nthree beast mode form was merged into the more powerful form of the Drake. \n(Drake is a sea based Dragon, they love water) He was sent through Space back \nto prehistoric Earth. Everything was clear to him now.\n\n    (Just so everybody knows Magmatron is back, but his trip took very long, \nso you won&#39;t be hearing from him for a while. And please E-mail if you guys \nfigured out who Magmatron was talking to. I gave many hints here in this \npost.)\n\n"}}
