Not your guys&#39; fault that =\r\nI don&#39;t know\n&gt; my Transformers, nor is it your fault that I had other expec=\r\ntations. \n&gt; However, as a suggestion I wouldn&#39;t make it a habit of letting =\r\nposts\n&gt; go blatantly ignored for so long, especially when it comes to\n&gt; new=\r\ncomers who don&#39;t know what the heck they&#39;re doing ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to writ=\r\ne out Shard, or kill him off.  I&#39;ll just delete my\n&gt; Maul post since it wen=\r\nt unanswered and won&#39;t be missed. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to thank Cyclonus for his =\r\nhelp; I wouldn&#39;t have even made it\n&gt; this far without him, and I enjoyed th=\r\ne interaction with Myrmidon\n&gt; while it lasted.  :)  Good luck to you all!\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
