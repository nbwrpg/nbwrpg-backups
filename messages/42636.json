She had been on the planet\n&gt; since the arrival of the first transformers. Her maximal form had\n&gt; been suspended in a half bot, half artic fox mode.  Her proccesses in\n&gt; becoming a maximal had only been half complete. The change proccesses\n&gt; had not been able to finish the transformation. Her bot form looked\n&gt; more like a rotting corpse with animal pelt hanging off it than a\n&gt; what it was intended to look like. And untill now, her pod had been\n&gt; buried under tons of snow and ice. Now, for the first time, the ice\n&gt; was giving way.  CRASH!  A large chunk of ice broke off from the\n&gt; glacier and fell into the cold sea of the north pole. Her pod, still\n&gt; entombed in the ice, floated along as part of a very large iceberg.\n&gt; Drifting lazily with the sea&#39;s currents, the pod&#39;s distress becon\n&gt; beeped on. Extremely faint, but the becon could be picked up if the\n&gt; bot were only a few miles away.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
