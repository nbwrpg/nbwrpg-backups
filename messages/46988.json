Also, this \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; a space station, and at this time of the night, lights were \nusually \n&gt; &gt; not all bright and sparkle. The other reason was because the \n&gt; commander \n&gt; &gt; of the base considered it shook claustrophobia out of his troops.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The commander was a huge robot. He was the leader of the \nQuasacons, \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; highly recognized Sadisticon unit in the Predacon ranks. He held \n&gt; them \n&gt; &gt; with an iron grip and would never accept their disobeyance. \nHowever, \n&gt; &gt; he left them sufficient space to give their ideas and express \n&gt; &gt; themselves. He was a tough commander, not a tyrant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warhead: All Quasacons meet up on the bridge.
