The propulsion units is what took the heaviest\ndamage in the crash landing of this ship, and what will require the\nmost work, it will require signifigant resources.&quot;\n\nAs Hydras and CYCLONUS enter the hanger bay DEEPSTRYKE strightened.\n&quot;Attention!&quot; he called out as the rest of Hydras&#39; troops also\nstrightened and presented themsleves for his inspection.\n\n&quot;Troops ready for inspection sir!&#39; DEEPSTRYKE called out to HYDRAS as\nhe saluted both HYDRAS and CYCLONUS.\n\nBehind DEEPSTRYKE stood the other members of HYDRAS&#39; troops,\nBLACKRAZOR, PHOBIA, INSECTICON, BRUTICUS-X, IGUANUS, TARANTULUS,\nFRACTYL, INFERNO, SKYSHADOW, INJECTOR, BUZZCLAW, TERRORGATOR,\nQUICKSTRIKE and WASPINATOR. The oly ones that were missing were\nSCOURGE who was in the security section watching over the ship, and a\nfew sweeps who were flying perimter watches outside and lastly\nTERRORSAUR was still missing.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
