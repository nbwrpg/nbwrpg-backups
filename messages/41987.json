She stands 5 foot tall in bot \nform and has a black panther maximal form.  She&#39;s a scout and a recon \nsoldier. Currently, she&#39;s just landed and I can&#39;t think of where to \nplace her since I heard that the planet was reformated and I  have no \nclue as to where the continents are or any of the bases.  So, I will \nneed some help as far as getting her to a maximal base at this point. \n\nPanzer fell down somewhere in a mountain range in Europe somewhere. I \nknow it&#39;s vague, but it&#39;s the best I can do untill I get the rest \nfigured out.  BTW, I&#39;ll just stick with two chars for a while. I \ndon&#39;t think I can handle much more than that right now. Thanx.\n\nLogo.\n\n\n"}}
