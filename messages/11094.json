She saw no \nground below her. She felt peace and calm.  She looked and didn&#39;t see \nher body, but felt only her mind.  She saw a great glowing sphere.  \nShe floated over towards it.  She looked at it. It pulsed with light \nand energy.  &quot;Where am I?&quot; the sphere spoke to her,&quot;You are in the \ngreat void. I am the Matrix.&quot;\n\nShe looked at the sphere, &quot;I&quot;m dead?&quot;\n\nThe sphere spoke, &quot;Yes, but I am returning you back to the land of \nthe living.&quot;\n\n&quot;WHy must I go back?&quot;\n\n&quot;You must go back and keep the balance of good and evil.&quot;\n\nShe felt herself being pushed back.

Aracnia was mournful because Darkmouse was a great \nsoldier, if \n&gt; not, in some strange and morbid way, her only friend left after the \ndeparture \n&gt; of Hell Beast and her old crew.\n&gt;     In the lab, Hell Beasts old lab, Aracnia hoped to bring \nDarkmouse back to \n&gt; life. He left a large amount of Liquid Energon behinde and Aracnia \ntended to \n&gt; drain her mech and replace it with the powerful fluid. If it \nworked, \n&gt; Darkmouse would be very energenic. She would most likely have a \nboost in \n&gt; strength, size, and intelligence. It was risky, but she needed \nDarkmouse.\n&gt;     Alone, with the body, Aracnia inserted one tube into her left \narm that \n&gt; would pump out the Mech, and placed a tube in her right arm that \nwould pump \n&gt; in the Liquid Energon. In any even, they would know if she would \nrise agian \n&gt; in an hour or so.\n\n\n"}}
