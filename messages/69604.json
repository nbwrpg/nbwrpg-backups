It had co=\r\nme out like the wisper of a wandering spirit.  Just as well. He now felt th=\r\nat it wasn&#39;t the moment to make a definite move.  And to top things off, hi=\r\ns foot was now begining to hurt him.  He would walk, stop for a moment and =\r\nslowly begin walking again, but with a little bit of a limp.  He frowns at =\r\nthis, knowing that at that rate, it would take him a light year to reach Ro=\r\ndimus.  Yet he also knew that if he transformed, someone would pick up on t=\r\nhe sound of his engine.\n\n&quot; Nope, I&#39;m gonna grin and bear the pain.  Now, wh=\r\nich way?&quot;  \n\nBefore he continues, he could feel tiny vibrations on the floo=\r\nr by his feet.  Being blind he could now see with his sense of hearing, and=\r\n his sense of touch.  Someone was mobilizing, someone now knew he was there=\r\n.\n\n&quot; I should have expected things wouldn&#39;t be easy for too long.. All righ=\r\nt, time to put in some of Prowl&#39;s training to good use.&quot;  \n\nHe concentrates=\r\n for a moment, and then realizes that his sonar system could actually cloak=\r\n his own energy signatures and residual heat signatures as well.  It would =\r\nmean they wouldn&#39;t be open for echo location but, it was a risk he needed t=\r\no take, and takes it quickly. He was now relying on his audio sensors and h=\r\nis sense of touch to guide him further.  This also meant that he couldn&#39;t u=\r\nse his system to locate Rodimus either.  He had to go on old information ju=\r\nst gathered moments ago and hope that he was still in the same location whe=\r\nre he had picked up on the signal.  A computer acts like an internal GPS wi=\r\nthin his directory.  It blips when he comes to a corner of a wall, or a doo=\r\nrway.\n\n&quot; When in doubt, give something up to save your aft.&quot;  \n\nYet, with a=\r\nll his precautions, he fails to notice that the wound on his foot was leaki=\r\nng lubricants.

Cyclonus better be ready, T=\r\nucson isn&#39;t one to give up too quickly. \n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; The drive to succee=\r\nd, it was now surging rapidly through Tucson&#39;s pistons and fuel injectors. =\r\nHe wasn&#39;t about to let a little pot hole get in the way of him reaching his=\r\n leader who he now believed was POW and held under demonic control. Reachin=\r\ng speeds of well over one twenty MPH he kicks up dust beneath his tires and=\r\n handles the roughness of the terrain as if it were as smooth as newly laid=\r\n down asphault. His sonar systems now pick up the density and size of the d=\r\nark tower which drives him forward, not to mention the fact that he could p=\r\nick up heat signatures which resembled his own. He knew. Rodimus was there,=\r\n and no doubt he&#39;d be there with some familliar enemies. The thought of Dec=\r\nepticons being involved in this enrages him even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; He thinks thing=\r\ns through while driving toward the tower, where he could sense Rodimus&#39;s he=\r\nat signatures.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; How could I have let this happen? If I hadn&#39;t let my =\r\nguard down the first time, and gotten myself shot, you wouldn&#39;t be in this =\r\nmess Rodimus. I promise you this though, this time, I will bring you back, =\r\nand I will not abandon you. No matter how hateful you are of me, no matter =\r\nhow badly you want to destroy me. My spark is dedicated to those I care dee=\r\nply for. That part of me will never die. I will also make those who are res=\r\nponsible for what they have done to you, pay for what they did. They had no=\r\n right taking your spark and your soul. I swear by the name of Primus that =\r\nI will risk my own spark to see yours safely out of harm&#39;s way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He wa=\r\ns now nearing the tower. Another familliar signature pings loudly in his so=\r\nnar system. He could tell by the frequency that it was from a Decepticon. H=\r\ne could also identify the carrier.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cyclonus... Ohh yeah, this definit=\r\nely has your name writen all over it. Right, well, enjoy the party while it=\r\n lasts because I&#39;m about to crash it... Literally.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He senses he&#39;s onl=\r\ny a few feet from the tower, and transforms. Yet, he keeps hidden. He knew =\r\nthat an all out attack wasn&#39;t the best way to go. If he was going to succee=\r\nd in this mission, he&#39;d have to do it without being seen and right undernea=\r\nth Cyclonus&#39;s nose. He was good at staying out of the sight of the enemy. N=\r\not only had he trained with Kup, but also trained with Prowl. Silence was h=\r\nis middle name. He sends a low powered sonar wave to see if it picks up any=\r\nthing. In the general area he was clear of incombants. He knew that if he t=\r\nouched the tower there could be an alarm system. He scans for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;H=\r\nmm... Just in case, I should activate a scrambling wave. That should quiet =\r\nany security system that could be active here.. I hope.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He waits a go=\r\nod five minuts or so until he&#39;s sure that the system is disabled. Once he r=\r\nuns a scan of his sonar systems, he concludes that it did indeed have a mil=\r\nd effect on the system, which made it safe for him to approach the tower. H=\r\ne again hides behind a mass of debris, and finds that breeze catches his fa=\r\nce, from the opposite side of the tower. There was a door that was partiall=\r\ny opened. He feels for it with his fingers, and quietly slides it open just=\r\n enough to sqeeze in, which was a little bit of a squeeze for him. This was=\r\n it, he was inside. Again, not wanting to make it obvious, he quietly slide=\r\ns the door just a bit ajar, to make sure he isn&#39;t discovered. Then, quietly=\r\n he hides again, and stops to try to pick up Rodimus&#39;s heat signature once =\r\nmore. It was difficult, because his temperature continued to drop with ever=\r\ny ounce of energy that was being stolen from him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; All right, low he=\r\nat signature, this is going to make it a little difficult to track. Time to=\r\n boost up my receptors a bit... And it wouldn&#39;t hurt to scramble my signals=\r\n either...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson had never known fear and apprehension. With every =\r\nslow step, he becomes more and more familliar with both emotions. He couldn=\r\n&#39;t let them stop him. He was doing this to save Rodimus, a gesture from the=\r\n spark who&#39;s power is relentless. His affections for his leader keeps him f=\r\nocused on the task at hand. And it isn&#39;t long until his persistance pays of=\r\nf. The ping was loud and clear, and yes, it was Rodimus. The signature read=\r\n Decepticon though. But knowing what Kenzo had told him, he keeps reserved.=\r\n Now, he wanted to be seen and heard. With his cross bow subspaced he stand=\r\ns idol, but ready for anything. And quietly with a soft tone of voice..\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclo=\r\nnus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to clarify.
