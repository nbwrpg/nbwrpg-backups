You guessed my plan! I was gonna draw everyone&#39;s attention\n&gt; away from all the top secret stuff that&#39;s going on in the RPG by\n&gt; making them fill in their char profiles! No, just kidding. It was a\n&gt; pure accident.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, more\n&gt; bad news. The message board has just been accidently cleared. I really\n&gt; thiink I should knock myself out or something before I accidently\n&gt; destroy something here!
