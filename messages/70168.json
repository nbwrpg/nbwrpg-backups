His optics\nbrightened and then dimmed as the news and comments came over the\ntransmission lines. As grim as the words were, they did not daunt the\nfigure he cut as he was standing tall once again.\n\nOpening the communication lines he began to speak, &quot;I know that many\nof you have no reason to trust me.&quot; he said, his voice confident and\nyet somehow humble at the same time. &quot;Much time has passed and I have\ndone a great many things.&quot;\n\nRodimus frowned as his face saddened, but continued talking, &quot;The\nunfortunate thing is that I remember each hateful thing as I did as\none of Hydras&#39; lacky. I can only tell you that I am no longer that\nperson. The power that Hydras had over me is broken, and I will spend\neach day and night trying to make it up to each and everyone of you,\nand making Hydras pay for everything he has done not only to me but\nthis planet and you.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will see you soon my friends.&quot; Rodimus said as he shifted into his\nvehicular mode, that grounding of gears echoing through the room.\n&quot;First I have to find my wife!&quot;\n\nRodimus&#39; light flickered to life as brought all his weaponry online,\n&quot;You are welcome to accompany me if you like.&quot; he called out to Kup\nhopefully. &quot;I would be most greatful.&quot;\n\nWith a rev of his engines Rodimus fired his motor, &quot;NIGHTLIGHT! I AM\nCOMMING!&quot; Rodimus called out, hoping she would hear him over the noise\nand alarms. Hoping against hope that she had her radio Rodimus sent\nher a mesage as well, telling her where he was!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
