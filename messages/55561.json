Well, if your \nlooking for someone to do your dirty work. Forget it. If you want to \njoin us and win the war, that may be different story. But let&#39;s se if \nyou survive first.&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe acted a little smug towards KitKat. &quot;Look I don&#39;t need any pile \nof bolts to do my work for me. I just can&#39;t take on an entire \nregiment of maximals alone. It&#39;s not only stupid, it&#39;s suicide. \nHowever, we have seemed to get off on the wrong foot. Let&#39;s start \nover shall we. My name is Battera. I am seeking help and and would be \nvery greatful for any assistance I may be able to get.&quot;\n\nShe frowned after she said the words. Her original programs were \ntrying to surface and now was not the time.\n\nKitKat::\nShe gave the new comer a funny look and shook her head. &quot;What ever. \nNames KitKat. Now, if you want back at the maximals, you&#39;ll have to \nprove yourself first.&quot;  Kitkat drew her plasma pistol and grinned \nevilly. &quot;You want to prove it to me? Or the boss?&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe tried to look unimpressed, but couldn&#39;t help but swallow a little \nhard at the sight of the pistol. &quot;Please my dear. For one thing, it \nwould be pointless to try to prove anything to you since you are not \nthe leader. Second, what good will you be to the others if \nyour...DEAD!&quot;  She transformed into bot mode and stood there, her \nclaws ready to dig into metal flesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She got the orders and the coordinated from Perceptor and went to \nthe \n&gt; coordinants.\n&gt; \n&gt; Battera::\n&gt; \n&gt; She recieved the location and slowly flew down. She didn&#39;t trust \n&gt; these bots. But she would have to put on her game face to make it \nout \n&gt; of this alive. She flew down and landed. She saw a wolf at the same \n&gt; location. She flew down and transformed into bot mode. Her wings \n&gt; folded behind her. \n&gt; &quot;Great, I&#39;m looking for a mighty warrior and this is what I find?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; KitKat::\n&gt; She growled. &quot;I am a warrior. And I&#39;ll slag any bot that says other \n&gt; wise. What&#39;s your name and why are you here? State your business \n&gt; quickly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Battera::\n&gt; &quot;Fine, you don&#39;t have to get pushy. Names Battera. Just flew out of \na \n&gt; cave cell and wanted to get back at the filthy maximals that put me \n&gt; in there. I can&#39;t get revenge alone. I need help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
