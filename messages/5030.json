The internal defences couldnt see \nthem behinde the makeshift foxhole, and for now they were safe. :::\n\n::: Inferno, coverend in numerous blast marks. ::: The Royalty will be very \ndispleased!\n\n::: Rampage, also covered in marks by the crossfire, and with a splitting \nheadache. ::: Who cares anymore? We just need to blow this bridge apart!\n\n::: Marine smiled ::: Good thinking!\n\n::: He went to his left forearm and opened a small compartment. He took out \ntwo explosives, clicked them together, and threw them over head onto the main \nfloor of the bridge. After a brief countdown, they exploded sending the three \nPredacon slamming agianst the wall, and destroying mose of the computers and \ndefences in that room. :::\n\n::: Rampage, now black with sutt and in pain ::: That was my good thinking? I \nwouldnt have done that!\n\n::: Marine ::: well, at least now we can move around the bridge without the \nautodefences shooting us.\n\n::: Rampge sniffed. The three got up coutiously and began to move around the \nbroken room. Marine was wrong, all the computers were destroyed. They couldnt \neven find all the pieces to put one back together. :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: Ah, the Royalty will be pleased after all. \n\n::: Marine ::: Well, one things for sure, they wont be using this bridge ever \nagian.\n\n::: The three Predacons lauged, and then groaned with the pain they had \ncaused themselfs in the explosion. :::\n\n::: Marine, on comm to Hell Beast ::: Commander, success! We have completely \ndestroyed the Maximal bridge!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Excellent! And what of the Maximals and defense systems?\n\n::: Marine ::: Well, we really havent encountered any Maximals, and most of \nthe defences are down.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Good, good. I want a full report in an hour about your \nprogress. Hell Beast out.\n\n::: The comm went to static. :::\n\n"}}
