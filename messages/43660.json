You made an agreement, it is time \nfor you to return. You can not resist me... you are my puppet, my \npuppet for me to do with you as I wish.&quot;\n\nAs the voice said this Blacknightmare found herself drawing her blast \nand aiming at Orchestra, at the saem time her optics began to glow a \nbright blue as he body was surrounded in a red glow. The mysterious \nvoice speaking to orchestra now through Blacknightmares mouth, its \nvoice replacing her.\n\n????: &quot;She is not going anywhere with you. She is my puppet, follow \nand you shall find oblivion.&quot;\n\nWith those words the voice dissapeared yet the red glow remained \naroudn her body as she was forced to fire at Orchestra at close range \nbefore being amde to run off. Meanwhile back in the undersea base, a \npotion of the ocean floor opens a bright glow emanating from the \nchamber. Inside the control room the mysterious bot laughs evily as \nit looks to Blight.\n\n????: &quot;How long until launch?&quot;\n\nBlight: &quot;Five seconds...&quot;\n\nThe mysterious bot turns and looks to a clock with the cybertronian \nsymbols for four slowly coming, then 3, then 2, then 1. As one is \nreached a large projectile is launched from the ocean floor, in a few \nmoments the massive glowing object breaks the surface of the ocean, \nstill flying up. The glowing shell around it soon breaks away \nrevealing a black opject looking like a type of obelisk which soon \npierces through the atmosphere, that soon breaking away leaving a \nlarge grey and red object made of energy now in orbit right over the \nMid atlantic base somehow being able to stay over it. Three blue dish \nlike objects then appear on its face. Its purpose yet unknown to all \nbut the infecticons and of course some people in the RPG.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
