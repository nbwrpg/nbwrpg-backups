Gatara fires first, her \nfingers squeezing down on both her rifle&#39;s triggers, launching a \nbarrage of magnum rounds and a grenade.  This acts as a signal for \nthe other two: Riekan launches an explosive harpoon, and Jayde fires \nseveral bursts from her ionic blaster.  (Much like the weapon that \nG1&#39;s Blast Off uses in robot mode, it doesn&#39;t physically damage its \ntarget, instead disrupting the electrical impulses that control both \norganic and mechanoid nervous systems, causing spasms or possibly \nshorting a bot out altogether.)\n\nFiring their weapons makes the Rogues temporarily visible, but they \nquicky scatter and recloak, seeking to assess the damage they caused.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tyrael had not spotted Talon yet, and he started to not care about \n&gt; him. Seeing Waspinator go down and Perceptor transform made him \nsmile \n&gt; and laugh. Quickstrike was the next one standing. He sent four \n&gt; luminous blasts at the weird looking bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock took grasp of Waspinator&#39;s stasis locked form and threw it \nat \n&gt; Perceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Burrock: Maybe that&#39;ll stop you! Whatever happens, you preds can \nnot \n&gt; match us! Stay put so we can rip your sparks off!\n\n\n"}}
