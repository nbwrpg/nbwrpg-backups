FAIR\n&gt;GAME!&quot; Dark One bellowed aloud, bringing up his targeting computer, firing\n&gt;four seeking missiles at Liono.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Breakdown activated his internal computer, getting a fixed, he launched a\n&gt;powerful rocket into the sky, descending rapidly down towards Liono.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Hiss fired four fusion blasts from his cannon, waiting to see the carnage.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Scavenger swerved in his HUMVEE mode, firing thirty shells at Liono.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Pyro swerved his cannon, firing an arc of flames at Liono, Dark One flying\n&gt;away, followed by all the Oblitercons on the ground, Pyro&#39;s cannon aiming\n&gt;backwards in case.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Serpentor fell to his back from Zergling&#39;s shots, firing an optic blast in \n&gt;an\n&gt;arc at Zergling and Nemesis Enforcer, Nemesis slamming to the ground.\n&gt;Serpentor leapt into the air, running off for the Newcomer&#39;s base.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Unitron chuckled.  Seeking missiles, easy to dodge, if you had the \n&gt;expertise.\n&gt;  Activating flares, four ejected at the missiles (don&#39;t mean to post \n&gt;damage),\n&gt;the missiles blowing up on impact, the force sending Unitron spinning.\n&gt;Transforming to robot mode, he slammed to the ground on his side.  Hearing\n&gt;Shuko&#39;s orders, he took out his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at\n&gt;Liono as he ran.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Anubis sidesteps, letting the blast scrape his arm.  Yelling in pain, he\n&gt;fired a rocket and two optic blasts off at Tigerhawk, falling back as \n&gt;ordered.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Hades rolled to the left, the missiles going by, but laser beams twirling \n&gt;him\n&gt;as they hit his side.  Falling to one knee, he jumped up to his feet, as he\n&gt;ran for the Newcomer&#39;s base, he pointed his laser rifle backwards, firing\n&gt;several rapid bolts at Tigerhawk.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Sixshot looked around.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re losing to these pathetic\n&gt;Maximals.&quot; firing a rocket off from his missile launcher at the Ark, he\n&gt;transformed to his tank mode, firing a blast from the top cannon, and two\n&gt;missiles from embedded missile launchers off at Liono, transforming to \n&gt;space\n&gt;fighter mode and launching off into the air.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
