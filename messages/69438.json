The Tsunami was at hand, and the decis=\r\nion to leave was valid.

It was obvious h=\r\ne had not yet blown the steam he needed to blow and was not about to do tha=\r\nt on the airtanker.  \n\n&quot;If you would excuse me for a moment Lord Perseus, I=\r\n need to step away for a moment.&quot;  \n\nHe transforms into SUV mode and speeds=\r\n off to a secluded space not far from the airtanker.  Here, lonely boulders=\r\n grip the waterfront, and he knew this would serve a better place to vent h=\r\nis frustrations.\n\nHe returns to robot mode, and the first boulder he sees, =\r\nhe punches it hard, cracking it, and leaving an indentation in the rock its=\r\nelf.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s what I think about Megatron!&quot;  \n\nHe puches it several more t=\r\nimes and then lets out a scream of frustration.  After his venting he takes=\r\n time to count to ten and then calms down again enough to return to the air=\r\ntankers, once again coming across as mild mannered as he always has while r=\r\nemaining on Atlantis.\n\n&quot; I appologize for that quick absense.  Thank you.&quot; =\r\n \n\nHe gets into SUV mode and slowly rolls up more material into the air tan=\r\nker.

He was sad to leave, and even more angry that the ene=\r\nmy who had caused most damage in the past, now desires truce among his kind=\r\n and the Maxmials.  He would have no part of it personally but felt trapped=\r\n that he had to comply to this.  He would comply, yet he knew he did not ha=\r\nve to be friendly with the opposing faction.
