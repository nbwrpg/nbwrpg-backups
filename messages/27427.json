He didn&#39;t sound to happy. Maybe she \n=\r\nwas wrong to judge him as bad?\n\n&quot;Are you allright?&quot; she asks, walking towar=\r\nd him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ** Th=\r\ne faces on the screen were those of the bots with which had \ncrashed with M=\r\negatron upon earth years ago, yet none of them looked \nlike Von. Or what he=\r\n remembered he looked like. After all, Von was a \nteen the last time he had=\r\n seen him, obviously he would have change by \nnow. The pictures upon the vi=\r\new screen were of transformers with \nbeast modes, which Von had had none of=\r\n back at their home. So, as \nbeast modes changed faces and bodies=85did the=\r\ny change metal \ncharacteristics as well?\n&gt; Vlad sighed gruffly and looked a=\r\nt the rimes of the visual screen, \nseeing his dimmed reflection and noticin=\r\ng something for the first \ntime. The way he looked with his beast mode. He =\r\nlooked=85older then he \nwas, yet still had the charming look which he was k=\r\nnown for.\n&gt; But then he saw it=85something familiar that he knew for a fact=\r\n \nreminded him of only ONE face in all those of Megatron&#39;s group. That \nhea=\r\nvy brow, the same one he had now. Brown metal=85same as his. And \nthere was=\r\n only one bot in Megatron&#39;s group which appeared to own \nbrown armor very s=\r\nimilar to his.\n&gt; Vlad&#39;s optics snapped to the screen and located that one w=\r\nhich \nlooked very similar to himself, bringing up a file on that \ntransform=\r\ner and reading as quickly as he could and almost found \nhimself lost from c=\r\noncentration as Fenox re-entered the area and \nspoke. He shushed and held u=\r\np a finger towards her to be quiet, \ncontinuing to read and scroll down.\n&gt; =\r\nThis was it, it had to be! The characteristics matched \nperfectly.** &quot; Von =\r\nI&#39;ve found you!&quot; **He spoke a little louder then \nhe intended but this was =\r\nspectacular. He had found Von, actually \nlocated him. After months of searc=\r\nhing for his older brother he had \nfinally located him. In yet, Vlad&#39;s exci=\r\ntement has suddenly brought \nto a silent stand still when one single red wo=\r\nrd flashed upon the \nscreen right below the last words of the profile.\n&gt; DE=\r\nCEASED.\n&gt; Von=85was dead?\n&gt; That was what deceased meant, dead.\n&gt; Vlad knew=\r\n for a fact that he had come here to destroy Von if he was \nalive=85but whe=\r\nn it really came down to it. Vlad was not only \ndisappointed but stunned to=\r\n find that his brother was already dead.  \nYes, he had planned to kill him =\r\nbut he had somehow grown attached to \nwhat he remembered of his half-brothe=\r\nr, and now that he had passed on \nit felt=85felt like he had actually lost =\r\nwhat he remembered what his \nbrother, or what he knew of him was gone.\n&gt; Vl=\r\nad shook his head and glared at the screen, shutting it off and \nlooking do=\r\nwn at Shesta as she rubbed against his leg.   Was he really \nsad? He couldn=\r\n&#39;t be sad because of this, he didn&#39;t really even know \nVon to begin with. B=\r\nut now HE was the only one left of their family. \nVlad was alone now, to cl=\r\naim his mother&#39;s land and also to live as he \nwished.\n&gt; Sighing, Vlad leane=\r\nd back and rubbed his neck, patting the soft \nhead of his friend and glanci=\r\nng at Fenox.** &quot; I&#39;ve found what I \nneeded, thanks.&quot;  ** In his voice he wa=\r\ns obviously shocked, sure that \nhe would be glad that Von was dead if he fo=\r\nund that out. But=85he \ndidn&#39;t expect to feel THIS way about it.\n&gt; Vlad was=\r\n confused, and out of his own characteristics. He was never \nsad or showed =\r\npersonal concern, but Von and himself were the last of \ntheir family and th=\r\ne news that HE was now the last was very shocking \nindeed.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______=\r\n__________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Email, New=\r\ns, Links and The Best Selection at \nhttp://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n\n"}}
