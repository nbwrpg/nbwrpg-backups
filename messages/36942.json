Do \nnot worry, we are quite capable of doing any thing we want, perhaps \noccasionally with the help of Computron though.&quot; He continues \ndriving, and waits, giving Lightspeed a chance to talk.\n\nScattershot speeds along, and enters the hideout right after Strafe. \nAfterburner arrives close on his heals. None of the wonder where \nNosecone is though. Scattershot transforms, and lands beside \nIronhide. &quot;Strafe, Afterburner. Wait for the rest of the Technobots \nto arrive, the we&#39;ll form Computron to clean up this mess. \nAfterburner you stay with Strafe.&quot; Afterburner nods to Scattershot, \nand Ironhide. &quot;Arright boss, as long as I get to kick some \nDecepticraps soon, I&#39;m good.&quot; He smiles at the though of battle with \nDecepticons.\n\n\n"}}
