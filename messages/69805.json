Here, this will make it easy to adm=\r\ninister the energon.&quot; \n\nHe takes a seat near everyone but especially near E=\r\nlita.  Rodimus and Nightlight were already taken from her and he was not ab=\r\nout to let her fall into the same fate.  Her sadness to him is a torture he=\r\n felt she did not deserve.  She had done nothing to no one and in return wa=\r\ns suffering a great deal.  This angers him yet he tries desperately to hold=\r\n back his elevating temper.  He cracks his knuckles to try and calm himself=\r\n down although at this point, he didn&#39;t know if he could ever calm down.\n\n&quot;=\r\nAs if the battle between us and Unicron wasn&#39;t enough. Now Hydras, Cyclonus=\r\n and Scourge have to go on a meaningless power trip and torment innocent Au=\r\ntobots and Maximals without rime or reason.  I know if Rodimus were in his =\r\nright mind, he would not tolerate it, and certainly not Optimus.  As far as=\r\n I heard from what I learned while at the fortress, Cyclonus is feeding off=\r\n the power of the Matrix which is in Rodimus&#39;s body.  That&#39;s what&#39;s making =\r\nhim stronger.  Well, guess what?  I&#39;m prepared to cut that umbilcal cord no=\r\n matter how much it damages my own spark.  I learned something about self w=\r\north.  What am I worth?  How can I be worth something when there are lives =\r\njust starting out there that are more precious than my own?  And how can I =\r\nsay I&#39;m worth something when we have young aspiring Autobots and Maximals j=\r\nust starting their careers as soldiers?  They have their whole lives ahead =\r\nof them, and by Primus I&#39;m prepared to give back what&#39;s been taken from the=\r\nm, THEIR FREEDOM!&quot;\n\nHe sighs and calms himself down.\n\n&quot; When it comes down =\r\nto it, there is no such thing as self worth.  There is only wealth if it ca=\r\nn be shared with others.  If we extend our hands to help another, it helps =\r\na world to grow stronger, and strength is what is worth more than anything =\r\nin the universe, and that strength only derives from compassion and love.  =\r\nThis is something they lack.  They have everything else, except the most po=\r\nwerful force in the universe.  We won&#39;t need any super charged weaponry to =\r\nfight them.  For the most part, just look inside your heart, and you will f=\r\nind the strength to overcome any evil that&#39;s thrown out at you.&quot;  \n\nHe paus=\r\nes for a moment.\n\n&quot;Optimus Prime believed in such values.  He cared deeply =\r\nfor those he fought for.  And it was that compassion that lead to many of h=\r\nis successful battles.&quot; \n\nAs he sat with everyone, Tucson is instinctively =\r\ndrawn back to the body of Optimus Prime as he turns his head in the directi=\r\non of his body.  The cable he connects to the energon flow appears long eno=\r\nugh for him to walk a reasonable distance, as he finds himself going back t=\r\no Optimus Prime&#39;s still body.\n\n&quot;Sorry for being so wrestless, but something=\r\n is telling me to come back to Optimus Prime&#39;s body...&quot;\n\nOnce again, he kne=\r\nels beside his fallen leader, feeling that maybe he had not spent enough ti=\r\nme paying his tribute.  Then, another overpowering instinct compells him to=\r\n put his palm over Prime&#39;s chest.  He could feel an energy source, which pe=\r\nrplexes him into curiosity.  Touching nothing he keeps his hand over Prime&#39;=\r\ns chest.\n\n&quot;Kup, Elita, Lord Elder, over here.. I - feel something...  Can&#39;t=\r\n quite put my finger on what it is, but I do feel something.  It&#39;s undernea=\r\nth my hand.  It&#39;s an energy source, a - very powerful energy source... Mayb=\r\ne I - shouldn&#39;t be this close...&quot;  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston=\r\n Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita started to cry in silence w=\r\nhile Kup Hugged her tightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder looked over at Elita, his own =\r\nheart troubled by her tears.\n&gt; However he was never good with dealing with =\r\nyoung ones. He could deal\n&gt; with scientific and engineering formula all day=\r\n. He could even run\n&gt; through combat to save an innocent, but the crying of=\r\n a young one\n&gt; seemed beyond his ability to deal with.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced at K=\r\nup, silently asking him to deal with Elita as he helped\n&gt; Tuscon to sit. &quot;P=\r\nerhaps we get can get you a feed line as we all\n&gt; talk?&quot; he said to Tuscon,=\r\n trying to cover up his own feelings of\n&gt; unease.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
