She snarls and looks around, seeing anyone else. Just when she looks the other way, she feels a sharp pain in her left side, following by dozens of others! The bullets had peirced her stomach and gone right through!*\n\n*She yelps with the pain, but quietens herself, quickly looking around. On her other side she saw a bot coming up, a bat bot, and she dodges, but manages to get a nasty slash through one optic before it flew off. She felt dizzy with the pain, and feels an iron disk slash neatly through her wing base, nearly cutting it off, and the other giving a slash to her chest. Teltoli hits the ground, her wings not keeping her up anymore. Groaning, she coughs up a little mech-fluid..*\n\n---------\n\n*Kit yells in satisfaction as Nemesis flies away, and she laughs after him. This was too fun! She nearly blew off his head! Haha! Just then she hears an explosion, and she turns round just in time to be blown back by a powerful blast! It knocks her into a tree, singing her chest armour a bit. She gets up and growls, running off in the directon of the blast, knowing it was that coward that ran away before..*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
