But I don&#39;t like the idea of all this.  We have to get \nout of here.  Those aliens aren&#39;t going to give up so easily and \nneither is Megatron.  He wants us all dead.  If he can get the aliens \nto kill us off, he&#39;d do it too.  we re in danger.And staying here \nisn&#39;t going to help.&quot;  her body shook a little harder now.  She still \nstood there, refusing to give in. \nShe turned and looked at Aracnia. &quot;SO, what do you want us to do.?&quot;\nShe had a look of fear in her eyes and anger on her face. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nice shot,&quot; Quickstrike said when he saw the body of the alien \nfall. \n&gt; He looked to Black Arachnia. &quot;Remind me not t&#39;--&quot; He turned his \nhead \n&gt; around to hear Dark Mouse. He frowned and turned to the rodent. He \n&gt; narrowed his crimson optics from his distance and jogged off to \nher. \n&gt; He bent down with his odd, mismatched hands on his knees, and \n&gt; said, &quot;What are ya doin&#39;? Ya bailin&#39; us?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
