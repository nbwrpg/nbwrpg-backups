The perfect mix of robot and organic \nlife.  Feral hoped he could achieve that one day.\n\n&quot;Your biped mode should be ready.&quot;\n\nVerdant&#39;s large eyes looked to Feral.  Wordlessly his body twisted and \ncontorted into a biped form.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; he said, stretching.  He stood at \nnine feet tall and looked somewhat like a mix between a lion and a tree.  He \nwaved an arm that looked quite a lot like a branch in the air.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s even better than my old body.&quot;\n\n&quot;The gas was a blessing in dis--&quot; Feral winced in pain.\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; Verdant asked, rushing to his leader&#39;s side.\n\n&quot;The land.  More battling.  The ground near the main Maximal encampment \nsuffers more than the combatants.  When the battle is over and it is safe for \ntravel, we must take action.&quot;\n\n"}}
