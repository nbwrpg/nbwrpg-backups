It bounces off one astroid, only to collide with \nanother, and another, and another and son on. This time, however, Bob was \nready, he&#39;d buckled himself in, and tied himself down to avoid unwated \ninjury. He rubs his bruised nose. &quot;Whoooooo...&quot; He sighs as he bounces off \nyet another asteroid. As he comes out of the Asteroid belt, he sees a \nreddish planet off in the distace. He frowns, and looks at his schedual \nsheet. The electro-sheet has a timetable of when Bob must be a a specific \nplanet to perform. He checks the red planet&#39;s coordinates in comparison \nwith target planet. His eyes bulge as he reads his electro-sheet&#39;s \ncalculations. he was approximately 250 000 000 000 000 AU from the \ntarget planet. That would take him... he checks his sheet calcuations \nagain, 15 years to get back. Bob sits back in his chair. and says one thing: \n&quot;Oops...&quot;\n\nOOC: an &quot;AU&quot; is an Astronomical Unit. It is the mean distance from our \nsun to earth. 92 960 000 miles, or 149 604 970 kilometres. Bob is lost. \nVery lost.\n\n"}}
