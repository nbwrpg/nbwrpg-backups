The DINOBOTS, if they even were all of them, had\n&gt; superior senses and they would be optimum at noticing him in this jungle\n&gt; environment where he only had his otpics, and his lack of fluency in jungle\n&gt; arenas.\n&gt;\n&gt; So he watched as they seemed ot be..  Making a bridge then.  But for who?\n&gt; And for what reason were they setting up for someone to cross?  For now,\n&gt; WHEELIE stayed hidden, waiting and observing.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nYes, the fallen trees did indeed certainly seem to be forming a bridge\nas they lay down almost next to each other.\n\nSWOOP and the other avian transformers shifted into their robot mode\nand began lashing them together what appeared to be ropes and vines,\nthey were working quickly.\n\nSuddenly in the distance a roar rang out, this one followed by another.\n\nThen there was the sound of a large creature, or several of them\nclosing in on the gorge from the same side that WHEELIE was on. In\nfact it sounded like they were probably going to moving almost through\nhis hidden position.\n\nSWOOP and the others seemed to hear it as well. Finishing their work\nthey quickly took to the air as the sounds of the other large\ncreatures continued to approach. Movements through the brush could be\nheard moving fast!\n\nThere was another roar, this time it was much closer. It was then that\nWHEELIE could possibly place the sound.\n\nThe roar sounded distinctly like GRIMLOCK!\n\n                                                                  and\nit did not sound like he was alone!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
