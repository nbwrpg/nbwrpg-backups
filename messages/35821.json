My comp died again.\n\n\n::::\n\nThe bot watches Grimlock land, and feels a tightening in his stomach due to the alchohol he had consumed. He leans forward, letting the contents of his stomach back onto the ground. Straightening out, he&#39;s him in the back by a laser shot.\n\nThe bot swears, spinning around and jumping back. His scanners locate the bot that had attacked him, and he fires a missile back.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The other bots watch curiously, the two bots were fithting each other\n&gt; completely oblivious to thier presence. One of the four opened a link to the\n&gt; leader &quot;Should we attack?&quot; it asked thinking about taking advantage of the\n&gt; situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hold your ground and let them waste thier energy, one injured bot will be\n&gt; easier to take out than two.&quot; THe leader flew lower and landed on a\n&gt; buildings ledge. &quot;I&#39;ll give you the signal, wait until then.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking notes on the battle the four noted the big bots missle launchers, the\n&gt; missles could easily be refitted to fit them. The prizes of the attack were\n&gt; looking better and better.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ground collapsed beneath the monsterbot causing it to drop below ground,\n&gt; it appeared the drunken bot had won.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly rubble burst from the hole, the monsterbot presenting himself back\n&gt; into the battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shortly later the fight seemed over, the leader of the four observers was\n&gt; ready to make his move. A shadow passed overhead as Grimlock flew overhead.\n&gt; Again he had to delay his attack. The other Dinobots arrived on the scene\n&gt; making the prize that much juicier. He didn&#39;t want to wait any longer.\n&gt; &quot;Cybrats move, pick your targets and make every shot count.&quot; being the only\n&gt; flyer he flew down toward Grimlock fireing two piercing missles at the\n&gt; Dinobot leader. If successfull the missles would pierce the Dinobots armor\n&gt; and explode from the inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arty rolled in from behind fireing two sidewinders at Slag and four shots\n&gt; from his cannon at Repugnus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogged launched a taser line at the bum, then tossed a smoke grenade into\n&gt; the middle of the action to blind the prey. The Cybrats had optical implants\n&gt; designed to see through the smoke, Most other senses would be blind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Brandings flamethrowers flipped onto her arms launching flames at the blind\n&gt; side of Repugnus. her optics locked on, her aim was infalible, her ability\n&gt; to down the target was out of necessity, there was nothing personal about\n&gt; the battle the Cybrats would have attacked any other factions the same way.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@n...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, May 26, 2001 2:25 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Repugnus::\n&gt; &gt; Repugnus looses his grip on the bot as he walks.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Talk, or I&#39;ll send you to the pit.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; He he takes a swing with his large pincers at the bots head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The large bot mumbles something incoherent and continues forward even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though he was pinned.
