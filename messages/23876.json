I have \nbeen busy with Christmas business.)\n\n** Vlad&#39;s optics become accustome to the light which fintered in through the \nopen hatch-way, blinking a few last times before finally seeing the wall of \na hallway just beyond the door.\nThis was a ship...some sort of base.\nBut what he could tell, it wasn&#39;t Maximal, and was more close to the \nPredacon build.\nThough, there was no way to find out for sure until he met whom ever this \nship belonged to, and maybe hire himself an assassin after all.\nVlad smiled and chuckled deeply to himself. Von; if he was alive, would know \nthat his little brother came to give him a little visit.\n\nHe looks down at the animal at his side for a moment before he begins to \nhead for the door, jumping back in surprise as he nearly runs into someone. \nShesta growling at his side.\nIt was the man who had dragged him from the sea, recovered the pod, and then \nwas taken away.\nGrowling slighly as he saw the mans hand near his weapon, the growl \ndisappearing as he straightened himself up and cleared his throat.\nTurning out to look like a rather striking young man, what he wanted to look \nlike one.\nBut Vlad nodded to Havoc&#39;s commant.**\n\n&quot; Yes. I don&#39;t like living in fish bowls for too long, get&#39;s stuffy.&quot;\n\n** Vlad didn&#39;t smile, only had an expression on his face which reflected the \nbrain within. Commented as clever by others. Sneaky and cruel by his \nenemies.\nBut it was time to get down to business.**\n\n&quot; What faction is this? &quot;\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
