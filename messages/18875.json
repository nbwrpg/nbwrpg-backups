What if we were to combine the two? Not just combine \nanimals but combine programming too.&quot; Squizzy was smart enough to \nknow when ideas were right or wrong. She could be just the bot \nVeratis would need to help achieve his goals. &quot;After all&quot; She \ncontinued &quot;Didn&#39;t the profecy say Till all are one?&quot;\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Squizzy::\n&gt; \n&gt; She nodded. &quot;I agree, It&#39;s not the just the body, but the mind of \nthe \n&gt; bot that needs to be nature oriented. But then, how do we do this? \n&gt; You can give a bot a body, but a mind?&quot; She shook her head. \n&gt; &quot;Something about that..I don&#39;t like.  If I had found out that you \nhad \n&gt; made me, created my to be perfect in body, I would be gratefull and \n&gt; show great loyalty.  But if I found that you made my mind to think \n&gt; tha way that you programmed, that my thoughts were not truely my \nown, \n&gt; I&#39;d go balistic.  No,  There has to be another way.&quot;  She thought, \n&gt; then her eyes lit up as the idea ran across her mind,&quot;THAT&#39;S IT!&quot;  \nwe \n&gt; don&#39;t program it. We teach it.  Give the bot the body of the \nperfect \n&gt; warrior,but the innocent mind of a child.  Then we teach it was we \n&gt; want it to know.  Then it will grow and learn on it&#39;s own, not just \n&gt; obey a program. but we can program it to be open minded, show \n&gt; tenancies to be caring, wanting to learn, appreciate learning and \n&gt; scientific learning.&quot;  She was smiling really hard at this. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n \n\n\n"}}
