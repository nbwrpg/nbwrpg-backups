For many reasons, he didn&#39;t believe her. He \n&gt; wasn&#39;t going to stop for no one, in fear that she was from either \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s or Hell Beast&#39;s sides. He dodged trees and jumped over \n&gt; downed trees, snapped in half and uprooted. \n&gt; \n&gt; He charged through the forest, with the dry leaves brushing against \n&gt; his furless feet. Approaching a slide, his back foot crashed \nagainst \n&gt; a dead log, which made him loose his balance and slip. His body \nwent \n&gt; tumbling down, first on his side. He soon tucked his body in until \nhe \n&gt; looked like a ball, and rolled down the slide. At the foot of it, \nhis \n&gt; body rolled off the eroded base, and fell into the ground with a \n&gt; grunt.\n\n\n"}}
