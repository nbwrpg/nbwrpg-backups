Someone, one of these Predacons, changed themself to \nlook like \n&gt; Hydras. If a Decepticon did this without Megatron&#39;s planning or \npermission, \n&gt; they would be immediately terminated. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before she could react to his statement, Blackstorm emerged.. \nspoke & started \n&gt; to leave. But was caught by this new form of what was Aerotaur. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blackstorm is little of your concern. She is under my protection, \nby \n&gt; Perceptor here, until Hydras has been repaired.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh, and a fair warning,&quot; she continued, speaking to Hevn. Her \nclaw hands on \n&gt; her hips as she stood tall, &quot;I doubt Hydras would be amused with \nthe \n&gt; similarity between you & him.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She thought about speaking in response to his other question \nbefore he \n&gt; focused his attention upon Blackstorm. It wasn&#39;t Hydras that she \nhad a \n&gt; weakness for, but it was the part of Megatron that she had a \nserious weakness \n&gt; for. The part of Megatron... that soon became Galvatron. \n&gt; \n&gt; This part.... she would keep from the others, her feelings towards \nHydras. \n&gt; After millions of years of holding them in check... they were \nfinally \n&gt; released. But only to Hydras.\n\n\n"}}
