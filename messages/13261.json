She looked at them for a moment, then looked at \nIron Raptor. &quot;I&#39;ll d=\r\no what I can for you.

She didn&#39;t look any of the \nmales in th=\r\ne eyes while she looked up, but she kept her head up and \neyes forward.  He=\r\nr body shook slightly as she walked past, out of \nfear, but she kept her he=\r\nad up. \n\nShe walked donw the hall a few paces and realized she didn&#39;t know =\r\nthe \nCR room was.  She turned and walked back to the room.  &quot;Ah, I was \nwon=\r\ndering, which way to the CR room?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Sol=\r\nmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor heard Arcangle =\r\nenter the room but didn&#39;t turn and \nlook at him, \n&gt; keeping her optics on t=\r\nhe ground as she thought about the mission \nahead. She \n&gt; had received the =\r\ntransmission from Feline and had deactivated her \ncom-link, \n&gt; now dwelling=\r\n on just what they needed to take with them to recover \nthe \n&gt; missing bots=\r\n.\n&gt; She growled low in thought, though, her thoughts were interrupted \nmy t=\r\nhe \n&gt; presence of Arcangle and his words.\n&gt; Iron Raptor thought about his q=\r\nuestion for a moment, turning it \naround in \n&gt; her mind.\n&gt; It was fairly ri=\r\nsky to go out and look for the Autobots, half of \nthe problem \n&gt; being that=\r\n they didn&#39;t know where they were. And she knew that\nthe \nPredacons \n&gt; OR A=\r\nlliance would attack any bots that came across their path, \nmaking it \n&gt; ve=\r\nry dangerous to try and locate something.\n&gt; Iron Raptor slid off the tablet=\r\nop and faced the projections of the \nmissing \n&gt; Maximals, then turning towa=\r\nrds the large window that looked out \ninto the \n&gt; larger of the two Confere=\r\nnce Rooms. With a sigh she walked over to \nthe \n&gt; window and put a hand on =\r\nthe glass, her mind still dwelling on the \nmission \n&gt; at hand but also Arca=\r\nngels question.\n&gt; Finally she came to a conclusion.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes. But when I=\r\n get back and not until then.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She traced her finger along the glass=\r\n and tilted her head to the \nside.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; The Ark is extremely damaged and=\r\n needs heavy repair. When I\nget \nback I&#39;ll \n&gt; send you out to look for the =\r\nAutobots, but then half the Maximal \nforces and \n&gt; myself will begin repair=\r\ns. I want that ship completely functional \nbefore I \n&gt; even allow those bot=\r\ns anywhere near it. Understand?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then turned her head an=\r\nd looked over at Arcangel, \nthen turning \n&gt; her optics towards Silver Sting=\r\n and Hot Rod.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You two can go with him when I return, if you want. O=\r\ntherwise \nyou&#39;ll be \n&gt; repairing the Ark with the rest of us. The choice is=\r\n yours.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then she turned and faced the reflective surface of the=\r\n \nwindow again, \n&gt; her finger still tracing invisible lines on the glass. B=\r\nut then she \nheard \n&gt; another set of footsteps enter the room, softer and m=\r\nore\ncollected=85\nFeline. \n&gt; But then she heard them slow a bit, thinking th=\r\nat it must be her \nbecoming a \n&gt; ware of the male bots in the room. Somethi=\r\nng that she would have to \nget \n&gt; over.\n&gt; She then felt the fembots&#39; optics=\r\n on her, tilting her head to \nfinally see \n&gt; Feline approach her.\n&gt; But thi=\r\ns time her expression was just as blank as it was when she \nwas \n&gt; speaking=\r\n to Arcangle, Silver Sting and Hot Rod=85but it was a\nlittle \nmore \n&gt; relax=\r\ned with a kind sense about her. After all, Feline was a little \njittery \n&gt; =\r\nabout around the men and she wanted her to feel relaxed around her \nat \n&gt; l=\r\neast.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; No. You won&#39;t be going. What I want you to do is set up a\nsma=\r\nll \nmedical \n&gt; unit in the CR room for when we get back.  Some of the damag=\r\ne that \nthose two \n&gt; bots may have taken might be too extensive for just th=\r\ne CR chambers \nto \n&gt; handle, and I need you to treat those wounds that the =\r\nchambers \ncan&#39;t.  Any \n&gt; questions?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then turned back to=\r\n the window and crossed her arms \nin front \n&gt; of her chest, simply waiting =\r\nfor Feline to ask any questions that \nshe might \n&gt; need to know the answers=\r\n to.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n____________________________________________________________=\r\n__________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://w=\r\nww.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
