Her instincts were good, and the wolf was \nnow pissed off. He wasn&#39;t mad at her, he was mad at himself. he \nspoke, instead of pounced. He let his prey escape, and make a fool of \nhim in the process. Lunarpine wasn&#39;t in the mood for play, there was \nno more holding back.\n\n&quot;OK Wing you got me, I&#39;ll cook tonight, how&#39;s Owl dipped in energeon \nsound?&quot; Now he was truly the hunter, and she would soon learn this \ngame wasn&#39;t lost that easily.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as he came within a few inches of her, she hopped up and \ntapped him on \n&gt; the her with her beak.\n&gt; &quot;TAG! YOUR IT!&quot; She flew up over his head and hovered. &quot;Second \nLesson, try \n&gt; to out smart your opponeant. And your cooking dinner tonight.  Now \ncatch \n&gt; me!&quot; She flew off but staying withing 5 feet of the ground so he \ncould tag \n&gt; her back.  She turned around to face him, &quot;That is if your beast \nenough.&quot;  \n&gt; She flew off through the trees.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
