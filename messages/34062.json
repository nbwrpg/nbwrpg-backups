The \nchar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulations apply on the 12th (so you guys have 6 days to \nkill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; additional chars you have).

We&#39;ll be hunting down and \npunishing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; violators like crazy, so be sure to follow them :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All you peeps who were complainin&#39; about the char limit, we \nmade\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slight exception for you, though it&#39;s hard work. Anyways, \ncheck\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out, read carefully, and obey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS.
