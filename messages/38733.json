He looks around and at Repungus when the EMP blast hits, draining most of his energy. His vision blurs and he stumbles forward, the room spinning quite rapidly as his systems battle with the energy drain. He grabs on to a computer console for balance, the drain ending seconds later as they pass through the wormhole.\n\n&quot;What in the pit was in that beer?&quot; he says to himself as he pulls himself up, his systems recharging and vision and balance returning to normal. He looks back at Repungus.\n\n&quot;You know what, I really gotta quit drinking,&quot; he says to the bot, rubbing his head (Dion&#39;s head, not Repungus&#39;s).\n\n\n"}}
