(Sorry for the long time of\ninactivity Perceptor)\n\nBIC:\n\nMegatron&#39;s chambre was dully light, with purple lights, giving it an\nominous glow the tyrant enjoyed. With a pained expression he pulled\nhimself up, and quickly glanced at one of the moniters in front of him.\nThe ship was in movement, (good) he thought to himself. (We won&#39;t be\nvulnerable for much longer, but where is Havotron?) it wasnt time to\nmeet the Decepticon yet, that&#39;s why he had pulled back, but instead of\nHavotron, the Constructicons and Soundwave dominated the screen. (Old\nfriends? Or enemies?) He mused to himself. He pushed his arms outwards,\ngrabing hold of the sides of his recharger, and pulled himself up, a\nweary whine emited from his back joint. Then he realised his appointed\nbodyguards were still with him. (Good) he thought. (Never hurts to be\ncareful) but he then realised why they were worried. (The Vision. What\nwas it, my brother?) Megatron understood it very little, probably as\nmuch as Blindchaos and Dominjoe would if he explained it to them. He\nmust have a circuit loose in his head, he would have to get it checked\nby Switchblade later. That he did not relish. He pulled himself up, and\nstood, creaking his neck. He looked at his two soldiers, then back at\nthe screen.\n\n&quot;There must be a good reason those traitors stayed around the battle\nfield, we must go investigate, Dominjoe, transform.&quot; he ordered, as he\nhimself leapt to the air, folding and shrinking into his gun mode,\nfalling towards Blindchaos. &lt;Easier to transport me this way no :)&gt;\n\nThe computer replayed Megatron&#39;s silent message. &quot;Perceptor, old friend,\nmeet us back at the Hudson Bay.&quot;\n\n"}}
