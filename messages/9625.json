He is in his fluctuating state. He \nsees bots arrive at the scene, and one child attaks the knewly formed \nhuge bot into it&#39;s original pieces!\n\n&quot;By The Matrix, what is with this child?&quot;\n\nShe is blessed by The Matrix, just as you have been, Convix answered.\n\nWill the child factor in my attempts of peace.\n\nNot now, but soon. And it will be a large part. Without the child, \nyou will fail.\n\nThan I shall welcome it with open arms. But first, let&#39;s chase th4se \nguys away.\n\nVulois felt himself reach into their minds, and knew everything about \nthem. He started short circutring wires, but only certain systems. He \nhoped the others realizedthey can&#39;t be killed. Vulois started firing \nhis blasters at their chests, controlled, but enough to hurt. This \nneeded to finish. He needed to talk to the child.\n\n\n"}}
