This was pathetic of the Maximals.  \nHe fired off two missiles down at the Ark.  He recieved the Predacon \ntransmission.\n\n-Hmmm...cannon fodder for the Maximals, excellent- he thought to himself.  \nActivating his own comm. systme, he sent a reply transmission to the \nPredacons.  &quot;Go ahead and come, I will inform my subordinats.&quot; he said, soon \nsending transmissions to the other Oblitercons and the Alliance base.\n\n---\n\nScavenger pulled to the side, Rodimus missing him.  He activated his comm. \nsystem.  &quot;Hey, Pyro, someone wants to play chicken!&quot; Scavenger yelled as he \nopened fire with a barrage of 20 explosive shells on the Ark.\n\n---\n\n&quot;Excellent!&quot; Pyro replied, heading for Rodimus Prime, firing off three fire \nballs at the robot in vehicle mode.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown felt more shots hit and was ready to transform out of his current \nmode.  He fired off an explosive shell at the Ark, laughing as the shell blew \nup.  He transformed into his robot mode, grenade launcher at the ready.\n\n---\n\nHiss slowly got up,  crawling to his missile launcher, picking it up.  He \nhoped the others would get here, he didn&#39;t enjoy being gun fodder.\n\n"}}
