Of the other Rodimus, he knew not.\n&gt; Or of the Dinobots and what they begot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally as Astra cme up, Wheelie turned around and looked up.  &quot;Hello there.\n&gt;  I didn&#39;t scan you coming up a hair.  Is this what there is?  An end of\n&gt; things, like a quiz?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The small Mini-Vehicle taking a half roll down the place he had been\n&gt; sitting.  &quot;Out into the light, of the next day?  Wondering if the night will\n&gt; come or stay away?  Wondering what we might come to face?  Whether it will\n&gt; be a disgrace?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nASTRA smiled, &quot;My, your speech is strange.&quot; She said as she walked\nover to him. &quot;I can&#39;t always understand what you&#39;re trying to say, but\nI think you said you didn&#39;t scan me?&quot; She tilted her head at WHEELIE\nslightly, &quot;I think that is how we are built, to be difficult to scan\nand be seen.&quot;\n\nShe shrugged as she looked up into the skies, the canopy of trees open\nhere to the skies. &quot;For me I come here at the end of the day to watch\nthe coming of the night or to watch the stars. It is always so\npeaceful out here.&quot;\n\nShe looked back at WHEELIE, &quot;But I don&#39;t know anyhting like a quiz?&quot;\nShe shrugged again and looked back at the skies as the sun began its\nslow fade towards night.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
