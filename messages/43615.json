I am \n&gt; also saying that the Matrix MIGHT be with the NEW Omega Prime which \n&gt; was created when the original Omega Prime was created in RID (thanks \n&gt; for the abbriviation all the typing was hurting my fingers). It was \n&gt; some kind of power surge, but if you like we could just say the \nMatrix \n&gt; stayed in the other demision. I just think Omega Primes cool.  The \n&gt; only problem with that series is they call out there attacks. What \ndo \n&gt; they think transformers is Pokemon?  I won&#39;t be doing that if I can \n&gt; get this approved. And I might want to point out that all the \n&gt; Tranformer Series I&#39;ve seen have been BW, BM, RID, and 1 episode of \nGo \n&gt; Bots.  I don&#39;t know any others.  ALSO BM WAS MY FAVORITE SO STOP BAD \n&gt; MOUTHING IT!  BW WAS GOOD, BUT HOW IN THE HECK IS LOOKING LIKE \nANIMALS \n&gt; GOING TO HELP YOU IF YOU&#39;RE STILL TOTALLY MACHINE.  FURTHERMORE WHY \n&gt; DID THEY EAT FOOD IF THEY WERE PURLY MACHINE.  AND I LIKED ALL THE \n&gt; INTENSE SCENES IN BM WHERE THERE WAS TO MUCH COMEDY IN BW!  LIKE I \n&gt; SAID BW WAS STILL GREAT, BUT IT CAN&#39;T MATCH BM!  UNDERSTAND NOW!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Dewboy... you apparently are highly confused and be;lieve bw, \n&gt; and RID \n&gt; &gt; are entirely different continuities. BW followed the G1 comic and \n&gt; cartoon \n&gt; &gt; continuity and in that, the Matrix was used up already. Not the \n&gt; Matrix \n&gt; &gt; dimension itself, but the device that used its powers. Which was \nthe \n&gt; Autobot \n&gt; &gt; Matrix of leader ship. And as for everyone having portable DNA \n&gt; scanners in \n&gt; &gt; BM... BM was a piece of crap IMO as well as the opinion of tohers, \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; butchered the charachters old personalities as well as the old \n&gt; continuity. \n&gt; &gt; Now we have Robots in Disguise, RID is not in the same continuity \nas \n&gt; any of \n&gt; &gt; those shows. Its an en tirely independant show what was dubbed for \n&gt; US \n&gt; &gt; Release. The toys and everything were changed and modified, it has \n&gt; no hold on \n&gt; &gt; the continuity. Besides the matrix is already present in the RPG \n&gt; which I \n&gt; &gt; think either prowl or Iron Raptor has... although I think it may \n&gt; only be a \n&gt; &gt; small matrix device like that used by Big Convoy and Lio Convoy \nbut \n&gt; im not \n&gt; &gt; fully sure. However the original matrix of leadership is gone and \n&gt; destroyed...\n\n\n"}}
