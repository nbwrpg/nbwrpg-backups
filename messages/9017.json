She opened her \neyes and saw the sky and trees around her.  She also saw a lazar \nblast fly over her head. She rolled over on her side and tried to \nmove her legs.  She was wobbly but able to stand on all fours.  She \nlooked around and saw two Preds under fire from someone in the bushes \na ways off.  She looked for her pet but it was gone.  She felt sick \nabout leaving her pet behind, but she knew she had to in order to \nsurvive.  She slowly walked off into the bushes and through the trees.\nThe tranc made her a little woozy, but it was slowly wearing off. \n\n\n"}}
