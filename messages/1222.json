But, now Im back.\n\n::: HELL BEAST looks to RAMPAGE ::: Rampage, I do suppose you are right. We \nneed some R and R before another long and almost pointless battle.\n\n::: He sits in the command chair and reads a dat on the status of the other \nfractions, giving command to Rampage for the moment. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: TRANSANULAS, who had recived the transmission from the Oblitercons, now \nresponds in the secrecy of the lab :::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: Ah, Excellent Dark One! I need you to escourt my \nassociate, Quickstrike, to a secure location. Im sure he can figure out \nsomewhere...prehaps his friend Rowdy Wolf or something. He is damaged so I \nhope you do have some kind of medical training. His coordinates are at \n6.99-4. Please hurry. Your blank Proto-form awaits you.\n\n::: The transmission ends and the spider turns to look at the stasis pod \nglimmering in the light. He can just make out the blank face of the being \ninside. ...Transanulas mused at what the Oblitercons would use it for. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: OMINOUS PRIME looked at Quickstrike from atop a tree branch. He was \nwaiting for the Oblitercons. At last he might find some bots who were his \nequals, and a true fraction that understood his belives. All he could do now \nwas wait. ::::\n\n"}}
