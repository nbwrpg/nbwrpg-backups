Dewboy read it, please.\n\n--- Lynxiz / Lokk / Axis ---\n\nAxis brightens as he spies Windlord. &quot;There he is, right over there. \nSee?&quot; Having helped Lynxiz, Axis turns to talk to Seekker, \nsnorting in disagreement with his assessment of the battle. &quot;Bah, \nyou did almost nothing, and when you acctually did that \nsomething, it hurt US more than THEM. Hehe,&quot; Axis laughs once, \nthen shakes his head.\n\nLynxiz smiles as she spots Windlord as well. Nodding to Axis, the \nthanks him, and proceeds to make her way between missile \ncraters and other obstacles on the battle charred ground in front of \nthe Chivitron base. Heading towards Windlord, she waves to try to \nget his attention.\n\nLokk stops and turns slightly to regard Grounded, his face grimly \nshowing agreement. &quot;Yeah... that will be ugly... ugly be \nnecessary.&quot; He keeps heading back to the base, his path taking \nhim towards Windlord.\n\n\nOOC: Dewboy, your poll (the one below) needs to be altered. First \noff, Zardus doesn&#39;t alter or delete biased polls that aren&#39;t offensive. \nSecondly, he doesn&#39;t alter, and hasn&#39;t altered, biased polls so they \nrepresent the opposite bias (though i believe that it depends on \nwho&#39;s point of view you are coming from.). If the poll isn&#39;t offensive, \nthen Zardus most likely won&#39;t delete it. \n\nNext thing. Did you read all of my post entitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # \n41061)? If so, I will ask you again, did you read all of my post \nentitled &quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? If you still answer Yes, then I \nwill ask you for the last time, did you read all of my post entitled \n&quot;Dewboy&quot; (post # 41061)? Since you posted for your characters \nfinding the Rocak ship, the answer to my question is obviously no. \nNow you&#39;re going to have to hold (this time, don&#39;t actually post) \nyour posts regarding the Rocak ship. Then you must send the \ncouncil a detailed list of weapons, capabilities, size and capacity. \nOk? =)\n\nLast thing... Ok, I&#39;m done for now, until I think of something else to \nsay. =P\n\nOn 30 Jul 2001, at 11:19, nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Enter your vote today!
