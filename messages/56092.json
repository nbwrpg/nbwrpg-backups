Her mind swiming through the \npast and the present. So much had changed since her last times on \nearth. She saw the old wars. Battles from ages past. When she fought \nsnake bots, bears, rodents and teridactyles.  She saw a bot, whom she \nrecognized, but didn&#39;t remember his name. She watched him chase her \nup a hill, rying to catch her.  She saw the same bot get shot in a \nbattle. Her memory chip flipped to another scene. She was sitting in \na large room. She had several bots around her. She was giving them \ninstructions and telling them how to perform some tasks. She looked \nto see many faces, some she knew, others she didn&#39;t want to see. She \nthen saw another picture in her mind. She was in a base. the power \nhad been cut so only the emergency lights were on. She saw bodies of \nmaxmals and her fellow predacons sprawled on the floor. Killed in \nbattle. She had her pistol in hand and ready to use.  She was walking \ndown a corridor when she heard a loud whistling sound.  She then felt \nand heard a large explosion directly over head.  The floor shook and \nthe base started to colapse around her. A large part of the domed \nceiling came crashing down on top of her.  She screamed as metal and \nwires came down right on top of her. \n\nInside the Cr chamber, she could be heard muttering and then letting \nout a cry in her sleep. \n\nShe was thrust down through many floors of the base and finally into \nthe ground.  She then was in pitch black. She didn&#39;t see, but felt \nher memory.  She knew she was in pain, but couldn&#39;t feel it.  She \nknows she is burried and needs help to get out. She opened her \ncommlink, &quot;Megatron, help me.&quot;\n\nShe mutterrs in her sleep, &quot;Help me.&quot;   \n\n\n\n"}}
