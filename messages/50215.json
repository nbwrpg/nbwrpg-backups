We held the duel between Ragnar \nand Khan Vlad Ward of the Wolves on the hull of the warship Bloody \nFang, when a wave hit us.\n\nAt those memories, Ragnar trembled a bit.\n\nRagnar: I remember... the pain... I did not know what it was... The \nenergy must have merged us with our mechs. By the way, about Terra, it \nwas once the seat of the Star League government, and we Clansmen wish \nonly to reinstate it. The invasion of the Inner Sphere had this goal \nin mind. The first clan conquering Terra would become the IlClan, and \nits Khan the IlKhan... And we suspect that, like us, Khan Vlad \nsurvived and is somewhere. He is an ambitious one and would gladly \ndeclare himself the IlKhan, even if this is prehistoric earth. This \nwould have dire consequences once we get back to our people. You must \nhelp us!\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt; He was shocked when they transformed to humans.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Astonishing, your human.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was confused at the term Terra.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Terra?
