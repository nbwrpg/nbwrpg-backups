If you do you&#39;re wrong. Your stasis pod picked \nyour owl\n&gt; form because it best suited your function. If you attempt to change \nthat,\n&gt; you&#39;ll change your entire life. Lunarpine couldn&#39;t look her in the \nface\n&gt; because deep down inside he wanted this change.  He knew his \nreasons were\n&gt; wrong so he couldn&#39;t influence her.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If you change who you are, you&#39;ll could change how I feel about \nyou.&quot; I\n&gt; won&#39;t be held responsible for the change. Lunarpine stepped away \nleaving her\n&gt; to think about one question. &quot;If you change you&#39;ll lose all ability \nto fly\n&gt; free.

We are two different species right now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She knelt down and put the scanner on the floor.  She moved to \nface\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I know that a social creature, like the wolf, wil get lonely \nafter a\n&gt; &gt; while if there are no other creatures like it around.  I too am\n&gt; &gt; lonely for the other owls back in the old forest.  So I thought \nthat\n&gt; &gt; if I changed into a wolf, I could make you happier.&quot;  she smiled \nand\n&gt; &gt; looked at him with careing in her eyes.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I just wanted to make you happy.
