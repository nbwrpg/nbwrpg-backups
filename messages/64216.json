Alright, gimme just a few clicks...\n\nHe stood up and grabbed a handy stunstick, then started walking to the\nrecuperation area where Balistica was detained. He entered, hiding the\nstick as best as he could.\n\nJailor: So, gorgeous, you didn&#39;t want to join the ranks?\n\nBalistica was still a little stiff. It was no real wonder, though,\nwith the welcome she had received...\n\nBalistica: You mean that I chose to not kill my brothers and sisters?\nLooks like I didn&#39;t... And don&#39;t go calling me &quot;gorgeous&quot;.\n\nJailor: Well I be callin&#39; you wha&#39;ever I want, ya hear?\n\nHe rose the stunstick but was caught by a punch before the blow\nlanded. Balistica was faster than most bots, and even her movements\nreflected that. She grabbed the jailor&#39;s arm and broke it off, earning\nthe stunstick as a reward. Amidst the other&#39;s cries of pain, she\nstruck once with the weapon and shocked him out for a long time.\n\nBalistica: Great... Now I remember why I hate soldiers so much...\n\nShe got out of her cell, cluelessly trying to find her way out.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Troop:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood, sir, The femme will be a moving tramp to Silver\nWings... the male reprogramed to belive that we&#39;re the bes of the best&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The trooper did a militar greeting and he retired, he typed Jotunn&#39;s\n commands to Windlord&#39;s guards and get a coom link with Balistica&#39;s\nkeeper.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;HEY, Jotunn wants that we gives this treat to the girl&quot;he\ndownloaded the commands&quot;Let know when she&#39;s ready to start her\ntreat...

The Pacificus are a mere nuisance. If\n&gt;   we have something to fear, it is from the Silver Wings. They have the\n&gt;   army and the power to thwart our plans and foil our defences.\n\n\n\n"}}
