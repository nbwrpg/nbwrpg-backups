Zdorab steps out from behind some lead shielding and tries to wave\naway the smoke from directly in front of him. �I think we used a little too\nmuch power, eh?�\n\nSnitch climbed up on Zdorab�s shoulder. �Hmmmm� not enough power. Base of\ntarget blown up, but shield not penetrated. Never going to be able to\npenetrate photon particle field like that.�\n\nZdorab thought for a second, turning his head from side to side. �No� I don�\nt think punching through it is really what we need to go for. I think we\nneed something long range and that could pass through the field� maybe a\nthin stream of negatively charged xenon gas?�\n\n�Too much power you�d need. Energon buffer.�\n\n�Yeah� I see what you mean� and you�d lose a lot in the process too��\n\nThe two thought for a long moment. Snitch stroking the hair on his chin, and\nZdorab rubbing his thumb and index finger on his left hand together in a\ncircular pattern.\n\n�I�ve GOT IT!!!� Zdorab so surprised Snitch that the little monkey fell\nclean off Zdorab�s shoulder. �A Transwarp beam! Its powerful enough to be\nfired from long distances, and its out of faze with regular space time!�\n\nSnitch started jumping up and down excitedly, clapping his hands. �With\ncarry on internal particle beam could cut through cull and spread ionic\ninterference with electrical currents!�\n\n�But,� he made Snitch stop jumping up and down with his sudden seriousness.\n�A) it would be extremely detectable. And two��\n\n�B.�\n\n�Yes, B) it would coast an butt load of energy. Depending on range it could\nonly have three to fourteen shots total before the cell would need to be\nreplaced.�\n\n�Quantum displacement engine?�\n\n�No� I was thinking more of a� Laser guide. Let it follow a field of\nnegitive ions to the target. It would take a nano-click more, but one hell\nof a lot less energy. One quick blast instead of a continuous stream.�\n\n�Line of sight.�\n\n�Well, yeah, that would restrict the range a little bit, but it�s better\nthan only being able to use it a couple of times.�\n\nZdorab and Snitch both shrug, and then go back to work, starting by cleaning\nup the clearing before any potential customers arrive.\n\n\n\n"}}
