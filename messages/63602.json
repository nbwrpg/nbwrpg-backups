Her knew shiney chocolate brown\nskin glistened in the room lights.  Her red optics glowed with pride\nas her spider legs fanned out behind her giving a fan like appearence,\nonly to enhance her regal stance.  The new built in shields gave only\nthe slightest vibration when activated and she had new photosonic\npistol blasters on her hips.  The new blasters could, if focused on a\nsingle point long enough, melt most metals since it not only used\nenergy, but sound to create it&#39;s blasts, disrupting an object on an\natomic level.  Her new venom was even more potent, and her webs were\nnow three times thier strength.  Despite the improvements, she still\ncould mix web and venom to create explosives. BUt the one drawback to\nall this was that her mech fluid was very acidic and would eventually\ndisintegrate her internal systems. But no one could of her long term\ndeath sentence, not her or her up grader. \n\nShe showed her new form proudly. &quot;I hope you like it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nIn nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras was carefully watching  a planet-like thing hologram as if he\nwas trying to find something &quot;What&#39;s happens?&quot; said the male without\nemotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor walked towads Hydras and said &quot;Just look&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras moved his eyes towars Reclusa and was impressed &quot;I see,\nlittle one&quot; hissed the male&quot;That you have a new look&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Description please :D\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
