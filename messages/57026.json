He sipped from his glass of energin in hand.  Dracon saw\nKrhinos walk into the Mess Hall, and instantly made a gesture by\ntipping his glass forward in a salute.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;G&#39;Day, Captain...&quot; he said solemnly, &quot;how fares our search, might I\nask?&quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Nic \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, June 02, 2003 9:33 PM\n&gt;   Subject: The new Contract\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Captain Krhinos is requested in room 1000, Captain Krhinos&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   The huge workman entered the elevator and punched a button. It took\n&gt;   him straight at the top stair of the huge space station. He\n&gt;   disembarked and walked into the office of Tycoon, his entrepreneur\nboss.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tycoon: Hi Krhinos. Sit down please. You&#39;ve got a new mission!\nEnergon?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: Just a small glass, you know I&#39;m trying to quit... So, what&#39;s\n&gt;   the new deal? The Tripredacus again?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tycoon: Not this time. (He poured the liquid energon in two small\n&gt;   glasses and handed one to his employee.) They&#39;ve offered great\n&gt;   contracts, but they&#39;re ending their invasion soon. They don&#39;t need any\n&gt;   more ore. (He sipped a little from his cup) This contractor wished to\n&gt;   remain anonymous, but it&#39;s going to be one of our biggest offer yet.\n&gt;   Basically, we have been given the mining rights for a whole planet!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos nearly choked on his energon. A planet! StarDrill Inc would\n&gt;   become the most profitable company in the whole system!\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: You serious, Tyke?!? A planet!? Which one just for fun?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tycoon smiled grimly.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tycoon: Earth! We have the rights to mine Earth! The human cradle\n&gt;   itself! (Seeing Krhinos&#39;s unbelieving face, he held a hand up.) Now,\n&gt;   now... It&#39;s the prehistoric Earth, not that rebellious headquarter of\n&gt;   today&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: What are we looking for? Iron? Radium?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Tycoon: All you can find! You get a full mobile mining base that you\n&gt;   can keep in orbit, a small outpost on the planet from which you can\n&gt;   ship the resources, I&#39;ll even grant you that Mammoth Drill you love so\n&gt;   much. In short, do your best! Oh... I almost forgot... I got you a few\n&gt;   mercenaries to bring along. They should be in the Mess Hall by now.\n&gt;   Take &#39;em along. They&#39;ll help you a lot, it&#39;s on their contract. If it\n&gt;   isn&#39;t, just pay them on the company&#39;s account.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Krhinos: Will do, Boss. Thanks a lot! I&#39; make this mission pay up!\n&gt; \n&gt;   The massive bot stood up, finished his drink in a nano and saluted\n&gt;   Tycoon one last time before going to the Mess Hall. It was the kind of\n&gt;   bar where he&#39;d expect anything, from the lowly pleasure bots to the\n&gt;   drunken brawls. He looked around, trying to find some relatively fresh\n&gt;   mercs in the crowd...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo! Groups Sponsor \n&gt;        \n&gt;        \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
