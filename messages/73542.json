He watches attentively and at that moment, the creature lifts its head=\r\n. It was another dragon. Yet this one was a bit smaller than he was, but th=\r\ne same coloration. He takes note of its slender shape. It was female. She l=\r\nooks to him as he looks to her. She slowly approaches him and they look gen=\r\ntly to each other like brother and sister. In draconic vocalization, Tucson=\r\n explains who he is and his dilemma. She intern rumbles back and bows her h=\r\nead. She nods as he does.
