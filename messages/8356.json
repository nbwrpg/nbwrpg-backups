The rifle and foot connected to her at the \nsame time. She flew back and fell to the ground.  She didn&#39;t have \nmuch energy left and couldn&#39;t take much more of a beating.  She \nopened her commlink. &quot;If any Maximal can hear me, there are three \nPreds heading for the Ark. Protect the Ark. Please, If you can home \nin on my signal. I need help.&quot; She got up and looked at the three \nbots. Her side was dripping mech fluid.  Her jaw swelling from the \nkick.  Her body pulsing in pain, she charged again.  She slashed at \nPredator aiming for his face. She tried to rip out his eyes and slash \nthe rest of his face. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Imprisoner/Predator/Choran:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Predator slammed on his back, trying to hold Savanna&#39;s claws at \nbay, which \n&gt; were cutting him up.\n&gt; &quot;Get it off, get it off, get it off!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran raised the barrel of his rifle to point at Savanna&#39;s back, \nbut \n&gt; Imprisoner shook his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran swung the laser rifle hard at Savanna&#39;s left side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner stepped up to Predator, sending a foot at Savanna&#39;s face.\n\n\n"}}
