If the Predacons are really \nas territorial as they were back on Ingus, they should come soon \nenough. Jetstorm, Anachronox, you will patrol the area. I will watch \ntheir base and any signs of hostility.\n\nJetstorm transforms to hawk mode and takes off, circling over the \narea. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -- Anachronox --\n&gt; \n&gt; Anachronox stands, and yells up to Prophetus, &quot;I see no signs of \n&gt; activity, requesting orders for how to proceed.&quot; He had been hoping \n&gt; to engage in combat, but that could wait.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Guess they don&#39;t care about us...

UNITED!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A blinding ball of light formed around them. After a moment, a \n&gt; huge \n&gt; &gt; being stood up from it, the light moving along and fading. He \n&gt; stood 35 \n&gt; &gt; feet tall, had lion-like legs, a bladed tail, clawed hands and a \n&gt; white \n&gt; &gt; metallic body. His face reminded of the three Prophets, yet of \n&gt; none at \n&gt; &gt; the same time. His voice was low and loud.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prophetus: Anachronox, give me a status report.\n\n\n"}}
