She \nrebounded off the ground and onto the tip of the bots tail. She shook her \nhead, and fluttered so she was looking straight at the tip of his tauil. Her \nmouth opened wide and she bit down on it and began to suck hard. Meanwhile \nshe fluttered over to Tavatron, with the bots taill in her mouth and wings \ngoing full speed, she looked at the female and made little sucking noises \nwhile waiting for the bot to notice her.*\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Carnage Blood&quot; &lt;Carnage@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Dinobot.\n&gt;Date: 8 Feb 2001 05:19:29 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;( Carnage: On the contrery, Alloran. Only the velociraptor is 3 feet tall, \n&gt;as of lesser raptors may be smaller but others range from 6 to 20 (6 meters \n&gt;long.) In which such a size belongs to the Utahraptor. However, if it is \n&gt;only Veloci you are speaking then you are correct.)\n&gt;\n&gt;** Dinobot snarled in annoyance as the black ball of fur clung more \n&gt;desperately to his snout, being stubborn and not riding itself if the spot \n&gt;which it chose to sit. Try as he might to throw it from it�s perch, it was \n&gt;only obvious now that it must die to remove it. And such a choice was very \n&gt;acceptable to a warrior with his attitude and insight�as well as the fact \n&gt;that he was fed up of dealing with this and felt it was time to come to a \n&gt;complete stop.    Dinobot growled as he moved a clawed hand towards his \n&gt;snout but behind the creature as to not agitate it and only dig it�s \n&gt;uneventful claws deeper, his eyes narrowed and trained steadily upon the \n&gt;target.\n&gt;It annoyed him greatly, this thing, since it had fallen from the atmosphere \n&gt;and onto his snout by fate�s chance.  Embarrassing him and sparking his \n&gt;aggression, those two factors never existing together since he could \n&gt;remember. But it would all end now.\n&gt;With his claws just so that they sat stationed less then an inch from the \n&gt;back of the creature, never removing his stare from it and never a muscle \n&gt;did twitch.. Yet the transmetal tendons working and muscles bunching for \n&gt;the movement of the strike in that one arm, deadly weapons meant for \n&gt;defeating more power then this tiny being appeared to have in it�s entire \n&gt;form. So close that armor brushed black fur but the strike had already been \n&gt;activated, fingers stretched with massive power to enfold the being into \n&gt;the palm and then close around it with programmed precision and timing. \n&gt;Clenching with life exterminating force to destroy the pest and then swing \n&gt;away to be rid of it and throw the dead being from it�s death trap and onto \n&gt;the solid ground with enough structure shattering velocity that it could \n&gt;not surely survive if it had from the claws.\n&gt;And so Dinobot stood, drawing back his arm but not watching to see any dust \n&gt;appear from the impact of the creature�if he had gotten it. Yet no feeling \n&gt;of tiny claws plagued his snout any longer and, if my some merical,  it \n&gt;survived�he would simply transform and squish it between gears. Though he \n&gt;turned away from the impact site and glared questioningly towards the \n&gt;fembot who sat upon her knees where she has stood upon her feet moments \n&gt;before, breathing heavily and holding her head in her hands.   Dinobot was \n&gt;puzzled; was she damaged that extensively?\n&gt;Looking at Tavatron more closely he doubted it,  with no mechfluid or burn \n&gt;marks from a charge anywhere near her skull. However, could it be \n&gt;shellshock?\n&gt;Many a good soldier eventually became insane because their nervous system \n&gt;could take the death and sound of explosions no longer, becoming delirious \n&gt;and sometimes turning to destroy their own faction.\n&gt;He growled at the thought, watching as the tension in Tavatron�s body eased \n&gt;after a while and she became calmer. But a feeling that it was not over \n&gt;remained. Something was wrong and there was no hiding it from the senses of \n&gt;his beast mode, every chemical it picked up from Tavatron�s body clearly \n&gt;stating her stress.. However, finding out from her was the only path to \n&gt;discovering the whole truth, and he was puzzled enough to search for it.\n&gt;Dinobot approached Tavatron and looked down at her, lifting a brow-plate \n&gt;and tilting his head to the side at a slight angle. His expression readless \n&gt;and blank, as cold and emotionless as it had always been. Her was \n&gt;concerned�to an extent but he wanted to know the problem most of all. There \n&gt;was time enough for further concern once he knew what this was all about.   \n&gt;He growled.** � What is it?� ** a reasonable question for expecting a \n&gt;reasonable answer. However, he didn�t quite expect any answer from her at \n&gt;all, but warriors were famously known for being persistent in their search \n&gt;for answers.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://AnimeNation.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
