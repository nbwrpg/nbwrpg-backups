I agree with you on all of \nthis. I know that the extraction of Nightlight will have to be a \nforcefull one. Once we recieve word that Battera is ready to leave \nwith Nightlight, I plan a full scale assualt on the Predacon base to \nact as a distraction...\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus almost get s an evil grin.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: And our chance for revenge. Yggdrasil and I have \nalready been working on ways to safely reprogram her.

It was an attemp to get Nightlight back. Problem is \nin \n&gt; my personal point of view, that regarding that she&#39;s \nreprogramed... \n&gt; she won&#39;t came here voluntary, even perhaps she would try to \nresist \n&gt; and fight... So,... it&#39;s dificult to say... Practically... we have \n&gt; to kidnape her...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord felt in silence a while and encourage himself and \n&gt; continue &quot;I practically suggested Battera (That&#39;s voluntary&#39;s \nname) \n&gt; to sedat her and take her off the base...

That lead us to other point: \n&gt; after the capture, what should we do? We can&#39;t let Nightlight be \n&gt; free here and I guess that you don&#39;t like see her inside a cell, \nbut \n&gt; I guess that reporgramation might take a lot time if that scum \nnamed \n&gt; Perceptor told the true about that program... That&#39;s all, Sir, If \nI \n&gt; did something wrong when I suggest Battera sedate Nightlight, I&#39;m \n&gt; sorry...
