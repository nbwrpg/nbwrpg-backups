Well, that was a first, she sighed and \ncontinued to walk towards the Maximal base&#39;s old location. She didn&#39;t know \nabout real casualties but she had her memories.*\n\n&quot; Once we get to the Maximals they can tell you who died and who lived, \nhowever, I can say this: many perished thanks to Megatron&#39;s insane causes.&quot;\n\n* Carnage sighed, she wished that she could tell Cyber Claw more but there \nwas no time for that...not now. She looked around as they came to the area \nwhere the Axalon once stood, there was nothing left but a slid mark where \nthe ship had slid and plummeted into the water below.\nCarnage growled, there was nothing left...not here.\nShe knew that there had to be Maximals and she knew that the signatures that \nshe was scanning were them...but probably not the same ones that she had \nonce fought against.*\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Dinobot glanced as Tavatron had come back into the room, munching on food \ncubes. He hadn&#39;t moved from the spot in front of the door, he had been \nthinking about that secret, if Tavatron knew it, if she did then if she \nwould teach it to him, and if he would be willing to learn.\nDinobot growled as he brought his hand to his chest and looked across the \nbridge as his repair system kicked in, the green energy coil from his spark \nwrapping around his and repairing his hand.\nHe looked at it once it had been healed, whom ever had built this body had \nmade it aquipped with almost everything he could possibly need.\n(doesn&#39;t know that Megs made it.)\nDinobot closed the door of the room and walked across the bridge, he passed \nTavatron and made his way to the doors of the Ark. The urge to be out of the \nbase and out in the open was to strong to ignore, he had to get out and away \nfrom the confines of the ship.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
