But then, how do we do this? \nYou can give a bot a body, but a mind?&quot; She shook her head. \n&quot;Something about that..I don&#39;t like.  If I had found out that you had \nmade me, created my to be perfect in body, I would be gratefull and \nshow great loyalty.  But if I found that you made my mind to think \ntha way that you programmed, that my thoughts were not truely my own, \nI&#39;d go balistic.  No,  There has to be another way.&quot;  She thought, \nthen her eyes lit up as the idea ran across her mind,&quot;THAT&#39;S IT!&quot;  we \ndon&#39;t program it. We teach it.  Give the bot the body of the perfect \nwarrior,but the innocent mind of a child.  Then we teach it was we \nwant it to know.  Then it will grow and learn on it&#39;s own, not just \nobey a program. but we can program it to be open minded, show \ntenancies to be caring, wanting to learn, appreciate learning and \nscientific learning.&quot;  She was smiling really hard at this. \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk was frustrated by the annoying call from Squizzy, she was \nso close\n&gt; to finding a way into the classified files. She stopped her selfish \nthoughts\n&gt; and reminded herself on why she was there. She was there to help \nher father\n&gt; find a way to unite the factions, not hack files. Sheshut down the \ncomputer,\n&gt; stood up and started toward the door. &quot;I&#39;m on my way&quot; She hoped the \nbot\n&gt; wasn&#39;t to badly hurt she was a science bot not a doctor. It was \njust more\n&gt; DNA to her regaurdless of the bots faction it still had DNA and \nthat made it\n&gt; worth helping.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; how bad is it?&quot; She asked as she entered the CR room, the bot \ndidn&#39;t look\n&gt; to injured just a damaged leg. the CR chamber should be able to \nhandle the\n&gt; damage easy enough so she didn&#39;t worry to much. She aproached \nSquizzy with\n&gt; caution knowing how mongooses loved Hawks.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;You know, the more I think about it, the more I like your idea of \nmaking\n&gt; the bots to better suit  the eco system around here.&quot; Squizzy said \nas Lady\n&gt; Hawk aproached &quot; but even with\n&gt; the perfect body, it&#39;s the mond of the bot that makes me cringe. \nHow can we\n&gt; make a bot&#39;s mind so he or she will be nature oriented?&quot; The young \nbots\n&gt; points were a valid concern, A concern that Veratis had thought of \nmultiple\n&gt; times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawkchose her words carefully so she didn&#39;t reveal the full \nidea. &quot;That\n&gt; is the difference between who I want to obtain the technology and \nwho would\n&gt; abuse the technology.&quot;  She watched the readings on the CR chamber \nwondering\n&gt; what the new bot knew about this war.&quot;If the technology was abused \nwe&#39;d just\n&gt; have a more violent form of war to fight. No instincts to induce \nfear means\n&gt; no fear to hold a bot back.&quot; she shuddered to think about what \nZardus would\n&gt; do with the technology but knew that when her fathers goal was \nreached there\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be anything to worry about.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
