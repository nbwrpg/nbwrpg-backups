He wasn&#39;t going to go any further than the first \nset \n&gt; of trees. He looked around. He could smell Rowdy Wolf. His flute \n&gt; playing had stopped. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur saw a figure below. It was a big figure, heavy \nshouldered. \n&gt; He transformed to robot mode and lowered down to it. It was Rowdy \n&gt; Wolf, but something was different. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf turned his head to Terrorsaur and stared at him coldly. \nOn \n&gt; the side of his face, there was a plate of mismatching metal \nattached \n&gt; to it, like someone wiht a bad skill in repairing. There was also a \n&gt; mess of metal parts on his left arm. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Rowdy Wolf?&quot; Terrorsaur said, studying Rowdy Wolf. &quot;What happened?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I stayed,&quot; he replied. &quot;I risked my life for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorsaur squinted. There was something in the air, and it didn&#39;t \n&gt; feel right. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, are you damaged?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf pulled his arm up, armed with his rifle. &quot;Where is \n&gt; Quickstrike?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Terrorsaur replied. &quot;I think he&#39;s dead. You see, \n&gt; there was a battle and he was possible caught.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf eyed him for a short while. &quot;Tell Megatron I want to \nspeak \n&gt; to him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can show you to him,&quot; Terrorsaur commented. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Bring him here!&quot; Rowdy Wolf shouted, then fired.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron lifted his head, hearing a shot. There was silence a few \n&gt; seconds after, then another shot. It sounded like Terrorsaur&#39;s \nmarks. \n&gt; There was another moment of silence. \n&gt; \n&gt; He looked around. He saw something falling towards him. It was a \n&gt; bright. Within the moment, he saw it was Terrorsaur. His metal body \n&gt; slammed into the ground and slid past KitKat and himself. There was \n&gt; heavy damage to his shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He wants to talk to you,&quot; Terrorsaur said to Megatron, only \nlifting \n&gt; his head.\n\n\n"}}
