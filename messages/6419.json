Yes, she had transformed into R mode.\n\n* Iron Raptor growled softly as she lay on the cold floor, a large puddle of mech fluid still forming around her. Still conscious but battered she tried to raise herself from the floor, fluid running down her arms. It was then that she suddenly fell to the floor again, Hiss�s kicks sending waves of sharp pains through her rib cage.\nIt was then that she wished that she was still in that weird beast mode, powerful enough to rip his kicking leg right off his body! But she was not; the shock of the hit against the wall had brought her robot mode to its senses and had transformed, leaving the rage of both beat modes behind.\nShe then felt somebot begin to drag her to a corner, slightly looking up and seeing Scattershot. There was one word that escaped her mouth. *\n\n� Dead.�\n\n* It was true, if she was in any better shape she would kill him, but she wasn�t. Just waiting until she healed, then she would find out how she activated that weird beast mode again�then they�d pay!\nBut just after he had left her to slump against the far corner she then looked over, only to see him slammed into the bars by�Tigerhawk?!\nHow in the Pit did he get in, the hole in the wall then simply answering her question. But as she saw him begin to fight she silently cursed towards him, &lt; Tigerhawk, you dolt! You�ll get us all killed!&gt;\nBut there was nothing that she could do, it was already too late.\nBut it was then that she suddenly felt herself grabbed by the neck, the cold beryl of Dark One�s gun pressing to her head. With a quick glance she looked over and saw Tavatron in the same situation, no real hope for either of them. Both damaged.\nBut she then did something that she thought that she could no longer do, so much mech fluid lost due to the past charges. She stood. Yes, Dark One�s gun was still pressed to her head but the grip on her neck became a little more tolerable. She looked to Tigerhawk, her voice slightly strained�the first time using it since she had transformed back into R mode.*\n\n� Stand down, Tigerhawk.�\n\n* She knew that he out ranked her greatly, but if he did not he would cost the lives of them all.*\n\n� Stand down or you�ll kill us all!�\n\n* Iron Raptor would have bowed her head if it wasn�t for Dark One holding her by the neck, it feeling like it couldn�t hold her head up any longer. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
