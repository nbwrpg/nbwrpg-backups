His tail straight\n&gt; out in back of him like a rudder, he sounds another roar, to be sure someone\n&gt; on the other end hears him.  It rumbles like thunder clapping the land at a\n&gt; very close proximity.  The dragon was on his way home, and back to the land\n&gt; he had vowed to protect.\n&gt;\n&gt; The soul of the old dragon kindles brightly within him, and it appeared that\n&gt; he was unbothered by obsticles however difficult they may prove.  A burst of\n&gt; bravory with a bit of tenacity and determination, urges him forward on his\n&gt; journey to set things right once again.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTUSCON&#39;S first impression of this new area would be one of darkness,\nand then one of open space. It only takes moments for sensors and\nreceptors to adjust to these new surroundings revealing a rather large\ncave of some sort. The ceiling of the cave was perhaps 15 or 20 meters\nin the air, however there long spikes hanging down from it making any\nsort of flight dangerous for one as large as TUSCON.\n\nThe ground was generally smooth and the walls, while rough looked\nstable and strong, all of it in a generally natural state. The only\nother visible feature in this place was a flickering light at the\nother end of the cave, which was several hundred meters away.\n\nThe portal behind TUSCON flickered for a moment as BIG CONVOY stepped\nthrough and then went dark and then began to fade away.\n\n&quot;Well that does it.&quot; BREAK said as he and MACH KICK were climbing off\nof TUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;Out of the frying pan and into the whatever we have\nthere.&quot;\n\nMACH KICK glanced back at the door, &quot;Well we can&#39;t stay here, they\nmight find a way to fix that thing.&quot;\n\nCONVOY grunted as he hefted his rather large rifle on his shoulder as\nhe looked around. &quot;It looks like there is only one way to go now.&quot; He\nglanced at TUSCON, &quot;You still up for this?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
