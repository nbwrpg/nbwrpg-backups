The shot hit her in the \nshoulder as she tried to jump off the table.  She fell to the floor \nand drew her own gun.  Her left arm just hung down at her side, \ntotally numb.  She turned the table over and used it as a shield.  \nShe knelt down behind the table and drew her own quazar pistol. &quot;You \nknow, it&#39;s a shame you had to do that. I thought you were rather \ncute.&quot;  she jumped up, fired on Devilduer and ducked behind the \ntable.  She didn&#39;t know the lay out of the ship or how to get out.  \nShe would have to get creative on her escape plan.  She looked around \nthe room and saw a ventalator shaft opening near the ceiling.  She \nhad to get to it.  She shot at the vent cover and watched it fall to \nthe ground.  She then took out her small crossbow with a little pully \nassembly on it. She fired and the arrow stuck in the ceiling.  She \nthen pulled the trigger on the crossbow and it hoisted her up towards \nthe vent.  &quot;Hate to chat and run my friend, but I&#39;m afraid I over \nstayed my welcome.&quot;  She twisted around and dove into the vent shaft.\nShe transformed into rattle snake mode and slithered around down the \nshaft.  SHe flicked her tongue to try to catch the scent of fresh air \nfrom outside, but didn&#39;t.  She knew she would get lost int he vent \nsystem if she wasn&#39;t too careful.  She slithered along the vent shaft \nuntill she came to a cross in the shaft.  She looked in all \ndirections, trying to find her way out.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m gonna check your damages,&quot; DevilDuer says, tapping a few keys \non a \n&gt; console to prepare the computer to reprogramm a bot, &quot;Now hold \nstill, this \n&gt; won&#39;t hurt.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He suddenly brings up his stun gun, now completely recharged, and \nfires it at \n&gt; Diamond.\n\n\n"}}
