Soon he knew the location\nand\n&gt; weaponry of every Decepticon in the area.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You might wanna go out there and fight them, Rubble, we&#39;re under\nattack.&quot;\n&gt; he says through a speaker to Rubble, who thanks him and runs out of the\n&gt; base. Cyndro reroutes more power to the shields, and then activates the\n&gt; defences.\n&gt;\n&gt; The round plate on top of the Element flashed several times, and then a\n&gt; deafening screech was emmited over all comm frequencees other than\nthe ones\n&gt; that the Maximals were using. After a few seconds, the screech shut\noff, and\n&gt; a jamming signal was sent out to disable any communications that the\nenemies\n&gt; might have. During the screech, most of the weapons on the Element\nfired at\n&gt; the hopefully distracted bots, sending four EMP blasts, one missile,\nand\n&gt; five plasma shots at each one, other than the ones that were\nshielded by the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire (I think FireBlade is the only one shielded :).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mantle spun around when all the enemies arrived, and was immediately\nready\n&gt; for battle. He flew into the air and stretched out both arms. A\nmissile flew\n&gt; out of each arm, both of them mentally guided by Mantle to hit\n&gt; Rippersnapper. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mantle could see Aqua\nfiring\n&gt; his spear gun at Flesh Ripper, the same bot that he had tried to get\nduring\n&gt; the last battle. Near him, Cinder was already firing at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he hoped that she\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and then we&#39;ll form\n&gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his team over the\n&gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with his missile\nlauncher\n&gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage. Mist flew by above him, firing three\n&gt; charges down at Autofire.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
