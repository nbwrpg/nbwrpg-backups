If something =\r\nwere to jump out at them, he&#39;d be a bit vunlerable in vehicle form.  To kee=\r\np in touch with what ever was out there, he sends a few more wide range son=\r\nar signals to see if any of them bounced off any objects or anyone who coul=\r\nd be within the area.  The ping resonating from the sonar waves, comes back=\r\n loud and clear.  It was straight ahead.  He keeps on his course, all headl=\r\nights off, to reduce the chance of being discovered.  \n\n&quot;Just like old time=\r\ns.  Except now, it&#39;s not the Decepticons we need to be concerned with.  I t=\r\nhrew out a few more sonar waves, and the signal I got back was very strong.=\r\n  Sounded as if the signal bounced off of a metallic object, maybe a struct=\r\nure, building, large aircraft, or vehicle for that matter.  But the signal =\r\nis unfamilliar to me.  It sounded a tad different when it came back.&quot;\n\nOut =\r\nof curiosity, he puts a hand out in front of him, and extends his palm to f=\r\neel the currents of air going through his fingers.  It was his way of readi=\r\nng residual energy which may have been released along with the signal.  Eve=\r\nn though it wasn&#39;t visible, he senses a vibration in his hand.  The loss of=\r\n sight also enabled him to touch things with more sensitivity than normal. =\r\n \n\n&quot; I&#39;m picking up an unknown energy signature through residual feedback. =\r\nRavenchief, Guardia, Talon, I don&#39;t have good feelings about this. I think =\r\nit&#39;s best if you back me up, and let me go in first.  I can take a good bea=\r\nting if I have to.  All right, Lord Perseus is right, caution is a must.&quot; \n=\r\n\nHe bravely takes slow and silent steps ahead of his comrades, and continue=\r\ns walking forward.  He loads the cross bow, and then keeps it at the ready.=\r\n   As an Autobot, he took an oath to protect the innocent. Even if it meant=\r\n risking his own spark to do so.  He wasn&#39;t afraid to be obliterated if it =\r\nhappened so be it.  He felt better as to his decision to go in first, to en=\r\nsure the saftey of his Maximal comrades.  After all, it was what Autobots d=\r\nid for centuries, and he was no different than any of them.\n--- In nbwrpg@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon:\n&gt; \n&gt; Talon followed Guard=\r\nia, with her blaster ready for anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: sorry for suddenly po=\r\nps her but I liked to start to come back to action right now\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFrom: Kraftlos \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 24, 2009 12:54 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: The Old Maximal Base\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Guardia toggle=\r\nd her radio and leaned slightly.  &quot;It appears we&#39;ve run into something.
