Take heart, this \n&gt;&gt; is for the best, and I know it will help Rodimus immensely. Something \n&gt;&gt; inside me is telling me so.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He enters the room and gets his bearings so is not to knock anything over \n&gt;&gt; or trip over anyone. His sensors quickly leading him to Rodimus as he \n&gt;&gt; finds his way over to where he lies. He then nods to Stanton and the \n&gt;&gt; others.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;All right, tell me what I have to do and I will do it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He turns his head toward Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Hang in there Rodimus, I&#39;m comming. I promised to save you and I will \n&gt;&gt; save you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Tuscon entered the room Santon stepped out and guided him over\n&gt; towards the bed. At the same time Legacy slid over another operating\n&gt; bed so that it lay next to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump, who was still continuing to work freed another small portion of\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; frame and he quickly attached power allocation cables to the\n&gt; spot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon nodded, satisfied at Bump&#39;s progress and then turned back to\n&gt; Tuscon, &quot;Rodimus&#39; life signs are beginning to fail. We will need you\n&gt; to continue giving your unique spark energy to him. This would give us\n&gt; more time to complete this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump looked up from his position over Rodimus, &quot;The problem is we\n&gt; don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s draining him, and we don&#39;t know what risk\n&gt; there is to you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon looked back at Tuscon, &quot;He&#39;s right. If you don&#39;t want to do\n&gt; this, we will understand. But if you do, then lie back and I will\n&gt; connect you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *    *     *     *     *\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile in the observation room Silverbolt stood once again silently\n&gt; observing Rodimus, his own optics dark and worried as Airhammer and\n&gt; Noctorro stood next to him. &quot;Have no fear Lady Talon.&quot; Silverbolt\n&gt; said, his voice confident, &quot;The valiant Tuscon Prime will prevail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While Silverbolt seemed confident and assured, Airhammer and Noctorro\n&gt; seemed to wear more worried expressions.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
