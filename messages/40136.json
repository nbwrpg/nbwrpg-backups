Simply getting off planet had been a \nstruggle. All of the bots have known the treachary of the \nTripredacus council, and knowing that a Decepticon vessel had \nfollowed them made them uneasy. Pacifix prepares to speak. He \nbangs his gauntlets together. &quot;Fellow Autobots,&quot; He pauses for a \nmoment, &quot;Welcome to whatever planet we are on. As you probably \nalready know, we are here to prevent the Predacons, from gaining \nan advantageous situation here, or anywhere we may find them.&quot; \nAgain, he pauses for effect. &quot;For the next while, you will probably \nparticipate in some of the hardest trials and tribulations while \nfighting the Decepticons. Prepare youselves.&quot; He pauses again to \nlet his words sink in.\n\nCrossroads listens intently to his leader, and fellow Autobot. He \nnods at Pacifix&#39;s points, knowing that they are important.\n\n"}}
