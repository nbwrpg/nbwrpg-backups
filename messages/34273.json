What are you doing coming back towards the Cybertronian\nFire?\n\nArrow: Your Radicons took something of the Chivtrons. I&#39;m going to take\nsomething of theirs.\n\nInstrat: Wha---wha---what do you plan to take?\n\nArrow: Something important. SomeONE important.\n\nInstrat: A prisoner?\n\nArrow: I take no prisoners.\n\nInstrat: Oohhh.\n\nArrow: I kill instead.\n\nInstrat: What makes you think you can kill me?\n\nInstrat gave a brief call of distress by entering a code into her commlink.\nThe Radicons heard it and started towards the coordinates provided.\n\nArrow: You hurt the wildlife. Now you die.\n\nArrow quickly sweeped Instrat up and locked on his deadly armbar-headlock\nand keeping it on until there was a crack sound. There was no resisting.\n\nArrow: Your way of fighting has been passed down to someone else, now.\n\nArrow walked away from the beheaded Instrat as the Radicons headed quickly\ntowards the position. They weren&#39;t that far away, since they just left the\nChivtron base. Arrow already quickly got out of sight and ran back towards\nthe Chivtron base. Train Wreck pulled up, did his transform and drop of\npassengers maneuver, and and kneeled down by Instrat.\n\nTrain Wreck: Why....Why did this happen?\n\nStranato: Victim of the crossface.\n\nTrain Wreck was crying, now.\n\nAirbomber: That&#39;s it man, no more! First my brother, then Instrat, when will\nthis madman stop? He was killing on Cybertron and now he&#39;s still killing\nnow? He&#39;s a maniac, amigos, and he must be killed. We&#39;re going back to the\nChivtron base. This time we kill everyone there! EVERYONE!\n\nDeemos: Did I hear you right? You&#39;re going to kill the Chivtrons?\n\nStranato: Yeah, we are. Arrow crossed the line and he&#39;s one of them now!\n\nTrain Wreck: He has commited such a violent and dirty crime against\nhumanity. He will bend under the violence and rage of us, now.\n\nTrain Wreck was still crying.\n\nDeemos: In other words, that dead one there was your girlfriend.\n\nTrain Wreck starts sobbing loudly and Stranato tries comforting him.\n\nAirbomber: Yeah! Those Chivtrons are DEAD! Care to join us for their\ngutting?\n\nDeemos: Certainly. I could use some fun about now. If I would have known I&#39;d\nmeet you guys, I would have brought my son, Sharpedge.\n\nAirbomber: Call him, we&#39;re going to tear that base up so bad and not one\nsoul there will survive! Not even one! So we need some extra men.\n\nDeemos; Thank you, can we wait for him?\n\nAirbomber: Yeah, pal, we&#39;ll wait for your son.\n\nDeemos calls Sharpedge on his commlink.\n\nDeemos: Hey, Sharpedge. I&#39;m about to fight. I&#39;ve joined up with these 3\nrogue Maximals, and we&#39;re going to attack the Chivtrons. Want to join us?\nIt&#39;ll be fun...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 11, 2001 12:54 AM\nSubject: Re: Chivtrons...\n\n\n&gt; OOC she could have run inside the forest... enought to lost the way\n&gt; to come back\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: They moved that far?
