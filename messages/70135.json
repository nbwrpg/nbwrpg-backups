Tucson Prime was very good \n&gt;&gt; at it, although his temper was something that he needed to work on. He \n&gt;&gt; then turns his head away from the source of the sound.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; That&#39;s it, I&#39;m tired of talking to you. I&#39;ve told you as it is, you \n&gt;&gt; dont&#39; like it, that&#39;s tough scrap.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus stood up glaring at the screen his mouth open wide in anger!\n&gt; His lips moved but for a second nothing came out.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;YOU IDIOT!&quot; he said as he finally found his voice. &quot;YOU HELP ME? HOW\n&gt; WILL YOU DO THAT?!?&quot; Rodimus raged for a moment as he pounded on the\n&gt; panel, dust and flakes of debris leaped on the floor from the force of\n&gt; his actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally he sat down as a smile reappeared on his face as he got his\n&gt; emotions back under control, &quot;You&#39;re going to help me from the pit\n&gt; that you&#39;re in?&quot; He chuckled to himself, &quot;The matrix, what good is\n&gt; that goiong to do anyone?&quot; he said, his voice almost thoughtful. &quot;I .\n&gt; . I . . &quot; He stumbled for a second and then continued, &quot;I mean you\n&gt; lost it, and now you have nothing to show buyt the darkness of that\n&gt; pit you&#39;re in.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus smiled as he leaned back in the chair, proping his feet up on\n&gt; the panel. However as self satisfied he felt, there was a strange\n&gt; feeling in the pit of his stomach, one he was begining to feel more\n&gt; and more often when ever he talked with this Tuscon fellow. His smile\n&gt; dimmed a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
