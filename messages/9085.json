The visions all swirled \naround her.  She saw friends and foe alike around her. It was almost \ntoo much to take at once.  She cried out in her mind.\nShe saw visions and memoried that had been long forgotten and not \nwanting to remember them.  She felt like she was drowning.\nShe wanted it to stop, but the visions and memories just kept \nreaching out to her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, crow_lord@h... wrote:\n&gt; Scopronok \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scopronok takes out some wire and plug them into his Laptop.
