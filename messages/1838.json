He&#39;s \nseen her before. He wanted to help her in that short quarrel, but his \ndamaged limited him.\n\nAs she approached him, he lifted his head, his left claw shaking. &quot;Course ya \ncan join,&quot; he said to her. &quot;Mentella, right? Mighty sorry that ah went \nspooky on ya back there in th&#39; forest. Recent days ain&#39;t been good t&#39; me as \nya can see.&quot; He tapped his right claw against the side of his damaged left \nforeclaw. &quot;Ya damaged? Ah&#39;m goin&#39; t&#39; th&#39; CR chambers.&quot;\n\nThen he thought of something. He commanded the computer: &quot;Computer, shields \nup!&quot; He then said to Mantella, &quot;We&#39;s be safe now, eh?&quot; He took a few steps \nforward. He received Silverstyke&#39;s transmission.\n\nHe said into his comm-link, &quot;Silverstryke? Sure! Ya can join. Ah&#39;ll send \nsome tin-horn t&#39; come get ya.&quot; This may be a way in repaying him for \nbringing him back on-line.\n\nHe shouted into the hallway, after Sinesis, &quot;Hey Sinesis! Ah need ya t&#39; do \nuh job! Want ya t&#39; find uh bot named Silverstryke and bring him here! He&#39;s \none of us.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
