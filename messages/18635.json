I don&#39;t know anything. I \nthought Inferno was dead along with the others of my old group.  I \nhad no idea he was even alive until he just happened to have found me \nin the forest.  He told me that Megatron was dead. At first I didn&#39;t \nbelieve him. But then when I saw on that monitor over there,&quot;points \nwith a trembling hand at the console,&quot;that the spark it was working \non was Megatron&#39;s I knew what he said ws true.  Now here you are, \ngoing to shoot me, and asking me where Megatron is.  If that&#39;s his \nspark, then he&#39;s right here. I don&#39;t know what else I can say.&quot;  she \nsobbed and coverred her face with her hands again. \n\n\n"}}
