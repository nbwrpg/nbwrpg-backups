She had no reason to \ndoubt him.  He had some proof in the hologram. He was sitting there, \ntelling her it was her destiny to crush the allience and unite the \npreds. But with Destructor? She wondered what happened to Drillbit. \nDid he get killed? Did something happen to Drillbit that caused him \nto not make it into the future? She got worried and looked at \nGabriel. She had to ask. Perhaps there was a way to prevent his \ndeath. \n&quot;You mentionted that Destructor and I bring the preds together after \nthe Allience was crushed. What happened to Drillbit? Please tell me. \nI must know. What happens to Drillbit?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
