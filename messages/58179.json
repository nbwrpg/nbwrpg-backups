He pulled the lid open and saw a pair of eyes looking back at him.  Malicous looking eyes.  He slammed the lid shut an locked it.\n\nHe brushed off the side of the pod and found that this was one of the prisioners from the ship.  An especially violent prisioner because a few seconds later he began to try to break out of the pod.\n\nI better call the Warden.  He runs away just as the pod errupts in flames.\n\n&gt;Message: 1\n&gt;   Date: Mon, 15 Sep 2003 07:45:49 -0700\n&gt;   From: &quot;Vryl The Cranberry Hag&quot; &lt;rm2kmidi@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Celeron--Salvage\n&gt;\n&gt;Celeron steped outside the ship.  It was a boring night, he had solved all their problems and now the captain had been having him repair stuff.  Once his task was done, instead of getting another, he quickly sneaked out.\n&gt;\n&gt;He half flew, half walked up to the top of the sandy hill which was right next to the ship.  Then he started a scan for anything interesting.  \n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Searching........some metal, some mice, a bug....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Somthing caught his attention.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;....ooooOOO  small pod.....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;It was quite a ways away so he had to hike about 13 minutes to another mountain about 10 clicks south.  When he arrived at the object he discovered that it was buryed about 80% of the way into the sand.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Its buried.....time to get out the old shovel....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;(To be continued)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;____________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get advanced SPAM filtering on Webmail or POP Mail ...
