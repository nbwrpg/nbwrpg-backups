Now, I suggest you explain what MAXIMAL\n&gt; trick this is before I am forced to get angry wtih you all.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT casually walking over towards VICE GRIP, &quot;Shall I deal with the\n&gt; bufoon for you, LORD HYDRAS?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a grunt front INFERNO as VICE GRIP&#39;s readings showed false.\n&quot;How dare you speak against the ruling monarch over our illustrious\nforce.&quot; INFERNO&#39;s voice imperious as he kept himself between HYDRAS\nand VICE GRIP.\n\n&quot;It is no trick Vice Grip.&quot; CRYOTEK said in obviously annoyed tones.\n&quot;Perhaps we need to update your sensors a bit.&quot; He was about to say\nmore when HYDRAS cut in.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:: Hydras hissed annoyed and said &quot;I&#39;ll dicispline my troops by\n&gt; myself... and YOU, Vice Grip...

It had been a while since they had seen their leader open up on\nsomeone.\n\nINFERNO was reluctant to step aside, his desire to protect HYDRAS at\nwar with his ingrained obedience to him.\n\nThere was a wicked smile from IGUANUS, &quot;I had a similar reaction to\n&#39;im.&quot; he chuckled as he casually hefted his rifle onto his shoulder.\nHe shrugged, &quot;It&#39;ll all come out soon enough.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
