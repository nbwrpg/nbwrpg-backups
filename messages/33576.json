I was signed onto the Council not even a several weeks after joining \nthe RPG because I deserved it, because of my skill and experience, and my \nideas, which I still bring to the RPG.  My moding enforcement I can happily \nsay doesn&#39;t exist becuase there is no longer a need for it.\n\nThis new Council seems like things will actually happen instead of making a \nsuggestion and everyone says &quot;Oh, good idea.&quot; and nothing happens.  Though \nwith this new Council, and if I&#39;m on it, good things will happen, rules that \nwill help out the &quot;little guys&quot;.  If elected some of my rules may seem \nhipocritical since one or two I may be guilty of (and I&#39;m not the only one), \nbut that is how you learn.  Through experience, which I&#39;ve got 5+ years of \nonline RPing experience, all in RPGs very similar to this.  I may seem harsh \nat times, but I&#39;m only acting in the best interests of the RPG.  \n\nSo vote for the KSLawDogg@...\n\n-Uni\n\n(Just want to say right now thanks to my loyal supporters, your aid has been \nmost helpful and I&#39;m most appreciative)\n\n"}}
