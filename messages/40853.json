Also, I never said anything about physically being able to fire things like that in that depth. Gunthers is exactly right. The bottom of the ocean would crush any missile, and laser shots would have alot of trouble staying concentrated, though I didn&#39;t realize that until now. I should have realized that, though. Chances are, Alecto would be feeling a bit warm from being radiated by defused laser energy, although the water should be crushing her as well.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; not true. Bases and things can recalibrate gunthers. Heh my base has already \n&gt; been approved by Yan. He even helped with the armament.\n\n\n"}}
