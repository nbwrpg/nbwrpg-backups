First he got the black\ncanister and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unloaded it&#39;s contents into the pod, so it would be part of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protoform. That was easy. Now Darkangel was at the keyboards running\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through millions of files looking for the correct one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally after about ten minutes he found Burrock.dna on the\nsystem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He selected the file and began to upload it into the pod.
