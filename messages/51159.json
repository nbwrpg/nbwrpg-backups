Simply put, you are \nbeing bombarded with the leftover crap seen in these annoying \nwannabes&#39; daily lives. Bleh.\n    At any rate, if they were intelligent, they&#39;d have realized their \nmistakes before they even attempted to do what they are. They would \nhave certainly done their homework, if they were actual hackers. But, \nlike I said, they aren&#39;t intelligent or hackers.\n    I mean, come on, my name is Daniel, not Dave. I would _never_ \nname my characters so simply; it&#39;s just not my style. And, perhaps \nmost obvious, the last posts seen from me were several paragraphs \nlong and at least moderately descriptive. The childish things these \nmorons are up to involves posts that aren&#39;t running more than ten \nsentences, and never once have they followed any sort of sentence \nstructure known to the person they are imitating.\n    Yes, I&#39;m sure you can tell I am rather angry about this, but only \nbecause the idiots couldn&#39;t do a decent job of being stupid. If they \nwant to be hackers, they should first find out the difference between \nhacking and &quot;|34|&gt;455 1337 |-|4xx0|2i|&#92;|6&quot;. Geez, what do they teach \nthese children nowadays? They need role models. Go read up on Cap&#39;n \nCrunch, Matt Mingo, and a few others. We _reallY- have to start a \nScript Kiddies Anonymous. And even then, these fools aren&#39;t even good \nenough to be script kiddies!\n\n     Daniel (NOT DAVE) Finnamore\n\n\n\n"}}
