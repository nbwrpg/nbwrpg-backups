As he lifted off he was hit by various shots from Astral \nslowing down his liftoff. The trainer leader opened a link to his \nassailant. &quot;You have a choice to make, either keep attacking me and \nlose your prize or go catch it. What would your mighty leader say if \nyou lost the bot that your friend was carrying?&quot; He already knew the \nanswer so he didn&#39;t expect a reply. He let his weapons do the talking \nand fired two missles at Astral and five more blasts from his rifle, \nthree at Starlight and two at the new bot.
