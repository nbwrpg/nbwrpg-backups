Leo Prime, I believe he identiifed himself as?  What are his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncapabilities?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the very least, they already had more to go o=\r\nn than they had previously -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they knew the name of the Prime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKYSHADOW paused for a moment, his optics thoughtful. &quot;We =\r\nknow something of him.&quot; He said carefully. &quot;Not not as much as I would like=\r\n. He is the spark &#39;child&#39; of Lio Convoy, who you may know LIO CONVOY as one=\r\n of the Maximals generals before the great peace accord set in?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHe shook his head slightly, &quot;No one knows who the mother is, some think Thi=\r\ns Leo . . . um. . . Jr  for want of a better term,  is a clone of his &#39;fath=\r\ner&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKYSHADOW&#39;s optics brightened as another memory came to him.=\r\n &quot;If he is he, then that means that Wing Caliber and Santon are not far awa=\r\ny either. There is a rumor they they can become Magnaboss, although I have =\r\nnot actually seen that.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT grunted, &quot;=\r\nA battle with a combiner of the old style would be a worthy adversary.  But=\r\n it would not be one to be taken lightly.  I would rather not do so, better=\r\n to separate the components and take them apart at our leisuire to take the=\r\n technology for our own, since TRIPREDACUS adn the council have been so loa=\r\nthe to expand it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Focusing on what SKY SHADOW was saying, nodding fur=\r\nther, &quot;A lineage of a PRIME itself and one of the most powerful MAXIMAL fie=\r\nld generals ever.  Direct conflict would be..  Challenging, and many of our=\r\n normal techniques and tactics he would be aware of.  WHile I would enjoy l=\r\nittle more than testing our prowess agaisnt him, success would be risky eve=\r\nn under optimal conditions, for even the MAXIMALS do not name their Primes =\r\nlightly.  We would be better continuing with our plans when he has departed=\r\n from this planet.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; SKYSHADOW turned to DINOBOT,=\r\n &quot;I would not want to encroach upon Hydras&#39; perrogative.&quot; He said in that s=\r\name careful manner of his, sounding like the ever so loyal servant of HYDRA=\r\nS. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;But this is as big as this sounds.&quot; SKYSHGADOW said, talking =\r\nabout the conversation HYDRAS and LEO were having, &quot;Then it is likely most =\r\nof us will need to go, with a skeleton crew left here, perhaps I and my fuz=\r\nors.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; VICE GRIP nodded, &quot;A battel with a PRIME would b=\r\ne dangerous, especially as one that could have backup from the ARK and any =\r\nother forces he might have with him.  We would be wide to avoid direct conf=\r\nlict unless we could isolate and ambush him from superior forces.  Avoiding=\r\n conflict for now is to our benefit until we better understand the situatio=\r\nn.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD - CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a playful smile and a raised op=\r\ntic ridge, &quot;And tell me, which assets are you more comfortable in sharing?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; She grinned, &quot;Why, if you can&#39;t guess=\r\n, then I&#39;d have to say your optics are focusing on the wrong point of plati=\r\nng.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD - TARANTALUS&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;BAH!&quot; TARANTULUS said over their enc=\r\nrypted transmission. &quot;Hydras is so predictable.&quot; He words dimsive of Hydras=\r\n&#39; ability. &quot;Since Megatron and Galvatron *ahem* shall we say, joined forces=\r\n, what has resulted has been lack luster to say the least.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There =\r\nwas a pause, &quot;No.&quot; He said finally. &quot;Keep a watch on Cryotek. He has an age=\r\nnda, and I want to know what it is. It may have something to do with what w=\r\ne are facing, or could be something different entirely.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; A quiet thought from BLACKARACHNIA was sent back along the mental link, =\r\n&lt;Have you considered merely offering to join with him?  You have establishe=\r\nd facilities here separate from Hydras and a reputation in the underground.=\r\n  I am sure he would be willing to..  Listen if you made an offer and made =\r\nit believable.&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
