Let&#39;s throw a party!  Hate to break it to\nyou,\n&gt; but that&#39;s not a great achievement.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Anyway, I was misinformed then.  Either way, the TM4 Driver is VOID\nuntil\n&gt; the Council votes on it.  Anyone who got the &quot;magical powers&quot; from it,\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; have them anymore.  Next it will be a TM5 Driver, then we&#39;ll have tall\n&gt; demi-gods running around.\n&gt;     There is also no need to be rude.  Of course if you&#39;d like to\n&gt; continue...be my guest.
