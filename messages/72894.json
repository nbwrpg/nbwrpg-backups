Okay, Computer, list ID and ID number of\n&gt; the programmer who initiated the reset on corosponding Date of alteration.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns to Polar Claw and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I used ta help in diagnostics once in a while on Cybertron.  And even if\n&gt; everything looked normal, didn&#39;t mean that there wasn&#39;t a change somewhere.\n&gt; I got a feeling we have a back door Trojan somewhere and if there was a\n&gt; reset somewhere, that means there could be a hacker.

That last reboot to bring the computer up required a full\nreset of the systems.\n\nHowever the computer was also registering several communication\nattempts with the satalite several days ago, and each time the\nsatelite requested a clearance code. The source of the communication\nattempt was from the very panel that NIGHTSHIFT was working, however\nIn each case the wrong clearance code was provided.\n\nThe Satelite eventually stopped communicating, locking the base out.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
