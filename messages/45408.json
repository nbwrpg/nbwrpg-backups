After suffering the loss of both Hoist and Computron, who \naccidentally combined themselves with the ships computer in an \nexperiment that went wrong, he didn&#39;t want to lose Firedrill either. \nThe ships computer was now controlled by Hoist, and so Pacifix \nprepares a commlink. &quot;Hoist, open a commlink to the Tripreds.&quot; \n\nA hologram of Hoist appears infront of Pacifix. Hoist&#39;s voice sounds \nover the internal speakers, &quot;Sure Pacifix.&quot; Hoist flickers and the \nmumbles something. &quot;Alright Go!&quot; He says to Pacifix before \nflickering again and dissapearing.\n\nPacifix nods as he leaves, and speaks, &quot;Tripreds, this is Autobot \nCommander Pacifix. I&#39;m awaiting a report from Diplomatic Liason \nFiredrill, is he available?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
