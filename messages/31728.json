Today was the day, 1 year ago, that i joined\n&gt; this RPG.  I had\n&gt; been doing \n&gt; &gt; searches all over the internet for RPGs, but none\n&gt; really caught my\n&gt; eye until \n&gt; &gt; i saw the link- Neo Beast Wars RPG. I decided id\n&gt; like to check it\n&gt; out, and \n&gt; &gt; fell in love as soon as i read the story and\n&gt; looked at the\n&gt; characters.  I \n&gt; &gt; knew i must join immeadiately, so i used an old\n&gt; favorite character,\n&gt; Torca.  \n&gt; &gt; My profile was an immeadiate mode, and i was\n&gt; pretty stupid when i\n&gt; was new.  I \n&gt; &gt; remember my first post like it was yesterday. \n&gt; Torca burst into the\n&gt; Predacon \n&gt; &gt; base and put his gun up to Quickstrike and tried\n&gt; to eliminate his\n&gt; spark.  \n&gt; &gt; Talon got really pissed at me.  But soon i started\n&gt; to catch on, and\n&gt; created \n&gt; &gt; stronger characters and some good stories.  In my\n&gt; time here in the\n&gt; RPG, i saw \n&gt; &gt; many changes.  I&#39;ve seen ultra-powerful groups\n&gt; rise and fall,\n&gt; extremely \n&gt; &gt; talented RPers come and go(not to mention a lot of\n&gt; idiots), and\n&gt; built \n&gt; &gt; firendships with members.  Id like to thank\n&gt; Soulstice for his\n&gt; friendship and \n&gt; &gt; partnership, Zardus for putting up with me through\n&gt; my early times,\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; everyone else that ive had the pleasure(or\n&gt; displeasure) of RPing\n&gt; with, and i \n&gt; &gt; hope my next year here will be even better.  Just\n&gt; wanted to get that\n&gt; off my \n&gt; &gt; chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
