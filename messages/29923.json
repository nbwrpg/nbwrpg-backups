I will provide you with time and resources to run your\n&gt; experiments, all I need is a good result.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk had to agree that her fathers ideas would be useless in\n&gt; space. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; But isn&#39;t the ultimate challenge of every race to survive? To do so\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; must adapt.&quot; She hoped he&#39;d follow her lead and complete her\n&gt; thoughts for\n&gt; &gt; her. As royalty she hadn&#39;t been prerared for such a debate. &quot;I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen many\n&gt; &gt; things in my time including creatures such as the ones you want me\n&gt; to create\n&gt; &gt; that can survive even without an atmosphere.&quot; she searched her\n&gt; memory banks\n&gt; &gt; for a quick example, &quot;The voles of Tembre breathe the phosphorus\n&gt; gasses in\n&gt; &gt; thier atmosphere like we use the air as coolant for our internal\n&gt; circuitry.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She knew he couldn&#39;t argue the example but he could push the issue.\n&gt; as much\n&gt; &gt; as she despised what she&#39;d have to do she knew that it was her main\n&gt; chance\n&gt; &gt; at freedom.
