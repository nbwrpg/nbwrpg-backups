She was unconcious.  Again, with every effort he tries to make=\r\n, his actions once again put a major strain on his systems as his energy le=\r\nvels drop from sixty to forty percent.  This wouldn&#39;t bode well for him.  H=\r\ne could no longer transform, he could no longer move without great effort. =\r\n He collapses to the ground, and now hearing Scorponok&#39;s steps, he remains =\r\nup against a wall, burnt out, nearly broken, and severely drained of his re=\r\nsources. His shinny silver armor scuffed and dented, appearing like somethi=\r\nng out of a major car wreck.  He could not go any further.  \n\nRat Trap stan=\r\nds over him and stays by his side.\n\n&quot;Wheels, no, ya can&#39;t give up on me, no=\r\nt like this.&quot;\n\nTucson puts his hand with effort into Rat Traps&#39;.\n\n&quot;I - may =\r\nnot be - able to move, but, you - still have all your energy reserves - in =\r\ntact.  Rat - Trap. I - need you to - f- find the others, Zarak mentoned the=\r\n Ark..  You - must find it and - try to get help.  Can - you do that?&quot;\n\nRat=\r\n Trap nodds.\n\n&quot; I hate leavn&#39; ya here Wheels, but we&#39;re outa options.  Okay=\r\n, I&#39;ll do it.  For you I&#39;ll risk my aft.  But, how do I find it? When will =\r\nI know I&#39;ve reached it?&quot;\n\nTucson gasps for breath.  He then takes off his t=\r\nransmitter from his helmet and turns on a beacon.  The beacon pulses slowly=\r\n on it.  \n\n&quot; There is a beacon on this transmitter.  The faster it - pulsat=\r\nes, the closser you - are to finding the Ark. It  was installed on my helme=\r\nt after I became visually impaired, so I could find my way back to the Ark =\r\nafter - each mission.  The beacon reacts to the alloys used to build the sh=\r\nip.  And  only ones used by Autobots.  \n\nRat Trap takes the transmitter.\n\n&quot;=\r\nBut without this you&#39;re a sittn&#39; duck. This is our ears, this is how you na=\r\nvigate.  Without this, you&#39;ll be bumpn&#39; the walls constantly.&quot;\n\nTucson sigh=\r\ns.\n\n&quot; I  can&#39;t  go anywhere anyway.  Now, get - going. You  have  a lot of =\r\nground to cover.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds, while Tucson secures the transmitter ont=\r\no his left ear, while in his rat form.  The transmitter seems rather large =\r\nfor his ear yet, he carries it sufficiantly.\n\n&quot; You can count on me Wheels.=\r\n&quot;\n\nHe leaves his disabled friend, and darts out into the hallways in his ra=\r\nt form, cautiously moving and freezing in place once in open areas.  The tr=\r\nansmitter blips slowly.  He still had a long way to go before he could reac=\r\nh the Ark.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclon=\r\nus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For the briefest of moments Zarak caught a glimpse of th=\r\ne reading on\n&gt; his scanner, and all he  could see immediately that what was=\r\n hidden in\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s helm was no simple rat, there was too much energy the=\r\nre.\n&gt; \n&gt; However the rat quickly transferred energy to Tuscon in the form o=\r\nf a\n&gt; fuel dump, and quicker than Zarak would have thought possible Tuscon\n=\r\n&gt; was back in action, along with Rat Trap!\n&gt; \n&gt; It seemed like it only took=\r\n seconds! Rat Trap appeared, Tuscon\n&gt; revived, Darkhawk was knocked down, a=\r\nnd for a moment it seemed as if\n&gt; Tuscon was going to drive right over him,=\r\n but then he swerved, and\n&gt; after a blast from Rat Trap that blasted open a=\r\n section of wall they\n&gt; took off down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zarak smiled as he sent a few s=\r\nhots from his energy rifle down after\n&gt; the fleeing Autobot and Maximal!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Quickly he leaped over to where the fallen Darkhawk lay as he opened a\n&gt;=\r\n communication to Hydras and Perceptor, &quot;The prisoner has escaped!&quot;\n&gt; Zarak=\r\n looked back over at the hole that was blown in the door as he\n&gt; spoke, &quot;Th=\r\nere were two of them. One of them was hiding on that Tuscon\n&gt; Autobot. He s=\r\nomehow freed him and they&#39;re driving through the base!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Zarak =\r\ndid quick scan of Darkhawk to check his vitals, a deep\n&gt; thunk of metal boo=\r\nts hitting thick deck plating could be heard from\n&gt; behind him. A door slid=\r\n open.\n&gt; \n&gt; After ascertaining that Darkhawk would live he stood and turned=\r\n, &quot;Yes\n&gt; my old friend, the time has come once again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Taking up the e=\r\nntire frame of the door was the massive figure of\n&gt; Scorponok, Zarak&#39;s seco=\r\nnd body so to speak. At the moment it was\n&gt; headless, giving it a strangely=\r\n ghastly and yet vulnerable appearance.\n&gt; However that was easily rectified=\r\n as Zarak leaped into the air and\n&gt; with the tel-tale sounds of gears grind=\r\ning he shifted into a head, one\n&gt; that slipped perfectly between Scorponok&#39;=\r\ns shoulders and clicked.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his own form Zarak was short, even diminut=\r\nive, but now joined once\n&gt; again with Scorponok he was fully head and shoul=\r\nders taller then most\n&gt; Maximals and Predicons! With a Decepticon purple fr=\r\name and powerfully\n&gt; built green limbs he radiated aggression and domminanc=\r\ne! The cannons\n&gt; mounted on his shoulders and the massive claws that he had=\r\n for hands\n&gt; were mute testimony to the true destructive potential that lay=\r\n at his\n&gt; command.\n&gt; \n&gt; He transformed into his destructive crab mode and t=\r\nook off after Rat\n&gt; Trap and Tuscon!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I think that Cyclonus and Sc=\r\nourge and the rest are somewhat\n&gt; separate from all this for them not to be=\r\n involved, so I will post for\n&gt; them in a different letter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; =\r\n(Zarak-Scorponok)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
