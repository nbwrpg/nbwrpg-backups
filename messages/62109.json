I have no need to \nfear her.&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;True&quot;replied Windlord sadly\nInjustice:  &quot;Then shut up. Don&#39;t talk unless you really have \nsomething to say.&quot; \nWindlord: Windlord thought that this was a good advice and he \nremained in silence\nInjustice:  &quot;Better.  Since she is exhausted, I suppose I&#39;ll let her \nrest up so she can work later.  But don&#39;t get to comfortable, she&#39;ll \nbe too busy to come, heh heh, spoon feed you!&quot;\nWindlord: Windlord didn&#39;t say anything, but he was starting to \nreally hate Injustice\nInjustice:  &quot;Goodnight, parrot.  I have better things to do, like \nluring Megatron up here!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;WHAT???? NO!!!&quot; shouted surpriced and shocked\nOrganics:  The femme finally stirred and woke up, wincing a \nlittle.  &quot;Wha..?  Whats going on?&quot;\nWindlord: The male looked to the room&#39;s door watching if Injustice \nwas there\nInjustice:  &quot;Oh look, you woke her up.  Bad boy!  HahAHA!&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;Hadn&#39;t you important things to do, Injsutice?&quot;said the \nmale weakly but cleary challenging him\nInjustice:  &quot;Why you iggnorant little worm!  How dare you!&quot; the \nclone exclaimed angerily.\nOrganics:  &quot;Shut up Injustice.  I&#39;m too tired to deal with your slag \nright now.\nWindlord:Windlord took Organics&#39; hand and squeezed her, If he wasn&#39;t \ncarefull this situation could end very bad\nInjustice:  &quot;Feh.  Whatever.  Just get ready for company, you might \nbe having a roommate, parrot.&quot;  The clone turned and left the room, \nheaded to the Med lab.\nWindlord: The male shudder with rage, if he wouldn&#39;t be so weak... \nThen he looked to ORganics and he remembered Injustice&#39;s words and \nsaid with low voice &quot;Organics... he knows about MEgatron... I don&#39;t \nknow how he know but he knows&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t get him.  Megatron is so much more \npoweful than i could ever hope to be.  If Injustice wants a piece of \nhim, he&#39;d better pack along his coffin.&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;They could force him some how...&quot;said weackly Windlord\nOrganics:  &quot;No, he&#39;s too smart for that, thy won&#39;t get him, it&#39;s \nimpossible.&quot;\nWindlord: &quot;I hope that my dear...&quot;said visible tired &quot;I hope that...&quot;\nNightstrike: Door opened again and appeared Nightstrike, who said \nwith out emotions &quot;Time over, Organics, said farewell to your \nboyfriend&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;Fine.  I&#39;ll just go finish a nap in the computer room \nanyway,&quot; the femme said as she rested Windlord on the bed and got up \nand walked to the door.\nNightstrik: The male closed the door and follow her  and said &quot;Was \ninjustice visited you?&quot;\nOrganics:  The femme leaned against the wall for a moment, then \nlooked up to Nightstrike.  &quot;Yeah.  Why?&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;Altough I know&quot;said cooly the male&quot;He isn&#39;t allowed \nstay there... after he did with your boyfriend&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;So why don&#39;t you keep a shorter leash on him?  He&#39;s a \ngrade A nutcase, even compared to the rest of you.&quot;\nNightsrike: &quot;I&#39;m a soldier not a baby sitter&quot;replied the male&quot;If you \nhave complains about Injustice, you should give them to his creator&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;And who would that be?  Who would want that thing as \ntheir handywork?&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;It&#39;s Hellplague one of femmes fugitives... I guess \nthat she liked a boyfriend &#39;cause Malice just liked \nBlacknightmare...l due that she clone your bro&quot;and added the \nmale&quot;But it seems that he liked Blacknightmare too&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;You&#39;re kidding.  Malice would never even say something \nnice to you creeps.  How could he fall in love with one of you?&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t care&quot;replied the male\nOrganics:  &quot;Has anyone told you you are as useful as a fist full of \ndust?  You don&#39;t know anything!&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;I&#39;m just worry to fill my obligations, serve Unicron \nand have a nice while&quot;replied Nightstrike&quot;Whatever do others with \nthier lives I don&#39;t care&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;That&#39;s how a lot of soldiers die young.  they don&#39;t look \nat anything other han blindly following duty.  It&#39;s your spark, do \nwhatever.&quot;\nNightstrike:&quot;Those femmes not obeyed... and now their lives are \nmenaced&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;And you don&#39;t care?  Are they not family, you&#39;re \nsupposed to care about family!&quot;\nNightstrike: &quot;They aren&#39;t my family... perhaps those femmes are \nsisters, the called each other *Sister*... besides that I don&#39;t know \nif they are or not&quot;\nOrganics:  &quot;WHAT?  You mean you don&#39;t even know if they are \nsiblings?&quot;  She smacked the male hard across the face, she was \ngenuinly disgusted.  &quot;How dare you!  You are lower than the insane \nclone of my brother!  You disgust me!&quot;  At that, she walked into the \ncomputer room and shut the door.  She sat on the edge of the bed and \nthought, trying to calm down enough to go to sleep.\nNighstrike: The male smiled devilish and said &quot;Big mistake&quot;\nNightstike: After that he walked towards Windlord&#39;s room amd change \nthe password. Only he could came in.\nNightstrike: the male came in the room Where Organics was\n\n\n\n\n"}}
