Because of\nthat, they will be found by the Pacificus, the Bushidos, the Silver\nWings, or the Iron Skulls. The Watchers don&#39;t perform archeological\nsearches; they have other business to tend to.\n\n2) We&#39;ll also need to determine where the characters are reactivated.\nAfter all, it will play a role in the reactions. Just imagine when\nthey find out the new bot in Olympus is a dreaded minion...\n\n3) If the council decides the randomness, how will their char\ndistribution be random?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is an idea tha tI have in order to increase the tention and\ncreativity in this restart (to name it some how). instead you choose\nthe faction that you belong at first, the election will be radmonly:\n&gt; \n&gt; Example:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1.. Let give a Maxis number 1, Preds no 2, minions 3 and\ntripeducus 4. \n&gt;   2.. You won&#39;t know what&#39;s the faction name under the number. \n&gt;   3.. You will said randmonly: Nighlight will go with number 3,\nWindlord with munber 2 and Rodimus witn number 2. \n&gt;   4.. All chars that will survive and be found in stasis in Earth\nwould be found by menbers whose belongs the number.\n&gt;   5.. You can do all rerprogramation and changes that wish.\n&gt; Why that? In order to burst creativity, tention and plots. \n&gt; \n&gt; If a bot is founded by members of a rival faction, can you imagine\nwhat might happen?\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course this is an idea \n&gt; \n&gt; Incase that this idea be aprobed, council members will share the\ncode and what number belongs to each faction each other,  and they\nwill follow a similar proces. Same ida can be aplied to new chars made\nfor the &#39;restart&#39; but just for this time. \n&gt; \n&gt; After Re-star runs, characters will goinf faction/creat one, as\nussually have done.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think about this idea?\n\n\n\n"}}
