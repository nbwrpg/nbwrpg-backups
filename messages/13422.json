He respected his title as being a Predacon, but he personally\nhated polishing his symbol.  He took his polish and cloth and tossed it over\nhis shoulder.  He then looked at GoldenEye into her piercing eyes.  She\nsomehow reminded him of the bot he had visions of.  Could she be a\nconnection between him and the beautiful bot whom he&#39;d never met??  Is the\nbot he has dreams and visions about a Predacon too??  Does she exist???  He\nhoped so.\n\n           &quot;Ah, I came here for the excitement, the action, the war!!!!!\nActually, I prefer tactical battle.  Mind over matter, no matter what!!!!\nHey, by the way, could you take me to the Predacon base closest to our\nlocation??&quot; He said, rubbing the back of his head.\n\n\n"}}
