Already she could guess that Iron Raptor was going to do some sort of spying mission, something to do with the weapons on the Ark and the Predacon base*\n\n*She thought for a moment. She did have wings, and could use them quite well by now. And she was practically the only undamaged flyer of the Maximals. She had to do it! She steps up behind Iron Raptor*\n\n&quot;If you like, I&#39;ll do the spying job. I&#39;m probably the only uninjured flyer of the Maximals. Bit it&#39;ll be after the fight, right? I mean I don&#39;t want to miss that!&quot; *She grins*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
