The other half, the \nmechanical one, in a final fight over organic life and it&#39;s future on \nCyberetron proved a failure for the organic bot.  In the battle they \nraged against each other.  With a qucik snap of his wrist the organic \nbot lashed his special energon whips across his arch-enemy&#39;s face, \nblinding him instantly. He remembers how the bot crazed, firing al over \nthe place, and with a crazy shot it all went black for the protector of \norganic life.  The shot had put his spark into stasis lock. What had \nhappened to his foe, his evil half, he did not know. Until not long ago.\n\nAxis looked to Aerotaur. &quot;All right, he&#39;s yours.  I am here if you need \nme&quot;  He then turned and noticed Windlord in some trouble.  He fired two \nmissiles at the traiter McGowan while Lokk and Seekker continued to fire \n25 shots each at the foe.\n\nLynxiz ran out after Lynxiz and spotting Stranato decides it is time for \npayback. Firing three discs set for 1 second explosion on impact at him.\n\n\n"}}
