He looks \nover at Hot Rod as the other bot also walks up.\n\n&quot;Chased them off?&quot; he replies in surprise at Angel Prime&#39;s comment, \nsensing over 20 enemies still at battle, &quot;There&#39;s still a horde of \nthem!&quot;\n\nProwl jumps to the side as FZ flies by, swearing when one of FZ&#39;s \nenergy-draining missiles explodes right next to him. He rolls out of \nthe blue field, feeling most of his energy gone. Prowl stumbles \nsideways, his systems regaining energy.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot smashes into the ground hard, skidding several feet and \ncoming to a complete stop. He groans, beginning to get up.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster nods as he hears Chordate acknowledge the lockdown. He dives \nout of the way of several shots, Manterror&#39;s ion disks cutting \nthrough the armor in his arm but missing any major circuits.\n\nKluster turns and swears as he sees two bots trying to get into the \nCybertronian Fire. He grabbs a missile launcher from a storage \ncompartment, firing two missiles at the ground next to Firestarter \nand Unitron. That way he had no chance of missing the bots and \nhitting the CF.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGrimmler looks up at the battle between the two giant gestalts that \nwas taking place near him. He aims his missile launcher, firing two \nmissiles at the back of Oblitertron&#39;s left knee.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm runs into the battle, transforming into tank mode and firing \ncharges and missiles at Double Punch.\n\n\n"}}
