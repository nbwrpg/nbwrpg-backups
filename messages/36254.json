The weapon and shield are a plasma sword and \nshield. They are both light and you should have no problem using \nthem to defeat enemies. The plasma blade will become surrounded \nin miniature bluish flames when you begin to use it. When \ndamaging enemies, it causes blade damage plus the bluish flames \nwill stick to the damaged area, and cause excruciating pain, \nwithout inflicting more damage. The shield has a moderate ability \nto absorbe heat. Use them wisely, for your sake and mine.&quot; He \nchuckles.\n\nSwoop dodges weapon fire and the collapsing ceiling, then leaps \ninto flight. He circles wildly around the small room, looking for a \nnew target, but not wanting to hurt any friends.\n\n"}}
