She watched as she heard the last \ndecision from the council. Berserk was a gonner. In the distance, she \ncould hear the female bounty hunter laugh. It was peircing to her. \nShe hated that Shadow Zone slag. \n\nThe conclusion was that he be sent of in a stasis pod to rid of him. \nAway from harm of the Cybertronians. All that hard work, all the \ncredits they put into him to make him normal was wasted away. All \nbecause a bounty hunter wanted him dead. Well, she got her greedy \nwish. \n\nShe turned to Sky Knight, who stared up at the row of council \nmembers, glowering. She knew he felt the same way. He snapped, \nyelling at them that Berserk was a brilliant creation, not to be \nthrown away, but she drowned it out. She took a step back. She turned \nher head. She knew what ever they did, they won&#39;t be able to save \nBerserk. His fate was in the hands of the council&#39;s decision.\n\n\n"}}
