It&#39;s mainly used to carry viruses and can \ninfect over a \n&gt; long distance. Or...can be loaded with an antivirus.\n&gt; Either way it can carry a counter to that chip which was fired.\n&gt; Same with this weapon...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris displayed it as well and the other after that, all weapons \ncappable \n&gt; of carrying the counter.\n&gt; Then she began to display the programs.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; These are all modified counterviruses...as well as default \nprograms.\n&gt; They basically can either wipe clean the programming that the \nviction has \n&gt; recieved...or can kill them in the process.\n&gt; It&#39;s a delicate process, one that takes time.\n&gt; The programs have to be loaded properly in order for them to do \ntheir \n&gt; job...and not kill.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris knew that SHE could load the program so that it would work, \nshe did \n&gt; have the precision of a calculated geniouse...after all.\n&gt; But, she would have to make a weaponry holding stand with nano-\nprobs, and it \n&gt; would only take about 3 mega-cycles at the longest.*\n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________Zyber.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Zyber watched as the beast drained the cup, her eyes wide.\n&gt; How could he just gizzle it like that, it was strong as the \nPit...and it \n&gt; even took her hours to finish.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Uh...I think you were attacked.
