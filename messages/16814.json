Alive and \nnot a scratch on him.\nShe was stunned.\nIron Raptor took Prowl from Firearm and leaned his battered and torn body \nagainst the wall beside a CR chamber, knowing that Firearms words were true \nas she kneeled.\nProwl was too damaged and few gone for a chamber, and she could see that his \nchest was still and no longer took in breath.\nIt was so hard to belive that her love was actually here, in her arms, \ndying.\nBut with her hands wet with his mech-fluid, reality was far too real.\nIron Raptor looked over Prowl once again, swallowing a lump that had grown \nin her throat.\nShe stroked her fingers long his bloody face.*\n\n&quot; Wake up, please?&quot;\n\n* Her voice nothing more then a whisper.*\n\n&quot; You have to wake up...please...please.&quot;\n\n* She gently shook his shoulder, her voice cracking a bit and her optics \nbecoming wet.*\n\n&quot; Please? Just wake up...everything&#39;ll be fine. You just have to wake up.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor just couldn&#39;t grasp just what was happening, not willing to \naccept that Prowl would die.\nShe shook his shoulder-plate once again.\nRemembering how she refused to let him touch her before just for a stupid \ncommant, then then watching him run out with Kluster...the last time she saw \nhim active.*\n\n&quot; Prowl? I&#39;m sorry for what I did and never let you near me, I&#39;m sorry. Just \nplease don&#39;t die.&quot;\n\n* By now there were tears running down her face, her voice already cracking \nwith the strain it took to make words instead of sobs.\nThis couldn&#39;t be happening, not like this!\nIron Raptor remembered how she had refused his embrace and it tore her in \nhalf, because if he died now she would never feel his arms around her again.\nNever feel his warmth and never see him smile.\nNever hear him laugh or joke about her weight every time he flew her \nsomewhere.\nIt would be all gone, forever.\nShe looked at the torn Prowl through foggy eyes before she found herself \nhugging him to her, his head resting against the flat of her chest.\nIron Raptor looked down at him, resting her cheek against his bloodied \nforehead. Her tears running fron her eyes and onto his armor, washing away \nsmall streaks of mech-fluid.*\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t die.&quot;\n\n* Her voice was now more of a pleading whimper by now, her sides slightly \nheaving as she silently cried and held her only love to her. Clining to him \nalmost as if that alone would bring him back to life and everything would be \nOK.\nShe remembered even how they had met the first time, literally falling for \neach other.\nRampage had thrown her against Prowl and they both ended up in a heap, and \nProwl had never gotten angry, he had joked about it.\nShe remembered his exact words. &quot; Don&#39;t worry about it, I like it when wemon \nsit on me.&quot;\nBut she didn&#39;t smile at remembering that memory, only cried harder.\nShe would never hear his voice again.\nIron Raptor would give anything in the universe just for Prowl to call her a \ntruck right there and then, but all that echoed around that room was \nsilence...and her mournful sobs.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
