He heard a commotion near his \n&gt; &gt; apartment he, Megatronics, and their adoptive sister, Organics \n&gt; &gt; shared.  Several bots were gathered around the door, watching \n&gt; &gt; Megatronics stand over Organics.  Not menacing her, protecting \n&gt; her.  \n&gt; &gt; His brother was struggling with an appearently drunk, tenticuled, \n&gt; &gt; robot of unknown origin.  Neutronics pushed the gatering at the \n&gt; door \n&gt; &gt; aside and rushed the attacker.  He was knocked to the ground, but \n&gt; &gt; megatronics was able to knock the attacker away.  The mystery bot \n&gt; &gt; escaped through the window and into the night.  Megatronics \nhelped \n&gt; &gt; his brother to his feet.  They pull Organics up and Neutronics \nshut \n&gt; &gt; the door and rushed to his sister&#39;s side.  As he held her hand to \n&gt; &gt; reassure, his hand passed through her&#39;s, and the room grew black, \n&gt; &gt; Neutronics looked around, and instead of his protective older \n&gt; &gt; brother, the mighty Megatron stood rusting and laughing.  \n&gt; Neutronics \n&gt; &gt; covered his audio\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  recepters, until Megatron opened fire on them both.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Malice jolted awake, dropping the alarm clock in his hand.  \n&gt; &gt; Instantly, a monofiliment wire shot from his wrist.  it bounced \noff \n&gt; &gt; his index finger, pierced the clock housing, bounced off the \n&gt; &gt; insides, and exited to stick in the wall.  The clock slide down \nthe \n&gt; &gt; wire, till it rested on the floor.  He retracted the wire and \n&gt; looked \n&gt; &gt; around.  He saw Wolfblade was awake.  He picked Camoflage up \n&gt; gently, \n&gt; &gt; rested her in his lap, and swung his legs over the edge of the \n&gt; cargo \n&gt; &gt; net to face Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; :Good afternoon, I think.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She purred slightly as Malice stroked her head and nuzzled even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; closer to him.  Her mind was dreaming of past times. In her \n&gt; sleep, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she muttered, &quot; No, I don&#39;t want to go mommy. I can fight. I \n&gt; won&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; get rust sickness. Honest, I can stay, please let me stay \n&gt; mommy.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She whimpered a bit and calmed down. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She moved and rolled onto her back to see what had scratched \nher. \n&gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was Elita. She gently put her arm around the little sleeping \nbot \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sighed. SHe very gently stroked Elita&#39;s head and shoulders and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wondered how long the little bot had been there.  She thought \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; herself, Why do kids come around bots who have little to no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience with kids? I wonder if they do it on purpose just to \n&gt; &gt; raise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a bot&#39;s oil pressure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She turned her head to see that Malice had a little one \nsleeping \n&gt; &gt; at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his side as well.  She wondered why the kids came to his room \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sleep. THen something else occured to her. If kids could sneek \nin \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this place, how easy would it be for an enemiy to sneek in and \n&gt; &gt; kill \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them. Especially when they were sleeping. This thought \ndisturbed \n&gt; &gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to not let her fall back to sleep. She would wait for \nthe \n&gt; &gt; kids \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to wake up, then address the matter with Malice. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead \ninto \n&gt; &gt; damnation.
