His stare indicative of Ratchet =\r\nwhen he was ready to lose his temper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, Wheelie stoo=\r\nd up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.

So if you are going to say we should waste our =\r\ntime going after what does not exist, I say thee nay.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wheelie went on=\r\n, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for such a stupid thing, or I will go out on m=\r\ny own and bring.

Well he&#39;s dead. MEg=\r\natron blew off his head. And you seem to want Rodimus to end the same way. =\r\nSo I shall now not leave my friend astray.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And without a further word=\r\n, Wheelie transformed to his vehicle mode, and raced off!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC - This i=\r\ns how I see the character - at this point, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsense to=\r\n waste time looking for a Space Bridge that there&#39;s no evidence of or anyth=\r\ning remotely suggesting, based upon Tuscon having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s going i=\r\nnsubordinate and off on his own. TO him, a Space Bridge would e impossible =\r\nto hdie (a la the third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon), and so wastin=\r\ng time scanning for it is a fool&#39;s errand. So he&#39;s going off to &#39;look&#39; for =\r\nRodimus on his own, unless stopped or otherwis einterfered with as he&#39;s afr=\r\naid that Tuscon is purposefully stalling to prevent them from going after R=\r\nodimus. He respects Leo Prime, but he&#39;s friends with Rorimus, and he has a =\r\nvery low regard for Tuscon, and at this point in his processor Tuscon decid=\r\ning to check for something to him that has infinitesimal chances of having =\r\nbeen done and stall a gridwide search is abaondment of his friend.

IF WINGS GET=\r\nS BOOTED IT&#39;S ON YOUR BACK BUMPER!&quot;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He too l=\r\neaves the room as upset as Straight Shot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tucson l=\r\nooks back at them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Leo, keep Wheelie here, Talon=\r\n, if you could, I could use your help. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never had to console my s=\r\nister and I could use some advice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nightshift com=\r\nes back from his meditation at the river, only to almost hit Straight Shot,=\r\n while stopping short. &nbsp;He knew right away what was troubling her.&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Uh oh, lemme guess, Wheelie huh? &nbsp;Slag I knew =\r\nthat little bugger was trouble the moment he got here.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Straight Shot tries to compose herself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Ye=\r\nah you called that one right. &nbsp;And because of him, Tucson could lose h=\r\nis status. &nbsp;He&#39;s making my brother look like a fool and worst off is, =\r\n&nbsp;Leo isn&#39;t doing anything about it. &nbsp;Oh sure, ten ta one he&#39;s fav=\r\noring Wheelie, I see it, I&#39;m not stupid. &nbsp;Ooohhh! &nbsp;This whole thi=\r\nng makes me so mad I wanna jab every quill on my body into that little oran=\r\nge pest!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nightshift shifts into robot mode and si=\r\nts down with Straight Shot as does Rattrap , who puts a consoling arm aroun=\r\nd her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Hey, I know things don&#39;t look so cool rig=\r\nht now but I didn&#39;t hear your bro lose his temper, and I know when he does =\r\nbecause the whole base would&#39;ve heard him. &nbsp;That&#39;s why he&#39;s be&#39;n watch=\r\ned and so far so good. &nbsp;He may have handled himself nicely in there, f=\r\nrom what I can tell. &nbsp;And that&#39;s what the council looks for in a leade=\r\nr. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rattrap grins.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Goo=\r\nd point, never thought of it that way. &nbsp;Oh Wings actually told Leo ta =\r\ntransfer him outa the Ark and assign him to another troop.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nightshift nods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; That&#39;s cool, at least=\r\n he&#39;s still in the faction but different sanction. &nbsp;Not bad. &nbsp;Not=\r\n bad at all. &nbsp;I would&#39;ve done the same thing if I was in his shoes. &n=\r\nbsp;Now, Straight Shot, don&#39;t worry, your bro ain&#39;t go&#39;n anywhere but where=\r\n he is now. &nbsp;Trust me, as long as he keeps his temper in check and mak=\r\nes decisions for the benefit of our troops he&#39;ll be fine.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;He carefully puts an arm around his prickly comrade.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Aug 27=\r\n, 2011, at 10:50 PM, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:adamsafran@...=\r\nm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:adamsafran@...&quot;&gt;adamsafran@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ecxygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; An insult to =\r\nhis logic was definitely a test to Tucson&#39;s already short temper.  Yet he k=\r\nnew he had to keep that in check if he was to keep his position.  He turns =\r\nto Wheelie with a narrowed brow.  Yet not one word is said.  He then raises=\r\n it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hmmmm... So that&#39;s how you see me?  If I&#39;m not mi=\r\nstaken Wheelie I believe you have just crossed the line of insubordination.=\r\n  I&#39;m giving you a chance to be part of the team but I see nothing in retur=\r\nn on your part.  Well, care to explain to me the Autobot code of honor and =\r\nwhat happens when a soldier behaves out of line, going as far as insulting =\r\na Prime Officer?  You seem to be quite intelligent, go on, tell me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap and Straight Shot look to Wheelie in shock.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Looks like a certain little go cart&#39;s in for some serious discip=\r\nline. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot swallows hard.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&quot; His voice, it sounds just like Ratchet&#39;s voice when he was ready ta lose =\r\nit.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap watches with amusement.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&quot; Ooohhh so that&#39;s where Tucson&#39;s temper comes from.  Yep Wheelie is in big=\r\n trouble.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson eyes Wheelie with arms folded in his c=\r\nhest.  His stare indicative of Ratchet when he was ready to lose his temper=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt this point, Wheelie stood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are w=\r\nrong.  There&#39;s no such thing as a space bridge that strong.  You would simp=\r\nly see it from afar, with our own optics the sensors abar.  You cannot remo=\r\ntely hide such a hting, in the technology of our time or even that thing.  =\r\nTo do such a thing, to rip apart time, is stupidly absurd, I call it this t=\r\nime.  So if you are going to say we should waste our time going after what =\r\ndoes not exist, I say thee nay.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWheelie went on, &quot;So, stop wastin=\r\ng oru time for such a stupid thing, or I will go out on my own and bring.  =\r\nRodimus is my friend, I won&#39;t leave him alone to face his end.  If you are =\r\ngoin to be a boron, then I shall call you a nimrod and boron.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHis=\r\nsing, &quot;Now, I would say you are wasting our time, on pointless things that =\r\nwe needn&#39;t to whine.  So I say, I think you want my friend dead today.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the Laurel and Hardy back and forth of Rattrap and Straight SHot, =\r\nWheelie just laughed, &quot;And you bring up Ratchet?  Well he&#39;s dead.  MEgatron=\r\n blew off his head.  And you seem to want Rodimus to end the same way.  So =\r\nI shall now not leave my friend astray.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd without a further wor=\r\nd, Wheelie transformed to his vehicle mode, and raced off!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOOC - T=\r\nhis is how I see the character - at this point, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsen=\r\nse to waste time looking for a Space Bridge that there&#39;s no evidence of or =\r\nanything remotely suggesting, based upon Tuscon having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s go=\r\ning insubordinate and off on his own.  TO him, a Space Bridge would e impos=\r\nsible to hdie (a la the third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon), and so =\r\nwasting time scanning for it is a fool&#39;s errand.  So he&#39;s going off to &#39;loo=\r\nk&#39; for Rodimus on his own, unless stopped or otherwis einterfered with as h=\r\ne&#39;s afraid that Tuscon is purposefully stalling to prevent them from going =\r\nafter Rodimus.  He respects Leo Prime, but he&#39;s friends with Rorimus, and h=\r\ne has a very low regard for Tuscon, and at this point in his processor Tusc=\r\non deciding to check for something to him that has infinitesimal chances of=\r\n having been done and stall a gridwide search is abaondment of his friend. =\r\n Anyways, wondrful posting and good luck!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n=\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \t\t \t   \t\t  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n =\r\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/htm=\r\nl&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-58--905927422--\r\n\n"}}
