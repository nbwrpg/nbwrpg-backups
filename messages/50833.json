I intend to discuise myself as a \nMaximal and hence get into their organization, and send you \ninformation on all their operations, it&#39;s that simple.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; -- Switchblade / Megatron --\n&gt; \n&gt; Unoticed to Inferno and Quickstrike as they enter the Predacon \n&gt; control room, Switchblade was still in cyber bug form, connected to \n&gt; the base surveilance system. He&#39;d been listening to the \n&gt; conversations in the base entrance.\n&gt; \n&gt; To avoid suspicion, he quickly disconnects himself, and transforms \n&gt; into robot mode, quickly expanding as the rest of his body comes \nout \n&gt; of subspace. Not bothering to say anything, he simply observes \n&gt; Flicker and Pheonix intently, checking out their weaponry, and \n&gt; defensive abilities based on what he could analyse with his visions.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron enters the control room moments later behind Flicker, \n&gt; Pheonix, and the other Preds. He immediately goes over to the \n&gt; control chair, and sits down. His fingers click on a a keypad \n&gt; situated on side of the chair&#39;s arm. A disply appears above the \n&gt; holopad about a metre and a half in front of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The display showed a diagram of the explored portions of the world \n&gt; so far, and Megatron wanted to know whether Wolfenstein, Flicker, \n&gt; Pheonix, or Skulletron had anything to add to the map. He turned \nhis \n&gt; attentions to Flicker, instead of the diagram.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Flicker, you had a plan. So, put it into the computer, and do tell \n&gt; about it. Leave no details out.&quot; Megatron smiles a smile which \n&gt; expressed his intrest in what Flicker had proposed. &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t \n&gt; waste too much time, I have other matters to deal with, like \n&gt; planning the assault on the Tripreds for their insolent attack on \n&gt; our base. Those fools will not go unpunished.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Without looking as Switchblade, his eyes narrow, &quot;Switchblade... I \n&gt; see you&#39;ve found your way out of the CR chamber.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yah, something like that Megs...&quot; Switchblade nearly yawns, \n&gt; expressing his apparent boredom. &quot;I wonder if the Tripreds have one \n&gt; of those artifact piec--&quot; He cuts off, leaving Megatron and the \n&gt; others to fill in the thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; The possibility that the Tripreds had one of the pieces of artifact \n&gt; was strongly possibe... something that would have to be looked \ninto. \n&gt; Megatron considers it, then his mind shifts back to the present \n&gt; situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron waits for Flicker, signaling for the other Preds to let \nhim \n&gt; talk.\n\n\n"}}
