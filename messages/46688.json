Definitely will turn out to be=\r\n \nof some help at one point or another. Oh, and if anyone cares, I say \ntha=\r\nt instead of making a sequel, we should just restart. It would \nreally help=\r\n people, I think, to get a character and stick with them \nthrough the story=\r\nline enthusiastically if someone who didn&#39;t get a \nchance to be influential=\r\n in this game got the option of helping build \nfrom a clean slate and work =\r\non their own part of the storyline. That \nway they could feel like their ch=\r\naracter and gaming posts actually \nhave an impact on the world if they didn=\r\n&#39;t get that chance this time \naround. \n\n(IC)\nSkullhammer laughed. The deep,=\r\n gravelly laugh came from deep within \nhis mechanical vocal system. &quot;Join y=\r\nou! I wish! Have you seen this \nbody? The sensory suite of my pod launched =\r\nearly and read an \nelephant. I also came in WAY off course.&quot; He smiled, pau=\r\nsed, and \nstood still for a moment. &quot;It was intended that I come to the \nAu=\r\ntobots to get a vehicular form, and thus I was supposed to land \nhere, at t=\r\nhe base. Or close to, anyway. However, my pod&#39;s computer \nscrewed up my thr=\r\nusters all to slag. I came in far to low and early \nand screamed right over=\r\n=85what did they call it? Umm, Africa? Yes. The \ncomputers burnt right out =\r\nand launched the sensory orb. I ended up \nlike this. Eh, I was sent to help=\r\n the allied Maximal forces here on \nEarth in part anyway. They prepared me =\r\nfor the eventuality of \nbecoming an animal. I would have preferred my old f=\r\norm, however.&quot;\n\nSkullhammer walks closer to Pacifix and inclines his head a=\r\n \nlittle. &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to stick around the Autobot base, and \nsee s=\r\nome familiar styles and procedures, I suppose I have to at least \nrepot to =\r\nthe Maximals. Whereabouts are the friendly bases? And what \nis the Maximal =\r\nand allied forces statuses on this planet?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
