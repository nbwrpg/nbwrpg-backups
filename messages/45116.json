Halo&#39;s so fun.  It&#39;s just mind blowing.\n&gt;  I thought the graphics \n&gt;   for Delta Force Land Warrior on computer were\n&gt; good.  No where close.  I&#39;ve \n&gt;   got stock in Microsoft, heh, so I&#39;m kind of going\n&gt; with Xbox.  Not to mention \n&gt;   I haven&#39;t bought a Nintendo game system since\n&gt; Super Nintendo.  Not to mention \n&gt;   Xbox has DOA3 and should come out with a cool WWF\n&gt; game.  Tho I still want to \n&gt;   get Smackdown: Just Bring It for PS2 to see how it\n&gt; compares to that horrible \n&gt;   Smackdown 2 game....yuck.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   -L.U.\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
