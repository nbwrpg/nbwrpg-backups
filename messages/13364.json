After a suitable lifeform was found,\nthe bot inside, named Dollen, heard banging on the stasis pod, and someone\ntalking to him.  The stasis pod opened up, and Dollen stepped out.\n\n            Dollen looked at GoldenEye.  He suddenly thought about dreams\nand visions he had been having about a female bot.  The female bot he kept\nhaving visions about was beautiful.  But, he did not know her name, or\nanything.  He looked at GoldenEye again.  No.  This bot wasn&#39;t the one.  He\nlooked at her symbol.  Then he looked at his.  She wasn&#39;t an enemy.  She was\non his side, or so it appeared.  He had to make sure.  He looked at his\nsignature detector.  Yes, she was a Predacon, on his side.\n\n                  &quot;Ah, nice to meet you.  My name is Dollen.  I see your a\nPredacon, like me,&quot; Dollen stopped, and grabbed a little thing from his arm\nstorage compartment.  Inside it was creamy stuff, and then Dollen put some\non his finger, and rubbed it on his Pred symbol, which was located on his\nchest.  He grabbed a cloth out of his arm as well, which was odd, as you\ndon&#39;t see too many bots with a cloth.  He rubbed his symbol with the cloth,\nand then his symbol was shiny and clean.  He put the stuff back in his\ncompartment.\n\n           &quot;Sorry about that little pause, I had to polish my symbol, to\nshow that I respect my title as a Predacon.  Anyway, what is your name?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
