His wings, no \nlonger used for keeping the two bots up, hug Iron Raptor closer to \nhim.\n\nHe was irrationaly happy, and that slightly annoyed him. When Iron \nRaptor relaxed in his arms, though, the annoyance dissapeared to be \nreplaced by a giddy feeling. Prowl closes his eyes, relieved that \nIron Raptor had accepted the kiss.\n\n&quot;Ahem...,&quot; a rather embarrased voice came from behind the two bots, \n&quot;Excuse me, but if you two could spare a moment, I&#39;d like to know \nwhat I&#39;ve missed.&quot;\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes widen as he hears the voice behind him. Keeping one arm \nand one wing around Iron Raptor, he rather reluctantly turns to face \nthe bot that had just spoke. His eyes widen even farther as he sees \nthe damaged bot.\n\n&quot;Striker!&quot; he says, resisting an irational urge to punch his \ncommander in the nose, &quot;Where have you been?&quot;\n\nStriker looks at Prowl and Iron Raptor, one eyebrow slightly raised. \n&quot;To the Matrix and back. Me and Zenyak nearly killed each other.&quot;\n\nProwl nods. &quot;We picked up Zenyak a little while back.&quot;\n\nStriker looks at the two bots and grins. &quot;I see that you also picked \nup a ... bonus,&quot; he says, looking at Iron Raptor.\n\nProwl blushes. &quot;Iron Raptor, this is my commander, Striker.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
