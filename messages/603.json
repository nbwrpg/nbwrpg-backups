She didn&#39;t like the way that Cyber Claw spoke \nto her but there wasn&#39;t much that she could do about it, she just had to put \nup with the banter until Megatron was dead...then she wouldn&#39;t have to put \nup with this clone any longer!\nShe snapped her head around and came snout to snout with Cyber Claw, she \nsnarled...*\n\n&quot; Mind I remind you that it was YOU who asked to come with US. So settle \ndown and hold your horses, alright. We&#39;ll get where ever we&#39;re going when we \nget there and not before!&quot;\n\n* She looked ahead again and began to make her way towards the signatures \nthat she was still detecting, she wasn&#39;t truly angry but she had enough to \nthink about without a loud mouth clone bitching at her!*\n\n&quot; Now, come on.&quot;\n\n*Carnage sighed and looked around, they were near the signatures but there \nwas nothing there. Just...the sea.\nShe came to the edge of the beach and opened her com-link to a Maximal&#39;s \nonly frequency...*\n\n&quot; This is to any Maximals in the area, we request permission to make \ncontact. Our coordinates are 315.668. Please respond.&quot;\n\n* She listened to the static of her open channel, the signatures were there \nbut she just couldn&#39;t seem to find them with her optics. Her system&#39;s showed \nthat they were only a few hundred clicks ahead of them but there was nothing \nthere...but blue sea.*\n\n(She is in front of the island on the mainland.)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
