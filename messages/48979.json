He\nlanded behind Nightshade.  He grabbed at her neck and\nattempted (happy know) to get the sword across her\nthroat.\n\nSunhawk:  I wouldn&#39;t do that if I was you.  Now throw\nany of those weapons that come off on the ground, and\nany that don&#39;t throw down all your ammunition.\n\nHe turned on his comm to Talos.\n\nSunhawk:  TALOS, BOTH PREDS ARE LOOSE!  I&#39;M TRYING TO\nRESTRAIN THEM, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEND HOT ROD BACK\nHERE.  HE WAS SUPPOSE TO GUARD THE FEMALE SO THIS IS\nHIS MESS!  HE SHOULD HELP ME CLEAN IT UP!\n\n--- RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to face Sunhawk. A normal bot would not be\n&gt; able to respond, but DrillBit did not have to draw\n&gt; any weapon.\n&gt; Within a blink of an eye, DrillBit&#39;s right hand had\n&gt; converted to its gattaling gun mode, and was\n&gt; shooting 50 caliber rounds rapidly. Also machine gun\n&gt; fire erupted from all six of DrillBit&#39;s insect legs,\n&gt; as well as two optic photon lasers. All of this was\n&gt; right at Sunhawk at close range.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Ok to make this more clear, DB just unleashed\n&gt; the fire power of a small army on Sunhawk without\n&gt; flinching. And if I&#39;m right, Sunhawk is facing\n&gt; DrillBit and another Predacon, and also has\n&gt; Nightshade behind him. Closed in, three to one.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo! Music Experience\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
