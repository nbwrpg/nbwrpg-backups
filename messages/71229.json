I added it\nin, but it is not as smooth as I would have liked it to be. Ahh well\nsuch is life. Good posting Sandy by the way! :)\n\nIC:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson turns to Legacy on a dime. He did not like his tone of voice, and\n&gt; felt that his explanation could have been a little less brash. Especially\n&gt; when you&#39;re addressing a Prime officer. His expression hardens quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I appreciate your concerns but I do NOT appreciate your tone of voice!\n&gt; It&#39;s as if you&#39;re trying to stop me from doing what needs to be done! This\n&gt; war can not be fought by ourselves, they out number us! And I will do\n&gt; everything in my power to be sure that our numbers stay stable!&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; She nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, sometimes the unthinkable must be the thinkable. It was his way of\n&gt; saying that in desperate times, desperate measures can not be avoided. \n&gt; Even\n&gt; if the balance of time does get disrupted.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Exactly. We need help, and maybe it isn&#39;t time to wake up Optimus Prime,\n&gt; but we must try and revive others to assist us in battle. Legacy, I warn\n&gt; you now, insubordination will not be tolerated. Am I understood?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy stood his ground, his stance not aggressive but simply solid\nand ready as he watched Tuscon. If Legacy had any fear of Tuscon or\nthe power that he possessed or the anger that may be unleashed there\nwas not a hint of it on Legacy�s face or demeanor. Neither was there\nany hint of it in his next statement. �Your rank and objectives are\nduly noted and are at this juncture irrelevant.�\n\nLegacy�s words are completely devoid of anger, aggression and tact.\nThey are instead just simple statements of fact as he sees them.\n\n�Legacy what are you doing?� A voice rippled across the room � LORD\nELDER! �You can�t stand against a Prime!�\n\n�I am a temporal guardian sent back to insure that all things unfold\nas they should and I will stand against any force that would attempt\nto disrupt that.� Legacy folded his arms behind his back, which had\nthe affect of focusing his weapons away from Tuscon. There was still\nno hint of aggression in his tone or stance, and for a bot as\npowerfully built as Legacy that was a difficult task. Legacy was tall\nand sturdily built and he was, except for his color, was an exact\n�physical� replica of Shockblast; He bore a cannon on one hand and the\nother hand that WAS a cannon and he possessed a remorseless\nunflinching cyclopean gaze with which he was currently directing at\nTuscon.\n\nElder, who looked startlingly bigger and more robust stepped into the\nroom, walking to stand between Legacy and Tuscon. �I am not talking\nabout COMBAT.� He said looking at the tall form of Legacy, �I am\ntalking about respect, chain of command, duty, honor, the things we\nMaximals stand for.�\n\nLegacy looked down at Lord Elder, his single optic pulsing\nthoughtfully, �Your emotional adherence to respect is inefficient, I\ncould not allow any disturbance to the Autobots and Decepticons that\nlay here.�\n\nLord Elder patted Legacy on the shoulder, having to reach up slightly\nto do so. �I know Legacy, I know, but it is what makes us different\nfrom the predacons.�\n\nLegacy paused obviously not agreeing.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor looked at tucson and said coldy &quot;that&#39;s a strategy that we \n&gt; cannot\n&gt; afford, but&quot;he added with another tone&quot;We can ask to pacificus Maximals to\n&gt; join us... and fuse both factions, that will give us enough streght to \n&gt; face\n&gt; hydras and whoever dares to challenge us... By now we must to find a way \n&gt; to\n&gt; protect the ark&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLord Elder nodded as he turned to Perceptor and the others, �Yes! We\ncan attempt to bring in others help us.� Lord Elder glanced between\nTuscon and Legacy hoping that Tuscon would catch the hint, you can�t\nbrow beat Legacy, you have to reason with him.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson acknlowedges Perceptor but still holds a rather cold expression on \n&gt; his face, which was mostly meant for Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Very well Perceptor, I will hold off until we are able to contact the \n&gt; Pacificus Maximals. If we can not reach them, then we might have to resort \n&gt; to other measures.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy appears unaffected by Tuscon�s cold glance, however the shield\nthat was over Optimus Prime dropped. Lord Elder just shook his head as\nhe stepped out from between them breathing an audiable sigh of relief,\nhopefully the disaster has been averted for the moment.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Without further word, Tucson quietly walks over to the body of Optimus \n&gt; Prime, and just stands beside him. It would appear that Straight Shot was \n&gt; right. He had learned so much, but missed the opportunity to learn the \n&gt; wisdom he feared he was missing. He kneels in front of the sleeping \n&gt; Autobot Commander.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Once again I almost made a costly mistake. I learned so much from my \n&gt; comrades and I&#39;m grateful for the knowledge they&#39;ve given me, but still, \n&gt; Optimus, I wish I could have learned your wisdom. I could really use it \n&gt; now. So much happening at once and I don&#39;t know where to begin doing \n&gt; something about it. I should know these things by now, that&#39;s why I was \n&gt; given the power of leadership. I can&#39;t let them down, not this time. My \n&gt; comrades have seen enough grief, they don&#39;t need any more of it. Now I \n&gt; wish we did have time to work together, one on one. That way I would be \n&gt; prepared for what comes next.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy said nothing as Tuscon turned away and began talking with\nOptimus Prime. After noting Tuscon�s actions Legacy also turned and\nwalked away, seemingly harboring no ill will for Tuscon, his only goal\nthe protection of the Ark and most notably the current time stream.\n\n[MEANWHILE IN THE MEDBAY]\n\nRodimus sat over his wife as she seemed to waken . . .\n\n&gt; Nightligh tried to make a big sfort to sit down but her energy\n&gt; levels, on purpose, were to low for that, she stopped too weak to\n&gt; move and said &quot;Rodimus... Are you you?... Is that nightmare finaly\n&gt; over????&quot;\n\nRodimus leaned close to her so that she could clearly hear his words\nand see his face. �Yes my love, the darkness has past, the nightmare\nhas ended.�\n\nRodimus smiled warmly and encouragingly as he gently turned up her\npower levels a little and helped her sit up. �You are safe at the\nArk.�\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
