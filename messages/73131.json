Gesturing over at BACKSTOP, the small mechanoid said\n&gt; quietly, &quot;Can you say what is going on?  I still have not heard a story of\n&gt; what is wrong.  How did GRIMLOCK and them all get down here?&quot;  He had not\n&gt; seen his &#39;friends&#39; since the end of the GREAT WAR and the final battles\n&gt; between AUTOBOT and DECEPTICON, before the GREAT REFORMATTING had taken\n&gt; place and most had been UPGRADED to MAXIMAL and PREDACON.\n&gt;\n&gt; So how had GRIMLOCK and his team gotten sent several hundred vorns over into\n&gt; the past, to the BEAST WARS?\n\nBACKSTOP was still looking over at GRIMLOCK and the other DINOBOTS,\nhis expression both elated and yet confused.\n\n&quot;The story, if told in its entirety would be quite long.&quot; BACKSTOP\nsaid as he turned his attention to WHEELIE, &quot;You see Grimlock used to\nwork with me in the diplomatic corp . . . .&quot; He paused for a moment as\nif he didn&#39;t want to admit the next part, &quot; . . . as did Magmatron.&quot;\n\nBACKSTOP waved his hand to forestall any objections to this story,\n&quot;Yes, I know, everyone knows Magamtron was a Decepticon general, but\nhe came to see that the only way for Cybertron was to survive was to\nstop the war.&quot; BACKSTOP frowned, &quot;At least that&#39;s what I thought,\nuntil he showed he had his own agenda.&quot;\n\nGRIMLOCK shook his head, &quot;Me Grimlock starting to remember. Dinobots\nknow Magmatron.&quot;\n\nLooking at GRIMLOCK there was a nod from BACKSTOP, &quot;Of course, since\nafter the war you worked for Magmatron, even after his defection.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
