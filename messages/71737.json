Now exhausted, he&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; tries to catch his breath. Yet he looks to Leo Prime as he fights to =\r\nkeep&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his head and long neck up off the shuttle floor.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot; Leo Prime, the best thing to do is to relinquish his Prime status a=\r\nnd&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; revert him back to Hot Rod, where he can do no harm.  From now =\r\non, until I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; am restored, I ask that you assume all leadership duti=\r\nes while I recover.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Promise me you will - do as I request?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He can no longer hold up his head and lays it back on the floor=\r\n.  Yet he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; looks to Stanton while conversing with Leo Prime.  It wa=\r\ns clear to him that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus was quite comfortable where he was and=\r\n that now it was time to do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something about him.  The silver drago=\r\nn hardens to the idea of having to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fight against a friend who now =\r\nproves to be his greatest foe.  A look of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sheer determination cove=\r\nrs his face as he remains grounded for the time&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; being.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&l=\r\nt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Of course.&quot; LEO PRIME said calmly over the comlink. Alm=\r\nost as if LEO&lt;br&gt;\nPRIME could hear his thoughts he said, &quot;We all have weakn=\r\nesses and&lt;br&gt;\nfoilbles and things that cause us to do things that we would =\r\nnot&lt;br&gt;\nordinarilly want or desire to do.&quot; There was a thoughtful pause fro=\r\nm&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME, &quot;But sometimes our greatest foe is not the enemy without,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nbut we ourselves.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO paused again and then said, &quot;Rest. I th=\r\nink we all need to discuss&lt;br&gt;\nthis with calmer heads. I will see you when =\r\nyou get back to the Ark.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven as TUSCON was getting that rest the=\r\n shuttle was turned back to&lt;br&gt;\nthe Ark, SILVERBOLT was a priority. The oth=\r\ner FUZORS and TALON would&lt;br&gt;\nhave to make it for a little while longer.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- en=\r\nd group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-9-293545283--\r\n\n"}}
