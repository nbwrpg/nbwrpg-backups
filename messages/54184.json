She was \ndreaming of a home that no longer existed.  Her home planet of \nKapaflax was once like Cybertron. Made of metal and home to billions \nof bots. Then the plague came.  Now all that was left was a rust \ncloud that floated about in space.  She was put into a pod and \nevacuated from the planet by her parents before the plague could get \nto her.  She was 5 when she was put into the pod.  Now she was 9 \nyears old.  She slept and dreamed of times gone by. She muttered in \nher sleep, &quot;Yes Mommy, I&#39;ll get Daddy to fix the subspace \nentertainment connection. The Heavily Injured Bots Emergency Bay is \non tonight. It should be a good one tonight.&quot;  She rolled over in \nher sleep and smiled. \n\n\n"}}
