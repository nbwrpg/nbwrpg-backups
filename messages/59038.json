Of course, this \nexcludes December 17. So here comes the rest of the meteor charge. \nRemember that the minions are NPCs and are thus EXTREMELY powerful. \nHowever, they can be killed... theoretically... mwa hahahaha!\n\nBIC:\n\nRockseeker was well protected by his rock hard shell. He was almost \noblivious to the shots that converged on him. However, His armor was \nslowly blasting away, but he knew he could damage the base.\n\nInside, though, Yggdrasil Prime (remember him?) suddenly came out of \nCR and, through his various electronics, understood the situation. \nHe rushed to the defense system and diverted all power to the \nshields.\n\nRockseeker was only meters away when he was stopped by a massive \nenergy surge as the shields came online. It caused him to yell in \npain and to transform. He was thrown back in the battlefield.\n\nAzureBlade swooped down on that easy target. He breathed a jet of \nfreezing air that covered and partly paralyzed the Minion. Still \nairbound, he swung his tail and sent him rolling.\n\nAzureBlade: Kup! He&#39;s yours! I&#39;m going agaisnt that one!\n\nHe took altitude and prepared for a gigantic duel...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: in the past couple Moves He and Rockseeker were getting into \nit. He was on an intercepting course. They are battling infront of \nthe Maximal base ams the Weapon he is using is a sword that has a \nPar, attack which renders the target parylized for a short period of \ntime. See Ancient threw two daggers at Rockseeker and now is moving \nto intercept rockseeker. Rockseeker was on a course as a meteor to \nthe maximal base.\n&gt; \n&gt; EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:In a message dated 12/10/03 8:10:43 PM \nCentral Standard Time, jeramej@y... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ancient: Closes in on his target and Strikes with a parylizing \nBlow.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Am I missing something there?
