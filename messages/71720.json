It&#39;s not long before she becomes the creature which made\n&gt; her curious.  She looks to her new robot mode which has her armored with\n&gt; sharp projectile quills on her upper armor, gauntlets and boots.  Her helm\n&gt; remains the same as before as her facial features show a slight hint of the\n&gt; animal&#39;s feature.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, I guess this sorta does kind of fit me.  Ohh boy, wait till Tucson\n&gt; gets a load of this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift looks to her in awe.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; YOU KIDD&#39;N ME!? THAT IS ONE KICK AFT BEAST FORM!  Just think, no Preds\n&gt; gonna mess with ya now, those quills are sharp, barbed and take a slag of a\n&gt; time ta pull out.  Nice change up Straight Shot.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;BAH!&quot; SCOURGE said as he watched STRAIGHT SHOT undergo her\ntransformation and become something else. &quot;This is foolishness.&quot; There\nwas no fear that could be seen on SCOURGE but there did seem to be a\ngrowing sense of annoyance and impatience on his part. He was mumbling\nsomething about him being a warrior and not a slaggin spy.\n\n&quot;Come on!&quot; he said obviously talking to his sweeps and perhaps\nWASPINATOR as he turned away from NIGHTSHIFT and the newly changed\nMaximal, he was still carrying the strange alien device that DARK\nRODIMUS had dropped. &quot;Maybe this can help us find out where he went.&quot;\nThere was a chuckle, &quot;*IF* he made it.&quot;\n\nThey began to fly into the air, one sweep following SCOURGE and the\nother two going off in a different direction - the same direction that\nCYCLONUS and RODIMUS had taken.\n\nAround them the other Predacons were pulling out as well, heading off\ninto the distance. WASPINATOR just sighed and followed as well.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
