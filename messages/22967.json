Im Megatron, youre Commander.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Aracnia and Gremlin looked on the monitor of a large \nsolitary \n&gt; computer. On it was the blueprints of the vessle. Taking her claw, \nAracnia \n&gt; traced out a path they could take.\n&gt;        &quot;This corridor has only three internal autoguns, we can take \nthose out \n&gt; in a snap. All we need to do is to get in...here.&quot; She said, \nresting her claw \n&gt; on a small room. \n&gt;        Gremlin leaned closer, and then it hit him, what she was \nthinking was \n&gt; a good idea, and a perfect wa to get the drop on the Rebels and \nmost \n&gt; importantly to get Quickstrike.\n\n\n"}}
