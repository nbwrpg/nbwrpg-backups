She walks \ndown the snow covered slopes leaving huge tracks as she walks. She is \ncalled by something in her spark to come down from her home in the \nsnow covered north and travel down to the hot lands below. It takes \nher 3 months to climb down the the mountain sides and to the valley \nbelow.  She was in no hurry for some reason.  But felt drawn to \ncomplete a mission set for her long before she was created.\n\nShe stopped at the base of the mountains and looked around. She \nlooked southward and followed her nose and instincts.  She would stay \non her course until she found her destination.  She walked along and \nwould patiently keep walking day and night until she would arrive tot \nhe place that called her.  THE ARK was were she was headed.\n\nName: SnowCat\nBeast Mode : Snow Leopard\nBot Mode : Sleek, white body color \nAlliegnment: Maximal\nRank : none\nWeapons: Claws, Teeth, Optics Lazars, Short sword.\n\n\n"}}
