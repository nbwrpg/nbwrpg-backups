I think though you are getting the posts late. \n\nHere is a synopsis:\n\nAs I said above the intruder was cloaked and came in with the shuttle and hid as the others moved to the interior of the base. He left one of his spider-spies in the shuttle bay room, and had one follow Rodimus and crew. The spy observed the transformation process of Dark rodimus, and as Hydras and crew left the dormant  Rodimus alone the Spy tried to download as much as it could from him. At the same time the intruder snuck into the interior and tried much the same thing with the mainframe, but was detected by Perceptor. Hydras ordered the base lowered, and Dark Rodimus awakened. He also at that time ordered Trelos to hunt the intruder down.\n\nMeanwhile, upon the intruder&#39;s detection the spider spy with Rodimus transmitted its info and set itself to blow while attached to Rodimus&#39; neck, at the same time the intruder set the computer he had hacked to continuously send raise and open commands to the base, to delay the lowering. He then took off from his post to the shuttle bay. \n\nPerceptor got the spy from Dark Rodimus, giving the intruder time enough to allow the doors to open without interfearence and apparently escape. Although the spy, now seperate from Rodimus still looks intent on blowing.\n\nActually I thought Trelos would catch up to the intruder in the shuttle bay, but it looks like you are responding to old posts?? I&#39;m not sure ... Then again there may have been some confusion as we jumped through different topics/subject titles? \n\nI tried to contact you via YIM, but you were mobile. \n\nPreston\n\n-- Original Message ----\nFrom: Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt;\nTo: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Friday, February 15, 2008 2:53:40 PM\nSubject: Re: Within Hydras&#39; base\n\n\nAs Trelos quietly aproached the computer room the smell grew stronger.\nHis sensitive ears could hear the sound of the intruder&#39;s slight\nmovements as he accessed the computer.\n\nOOC: I curious how the intruder found the base... he must have watched\nthem come back in the shuttle and got lucky enough to see where it\nlanded.\n\nOn 2/12/08, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because while the others where distracted with Hot-Rod, this\n&gt; &gt; secretive\n&gt; &gt; being had another goal, and cloaked in silence and shadow he was well\n&gt; &gt; on his way.\n&gt;\n&gt; As the Decepticons and Predicons moved around the base, the dark shadow\n&gt; slipped from one nook to another.
