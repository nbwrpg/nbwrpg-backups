Yet, he makes no moves to attack them.  The\n&gt; average panther would have lunged and swiped at the Humans, yet he does\n&gt; nothing of the sort.  He senses something different about these Humans.\n&gt; They did not seem to belong in the time period they were in.  They weren&#39;t\n&gt; Protohuman. Therefore, he didn&#39;t need to keep his cover. He converts to\n&gt; robot mode, looks to the dart and back at the Humans.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ll hit you guys on tak&#39;n this  out later, but seriously, I know you\n&gt; aren&#39;t from around here so you got some big time explaining ta do.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He stands put, arms folded into his chest, and a sharp eye on the Human who\n&gt; shot him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And don&#39;t even think about nail&#39;n me with that thing again.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Ahh yes, a Maximal.&quot; The voice, the one that gave the command earlier\ncould be heard, it had an arrogant humor in it as it spoke. He walked\nup carrying what could only be a flashlight, something totally unheard\nof for the protohumans - The flashlight was strapped to his wrist.\n&quot;You are smaller than your Autobot cousins, but everything we heard\nabout you is all the same.&quot;\n\nThe figure shined the light at NIGHTSHIFT for a moment and then down\nthe hall beyond him and then back. it showed that the gates covered\nthe entire width and nearly height of the tunnel on both sides.\n\n&quot;Come.&quot; The lead figure said to the other two. &quot;We have what we need,\nlet us check on the Predacons.&quot;\n\nThey turn to walk back down the tunnel in the direction they came in.\n\nOOC: Keep in mind Nightshift is trapped between two strong gates, one\non each side of him. Perceptor and Windlord are on one side of the two\ngates, the side nearest the entrance and the humans are on the other\nside of the two gates - the side going further down the tunnels.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
