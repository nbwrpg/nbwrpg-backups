Some of us are offended by that language, so go f***\nyourself\n&gt; (LOL).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyways, about the argument between Thecode and Crow Lord: Thecode has a\n&gt; point. Suukie was already in the CR chamber. And as Thecode mentioned,\nthere\n&gt; is a shield aroung the base. But just for future refference, if Suukies\nparts\n&gt; were laying around still, Crow Lord could have taken them and it wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; have been moding, since Suukie is disabled.\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Missing old school friends?
