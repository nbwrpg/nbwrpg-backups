These bugs were programmed \nfor survival, they intended to keep it that way. (Even though they \ntechnically aren&#39;t alive.)\n\nIn the distance one of the babies watched and waited. it too shut \ndown in case the pulse was strong enough to eliminate it too. Its day \nwould come, just not today.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Famine heard the noise...&quot;Damn the bugs are still alive...lets try \nsomething \n&gt; new.&quot; He sent another pulse.
