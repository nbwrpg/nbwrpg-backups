She wanted to go back home as \nmuch \n&gt;   as Vulois did.  She looked at him, &quot;Ah,  We need to find a safe \nplace \n&gt;   to stay while we do this.  Uh, we can use the cave. So far as I \nknow, \n&gt;   we are the only ones that know about this cave.&quot;  She thought \nabout \n&gt;   the cord in her shoulder.  It would serve as a link connection, \nbut \n&gt;   she hoped her programs would be able to stand up to Vulois.  If \nhis \n&gt;   anti-tamper programs were too strong, she wouldn&#39;t be able to get \n&gt;   in.  She looked at Cybershark and smiled,&quot;Well, I guess then you \nget \n&gt;   first watch huh?&quot; she tilted her head slighty and gave him  a \nwarm \n&gt;   smile. She took a step forward and kissed his cheek.&quot; Thank you.&quot;\n&gt;   She then walked into the cave. She smiled and looked around,&quot;You \n&gt;   know, a few curtains, a little paint, a few more windows, and \nthis \n&gt;   place would be down right cozzy.&quot; she said with a chuckle.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Vulois\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Vulois&#39; face lit up with a smile.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &quot;I would do anything to get back to Cybertron.
