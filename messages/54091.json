She could feel \nher body regenerating in the chamber.  She was starting to fall \nasleep when her internal program alarms went off.  She was being \nreprogrammed.  Tried as she could to fight, her power levels were \nnot high enough to have her fail safe programs put up the firewalls \nand protect her main programs.  She was being reprogrammed to have \nher loyalties for this new bot whom she had never met yet.  She \ncould feel the program download into her mainframe.  Her loyalty was \nnow for Hydras.
