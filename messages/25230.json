It was gone, there was no question of that. He \nlooked back at the battle, his eyes traveling over the charred \nterrain and the fighting bots. There was no longer a point to this. \n\n&quot;Everyone let&#39;s get out of here. We need to find a base.&quot; Even as he \nsaid that over his comm, he had an idea where they could \ngo. &quot;DrillBit, tell the troops a place for all of us to meet up. \nWe&#39;ll disguss getting a new base when we&#39;re there.&quot;\n\nHe began to back up, his foot catching on a root. He nearly fell \nover, but regained his balance and kept going.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer yelled as shots hit him and dented his armor, which was \ngiving way by now. He recieved Killfest&#39;s order and jumped up, firing \nat Shockwave as he backed up.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther turned at Killfest&#39;s order, flying after the Predacon co-\nCommander.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven threw Aerostreak off him, retreating after Killfest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDemise growled, stomping off after Killfest. He had just gotten to \nthis battle, and he was not happy about retreating. He smashed his \nfist through a tree before resuming to walk after Killfest.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGoldeneye opened her eyes, groaning. She sat up and launched into the \nair. Recieving Killfest&#39;s transmission, she flew off toward DrillBit.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Shockwave:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The robot&#39;s sensors and sight kept track on where EndBringer had \nended up \n&gt; after Shockwave&#39;s missiles had blown.  He targeted the bush, firing \noff 25 \n&gt; rapid laser blasts from his nosecone at the patch of plant.\n\n\n"}}
