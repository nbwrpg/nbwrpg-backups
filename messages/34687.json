He glanced from \nthe top of his building to a &#39;chosen bot&#39;. &quot;He could&#39;ve fought my \nsuspension...he could&#39;ve....&quot; he roared out blasting a missile a \ncouple miles dead onto a target he made.  He looked back down to the \nchosen bot, JetV, and how he was sad for having to go.  He wanted to \ncry out take me instead of this panzy.  But he kept his cool, this \ntime.  He got up and begane to stroll. A walk down memory lane of his \nfriendship with Pacifix.\n&quot;NO!&quot; he cried.\n&quot;He will not leave without me&quot; he said to himself and began his way \ntowards the docking bays of the Autobot&#39;s base on Cybertron\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers8@n... wrote:\n&gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; JetV got the news of his recruitment to Pacifix team.  He was happy \n&gt; at first...but then learned of the danger.  He just rode around \n&gt; through the lanes on Cybertron roaming looking for an answer. He \nhad \n&gt; always been a coward. Which is why when he was recruited to the \n&gt; Autobots took a scout job. &#39;Stay out of the way of trouble...and it \n&gt; will stay out of the way of me&#39; he would say to himself.  How the \n&gt; fickle evil called fate plays it&#39;s cards on the unwanting.  As he \n&gt; roamed the streets of a war torn sector he noticed the damage left \n&gt; behind. Bots offline....no place left for them but the Matrix. And \nas \n&gt; he came upon a young bot...like himself only lees spark if none at \n&gt; all he had is answer to his dillema. He would go on this journey. \nThe \n&gt; horror that the Decipticons deal on Cybertron shall not be allowed \nto \n&gt; transpire on another planet.  He stood starring at the young bot \nthen \n&gt; wheeled around and took off heading for the housings of Pacifix.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- Autobots / Pacifix / Crossroads ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An interesting Decepticon transmission was captured by an \n&gt; &gt; Autobot spy. When decoded, the Autobots discovered that the \n&gt; &gt; Decepticons had spread out, and were trying to dominate other \n&gt; &gt; regions, and upset the fragile balance of power. The Decepticons \n&gt; &gt; had gone to a planet, Earth. (the coordinates were in the \n&gt; &gt; transmision) The Autobot Council was troubled. They needed to do \n&gt; &gt; something. The sole proposition to the council came from a young \n&gt; &gt; courageous leader; Pacifix. He suggested that they Autobots send \n&gt; &gt; a secret mission to the planet and even the odds, without telling \n&gt; &gt; the Decepticons what was going on. That way no power struggles \n&gt; &gt; would ensue. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Autobot Council, after several long weeks of indecision, came \n&gt; &gt; to an agreement. The would send Pacifix as the group commander, \n&gt; &gt; and allow him to choose several bots that he feels are suited for \n&gt; &gt; the task. Pacifix took the task solemly and began to pick bots he \n&gt; &gt; felt were worth. He chose Jazz as his second in command, he \n&gt; &gt; chose Metalwarhawk, Bumblebee, Crossroads a strategist, JetV a \n&gt; &gt; scout. He was forced to leave his best friend, Crotale, behind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pacifix rose from his partial slumber and yawns. &quot;Hello world.&quot; \nHe \n&gt; &gt; looks solemly out the window, a world that he wouldn&#39;t see in a \n&gt; &gt; couple of Cybertronian days. A world that he would regret having \nto \n&gt; &gt; leave, but the adventure! He had made sure the day before that \n&gt; &gt; Crotale knew that he was leaving, but he was surprised that he \n&gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t recieved a message yet. He conacted Crossroads and \n&gt; &gt; asked him to drop off another message for Crotale, &quot;Crossroads, \n&gt; &gt; would you please drop off another message for my friend, Crotale?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Crossroads, who was streaming down the Cybertron Freeway at \n&gt; &gt; the time, gets Pacifix&#39;s, his new boss, message. &quot;Righto boss, \nI&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; have the message at his door in a sec.&quot; Crossroads downloads the \n&gt; &gt; message and heads on towards Crotale&#39;s last location. He inputs \n&gt; &gt; the message into the message machine, as soon as he finds out \n&gt; &gt; that Crotale&#39;s still missing. His engins roars to life, and he \n&gt; tears off, \n&gt; &gt; opening a commlink to Pacifix and relaying the news.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pacifix curses. &quot;Ok thanks Crossroads, make sure to be back at \n&gt; &gt; the spaceship in two days, after today, that&#39;s when we leave.&quot; He \n&gt; &gt; leaves his quarters, and transforms when he gets to the exit. He \n&gt; &gt; has a important meeting with the Autobot Council about what he \n&gt; &gt; might have to be prepared for.\n\n\n"}}
