Do to this, he was\n&gt; too slow to avoid Mobster&#39;s shots. He was blasted back, falling to the\n&gt; ground.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, sweet Matrix! This hurts like the pit.&quot; He strugled to his feet.\n&gt; &quot;But to stop me, you&#39;ll have to kill me!&quot; He ran behind Mobster, when he\n&gt; was distracted by War Machine. He fired to missiles, at the back of\n&gt; Mobster&#39;s left knee. He hoped he could sheer it off, causing Mobster to\n&gt; fall, and break.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::War Machine::\n&gt;\n&gt; War Machine is hit hard by the missile and charge. He falls to the\n&gt; ground, low on energy.\n&gt; &quot;I can only stay like this for 10 more minutes.
