No one \nwould get into without her permission. She had the computer controls \nset to her voice and Destructor&#39;s voice only as the ones to authorize \ncommands. She locked off the bridge to all except her and \nDestructor.  She closed off most of the personel quarters except to \nthat bot who&#39;s room it was and Destructor.  She then finally sat down \ni the lab and relaxed a bit in the chair.  &quot;OK,  now that all that is \ndone, anything else you think we need to do to prepare for them.  Oh \nyeah,  We need to give then two rooms.  We will need to make your \nguests feel comfortable.&quot; She smiled. Part of her wanted this to \nreally work and have the two groups unite and become an even bigger, \nstronger group.  But at the same time, she wasn&#39;t going to  just let \nthem walk in and do this,  if a trust was to develope, Aracnia would \nhave to prove herself.\n\n\n"}}
