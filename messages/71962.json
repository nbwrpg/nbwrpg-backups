WHEELIE leavin=\r\ng the room, the blow up on TUSCON&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\npart and then the rest leaving as w=\r\nell, anger the prevelent emotion in&lt;br&gt;\neveryone it seemed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith a=\r\nn inordinate amount of care LEO reached down and activated the&lt;br&gt;\ncomlink =\r\nbetween himself and TUSCON. &quot;Sir.&quot; he said with an extreme&lt;br&gt;\namount of ca=\r\nlm in his voice. &quot;I call you that because you are the&lt;br&gt;\ncommander of this=\r\n field position.&quot; It was obvious that LEO was making&lt;br&gt;\nan attempt to remi=\r\nnd TUSCON of what he was and his responsibilities.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME pause=\r\nd for a moment, taking the time to be sure his own calm&lt;br&gt;\nwas still in pl=\r\nace. &quot;A soldier under your command has gone off in an&lt;br&gt;\nattempt to recove=\r\nr Rodimus Prime on his own.&quot; Of course LEO was&lt;br&gt;\nrefering to WHEELIE.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You have told me that you revere Optimus Prime.&quot; LEO straighted but&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nstill talked into the comlink, &quot;Optimus Prime was betrayed by one that&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nhe called a brother and yet he still carried on.&quot; (Animated Optimus&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\nPrime betrayed by Sentinal Prime) &quot;And what of the original Optimus&lt;br&gt;\nP=\r\nrime? How many times times did he try to reason with those who were&lt;br&gt;\nhis=\r\n arch enemies?&quot; (G1 Optimus Prime reasoning with the Megatron)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Ha=\r\nve you written Wheelie off so soon and letting him go to what is&lt;br&gt;\nmost c=\r\nertainly his doom or will you attempt to reign him in?&quot; LEO&lt;br&gt;\npaused to a=\r\nsk his last questions, &quot;What would any of the Optimus&lt;br&gt;\nPrime&#39;s have done=\r\n?
