Although he had cleared a majority of them, there were still others \nto contend with.  But with fear of draining too much energy in vehicle mode, \nto power the missile cannons, he relies on hand to hand combat, and prepares \nto go against the sweeps by relying on his Ninjabot skills, rather than fire \npower, to preserve his energy.  He would now use his own body as a shield \nand weapon.\n\n&quot; I copy that Rodimus.  Now, let&#39;s see if the sweeps are brave enough to \nface me one on one.&quot;\n\nGracefully, he puts his body into combat position, taking all the stances of \na skilled Ninja warrior.  He concentrates on listening to what&#39;s around him.\n\n&quot;Talon, Lord Elder, they&#39;re close, watch your backs and your surroundings.&quot;\n\nFrom where Straight Shot and Kup are, Straight Shot too, hears the enemy \nclosing in, as she relays the data back to Kup.\n\n&quot;Woahh, they&#39;re onta us!  Talk about leading ants to a picknic!&quot;\n\nNight Shift now gets into combat position, and draws out a few plasma \nrevolvers.\n\n&quot;Scrap!  Things are definitely gonna get ugly out here.  And I hate ta say \nit but we&#39;re outnumbered and unless we get creative, we&#39;re history.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot replies while in Kup&#39;s grip.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s right Kup, I think I need to switch ammo to EMP charged arrowheads. \nThat might be able to help throw the remaining sweeps off their \nafterburners, and it&#39;s the only chance we got of actually evading disaster \nout here.&quot;\n\nShe takes a moment to callibrate her auto loading system to pick up the EMP \narrowheads.\n\n&quot;Okay, locked&#39;n loaded.  It&#39;s up to you now, Kup.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Rat Trap is quick to find a tiny hole to disappear into, as he \npoints to it while still with Windlord.\n\n&quot;Psst, follow me Windlord, over there, see?  That hole.  We can fit and they \ncan&#39;t.  When in doubt, hide it out.&quot;\n\nBack at the Ark, Quickstride is on top alert, as he sees the wave of energy \npass by.  He&#39;s quick to get into robot mode at the sight of it.\n\n&quot;Woahh hello!  What the scrap was that?!  Rodimus, we got activity out here, \nof an unknown origin!  I saw some energy waves, but nothing positive to \nidentify!  Whatever it is, it&#39;s invisible, and it&#39;s using some sort of \ncloaking device ta maneuver!  I&#39;m gonna attempt to get a fix on it.&quot;\n\nHe quickly dashes down to where he had seen the waves, and keeps alert with \nhis cannon aimed over his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Come out, come out wherever you are....  You can&#39;t hide behind an invisible \nbarrier for too long, without running out of energy....&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As Tuscon began projecting his powerful Sonar waves into the air, the \n&gt; affect\n&gt; on the sweeps is immediate and obvious as they begin flying in different\n&gt; directions, it is as if they are nearly blind!\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It is some sort of disruptor wave.&quot; One of the sweeps grunts, they are\n&gt; close enough for Tuscon to at least hear, even if he cannot see them via \n&gt; his\n&gt; sensors. The sweeps looked almost drunk as they tried to swing higher into\n&gt; the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seemed to be having an impact on the sweeps that Kup and Straightshot\n&gt; were dealing with as well. In an explosion of flames another falls from \n&gt; the\n&gt; skies, while trailing behind it a rather large plume of smoke.\n&gt;\n&gt; *****************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; The remaining three sweeps come together trying to stay out of range of\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s waves of disruption, but another is knocked from the skies by\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s missiles. The remaining two circle around, firing laser beams \n&gt; down\n&gt; at the Maximals!\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile at the tower as Windlord and Rat Trap watched the tower began to\n&gt; rumble, and a large door opened in its side, like some great jaw or \n&gt; perhaps\n&gt; some ancient draw bridge part of the base&#39;s wall itself began to separate\n&gt; from the rest and lower itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; From inside the base several figures could be seen flying out! Deepstryke \n&gt; in\n&gt; his cannon mode rose from the base, followed quickly by Phobia in jet mode\n&gt; and several more sweep. They began to move away from the base in the\n&gt; direction of Tuscon and Kup.\n&gt;\n&gt; The door to the base began to close.\n&gt;\n&gt; *****************************************\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile back at the Ark Rodimus received Tuscon&#39;s message. &quot;Gotcha.&quot; He\n&gt; said as he quickly began to fortify the Ark&#39;s shielding. &quot;Shield at 100%&quot; \n&gt; he\n&gt; said to Tuscon.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Quickstride!&quot; Rodimus said over the radio, &quot;Keep an optic out, from what\n&gt; Tuscon is telling me the battle is getting bad out there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile in the skies above Quickstride a small ripple appeared for a\n&gt; moment. Perhaps it was a bit of air displaced by heat, or perhaps it was\n&gt; something more.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
