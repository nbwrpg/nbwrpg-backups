She couldn&#39;t help but wonder what was \nwrong with her.  She wondered what she could do to end her problem. \nShe knew right them she had only two options left to her.  She could \nkill herself, which was out of the question.  She knew she would have \nto be reprogrammed. She looked at her body and saw the damaged.  She \ncried one last time and stepped out of the CR.  She saw Drillbit \nstanding there. She looked at him with all the pain in her eyes.  \nShe let the tears rolled down her cheeks as she looked at him.\n&quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;\nShe walked up to him and looked into his eyes.  &quot;I..I think I know \nhow to stop the pain.&quot; \n\nShe fell to her knees.  She whispered, &quot;I need you to reprogram me.&quot;\nShe looked at the floor and wept. \n\n\n"}}
