However it appeared that someone had\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; intentionally routed an energy conduit directly from her mouth right\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battery-like object next to her spark; allowing her to feas=\r\nt on\nother&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparks to keep her own intact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether this =\r\nhad been done as a temporary measure to keep her alive,\n&gt; &gt; or as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\neans to make her kill, and kill often; the Bushido Predecons\ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n sustain her needs for energy even if they emptied all the\nprisons in the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Valley Mine Pentatron. Celeron estimated that she would have had\nto ea=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately one spark every two days and that the battery could\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; sustain a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charge of at least 4 sparks, giving her a little over a =\r\nweek or\n&gt; &gt; about 200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles to roam before needing to kill again=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *From the data, he determined two things:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. He would =\r\nfirst need to generation some sort of substitute energon\n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n feed into her spark so she wouldn&#39;t need to eat other people&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; sparks =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he could keep her well-fed while he tried to come up with a\nsolut=\r\nion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. He would eventually need to figure out where this leak was an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; repair it;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then finally removing the conduits that allowed her =\r\nto eat\nsparks in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He had never done surge=\r\nry, but it didn&#39;t really bother him that he\n&gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; working on a=\r\n living being.
