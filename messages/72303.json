So please bare with me if there are any crazy symbols :)\n\n---------=\r\n-----\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; VICE GRIP listened over to the communication, pausing, &quot;=\r\nWhat do we know\n&gt; about this..  Leo Prime, I believe he identiifed himself =\r\nas?  What are his\n&gt; capabilities?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At the very least, they already had =\r\nmore to go on than they had previously -\n&gt; they knew the name of the Prime.=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKYSHADOW paused for a moment, his optics thoughtful. &quot;We know som=\r\nething of him.&quot; He said carefully. &quot;Not not as much as I would like. He is =\r\nthe spark &#39;child&#39; of Lio Convoy, who you may know LIO CONVOY as one of the =\r\nMaximals generals before the great peace accord set in?&quot; \n\nHe shook his hea=\r\nd slightly, &quot;No one knows who the mother is, some think This Leo . . . um. =\r\n. . Jr  for want of a better term,  is a clone of his &#39;father&#39;.&quot;\n\nSKYSHADOW=\r\n&#39;s optics brightened as another memory came to him. &quot;If he is he, then that=\r\n means that Wing Caliber and Santon are not far away either. There is a rum=\r\nor they they can become Magnaboss, although I have not actually seen that.&quot;=\r\n \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT nodded, &quot;Of course.  We should send an escort along =\r\nwith HYDRAS for\n&gt; the neogtiations.  But we should hold the majorit of our =\r\nforces back.&quot; \n&gt; Pausing.  &quot;And I would assume that the reason this second =\r\nPrime has taken\n&gt; over the negotiations, given he mentioned a very large ja=\r\nmming zone, is that\n&gt; TUSCON and perhaps part of the MAXIMAL forces are los=\r\nt within the area or\n&gt; otherwise engaged in missions there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing o=\r\nver, &quot;What group of us will be escorting HYDRAS, what will be\n&gt; remaining a=\r\nt base, and what will be going out on a salvage mission with\n&gt; Cryotek or w=\r\natching Tarantalus here?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSKYSHADOW turned to DINOBOT, &quot;I would not=\r\n want to encroach upon Hydras&#39; perrogative.&quot; He said in that same careful m=\r\nanner of his, sounding like the ever so loyal servant of HYDRAS. \n\n&quot;But thi=\r\ns is as big as this sounds.&quot; SKYSHGADOW said, talking about the conversatio=\r\nn HYDRAS and LEO were having, &quot;Then it is likely most of us will need to go=\r\n, with a skeleton crew left here, perhaps I and my fuzors.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BL=\r\nACKARACHNIA gave a small wink to CRYOTEK, &quot;Oh, please.  Assets are a\n&gt; muni=\r\ntions bunker, or an information network.  Now these..&quot;  Stroking her\n&gt; fore=\r\nclaw over her torso plating, &quot;Are another realm entirely.&quot;  Teasing.\n&gt;\n&gt; St=\r\nill paying close attention to the conversation and updating TARANTALUS.\n\n&lt;N=\r\nEW&gt;\n\nThere was a playful smile and a raised optic ridge, &quot;And tell me, whic=\r\nh assets are you more comfortable in sharing?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a shi=\r\nver along the cerebral link from BLACKARACHNIA, and a quiet\n&gt; nod, &quot;As you =\r\nwish.  Do you wish me to further interact with him or to\n&gt; prioritize mysel=\r\nf upon CRYOTEK for now?&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;BAH!&quot; TARANTULUS said over their encryp=\r\nted transmission. &quot;Hydras is so predictable.&quot; He words dimsive of Hydras&#39; a=\r\nbility. &quot;Since Megatron and Galvatron *ahem* shall we say, joined forces, w=\r\nhat has resulted has been lack luster to say the least.&quot;\n\nThere was a pause=\r\n, &quot;No.&quot; He said finally. &quot;Keep a watch on Cryotek. He has an agenda, and I =\r\nwant to know what it is. It may have something to do with what we are facin=\r\ng, or could be something different entirely.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
