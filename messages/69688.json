AM I GLAD TA HEAR YOUR VOICE BECAUSE I C=\r\nAN REALLY USE SOME BACK UP HERE!  I ENDED UP IN THE PREDACON BASE, AND GUES=\r\nS WHAT?! I MET AN AUTOBOT WHO&#39;S RELATED TA OPTIMUS PRIME!  HE&#39;S IN MORE TRO=\r\nUBLE THAN I AM, AND HE&#39;S SENDN&#39; ME OUT FOR HELP, QUESTION IS, GETTN&#39; OUTA T=\r\nHIS SNAKE PIT OF A BASE WITHOUT GETTN&#39; MY AFT BLOWN OFF!&quot;\n\nHe starts to sen=\r\nd Lord Elder the data relating to his position and location.\n\n&quot;Sorry, I had=\r\n ta yell because of the sound of the energy blasts.  Okay, here&#39;s the skinn=\r\ny sir, we got three trapped Autobots. Night Light who&#39;s unconcious, my new =\r\npal, Tucson, who came here tryn&#39; ta save Rodimus&#39;s life, even though that l=\r\nousey heap of scrap doesn&#39;t deserve it for the treachery he&#39;s committed lat=\r\nely and yeah I am reffern&#39; ta Rodimus Prime.  ACK!  Lousey no good GLITCH! =\r\n Look, I&#39;ll tell ya more when I can get outa here, that&#39;s if I get outa her=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nHis transmission breaks after his last word.\n\nAt the torture chamber, =\r\nTucson&#39;s only reaction to Scorpinok is a cold one.  He was NOT about to div=\r\nulge anything to anyone, no matter the pain of the torture!\n\n&quot; Truthfully, =\r\nyou can intimidate me all you want, but I will Not betray the Autobots and =\r\nthe good name of Optimus Prime. So if you&#39;re looking for me to tell you eve=\r\nrything, forget it, you will not get that out of me no matter if you disman=\r\ntle me piece by piece while I&#39;m still alive.&quot;  \n\nHe turns his head away fro=\r\nm Scorponok.\n\nBy the Ark..\n\nOOC: Enter Quickstride.\n\nBIC:  Quickstride may =\r\nnot have been the brightest Maximal on the force, but he knew when a rescue=\r\n had to be made.  He hears Rat Trap&#39;s transmission with ears forward in equ=\r\nine form, and hangs his head over Lord Elder&#39;s shoulder, while chewing on s=\r\nome vegitation that he had found in the area, as all horses do while grazin=\r\ng.  He swallows a mouth full of chewed up greens and thoughtfully looks to =\r\nLord Elder.\n\n&quot; I know distress when I hear it. And Rat Trap definitely soun=\r\nded like he needs help.  Lord Elder, with your permission I&#39;d like to volun=\r\nteer my services.&quot;\n\nReplies the Stallion thoughtfully, looking to Lord Elde=\r\nr with big blue eyes, which was rare among horses.  Breezes catch his long =\r\ncopper mane and tail as he swatts away insects with it.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Enter L=\r\nord Elder!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the center of the Ark&#39;s main command center Lord Elder, =\r\nthe leader\n&gt; of the Watchers and at the moment, the lone guardian of the Ar=\r\nk stood\n&gt; watching different computer screens, indulging one his favorite p=\r\nast\n&gt; times, examining the cosmos. From as far back as he could remember he=\r\n\n&gt; had always had a fascination with anything new, the stars, new\n&gt; planets=\r\n, new places, he was a machine designed to explore.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the screens wer=\r\ne different views of space, a few of them were\n&gt; centered on the moon, as h=\r\ne silently wondered exactly what was going\n&gt; on there, what were the minion=\r\ns planning? Unfortunately he had no\n&gt; ability to peer into their very base,=\r\n although he could at times make\n&gt; out the dim reddish reflections from the=\r\n moon, the base of Unicron&#39;s\n&gt; minions.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a sigh he looked at anoth=\r\ner monitor, this one trained in a\n&gt; different direction. He couldn&#39;t necess=\r\narily see the Predacon base\n&gt; from his position, but he knew where it was a=\r\nnd he always kept a\n&gt; sensor beam in their direction. Even with the ongoing=\r\n skirmishes from\n&gt; the minions, you can never put it past the Predacons to =\r\nmake an attack\n&gt; as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; He pursed his lips slightly as he looked at =\r\nthe screen. He had seen\n&gt; Rat Trap going off in that direction. He hadn&#39;t s=\r\naid anything to the\n&gt; Maximal, as Rat Trap was usually more than able to ta=\r\nke care of\n&gt; himself, but it had been a while since he had checked in.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n With a casual movement Lord Elder reached down to the console in front\n&gt; o=\r\nf him and opened an encrypted maximal channel, &quot;Rat Trap! This is\n&gt; Lord El=\r\nder, come it. What is your Status?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Tag)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Lord Elder)\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
