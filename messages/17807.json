You go and get some rest. I&#39;ll keep an \neye out here for you.&quot; she said in a cheerful tone.  She had a warm, \ngenuine smile on her face.  She was just a naturally nice bot in \ngeneral. She watched the scanners and jotted down the info that the \nscanner put out. \n\nShadow Wing::\nShe didn&#39;t respond.  She stayed inside her chamber and didn&#39;t try to \nmake the connection to communicate wtih Veratis.  She cold barely \nhear him, like he was whispering at her. But she couldn&#39;t make it out.\nShe was still a little hsaken from the power surge and didn&#39;t want to \ngo through it again any time soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk set up the lab equipment the best she could. Squizzy \n&gt; watching her didn&#39;t make her job any easier. Once set up she placed \n&gt; the somple of DNA from the bug she&#39;d found into a scanner. The bug \nin \n&gt; question was a scarab. She scanned the DNA into the computer. She \n&gt; added the DNA she&#39;d obtained when she&#39;d picked up Rat Trap. the \n&gt; computer scanned for similarities in the strutures. It would take \nat \n&gt; least an hour for the comparison to be completed.&quot;Watch this for me \n&gt; would you please, I&#39;m gonna get a little rest before my \npresentation \n&gt; to Zardus.&quot; She stepped into the corner and curled up. It wasn&#39;t \nthe \n&gt; luxuries that she fealt she deserved but many places that Veratis \nhad \n&gt; them stop lacked suitable surroundings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis studied the scans from the Protoform which housed the spark \n&gt; of Shadow Wing. he thought it was time she was educated. The old \n&gt; science bot attached the receptors again and went into the \nprotoforms \n&gt; mind. &quot;Hello Shadow Wing, how&#39;s my favorite patient today?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
