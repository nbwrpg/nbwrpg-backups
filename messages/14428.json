I was an Autobot. I was at Autobot City\n&gt; when Optimus Prime died. I ended up useing the Matrix, to destroy\n&gt; Unicron. I lead the Autobots for two years as Rodimus Prime. I was one\n&gt; of the first Target Masters. After the great upgrade, I was rebuilt as a\n&gt; Maxi, and explored space. When I came back to Cybertron, I learned of\n&gt; the Neo Beast Wars, and came here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
