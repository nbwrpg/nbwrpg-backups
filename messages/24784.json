Death turned to him. &quot;Why \nare you convinced he wants us?&quot; \n  Apocalypse stared... &quot;He needs us to reach his ultimate form. I stopped him \nonce before.  He was dead. But I guess that weakling Valtron couldnt hold him \nat bay any longer. I should have taken him out when I had the chance.&quot;\n   Death looked at Apocalypse. &quot;We are more then a match for him.&quot; \n Apocalypse stared. He had no words to speak. Galvatron was to calm. He was \nfaceing two of the best in the pred armed forces yet... he isnt scared. He \npulled his flame sword. Cried his words.. &quot;LOng Live the Predacon Empire!&quot; He \nran at the beast with remarkable speed. Death followed from the right. Pulled \nout his reaper and headed towards the calm bot. The battle was on.\n\n"}}
