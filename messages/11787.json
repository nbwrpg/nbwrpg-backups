He hoped that they would accept his offer.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\tDecadel picked up a transmission from another bot just as he was about to\nwalk into the base.  He looked back and saw Hakibuscon.  He walked over to\nHakibuscon.\n\n\t&quot;Listen you, this better not be a trick!  I will take you to the leader,\nand she can listen to your deal!&quot; He said as he grabbed Hakibuscon, and\nwalked into the base with his gun pointed at Hakibuscon&#39;s head.  He brought\nHakibuscon to where Blackarachnia was.\n\n\t&quot;Your honor, I have brought this bot to you, he wants to make a deal with\nus,&quot; Decadel said and shoved Hakibuscon towards Blackarachnia, then walked\noff and tried to find Paralysis, so he could get assigned some quarters.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\tHakibuscon looked at Blackarachnia.  He had seen her before, when he was\nspying on a Predacon base.  Yes, these guys were Predacons alright.  He\nstared at Blackarachnia, and tried to keep his fear hidden.\n\n\t&quot;My name is Hakibuscon.  I have traveled far, and I need you to help me,\nby sheltering me here.  Also, if you don&#39;t mind, could I have some\nweaponry?  I lost all of my other weapons in a little accident.  If you do\nthis, I will help you fight against those idiotic Maximals you are trying\nto destroy,&quot; He said, although doubted they&#39;d let him stay, as Predacons\nwere cold-hearted.\n\n\n"}}
