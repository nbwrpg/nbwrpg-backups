He&#39;s supposed to be e-mailing in me in a bit. He&#39;s \nalready e-mailed me back the question and he has to check if it&#39;s \nalright with Mainframe or something. He&#39;s gonna e-mail me in a bit \nand than I&#39;ll transfer him to Yanshosh and they can make plans. Is \nthat alright Yanshosh? Oh, and another ting. Were doing a lot of \nfirsts here, so I would like to do one myself. It&#39;s pretty \ncontroversial, so I want to ask permission first. It wouldn&#39;t last \nlong, as soon as their drunkeness is over, but would it be okay to \nhave a homosexual relationship? Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with \nhaving one here or anything. They&#39;re people too I mean and they \nshould get proper respect. It&#39;s just that this says PG-13 and I \nwondered if this is in the limits. If anyone feels uncomfortable \nabout it than I won&#39;t do it.\n\nTrainers\n\n&quot;Alrigh than,&quot; said Prebon, kissing Spears one more time,&quot; Remember, \nbe brave.

When they got there they could see a group of \nMaxis talking. Time to make demands.\n\n&quot;Hey, which one of you is Ramulus? I am Prebon, leader of the \nTrainers. I have one simple demand! Meet me alone, one on one, and \nbring a map of all bases on this planet. I will than release both of \nmy prisoners! I have already removed the chip from your bot Spears \nhere. Look at her scream. Agree to my demands or they will die and \nyou will have an eternal enemy of Savage and The Trainers!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n"}}
