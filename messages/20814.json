He looked up and \ndown her new form. It was bigger than he was and it looked twice as \npowerful. Lunarpine tried to hide his thoughts but knew she could \nread how impressed he was.\n\nVeratis stepped forward with a microscanner designed to break down \nevery cell in her body. Her cells showed traces of the virus but they \nwere quickly being treated like more of a flu than a fatal \nvirus. &quot;You&#39;ll be fine in a day or so.&quot; He set the scanner back on \nhis workbench, turned in an almost poetic motion. Glad you&#39;re back my \ndear.&quot; His words were gentle and secureing but his thoughts were not. \nHis thoughts were angry with her He wanted to know how she could \nstorm off like that knowing she&#39;d been infected with the virus. How \ndare she risk putting him through that kind of grief again.\n\n\nOOC Well I gotta get some sleep, I hope I gave the ones who bother to \nread this something to think about.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; The virus had finally stopped working and her immune system started \n&gt; to adjust. Her body finally finished it&#39;s mutation and her open \n&gt; wounds healed. She slowly awoke in the chamber. Her form was as it \n&gt; was, polar bear with the the ability to chanbe the head into a bot \n&gt; head. She looked around inside the chamber.  The virus in her was \nnow \n&gt; nullified and no longer existant and her body was now immune to the \n&gt; virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; She opened the door to the chamber and lumbered out. Still a little \n&gt; drowsy from the seditive, but awake. She stood up on her hind legs \n&gt; and changed into semi bot form. She looked at Lunarpine and Veratis.\n&gt; Her robotic eyes looking back and forth between the two bots.\n&gt; She was still nervouse about being caged up. She wasn&#39;t sure if the \n&gt; virus inside her was still active.\n\n\n"}}
