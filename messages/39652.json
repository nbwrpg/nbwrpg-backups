In the RPG rules charter it \n&gt; blatantly states that there will be no offensive drones(group \n&gt; Charachters) except for those used for Construction and repairs. the \n&gt; Two drones used in Kyles post violate that rule, thus another reason \n&gt; why I believe we should have a temp council for the RPG. One that \n&gt; would exist until one(Im not sure if Megan is alive. heh)or two come \n&gt; back. Of course once one member is back they&#39;ll have all say so it \n&gt; would be up to them if the temp council stayed and helped until all \n&gt; four members have returned. But thats just my two cents.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at http://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
