He lured Autobots \nto space, where he wanted to take them down and conquer his enemy \nonce and for all. It was somewhat an unfair battle for the Autobots \nhad little space ships to use.\n\nThe blue corvette named Tracks agreed to go to the mission as back-up \nsupport for his other wingmates Skyfire and Powerglide were already \nbusy with the Decepticon jets. He wanted to go by himself, but \nOptimus persuaded him to use one of the few ships.\n\nThat happened what seemed a billion mega-cycles ago, and now here he \nwas, trapped in the middle of a seemingly endless battle, hoping for \nhis fragile battle ship not to be shoot down any time soon. But \nSkywarp was pursuing him like a cat to a mouse.\nSkywarp&#39;s null-ray beams struck Tracks&#39; ship right in the center of \nits energy core, sending Tracks flying aimlessly into space. The \nship&#39;s core sparkled and an explosion ocurred, Tracks braced himself \nfor his death. However, he founf himself in what seemed like a \nvortex, the pressure and speed increassing at any second until his \nCPU shut him down to protect him.\n\n=\n\nTracks&#39; ship crashed on the earth, buring half of it under mud and \nrocks. The blue corvette came online after some minutes. &quot;What \nhappened?&quot; He rubbed the back of his head and raised his optics to \nwatch past the shattered crystal. &quot;Great, now this ship is slag... \njust like myself&quot; he thought as he tried to get out from it. Only to \nfind out he hadn&#39;t crashed in the moon and that he no longer was in \nwhat he used to call &#39;Earth&#39;. It was all a jungle, a primitive jungle \nno the less.\n&quot;Great!&quot; He whinned. &quot;Where the slag I am...?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
