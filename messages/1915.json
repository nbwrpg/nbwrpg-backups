He gasped, and screamed. His mind was fulled with the memories of\n&gt; Megatron becoming the dragon, the incident that could have killed him. He\n&gt; remembered his trial.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;AUTO-GUNS, FIRE!&quot; he screamed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The auto-guns turned and fired at the dragon.\n&gt;\n&gt; This was no good. Why couldn&#39;t things go right? He was hungry, hurt,\n&gt; and---actually scared. He needed to continue fixing the comuter to the\n&gt; Darkside&#39;s programing. Hell Beast had messed with it&#39;s programing when he\n&gt; was chased out.\n&gt;\n&gt; With his spark still pulsing hard with his memories, he said to the\n&gt; computer, &quot;Computer, bring back programin&#39; bah unit Quickstrike. Bring\nback\n&gt; commands an&#39; reformating of th&#39; Darkside.&quot; He thought to himself, you are\n&gt; the Darkside now.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4057/10/_/_/_/958841937/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
