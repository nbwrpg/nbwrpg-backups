Other times the head would still be\n&gt; functioning (in one case\n&gt; waspinators body got trash compacted and another\n&gt; TOTALLY dis-assembled) and\n&gt; be able to direct parts of the body to do whatever\n&gt; (ie waspinators head\n&gt; crawling around by being attached to the wrist of a\n&gt; hand)\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically even without a head Inferno/warhead aren&#39;t\n&gt; going to die, dunno\n&gt; where you guys got this silly notion stasis lock =\n&gt; death for bots. Remember\n&gt; on the show Black arachnia went into extreme stasis\n&gt; lock and shut\n&gt; down....they tossed her in the CR chamber and she\n&gt; woke up (it was the big\n&gt; romeo/juliet speech episode done by silverbolt).\n&gt; However again the degree of\n&gt; damage a bot can take before they die varied.\n&gt; WAspinator could be utterly\n&gt; torn apart yet drag himself around to a CR\n&gt; chamber...dinobot gets beat on\n&gt; for a day and literally dies.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
