I checked my spam folder too, nothing was there.  Any=\r\nway, what we got going on is pretty good so far.  It&#39;ll take a little time =\r\nbut it&#39;ll play out good.\n\nBIC: Collective post.\n\nTucson Prime knew he had h=\r\nis work cut out for him.  It wouldn&#39;t be easy attempting to turn Rodimus ar=\r\nound.  He simply sighs, and does not give anyone the satisfaction of losing=\r\n his temper.  The less he expressed his disdain, the more he hoped to cause=\r\n a bit of frustration among his captives.  He had an old saying.  &quot;Don&#39;t ge=\r\nt mad, use your strongest of attributes and talents to passively retaliate =\r\nagainst your enemies.   \n\n&quot;Ohh well, I may be in trouble for a while, and i=\r\nt wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&quot;\n\nHe shrugs Rodimus off casually.\n\nOutside th=\r\ne fortress, Rat Trap gets Lord Elder&#39;s message, and replies.\n\n&quot; Lord Elder,=\r\n sorry for not gettn&#39; back ta ya so soon.  We had a little glitch in our ba=\r\nttle plans...  Tucson Prime told us ta stay outside the fortress, and we di=\r\nd, and when he went inside with Kup ta try&#39;n get Nightshift out, he got cap=\r\ntured, again.  But this time I think he wanted ta get captured..  Some sort=\r\na new strategy he&#39;s tryn&#39; out.  As for us... I - dunno but Quickstride&#39;s go=\r\nt that look in his eyes.. He&#39;s itchn&#39; for a fight. Normally I would just st=\r\nay out of it, but, ya know somethn&#39;, I&#39;m itchn&#39; for some payback too.  Whee=\r\nls is in there and he&#39;s givn&#39; it his all!  The least we can do is return th=\r\ne favor and do our part out here.  We&#39;ll keep the com link open sir, so tha=\r\nt way ya know we&#39;re still with ya.... Nowwwww, let&#39;s see, I&#39;m on your back =\r\nQuickstride and when you get your hooves movn&#39; you get &#39;em movn&#39;...  All we=\r\n need is a long piece of metal and we got ourselves a lance...  Get my drif=\r\nt?&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds.\n\n&quot; My charge, your lance....  Ohhh yeahh I do.  The=\r\n old Jousting game. But remember, as Maximals, we don&#39;t make any moves unle=\r\nss we&#39;re attacked first.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.  He spots something.  A long pip=\r\ne like object that appears to be a broken off piece of pipe from some form =\r\nof fallen aircraft.  It proves to not have rusted and in good condition.  H=\r\ne scans the ground and finds what looks like a pointed missile head, perhap=\r\ns from a missile that had not fired.  He puts the two of them together and =\r\nwith a small welding tool, he fashions a make shift lance.\n\n&quot;What&#39;dya think=\r\n?&quot;\n\nQuickstride grins.\n\n&quot; That&#39;ll do.&quot;\n\nRat Trap grins also.\n\n&quot; Rat Trap Ma=\r\nximize.&quot;\n\nHe gets into his robot mode, and gets up onto Quickstride&#39;s back,=\r\n holding the lance in his left hand while holding onto Quickstride&#39;s mane w=\r\nith the other.  He then realizes that one more thing is missing.  A shield.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Forgot the shield.&quot;\n\nQuickstride sniffs at a broken off door of a vehicl=\r\ne.\n\n&quot;Found one.&quot;\n\nRat Trap is given the car door.  He now tries to hold on =\r\nwith his legs, rather than hands.\n\n&quot;Woahh, I dunno how this is gonna work b=\r\nig guy..  Guess we&#39;ll find out eventually.&quot;  \n\nQuickstride faces the fortre=\r\nss, and stands his ground.  The wind blows breezes through his mane as he l=\r\nooks onward, ears forward.\n\n&quot;Remember Rat Trap, we don&#39;t make any moves unl=\r\ness they come after us first.&quot;\n\nBack in the fortress in a different cell, N=\r\night Shift keeps an ear out on what goes on behind the door.  He calmly rem=\r\nembers all of his ninjabot training, and a few hand excercises he had been =\r\ntaught to make his wrists more limber and fluid.  He had hoped that these w=\r\nould accidentally, on purpose slip one of his hands if not both out of his =\r\nrestraints and be able to slip them back in at a moment&#39;s notice, then back=\r\n out without anyone ever catching onto him.  Without a word, he keeps his e=\r\nyes open, not one ounce of body language, and attempts his excercises he ha=\r\nd learned from his mentor, Prowl.  He thinks to himself while attempting it=\r\n.\n\n&quot; Okay Prowl, I ain&#39;t done this one in a while, let&#39;s see if I remember =\r\nthat little excercise ya taught me...&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;a=\r\nirly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hdyras sent a private messa=\r\nge to Rodimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to speak with you when your shift ends.
