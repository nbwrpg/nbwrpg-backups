He looks at Dark, aiming his \nEMP rifle. Killfest fires three shots from the rifle, followed by two \nsignature-seeking missiles at Dark.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHis scanners detecting firepower, EndBringer spins around, placing Koj \nin the way of Liono&#39;s blast.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCloaked from view and scanners, Scyther flies into the battle. Knowing \nthat firing would give away his position (as well as his presence), he \ntakes out his scythe, flying silently toward Dark&#39;s back.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIncarcinator smiles, looking at the battle. Its been a long time.\n\n&quot;Its nice to be back, Commander,&quot; he says to Killfest over the \nterrorists&#39; internal communication system. Its been a while since he&#39;d \nfought alongside Killfest.\n\nIncarcinator aims his rifle at Inu, firing three very-high-speed, \nexplosive shells. The kickback sends him flying back a bit, but his \njetpack equals it out and keeps him mostly stational.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTired of waiting for a reply, Grimmler taps in a few commands on the \nconsole of the shuttle he and Demise were in. The shuttle launches \noff, heading toward the battle in space.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;RYO D&quot; &lt;striderzero1@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ((Thanks for covering for me Yan.
