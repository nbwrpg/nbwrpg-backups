As he look down towards the new person \nabout \n&gt; to fight him and Daydream he smiled and thought. If I could take \nboth \n&gt; of them out I wonder.... his thoughts went on in this form. He \n&gt; shouted out loud &quot;Ahahahha fools, ahahaha&quot; he laughed with \n&gt; vengence. &quot;Now it is time to meet your makers. As he said this his \n&gt; wings faned back suddenly. The sun bright in the distance was \ncovered \n&gt; up with his wide outspread. below them a huge shadow fell where his \n&gt; opponents were standing. Auron holds out his hands to both sides of \n&gt; his body. He begins to quiver as little slits in his wings begin to \n&gt; open up. As you look up Aurons eyes begin glowering red and his body \n&gt; seems to shimmer in the morning daylight. &quot;Yes are you ready now&quot; as \n&gt; he says this his sensors lock on his foes below. As his arms come \n&gt; together, he smiles a crazy demented smile. &quot;Lock&quot; he says as his \n&gt; hordes of missles come out of his wings are in fiering postion. As \n&gt; they come out it seems he has volleys and volleys of them \n&gt; stored. &quot;Are you ready now&quot; he asked once more as the first volley \n&gt; came down, 20 missles locked on Daydreamer and his new opponent went \n&gt; streaming toward them.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC:This is like a move I just made up but when I use it my amo \nkinda \n&gt; runs out quickly\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ooc:yes i posted her going there.\n&gt; &gt; Night Prowler:very well daydreamer ill help you.\n\n\n"}}
