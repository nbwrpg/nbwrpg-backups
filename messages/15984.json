There was Savanna, but she \nwas\n&gt; killed before they could even date. And here he was kissing a bot he\n&gt; knew for only a few hours. But he liked it.\n&gt; He was in love with her. He kissed her again, and again. He \nwispered, in\n&gt; her ear, \n&gt; &quot;Want to go to my room...?&quot; He stoped, knowing she got the point.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Good god!
