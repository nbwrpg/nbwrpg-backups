Plintissa wasn&#39;t moving. Dracona smiled and wa=\r\nlked back toward her base. A dagger flew into Dracona&#39;s back. She spun arou=\r\nnd and grabbed the dagger in pain. Plintissa stood there.\n\n            &quot;You=\r\n do not know when to give up, you fool, but never mind that your an idiot, =\r\nI&#39;m going to grind you so small you won&#39;t be able to be seen with a microsc=\r\nope!&quot; Dracona said. She kept her hand covered and flung the dagger back. It=\r\n missed Plintissa and hit Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in satisfaction=\r\n. Plintissa tackled Dacona and took her down. Dracona once again turned to =\r\nher saw blade to saw into Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintis=\r\nsa dodged. Dracona started to burn everything with fire beams. Plintissa st=\r\nill avoids it. Plintissa was always a good fighter, but it wasn&#39;t until now=\r\n, after her bad life that she discovered her true fighting power. Plintissa=\r\n beat Dracona mercilessly. Draocona&#39;s parts were flung everywhere as Plinti=\r\nssa spun a simple stick through the air. Dracona raised the saw blade and s=\r\nliced the stick to pieces. Dracona laughed and sliced Plintissa several hun=\r\ndred times. Plintissa fell.\n\n            &quot;Th weak move aside and die so the=\r\n strong can survive. As ancient as the Cosmos, that has always been the way=\r\n of things. I&#39;m sorry Plintissa, you were a good friend, but don&#39;t take thi=\r\ns personally, it&#39;s just business.&quot; Dracona said.\n             \n            =\r\nDracona pulled back the saw blade and thrust it towards Plintissa. Plintiss=\r\na grabbed her arm from earlier and threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracon=\r\na slammed it into Plintissa, but as she did, the blade came loose before it=\r\n hit Plintissa. The blade flew up. Dracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot=\r\n had scarred when she first arived on the planet. The blade sawed through D=\r\nracona and left her in pieces everywhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last =\r\nwords were:\n\n            &quot;*Cough, Cough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do n=\r\not forget your promise.&quot; And Dracona died smiling. Plintissa remembered tha=\r\nt she promised Dracona that she would never leave her sitting. Plintissa cr=\r\nied. Her mech fluid ran everywhere and she got weaker and weaker. Artist st=\r\nepped slowly over to Plintissa. He was crying, too.\n\n            &quot;Artist, I=\r\n&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; Plintissa whispered.\n\n            &quot;Why ar=\r\ne you leaving me, Plintissa? Why does everyone betray me?&quot; Artist asked.\n\n =\r\n           &quot;Artist, there floats Dracona&#39;s spark, recover it, we can&#39;t part=\r\n, she really was my friend.&quot; Artist walked up and captured the extinguished=\r\n spark as it tried to fly away. He contained it in a capsule.\n\n            =\r\n&quot;Plintissa, if you leave me, I&#39;ll...have no more reason to live, all my fri=\r\nends are gone, my helping days are over.&quot; Artist said.\n\n            &quot;Your h=\r\nelping days are never over, and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n=\r\n\n            &quot;This isn&#39;t some lame thing about how you&#39;ll always be in my h=\r\neart, is it?&quot;\n\n            &quot;No, Artist, come here.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Ar=\r\ntist looked at Team Ultima&#39;s base. It was destroyed, the funny thing was, t=\r\nhat it was destroyed by Dracona, the very one, along with Plintissa, that o=\r\nriginally built it. And there it was, sticking above ground now and burning=\r\n away. Sinesis looks at the base and sighs.\n\n            &quot;Twister, Dracona =\r\nis dead, I guess we have to leave.&quot; Sinesis says. Sinister stands next to B=\r\nlizzard and sighs.\n\n            &quot;Blizzard, we need to find another home, no=\r\nw.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n            Artist came closer to Plintissa. Her =\r\nspark suddenly burst from her and floated into Artist&#39;s hands. She said to =\r\nhim what he needed to do. He opened his chest compartment and his spark was=\r\n revealed. Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his own, they became one.=\r\n\n\n            &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered really low. Plintissa to=\r\nld him she still loved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plintissa was with him no=\r\nw, and now they could never be seperated again. Artist, completely ignoring=\r\n Blizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran out into a field.\n\n   =\r\n         &quot;Artist, now we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s spark.&quot; Plintissa s=\r\naid. (Remember, only Artist can hear Plintissa now) Artist headed toward th=\r\ne Maximal base, there Dracona would get a new body, one she could not attac=\r\nk anyone ever again in, and where she can always be helpful. Artist held up=\r\n the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still inside.\n\n            &quot;I love you.&quot; Ar=\r\ntist said seemingly to nobody.\n\n            &quot;I love you too.&quot; Plintissa sai=\r\nd to Artist. Artist continued walking to the Maximal base...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_012D_01BFFF03.46593760\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Sinister listens car=\r\nefully to the words of \nBlizzard.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&quot;Who needs a home, Twister!?
