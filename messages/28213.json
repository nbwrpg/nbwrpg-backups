Starwind changed to his space \nship mode and let Steed and Rattrap get on top of him. he lfew up \nbehind Unicron. Depth Charge flew up on the left side of him. Blade \nRunner flew on the right side. all of them were prepared to attack at \nany second they saw it fit to. Starwind turned the tracking system on \nUnicron so he could fire missles. Then Angel Prime yelled out loud \nenough so everyone could here.\n\n\n\nAngel Prime:\n\n\n\n&quot;leave Unicron alone we will deal with him. [then he turned to \nUnicron.] well there is only one way out and that is through us. Bring \nit.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nAngel Prime&#39;s fire started to go around him. [like powering up.]\n\n\n"}}
