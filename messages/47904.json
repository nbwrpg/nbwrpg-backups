As is repairs are under way, sensor range is \nlimited \n&gt; for the moment and communications outside the ship are being looked \n&gt; into.&quot;     Grinning he nodded, &quot;We&#39;ve got a foothold here to \ncomplete \n&gt; our mission, as for now I&#39;d like to see about getting the mess hall \n&gt; cleaned up and getting some of our people resting. We don&#39;t know \nthe \n&gt; terrain, we don&#39;t know how many preds there are or if they&#39;re \nheaded \n&gt; our way. I want every bot in good shape for when we find them or \nthey \n&gt; find us. Megatron is going back to cybertron, this time for \n&gt; good.&quot;     Nodding again saying his piece he walked out of the CR \n&gt; chamber room and headed for the mess hall to assess the damage, \nfrom \n&gt; the look of Kup it must&#39;ve been pretty shook up. \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
