The kiss on her cheek reminded her of the same kisses that they had shared in her quarters only a mega-cycle and a half ago, wishing that she could rewind time and try to prevent his damage. Half closing her optics in a way that meant that ,�knowing� way when he replied to her statement of  not being able to handle her cure for pain. But she then saw Prowl nearly lose his balance and was ready to stop him from falling if needed, he was so hurt and that fact hurt her just as much then�causing her casual look to become concern.\nHim then stumbling back as Shadow Cat came up to them causing her to come closer to him in worry, how could a few broken ribs cause him to act like this?\nSoon the pains of her own damage was over ruled by concern as Prowl takes a step towards a CR chamber but doesn�t quite make it! Seeing him almost cry out in pain Iron Raptor rushed to his side just in time to hear the hiss and pop of his damage, then seeing him slump to the floor and his repair system begin to activate.\nWith a quick rush of movement she bent down to him and then took him under the arms, with the full weight of his damaged body being to heavy she simply pulled him over to a wall beside a  chamber and then sat him up against it.\nIron Raptor put a worried hand on Prowl�s cheek as she looked into his face and kneeled beside him, expressionless and without emotion as he stayed in his nearly unconscious state. \nShe brushed her thumb over his lips before leaning in close and placing her own cheek against his other one, the act simply for comfort to let him know that she was there with him in his time of need. His repair system obviously working but the pain might not be fully gone yet, her own presence there for him to deal with that.\nHer free hand stoked his shoulder for a moment before resting on his arm, her voice soft and smooth as not to cause him alarm or suddenly surprise him�not knowing if he even knew that she was there now�beside him. *\n\n� I�m here, Prowl�My Love. As I�ll always be.�\n\n* Then with a slightly worried sigh but one of slight relaxation she stayed by his side, waiting for a positive response from the only bot she ever loved. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
