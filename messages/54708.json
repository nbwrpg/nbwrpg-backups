He was heading to Earth \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visit some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he got there, \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided he would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He found one in the ships \n&gt; &gt; &gt; databanks. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; truck, every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into \nhimself. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got up from his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons, and went \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare. As he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people on this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             He touched his chest, the change to actual bot \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hurt his combined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             In the deep Prime voice that had once declared \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron that &quot;one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus would dare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; betray me like that?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t even sit down as he entered the atmosphere, the \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shook. He was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had planted on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             The ship&#39;s thrusters exploded, but the rest of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ship didn&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, it careened out of control and slammed into the \n&gt; &gt; ground, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; throwing Prime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship \n&gt; stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked himself \n&gt; over. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was in full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked back \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to look. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform \n&gt; &gt; underneath, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and \n&gt; dented, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the \nshoulder \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sort of \n&gt; &gt; robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sent back from the future, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could live with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Luckily for him, the communications boxes on \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other bots. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First though was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he started, with disgust, &quot;and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one known as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra. I have a message for you. Magnus is dead. He was \n&gt; killed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to stop \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me. But he was unsuccessful. I am requesting a meeting with \n&gt; &gt; both \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of you, at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates.

I understand that &lt;BR&gt;these &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; cubes are dangerous and cause &quot;big booms.&quot; I can see why your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; parents &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told you to keep them safe. Please try to understand this is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; special time. The sickness is here and those cubes could help all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us. We&#39;ll take special care not to cause any &quot;big booms&quot; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; promise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight heard the message and said anxiously &quot;Will you go &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ROdimus?&quot; she huged him tightly and said while hey eyes where &lt;BR&gt;&gt; full &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with tears &quot;Don&#39;t go, my love, it could be a tramp!!!

His wings spread and fiore exploded from &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; veins. &quot;He is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold, I can feel his dark energy, ah yesss Prime I&#39;ll meet &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he opened his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comm, &quot;I&#39;ll be there Prime, I&#39;ll be there.&quot; He looked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; around. &quot;You &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; all stay &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, I shall be back.&quot; He opened the hatch. He knew hed be &lt;BR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; danger of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rust plague but he didnt care this was much for imporant. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; transformed into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his two headed dragon beast mode and flew to the coordinates.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I&#39;ll put a profile up as soon as I have a name and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; password...hint...hint hint)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Optimus Prime:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his protoform body, Optimus Prime glided &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; stolen ship easily &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the void of temporal space. He was heading to Earth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; visit some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he got there, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decided he would &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He found one in the ships &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; databanks. A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; truck, every &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into &lt;BR&gt;himself. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; got up from his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons, and went &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare. As he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people on this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet. He was ready.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He touched his chest, the change to actual bot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hurt his combined &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deep Prime voice that had once declared &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron that &quot;one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall stand; one shall fall&quot; he boomed, &quot;Magnus would dare &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; betray me like that?&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He didn&#39;t even sit down as he entered the atmosphere, the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ship &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shook. He was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had planted on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ship. &quot;Oh, crap.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship&#39;s thrusters exploded, but the rest of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ship didn&#39;t. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, it careened out of control and slammed into the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ground, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; throwing Prime &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stopped.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he stopped and got up he checked himself &lt;BR&gt;&gt; over. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He was in full &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked back &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the ship to look. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; visor over his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; underneath, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the red eye &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dented, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;windshield&quot; chest was broken, so one could see the &lt;BR&gt;shoulder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sort of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; robot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sent back from the future, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; could live with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily for him, the communications boxes on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; these &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pods were nearly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other bots. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First though was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus and Hydra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Rodimus Prime,&quot; he started, with disgust, &quot;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one known as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydra. I have a message for you. Magnus is dead. He was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; killed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to stop &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me. But he was unsuccessful. I am requesting a meeting with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of you, at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these coordinates.
