I drink to your health! Now, I&#39;ve got a great\n&gt; idea! For the Autobots and Decepticons, why don&#39;t we have a group\n&gt; make some sort of ray, and than they blast it to cover the planet.\n&gt; When the bots come in contact with it, they wake up. People can take\n&gt; control of them. Starting the Great War 4 million years early. Now\n&gt; that&#39;s great. Now, I have some bad news. Heard from Bob Skir. He says\n&gt; he would love to come, but he can&#39;t, because he doesn&#39;t want us in\n&gt; trouble. He looked at nbwrpg.tripod.com, and saw they we were using\n&gt; some real Beast Wars names. We&#39;re kinda breaking copyright laws by\n&gt; doing that. If he comes, he&#39;ll atract attention to the site, and than\n&gt; we&#39;ll be shut down and mainframe would sue either all of us or just\n&gt; the council, depending on ow bad the infrigment. He said to keep low\n&gt; and be quiet. Either he cares of that was some lame excuse not to\n&gt; come and keep us admiring him. I think it&#39;s the latter. And JP, if\n&gt; there&#39;s a problem with this post tell me. By what I read I thought\n&gt; Hell Beast was close to the door.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream was walking towars the Maximal, whom his scanners said was\n&gt; behind a dune, when Megatron and his cronies arrived. He couldn&#39;t be\n&gt; out here alone. He would be creamed. At least that Maximal would be\n&gt; toasted if Megatron saw him. He ran, rolling and ducking fire, and\n&gt; went for the door. When he got there he saw Hell Beast, trying to\n&gt; open it. He immediatly put his hand around his neck and a launcher to\n&gt; his head.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re running with the wrong crowd. Didn&#39;t I gvie you a warning\n&gt; already?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Starscream&#39;s signal opened the door, and he took Hell Beast in with\n&gt; him. It locked behind him. He called to KitKat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Honey, look who&#39;s come for dinner!&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Fliq\n&gt;\n&gt; Between sobs, Fliq answered Ramulus&#39; question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He..*sniff* got so angry because they destroyed everything we got on\n&gt; the moon that Bronco took over. It caused him to go crazy with his\n&gt; launcher, and he shot himself.&quot; Fliq broke down again, &quot;I&#39;m the last\n&gt; one now. Gekkidama&#39;s dead. Brix is dead. I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; He\n&gt; hugged the body close and kept crying.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois kept crying for Battera, and than something. On the other side\n&gt; of the room, a mirror/mirage appeared, and it had Battera being\n&gt; abused by....him! She must be having her own dream sequence. He saw\n&gt; the battle before him, and it semed that hte past had a slight\n&gt; advantage, but not much. But he had to get her out of here. The\n&gt; program had been downloaded. It was up to it&#39;s strength now. Battera\n&gt; needed to get to saftey. He yelled at the top of his lungs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;CYBERSHARK PULL THE PLUG!!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; On the outside, Vulois&#39; voice spoke in the quietest tone, barely able\n&gt; to be heard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Cybershark pull the plug.&quot;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt;\n&gt; Prebon saw that no one was contacting the other base. They were\n&gt; sending someone, and they couldn&#39;t follow because he would see\n&gt; shadows. But Ignatius had something.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sir, I think I&#39;ve found the other base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;How?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve hacked into the Ark&#39;s computers, or what&#39;s left of them. They\n&gt; are prety messed up, but I&#39;ve found a log of the Ark&#39;s last 25\n&gt; transmissions. One goes to something called the Cybertronian Fire.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That must be it! Where s it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s too messed up to pinpoint exactly, but I think I can narow it\n&gt; down to a 5 square  mile radius. Except....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s in South America.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Well, everyone on Savage. We&#39;re going across the world!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Trainers took of for South America. On their way they sent a\n&gt; message to Slayer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re going to South America for a mission. When we&#39;re done we&#39;ll\n&gt; notify you. If we haven&#39;t when you&#39;re done find some place called the\n&gt; Cybertronian Fire. We thinks it&#39;s a Maximal base. We&#39;ll need your\n&gt; help.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
