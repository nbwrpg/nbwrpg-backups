He couldn&#39;t \nfunction in this weather in any form. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I land in a jungle&quot; \nhe thought as he stared at the white world. There was no longer \nanything he could do except wait for Lunarpine. He hoped it wasn&#39;t to \nlate when he awoke to track her. He set the scanners to let him know \nif she returned. He set the long range scanners to detect the virus \nin her system. If he couldn&#39;t go get her the least he could do was \nkeep an eye on her and hope she didn&#39;t get in a fight with another \ntranslife form. He didn&#39;t know for sure but there were only three \nbots he knew for sure were immune to the virus. Those three were him, \nLady Hawk, and now Lunarpine. Thier half stages or &quot;Transmuted stages \nwere the only things that could withstand the virus.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She continued to walk outside and away from the base.  She left a \n&gt; small trail of blood as she made her way. But the softly falling \nsnow \n&gt; would cover it in a matter of minutes.  She just kept going. She \n&gt; headed now in a northern direction. She sniffed the wind and caught \n&gt; scent of something.  She couldn&#39;t tell what it was. She shrugged \nher \n&gt; shoulders and kept walking. \n&gt; \n&gt; She came to stop about an hour later.  She was starting to feel \nvery \n&gt; tired and her shoulder was throbbing. She layed down in the snow. \nAnd \n&gt; was almosts invisible, except for the red blood on the shoulder.  \nShe \n&gt; put her head on her front paws and started to drift in and out of \n&gt; sleep.  The snow was lightly falling and started to cover her with \na \n&gt; thin veil of snow. \n&gt; \n&gt; She slipped into sleep and dreamed of the old times with Lunerpine.\n&gt; She dreamed of sparring with him again. She dreamed of fighting \nwith \n&gt; him. She dreamed of how she managed to get him to lower his gueard \n&gt; when sparring and then getting him.  She had a very large grin on \nher \n&gt; polar bear face as she lay in the snow, sleeping.\n\n\n"}}
