He turned in anger, firing off a burst of \ngreen flames at Hot Rod.\n\n---\n\nTeufel watched as two missiles heading for him exploded.  With added momentum \nfrom still moving he jets hard left, a few shots digging deep into his \nrelatively weak frame.  He begins making intense scans on Unicron while still \nfighting.\n\nHis shoulder cannons fire twenty rapid laser bolts each, forty heading \ntowards Zardus.  The left launcher on his arm fired off two missiles at the \nCybertronian Fire.\n\n"}}
