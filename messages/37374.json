Anyone who could hear must \nhave heard\n&gt; it, it was extremely loud and ear piercing. It crashed right \noutside the\n&gt; Chivtron base with a huge thud, just mere feet from the front door. \nThe\n&gt; driver of this tiny ship, which is what the object is, is a very \ngood one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow: Well, here I was thinking we&#39;d survive. I guess I was wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow walked off into another room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: Well, maybe it&#39;s peaceful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex was afraid, though. Zeni walked up to the front door.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zeni: Can I go out and see what it is?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perplex: Hold on one minute. Arrow. We might need you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arrow did not come back, however. Then a voice was heard. It must \nhave been\n&gt; heard, he was yelling at the top of his lungs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Voice: Why do people put asteroids in the way! I don&#39;t deserve \nthat! I am\n&gt; better than that! And who put this ship in the way!
