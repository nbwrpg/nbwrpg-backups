What the hell was wrong with this guy?\n&gt; Well, it was her problems now, she was the living being with the\n&gt; guy&#39;s memories, now. But he seemed so tormented, so hurt, so\n&gt; heartbroken. Divitri seen that he was just an idiot in love, nothing\n&gt; more. Then what was he doing here? How was he inside of the base?\n&gt; Somebody took him in with them, perhaps? Divitri made up her mind to\n&gt; find Gangon&#39;s girlfriend. She was nice looking, at least.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divitri: Whenever you need me, sir, give me a call, I will come to\n&gt; you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divitri said to Kluster.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divitri: I have to go at the moment, but I will return shortly\n&gt; whether called or not, count on that.
