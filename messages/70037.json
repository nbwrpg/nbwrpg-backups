As\nthey flew over the rather large island all that could be seen was the\nruin of volcanic activity. While the ground was relatively safe for\nmechanical life, its searing temperatures and poisonous gasses were\ndeadly to any biological life that was unlucky enough to be trapped\nhere.\n\nHowever quickly enough their trip took them out into the more\ntemperate open oceans, the harsh blacks, reds and browns of molten\nstone giving way to the beautiful blues, greens and browns of the open\noceans. Occasionally a large fish or oceanic life could be seen\nleaping from the waters as the trio flew over it.\n\nSoon enough though they came back over land, the oceans crashed into\ntall cliffs, which  quickly turned into trees and underbrush as they\nflew on.\n\n&quot;There!&quot; came Venom&#39;s voice as they flew. He pointed to a large\nclearing where it seemed that something large had crashed.\n\n&quot;Lamia!&quot; Venom&#39;s voice came through clearly over the radio,\n&quot;Investigate that, and tell me what you find.&quot; His voice imperious and\nalmost disdainful.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
