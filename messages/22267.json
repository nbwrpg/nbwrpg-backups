Iron Raptor could be a \nbitch, yes, but he loved her and didn&#39;t really mind.\n\nHe jerks his eyes off her hair as it is waved in the wind, knowing \nthat he&#39;d be no good in a fight if all he could do is stare at her. \nHis mind agreed to her frustration for the Maximals.\n\nProwl grinns as he hears her words to the Maximals. She sounded just \nlike a commander ... and she was hot too! Prowl grinns at Iron \nRaptor, making sure that she could hear that thought. His wings get \nready to fly, his boosters powering up.\n\n-They&#39;ll certainly be surprised!- he thinks to her, a sudden thought \noccuring to him -Hey, do you know how to fly or should I fly you back \nto base?-\n\nThe Maximal was hoping she&#39;d need him to fly her, thought he tried \nnot to think that. Any chance at holding her was welcome, and he knew \nthat this new body could easily take the trip and carry a bot at the \nsame time.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor keeps her eyes on the new bot, wondering if he was \never going \n&gt; to respond. But she doubted it.\n&gt; She rolls her eyes as she gets Prowls thoughts, not his reply. But \nthe ones \n&gt; which he had looked over her body before she had transformed.\n&gt; Men!  ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; But the beast in her mind almost seemed to urge her on, wanting her \nto make \n&gt; the first move instead of talking this out.\n&gt; Though, she simply brushed it aside as easily as an after thought, \nthe beast \n&gt; obviously offended but still there.\n&gt; Her mind snapping out at it: &quot; This is MY mind now and if you don&#39;t \nlike it \n&gt; you can gladly leave. You won&#39;t be missed!&quot;\n&gt; The creature simply gave her a look as if it were calling her a \nbitch right \n&gt; out, then settled down.\n&gt; But then the creature turnes on Prowls thoughts as they filter into \nIron \n&gt; Raptors mind, basically growling at him and asking him how he could \nput up \n&gt; with her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor simply ignores the creature, turning her attention \ntowards \n&gt; Shadow again, the wind picking up and making the cape shift and \nblow around \n&gt; her. Her hair shifting about her head as the sun grew higher in the \nsky.\n&gt; Suddenly hearing Klusters transmission in her head, wondering just \nhow many \n&gt; times he had broudcasted this until she heard the word three.\n&gt; THREE! And the Maximals still weren&#39;t there yet!?\n&gt; This was the first time that she had heard this, so at least she \nhad an \n&gt; excuse. But the others.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed.\n&gt; Enough with this Shadow...she had Maximals to rally!\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor looked towards Prowl as he contacted her through his \nmind, still \n&gt; finding this all so new. Thinking how all of this had happened so \nquickly.\n&gt; Slumping slightly in her armor.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Yeah. I heard. Boy! Is everyone in for a few \nsurprises...providing that \n&gt; they ever get to base.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then she, somehow, found the command to her new com-link and \nopened it \n&gt; to all the Maximal frequencies. Making her voice very clear and \nwith \n&gt; command.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; All Maximals, this is Iron Raptor. You&#39;ve all already been given \nthe \n&gt; command to return to base. Respond to it. There is no excuse \nacceptable for \n&gt; not doing so unless there is battle or you can give me a better one.\n&gt; Now, please return to base!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor then deactivated the comm and looked at Prowl.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Let&#39;s get going.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
