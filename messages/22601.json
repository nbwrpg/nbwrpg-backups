She read Razor Claw&#39;s mind \nand smiled. She opened her mind to him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Razor Claw.

Travelling back and forth from there \nto\n&gt; Africa always made him nervous. &quot;Remember, we&#39;re flying through \nPredacon\n&gt; airspace so remain quiet. None of us can fly and fight at the same \ntime so\n&gt; we&#39;ll be moving at top speed through there.&quot;  He stared at Razor \nClaw, he\n&gt; didn&#39;t know how to handle the Predacon on thier side, he hoped that \nit\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t come down to a fight between them. Ice was the leader now \nso he had\n&gt; to accept it. She was now his superior. &quot;Ready to lift off when you \nare\n&gt; boss.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Razor Claw wasn&#39;t to fond of having to go into a Maximal ship \nwithout any\n&gt; energy weapons.

She still felt like she \nwas\n&gt; &gt; out of her league.  &quot;Well, confidence isn&#39;t easily gained. But I \nwill\n&gt; &gt; do my best.&quot;  She turned and walked outside. She went to the pod \nand\n&gt; &gt; walked in.  She had never flown one before. She looked at the\n&gt; &gt; controls and sighed. &quot;Anyone knw how to fly one of these things?&quot; \nShe\n&gt; &gt; ahd never needed to fly a pod before. She had always had her own\n&gt; &gt; wings to use to get around. She nervously sat down in the pilot \nseat\n&gt; &gt; and looked at the controls, studying them.  &quot;Well, let&#39;s try this\n&gt; &gt; then.&quot; She grabbed the joystick in her hand and moved it forward.\n&gt; &gt; nothing happened.  She pressed a few buttons on the console. \nnothing\n&gt; &gt; happened.  She was starting to get frustrated. &quot;DARN IT, START!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her anger triggered her telekenetic powers to start up the engines\n&gt; &gt; and start up the thruster. &quot;Hey, now how did that happen? I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; even trying.&quot;  She looked as the console lights flickered and\n&gt; &gt; listened to the roar of the engines. &quot;Wow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lunarpine saw the worried look on her face. He followed her\n&gt; &gt; outside, &quot;He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made the right decision, your abilities give you an advantage we\n&gt; &gt; could never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have.&quot; He knew that she&#39;d never led before, but now she had an\n&gt; &gt; edge. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she&#39;d stop thinking like a recon bot. &quot;I&#39;ll be at your side when\n&gt; &gt; the time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes. I&#39;ve got confidence in you.&quot; he smiled and pet het along \nher\n&gt; &gt; back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She was no longer a typical recon bot she was now a prototype \nfor\n&gt; &gt; Veratis&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new life. She is now stronger than she was, faster than she was,\n&gt; &gt; and even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more powerfull than she was. If she got her confidence up she&#39;d \nbe\n&gt; &gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lead as well as the rest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC did I tell you that Icebirds function happens to be mutant\n&gt; &gt; commander?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BIC Veratis radiod ahead to the compartment where the maximal\n&gt; &gt; transport pod\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was kept.&quot; Razor Claw, Ice, and Lunarpine will be there \nshortly.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Foxfingers tinkered with the control settings. He knew better \nthan\n&gt; &gt; to take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chances of showing his face at the CF again without good reason.\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;d stolen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from them and he was sure that they wouldn&#39;t be happy about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He completed the preflight checklist and doublechecked the\n&gt; &gt; coordinates, &quot;All\n&gt; &gt; &gt; set, they can lift off whenever they&#39;re ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Razor Claw was outfitted with a DNA collector. The device was a\n&gt; &gt; probe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extending from the hand, attached internally to a power supply \nbox\n&gt; &gt; equipped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with transmitter, the information from anybody he touched would \nbe\n&gt; &gt; sent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directly back to Veratis. The plan was brilliant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
