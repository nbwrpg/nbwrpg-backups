Ideas are \n&gt; becoming exausted, if not completely exausted already. It seems to \n&gt; me that we are almost delaying the end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve created \n&gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to say that you can \n&gt; create another better one?\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree \n&gt; with. That would require several things to happen:\n&gt; 1) Changing the name of the RPG.\n&gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the website.\n&gt; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous characters (don&#39;t \n&gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the bio&#39;s of all \n&gt; my characters).\n&gt; 4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the story, but for \n&gt; how we could create the story).\n&gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story should provide that).\n&gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some of which have been, and are \n&gt; being, discussed in the login messageboard.\n&gt; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so tired.\n&gt; \n&gt; All in all, since there are more people voting anti-restart that I&#39;d \n&gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate deciding question:\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel instead of a restart?\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good \n&gt; &gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be \n&gt; eliminate  \n&gt; &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could \n&gt; choice \n&gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are member \n&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters \n&gt; &gt; playing. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, despite \n&gt; &gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been \n&gt; here \n&gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this \n&gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), and \n&gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t think \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I have \n&gt; &gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the \n&gt; saga \n&gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly pretend \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it and \n&gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my \n&gt; vote \n&gt; &gt; is no.
