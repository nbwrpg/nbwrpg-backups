And so he goes from two legs back to four as he returns =\r\nto his draconic form.  His tail whips around at the tip as it kicks up grou=\r\nnd debris in it&#39;s wake.

His jaw=\r\ns are kept slightly open as rows of diamond sharp teeth and saber like fang=\r\ns become somewhat exposed as what little light if any, glimmers off his lon=\r\ng front fangs.  \n\nThere was a definite look of authority in his expression,=\r\n as it was in the nature of the dragon to be a highly territorial creature.=\r\n  In his spark, he could sense the old dragon&#39;s soul, and can understand th=\r\nat he at one time, must have done his best to keep ecological harmony in th=\r\ne jungle.  Due to his failing health he was unable to maintain his authorit=\r\ny, and so chaos seemed to take the place of whatever balance the old dragon=\r\n maintained.  But that would change.  The soul of the dragon is now Tucson&#39;=\r\ns to keep.  So now he had another commitment to keep, he had to promise to =\r\nkeep the harmony and rid the jungle of chaos, as was the dragon&#39;s personal =\r\nvow years ago.  That vow was now Tucson&#39;s.  So with a heavy thrust of his l=\r\neft front limb, he firmly puts his taloned foot down and gives a territoria=\r\nl roar.  Come what may he was going to rescue his comrades and win back wha=\r\nt was stolen from Old Earth.
