The poision had run its course. \nThat made things a lot easier. A well heated battle he wouldn&#39;t mind, but he \nneeded to get back to base, and tell Megatron what he had. Also, he didn&#39;t \nhave a lot of space to move around in. The trees would just get in his way. \nBut either way, he won. He told Cheetor he could beat him. Sure, he busted \nhis foot, but he won.\n\nHe kicked the Maximal on the side, watched him just in case he moved. He \nthen crouched and waved two the Predacon females over.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 12:48:09 MDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt;She stopped.
