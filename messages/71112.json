He=\r\n knew she was suffering.  As he had done for Vestage, he now concentrates h=\r\nis own internal systems to try and help Talon as well.  He sends a message =\r\nto her from within his own cabin.\n\n&quot; I will, I promise.  I&#39;ve been forwarne=\r\nd about Ninjabots from my former Sensai, Master Yokitron.  Each is differen=\r\nt, and each is more unpredictable than the next.  Therefore, we must always=\r\n be aware of unpredictability.  I fear for Rodimus though, he has met this =\r\nninjabot before, and I sense this is how he had been captured the first tim=\r\ne.  And now, Nightrazor may be attempting it again.  I have to break his de=\r\nfense.  Using my sonar is out, he&#39;s disrupted my sonar systems.  He knows m=\r\ne..  And I know him.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot stays still for a moment, and then, sh=\r\ne realizes something she hadn&#39;t before.  She still had her thermal detectio=\r\nn systems in check.  She puts out a hand, and senses the temperature variat=\r\nions which translate into Nightrazor&#39;s pressense.  She raises a brow and st=\r\narts tapping on Tucson&#39;s leg.\n\n&quot; Yess!  He may have knocked out our audio a=\r\nnd video but he hasn&#39;t knocked out thermal sensing equipment.  Tucson, you =\r\nhave that ability too, since you&#39;re visually impaired.&quot;\n\nTucson puts his ha=\r\nnd out.  He could feel it.  \n\n&quot;Yes, I do.  Good work Straight Shot.  All ri=\r\nght, transform into weapon mode and mount on my arm.  It&#39;s time to make tha=\r\nt little shot in the dark come true.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot nodds, and with therma=\r\nl sensing, she transforms and leaps up onto Tucson&#39;s good arm.  It&#39;s at thi=\r\ns time where both bots combine their senses, as skilled target masters. \n\nO=\r\nnce together, they concentrate on pinpointing an appropriate target area to=\r\n disable Nightrazor and prevent him from escaping the Ark as he would hope =\r\nto do.  Straight Shot&#39;s thoughts were to strike in an area which would defi=\r\nnitely stop Nightrazor.  She probes with her thermal sensing equipment, hop=\r\ning to find a spot in his spinal servos.\nTucson concentrates as well, reali=\r\nzing that perhaps a spinal shot would be best.  He narrows an optic, and al=\r\nso senses a spot as well.  He concentrates on an area where there appears t=\r\no be an opening and meets Straight Shot&#39;s intentions perfectly.\n\n&quot;Right.  I=\r\nt won&#39;t kill him, but it will disable him. Let&#39;s hope this works. Thermal s=\r\nensing equipment is online, scanning target, confirming target location.  T=\r\narget locked.  Cross your fingers Talon, and let&#39;s hope this works.&quot;\n\nHe pu=\r\nlls the trigger, and on thermal sensory systems only, he attempts a tricky =\r\nshot to Nightrazor&#39;s spinal servos. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Airsh=\r\nadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Talon/Windlord/Elita/kup/Percepor=\r\n/Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We must be carefull&quot;said Talon with a moan, the pain was =\r\nunbearable.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Windlord and =\r\nKup continue firing against Scourge and Deepstrike.\n&gt; \n&gt; ******************=\r\n**********\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor tried to seal all the corritors that lead to the =\r\nsleep decepticons \n&gt; and autobots.

With two of his =\r\nsenses quelled, \n&gt; it was time to rely on a third, touch.  Knowing that tal=\r\nking would not help \n&gt; anything at all, he concentrates on the vibrations h=\r\ne feels through his \n&gt; hands, feet, and even the movement of the air around=\r\n him.

He could feel \n&gt; where Rodimus was stepping, and somehow, by that a=\r\nlone, he manages to find \n&gt; him, and then starts tapping lightly on his sho=\r\nulder in a morse code, that \n&gt; could be translated into communication.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot; Careful Rodimus, this is one of Nightrazor&#39;s tricks.

Then he=\r\n puts out his hand to \n&gt; sense vibrations in the air.  Through that, he cou=\r\nld get a faint idea as to \n&gt; how the air circulates around various objects.=\r\n  A cross breeze as stale as \n&gt; it was, would navigate him toward an emerge=\r\nncy generator switch.  He follows \n&gt; that breeze, and extends his hand out =\r\nto touch it, slowly comming to the \n&gt; device.  With another raise of the br=\r\now he carefully throws the switch and \n&gt; waits to see what happens.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me=\r\nanwhile, outside the Ark, Uproar could see that he&#39;d be one fried kitty \n&gt; =\r\ncat if he didn&#39;t move his aft out of the way of Cyclonus&#39;s fire.

He chuc=\r\nkles under his breath.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Bye bye BUGGIE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; His finge=\r\nr pulls back on the trigger, as he now attempts to shoot\n&gt; &gt; Waspinator dow=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Waspinator is not nearly so agile as Cyclonus in t=\r\nhe air, nor is he built \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; durable. But what he lacks in these two=\r\n qualities he makes up in tenacity\n&gt; &gt; and just foolish luck. Buzzing, much=\r\n like a real wasp he flew in, dodging\n&gt; &gt; one blast, and then another, unti=\r\nl a third one catches him in a wing \n&gt; &gt; sending\n&gt; &gt; Waspinator rocketing t=\r\nhrough the air like a cannon ball.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Me Waspinator am tired of Maxib=\r\nots beating on him.&quot; Waspinator said as he\n&gt; &gt; was flung through the air. &quot;=\r\nWaspinator TERRORIZE!&quot; he said as he shifted\n&gt; &gt; into his transmetaled form=\r\n, that of a fighter jet. The battle was far from\n&gt; &gt; over as he righted him=\r\nself and came back at Quickstride, guns blazing!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile as Hydra=\r\ns and Inferno arrived at the door to the Ark, they found\n&gt; &gt; it closed, the=\r\n massive doors clicking as they came to a stop. Getting into\n&gt; &gt; the Ark wo=\r\nuld not be that easy. In fact it was to be much more difficult \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nQuicksilver, Airhammer and Noctorro, three of the Maximal Fuzors, came\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nflying in from one side, firing their weapons at Hydras and Inferno as\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBantor, the other more land bound Fuzor leaped in to attack Hydras again!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; AND SOME DISTANCE AWAY:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap gri=\r\nns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Oooh yeah, good thinkn&#39;. I dunno if I like this place, but=\r\n it&#39;s better\n&gt; &gt; than havn&#39; those airheads blastn&#39; the fuzz off my tail end=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Together they walk into the dense overgrowth, exploring its =\r\nparameters\n&gt; &gt; with what little light comes from Night Shift&#39;s high beams.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As some of the ancient forests actually stretched acr=\r\noss much of the North\n&gt; &gt; American continent, the `parameters&#39; of the fores=\r\nt stretch out for as far \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; the optic can see. The area inside the=\r\n forest is not as densely overgrown \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; one might imagine. With the=\r\n canopy of trees over head blocking most of the\n&gt; &gt; direct sunlight, at gro=\r\nund level things are fairly clear, save for large \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; leafy growth=\r\ns of ferns or other wild plants.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That does not mean that the ground=\r\n is flat, as large tree roots, stones \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; broken ground break up t=\r\nhe ground making it treacherous for the unaware,\n&gt; &gt; making anything close =\r\nto four wheel travel, even for those of Cybertronian\n&gt; &gt; descent, extremely=\r\n difficult and hazardess. There is even the occasional\n&gt; &gt; large fallen tre=\r\ne here and there; signs that not even the tall spires of \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; fores=\r\nt are immune to the ravages of time and unforeseen occurrence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In r=\r\nobot rode, Nightshift and Rat Trap can still hear the movements of\n&gt; &gt; anim=\r\nals all around them, birds still occasionally fly up or make odd \n&gt; &gt; noise=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; as they pass. There is the occasional foot print and the obvious soun=\r\nds of\n&gt; &gt; passage of large animals, some perhaps larger than a school bus.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Should these two desire to travel back the scene of Hydras&#39; tower, =\r\nit \n&gt; &gt; might\n&gt; &gt; be possible, and maybe even safe from the sweeps that had=\r\n chased them into\n&gt; &gt; the forest, but that does not mean it will be easy or=\r\n quick.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
