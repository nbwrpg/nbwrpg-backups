But he paid it no mind, just found it annoying, disturbing\n&gt; his rest. He stretched out, arching his back, and rested again. He had no\n&gt; trouble getting back to sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt; He dreamt of Blackarachnia. He dreamt of them in the Darkside. He could\n&gt; almost smell the lava that sometimes lingered in the base, and he could\n&gt; almost smell Blackarachnia. He could hear her voice, but he couldn&#39;t make\n&gt; out much of what she said.\n&gt;\n&gt; He went to touch her, but she backed away, grinning; just like her games.\nHe\n&gt; tried again, and this time she moved to his side and kicked his leg\n&gt; playfully. Quickstrike thought of it fun now. He knew it was a dream, but\nhe\n&gt; wish it was real. He wanted to be with Blackarachnia again.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Told ya you&#39;d make it,&quot; he heard her say.\n&gt; &quot;What?&quot; he returned, a little confused why she said that. He was expecting\n&gt; something different from her. He stepped closer, and this time she stayed\n&gt; still. He watched her figure. He couldn&#39;t make out everything. He moved in\n&gt; until they touched shoulders.\n&gt;\n&gt; His moment of contempt didn&#39;t last long, something dark busted through the\n&gt; wall of the hallway, and slammed him against the other side. He saw it,\n&gt; covered in the darkness, the Vok wolf. He opened its jaws to bite down on\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;NO!&quot; Quickstrike jerked up out of his sleep, kicking at the air.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
