That also includ=\r\nes his sister, Straight Shot, who probably were transported off Cybertron a=\r\nnd near Atlantis so is to allow them ample time to recover from near trauma=\r\ntic injuries.  Tucson was taken off line after he got pegged by Cyclonus an=\r\nd was in some sort of Stasis lock for a couple of vorns.  Then he travels t=\r\no Ancient Earth with Perseus.\n\nNightshift is also G2, how he got to Ancient=\r\n Earth was probably due to the fact that as a pretender, he had connections=\r\n even with Decepticon forces, and somehow hitched a ride with them, ending =\r\nup on Ancient Earth.  Nightshift is definitely built with a vehicle alt for=\r\nm, and he finds it hard to adapt, but does the best he can under his circum=\r\nbstances.\n\nThat&#39;s the best I can think of for now.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is are interesti=\r\nng questions for each of our characters. So many\n&gt; of us I think have creat=\r\ned characters on the fly and have inserted\n&gt; them in the game or perhaps ha=\r\nve been given the character by someone\n&gt; else, and the history is sparse.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; However I would think that after all this time it is safe to assume\n&gt; t=\r\nhat no matter how we got the character, these characters are\n&gt; completely o=\r\nurs now. So now we can create, reboot or whatever our\n&gt; character&#39;s history=\r\n so that they chime in with our portrayals of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; So!\n&gt; \n&gt; Did your =\r\ncharacter come from G1/G2 time frame and some how appear\n&gt; here, did they l=\r\nive through the great war and transport to old Earth\n&gt; from the future Beas=\r\nt Wars time frame or were they constructed\n&gt; somewhere else?\n&gt; \n&gt; If they d=\r\nid have a vehicular alt mode, why have they maintained it on\n&gt; Ancient Eart=\r\nh where there are no roads?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All questions to ask ourselves about ou=\r\nr characters. These are all\n&gt; ways we can expand our knowledge of the chara=\r\ncters we play - whether\n&gt; we created them or given to us, and I look forwar=\r\nd to the answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
