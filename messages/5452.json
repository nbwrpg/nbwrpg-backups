Once she exited the waters, he had to use his \nenhancing vision to keep an eye on her. He was nearly jealous when he saw \nher eat the fruit. But he could eat something like that. He was all \ncarnivore.\n\nHe sat up and transformed to beast mode, then crawled to the shore of the \nlake. His stomach bothered him, so he had to do something about it. He put \nhis chin up to the water and drank what seemed to be 2 gallons of water.\n\nHe could feel the weather turning, dusk was coming in the matter of a few \nhours. He kept watching Stingtra. Before they went back to base, he might as \nwell find something to eat. Something like antelope was out of the question, \nso he thought of the nest best, and closest thing. Fish. He had enough \nreflexes to nab one. He needed something more solid besides all that water. \nHis stomach wasn&#39;t settling well.\n\nHe moved over to a spot, clawed over a boulder and watched the waters for a \nmovement.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
