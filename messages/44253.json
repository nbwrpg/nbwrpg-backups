He&#39;s the original G1 Megatron, and has\nnothing to do with the BW Megatron. He was seperated from the Galvatron\nwho was in this rpg.\n\nBIC:\nMegatron tried desperatly to get up, and strangle the ignorant robot,\nbut moving caused his joints to tear, and they would need a second to\nreajust. Then the stun gun hit him, and caused him to roll over. He\nbegan to lose conciousness, his eyes dimming. &quot;n..no.&quot; He whispered.\n&quot;Emergency....protocall.&quot; He commanded. Then his computer hummed to\nlife, &quot;Agnolidged.&quot; Megatron&#39;s eyes faded, but the computer countinued\nto work. &quot;All remaining energy to failsafe&#39;s.&quot; Megatron&#39;s body began to\ntwitch involountarily, and then began to shrink, transforming into his\nsmaller gun mode. Luckily he had, because the enrgy wave then hit,\nsending the gun spiralling away. Thanks to his smaller mass though it\ncaused less dammage then ussual.\n\nSpasstik stopped his barrage, when he received a message from Soundwave\nwho was monitoring the battle. He began to bound towards the Welker\nfirearm.\n\nRampage grabbed his head from the tearing pain that came from the energy\nwave, trying to force it out. &quot;Ahhhh, yes, the pain, I can feel it.&quot; And\nhe began to cackle madly again. He then noticed what was happening near\nTransmutate. He clenched his fists, as his horrible face showed anger.\n&quot;NO, no one will claim his spark again. He stays.&quot; and he pointed his\ngatling gun at Hellpeon, letting it rotate a couple of times, then\nfirring three rocketes at the speeding robot.\n\n"}}
