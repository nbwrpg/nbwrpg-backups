This is a very experimental \nship, although it is one of the best. There is a very large supply of \nnanobots on the ship, and they can make more. They&#39;re like an extension to \nCyndro&#39;s mind. Cyndro is our ship&#39;s mind. He&#39;s like another bot, but with \nquite alot more intelligence, thought capacity, and reasoning skills. He can \ncontrol every function of the ship, and its much better to have a smart mind \ncontrolling it than a machine. What I plan to do is have the nanobots go \nthrough underground and take the Cybertronian Fire apart from the inside, \nand add the pieces onto the Element. We can have alot of the city done by \nthe time the battle&#39;s over.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
