Remember? And I \ncare enough to try to have them fixed.  You can only keep going so \nlong as your other senses make up for your lost sight.  But even wth \nheat sensors, you need your vision back.&quot;\n\nShe knelt down and ran her hand through his thick, soft fur on his \nneck.  &quot;I care enough to want you to see again.  Please let him try. \nIf he can&#39;t fix them, then maybe the CR chamber can fix them.  But \nwhat have you got to lose? Nothing. So let&#39;s give it a try.&quot;  She had \na look of caring and concern on her face.  She was worried about \nhim.  She knew that if he couldn&#39;t regain his sight, he might be \ndecommisioned and put out of service.  She couldn&#39;t let that happen.  \nShe would rather die before that happened.  She knew that if he was \nput out of service, that it would kill him inside.  She couldn&#39;t and \nwouldn&#39;t let that happen. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Who told her?

If I have a problem with any\n&gt; functions I&#39;ll let someone know. I&#39;m fully capable of fulfilling my \nfunction\n&gt; and until someone with COMMAND authority says otherwise I&#39;ll thank \nyou to\n&gt; not play medic.\n&gt; \n&gt; He remembered what the computer told him. It said his optics took \npermanent\n&gt; damage. If the CR chamber couldn&#39;t fix it then what chance was \nthere that a\n&gt; Doctorsaurus could?\n&gt; \n&gt; He also knew that if Shadow Wing realized it then it was only a \nmatter of\n&gt; time before he was relieved of active duty for not being effective \nat what\n&gt; he was programmed for.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
