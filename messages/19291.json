Nighteyes was there two, she \nslipped inside in the confusion.  Shuffleing around he realized he had been \npulled into the ship. With a quick flick of his wrist he slide a daggar out \nof his wrist and dug it deep into whoever was holding him.\n    &quot;AH, Starscream, alas Im sorry to have stabbed you but I have my own \nagenda to execute. Good bye!&quot; He said, and fired two optic b;lasts at the \nbot, then running down the corridor insearch of what he needed.\n    Nighteyes looked at Starscream and then fired a missle after Hell Beast. \n&quot;Starscream, are you ok? Dont worry, he wont last long in here!&quot;\n\n    Megatron, now a safe distance from the autoguns thought the message over. \nAnd he agreed. A council was just the thing to end the MAximal reign of \ngoodness. Predacon athorioty needed to be exercised.\n    &quot;Kitkat, Megatron here, I accept your offer....but, do return Hell Beast. \nI would hate to have to destroy your ship to get him back.&quot;\n\n    Aracnia, Rampage, Tankkor, and Paralysis made there way to the ship. \nAracnia looked around, &quot;Kitkat, were here.&quot;\n\n"}}
