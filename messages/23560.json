She flaps the \nwings on her back, preparing to fly up, but Aerotaur succeeds in his \nflying leap, and knocks her to the side.\n\nShe hisses when they both land in the dust, opposite of Windlord, and \nAerotaur is lying on top of her chest. He quickly rolls off and she \njumps up, ready to attack again when she feels two hands grip her \nshoulders and keep her back. Aerotaur again.\n\nThe Bot sighs and slumps her shoulders, but obeys the unspoken order \nto keep back, she knows she should stay back anyway. \n\n&quot;Come on Windlord, kick his tush!&quot; She grins.\n\n\n"}}
