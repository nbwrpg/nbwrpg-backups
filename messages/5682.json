He felt so content, he had not a care in the world. Just then \nMagmatron loomed over the horizon, in a completely different form than he had \nseen. Almost immediately he was whisked away from Cybertron and Battera to a \nship, he didn&#39;t have a TM2 body, just a regular Transformer body, with no \nalternate mode. He was after a mismatched hodgepodge of ships. They were a \nrogue band of Cybertronian space pirates known as the Seacons. There names \nwere Coelagon, Halfshell, Scylle, Seaphantom and Terrormandar. And they \nformed the robot God Neptune (Piranacon for G1 fans). He hunted after them \nand shot all the ships they had, one though was only damaged enough to crash. \nIt landed on a remote moon. They then formed the robot God Neptune. \nCyberShark had to adapt to the area, which was covered with water, he took \nthe form of a Sharkish creature. They fought and fought and fought, \nCyberShark was nearly dead and he had only enough for one last trick, he \npopped a grenade and shoved it into the mouth of the Seacon. He was too weak \nto swim away and his ship was to far, the bomb exploded destroying the Seacon \nand CyberShark. He would never return to Cybertron.\n    CyberShark woke with a start. He had been dreaming, he must have dozed \noff watching Pantron. He looked in the CR chamber, Pantron was gone. Then he \nchecked the computer, it said he had left a few days ago. He had never \nreturned. \n    &quot;I&#39;ve slept for a few days? That cloaking thing must have done it,&quot; \nCyberShark said to himself. He heard the servos moving in his stomach. Yep \nthat was it, he was hungry.\n    He started toward the cafeteria. On his way he ran into Battera, he \ndidn&#39;t really know how to talk to her now.\n    &quot;Hi, I see you came back to the base. Have you enjoyed your stay?&quot; He \nasked, very nervously.\n\n"}}
