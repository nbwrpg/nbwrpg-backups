One last thing, It&#39;s the \nonly thing i can do for her: I hadnt time to do a full reprogramation \nprocess in her, so it would be easy to get her back to her normal status and \ncare her carfully, Hydras will try to capture her again... just to reach \nyou; I cant promise anything... But if that happen, I&#39;ll do my best to \nprotect her... It&#39;s the only thing that I can do.&quot;\n\n&gt; Rodimus set his weapon to mid setting, &quot;RUN!&quot; he barked at Perceptor,\n&gt; &quot;RUN NOW!&quot; Rodimus took aim at perceptor as he prepared to pull the\n&gt; trigger!\n\n&quot;The Shot must be in front, Rodimus&quot;replied Perceptor while he moved \nbackwards&quot;if we are trying to fool Hydras, we have to do it right... He \nknows that a Autobot never does a treacherous shoot... You can do it in \nfront, never at the back... and in that way will make things easier next \ntime...&quot;\n\n&quot;Dont cross in my way, Rodimus&quot;while he tried to hold his emotions that for \nfirst time in centuries overhelmed him &quot;I dont want to have to destroy \nyou...

It may have even seemed\n&gt; for a moment like he was about to balk at the whole idea, but finally\n&gt; he shook his head, even as a steely resolution came across it.\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re&#39;re right.&quot; Rodimus said at length. &quot;It is the only way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus held out his hand to Perceptor to shake it, one comrade to\n&gt; another. &quot;I have respect you old soldier.&quot; Rodimus said. &quot;However when\n&gt; we next meet, it will be as enemies.&quot; Rodimus sighed, &quot;But I wish\n&gt; there could have been a better choice, a different choice.&quot; Rodimus\n&gt; glanced at Perceptor&#39;s Predacon badge, and then back at Perceptor.\n&gt;\n&gt; After they shook hands Rodimus looked over at Tuscon, &quot;You know the\n&gt; way now, just go towards the surface. I will hold them off, and\n&gt; Nightshift if he is willing!&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
