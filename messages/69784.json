Sorr=\r\ny, has a habit of doing that.  \n\nBIC: \n\nThe faint voice had raised a very i=\r\nmportant point.  Was he ready to face the answers come what may.  He smiles=\r\n and makes room for Lord Elder beside him.  A very gentile look comes over =\r\nhis face.\n\n&quot; A voice asked me a very important question.  A question about =\r\nself worth, and how my choices define me. I admit, it&#39;s a hard one to answe=\r\nr.  Because to me Lord Elder, innocent lives are worth far more than my own=\r\n.  I don&#39;t lust for power, instead, I wish for it to be shared with those w=\r\nho desperately need it.  So yes, if I had to die for the innocent, I would.=\r\n  I would risk my life to save those of others.  So my self worth...  My se=\r\nlf worth can never compare to the lives of future generations who depend on=\r\n those who are willing to put their hearts into fighting for them.  And if =\r\nI could do something that could make a definite difference, it would be to =\r\nhelp the Decepticons who have been abandoned by their so called faction, an=\r\nd try to give them a sense of belonging.  Good or evil, Decepticon, Predaco=\r\nn, Autobot or Maximal all lives are precious and can never hold a price to =\r\nthem.&quot;\n\nHe puts a hand on Lord Elder&#39;s Shoulder.\n\n&quot; That goes for you too, =\r\nLord Elder.&quot;\n\nHe then turns to Kup.\n\n&quot; Yes Kup, I&#39;d really like to know how=\r\n this all happened.  Only then can I get a better understanding as to why R=\r\nodimus was unable to resist the enemy.&quot;  \n\nHe turns his attention back to L=\r\nord Elder.\n\n&quot; I wish I didn&#39;t have to wait so long for Optimus to re awaken=\r\n. But a voice just gave me the advice I&#39;ve been meaning to hear for a long =\r\ntime.  Ughhh....  Uh ohh, energy&#39;s down again.  I - think I need a recharge=\r\n.\n\nHe stumbles while getting to his feet.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I do promise you so=\r\nmething Optimus Prime, even through thoughts of betrayal, I will never turn=\r\n a blind eye on my Autobot comrade, even though, anger almost made me think=\r\n otherwise. I have to curb my temper, I&#39;m aware of that. Unless I know the =\r\nstory from Rodimus&#39;s point of view I will not judge him as you have taught =\r\nme. Innocent until proven guilty. Well, that&#39;s about it Optimus, I haven&#39;t =\r\nmuch more to tell you or to ask of you. May you rest peacefully in the arms=\r\n of Primus himself.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He gets back up onto his feet, and salutes Opt=\r\nimus Prime.\n&gt; \n&gt; The large body body of Optimus Prime continued to lay ther=\r\ne as cold\n&gt; and lifeless as it has always been. The Maximals and Autobots a=\r\nre tiny\n&gt; compared to their massive forms. Nothing moves in this chamber ex=\r\ncept\n&gt; the Maximals and Autobots, and sound itself seems dull and colorless=\r\n.\n&gt; It is a mausoleum to victory and death, and the futility of both.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Freedom creates the opportunity for choice, yet not all choices can\n&gt; be e=\r\nasily discerned.&quot; came a whisper, one that only Tuscon could hear.\n&gt;  &quot;Our =\r\nchoices are often made according to our sense of our own worth.\n&gt; Young Tus=\r\ncon, what are you worth? How do your choices define you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Somethings =\r\nstill lie beyond your ability to see.You may find your\n&gt; answers more perpl=\r\nexing than your questions.&quot; It is almost as if hands\n&gt; were laid on Tuscon&#39;=\r\ns shoulders, &quot;Are you ready for it for the answers\n&gt; you will recieve?&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The sensation of hands fade into nothing, &quot;You are almost there Tuscon, r=\r\nest.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Elder walked up as the voice faded from Tuscon, he looked o=\r\nver at\n&gt; Optimus, not quite daring to lay a hand on a foot nearly as large =\r\nas\n&gt; he was. &quot;He will rise again. It is unfortunate that it won&#39;t be for so=\r\n\n&gt; many years.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sandy, I sent you an offline question =\r\nas well :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
