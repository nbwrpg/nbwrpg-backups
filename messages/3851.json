Gould&quot; &lt;black_panther_kitten@...&gt;\r\n\r\n\n * Snow Tech decides to take a safer route. He goes\nthe long way around, although safer. Around the\nbattle. He prays that no one will see him, although he\nis in stealth mode, he knows he is more vulnerable in\nhis robot mode. He transforms back into his beast mode\nand stalks around the battle. He is almost there when\nhe spots a fellow maximal in need. The bot named Prowl\nwas hit but still fighting. He sighs and transforms\ninto robot mode. He runs into battle firing his\nelectric gun at the people that hit Prowl, taking a\nfew minor hits as he reaches Prowl.*\n\n &quot; Need help! I do, but my sis says it&#39;s a mental\nthing.&quot;\n\n * Shadow Cat sees Snow Tech run into battle. She is\nfurious! He was supposed to go to Iron!*\n\n &quot; SNOW TECH, YOU DORK! YOU WHERE SUPPOSED TO GO HERE\nNOT THERE!!!&quot;\n\n * She yelled across the battle field to him. Damn he\nwas stupid! She continued to Iron, making sure she\ntook no more damage then that to her back. She reaches\nher quickly. She begins to fire at the bots firing at\nIron, making sure her shots count. She smiled up at\nthe larger bot.*\n\n &quot; thought you needed help, mind if i join, or is this\nbattle taken?&quot;\n\n \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
