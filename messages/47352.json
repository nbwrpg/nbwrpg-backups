It is in the rules, and we would really appreciate it if you \nwould read the rules because they are important.  Just so you know, \nthe rule you broke was: Do not fire too many shots in one post. The \nlimit is: 25 rapid fire shots, 8 semi automatic shots, 4 blasts, and \n2 explosives. In addition to that, you can&#39;t fire more than two \nweapons in one post (no more than one if its explosives).\n \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Ian there are no moves, just weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:  Daydreamer dies from the explosion.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I had already posted him dead, deleted his bio, and put him on \n&gt; the Matrix list.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;auron3xx&quot; &lt;auron3xx@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Auron veers sharply upward to avoid the missle like darts that \n&gt; &gt; daydreamer fired at him. As he look down towards the new person \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; to fight him and Daydream he smiled and thought. If I could take \n&gt; both \n&gt; &gt; of them out I wonder.... his thoughts went on in this form. He \n&gt; &gt; shouted out loud &quot;Ahahahha fools, ahahaha&quot; he laughed with \n&gt; &gt; vengence. &quot;Now it is time to meet your makers. As he said this \nhis \n&gt; &gt; wings faned back suddenly. The sun bright in the distance was \n&gt; covered \n&gt; &gt; up with his wide outspread. below them a huge shadow fell where \nhis \n&gt; &gt; opponents were standing. Auron holds out his hands to both sides \nof \n&gt; &gt; his body. He begins to quiver as little slits in his wings begin \nto \n&gt; &gt; open up. As you look up Aurons eyes begin glowering red and his \nbody \n&gt; &gt; seems to shimmer in the morning daylight. &quot;Yes are you ready now&quot; \nas \n&gt; &gt; he says this his sensors lock on his foes below. As his arms come \n&gt; &gt; together, he smiles a crazy demented smile. &quot;Lock&quot; he says as his \n&gt; &gt; hordes of missles come out of his wings are in fiering postion. \nAs \n&gt; &gt; they come out it seems he has volleys and volleys of them \n&gt; &gt; stored. &quot;Are you ready now&quot; he asked once more as the first \nvolley \n&gt; &gt; came down, 20 missles locked on Daydreamer and his new opponent \nwent \n&gt; &gt; streaming toward them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC:This is like a move I just made up but when I use it my amo \n&gt; kinda \n&gt; &gt; runs out quickly\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ooc:yes i posted her going there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Night Prowler:very well daydreamer ill help you.\n\n\n"}}
