His arms, his legs. His chest rose and \nfelt quickly, as if in panting movements. He looked at Transulas now coming \nto him, with a med kit. He thought with his, damage it wouldn&#39;t help too \nmuch.\n\nHe looked back at Mentella. &quot;Yer joinin&#39;?&quot; His voice was a little quivery to \nsound tough and solid as he usually was. But the last few days were stress \nfor the little Fuzor. &quot;Good.&quot; He could feel his head lightly shaking. He \nwanted it to stop. &quot;S-stick wit&#39; us.&quot; Then he quickly added, &quot;Jus&#39; don&#39;t go \nnear Hell Beast! Ya chit-chat wit&#39; him, ah&#39;ll kill ya.&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
