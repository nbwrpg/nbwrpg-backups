He transforms into his \nrobot mode but his left wing is in pain.  He had tried to use it to deflect \nthe shot but it must have been stronger than he anticipated.  &quot;No matter, I \nwill still defeat you!&quot;  Out of each of his arms emerge double barreled \nblasters (similar to the original Optimus Primal&#39;s only more menacing).  He \ntries to move his wing but it is still stiff and sore from the shot.  He \ngrimaces &quot;I will have to fight on the ground for now.&quot;  He spots Trinity and \ndives forward.  He places his right wing between her and Deemos and uses it \nto try and knock her backwards.  This done he lands and springs back out of \nthe way.\n\n"}}
