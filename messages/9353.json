Here&#39;s some info on the Alliance:\n\nThe Alliance is a fairly elite group, mostly consisting of killers and \npsychos. It was founded by Zardus, under Vok influence, along with Wolfang, \nOminous Prime, Reptilica, and Bloodystrike. The Vok influence ordered Zardus \nto get the group together to destroy the other bots on the planet.\n\nNow however, the Alliance does what it feels is best for it, including saving \nand destroying factions, and everything like that. In short, they try to keep \nthe war going between the Maximals and Predacons, so that both factions will \nbe too busy with each other to bother the Alliance.\n\nThe Alliance was originally collectively ruled by all five of the first \nmembers, but soon Ominous Prime betrayed, Wolfang tried to take over and \nfailed (resulting in him being put in a torture chamber), and Reptilica and \nBloodystrike were not smart or competent enough to share the rule, so Zardus \ntook full command. Since then, the Alliance has killed, tortured, sometimes \ndefended, and has grown into possibly the strongest faction (or maybe second \nstrongest) of the Neo Beast Wars.\n\nThat&#39;s about it for the Alliance. Your post wasn&#39;t long at all, in fact it \nwas shorter than alot of the posts the others write. Long posts arn&#39;t bad \nRPGing, doing alot of things in one post is (there is a difference). Some \npeople like to pump their posts full of their character&#39;s thoughts and \nfeelings, making them almost novel-size.\n\n"}}
