I&#39;ll just say \nin \n&gt; this post that it was a guess, so that if it was right Striker \n&gt; would&#39;ve felt without that option. And the door to Striker&#39;s cell \nis \n&gt; open right now. Ignatius opened it. And Code, their in a mountain \n&gt; with may tunnels and their at the top. You can&#39;t just talk, cause \n&gt; they won&#39;t here you. Scan the mountain for technology and when you \n&gt; find stuff just send a comm message. No word on Bob Skir yet. \n&gt; Probably forgot about us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon gazed at Spears\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to give you the order, but it&#39;s all up to \n&gt; Striker here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon looked at him. He was hoping Striker would do something when \n&gt; he said he knew about his self destruct program, so Prebon would \nknow \n&gt; if he really has one on, but he didn&#39;t flinch. He could probably \nput \n&gt; Striker out now, but he wouldn&#39;t know if he would explode or not. \nHe \n&gt; had to go with what he had.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Striker, you don&#39;t understand, do you? The Maximals are only my \n&gt; first plan. If that fails, I&#39;m sure their are other groups that \nwould \n&gt; fall for it. The minute you leave this ship though, Savage would be \n&gt; waiting. And he wouldn&#39;t be happy. He hates you with all his soul, \n&gt; and he&#39;s nearly killed you before. He&#39;ll put you in stasis lock, \nand \n&gt; than you explode. He&#39;ll probably get really hurt, but he&#39;s tough \nand \n&gt; will survive after rehibilitation. It&#39;s not worth it Striker. You \ncan \n&gt; go free. And I also made a promise to Spears that if she serves me \n&gt; well in the recent future, I may release her. This is the only \nchance \n&gt; you&#39;ll get! I&#39;m not an evil sorcerer. I&#39;m only looking out for my \n&gt; groups best interests. This is your only chane of survival and \nlove. \n&gt; Take it!&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois looked at Child.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes I know. We have to work, or all is lost.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned back to Windrazor, Terradive and Afterburner.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll show you. Follow me.&quot; Vulois entered the base with Child \nstill \n&gt; in his arms.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Starscream/Zardus\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, Lord Zardus!&quot; He turned to Gotron.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;ve got to go help some Alliance guys beat Maximals. I&#39;ll meet \n&gt; you back here when we&#39;re ready for battle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Got it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream sent a message to Phobia.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. Zardus has agreed to loan us the entire \n&gt; Oblitercon force for our battle. They form a giant bot, remember? \nBut \n&gt; in return for this I have to go fight in one of their battles. I \nwill \n&gt; contact you when I come back to the Alliance base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream left for the battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotron sent his own message.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheeljack, this is Gotron. Zardus told me to aid you in retrieving \n&gt; the probe. What are your co-ordinates?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
