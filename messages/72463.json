I just made a block buster chicken soup from =\r\nscratch to bring to my friend&#39;s mom who was also  not feeling well.  And if=\r\n you have someone to make it for you, here&#39;s what you do.\n\nIngredients:  On=\r\ne whole chicken, three to four onions, a handful of parsley, five of six ca=\r\nrrots, several stalks of celery, and a pinch of salt, according to your tas=\r\nte.\n\nPut the whole chicken in a large soup pot, and pour just enough water =\r\nover the chicken to cover it.  Then add onions, carrots, celery and then se=\r\nason with salt according to your own taste.  Start the soup on high until i=\r\nt begins to boil, then lower to a slow to steady simmer for two to three ho=\r\nurs or until the legs of the chicken are loose.  * Just lift the chicken ou=\r\nt of the pot with a pair of tongs and jiggle the legs* .  Once the legs are=\r\n loose, you&#39;re ready to take the meat and veggies out of the soup.  First d=\r\niscard the parsley, which is only there for flavor, then in a sparate mixin=\r\ng bowl, you add the veggies and on a platter you put the chicken.  Allow me=\r\nat and veggies to cool and then start by cutting the veggies into bite size=\r\nd pieces and put them back into the broth of the soup.  Then you take the c=\r\nhicken off the bones, discard skin, fat and bones, and shred the meat into =\r\nbite sized pieces and put that back into the soup.  Once this is done, turn=\r\n off the heat and allow the soup to cool. Once it cools down the fat will r=\r\nise to the top and it will solidify.  When you&#39;re ready to eat it, just ski=\r\nm the top of the soup and remove the fat.  Heat to desired temperature slow=\r\nly and boil up your favorite pasta and most importantly, ENJOY.\n\nThis is ou=\r\nr family recipe that comes straight from Florence, Italy.  Trust me, you&#39;ll=\r\n love it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;adamsafran&quot; &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC - Sorry for the lack of posting, running a fever and so I fear =\r\nI won&#39;t be super active until it passes.
