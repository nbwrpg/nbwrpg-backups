She was wasn&#39;t glad that Lunarpine hadn&#39;t \nreturned.  She was getting more and more worried about him.  She was \nabout to go search for him if he didn&#39;t return soon.\n\nShe just had to know that he was alright and unharmed. If he came \nback all beat up and banged up, she would first get him back into \nhealth again and make sure he was alright.  Then she would let him \nhave it.  She was mad at him for making her worry like this.  But \nreally, she was concerned and hoped for is safe return.\n\nShe walked to the entrance and kept an eye out for him.\n\n\n"}}
