But when she looked back at Prowl she suddenly remembered the last time he looked like that, he was daydreaming about her again! She rolled her optics and was just about to tell him to snap out of it when a missile barely misses them, causing her to gasp with surprise and jump. Closing her optics for a moment but when opening them again found the entire world unfocused. They were in a spin. Then closing her optics again.\nWhen the spiral had been completed she found herself clinging for life with her arms around Prowls neck, her body glued to his and her head resting on his collar-plate.\nIron Raptor then opened one of her optics and looked around, finally coming to rest with the sight of Prowl�s face.\nAs much as she loved him, she still hated flying!\nShe was never meant for air combat, her feet belonged on the ground!\nIron Raptor then opened both optics and chanced a glance behind them, swallowing back what remained of her last meal. She was beginning to feel more awful then she had before, and being a few hundred meters off the ground didn�t help any better.\nThe Alliance bots were perusing them, but then the Predacons were in the tails of the Alliance�as well as them.\nShe then looked back to Prowl with an annoyed and slightly queasy sigh; this just wasn�t her day!\nShe heard him tell her to hold on tight, but if she held on any tighter she�d be choking him!\nBut with all this firepower coming towards them they had to act instead of flee, fight back instead of retreat.\nIron Raptor suddenly growled and began to move in Prowl�s arms so that she could clearly see the oncoming force.\nManterror with his 2 ion discs, Injector with 2 stinger missiles, BumbleBee with another set of stinger missiles, Scattershot with 10 explosive rounds from his rifle, 16 shots in all going after them as well as a few bots themselves!\nThey wouldn�t be able to miss them all and with her as extra weight Prowl wouldn�t be able to mauver all that well. This was bad!\nShe looked up at Prowl.*\n\n� We�re in deep slag if we�re caught off balance, you NEED to put me down!�\n\n* But as she said this she gave him a quick visual and location of every charge heading for them, hoping that it would appear on his internal screen and alert him.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
