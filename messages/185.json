She \ncouldn&#39;t stand them near her forest. She slowly made her way silently to the \nedge of the forest, watching the two bot&#39;s position, causiously. She knew \nthey were robots. She could smell it on them, and she could see it through \ntheir beast modes. No beast like those two could be living inhabitants of \nthis planet.\n\nHer breath went heavy and smooth, stalking through the forest towards the \nFuzor and the other raptor. She kept low, with her long tail out, and her \neyes locked on them. One could fly, but she could so could she. That would \nbe no challenge. She was uncertain about the raptor. But Cyber Claw didn&#39;t \nworry too much, she was bigger than the other was. She had hunted and killed \nsuccessfully many times. She knew how to hunt down bots as well. They were \nsimple. Some didn&#39;t come with strong instincts and brains like hers.\n\nShe moved a little faster, picking up the pace. She was careful in where she \nput her two feet. She watched the fallen leaves and branches below her. She \nwent ahead the two bots, moving like a shadow, then crouched and waited for \nthem.\n\nShe turned her head, keeping still, blending in with her brown body colors, \nagainst the tree behind her. She kept her tail straight, waiting.\n\nShe watched, tense and ready to strike. She flexed her three fingers. Her \nclaws were curved like daggers. Below her, on her feet were the menacing \ninner toe claws, that made her species famous. She waited until the raptor&#39;s \nside came to her front, then she leaped out, screeching wildly, throwing her \nfront claws out. She tossed her head and whipped her tail.\n\nShe was a bot so much in Dinobot&#39;s appearance.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
