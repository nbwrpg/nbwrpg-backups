Now I need a few (the more the better) to help me test it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The script can be found at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nbwrpg.com/nbwrpg/cgi-bin/Login/login.cgi\n&gt; \n&gt; What I want you guys to do is log in as the test account (username:\n&gt; &quot;test&quot;, password: &quot;test&quot;. CASE SENSITIVE, no quote marks), and put the\n&gt; server through as much hell as possible. Make profiles with funky\n&gt; characters, HTML code, names with spaces, names with funky characters,\n&gt; anything imaginable to try to completely confuse the system. If it\n&gt; crashes on you, please email me and tell me exactly what you did prior\n&gt; to it crashing, and I&#39;ll fix the bug. Right now all that is available\n&gt; is the character editor/maker/viewer/killer, but as soon as it is\n&gt; totaly debugged, more stuff will be made available, like polls, chat,\n&gt; and stuff like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope as many people as possible participate in this. Besides, its\n&gt; fun crashing my comp, and here&#39;s your chance to! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be expecting a flood of bug reports tomorrow. Get to work,\n&gt; testers! I&#39;m also totaly wasted from all the programming, so I&#39;m going\n&gt; to bed. Goodnight, everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
