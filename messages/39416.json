But let me first tell you about my sins. As I see \nthe look on your face, you must have heard of me, or at least of my \nso-called brother, X. As you know, he was captured after the destruction of \ncolony Omicron. In fact, I was part of the team that went to get him, but he \nhad us ambushed by some predacons. I went berserk and slaughtered them all, \nbut when my superior saw that I wouldn&#39;t stop, he ordered me to, and I \nengaged him in combat. He is one of my victim now, and that is one thing I \nshall never wish to forget, elseway I might repeat this again...\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Questionable?\n&gt;Date: Mon, 09 Jul 2001 19:43:13 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor nodded at HotRods report, rather impressed.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Thank you, Hot Rod.   And as a reward for your loyalty, I would ask that\n&gt;you please assemble a unit of 12 outside the city limits. Ready to move out\n&gt;and assist the Chevron cause at my command.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Thus...she placed her faith in the Maximal that stood at her side. As\n&gt;squad leader for this mission.\n&gt;It HAD occurred to her time and time again that, someday and soon, she had\n&gt;to single out and officially title a transformer to take up the role of\n&gt;2nd-In-Command.\n&gt;But her attention was soon grasped by AzureBlade; a pleased look crossing\n&gt;her features when he bowed but then that expression was wiped clean off her\n&gt;face when he suddenly spoke his TRUE name.\n&gt;&lt; Protoform Z?!&gt;\n&gt;She remembered the reports on the Protoform X that was in the original \n&gt;Beast\n&gt;Wars...and she remembered the fight she had with it before she was named\n&gt;3rd-in-command.\n&gt;Slag! That had been one tough bot.\n&gt;And here, bot bowing right in front of her was just ANOTHER of those\n&gt;creatures.\n&gt;Iron Raptor&#39;s expression became cold as she eyed AzureBlade, a thoughtful\n&gt;brow lifting. The dominant claw on her boot armor coming down and sparks\n&gt;flew as the tip collided with the armored floor.\n&gt;It was questionable...yes. But could she condemn another prototype that was\n&gt;no different then herself?\n&gt;Her expression softened a bit.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; AzureBlade...though I know nothing of your sins I am sure that, as long \n&gt;as\n&gt;your actions remain true to the Maximal cause, orders are followed, and \n&gt;your\n&gt;loyalty remains pure for the remainder of your existence, all will be\n&gt;forgiven.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* A growl tricked from her throat as blue eyes narrowed.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; But for a time being you will remain close to me. So that you not only\n&gt;show that you are worthy to the fellow Maximals but to me as well.\n&gt;Until you have proven so, your acceptance into this unit is reserved.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Iron Raptor looked down at him.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; Do you understand?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
