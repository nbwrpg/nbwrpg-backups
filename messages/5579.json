She glanced over at Scorponok and smiled.  She then returned \nto her scanning.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nKitKat:: She looked at the big red bot for a few more moments.  She got \nbored and went outside.  She saw Quickstrike and stringtra talking.  She \nwent outside, past the two in the grass and went running into the trees. She \nwent out over the hillside and into a small glen. She looked around and \nsniffed the air. &quot;Hmm, I smell another wolf. I smell two male wolves in the \narea.&quot;  She ran to the other side of the glen.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nShadow Wing:: She went over to Prowl, &quot;What will you have me do to help?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBattera:: She was near the entrance of the Destron base.  She could look \noutside and see daylight. She walked outside and spread her wings.  She took \noff and headed skyward. She flew in and out of the clouds, just enjoying the \nday and cool wind under her wings.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
