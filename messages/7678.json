She was \nglad to leave Megatron&#39;s presence.  She didn&#39;t like him for the fact \nthat his temper was highly unpredictable.  She looked at Rowdy.\n&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go and find him. With luck, we&#39;ll all be home in time \nfor a evening hunt.&quot;  She tugged at Rowdy&#39;s furs and pulled one off \nhim. &quot;Coming?&quot; She put the fur in a corner where it would be safe and \nundisturbed. Then she walked out of the cave.\n\nShe turned on her scanner.  She had &quot;borrowed it&quot; from Darkmouse and \nstarted homing in on Quickstrike&#39;s signal.  She followed the signal \nquite aways from the base.  She found the entrance to a \ncave.  &quot;Whoah, is it dark in there.&quot;  She took out a small pen light \nfrom a small compartment in her wrist and shined the light inside.\n\nShe walked in and looked around.  The cave was at least three or four \ntimes bigger than the current Pred base.  She wondered if megatron \nwould move the base here once he was told of it&#39;s existance.\n\nShe looked around for Rowdy.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Megatron/Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron turned to KitKat. He watched as a large wolf-bot came to \nher side, \n&gt; dressed in brown, heavy furs. He had a nervous look on his face. \nRowdy Wolf \n&gt; placed his rifle behind his armor and tugged at his own furs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, this is the Rowdy Wolf Quicksrike spoke of.&quot; Megatron said, \nglaring at \n&gt; him. &quot;I am proud to have you on our Predacon ranks.&quot; He thought to \nhimself \n&gt; as he recalled Quickstrike telling him he was a Maximal. He may \nhave to a \n&gt; looked after.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf nodded and pulled the corners of his mouth back. It was \nbecoming \n&gt; ovious to Megatron that he was getting overheated with all those \nheavy furs.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rowdy Wolf stripped off a few layers off, Megatron turned his \nhead back \n&gt; to KitKat. He sighed at her. &quot;If you must, go ahead and look for \nthe Fuzor.&quot;\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
