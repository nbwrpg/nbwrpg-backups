He pauses in the hallway, still against the \nwall. Would the Alliance really put Iron Raptor and Tavatron in the brig? He \nfrowns. After what he heard of the last attempt on his comm-link, the \nAlliance would get careless. But not that careless. Instead.....\n\nProwl&#39;s eyes widen, remembering the tour Zardus had given him of the base \nback in the days when the Maximals and the Alliance had fought side by side. \nHe remembered how Zardus had shown him the torture chambers, boasting on the \ndifferent devices.\n\nProwl hisses into his silencer. The Alliance would shurely teach the Maximals \na lesson after an attempt was made to steal away the hostages, and one had \nbeen made.\n\n&quot;The torture chambers!&quot; he exclaims into his comm-link, &quot;Let&#39;s check there \nfirst.&quot;\n\nProwl looks back at Dinobot, his eyes widening as he sees a bot. &quot;Watch out!&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScattershot walks into the Alliance base, happily talking to DeathStorm&#39;s \nhead.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I hate that too! But the best thing: icing!&quot; Scattershot says happily \nto the head as he aproaches Dinobot and Prowl&#39;s position.\n\n"}}
