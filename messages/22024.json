His team follows behind, all of \nthem except for Scyther easily over four feet taller than the two \nPredacons. Scyther was only seven feet, but looked as deadly as the \nrest of them.\n\nKillfest walked up to Diamond, looking down at her like she was \nfairly inferior. The terrorist leader was mostly red, a black stripe \nrunning around his waist and black spots on his torso. Horns grew out \nfrom the sides of his head, angling forward. Behind him stood the two \nbots that dwarfed even him: EndBringer and Demise, and to the side of \nthose the two other members of his team.\n\nEndBringer stood about two feet taller than Killfest, snarling down \nat the Predacons. His body was black and purple, four tentacles \nreaching out from his back, slowly moving through the air. \nEndBringer&#39;s arms were crossed at his chest.\n\nDemise, in his only form, looking like a giant croutched-over beast, \nstood on all fours, resembling a gorrila that had been magnified by \nquite alot and then roasted. His body was a charred red color, his \ngiant front claws touching the floor at the knuckles. His knees bent \nforward, he looked more like a beast than a bot, only a little bit \nshorter than EndBringer, but he was crouched.\n\nGreven, standing to the left of Demise, was almost as tall as \nKillfest, looking like a normal bot on steroids, his body varying \nshades of gray. Ok EndBringer&#39;s side was Scyther, in one of his \nalmost-unlimited supply or robot modes.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think your pod will fit my crew,&quot; Killfest says, glancing at \nthe pod behind Diamond.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He comes out of the ground next to Diamond&#39;s pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Demolition::\n&gt; \n&gt; He woke up.
