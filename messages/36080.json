He glances over at Repungus. &quot;He&#39;s mine,&quot; he says and jumps forward, landing near Dogged.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dogged turns and starts to run, staggering as he flees. &quot;I NEED backup, my\n&gt; weapons capacity is null and my damage is pretty bad.&quot; The shots hit the\n&gt; ground on both sides of him sending him rolling across the floor putting a\n&gt; few more dents in his chassy.\n&gt; \n&gt; A voice came over the small bots comm, Brandings velvet voice sounded\n&gt; angelic to Doggeds ears until he heard the message. &quot;We&#39;re all up to our\n&gt; ears in battle, if you can run an intercept pattern I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Easy for her to say&quot; he thought fighting the pain and once again forcing\n&gt; himself to rise. The bum and Repugness verses a damaged and weak Dogged. the\n&gt; fight seemed fair to the Cybrat. &quot;If this is the way you want it you rejects\n&gt; from the scrapheap are going to change your mind real soon!&quot; the smallest\n&gt; Cybrat winced as he forced the words out trying to sound brave. With the\n&gt; words of bravado fresh on his lips he placed a set of spiked brass knuckles\n&gt; on his good hand and forged into action.\n\n\n"}}
