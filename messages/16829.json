He couldn&#39;t make out the words, but she sounded sad, almost pleeding \nfor something. An image of her crying face came into focus as Prowl regained \nconsciousness, and he could feel her fingers on his face. A surge of pain \ngoes out from his shoulder as Iron Raptor shakes him, mech fluid continuing \nto leak onto the ground.\n\nProwl could feel her tears dripping onto his armor. He was relieved that she \nwas at least touching him. He had thought that he would never feel her touch \nagain, but he was glad that he had been wrong. Prowl tries to open his mouth \nto say something, but only half of his systems were functioning, and his \naudio generators were not among them.\n\nSlowly, Prowl raises his arm, stroking his fingers against Iron Raptor&#39;s \ncheek. His hand strokes down to her neck before going limp, not enough energy \nto keep it up. He felt the room start to fade, more of his systems begining \nto shut down. But there was something he still had to do before he could go. \nDiverting most of his energy to his audio generators, Prowl feels them \nreactivate, his lips begining to move, but barely.\n\n&quot;I love you,&quot; he whispers in a barely audible voice. He could feel more of \nhis systems shutting down, the room continuing to, fade. Feeling more and \nmore lightheaded, Prowl knew that death was coming. Soon, he would be one \nwith the Matrix .... once more.\n\nBut no! He couldn&#39;t die yet! For many reasons, but one in particular: Iron \nRaptor. If he died, she would have no one to love. He knew she would be sad, \nand the main reason of his life was to make her happy. Prowl slowly leans his \nhead back, fighting to focus his optics on her face. All he wanted was to \nkiss her one more time, just once, to feel her lips on his before he died. \nProwl looks up at Iron Raptor, his optics filled with love, but fading \nrapidly.\n\n"}}
