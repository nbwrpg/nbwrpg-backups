She started to back up a few feet.  She \nturned and ran towards a tree.  She got behind it and stood up against it.  \nShe looked at her wounds.  They were extensive.  Her shoulder was sliced \nthrough.  One of her ribs was exposed.  She knew she needed help and it \nwould have to be soon or she would ceace to function.  She punched in her \ncomlink and called out.*\n\n&quot;Maximal in trouble, big trouble.  I need help.&quot;\n\n*Her breathing became labored and she was starting to gasp for breath.*\n\n&quot;I say again, Maximal in trouble.  I could really use some help here.&quot;\n\n*All she could do now was pray for a miracle.  Although she knew she had one \nalready, she wasn&#39;t to proud to hope for another one.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
