He hit with such force that the whole ground shook. He looked \nat the bot who just escaped him. He could tell he was weak. Except he \nwas weak too. He would need rest soon, to make battle scars. But he \nwanted ths bot dead. He would fall. Behind the bot was a huge rock \nwith a giant spike on it. Savage got up, shook his head, and started \nbeating his wings, making such winds that it would drive the bot \nbackwords into the spike.\n\n\n"}}
