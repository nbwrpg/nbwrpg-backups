Not even \nknowing that the ship had been destroyed, he simply lay there and was \nunresponsive when Astral took the time to shake his shoulder.\nHis body wasn�t damaged and neither was his mind, but the simple and organic \nside of his functioning�s had made sure that he had passed out from the \npressure of the ship.\nAnd even as he was lifted into the air D failed to respond, until the sudden \nfeeling of weightlessness hit his mind like a tone of bricks!\nD�s eyes opened slightly as he suddenly saw a bot rise up from him, barely \nnoticing that she was actually staying in one spot and HE was dropping!\nWhen Starlight finally caught him his eyes snapped open and he flailed in \nthe air, scrabbling with his clawed hand-like paws. Trying to get a hold on \nher for fright of being in an experience he had never been in before. D�s \nfeet had always been on the ground.\nHe whined and struggled, his technological spark beating like wild fire in \nhis large chest. He was frightened and with his sheer size he could pull \nthem both down if he continued struggling as he was. But he had never been \nany more then 5 feet off the ground and he didn�t know this.\nD looked up at Starlight; his ears pressed flat against his head and his \nclaws trying to dig in to make sure he didn�t fall. Even though he was \nrelatively safe. His mind was reeling. *\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
