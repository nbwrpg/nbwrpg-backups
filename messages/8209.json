But that didn&#39;t matter.  She \nwas \n&gt; enjoying the moment.  She knew that they were supposed to be having \na \n&gt; more physical fighting match between them.  But she knew that she \nwas \n&gt; no match for him physically.  He was stronger than her pure and \n&gt; simple.  She wasn&#39;t build for fighting and she knew it.  So she had \n&gt; to out think him as opposed to trying to out mucsle him. \n&gt; \n&gt; She saw him run into the cave.  She swooped down and transformed \ninto \n&gt; bot mode.  She kept her sachel on her shoulder and looked around.  \nHe \n&gt; was inside the cave, but that didn&#39;t mean that she would follow him.\n&gt; \n&gt; She climbed up to the roof of the cave and stood on top of the \n&gt; opening.  She layed down and hung her head down to \n&gt; yell. &quot;HHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  \n&gt; IIIIINNNNNN THEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE!&quot;\n&gt; She got up and jumpd back a few feet just incase he tried to grab \nher \n&gt; and pull her down.  She hoped he heard her well enough.\n\n\n"}}
