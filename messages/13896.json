The Aliens, better known as the Szhi&#39;kuri, were telepathic \nbeings and had helmets the they used to increase there telepathy. By useing \nthis, Megatron could hopefully communicate with the Armada.\n    &quot;Ah, there it is. Tarantulas, bring it here and we can have this whole \nthing settled. Yes.&quot; He said pointing.\n    The spider did as he was told and brought the helmet over to Megatron. \nAracnia watched suspiciously standing next to darkmouse. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;\n    &quot;Getting rid of the Aliens. When I say, &#39;go&#39;, you type in that code. \nAlright?&quot; Megatron said to Tarantulas.\n    Megatron placed the helmet on, which was very tight, and told the \ntarantula to &#39;go&#39;. Tarantulas did so, and a bright light came from the \nhelmet. Megatrons eyes suddenly went blank, and his body limp.\n\n    His mind raced through the vast psycic pain that would send him into the \nA.I. of the Armada.....and if he could, Megatron planned on taking the ship \nover and destroying the autobots one and for all.\n\n    Apollo detected the sudden intruder and isolated Megatron in a small \nfile. He suspected something like this would happen....and he could make it \nwork to his favor.\n    Apollo then scaned Megatrons mind and picked out a form that would \ncommunicate with the far inferior beings. Once the form was picked, Apollo \nreturned to Megatron.\n    &quot;Why do you intrude here?&quot; Apollo said to the ghostly form of Megatron.\n    He roared back, &quot;Im trying to save my troops for your magnificent vessle!&quot;\n    Apollo detected his lies, and for this Megatron would be punished as well \nas his troops. &quot;You are rejected. Program Inspector will be launced for \ncomplete recoreding of the happenings at Bunker 5471.&quot;\n    Before Megatron could respond, he was shot back into his frail body, that \nwent into stasis. Apollo now had to send the Inspector, based on Megatrons \nmind, to investigate.\n\n"}}
