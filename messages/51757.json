I was having sexual fantasies about the Pink and\nYellow Power Rangers, when everyone else was thinking\nabout being the Red Ranger.  And I have an IQ of 150. \nPlease don&#39;t shove it down my throat if yours is\nhigher, I&#39;m just telling you I&#39;m not an idiot.  And\nwhile I sometimes sound rude I said that simply\npointing out &quot;long live&quot; is the general expression. \nActually &quot;long life&quot; may be nice for a change, but\n&quot;long live so-and-so is all I&#39;ve ever heard said.  I&#39;m\nnot taking a shot at airly, if I made a mistake like\nthat in Spanish I&#39;d want him to tell me.\n\n--- Hollywood Narrator\n&lt;hollywood.narrator@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yes, I agree, Lurker, everything you said was\n&gt; correct, as usual, but we have to realize that\n&gt; Dewboy is only an idiot. He can&#39;t help it. We have\n&gt; to be nicer to idiots, because they often don&#39;t\n&gt; understand words like &quot;long&quot; or &quot;life.&quot; It&#39;s our\n&gt; responsibility to be patient and understanding, and\n&gt; be a little more gentle to all of the rude idiots by\n&gt; showing that we care. I.E.: Dewboy, please don&#39;t be\n&gt; a stupid faggot. Please learn basic English and stop\n&gt; taking shots at Airly for no reason. While you&#39;re at\n&gt; it, please stop being a dick.

Maybe Airly\n&gt; meant &quot;Long life to NBWRPG&quot;.  It makes perfect\n&gt; sense.  She&#39;s basically cheering to have a long life\n&gt; in and for NBWRPG.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
