Quickstrike crawled out of\n&gt; the CR chamber and looked over his claws. Twice in one day wasn&#39;t his idea\n&gt; of getting around. He looked up to see Mantella. He narrowed his eyes at\n&gt; her, and said, &quot;That&#39;s none of yer business!&quot; He snapped his claws at her\nto\n&gt; back her up.\n&gt;\n&gt; He transformed to his robot mode and walked out of the room. He paused,\n&gt; glaring at the room where they were holding Dark Mouse. Why should he care\n&gt; anymore? The Predacons---Megatron&#39;s Predacons had her. He could ask her\n&gt; later. He walked away, down the corridor. He went the direction where\nBlack\n&gt; Arachnia had gone before he had been shot to slag eariler. He thought he\n&gt; could make up with her. He wanted to talk to her, but Dark Mouse overrided\n&gt; him logic circits.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5544/10/_/_/_/961367098/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
