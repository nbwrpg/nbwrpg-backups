It all \nstarted when Galvatron landed in a stasis pod and joined the Predacons.  he \nserved loyally for awhile, but soon escaped from the base and built his own: \nthe Deathcon.  he found many blank protoforms, so he created his own army: \nhis treacherous brother and the original murderer of Sideswipe, Megastorm, \nand the Aerocons: Autojetter, Falcon, Snare, Jetstorm, and Cyclonus.  the \nAerocons combined to form the gestalt Skyquake.  Soon after Galvatron \nsuffered a humiliating defeat from a 5 year old child, Deathsaurus arrived \nand killed Megastorm, Galvatron, Cyclonus.  he built his 2 new warriors: \nLeozak and Hellbat.  Falcon and Snare deserted, and joined the Destrons, and \nJetstorm joined the Chosen Mafia.  Leading up to now, with the Neocons being \na small band of four.  But that isnt the WHOLE story.  Galvatron had a dark \nsecret he had never unveild, NEMISES!  nemises was a giant monster ship that \ncould destroy an entire faction.  Deathsaurus practiced long hours and \nbelieved could now control this Nemises.  He decided to use it immeadiatly::\nDeathsaurus: Nemises, i summon you!\n::The giant ship, which looked like a submarine with an eye, popped into \ntranswarp space::\nDeathsaurus: YES!!!!  Now destroy everything!\n::The Nemises disobeyed Deathsaurus, for Galvatron, not him, was its master.  \nIt fired a death ray at the Deathcon::\nDeathsaurus: NO!! I WILL NOT PERISH!  TILL ALL ARE ONE!\n::Deathsaurus exploded, with nothing left of him.  Autojetter and Leozak \nimmeadiatly realize that something is wrong  they look up to see Nemises \nfiring at them::\nAutojetter: AHHHHHH!!!!!\nLeozak: what the f-\n::He is cut off as the world seems to have been ripped in half.  He and \nAutojetter are dead before they hit the ground, but there bodies remain among \nthe ruins of the once  proud base.  Eventually the sun came out, the storm \nstopped, and a new day began::\n\nOOC: Now its up to Shomin weather Hellbat survives\n\n"}}
