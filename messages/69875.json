Like all Autobots he had not the ability to fly.  Yet, =\r\nhe could glide for short distances in Robot mode, when it came time to do h=\r\nis spy work.  He knew that would be a dead giveaway if he did not fly.  Ano=\r\nther lie had to be cooked up.\n\n&quot; Yeah, fly, right.. I would if someone reme=\r\nmbered ta install that capability in me.  Apparently somehow I missed the b=\r\noat when that feature was ben&#39; built inta the Decepticons.  Still kinda mif=\r\nfed about it too. Unfortunately I&#39;m stuck stickn&#39; ta ground travel.&quot;\n\nHeari=\r\nng all this, Tucson heaves a sigh to himself.  Night Shift had once again c=\r\nome up with a resourceful way of getting around his incapabilities.  He won=\r\ndered if part of himself was rubbing off on his black metallic comrade.\n\n--=\r\n- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot; Now, Hydras, yeah...

With his large clawed hands h=\r\ne snipped off the arrows\n&gt; as best as he could.
