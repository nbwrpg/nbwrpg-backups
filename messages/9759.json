The acid burned in her other\n&gt;shoulder.  She looked at Drill bit.  She felt pain surge through her\n&gt;body.  She looked at Drillbit and then turned to look at Stingtra and\n&gt;the others.  She felt the pain again.  She also felt tired and\n&gt;drained.  She walked over to the tree and sat down at it&#39;s base.  She\n&gt;leaned back and rested.  She didn&#39;t have much energy left to fight\n&gt;with.  With all the damage and loss of mech fluid, she would need\n&gt;help soon.  But she had to stay with her leader.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Mosquitor::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mosquitor&#39;s head detatches from his body, hitting a tree as the\n&gt;rest of him\n&gt; &gt; collapses on KitKat.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
