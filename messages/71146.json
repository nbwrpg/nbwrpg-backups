Quickstride steps in to lift Talon out and holds her gently in his arm=\r\ns.\n\nTucson now transforms into robot mode. \n\n&quot;Looks like my time in the CR =\r\nchamber will have to wait.  But Talon should go now.&quot;\n\nQuickstride nodds an=\r\nd quickly wisks Talon to the CR chambers.  Tucson turns toward Rodimus.\n\n&quot;B=\r\noth medics down..  And an Ark in need of repair..  Hmm, I did a good portio=\r\nn of that damage with my sonar system..  First and foremost, are our comrad=\r\nes.&quot;\n\nHe walks slowly to a door, which leads into the one room he never tho=\r\nught he&#39;d enter.  His own private workshop.  Before becomming a Prime, he h=\r\nad taken great pleasure in restorring old weapons and those in desperate ne=\r\ned of repair.  And in some cases, he would also help to repair damages to o=\r\nther comrades.  He opens the door with a code.  Straight Shot peeks in.\n\n&quot;W=\r\now, it&#39;s just as you left it Tucson.  Everything is still there.  Your enti=\r\nre workshop, tools, materials, all neatly categorized according to form and=\r\n function.  A little dusty in here but still workable space.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds=\r\n.\n\n&quot; True, but things must be kept clean.  And to properly conduct repairs =\r\non comrades, I&#39;d rather be where they can be monitored safely.  I need some=\r\n tools, and materials. I can get them here, and bring them to the medical b=\r\nay.&quot;\n\nHe turns to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me.=\r\n  It&#39;s about time I actually put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired fr=\r\nom Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to Tucson.\n\n&quot; You really sh=\r\nould have an assistant.&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;Yes.  Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d l=\r\nike you to assist me.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supe=\r\nrcyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson flashes his headlights dim=\r\nly in reply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Of course. But if you could, please, allow us to res=\r\nt together. Knowing\n&gt; that she is with me, safe from harm, only then can I =\r\nrest as well.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was rather obvious that his love for Talon grew e=\r\nver stronger. He was\n&gt; not able to show her that due to being under such du=\r\nress, but now, there was\n&gt; time to express his feelings for her. He was a b=\r\not true to his word. His\n&gt; love was real, and it would remain as such.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot knew him well. She knew what he meant and that made her v=\r\nery\n&gt; happy. Her big brother had finally found someone to be with and she o=\r\nnly\n&gt; hoped that it would lead to something more special in the future.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Aw, now how can ya refuse a request like that huh Perceptor? I think=\r\n I\n&gt; know what this means.. And I hope one day, somewhere along the line, t=\r\nhat\n&gt; they&#39;re both as happy as Rodimus and Nightlight, with a family of the=\r\nir\n&gt; own.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus nodded as the others talked, taking =\r\nhis time to look around the\n&gt; room, trying to be absolutely sure that nothi=\r\nng critical is damaged.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Outside, Hydras and his team were little mo=\r\nre than a dot in the skies as\n&gt; they moved away carrying their own injured =\r\nwith them. All around the Ark\n&gt; defensive shielding began to flicker into p=\r\nlace on the heels of the\n&gt; Predacons and Decepticons vacating the area, wea=\r\npons and guns began to twist\n&gt; and turn as they initialized and calibrated =\r\nthemselves =96 another Predacon\n&gt; attack would not be so easy. In fact this=\r\n one would not have been if it were\n&gt; not for Nightrazor sabotaging many of=\r\n the Ark&#39;s systems and then the sonic\n&gt; wave that Tuscon had sent out.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Even as the main systems were coming up, it would be some time before ever=\r\ny\n&gt; systems was running again as they should.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy near the gigantic=\r\n forms of Megatron and Optimus, even in death it\n&gt; seemed that these two we=\r\nre locked in some sort of titanic struggle. He\n&gt; looked around, his single =\r\noptic taking in the entire vista and then he\n&gt; turned back to Tuscon and Ro=\r\ndimus.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;For the moment the time stream would appear undamaged.&quot; Legacy=\r\n pronounced.\n&gt; &quot;However it is difficult to know the full ramifications of e=\r\nven these small\n&gt; changes that have occurred, and if we have not inadverten=\r\ntly changed\n&gt; something that was.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus looked at Legacy, &quot;You&#39;re r=\r\night.&quot; Rodimus came to stand beside\n&gt; Legacy, who had himself moved towards=\r\n Tuscon. &quot;We need to find a way to\n&gt; secure this Ark. If it is damaged too =\r\nmuch, or too many changes are made,\n&gt; then all this that we are fighting fo=\r\nr would be for nothing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A call came in from Ramulus, &quot;Rodimus, Tuscon=\r\n, our medics are both down. I&#39;m\n&gt; holding them together with a med kit, but=\r\n I am going to need some help down\n&gt; here.&quot; Ramulus&#39; voice was calm, and ye=\r\nt there was still an edge of something\n&gt; in his voice: Concern? Fear? Anger=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; From outside Leo II followed by Wing Caliber and the Fuzors. With th=\r\ne battle\n&gt; over, they definitely looked tired. Two battles in the space of =\r\na day would\n&gt; definitely tax anyone&#39;s reserves.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
