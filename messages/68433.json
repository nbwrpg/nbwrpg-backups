A cecophony of thoughts\n&gt; and\n&gt; memories flooded his consciousness as he watched, the name Megatron\n&gt; floating amongst the wave. A constant litanty, part statement part\n&gt; question, &quot;Megatron, who is the true Megaton.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was as if somthing in his programing was attempting to emerge.  It\n&gt; reminded him of how he felt when he first emerged here, and that\n&gt; drive\n&gt; to find Megatron, but more pronounced. When he heard from Hydras in\n&gt; the\n&gt; begining he thought his duty was answered, and yet now perhaps there\n&gt; was doubt. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was as if there was something he was suppose to do or remember,\n&gt; but\n&gt; he could not . . . yet!\n&gt; \n&gt; With a shake of his head he cleared his thoughts as the image of\n&gt; Megatron faded. In frustration and a desire to cover his distraction\n&gt; he\n&gt; grunted and spoke over his radio, &quot;Hydras, you had better if get out\n&gt; here if you wish to resolve this as you had hoped!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dodging Trelos while hovering in vehicle mode was in no way easy. \n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; recieved signifigant scratches to his ventral heatshielding, but in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; few minutes it would be repaired.  In the meantime he transformed\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; focused his attention to Myrmidon.  A small panel on his chest\n&gt; opened\n&gt; &gt; and a communication holo emitter.  He made contact with Megatron\n&gt; via\n&gt; &gt; internal radio, and the image of the large and powerful Megatron X\n&gt; &gt; stood before Myrmidon.  Body very different, but his head and faced\n&gt; &gt; almost unchanged, save for a youthful countance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;*Hmm?  WHo are these creatures?  They look like slag in a slag\n&gt; heap.\n&gt; &gt;  Ah, I see now, they cower under that Hydras, huh?  Hmpt!  Pitiful\n&gt; &gt; excuses for Decepticons.  They can&#39;t conquer Prehistory Earth, what\n&gt; &gt; would make them suitable to follow me?*&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know, they talk an awful lot.  Maybe you should give thema\n&gt; &gt; chance?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;*YOU give them a second chance.
