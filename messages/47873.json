The ground appeared rocky \nand he doubted they had explosives to clear land (noone can tell me a \nlandscape I make one up).  He finally spotted a big enough clearing \nand set down about 6 miles from the base to the North East.  He \nopened his commlink.\n\nSunhawk:  I think I have something.

Should I stay here to help when you bring the equipment or \ncome back and get it myself.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I knew you were on board, and I just came to make sure you were \nok.
