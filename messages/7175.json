It seemed to be the \nmain thing he had to explain. &quot;I don&#39;t know where I came from.&quot; he replied. \n&quot;All I can remember is coming on-line to a barren place. I traveled until I \nfound somewhere I could make a home of. I was alone. I stayed that way for a \nlong time, until I found Quickstrike in my territory.&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure if he \nshould tell her he attacked him. &quot;He told me about the Predacons. I agreed \nto stay in my territory until he needed me. Now, I guess he needs me.&quot; He \nshook his head while in motion. &quot;Tell me, how did Quickstrike become second \nin command?&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
