He tries to remain calm and collected, actin=\r\ng like a sly Decepticon.  Inside he was nervous.  If they found out his tru=\r\ne faction he would clearly be done for.  His resemblence to Tucson&#39;s old fo=\r\nrm was impecable, yet the only thing that separated him from Tucson was his=\r\n black paint job and his accent.  He had been manufactured using the same s=\r\npecs and the same programming.  Hopefully his configurations would not be f=\r\nound out.\n\n&quot; What?  What&#39;reya lookn&#39; at me like that for?

Nope, not me, look, you guys can trust me, I&#39;m a Decepticon, I may not b=\r\ne able ta fly but I am one of you guys.  And thanks ta me ya now know that =\r\nTucson&#39;s got &#39;emself a hell of an upgrade.  No Autobot would give ya that k=\r\ninda info.&quot;\n\nHe transforms back into SUV mode.\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon, I got lots more inf=\r\no where that came from.  But I can&#39;t tell ya here.  We better get somewhere=\r\n private where I can give ya the entire scoop.&quot;\n\nAgain, his tires kick up d=\r\nust around Scorponok.\n\n&quot;My bad, my bad.
