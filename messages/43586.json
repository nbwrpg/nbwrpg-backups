Still, he looked like a pile of \njunk.  When Transmutate started to go offline he saw a light.  In this \nlight stood many transformers.  Unicron, Optimus Prime, many others \nwhose names have long been forgotten, others who have not yet gone \nonline.  They were all heros from 1 generation or another.  They all \nspoke the same simultanius sentence.\nSpirits: Transmutate. Your destiny has not been fulfilled.\nHe lacked the intellegence to know who they were or understand what \nthey meant, but still he did.  Suddenly, he was back in his body, but \nspead throughout the segmeants that had been blown apart.  He waited \nfor this destiny to come, but it failed.  His spark no longer had the \npower it once did, he had no power at all.  His body was useless to \nhim.\n\nIt is stormy (you wanted to incorparate the weather didn&#39;t you).  All \nof a sudden a lightening bolt hits his hand.  It comes to life and \nattaches to his arm.  It continues to assemble Transmutate. He starts \ntalking when it&#39;s finished.\n\nTransmutate: Friend....Sil-ver-bolt.....Ra-vage.\n\nHe gets a sad look.  Then he smiles stupidly.\n\nTransmutate:  Find.....Flllllllly.\n\nHe flys up in the air.\n\nOOC: Don&#39;t start complaining.  Transmutate was in one episonde of the \nseries.  He befriended Ravage and Silverbolt, but he hated fighting \nso much that when they started firing at each other he jumped in the \nway of the blast and cancelled it out.  He had enormous power, but no \nway to control it.  When ever he attacked someone his energy just flew \nout in all directions. He was so badly damaged his intellegence was \nbarley that of a drone (Rhinox confirmed this), and I have big plans \nfor him o.k. and a way to bring up his intellegence.\n\n\n"}}
