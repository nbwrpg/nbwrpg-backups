She made a mental not to ask \nGangon how he had been taken from his body in the first place.\nShe sighed as she then placed her hands behind her head and stretched her \nchest and sides, coming to walk up beside Prendabot.\nLooking up at the trees as they passed she kept her hands behind her head, \nrealizing that it was actually a fairly comfortable position. But then the \nthought came to her, this position showed off a bit more then just the \ncurves of her sides.\nShe then sighed again and lowered her arms to her sides, showing off one�s \ncurves was one thing, showing off the curves of those was another.\nBut then she began to go through a list of all the things she brought, \nmaking sure that she hadn�t forgotten anything.\nIt was obvious that she was doing no small deed, one that no Predacon of her \nunit had done before�at such a high risk. But then a bitter thought entered \nher mind, would Hell Beast even notice? Would he even care that she got very \nimportant info? Probably not�but she would see.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
