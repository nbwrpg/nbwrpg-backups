She knew she could read and project thoughts. \nBut she wondered if she could do anything else.  She looked around \nthe lab for a small object. The clipboard near Veratis would work. \nShe closed her eyes and saw the clipboard in her mind. Then she \nopenend her eyes and stared at the clipboard. She concentrated with \nall her strength. She tried to move the clipboard.  But it didn&#39;t \nmove. She tried again. It still didn&#39;t move. She sighed and wondered \nif she was trying to pick up something too heavy. She looked at a \nsheet of paper on the console. She closed her eyes and envisioned the \npaper in her mind. Then she opened her eyes and looked at the paper.  \nShe focused her mind and envisioned an invisible hand, reaching out \nfrom her mind and grabbing the paper. Then she envisioned the paper \nbeing lifted up off the console. The paper giggled a little, then \nlifted off the console an inch. She smiled, but in doing so, it broke \nher concentratin and the paper fell down onto the console, then slid \noff and onto the floor. &quot;Oh darn, almost had it too.&quot; she said loud, \nnot worrying if Veratis heard her or not.\n\n\n\n"}}
