She looked back at the flying Island and sighed.*\n\n&quot; I guess so, it has to be on that flying chunk of rock. That&#39;s where the \nsignatures that I&#39;m detecting are coming from.&quot;\n\n* She looked down at the ground but then back up at the Island, soon she \nwould have to leave Teltoli and go after Megatron.*\n\n\n*******************************************************\n\n* Dinobot dodged out of the way just as Scourge kicked at him, but there was \njust one problem...he hadn&#39;t dodged far enough!\nThe force of Scourge&#39;s kick forced him backwards and right into the Ark&#39;s \nshield, he felt a deadly surge of energy as he struck the defensive wall of \npower.\nDinobot dropped from the shield and landed on one knee, he hung his head as \nhis systems realined themselves. It only took nano-clicks and he was back on \nhis feet. He glared at Scourge and growled, without warning he lept forward \nwith his claws drawn and slashed down at the Predacon with a roar of rage!\nWith his rifle out of reach now Dinobot fought the best way he knew, \nhand-to-hand combat! His favorite.\nDinobot brought his other claw up and under into the bottom of Scourge&#39;s \njaw, now he would know what this &#39;lizard&#39; was capable of. And he would find \nout a lot more if he didn&#39;t surrender and go back to base.*\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
