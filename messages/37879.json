The bot was crazy! He had just given Slayer away to the Predacons. If they realized what was so plainly obvious, the Trainers had no hope.\n\n&quot;Fool! What in the pit are you talking about?&quot; he tries to recover the situation, firing back at Ignatius.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; shots of all strengths and types whuzzed past Ignatius as he flew for his life. The Predacon attackers had him outnumbered, outgunned, and outout of luck. various shots struck the Eagle in flight sending him into a tailspin. He transformed to bot mode turning, ready to fire at the pursuing bots. In the distance he saw the smoke as the Trainers base burned to the ground. He saw Slayer, even through the disguise he remembered him. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You called me a traitor then bring this upon our unit?&quot; The bot was alone, afraid, looking for someone to blame for the damage. &quot;You brought them here, you dropped the defences, you destroyed everything we had hoped to learn. He leapt in the air flapping his wings to push himself higher. The shots were hitting him hard but in his state of mind he could&#39;t have cared. He lifted his talons fireing 25  shots from his talons, and two missles from his left arm at the Trainer in disguise.\n\n\n"}}
