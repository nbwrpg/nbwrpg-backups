You&#39;re rig=\r\nht, I do need a few more hours in CR.  Quickstride, Legacy\n&gt; is your best b=\r\net for engineering purposes, he can help you with research,\n&gt; development a=\r\nnd construction.  What you&#39;re proposing seems a bit complex,\n&gt; and it&#39;s alw=\r\nays good to have someone else with you to collaborate with.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrid=\r\ne nods enthusiastically.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I was hoping ta have his support actually, w=\r\nell do.  There&#39;s a few things\n&gt; I need ta sort out as far as materials.. An=\r\nd of course design and\n&gt; functionability.  &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson smiles gently and t=\r\nhen turns to the little green mech.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I assure you that if you assist u=\r\ns in locating the escaped predicons, you\n&gt; will be granted immunity from en=\r\nemy forces.&quot;\n\n**OOC: I will let Kratlos respond here as soon he is able. **=\r\n\n\n&gt; He then turns to Leo Prime.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I have a feeling Hydras may take adva=\r\nntage of the situation and attempt\n&gt; another assault on this parameter.  Be=\r\n sure our boundaries are well guarded\n&gt; around the clock, and have everyone=\r\n take turns running guard duty.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a raised optic ridge as =\r\nTUSCON continued giving directives,\nbut he said nothing and just nodded gra=\r\nciously. LEO turned to look at\nthe Fuzors, =93That will be primarily your d=\r\nuties, security of the Ark.=94\n\nTORCA glanced over at TUSCON a curious look=\r\n on his face and then back\nat LEO PRIME.\n\n=93Do it Torca, we need to get th=\r\nis place secure. Coordinate with Legacy\nand Lord Elder here.=94 LOE gesture=\r\nd at the two mechs being discussed.\n=93I think they have been the primary g=\r\nuardians.=94\n\nLEGACY looked over at TORCA and QUICKSTRIDE, =93Of course. I =\r\nshould be\nof assistance to Quickstride=92s construction as well as base sec=\r\nurity.\nI will add all of you to the primary register at the close of this\nm=\r\neeting.=94\n\nOn the other side of LEGACY, LORD ELDER sat with his arms folde=\r\nd\nnodding appreciably. =93Of course Prime.=94 Elder said as he stood.\n\n&gt; &lt;O=\r\nLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nods as a signal that things were adjourned for the time being.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That pretty much covers everything, Leo Prime, thank you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He tri=\r\nes to get up from his seat and stumbles.  Quickstride catches him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wh=\r\noa, careful sir.  Leo, better call someone for transport to the CR\n&gt; chambe=\r\nrs, his balance is really messed up.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLEO didn=92t have to say anyt=\r\nhing as SANTON quickly stepped off the\nstage and moved quickly to TUSCON=92=\r\ns side. =93Don=92t worry, he said in his\ndeep and yet somehow comforting vo=\r\nice. =93We will get you to the CR\nchamber.=94\n\nHe looked up at LEO PRIME wh=\r\no just nodded back.\n\nSANTON smiled and slowly stood, allowing TUSCON to lea=\r\nn on him all he\nwanted. The medic was quite large and looked as if he could=\r\n carry\neasily TUSCON if needed.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What will be my duties sir?&quot;s=\r\naid windlord at Leo Prime who was standing in\n&gt; a corder of the room\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;=\r\n\n\nLEO PRIME looked at WINDLORD a small smile on his face as he came off\nthe=\r\n stage. =93Well you have wanted to make up for your time with Hydras\nright?=\r\n Tell me what you know of the Predacon. Perhaps there is\nsomething that you=\r\n learned that can help us.=94\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
