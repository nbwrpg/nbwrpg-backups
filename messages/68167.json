He was tall and well built, with a broad chest and long limbs. At the moment he held a swordlike blade in his hand, and dual mounted cannons of some type where mounted on his shoulders. \n\nNot looking back at the cameras or weapons that were locking on, the intruder continued to stare outside and the skyline above. \n\nThen with a slight but distinct popping noise, he vanished from all sight as a small breeze moved the air as it was displaced - the telltale signs of when someone is teleporting!\n\n********************************************\n\nPerceptor is easilly able to remove the device from Dark Rodimus&#39; neck, however it is still counting down!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
