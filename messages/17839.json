Duty calls.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure. See you around.&quot;\n\nThe two friends shook hands and Gotron blasted off. Starscream walked \nbeside KitKat.\n\n&quot;If you&#39;re thinking the Alliance was spying, maybe it was that \nBloodystrike, but not Gotron. He&#39;s a friend and wouldn&#39;t do anything \nto betray me. I actually think he may want to leave the Alliance and \njoin us.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon smiled evily.\n\n&quot;Good, at least we got one of them. I wish you had gotten the body \nthough. We could have used it. Never mind. Ramulus still awaits. But \nbefore we attack again, we must work on a new weapon. We have to \nfocus on something to disable those anti-chips. I&#39;ll have to refer to \nmy fathers research back on Cybertron.&quot; They all arrived at the base. \nPrebon gave orders.\n\n&quot;Everyone who needs a CR Chamber use it. I don&#39;t want any injured men \nright now.&quot; The Trainers walked in to the base and got into the CR \nChambers. Prebon was going to, but first he went to the cargo area, \nand opened a secret panel. Inside was a container, and inside tha was \nthe spark of Lightrade. Prebon whispered.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry old friend. I&#39;m going to get you that body.&quot;\n\nPrebon didn&#39;t fully trust Slayer, so he didn&#39;t want everyone in the \nCR&#39;s with him having full roam of the ship. He waited for Slayer to \nenter.\n\n(I really like Prebon&#39;s character. I&#39;m going to start writing a \nfanfic and upload it to this sites files section so that if I refer \nto anything from his past, you can all look it up and understand.)\n\n\n"}}
