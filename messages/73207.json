I am not really turning on you, it&#39;s an act that has to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\n played just right or else it will fail miserably.  I need your FULL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncooperation on this and trust what I am about to do, even though, it looks\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to trust.  Rodimus, Leo, I need you to fight me with everyt=\r\nhing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you got, and take heart, if I fall, I understand why, and anythi=\r\nng that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens to you, I apologize in advance.   We can do this, Max=\r\nimals, we can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be far better than Magmatron.  Now, time to put our pla=\r\nn into action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember...

It would seem that radios and comlinks\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwere still down here in the tunnels.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However LEO PRIME tunred to l=\r\nook at TUSCON, he nodded ever so slightly\n&gt; &gt; to try ant let TUSCON know th=\r\nat he understood what was going on.\n&gt; &gt; Evidently STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s words were=\r\n enough to give him a few clues as\n&gt; &gt; to what to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tuscon, you=\r\n are under arrest.
