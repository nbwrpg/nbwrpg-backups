Then, the huge wave came...\n\nMelchana stopped right there, her face obviously showing fear. She \nfell to her knees, unable to pronounce even a word.\n\nBelthassan&#39;s eyes opened wide. This could not be happening. There was \nno way such a thing could be!!!!\n\nDaemos suddenly came out of the parallel state he had been into since \nthe reformatting. He screamed like a possessed being. His shout \nresonated throughout the base.\n\nGesper&#39;s voice came on the speakers.\n\nBelthassan: ...yes! Of course we felt it! It... It... That cannot be \npossible! Such a power! It is impossible! Only something as vast as \nthe Matrix could unleash such thing!\n\nGesper: So what should we do?\n\nBelthassan: It seems this was done by Infecticons. They offer us the \nchance to join or die. I heard you were with the Autobots. Tell them \nabout this and then ask them about what they plan to do. Prophetus \nwould be needed in such a time of crisis, but you have to attend to \nother business.\n\nMelchana arrived in the Matrix chamber followed by Tankor:\nWho in the Matrix are these Infecticons anyways?\n\nDaemos:\nThey are worthy warriors, and dangerous players in this war...\n\nThey all turned to him. None of them had heard him enter.\n\nBelthassan:\nYou are finally awake, friend! How do you know them so well?\n\nDaemos: ....This... slumber... I was in... The Matrix retained me in \nthis state. It told me about them... As co-commander of the \nTripredacus, I order that we do not yield to this enemy. To do \notherwise would be heresy to our cause.\n\nBelthassan: DAEMOS! There is no reason for us to become their enemy! \nAs co-commander of this mission, I declare that this order is voided!\n\nDaemos: Fine then. I have no more choice than to declare myself \ncommander of the Tripredacus. Anyone who defies me will have to face \nme in a honor dual. I am sorry I have to do so, my friend, but if that \nis the only way to let the Matrix live on, then so be it.\n\nDaemos: Gesper, this is Daemos, your new and only commander. This is a \ndire time for the Matrix. Tell the Autobots about our cause and our \nreasons. They can help us.\n\n\n"}}
