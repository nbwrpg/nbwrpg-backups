The pain was sharp and it sent him back into a corner. \nTerminess screamed. But Vulois&#39; attention was not the matter at hand, \nbut Battera. After the last few weeks they had been together, they \nhad been good friends. Battera helped him escape from the Pred base \nonce. Now only hse escaped. He hopes she realizes she can never go \nback. Join up with Megatron, everyone knows he wants to betray Hell \nBeast, or go freelance, or join the Maximals if she doesn&#39;t want to \nhurt anyone. But she can never go back to Hell Beast. Now Vulois put \na plan to action.\n\n&quot;Hell Beast.....I don&#39;t know what Scourge heard, but all I was saying \nwas that our group needed to protect you from mutiny and keep the TM3 \nsafe, only the last one doesn&#39;t really matter now. I destroyed the \nbugs because you need to have more faith in us. You didn&#39;t even make \nus your second in commmands, like you promised. But I still have \nfaith that we can work this out, Hell Beast. In a sign of good faith, \nI will go quietly to the brig. Terminess, you too.&quot;\n\nVulois struggled to stand up. Once to his feet, he waited for the \nPreds to arrest him.\n\n\n"}}
