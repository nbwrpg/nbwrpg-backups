Her mind \nracing. &quot;One bot is a coincidence. Two bots is one bot too many.&quot;  \nShe ran , weaved, ducked and went through the forest as fast as she \ncould run.  She stopped a moment, put the rat down, transformed into \nmouse mode.  She picked up the rat by the scruff of the neck with her \nmouth.  She scurried along the forest floor staying under bush and \nfoliage cover.  Her intsincts told her to run and get away.  Her bot \nside told her to fight.  But with no other bot with her, running was \nher best option.  \n\n\n"}}
