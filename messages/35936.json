He fired both\n&gt; barrels at Pacifix hoping to clear a way for thier escape. Flames from\n&gt; Slag engulfed him from behind making him greatfull for his thick hide,\n&gt; the temperature was riseing and his missles were useless, if he were\n&gt; to arm one in that temperature it would explode before he could launch\n&gt; it. \n\n"}}
