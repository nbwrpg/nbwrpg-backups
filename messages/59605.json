She could see nothing, but thought she knew what was \ngoing \n&gt; on. Even the sound could not escape.\n&gt; \n&gt; When she let go, exhausted, she marvelled at what she had done.\n&gt; \n&gt; A small opening in the rocky soil, one that tunnelled some feet \ndeep \n&gt; in the ground, was now before her. All she had to do was to blow \nit \n&gt; up to get more space.\n&gt; \n&gt; She sent the fireball and was soon propelled backward as the \n&gt; explosion blew the rocks and dust up in the air.
