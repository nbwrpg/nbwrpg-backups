(Starstorm/Perceptor/Flicker \non their respective missions, Wolfenstein and Skulletron gone to the \ndark side, so to speak, and Phoenix captured.)  The only other people \nin the Pred base are Pumpskin and Vlad (still a prisoner).  The \nMaximals are involved in a somewhat testy alliance with the Rogues, \nmostly aimed at dealing with the newly beefed-up Tripred forces.  \nRodimus Prime and Nightlight have a new baby (hoo boy), other than \nthat it&#39;s business as usual (which is always unusual).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, aerosmith4e@a... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Alright finally i think...my comp is done being stupid with \nthe email i \n&gt; literally have a bizzilion emails yet to be read and personally \ndont wanna \n&gt; have to try and catch up someone please summarize whats going on at \nthe \n&gt; present time just consider all my past chars dead and gone im gonna \nmake some \n&gt; new ones and work myself back into the mix a bit.\n\n\n"}}
