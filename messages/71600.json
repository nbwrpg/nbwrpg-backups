It was a part of building integrity and wisdom, which Tucson bel=\r\nieved in most of all.  Without wisdom, how could one evolve into a respecte=\r\nd individual?  A look of shock and sheer annoyance floods his face.  Yet be=\r\nfore anything else he looks to Cyclonus and the others before addressing Ro=\r\ndimus.\n\n&quot; Excuse us for a moment.  Wait here, we&#39;ll be right back.&quot;\n\nWith t=\r\nhat he sharply turns to land quickly on the ground and does so on all fours=\r\n with a solid thud.  Ground debris dances beneath him due to the impact as =\r\nhe swiftly gets into robot mode , not waiting for Rodimus to dismount.  Nor=\r\nmally he would not have done so but it was clear he was less than impressed=\r\n with his comment.  He stands firmly with an angry expression on his facepl=\r\nate.\n\n&quot; I am not thrilled to be doing this myself but there are times when =\r\nwe ALL must do things we dislike doing.  I thought you might have enough in=\r\ntegrity to understand our situation.  Apparently I was wrong.  After everyt=\r\nhing I went through to bring you back safely, and THAT IS HOW YOU RETURN TH=\r\nE FAVOR!?   BY DIRESPECTING CYCLONUS YOU DISRESPECT ME! &quot;\n\nHe takes a momen=\r\nt to cool off his overheated temper. He replies to Wing Caliber in the mean=\r\n time.\n\n&quot; Of course, please retain a defense force at the Ark by all means.=\r\n &quot;\n\nHe turns back to Rodimus.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ll leave it up to you to decide what you=\r\n want to do.&quot;\n\nHis expression remains curt while with Rodimus.  \n\nMeanwhile=\r\n, Straight Shot&#39;s beacon begins to flash a little bit faster as Waspinator =\r\ncontinues his course.  \n\n&quot; That&#39;s it Waspinator!  You&#39;re on target!  Keep o=\r\nn a northward track, my signal is getting really strong now.  Scourge, be r=\r\neady with the sweeps!  It&#39;s only a matter of time before we reach our targe=\r\nt!&quot;\n\nBelow everyone, Night Shift now makes it into the forest and spots Was=\r\npinator with Straight Shot in tow.  Having got the memo, he follows them fr=\r\nom below.\n\n&quot; Hey, thought ya might need backup! &quot; \n\nStraight Shot picks up =\r\non Night Shift but also Elita.  \n\n&quot; WHAT THE PIT ARE YA DOING BRINGING ELIT=\r\nA INTO THIS!?  ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR PROCESSOR?!&quot; \n\nNight Shift replies sheep=\r\nishly.\n\n&quot;I know, I&#39;m in trouble.  But I couldn&#39;t leave her alone without pr=\r\notection. Besides, she has ta learn how ta take on a challenge at some poin=\r\nt, and now is a good a time as any ta start teaching her.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot s=\r\nighs and shrugs it off.  \n\n&quot; Okay if you say so.  Just don&#39;t let Rodimus fi=\r\nnd out.&quot;\n\nShe turns to Waspinator.\n\n&quot; Sorry about that, I had to reply to N=\r\nightshift.&quot;\n\nWith plans moving forward, everyone puts their minds on what n=\r\needs to be done.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 10,=\r\n 2011, at 6:21 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD=\r\n - Straight Shot & Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Straight Shot nods as she looks to Waspin=\r\nator and Scourge.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Copy that, Cyclonus.  Good idea, there may be a =\r\nneed for some backup.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we better get going.  Waspinator, I&#39;ll have =\r\nto be in alt mode for the\n&gt;&gt; mission, due to the fact that my sensors are m=\r\nore adept in cross bow form.\n&gt;&gt; I will calibrate to your physical specs so =\r\nthat way I&#39;m easier to work with\n&gt;&gt; and lighter on your arms.  I have a las=\r\ner beacon on the end of the launch\n&gt;&gt; bed.  When that flashes, it&#39;s locked =\r\nonto something.  The faster it flashes\n&gt;&gt; the closer we are.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; She tr=\r\nansforms into alt mode and lands into Waspinator&#39;s hands, surprisingly\n&gt;&gt; w=\r\neighing very little as she calibrates herself to fit his hands.  The beacon=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; begins to flash slowly, pointing north.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; WASPINATOR caug=\r\nht STRAIGHT SHOT awkwardly, being that he was flying\n&gt; around with everyone=\r\n in insect mode, but with two spindly legs he held\n&gt; on to her and flew aro=\r\nund. &quot;What is it that arrow bot has locked on\n&gt; to?&quot; WASPINATOR said curiou=\r\nsly as he tried to orient the weapon. &quot;I\n&gt; don&#39;t see anything?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He tri=\r\ned to look more carefully, his big insect eyes glittering as he tried.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Meanwhile SCOURGE and his sweeps surrounded WASPINATOR as they began\n&gt; to =\r\nfly in the direction that the Dinosaurs had come.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Tucson acknowledges Leo Prime with a calm look on his face.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Of =\r\ncourse, Leo Prime.  I will be careful.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot; I think it&#39;s best that you and Cyclonus work together, since you seem to\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; be on the same wavelength.  Cyclonus, see what you two can come up with =\r\nas\n&gt;&gt; far as gathering intel.  If you wouldn&#39;t mind, we would highly benefi=\r\nt from\n&gt;&gt; the help of the Seekers. They can move far faster than I can.  An=\r\nd at this\n&gt;&gt; moment we are severely pressed for time.&quot; Intel is going to be=\r\n the most\n&gt;&gt; important aspect of how our strategy plays out. Without it, we=\r\n really can\n&gt;&gt; not plan anything further.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; He looks out at the risin=\r\ng smoke and grimaces at the acrid smell of burning\n&gt;&gt; flesh.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Talon=\r\n, Hydras, I suggest we meet Leo Prime on the ground and hear what he\n&gt;&gt; may=\r\n suggest we do next.  Remember, unity is our best weapon now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Unity? With them?&quot; RODIMUS grunted. He was still sitting on TUSCON&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n back as he  looked over at CYCLONUS as CYCLONUS hovered in his robot\n&gt; mod=\r\ne looking back, neither seemed to like the idea of working\n&gt; together. &quot;I h=\r\nave to work with him, and you with Hydras, Primus help\n&gt; us.&quot; RODIMUS whisp=\r\nered to TUSCON, &quot;Maybe we should have just shot at\n&gt; them when we had the c=\r\nhance.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TUSCON get&#39;s a call from WING CALIBER, LEO PRIME&#39;s tactical as=\r\nsistant\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps it is not the best idea to pull all the Maximals from th=\r\ne\n&gt; Ark. Remember there are still escaped criminals about, and we cannot\n&gt; =\r\nforget Unicron&#39;s minions still here too. We cannot leave the Ark\n&gt; undefend=\r\ned.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras & Talon&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hydras Hissed annoyed by the idea =\r\nto have a meeting with more maximal, but\n&gt;&gt; the situation requires to do so=\r\nme stuff, he followed Tucson and he said to\n&gt;&gt; the Maximal dragon=E2=80=9CW=\r\nhat do you bet that before we realize Rodimus and\n&gt;&gt; Cyclonus will in the o=\r\nther=E2=80=99s neck?

It was the vo=\r\nice of a trained state&#39;s man a politician who had\n&gt; learned the art of war,=\r\n a dangerous combination indeed - for friend\n&gt; and foe alike.\n&gt; \n&gt; He gave =\r\nTUSCON and RODIMUS a disdainful look but said nothing except\n&gt; to HYDRAS.  =\r\n&quot;I and my Fuzors are yours to command.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
