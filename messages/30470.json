He sighs. If he \nwas going to rescue his employer it would have to be quick. Running \nto the bush wouldn&#39;t be a good idea, so he would use his vehicle mode \nif it came to that.\n\nHe watches the scene without acting yet, though. If Megatron got more \nbeat up, he would interfere.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStratus watches curiously, not really understanding what was going on.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Motormaster jumps back from the lock of weapons, and swings his \nsword wide\n&gt; in and ark towards Megatron. Megatron is not able to get his mace \nup in\n&gt; time, and receives the blade, as it plunges into his neck. A \ngrinding of\n&gt; Metal against Metal can be heard, and Motormaster strains, his arms \nheating\n&gt; up from the amount of energy used, to try to finish the stroke \ncleanly,\n&gt; through Megatron&#39;s head.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sword opens a small wound, and as oil starts to produce, it \ncontinues.\n&gt; Megatron finally brings the mace, in a wide swing, and hits \nMotormaster\n&gt; head on, the impact sending the Stunticon leader into the star \nship, and\n&gt; the small part caves in. Megatron replaces his mace with his hand \nagain,\n&gt; and steps forward. &quot;Give it up Motormaster.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For a moment there is silence, then the ruble comes to life, and\n&gt; Motormaster lunges out of it, bringing fist after fist into \nMegatrons\n&gt; chest. The Slagmaker doubles back from the pain, and tries to put \nhis hands\n&gt; up, but Motormaster puts his fists together, and rocks Megatron \nwith an Axe\n&gt; like blow across the jaw, then again across the jaw, in an upward \nstroke,\n&gt; sending Megatron back several 100 feet, and into the foilage. \nMotormaster\n&gt; transforms, and follows his would be fake leader.\n\n\n"}}
