The \nstructure integrety of a Deflector Shield is tricky. Enough damage to \nit at four spots will render it pretty much useless. Those spots are \ndirectly to the bow, stern, port, and starboard(right word?) sides to \nthe ship.\n\nOOC: I&#39;m taking these mechanics of shields from Star Trek, if someone \nthinks they shouldn&#39;t imply here, tell me.\n\n\n"}}
