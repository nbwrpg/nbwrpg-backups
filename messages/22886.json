I keep saying that I&#39;m \n&gt; coming back, and than I don&#39;t. It&#39;s not fair too all of you. So \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; decided to take a *temperary* leave of the club. Meaning I could \ncome \n&gt; back, but probably not, and if I did it wouldn&#39;t be till February \nor \n&gt; March. I&#39;m giving The Trainers to Cyberwolf. The two chars I did \n&gt; bring in, I&#39;ll svae them till when and if I come back. Please don&#39;t \n&gt; take me off the list. I plan on stopping by once a month to give \nyou \n&gt; an update on my personnal problems, catch up on things, and tell \nyou \n&gt; how close I am till returning. Well, this is goodbye. Thank You \nall. \n&gt; I will miss you very much, even those who I have gotten into \n&gt; arguements with. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Hawnaka\n&gt; (spelling?), Happy Kwaanza, happy New Years&#39;s, Happy Valentine&#39;s \nDay, \n&gt; Happy Easter, Happy Yom Kipur, and all those other holidays. Until \nwe \n&gt; all meet again in that great big Cybertron in the sky, goodbye.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your  friend, Mike Smith(You may think that&#39;s a phony name, but it \n&gt; ain&#39;t! The Frank Reinhart thing is just my e-mail name.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. Sunday&#39;s my birthday, if you&#39;d like to know.\n\n\n"}}
