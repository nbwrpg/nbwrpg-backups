This fembot before her wondering what her position in HER army was? HER army? Since when was the Maximal force completely hers? She knew that she was one of those whom looked after the well being of the Maximals troops but she never even thought that they would ever be hers�she even doubted that they even liked her.\nThe thought was new and she was even a bit flattered by the image of her as a leader in other�s optics but she doubted that they liked her and the thought was banished.\nIron Raptor shrugged as she then worked her hand in a bit tighter with Prowl�s. *\n\n� I have no idea, I�m not commander so I don�t know what you position is. Besides, I thought that you were the enemy now?�\n\n*But then her attention turned towards Prowl as she then felt his arm go slack as he had fallen, her optics full of concern as she watched him raise to his feet. She then braced herself as he used her for support, then bringing a hand around him to steady him further but with enough care that it would not hurt him too much. The feel of his ribs against her arm made her want to something that would take the pain away, something that could comfort him into forgetting about the pain. The look on her face was that of love but enough concern that it pained her just as much as his ribs did him, she so wanted to just take the pain away�but she couldn�t.\nBut with the explosion behind them she then moved off towards the base but at a pace that Prowl could easily keep up with, a small smile on her face to lighten the mood as a small comment formed in her mind. *\n\n� I have something that�ll take the thought of pain right out of you mind, but I don�t think that you can�t handle it right now.�\n\n* With that she looked over at him with a sly look on her face, she DID have something that could take the pain right out of his mind but this wasn�t the time or the place for something like that. A small chuckle escaped her throat as they neared the doors of the Ark, though not sure if he was in the mood for a small pun.\nWith the end of the chuckle she then came up to the doors and watched them open, then moving into the base with Prowl in toe. The CR chambers came into sight and she sighed; now they could relax and repair. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
