The scanners rotated, and when \nthe hatch opened, a black horse with errie yellow eyes stepped out. She was \nWildfire. On Cybertron, she was a phychic and a criminal. She knew from the \ninstant she arose, she was different. He abilities and her realization of \nthem came back to her quickly.\n\nShe tossed her head, flicking her wooly mane with it. She made a sound that \nresembled a squeek, putting her beast mode and her mind together.\n\nA horse she imaged in her mind. Herself. The forest and herself, filled with \nsounds. Filled with other minds. She could hear them and feel them. Somehow \nshe could feel other minds like hers within the ambient. She had to find \nthem, perhaps find some bots that had her mind reasoning of Predacon.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
