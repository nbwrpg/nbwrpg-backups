He has only been here for a \nshort time, but he has seen the leadership that Hell beast has \ndisplayed, or lack of.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s time for a new leader. And if what I think is up here, than we \nwon&#39;t just have a new leader, we will have a new breed!&quot;\n\nVulois flys up into a cave in the mountain and sees a huge pile of \nrocks. He starts uncovering them, when a huge Mountain Goat appears \nfrom behind him and trys to Ram him. Vulois blasts him before he has \na chance.\n\n&quot;Dumb sheep....&quot;\n\nHe continues to pull away at the Rocks, and he finds what he&#39;s \nlooking for.\n\n&quot;If I&#39;m right, this ball is a Transmetal 3 Driver! But how did it get \nhere?&quot;\n\nVulois touches it, and it shows him the mystery. It is back in the \nBeast Wars. Megatron is laughing. He has just used his Transmetal 2 \ndriver to create a new Dino-Bot. But what&#39;s this? Someone is leaping \ninto the beam. It&#39;s Cheetor! He jumps right into it and swats the \ndriver away. But he is being filled with all this energy. It is doing \nsomething to his body. Now he seems to be choking on something. He&#39;s\ncoughing up a Driver! This must be this one. the energy has enhanced \nit, and it&#39;s being flung towards this mountain. It hits the wall and \nall the rocks fall on it. The image ends.\n\nVulois is amazed. This can be the turning point in the battle. But he \ndoesn&#39;t know how to use it. He needs someone with brains. He sends a \nsecret message to all Predacons except Hell Beats.\n\n&quot;To any predacon who is good with electronics and dislikes Hell \nBeast&#39;s leadership, come home in on my signal. We have business to \ndiscust that may change the face of the Neo Beast Wars!&quot;\n\nVulois sits with the driver and waits for an answer.\n\n\n"}}
