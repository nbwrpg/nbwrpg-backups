But that \nwould seem impossible as we were all transported here.  Quake, Apeface. \n  You two go will man the search party for Slugslinger.  Keep in touch \nwith me on your progress.  Nightmare, get these men into CR.  Scrapper, \nLong Haul, you help.  Mixmaster and scavenger, report to Hook.  &quot; \nHavotron looked around for a second, obviously confused.  &quot;DARKWING, \nDREADWIND, WHERE IN THE DARKENED PIT ARE YOU TWO!!&quot;\n\nA couple seconds later two bots stumble out of a small storage \ncompartment.  &quot;Sorry boss.  This muffler couldn&#39;t stand the shaking and \ndragged me in there.  What you want&quot; Dreadwind answered.\n\n&quot;As you two combined create the fastest jet we have, you will search out \nand find the Autobot ship and where it is located.&quot; Havotron ordered.\n\n&quot;You mean I have to carry him around?&quot; Dreadwind retorted.\n\n&quot;Go...&quot; was the simple reply, but it was the stare that scared the two \nof them out of the ship.  They transformed into their jets and joined \ntogether.  The two blasted off heading East.\n\nrdahl@... wrote:\n\n&gt; The caw of gulls emerged through a cloud, then cut off, as the roar of\n&gt; firey engines of power cut throught the air. After a while, all was\n&gt; silent again, and the peaceful birds continued to chirp. Through the\n&gt; clouds a large metalic form with smoke rising up lay grounded. On closer\n&gt; inspection a robot lay dangling out the side. Then another large black\n&gt; one hoisted him up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the ship he turned around, his younger brother, Jagged, over his\n&gt; shoulder, as he looked to Havotron. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; his ominous voice drifted\n&gt; out of his vocals. He did the normal military stance. &quot;Unit Quake\n&gt; totally functional.&quot; he said nodding to Quake. &quot;Unit Jagged in need of\n&gt; repairs. Unit Needlenose in stasis lock, Unit Apeface, half up, unit\n&gt; Spinister, uknown.&quot; he said, nodding towards Spinister, who lay beneath\n&gt; wreckage, but not moving. &quot;Unit Slugslinger out of sight, he was not\n&gt; inside the ship during the crash. He may however be outside.&quot; he\n&gt; whispered. &quot;Jagged and I will need to adopt forms from this planet.&quot; he\n&gt; informed his higher officer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spasma leapt down towards his partner Apeface, and opened up a panel to\n&gt; the chest. He realined a few circuits, then Apeface&#39;s body transformed\n&gt; to his gorilla mode. &quot;uhhhhhhh.&quot; he grunted, as Spasma looked up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He will be alright, and his wounds will heal normally.&quot; the Nebulan\n&gt; Scientist informed Havotron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hook stood up, still clutching his shoulder, and patted Scrapper on the\n&gt; back. Another job well done, at least for this rable crew. Hook walked\n&gt; towards the gaping hole of the ship, and took a step off, leaving the\n&gt; security of solid ground, to wich he slowly fell a few feet, before\n&gt; hovering in mid air. He floated all the way to the top of the ship, and\n&gt; looked it over. He would need Scavanger&#39;s abilities to better asses the\n&gt; dammage he thought. &quot;Scavanger, Mixmaster, joing me outside.&quot; he called.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
