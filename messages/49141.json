Controlling proto-humans isnt going to\n&gt; happen. The council will \n&gt; not put extremely important NPCs into the hands of\n&gt; players. In BW the \n&gt; Maximals interacted very little with the humans and\n&gt; thus that should be \n&gt; respected and shown in here. The protohumans would\n&gt; also get crushed in combat \n&gt; with TFs they lack the know how to do so. While\n&gt; controling humans persay \n&gt; isn&#39;t a bad idea, it still isn&#39;t that good of one\n&gt; especially when you are \n&gt; talking about human ancestors. After all you have to\n&gt; look at this from a \n&gt; logical point of view, just how many transformers\n&gt; are going to be attracted \n&gt; to primitive earth. We&#39;ve had 5 or 6 factions\n&gt; already crashland onto the \n&gt; planet, that in itself defys some rational thought.\n&gt; Yes back stories are good \n&gt; for them but sometimes its just enough. The RPG\n&gt; really doesn&#39;t need any \n&gt; wholey new factions to get it running again. It just\n&gt; needs a spark, an \n&gt; element of chaos if you will. So far everything that\n&gt; has appeared and \n&gt; happened has been pretty much voted on by the\n&gt; players, that just makes it \n&gt; boring. Once in a while something needs to happen\n&gt; that the players no nothing \n&gt; about. Better RPing skills are built that way. As\n&gt; for the quintesson \n&gt; question, they were always around as far as the\n&gt; fandom know. They made the \n&gt; transformers and in the continuity as far as my\n&gt; knowledge goes the gobots \n&gt; were never recognized, although it is possible that\n&gt; they were or could have \n&gt; been since in Five Faces of Darkness it begins with\n&gt; a galactic olympics, \n&gt; however they were also not able to identify one of\n&gt; the attackers that got \n&gt; caught so it also shows that at the time not\n&gt; everything was known. Anyway \n&gt; thats my 2 cents for now. Flame me if you want but\n&gt; this has been my unbiased \n&gt; opinion.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
