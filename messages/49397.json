The most notable occasion was in \nComing of \n&gt; the fuzors pt. 2 in which the Maximals all ran out of ammo against \nthe \n&gt; Predacons. And event hen they were shooting 40 blasts at a time, at \nthe most \n&gt; Rattrap fire 3 shots at a time and at the most dinobot fired 2 \nblasts at a \n&gt; time. This is a real simulated war and thus charachters would run \nout of \n&gt; ammo, denying this fact makes no sense whatsoever. Its like \nfighting an army \n&gt; with a six shooter and saying it has unlimited ammo.\n\n\n"}}
