As Spasstik\nleapt towards him, Rumble pushed his dented frame, into the air, and\ncompacted transforming into cassette mode. Soundwave&#39;s door opened, and\nreceived the cassette. Spasstik then began to bound away from the danger\narea, to bring his comerades with him (Soundwave still in his mouth),\nstarting to head away from the base.\n\n"}}
