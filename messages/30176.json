If so, from what?)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DNA is in all organics, Everything about them contains DNA, skin, hair,\n&gt; blood, organs ect.\n&gt;\n&gt; It can be obtained from natural animals or transformers with beast modes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lady Hawk was sent by her father Veratis to obtain samples to experiment\non.\n&gt;\n&gt; Transformers have DNA encoded on thier beast modes to blend in with the\n&gt; world around them. It gives them certain atributes of these creatures,\n(Meat\n&gt; eaters still eat meat, plant eaters still eat plants.Same could be said\nfor\n&gt; thier strengths and weaknesses.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Optimus Prime said he would leave till the day when all was one. Veratis\n&gt; believes that this means combining DNA along with Maximal and Predacon\nforms\n&gt; to create one type of being. Once that happens he believes that Prime will\n&gt; return to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lady Hawk has been given the assignment to create some warriors that\n&gt; transform into creatures similar to the movie &quot;Aliens.&quot; She wants to use\n&gt; this opportunity to test her fathers theory and combine Earth DNA with\nthese\n&gt; creatures to improve them.\n&gt;\n&gt; any more questions?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
