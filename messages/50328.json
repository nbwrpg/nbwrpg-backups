You are\n&gt; strong. However, being \n&gt; a Clansman... err... Clansbot in your case, that is\n&gt; more than \n&gt; techniques. It is a lot of training, and probably a\n&gt; major change of \n&gt; minds. We Clans value zellbringen, single combat.\n&gt; Even in a melee, we \n&gt; tend to engage no more than one enemy at the time.\n&gt; Also, honor is \n&gt; above everything else in every aspect of our life...\n&gt; except maybe \n&gt; politics, but that is easily answered through\n&gt; combat.

You do have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wolf&#39;s soul and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bear&#39;s strenght. You have bested me in this\n&gt; contest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We will work as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; part of the Maximals as of now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar&#39;s towering form came next to her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ragnar: You are a powerful warrior, Owlhawk, and\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have been thinking. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that you could serve the Maximals even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better if we steep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you in the ways of the Clans. If Katya does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agree, I will be your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trainer.
