She then suggested they wait and continue to share this moment, and joked that they might have a search party sent after them.  An amusing idea.  But if there was a search party people would worry needlessly, and he didn&#39;t want to mess with it.\n \n&quot;I suppose we better get going,&quot; he said, with a kiss to her faceplates and a smirk of his own.  &quot;We have time to cuddle after we&#39;re done.&quot;\n \nHe stands up and and sets her on her feet, but lets his hands travel up her sides and arms.
