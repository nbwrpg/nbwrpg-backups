Fenox, it seemed, was either ignoring his call completely or simply had exited before he had had the chance to relocate himself to this position. But the outcome was the same for both: Vlad was left on his own to explore an alien landscape.  Excellent!   Shesta&#39;s ears pricked in the direction of the front of the Iron Fist, causing Vlad to take interest in discovering whatever it was she was detecting. In yet, before he could scann to relieve his mind of wanders, the she-dog sprang towards the exit.   Sighing to himself, he followed as quickly as he could through halls, only catching glimpses of the very tip of her tail rounding a corner at times.** &quot; Shesta! Get back here!&quot; ** His voice echoed slightly along the surface of the walls, however, unable to reach the ears of his companion. Vlad cursed to himself before rounding a bend in the wall and suddenly seeing Shesta.  She was running towards two transformers who had just entered the Iron Fist, one female and the other male.( Antagony + Perndabot ) Wagging her tail she approached the fembot, nose out and whiskers erect. Taking any scent that could be caught.  Vlad also approached, yet, with less enthusiasm.** &quot; Shesta!&quot; ** His voice was firm and solid as he approached the hound, taking her by the scruff of the neck and pulling her back, though no harm came to the dog. And without looking at the person his pet had come to, he spoke flatly.** &quot; Excuse me.&quot;\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Free Anime Email, News, Links, Forums and Shopping at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
