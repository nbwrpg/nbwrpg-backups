But you&#39;re gunna have\none hell of a time trying.\nAlso, Yan&#39;s drawing is very good. I think it looks cute, in a fluffy kitten\nsort of way.\nWhy, it&#39;s around the same level of goodness as my own.\n\n\n* Iron Raptor was keeping a close eye in Nemisis while she still kept her\nattention on Scattershot, suddenly snapping her head towards Nemisis as he\npowered up his bosters and made his clumsy get away.\nSimply standing there and not even bothering to waste the energy it might\ntake to either chase him down or to use what was left in the sword.\nIron Raptor let the blade of the sword rest against the ground where Nemisis\nhad been only moments before, sighing and shaking her head.\nShe really didn&#39;t want his fluid on her blade anyway, she would rather have\nsoneone else kill him. But if it ever came down to it, she would take his\nlife.\nIron Raptor looked over her shoulder as Scattershot spoke, turning towards\nhim a bit as he finished his words.\nShe still had HIM to take care of!\nHer eyes widened as she hard him yell, jumping a bit out of the way as the\nexplosive charges landed a bit in front of her, but not before a few shruck\nher in the shoulders and chest.\nA bit of armor flew away from those places before she stumbled back,\ngritting her teeth as mech-fluid flowed from the new wounds.\nGlaring at Scattershot she tightened her hold on the handle of the sword.*\n\n&quot; Just what are you bots doing here anyway? Just felt like causing pain and\ntrouble?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor hefted her sword and the blade glew a little, but she knew\nthat she used up most of her energy in the last blast.\nNow she just had enough for Scattershot if it came down to it.\nBut she really didn&#39;t care aboy beating him to a pulp right now, all she\nwanted was for the battle to end so they could all relax.\nThough, there wasn&#39;t much chance of that!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
