But all she had \nreally come for was her meal, and she still had a boar to finish off a mile \nand a bit north from their current location.\nCarnage watched the two fight with lessening amusement until she finally \nshrugged and converted back into beast mode, walking over to the fallen sow \nand standing over the bloodied carcass.\nBy now the sow had bled to death instead of letting her finish it off \nquickly, it was rather an unintended ending. But it couldn�t be helped now.\nCarnage turned her head and looked over at the two fighting bots, wondering \nif she really should stay, but decided that she didn�t have to.\nBesides, those two weren�t fighting for any real reason, just because \ntempers were running high and they were taking it out on each other.\nCarnage looked at Teltoli with a blank expression on her face. **\n� You can stay here and fight meaninglessly if you want, but I have what I \ncame here for. And I�m leaving.�\n\n** Carnage simply then turned away from the two, bent down and picked up her \nkill in her jaws, finding it rather heavy but manageable.\nThe sow was large and she had to carry a bit of it in her scaled arms as she \nwalked away and into the shadows of the forest, heading off in the direction \nof the distant squeals of the boar. **\n� I�m coming!�\n\n** She said with her mouth full, stopping when she came across the headless \npiglet. Wondering if she would be able to pick it up and, somehow, not lose \nthe sow onto the ground at the same time.\nCarnage finally decided that she would leave it there, maybe come back for \nit once she had the boar killed and the sow nestled safely beside it.\nThere was no point in wasting fresh meat.\nSo, she continued on her way deeper into the forest and towards the giant \ntrees, where the boar lay in pain at one tree roots. But his pain would be \nover soon.\n: The only thing I like to let suffer is a bot.: Carnage thought to herself \nas she went on her way.\nThen wondering if she should really let Teltoli take care of Instrat on her \nown. But with the way things were going, Teltoli could take care of herself.\nBesides, Carnage had grown a taste for being alone. It was usual now. And \nshe didn�t like being around bots for too long anymore. Eventually it would \nlead to wounds, maybe even death. And even though she thought that death \nwouldn�t bee all that bad, she didn�t want to meet the Pit just yet. **\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
