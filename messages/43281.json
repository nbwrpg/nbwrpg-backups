He transformed to\n&gt; Wolverine and shot out the door in a blur.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bullet saw the mutant comeing out and tried to get in the way. A\n&gt; terrible collision followed which left both bots slideing across the\n&gt; floor of the Black Fortress. Bullet forced himself to his feet, his\n&gt; temper flared. The former Trainer transformed to bull mode, stomped\n&gt; his hoof and readied himself to charge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Standing opposite the bull the Wolverine growled ready for a fight\n&gt; but the sound of a comm echoed through both systems ending the\n&gt; confrontation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Remember my favor.&quot; Blazes voice called through the comm getting\n&gt; Bullets attention. &quot;We&#39;re near the confrence rooms Silver Scout with\n&gt; me and we&#39;re getting ready for a suicide assault against where\n&gt; they&#39;re holding Foxfingers, you two interested?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The silence didn&#39;t last long as both the bull and the Wolverine\n&gt; agreed that a suicide mission sounded almost fun.\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: CYBERWOLF4\n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y...\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 1:40 AM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: others\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Blaze and Silver Scout continued wandering back toward Shivahs\n&gt; location when Silver Scout picked up a scent. &quot;Foxfingers?&quot; the scent\n&gt; was strong, like he was close. &quot;Kit Kat and Drillbit were with him,\n&gt; he&#39;s in trouble.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   The tigress travelling with the wolf transformed to get a better\n&gt; whif of what the mutant was smelling. &quot;He&#39;s caught, there&#39;s nothing\n&gt; we can do.&quot; she had given up hope of escape. By now her computer\n&gt; access was probably cut off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;We have to save him, I owe my creator that much.&quot; the wolf\n&gt; started off in the direction but was quickly stopped.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;Then fine, you won&#39;t die alone.&quot; Even without her computer\n&gt; access she could still help, if she couldn&#39;t hack the computer then\n&gt; she wasn&#39;t worth the function her motherboard was printed on. &quot;I&#39;ll\n&gt; see what I can do.&quot; the tigress transformed back to her bot mode. The\n&gt; virus was taking effect eact time she transformed back she could feel\n&gt; it impedeing her transformation. Quickly accessing a computer\n&gt; terminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still\n&gt; trapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around here.&quot;\n&gt; soon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
