Carnage walked up beside Cyber \nClaw and pointer towards the Maximal Base.*\n\n&quot; Come on, we&#39;re basically being invited in. Let&#39;s now spurn this \nopportunity, shall we?&quot;\n\n* Carnage then began to head for the Ark, hoping that Cyber Claw would \nfollow. It was then that she saw another raptor-bot almost transform into \nsome kind of mondo creature and head for one of the attackers, she then \nbegan to move even quicker towards the Maximal base. She shouted over her \nshoulder and over the explosions to Cyber Claw...*\n\n&quot; Well? Let&#39;s get our tails outta here!&quot;\n\n****************************************************************\n\n* Dinobot looked at the mech-fluid dripping from his clawed figures but then \nshook his head, he had heard the raging of battle begin on the other side of \nthe ship as well and knew that he just couldn&#39;t go run and hide now.\nHe looked off towards the base and put a mech-fluid covered hand over his \nrifle, he then picked it up and slowly got to his feet.\nThe fluid still dripped from his lips and it seemed that it wouldn&#39;t be \nstopping any time soon, but that fact wasn&#39;t what bothered him. It was how \nmany more shots he could take before his spark had to find another body to \ncarry it.\nDinobot checked the cartridge of the rifle, there were enough charges left \nin it for another few rounds before he had to reload.\nHe looked at Tavatron and knew that she was worried about him, but he also \nknew that she wasn&#39;t going to be happy about what he was about to do next.\nDinobot turned away as yet another wave of mech-fluid almost seemed to spill \nfrom his mouth but battle called and he didn&#39;t care, he was a warrior and a \nwarrior fought to the bitter-sweet end!\nHe wiped his hand across his mouth to clean the mech-fluid from it but even \nthat was no good as new just replaced the old, the pain in his stomach was \nalmost unbearable now but the call of battle was much stronger.\nBut he knew that he had to watch it, it was this sort of determination that \nhad gotten himself killed the first time. He had nothing to regret from his \nactions years ago but now he knew to watch what he did less he wind up in a \nsituation like that again.\nDinobot looked back towards Tavatron then back at the base, he hefted his \nrifle in his hands...*\n\n&quot; No, there is a battle to be fought. And I for one am not going to stand \nidle as the enemy advances.&quot;\n\n* With those last words Dinobot then began to move off towards the battle \nfield, he was a warrior and he would not turn his back to his destiny. Even \nif it meant total obliteration!*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
