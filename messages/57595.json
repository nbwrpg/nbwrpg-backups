You see, we Tripredacus \nare\n&gt; descended from a different lineage than Maximals and Predacons. \nEven\n&gt; before the great wars, we left Cybertron, not without looking at \nit,\n&gt; mind you, but to develop elsewhere. We thrived, but we desired the\n&gt; power to rule Cybertron and show what has always been... But that \nis\n&gt; not for me to tell you.\n&gt; \n&gt; He swung swiftly to his left where Hydras stood and sent a series \nof\n&gt; spears at his nemesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyrael: Do you mind?

No Decepticon was ever a slave. Too \nstubborn and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; violent to be one, and way too deceptive. But you will never \nbe the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power you once were. Clinging to that fading dream is futile \nand vain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It wastes your efforts. Whatever plan Alpha Trion had for you, \nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might not be one that includes giving you commands. You play \nthe part\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he has given you, just as I am playing a part given to me by my\n&gt; ancestors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He raises a hand and unleashes a massive surge of coherent \nlight at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maxima.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Falling to her weakened knees. This was becoming more than she \ncould\n&gt; bear. \n&gt; &gt; Feeling the pain shooting through her. She would not use whatever\n&gt; powers may \n&gt; &gt; have been given to her. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She glared up at Tyrael. &quot;If you know so much about me, & what \nAlpha\n&gt; Trion \n&gt; &gt; wishes of me, why do I not know?!&quot; she spat. &quot;Besides... I am \none of\n&gt; your bloody \n&gt; &gt; damn ancestors!&quot; she cringed. She was no direct foremother of \nhis, but \n&gt; &gt; surely, the vast majority of these bots & cons she was much \nolder,\n&gt; though easy \n&gt; &gt; enough for her to change & grow & adjust. Though at times, she\n&gt; didn&#39;t like it or \n&gt; &gt; hesitated. She changed nonetheless. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She grabbed more strength. She wanted to show she was stronger \nthan\n&gt; any had \n&gt; &gt; thought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Struggling, she finally came to her feet again. \nPanting, &quot;Eeehhh...\n&gt; Tyrael. \n&gt; &gt; Again, Alpha Trion does NOT govern my future, just as he did not\n&gt; govern my \n&gt; &gt; past. He was an Autobot. I am a Decepticon.&quot; An evil grin \nappeared\n&gt; upon her face \n&gt; &gt; as her crimson optics glowed. &quot;Actually, I truly enjoyed \ntorturing\n&gt; him often... \n&gt; &gt; even with the demise of Elita-1. Oh, the pain from both Optimus\n&gt; Prime & Alpha \n&gt; &gt; Trion was priceless.&quot; she purred wickedly.\n\n\n"}}
