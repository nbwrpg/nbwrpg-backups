Well, that&#39;s one way of looking at it.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Now you need expose your spark, and then tap into her own spark \nsignature to expose it as well.\nA Transmetal 2 spark is much more powerful then hers, despite the beast \nmodes.\nAnyway, after that simply release the code 34-9 from your spark reconductory \ncode. Which, in face, is a code which is made to make sure that your spark \ndoes NOT merge with anothers. As well, believe it or not, should have mede \nsure that you never breed.&quot;\n\n* And just as Iris did sometimes, she continued on relaying information on a \nsubject that had almost nothing to do with what was going on at the moment.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; And the reason that most Transmetal 2s have that code so that they \ncan&#39;t breed is mainly because the Transmetal 2 technology is unstable to \nbegin with.\nAlso because most TM2, which Dinobot is the only one I&#39;ve seen with this \nparticular trait,  are fused with ultra-aggressive tendencies.\nAnd that code&#39;s in place to make sure that those traits aren&#39;t passed on.&quot;\n\n* Irin Raptor growled*\n\n&quot; Alright, Iris. We get the point.&quot;\n\n* Iris stopped, ready to defend her point.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Well, I&#39;m just merly stating the facts. Besides, it&#39;s a good thing \nthat TM2s have that code, because it appears to me that only Dinobot has \nthose unstable traits, it&#39;s a comfort to know that if he ever gets the idea \ninto his head, we won&#39;t have to worry about the second generation.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor just growled again*\n\n&quot; That&#39;s just mean Iris!&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Well, it&#39;s true! Right Prowl?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor glared at Iris and then turned her face towards Prowl with a \nlook that he had better not answer that question Iris had just given.\nShe heard Iris chuckling.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Always the one to stick up the the Maximals that just happen to \ncatch you eyes huh?&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor snapped her head towards Iris*\n\n&quot; And just what was THAT supposed to mean?&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; I mean, who can blaim you for sticking up for him, right? You are \nthe same spicies. I guess it&#39;s only natural.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor just rolled her eyes.*\n\n&quot; Iris...I bet that the only reason that Dinobot&#39;s more unstable then any \nother TM2 is because that body his spark&#39;s in is the first slaging one \nMegatron ever made. The systems gets better the more it&#39;s recreated and \nused.\nIt&#39;s not his fault he was thrown into that hellish TM2 nightmare of a \nshell.&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Hmm...sounds like soneone&#39;s be looking up a few things, because I \nknow you&#39;re not spart enough to know that on your own. Especially when you \nnever talk to the guy.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor shook her head*\n\n&quot; So I looked it up, who gives a slag?! I always look up info on who I&#39;m \ncommanding.&quot;\n\nIRIS: &quot; Commanding? Oh nonononono. Whether you&#39;ve noticed or not, commander, \nthat bot ain&#39;t under anyones command but his own.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor looked at Prowl to see if he thought that this conversation \nwas as inappropriate as she thought it was.\nBut Iris continued.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; And you have to admit, that X Pred...&quot;\n\n* She was cut off right away by a quick slap to the monitor by Iron Raptor, \nmaking the screen fuzz for a few moments and then come back.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Why the slag did you do that?!!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor snickered and sat on her haunches, looking at Prowl with an \nammused look on her face.*\n\n&quot; Oh, I just thought it was about time we got on to that merge you were \nyapping about before.\nIf Iris would have been a bird it wasn&#39;t hard to know that her feathers \nwould have been ruffled.*\n\nIRIS: &quot; Well, I guess this just goes to show how much you people appresiate \nknowledge these days.\nAnd I&#39;ve already told you jackasses what you need to do.\nJust break the code and your sparks should do the rest!&quot;\n\n* If Iris could have turned away she would have.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
