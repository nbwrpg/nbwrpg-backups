No comlinks\n&gt; in or out while this talk is done&quot;\n\nCyclonus nodded once as he quickly walked over to one of the control\npanels on the side and activated a radio dampening field over the\nroom. there would be no communications into or out of the room except\nthrough that panel. Cyclonus stood there to monitor the panel, in case\nanyone had a call for Huydras or anyone else.\n\n(OOC: In other words, if you try to call anyone to or fromthe throne\nroom the call gets fowarded to the panel instead of where it was\nsuppose to go)\n\n&gt; &quot;One of them fell in my trap and the other was capturing while he attamped\n&gt; to rescu him... and more over five low rank Autobots and maximals are in my\n&gt; grasp right now, among prisioners and reprogramed, not counting the\n&gt; leaders.&quot; said proudly the predacon leader\n\nDeepstryke straightened, obviously impressed. &quot;It would seem that\nCyclonus has indeed chosen well. Soon you would have this whole planet\nand beyond under your dominion.&quot; The large mech said, his voice deep\nand booming.\n\n&quot;Yes&quot; said the female as she sauntered up next to Deepstryke and\nrested a hand on his broad shoulder, &quot;Unicron seems to have no need\nfor us, I think this place would be rather nice.&quot; She turned and\nsmiled at Hydras as she looked at him speculatively.\n\n&quot;Now that you have the Autobots, what is your plan of attack now, it\nwould seem that you have the means to do a great many more things?&quot;\nDeepstryke said as he smiled.\n\nCyclonus stepped foward a step from the panel, he glanced at Hydras\nand then spoke, &quot;I think I may have something that could help with\nthat.&quot; Cyclonus looked at the others, &quot;If Hydras agrees, we could once\nagain attempt to recreate the sweep army we had once before, and then\nwith all of our combined power we would brush all the rest of the\nAutobots and Maximals from this entire planet.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
