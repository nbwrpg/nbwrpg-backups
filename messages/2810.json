Her tone was a bit hasty and annoyed, being injured and having to lay on her bad side to fully encircle her target didn&#39;t seem to be making her temper any better.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve explained before, I&#39;m fine and need no assistance.&quot;\n\n* She then looked back down at Zenyak and struck again before he would be able to escape, if she wasn&#39;t careful, though, she just might end up eating him instead.\nJust then she suddenly felt charges hitting her from three different directions, her scanners alerting her and displaying where the shots were coming from...Arcangle, Tritan and Shocker!\nShe growled loudly, even though they were trying to hit Zenyak they were only getting her since she encircled him! Thus, damaging her further!\nHer growl soon turned into an extremely annoyed roar.*\n\n&quot; ENOUGH!!! You&#39;re shooting me, you fools!&quot;\n\n* She thought to herself of why those bots didn&#39;t seem to have any common sense and actually see that they couldn&#39;t possably hope to hit Zenyak...since her body was in the way!\nHer temper and the fact that she was wounded only seemed to make the matter worse, any bot within a few metres of her was bound to get bit!\nBut that was very convenient because she still had Zenyak to beat the slag out of, but then Striker was coming...or she smelled him approaching.\nIron Raptor then turned her head towards Zenyak with a look that could only mean one thing, if he didn&#39;t calm down and stop struggling she was going to kill him!\nShe was just in the mood to rip a bot to pieces and it just so happened that Zenyak was in the wrong place at the wrong time!\nBut also there was one real fact to her temper, if anybot approached her now without caution she was just in the mood to slag them. A very serious fact that would be wise for the approaching Striker to heed.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
