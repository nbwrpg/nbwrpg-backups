He \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n had\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; also listened to Lord Elder and thought it was best to allow hi=\r\nm to do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what he needed to do.  With Tallon and Perceptor in his cab,=\r\n he was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; than content and rolls at a good reasonable spe=\r\ned with the two of them \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his cab.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Thank yo=\r\nu Perceptor, I&#39;m honored to have you with us.  Now, this is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I call valuable, having friends among you through the best and worst o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; times, knowing that your comrades are willing to make a great effo=\r\nrt to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; preserve what is most precious, is something even the most pri=\r\nceless of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; articles can never hold an ounce of wealth to.  Tallon, af=\r\nter hearing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you became one of us, it honors me to see ho=\r\nw much you have evolved and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for that my compassion for you will neve=\r\nr die.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He thinks for a moment, about Hydras, and gathers his=\r\n words carefully.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I doubt very much that Hydras has any capa=\r\ncity to feel the compassion\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that all of us are capable of feeling.  =\r\nI know that will be a downfall \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him, because without comp=\r\nassion there can be no loyalty, no honor, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; most certainly no assu=\r\nrance of victory.  And without those elements, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doubt very much he =\r\nwill be able to hold his place on the upper hand for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; much longer.  W=\r\ne have to gather our forces, come together as one, and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nthen will we be able to take back what is rightfully ours and preserve\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; what is remaining of our planet.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; With his words he comes =\r\nto a slow stop.

Could you take my wheel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for me?
