Probably take a \nbit of her skin/armor with it!\nThe shield bucked again, nearly snapping off her arm as a few of the charges \nNemisis sent hit the alloy.\nThe markings on her shield nearly glew at a blinding rate by now, the \ncharges which almost mented IR completely being more then enough power for \nwhat her mind had in store.\n\nIron Raptor looked at Nemisis Enforced throught eh visor for a second more \nbefore removing the shield, it retracking into her arm and leaving a long \nglowing line along the top of it in the armor. An energy bar.\nShe looked at Nemisis.*\n\n&quot; Kind of ironic, isn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n* taking the sword out from behind her, the blade glowing with blinding \nlight as she drew it over her shoulder.*\n\n&quot; The energy you sent to destroy me...&quot;\n\n* She then brought the sword down so that the tip of it pointed up towards \nNemisis, bring her other hand up to grip the handle along with the other.\nThe blade seemed to explode for a moment, a wind picking up around it&#39;s \nholder from the sheer force of the energy.\nIron Raptor braced herself.*\n\n&quot;...will destroy YOU!!!&quot;\n\n* The blade seemed to explode again as a thick beam of light errupted from \nthe base of the blade and worked it&#39;s way up towards the tip.\nIron Raptors targeting system melding with the energy to give it a direction \nto go to hit her targrts.\nThe beam left the blade and went for what it was instructed to, Nemisis.\nTuned to the pattern of his sparkbeat, the thick beam of energy shot towards \nhim, so larget that it would engulf him as soon as it struck!\nBut as the straight energy headed for Nemisis a few tentrels of it branched \noff of it, arching around and heading for a few more targeted beings while \nthe main stem kept on it&#39;s current course.\nThe tendrels snaked around, one heading rowards Dark Wolf. Silent and \nquicker then light itself!\nAnother shot towards Perndabot just as quickly.\nWith as much power as was in the energy, the shere force of it entering any \nbody would short out any curcuit they may have. As well as, perhaps, create \nan internal explosion which could wipe out the spark completely.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
