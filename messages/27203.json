One could never do with \ntripping up and embaressing themselves. His stalk eyes looked in the \ndirection of every sound he heard, and his scythe like blade on the \nend of his tail was held high behind him.\n\nHis emerald green eyes held a glint of arrogance in them as he \nsurveyed the woods. Diablo looked forward to meeting the Alliance \nleader.. and finding out whether he or she was a total idiot or one \nactually worthy of leading. He chuckled silently to himself. Having \nno mouth allowed him to think using the mind, but since he had met no \nother bots he had never tested it out.\n\nA branch that was directly in his path was snapped in two with his \ntail, and the bot never slowed his pace. His internal scanners told \nhim there was a base somewhere near here.. but which one, he couldn&#39;t \nbe sure..\n\n\n"}}
