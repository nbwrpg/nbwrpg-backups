They were both \n&gt; similar in hei=\r\nght and build, Shard only being an inch or two shy of \n&gt; Myrmidon. \n&gt; \n&gt; Fo=\r\nr a few seconds, Shard just glared at him, as if to show that he\n&gt; couldn&#39;t=\r\n be intimidated or forced into answering if he didn&#39;t want \n&gt; to. &quot;Shard,&quot; =\r\nhe said. &quot;I awoke from a stasis pod in the forrest and \n&gt; saw the battle.
