Near him, Cinder was already firing at \n&gt; &gt; Rippersnapper. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mantle knew that Cinder wanted to impress Prowl, but he \nhoped \n&gt; &gt; that she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; wouldn&#39;t do stupid things to show off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &quot;Allright, guys, we&#39;ll fight like this for a while, and \nthen \n&gt; &gt; we&#39;ll form \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Element and chase these guys out of here!&quot; he said to his \n&gt; &gt; team over the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; commlink, watching Rubble emerge from the Element with \nhis \n&gt; &gt; missile launcher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; and fire two missiles at Rampage.
