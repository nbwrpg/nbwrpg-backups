The \n  Tripredacus again?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tycoon: \n  Not this time. (He poured the liquid =\r\nenergon in two &lt;BR&gt;&gt; small&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; glasses and =\r\nhanded one to his employee.) They&#39;ve offered \n  great&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; contracts, but they&#39;re ending their \n  invasion soon. They don&#39;t &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; need any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; more \n  ore. (He sipped a li=\r\nttle from his cup) This contractor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wished \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; remain anonymous, but it&#39;s going to be one of \n  our biggest &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; offer yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we \n  have been =\r\ngiven the mining rights for a whole &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planet!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krhinos nearly choked on his energon. A \n  pl=\r\nanet! StarDrill Inc &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; become the=\r\n \n  most profitable company in the whole system!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krhinos: You serious, Tyke?!? A planet!? Which on=\r\ne just for \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fun?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; Tycoon smiled \n  grimly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n Tycoon: Earth! We \n  have the rights to mine Earth! The human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cra=\r\ndle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself! (Seeing Krhinos&#39;s unbelieving =\r\nface, he held a hand \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; up.) Now,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; no=\r\nw... It&#39;s the prehistoric \n  Earth, not that rebellious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; headquarte=\r\nr of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; today&#39;s.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Krhinos: What are we looking for? Iron? Radium?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tycoon: All you can find! =\r\nYou get a full mobile mining \n  base &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; can keep in orbit, a \n  small outpost on the planet from which &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ship the resources, I&#39;ll ev=\r\nen grant you that Mammoth Drill \n  you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; love so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; much. In short, do your \n  best! Oh... I almost forgot... I got =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you a few&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercenaries to bring al=\r\nong. They should be in the Mess Hall \n  by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; Take &#39;em along. They&#39;ll help \n  you a lot, it&#39;s on their &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; contract. If it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; isn&#39;t, just pay them on=\r\n the company&#39;s account.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n Krhinos: Will do, Boss. Thanks a lot! I&#39; \n  make this mission pay &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n up!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; The massive bot st=\r\nood up, finished his drink in a nano and \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saluted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tycoon one last time before \n  going to the Mess Hall. It w=\r\nas the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar where he&#39;d exp=\r\nect anything, from the lowly pleasure bots \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; drunken brawls. He looked \n  around, trying to find some &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; relatively fresh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercs in the crow=\r\nd...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo! \n  Groups Sponsor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of Yahoo!
