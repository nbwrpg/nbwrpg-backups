Of course her troops would spare Iron Raptor, however, but\n&gt; she walked to the base to say goodbye to her old friend Iron Raptor. She\n&gt; passed Ramhorn on the bridge, looking at him she laughed.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Little Ramhorn, Maximal worshipper!&quot; Plintissa said. Plintissa walked\naway\n&gt; from the base, deciding to tell Iron Raptor goodbye over commlink.\nPlintissa\n&gt; and Dracona walked out and sat in the meadow. Plintissa called out to\nLiono\n&gt; on her commlink.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Liono, I don&#39;t give a damn about your troops. It&#39;s time for some\nmaiming.&quot;\n&gt; Plintissa said. Dracona pulled out a heavy blaster rifle from her Cyber\n&gt; storage compartment and handed it to Plintissa. Plintissa locked it onto\nher\n&gt; arm and smileed.

Plintissa leapt on top\nof\n&gt; a rock, Sinesis and Sinister standing behind her with Dracona.
