I couldn&#39;t have done it without your \n&gt; help too, Perceptor.  I&#39;ve learned a great lesson myself.  Never lose \n&gt; sight of the comrades who fight beside you, for there&#39;s nothing stronger \n&gt; than an alliance of close friends, who&#39;s hearts reach out to those in \n&gt; need.  I was in need and didn&#39;t realize it until now.  But now that I do, \n&gt; I&#39;m thankful to all of you who helped me through this ordeal, and helped \n&gt; Rodimus as well.  Speaking of which, I&#39;d like to remain here until he is \n&gt; fully functionable.

Meanwhile the insectoids continued \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thier\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relentless attacks, on both Vestige and Tuscon!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Suddenly the door slammed open, the sounds of buzzing insects could \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heard, as a swarm of them flew into the room. Blue ones, red ones,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; silver ones, black ones, each of all shapes and sizes. However in \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; midst of that a female walked, the insects flying around her \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; obeying\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; her and yet giving her a wide birth at the same time. She was tall,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; taller than any of the insects, her movements smooth and flowing. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; She\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was black and red with large insect like wings sitting on her back,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; designed something like seeker wings on a transformer. Her limbs \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supple and femine, but there was no mistaking the strength and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; power\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that was held within them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Tuscon, Tuscon.&quot; She said as she turned her gaze upon him, her \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; eyes\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were crimson multifaceted eyes. &quot;You believe that your leader was \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what we wanted?&quot; She tilted her head, &quot;Ahh&quot; she said as just just\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding it, &quot;It is that singular thinking you have.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; She chuckled as she looked over at Vesige, the insects were \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; swarming\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; over him, causing him to falter under thier onslaught. &quot;You have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gotten this far only because I we have allowed it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At a gesture from the larger female the swarm of insects that were\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attacking Tuscon and Vestige leaped into the air and began to hover\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aroud the cieling of the room as the room itself began to warp and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spin as if the very world around him was changing, altering, or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perhaps returning to normal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The last whisper of a voice, &quot;Perhaps you gave us exactly what we\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wanted . . . &quot; then there is laughter.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The world goes black . . . and then Tuscon is aware of the medbay \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his systems come back online. He can hear the voice of Santon, &quot;It \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; done.
