She slightly closed one eye at him and \nfrowned at him.  She wanted to ask him why she and Quickstrike were \nabandonded by their fearless leader.  Fear no longer existed in her \nbody, anger,hate, and the wanting of revenge governed her mind.\nShe stood still and glared at Megarton.  She looked over at Black \nAracnia with a look of, I&#39;m going to kill him, look.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron lands in the clearing of the bunker.

Now point me to he \nnearest \n&gt; computer and we can get this over with quickly, &quot; He then looked to \n&gt; Darkmouse, &quot;as quick as cracking a spine.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Thats enough Megatron! Help us or leave!&quot; Aracnia said as \nTarantulas \n&gt; laughed himself out of his seat.\n&gt;     &quot;Im sorry, indeed I am. I will put old grudges aside and do \nwhat needs to \n&gt; be done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     (Waspinator isnt in command, Kitkat is, until Megatrons return.)\n\n\n"}}
