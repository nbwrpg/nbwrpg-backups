But all of a sudden the spark was \novertaken and went forever offline replaced by a black spark (if \nyou&#39;ve red most of my posts this may sound familar).  The chip of the \npredicon only makes it blacker.  It becomes less powerful, but far \nmore evil than it&#39;s ocunterpart.  And it feels a thirst for power 100 \nfold his so great he can suck the power out of other bots, primarily \nones like himself.\n\nOOC: I skimmed it so if the ship is crashing or already crashed ignore \nthis next part.\n\nBIC:  He instantly gets lost in rage and begins pulling circuits and \nsmashing everything in an attempt to get to the same planet as his \ncounterpart (hey we have to crash on Earth don&#39;t we).  He heads for \nthe control room and hurls a piece of metal he pulled off his stasis \npod at the main control panel.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;hugar_twriker&quot; &lt;hugar_twriker@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:  Well, I am going to use Sadistacons(LN came up with it) as my \n&gt; faction name and Sacrilege Plague(I came up with it) as my ship \n&gt; name.

On board is the ship are enough supplies for a small \n&gt; &gt; invasion.  Infact,  that is what this ship is going to do.  In the \n&gt; &gt; bridge are many Cybertron Bots.  They all happen to have a \nPredacon \n&gt; &gt; Symbol on their shoulder.  In the biggest chair, located in the \n&gt; &gt; middle of the bridge, is occipied by a large green bot.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;    The bot looks around the bridge.  When the bots eyes looks all \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; way to the left, the bot says, &quot;Kan Kick, are you asleep?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    A lightly tan bot, whos legs are up on his console and his head \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; leaning to the side quickly sits upright while he rubs his \n&gt; eyes, &quot;No, \n&gt; &gt; I was wide awake.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    The bot starts to laugh and says, &quot;Don&#39;t lie, it&#39;s not nice.&quot;  \n&gt; THe \n&gt; &gt; bot then looks behind him and to the right, &quot;Snake eyes, come \nhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    The bot he was looking at, who is very thin(For a BW bot), \n&gt; stands \n&gt; &gt; up and walks towards the bot.  His feet echo against the plating \nas \n&gt; &gt; he comes forward, &quot;Yessh Sshir?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    &quot;Send out a Communication message to all the members of the \ncrew \n&gt; &gt; to come to the bridge.&quot;  The green bot says as he looks at a \nsmudge \n&gt; &gt; on his right arm rest of his chair, &quot;Ohh and tell Lady Right that \n&gt; &gt; next time she cleans my chair she needs to make sure there are no \n&gt; &gt; smudges.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    &quot;Yessh Sshir.&quot;  Snake Eyes says as he walks back to his console \n&gt; &gt; and the ground echo behing him.
