He was such a moron sometimes. She rolled her eyes and stood up. \nIt was time to save him, again. She Ran over to him and pushed him out of \nthe way, the bolts would do her no harm, she could control them, he \ncouldn&#39;t. She felt them hit her and coarse through her body. It didn&#39;t hurt \nher, but the force of the blast knocked her to the ground. She groaned, she \nreally should hire a baby sitter for him, and passed out.*\n\n* Snow Tech felt a shove and flew to the ground, hitting his face on a rock. \nHe squeeled and sat up, clutching his nose and looking cross-eyed. He \nmuttered something about how rude some bots are and turned around to find \nShadow Cat unconcience. He gasped and ran to her side, lifting his head he \nhowled(or, to be more percise, caterwalted).*\n\n&quot; Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!! Shaddy!&quot;\n\n* He looked at Hurricane. His eyes turning a bright, erie green. He growled \nand advanced menacingly towards the bot. He growled out a single sentance to \nthe other bot before he attacked...*\n\n&quot; THAT was MY SISTER!!!!!!&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech spread his wings and lifted off into the sky. He turned on his \nauto ice-rockets and aimed them at hurricane. He smiled, showing all his \ncanines and started firing them on turbo.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
