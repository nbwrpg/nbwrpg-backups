All around are Predacon \nbuilding autoguns and other essential machines for the new base. &quot;Good to see \nyou. The Commander is in the bunker now with Tarantulas. She told me to tell \nyou to contact her when you get her. I think she wants you to go into the \nbunker with them.&quot; He says.\n    He then turns and yells at Grappler to quit screwing around and to get \nback to work.\n\n    Inside the bunker, Tarantulas moves forward first. He was bigger, \nstroner, and better amred than the tiny fembot. Thus, she ordered him to go \nin first in case of a trap. The corridor with all the doors seemed long, but \nwhen they got the power up and running, the lights revealed it wasnt so long \nafter all. Now they had to get into the rooms.\n    &quot;Tarantulas, see if you cant hack your way into the main computer core in \nthe Triangle Room. Im guessing thats Opperations.&quot;\n    \n\n"}}
