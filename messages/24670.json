Time \nto \n&gt; use the main turret!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf sent me an email saying that he wouldn&#39;t be able to post \n&gt; till Monday and that I had his chars till he&#39;s back, but it wasn&#39;t \n&gt; very clear when he was leaving, so if he doesn&#39;t post tomorrow, I \n&gt; guess I get the Trainers for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Zardus/Havoc/Lavacons/Slayer/The Iron Fist::\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus raises an eyebrow at Prebon&#39;s reply. &quot;I don&#39;t think \nattacking \n&gt; a full powered battle cruiser, especially with only five bots on \nyour \n&gt; side, is very logical. But I do have a more logical solution, if \nyou \n&gt; care to listen.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He smiles, noticing that the attackers were on the beach. Zardus \ntaps \n&gt; a few buttons on his wrist comp.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Recieving several commands from Zardus&#39;s wrist comp, the Iron Fist \n&gt; activates its main cannon. A panel slides aside on the top of it, \nand \n&gt; a mean looking large cannon slides out. It aims at the shore of \n&gt; Spain, three miles away, where most of the attackers were.\n&gt; \n&gt; A wide glowing beam emerges from the cannon, making its way with \n&gt; great speed toward the beach. It hits land in three seconds, with \n&gt; more energy than it had used last time during its demonstration of \n&gt; destroying a whole mountain.\n&gt; \n&gt; The shockwave from the blast reaches even the Alliance base, \nalthough \n&gt; the cannon was designed not to leave a big shockwave. Water rushes \n&gt; into the beach, which was now little more than smoking rocks. \nHissing \n&gt; and steam rise up as cold water hits the rocks, making the area \n&gt; completely impossible to see through, although the Iron Fist&#39;s \n&gt; scanners were not affected by the water. The beach was destroyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Iron Fist continues to fire its defences, missile launchers and \n&gt; laser bolts streaming out toward the trainers, a missile toward \neach \n&gt; one, along with a dozen or so bolts.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Havoc stares in surprise as the Iron Fist destroys the shore of \n&gt; Spain. Several shots hit the shields in front of him, reminding him \n&gt; that he was in a battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havoc fires two more missiles at Bullet. Even though he couldn&#39;t \nsee \n&gt; him, he could easily pick him up with the scanners.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Astral yelps as the beach that he was flying over is destroyed. He \n&gt; doesn&#39;t see the shots, and two of them slam into his leg. He \ngrowls, \n&gt; flying upward and waiting till he could see again.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fenox spins out of the way of the missiles, firing several shots \nback \n&gt; at them to make sure they didn&#39;t come back around. She looked \nahead, \n&gt; two shots from Blaze slamming into her left shoulder. Diving down, \n&gt; she flies under Blaze, firing up at the bot as the shore below them \n&gt; is destroyed.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Starlight dived out of the way, the bolt from Bullet grazing her \nback \n&gt; and leaving a wide scorch mark on it. She growls, taking out her \n&gt; charge launcher and firing two charges at Bullet. The charges lock \non \n&gt; magnetically, zooming through the air to their target.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slayer erupts from the water, a mad-looking Recklessa flying after \n&gt; him seconds later.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m perfectly fine,&quot; he replies, spinning in the air to avoid \na \n&gt; missile from Recklessa. Several bolts from the Iron Fist nearly hit \n&gt; his head.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Prebon recieved Zardus&#39; transmission. &quot;They&#39;re still able to \n&gt; communicate?\n&gt; &gt; Itold Blaze to make sure to eliminate that possability.&quot; He \nwasn&#39;t \n&gt; happy\n&gt; &gt; about how disorganized this organized attack was becoming, his \n&gt; trainers were\n&gt; &gt; working well together but were still being sloppy. &quot;Hello Zardus, \n&gt; you have\n&gt; &gt; an impressive ship, I must admit for Predacon technology it has \nit&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; advantages.&quot; he didn&#39;t want to keep the line open or he knew that \n&gt; the ships\n&gt; &gt; defenses would lock on to him but he couldn&#39;t help to gloat. &quot;I \n&gt; function for\n&gt; &gt; the fight, I&#39;m programmed for battle, and I attack you because it \n&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; most logical strategic move for this battle. Unless of course you \n&gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; more logical solution.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
