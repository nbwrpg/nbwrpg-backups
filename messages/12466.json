No offense, but what happened to that Liono &#39;bot who was \nsupposed to be command?&quot;\n\n----\n\nGrimmler yelped, bolts hitting his right arm, the arm instantly going \nlimp, his gun dropping. (Gangong did use a stun weapon, right? I&#39;m \npretty sure that&#39;s what you said)\n\n----\n\nSmokescreen, in the bridge, set the autoguns to fire upon Gangon.\n\nThen an idea popped into his head.  The flame throwers (reading \nthrough the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s profile, I remembered it had flame \nthrowers in the hallway walls!), in the walls, but low, so they would \nonly his someone&#39;s feet.\n\nHe saw that Gangon was a few feet from one, and so was Bright Blade \n(no weak pun intended).\n\n---\n\nRex and Firearm saw Grimmler get hit with the bolts, and opened fire.\n\nFirearm fired off three plasma blasts from his wrist cannon at \nGangon&#39;s chest.\n\nRex fired off two laser bolts from his rifle at Gangon&#39;s left \nshoulder.\n\n\n"}}
