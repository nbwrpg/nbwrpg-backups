Faction unknown.* Tavatron sighed, that was just great. \nThe last thing they needed were more enemies. Tavatron watched Dinobot as he \nprepared to leave the ship. She silently walked up behind him:\n\n&quot;Liono said to stay at base.&quot; Tavatron transformed (to B.M.) and sat beside \nDinobot. She was still concerned about him. Dinobot&#39;s hate for his enemies \ncould cloud his judgement. Clouded judgement before and/or during battle \ncould be a costly mistake.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
