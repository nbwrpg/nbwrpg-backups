There were dark corners\nto him, and he was not sure what it portended to.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; With permission granted, Quickstride transforms into beast mode and trots\n&gt; off to find Windlord.   He trots by the med bay then perks his ears up,\n&gt; following the source of Windlord&#39;s footsteps until he clip clops into the\n&gt; training room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Windlord, are you okay?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSliding out of the way for a moment he watched as QUICKSTRIDE\ninteracted with WINDLORD, looking for cues and clues that would help\nhim to understand him. Perhaps it would be revealed in their\nconversation.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
