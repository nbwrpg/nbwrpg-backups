Computer, open all frequencies for a general attention \nmessage.\n\nTo all cybertronians living here on Earth, I send my greetings to you. I am \ncommander Daemos of the Tripredacus and I come here as a mercenary. My ship, \nthe Hellgate, is a product of the advanced tripredacus technology and is \nalso affordable to you. As for my nature... I guess you will see about it \nwhen we meet!\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
