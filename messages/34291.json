So for everybody that is interacting with\nmy characters, I&#39;m sorry. Here&#39;s how I&#39;m going to\nsplit it up:\n\nMagmatron-nobody, he&#39;s going to sit in his room and\npout\n\nSpy Streak-Rudra\nCerberus, Nightblade: They got stuck in transit to the\nDestron Base Sulaco, they&#39;ll get there soon.\n\nDachande-Alloran because he controls Battera.\n\n\nIn charge of the Destrons will be Cygnar and\nApocalypse, work togther, do not bicker with one\nanother. Try to get the Deathsaurus back to\noperational performance. Then Cygnar will be in charge\nof that area and Apocalypse will be in charge of the\nSulaco. Do not do anything without consulting the\nother. Thank you.\n\nSomebody should go get Hulicgen and the new Destron. \n\nOverall have fun, this is the only time I could get on\nthe computer at school and I already have like 600 e-mails.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
