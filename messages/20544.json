So eager to be reek their own \npleasure that they don�t even stop to think, how idiotic!\n\n* But she continued down the hall with them anyway, again her stomach \nspeaking up. She looked down at it as it grumbled again, only a little \nlouder. But then looked up at both men with a fake blush. *\n\n� Oh�excuse me, digesting can really be a bother��\n\n* But before she had a chance to say something else she lost her footing on \nthe floor as the ship landed and shook, finding herself on her back and \nlooking up only to see two males heading right for her.\nShe gave a little yelp before Bloodystrike would have landed right on top of \nher, her voice a growl and hiss. *\n\n� Get off of me, you dope!� But then she caught herself. Her voice a bit \nmore sweeter�but sounding more annoyable at the end. � I mean�please remove \nyourself from off my body.�\n\n* Men!*\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
