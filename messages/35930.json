He straightens and slams his fist into the piece of metal heading for him, knocking it aside. Reaching behind him, he takes out a very large, mean-looking rifle, aiming it at Dogged. He pulls the trigger once, nearly stumbling back from the recoil. The shot misses, sailing past Dogged and smashing into the roof of the tunnel. A large explosion caves that section in, and the bot fires again, this time right on target, the explosive round heading for Dogged very quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dogged  . transforms to four treaded\n&gt; terrain vehicle about the size of a snowmobile.\n&gt; Speeding through the flames, the heat warping the paint and singing the\n&gt; metal beneath. he remained focused on the bum. The two weakest bots were the\n&gt; origional targets so he remained fixxed on scrapping them first.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arty noticed that Slags attention was turned away from him. he raised his\n&gt; right arm and fired a sidewinder from the winglike attachment mounted at\n&gt; it&#39;s side. his left hand found his mini launcher. he drew it from his\n&gt; holster and fired an impact grenade toward Crossroads. His equilibreum\n&gt; caused dizzyness and he stumbled backwards his weight carrying him towards\n&gt; Pacifix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Switchblades optics began to blurr as Repugnus&#39;s waves took thier effect. He\n&gt; tried to adjust his optics to compensate but it was no use. he flew backward\n&gt; slowly until he could feal the building behind him. he dug his feet into the\n&gt; side hopeing that the effect would wear off shortly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Jordan Guthrie &lt;gunthers8@n...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 9:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Repugnus/Slag/JetV::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Repugnus continues running at Switchblade while emitting color waves to\n&gt; &gt; disrupt the bots optic sensors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Slag::\n&gt; &gt; Slag spits another wave of fire towards Dogged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::JetV::\n&gt; &gt; JetV arrives at the battle scene some bit away.

He\n&gt; lept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; skyward drawing his disk launcher. He fired a stasis disk at the bum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planning on the disks energy draining qualities to down his opponent. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missle steeked by him striking a building behind him. debris began to\n&gt; fall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forcing Doggeds attention to be diverted. he lept from side to side\n&gt; using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his speed to avoid the falling metal. he quickly grabbed a jagged piece\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metal andhurled it with all the velocity he could muster at the bum.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: The bum and the hole....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Grimlock kept smelling Repugnas.

That meant it would be wrong to rip it apart. &quot;Me\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; say are you...&quot; he was cut off as the two armor piercing shells hit\n&gt; him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; and exploded, sending him falling on his side. He snarled, turned his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; head, and opened his mouth, letting loose a stream of laser fire at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; attacker. &quot;Yeh, now Dinobots stomp.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
