He was only trying to help her.\nHe whined and moved away from the door, nodding when she asked if that was \nall he wanted to let her know.\nFenox sounded impatient and annoyed with him, making him feel bad.\nIf there was one thing that the people who created him could say, was that \nhis feelings were hurt easily.\nD wasn&#39;t use to bluntness, and was basically as helpless as a new born in \nthis world.\nEven though he held great power, he was shy in using it and was a kind \nheart.\nBut he still didn&#39;t like Vlad, though Fenox didn&#39;t seem to need him to \nprotect her or anything. So he wouldn&#39;t, since she knew what was going on.\nD sat down on his haunches and lowered his head, wating for Fenox to leave \nthe room first. Maybe making her leave Vlad alone out there was worse then \nhe thought.*\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
