You have\n&gt; heard our names but we have =\r\nnot heard yours.

Taking the mome=\r\nnt to contemplate the duo being factionless in this realm, and not being aw=\r\nrae of the differences between hte factions gave him to a quick pair of con=\r\nclusions.  the first that they had been blank protoforms and then activated=\r\n, but not had proper datafiles installed by whomever had brought htem onlin=\r\ne.\n\nKeeping these conclusions ot himself until he met the &#39;leader&#39; of this =\r\ngroup, &quot;Very well, today I play.  You may call me WHEELIE if you want this =\r\nway.&quot;  Walking along with the two if they led him, but letting them go in &#39;=\r\nfront&#39; of him to lead.  &quot;And I must say, you speak weird to me this way.  W=\r\nhich of us right, in what manner words come to light?&quot;\n\nKeeping the two in =\r\nfront of him where, hopefully as he followed he could surreptitiously keep =\r\nthem &#39;covered&#39; wtih his weapon if they were leading to ambush, and have a m=\r\noment if it came to worst he could disengage befor ethey could fire on him.=\r\n  still playing up the role of the addled Autobot.\n\n\n"}}
