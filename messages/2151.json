She had a pampered life, and she wasn&#39;t a warrior. She couldn&#39;t deal with stuff like that. Teltoli knew she had to admit this*\n\n&quot;Do you wanna talk about it?

She wasn&#39;t sad because of something that Teltoli said or did, she wasn&#39;t really sad at all but really more deep in thoughts that she would rather forget. It just seemed to affect her physically as well as mentally.*\n\n&quot; No, just old wounds that haven&#39;t healed properly. Nothing to worry about.&quot;\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
