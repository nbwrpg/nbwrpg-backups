The score is 106 \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the Ballers and 1=\r\n02 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has been \nthe \n&gt; &gt; play by Gorzo.  G=\r\norzo, A rookie from Crystal University is 30 for \n34 \n&gt; &gt; shots made.  10 3=\r\n-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 \npoints.  \n&gt; &gt; But can the last ra=\r\nnk Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the \nfirst \n&gt; &gt; rank Ballers?  Lets=\r\n go down to the court to see what happens.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:=\r\n  Hello, we have 20 secounds left in the \ngame. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The Gorrilaz are p=\r\nassing in the ball as we speak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;=\r\nBentals&quot; passes the ball in to \na \n&gt; &gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gor=\r\nzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles the ball \n&gt; &gt; down the court and passes it to a bot wi=\r\nth a jersey that \nsays &quot;Bob&quot;. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Be=\r\nntals passes it a bot with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passe=\r\ns the ball to Bentals and \n&gt; &gt; Bentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up =\r\nto the 3-point line \nand \n&gt; &gt; jumps up making it look like a jump shot.  At=\r\n the last second he \n&gt; &gt; passes it to a jumping bot, which is by the goal, =\r\nwhose jersey \n&gt; &gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned then slams the ball for an Alley-op(SP=\r\n?).  \nBots \n&gt; &gt; with a different jersey grab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in to a bot with a jersey \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nich read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stupid.)  Rauq starts \n&gt; &gt; Dribbi=\r\nling the ball down court when he trips over his own feet.  \nThe \n&gt; &gt; ball l=\r\neaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo, who is \n&gt; &gt; standing be=\r\nhind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The ball \n&gt; &gt; sails into the =\r\nhoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Court Side Announcer:  HOLY RUST POCKE=\r\nT, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-\n106.  \n&gt; &gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;5 Years=\r\n Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Bot that was wearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years earlie=\r\nr was in \na \n&gt; &gt; small 2 person shuttle.  He is Flying around Earth.  All o=\r\nf a \nsudden \n&gt; &gt; the right wing catches on fire and falls down towards Eart=\r\nh as \nthe \n&gt; &gt; shuttle falls down with the wing.  The shuttle lands near Mi=\r\nd-\nAfrica \n&gt; &gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
