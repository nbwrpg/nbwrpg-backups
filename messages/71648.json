She looks around quickly and realizes the terrain wa=\r\ns full of trees that may be damaged but were still stable enough to hold he=\r\nr weight.  She jumps up to catch a hanging branch and like a skilled acroba=\r\nt, she manages to swing herself up higher into the trees.  From there, she =\r\ncould see a large branch severely cracked, hanging right over Dark Rodimus&#39;=\r\ns head.     She then spots a large tree root at the edge of what looked lik=\r\ne a tar pool.  How convenient was that?  And she certainly was fast enough =\r\nto dart out of the way if she had to.  But if she could only break that bra=\r\nnch without falling out of the tree herself.  \n\n&quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we t=\r\nypically are kinda predictable..  So why not try something original?  Now h=\r\now deep is that crack?&quot;\n\nShe examines the crack in the branch.  She finds t=\r\nhat with just a strong hit with a sharp object, the branch would definitely=\r\n come down. She raises a brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack=\r\n in the branch.  She hits her target as the branch cracks loudly and detach=\r\nes from the damaged tree with a loud creaking noise.  She hoped her first p=\r\nlan of attack would work.  Phase two would also prove difficult as she wait=\r\ns to see how the chips fall, literally. \n\n&quot; Timber..&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Tucson qu=\r\nickly catches Noctorro as he puts his body beneath his to support him.\n\n&quot; E=\r\nasy I got you.  Seekers?  But how? They&#39;re out scouting the parameters, I s=\r\naw them myself.  Something is very wrong here. Leo Prime, it&#39;s definitely n=\r\not Hydras and I&#39;m almost certain a greater evil is at play here.  I suggest=\r\n we send rescue efforts to the Fuzors immediately. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a=\r\n matter of who, it&#39;s a matter of what is causing such chaos.&quot;\n\nHe looks to =\r\nHydras.\n\nYou haven&#39;t deployed any seekers have you?  If you gave that order=\r\n to attack the Fuzors our alliance ends here.&quot;\n\nHe scowls at Hydras.\n\nMeanw=\r\nhile Nightshift watches from a good distance as Straight Shot attempts to p=\r\nlay decoy with Dark Rodimus.  Yet seeing him seems extremely disturbing to =\r\nNightshift.  He rolls into view and looks to the dark imposter.\n\n&quot; So that&#39;=\r\ns it, huh?!  First you make us believe you&#39;re all over the evil thing and n=\r\now you go right back ta be&#39;n an A class Aft.  Nice, real nice.  Elita hate =\r\nta say it but I think your dad just turned tail on us.  That&#39;s it, I take o=\r\nrders from Leo and Tucson but that&#39;s about it.  Consider yourself on my do =\r\nnot trust list.
