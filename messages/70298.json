Now, ta find my brother and get t=\r\nhis party started!&quot;\n\nIn the tunnel, Tucson puts up his headlights, and scan=\r\ns the tunnels. He does catch a faint signature resonating from his sensors.=\r\n\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right Perceptor, it is Rodimus.  And by the way, about all that y=\r\nou told me, I&#39;m glad you did.  Now I know everything there is to know.  I m=\r\nay not have been able to read Kups&#39; reviews of these tunnels, but I will be=\r\n sure to do so when we get back to the Ark.  And I&#39;m not mad at you for any=\r\nthing Perceptor.  In fact, I&#39;m highly proud of you for expressing the coura=\r\nge to confess.  Now, let&#39;s go find Rodimus and bring him back to the Ark.\n\n=\r\nAs they were conversing, Quickstride had made it to the mouth of the tunnel=\r\n, as Straight Shot dismounts and kneels down beside it.\n\n&quot; Okaaaay, looks l=\r\nike we&#39;re taking a real shot in the dark Quickstride.&quot;\n\nThe maximal transfo=\r\nrms into robot mode and kneels down.\n\n&quot;Yeah, big time.  Okay, let&#39;s go.&quot;\n\nH=\r\ne helps to lower her down into the tunnel.  She can hear Tucson loud and cl=\r\near.\n\n&quot;I hear him!  Follow me!&quot;\n\nShe begins to make her way into the tunnel=\r\n, following her brother&#39;s voice.  The bean pods once again react in Quickst=\r\nride&#39;s gut as a noxious gas fills the cavern.\n\n&quot; What&#39;s that smell?&quot;\n\nQuick=\r\nstride gives a sheepish grin.\n\n&quot;Sorry. That - happens when I overdose on th=\r\ne bean pods.&quot;\n\nThe scent wafts through the caverns.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: It is possible=\r\n that Tuscon has also read a similar report from Kup as\n&gt; well, since he wa=\r\ns also there near the same time. I will post tomorrow to\n&gt; give Sandy a cha=\r\nnce to catch up. Just keep in mind that the tunnel is\n&gt; treacherous, cave i=\r\nns are likely if one is not careful and the creature that\n&gt; has what appear=\r\ns to be Rodimus seems to be moving about as fast as Tuscon\n&gt; can typcially =\r\ndrive. At the moment the cave tunnel is open and clear and is\n&gt; about 8-10 =\r\nfeet wide and tall, the walls are sheer as if cut by an energy\n&gt; beam, alth=\r\nough there are spots where the wall has caved slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; IE: The chase =\r\nwill not be an easy one, so let&#39;s have some fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mo=\r\nn, May 10, 2010 at 7:32 PM, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor=\r\n::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;QUICK!!!

A scan reveals some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of me=\r\nchanoid, possibly minion in origin carrying a shape or mass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that coul=\r\nd possibly be Rodimus.
