However\n&gt; the council&#39;s message will not wait long.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca turned to leave, he could see Silverbolt standing just outside\n&gt; the medical chamber still looking through the glass. He had left\n&gt; Silverbolt in charge of the Fuzors while he had been away, now it was\n&gt; time to catch up.\n&gt;\n&gt; He stepped out of the and into the observation room, &quot;Silverbolt.&quot;\n&gt; Torca said as he moved his large bulk through the doorway followed by\n&gt; Bantor. &quot;It has been some time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Keep in mind Torca is leader of the Fuzors here at the moment\n&gt; and a high ranking general)\n&gt; http://www.tfu.info/1998/Maximal/Bantor/bantor.htm\n&gt; http://www.tfu.info/1998/Maximal/Torca/torca.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 3:08 AM, Airshadow Nightstar\n&gt; &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/kup/Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Agree&quot;siged Perceptor&quot;Nightlight&#39;s spark isnt like ours&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;WHAT????&quot;Said surpriced Kup &quot;What are you telling?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Nightlight&#39;s first reprogramation as predacon wasnt easy&quot;said dryly\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor&quot;That always confused me, usually It isnt a a lot trouble to\n&gt;&gt; reprogram a bot, with the exceptions of the Matrix bearers; In order to\n&gt;&gt; reprogram Rodimus, Hydras and Jhiaxus had to break him first; it was when\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight was recaptured, when i discovered why her spark wasnt easy to\n&gt;&gt; reprogram: Her spark is diferent, even her desing.

Stanton, I need to ask you a favor. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that I know is extremely difficult to accomplish, and one that \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;d\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never ask of you unless it was a dire need. I would like you to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attempt\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the delicate process of bringing my optic sensors back online. If \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work, I understand.
