Her smile broadened a bit more as she heard the remainder of his answer, the smile then replaced by an expression of serenity. To her his wagging tail only welcomed her further and she moved closer to him, coming up beside him but slightly back.\nHe knew that way back to his den better then she did, ready to follow him there and pick up where they left off.\nZyber sighed as she then raised her head to it�s normal position and raised her tail to wag a bit beside his, feeling more free now that her instincts relayed to her that there was no tension in the air.\nShe looked up at the sky and that the countless stars, laying her ears back and then erecting them again.\nThen looking back down towards Rowdy for a moment just to catch his eyes, then back up at the sky. *\n\n� It never matters how many times I look upon them, they always seem to be breathtakingly beautiful.�\n\n* She knew that it was off topic but she had never had another to share her interests and thoughts with, only the wild animals of the land and sea�who never seemed to answer back.\nZyber kept her eyes on the stars but was ready to move off whenever Rowdy was ready, waiting for him but also marveling at the lights in the sky. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
