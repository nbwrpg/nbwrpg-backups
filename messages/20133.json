She fell\n&gt; forward\n&gt; &gt; and landed on her hands and knees. She turned her head, looking at\n&gt; &gt; LadyHawk, &quot;Why? I thought you were a friend?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk looked down at Squizzy, &quot;I am a friend,  but I can&#39;t risk\n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; science being turned into a weapon. She lowered herself to finish\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; mongoose but hesitated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Squizzy, felt sick to her stomach and light headed. She couldn&#39;t\n&gt; understand,\n&gt; &gt; why was this bot\n&gt; &gt; of science attacking her. &quot;I wanted to see the nature bots too.&quot;\n&gt; She fell\n&gt; &gt; down and layed on her side. She felt disoriented and fearful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lady Hawk saw her error at the next moment. she couldn&#39;t let Zardus\n&gt; have the\n&gt; &gt; experiments, and she couldn&#39;t allow Squizzy to stay here either.\n&gt; she tried\n&gt; &gt; to pick her up when Najah attacked.Lady Hawk wasn&#39;t trained as a\n&gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; she was to wrapped up with Squizzy that she didn&#39;t see Najah until\n&gt; she was\n&gt; &gt; wrapped up in Najahs coils. Lady Hawk managed to get her talons up\n&gt; in time\n&gt; &gt; to block Najahs bite. Useing all her strength she held on for dear\n&gt; life,\n&gt; &gt; trying to break the snakes hold on her. &quot;Snakes were supposed to be\n&gt; eaten by\n&gt; &gt; hawks, not the other way around.&quot; she thought as the snakes bite\n&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; closer. She looked back towards Squizzy, she hoped the mongoose\n&gt; could handle\n&gt; &gt; the snake for her unfortunately Najah had other ideas. One of those\n&gt; ideas\n&gt; &gt; seemed to involve a Hawk dinner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Najah started crush Lady HAwk&#39;s body as if he were a phyton. Lady\n&gt; Hawk was\n&gt; &gt; beginning to feal like a recycled can. &quot;Would you stop already?\n&gt; we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be on the same side.&quot; Somehow she knew that Najah\n&gt; probably\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t care about sides. She tried to squirm with no effect. her\n&gt; only hope\n&gt; &gt; was that someone on the alliance would pull the snake off. Najah\n&gt; tried again\n&gt; &gt; to bite her knowing that his mortal poyson would  do all work. The\n&gt; half Hawk\n&gt; &gt; snapped forward trying to bite the snake. This creature needed to\n&gt; learn not\n&gt; &gt; to mess with royalty.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
