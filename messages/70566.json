That power&#39;s tryn&#39; ta reach somethn&#39; and I wonder if it&#39;s tryn&#39; ta \n&gt; reach Rodimus&#39;s core where his matrix was.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Before anyone could think, in his state of unconsciousness, Tucson extends \n&gt; his hand out as far as he can, hoping that it will touch upon Rodimus&#39;s \n&gt; hand, even if it were only his fingers.  He begins to talk in his sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Just - a hand - a - way.  Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He fights hard to extend his arm far enough to attempt to feel Rodimus&#39;s \n&gt; hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Torca looked at Perceptor for a long moment, &quot;Yes.&quot; he said finally,\n&gt;&gt; speaking more to Kup than to Perceptor. &quot;We shall wait for the repairs\n&gt;&gt; to be complete.&quot; He turned and looked at Kup and the others, &quot;Then we\n&gt;&gt; have many other things to discuss.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bantor walked up the hall towards where Eilta and the others were\n&gt;&gt; standing. looking at the repairs. It was becoming quite crowded in the\n&gt;&gt; observation room, all these maximals crowded into it to watch the\n&gt;&gt; progress. Even Lord Elder and Cheetor were watching, although they\n&gt;&gt; were simply monitoring it from the bridge of the ship rather than\n&gt;&gt; standing in the observation room.
