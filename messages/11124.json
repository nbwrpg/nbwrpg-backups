A smile develops on her lips as he approached her, enjoying the feeling of his arms going around her waist and holding her to him. \nShe eagerly welcomed his kiss with one of her own, pressing her lips to his but gently. Setting one arm upon his shoulder while the other rested on his chest-plate, slightly pressing her body to him.\nRelaxing in his arms but her muscles tensing when she felt his hand tighten around her, though, enjoying the feeling as well.\nBut with a reluctant sigh she leaned back, the smile still on her face. She would have liked her lips locked with him for the majority of the day, but she knew that it just wasn�t possible. *\n\n� So, keep busy while I was in repair?�\n\n* She stroked her fingers along the side of his neck, looking at him fondly and with love. She would love to spend all day with him, nothing to do but be with him and do whatever. But for some reason she felt like she was needed by her Maximals again, just like when Liono had disappeared and left her in command. (doesn�t know that he�s gone.)\nIt wasn�t a bad feeling, more of one of responsibility and duty. Nothing less then what she expected it to be.\nBut right now it was her time to be with him, a moment that they might not be able to have again for quite a bit.\nIron Raptor stroked her fingers along Prowl�s neck again before stepping close and resting her head against his shoulder-plate/ collar-plate, nuzzling against his neck for a moment.\nResting there she took in his scent, closing her optics and just glad to be somewhere where she would be able to leave the war and battles behind. Then opening them again, sighing and letting her breath trickle onto his throat.\nShe would stay there all day if she was permitted to, but she knew that there was probably a tone of things to do and check up on. \nNew home, new responsibilities.\nBut she would be in his arms for now, gathering in the new surroundings and glad that she wouldn�t be alone in this new experiences.*\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
