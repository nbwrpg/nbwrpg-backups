She raised \nher head as she sniffed the air, her animal instincts beginning to take \nover. Her eyes closed to meer slits as she slowly stalked through and around \nthe trees in a very wolf-like fashion.\n\nHer tail stopped twitching and her steps were sure and calculated. She \nlooked as if she knew what she was doing, and perhaps she did, for once. \nTavatron growled under her breath as she caught a scent, something wounded \nwas nearby. She watched as Dinobot headed in the direction of the scent, so \nhe had scneted the wounded beast as well. Tavatron stopped walking as she \ncame to the stream, her com chirped and beeped as Iron Raptor&#39;s voice echoed \nthrough the forest.\n\nTavatron sighed, partially in relief but in actuallity was dissapointed that \nthe hunt had been cut short, again. The same thing had happened last time, \nalways when they were trying to eat! Tavatron activated her wrist unit:\n\n&quot;We&#39;re on our way, Tavatron out.&quot; Tavatron then turned to Dinobot, he was \nmoving along the bank towards the wounded creature, just thinking about it \nmade her mouth water, she really was hungry. Tavatron activated her com \nagain, so much for hunting:\n\n&quot;Looks like we&#39;re gonna have to cut our hunt short, we&#39;ve been ordered back \nto base.&quot; Tavatron gazed at herself in the still waters, perhaps she could \nstill come away with something...\n\nTavatron plunged her head into the icy water and closed her jaws about a \nrather large trout. She tossed it on the bank, her head dripping with water. \nShe placed one paw on the flopping fish as she waited for its movement to \ncease. She looked over at Dinobot, maybe she couldn&#39;t hunt but fishing was \nanother story!\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
