In his \nnew form, the \n&gt; wolf humanoid/beast dragon. \n&gt; \n&gt; Waiting for all this to get over with. She actually, hoped for a \nlittle more \n&gt; time to be near Hydras. It was sad that all these years, all these \nmillenia, \n&gt; she rarely had such an opportunity. & now that she had a great \nopportunity, it \n&gt; was still a rarity to be with him. She wondered how much of \nHydras, what parts \n&gt; of Megatron & what parts of Galvatron had the actual feelings for \nher. Was it \n&gt; something recent? Was it something that stayed hidden for a long \ntime. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pushing it all aside, Hydras was right, duty first... pleasure \nlater.\n\n\n"}}
