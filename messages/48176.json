Or are you gonna waste more\n&gt; of both our times...&quot; She\n&gt; quite firmly believed the latter and readied herself\n&gt; for the next attack, he\n&gt; tried sword, he tried grenade, he&#39;d either go for a\n&gt; grapple to limit her\n&gt; speed or a projectile for which she could only\n&gt; dodge. Then again, this bot\n&gt; hadn&#39;t shown much wisdom in his attacks so far,\n&gt; playing off his rage was\n&gt; easy but if she wasn&#39;t careful she&#39;d eventually slip\n&gt; up.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
