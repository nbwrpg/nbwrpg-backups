The beings there notice the signal \nand go to analyze it.\n\nBatuk: VECTOR EARTH?!? HOW CAN ANYONE OF THEIR KIND DARE TO TOUCH THAT \nSOIL AGAIN?\n\nRekis: Calm down. They must be a new crew this time. The one who \ntouched the sphere has never been encountered before. However, we must \nact to preserve the vector from more damages.\n\nBatuk: Maybe so, but our last intervention brought no difference in \ntheir conflict.\n\nRekis: Unit Tigerhawk has been destroyed by the Nemesis, but the \nwarship has been sunk for a long time. We have analyzed them and we \nknow how to generate more of their kind. What I suggest is that we \nsend a unit to the vector&#39;s satellite and that we activate it if \nanother sphere is discovered.\n\nBatuk: We must make it powerful and devoid of what they call their \n&quot;spark&quot;. This is the reason we lost Unit Tigerhawk. I will give it a \nsoul of it&#39;s own.\n\nRekis generated a design and Batuk generated its soul.\n\nRekis: Rise, Meteara, go on Moon and wait for their next disturbance \nto go down on Vector Earth and righten our plans!\n\nThe female robot stood (as much as she could in this vaporous world), \nactivated her thrusters and flew off.\n\nMeteara: Yes masters! I will rid the Vector of the Cybertronian \npresence!\n\n\n"}}
