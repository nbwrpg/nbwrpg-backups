The \n&gt; planet destroyer gave Megatron a choice: become Unicron&#39;s slave or \n&gt; die.  The bastard threw away his sanity and the lives of many strong, \n&gt; loyal Decepticons to become Galvatron.  Unicron made him some new \n&gt; troops from the ashes of the old, and he took over leadership of the \n&gt; Decepticons, keeping most of his power even after Unicron was \n&gt; destroyed.  He kept us all in line by sheer terror.  After the \n&gt; reformat, he was exiled for his crimes.  Now reduced to a blacklisted \n&gt; Predacon criminal, Galvatron was forced to use mind-altering control \n&gt; chips to gain followers.  I was one of these.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Empath pauses for a moment, then continues.  &quot;Meanwhile, another \n&gt; Predacon took the name of Megatron and sought to steal enough energon \n&gt; to conquer Cybertron for himself.  A group of Maximals captured him \n&gt; and his crew and brought them back.  Some careless guards allowed him \n&gt; to escape with a new crew and he came here.  Galvatron also found his \n&gt; way here, with me still enslaved to his blasted Galvapred chip.  \n&gt; While here, I found an artifact which set me free.  Galvatron ended \n&gt; up fusing with Megatron, and the rest you know.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n&quot;I see,&quot; before she can say any more, she received a transmission from \nHydras:\n\n&gt; After that Hydras send an encoded message to Maxima.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maxima,\n&gt; If you&#39;re inside Maximal&#39;s base you have to wait a while before do \n&gt; your mission. If you&#39;re now out or around, move quickly far of it. A \n&gt; cloud is around the base but it&#39;s the Plague. Be careful. As soon as \n&gt; you&#39;re far of Maximal Base&#39;s area  go to this area (gives a \n&gt; coordinates) and call me when you arrive there. Good luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras&quot;\n&gt; \n\nThis slightly stunned her of his concern.
