Enough\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for these two brothers in arms. They both jumped out of the\n&gt; shuttle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only to combine and transformed into a compact but heavily\n&gt; equiped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transport chopper. Rapdly they rise up in the sky to be cover\n&gt; by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cloud scanning for pursuier while keeping a safe distance\n&gt; from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shutte.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor watched as the chopper exited the shuttle and for a\n&gt; moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he almost thought he had been discovered. But when he saw the\n&gt; Chopper\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assume a watching posture he relaxed and continued to mirror\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movements of the shuttle maintained his shielding. The time was\n&gt; &gt; not yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ripe for attack, but when the time came . . .  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He did a mental inventory of his weapns and smiled inwardly as\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continued to fly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Yes, I was thinking of Star Trek as well when writing my\n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pose.
