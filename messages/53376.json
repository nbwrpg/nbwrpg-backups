I never felt\n&gt;safe opening my own mind to anyone else - it makes me vulnerable.\n&gt;Whether you realized it or not at the time, you could have trapped me\n&gt;under your direct control forever.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airshadow Nightstar&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Windlord::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord Opened his mind and he could feel the pain and sorrow the\n&gt;EMphath\n&gt; &gt; felt. He could understand all, after he saw all her life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Empath&quot; thought Windlord while the compassion and his love\n&gt;arrose &quot;How did\n&gt; &gt; you suffer, my dear Empath...&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Empath::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The most direct route has usually worked best for Empath.  She\n&gt;turns\n&gt; &gt; &gt;toward Windlord and gently places her hands on either side of his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;head.  &quot;It&#39;s easier to show you than tell you,&quot; she says.  &quot;Try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;relax - I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;She reaches out with her mind, drawing Windlord&#39;s feelings for her\n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the surface.  Empath&#39;s gratified to learn that her initial\n&gt;assessment\n&gt; &gt; &gt;was correct, but she&#39;s not done.  Briefly, she opens her own mind\n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the Maximal, allowing him to see all she&#39;s seen - from her creation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;millions of years ago, through the Great War, to the pain of losing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Skywarp to Galvatron&#39;s selfish machinations.  She shows him the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;reformatting, when she became a predacon trapped under Galvatron&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;control; finding the Soul Orb and accidentally freeing herself; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;finally, she shows the recent events that have drawn them to this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;moment - and the fact that her own emotions mirror his.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCharla con tus amigos en lï¿½nea mediante MSN Messenger: \nhttp://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n\n\n"}}
