All beings not of \nthis world are ordered to report to my ship to unconditionally \nsurrender or Be hunted down like the animals you transform into, You \nhave six hours to comply or I will do this the hard way. He paused \nhoping for a quick response, &quot;I do hope you prefer the hard way.&quot; he \nlanded by his ship and waited for the flocks of bots to return and \nsurrender.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; To celebrate my first Thanksgiving with all my cyber friends and \n&gt; enemies I decided to celebrate by introduceing the newest, meanest \n&gt; most unstopable character ever created in this game. A character \nthat \n&gt; should bring all our forces together against a common foe. I&#39;ll be \n&gt; posting tomorrow morning and tomorrow night to decide who gets the \n&gt; honors. So Without further ado I Give you The Bird\n&gt; \n&gt; A Prison ship lands somewhere near Turkey. It scanned the planet as \n&gt; it came to rest and found a compatable life form. Bounty stepped \n&gt; before a reflective surface toadmire himself. He transformed into a \n&gt; plump juicy turkey. &quot;Is this the mighty beast this planet has to \n&gt; offer?&quot; He pecked at the surface scratching it mutating his \n&gt; reflection. He stepped outside to begin his search. He scanned the \n&gt; area. &quot;These bots are definitely guilty of illegal time altering \nand \n&gt; temporal shifting. Additional charges for murder, deletion, \nplanetary \n&gt; growth interference, and littering. Most of the charges are minor \nbut \n&gt; littering can&#39;t be allowed on any planet. For this the penalty is \n&gt; Death.&quot; the enraged prison bot charged off to find the criminals \n&gt; responsible for the crimes. &quot;This planet is a real Cornicopia of \n&gt; crime, I may have to pick them up by the necks, spin them around \n&gt; until they no longer function then serve them up on a silver \nplatter \n&gt; with all the sides before the judge.&quot; He was ticked at the \n&gt; lawbreakers on the planet for interupting him in the middle of \ndinner \n&gt; while he sat watching the annual cyber-ball game on his \nholoset. &quot;The \n&gt; judge will say thanks while giving them them life, roasting in \nthier \n&gt; own juices. Then whatever,s leftover he&#39;ll sanwich in an airtight \n&gt; space, maybe even freeze them for a while. Any way he looks at it \n&gt; it&#39;ll be a day to remember.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK, enough bad puns, who wants a piece of this turkey?\n\n\n"}}
