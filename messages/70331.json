Although firing wildly Tuscon still manages to hit one of\nthe approaching insectoid troops, causing it to stall for a moment.\nHowever as it was one of Tuscon&#39;s comparatively smaller weapons it was\nnot enough to stop it completely, although the creature&#39;s armor is\nburnt and dented from the impact!.\n\n[Insect Trooper #2 is Hit By Tuscon] - Insect Trooper is now Moderately damaged]\n\n&quot;We are the Horde.&quot; the troopers say in unison, &quot;Your energon will\nonly feed us and your technological distinctiveness will be added to\nour own.&quot;\n\nThey continue forward, all of them several meters in front of Tuscon.\nWith uncanny precision, and in unison they raise their scorpion-like\ntails and unleash their relentless firepower on Tuscon as the group\nrides inside or on top, for the moment safe from their onslaught.\n\nFortunately most of the shots either miss, or bounce harmlessly off of\nhis armor. However the larger one&#39;s powerful energy strike actually\npenetrated Tuscon&#39;s armor, biting slightly into his grill plating!\n\n[Tuscon Hit By Insect Trooper #1] - Stopped by armor\n[Tuscon Missed By Insect Trooper #2]\n[Tuscon Hit By Insect Trooper #3] - Stopped By Armor\n[Tuscon Hit By Insect Trooper #4] - Stopped By Armor\n[Tuscon Missed By Insect Trooper #5]\n[Tuscon Missed By Insect Trooper #6]\n\n[Tuscon Hit By Elite Insect Trooper #1] - Tuscon is now Lightly Damaged\n\nOOC: Is this clear enough for you guys?
