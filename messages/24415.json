Suddenly Valtron got \nthe uper hand. He raised his sword on high. But in that instant Galvatron \nsliced his sword through Valtron. &quot;We are one once more.&quot;Galvatron said in a \nraspy voice. he embraced  Valtron. A dark Light burst from the scene. \nSuddenly Valtrons body in the real world craked and an black purple glow \nshown from inbetween  the cracks. Suddenly he became a egg type figure. One \ndiffrence. Claws extended from the dark shell and burrowed deep in the earth. \nAbout to the mantel layer of the earth&#39;s crust. It would hybernate there \nuntil it was rerady to begin its search for pure perfection.\n\n"}}
