He wasn&#39;t hurt to bad from the realatively weak blasts, but\nthey were \n&gt; chipping away, and doing damage and eventually they would be quite\nhinderful.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired three fire balls from his mouth, one at Shivah, one at\nWespah, and \n&gt; one at Element (g).\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising his free hand, a black sphere of destructive energy formed\nand shot \n&gt; out with the power of two missiles at the Element (starship).\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot was slowly but surely bein repaired by the near stasis\nlocked First \n&gt; Aid.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades avoided the fire ball and fired off twenty-five highly\nexplosive \n&gt; shells at Darkfate, being struck by six of Darkfate&#39;s blast and\ncrashing into \n&gt; the ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Imprisoner avoided most of the shots except for a dozen rapid ones\nthat dug \n&gt; into already damaged areas and hurt non-essential computer\ncomponents.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired off a total of four missiles, two from two cannons.  Two at\nthe \n&gt; Element (starship), and two at Rixer.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; He leapt out of the way of most of the blasts, some shrapnel digging\ninto his \n&gt; right forearm.  &quot;Slaggers.&quot; Predator raised his launcher, firing off\ntwo \n&gt; missiles at the Element (starship).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Choran rolled out of the way of most of the shots, a plasma bolt\ngrazing his \n&gt; neck.  He raised his own rifle, firing in an arc.  Five laser blasts\nat \n&gt; Wespah, five at Darkfate, and fifteen at Element (gestalt).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave easily spotted Truttle looking in his direction and flew\nhard right \n&gt; before he event had his weapons aimed, flying out of the way of all\nthe shots \n&gt; coming towards him, avoiding the missiles as well.  He raised his\nleft arm, \n&gt; the barrel at the end of the hand spouting out three laser beams at\nTruttle.  \n&gt; He raised the other arm, firing off two rockets from the missile\nlauncher at \n&gt; the Element (starship).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron flew out of the way of most shots, blocking the others with\nhis ever \n&gt; weakening arm-shield.  He raised his rifle, firing off four bolts. \nTwo at \n&gt; Dollon and two at Drillbit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Surrender weak Predacons, you inferior beings cannot defeat a\nDecepticon, \n&gt; even if there were five of you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter avoided the missiles easily, powering up his engines\neven more \n&gt; blasting away from Blyer, being too high up to be affected by\nshrapnel.\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired off a pair of rockets at the Element (starship), and\nchanged his \n&gt; position, firing off twenty-five rapid laser blasts from his\nnosecone weapon \n&gt; at Element (gestalt)&#39;s torso.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Double Punch still felt the electricity flow through him as systems\nbegan \n&gt; shutting down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeline the cyberbee fired off another twenty-five rapid laser\nbolts, this \n&gt; time at EndBringer&#39;s neck and face, at an angle that would send the\nlaser \n&gt; bolts in a direction that would make it so they wouldn&#39;t hit Double\nPunch at \n&gt; all.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Injector avoided most of the shots fired at him some digging into\nhis legs \n&gt; painfully.  Raising both stinger missile launchers.  He fired off\ntwo from \n&gt; each.  All four headed for the Element (starship).  He especially\navoided the \n&gt; vines not only because he was in constant movement but because he is\nover 300 \n&gt; feet in the air.  (Nice try Yan)\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Manterror barely managed to avoid all the shots fired at him, firing\noff two \n&gt; ion disks from each arm.  All four heading for the abdomen of\nElement \n&gt; (gestalt).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement avoided all the shots fired at him except Darkfate&#39;s shots,\nseveral \n&gt; of them digging into his right arm that he blocked them with. \n&quot;Heathens...&quot; \n&gt; he cursed through a gritted mouth.  He raised both arms, firing a\nmissile \n&gt; from each.  Both heading for the Element (gestalt).\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher avoided all the things fired at him except a few plasma\nblasts \n&gt; from the Element that dug into his knee.  He cursed as he saw a\nsmall crack.  \n&gt; He raised his arms, firinga missile from each.  Two in total heading\nfor the \n&gt; Element.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector avoided most of the shots, several deepening an already\nbad wound.  \n&gt; He cursed painfully, no longer able to hide it.  He raised both\narms, two \n&gt; missiles, one from a single tube each.  Both missiles streaked out\nfor the \n&gt; Element.  The other two tubes launched a sphere of plasma energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two plasma spheres streaked out towards Element&#39;s (gestalt) left\nshoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sixshot easily avoided the missiles, not even bothering tracking\nthem as they \n&gt; plummeted and exploded agains the ground, only deepening old\ncraters.\n&gt; \n&gt; He armed his weapons, firing off two missiles at the Element\n(starship), and \n&gt; five rapid laser bolts at Element&#39;s (getsalt) left foot.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Ares avoided everything except some missile shrapnel which dug into\nhis wings \n&gt; but were realitively harmless.  He armed his weapons and fired off\ntwo \n&gt; missiles at the Element (starship), and got into a position to fire\nten rapid \n&gt; laser bolts off at Prowl (if he&#39;s still at the battle).\n\n\n"}}
