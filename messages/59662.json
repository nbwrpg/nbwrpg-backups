Which is near impossible. Second, get someone to \ncarry the virus to him, then download it to his mainframe processors. \nGood luck.&quot;  She sipped from her cup, and went to get a refill. &quot;Hmm, \nhere&#39;s a thought. Perhaps since there aren&#39;t any black holes in this \nsector, we could make one. All we have to do is to make a small \nsphere of metal and launch it out into space. Then, we give it a \nlarge electromagnit and throw it into full power. With a large \nexplosion from some powerful raw energon, it will give it enough \nforce to collapse in on itself and poof, a blackhole will emerge. The \ncatch is to create it so far out that this planet won&#39;t be effected.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bustercross365&quot; &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice chuckled.  \n&gt; &lt;So she and I have more in common than I originally thought.&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, you are a manufactured Transmetal 2.  We have the ability to \n&gt; heal, to an extent at least.  So, if we can draw him to a quantum \n&gt; singularity with the appropriate bait, we can bag us a \nChaosbringer.  \n&gt; But there are no blackholes in this sector.  The best bet would \nsend \n&gt; him through another sub space instability.  Or...&quot;\n&gt; He thought a moment as he took another drink from his mug.\n&gt; &quot;... give him a virus.  Cause his space fold system to crash and he \n&gt; can&#39;t move in space.  Or sabotage his energy refinery.  Our options \n&gt; are not very favorable, even for me.&quot;\n&gt; He thought more on the subject, taking another drink from his mug. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&gt; &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   She grinned. &quot;My turn huh. WEll, first off, wolves are not \nbounty \n&gt; &gt; hunters in the same way your thinking. But hunters we are. As for \na \n&gt; &gt; secret I possess, I will tell you one thing. It doesn&#39;t take two \nto \n&gt; &gt; keep a secret.&quot;  She grinned and sipped her drink. &quot;However, I do \n&gt; &gt; believe in returning a favor for a favor. First off, Yes, I am \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; another dimension. How I got here or why I&#39;m here is beyond my \n&gt; mental \n&gt; &gt; processors. However, I do know what will tempt Unicron. IT&#39;s \nthree \n&gt; &gt; things he can&#39;t resist. Energy, knowledge and metal.  HE uses \nmetal \n&gt; &gt; to rejuvinate himself, energy for the same reasons we need it, \nand \n&gt; &gt; knowledge. He wants to be a god. Better than the matrix. He \nthinks \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s the smartest thing out there and that he knows everything \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; is to know except the future. But since he&#39;s almost invincable, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t care about attacks from smaller enemies. He&#39;s too big to \n&gt; &gt; stop. However, he can still be outsmarted. Ever hear of something \n&gt; &gt; called a BlackHole?  I did it once before in my universe. We had \n&gt; &gt; rigged something to make Unicron think we had found the EYE OF \nTHE \n&gt; &gt; MATRIX.  It lets one see into the past, present and future. He \n&gt; wanted \n&gt; &gt; it so bad, he followed me into a black hole. I made it by chance \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; the other end. He was way to big to fit through the small Quazar \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; was stuck forever. So, now you have info on me.&quot; She \ngrinned, &quot;Oh, \n&gt; &gt; and one more little thing, if you want a secret about me. I am \nmade \n&gt; &gt; of a substance called Zianium. It&#39;s stronger and more duable than \n&gt; &gt; Transmetal. But unlike metal, it can, ah, heal itself. LIke a \ntrue \n&gt; &gt; organic can heal from a wound or sickness. And, I have a \nsubstance \n&gt; &gt; similar to the organic liquid called blood. It&#39;s thicker and has \na \n&gt; &gt; blue color, but it&#39;s not just mech fluid. I was one of seven like \n&gt; &gt; myself. We were the prototypes. But, well, &quot;  she looked at her \n&gt; &gt; drink. &quot;Never mind anyway, favor returned. Find something to look \n&gt; &gt; like an EYE OF THE MATRIX and lure Unicron into a black hole. \nHe&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; fall in and your rid of him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
