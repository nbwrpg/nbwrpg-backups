Why wouldn&#39;t they just kill him? He\nleaned up against the wall and fell to the floor. These Maximals had no\ncompassion! And they thought the Predacons were evil? He would be better off\nwith the Matrix than without life. Without a life, or without life. He would\nchoose the first over the latter. But with no weapons, and not enough power\nto kil himself, it was just a matter of starving himself or hoping that a\nfew thousand years will pass quickly and he can die of old age. But running\nout of energy would be the quicker, yet more painful way of death. He hoped\nthe Matrix would forgive something like suicide. The Maximals might do\nsomething to stop it, to keep him in here for as long as he lived, which if\nthey stopped him from killing himself, would be a long time at his young\nage...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, September 24, 2000 5:48 PM\nSubject: Re: Big Post\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; (Ok, I&#39;ll leave it at where you are, Feline and HotRod, forget Skulletron)\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Skulletron/Sickle::\n&gt;\n&gt;      Skulletron dodged Chordate&#39;s two shots, and some autogun shots, but\nhe\n&gt; was hit in the back by Smokescreen.\n&gt;\n&gt;      He fell on his knees, and then the rest of his body fell down.

You can&#39;t post people being knocked out,\neven\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; a little while. I don&#39;t know if you wanna rewrite your post, but I&#39;m\ngoing\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; respond to before Skulletron ran off. And if you&#39;re going to run out of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; bridge, let me respond before you go somewhere in one post. The defences\n&gt; &gt; would be firing at you continuoustly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/Ramulus/Shredder/Striker/Proto/Chordate/Smokescreen::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the room, Zardus turns to Sickle, frowning when he saw it as a\n&gt; fish.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m Zardus, Alliance commander,&quot; he says to the fish, wondering if his\n&gt; &gt; circuits were breaking down, &quot;You are?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus looks down at SnowCat, grinning as color returns to his face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You try flying up there, see how you feel!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Shredder walks out of the Destron bace and looks at the two new bots,\n&gt; &gt; sighing. This was getting on his nerves, the constant interruptions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Who are you two?&quot; he asks, looking them over.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Striker paced back and forth in his cell. He had to warn the Maximals,\nhe\n&gt; &gt; just had to! He growls, trying to think of a way. He hoped that Ramulus\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; be smart enough to see through the trap, and to be carefull.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Striker frowns at the door, starting to think of something.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Proto looks up at Necromancer. Proto&#39;s chest was melted and leaking\n&gt; mechfluid\n&gt; &gt; at a quick rate, his left foot looked like it had been slammed with\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; big, and there was gashes all over his arms from tree branches.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, would you mind giving me a lift too?&quot; he asks. He hated requesting\n&gt; &gt; help, but there was no way he&#39;d make it 1000 miles back to base.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Chordate throws himself to the left, Skulletron&#39;s shot shooting off his\n&gt; ear\n&gt; &gt; and leaving a leaking, melted spot in his cranium. He jumps forward,\n&gt; feeling\n&gt; &gt; a bit dizzy, and spins around, firing two shots at Skulletron.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Smokescreen enters the bridge, instantly pulling out his gun as he sees\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; battle. He runs inside, firing at Skulletron.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
