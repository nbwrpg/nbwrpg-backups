A good friend always knows what his \n&gt; comrade is thinking, and no matter how saddened one is, he can always feel \n&gt; good that he has friends standing beside him.  It&#39;s very good to know I \n&gt; have you and the others for support. I should consider myself very lucky \n&gt; to be a part of a powerful merger of factions.  Now, Rodimus&#39;s health is \n&gt; declining, and I have more than enough spark to share.  I think it is time \n&gt; that you allow me to attempt a form of energy transfusion.  It may be his \n&gt; only hope of recovery.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He establishes a com link to Stanton and Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stanton, Legacy, I am more than honored to have you working so diligantly \n&gt; on saving Rodimus Prime, and now it is my turn to give something back in \n&gt; exchange for the undaunting dedication you are showing our factions.  My \n&gt; spark has more than enough power to transfuse energy from my body into \n&gt; his.  Not to worry, I will not go off line.  It may be our only hope of \n&gt; saving Rodimus Prime.  It is not a request, it is my order.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As everyone leaves the medical bay itself Santon, Bump and Legacy get\n&gt;&gt; to work on Rodimus Prime. They quickly began to carefully strip away\n&gt;&gt; the tendrils or tentacle like things that sit on top of his frame.\n&gt;&gt; Carefully, one by one they scan each one and then carefully cut it so\n&gt;&gt; that it do as little damage as possible to Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; So now that the Autobots are few in numbers, you think you can just \n&gt;&gt; &gt; take\n&gt;&gt; &gt; over this universe as if you were an unstoppable deity. You&#39;ve harmed \n&gt;&gt; &gt; far\n&gt;&gt; &gt; too many of those I care for. And what you&#39;ve done to Rodimus,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightlight, Windlord and Perceptor, are inexcuseable. You have no right\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to the power you seek, and I will see to it that you never get your \n&gt;&gt; &gt; hands\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on it. You think you are powerful just because you have Megatron and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Galvatron&#39;s strength within your spark? That means nothing because you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t got what truely matters, and that kind of power is not given, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; earned. I will face you Hydras, I swear by the name of Primus himself, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will face you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Not one word comes out of Tucson&#39;s mouth, yet he begins to crack his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knuckles audibly as he always does when losing his temper.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Tuscon talked Noctorro and Airhammer come walking into the\n&gt;&gt; observation chamber, Noctorro having to bend his head slightly to\n&gt;&gt; avoid hitting his horns on the top of the door frame.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You will not face Hydras alone commander Tuscon.&quot; Silverbolt said. He\n&gt;&gt; had been standing in the room from before Tuscon had entered, his\n&gt;&gt; optics never leaving Rodimus&#39; frame. His arms were crossed over his\n&gt;&gt; chest, his optics focused and bright as they looked through the\n&gt;&gt; window. He spoke without turning, &quot;We fuzors stand with you.&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; quietly, his voice low with that air of dramatics that always seemed\n&gt;&gt; to be a part of him. &quot;The black villany that has been worked on\n&gt;&gt; Rodimus must be avenged.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Noctorro and Airhammer nodded as they stood next to Silverbolt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;is all Alright?&quot;said dryly the Predacon whe sensed that something \n&gt;&gt; &gt; unusual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was happening to Tucson Prime.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kup looked at Tucson and waited his answetr as well as Talon\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From inside the medical chamber a small alarm began to beep, and\n&gt;&gt; Legacy&#39;s voice could be heard, &quot;Rodimus Prime&#39;s vitals are continuing\n&gt;&gt; to decline. We need to move with greater haste.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I am a doctor, not a miracle worker.&quot; Bump could be heard grumbling\n&gt;&gt; as they all began to work faster on Rodimus, some of the tendrils lay\n&gt;&gt; on the floor, but many more still lay attached to him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;TAG&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
