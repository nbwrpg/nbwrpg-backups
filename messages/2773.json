Declaring Iron Raptor leader is something you have \nno authority to do, it&#39;d have to be done through the RPG.\n\n::Zardus/Zenyak::\n\nZardus recieves Punch&#39;s transmission. For once he was thankfull that \nDevilDuer had caused him to set his comm-link to play back messages only in \nhis head, or he&#39;d have a lot of trouble explaining that statement to the \npredacons in front of him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZenyak falls behind a boulder, cursing whoever descovered fire beams. He rubs \nhis leg, slightly thankful for the ice that Dracona had shot at him, which \nwas cooling the wound.\n\nHe growls, looking at the crowd with the giant bot in the middle of them.\n\nIt was time to leave, he could see that, the maximals should soon start \nfiring on each other.\n\nHe smiles. He couldn&#39;t possibly leave without a goodbye gift. Zenyak takes \nout a photon grenade.\n\nChuckling, the predacon pulls the pin and throws it into the middle of Iron \nRaptor and company, turning to run like his life depended on it and ducking \nhis head as he hears the grenade explode.\n\nFinally detecting Zenyak, the autoguns open fire.\n\n"}}
