Tucson was ready for&lt;br&gt;&gt; any=\r\nthing, but now his own stability could possibly be tested this day.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The dark voice chuckled, a deep raspy =\r\nvoice, &quot;I don&#39;t believe I have given&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you a choice. You wi=\r\nll lay down your weapons or you will loose more than&lt;br&gt;&gt; your companion=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The sound of the metal scraping on metal can be hea=\r\nrd. &quot;Optimus, Hound,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bluestreak . . . &quot; the voice echoes =\r\nslightly as if the speaker is in a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; large&lt;br&gt;&gt; room, it trailed=\r\n off ominously.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Who are you?&quot;demanded Perceptor whose still show=\r\ned a cold blood&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; A quiet voice =\r\ncame over the speakers, &quot;You have forgotten me Perceptor, so&lt;br&gt;&gt; s=\r\noon?&quot; There was a chuckle, &quot;Ahhh, but then we never had a chance =\r\nto truly&lt;br&gt;&gt; get to know each other.&quot; There was a short pause and =\r\nthen the voice said,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perhaps we will soon enough.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Talon a Windlord were shocked and they didnt knew what to do.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Hydras was slighty surpriced but waited to know more, he typed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to Cyclonus, using a secret channel, in order to find it out&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; what goin on&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Cyclonus sent=\r\n a quiet message back. &quot;It is Nightrazor, one of the soldiers &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; I&lt;br&gt;&gt; brought with me. He is a Ninja assassin, with many skills.&quot=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Back at the Ark, Quickstride was also becoming highly suspicious =\r\nas to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what was happening. He knew now that he had to try and keep =\r\nin touch with&lt;br&gt;&gt; Stanton and the others, inside the Ark. He now resort=\r\ns to his com link.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Quickstride ta Stanton, =\r\nover, what&#39;s gon&#39; on in there? I&#39;m not likn&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thiis=\r\n. Maaan, I wish Uproar was still around.... I kinda miss the way he&#39;d&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; claw metal doors ta shreads.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; There is a pause and then Stanton&#39;s voice comes in a fierce =\r\nwhisper, &quot;I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; don&#39;t know. The power is out, and Nightlight =\r\nis barely alive. This piece &lt;br&gt;&gt; of&lt;br&gt;&gt; scrap is holding her hostag=\r\ne!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bump cut in, &quot;I don&#39;t know what has happe=\r\nned to Elita.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; As Santon and Bump talked another voic=\r\ne cut in, this one over the Autobot&lt;br&gt;&gt; and Maximal channels, it was he=\r\navily encrypted &quot;Stall them!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; It was Rodimus&#39;=\r\n voice, and he was speaking rapidly. &quot;I think I have a way &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\no&lt;br&gt;&gt; get us out of this! I have rounded up the Fuzors that were on pat=\r\nrol. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Stall&lt;br&gt;&gt; as long as you can!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; A sma=\r\nll stone hit Quickstride in the back! &quot;Quickstride!&quot; Rodimus&#39;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; whispered, it is obvious he was the one that threw it to get his =\r\nattention&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Come this way.&quot; He was some distance away, wav=\r\ning him over to him.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
