Another was close by, per\nher scanners.  She could tell they were Maximals, so she did not see\nany harm in revealing herself to them.  She swooped down, transformed\ninto bot mode and landed on her two feet.  She stood only 4 feet tall,\ncoming up to Wolfblade&#39;s shoulders.  Her white and gold skin shined\nglittered in the varying light play from the forest. She looked up at\nWolfblade. Her large optics still gave her an owl quality even though\nshe was in bot mode. &quot;Salutations.&quot;\n\nWOlfblade::\n&quot;Saluwhat?&quot;\n\nSilence::\n&quot;Salutations. Greetings. Hello. Gondrack. Kwitchateekee. Ah, Hi\nthere.&quot; She said with a slight tremble in her voice. Some of her\nsystems were still sorting themselves out from the long slumber. \n\nWolfblade::\n&quot;Lady, I only understood two to three words you just said. But since\nyou said them, Hello yourself. I&#39;m Wolfblade, from the Maximal base.\nWe got your signal and came to get you. Glad to see we made it before\nthe Predacons did.&quot;\n\nSilence::\n&quot;Predacons still thrive then? I was hoping the confict would have been\nresolved by now. But then again, preds are very resilliant bots.&quot;\n\nWolfblade::\n&quot;Yeah, and you can&#39;t get rid of them either.&quot; she said with a chuckle.\nShe was a warrior. Fancy words never did her fit for her. She looked\nat Silence and knew she wouldn&#39;t stand a chance in hand to hand\ncombat. Really petite body frame, small form, probably has that ultra\nlight weight transmetal as well. But a recon bot, now she found\nherself thinking of attack patterns and ways to deal with Unicron and\nthe Preds. She shook her head to regain focus. She turned and looked\nfor Malice. It was then a slight twinge of jealousy reared it&#39;s head.\nAnother femmebot to contend with. OH well, she knew what she had to\ndo, so it didn&#39;t make a difference really. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
