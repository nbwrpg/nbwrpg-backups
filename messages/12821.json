When he opened his eyes, he \nsaw \n&gt; that Fliq had gotten out of the chamber.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, you made it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry about what you did. It&#39;s okay.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thanks. I was really worried. But today we have a mission. We have \n&gt; to go to the Cybertronian Fire and get a space shuttle. That&#39;s what \n&gt; were going to use to go get the parts of the ship. If you could \nstart \n&gt; working on this CR Chamber, I have to go find Spears.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix walks around the Ark for a few minutes until he found Spears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Spears, hey. Fliq and I are going to get the shuttle now. If you \n&gt; could do an appraisal on the Ark and make a list of what you need, \nwe \n&gt; might be able to leave tomorrow. And better tell Striker to get \n&gt; troops. We don&#39;t know if their will be another attack.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix heads back to Fliq.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So how you doin?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Got it up 3% power. I&#39;ll work more when we come back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fliq and Brix exit the Ark, turn on their jet packs and head for \nthe \n&gt; CF.\n\n\n"}}
