This is a fine idea! We will over power the other three and move \nto where the other Predacons are!&quot; Grappler hissed happily. He went to his \nhip and pulled forth a small pistol. \n    Aerostreak laughed with evil glee. &quot;This will be perfect! If we come with \nenemy prisoners, then we will be greatly regaruded! No doubt we will be \nwelcome.&quot; He too pulled out a gun just as Guanatix slipped from a nearby \nbranch.\n    &quot;I think you two are genius&#39;!&quot; She said, transforming and, also, pulled \nout a pistol. &quot;Besides, the others are weak.&quot;\n    &quot;Then its agreed. We will destroy the camp, take the Maximals as \nprisoners, and relocate to the Predacon fortress, if there is one.&quot; Aerostrak \nsaid. The other nodded, and then began to head back to camp.\n\n    Nighteyes, Aquarious, and Paddletail watched as the three others emerged \nfrom the jungle, carrying guns. This was very strange because they never used \nthere guns. It was one of the rules they established in the beggining.\n    &quot;I dont like this. They look....there eyes are filled with anger.&quot; \nNighteyes said. Paddletail and Aquarious agreed.\n    As the others got closer, Nighteyes began to panic, as did her commrads. \nAerostreak then raised his gun, pointed it towrds the campfire, and sent a \nblast streaking towrds them.\n    Nighteyes, Aquarious, and Paddletail jumped away. Grappler and Gunantix \nthen began to set ablaze the huts. Nighteyes grabbed Paddletail and brought \nhim close.\n    &quot;We have to get out of here! I dont know whats going on, but we have to \nget out of here now!&quot; She screamed. Aquarious was already running into the \nsafety of the jungle.\n    Paddletail agreed, and along with Nighteyes, dashed for the jungle. The \nthree met and ran as hard and as fast as they could from the evil that had \novertaken there brothers and sister.\n    &quot;Victory! Now, after them! Aerostreak, dont let them get away! Grappler, \nprepare a net.&quot; Gunatix yelled as she began the pursuit.\n    The hawlk took to the sky in his warrior mode, keeping a close eye on the \nrunaways. Grappler followed Guanatix who was only a few meters behinde the \nMaximals. She gave the signal and he launched a net, captureing Nighteyes and \nAquarious.\n    Aerostreak then sent two optic laser sreaking down at Paddletail who fell \nto the ground with a broken leg. He swooped down, grabbed him, and returned \nto the burning camp.\n\n    &quot;That was very bold. But, your our prisoners now. Paddletail will help \nGrappler construct a raft that will take all of us to the mainland.&quot; \nAerostreak siad to the captives. By now the huts were ash, and the only thing \nleft was the radio.\n    &quot;I will not help in our demise! Its ridiculous!&quot; Paddletail argued.\n    &quot;Yes you will or we will kill Nighteyes.&quot; Grappler said snugly.\n    Paddletail shighed. He had no choice. They would have to help the \nPredacons and then, of course, go with them.\n\n"}}
