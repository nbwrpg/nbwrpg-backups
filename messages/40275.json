He walked calmly to the doors.  Pulling \nout his sword blue flame covered it.  In his other hand he grabbed \nhis laser rifle.  He then walked forward the doors opening.  He \npointed the gun forward letting four shots whiz out catching \nDarkwing by surprise two in the shoulder, then two more directly in \nhis forehead, snapping his neck back.  With his other hand, he \npointed the sword at Dreadwind. The sword opened as a missile \nflew out, nailing Dreadwind in the stomach blowing him back 50 \nmeters.  \n\nDarkwing had fallen to a knee grabbing his forhead, smoke seeping \nbetween his fingers.  He looked up the huge bot standing before \nhim, who now had his gun on Darkwings head.  \n\n&quot;Dispose, Complete&quot; Firestrike said.  Just then a shot rang out \nfrom Dreadwind as the jet flew by and over Firestrike. Firestrikes \nrifle flew out of his hand to the side, giving Darkwing a chance to \nkick out Firestrikes legs, sending him to the ground. \n\n"}}
