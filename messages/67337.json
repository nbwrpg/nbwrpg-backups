Then with a\n mighty thrust from his hover jets, which put out much less heat, he\n pushes to the side and around the building as the building which is now\n much hotter then he receives the brunt of the remaining missile\n strikes. His laugh echoes once again through the streets as several\n sweeps meet him there and begin to rain destruction! \n \n In the air somewhat closer to the shoreline, Cyclonus had continued in\n the direction he was going, his jets flaring with power, the wind\n almost screaming as it moved past him! As his own missiles exploded\n spectacularly at the railing he merely flew through blaze, with all the\n attendant dramatic glory, allowing the heat of the explosion to either\n attract Ravenchief�s missiles attention or detonate them.

He is tall and almost regal, seeming to be almost made for the\n air boued as he was on powerful thrusters that took the place of his\n feet. \n \n His voice is deep and resonate, exactly the pitch and timber of the\n Cyclonus of old, �Is this what you wanted Maximal?� Cyclonus lets go\n with two more missiles, quickly the air behind them began to spin, then\n ripple and finally burst aflame as they pulled away from Cyclonus and\n streaked towards Ravenchief!\n \n At the shoreline below Doc manages to hit one of the two sweeps\n menacing him.

The sweeps just slow and stop just over the edge of the water\n and open up with a barrage of laser fire at Doc�s position.\n \n Meanwhile from above several sweeps move down following Rodimus and\n kup, also opening up with cannon fire at the swimming and hopefully\n helpless Maximals below.\n \n Preston\n (Da&#39;minion)\n \n __________________________________________________\n Do You Yahoo!?\n Tired of spam?
