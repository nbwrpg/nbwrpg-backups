I was an assassin for the High \n&gt; Preddacon Council back on Cybertron.  I was under orders, &quot;looks \ndown \n&gt; at her wrists.  &quot;I killed a few lower ranking members on the \nMaximal \n&gt; caouncil. Then I was ordered to kill a high ranking maximal \nofficial, \n&gt; Quantis.  After that, the council used me more or less in house. I \n&gt; killed another bot and when the found out that I killed one bot \n&gt; outside of my orders,they turned me in for the murder of the \n&gt; maximal.  I got away and stole the shuttle.  I managed to wind up \n&gt; here.&quot; \n\n\n"}}
