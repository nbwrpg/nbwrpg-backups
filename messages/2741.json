Checking his memory, he realized something.  &quot;A...beast \nmode...hmmm.&quot; accessing a file, he gasped.  &quot;A microscopic organism!  A \nslaggin&#39; amobea?!  Someone does not like me!&quot;\n\nHearing Bacterium he sighs.\n&quot;People will undoubtedly come to get us, and we don&#39;t want any attention.  \nSo, transform to your...bacteria mode...and I&#39;ll transform as well.&quot;\n\nTransforming, it took several moments until all the excess material was put \ninto subspace.  His membrane moved around like jelitin, having no real shape. \n Flying off, he activated internal boosters, invisible flames sending him \nthrough the air, added by wind, sending him &#39;speeding&#39; off towards an unknown \nlocation (unknown to him, but towards the Ark).  \n\n===================\n\nRamhorn stopped, 50 feet from the Ark.  &quot;Ramhorn...maximize.&quot; he whispered.\nTransforming to his robot mode, he pulled out his sub-machine gun and missile \nlauncher, one in each hand.  &quot;Iron Raptor, look out!  That robot murdered \nStinkbomb!&quot; he yelled, referring to Plintissa, raising both of his weapons.  \nHolding the trigger down on his sub-machine gun, he let loose 25 sonic shells \nat Dracona&#39;s back, firing off a rocket at Plintissa&#39;s back.\n\n===================\n\nScattershot stepped out of his CR chamber, stretching.  &quot;Double crossing \nfinks...I wanted to shoot them in the back.&quot; he said, walking off towards his \nquarters grumbling about running out of bombs in the middle of battle.\n\n===================\n\nPunch looked around, activating his com, heading for the Predacon base.  \n&lt;Zardus, Punch here.  I will spy on the Predacons, unless you wish otherwise. \n Punch out&gt;\nWhen out of sight of the Alliance base he spoke.  &quot;Punch, Counterize!&quot; he \nyelled, transforming into his alternate mode, Counter Punch.  The white and \ngray robot looked around.  \n\n&quot;Perfect,&quot; he chuckled, taking out his photon rifle, proceeding to the \nPredacon base.\n\n===================\n\nDouble Punch growled, rolling to the left 5 feet, again not wanting to give \naway his position.  Raising both pinchers, two missiles fired from one at \nQuickstrike&#39;s chest, a cyberbee (customized, named Beeline, check profile if \nneeded) launching from his other pincher, Beeline firing three optic lasers \n(size of regular cyberbee) off at Quickstrike&#39;s left shoulder, pulling up \ninto the air.\n\n===================\n\nBumblebee woke up.  &quot;What the slag!?&quot; he yelled.  Thinking for a moment, he \nrealized what had happened.  &quot;That red and yellow guy must&#39;ve hit me or \nsomething.&quot; getting up, he headed for the CR chambers in the Predacon base.\n\n"}}
