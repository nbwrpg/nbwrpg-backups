He did.\n\n&quot;When we get to your base I must have a meeting with Zardus. There is \nmuch about Megatron and Phobia I need to tell him.&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nFliq\n\nFliq felt the images rush throughb his spark. Battles. Death. \nWatching people die. Ramulus&#39; had had a tough life. But Fliq&#39;s images \nwere seeping to Ramulus. Being asigned to Brix Prime when he was 15 \nEarth years old. Saying goodbye to his family. Getting into a battle \nat the planet Scourgi, and alomst having their ship destroyed. \nBecoming friedns with Gekkidama, who would intern but him in this \nsituation. Fnaly, the ship receiving the order to join the Neo Beast \nWars. Crashing into the moon. Watching all of his friends die. \nLeaving Gekkidama. Coming to Earth. Getting the Octopus body. Being \ninside Bronco. Bringing out Brix with Ramulus. Telling Striker and \nSpears that they&#39;ll go to the moon. All the rest of the images came \nout, including his lat one, the pain of having his arm blown off by \none of his closes friends. But than, Fliq thought he felt relief. \nSOmething was happening. He was beign repaired. But at the same \ntime....Fliq thought he was changing.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois saw Child go down.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; He ran over and picked him up. He decided to get Child back to \nthe base and worry about the book later.\n______________________________________________________________________\nThe Trainers/Savage\n\n&quot;Sir, there he is!&quot; yelled Blaze.\n\nSavage tilted his head up. Intruders. They would pay.\n\n&quot;Everyone! Beast Mode Tamron!&quot;\n\nThe bots started to change and merge. Their robot had a Beast Mode \ntoo. When it ws done, it had the head of a Bengal. The torse of a \nGrizzly Bear and Buffalo connected together. The 6 insect legs of a \ntick, and the ginat wings of the bald Eagle. Tamron was ready to do \nbattle with Savage.\n\n\n"}}
