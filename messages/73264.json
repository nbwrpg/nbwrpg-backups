We may not always see eye to eye but it doesn&#39;t mean I\n&gt; don&#39;t respect who you are. Now, our only hope to escape this threat is to relocate all\n&gt; together. We must return to the Ark and see if we can get it flying just enough to relocate\n&gt; its position. Before I became a warrior, I did extensive work in mechanical and weaponry\n&gt; restoration. I haven&#39;t lost sight of those skills. I can attempt to restore the essential\n&gt; components for transport, and worry about the rest at a later time. Of course I will need a\n&gt; bit of help from anyone with engineering as their background, which I believe Stanton and\n&gt; Bump, along with Legacy, could be a big help. All right, let&#39;s guide them home!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He quickens his pace with a beat of his large wings.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS nodded slightly as his large wings cupped the air for a moment\nand then also flapped, propelling his large fiery form through the\nair.\n\n&quot;I wish we could move the Ark.&quot; RODIMUS said after a moment, &quot;But any\nchanges that large could create severe problems in the timeline.&quot; He\nsaid firmly. &quot;But perhaps we can work on defenses.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; nighlight slowly moved and started to woke up, she felt so weak. She vagely\n&gt; heard familiar noises.\n\nRODIMUS looked down to see his wife NIGHTLIGHT cradled gently in his\nclaws. He paused slightly as he shifted her to a position where she\nwould be as comfortable as possible for the flight home.\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; RODIMUS said in a deep voice as he and TUSCON flew over the\nother MAXIMALS. &quot;It is time to go home!&quot; His voice may not have been\nas loud as TUSCON&#39;s but it did carry enough to get the point across.\n\nThere was something different about RODIMUS, the difference being more\nthan just his new mode. He seemed to now have a beast mode. It was not\nthat something was wrong, but that he had grown more than just in\nsize, but somehting else seemed to be happening as well.\n\nWisdom perhaps? Self confidence? Also, what other changes have\noccurred in the bot who once once a stubborn but charismatic Cavalier,\nthen commander who lacked confidence?\n\nTime would tell . . .\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
