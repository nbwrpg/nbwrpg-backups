But she feels different somehow. She runs a quick \n&gt; diognostic. Her optic lazars have been enhanced. She isn&#39;t sure how \n&gt; this happened, but it&#39;s been increased by 20 percent.  She then \n&gt; recalls the moments before blacking out and growls.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; : : SharpClaw : :\n&gt; &gt; SharpClaw: The dart effect will wear off, but we&#39;ll speed it up in \n&gt; the CR.\n&gt; &gt; SharpClaw takes KitKat to an CR chamber, placing her within it, and \n&gt; starting a heal cycle.\n&gt; &gt;  aerosmith4e@a... wrote:Carnatron felt her frequency fading. He \n&gt; turned to Perceptor. He stared at him \n&gt; &gt; codly. &quot;I&#39;ll have Hydras deal with you! Fighting amongst \n&gt; yourselves, your \n&gt; &gt; pathetic. When she wakes up I hope she kicks ur metallic ass.&quot; He \n&gt; walked over \n&gt; &gt; to Kit Kat. &quot;This will help keep her stable until we get her into a \n&gt; CR \n&gt; &gt; chamber. He took a small piece of his black organism covering his \n&gt; body and \n&gt; &gt; placed it on Kit Kat. He gave it one instruction to keep her alive \n&gt; until the \n&gt; &gt; CR chamber fixed her. The suit to his knowledge would only \n&gt; willingly seperate \n&gt; &gt; from him when he willed it to. When the organism was placed on Kit \n&gt; Kat it \n&gt; &gt; would listen to her as well. If it changed her at all it would be \n&gt; diffrent \n&gt; &gt; then his change since he was a pure energon body when it attached \n&gt; to him. (If \n&gt; &gt; you want you can just have it die when she gets fixed or have it \n&gt; change her a \n&gt; &gt; little bit whatever floats your boat.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She was unconsious from the dart. Mech fluid leaking from the \n&gt; corner \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of her mouth and her face plates damaged. Her body limp in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor&#39;s hands. Her optics flickered as her program tried to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; restart despite the dart&#39;s sedative effects. Even out cold her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; programs wouldn&#39;t give up. Yet, she remained unconsious. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
