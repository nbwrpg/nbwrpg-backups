He had been in this large cave for a couple days\nnow.  It was his shelter out in the wild, but soon he would have much\nbetter shelter in the Alliance base.  He got up, and decided to go find the\nAlliance right now, so he transformed into his beast mode, a T-Rex, and\nwent stomping off.  He eventually came across the Alliance base after an\nhour or so.\n\n\t&quot;Ah, so this is my home on Earth.  Interesting!&quot; He said as he transformed\ninto robot mode.\n\n\tWheeljack grabbed his two plasma rifles and went running up to the hatch\nexcitedly, then started banging madly.\n\n\t&quot;Let me in!  Let me in!  Hello, Alliance friends, now let me in!!&quot; He\nshouted with joy, while banging his fists on the hatch.\n\n\n"}}
