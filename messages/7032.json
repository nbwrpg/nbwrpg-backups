Wait here.&quot; \n&gt; She ran to the lab and grabbed some tubes and some string.  Next, she \n&gt; ran to the kitchen and grabbed a few pieces a fruit and ran back to \n&gt; the console.\n&gt; &quot;OK, Let&#39;s try this.&quot;  She pulled the string through the tube and put \n&gt; a piece of friut to the end of the string.  She laid it on the \n&gt; counter and put Akura in front of the fruit.\n&gt; &quot;OK Twister, you slowly pull the string and we&#39;ll see if Akura \n&gt; follows it through the tube.  He&#39;ll fit though the tube alright.  \n&gt; Hope this works.&quot;  She crossed her fingers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Twister: Hmm....Maybe first to pull ropes and wires through \n&gt; tunnles.
