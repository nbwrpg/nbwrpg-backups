After you were scraped by\nautobots, the Great war didnt last much longer. The Autobots won it&quot;\nMotormaster pauses to spit some oil in disgust. &quot;Me and my comrades here\nwere taken prisoner, and locked up after a mockery trial stating our crimes\nagainst Sentient beings. Now it is 300 years since that time. Autobots\ndescendants, Maximals, have made peace with the Decepticon descendants,\nPredacons. and I HATE predacons, because they think they are Decepticons.\nWell aparantly, a predacon rebel was causing problems in the time stream on\nthis planet. Planet Earth. The Tripredicus council, a powerful group of\npredacon government on cybertron, has sent us here in hope that we stop\nthem from causing anymore problems. But they made a huge mistake. We will\nrebuild the Decepticon Empire, take cybertron by force and rule the galaxy\nagain. But to do that we need troops, thats where you come in. Also, the\nDecepticons of the past are hidden here somewhere, we will awaken them, and\nhopefully Megatron, and rule the Galaxy&quot;.\n\n\n\n"}}
