Yet there was still so much he didn&#39;t know and wanted to \n&gt; learn. There was also the question of his roots.  He knew he could sense \n&gt; something but was not quite sure of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I completely understand your reserves my friends.  And I will hold \n&gt; nothing against you for them.  Yet all I ask is that you give Perceptor \n&gt; the chance to prove himself.  In due time, he will do just that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He listens to his vocalizer.  Rat Trap looks up to him as if now knowing \n&gt; something.  Straight Shot too, appears highly curious and looks to Rat \n&gt; Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Am I hearing things, or does Tucson&#39;s voice sound very, very familliar?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks up to Tucson and then to Legacy and Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;She&#39;s right, your voice, Wheels, your voice, do you realize who you \n&gt; sounded like just then?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson shrugs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Not really sure where you&#39;re going with that Rat Trap.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I know who it sounds like.  We only knew Optimus for a short time, but I \n&gt; can&#39;t mistake his voice and you most certainly sound like him.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson shows modesty in his expression.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maybe it&#39;s just a cooincedence.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap looks to him intently.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Legacy, You know a lot about everyone, don&#39;t ya think Wheels sounds a \n&gt; lot like Optimus?  And by chance, could he actually be related to him?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;that would be the best&quot;said Perceptor&quot;Taking in count what I heard \n&gt;&gt; &gt; about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; her behavior, sedated she will suffer less... &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bump nodded as he opened a storage closet and pulled out a large\n&gt;&gt; panel. Pushing a few buttons on it it began to glow slightly as it\n&gt;&gt; unfolded into a temporary antigravity suspensor bed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I will be right back.&quot; he said, &quot;I am going to retrieve Nightlight.\n&gt;&gt; We still have a bit of work to do it seems.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you Legacy, everyone, I know it&#39;s hard to understand things that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; we normally could never understand, but it is this common ground which \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will keep us together as a faction, something Hydras does not have, nor \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will ever have. I also understand your reservations on the matter. I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; can tell just by the tones of your voices, but I also comprehend the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; reason behind it and it&#39;s only normal to have reservations. I am not \n&gt;&gt; &gt; offended by your true feelings, but thankful you are willing to give \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor the chance to prove himself worthy.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Before Tucson had been upgraded to a Prime, this sort of talk would \n&gt;&gt; &gt; often anger him to the point of grave annoyance. He&#39;d often speak up \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and stick up for those being riddiculed and whenever necesary, he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; probably would have lost his temper all together and decked the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; offender right there and then. But now, he realizes those feelings did \n&gt;&gt; &gt; not come through. Something was definitely changing. Instead of being \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his old self, he was evolving into someone new, wiser, more tolerant, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and a lot more calm as an individual. Yet, his toughness was still \n&gt;&gt; &gt; there, along with his courage, and will to fight. He could not yet \n&gt;&gt; &gt; understand the meaning of these changes, and for whatever reason, he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; knew they were for the better. He now turns his head in Legacy&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; direction.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Even as a Prime, I&#39;m still in the process of learning. I don&#39;t think \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll ever stop learning. One thing I have to admit, if I were still my \n&gt;&gt; &gt; old self now, short tempered, quick to be critical, I may have blown \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the roof off the Ark, and retorted adversely. But now, I couldn&#39;t find \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it in my spark to react as such. I&#39;m changing, and as I change, I can \n&gt;&gt; &gt; feel the pressense of Optimus Prime. I often feel that if I could see \n&gt;&gt; &gt; my shadow, it would appear as his once did, long ago. Why is that? I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know I&#39;m not Optimus, yet there is a part of me that feels that he&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; within me somehow. Legacy, is there something about me that even I do \n&gt;&gt; &gt; not know? I&#39;m very curious to find out.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy watched Tuscon impassively, his single optic glowing with a\n&gt;&gt; focused light. &quot;Your reaction is . . . curious.&quot; Legacy said in his\n&gt;&gt; normal icy tones, &quot;Change is inevitable,  predictable and often times\n&gt;&gt; beneficial. Logic demands that we adapt to what we cannot control and\n&gt;&gt; be a part of change rather than a victim of it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Legacy turned to observe Perceptor, &quot;I am sure we shall all keep a\n&gt;&gt; watchful optic on him, and adapt our responses to his actions.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Santon nodded as he crossed his arms, &quot;Yep. I agree. If you vouch for\n&gt;&gt; him Tuscon then I will give him the benefit of the doubt, but I won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; take my optic off of him until he proves it to me he&#39;s trust worthy.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Torca, who had stepped back in the room merely nodded at Tuscon,\n&gt;&gt; holding his own council for the moment on how he felt about\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor&#39;s presence. Instead he chose to change the subject, &quot;I will\n&gt;&gt; be sending the Fuzors out on patrol. There is no telling what Hydras\n&gt;&gt; is doing while we are all sitting here watching you and Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; recover.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
