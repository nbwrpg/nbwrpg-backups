It felt so good!\nBut this whole place was strange!\nHe had grown in a star ship, he didn&#39;t know what living on a planet was like \nand it was frightening as well as exciting.\nD curled into a tight ball as soon as all four linbs were on land, his tail \ncurled around hos side and his ears flat against his skull. His nose sniffed \ncarefully in every direction, pizzled on what this place was and taking in \nit&#39;s smells.*\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
