They should have no idea\nhow he wa=\r\ns controlling the Dinosaurs or the limitations of that\ncontrol.\n\nOOC2: Also=\r\n, please try not to do so many things in one post. You go\nfrom the CR chamb=\r\ner, to an explanation of what&#39;s happening, to a\ntransfer of their sparks, t=\r\no the completion of it and his\ntransforming. You could have stretched that =\r\nout to build up the drama\nand suspense. If it helps you can think of it lik=\r\ne all your characters\ndon=92t belong to you and you have to wait for their =\r\nplayers to respond\nbefore you go on. At the moment it makes it somewhat dif=\r\nficult me to\ninsert anything more than commentary. I will just pick it up a=\r\nt the\nend.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon, Straight Shot, Quickstride, Rodimus, Silver Dr=\r\nagon&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Rodimus, everyone, I can see all of you.  The dream was a visio=\r\nn.  Better\n&gt; times are ahead and the dragon knew exactly what needed to tra=\r\nnspire.  My\n&gt; Autobot shell was weakening and would not have lasted much lo=\r\nnger.  And now,\n&gt; I am the Silver Dragon, but please, call me by my origina=\r\nl name. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks outside with a strong stance in his new trans metal =\r\ndraconic form.\n&gt; He transforms into his new alt form and takes a strong sta=\r\nnce at the foot of\n&gt; the cave.  Now a much younger and stronger version of =\r\nthe Silver Dragon,\n&gt; Tucson makes his voice heard, hoping that Saberback he=\r\nars his assertive\n&gt; message.  A booming draconic roar is sent over the skie=\r\ns as a warning is\n&gt; cast to the enemy that the guardian lives again.\n\n&lt;NEW =\r\n- Rodimus&gt;\n\nAs the other approach RODIMUS is still standing there holding t=\r\nhe\nrather large draconic scale looking at it admiringly.\n\n\n. . . .\n\nRODIMUS=\r\n, LEO and WING SABER are all standing in surprise as TUSCON\ntook on this ne=\r\nw form, and how he explained how it all came from a\ndream.\n\nWING SABER whis=\r\npered, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that Yokitron had such powers to\ndo anything like thi=\r\ns.&quot;\n\nLEO shook his head thoughtfully, &quot;I am not sure if he does.&quot;\n\nRODIMUS =\r\ncame over to stand next to LEO and WING SABER as he held the\nlarge scale un=\r\nder one arm. He looked up at this new version of TUSCON\nasking the question=\r\n that was probably on the minds of the others.\n\n&quot;So what now? What does thi=\r\ns new form mean?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
