Insecticon, Bruticus-X, and Iguanus moved in=\r\n almost eagerly to pick up the mighty weapons that Tuscon has dropped, whil=\r\ne Inferno, the self proclaimed bodyguard of Hydras watched Tuscon carefully=\r\n, his optic ready to spot treachery.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quietly a short message is sent t=\r\no Tuscon, &quot;Tuscon.&quot; The deep voice of Noctorro, the leader of the Maximal F=\r\nuzors can be heard, &quot;My team is here. Rodimus sent us to aid you. None too =\r\nsoon it would seem.&quot; Noctorro&#39;s words are grim, a soldier&#39;s humor in them. =\r\n&quot;We await your signal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgat=\r\nor, and Quickstrike move to do the same with Kup, Nightshift, Straightshot,=\r\n Talon and the others. Skyshadow, the leader of the Predacon Fuzors just wa=\r\ntches with a gloating look on his face, it is almost as if he wants them to=\r\n attack and keep the battle going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Phobia and several sweeps=\r\n keep an eye on things from the air, while Terrorsaur and Waspinator landed=\r\n, ready to help out as needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time Legacy processed Tusco=\r\nn&#39;s command for him to leave the Ark. There was a long pause, and then the =\r\ntemporal guardian&#39;s cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will not comply=\r\n with your command. I have been tasked with the . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep=\r\nstryke transmits to Hydras, &quot;Hydras. I am picking up an encrypted transmiss=\r\nions to and from Tuscon, he is attempting to communicate with the others. I=\r\n am generating a radio dampening field now in this area. Only the Predacons=\r\n will be able to transmit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile inside the Black Tower:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWindlord&#39;s attempt to open fire on the Scourge was met with a measure of fu=\r\ntility. Scourge just stepped away from the opening that Windlord fired out =\r\nfrom and let the shots go harmlessly into a bulkhead, scorching it only sli=\r\nghtly.\n&gt; \n&gt; However that slight amount of time allowed Windlord and Rat Tra=\r\np time to scurry further into their crawl space and find an interior bulkhe=\r\nad to hide behind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Scourge&#39;s voice said from the outside. The=\r\nre was a pause and then, &quot;Cyclonus, they have fled into the walls.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nere was another pause, and then Scourge chuckled, &quot;Of course. I will be rea=\r\ndy for them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; From further inside the crawl space the sounds of chitte=\r\nring could be heard, and then several groups of optics could be seen in the=\r\n distance coming towards Rat Trap and Windlord. In the darkness their shape=\r\ns could only be barely made out, but they looked like black metallic spider=\r\ns, Hydras&#39; wall guardians!\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Rat Trap may recognize them from last=\r\n time. Also keep in mind that Rat Trap and Windlord should be in beast mode=\r\n. They would have to be to fit inside the crawl space. In the toon the Beas=\r\nt Modes did not have offensive weaponry, except for teeth and claws)\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nutside the Ark:\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was positioned in a small grove of trees, duck=\r\ning down behind several large rocks. He gives Quickstride a quizzical look =\r\nas the equine Maximal sniffed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals n=\r\nothing wrong.)\n&gt; \n&gt; He was about to let Quickstride in on what he had plann=\r\ned when Uproar appeared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar&#39;s con=\r\nclusion that it was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodimus didn&#39;t know =\r\nthat much about Legacy, having only seen him briefly while being rescued an=\r\nd repaired, there was nothing to hint that this attack was Legacy&#39;s doing. =\r\nHe was about to say something when Uproar ran towards the Ark to be let in =\r\n. . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, what seemed li=\r\nke a round bolt of lightening appeared, sending Uproar flying several yards=\r\n through the air, to land heavily on the ground! Evidently the Ark shieldin=\r\ng was still in place, and it was not allowing anyone in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus frown=\r\ned, &quot;Uproar! Get over here! If we are going to get back in, then we need to=\r\n work together. That shield is supposed to hold off all the Predacon forces=\r\n. We are not going to get in by brute force.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Rodimus talked three =\r\nother Maximals seemed to almost materialize out of the underbrush, such was=\r\n their skills at camouflage.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first was Wing Caliber, (See: http://=\r\ntfwiki.net/wiki/Skywarp ) an old Maximal stratagist and military teacher, w=\r\nho from the brownish feathers along his frame turned into some sort of eagl=\r\ne.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The next was Leo II, (http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/76/Li=\r\noconvoy_gathering.jpg ) the adopted son of Lio Convoy, and who looked much =\r\nlike him, and who had obviously picked up many of his mannerisms. His body =\r\nwas powerfully built and heavily armored. He looked to turn into a lion.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The third was Ramulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like th=\r\ne others been on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying to keep =\r\nit free from Predacon invasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also come up beside Rodimus, Leo =\r\nII, obviously the leader of the other two, &quot;What now sir?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus loo=\r\nked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Well let&#39;s get out of sight, and then we ca=\r\nn discuss it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile Inside the Ark:\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor had received T=\r\nuscon&#39;s message and sent attempted to send a message to Lord elder, however=\r\n at the moment there was no answer from the elder Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same=\r\n time Legacy was still standing in the med lab along with the others, his s=\r\ningle optic glowing in the darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It would seem that Nightlight&#39;s =\r\nvital systems are being held at minimal levels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed=\r\n his gaze to the wall panel nearest Nightlight. A small light blinked, indi=\r\ncating her spark was still online, but that there was not enough power to r=\r\neboot her systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowing i=\r\nn the darkness, lit by his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest plat=\r\ne. He raised his right hand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it a=\r\nnd begin to emit light from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that=\r\n the room was illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could loc=\r\nate a back out or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon=\r\n&#39;s message came in. He turned to look at Santon, Bump and Perceptor, a look=\r\n of disbelief momentarily flashing across his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy straightene=\r\nd as his cold voice comes across the channel, &quot;I will not comply with your =\r\ncommand. I have been tasked with  . . . . &gt;*BZZZTT!*&lt;  . . . the protection=\r\n of the Ark as well as that of the Matrix. I will not knowingly leave the A=\r\nrk undefended or the Matrix in the hands of another.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to=\r\n look at his console as he understoodf what happened. Communications had be=\r\nen cut part way through his message. He turned to look at the others, his s=\r\ningle optic cold, &quot;It is illogical to believe that I would attempt to harm =\r\nthe Ark or allow anyone to take it from the Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Pres=\r\nton\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
