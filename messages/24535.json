She released him. He stripped \noff the fur pelt of Rowdy Wolf and threw it to her. &quot;Don&#39;t be too \nlonely.&quot;\n\nHe turned his head to Wildfire, telling her to get Rowdy Wolf&#39;s \nreaper. The horse turned and bolted off behind the boulder, and \ntrotted back to him with the reaper in her mouth. He took it from \nher. If anything should happen to him, this weapon could back him up. \nHe grabbed a hold of Wildfire&#39;s mane and jumped up to her back, using \nthe belly first method. She bucked him off a few times trying to do \nthis. She could carry him faster to the south on her back. \n\nHe sat up straight and looked at Black Arachnia. He bowed his head to \nher, then the two bots were off. The first thing he learned from \nWildfire was not to kick her sides when he was on her back, because \nif he did, he&#39;d wind up on his own back. He held onto her mane as she \ncarried him through the snow.\n\n\n"}}
