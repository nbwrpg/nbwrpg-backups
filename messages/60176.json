She folded her hands behind her head \nand closed her optics. She smiled at his reaction. Sure she was \nflirting a bit. She stopped smiling and started to frown as she \nrealized what was happening. She was starting to like him. She shook \nher head and told her self she would have to stop and right now.  She \nremembered how many friends she had lost in the past wars.  She \ndecided, for the sake of her and her new friend, she would not allow \nherself to get attatched.  She would have to stop having fun and \nstart keeping her mind on the job. She rolled her head over and \nlooked at the sleeping Malice. She smiled and thought how hard it \nwould be to really stop liking him.  She closed her optics and went \nto sleep. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &quot;Oh yes!&quot; Malice said sarcastically,&quot;I have been dying to know \nthat!  I didn&#39;t think I could go on without that information!  Oh, \nwhat a revelation.&quot;\n&gt; Malice chuckled to himself and walked to his room.  He climbed in \nthe hammock, sparing the bed if Wolfblade decided to accept the free \nbed.  He wormed around in the net, finally getting comfotable.  He \ndrifted to sleep shortly thereafter.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; \n&gt; She decided perhaps he was right. &quot;Well, perhaps a nap. But back to \n&gt; your room? You just want to find out if I snore in wolf mode. Then \n&gt; you&#39;ll have black mail material on me to hold against me the rest \nof \n&gt; my life. Well pal, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t snore, so there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In the name of God, I banish these souls of the evil undead into \ndamnation.  May God have mercy, for I have none.  In Jesus&#39; Holy \nName, Amen.&quot; -Rawl, Hellsing-RPG\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
