I consider those characters \nrather weak to other characters in the RPG when compared.  \n\nIcedemon, you are incorrect.  Rhinox was outside of the CF and never went \nback until your rather recent post.\n\nFriday, December 15th of the year 2000.  Message number 23970 posted by \n&#39;Prodigey Child&#39; on eGroups.  I&#39;ll just copy &#39;n&#39; paste what you had:\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRhinox\n\n\n\nhe runs up on the other side of Hot rod and started to fire bullets from his \nmachine guns.\n\n\nRhinox:\n\n\n&quot;eat this you scum eating piece of slag.&quot;\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter extensive viewing and when I thought I&#39;d never find it because you may \nbe right and I might be wrong, I found it.  You said Rhinox NEVER left the \nCF.  Explain the above message and information then.  \n\nLet me get this nice and easy for you.  Oblitertron blew hole in hull of CF.  \nUnitron, Firestarter, and Vehement fly threw hole into bridge.  Unitron, \nFirestarer, and Vehement now INSIDE the CF.  Everywhere else is lockeddown.  \nThat means several feet of extra metal slid down covering every entrance/exit \nof the CF, and aren&#39;t opening until the lockdown is reversed by someone with \nthe authority to do so.  And Rhinox never went in before the lockdown, and \nwas outside fighting people after the lockdown took affect.\n\nSo, please, keep track of your own characters.)\n\n\nLord Unitron\nKSLawDogg@...\n\n\n"}}
