(Also, Astroblast doesn&#39;t know that they dont \nknow that Condor has been captured, he just automatically \nassumed that they did.)\n\nOn 24 Feb 2001, at 22:06, icedemon101@... wrote:\n\n&gt; [Astro Train,Noble, and Wizard no nothing about conder being captured. \n&gt; all they know is that he has been taken prisioner.]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
