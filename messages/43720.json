The score is 106 \nfor \n&gt; the Balle=\r\nrs and 102 for the Gorrilaz.  The story so far has been the \n&gt; play by Gorz=\r\no.  Gorzo, A rookie from Crystal University is 30 for 34 \n&gt; shots made.  10=\r\n 3-pointers and 15 dunks for a total of 50 points.  \n&gt; But can the last ran=\r\nk Gorrilaz with the help of Gorzo beat the first \n&gt; rank Ballers?  Lets go =\r\ndown to the court to see what happens.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Court Side Announcer:  Hello,=\r\n we have 20 secounds left in the game. \n \n&gt; The Gorrilaz are passing in the=\r\n ball as we speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; A bot wearing a jersey that says &quot;Bentals&quot; passes t=\r\nhe ball in to a \n&gt; bot wearing a jersey thats says &quot;Gorzo&quot;.  Gorzo Dribbles=\r\n the ball \n&gt; down the court and passes it to a bot with a jersey that says =\r\n&quot;Bob&quot;. \n \n&gt; Bob then passes it to Bentals and Bentals passes it a bot with =\r\nthe \n&gt; jersey that says &quot;Micko&quot;.  Micko passes the ball to Bentals and \n&gt; B=\r\nentals passes it to Gorzo.  Gorzo steps up to the 3-point line and \n&gt; jumps=\r\n up making it look like a jump shot.  At the last second he \n&gt; passes it to=\r\n a jumping bot, which is by the goal, whose jersey \n&gt; reads, &quot;Ned&quot;.  Ned th=\r\nen slams the ball for an Alley-op(SP?).  Bots \n&gt; with a different jersey gr=\r\nab the ball.  The bots jersey \n&gt; Reads &quot;Feller&quot;.  Feller passes the ball in=\r\n to a bot with a jersey \n&gt; which read &quot;Rauq&quot;.  (Time to make Rauq look Stup=\r\nid.)  Rauq starts \n&gt; Dribbiling the ball down court when he trips over his =\r\nown feet.  The \n&gt; ball leaves his hands and rolls into Gorzo hands.  Gorzo,=\r\n who is \n&gt; standing behind the 3-point line and takes a jump shot.  The bal=\r\nl \n&gt; sails into the hoop as the Buzzers sounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Court Side Announcer: =\r\n HOLY RUST POCKET, THE GORRILAZ WIN 107-106.  \n&gt; THE GORRILAZ WIN!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;5 Years Later&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bot that was wearing the Gorzo jersey 5 years e=\r\narlier was in a \n&gt; small 2 person shuttle.  He is Flying around Earth.  All=\r\n of a sudden \n&gt; the right wing catches on fire and falls down towards Earth=\r\n as the \n&gt; shuttle falls down with the wing.  The shuttle lands near Mid-Af=\r\nrica \n&gt; about 10 miles from where Dewboys Characters are.\n\n\n"}}
