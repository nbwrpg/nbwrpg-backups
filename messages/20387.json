He \nslid ahead on the smooth surface and stopped about a foot from an \nautogun barrel. It didn&#39;t fire. That only meant that these Preds \ndidn&#39;t want him dead yet. He scampered into the nearest unlocked \ndoor. He found himself in the engine room. A wrong turn but an \nacceptable one. He ducked behind one of the machines as the autoguns \nin the hall followed. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t dare fire at me while I&#39;m in \nhere. he thought. If an autogun caused a leak in the engine there&#39;d \nbe noone left.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She went at full speed. Knowing a wolf can outrun a fox. She \nsniffed \n&gt; him, his scent was getting stronger with each paw step. She grinned.\n&gt; &quot;OH FOXY! You know this would be a lot easier if you just turned \n&gt; youself over now. I&#39;m sure your friends would like you returned in \n&gt; one piece and in functioning order.&quot;  She smiled. &quot;AUTOGUNS!

He&#39;d continue to \nplay \n&gt; &gt; the game a little longer, he might be able to use this to his \n&gt; &gt; advantage. Three bots chasing him meant three more samples for \n&gt; &gt; Veratis. If only Veratis believed in weaponry. He quickly \nscampered \n&gt; &gt; down the hall. A musky smell filled his nostrils. He figured it \nwas \n&gt; &gt; the brig. He was playing right into thier hands. Or at least \nthats \n&gt; &gt; what he wanted them to think. KitKat was getting closer, he \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; have to look back to know that, he was staying a step ahead of \nher \n&gt; &gt; both mentally and physically.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
