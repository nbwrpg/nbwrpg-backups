It was Icebirds turn to be more cautious.\n\n&quot;Somethings not right, If he were hurt it seems like his mind would be more\neratic.&quot; She thought for a moment about the whole situation and decided they\ncouldn&#39;t take that chance.\n\nShe opened her mind again communicating telepathically with Lunarpine. &quot;How\nfast can you get around the mountain?&quot; she was hoping to find another way in\nand surprise the bot if it was a trap.\n\nLunarpine sensed her plan, transformed to full wolf mode and sprinted up the\nmountain and down the other side. She was right to be overcautious, an\ninjured bot wouldn&#39;t have had the time to lay a minefield, either there was\nmore than one or the bot had lied to them. Either way didn&#39;t seem safe.\n\nIce transformed to polar bear and started into the cave. She kept a mental\neye on the cave hopeing that the bot was hurt and not an enemy. She wasn&#39;t\nthe fighter that she wished to be, that fact kept her further apart from the\nwolf she loved. She tried to communicate again with the other bot, &quot;Where\nare you? it&#39;s dark, give me some sort of sign.&quot; She knew that her owl mode\nwould&#39;ve been a better choice but her bear form was the more dureable of her\nthree forms so it seemed the smarter choice.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Beast Wars &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 08, 2001 1:33 PM\nSubject: Re: Say Welcome to Grizzltron\n\n\n�Grizzltron�\n\n\n   The explosion rocks the cave, but it doesn&#39;t cave in.
