Maximal City didn&#39;t seem to\nbe as deserted as his first approach had shown, his thoughts spiralled back\nto his old decpticon days, havoc was much easier to accomplish those times.\nBlow up a stupid earthling damn and watch the autobots scurry around trying\nto save everything.

They were too primitive and too easy a\ntarget. Transformer havoc would be his dish of choice here. First neutral,\nthen maximal and finally havoc within the predacon ranks... Smiling to\nhimself he let his thoughts drift to the joys of chaos...\n\n\n"}}
