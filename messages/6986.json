Well, I&#39;m surprised! Last time I saw him, he was a low \nrank. He \n&gt; could barely stand to be near the others. Everyone gave him no \nrespect.&quot; He \n&gt; laughed. &quot;I am amazed! He managed for himself.&quot; He smiled. &quot;The \nstories he \n&gt; told me, now second in command. Perhaps my advise did help.&quot; His \nattention \n&gt; came back to the two bots. &quot;Yes, I will go, but will you give me a \nnano \n&gt; klick?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The red flier folded his arms. &quot;Sure, whatever it is.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After that, Rowdy Wolf ran inside of the cave and grabbed a few \nfurs. He \n&gt; came back to the two Predacons. &quot;Can you carry these, flier?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My name is Terrorsaur, and I&#39;d suppose I could carry them. I could \nuse \n&gt; something like that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf turned his head to KitKat. &quot;A fur for the trip back?&quot; He \noffered \n&gt; her a fur blanket.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
