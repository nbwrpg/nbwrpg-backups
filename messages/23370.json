But if they are your enemy, then they&#39;ll probably concentrate on\nyou during the battle and not give you much of a chance to kill them...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Rudra656@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, December 08, 2000 4:32 PM\nSubject: Re: Havoc...\n\n\n&gt; ::Lambda::\n&gt;     &quot;That is a useful thing to have around.
