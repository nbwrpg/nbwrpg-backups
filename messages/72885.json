It was as if it was a foci of some sort, perhaps one of the\n&gt; pla=\r\nces, if not THE place from which the disruptive energies were\n&gt; coming from=\r\n.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the moment, as Blackarachnia worked over with the jamming,=\r\n she went to play over as she kept scanning it, pinging it back and forth, =\r\nand nto getting far.  Finally deciding she was playing with fire, and shutt=\r\ning her electronic sensors off entirely.\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; TORCA grunted as if=\r\n he suspected that something more was at play here\n&gt; as well, however he co=\r\nntinued to followed LEO PRIME into the cave\n&gt; opening.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cave itself=\r\n was quite large, at least once you passed through the\n&gt; mouth of it. It qu=\r\nickly began to descend its curving path leading\n&gt; further and further into =\r\nthe darkness that was below. The walls were\n&gt; like any other cave, rough an=\r\nd natural, thee was no ambient light in\n&gt; here, except for whatever light s=\r\npilled in from the mouth of the cave\n&gt; or what the PREDACONS and MAXIMALS c=\r\nared to utilize.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sensors were getting more and more muffled as they pa=\r\nssed into it.\n&gt; Passive ones still abosorbed, but active ones were basicall=\r\ny of little\n&gt; to no use beyond a few feet espeacially ones that used radio =\r\nor energy\n&gt; waves that went outside the normal visual or auditory ranges.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Ahead of them they could hear something roar in the distance,\n&gt; somethi=\r\nng loud and reptillian - it was TUSCON! From the sound of it,\n&gt; he was perh=\r\naps several hundred meters ahead of them deeper into the\n&gt; cave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Howev=\r\ner behind them, as the last of the PREDACONS were making their\n&gt; way in, a =\r\nmetallic &#39;door&#39; slid across the mouth of the cave blocking\n&gt; out any extern=\r\nal light as well as any chance of egress.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trap, at least this sect=\r\nion of it, had been sprung!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Adam the &#39;door&#39; will wait for all the=\r\n preds and maxi&#39;s, but it is\n&gt; up to you if Blackarachnia was inside or out=\r\nside when the door closed.\n\nOOC - Since BA was purposefully staying abovegr=\r\nound, am going to say she didn&#39;t get &#39;cuaght&#39; in it.  She was up in the tre=\r\nes and not going down into the hole.  Will post for her, and then you can e=\r\nither have her fade into the background so you don&#39;t have to pick up anothe=\r\nr thread, or can give her a close out.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAt the moment, BLACKARACHNIA=\r\n, stilla boveground and far up in teh trees as the others went over on down=\r\n and then had the large &#39;CLANG&#39; go hammer down on top of them, let out a lo=\r\nud *SIGH*.  \n\nThinking to herself &lt;They should have known that was going to=\r\n happen..&gt;\n\nShe ewnt then over towards an area she thought might have poten=\r\ntial for her to setup a base for her own use until later.\n\n\n\n"}}
