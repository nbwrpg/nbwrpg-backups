It excited his mind composed of 5\nOblitercons, though only one was in total control.\n    Seeing a large robot beginning to approach him, though it was a beast,\nOblitertron raised his laser pistol, aiming at the beast mode.  Getting\nready\nto pull the trigger, &quot;he&quot; stopped when hearing Iron Raptor speak.\n\n-��- Dark One, in control of Oblitertron, was about to lower his weapon,\nwhen\ninside Oblitertron&#39;s mind, in a blue and red vortex, a pair of red hands\ngrabbed Dark One, throwing him out, Pyro taking control -��-\n\nOblitertron smiled slightly, looking around.  Raising his pistol, he fired a\nsingle shot off at Iron Raptor, an optic blast off at Tavatron and Dinobot,\nthough it had a low chance of actually hitting, but Oblitertron&#39;s not real\nintelligent &quot;mind&quot; didn&#39;t care as long as something happened.  &quot;WE LIVE FOR\nOBLITERATION!  DIE MAXIMALS!&quot; his gargantuan voice boomed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n@Backup- Protect and Access your data any time, any where on the net.\nTry @Backup FREE and recieve 300 points from mypoints.com Install now:\nhttp://click.egroups.com/1/5666/10/_/_/_/961489797/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
