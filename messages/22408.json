She looked at \nthem. &quot;Ah, Feline. I was just talking about you with another bot. How \nare you feeling?&quot; she said in a cheerful and warm voice.\n\nFeline2::\nShe looked up at Squizzy. She didn&#39;t feel threatened by Squizzy, for \nshe was short and didn&#39;t look to be a fighter at all. Plus the fact \nthat Squizzy was the one who brought her back as it were. She \nshurgged her shoulders. &quot;Eh, I&#39;m ok.&quot;\n\nSquizzy::\n&quot;That&#39;s excelent. Oh, by the way and while I&#39;m thinging about it. I \nhave a new program to install in you. I found it and it&#39;s of your old \nmemories. Plus it has a few minor upgrades that your old body doesn&#39;t \nhave. Like a spark protection system. If you have the time, I can \ninstall it for you and you&#39;ll be out of here in a just a half hour. \nIt won&#39;t take long at all. Would you please have a seat on the \nbiotable and I&#39;ll get started right away.&quot;\nShe looked at Repressor. &quot;This won&#39;t take long at all. If you want, \nyou can have a seat right here or wait outside.&quot; she said cheerfully.\n\nFeline2::\nShe walked over and jumped up onto the table.\n\nSquizzy::\n&quot;Feline, would you transform into bot mode. It will make it easier to \nget this uploaded and faster as well.&quot;\n\nFeline2::\nShe transformed into bot mode and waited:\n\nSquizzy::\nShe walked over to the console and pushed a fe buttons. Then she \nwalked over to Feline and pulled a cable out of the table an hooked \nit up to Feline&#39;s neural net hook up.  &quot;Now don&#39;t worry about a \nthing. You&#39;ll be out of here before you know it.&quot;\nShe walked over and looked at the console. She brought up the \nprograms that FZ had given here. She looked at Feline,&quot;Lay down and \nrelax.&quot; She watched as Feline lay down on the table, then started to \nupload the predacon program.  While this was uploading, she walked \nover to Feline, with a seringe in her hand and injected Feline with a \ndrug that would keep her asleep for several hours.  She then walked \nover to Repressor. &quot;Tell Zardus that I&#39;ll take care of Feline as \nordered.&quot;  She went back and checked her console. The pred program \nwas now 40% uploaded. When the prossess was complete, Feline would be \nthe promiscuos, bold, and deadly bot she once was.  And even more \nloyal to Zardus than before. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
