With sincerity he looks\n&gt; to him.  A look often expressed by someone of wisdom and someone who was\n&gt; willing to help when others would just turn their back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I was appointed a Prime unexpectedly.  A while ago, I had just learned of\n&gt; Rodimus being abducted by Predacon forces, as I too have just recently\n&gt; returned to the Ark.  I went to visit our fallen leader, Optimus Prime, and\n&gt; asked Primus for his help to recover Rodimus.  And before I knew it, I was\n&gt; upgraded to a Prime.  Before that, I attempted to rescue Rodimus myself. No\n&gt; matter the risk, I knew I had to put his safety ahead of my own.  I would do\n&gt; it again and I will.  My purpose is to protect the innocent, even if it is\n&gt; of great risk to my own life.  Tell me, what brings you to a place like\n&gt; this?  You seem to be more understanding than the usual lot.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He walks with Big Convoy, as if walking beside Lord Elder.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIf BIG CONVOY were human he would probrably look like Arnold\nSchwarzenegger as he did in &#39;Predator&#39; or perhaps &#39;Conan&#39; with perhaps\na little of a &#39;Captain America&#39; kind of a feel. He was tall, massive\nand he had a confident air about him, almost a swagger. He felt like a\ngrizzled old soldier, and yet still strong enough to handle anything\nthat was thrown at him.\n\nHe grunted, &quot;I am sure you stand for truth, justice and the\nCybertronian way?&quot; There was a bit of dark humor in his words as he\nwalked with TUSCON. &quot;I am here because I was captured and brought\nhere, just as you have been brought here.&quot;\n\nBIG had brought TUSCON into a large holding area where many different\ntransformers were being held. At least four or five other figures were\nlounging about. Some looked up at BIG and nodded while others just sat\nin the corner looking sullen.\n\nIn the center stood SCOURGE, or perhaps one of his sweeps, it was hard\nto tell with them, and he was practicing with a bladed weapon against\na pole in the center of the room.\n\nBIG smiled a dark sardonic smile, &quot;Welcome to the pens.&quot; he said\nhumorlessly. &quot;Here is where we learn to survive.&quot;\n\nPointing out beyond a thick set of bars out into a larger area that\ncould only just be barely made out beyond them, &quot;And out there is\nwhere we fight for the pleasure of those that hold us.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
