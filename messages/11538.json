Something that was hard to\ntell, but easy if you thought hard.  BrightBlade was trying to fake the\nMaximals into letting her live.  Those Maximals were too compassionate. \nThat was their major weakness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\tHe went into beast mode, and then connected his mind with Grimmler&#39;s. \nThen, he flashed up an image of BrightBlade standing tall, and a Predacon\nsymbol to her right.  Then suddenly, a big X was on the Predacon symbol,\nand then the Xed Pred symbol diseappeared and a Maximal symbol came up\nbeside BrightBlade.  Then, Grimmler appeared in the image, standing on the\nright of the Maximal symbol.  So now it showed BrightBlade and Grimmler,\nwith a big Maximal symbol in between them.  The Maxi symbol then turned\ninto a.......Big Heart!!!  The heart grew, and then BrightBlade and\nGrimmler were standing inside the heart, kissing!!!!!!!!!  Then everything\ndisappeared, and the words &quot;She Loves You!!!&quot; showed up all over the place.\n Skulletron broke the link to Grimmler&#39;s mind now.  He had to act fast, and\nmake them love each other.  He connected with BrightBlade&#39;s mind, and this\ntime showed an image of all the Predacons beating BrightBlade up.  Then the\nsame image of BrightBlade and the Maximal symbol showed up.  After, that,\nSkulletron sent into her mind the image of her and Grimmler kissing inside\nthe big heart!  It all disappeared as well, and then the words &quot;You Are\nMaximal!!!&quot; showed up along with &quot;He Loves You!&quot;  Skulletron went stared,\nand grinned, waiting to see his chaos begin.\n\n\n"}}
