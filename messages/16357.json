It \nwas\n&gt; StarScreem reporting in from the Alliance base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia picked up the signal. &quot;I hear you Starscreem, KitKats \nrecovering in a\n&gt; CR chamber, but I&#39;m afraid Cave In didn&#39;t make it. Have you met \nwith Zardus\n&gt; yet? Have you made progress with your talks?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He listened for the reply and remembered his troops outside. he \nopened his\n&gt; link again &quot;All clear, you may proceed into the base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He searched through the base checking everything that wasn&#39;t off \nlimits to\n&gt; him, he entered the CR room and saw KitKat up and about. &quot;It&#39;s good \nto see\n&gt; you&#39;re up and about&quot; He observed Drillbit at her side &quot;May I speak \nwith our\n&gt; leader alone?&quot; there was much to discuss before he introduced her \nto thier\n&gt; benafactor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;minime_316@h...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 25, 2000 12:29 PM\n&gt; Subject: All Char\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry for not being able to post yesterday all. I&#39;ve just \nread\n&gt; &gt; about 150 messages, but it&#39;s okay becuase most of them aren&#39;t \nabout\n&gt; &gt; me.(*sob* nobody loves me...). And Iron Raptor, I don&#39;t mean to be\n&gt; &gt; rude or anything, but who gives you the right to make the \nscamatics\n&gt; &gt; for my weapon? Too late now, I&#39;ll go with it, but just e-mail me \nnext\n&gt; &gt; time and I&#39;ll telly ou about what you want to know. I&#39;m also gonna\n&gt; &gt; scratch the post where Gotron went to Dark One&#39;s help. I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; really following the battle, so I&#39;m going to get him to do stuff \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Starscream.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vulois\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vulois looked the two Vok up and down. Powerful, but they should \nbe\n&gt; &gt; able to beat them. He put his arm around Child and stared at the\n&gt; &gt; villains.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is my mountain, and will soon be a scared place of the \nOracle!\n&gt; &gt; Leave now or feel our power withing!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brix patted Ramulus on the back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know. You were pretty goo up there. You came in when we\n&gt; &gt; needed it. A few more trips and and you&#39;ll get the hang of it. \nAnd we\n&gt; &gt; may need some more trips before this is done. Now what&#39;s this comp\n&gt; &gt; have to say?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Starscream/Gotron\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Starscream came out of his CR Chamber in the Alliance base. He\n&gt; &gt; thought about what he should do. He needing to know how his group \nwas\n&gt; &gt; doing. He had been thinking about Phobia&#39;s action on the ship, \nand he\n&gt; &gt; wanted to save everyone and was willing t give his life, so he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; valiant. That means he&#39;s probably not in with Megatron. He sent a\n&gt; &gt; message.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Phobia, it&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the Alliance base. How is \neveryone\n&gt; &gt; doing? Did KitKat and Cave-In get their CR Chambers? And are we \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; anything against Megatron?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Starscream walked down the hall and entered the caf. He really had\n&gt; &gt; nothing to do until his group came to the Alliance, so he&#39;d go \nhang\n&gt; &gt; out. When he go their though, he saw a familiar face.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gotron!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Starscream! What are you doing here?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A little ambassador stuff. What about you?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m Alliance, remember?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh yeah.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come. Have some energon with me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The two sat down and started getting drunk.\n&gt; &gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prebon kissed Spears. He had never felt like this before. She \nalmost\n&gt; &gt; made him want to give up his real girl. Maybe he should put chips \nin\n&gt; &gt; all the fembots. He could be the player of the NBW!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You mis-understand what were doing. We are only telling Ramulus \nthat\n&gt; &gt; we will mett him in a few days. We are not taking Striker with us.\n&gt; &gt; When we get back, there will be plenty of time to say good-bye.&quot; \nHe\n&gt; &gt; kissed Spears&#39; again as Ignatius flew down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Now, if you hop on Ignatius we&#39;ll be ready to begin.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Bullet went to the guard position by Striker&#39;s cell. He\n&gt; &gt; thouht to himself that with him here and Blaze controlling the \ncell\n&gt; &gt; guns that the only way this person could get out is if they were \nan\n&gt; &gt; ultimate strategist. Than again, Bullet is pretty stupid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
