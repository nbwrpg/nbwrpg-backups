The faster it flashes\n&gt; the closer we are.  Right now we&#39;re really far from him but according ta\n&gt; this it&#39;s taking a North by Northwest direction.  Follow this and it will\n&gt; eventually take us ta where he went.  Look, times like these calls for the\n&gt; skills of a Ninjabot.  I&#39;m a specially trained special ops Ninja bot\n&gt; officer.  I vote ya let me go on ahead and follow the track and then send\n&gt; for you guys when I get there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Tucson gives a slow bow of his head as an okay to be met at the\n&gt; med bay.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, yes, I would like that.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - Wing Caliber&gt;\n\nWING CALIBER nodded as he tried to help TUSCON to walk, &quot;You need to\ntake it easy for a while.&quot; CALIBER&#39;s voice was that of a teacher or\ninstructor, a habit he often fell into after his centuries of helping\nto turn out new recruits back on Cybertron.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I want to see my mommie&quot;whined the little girl\n\nThere was a smile from WING CALIBER as he looked over at EILTA, &quot;I\nwould think that since we are all headed to the medical bay that your\nmother would know to find you there too. I sent LEO PRIME a message\nsaying that a few moments ago.&quot;\n\n(TAG - My next post later on will be in the medical bay)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
