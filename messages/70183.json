I almost \n&gt;&gt; forgot! Lord Elder, Rat Trap here, and I got great news. Wheels did it \n&gt;&gt; sir. He was able ta jump start Rodimus and Rodimus is back on our side... \n&gt;&gt; Ughhh, ummm, un - fortunately.. But, at least he&#39;s on our side again.. \n&gt;&gt; Anyway, they&#39;re still tryn&#39; ta get Nightlight&#39;n Windlord outa there, and \n&gt;&gt; as far as I know, Rodimus sprung everyone. Well, that wouldn&#39;tve been \n&gt;&gt; possible if Wheels hadn&#39;t gotten through ta him. Anyway, that&#39;s the \n&gt;&gt; report, over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Elder sat back in his chair, a broad smile coming over his face as he \n&gt; listened. He looked over at Elita, &quot;You see, it is alright. Rodimus has \n&gt; been rescued.&quot; he said as he leaned forward in his chair.\n&gt;\n&gt; He keyed his mic so that the others would pick up his transmission, &quot;I am \n&gt; relaying this information to the others as well, I am sure that Lord \n&gt; Perseus and the other maximals will be happy to hear that we have Rodimus \n&gt; back.&quot; Elder said.\n&gt;\n&gt; Elder was troubled though as he transmitted the data to Legacy at the \n&gt; Maximal base.\n&gt;\n&gt; *     *     *     *     *\n&gt;\n&gt; Meawhile . . .\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LEGACY\n&gt; Location: Old Maximal Base - Temporary Command Center\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy received the information from Lord Elder, his single optic pulsing \n&gt; as he read it. He looked up from the screen as he opened a communication \n&gt; channel, and boosted the gain on it with his own not inconsiderable \n&gt; skills.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Autobots and Maximals!&quot; Legacy&#39;s powerful voice and transmission arced \n&gt; over the network, attempting to reach anyone that was in the vicinity of \n&gt; the Maximal base or in the area surrounding it. (OOC: It should reach \n&gt; anyone unless they don&#39;t want it to reach them)\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus has been freed from Hydras&#39; control and now he, Tuscon, as well \n&gt; as those that accompanied him are under fire within Hydras&#39; base. I \n&gt; predict with a 98.2775% certainty that they will need our assistance in \n&gt; order to be extricated from this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he talked Legacy had been on the move. he had already exited the \n&gt; temporary command center and was walking to the exit of the base. &quot;I \n&gt; request any back up that can be made available for this endeavor.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; When he reached the outside Legacy shifted form, becoming a military \n&gt; satellite, complete with guns, scanners and communication gear. &quot;I am en \n&gt; route, and will send data and co ordinates as requested.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy took to the air!\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
