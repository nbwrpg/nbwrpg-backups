Twenty five blasts struck Vehement&#39;s armor, not \npenetrating it or even coming close to it.\n\nThe ginormous robot stretched an arm with a sick smile.  His left arm \ntransformed into a wide cannon as a eight foot long broadsword appeared in \nhis right hand.\n\nRaising the cannon of an arm, he launching two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles at Iron Raptor&#39;s abdomen.\n\nMoving the point of the broadsword to point at Condor, a fire ball errupting \nfrom it at the enemy&#39;s chest.\n\n---\n\nReflector felt a surge of power, that told him Unicron was siphoning more \npower to him.  Getting up and ignoring the pain as twenty-three shots dug \ninto his body, he raised an arm, launching two missile at IRIS from his wrist \ncannon.\n\n---\n\nSun Crusher rolled to the left, the explosions from the charge sending him \nflipping through the air, slamming painfully to his legs, almost causing him \nto crash to the ground.  &quot;That&#39;s it, heathens,&quot; he said, spitting mech-fluid \ninto the burnt grass before him, &quot;you want to die painfully, be my guest.&quot;\n\nWith that, his shaped twisted into the form of a tank, Sun Crusher the hover \ntank bringing a long barrel to point at the CF, launching three explosive \nshells from the bowels of the tank.\n\n---\n\nUnicron, still disguised as Unitron, activated a comm. link to all Alliance \nmembers at the scene of the Cybertronian Fire.  \n\n&quot;All Alliance warriors, this is Unitron,&quot; his voice sounding exactly like \nUnitron&#39;s, his appearance the same as well, &quot;I received orders from Zardus, \nleave everyone alone and focus solely on crippling the Cybertronian Fire \nbeyond repair.  Then make a full retreat.&quot;\n\n===\n\nShockwave was flying at his top speed for atmospheric conditions in his space \nfighter mode, arming all his weapons.  The cause would not fall.\n\n===\n\nHot Spot looked at two CR chambers, noticing First Aid and Blades were still \nbadly damaged.  He then looked over to Groove and Streetwise.\n\n&quot;Blades is closer to being repaired.  I will stay here and have him go out to \nhelp you while you attack the enemies outside.\n\nGroove and Streetwise nodded, runinng as fast as they could for their nearest \nexit out of the ship that wasn&#39;t a large hole in the ship.\n\n\n"}}
