Here is how I looke at it.\nThe first Cybertronian war was the revolutionary war where the Cybertron\nbots rebelled against the Quints. The second Cybertronian war was the\nGreat War where the Decepticons attempted to take power, the one that\nended with Rodimus&#39; speach at the end of TF:TM. The third Cybertronian\nwar is the second Great War where Galvatron and the Deceps returned in\nthe third and fourth season of the show. so when I said second Great\nWar, I ment the third Cybertronian war.\n\n::Hot Rod::\n\nHe brought his arms to a &quot;x&quot; formation, blocking Unitron&#39;s knee.\nHe brought his leg behind Unitron&#39;s leg, and pushed on him, trying to\nmake him trip.\n&quot;The Matrix chose me as the successor. I was the one the prophacy spoke\nof. I was the one the rose through the ranks and used the Matrix, to\nlight the Autobot&#39;s darkest hour.&quot;\n\n"}}
