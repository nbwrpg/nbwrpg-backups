Why would Dracona do this? She couldn&#39;t be repr=\r\nogrammed, she had a device that could prevent it. Plintissa knew that her o=\r\nnly friend was against her.\n\n    &quot;Artist, we have to go back and try to con=\r\nvince Dracona.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n    &quot;I agree, we must face danger, and not=\r\n flee. Oops.&quot; Artist said. Plintissa snickered.\n\n    &quot;It&#39;s okay, Artist, if=\r\n you have to rhyme, then rhyme.&quot; Plintissa said. Artist smiled and both of =\r\nthem returned to Team Ultima&#39;s base.\n\n    Dracona looked to Train Wreck.\n\n =\r\n   &quot;YOU! What are you doing?&quot; Dracona yelled. Train Wreck smiled.\n\n    &quot;Ste=\r\naling your equipment, what does it look like?&quot; Train Wreck said. Dracona gr=\r\nowled.\n\n    &quot;I thought I reprogrammed you!&quot; Dracona said.\n\n    &quot;Yeah? I use=\r\nd your own invention against you! And I used it on my friends, too!&quot; Train =\r\nWreck said. Arrow stepped up by Train Wreck. They both looked at Blender an=\r\nd Stronghold. B;ender walks up. Stronghold does. Stronghold reaches out and=\r\n grabs Train Wreck, forcing him down and sticking a rifle to the back of hi=\r\ns head. Blender grabs Arrow and drags him down as well.\n\n    &quot;Sorry old fri=\r\nends, but Dracona&#39;s deal is a BETTER deal!&quot; Blender said.\n\n    &quot;Outside, I =\r\ndon&#39;t want any blood in the base.&quot;  Dracona said. Train Wreck and Arrow wer=\r\ne drug outside. Train Wreck suddenly lurched out and hit Blender. Stronghol=\r\nd was hit by Arrow, who had escaped. Stronghold and Blender chased Arrow an=\r\nd Train Wreck into the jungle. Stronghold struggles with Train Wreck. Arrow=\r\n is hit so hard by Blender he is put into stasis lock. Train Wreck is beat =\r\nsenseless by both of S.A.B. Inc. (Stronghold and Blender Incompany.) Train =\r\nWreck tries all of his submissions but Stronghold and Blender always save e=\r\nach other. Train Wreck is held in the air by Stronghold. Blender laughs. Tr=\r\nain Wreck is almost dead, his mech fluid is flooding the jungle and is almo=\r\nst drowning Arrow. Blender pops a spinning saw blade from his forearm and s=\r\nlams it through Train Wreck. Stronghold drops Train Wreck and laughs. Blend=\r\ner reaches down and snaps Train Wreck&#39;s neck. Blender and Stronghold bow to=\r\n each other and turn to Arrow. Arrow wakes up for a few seconds and looks a=\r\nt them.\n\n    &quot;Wha?&quot; Arrow asks. Stronghold reaches out and looks into a hol=\r\ne. He sweeps all of Train Wreck&#39;s mech fluid into it.\n\n    &quot;Sayonara ass!&quot; =\r\nBlender said. Stronghold jumps into the pit of mech fluid and sticks Arrow&#39;=\r\ns head under. Arrow finally stops struggling. Stronghold drops Arrow and Bl=\r\nender kicks him. They both laugh and walk back towards Team Ultima base. Th=\r\ney both take out cigars and smoke them in satisfaction of their acompishmen=\r\nts.\n\n    Stranato suddenly grabs his chest in pain. Airbomber stares at him=\r\n. Stranato suddenly starts changing form. Stranato now looks a little diffe=\r\nrent. Airbomber screams and is also slightly morphed.\n\n    &quot;What does this =\r\nmean?&quot; Airbomber asked Stranato.\n\n    &quot;It means that...Train Wreck and Arro=\r\nw are dead. I can feel it.&quot; Stranato said.\n\n    &quot;What? How?&quot; Airbomber said=\r\n desperatley.\n\n    &quot;It appears our plan didn&#39;t work out.&quot; Stranato said.\n\n =\r\n   &quot;Plan?&quot; Airbomber replies.\n\n    &quot;Yes, none of the Radiocns were reprogra=\r\nmmed really.&quot; Stranato replied sadly.\n\n    &quot;Then why are Train Wreck and Ar=\r\nrow dead?&quot; Airbomber asked.\n\n    &quot;They were killed...by Stronghold and Blen=\r\nder.&quot; Stranato replied sadly.\n\n    &quot;WHAT! Our friends killed out friends!?!=\r\n?!?!?&quot; Airbomber said.\n\n    &quot;Sadly, yes, they betrayed us, but out friends,=\r\n now live on in us.&quot; Stranato said.\n\n    &quot;Huh?&quot; Airbomber questioned.\n\n    =\r\n&quot;Their sparks joined in with ours, we now posses their power, the Radicons =\r\nare no more, let us say goodbye to our good friends as their spiritual spar=\r\nks head toward the Matrix. Airbomber and Stranato stood in silence, salutin=\r\ng Arrow and Train Wreck. Airbomber puts his arm around Infectra and cries. =\r\nStranato also cannot keep character, and is crying as well.\n\n    Gangon sta=\r\nrts to fade away, realizing he isn&#39;t wanted anymore.\n     \n    Lightmare&#39;s =\r\nspark floats slowly toward the Matrix, unsure if she wants to go there. Arr=\r\now and Train Wreck&#39;s sparks come by. Lightmare&#39;s spark notices them. The fo=\r\nrmer Radicons floated into the Matrix. Lightmare&#39;s spark lit up and followe=\r\nd them.\n\n    Deemos and Inzoola sit there VERY bored. They couldn&#39;t believe=\r\n that nobody was paying attention to them!\n\n    &quot;I don&#39;t believe this, how =\r\ncan they treat me like this!?&quot; Deemos yelled.\n\n    &quot;If your bored, we could=\r\n always go find a spot and...be alone.&quot; Inzola said. Deemos just stared col=\r\ndly. Inzola frowned, she knew Deemos felt unimportant, but right now he was=\r\n making her feel pretty unimportant, too!\n\n    Sinesis is still healing up =\r\nin the CR Chamber of Team Ultima base.\n\n    Dracona calls Zardus on her com=\r\nm unit.\n\n    &quot;Zardus, this is former Alliance warrior Dracona, I wish to ma=\r\nke...an Alliance with the Alliance.&quot; She said.\n\n    Plintissa noticed Stron=\r\nghold and Blender, she and Artist slowly sneaking up behind them.\n\n    Sini=\r\nster is &quot;Alone&quot; with Blizzard...\n\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_07DB_01BFFB69.8F34C000\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2919.6307&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Dracona walks over t=\r\no Twister.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&quot;Hello.&quot; Drac=\r\nona said dryly...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2=\r\npx solid; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-R=\r\nIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- =\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial; font-color=\r\n: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:ilovealllizards@...&quot; \n  =\r\ntitle=3Dilovealllizards@...&gt;ilovealllizards&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@egroups.com&quot; \n  t=\r\nitle=3Dnbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, August 01, 2000 1:56 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: The End Is \n  Near........=\r\n...........................................&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;~~~~~~~~~~Infectra/Twister~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;*Infectra frowns and puts her arms around Airbomber.
