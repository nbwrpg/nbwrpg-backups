I got \na message from Striker, but it was too static to make out. I&#39;m meeting with \nPrebon soon. I have a feeling its a trap, though, Spears didn&#39;t seem like she \nwas herself. Besides, she&#39;s been implanted with the chip, and I&#39;m not sure if \nPrebon removed it. There are some cloaking devices in the equipment room. A \nfew of you could come along in case things get ugly.&quot;\n\n"}}
