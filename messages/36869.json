Insaide the ship Vile frantically presses \nbuttons trying to get the transwarp gate device to activate. Soon the \nmassive ship passes over Maximal city although the ship was still \nhigh in the sky. If any maximals were paying attention they could see \nthe ship.. but only for a brief mintue or so for just as the ship got \nover the city the transwarp gate activated and the ship dissapeared...\n(whee no they didnt leave the RP Im just jusing that so they can \ncrash were their supposed to quicker).\n\nElsewhere, at the Trainer base battle, the shots fired at the \nInfecticon ship are all absorbed into its shield. Inside the Ship the \nleader of the Infecticon strike force looks to one of the massive \nenergy beings before her.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;Hellpeon, we will be departing from this battle and \nheading to a secure location. I want to remain here and make sure \nthat base is destroyed.&quot;\n\nThe being infront of Frostbite nods before a panel opens beneath the \nbeast sending him flying down at high speeds. The shields around the \nIfnecticon ship dissapear for a second as the Infecticon enforcer, \nHellpeon speeds down to the ground and lands a short distance behind \nstarscream, the impact forming a large crater beind the bot. Above, \nthe Ifnecticon ship seemingly dissapears as it phase shifts. A moment \nlater the ship heads off to find a secure area. As ths happens \nHellpeon flys up out of the crater he had just made at high speeds \nand lands behind Starscream. Without a shred of warning the black \nenergy beast gathers Chaochitan energy into its palms before \nlaunching a beam of it at starscream, as the beam travels the ground \nbeneath it cracks and breaks from the force of it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Vile cannon struck the shields rocking the base once \nmore. &quot;This will\n&gt; never do&quot; the computer stated as it locked a tractor beam on the \nground to\n&gt; stabilize the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscreams shots were becoming annoying. The bot had no hope of \nbringing\n&gt; the shields down with such low level weaponry. the autogun fired \nfour more\n&gt; shots at Starscream. (Hint, Starscream can do damage to the shields \nif you\n&gt; can remember one weapon he has in his arscenal.)\n\n\n"}}
