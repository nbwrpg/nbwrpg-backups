He was happy to have passengers, because to him, having his \n&gt; comrades around was a great comfort.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Of course Perceptor, hop in, my door is open on the passenger side.  I \n&gt; just wish I could take all of you somewhere where we&#39;ve all never been \n&gt; before, but without my visual sensors, I&#39;m afraid my journeys are a bit \n&gt; restricted to sonar range.  I promise all of you though, that as soon as I \n&gt; am repaired, I would like to explore this planet with all of you, after we \n&gt; settle this crisis we&#39;re undergoing now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He had forgotten to talk to Perceptor not only as a leader, but as a \n&gt; friend.  This was a great opportunity to do just that.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Perceptor, I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you something for a while, and I&#39;m \n&gt; sorry it wasn&#39;t right away.  But we have some time now, and I want you to \n&gt; know that I don&#39;t want you to feel enslaved under my command, I want you \n&gt; to know that you can always talk to me as a friend, and formality isn&#39;t a \n&gt; must around me.  All I ask is that you do your best, and if you don&#39;t \n&gt; succeed at something, do not hold that against you.  Everyone comes to a \n&gt; road block sooner or later, but those road blocks end up being learning \n&gt; experiences and when you come to it again, you learn how to get around it. \n&gt; That&#39;s how I want you and everyone else to feel.  Of course, the only \n&gt; thing that will bother me, is malice among comrades.  Other than that, I \n&gt; am by no means the punnishing type.  And if I&#39;ve forgotten to say this, \n&gt; I&#39;m saying it now.  Welcome to my aliance.  Your skills are most valuable \n&gt; to our factions, and I&#39;m honored to have you among us.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor/Talon:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; talon came in to Tucson she knew that Tucson dint mind, Perceptor \n&gt;&gt; aproached\n&gt;&gt; and said &quot;May I come in...

He did not want any fighting in the Ark among \n&gt;&gt; &gt; any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Maximal, Predacon or Autobot for that matter.  But bringing them all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; together under one banner would be most difficult especially to a new\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Prime who was just starting out.  He uses his sonar systems to follow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramulus, Cheetor and Lord Elder, transforms into truck mode, and rolls \n&gt;&gt; &gt; at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a reasonable speed up to Lord Elder, and rolls slowly beside him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Your words are very wise Lord Elder.  Bringing everyone together will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not be easy, and I admit, I don&#39;t know everything either.  But I do \n&gt;&gt; &gt; know\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that I sense great strength among our group, a strength I&#39;ve never \n&gt;&gt; &gt; quite\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sensed before.  A strength to overcome differences and to be able to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; work\n&gt;&gt; &gt; together under one roof.  We just need to learn how to tap into that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; strength and we haven&#39;t quite gotten that far, at least, I haven&#39;t.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He stops and opens his door to Lord Elder.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Get in, wheels work faster than feet.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Must we always assume the worst Cheetor?

If he were to turn his back on us, he would have done\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that vorns ago. Now, I will not hear another negative word about\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Perceptor. Not in my pressence. He has risked his life for us, and \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; now\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we must do him the respect of showing him our thanks for his \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; efforts.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now, enough bickering, we have a tunnel to seal off and Rodimus \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Prime\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to bring back online. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to see any of you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bickering either. Am I understood Cheetor?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheetor looked at Tuscon, his optics cool yet dim, then he finally\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nodded, &quot;You are in charge.&quot; he said, sounding sullen and crestfallen.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;If you say it, then it must be true.&quot; He turned and began walking\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back toward the Ark, his shoulders slumped, his head bowed a little.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramulus had glanced back at Cheetor and then Tuscon, and then just\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shook his head again as he continued to walk away. He had been helping\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rhinox, perhaps it was time for him to return to that mission. Too\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much time around the Ark never made him feel good. he prefered the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wide open out doors, not to be confined to and one spot.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, ya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knows\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his words of wisdom. Definitely what Optimus Prime would&#39;ve done.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Lord Elder watched Cheetor walk back to the Ark as well, as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; listened to Quickstride. Elder folded his arms behind his back as he\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; turned to look back at Quickstride, &quot;Is it?&quot; Elder asked.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Trust cannot be demanded or commanded only earned.&quot; He said quietly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor was not with you to watch the events that you saw that caused\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you to come to trust Perceptor, how can he be expected to trust\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without it?&quot; Elder&#39;s voice was not accusatory but calm and reasoning.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Cheetor only knows what he sees here and now, and that is a Predacon\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that he has fought against for a long time. It will take time to get\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; over that, to see him as a companion, perhaps one day as a friend.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder turned to look back at Perceptor, &quot;And it will take Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time to come to realize his new role here, and that the life that he\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has known has ended, he has a new part to play.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder looked at Cheetor and Ramulus for a moment, watching each one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; walk away in different directions. &quot;It is Tuscon&#39;s job now to bring us\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; together, unite us under a common banner. That is the hardest part of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; being a leader, not just leading but inspiring others to follow.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Elder turned to follow after Cheetor, his steps quick to catch up with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the swift Maximal, he would need a pep talk.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
