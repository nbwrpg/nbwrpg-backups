The missile had a glowing blue \nfield, designed to bounce any beams off of it, and upon detonation it \nwould create an energy field 6 feet in radius, draining any bot in \nrange (same missiles that I used the last battle).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing his target flying at FZ, Prowl fires two more missiles at \nUnicron.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Unicron: \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The robot could feel someone watching him, and the life force of \nUnitron and \n&gt; and those with him falling.
