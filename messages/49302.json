So \n&gt; Megatron would be hiding and poking his weapons over\n&gt; to fire at the \n&gt; moment, having some protection against weaponfire. \n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially, SS couldn&#39;t have gotten behind him,\n&gt; grabbed his wrist \n&gt; (which would be a mode anyway), and fired a laser at\n&gt; the back of his \n&gt; neck etc. I guess I need to work on my posting some\n&gt; more then to \n&gt; make stuff like that clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is, of course, provided that Tyrael is where I\n&gt; had thought he \n&gt; was. If not, we have a minor problem. =p\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
