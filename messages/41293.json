His face grinned a grin very much resembling the megalomaniacle tyrant\nhis DNA was patterned from. (Megatron.)  &quot;My name is Megaton and I dare to\ntell you to stop.&quot; his grin faded to a sneer letting his attitude show.\n\n&quot;My intentions are not to join you but to bring all factions of this planet\ntogether whether it be in chains or in peace is entirely up to all.&quot; the\nleadership qualities of a Predacon/ Decepticon leader were to be willing to\nchallenge anyone in the way of leadership. The ritual was also a sign of\nrespect and admiration. If a leader was to find an opponent worth\nchallenging it was usually as an equal. &quot;And in this case Megatron must be\nreplaced by a higher grade of bot such as myself.&quot; He knew he&#39;d need the\nentire package  , Necromancers strength and Megatrons cunning, if his\npowerplay was to succeed.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;gunthers@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, August 03, 2001 11:50 AM\nSubject: Re: After the pain.\n\n\n&gt; OOC at bottom towards cyberwolf\n&gt;\n&gt; Havotron heard the loud dragon.  Suddenly coming to a halt he\n&gt; yelled &quot;WHO DARES TELL THE GREAT HAVOTRON TO STOP.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; After the dragon landed he listened contently.  &quot;You, may, join the\n&gt; ranks of the D.E.D.  Decepticons for Earth&#39;s Domination....or\n&gt; Demise...  I am Lord Havotron, leader of the D.E.D, and future ruler\n&gt; of the universe. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Needlenose looked at the dragon eerily.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile back with the Contstructicons.  Scrapper looked to the\n&gt; speck in the distance that was Havotron.  &quot;Constructicons, listen\n&gt; to me....Havotron has not been fair to us, mad because one of our\n&gt; ranks could not complete the joining into the gestalt.  Would\n&gt; Megatron, no I don&#39;t beleive so.  I have devised a plan, to bring the\n&gt; real leader of the Decepticons back to power, we, the\n&gt; Constructicons will re-join with Megatron.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC:  Cyberwolf, the D.E.D are another faction of Decepticons,\n&gt; with the leader Havotron.  Thier base is inside of Mt Fuji, not with\n&gt; the other Decepticons which base is now moving slowly through\n&gt; Hudsons bay.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
