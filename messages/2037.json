The ship, desolated, creaked as \nit&#39;s wings smashed into the ground, a whole in the side of the ship blowing \nout, a 7 ft robot emerging, cursing, heading in the direction of the Alliance \nbase::\n\n==================\n\n::Bumblebee continued to jog, stopping in bushes as he saw the commotion at \nthe Predacon base::\n&quot;Hmmm...nothing to offer but my skills...guess it will have to do...&quot; he \nwhispered to himself, stepping out of the bushes, arms raised in the air.\n&quot;Hold your fire!  I wish to join your cause!&quot; he yelled, to no one particular \nas he scanned across the faces of all the Predacons outside of the Pred base. \n::\n\n=================\n\n::Scattershot, a bald eagle, looked down from 500ft in the air, above the \nAlliance base, noticing the guard outside of it (Zergling)::\n&quot;Now, is a chance to prove, I am not utterly useless, to the enemies of these \nrobots...&quot; he whispered, his voice almost inaudible as it was drowned out by \nthe wing, though he didn&#39;t make a move, except flying through the air, soon \ntaking a perch on a tree::\n&quot;When the time coves of course.&quot; he whispered once more.\n\n=================\n\n::Koga Shuko sighed, hearing Set::\n&lt;Very well, Set, but you better not let those filthy savages win.  We&#39;ve \ninvested to much in this project.  The energon, Pre-Third Cybertronian War \ntechnology, and Oblitercons will be ours!&gt;\n\n&lt;Unitron, Anubis, Annhialator, Killer, and Hades, my scanners tell me that \nthe forces have retreated back to their bases.  Unitron, Anubis, and Hades \nwill accompany me on an attack of an enemy base.  Killer and Annhialator, and \nall other personel will stay here, and defend the base.  I have spoken, \neveryone has five cycles to gear up, meet me outside of the ship.&gt;\n::Musing with a thought, Koga Shuko, the wealthy Predacon, took out a \nmetallic flask, and a small metal tweezer.  Then Shuko grabbed a laser rifle \nand gattling gun, putting them both in subspace, heading for the designated \narea he ordered his troops to go. ::\n\n--------------------------\n\n::Unitron, Anubis, and Hades all heard Koga Shuko&#39;s orders, reloading their \nweapons and waiting in silence as they watched scattered flames burn across \nthe battlefield::\n\n\n"}}
