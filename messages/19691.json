She was taller than him. She looked at \nherself and wondered how this could have happened.  She tested her \nwings and started to lift herself off the floor. She stopped and set \nback down. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Can we go and test it out now. I \nwant to know all I can about this form. This is something that I have \nnever experienced before.&quot;  Then she felt something else move inside, \nbut it wasn&#39;t wires. She was hungry. &quot;And I need to hunt, soon, very \nsoon.&quot; She  moved her head closer to Veratis and sniffed his scent.  \nHe smelled different, alive. Her scence of smell was highly developed \nand so was her hearing. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Veratis stepped forward placing a hand on her fur. He heard her \nspeak \n&gt; so he knew her transformation was successfull. She stood taller \nthan \n&gt; him in her bear mode. he placed his hands on her wings, by all \nlogic \n&gt; they shouldn&#39;t have existed. somehow her memories triggered this \n&gt; change. He scanned her entire body, it was healthy whatever she was.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know what you did to change the dna sequencing but somehow \n&gt; your owl form showed up.&quot; His mind was filled with a thousand \n&gt; questions but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to ask them all. &quot;Just rest \n&gt; for now and when you&#39;re 100 percent we&#39;ll go outside and try out \nyour \n&gt; new form.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &gt; She looked down and sighed heavily.

She wondered if he would still be happy to see her in her \nnew \n&gt; &gt; form. She looked at Veratis. &quot;Yes, I understand. What am I \nsupposed \n&gt; &gt; to do now?

Her internal circuits were in the last stages of \n&gt; &gt; generation.  She held onto the table for suport. She fell to her \n&gt; &gt; knees nd transformed into beast mode. The form was in finally \n&gt; stages \n&gt; &gt; of completetion.  Normall a bot is asleep through this and \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; experience pain, but she was wide awake and going through the \n&gt; ordeal. \n&gt; &gt; She transformed into polar bear with the owl wings protruding \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; her shoulder blades.
