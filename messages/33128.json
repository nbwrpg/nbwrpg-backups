He tried to \nposition himself between Diana and the monster in a weak attempt to protect \nher from the creature.

The ship was falling apart and there just \nweren&#39;t enough cooperating &#39;bots left to fix it.\n\n&quot;Just great.&quot;\n\nHysteria sighed as she continued to work her way through the ship fixing \nwhat little she could.\n\n*****\n\nSwyft nodded to DevilDuer and followed closely behind him as they entered \nthe ship. It was impressive alright. It looked like she picked a nice strong \nfaction to align herself with.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Moon Mist&quot; &lt;shadowwarrior_ax@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: CF and Diana\n&gt;Date: Fri, 20 Apr 2001 20:37:58 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rage stormed after the two tiny things that her stomach craved, but \n&gt;suddenly\n&gt;stopped in a skid when they turned to face her.\n&gt;What were they doing?

Rage snapped out with her jaws, hoping to catch one of the \n&gt;little\n&gt;pests in its lock.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
