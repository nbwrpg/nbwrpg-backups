Just then, as she looked over \nher shoulder, a large guns=\r\nhip came barlling in her direction.  She \ntried scanning it for energy sign=\r\natures, and got scrambled results.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The gunship saw the ship in troubl=\r\ne and altered it&#39;s course.  It \ntransformed, and Megatron Revived dived for=\r\nward.  He dropped his \nshield, sword and fusion cannon and touched off his =\r\nverniers.  The \nmighty robot got just infront of the craft and then slammed=\r\n into \nit.  He then went full open, trying to kill off some of the ships \ns=\r\npeed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; It was her, the one she=\r\n sought approaching her.

Very\n&gt; &gt; interesting, I shall entertain the idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; IC:\n&gt; &gt; Organi=\r\ncs:\n&gt; &gt; The tall and graceful form of the valkyrie stirred,\n&gt; &gt; a transmiss=\r\nion disupted her sleep cycle. Organics\n&gt; &gt; stirred and slowly set up, repla=\r\nying the\n&gt; &gt; transmission. Realizing the danger, she scrambled\n&gt; &gt; out of h=\r\ner quarters after she grabbed her shield and\n&gt; &gt; sword and ran to the comma=\r\nnd area. She franticly\n&gt; &gt; searched the consoles for the shield controls. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Finally finding them, she dropped the shields and\n&gt; &gt; dashed outside. S=\r\nhe spotted the striken craft and\n&gt; &gt; then jumped into action. She flew into=\r\n the air then\n&gt; &gt; tansformed into her space fighter mode and flew to\n&gt; &gt; he=\r\nlp the shuttle correct it&#39;s course.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kyle Stewart wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Fortun=\r\neteller&#39;s shuttle raced towards earth. She\n&gt; &gt; laid within the small sleek =\r\ncraft, barely large\n&gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; for her slender form, and light equipmen=\r\nt. In one\n&gt; &gt; hand she held her staff, she preferred to use it as\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n melee weapon, but it was quite capable of delivering\n&gt; &gt; energy blasts of =\r\nmoderate power. In her other hand\n&gt; &gt; she held twenty bolts. They were her =\r\npower, by how\n&gt; &gt; they fell she could see the future to some extent. \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nhe was nothing to compare with Seer, Ex, her\n&gt; &gt; beloved\n&gt; &gt; Deus, or even =\r\nMachina, but she had some skill, and\n&gt; &gt; had\n&gt; &gt; stolen some destiny energy=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She blew on the bolts, and asked them, &quot;What is so\n&gt; &gt; important=\r\n about this `Organics&#39;, why does the\n&gt; &gt; destiny\n&gt; &gt; energy settle about he=\r\nr so. She threw them, and saw\n&gt; &gt; many patterns gather. Most of them were i=\r\nndistinct,\n&gt; &gt; representing the chaotic course of destiny, but one\n&gt; &gt; was =\r\nquite clear, one bolt laying against another,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; a third before th=\r\nem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;A potential child,&quot; chuckled Fortuneteller, &quot;well\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll so=\r\non put a stop to that.&quot; She whispered to the\n&gt; &gt; bolts again &quot;Who is the fa=\r\nther?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bolts were once again unclear, showing four\n&gt; &gt; separat=\r\ne possible candidates, but one was most\n&gt; &gt; distinct, taking ten bolts in h=\r\nis pattern. His bolts\n&gt; &gt; were chaotic, mad, but still of one pattern.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Finally she asked her final questions of the bolts,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is so sp=\r\necial about this child?&quot; She gasped at\n&gt; &gt; the final pattern. The bolts wer=\r\ne quite clear this\n&gt; &gt; time, while even without her there was no assurance\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the child would exist, beyond the child one future\n&gt; &gt; dominated sevent=\r\neen of the bolts, and the other\n&gt; &gt; three\n&gt; &gt; lay scattered, in un-formed f=\r\nuture. The possible\n&gt; &gt; timeline she would be stealing for the Deviners use=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; would be a very different one indeed. In fear of\n&gt; &gt; loosing the chil=\r\nd the mother would put it onboard\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Ark in stasis, even putting h=\r\nis spark within an\n&gt; &gt; Autobot body. When the child awakened HE, not\n&gt; &gt; Op=\r\ntimus\n&gt; &gt; Prime would become the leader of the Autobots. \n&gt; &gt; Through some =\r\nodd device the mother would both allow\n&gt; &gt; his spark to mature over the eon=\r\ns, and erase all\n&gt; &gt; possible memory of his former life. Under his\n&gt; &gt; guid=\r\nance the Great War would be a massacre of\n&gt; &gt; Decepticons, a future in whic=\r\nh only the Maximals\n&gt; &gt; existed. Her son would be the most ruthless, and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; brilliant transformer ever to draw energon, but such\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; great lead=\r\ner he would have no need of the Matrix. If\n&gt; &gt; she read them right he even =\r\ndiscovered some way to\n&gt; &gt; destroy Unicron without opening it!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deu=\r\ns would reward her for this. She thought of her\n&gt; &gt; precious Deus, and knew=\r\n as always he was just using\n&gt; &gt; her. She looked at her reflection in the f=\r\norward\n&gt; &gt; shuttle window. She wasn&#39;t old, but worn with the\n&gt; &gt; fading bea=\r\nuty of mid-life. Deus was perhaps older\n&gt; &gt; than she, but his destiny energ=\r\ny kept him looking\n&gt; &gt; ten\n&gt; &gt; cycles younger. Still, she was his to comman=\r\nd, and\n&gt; &gt; she would do as he bid, even to her own death.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She aime=\r\nd her shuttle at the place where she sensed\n&gt; &gt; her pray, slightly beside t=\r\nhe Maximal Base, but\n&gt; &gt; still\n&gt; &gt; within their shields. She sent out a dis=\r\ntress\n&gt; &gt; signal,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;HELLO! UNKNOWN BASE DO YOU COPY! I&#39;M OUT OF\n&gt; &gt; CONT=\r\nROL AND I WILL HIT YOUR SHIELDS IF YOU DO NOT\n&gt; &gt; LOWER THEM! HURRY!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; OOC: All that she envisioned was just a possible\n&gt; &gt; future, don&#39;t thin=\r\nk I&#39;m forcing anyone into anything\n&gt; &gt; (for that matter I&#39;m still waiting o=\r\nn the council to\n&gt; &gt; tell me the restrictions on the Deviners).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Friends.
