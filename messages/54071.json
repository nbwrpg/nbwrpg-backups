Her body and her spark lay there, thought \nto \n&gt; be lost somewhere in time.  But her spark was not to be \nforgotten.  \n&gt; Her optics fluttered and flashed as her spark was awakening \nagain.  \n&gt; The exposed wires in her shoulder sparked as her body lay there.  \n&gt; Her hand moved.  Her body shuttered and she cried out from under \nthe \n&gt; rubble.  Her body resisted at first. But with the sheer will to \n&gt; live, she started to make her way back up to the earth&#39;s surface.  \n&gt; Her hand broke ground and she could feel air movement.  Her optics \n&gt; saw the sun and she screemed out at seeing the sun for the first \n&gt; time in ages.  She climed up and stood on her feet once again.  \n&gt; Then, with a pained cry, she fell to her hands and knees.  Her \nbody \n&gt; covered in rust. Only patches of dull black were the only hint of \n&gt; her once glistening black body.    She fell and laid on the \nground, \n&gt; trembling.  Her power level was extremely low and would not last \n&gt; long.  She opened her forearm compartment and activated a general \n&gt; distress signal.  She prayed that somebot would find her in time.  \n&gt; Her insignia had rusted off.  Her should was still sparking from \nthe \n&gt; exposed wires.  She looked like the pit and felt like it too.  She \n&gt; didn&#39;t even think she had enough energy to transform into wolf \n&gt; mode.  She only hoped she would be found in time.\n\n\n"}}
