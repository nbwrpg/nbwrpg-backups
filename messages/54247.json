Give it time and wars will break out again.  Once the \n&gt; factions reorganize, the wars will be started and fights will \n&gt; ensue.  Besides, give me some time. *grins evilly* yess, there will \n&gt; be fights breaking out.  So relax and have fun. Remember, all wars \n&gt; are not just over survival. Wars are generally political.  So give \n&gt; it enough time for things to fall back into place and the old battle \n&gt; between US and THEM will resume. \n&gt; \n&gt; Logo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&gt; &lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Pardon me for this OOC message, but my thoughts on this will \n&gt; be expressed. I think the problem here is that there is no one \n&gt; taking enough action, number 1, there are no fights and no evil \n&gt; plans being cooked up by the evil team. There needs to be wars \n&gt; started like in the old days and some interesting stories that can \n&gt; affect everyone written as well. Number 2, the character limit \n&gt; prevents people from making their own storylines up, and thus people \n&gt; usually have to rely on hoping they won&#39;t get ignored and waiting \n&gt; for their bots to receive orders from the commanders. Things similar \n&gt; to this are what killed my first Beast Wars RPG.
