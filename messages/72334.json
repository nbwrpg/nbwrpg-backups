Little by little pieces of\n&gt; the mystery were coming to fruition.  Perhaps Cyclonus, Optimus Primal and\n&gt; even Cheetor might have suffered the same fate.  In any event he knew he had\n&gt; to focus on getting everyone out instead of fighting.  He looks back at the\n&gt; guards then back to Big Convoy, implementing an ancient form of sign\n&gt; language that only Autobot kind could communicate with.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; If you can help me, I can help you and everyone else to escape.  It will\n&gt; take some time and careful tactics but with your knowledge of Magmatron, and\n&gt; the layout of this parameter, and both of our skills combined, I know we can\n&gt; escape this prison.  Now, I need to know if Cyclonus, Optimus Primal, or\n&gt; Cheetor have also been taken here.  From here on out, if we communicate this\n&gt; way, they will not understand us.  Anything related to our escape plan will\n&gt; be communicated this way.  Other than that, we play along as they want and\n&gt; later, we gather our plans and execute them.  I know this is a little\n&gt; impromptu for you but, this pit is no place for an established Convoy or\n&gt; Prime.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks to Big with an eye of respect and a confident air of intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 28, 2011, at 12:34 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson felt that somehow he could trust Big Convoy. With sincerity he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; looks\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to him. A look often expressed by someone of wisdom and someone who was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; willing to help when others would just turn their back.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I was appointed a Prime unexpectedly. A while ago, I had just learned\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus being abducted by Predacon forces, as I too have just recently\n&gt;&gt; &gt; returned to the Ark. I went to visit our fallen leader, Optimus Prime,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; asked Primus for his help to recover Rodimus. And before I knew it, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; upgraded to a Prime. Before that, I attempted to rescue Rodimus myself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No\n&gt;&gt; &gt; matter the risk, I knew I had to put his safety ahead of my own. I would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it again and I will. My purpose is to protect the innocent, even if it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of great risk to my own life. Tell me, what brings you to a place like\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this? You seem to be more understanding than the usual lot.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He walks with Big Convoy, as if walking beside Lord Elder.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If BIG CONVOY were human he would probrably look like Arnold\n&gt;&gt; Schwarzenegger as he did in &#39;Predator&#39; or perhaps &#39;Conan&#39; with perhaps\n&gt;&gt; a little of a &#39;Captain America&#39; kind of a feel. He was tall, massive\n&gt;&gt; and he had a confident air about him, almost a swagger. He felt like a\n&gt;&gt; grizzled old soldier, and yet still strong enough to handle anything\n&gt;&gt; that was thrown at him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He grunted, &quot;I am sure you stand for truth, justice and the\n&gt;&gt; Cybertronian way?&quot; There was a bit of dark humor in his words as he\n&gt;&gt; walked with TUSCON. &quot;I am here because I was captured and brought\n&gt;&gt; here, just as you have been brought here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BIG had brought TUSCON into a large holding area where many different\n&gt;&gt; transformers were being held. At least four or five other figures were\n&gt;&gt; lounging about. Some looked up at BIG and nodded while others just sat\n&gt;&gt; in the corner looking sullen.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the center stood SCOURGE, or perhaps one of his sweeps, it was hard\n&gt;&gt; to tell with them, and he was practicing with a bladed weapon against\n&gt;&gt; a pole in the center of the room.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BIG smiled a dark sardonic smile, &quot;Welcome to the pens.&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; humorlessly. &quot;Here is where we learn to survive.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pointing out beyond a thick set of bars out into a larger area that\n&gt;&gt; could only just be barely made out beyond them, &quot;And out there is\n&gt;&gt; where we fight for the pleasure of those that hold us.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
