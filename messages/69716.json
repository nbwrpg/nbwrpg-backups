I=\r\n will be sure to remember to reward \nyou when all is said - and done.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Rat Trap transforms into his rat form, \nand sits up onto Tucson&#39;s hood.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Hope this doesn&#39;t hurt Wheels, but I can \ntalk to ya a lot better o=\r\nn your hood.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson remains perfectly \nstill.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Not - at all.=\r\n Lord Elder, I - have one favor to ask you. I&#39;d - \nlike to pay my respects =\r\nto Optimus - Prime once we arrive at the Ark. Do - I \nhave permission to en=\r\nter the Ark to do so?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Preston \nCarroll &lt;supercyclonus@=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I intend to \nfinish what I start=\r\ned, I will finish my mission,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but after that, do \nnot expect m=\r\ne to have the same amount&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of respect for you when this \nis all=\r\n over Rodimus. But now,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is not the time for that. I see that \n=\r\nwhat I accomplished was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just the first phase. I&#39;ve accomplishe=\r\nd \nthat thus far. I&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; learned for myself what needs to be don=\r\ne, and \nwhat needs&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to be done can&#39;t be completed today. That w=\r\nill have to \nwait.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I believe this=\r\n is where you step \nasside Rodimus, and let us pass.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rodi=\r\nmus stood before Tuscon, \nweapon drawn and ready as the Autobot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wen=\r\nt through his soliloquy, the \nlook on his face hard and resolute.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe Rodimus that stands there, is \nnot exactly the Rodimus Tuscon had&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; once known, the Predacon programing \nhad twisted him, inverted his&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; thoughts, changed him in ways that even he \nfound surprising in some&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; ways.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However even now as this \nlone Autobot spoke abo=\r\nut dedication and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; courage, there was a part of him \nthat was opened=\r\n for a moment, as if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the briefest of seconds a part \nof the old=\r\n Rodimus briefly made an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; appearance . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;NO \nAut=\r\nobot, this is where you face termination!&lt;WBR&gt;&quot; Cyclonus spoke as he&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \nand Scourge caught up, breaking into Rodimus&#39; revelry &quot;It is time to&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \nfinish this!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; Said Skorponok as he stepped out=\r\n of the \nroom, weapons already&lt;BR&gt;&gt; orienting on the Autobot. &quot;He thinks=\r\n he&#39;s Optimus \nPrime&quot; Scorponok&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, his voice sarcastic and mocki=\r\nng, &quot;But he is only \na pale copy.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He chuckled, &quot;But I do so look f=\r\norward to his \ndissection.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scourge just chuckled darkly a=\r\ns he approached, his \nrifle pointed at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tuscon and Rat Trap!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Meanwhile in the \nAutobot shuttle)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickst=\r\nride gets the shuttle airbourne \nand sets the course&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for the t=\r\nower. He tries to lock in on an \nAutobot signature,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and gets R=\r\nat Trap&#39;s readilly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nLord elder nodded as he brought the s=\r\nhuttle as close as he dared to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \nBlack Fortress! He knew how pow=\r\nerful this demesne of the Predacons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; could \nbe. Designed to hold off=\r\n an assault, Lord Elder knew his plan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was risky. \nHe could only hop=\r\ne that Rat Trap had been able to do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; something on his \nside.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Sir, I&#39;ve locked in on Rat Trap&#39;s \nsignature...&lt;WBR&gt;. And y=\r\nes, I do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; see a faint but very faint Autobot \nsignature... It&#39;s=\r\n a bit weaker&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than normal... Which Oh wow, sir, \nthat Autobot =\r\nseems to be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; using a backup battery... Not good... \nBecause whe=\r\nn he loses&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that he&#39;s done for.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&quot;Confirmed.&quot;=\r\n he said as he also saw the same things on his scanner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;The \nsenso=\r\nrs also show several Decepticon and Predacon signatures&lt;BR&gt;&gt; around \nthe=\r\nm, if we don&#39;t do something Tuscon and Rat trap would be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; destroyed =\r\n\nanyway.&quot; With deft fingers he brought the weapons energy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cannons o=\r\nnline \nand quickly brought them to bear on the fortress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nHold onto \nyour seat, this is going to get rough!&quot; Elder said as he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n transferred \npower from the engines to the gunnery platform, in other&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; words throwing \neverything the shuttle had at the Fortress!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; The shuttle shook \nfor a moment as its fore cannons glowed and then&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; spewed out a massive \nburst of energy that bathed the fortress in pu=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; destructive \npower!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Back inside the Fortress th=\r\ne very base shook as it \nabsorbed the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; massive onslaught from the Au=\r\ntobot shuttle! The lights \nflickered as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; energy fields went down.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cyclonus, Scourge \nand Rodimus were knocked off their feet a=\r\nnd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scorponok was sent sailing \nback into the torture chamber as the=\r\n world&lt;BR&gt;&gt; inside the Fortress went \ncompletely dark for a moment and t=\r\nhen winked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; back on dimly as emergency \nlights came online.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An alert sounded, it would be only be less \nthan 30 seconds before=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fortress&#39; computer reset the system and \nbrought itself and al=\r\nl the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bases&#39; systems back on line!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nMeanwhile outs=\r\nide Lord Elder struggle frantically to redirect the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nshuttle&#39;s ener=\r\ngy from the weapons and back to the engines, as the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nshuttle at the=\r\n moment was falling from the skies, looking less like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \nelegant =\r\nflying machine it was and more like a brick!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (OOC: I \nwrot=\r\ne in the affected to the Fortress with Airly&#39;s permission)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n(TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Cyclonus &amp; \nScourge/Scorponok=\r\n/&lt;WBR&gt;Rodimus/Lord Elder)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_001B_01CAB9A1.263681A0--\r\n\n"}}
