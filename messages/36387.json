On the other hand, was Virgo really \nthat unstable?\n\n--- Lynxiz / Axis / Lokk ---\n\nLynxiz hurries to the Chivitron base, wounds dripping, and heads \nfor the CR. As she enters the CR room, the sight of Virgo firing on \nTrinity is too much. Her protective instincts kick in with a \nroundhouse. She doesn&#39;t think to tell anybody else, she just acts. \nHer claws immediately extend, and she leaps over Trinity at Virgo, \nslashing with her right claw at Virgo&#39;s weapon.\n\n-----------------\n\nLokk was about to help Windlord, but someone else had already \ngrabbed him. &quot;Well,&quot; he says as he looks about the battle field, \n&quot;Lets help Termitron, he seems to be in need of our assistance.&quot;\n\nAxis nods, &quot;Lets go Seekker.&quot; He heads towards Termitron. Lokk \nfollows him. (If Termitron is still outside, otherwise i&#39;ll repost)\n\n\n"}}
