I\n&gt; &gt; hope you&#39;re considering joining us.  Both of you.  Although it may\n&gt; be a bit\n&gt; &gt; dull for you Angel Prime.  We don&#39;t get many attacks way out here.\n&gt; And we\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t equipped to attack anyone.  But we could really use the \nhelp.\n&gt;  We need\n&gt; &gt; to get some shields on this base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt; &gt;     Still standing outside the base, &quot;Sirs I&#39;ve been thinking \nabout\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; problem.  I think I can develop a different type of shielding for\n&gt; the base.\n&gt; &gt; It wouldn&#39;t be the best but it might work.  First we&#39;d need \ntypical\n&gt; force\n&gt; &gt; type shielding for use against missiles, lasers, etceteras.  \nSecond\n&gt; a type of\n&gt; &gt; back up shielding.  It wouldn&#39;t affect incoming attacks but it \nwould\n&gt; affect\n&gt; &gt; the incoming attackers.  A typical shield system uses a bubble of\n&gt; force to\n&gt; &gt; stop attacks. But deflecting them takes energy and they can be\n&gt; brought down.\n&gt; &gt; I propose focusing energon in such a way that it creates a bubble \nof an\n&gt; &gt; energon field around the base.  This would prevent bots from \ngetting\n&gt; through.\n&gt; &gt;  Unfortunately the instability would mean we couldn&#39;t get out \nwhile\n&gt; they&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; up.  We would have to attack from well within the bubble to \nprevent\n&gt; stasis\n&gt; &gt; lock.  Our shots will still be able to pass through the shielding\n&gt; but theirs\n&gt; &gt; would not.  And the energon shields would last until the energon\n&gt; power source\n&gt; &gt; ran out.  It wouldn&#39;t last more than a day or two but that would \nbe\n&gt; enough to\n&gt; &gt; repair and get back to battle.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Next for weapon systems we&#39;ll need automated turrets.  \nMounted\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; mountain side and around the base.  I&#39;d also like a mine field \nbut that\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be necessary.  Maybe some more primitive traps, like the\n&gt; hole we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; one step to the right of, or the logs.  They&#39;re primitive but\n&gt; effective.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;The shielding I can modify and repair from spare parts in the\n&gt; base but I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think I can make turrets from anything in there.  I&#39;ll need \nat\n&gt; least\n&gt; &gt; one example and some spare parts to build more with.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;I think it&#39;s time we visit the Maximals again Windlord.  They\n&gt; owe us a\n&gt; &gt; favor or two.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
