He could tell thus far that this bot was \nfiercely loyal to the faction he was currently with. Darkangel&#39;s \nwords also told him that the once mighty rules, the Predacons, were \nnow little more than an old glory tale to be told. If he was to rule \nthis planet, he would have to work from the ground up. He smiled at \nDarkangel.  &quot;Really? The Predacons are no more? I find this \nintrigueing. Tell me then Darkangel, since the Predacons are no \nlonger the rulers and since the, uh,Tripredacus are in control, whom \nmight the leader be? You? For you are a bot I can serve with. If the \nother bots in this Tripredacus are anything like you, then I would \nbe honored to serve.&quot;  He bowed slightly to Darkangel and offered \nhis hand to shake as an agreement for his joining the \nTripredacus. &quot;Allow me to fight with you. For the Maximals and the \nlike are my sworn enemy.&quot;  He clutched his hands into fists and \nlowered his voice to a low growl,&quot;I will see them stamped out. This \nI have sworn.&quot;  He drew himself in for a second and regained his \nmore polite composure. &quot;Please, allow me to fight with you.&quot; he said \nextending his hand again.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; : : Darkangel : :\n&gt; The bat bot was both flattered and angered by DeathSteel&#39;s words. \nDid he thin him unloyal?\n&gt; Darkangel: Squander? I think not. I have no wish to join the \nPredacons..., a dieing faction of Transformers. I serve the \nTripredacus. If you were smart you would be with us. We rule \nCybertron, and will eventually win this war. Then we will be the \nrulers of all Transformers.\n\n\n\n"}}
