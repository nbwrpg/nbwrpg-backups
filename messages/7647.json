He was just thinking about going after the Alliance bot and silencing him with a punch to the temple as he saw him run back they way he had come, knowing that he might have a whole squad of Alliance bot�s down here in a nano-click.\nHe then resisted the urge to slag the little fool as he looked back towards Prowl and past him a bit, knowing that they might be able to get the two femms out of the base before Scattershot ever even reached a bot whom would believe him.\nHearing Prowl words, how some others were not as dumb as that one was believable..but not much.\nDinobot snarled as he saw Prowl begin to crawl down the vent, thinking of how this was even worse then traveling underground when he and Rattrap had to retrieve that anti-virus for Rhinox. At least he was able to walk upright, not crawl on his hands and knees like some pathetic warm-blood! With a rather uncomfortable feeling he then followed Prowl further down the vent shaft, hating every second of it.\nRight about this time he was beginning to get a little more annoyed with things, even more then usual. With having not slagged anybot yet and always creeping about he was ready to rip his claws through someone, the action being more natural to him then crawling about in a slaging vent shaft!\nDinobot snarled and tensed as Prowl stopped, actually nearly running into him but stopping just in time. He looked to where Prowl was staring into and noticed the light at the end of the shaft, an obvious opening�and entrance.\nWith a quick scan he registered two signatures and identified them, noting their positions.\nThere were four signatures in the room but only two were Alliance, the other Maximal. Obviously Tavatron and Iron Raptor. But the closest one was Tavatron, the table only a few feet away from the opening in the shaft, the slab of steel Iron Raptor was attached too at the far wall.\nHe quickly calculated a simple plan that had a very good possibility of working, deciding to voice it before Prowl got some other idea.\nDinobot nodded at Prowl�s words but then simply waited a few moment before finally saying what was on his mind.*\n\n� Dark One is the nearest, Nemesis Enforcer located beside Iron Raptor at the far perimeter. If Dark One is attacked first then Nemesis Enforcer will have sufficient time to alert the remainder of the base before the other of us would reach him. However, if the situation was reversed and Nemesis was attacked first then Dark One could be subdued and terminated before he could give alarm.�\n\n* The plan was pure and simple, take Nemesis out first because he was nearer to the alert console then Dark One was. As soon as Dark One saw that Nemesis was attacked by something unknown he would then head for the alert console but would then be attacked and terminated before he got there. But if Nemesis saw Dark One attacked they would be hearing sirens before the had time to think. Thus their mission in total ruin.\nDinobot just hoped that Prowl understood, if he didn�t then they would be�screwed.\nHe snarled and then looked at the opening in front of Prowl.*\n\n� Understand? You take Nemesis Enforcer and I shall take Dark One right after.�\n\n* Dinobot glared at the hole in the vent, ready to get out of this confined space and into an area that he could at least stretch out his arms at full length. All he needed was the sign from Prowl that they were exiting, eager to get this mission over and done with. To get Tavatron out of such a situation as fast as he possibly could.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
