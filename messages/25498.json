He was charred and covered with dirt, but internal repairs had \nmostly healed him. He had crashed earlier on the planet after \nfollowing Killfest through a transwarp portal.\n\n&quot;Where the slag am I?&quot; he asks himself, not remembering anything that \nhappened since the crash for a few seconds. He had landed and had \napprehended a Predacon ship, but an explosion had sent him into \nstasis lock.\n\nHe looks around. Unknown to him, he wasn&#39;t too far away from \nDestructor&#39;s cloaked base. Checking his scanners, he sees that a \nPredacon was on his way here.\n\n&quot;Well well well, some action...&quot; he says, arming a mean-looking rifle.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Still nervously clanking his claws Scorponok tries to calm \nhimself, &quot;The\n&gt; alliance?&quot; he says. Then after he&#39;s reained his composure he \nscreams.\n&gt; &quot;Scorponok, Terrorize&quot; with that the scorpion changes to robot \nmode. He\n&gt; puts his foot in the water then walks all the way in until he is \nsumberged\n&gt; and starts following his radar towards london Island.\n\n\n"}}
