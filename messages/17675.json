Flicking \nher tail behind her and purring slightly.  She looked at HotRod who \nwas still on the table. She then looked back at Unitron.Seeing his \ndiscontent and knowing how he was feeling. &quot;I know what your \nthinking, you&#39;d rather be out there slagging a few maximals in battle \nother than staying her working on the mundane. I know that feeling. \nThis is so boring.&quot; She walked back to her console. &quot;I still got a \nfew hours left on mine, yours will take longer. Got any cards?&quot; She \nsmiled almost innocently at him. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Unitron:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Alliance member sighed as the computer gave him \norders.  &quot;Stupid \n&gt; assignment...&quot; he complained to himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unitron picked up Vulois, putting him over his shoulder.  Walking \nover to the \n&gt; table, he set the unconscious robot down on the table, strapping \nhis arms, \n&gt; legs, and neck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Walking over to the computer near Vulois&#39; head, he hooked up him up \nto the \n&gt; console.  Typing away quickly, he started the program 2345a, and \ntook a few \n&gt; steps back, crossing his arms.\n\n\n"}}
