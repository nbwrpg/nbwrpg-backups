If you care to read again, so does Dinobot.\n\n-Prowl was a flyer and, thus, would reach the Alliance base before him if they were to leave the Maximals ship at the same time, then being forced to wait for his arrival. A process that was not acceptable, ever second counted.\nSo of Dinobot was to break off from his course and diverted towards the Alliance base he should arrive just as Prowl did, thus no time was wasted at all.\nThe distance was great and his land for could not go as fast as a flyer, they simply flew over the trees and forests he had to pick his way through.\nWith his mind then decided Dinobot then broke off from his dead run and arche towards the Alliance base as an even faster pace, not having any time to explain in the hope that Prowl would simply understand.-\n\nAs you may be able to tell, Dinobot is simply on his way towards the Alliance base so that he would be there when Prowl GOT THERE and not waste time for the owl-Maximals to wait for him.\nSimple enough answer to straighten things out.\nAny ferther questions, Yanshosh, please feel free to mail me. I shall be pleased to give reliefe to any furture concerns.)\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
