She stood up, stretched her long \nleathery wings and yawned. &quot;Oh man, a fruit bat can&#39;t sleep that \nlong.&quot;  she said flexing her wings, &quot;It puts kinks in my wings. Oh, \ngee,&quot;yawns,&quot;how long have I been napping. Hmm, I wonder.&quot;  she walked \naround the cave for something to eat, but found nothing.  She did a \nsmall test flight around the cave.  She was alittle rusty, but she&#39;d \niron out the kinks as she kept it up.  She flew around the ceiling of \nthe cave for hours, doing aerial manouvers and practicing her \nfighting moves.  She smiled and landed on the cave floor. &quot;Yeah, I \nstill got it. I could take on a flier and win, peice of energon pie. \nNo sweat. Battera, you still got what it takes.&quot; she said in a \ncheerful voice.  She wanted to go outside the cave and get something \nto eat.  She stood at the cave entrance and use her sonar to see what \nwas around.  Other than a few trees with overly ripe fruit, nothing \nwas close to the cave. She&#39;d have to go out for a few miles to see \nwhat was out there.  She decided to wait a bit.  After all, she \nwanted to make sure she could handle anything that she might \nencounter while out flying around.  She went back inside the cave and \npracticed some more.  \n\n\n"}}
