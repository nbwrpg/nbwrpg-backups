One of them is an \nowl, and the other is a lion that is part of Magnaboss. This Prowl is the \nowl, but he has a fairly strange history, probably different from the toy&#39;s, \nand I&#39;d doupt he and Bluestreak could possible be brothers, but IM me if you \nhave any comments.\n\n::Prowl/Striker::\n\nProwl looks at Iron Raptor, as she places her hand on his arm. &quot;Actually I \nhave no idea what I&#39;m doing. You&#39;re third in command, I was hoping you&#39;d take \nover from here,&quot; he says, feeling slightly stupid. He turns to Rhinox, not \nhearing the sleepy murmurings from Cyber Claw.\n\n&quot;I have read about you in data logs back on Cybertron. There are plenty of us \nhere, but they havn&#39;t got here yet.&quot;\n\nAt that point, Striker walks into the room, nearly crashing into Cyber Claw \nin the proccess. He looks at her, surprised. &quot;Welcome, I don&#39;t believe we \nmet.&quot;\n\n"}}
