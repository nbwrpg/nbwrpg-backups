If they were to fight then she wanted nothing to do with it, besides the fact that seeing such bots battle just because they were different seemed stupid to her.*\n\n____________________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor peered through the bushes beside Prowl, she twitched her tail in thought of his question to join in on the battle.\nShe decided that since there was no reason to join she wouldn&#39;t, it would only result in wounds that could have been prevented.\nBesides, it was a battle between the Alliance and this new ship, since it seemed to belong to no Maximal force what was the reason to intervene.\nIf it was an Predacon or enemy ship then why bother, perhaps they would cancle each other out?\nIron Raptor would have shaken her head but it would have rustled the bushes and given away their position, she gave Prowl a look the said it all. But that same look also said that he could jump in if he wanted to, it was his spark...afterall. But the records would then show that she advised against such an action, fighting just to fight could get an unwise bot killed!*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
