If his last fluid pump\n&gt; expired\n&gt; then he\n&gt; &gt; would die, slow and painful.\n&gt; &gt; That was the very thing that worried him, more then anything at the\n&gt; moment.\n&gt; &gt; But then, something out of nowhere came into view on his right\n&gt; side,\n&gt; &gt; something that hadn&#39;t come into focus yet.and touched him!\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot quickly stood up and snapped his entire body around, the\n&gt; force of\n&gt; &gt; the action sending droplets of his own mech-fluid to splatter\n&gt; against\n&gt; &gt; Necromancers side.\n&gt; &gt; It took his optic a moment to adjust; however, once it did he found\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt; reason to be alarmed.\n&gt; &gt; It was that smaller bot whom he had told to help Tavatron, one in\n&gt; which he\n&gt; &gt; knew not the name of.\n&gt; &gt; He straightened himself up the best he could, taking in\n&gt; consideration about\n&gt; &gt; just how damaged he was and the only thing he could manage was a\n&gt; shoulder\n&gt; &gt; slumped stance.\n&gt; &gt; This was all getting far too much for him, the surprise from this\n&gt; bot only\n&gt; &gt; feeding his rage and speeding up his damaged systems.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot glared at the small bot for a moment before relaxing his\n&gt; stance a\n&gt; &gt; bit.mainly for need of relaxing the muscles in his back and\n&gt; preventing them\n&gt; &gt; from getting a charley horse.\n&gt; &gt; He listened to his words.and for once in his life had to agree\n&gt; with\n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot needed help and he knew it.and would be a fool to swipe\n&gt; it\n&gt; aside\n&gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; But then as he was about to accept Foxfingers&#39; assistance he\n&gt; heard\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; familiar voice, one in which was belonging to a particular femm in\n&gt; which was\n&gt; &gt; pissing him right off at the moment.\n&gt; &gt; The tone of her defying voice causing his head to snap in her\n&gt; direction,\n&gt; &gt; teeth bared and muscles strained.\n&gt; &gt; He wouldn&#39;t care to say so, but at this very moment he hated\n&gt; her.\n&gt; absolutely\n&gt; &gt; hated her. The sound of her voice, the feel of her aggression in\n&gt; the air,\n&gt; &gt; even the sight of her completely pushed his aggression further and\n&gt; further\n&gt; &gt; to complete and utter rage!\n&gt; &gt; To this point he had controlled himself the best he could, and\n&gt; tried his\n&gt; &gt; damnedest to keep his temper to at least a rate where he could\n&gt; control\n&gt; &gt; it.even barely.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot&#39;s tail thrashed as he listened to her words, his\n&gt; control\n&gt; nearly\n&gt; &gt; breaking and unleashing the side of him in which he hadn&#39;t used\n&gt; in\n&gt; all his\n&gt; &gt; years in fear of never gaining sanity back.\n&gt; &gt; He was known for berserk fighting.which bordered at\n&gt; insanity.and if\n&gt; he had\n&gt; &gt; to use that style of combat now.so help the poor souls in his\n&gt; way.\n&gt; &gt; But instead of expressing the rage in which racked at his very\n&gt; being, a\n&gt; &gt; sudden hush came over him as he straightened himself completely\n&gt; out. His\n&gt; &gt; shoulder-plates no longer slumped and his tail swaying calmly\n&gt; behind him.\n&gt; &gt; He had indeed collected himself, so to the point that he was\n&gt; utterly beyond\n&gt; &gt; anger now.and that was death to anyone who, so much, as looked\n&gt; at\n&gt; him wrong.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot glared at Tavatron, but now his aggression was beyond\n&gt; expression.and\n&gt; &gt; he simply looked at her coldly. The rage completely disappearing\n&gt; from his\n&gt; &gt; features, though his muscles remained tense.\n&gt; &gt; This was it, completely IT!!!\n&gt; &gt; He had had enough of her and her back talk, and was utterly sick of\n&gt; her and\n&gt; &gt; her jabbering tone.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Of COURSE it would make a difference! I, for one, would NEVER\n&gt; have let you\n&gt; &gt; engage in battle in the first place! Not after what it took me to\n&gt; get you\n&gt; &gt; back!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * His mind was just as red hot as his temper, and if he didn&#39;t\n&gt; watch himself\n&gt; &gt; he would end up saying something.or even doing something that\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; eventually tip one of them off the edge.\n&gt; &gt; But, he wasn&#39;t really thinking at the moment either, rather\n&gt; more\n&gt; acting then\n&gt; &gt; anything else.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; And existing as a Transmetal 2 has NOTHING to do with whether\n&gt; or\n&gt; not you\n&gt; &gt; would have been captured. It was complete STUPIDITY, which had the\n&gt; result of\n&gt; &gt; your fate.\n&gt; &gt; You KNEW better then to simply go alone, yet you ignored your logic\n&gt; and left\n&gt; &gt; alone anyway!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * His clawed hands were in fists, but not a single vision of his\n&gt; rage had\n&gt; &gt; escaped.other then the occasional raising of his voice.\n&gt; &gt; But it was also then that Dinobot saw Tavatrons temper slightly\n&gt; become more\n&gt; &gt; controllable, watching her every move as she approached him.\n&gt; &gt; He say the collected anger in her optics, but even as she was now\n&gt; in control\n&gt; &gt; of HER anger, he knew that it was about time that he became the\n&gt; master of\n&gt; &gt; his own.\n&gt; &gt; But, that would not be easy.\n&gt; &gt; He watched as Tavatron walked up to Necromancer, agreeing that it\n&gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; far better to ride back then walk, despite his anger it was also a\n&gt; slight\n&gt; &gt; relief to have her within sight and without such a high degree of\n&gt; risk if\n&gt; &gt; being attacked if she would have walked.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot turned his head towards the smaller bot by his side,\n&gt; Foxfinger.\n&gt; &gt; Wondering vaguely if he was coming along with them.\n&gt; &gt; His anger, strangely enough, was beginning to die down. Basically\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; point where he simply didn&#39;t feel.anything.\n&gt; &gt; And the reason for that, though not apparent to him now, was that\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; systems were shutting down and effecting his mental, neural\n&gt; capacity\n&gt; &gt; circuits. Whish meant, soon he wouldn&#39;t feel anything, be able\n&gt; to\n&gt; touch\n&gt; &gt; anything, be able to do anything.\n&gt; &gt; For, his fourth fluid pump had already began to deactivated, there\n&gt; was just\n&gt; &gt; no extreme pain to announce it.\n&gt; &gt; The mech-fluid flow which went to his brain to supply it with\n&gt; oxygen was\n&gt; &gt; beginning to slow down, and if he wasn&#39;t careful and wastes his\n&gt; time to get\n&gt; &gt; back to base, he would basically be brain dead.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot growled, the anger spiking up once again, but nothing as\n&gt; serious as\n&gt; &gt; before, more dampened and calm.\n&gt; &gt; However, his expression didn&#39;t change, emotionless, cold, and\n&gt; aggressive.\n&gt; &gt; He looked up at the large dragon now, seeing Tavatron comfortably\n&gt; resting on\n&gt; &gt; his back, then looked back down at Foxfinger, gesturing towards\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; If you are coming with us, then get on.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * His voice was harsh and wet, mech-fluid already coating the\n&gt; inside of his\n&gt; &gt; mouth and lips.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot didn&#39;t wait for an answer though, there wasn&#39;t\n&gt; enough time,\n&gt; for, he\n&gt; &gt; had to get back to base and into a CR chamber quickly.\n&gt; &gt; His own repair system was offline, and it had been since he had\n&gt; first been\n&gt; &gt; hit in the side by one of the Alliance missiles.\n&gt; &gt; He quickly, or as quickly as he could, climbed up and onto the back\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Necromancer, careful to make sure that he sat a good 10 feet down\n&gt; his back\n&gt; &gt; and away from Tavatron. He didn&#39;t need any of her back talk now.\n&gt; &gt; Around this time his breaths were coming short, and Dinobot had to\n&gt; force\n&gt; &gt; himself to let go of what anger he had in order to concentrate on\n&gt; breathing.\n&gt; &gt; He quickly transformed into beast mode once he was on the back of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; dragon, thinking that maybe there was a chance to slow down the\n&gt; lose of\n&gt; &gt; mech-fluid with only that once chest wound.\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot looked at the perimeter of Necromancer&#39;s back and then\n&gt; got\n&gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; comfortable position, laying on his stomach with his head resting\n&gt; on his\n&gt; &gt; front limbs.staring at Tavatron&#39;s back.\n&gt; &gt; If anything, he was about ready to depart. *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; &gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
