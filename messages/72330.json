Rattrap l=\r\nooks to her with the exact expression on his own face.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This ain&#39;t =\r\ngonna be a walk in the park.  Whoever&#39;s out there really knows what they&#39;re=\r\n do&#39;n.  Like some sorta master tactician, with a dangerously high level of =\r\nintelligence.  And at the same time they&#39;re strong enough ta even topple th=\r\ne big guns on both sides. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot paces back and forth a few t=\r\nimes.  She had once done some research with Tucson while visiting an archiv=\r\ne center on Cybertron.  It now began to seem slightly familiar to something=\r\n she might have read.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hey, now that ya mention that Rattrap, Tucso=\r\nn and I were just passing time one day at an old archive center on Cybertro=\r\nn and he found something on tactical dictators of the past, simply by chanc=\r\ne.  One particular article told a story about a certain dictator who was fa=\r\nr more ruthless than any Decepticon/ Predacon leader combined.  It was rumo=\r\nred that he may have had connections to Unicron himself.  But these are rum=\r\nors and I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re true.  Fact is, the patterns of carnage, ab=\r\nduction and confusion that we&#39;re all experiencing now, it matches with what=\r\n happened when that article was released.  Only problem is, there was never=\r\n a name mentioned.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstride scratches behind his neck in bewilderm=\r\nent.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Um so why can&#39;t we find anyone who went AWOL?  How the heck did=\r\n they just fall off the edge of the planet?  That all part of it too?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Straight Shot shrugs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m just as confused as you are but it could =\r\nbe.&quot; I wish we had a way to scan for alien energy signatures, I bet my butt=\r\n quills that&#39;s part of the answer we all happen ta be looking for.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pe=\r\nrpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sep 28, 2011, at 12:20 =\r\nPM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The shuttle finally la=\r\nnded inside the Ark landing bay, the is a slight\n&gt; &gt; jostling at the last m=\r\noment as the shuttle actually touched down, but\n&gt; &gt; not enough to cause any=\r\n undue discomfort.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Alright!&quot; POLAR CLAW said from the front seat.=\r\n &quot;Let&#39;s unload and get\n&gt; &gt; the wounded to the medbay!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; POLAR CLAW&#39;=\r\ns voice was all authority and command as he stepped out of\n&gt; &gt; the cockpit =\r\narea and into the section where NIGHTSHIFT and the rest\n&gt; &gt; were seated, an=\r\nd it was immediately obvious that POLAR CLAW himself\n&gt; &gt; was in need of med=\r\nical care or a CR chamber or both.
