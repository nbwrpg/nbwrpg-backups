To the\n&gt; comm=\r\nand center!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The team ran toward the command center, still moving strat=\r\negically,\n&gt; each member watching a side of the team.\n\n\nIt&#39;s a rather short =\r\nrun to the command center. Along the way the team\ncan see more of the scorc=\r\nhed and burned walls, some of the structure\nof it has been ripped away from=\r\n support struts, metal twisted and\nstrewn everywhere. However this damage, =\r\nunlike the damage found near\nthe front door appears to old, as rust has set=\r\n into exposed metal\nsurfaces. \n\nAs the group arrives in the command center,=\r\n bodies of full sized\nAutobots and Decepticons are littering the floor: Opt=\r\nimus Prime,\nMegatron, Soundwave, Prowl and Jazz, all of them still possessi=\r\nng\ntheir Cybertronian modes. \n\nFrom under one of the control panels Lord El=\r\nder&#39;s legs stick out at an\nodd angle. &quot;That&#39;s got it.&quot; Lord Elder says, his=\r\n voice muffled, yet\nsatisfied as the alarms shut off. \n\nClimbing out from t=\r\nhe panel Lord Elder looked almost surprised to see\nSalveo&#39;s team, or perhap=\r\ns it was their battle ready posture. &quot;OH!&quot; he\nexclaimed as he activated the=\r\n main view screen. &quot;You thought there was\nsome sort of a battle.&quot; \n\nOn the =\r\nview screen what appears to be a black and crimson weapons\nsatellite is flo=\r\nating high in the air, overlooking the debris of\nsweeps that are all over t=\r\nhe ground. \n\nLord Elder pointed at the screen, &quot;That&#39;s just . . . ummm . . =\r\n.\nLegacy. We just met him recently. He&#39;s beginning to take care of the\nrefu=\r\nse out there.&quot; The walls rock again as a blast erupts from the one\nLord Eld=\r\ner indicated as Legacy and strikes the ground, disintegrating\nseveral sweep=\r\ns at once.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
