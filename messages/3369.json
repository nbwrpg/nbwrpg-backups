It was real faint and barely audiable.  But her \nkeen mouse hearing could just pick it up. It was a faint whistle coming from \nup above her. She looked up.  She saw two disks coming at her.*\n\n&quot;Holy Cybertron!&quot;\n\n*She jumped to the left and avoided the first disk but didn&#39;t gage the \nsecond in time and got her left shoulder sliced wide open.*\n\n&quot;AHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;\n\n*The gaping wound in her shoulder, leaking mech fluid.  She slowly \nTransformed into her Mouse mode and walked to Suukie.*\n\n&quot;Can we get out of here before we both get killed?&quot;\n\n----Original Message---------\n&gt;From: KSLawdogg@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2000 21:41:29 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector/Manterror/Ramhorn:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ramhorn came over a hill, sub-machine gun raised.  Seeing Striker, then \n&gt;Dark\n&gt;Mouse, then two Predacons.  As well as Suukie.  Raising his gun, he felt a\n&gt;tap on his shoulder.  Turning, a swift punch sent him crashing to the \n&gt;ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Manterror laughed as Injector knocked Ramhorn down.  Raising his weapons, \n&gt;he\n&gt;fired two ion disks at Dark Mouse from one arm, two others at Striker from\n&gt;the other.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Injector punched Ramhorn twice in the face.  Then the Maximal scientist got\n&gt;his feet up against the Predacon&#39;s chest.  Pushing forward hard with his\n&gt;legs, Injector went flying back, crashing into the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
