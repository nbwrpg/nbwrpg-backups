His ridged metal feet \ncaught him from slipping or loosing his balance, but what hit him \nthrew him to the ground on his back. He wanted to get immediately up \nand continue the fight, but something was wrong. There was a terrible \npain at his head that restricted him from functioning right. He \nslumped down on the floor, struggling to get up.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He jumps out of the way of the blast.\n&gt; &quot;What the &#@$%!
