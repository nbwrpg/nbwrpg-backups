But her third-in-command position almost gave her no authority at all, seemingly nothing more then a field soldier with a fancy name.\nShe halted as they both came up to her and was extremely surprised to hear them request for orders, wasn&#39;t that Liono&#39;s job...to give the orders. She looked around puzzled for a moment before looking back towards the two Maximals, not really sure what to do.*\n\n&quot; Request orders? Isn&#39;t Liono around?&quot;\n\n* But a quick scan revieled that he was not, she just shrugged and kept her arm around Prowl for support.*\n\n&quot; Well, the base is pretty slaged. Rally all of the non-damaged bot&#39;s together and split them up into two groups. The majority will help the base repair system reconstruct the ship and the other...&quot;\n\n* Her own damage was slowing her down, the bleeding and sore side that just happened to be right against Prowl. She sighed.*\n\n&quot; The other will be a sub-defence system, armed with some of the most powerful weapons we have in the Weapon&#39;s Hold.They&#39;ll be defending the ship along with the repair bot&#39;s as they work. As more bot&#39;s finish repair from the CR chambers, more will either join the repair team or the defence team until the ship is fully functional. We&#39;re just too weak right now, another attack may destroy the ship along with us inside it. Any attacks will be met within reason but with force.&quot;\n\n* She then began to move off towards the CR chambers and hoped that those orders were good enough, her own puzzlement still in her mind.*\n\n&quot; Until further orders are give...those are mine.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
