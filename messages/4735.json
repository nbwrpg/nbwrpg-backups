Why not? It wasn�t, as if he could do much with it, and he did not say what sort of computer, did he? That thought made her think harder about the situation, just a simple computer.\nIron Raptor looked at Striker, he seemed to have his own clue as to what he�d do in this situation�but she was in command at the moment and SHE had to do something�not him.\nHer expression towards him was calm and without faulter, she knew what she was going to do. *\n\n� Of course. We wouldn�t want one of our Maximals dead, would we? Then the Predacons would be one more step on the line of outnumbering us�again.�\n\n* Her reaction was cold but it was only meant as something to lighten up the atmosphere, the fact that it was simply a pun then evident on her face the next moment.\nIron Raptor then stood up from the chair and walked over to the control console again, simply standing there and looking at the blank screen for a few moments. Then suddenly she moved. *\n\n� Iris!? Design a blank computer, hand held and portable.�\n\n* The command was stern and without humor this time, the fact that a bots life was in danger now more serious that she had suddenly received Bronco�s second transmission on her internal receiver.\nThe image on the screen then changed from blank to a diagram of a portable comp, the design simple and without fault.\nIron Raptor smiled as she then crossed her arms and closed her optics; this was going somewhat good so far.\nShe then opened her com-link to Bronco, her voice stern and harsh�on the verge of a growl, the smile disappearing from her face. *\n\n� Bronco! I have a little thought for you to dwell on while you�re waiting: Waiting patiently gets you a computer, no ties and no strings attached. Killing a bot just means that there will be nothing in the way to stop me from ripping your throat out!. What would you pick? �\n\n* She then deactivated her com-link and the opened her optics, it was simple. If he killed Octiciz then there was nothing in the way from stopping her from killing him, it he waited for the comp he asked for then she would simply give it to him and leave with Octociz. It was very simple.\nIron Raptor the looked at the screen, the programming in which she had silently commanded Iris to include programmed into it by now, a small chuckle escaping her throat. The programming was very simple as well, it simply made the computer so that it couldn�t locate Maximal signatures nor do anything relating to Maximals, the Predacons and Alliance on the other hand was easy for it to lock into.\nIron Raptor nodded and the turned to a replicate beside the console, the silent command for Iris to replicate the model exactically already given.\nWith in moments the computer stood in perfect condition on the replicate in front of the female reptile, she then taking it in her hands and placing it in a hold in her leg.\nIron Raptor looked up at Striker, a satisfied look on her face as she then walked past him and towards the exit to the Ark.*\n\n� If you don�t mind I�d like to put Prowl in charge of the base while I�m gone, his expertise in strategy and attitude could benefit the Maximals until I return. But I�d need you to tell him, I have no saw when it comes to your troops.�\n\n* She then opened her com-link to Bronco but didn�t speak into it. A coded message simply said that she was now on her way. Iron Raptor then opened her link to Tavatron; it would be nice to have a little extra back up just in case something went wrong. *\n\n� Tavatron! I need you to follow me to grid 6-1-7. But Keep a good distance behind and stay out of sight. You�re my back up along with Striker�just in case something goes wrong. Bring Dinobot if you like, the more back up the better.�\n\n* Iron Raptor then came to the doors of the Ark, the thought of how useless and dead this ship was crossing her mind. It would be so nice just to leave it all behind and live in a REAL battle ship, not some Autobot carrier. They needed heavy artillery, not simple defenses.\nBut now was hardly the time to worry about such things, now was the time to worry about a bot�s life!\nShe opened the doors and then stepped out, looking at the distant clouds she took in a deep breath and then converted into Beast Mode. She waited for her back up team to assemble before she would head out, the life of a bot hanging in the balance. *\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
