Vladimir \nunderstood it perfectly as he glared back at him with a freezing \nstare, the scar on his left cheek accentuating the moment.\n\nVlad: As you wish, Rogue. Just know that I am not made of Tripredacus \nstuff. (He turns to the ladybot) Since they are gone, I think it is \ntime to suggest something to you. I am a leader without warriors here \nand you seem strong enough. I would like you to join me. In turn, we \ncould join the Tripredacus here, but you would remain my warrior. What \nsay you?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Sorry.

And those who anger us pay \n&gt; dearly for it, as these misbegotten fools have no doubt learned from \n&gt; the death of their friend.&quot;  (&#39;misbegotten fools&#39; referring to the \n&gt; tripreds, and &#39;friend&#39; meaning the late Burrock.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Rogue leader looks over his shoulder at Torin and Riekan.
