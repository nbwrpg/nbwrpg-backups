She \nhisses at Starlight, and unsheathes her whip/scythe, charging \nstraight for the bot and making a move to slash it across the chest.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Hmm...

He frowns, activating his comm.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Starlight, Fenox, Griplash, Recklessa, Demolition, forget about \n&gt; whatever you were looking for.&quot; Zardus orders them over the \n&gt; comm, &quot;Report to Dark Angel&#39;s position, he needs backup against \n&gt; Maximal troops.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He then opens his comm to Deemos. &quot;Deemos, some Alliance troops \nneed \n&gt; backup at the newly arrived pod. Can you send some of your troops?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks at his wrist comp, noting that Repressor and Najah \nwere \n&gt; in the training rooms. Gotron was talking to Lady Hawk, but thatw \nas \n&gt; ok. He could keep an eye on her. But there was always a later time \n&gt; for training, battle was urgent.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Repressor, Najah, report to Dark Angel&#39;s position. Attack any \n&gt; Maximal troops there,&quot; he says into his comm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fenox and groop recieve Zardus&#39; transmission, turning to head \ntoward \n&gt; the battle. They wern&#39;t very far away as it is, they could even see \n&gt; the battle on their scopes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recklessa arrives first, yelling a battle cry as she swoops down \n&gt; toward the battle, firing two missiles at Windlord and a few optic \n&gt; shots at Aerotaur. Fenox and Starlight arrive behind her. Fenox \nopens \n&gt; fire with an automatic rifle at Angel Prime and Starlight fires \n&gt; stinger missiles along with a tranqualizer gun at Teltoli. Griplash \n&gt; gets there last, throwing down a charge (set to detonate on impact) \n&gt; at Teltoli&#39;s pod.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That femm is Alliance property!&quot; Fenox yells while firing. A shot \n&gt; barely misses Fenox&#39;s head as Rex flies in, firing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No, she&#39;s a Maximal,&quot; he replies, dodging a shot from Recklessa.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Perndabot looks ahead, seeing a battle and recognizing some of the \n&gt; energy signatures as Alliance. Finally!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There&#39;s a battle up ahead, let&#39;s go!&quot; He says to BrightBlade (Moon \n&gt; Mist, I know you&#39;re reading this, so you better reply). He takes \noff \n&gt; at a run toward the battle, a missile launcher flipping into his \nhand.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Repressor sighs as he recieves Zardus&#39; message, his hand jerking \naway \n&gt; when Najah bites him. &quot;We&#39;re needed at battle,&quot; he says to the bot \nhe \n&gt; had been training with as he wriggles out of Najah&#39;s grasp, &quot;Let&#39;s \n&gt; go!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He runs out of the training room, heading for the exit of the Iron \n&gt; Fist.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster looks at Whistler and nods. &quot;Go ahead and help them out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (OOC: Eek, sorry bout the mode, I&#39;m in the middle of another RPG \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; we&#39;re allowed to do that, just not fully.. sorry again!

She flaps the \n&gt; &gt; wings on her back, preparing to fly up, but Aerotaur succeeds in \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; flying leap, and knocks her to the side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She hisses when they both land in the dust, opposite of Windlord, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; Aerotaur is lying on top of her chest. He quickly rolls off and \nshe \n&gt; &gt; jumps up, ready to attack again when she feels two hands grip her \n&gt; &gt; shoulders and keep her back. Aerotaur again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Bot sighs and slumps her shoulders, but obeys the unspoken \n&gt; order \n&gt; &gt; to keep back, she knows she should stay back anyway. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come on Windlord, kick his tush!&quot; She grins.\n\n\n"}}
