He knew the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attempt could endanger his life as we=\r\nll, but by Primus he had to try. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He sounds his horn thre=\r\ne more times, hoping that Rodimus would hear &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tuscon is quickly able to reach the wall of debris that=\r\n stood between&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; him and Rodimus.

The smell of sulfur was in t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; air, obviously coming from the other side of the slide.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile . . .&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: CYCLONUS, Hydras&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Location: Black Fo=\r\nrtress - Throne Room&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The door to the throne room =\r\nwas flung open, and there standing in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; doorway was the dirt=\r\ny and dented form of Cyclonus.
