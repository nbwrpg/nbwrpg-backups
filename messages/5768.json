I&#39;m back! \nKSLawdogg told what is happening and I think i am glad i had the break.\nI will now be reclaiming my characters once I find out where they currently \nare. That includes the characters that i did not issue that JP3884 controlled.\nJP3884, throughout this rpg you have been one of the strongest rule \nenforcers. One of the rules is you can&#39;t control anyone else&#39;s characters \nunless they say you can. The reason I didnot give out Inferno and company is \nbecause nothing really big was happening with them. Next I go and don&#39;t issue \nout characters please do not take them for yourself even if you desperately \nwant them. \n\nNext time I won&#39;t be this nice.........\n\n"}}
