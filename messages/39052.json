It become painfully \nobvious that they are going to crash but the ship should stay \nintact. Pacifix sends a commlink to the crew and passengers:\n\n&quot;This is Commander Pacifix. Autobots, a crash is immenent, brace \nfor impact, this could be rough. ETA of crash is approximately 23 \nseconds and counting.&quot;\n\nPacifix cuts of fhis comm and takes a seat beside JetV, in his \ncommander chair. He straps himself in, noting that all other \nAutobots had done the same. (I&#39;m saying that because I&#39;m not \nwaiting for people with Autobots to respond to this email.) Pacifix \nremains calm and mostly impassive, and axious look catches him \nfor a second, but he shrugs it off, and waits for impact.\n\nHe closes his eyes as his console beeps, and spouts current ETA \nto crash, &#39;12 seconds to impact.&#39; Without opening his eyes, he \ngrabs his support handles, and braces himself. JetV doing likewise.\n\nJetV guides the Hidden One down towards the largish island in \ncentral Indonesia. The ship smashes into the the start of a small \nvalley, just to the left of some massive mountains. The loud \nscreeching sounds scare much of the surrounding Wildlife from \nwhatever they were doing, and forces them into hiding. Birds can \nbe seen flocking away from the crash site. The ship slides along \nthe valley, turning sideways somewhat, and starts to catch dirt. \nSoon the ship has slowed down drasticly, having picked up several \ntons of dirt, trees, rocks, and various other objects onto the top and \naround it.\n\nAfter coming to a complete stop, the ship now appears to be a \nlarge hill consisting of dirt, trees and rocks (obviously =P). Pacifix \nruns a system diagnostic on the ship. He discovers that the major \nthrusters have been disabled, and are now covered with debri from \nthe crash. The computers chipset and motherboard are intact, and \nfunctioning perfectly. The ship&#39;s medium armour is damaged \nmoderately, but that can be repaired. The landers have been \ndestroyed, but Pacifix finds that understandable. He stops \nchecking the systems, guessing with fair accuracy the rest of what \nthe computer would have said. Pacifix stops when he feels a slight \ntug at his Autobot sensor. It seems to have picked up another \nAutobot signa-- no wait, there were two, no three signals... Pacifix \nfrowns, dismissing it as a Decepticon trick for the time being, but \nthe though rests at the back of his mind to be accessed at a later \ndate.\n\nJetV gets out of his chair, just before Pacifix detatches himself, \nand stands. Pacifix heads for the exit of the control room, JetV \nfollowing. &quot;That was a weird occurance. I hope we don&#39;t have go \nthrough that again.&quot; Pacifix keeps walking, nodding for JetV to \nfollow, &quot;Now the hard part begins...&quot; He heads down the hall \ntowards the storage bay. He opens a commlink to all Autobots, \n&quot;Autobots, there is a meeting in the storage bay to start soon, get \nthere ASAP. Pacifix out.&quot;\n\nPacifix and JetV enter the storage bay. JetV heads over and sits \ndown on a crate. Pacifix sets up a small box for him to talk on so \nthat all will be able to hear him, and he waits...\n\nooc: Thanks Jordan. =)\n\n"}}
