The point\nwas I&#39;ve already accepted losing an arm and almost\nloosing a leg. You haven&#39;t accepted squat and you need\nto accept something. Now can we get on with the battle\nand do it in a FAIR way this time.\n\n--- Legendarynemasis@... wrote:\n&gt; OOC: How is he going to dodge that? Well.... its a\n&gt; secret and as far as you \n&gt; bringing in hugar I dont remember him ever saying he\n&gt; was your lap dog and \n&gt; would do everything you say. He reads the post he\n&gt; knows whats going on, if he \n&gt; finds a problem with it or nother council member\n&gt; finds something so wrong \n&gt; they will bring it up and say to possibly to change\n&gt; it. Also demanding a \n&gt; person to take damage doesn&#39;t really look good for\n&gt; you and claiming that they \n&gt; will be moderated because you want them to be also\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make you look \n&gt; good. And as for a mutate making a barrier when he\n&gt; got scared that caused \n&gt; damage, that never happened, when he got sacred he\n&gt; channeled energy in its \n&gt; mouth and fired it at at a bot. And what type of\n&gt; radiation is it? Nuclear? \n&gt; Energon? If its nuclear then I believe thats illegal\n&gt; am I correct Rauq?\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind a job, post your resume.\nhttp://careers.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
