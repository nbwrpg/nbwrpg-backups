How she hated the word as it came out of his mouth, never knowing how evil the word could be until he spoke it. But what she hated most was the feel of him pushing her to the wall, just baring her teeth towards him as he did so. But the moment he left her completely she was just getting ready to lung at him, but then she found herself restrained by energon beams.\nWith a shocked but then angry face she then pulled at the restraint, having the faint hope of freedom now that she was out of the clutches of Dark One.\nShe then glared at Dark One with he teeth bared and her shoulder�s square, just ready to rip his throat out but then she simply looked away. Ignoring him.\nBut when Nemesis Enforcer entered into the room she then glared at him and his smile when he saw Tavatron strapped to the table, then ready to rip HIM apart.\nShe growled low but then her growl was cut short when she heard the name of his new device, something to do with pain and�bugs? The thought of such a device completely creeped her out, some sort of device the creeped along under the armor. Pain indeed!\nIron Raptor then strained against the bars again, looking at Tavatron but with the same determined look on her face. *\n\n� Tavatron! Tavatron�listen. Don�t scream. Whatever you do don�t scream. Don�t give then the satisfaction!�\n\n* She then snapped her optics towards Nemesis Enforcer and Dark One with a look that would have made Hell Beast think twice. *\n\n� YOU will BOTH be the one�s screaming if you hurt her! I promise you!!�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
