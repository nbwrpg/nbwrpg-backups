Going thorugh corridors, he entered the bridge.  He \ncould see a lot of scorch marks (from Smokescreen and Set&#39;s fight).  Walking \nover to a control pad, he powered down the autoguns and unlocked the doors, \nopening them wide.  Taking out a laser pistol, he fired three bolts into the \ncontrols.  Running to the door, he took out two grenades, set to explode on \nimpact.  Tossing them at the controls he ran, the door shutting, Unitron \nheaded for the outside, hearing a boom and a screach as the door he had been \nnear began to give from the explosions.\n\n"}}
