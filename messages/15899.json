The trainers \ncame \n&gt; and attacked us while you were gone.  They took Striker and Spears \n&gt; with them. Striker was damaged and unconsious.  Spears was turned \n&gt; into a slave by some chip.&quot;  She looked at the others who steppped \n&gt; off the shuttle.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have to tell you like this, but we \n&gt; need to plan to get them back some how.&quot;  She winced at her \nshoulder, \n&gt; still dripping fluid.

He glanced at \n&gt; &gt; Spears, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering who she could have named. She hadn&#39;t been on the \nplanet \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; too long, so she probably didn&#39;t know who was the Maximal \nleader, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was sure he had met at least a few high officials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing was for sure in Striker&#39;s mind, whoever the Maximal \n&gt; &gt; leader \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was would probably be this team&#39;s next target. He couldn&#39;t let \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen. Setting his scanners to give him info on the chip in \n&gt; &gt; Spears&#39; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; head, Striker looks back at Prebon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Who should he name? Someone that Spears might have also named, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone who was experienced, someone like.....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ramulus,&quot; Striker says, &quot;And if you let Spears and me go, I \ncan \n&gt; &gt; lead \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you right to him.

He makes \nhis \n&gt; &gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outside, looking lovingly around at nature, even if nature was \na \n&gt; &gt; bit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; charred and cratered. This is where he belonged, not on some \nmoon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He looks back at the Maximals, waiting for them to say \nsomething.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
