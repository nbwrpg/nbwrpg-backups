Getting a lock, he fired \n&gt;a\n&gt;large explosive shell at Dark Mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Scavenger drove over Ramhorn&#39;s charred body, a scraping heard as the tires\n&gt;(made out of a flexible strong metal) scraped against Ramhorn&#39;s body, the\n&gt;side cannons opening fire, twenty &quot;bullets&quot; in all from the cannons heading\n&gt;at Ultracon.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Hiss landed, firing three fusion blasts at Shockwave, the robot not \n&gt;belonging\n&gt;to any factions falling back as the blats cut into his abdomen.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Dark One flew overhead, bringing up his targeting computer.  Locking on, he\n&gt;fired a single missile at Dark Mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;Shockwave raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at Hiss, then\n&gt;charging off, retreating from the newly arrived reinforcments as he saw \n&gt;Hell\n&gt;Beast, Gremlin, Jackle, and Marine arrive.  &quot;Logic dictates that I should\n&gt;leave immediately.&quot; Shockwave commented, transforming to space fighter mode\n&gt;and launching into the air.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
