Shut the\n&gt; hell up.  The best you can do is yell and call names to people?  If\n&gt; that&#39;s your best then just be quiet.  It&#39;s unproductive and it is\n&gt; irritating as hell since it has no purpose.  You want to complain\n&gt; like a ninny, do it PRIVATELY.  Dewboy&#39;s ideas have been creative and\n&gt; interesting, the only problem is they don&#39;t fit in that well with the\n&gt; RPG and once he gets used to it he&#39;ll have some pretty darn good\n&gt; ideas, and I&#39;m betting far better ones than you have ever or will\n&gt; ever come up with.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, to simplify, shut up with the OOCs where you insult everyone,\n&gt; ja?
