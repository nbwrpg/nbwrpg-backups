Belthassan was standing in front of the hologram representing \nthe emplacement of the new Tripredacus base on Earth. The elder brother \nlooked frustrated, his eyes closed,and didn&#39;t hear the techno-organic \nmandrill enter.\n\nGesper:\nSo what is the problem?\n\nBelthassan:\nYou took your time, didn&#39;t you? (There was a grin on his face, he had said \nthis jokingly.) See this? (He pointed to the high cliffs to the east of the \nbase) Those rocks are a lot too high for sensor coverage from the base. It \nblocks coverage towards that area. Installing a sensor net would be \npointless in battle; it would be destroyed far too easily. Tell me first, \nhow is the shield working?\n\nGesper:\nIt should be fully operational. The only thing is I&#39;m not sure the energy \nabsorption works totally. You&#39;ll have to tell me when Melch finishes fixing \nthe diversion core. (He turns to the holographic projection) As for this, I \ndon&#39;t think simple reconfiguration would do the trick. How about high \nprecision seismic scanners? It would work good enough for ground units \ndetection...\n\nBelthassan:\nGood idea, but anything could be detected with this...\n\nGesper:\nThen, maybe I can download a part of the matrix into the ship. This would \nprovide world coverage of everything with a spark.\n\nBelthassan:\nHmm... Yes... I could live with that. Can you do it now?\n\nGesper simply nodded and installed himself in front of the main computer of \nthe ship and started downlaoding the program.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
