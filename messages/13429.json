She had the feeling like they were being \nmonitored from somewhere.  Like the aliens were still keeping an eye \non them.  She looked up and down the hallways, but didn&#39;t see any \nmonitoring devices.  But that didn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t any.  She \nfelt a cold wave flow over her and she shivered. She could still \nsomething.  Something cold, mechanical and evil in the tunnels.   \nThis place just plain gave her the creeps. She followed behind \nQuickstrike and stayed close to him.  \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quickstrike looked at Dark Mouse. He recalled how Paralysis said \nhis name. \n&gt; It had a different pronouncation. It sounded like the original \nTarantulas&#39; \n&gt; name. He squinted in thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ah don&#39;t reckon if ah&#39;m even right, but this Tarantulas might be \nth&#39; old T \n&gt; ah know.&quot; he said to her. &quot;See, th&#39; one that tried t&#39; kill ya was \nuh clone. \n&gt; He told me that up front.&quot; He blinked. &quot;This might be mah old \nfriend.

He&#39;s back?&quot;  She reachede \nout\n&gt; &gt;to stop Quickstrike for a moment.&quot;Uh Quickstrike, he doesn&#39;t like \nme.\n&gt; &gt;I know, I&#39;m nothing but a mouse meal to him.&quot;  She shook a little\n&gt; &gt;from fear.  She had remembered when that spider had tried to kill\n&gt; &gt;her.  And on several counts had he tried to kill her.
