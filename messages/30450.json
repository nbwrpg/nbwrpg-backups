After the bite, that&#39;s when I started\n&gt; loosing my nice leopard pelt.&quot;  She lowered her head,&quot;I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; programmed to handle situations like this. What am I going to do?&quot;\n&gt; Then the idea struck her. She asked,&quot;UH, where are you going to take\n&gt; me to get fixed up?  Who are you? I don&#39;t want to walk into a death\n&gt; trap. Not after..after this.&quot;  She covered her face again and cried.\n&gt; Her chrome body, still slender and cat like, shined and reflected the\n&gt; light coming in from the windows.  It looked like a crystal prysm was\n&gt; in the window as the light and rainbows danced around inside the\n&gt; shuttle.  She tried to regain her composure and wiped her face with\n&gt; her hands. &quot;Now what do we do?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;*Orchid*&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Armada/Blizzard/Kamodia\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Kamodia watches as Feline walks into the shuttle.

She&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; in the shuttle with us right now. Can you bring us back in?
