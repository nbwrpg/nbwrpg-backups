Her tummy, for the \nfirst \n&gt; time in a while, was round and full of warm milk.\n&gt; Her little eyes started to close and then open again, close and \nopen again \n&gt; until they closed for the last time and she fell into a very \ncomfortable \n&gt; snooze. Half asleep but half awake too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
