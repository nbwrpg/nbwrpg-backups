He looks over at the femm, wondering if he should \nkill her. He was about to decide yes when he realized that the effort of \ntransforming into robot mode alone would probably put him into stasis, much \nless killing this femm.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he says quietly, &quot;A drink would be fine... How did I get here?&quot;\n\nHe had no choise but to use her to heal him, and then he would probably kill \nher, as he ussually did to anyone he had met.\n\n"}}
