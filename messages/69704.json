He uses his current state to his advantage, =\r\nand screches his rubber on his tires, pivoting them quickly to maneuver awa=\r\ny from the blasts.  He had no sonar senses to guide him but he had his audo=\r\n sensors and his sense of feel and touch, guiding him.  The system that Rat=\r\n Trap was now holding merely augments his audio sensors and even though he =\r\ncould have used the device, he was now quickly getting used to not having i=\r\nt on him.  And now, he could feel Rodimus&#39;s energy signature.  But first he=\r\n had to get rid of Scorponok and Dark Hawk.  He knew he did not have enough=\r\n energon in his main power core, but he did have a reserve stash in his bac=\r\nkup battery.  He calculated that since he had hardly touched this backup, i=\r\nt had close to ninety five percent capacity, yet it had to be used sparingl=\r\ny.  This meant deciding between vehicle and robot mode.  He makes a quick a=\r\nnaylasis of his systems.. Which would be able to concerve more?  Vehicle or=\r\n robot mode?  \n\nThe truth was, they were equal in ussage.  But he knew he h=\r\nad to stick to vehicle mode, to make for a fast getaway if he did indeed fi=\r\nnd a way out of there.. Meanwhile, hidden not too far now, from the torture=\r\n chamber, Rat Trap who has made his way into a vent hole, right over the ch=\r\namber, spots Tucson.  He then finds another bundle of wires and finds reada=\r\nble tags on them.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s wheels, he&#39;s up&#39;n runn&#39;n..  Must be on a backup ba=\r\nttery...  That might last a few hours but that&#39;s about it.  Okay, time for =\r\nthis rat ta be his rattiest!&quot;  \n\nHe finds a tag that leads to the chamber, =\r\nand begins to knaw at the wires that are connected to it.  He snaps them re=\r\nadilly with his strong, buck teeth.  The doors suddenly open in the torture=\r\n chamber.\n\n&quot;WHEELS, BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n\nTucson could hear Rat Trap&#39;s voice and w=\r\nithout questioning him, he spins his rear tires, creates a smoke screen and=\r\n senses the wind coming in from the open doors.  He takes this opportunity =\r\nto get past Scorponok, via creating a low lying smoke cloud, cloaking his c=\r\nhassse, and manges to get outside the chamber, stopping in front of Rodimus=\r\n.  Rat Trap continues to knaw at wires, hoping that one of them was another=\r\n wire that would disable the security and weaponry systems.\n\nOutside, Tucso=\r\nn transforms into robot mode and in front of Rodimus.  This was it,he was f=\r\nace to face with his former leader.  Rat Trap positions himself inside, at =\r\na peek hole, to watch what&#39;s happening.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, you wont&#39; believe thi=\r\ns, but, Tucson got outa there, and he&#39;s face ta face with Rodimus.  I sure =\r\nhope he gives &#39;em his come uppn&#39;s.  Lousey worthless piece of Scrap..  I ho=\r\npe wheels drives you to the ground&#39;n then some... &quot;\n\nAt the Ark and shuttle=\r\n area...\n\nQuickstride looks around and focuses on the shuttle.  Yet, the bo=\r\ndy of Optimus Prime holds his attention for a moment as he looks up to him.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Wow, you must&#39;ve been one heck of a leader in your days.  Rat Trap says =\r\nhe&#39;s with someone who&#39;s related to you.  I wish I could do something ta hel=\r\np you guys get back on your wheels, but I&#39;m just a Maximal and I really don=\r\n&#39;t know how to bring your men back ta life...  That Autobot out there could=\r\n sure use your help, looks like that Rodimus guy really let you down and ga=\r\nve into those Predacons. I really can&#39;t judge the guy because I wasn&#39;t ther=\r\ne when it happened, but from what Rat Trap says, I - dunno if I could ever =\r\nrespect a leader who weakens under pressure.  Okay, I gotta go, Lord Elder =\r\nneeds my help.  Rest in peace.\n\nHe salutes the still form of Optimus Prime =\r\nand gets to the shuttle. \n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;ve reached the shuttle and I&#39;m no=\r\nw performing preliminary take off proceedures.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus had been sta=\r\nnding just outside the torture chamber not sure if\n&gt; he wanted to actually =\r\nenter it. there was something about this room\n&gt; that gave him the chills, e=\r\nspecially when he didn&#39;t need to go in\n&gt; there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead he just stood =\r\nin the shadows, listening the words of the\n&gt; others like Darkhawk, Scorpono=\r\nk and that Autobot Tuscon. there was\n&gt; something about that Autobot that se=\r\nemed to grate on his nerves. He\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure what it was, maybe it was his=\r\n high sounding talk, maybe it\n&gt; was his tenacity, maybe it was his . . . .\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; *SLAM!*\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was jolted out of his revelry by the doors slammi=\r\nng shut,\n&gt; cutting him off from the torture chamber. Inside he could hear\n&gt;=\r\n threatening tones coming from Scorponok and Darkhawk, and the sound of\n&gt; a=\r\n vehicle&#39;s engine revving.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus&#39; attention was diverted from furthe=\r\nr listening as a message\n&gt; came over his comms, a text message from Percept=\r\nor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus... Go to this sector and watch out that our enemies doe=\r\nsnt go inside&quot; typed Perceptor fast and send the secret message &quot;They mustn=\r\nt get her... Do what ever you have to to stop them&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes!&quot; Rodimus jum=\r\nped as he could see the urgency with the speed that\n&gt; Perceptor was typing =\r\nthe message. &quot;On my way!&quot; he sent back as he\n&gt; received the location from P=\r\nerceptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus was surprised, as the location was only a short dist=\r\nance away.\n&gt; With a thought he quickly shifted into his vehicle, gunned his=\r\n motor\n&gt; and moved swiftly. He figured the &#39;her&#39; that Perceptor was referri=\r\nng\n&gt; to was Nightlight. Nightlight was Rodimus&#39; wife, he would not let\n&gt; th=\r\nose idiot Maximals get their hands on her!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Dark =\r\nRodimus)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
