Except for FZ wouldn&#39;t be the only one surprised at what he was staring at. What Halucigen would have seen, if he caught anything, would be the mind of a machine. A machine with computing power many many times that of a normal bot. A machine which controlled an entire battle cruiser. The Iron Fist. It towered inside FZ&#39;s mind, controlling his thoughts and actions. It wasn&#39;t a sentient being. That part was handled by a small part of Zardus&#39;s mind, somewhere behind and to the side of the part of FZ&#39;s mind that was the Iron Fist. (See his profile on nbwrpg.com to see how his mind got so weird).\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSomewhere in the Iron Fist, Zardus sharply turns his head toward where FZ was standing, his eyes narrowing as he detects something strange through the phsychic link.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Halucigen grasps the hand, trying to look into FZ&#39;s eyes.  To hold \n&gt; his stare for just long enough to corrupt his mind for a few seconds. \n&gt; To be able to scan and find out some information was all he \n&gt; needed right now.  Still his tail inches forward, now hanging jsut \n&gt; above FZ&#39;s foot ready to nail down and infect FZ&#39;s fuel lines with a \n&gt; microbot of control.  Halucigens to favourite attacks were in place \n&gt; and he almost had the better hand.\n\n\n"}}
