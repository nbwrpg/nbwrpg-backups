Which can develop into problems,� a deeper voice answered.  � \nThey have destroyed much of us, exposing our flesh and creating pain.� The \nbubbly tone responded � They must be terminated.�\nThe greater of the minds thought. � But to waste so needlessly, it�s not our \nway,� the deeper voice decided. It was the lesser minds turn to think now. � \nTheir bodies as well�could not decompose and feed us as the others do.� It \nspoke.  The greater mind agreed.\n6The voice bubbled along with the lava, leaving the greater mind to think of \nwhat it said, � So if we do not destroy them, what can we do? They cause \ndamage and inflict pain to us, such creatures much be more hostile the \npeaceful, surely.�\nThe deeper gurgled. � Yes, but they cannot decompose then they must be \nexamined more closely, so we may determine a way to either destroy them of \ndefeat them.� Bubbling in satisfaction, the lesser voice agreed, � We must \nunderstand before we can destroy�� it paused,��but how?�\nThe deeper voice laughed, � The only way we can.�\nThe magma in the cavern began to bubble and hiss as 6 spikes of lava shot up \nfrom the moving stream of molten rock, cooling very quickly and becoming \nbrown/black rock.  Suddenly layers of rock burst, leaving behind statues of \nvery similar beings as those they knew of above.\n� Once to the second realm we will give them life, sending them into the \nopen limbs of those�things,? The deeper of the two explained.\n� Creating beings to penetrate into society of infesting Metals, or spies \nwithin them. Perfect!,� the other bubbled/laughed. � With such limited \nthinking they will never know.� � Of course not.�\nThe statues melted back into the molten rock, while 20 clicks from the \nnearest Alliance position (island) the ocean began to boil. All sea life \nseemed untouched from the wave of heat then spilled out from the open hold \nthat just formed in the sea floor, lava flowing from it and into a wide \ncircle until, hours later, a round mountain formed, the outer layer cooling \nas the flow stopped and the water temperature returned to normal. In \nseconds, though, the crust of the mountain fell away to leave behind a \nsmaller one that was more egg shaped. In the second second chemicals began \nto meld in the rock, creating a smooth silver coating that covered the \nentire mountain, reflecting the light that spilled down from the surface.\nHoles appeared in the silver rock while rock melted over them until it \nbecame clear and formed glass. A larger hole appeared on the top of the \narmor coated hill rock from inside expelling out of it and into the ocean to \nbe caught and drift away in the tides as dust. The hole disappeared then.\nSo now, where a blank sand field had been before, a ship lay. Quickly being \ncoated with coral, quickly coating it to make it look like it�d been there \nforever.\nBut inside the ship, in a room freshly formed, lay the 6 statues. Each a \ndifferent size and each melding to form it�s own coating while the inner \nrock formed their workings. Soon, instead of rock, 6 transformers lay \ninstead.\nEven with the detail of each individual spark, each signature, and all \nformed from the elements. Earth�s new creations, given the power of life.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
