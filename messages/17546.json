The Lavacons and \nStarscream are engaging Megatron&#39;s forces.  I was going to try to \ntalk to Megatron, but Starscream found out it was an ambush and \nstarted fighting.  We are now heading to the old Pred cave base to \nfight Megatron and his new group.&quot; She said as she ran. She really \nwas feeling the pain in her side and the pain screamed at her.  She \nhad to ignore it for now and worry about the up coming battle.  Her \nmind ran with ideas, but nothing felt right.  She would have to wait \nuntill she got there to see the situation her self.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Yikes!
