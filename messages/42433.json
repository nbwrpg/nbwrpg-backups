She went to \nthe console and activated one of them.  After adjusting all the \nsettings, she stepping into the chamber and started to repair.  All \nthe while, replaying the events in her mind. FOr some reason, things \ndidn&#39;t make too much sence. If Galvatron couldn&#39;t stop two dragons, \nthen why was she still here? she wasn&#39;t following the strongest \nleader. She smiled at the thought of breaking his codes and getting \ninto his computer main frame. On the other hand, she hadn&#39;t really \nspent enough time with this leader to give him a fair appraisal. \nAfter all, she had to spent time with KitKat&#39;s group before really \nplacing any kind of trust in that dog. Well, wolf. Anyway, she would \nstay longer with this one. Perhaps she might be able to get him to \ngive her the codes later on once she gained his trust. then again, \nwhat Decepticon ever trusted one another. She sighed and decided to \nbide her time and see what would happen. In the mean time, she was \ngoing to get back to 100% in the chamber. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron and the rest arrived at the base. They walked in and \nGalvatron was \n&gt; now in a very bad mood. he didnt say anything. He just replayed \nwhat happened \n&gt; on the screen. They never should have even went. It was way too \nlate. He \n&gt; would have to upgrade his scanners. He looked at disgust and the \nhorrible \n&gt; tactics they had used. So sloppy. He turned to Darkmouse. &quot;Go and \nget \n&gt; repaired. Then I will have another mission for you.&quot;  He turned to \nGod \n&gt; neptune. &quot;YOu go in the simulator and train.&quot; He looked at \nGuieldart. &quot;How is \n&gt; our second plan going?&quot; Guiledart smiled. &quot;Good hes on his way.&quot; \nGalvatron \n&gt; had a shimmer of a smile then it faded as fast as it came. He went \nback to \n&gt; the tatics computer and watched to see if any new happening have \noccured. He \n&gt; suddenly reliazed something. &quot;Shredder!&quot; he sent a comm out. &quot;Where \nin the \n&gt; pit are you youve been gone for mega cycles.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
