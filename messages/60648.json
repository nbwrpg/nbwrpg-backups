Is she generally this annoying?&quot; he \nasked.  \n&gt; He was trully interested, he wanted a good way to torture her back \nfor what ever she had in mind fo him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague was not too far away.  Far enough to be out of sight, \nclose enough to hear the conversation.  She fought the urge o run up \nbehind him and pummel him, but she also just wanted to be around \nhim.  A strange thought indeed for a Minion.  She pushed hat aside \nand began linking the sensors on Malice&#39;s body to a computer panel.  \nShe intialized the connection and something bizarre happened.  \nMalice went rigid, emitted a pained groan, then completely shut \ndown.  Hellplague ran in after she was recieving no info on Malice&#39;s \nbody.\n&gt; &quot;What happened?  What did you do to him?&quot; she demanded as she \ntried to awake Malice to no avail.\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC: Did you get the email applying my new character yet? \n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s your life Hellplague not mine&quot;said sacastically the femme\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague/ Splattercannon/ Malice:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well no one asked you, now did they?&quot; Hellplague said as she \n&gt; stepped in front of Malice and placed some small sensors on \nMalice&#39;s \n&gt; face, head and on various locations all over his body.  She turned \n&gt; to Necross and splattercannon and told them to pull him to his \nfeet \n&gt; as she lessened the gravity holding him down.  The males obeyed \nand \n&gt; pulled Malice up roughly.  The bounty hunter leaned against \n&gt; Splattercannon as the sudden climbing to his feet made him a \nlittle \n&gt; light headed.  He stood up straight and tried to look behind him, \n&gt; because he couldn&#39;t see that mischevious Hellplague and that was \n&gt; cause for worry.  The Sweep commander shoo-ed away Necross and \n&gt; Splattercannon as she wrapped her arms around Malice&#39;s waist.   \nThe \n&gt; males obeyed with hesitation, while Necross left the room \nentirely, \n&gt; Splattercannon took position by the door.  Malice looked at the \narms \n&gt; around his waist and looked back at the femme biehind him.  It was \n&gt; at this time he actually noticed, she was kinda pretty.  She looked\n&gt; &gt;  like a Generation One Decepticon, only with no insignia.  But \nthe \n&gt; though passed out of his mind as quickly as it entered.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&#39;Scuse me, but I fel I must tell you something.  I&#39;m taken.  A \n&gt; little Maxi down there is waiting on me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The Minion did not speak, but walked around in front of Malice, \n&gt; her arms still around his waist.  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well she&#39;s down there, and I&#39;m right here in front of you.  \n&gt; Besides, I can offer you more than that Maximal-&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Maxitron actually,&quot; the hunter corrected,&quot;it seems she was \ndumped \n&gt; here on accident while dealing with her universe&#39;s Unicron.&quot; he \n&gt; added with a grin.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Whatever.  It doesn&#39;t matter, my pet WILL come around and \naccept \n&gt; me.  Blacknightmare-&quot; Hellplague said as she let go of Malice and \n&gt; shoved him back to the bed,&quot;Make him &#39;comfortable&#39;.&quot; she said with \na \n&gt; seductive grin.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I need to ready some equipment then we can begin.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
