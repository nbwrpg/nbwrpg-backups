He was\n&gt; glad to see his comrade.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Heeey, Cheetor, just in time! Great ta see ya! Oh, um, just ta let ya\n&gt; know, we have a comrade down here who is visually impaired, he might need\n&gt; some extra help getting out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson walks forward, now able to use his sonar system.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; He&#39;s right, I&#39;m visually impaired, but just tell me where I can get a\n&gt; foot and a hand hold, and I might just be able to get myself out of here.\n&gt; I attempted something I call the inverted spider maneuver. If I can do\n&gt; that, I might just be able to get out of here myself. A little bit of\n&gt; ninjabot training. Anyway, great to have you here comrades.&quot;\n\nFrom his position at the top of the pit it was very difficult for\nCheetor to see Tuscon as well as anyone down in the pit as they were\nnearly a hundred meters or more away or more. &quot;I hear ya!&quot; Cheetor\nsays as he squinted to look down. &quot;But why are you going to work so\nhard when we have ol&#39; Ramulus here?&quot; Cheetor asked, his voice booming\ndown into the pit, echoing along the sides. &quot;He&#39;s an expert at this\nkinda stuff.&quot;\n\n&gt; &quot;Time to go to my new home&quot;sighed the former predacon\n\nAs Perceptor grumbled about the prospects of his new home amongst the\nMaximals a metal cable with a hook began to extend its way down from\nthe top side of the pit. It took a minute or two to finally reach the\nover 100 meter drop to the bottom. It stopped perhaps a foot or so\nfrom the tunnel at Tuscon&#39;s position, dangling over the chasm that was\nbelow Tuscon and the rest of his crew. A hot wind blew up from below,\ncausing the cable to sway slightly.\n\n&quot;Grab on!&quot; Ramulus&#39; gruff voice from the topside of the pit. While his\nvoice did not carry as well as Cheetor&#39;s did it was clear he was as\nimpatient as he always was. &quot;We can pull you guys out.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: FYI: Ramulus and Airhammer are based on the original transmetal\nBW&#39;s characters, so feel free to have your characters have a history\nwith them or not as you wish :)\n\n"}}
