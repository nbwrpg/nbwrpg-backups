But the ugly thing was that Zarak still needed th=\r\ne extra\n&gt; forces that Hydras and his Predacons brought to the table.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So rather than commanding his Scorponok unit to open fire on =\r\nthe\n&gt; base he just nodded and said, &quot;I apologize, I have overstepped my pla=\r\nce.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Cyclonus and Scourge continued to face d=\r\nown Dark Rodimus,\n&gt; the air was tense as Dark Rodimus&#39; optics stared into C=\r\nyclonus, niether of\n&gt; them ready to back down, both of them remembering the=\r\n last battle they\n&gt; fought!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However it was Perceptor th=\r\nat broke the deadlock as he continued\n&gt; giving orders . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (PASTE)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rest, we have to Keep an eye in maxi=\r\nmal base things are\n&gt; becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interesting lately there, Rodimu=\r\ns... I need you for task&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The affect of the command was=\r\n almost instant as Rodimus stepped back\n&gt; from Cyclonus and Scourge and loo=\r\nked over at Perceptor. &quot;What&#39;cha need\n&gt; Percy?&quot; Rodimus said to Perceptor, =\r\nhappy for the moment that it was\n&gt; Perceptor and Hydras giving orders and n=\r\not Cyclonus and his lap dog.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus, seeing the break=\r\n in the tension also stepped back, pulling\n&gt; Scourge back with him. &quot;There =\r\nwill be another time Scourge.&quot; he said\n&gt; quietly, &quot;No need to fight this ou=\r\nt here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scourge nodded, &quot;Yes, there will be.&quot; he said =\r\ndarkly. His optics\n&gt; still watched Rodimus, his look almost hungry as he sm=\r\niled evilly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the tensions between Cyclonus, Scourge =\r\nand Rodimus cooled Zarak\n&gt; turned to look at Tuscon, wondering what informa=\r\ntion this bot could hold.\n&gt; &quot;Come&quot; Zarak said to Darkhawk, &quot;Let&#39;s see what =\r\nthis Auto . . . &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *BEEP*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zarak was =\r\ncaught in mid sentence by his scanner going off, the hand\n&gt; held one that h=\r\ne had been keeping trained on Tuscon. He glanced down at it,\n&gt; a curious lo=\r\nok on his face. For some reason it was registering a life sign\n&gt; where ther=\r\ne had been none before. It was located somewhere near Tuscon&#39;s\n&gt; head.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zarak stepped forward to take a more careful scan . . .\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Yup, the same scanner he ha=\r\nd been scanning him with a few posts\n&gt; ago.
