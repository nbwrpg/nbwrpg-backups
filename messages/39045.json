(Sort of like baking\n&gt;a cake, to bad Grizzltron&#39;s only half baked.) Veratis (Not all there to\n&gt;begin with) stood at the controls checking the bots status, all seemed to \n&gt;be\n&gt;intact so he opened the chamber, &quot;Greetings Grizzltron, was it? My name is\n&gt;Veratis, you are my guest for as long as you&#39;d like to stay.&quot; the old bot\n&gt;watches for any sudden movements from the bear hoping to avoid a repeat\n&gt;performance from the cave. &quot;Is there anything I can do for you?&quot; the\n&gt;scientist wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, in a one on one battle, what could a\n&gt;bot older than he could remember do against the younger, stronger looking\n&gt;bot that had been brought before him?\n&gt;\n&gt;(His logic circuits could have been repaired, his sanity is entirely up yo\n&gt;you.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: Beast Wars AKA Proto &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, July 04, 2001 7:18 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: Maximal City\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;OOC:  Just Admit it that Canada would be a lot differnt without the USA\n&gt;\n&gt;BIC:\n&gt;�Grizzltron�\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    The Cr Chamber Grizzltron was in finished.

You\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t just sound misenformed but like a sheep baaaaing the normal\n&gt; &gt;opinion out loud. The Americans had nothing to do with our independance,\n&gt; &gt;it was all the British decission, either do some research or stop\n&gt; &gt;running your mouth.\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
