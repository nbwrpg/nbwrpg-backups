Your sub is completely going \nagainst that. And if you look closely, the IF&#39;s main advantage is \nthat its on an island, not its defences (which are about as good as \nthe CF&#39;s anyways).\n\nMobile base means that bases can&#39;t move and be bases at the same \ntimes. THe Alliance base wasn&#39;t functional when it was moved, it \nwasn&#39;t even together. A moving powerful sub is a completely different \nmatter.\n\n::Zardus::\n\nZardus growls, snapping his head toward Cybershark as he grabbed \nZergling. Looking at his wrist comp to see the Iron Fist&#39;s report on \nwhat was happening, he looks back at Cybershark.\n\n&quot;Kill him,&quot; he says, firing his plasma launcher at Cybershark. The \nisland defences as well as the Iron Fist&#39;s own defences target \nCybershark, a horde of laser shots and a lot of missiles streaming \ntoward the bot.\n\nThe shuttles carrying the pieces of the Alliance base lift further \nup, careful to avoid weapon fire.\n\nZardus glances down at his wrist comp, looking through other scanner \nreport. The Predacons were back at their base, and at a spot near the \nsea...\n\nHe frowns. He&#39;d have to investigate that later.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dachande&quot; &lt;Dachande85@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::CyberShark/Zergling::\n&gt; \n&gt;     They met outside of what used to be the Alliance base. (If it \nwas destroyed then they weren&#39;t in it, I shouldn&#39;t be punished for my \nfather not getting e-mail back until last night.) CyberShark looked \nat Zergling, and saw the mindlessness there. He smiled.\n&gt;     He walked over to Zergling and grabbed him. Zergling fought \nback, but to no use. CyberShark opened his head panel and started to \nreprogramm him.\n&gt;     A couple of hours later Zergling was reprogrammed. He now \nserved CyberShark unquestiongly, but maintained a face of loyality to \nZardus.\n\n\n"}}
