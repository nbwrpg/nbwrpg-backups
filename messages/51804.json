First of all, your name isn&#39;t Kyle, and\n&gt; I refuse to call you that from now on.  Second of\n&gt; all, about your intelligence.  Being intelligent is\n&gt; only good in a very little way.  You can have the\n&gt; highest IQ in all of damned history, yet it&#39;s still\n&gt; nothing without WISDOM.  You lack wisdom, and\n&gt; therefore your intelligence is a joke.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second of all, I am not weird if I don&#39;t see women\n&gt; as nothing more than mere sexual objects.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; want to have children or marry somebody.  I\n&gt; extremely LOVE being alone, and I plan to be alone\n&gt; all of my life.  If I EVER want to have somebody\n&gt; there for me, it might as well be the VERY few\n&gt; friends I have.  Let&#39;s just say I have a lot less\n&gt; than 5 friends.  True friends, anyway.  Even if I\n&gt; haven&#39;t seen them.  Hehe.
