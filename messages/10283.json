Plintissa wasn&#39;t moving. Dracona smiled and walked back toward her ba=\r\nse. A dagger flew into Dracona&#39;s back. She spun around and grabbed the dagg=\r\ner in pain. Plintissa stood there.\n\n          &quot;You do not know when to give=\r\n up, you fool, but never mind that your an idiot, I&#39;m going to grind you so=\r\n small you won&#39;t be able to be seen with a microscope!&quot; Dracona said. She k=\r\nept her hand covered and flung the dagger back. It missed Plintissa and hit=\r\n Artist in the leg. Dracona smiled in satisfaction. Plintissa tackled Dacon=\r\na and took her down. Dracona once again turned to her saw blade to saw into=\r\n Plintissa. Dracona fired an ice beam, but Plintissa dodged. Dracona starte=\r\nd to burn everything with fire beams. Plintissa still avoids it. Plintissa =\r\nwas always a good fighter, but it wasn&#39;t until now, after her bad life that=\r\n she discovered her true fighting power. Plintissa beat Dracona mercilessly=\r\n. Draocona&#39;s parts were flung everywhere as Plintissa spun a simple stick t=\r\nhrough the air. Dracona raised the saw blade and sliced the stick to pieces=\r\n. Dracona laughed and sliced Plintissa several hundred times. Plintissa fel=\r\nl.\n\n          &quot;Th weak move aside and die so the strong can survive. As anc=\r\nient as the Cosmos, that has always been the way of things. I&#39;m sorry Plint=\r\nissa, you were a good friend, but don&#39;t take this personally, it&#39;s just bus=\r\niness.&quot; Dracona said.\n           \n          Dracona pulled back the saw bla=\r\nde and thrust it towards Plintissa. Plintissa grabbed her arm from earlier =\r\nand threw it. It hit Dracona&#39;s blade. Dracona slammed it into Plintissa, bu=\r\nt as she did, the blade came loose before it hit Plintissa. The blade flew =\r\nup. Dracona blinked her eye, the one Dinobot had scarred when she first ari=\r\nved on the planet. The blade sawed through Dracona and left her in pieces e=\r\nverywhere. Her spark extinguished. Her last words were:\n\n          &quot;*Cough,=\r\n Cough* Zardus I am sorry. Plintissa, do not forget your promise.&quot; And Drac=\r\nona died smiling. Plintissa remembered that she promised Dracona that she w=\r\nould never leave her sitting. Plintissa cried. Her mech fluid ran everywher=\r\ne and she got weaker and weaker. Artist stepped slowly over to Plintissa. H=\r\ne was crying, too.\n\n          &quot;Artist, I&#39;m sorry it had to end this way.&quot; P=\r\nlintissa whispered.\n\n          &quot;Why are you leaving me, Plintissa? Why does=\r\n everyone betray me?&quot; Artist asked.\n\n          &quot;Artist, there floats Dracon=\r\na&#39;s spark, recover it, we can&#39;t part, she really was my friend.&quot; Artist wal=\r\nked up and captured the extinguished spark as it tried to fly away. He cont=\r\nained it in a capsule.\n\n          &quot;Plintissa, if you leave me, I&#39;ll...have =\r\nno more reason to live, all my friends are gone, my helping days are over.&quot;=\r\n Artist said.\n\n          &quot;Your helping days are never over, and we&#39;ll alway=\r\ns be together.&quot; Plintissa said.\n\n          &quot;This isn&#39;t some lame thing abou=\r\nt how you&#39;ll always be in my heart, is it?&quot;\n\n          &quot;No, Artist, come he=\r\nre.&quot; Plintissa whispered. Artist looked at Team Ultima&#39;s base. It was destr=\r\noyed, the funny thing was, that it was destroyed by Dracona, the very one, =\r\nalong with Plintissa, that originally built it. And there it was, sticking =\r\nabove ground now and burning away. Sinesis looks at the base and sighs.\n\n  =\r\n        &quot;Twister, Dracona is dead, I guess we have to leave.&quot; Sinesis says.=\r\n Sinister stands next to Blizzard and sighs.\n\n          &quot;Blizzard, we need =\r\nto find another home, now.&quot; Sinister said sadly.\n\n          Artist came clo=\r\nser to Plintissa. Her spark suddenly burst from her and floated into Artist=\r\n&#39;s hands. She said to him what he needed to do. He opened his chest compart=\r\nment and his spark was revealed. Artist combined Plintissa&#39;s spark with his=\r\n own, they became one.\n\n          &quot;Till all are one.&quot; Artist whispered real=\r\nly low. Plintissa told him she still loved him. Artist was overjoyed! Plint=\r\nissa was with him now, and now they could never be seperated again. Artist,=\r\n completely ignoring Blizzard and Sinister, and Sinesis and Twister. ran ou=\r\nt into a field.\n\n          &quot;Artist, now we need to take care of Dracona&#39;s s=\r\npark.&quot; Plintissa said. (Remember, only Artist can hear Plintissa now) Artis=\r\nt headed toward the Maximal base, there Dracona would get a new body, one s=\r\nhe could not attack anyone ever again in, and where she can always be helpf=\r\nul. Artist held up the contained, Dracona&#39;s spark still inside.\n\n          =\r\n&quot;I love you.&quot; Artist said seemingly to nobody.\n\n          &quot;I love you too.&quot;=\r\n Plintissa said to Artist.
