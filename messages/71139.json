We&#39;re in uncharted territory now. The gr=\r\nound&#39;s very uneven here, doubt that my alt form is gonna do us any good. I =\r\ncould travel for a while like that but if I blow more than just one tire, w=\r\ne&#39;re sunk.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Better save it, and stick ta walking. =\r\nAnd why didn&#39;t ya think of loadn&#39; up on spares anyway?!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift lo=\r\noks back to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The Ark only carried so many spare tires for my make=\r\n&#39;n model. Yeah, the speedsters had plenty of spares but the bigger vehicles=\r\n, they&#39;re hard ta find.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap sighs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oh, so I take it they all=\r\n got used up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yep, between Tucson, me, and a c=\r\nouple others, we used &#39;em up because we&#39;re off road vehicles. C&#39;mon, I got =\r\nthe signal, and I think I know where we&#39;re headed.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They begin another =\r\ntrek toward the Black Fortresses former location.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I hope Cheetor&#39;s st=\r\nill in one piece.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe next leg of the journey is uneventful. The=\r\n path that the duo have\ntaken has become huge savannas, with the trees beco=\r\nming fewer and\nfewer as they move across hundreds of open miles.\n\nDinosaurs=\r\n are plentiful but generally seen at a distance as well as\nthe mammals and =\r\nother strange prehistoric beasts and birds. It would\nseem that none of them=\r\n want to have anything to do with the Autobot\nand the Maximal that trek acr=\r\noss their landscape.\n\nFinally, in the distance Nightshift and Rat Trap can =\r\nmake out the dark\nbillowing clouds of smoke that would signify a volcanic e=\r\nruption. The\nskies are darkening as the duo continue, the number of animals=\r\n and\nother life is becoming less and less, as noxious clouds of black vapor=\r\n\nroll across the land. However despite that both Rat Trap and\nNightshift=92=\r\ns compasses are telling them that they are still going in\nthe direction of =\r\nwhere the tower once stood.\n\nAt the moment there is still no signal from Ch=\r\neetor himself or sign of\nhis presence. But then again he was very much clos=\r\ner when his signal\nwas cut off. However as they approach, it is becoming mo=\r\nre and more\ndangerous as the heat is begining to rise.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
