Then he realizes that\n&gt;this is a perfect opportunity. New Pred, not much loyalty. This might\n&gt;be a good chance to recruit. Or it could just reveal his hiding\n&gt;place. But he has to take that chance or his eveolved group won&#39;t\n&gt;have a chance. Besides, his new body can probably take Battera. He\n&gt;yells down.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I&#39;m the one who can give you new purpose in life. How about joining\n&gt;me?&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
