He smiled as Spears put her head on his shoulder. Deeper \nand deeper into his web of deception she fell. He wondered that if he \nremoved the chip hat she would still stay with him. But she wouldn&#39;t, \nhe knew it. She would turn on him the first chance he got. But \nnonetheless, she was here, serving him. He called everyone together.\n\n&quot;Alright! We leave very soon to get Ramulus. He will be our link to \nrule the Maximals. Now, let&#39;s revise the plan. There will be no \nfighting. Bullet and Blaze, you will stay here and guard the \nprisoner. Spears, Hammer Ignatius and myself will go on to the Ark. \nIgnatius and Hammer will be holding Spears tight, and she will be \nscreaming, pretending to be wanting help. You will have to put on \nyour most convincing performance ever. I will tell Ramulus that if he \nwants you and Striker alive, than he&#39;ll meet me one on one. I&#39;ll say \nthat I&#39;ll exchange the prisoners for a map of all base locations, but \nwhen Ramulus comes, we&#39;ll hit him with the chip. We will send him \nback with Striker, whose memory has been cleared, and he will say \nthat the Maximals have hit a permanent Alliance with The Trainers, \nand Spears is staying with us as ambassador. Than anytime we want to \nattack, we will have full Maximal support because, well, I will be \nthe leader of the Maximals. Everyone understand?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
