Mwuhahahaha! Just kiddin&#39;:P Only \ntwo more days of testing to go then I think I&#39;ll be back to normal^_^)\n\nTavatron:\n\nThe wind softly rustled what remained of the Prarie grass that surrounded \nthe CF. Most of it had been burnt and mawled by the battle, but what little \nremained bent gently in the growing breeze. Her friend was right, the \ngestalts had made the difference. If not for them then the battle may have \nbeen won by theirs:\n\n&quot;I suppose. But our lack of organization was not of much help.&quot;\n\nWho was she kidding?! They had been all over the place, with no real \nleadership. It wasn&#39;t IR&#39;s fault that some &#39;bots were just too slaggin&#39; \nthick headed to listen to sound orders. Still, that was past, and if they \ngot through this battle perhaps the Maximals would be able to unify. Their \nwere too many seperate &#39;militias&#39;. Tavatron did, however, catch Dinobot&#39;s \nreaction when she mentioned the wounded:\n\n&quot;Perhaps you should take the time to count all of those who fought and \nnearly died for this battle, even though it was a lost cause. It is said \nthat blind faith is better than no faith. If they had no faith in our \ncommander and our cause wouldn&#39;t they have run at the first signs of an \nAlliance victory? They deserve a chance to rest, even if it means \nsurrendering to the Alliance.&quot;\n\nTavatron returned to Iron Raptors side opposite Dinobot. She wasn&#39;t angry \nwith him, but would it fry his circuits just to show a little compassion \nevery now and then? Sometimes he seemed impossible.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
