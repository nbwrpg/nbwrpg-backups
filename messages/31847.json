Lifting his leg, Lavatron stamps it down at\nTantrum.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tantrum was stupid, but not incompetent. He had expected the kick\nthis\n&gt; time, and  leapt to the side, and between Lavatrons legs. He then\ntried to\n&gt; gore his horns into Lavatrons leg that wasnt kicking outwards.\n\n\n"}}
