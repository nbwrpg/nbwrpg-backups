She slashed at him again, but he dissappeared infront \nof her eyes.  She felt something his her shoulder. She felt the shock \nof two programs trying to fight each other.  She dropped her spears \nand clutched at her shoulder, putting her hand over the chip. She \nfell to her knees and screamed out. Her eyes flashed and she fell to \nthe ground, going into stasis lock.  The two programs were cancelling \neach other out and shorting out her circuits.  A small ribbon of \nsmoke escaped out of her shoulder and around her neck. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Smokescreen/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus jumps back as Spears stabs at him, her quills leaving a \nrather deep \n&gt; slash in his chest.
