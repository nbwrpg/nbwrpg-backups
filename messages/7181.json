But for some unknown reason she almost felt like crying, as if they would never get out of this mess with their lives. But she kept her determined look, on in which challenged the enemy and simply said that she would not be conquered so easily.\nBut then her attention was drawn to Dark One�s words, indicating that they had reached the chamber!\nIron Raptor growled as she then tilted her head back and snapped at Dark One�s face again, her teeth bared and just dying to dig into his faceplate.\nThere was nothing else to do but be difficult and challenging, letting them know that she wasn�t going to give up so easily.\nSome had come to their rescue but they were failing, another thing that made this all so depressing. But there was one bot in particular that she thought would have come by now, on in which cared for her above all else. But he hadn�t, he hadn�t come to take her away from all this horror and misery. Prowl.\nBut with every fiber in her body she urged him to come, to be her knight in shining armor and save the day. \nWith no sign of him so far she then even wondered if he knew that she was captured, knew if she was even gone.\nBut then her thoughts were pulled back to their particular when she was suddenly whisked into the room in which almost made her shutter. But she kept her determined attitude when she felt like screaming for help; almost seeming like this was nothing more to her then shining her armor.\nWith the whoosh of the closing blast doors her hope soon dampened, now captured in the very room that they might end up never coming out of�alive.\nIron Raptor then crossed her arms and looked the other way, not even wanting to see if she could see what instruments of torture was in store for Tavatron, the bot whom deserved it the least. *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Zyber watched Rowdy run off with the other two Predacons, she wanted to go with him but she couldn�t involve herself in just one side. She hated this war with all her spark; she wasn�t about to join in it.\nShe sighed and then lifted a paw, stretching it towards Rowdy as he ran almost as if she was pleading for him not to go, a whine in her throat as she did so.\nBut obviously the side in which he had chosen needed him, she could not intervene.\nWith a sigh she then looked back towards his cave and then in the direction of her home, knowing that it was about time she had returned to her own den.\nBut she would let Rowdy know that she was heading back home, simply in the only way he knew of.\nZyber tilted her head back and howled, in hope that Rowdy would read it�s meaning. It relayed that she was going back to her own den and would be there if he need her for any reason, and also saying a farewell and good luck.\nAs her own howl then died away into the night she then turned towards her home sighing and then setting off in it�s direction, knowing that it would be a fortnight before she reached her home within a far cavern.\nAn arctic wolf setting off on a journey that would take her through forests, over and through rivers, over vast valleys and mountains and finally ending at the base of a winter tundra.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
