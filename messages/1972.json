Finally she dropped to all fours as she reverted to her black \nand brown beast mode. Tavatron made her way past the row of &#39;R chambers and \nstopped beside Dinobot.\n\nOf all the things that were lost to her, of all the things that were \nuncertain, there was one thing she was sure of... she would sooner face a \nfleet of Preds than tell anyone that she couldn&#39;t hunt. She could track an \nenemy blindfolded, but for the life of her couldn&#39;t follow the simplest \nanimal trail. By Primus, she had tried. She just couldn&#39;t do it!\n\nTavatron growled softly at the thought of being humiliated yet again. \nTavatron looked at Dinobot, avoiding eye contact. This time it was she who \ndidn&#39;t want him gazing into her optics. Tavatron sighed, perhaps she had \ngotten better over the years...\n\n&quot;Yes, I know of such a spot. Follow me.&quot; Tavatron took off at a brisk jog, \nall of a sudden she didn&#39;t feel like running anymore.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
