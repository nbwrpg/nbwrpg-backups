(first post)\n\n\n&gt; From: dcoburn@...\n&gt;\n&gt; NOTE TO EVERYONE: I am new.  My bots&#39; names are Hakibuscon and Skulletron.\n&gt; Skulletron serves the Alliance.  His beast mode is a Hyena.  Hakibuscon&#39;s\n&gt; beast mode is a very sneaky/stealthy Chameleon.  Remember one thing about\n&gt; Hakibuscon, HE DOES NOT SERVE ANY OF YOU PUNKS!!!  (I&#39;m just kidding!  You\n&gt; guys aren&#39;t punks!)  Just wanted to let you know that Hakibuscon is a\n&gt; lonerbot right now.  Can someone please tell me LOTS MORE about the\n&gt; Alliance?  I am not going to use Skulletron until I&#39;m caught up with what\n&gt; the factions are doing ok.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hakibuscon was walking through the jungle, and was getting very mad, as he\n&gt; had to keep slicing vines.  When Hakibuscon was past all the vines he sat\n&gt; on the ground for a while.  Suddenly, a huge panther was coming at him.\nHe\n&gt; tried to defend, but the panther was too fast.  He had to do something.\n&gt; And then it dawned on him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Vehicle Mode!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hakibuscon was in vehicle mode, so now he was speedy as well.  He wheeled\n&gt; out of the way and went behind the panther.  Then he shot 4 darts into the\n&gt; panther.  Each dart jolts 500 volts into a target, so all 4 darts put\n&gt; together makes 2000 volts.  The panther looked dead, just laying on the\n&gt; ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Transform!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hakibuscon went back into robot mode.  Hakibuscon lifted up the panther\n&gt; and twisted its neck.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s what you get when you screw around with me @SS#ole!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How was that for my first post?  Sorry it was a bit long.  I crammed a\n&gt; little too much in there.  Also, please let me know if cursing like that\nis\n&gt; against the rules.  Next time, I promise I will make a shorter post.\n&gt; Posting long posts is bad RP&#39;ing.  I was just getting carried away because\n&gt; it&#39;s my first post and this RPG seems SOOOOO exciting!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
