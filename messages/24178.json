He was placed on a death row while matters that \n&gt; transpired during the Beast Wars were being settled between the \nMaximals and \n&gt; Predacons.\n&gt;    Elsewhere, the Predacon Premier, Hell Beast, made plans to \nfinish what \n&gt; Megatron had started only a few years earlier. By collecting enough \nenergon, \n&gt; he could provide enough power to crush the Maximals once and for \nall, and put \n&gt; Cybertron into Predacon rule. He enlisted the help of \nsome &quot;friends&quot;. With \n&gt; the help of his allies, he was able to steal a Predacon warship and \ntravel \n&gt; back in time to prehistoric Earth via transwarp technology. Once \nthere, more \n&gt; allies planned on joining him, along with rogue Predacons seeking \ntheir own \n&gt; future.\n&gt;    Back at Cybertron, Maximal hero Liono Prime took action against \nthis \n&gt; outrageous act and he too travelled back in time with his own crew.\n&gt;     Both teams battled for a while, new allies and new factions \npopping up \n&gt; over time.  Eventually, the Maximal Blue Stinger hid the Autobots \nin a secure \n&gt; and unknown location, while Hell Beast held the Decepticons deep \nwithin the \n&gt; bowels of his warship.  For a time, battles ensued with little \nmilitary gain. \n&gt;  During this period, a few soldiers on each side were killed off, \nin example \n&gt; enemies Adrax and Autofire combated each other, but then fell to an \nicy doom \n&gt; while in combat.  Still, there were twice as many troops arriving \nfor each \n&gt; faction as news reached Cybertron of the ensuing battle.\n&gt;     As time passed, the flow of new troops slowed down, but the \nPredacons had \n&gt; a little over twice as many robots in their ranks in the Maximals.  \n&gt;     A major event transpired that must be delved into in great \ndetail because \n&gt; of the key importance it has in the future of the Alliance.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Zardus originally started out as a Predacon in Hell Beast&#39;s \nPredacon \n&gt; faction.  Zardus was a hacker/engineer, and his first task was to \nprove his \n&gt; loyalty.  He was ordered to accompany Inferno and Rampage on an \nattack \n&gt; against a human village, led by the human known as Proto (not to be \nconfused \n&gt; with the Proto under the Maximal Kluster&#39;s leadership).  Zardus \nproved \n&gt; himself, by the time the battle was over Zardus had lost two limbs \nand been \n&gt; blown through a stone wall.  He returned with Inferno and Rampage \nback to \n&gt; Hell Beast&#39;s warship, leaving the proto-human village inf lames.  \nHe was \n&gt; repaired and then given his first (and final) official assignment \nfor the \n&gt; Predacons.  To improve Predacon defense capabilities.  He succeeded \nwith \n&gt; flying colors.  When the Maximal Silverbolt came into firing range \nof the \n&gt; base, he was shot into stasis lock and taken prisoner.  But a \nsurprise attack \n&gt; consisting of the Maxis Rattrap, Doggus, and Armdabot was able to \nrecover \n&gt; Silverbolt and take Zardus prisoner.  But an attack by the \nPredacons rescued \n&gt; Zardus.\n&gt;     Several days later, Hell Beast cracked some codes on a disk he \nhad, \n&gt; discovering that the resting place of a great Predacon warrior lay \nin great \n&gt; lakes of lava.  Hell Beast went off to the lava pools and left \nZardus in \n&gt; charge.  Things went smoothly until Hell Beast arrived at the lakes \nof fire, \n&gt; and activated this warrior, who was Adrax (the first and final \ncharacter to \n&gt; be Decepticon size).  \n&gt;     Adrax soon tried to take control of the Predacons, and there \nwas a giant \n&gt; battle, uniting both the Maximals and the Predacons.  Zardus headed \nout to \n&gt; help in the battle, but two stasis pods crash landed, keeping him \nfrom aiding \n&gt; in the fight.  One pod belonged to Blue Stinger, who he proceeded \nto put in \n&gt; stasis lock and start to drag off towards the Predacon base, but \nwas rescued \n&gt; by the Maximals.\n&gt;     So Zardus went to the other pod, and converted him, Wolfgang, \ninto a \n&gt; Predacon, and they headed off to battle Adrax.  Adrax seemed \nunstoppable, \n&gt; eating Hell Beast who possessed a strange device.  The device was a \ntemporal \n&gt; disturber that rewound time back by several days. Blue Stinger was \nrecovered \n&gt; by the Maximals, but Zardus still got Wolfgang. No one had any idea \nAdrax \n&gt; existed, save Zardus, thanks to him arriving to the battle late.  \nZardus \n&gt; started having hallucinations about it though.  Back at the \nPredacon base, \n&gt; Wolfgang began complaining about having nothing to occupy himself. \nZardus, \n&gt; frustrated at the hallucinations lashed out, and a battle broke out \nbetween \n&gt; the two.  In the middle of the battle, Zardus had a hallucination, \nand when \n&gt; he came out of it the main computer for Hell Beast&#39;s ship had been \nshot.  The \n&gt; two were immediately thrown into the brig.\n&gt;     The two managed to break out, Zardus turning the defense system \nhe had \n&gt; created against all the other Predacons (except Wolfgang who was \nwith him), \n&gt; and the two fled.  They made their way to the Transmystics (a Vok \nfaction).  \n&gt; The Vok faction welcomed them.  Not to long later, Zardus and \nWolfgang found \n&gt; a giant energon crystal, which they planned to use against everyone \non Past \n&gt; Earth.  But the Transmystics found out, and the Transmystic leader, \n&gt; Firestorm, accidentaly shot the crystal, igniting.\n&gt;     When Wolfgang and Zardus came to, they found their bodies had \nbeen \n&gt; upgraded somehow in the blast.  Later on the Transmystics fizzled \nout and the \n&gt; faction was gone.  The duo soon joined the Maximals, where not to \nlong after \n&gt; there was a huge battle.  The Predacons had made an offensive \nstrike against \n&gt; the Maximal base.  Zardus saw an opportunity, and headed for the \nPredacon \n&gt; base.  But Scorponok stopped him from blowing up the base with a \n&gt; self-destruct sequence, and the ceiling collapsed on the two.  When \nthe other \n&gt; Predacons returned after a retreat, Hell Beast dug Zardus out and \ntook him to \n&gt; a pit of lava (not near Adrax&#39;s pits), and tossed him in.  Wolfgang \nattempted \n&gt; to aid his comrade, but fell in the pit.  The energon residue left \nfrom the \n&gt; crystal on the two blended with the lava to upgrade their bodies \nonce more.  \n&gt; After they got out of the pit, they returned to the Maximal base.\n&gt;     Another stroke of genius struck Zardus, who headed off to the \nlava pits \n&gt; where Adrax was.  He was intercepted by Predacons who forced him to \nretreat, \n&gt; and then they reprogrammed Adrax so he was loyal to the Predacon \ncause.\n&gt;      Not to far off in the future the Predacon and Maximal bases \nlaunched off \n&gt; into the air and opened fire on each other.  Zardus and Wolfgang \nfled, but a \n&gt; power drew Zardus to an orb.  The orb burned into Zardus&#39; left \npalm, and \n&gt; upgraded his body.  The orb explained it was a Vok that had tried \nto \n&gt; eliminate the Maximals and Predacons in the Beast Wars.  It then \nordered him, \n&gt; after quite a bit of torture, to create his own faction to \neliminate all the \n&gt; factions on Past Earth.  Zardus flew back to Wolfgang and showed \noff his \n&gt; power, and they agreed to create the new faction.\n&gt;     Zardus and Wolfgang united with a mercenary group called the \nContracons \n&gt; to start their new faction.  The base of operations for this new \nfaction was \n&gt; the Contracons&#39; own base.  Other robots soon joined them, including \nRattrap, \n&gt; Doggus, and Ominous Prime.  They built a new base, and fought in \nthe war for \n&gt; a long, long time, assisting the Maximals.  There were some \narguments, but in \n&gt; the end the faction was called &#39;The Alliance&#39;.  Eventually, \nWolfgang \n&gt; convinced Zardus to split the Alliance from the Maximals and become \n&gt; completely seperate.\n&gt; \n&gt;     So, as time passed, forces continued growing slowly, the \nAlliance being \n&gt; the largest faction that wasn&#39;t with the Preds or Maxis. Though \nthey were the \n&gt; weakest in comparison with the Maximals and Predacons.\n&gt;     Time passed as fighting broke out again and again.  Nothing \nreally major \n&gt; occured.  The three major factions were at a stalemate.  None could \ntake the \n&gt; other out.  It remained that way for a long, long time.\n&gt;     But, a great variable changed the direction of the Neo Beast \nWars.  \n&gt; Instead of just a complete Predacon or Maximal victory that was \napparent, the \n&gt; Alliance began to rapidly grow.  Being more organized with a \ncompetent \n&gt; leader, the orb departing from Zardus&#39; palm, and faster response \ntime, the \n&gt; Alliance was able to retrieve most of the stasis pods, growing \nquite rapidly \n&gt; in numbers.  Soon the Alliance was just a little more than half the \nsize of \n&gt; the Predacons.  But, as stated before, they were more organized and \nwere a \n&gt; strong force, almost as equal as the Predacons and Maximals.\n&gt;     The Ark itself became the base of operations for the Maximals, \nand the \n&gt; Ark was piloted to the Himalayan Mountains.   It became more \nappartent to the \n&gt; Maximals as time went on that a major roadblock in their success \nwas their \n&gt; leader, Liono Prime, who seemed rather incompetent.  Still, the \nMaximals put \n&gt; up with him.\n&gt;     The first sign of Liono&#39;s imminent fall from leadership was \nwhen the \n&gt; Alliance engaged two new Maximals who had just arrived on Past \nEarth.  One of \n&gt; Maximals was killed, Reroute, and Ramhorn, the other openly blamed \nLiono, and \n&gt; telling it too everyone else.  \n&gt;     The Predacons and Alliance joined forces on more than one \noccassion to \n&gt; attack the Ark over and over.  The Predacons and Alliance also \nattacked \n&gt; seperately.  Each battle left the Ark badly damaged, most defenses \ngone, and \n&gt; most forces in CR chambers.  The Maximals blamed Liono Prime for \ntheir \n&gt; constant defeats.\n&gt;     It continued in this manner for sometime as the Predacon and \nAlliance \n&gt; forces began hurtin the Ark more and more, inflitrating a few times \nand \n&gt; damaging computers and CR chambers.\n&gt;     But, a break came for the Maximals.  The Predacon Megatron, \nfrom the \n&gt; first Beast Wars, tried to usurp Hell Beast with the aid of Tankor, \n&gt; Quickstrike, Inferno, and a few others.  But his plot failed, and \nhe left \n&gt; with his men to build a new base.  Time and time Megatron tried to \nusurp Hell \n&gt; Beast.\n&gt;     Eventually he succeeded, Quickstrike taking control of the \nPredacon \n&gt; computer and turning internal defenses against its occupants.\n&gt;     Hell Beast and his loyal supporters retreated to a crashed \ncraft that had \n&gt; been a prison transport that crash landed on Past Earth.  It had \ntransported \n&gt; three Predacons loyal to Hell Beast.  They used the still \nfunctioning CR \n&gt; chambers, and retook the base.  Megatron later on took the form of \na \n&gt; diagnostic drone to inflitrate the base and spy.  \n&gt;     A mercenary group, the Oblitercons, landed, fleeing Cybertron, \nand joined \n&gt; the Alliance.  After terms were discussed they were sent by Zardus \nto aid \n&gt; Megatron so he could usurp Hell Beast and make everything topsy-\nturvy for the \n&gt; Preds.  Megatron insulted the Oblitercon leader, who opened fire on \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s diagnostic drone form, nearly killing him.  But he \nfled.  They \n&gt; proceeded to damage Quickstrike&#39;s already badly damaged leg, and \nthen \n&gt; returned to base.  Megatron returned to his biped form.\n&gt;     The Oblitercons turned out to be a gestalt form, creating the \ngiant 45 \n&gt; foot tall gestalt Oblitertron.  This boosted the Alliance into the \nspotlight \n&gt; as the strongest faction in the Neo Beast Wars.  The Oblitercons \nare also \n&gt; important because they were the very first gestalt team to take \npart in the \n&gt; Neo Beast Wars.\n&gt;     With their new gestalt, the Alliance began thrasing the Ark, \nwith the \n&gt; help of more new recruits.  They began to not only inflitrate the \nbase, but \n&gt; got to the Ark&#39;s bridge and damaged Teletran-1 and 2 several \ntimes.  The \n&gt; Maximals also seemed to be a little scared of Oblitertron.\n&gt;     A new group arrived, called the Newcomers.  Lead by Koga Shuko, \nCEO of \n&gt; Pred Tech Incorporated and Shuko Inc., and Set, another wealthy \nPredacon and \n&gt; business owner.  As Maximals arrived on scene to check out their \ncrashed \n&gt; ship, the Newcomers attacked them, and took the fight to the Ark.  \nIt was \n&gt; later learned that Koga Shuko and Set were the creators of the \nOblitercons.  \n&gt; They had hoped to sell gestalts for amazing prices and become ten \ntimes \n&gt; richer.  But the Oblitercons broke free from the lab where they \nwere created, \n&gt; and blew the laboratory up, and fled to Past Earth where they were \nshot down \n&gt; by Shuko&#39;s men.  Now an expedition had been led to Past Earth to \nretrieve \n&gt; energon and either capture or kill the Oblitercons.\n&gt;     The two wealthy Predacons brought along with them a gestalt.  \nDark \n&gt; Messiah.  Who was made up by the gestalt team, the Dieties.  Each \nDiety was \n&gt; based on some god from Earth mythology, the mythologies being Greek \nand \n&gt; Egyptian.  Ra, the team leader. And Hades, Ares, Zeus, and Anubis.  \nThey \n&gt; proved to be quite the nuisance.  \n&gt;     As time went on, the Newcomers dished out much disaster.  In \nresult of a \n&gt; battle between the Newcomers and Oblitertron, a base belong to \nthe &#39;Chosen \n&gt; Ones&#39; was destroyed.  The Ark also took some shots that it would \nnever \n&gt; recover from. But, eventually Set went missing and Ra switched over \nto the \n&gt; Predacon side under Hell Beast&#39;s command.\n&gt;     A great Predacon warship titled the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; landed on an \nisland, the \n&gt; faction inside calling themselves the Militrons.  They began to \nconstruct \n&gt; island into a supposedly impenetrable fortress.\n&gt;     Alliance leader Zardus set out for negotiations and formed a \nslight \n&gt; alliance, while Megatron erected a truce between his Predacon \nforces adn the \n&gt; Militrons.\n&gt;     Meanwhile, during a battle at the Alliance base, Koga Shuko \nfound a fang \n&gt; that was made of metal instead of calcium carbonite.  He returned \nto his base \n&gt; with his minions, and cloned the source of the metal fang.  What he \ngot was a \n&gt; clone of the Predacon warrior Serpentor. Serpentor had been loyal \nto Hell \n&gt; Beast and in a battle was captured.  In an attempt to escape, he \n&gt; self-destructed in an attempt to do as much damage as he could \nseeing th end \n&gt; was near.  \n&gt;     After seeing that he would die if he didn&#39;t help Koga, he aided \nhim.  \n&gt; Even with the extra-firepower, it didn&#39;t help all that much.  Soon \nan \n&gt; intruder was found.  The Maximal Amobeous.  He had found an \nunderground base \n&gt; by going into his amobea form and travelling on an unidentifed \nrobot.  Koga \n&gt; Shuko learned the information, and killed him, and alerted all \nfactions in an \n&gt; attempt to attack them while they were investigating.  It didn&#39;t \nwork.  No \n&gt; one went looking.\n&gt;     Soon, it became apparent to Shuko that he couldn&#39;t win in his \ncurrent \n&gt; position of power.  So he pulled out his wild card.  Sixshot.  \nNamed after \n&gt; the first Cybertronian STAG (Solo Transformer Assault Group).  He \nhad the \n&gt; same abilities and look.  He proved to be a valuable asset.  But in \nthe end, \n&gt; he failed to change the tide.  In one attack, a bridge officer of \nthe \n&gt; Newcomers&#39; was knocked into stasis lock and died of wounds.  Some \nof the \n&gt; Dieties were blown apart.  In the end, the Newcomer Unitron, \nShuko&#39;s second \n&gt; in command, killed the other bridge officer and Hades.  He crippled \nKoga \n&gt; Shuko and set the self-destruct sequence.  He then left the ship as \nfast as \n&gt; he could, the base exploding.  Only three other Newcomers escaped.  \nSixshot, \n&gt; Ares, and Serpentor.  No one else knew what happened to the \nNewcomer base.  \n&gt; It simply blew up.\n&gt;     The Neo Beast Wars was relatively quiet, except for the average \nAlliance \n&gt; attack.  The Alliance grew bigger.  The Predacons began to \nseperate.  The \n&gt; Maximals sat in their Cybertronian Fire.  Their fortress.  As the \nArk lay \n&gt; barely guarded and most of it rather damaged. A surprising turn of \nevents was \n&gt; when Tigerhawk, Blue Stinger, Keyura, and the Maximal leader Liono \nPrime left \n&gt; suddenly, leaving the Maximal Iron Raptor in charge of the Maximal \ncause.  \n&gt; The Maximals looked up to her for hope, and the Predacons and \nAlliance were \n&gt; worried.  Now that the Maximals didn&#39;t have an incompetent oaf for \na leader, \n&gt; could they be a true factor in the Neo Beast Wars?\n&gt;     Soon repairs started upon the Ark.  Just a little later, Zardus \n&gt; disappeared, not before leaving Nemesis Enforcer, the second-in-\ncommand of \n&gt; the Alliance in charge of his faction.  Zardus often disappeared \nfor unknown \n&gt; reasons.  Nemesis Enforcer learned of the effort to rebuild the \nArk.  So he \n&gt; launched an all out attack on the Ark, badly damaging it.  Teletran-\n1 and 2 \n&gt; were destroyed.  Shields were gone.  All outer defenses were \nobliterated.  \n&gt; The CR chambers were destroyed.  The only thing that really worked \nwas Iron \n&gt; Raptor&#39;s personal computer program, IRIS, which existed in the Ark.\n&gt;     Zardus returned, and reminded Nemesis Enforcer that if the Ark \nwas \n&gt; destroyed, most likely the Alliance would follow, and it wasn&#39;t in \ntheir best \n&gt; interests.  But Nemesis Enforcer is known as a psychotic robot.\n&gt;     Things remained at a norm.  The relationship between the \nMaximal Prowl \n&gt; and Maxi leader Iron Raptor grew as they spent a several day night \nin Iron \n&gt; Raptor&#39;s room.  It&#39;s unknown what they did...but there are educated \nguesses...\n&gt;     A surprising thing happened.  Vulois, a Predacon entered the \nNeo Beast \n&gt; Wars and found a Transmetal Three Drive.  He shortly served under \nHell Beast, \n&gt; after turning himself and a few others into Transmetal Threes.  \nHell Beast \n&gt; attacked Vulois though, since Vulois held the TM3 Drive and had \ntried to get \n&gt; members of Hell Beast&#39;s group to usurp, and took him prisoner and \ndestroyed \n&gt; Drive.  Vulois and his followers escaped though.\n&gt;     Later, there was an explosion, and it is rumored that Vulois&#39; \nsister \n&gt; died, while he was visited by the Oracle and the Matrix and told \nthat he was \n&gt; to unite the factions on Past Earth and start up an organic \nCybertron.  He \n&gt; set out with his two helpers, the female Baterra, and Soundwave.  \nNot to be \n&gt; confused with the G1 Soundwave.\n&gt;     Vulois would handle diplomatic relations with the Predacons.  \nBattera the \n&gt; Maximals.  And Soundwave the Alliance.  They hoped with the three \nmajor \n&gt; factions united as one, the other swould soon follow.  Vulois built \na base, \n&gt; called the Embassy, and employed the help of other robots, many \nresembling \n&gt; angels.  And a young powerful robot called Child who had a great \nmass of \n&gt; powers but needed training.  \n&gt;     Battera was met with suspicion at the Cybertronian Fire.  \nVulois never \n&gt; made it to the Predacons.  He was to busy at the Embassy. Soundwave \nnever \n&gt; returned from the Alliance base.  He was led into a conference \nroom, but was \n&gt; murdered by the Alliance.  The last thing they wanted was peace \nbetween \n&gt; anyone, and especially peace that wouldn&#39;t help their agendas.\n\n\n"}}
