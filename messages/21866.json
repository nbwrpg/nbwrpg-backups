It made no movement to attack, \nthe only movement it made was a loud roar and then stare at the two \nbots before it.\n\n&quot;Greetings&quot; Veratis began, &quot;I am Veratis, and this is Foxfingers.&quot; He \ntried to stay back in case of trouble. A sudden movement from \nFoxfingers set the raptor on immediate alert. Spotting the scarred \nmaximal symbol set his functions spinning. With a quick jump it leapt \nforward, Foxfingers ducked in time to avoid the blow.\n\n&quot;Full alert, Lunarpine and Ice to the lab.&quot; Veratis shouted \ntransforming to his half bat mode ready to defend himself. The raptor \nlashed out with it&#39;s tail connecting with Foxfingers chest. \nFoxfingers fought to maintain control but lost his balance. The \nraptor turned to attack again, &quot;Razor Claw Terrorize.&quot; He transformed \nexactly like the origional dinobot but his head looked more \ninsectoid. Antenna type ears rose above his head. He drew his sword \nfor the deathblow.\n\nLunarpine hears Veratis&#39; transmission, &quot;We&#39;re needed,&quot; he exclaims \nunneededly, He knew that Ice probably heard the cry telepathically \nbefore the comm relayed it.\n\n --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She turned and looked at Lunarpine. &quot;What little game is that? From \n&gt; what I&#39;ve seen, this Veratis isn&#39;t a killer. He&#39;s not trying to \nharm \n&gt; anyone. But what I don&#39;t understand is this prophecy of his. He \nkeeps \n&gt; thinking about it, but I can&#39;t see that far into his mind to really \n&gt; understand it. OK, Sure he can be grumpy. But what game are you \n&gt; refering to?&quot; She was trying to keep her mind out of his.  She was \n&gt; controlling it so that she wasn&#39;t jst reading the minds of the bots \n&gt; near her. She would respect the thoughts of the other bots and not \n&gt; get into thier heads. That is unless it was absolutely nessasary.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s OK, You did real good.&quot; Lunarpine smiled since he now knew \n&gt; where they\n&gt; &gt; stood. &quot;He told me a little about the prophecy. It seems like \nit&#39;s \n&gt; almost a\n&gt; &gt; religion to him and his group. The three of them seem almost \n&gt; fanatical about\n&gt; &gt; it.&quot; He walked past her a little, his back was now to her, &quot;Let&#39;s \n&gt; play thier\n&gt; &gt; little game and see just what the next move is.&quot; He didn&#39;t \nexactly \n&gt; trust the\n&gt; &gt; scientist but wanted to repay the debt he owed. If that meant \n&gt; pulling one of\n&gt; &gt; his group out of trouble then that&#39;s what he&#39;d do. He wouldn&#39;t \ndrag \n&gt; Ice into\n&gt; &gt; this battle though, he still thought of her as the recon bot that \n&gt; Shadow\n&gt; &gt; Wing had been.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veratis stood up for a moment holding his head. &quot;Is there a \n&gt; problem?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Inquired Foxfingers as he placed a hand on his meantors back. \n&gt; Veratis\n&gt; &gt; glanced around the room, trying to regain his equilibreum, &quot;I \njust \n&gt; got dizzy\n&gt; &gt; for a moment it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Protoform with the Raptor DNA was nearly complete. Veratis \nhad \n&gt; hoped\n&gt; &gt; that the spark inside could be taught the ways of Prime. Time \nwould \n&gt; tell\n&gt; &gt; just who or what would become of the new translife form.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
