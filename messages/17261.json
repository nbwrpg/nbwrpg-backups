I finally found a place where I can belong.  I wasn&#39;t \nreally welcomed at the maximal ship. But Here? I belong. I found my \npurpose.&quot;  Se didn&#39;t know it was the chip doing all the talking.  She \nthought about where she last saw Zardus.  &quot;Hmm, I left him int he \nhallway near the labs.  He had that..&quot;she almost lost her temper \nagain,&quot;that little bird queen bot that stopped by here.&quot; She looked \nat the wall and lost it.  She slammed her fist into the wall and \nlooked at the small dent her fist left behind.

He also knew that he would never be able to over power \nZardus, that the only way he would be able to escape was to get on an \naway from base mission and cloak.\n&gt;     &quot;I need to speak to Zardus,&quot; He said to Battera in a very \nbuisness like tone. &quot;Can you tell me where he is?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
