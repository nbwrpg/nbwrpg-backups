He glanced inside \nto see where it came from. Knowing that it was a restricted area \nPhobia stepped back to make his intrusion appear an accident. \nTransforming into his spider form he started in the direction the \nblur went. Using two of his eyes he played back what he saw in slow \nmotion. It was a Maximal. Phobia mistook Magmatron for a being who \ndidn&#39;t take prisoners. If he mistook that then what else had he \ngotten wrong?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Dachande85@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Magmatron::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He saw Cheetor run through the door and down the hall.\n&gt;     &quot;Computer, close all exits.&quot; Magmatron said. He then went to \nhis computer \n&gt; room. He sat down and started looking for signs of Cheetor. Once he \nfound him \n&gt; he sealed the hallway so he couldn&#39;t escape. He then touched his \nface.\n&gt;     &quot;Bad Kitty,&quot; He said over the comm. &quot;Now listen, I am not a bad \nguy, I \n&gt; would like you to help me. I actullay like the Maximals, so I would \ndo \n&gt; nothing to destroy them. I only wish to talk to you, so please sit \ndown and I \n&gt; will be there in a second.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ::CyberShark::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Carring Pantron on his back he zoomed to the Destron base. When \nhe got \n&gt; there he looked down at Pantron&#39;s face, it was almost completly \ndestroyed. He \n&gt; needed a lot of time in a CR chamber. But the doors were sealed to \nthe Base.\n&gt;     &quot;What the--&quot; CyberShark asked himself. &quot;There must be an \nemergency \n&gt; inside. Magmatron it&#39;s me, CyberShark. I have Pantron here and he \nneeds time \n&gt; in the CR chamber, he&#39;s almost blown to scrap.&quot;\n&gt;     The doors opened and CyberShark transformed and ran in. He ran \npast \n&gt; everythin untill he reached the CR room. Putting Pantron in there \nhe slammed \n&gt; the door shut and started it up. It quickly assesed the damage, his \nSpark was \n&gt; fading, he was going to die.\n&gt;     CyberShark opened the door and opened his Spark Container, what \nhe was \n&gt; about to do was nearly impissible to do, he needed to remove his \nspark. \n&gt; Finally he found something to put it in, it was crude and wouldn&#39;t \nlast \n&gt; forever, but it would work. Putting the Spark in the container, he \nstarted \n&gt; repairs on Pantron&#39;s body.\n\n\n"}}
