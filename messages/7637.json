She found a small herd of \nZebra and layed low in the grass.  She stealthily crept closer and \ncloser to on Zebra which was standing a little ways away fron her.  \nShe crept in closer and closer.  POUNCE! She ran after the creature \nwith speed and accuracy.  She jumped and bit down on it&#39;s neck and \npulled it to the ground.  She dragged the zebra back to the base and \nate heartliy.  \n\nAfter a bit, she sat under a small shade tree and relaxed in the \nday&#39;s heat.  She felt like her old self again.  She looked at what \nwas left of the carcass.  It had reminded her of old kills with her \npride back home.  But here she was, with a bunch of bots she didn&#39;t \nreally know. She felt a little like an outcast.  She layed her head \ndown on her paws.  She realy missed her pride.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Dachande85@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Primal Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt;     He gets to Hot Rod&#39;s position.\n&gt;     &quot;Hot Rod I have to talk with you in private, it is of the \nutmost \n&gt; importance,&quot; Optimus said.\n\n\n"}}
