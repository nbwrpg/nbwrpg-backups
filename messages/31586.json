So Void \nis kinda the brains behind the Ark which means unless you have passwords and \ncodes docking and openning anything would be really impossibile without \nmassive amounts of brute force. So can we back it up abit there alot of \nmissed defense grids.))\n\n::The 2 WildCat Ships breach earth space and continue toward the Ark::\n\n::Liono::\n&quot;Void plot a course through the spaces mine with little to no danger.&quot;\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
