Let the slaughter begin!&quot; Koga Shuko \npre-emptively said, chuckling.\n\n---\n\n&quot;ROCK AND ROLL!!!&quot; a voice screamed.\n\nAll the Newcomers&#39; attention went to the source of the voice.\n\n&quot;What the...?&quot; Koga Shuko asked aloud, seeing Scattershot descending rapidly \nin his robot mode...wearing...some Predacon&#39;s head!\n\n&quot;Scattershot!  That traitor!  I signed him on as my soldier!  ATTACK!&quot; Koga \nShuko yelled, firing two optic blasts, each hitting Scattershot in the \nabdomen, but he ignored it.\n\nUnitron raised both lasers, raising an arm as cover as 20 explosive bullets \npelted his armor, sending him stumbling back.   \n\nScattershot landed, uppercutting Unitron, quickly followed up by a roundhouse \nkick, sending the Newcomer crashing to the ground.  Two laser bolts struck \nhim, not even fazing him.  &quot;Fools!  I have the power of myself AND \nDeathStorm!  I am a god!&quot;\n\n(In truth, Scattershot disabled his pain circuitry, so he isn&#39;t going to be \nslown down by pain, of course, if you blow off a leg, it won&#39;t matter if he \ncan&#39;t feel the pain)\n\n-----\n\nBeachcomber took Smokescreen, putting him in a CR chamber.  He looked to \nProwl.  &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; he yelled, raising his heavy laser rifle, charging for \nthe battle.\n\n-----\n\nNemesis Enforcer hovered in the air for a moment.  &quot;By the Pit!  That fool is \nwearing DeathStorm&#39;s head as a hat!?  Hmmm...I should&#39;ve thought of that!&quot; \nNemesis Enforcer said, raising his rifle and taking aim.\n\n"}}
