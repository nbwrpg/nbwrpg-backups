Rauq? Yan? Alloran? The silent\n&gt;one that never speaks?\n&gt;\n&gt;~Qs7- Who recalls Rauq saying weapons that affect multiple units are\n&gt;illegal, well wouldnt weapons affecting an entire continent be\n&gt;illegal?\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Azure The Warrior&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The transwarp passage opened near the nexus known as Earth. A large\n&gt;form\n&gt; &gt; then made its way through and flew towards the planet. It\n&gt;ressembled some\n&gt; &gt; kind of winged whale, but it was obviously not an organic being.\n&gt;However,\n&gt; &gt; the very way it moved told of organic origins...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside the ship, three transformers operated the Shadow Destiny.\n&gt;They were\n&gt; &gt; the Prophets, the elite Tripredacus Strike Force.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gesper:\n&gt; &gt; We are on final approach of Earth. Geostationnary orbit in 3,2,\n&gt;1... stable\n&gt; &gt; orbit achieved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The ship&#39;s wings flailed in the void of space to keep it over a\n&gt;precise\n&gt; &gt; continent of the planet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana:\n&gt; &gt; Target in sight. I can fire whenever you wish.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Prepare the key to vector Sigma. Fire when you have a lock.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana:\n&gt; &gt; What? We have the key with us? This is utter madness! You\n&gt;jeopardize this\n&gt; &gt; mission by bringing it with us!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Shut up, sister! The key shall be terminated as soon as we have no\n&gt;more use\n&gt; &gt; for it, and that time will be right after you have fired it! Now\n&gt;stop\n&gt; &gt; discussing and do your job!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Melchana reluctantly agreed with her elder brother, but she would\n&gt;never say\n&gt; &gt; it to anyone else. She knew it was necessary to the operation...\n&gt; &gt; She fired and she looked through the monitors. The whole continent\n&gt;was being\n&gt; &gt; technologicized...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Now, Melchana, fire the reformatting cannon...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She fired the gun once again. This time, the continent started to\n&gt;reflorish\n&gt; &gt; and it became techno-organic. Australia had become a fusion of\n&gt;organisms and\n&gt; &gt; technology.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Belthassan:\n&gt; &gt; Prepare for atmospherical entry. Gesper, land the Shadow Destiny at\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; Southeast point of Australia and prepare it for deployment.\n&gt;Melchana, track\n&gt; &gt; the Hellgate and send a message to lieutenant Daemos concerning our\n&gt;arrival.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, jettisson the key to vector sigma and fire the\n&gt;reformatting cannon\n&gt; &gt; on it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The key, hit by the ray, started glowing brightly and exploded. Its\n&gt;light\n&gt; &gt; could be seen from many places on the earth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt;http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
