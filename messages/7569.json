The TM3 bot Vulois, still believed to be \n&gt; dead by most, has decided to become an active role again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is time I call upon my three!(He starts sending a personal \n&gt; message):\n&gt; \n&gt; Soundwave, Battera and Cybershark. It is I, Vulois. I am not dead. \n&gt; Infact I am very much alive! I need your help for a new project \nwhich \n&gt; will help bring peace. I know you might not want to come, that&#39;s \nwhat \n&gt; The Matrix said, especially you Cybershark since you love battle, \nbut \n&gt; this is of grave importance. I will not tell you what it is about \nnow \n&gt; because you may not want to join me. If you do, than home in on my \n&gt; signal and come here. Soundwave, I have known you the longest and I \n&gt; know that meeting you was not a coincidence. Battera, I know you \nfeel \n&gt; gulty for letting Terminess and I die, but if that didn&#39;t happen, I \n&gt; would never have been trusted with this mission. Please come, all \nof \n&gt; you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois sits and waits.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; A strange creature has pulled in front of The Cybertronian Fire\n&gt; (That&#39;s the new base, right?) It stares at it for awhile and \nmarveles \n&gt; at it. It turns out that this is no centaur, but the great Maximal \n&gt; warrior Brix.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you ready?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;i&gt;Of course. If I wasn&#39;t ready for what would come after I \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; have helped you. Bronco is under control. Just keep your rage in \n&gt; check and you will be fine.&lt;/i&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thank you, Octociz, for all you have done.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix/Octociz begin their final run towards the ship.\n\n\n"}}
