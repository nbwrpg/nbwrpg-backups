And the battle in the Alliance base has already \nbeen won, by the Alliance, even with split forces.&quot;\n\nHe looks around the battlefield for a second, keeping track of Iron \nRaptor as he does, just in case.\n\n&quot;But there isn&#39;t much more to be achieved at this battle. I will \norder my troops not to fire unless fired upon. I suggest you do the \nsame.&quot;\n\nHe switches his comm to an Alliance frequency. &quot;All Alliance members, \ndo not fire on the Maximals unless they fire at you. Alliance members \ninside the Cybertronian Fire, meet up witht he prisoners and escort \nthem out. If you are met with resistance, use deadly force. The \nMaximal commander has agreed to a ceasefire, as most of the \npossibilites of this battle have been exausted.&quot;\n\nNot to mention Maximal reinforcements were here, he adds silently to \nhimself. He looks at Iron Raptor. &quot;Your turn. If your troops keep \nfiring, so will mine.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor heard another voice, her scanners going through her \nsystems \n&gt; and finally coming up that it was FZ.\n&gt; She simply leaned her weight on her one leg and snapped her head \ntowards the \n&gt; sound of jets as he approached, watching every one of his moves as \nhe came \n&gt; to land close by, but keeping her sword in hand just in case.\n&gt; She looked up at the bot as he stood there, slightly feeling small \nfrom his \n&gt; size, but he didn&#39;t intimidate her more then that.\n&gt; Her hair fluttered slightly in the wind but she payed no mind, her \nthoughts \n&gt; on what was going on now. A possable end to the fight.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t we all?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She relaxed and sighed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I&#39;ve alread sent a transmission out to the Maximals to cease \nfire, if they \n&gt; do as they&#39;re told then you can get you men back. Provided that you \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; just turn around and start firing at us again.\n&gt; We have more important things to do then fight, like repair the \ndamage to \n&gt; our ship and so on. You have a battle at your own base to deal \nwith, so I \n&gt; don&#39;t think you need this fight too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor shifted her weight onto the other leg*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s been a long day for all of us. Enough is enough. As soon as \nthe \n&gt; Maximals cease, we&#39;ll start. How does that sound?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She waited calmly for his answer, just wanting everything to get \ndone and \n&gt; over with. But her stance was still broad shouldered and straight, \ngiving no \n&gt; sight to any weakness, but her voice was not firm, but normal.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
