Canada \nwill get worse as the NAFTA agreement gets older (as I said before). \nAs soon as the NAFTA agreement took affect, canada dropped like 2 \nplaces to 6th or something (note: USA is even lower).\n\nHedge, you&#39;ll never be able to convince any knowing Canadian that the \nUSA is better, or that Canada is better off with the USA. I will \nadmit, however, that the USA is a rich-b*tch country where anyone who \nhas money has a 50-50 chance of making it. Pretty terrible \nconsidering that 45% of the US population are poor.\n\nFinally, enough of these irritating OOC&#39;s! Yes, some of them may be \ninteresting, but everyone here has a private email that they can use, \nso use it! If worse comes to worse, council will be forced to \nmoderate people for taking up board space, and messing up those with \n14.4 modems and such. =P\n\nTRY TO RESTRAIN THOSE OOC POSTING TENDANCIES!\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Actually, rAuq has already landed the Autobot ship.
