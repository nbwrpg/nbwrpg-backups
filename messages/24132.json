He kisses Iron Raptor.\n\n-Be careful, love. These new bodies don&#39;t make us invincible,- Prowl \nsays while swooping down toward the ground and dropping Iron Raptor \noff. They were now several hundred yards away from the Cybertronian \nFire. -And if you need help, just think to me, I&#39;ll be there for you.-\n\nPicking a target, Prowl straightens his wings, flying at FZ, who he \nthought was Zardus.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ smiles, looking at the Cybertronian Fire as shots penetrate the \nshield. The Maximals didn&#39;t look like they stood much of a chance \nanymore.\n\n&quot;Hey, Zardus!&quot;\n\nFZ spins around in time to see several oncoming laser shots, which \nsend him flying backwards when they hit. FZ growls, his jetpack \nsending him upward and avoiding Prowl as the Maximal flies by.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll pay for that, Maximal,&quot; FZ growls to Prowl, firing a glowing \nmissile at the Maximal. Prowl turns to avoid it, the missile turning \nto follow him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecklessa yelps in surprise as several shots hit her in the back.

Deciding to kill a few \nbots, he aims at Torca, firing several laser shots and ducking under \nautogun fire.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox flies into the air, firing off two dozen laser bolts at Ratchet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight takes out her tranquilizer gun, firing three darts at Orion.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGriplash takes out his missile launcher, aiming at Hot Rod but then \nhearing Unitron&#39;s yell. He really didn&#39;t wanna piss that bot off.\n\nGriplash aims and fires at Angel Prime instead.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing Prowl enter the battle, Perndabot smiles and powers his \njetpack, flying up toward the Maximal.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRepressor launches himself into the air, an EMP shot disabling his \nleft leg.
