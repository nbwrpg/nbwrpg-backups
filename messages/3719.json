Looking around he smiled.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you go ask \nany of them!&quot; he yelled, pointing to Hell Beast and his minions who had \nrecently arrived on the battle scene.  Raising his launcher, he fired a \npowerful plasma blast off at the middle of Hell Beast and his group, yelling \nlike a mad man.\n\n"}}
