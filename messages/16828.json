We are too deep in the mountain. There attacks will not hurt\n&gt; us, they will only skim the mountain. It would take months to reach\n&gt; the tunnels. And if they try to come in and attack, they will get\n&gt; lost in the tunnels and wander the mountain forever. Come you three,\n&gt; we are almost at the main base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois kept walking.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
