He soars back up into the air.  \n&quot;Windlord, why don&#39;t you take them to the new Nightlight to the new base \nalong with Trinity, Zeni, and Termitron.  I&#39;ll go low and pick up Perplex, \nGramps, and Land Mine to check it out.  You can follow the signal back and \nlead us to the base when you&#39;re done.  And who knows we may get some more \ncompany.&quot;  He scans for Gramps and Perplex.  Gramps is moving faster so he \nlands a short distance in front of him.  &quot;Hop on there&#39;s no time to explain \nbut we&#39;re going on a rescue mission.&quot;\n\n"}}
