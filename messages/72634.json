Don&#39;t worry Lord Elder, I know we can pull it off,\n&gt; we&#39;ve been through worse.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;I know you will. I have every confidence in you.&quot; Came LORD ELDER&#39;s\nreply over the comlinks. &quot;Pay attention to Polar Claw, he has been\ndoing these things for longer than you have been in operation.&quot;\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nOn the bridge LORD ELDER sat in the lonely command chair staring at\nthe viewscreen, his optics dark and thoughtful.\n\nThe doors opened and in walked LEGACY, the Maximal&#39;s temporal\nguardian, and all around engieneer, scientist and historian. With a\ncool detatchment his single optic  took in the entire bridge in one\nglance.\n\nBUMP, the Maximal Physicist followed in closely behind, he looking\nmore uncomfortable on the bridge.\n\n&quot;You called for us.&quot; LEGACY said with his usual abruptness.\n\nLORD ELDER turned to rgard them both. &quot;The crew has left to move to\nCrynosis as we discussed.&quot;\n\nLEGACY nodded, although from BUMP&#39;s expression he had no idea of what\nELDER was talking about.\n\n&quot;So now only ourselves and Talon and Elita remain here at the Ark.&quot;\nLEGACY stated matter of factly.\n\nThere was a grim smile from LORD ELDER as he turned back to the\nviewscreen. &quot;Yes. Talon is watching over Elita, but there is nothing\nthat they can do but wait like the rest of us.&quot;\n\n&quot;Silverbolt is still in the infirmery.&quot; BUMP said, &quot;But I don&#39;t know\nwhen he will awaken.&quot;\n\nELDER turned to look at the both of them again, &quot;That is what I wanted\nto let you know. The group of us. We are all that&#39;s left to mind the\nstore.&quot;\n\nLEGACY looked at him with a curious expression.\n\nLORDE ELDER chuckled, &quot;With all your knowledge you don&#39;t know that\nEarth idiom.&quot; He waved a hand at him as he turned back to the\nviewscreen as it depicted the shuttle disapearing out of view. &quot;I will\nhave to explain it to you sometime.&quot;\n\n((End of thread - TBC in &quot;Frigid callings))\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
