Rhesus is\n  &gt; sittin=\r\ng at a desk with his\n  &gt; back to them. He is leaning over some circuits\n  &gt;=\r\n examining them. Mustex has his\n  &gt; hands behind his back and is wearing hi=\r\ns poker face.\n  &gt; He knows the following\n  &gt; conversation will be a simple =\r\nmatter of wearing down\n  &gt; Rhesus who is completely\n  &gt; oblivious to them.\n=\r\n  &gt; Mustex:Rhesus!\n  &gt; Rhesus jumps.

If we were so great then why did I le=\r\nad\n  &gt; us to get ambushed by\n  &gt; the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our first battle. As I =\r\nrecall 5 of\n  &gt; the 7 of us were\n  &gt; damaged beyond repair. Now I see that =\r\nanything except\n  &gt; a 2-way war leads to\n  &gt; extra senseless casulties. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s why I intend to make\n  &gt; everyone pick Maximal\n  &gt; or Predicon. All you=\r\n can think about is revenge on the\n  &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot;,and the\n  &gt; rebirth of a =\r\nlost cause.

So,we can final=\r\nly get revenge for Croctas,\n  &gt; Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, and\n  &gt; my lovely =\r\nMonkessa.

He activates\n  &gt; the D.N.A=\r\n. simulator. The drone takes on his\n  &gt; appearance. He is positioned 500\n  =\r\n&gt; yards from the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk\n  &gt; an attack unles=\r\ns he\n  &gt; gets closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.\n  &gt; It begin=\r\ns its mission\n  &gt; to plant a device he had built 100 yards from the\n  &gt; bas=\r\ne, 40 feet under. When\n  &gt; his monitor says the drone is done he calls out =\r\nthe\n  &gt; code that will activate\n  &gt; the drones programming.\n  &gt; Mustex:Beas=\r\nt Mode!\n  &gt; Mustex turns on his jammer and attaches it to his\n  &gt; belt. The=\r\n drone begins\n  &gt; transmitting a Maximal frequency,goes to Beast\n  &gt; Mode,a=\r\nnd bounds for the base.\n  &gt; Mustex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be s=\r\npotted.\n  &gt; The auto-guns begin\n  &gt; firing, but no transformers come out. T=\r\nhe horse jumps\n  &gt; away from every shot.\n  &gt; He stops at 100 yards away.\n  =\r\n&gt; Drone:Mustex Maximize!\n  &gt; The drone transforms and begins firing arrows =\r\nat the\n  &gt; shield of the base. He\n  &gt; dodges all the beams,but only has eno=\r\nugh power at this\n  &gt; kind of level for 15\n  &gt; minutes. Fortunately,he does=\r\nn&#39;t need that long. The\n  &gt; main turrets fireand take\n  &gt; him out. The shie=\r\nlds flicker from power loss,but stay\n  &gt; intact. Mustex then\n  &gt; smiles whe=\r\nn his monitor shows the pocket sized drone\n  &gt; the pocket sized drone\n  &gt; h=\r\nas reached the surface. He activates the device and\n  &gt; it transmites a Max=\r\nimal\n  &gt; frequency. The drone then starts firing. It has enough\n  &gt; power f=\r\nor 6 shots. The\n  &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; is beginning to sweat. The main turret\n  &gt; f=\r\nires again and the shield\n  &gt; goes down. Mustex deactivates th device and c=\r\nharges.\n  &gt; Mustex:Beast Mode!\n  &gt; As he charges he scans the base. The shi=\r\nelds will be\n  &gt; down for the next hour.\n  &gt; It will be down for the next h=\r\nour. It will take him 10\n  &gt; minutes to navigate\n  &gt; the corridors to his d=\r\nestination and 10 minutes to get\n  &gt; back. He will go in\n  &gt; the one way th=\r\ney won&#39;t expect,The Front Door, 10\n  &gt; yards away he transforms.\n  &gt; Mustex=\r\n:Mustex Maximize!\n  &gt; Mustex draws a cyber arrow and blows the door open.\n =\r\n &gt; Using his frequency\n  &gt; jammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He=\r\n walks\n  &gt; into the Energon\n  &gt; storage room. The Energon will magnify the =\r\nexplosion\n  &gt; of the small explosive\n  &gt; he made. He walks over to a comput=\r\ner console and hooks\n  &gt; it up to the\n  &gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; network. If a remote c=\r\nonnection is placed\n  &gt; on it it will blow from\n  &gt; 2 connections to the ne=\r\ntwork. It can detect the\n  &gt; Energon and will blow if much\n  &gt; is removed. =\r\nIt can detect the energon in the room and\n  &gt; will blow if to much is\n  &gt; r=\r\nemoved. It takes 20 minutes to diffuse and it would\n  &gt; be set for 15. Ther=\r\ne is\n  &gt; no deactivation code. The full blast could probably\n  &gt; not be con=\r\ntained. Even if\n  &gt; the explosive is covered an electronic signal will\n  &gt; =\r\nignite the energon. He set\n  &gt; it and ran out.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; CHECK!

The =\r\ntwo horses run quickly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; over the desert.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Stallex:What&#39;s o=\r\nur next mission.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Yours is in &quot;Training City&quot;. \n  There&#39;s a m=\r\nonkey&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there named Rhesus. He&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an old friend and he \n  can =\r\nteach you about stealth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Stallex:What about you?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:I \n=\r\n  have a plan to take out the &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&#39;s a 1 bot job.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n  Stallex:You know how dangerous that is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Yes but it&#39;=\r\ns even \n  harder for 2 bots to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; infiltrate. I have a shot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; al=\r\none \n  though.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Stallex:O.k., but come back alive. I want to be the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n  one to beat you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; They run off on their way to Egypt.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  2.Mustex and Stallex&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Location:Training City,Egypt&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n  Status:Preparation&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex and Stallex walk into=\r\n a room. \n  Rhesus is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting at a desk with his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; back to th=\r\nem. He is \n  leaning over some circuits&lt;BR&gt;&gt; examining them. Mustex has =\r\nhis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  hands behind his back and is wearing his poker face.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n He knows the \n  following&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conversation will be a simple matter of =\r\nwearing down&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Rhesus who is completely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; oblivious to them.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Mustex:Rhesus!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus jumps. Mustex walks around in fro=\r\nnt of \n  him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Still wasting precious Maximal computer space&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; on \n  your own private&lt;BR&gt;&gt; casino my,my,my. Stallex go start tr=\r\naining \n  with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; drones,Rhesus will be with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you soon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Stallex \n  walks out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:Ahh,my good friend. So the &quot;Carnitron=\r\ns&quot; rise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  again. I can hear the cry&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Carnitrons Carnivate&quot;=\r\n. We were the only \n  sensible&lt;BR&gt;&gt; group. We had a simple&lt;BR&gt;&gt; motto=\r\n of &quot;stay alive&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Mustex:Shutup! If we were so great then why di=\r\nd I lead&lt;BR&gt;&gt; us to get \n  ambushed by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &quot;Alliance&quot; for our fi=\r\nrst battle. As I recall 5 \n  of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the 7 of us were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; damaged be=\r\nyond repair. Now I see that \n  anything except&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a 2-way war leads to=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; extra senseless \n  casulties. That&#39;s why I intend to make&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\neveryone pick Maximal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  or Predicon. All you can think about is re=\r\nvenge on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Alliance&quot;,and \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rebirth of a lost cause.=\r\n All I want is these parts and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a \n  transport.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex hands=\r\n Rhesus a paper. Rhesus looks upset as \n  he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reads it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhes=\r\nus:Where am I going to get a D.N.A. \n  simulator.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:You&#39;re a b=\r\nigger fool than I thought if you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  think I don&#39;t know where&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Fox Fingers got his.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:Even so \n  it will take me several we=\r\neks, but pay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; could speed me up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Mustex:Did I mention I&#39;m=\r\n planning to take out the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Iron Fist&quot; the \n  Alliance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; will =\r\nbe permantly crippled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:Well in that case \n  just let me step=\r\n into the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; next toom to get what you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; need. \n  So,we can fina=\r\nlly get revenge for Croctas,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kangato, Tigecs, Socrow, \n  and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; my lovely Monkessa. I&#39;ve just finished about half a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dozen \n  spec=\r\nial&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hover-cycles. They should do fine for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Oh, \n=\r\n  and by the way I told my son you&#39;d train&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:Smal=\r\nl \n  price to pay. Does he know about the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Carnitrons&quot; yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  Mustex:Not a clue.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t snich &#39;till you c=\r\nome \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; your senses.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus hands Mustex a large box of p=\r\narts and \n  walks&lt;BR&gt;&gt; away to train Stallex.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3.Mustex&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n  Location:Training City,Egypt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Status:Traveling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n =\r\n Destination:Alliance Island,Spain&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ETA:5 hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  =\r\nRhesus:Come back alive. You know I can&#39;t restart the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Carnitrons&quot; \n=\r\n  without&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:You&#39;re not going to resart them with =\r\nor \n  without&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rhesus:I&#39;ll take good care of the kid... =\r\nUh,that \n  is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; until you get back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:bye&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex=\r\n jumps onto \n  his waiting hover-cycle and races&lt;BR&gt;&gt; off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n  4.Mustex&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Location:Alliance Island, Spain&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Status:I=\r\nnfiltration&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex looks at the newly completed drone \n  i=\r\nn front of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him. He activates&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the D.N.A. simulator. The dron=\r\ne \n  takes on his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; appearance. He is positioned 500&lt;BR&gt;&gt; yards fr=\r\nom the \n  &quot;Iron Fist&quot; so the Alliance won&#39;t risk&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an attack unless h=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  gets closer. He activates another pocket sized drone.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nIt begins its \n  mission&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to plant a device he had built 100 yards f=\r\nrom the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  base, 40 feet under. When&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his monitor says the d=\r\nrone is done he calls \n  out the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; code that will activate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\ne drones \n  programming.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Beast Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex turns on=\r\n his jammer and \n  attaches it to his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; belt. The drone begins&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; transmitting a \n  Maximal frequency,goes to Beast&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mode,and bounds=\r\n for the base.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Mustex keeps low to the ground so he won&#39;t be spo=\r\ntted.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The auto-guns \n  begin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; firing, but no transformers co=\r\nme out. The horse jumps&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  away from every shot.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He stops a=\r\nt 100 yards away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Drone:Mustex \n  Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The drone trans=\r\nforms and begins firing arrows at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  shield of the base. He&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; dodges all the beams,but only has enough power \n  at this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind=\r\n of level for 15&lt;BR&gt;&gt; minutes. Fortunately,he doesn&#39;t \n  need that long.=\r\n The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; main turrets fireand take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him out. The \n  shields flic=\r\nker from power loss,but stay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intact. Mustex then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  smiles =\r\nwhen his monitor shows the pocket sized drone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the pocket sized \n  d=\r\nrone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; has reached the surface. He activates the device and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i=\r\nt \n  transmites a Maximal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; frequency. The drone then starts firing. =\r\nIt has \n  enough&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power for 6 shots. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; is begin=\r\nning to \n  sweat. The main turret&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fires again and the shield&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; goes down. \n  Mustex deactivates th device and charges.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Be=\r\nast Mode!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  As he charges he scans the base. The shields will be&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; down for the next \n  hour.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It will be down for the next hour=\r\n. It will take him 10&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  minutes to navigate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the corridors =\r\nto his destination and 10 minutes to \n  get&lt;BR&gt;&gt; back. He will go in&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; the one way they won&#39;t expect,The \n  Front Door, 10&lt;BR&gt;&gt; yards away=\r\n he transforms.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex:Mustex \n  Maximize!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mustex draws a c=\r\nyber arrow and blows the door open.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Using his frequency&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\njammer as cover he sneaks to his destination. He \n  walks&lt;BR&gt;&gt; into the =\r\nEnergon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; storage room. The Energon will magnify \n  the explosion&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; of the small explosive&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he made. He walks over to \n  a computer=\r\n console and hooks&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it up to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Alliance&quot; network. \n  If a=\r\n remote connection is placed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on it it will blow from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2 \n  c=\r\nonnections to the network. It can detect the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Energon and will blow =\r\nif \n  much&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is removed. It can detect the energon in the room and&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n  will blow if to much is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; removed. It takes 20 minutes to di=\r\nffuse and it \n  would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; be set for 15. There is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; no deactivati=\r\non code. The full \n  blast could probably&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not be contained. Even if=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the explosive \n  is covered an electronic signal will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; igni=\r\nte the energon. He \n  set&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it and ran out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; CHECK!
