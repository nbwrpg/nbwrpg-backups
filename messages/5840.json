It has transwarp capabilities.&quot;\n    Magmatron took this news in stride, this could be very good for him. &quot;If \nthe Destrocons do not wish to join me then I will return to my plans. All \ndoor open. Close main doors and autoguns online&quot;\n    Everything happened as it should. Magmatron went back to his command \nroom. He sat looking at the blip on the radar screen. &quot;Send a probe.&quot; He \ncommanded the ship. From the entrance the small probe went in search of the \nship, as it came near the cameras turned on.\n    &quot;Well, what have we here? An attack would be pointless against a ship \nthat large, but if I can get inside....Maybe I&#39;ll equip Mantella and Shredder \nwith cloaking devices, and let them have some extras, just in case. Yes, that \nwould work.&quot;\n\n\nSomewhat on topic: Magmatron has a plan for the ship. Wondering what it is? \nStay tuned, same bat time, same bat channel.\n\n"}}
