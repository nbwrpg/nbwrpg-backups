She stopped and landed next to him. &quot;Not home, staying with friends, \nbut not a home.  Home is here in the trees, hunting, finding a companion, \nflying in and out of the trees, playing in the rivers and running on the \nhillsides.  Wakingup to the sounds of the forest.  Here is home.  There is \nbeing with friends who need your help.&quot; She looked at him for a moment \nrealized how she sounded. She knew that she was giving up a lot too.\n&quot;When the war is over, I&#39;m coming back here.&quot;\n\n\n-------Original Message---\nFrom:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\nDate: Fri Jun 30, 2000 8:04pm\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\nHer answer gave him alot to think about. he knew she was sincere, but\non this planet animals didn&#39;t help each other without getting\nsomething back. Is this all his race was,? based on his limited\nknowledge of war and survival Lunarpine knew that one thing is true.\nIn war there are no friends, only interests. If this is true then why\nwas she being so nice?\n\nLunarpine took a quick glance behind him, will his new home be this\nway or is there more to his type of beings than he realized.\n\n&quot;I guess you should call for a ride, Your friends wouldn&#39;t know my\nvoice.&quot;Lets go.....&quot;Lunarpine trembled at the thought of leaving this\nplace for a new life in a strange land,....&quot;Home&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
