Prowl was in the air \ninstead of on the ground. And I realized that once the post was alreadt \nsent. I apologize.\nHowever...you have just commited a mode against my character, Dinobot.\nDinobot&#39;s isn&#39;t unconciouse nor has asked to be lifted, so, there is no \nreason why Firearm should touch him at all.\nI deny this move and it shall not be accepted.)\n\n\n* Dinobot had hit the ground hard after being shot in the side by \nOblitercon, the force of the blast sending him crashing into the trees at \nthe far side of the clearing.\nHe now lay half suspended off of the ground by a particularely soft bush, \nand a few dozen branches...as well as a tree which had toppled over when he \nhad slammed into it&#39;s trunk.\nHe groaned as he lay there, completely sprawled out and in the most extreme \npain he had ever felt in his entire life.\nDinobot caughed to clear his throat of what mech-fluid had worked its way up \nit and opened his optics.\nHe was slightly confused when he was only able to see out of one side, then \nremembering that his other optic had been damaged as well.\nWith a sigh he heaved himself to his feet, but ended up in a kneel, his head \nbowed and his optics clenched in pain.\nThis just wasn&#39;t his day.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
