Her chest wounds were to extensive for her\n&gt;internal healing systems to heal.  She was laying in a puddle of her own\n&gt;mech fluid.  She heard the noise of the predacons storming the ship\n&gt;somewhere in the back of her mind.  She couldn&#39;t hold on any longer.  She\n&gt;slipped away into nothingness.  Her spark joined with the Matrix.\n&gt;\n&gt;Please put Fidgit on the deceased list.\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
