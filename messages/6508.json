Ares scent didn&#39;t seem to be following him. \nThis wolf hoped that the ram was as damagedas he was if not more.\n\nIt was a good thing he&#39;d stayed here for a short time, he could smell \nhis way around to make do.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Inferno731@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sixshot was so surprised that Prowl missed him that he lost \nconsentration and \n&gt; his wing were shot off by ramulus.
