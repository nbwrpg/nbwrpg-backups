He crosses his\n&gt; fingers hoping that it did what he intended it to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Let&#39;s hope we got someth&#39;n .  I wasn&#39;t too close when I deployed it but\n&gt; within range for it ta pick up Dark Rodimus&#39;s IFF.  Even if that over rated\n&gt; hot rod gets his tailpipes outa that mean phase of his, no way I&#39;m gonna\n&gt; trust him anymore. I seriously hope we can retrieve the Matrix and get it\n&gt; outa that backstabber before it&#39;s too late.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere is smile from WING CALIBER as he takes the device and examines\nit for a moment. Then with a nod he presses a few buttons and slides\nit into the recieiving section of his computer console.\n\nWith a few deft movements he activates the final sequence of commands\nand turns to look at the screen . . .\n\nThe screen is black, a single phrase bouncing along the screen reading\n&#39;no signal&#39;.\n\n&quot;Slag.&quot; LEO said out loud before he looked embarrased and glanced at\nNIGHTLIGHT and ELITA. &quot;I meant . . . aw nuts! . . . What happened?&quot;\n\nWING SABER looked at the screen for a moment confusion clearly on his\nface. &quot;The machine was clearly picking up something it had a\nlocation.&quot; he stepped back to the console as he manipulated a few\nother controls. &quot;Let&#39;s see what it recorded.&quot;\n\nThe screen goes from being black to a replay of the scene where DARK\nRODIMUS was facing down SCOURGE, the Sweeps, NIGHTSHIFT and STRAIGHT\nSHOT. The screen got bigger as the minicam approached DARK RODIMUS, in\nthe corner were cordinates indicating where they were at the time.\n\nThen the screen went black, presumably where DARK RODIMUS vanished\nfrom sight and then the screen went black again.\n\n&quot;That didn&#39;t show us much.&quot; LEO said, clearly getting preturbed.\n\n&quot;Patience.&quot; WING CALIBER said as he carefully reran the scene in slow\nmotion. He zipped back the point where DARK RODIMUS vanished and ran\nit again slowly.\n\n&quot;Look!&#39; WING CALIBER said as he pointed at the corner of the screen\nthat showed coordinates.\n\nIn the corner the cordinates changed. One moment they were showing the\ncordinates of where the Dinosaurs had been and the stand off had\noccured. Then for a micro second they showed something else, and then\nwent blank.\n\n&quot;Rewind that.&quot; LEO said, his voice more interested this time.\n\nThe scene backed up second by second until if finally showed the new\ncordinate. &quot;We GOT HIM!&quot; LEO said as he smacked one fist into the\nother.\n\n&quot;Not so fast.&quot; WING CALIBER said. &quot;We only have a partial cordinate.\nBut we can now get close.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
