Curled up next to his abdominal cavity, was a little fox, \nfast asleep.  While on his stay on Earth all those years ago, he \nlearned the Japanese called them Kitsune.  Malice thought, and \nremembered that Camoflage was a fox, and figured this is her.  He \nsmiled, stroked the sleeping kit, and looked over at Wolfblade.  \nAsleep, with Elita sleeping at her side.  He breifly wondered about \nthe baby&#39;s mother.  He hadn&#39;t heard from her in a while.  He laid \nhis head down, and thought about finding Nightlight after sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; \n&gt; She followed Elita&#39;s scent to a door. She pressed the button and \nthe \n&gt; door opened. She sniffed around and saw Elita sleeping next to \n&gt; another femm bot. She turned her little fox head and saw another \nbot \n&gt; in a hammock sleeping as well. She decided, well, if you can&#39;t \nbeat \n&gt; them, join them.  She was very careful and jumped up next to \nMalice. \n&gt; She curled up near his stomach and went to sleep in fox mode. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
