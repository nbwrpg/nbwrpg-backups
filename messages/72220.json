He disappeared almost a century ago. Some thought h=\r\ne\n&gt; had been defeated in some battle, perhaps assasinated by an up and\n&gt; co=\r\nmming Predacon. But yet here he was finally resurfacing after five\n&gt; decade=\r\ns here on old Earth.\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWHEELIE&#39;s files upon MAGMATRON were very li=\r\nmited, almost entirely to gossip.  Along with MAGMATRON and the legendary P=\r\nredacon General GALVATRON, few other could have ever given as many skipped =\r\nbeats to Maximal Fuel Pumps.  Both had been, according to what little infor=\r\nmation WHEELIE had ever heard, listing as missing, dead, or exterminated.  =\r\nBut if MAGMATRON had shown himself here, then what of the otehr?\n\nOOC - Not=\r\n sure if the Beast Wars II character GALVATRON has shown up here, but it se=\r\nemed appropriate to reference him in the same thought bubble as MAGMATRON. =\r\n Otherwise, either way it can be WHEELIE just being vastly unfamiliar with =\r\nboth and going by gossip, and not having personal experience with eitehr - =\r\nthey could have both been dead millenia for all he knew. ;)\n\n\n\n&lt;OLD - UNUS&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a nod from UNUS, &quot;It is not your fault.&quot; he said solemly.\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;But that which does not terminate us only gives us strength.&quot; There\n&gt; wa=\r\ns a quiet dignity in him as he moved. For some reason, even though\n&gt; he was=\r\n the same body design and structure as the rest he was larger\n&gt; and robust,=\r\n his armor a bit thicker from the look of it. His movements\n&gt; were one of a=\r\n soldier, long used to the art of war, much like the\n&gt; others who walked wi=\r\nth them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We have not learned much from your friend.&quot; FIREHORN said as=\r\n they\n&gt; walked, his words more gruff and clipped. &quot;But he seemed to be be m=\r\nade\n&gt; of sturdy material. &quot;He came in heavilly wounded and yet he was still=\r\n\n&gt; able to talk, even if just a little.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ASTRA nodded, &quot;It was Firehor=\r\nn who found him.&quot; She said. &quot;We brought him here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They stopped at a d=\r\noor with medical syumbology recognizable on it. At\n&gt; UNUS&#39; gesture the door=\r\n slid open.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inside was a very spartan room. The walls were plain and u=\r\nlitarian,\n&gt; painted a single offwhite color. There was a small console on o=\r\nne side\n&gt; presumably for the medical staff to use. There was a small viewsc=\r\nreen,\n&gt; a single recharging chamber and medical bed.\n&gt; \n&gt; However on the be=\r\nd was a single figure, his optics dull but definitely\n&gt; online as he focuse=\r\nd on WHEELIE. &quot;I thought it would be Tuscon coming\n&gt; for me.&quot; he said grogg=\r\nilly as if he had just come out of a long sleep.\n&gt; &quot;But I am glad it is you=\r\n.&quot; His voice clearing as he spoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; He sat up on the medbed, painted in=\r\n oranges, reds and golds he was the\n&gt; picture of leadership and yet even wh=\r\nen recovering there was still a\n&gt; power within him, an energy or fire that =\r\ncould not wholly quenched.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was RODIMUS PRIME.\n\n&lt;NEW - WHEELIE&gt;\n\nAt =\r\nthis point, there was a confused..  Blink from WHEELIE.  Speaking quietly, =\r\n&quot;What is this, what have we here?  How have you come to be without cheer?&quot;\n=\r\n\nGlancing over RODIMUS, his old friend seemingly aged for the damage he had=\r\n taken like KUP to WHEELIE&#39;s sensors, body seeming partially faded, even th=\r\nough the glow was still omnipresent.\n\n&quot;What has happened here, and what is =\r\ngoing on?  You looked like you were at the bottom fo the foot, stomped on b=\r\ny Trypticon.&quot;\n\nPausing and then continuing, &quot;Now, I am gald you are here, b=\r\nut a few things we have to know..  Something very wrong is in this area, an=\r\nd out of it we will have to go.  We cannot speak, we cannot sense, we canno=\r\nt call afar.  It is as if we are cut off from existence here, like webbed u=\r\np in a separate jar.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
