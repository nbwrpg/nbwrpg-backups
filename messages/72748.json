However it was obvious as he pulled the trigger he\ntoo was having thoughts in the same direction.\n\nThe other FUZORS began following suit!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks up at Cyclonus with sarcasm.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; STAND BACK GUYS, I GOT THIS!  OH YEAH PAL!?  TAKE THIS!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his rump on Cyclonus and blasts a noxious fume into the sky in his\n&gt; direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hopefully this will knock him out long enough ta figure out who put the\n&gt; bug on him.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Maybe!&quot; TORCA said as he looked upwards. &quot;Look!&quot;\n\nUp above the shots from the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS were firing up\nskies! While the seekers above moved to avoid the shots, the sweeps\nand CYCLONUS made no effort at all.\n\nIn fact the shots from the those on the ground, rather than hitting\nthem appeared to be passing through them. The cloud from QUICKSTRIDE\nseemed to have a similar affect. It rose up from the ground and\nquickly dissipated. However even the dispersed cloud seemed to move\nthrough the sweeps without affect.\n\nMeanwhile HYDRAS heard a voice behind him, &quot;It is time.&quot; and then\nHYDRAS&#39; world went black!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
