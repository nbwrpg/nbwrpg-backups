I can use the \nmouse with my\n&gt; good hand, but its kinda impossible to type well (this post has \ntaken like 4\n&gt; mins already), so I think I&#39;m out till I get the cast off. \nHopefully the\n&gt; bones will heal soon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
