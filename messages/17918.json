Her exhaustion was getting to her. She \nyawned and rubbed her eyes. &quot;No.  Inferno went there to fight.  Then \nshortly there after, Waspinator showed up shortly after the clone was \nkilled. Something isn&#39;t right. I want to wait and see what happens. \nSince this was a clone that means the real Megatron is still alive \nsomewhere. I want to see if he will show himself again. He wants me \ndead.  So I have a feeling he will appear again to us.&quot;\n\nBattera::\nShe looked down and saw Vulios standing in the cave. She smiled. He \nhad not showed any sign of spotting her.  It gave her the advantage.  \nWith the cave and it&#39;s accoustics, she cold throw her voice and not \ngive her position away.  She yelled out, &quot;I know where I have come \nfrom. I know where you came from as well.  But you expect me to help \nyou after all that I have gone through?&quot; she paused and thought if \nwhether or not he would go away if she andwered his question. Then \nshe decided that she wasn&#39;t in the mood to talk. Her cheek still hurt.\n&quot;No. Go away.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream walked into Destructor&#39;s base, looking around.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, this is where we&#39;ll be staying for a bit. Cool, but I really \n&gt; want to get my hands on Megatron.&quot; He walked over to KitKat. &quot;Let \nme \n&gt; and Drillbit go on a mission and bring Inferno back here. I&#39;m sure \nhe \n&gt; knows the real wherabouts of that virus. I can make him talk.&quot; He \n&gt; smiled evily.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; They started walking back to the Ark with everyone, hoping they \ncould \n&gt; forget about the Trainers and install the things they worked so \nhard \n&gt; to get.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois saw Battera try to lose him in the caverns. Not so fast, Bat-\n&gt; girl. The Crimson Scavenger wants to have a few words with you. He \n&gt; follows her with some dificulty, clipping his wing on that sharp \n&gt; turn. He loses control of a second, but balanes himself and \nattempts \n&gt; to catch up. He sees her enter a cave, but when he goes in he can&#39;t \n&gt; see her any where. He cries out.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yo, Bat-Girl! Listen, I&#39;m sorry about earlier. I was angry because \nI \n&gt; don&#39;t like sarcasm. By what I know, I think you&#39;re in the same \n&gt; position as me. Only I think you have some idea of where you came \n&gt; from before you joined the Alliance. I had....a flashback, I guess \n&gt; you could call it. It had you in it, and you were crying, and I was \n&gt; happy for you, and I don&#39;t UNDERSTAND IT!&quot; Vulois sat down, \n&gt; frustrated, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just, I think you may know something, \n&gt; and I really want to clear this up. So, before all of this, did I \n&gt; know you somewhere? Doing something?&quot; He prayed she had the answer.\n\n\n"}}
