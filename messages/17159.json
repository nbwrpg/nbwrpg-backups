Unitron rasied both \nweapons to point at Hot Rod&#39;s head, but the female stepped out.  Unitron \nignored her, and was about to pull the triggers, even though she was in front \nof his weapons, but he stopped and frowned when Zardus stepped in between him \nand Hot Rod.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t have anything to do with this!&quot; Scattershot yelled, trying to hid \nhis automatic rifle behind his back.  &quot;I...was trying to break it up!  Yeah, \nthat&#39;s the ticket.  I was breaking it up!&quot;\n\n&quot;I was merely watching out of amusement.&quot; Nemesis Enforcer said with a smile \nas he lowered his weapon, the rapid-firing laser rifle disappearing into \nsubsapce.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a new recruit?  Heh.  He may have a new paint job, but if he&#39;s crazy \nenough to think he&#39;s Hot Rod, he&#39;s not one to trust.  I warn you Zardus, \ndon&#39;t trust him with anything, and I mean ANYTHING important until he&#39;s \neither killed another Maximal or brought us vital information.  And even \nthen, I wouldn&#39;t trust him.&quot; Unitron said, turning and walking off towards \nhis quarters, his rifles disappearing into his private subspace pocket.\n\nNemesis Enforcer watched Zardus leave, and headed for the Alliance bridge, \nkeeping his optics on the two autoguns that had extended from the ceiling.\n\nScattershot transformed to his bald eagle mode and flew after Nemesis.\n\n"}}
