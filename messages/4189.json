About a few \nmomments later, the computer detects something strange. Ultra Optimus \nstops the scan, and queries the computer on the object. The computer \nidentifies it as the  old, Autobot Ark. Ultra Optimus remarks that \nthis is getting interesting, and decides to investigate the Ark. The \nheads out of the ship, and Transforms into a Missle Frigate(AKA \nMissile Bomber). He heads out to the Ark&#39;s supposed coordinates.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; (Icedemon...no offense, but do you pay any attention when you \nread?  \n&gt; Shockwave is in a huge forest deep under the cover of a canopy of \nbranches \n&gt; and leaves.
