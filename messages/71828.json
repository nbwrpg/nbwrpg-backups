He puts his feet down firmly as he stands beside his sister and =\r\nRattrap.  If not in voice, he shows it in posture and body language.\n\n&quot; For=\r\n every action there is a reaction.  Perhaps you missed Wheelie&#39;s snide rema=\r\nrk to Rattrap and my sister&#39;s efforts to defend him.  YOU WILL NOT COME IN =\r\nBETWEEN MY SISTER LEO!  THATS AN ORDER!&quot;\n\nRattrap and Straight Shot freeze =\r\nin shock.  No one had ever yelled at Leo Prime.  Not even Tucson, who was n=\r\now clearly in an unstable temperament.\n\n&quot; That is so not like him, well he&#39;=\r\ns short tempered but not that short tempered.&quot;\n\nRattrap nods.\n\n&quot; Yeah no on=\r\nes ever raised their voice at Leo, not like that.  Something is bothering h=\r\nim big time.  Or maybe it&#39;s a dragon thing.  Look at Hydras, he&#39;s got a tem=\r\nper too.&quot;\n\nTucson paces the floor.  It was clear there was more to his mood=\r\n than meets the eye.  So much so that he returns to his beast mode, snappin=\r\ng his tail angrily, with a bit of a snarl.\n\n&quot; Let me remind you that before=\r\n you were chosen as a leader, I was chosen first.  And I will not be underm=\r\nined by anyone.  And if I wish to wait and allow Elita the freedom of choic=\r\ne then so be it.  If she choses not to then that is her choice and I will h=\r\nonor it willingly.  She has a voice and it deserves to be heard, not just s=\r\nhoved in a corner and put to rest.  I will not tolerate prohibition of free=\r\ndom nor the right to defend one&#39;s self accordingly.  Am I understood!?&quot;\n\nHe=\r\n slams his tail down hard enough for the floor to shake.\n\nPerpetually on th=\r\ne move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 21, 2011, at 10:08 PM, Super Cyclonus =\r\n&lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; You=\r\n&#39;re right, Windlord, she is but maybe we should hear what she has to\n&gt;&gt; say=\r\n.
