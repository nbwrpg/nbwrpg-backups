He wasn&#39;t a bot for\n&gt; &gt; speed or that much endurance. He could follow a bot for miles following\n&gt; &gt; their tracks and their signatures, but running after them wasn&#39;t such a\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; idea. He was just too worried that Stingtra would just get herself into\n&gt; &gt; trouble again. Then it would be his hide Megatron would have.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He coughed and looked around, searching for the sight of Stingtra. He\nknew\n&gt; &gt; she was around, sensing her signature near-by.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Stingtra?&quot; A part of him told him go back to the cave and leave her the\n&gt; &gt; Inferno alone. If she choose to hurt herself, it was her fault.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But he had a thing for females.\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5530/13/_/_/_/963057138/\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Make new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5530/13/_/_/_/963089254/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
