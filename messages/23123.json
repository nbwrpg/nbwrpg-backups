He soars back up into \nthe air.  \n&gt; &quot;Windlord, why don&#39;t you take them to the new Nightlight to the new \nbase \n&gt; along with Trinity, Zeni, and Termitron.  I&#39;ll go low and pick up \nPerplex, \n&gt; Gramps, and Land Mine to check it out.  You can follow the signal \nback and \n&gt; lead us to the base when you&#39;re done.  And who knows we may get \nsome more \n&gt; company.&quot;  He scans for Gramps and Perplex.  Gramps is moving \nfaster so he \n&gt; lands a short distance in front of him.  &quot;Hop on there&#39;s no time to \nexplain \n&gt; but we&#39;re going on a rescue mission.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
