She lashed out with her claws and slashed at\n&gt; his face.  She extended her claws and slashed at Beholder&#39;s face and\n&gt; chest, trying to scratch out his optics, scratch his face and do as\n&gt; much damage as possable.  &quot;I GO AND YOU GO WITH ME!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; Being within inches of Beholder, she started her self destruct\n&gt; sequence counting down.  5..4..3..2..1..KABOOOOOOMMM!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
