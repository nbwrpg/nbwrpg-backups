He \nimmediately closed them quickly, with a pain behind his optics. He \ngrimaced.\n\n&quot;T&#39; be honest,&quot; he said. &quot;Ah feel like--&quot; He opened his optics again. \nMegatron. He frowned, then looked around. He wasn&#39;t in the base. &quot;How \nah get here?&quot; with a sharp tone. Despite being repaired in the CR \ntank, something still wasn&#39;t quite right.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Megatron shook his head. &quot;Actually, I think talking to him \nover \n&gt; communications would be better. Were a little steamed right now and \nI wouldnt \n&gt; want you or Rampage to acidentally kill one of the Rebels.&quot; And \nthen \n&gt; proceeded over to the communications array.\n&gt;        &quot;Contact Killfest and talk about our main focus...The \nMaximals and \n&gt; Allience. We are not taking about alligning or a peace treaty. I am \nnot going \n&gt; to help them, and I know they wont help us. Discuss with him the \nmain agenda, \n&gt; and that by fuding with ourselfs wont get us anywhere.&quot; And then \ncontinued, \n&gt; &quot;If I talk to him it would just anger him, and besides, Im far to \nfurious at \n&gt; him at the moment. Got that? Yes.&quot;\n&gt;        Turning on his heel he came over to Quickstrike, &quot;And how \nare you \n&gt; feeling?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;        Hell Beast and Gremlin rested for a moment on the banks of a \nlarge \n&gt; lake. It was surrounded by trees on all sides, and across from them \nthey \n&gt; could see a small human village and a few fishing ships in the \nlake. He \n&gt; assumed this was thier main hunting and gathering grounds. A long \ntime ago he \n&gt; would have captured them and pumped them full of liquid energon, \nmade them \n&gt; into soldiers to crush his foes. But that was a long time ago....\n&gt;        &quot;So, are we leaving or not?&quot; Gremlin said, still confused on \nthe \n&gt; situation.\n&gt;        Hel lBeast didnt think the split between the Predacons was \nwise, after \n&gt; all, now they were just going to war agianst each other. Meantime, \nthe \n&gt; Maximals would get back on thier feet and the Allience would \ncontinue its \n&gt; expanse. The diplomat needed a group he could trust.\n&gt;        &quot;Personally, I dont know. Megatron is a marked bot, \nKillfest&#39;s team is \n&gt; a group of Rebels who wont attack the Maximals or Allience. For \nnow, Gremlin, \n&gt; it looks like were stuck on this rock. &quot; He shighed. If Megatron \nwould allign \n&gt; with another group....then mabey he could make up his mind. In the \nmean time, \n&gt; he just wanted to sit in the calmness of the surrounding beauty.\n\n\n"}}
