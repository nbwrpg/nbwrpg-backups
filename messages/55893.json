From what I&#39;ve seen, your attitude serves no purpose but to \n&gt; piss bots off. That&#39;s dangerous. You dont need enemies within your \n&gt; own faction. He looks at Blackstorm.

We are \n&gt; transformers, we are more advanced then that. Instead of being \n&gt; programmed like simple computers, we should learn are skills \n&gt; ourselves.
