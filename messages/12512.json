Feline was \n=\r\nsitting in a chair with her knees together and hands sitting \nnervously in =\r\nher lap.  &quot;Please to meet you Iron Raptor. I&#39;m Feline.&quot;  \nShe looked at her=\r\n hands.  &quot;You wanted to know how I came here? By the \nblessing of the blesi=\r\nng of the Matrix is how I came here.&quot; She looked \ndowna nd had an expressio=\r\nn of giult and sadness on her face.  &quot;You \nasked me what my function is and=\r\n what I wish to become while I&#39;m \nhere.  I am a Bio-technologist and a figh=\r\ner.&quot; She  looked up at Iron \nRaptor with a little happiness in her eyes.\n&quot;M=\r\ny pod laned in the jungle.  I had just emerged from my pod in this \ncat for=\r\nm.  I looked and saw wonderous plants and and animals around.  \nI think I c=\r\nan try to take one of the plants and... &quot; She smiled \nnervously,&quot;I&#39;m sorry,=\r\n I let myself carry on sometimes when something \ngets interesting. Anyway, =\r\nI was looking around when I was struck from \nbehind. I woke up in the Allie=\r\nnce base.  They wanted to know who I \nwas and whom I followed.  They wanted=\r\n to know who my leader was.  I \ntold them that I had just arrived to the pl=\r\nanet and had no leader \nyet. They didn&#39;t believe me and hit me.&quot; she looked=\r\n down and away \nfrom Iron Raptor.  She got up and walked to the corner of t=\r\nhe room. \n&quot;Because I have a sleek and feline figure they thought I was a pl=\r\nay \ntoy.&quot;  she started to cry.  &quot;They.....I...i had no choice, they said \nt=\r\nhey were going to terminate me if I didn&#39;t let them...&quot; she choked \nand cov=\r\nered her face with both hands.  &quot;I..I couldn&#39;t stop them.&quot;  \nShe fell to he=\r\nr knees and cried. \n\nShe wept for a few moments. &quot;I waited until I saw my c=\r\nhance for \nescape.  I crawled down a small waste hatch and fell to the grou=\r\nnd \noutside.  I was feeling like the filth I was covered in. They came \naft=\r\ner me and I just kept running.  I had to get away. &quot;she started \nchoking ag=\r\nain.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t go back and let them.....again...not \nagain.&quot;  She wept. =\r\n &quot; I wandered around, damaged, having no idea \nwhere I was or where I was g=\r\noing.  I stumbled and found your ship by \nthe grace of the Matrix.  It was =\r\nsheer luck that that I even lived \nlong enough to make it here. &quot; She kept =\r\nher face covered with her \nhands and stayed on her knees crying in the corn=\r\ner. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Iron Raptor &lt;ironraptor13@p...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to be leaving for my sisters on Aug. 19, so I want to\nask \na=\r\n favor of KSL and Logo. Could you two please put Chardate and Feline \non ho=\r\nld until Wednesday? Please? This is a great scene and I want to \ncontinue i=\r\nt myself, without having to lend Iron Raptor out to anyone.\n&gt; It would be r=\r\neally nice of you both if you did that for me, but \nonly if you want to.\n&gt; =\r\nBesides, that would also mean that I owed you both a favor, and I \ndo pay t=\r\nhem back richly.\n&gt; Thank You.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor smiled and shook Charda=\r\ntes hand firmly, him probably \nnot knowing that there was more power behind=\r\n that hand he held then \nhe thought.\n&gt; She released his hand but not before=\r\n she gave him a little sample \nof her strength, giving it a little squeeze =\r\nbefore letting go. \nKnowing that she could easily crush that hand of his if=\r\n she so \ndesired, the power or both beast modes making it so she could \nact=\r\nually do so.\n&gt; Her head tilted to the side in thought for a moment, listeni=\r\nng to \nhis question after his greeting.\n&gt; That WAS a good question, one tha=\r\nt she didn&#39;t know the answer\nto.\n&gt; But she would give him the best answer t=\r\nhat she could. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; To say the truth, Chardate. I have no idea where he=\r\n is, or\nhis \nsecond-in-command. But I do intend to find out, and I&#39;ll let y=\r\nou\nknow \nwhen I do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * The truth was that she would ask Prowl where Li=\r\nono was, knowing \nthat he would probably know more then she did at the mome=\r\nnt.\n&gt; But then her smile flashed across her face again and she gestured \nto=\r\nwards the smaller Conference Room, thinking that Feline had waited \nin ther=\r\ne long enough and it was time to get down to work.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked at =\r\nChardate before walking over to the door, \nstopping as it slid open and loo=\r\nking over her shoulder-plate. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You&#39;re welcome to come in if you wan=\r\nt. And if you have\nany \nquestions you would like me to answer, now is the t=\r\nime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * With that she walked into the room, her optics adjusting to th=\r\ne \ndim light of the room as she entered. The door closing behind her but \nr=\r\neady to open in case Chardate would wish to enter.\n&gt; With a quick optic she=\r\n spotted Feline, looking her over again and \nwondering why she seemed so st=\r\nrange to her.\n&gt; It seemed as if she really wasn&#39;t what she seemed, and her\n=\r\nbeast \nmodes were going crazy with warnings directed at her.\n&gt; But, with an=\r\n iron will she pushed them down and approached the cat-\nbot, passing her se=\r\nat and coming to rest standing in front of a holo-\nprojector. She looked ov=\r\ner the piece of equipment for a moment then \nturning her attention to the c=\r\nonsole that lay before her, pulling her \nhands behind her back and keeping =\r\nher optics on the console. Indeed \nthis new ship had many marvels, but she =\r\nwould have time to craze over \nthem later. \n&gt; She had no intention of telli=\r\nng Feline just why she had called her \nhere just yet, wanting to know this =\r\nfembot a little more just before \nher intentions were reviled. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; So,=\r\n more fresh meat to the grinder, huh? Well, the more the \nbetter.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * S=\r\nhe said this into the console, her back set towards Feline with \nher hands =\r\nstill clasped behind her back. But then, slowly and a \nsilent sigh she turn=\r\ned towards the cat-bot, her expression one of \ncalm but also of a firm auth=\r\nority. One that she used a bit too often \nwith new bots. *\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I am Iron=\r\n Raptor, Maximal Commander. If you don&#39;t mind, I\nwould \nlike to ask you a f=\r\new questions since you are new to us.  Mostly of \nwhat your qualifications =\r\nare and what position you strive to achieve \nwhile you&#39;re with us. Standard=\r\n procedure. But first I\nwouldn&#39;t mind \nknowing just how you have managed to=\r\n find us, with such a vast \nexpanse of land all around?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She waited =\r\nfor Felines&#39;s answer, wondering just what this \nfembot&#39;s story was=85and if=\r\n it was believable.\n&gt; With this war going on there was no telling just what=\r\n the enemy \nwould pull to get the advantage, even sending a spy within thei=\r\nr own \norganization to eavesdrop and so on. But it was a clever trick, one =\r\n\nthat was clever enough to be considered.\n&gt; So, Iron Raptor waited to hear =\r\njust what Feline had to say=85and \nwhether or not it was necessary to press=\r\n her splatter gun to her \nforehead or not. *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________=\r\n________________________________\n&gt; Want to make new friends all over the wo=\r\nrld?\n&gt; Visit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n\n"}}
