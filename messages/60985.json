She held up her arm to show her sister a screen.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to check these sensors.  If this screen shows a red \ndiagram, tell me.  It&#39;s a damaged sensor that we&#39;ll have to remove.&quot;\n&gt; She pulled the small screen off and handed it to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; BlackNightmare::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cheer up&quot;said the femme&quot;We will be here everytime you need it... \n&gt; and that move me to tell you, Malice, a warning... to you too, sis&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Malice/ Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The male squeezed Blacknightmare&#39;s hand.
