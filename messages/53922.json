Phoenix has to be taking a huge whale of a \n&gt; beating before she actually screams in pain.  A branding torch \n&gt; doesn&#39;t cut it - no pun intended.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phoenix::\n&gt; \n&gt; The femme doesn&#39;t give them the statisfaction of hearing her scream \n&gt; during the branding, although several pained grunts escape her \n&gt; gritted teeth.  Phoenix knows how to deal with pain, and she \nfocuses \n&gt; on anything but the burning of her own body to bear the torment in \n&gt; relative silence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Heartbreak&#39;s treatment is another matter.  As she lands hard on her \n&gt; back, memories surface of the things Clawful did to her, and \nPhoenix \n&gt; scrambles away, standing up and backing into a corner.  Trembling, \n&gt; the femme tries to calm herself - there&#39;s no way it could be as bad \n&gt; as before, she rationalizes, since HBK doesn&#39;t have claws he could \n&gt; spear her to the floor with for starters.  It doesn&#39;t work - her \nmind \n&gt; keeps superimposing the image of the Rogue berserker over \nHeartbreak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fear grips her spark compartment with an icy hand.  Seemingly in \n&gt; response to the threat, she feels her unstable mutant spark flare \nup \n&gt; and send hot tendrils of energy throughout her body.  Even more \n&gt; terrified of her own poorly understood powers than of anything the \n&gt; nWo might do to her, she tries to suppress the reaction to no avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first external indication that something has gone very wrong is \n&gt; when Phoenix drops to her knees, her arms wrapped around her chest \n&gt; like she&#39;s trying to keep herself from exploding, and that&#39;s not \nfar \n&gt; from the truth.  Strange energy patterns begin sparking across her \n&gt; frame.  (Think when the BW characters get energon deep-fried, only \n&gt; the lightning is orange instead of blue.)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&gt; &lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: The sound of Hollywood Narrator typing a post woke up the \n&gt; neighborhood. People called the cops.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arrow had watched the events with indifference. He had certain \nlaws \n&gt; he abided by. His own twisted laws. One of those was not to \nquestion \n&gt; what his fellow bot did. And he hadn&#39;t done so, yet. Back in his \ndays \n&gt; with the Radicons, when he had received the lobotomy from the \nleader \n&gt; of the group, Kracken, he still never questioned any orders or \n&gt; actions. When a comrade made a mistake, he would let it play out, \nand \n&gt; when an enemy made a mistake, he would take quick action and harm \n&gt; them quickly and efficiently. Sneaky kills were obviously not \nagainst \n&gt; his law, as he recalls right at the moment how he had ripped the \n&gt; spark from the body of the very child he had cared for in the \n&gt; Chivtrons. He considered it a merciful act.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deemos, meanwhile, was quite shocked by the events. He thought it \n&gt; was disgusting and inappropriate. This was hypocrisy, as Deemos was \n&gt; the one who had sliced a team member to bits just for not doing \n&gt; better in battle when Deemos led his own group. He briefly recalls \n&gt; Shokaract co-leading his group and almost becomes glad, for some \n&gt; unknown reason, but then puts his attention back on the events at \n&gt; hand. His optics lit up brightly when Heartbreak had kissed Phoenix \n&gt; and thrown her down. He knew the previous events would be \n&gt; commonplace, but he thought this was going too far. However, this \n&gt; thought came from the guy who had plotted viciously killing his \nwife \n&gt; and son and had succeeded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spider, meanwhile, had the third point of view. He was proud and \n&gt; smiling. He enjoyed everything that went on. He was a rookie bot \nwho \n&gt; was eager for action and any sort of exciting event, no matter what \n&gt; kind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, a couple of STASIS PODS (I&#39;m sick of ships) fall down \non \n&gt; the planet. What will they become? What sides will they be on? Does \n&gt; anyone care?...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: Richard Allen\n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, February 16, 2003 5:09 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Party at nWo base!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   : : Wolfenstein/Razor/Diesel/Heartbreak : :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Wolfenstein gets out of the CR chamber. He had been changed to \n&gt; white and black and now sported the nWo logo. He headed back to the \n&gt; cell block.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Diesel had grown impatient with Hollywood, and got the branding \n&gt; torch himself. He handed it to Razor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   HBK let the forcefield to the cell down and all nWo members \n&gt; steped in for the party.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Heartbreak and Diesel took hold of Phoenix&#39;s arms from behind, \n&gt; holding her in place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Razor activated the torch, with a evil grin on his face. He \n&gt; stepped forward very slowly, surely scaring the femme bot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Razor: Now my dear, you will belong to us. If you... service us \n&gt; you may live. If you refuse, I&#39;ll kill you where you stand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Razor reached out with the torch and began to ingrave letters \n&gt; into the beautiful body of Phoenix. She would surely be screaming \n&gt; from the pain, as the energon flame burnt through her armor, \nmelting \n&gt; pieces of her away. As Razor finished, Phoenix had the nWo logo \n&gt; burned across her chest. She had been branded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   All the boys started to laugh at what they had done. All except \n&gt; Wolfenstein, who looked away. There were almost tears in his eyes. \n&gt; This wasn&#39;t right, she didn&#39;t deserve this. The physical damage \ncould \n&gt; be repaired but mentaly? Could anyone recover from an event like \nthis?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   No time had passed from the branding before Heartbreak took \n&gt; action. He grabbed Phoenix bringing the hot femme to him, roughly. \nHe \n&gt; was grabbing hard, probably hurting her. He kissed her unwilling \n&gt; form, before throwing her down with great force.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Heartbreak: I&#39;m going to like this!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The preceding has been paid for by the\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   New World Order\n\n\n"}}
