But she also knew that \nTeltoli wouldn&#39;t keep quiet about Carnage&#39;s comments.\nWhile they had been together, she had leaned the fuzors personallity rather \nwell.\nShe always did enjoy a good argument.\nThat was another reason why she missed her dead friend, because she could \nnever win against him in that catagory.\nCarnage growled at Teltolis&#39; words.**\n&quot; Well, obviously those times don&#39;t mean slag to you, &#39;cause you left.&quot;\n** Her voice was very calm, the opposit of Teltoli&#39;s.\nShe had to admit, she was a bit emotional, but bringing up the memories of a \ndead friend all afternoon could do that to a bot.\nBut now she had that air about her, which spoke that she was either on the \nverge of attacking something, or that she didn&#39;t give a slag about anything \nanymore.\nCarnage sighed.**\n&quot; You don&#39;t know me verry well, do you?&quot;\n** She was refurring to what Teltoli had said, about the fact that she \ndidn&#39;t seem to care anymore.\nBut the fuzor was indeed wrong.\nShe did. It was just that she always did argue out her points, especially \nwith something that bothered her.\nAnd this bothered her.\nCarnage growled at Teltoli&#39;s next telling, where she almost seemed to mock \nher cold hard self.\nHer eyes narrowed and she stopped, listening to the last of what the cat had \nto say. She crossed her arms.**\n&quot; Teltoli, you abandoned me. Then you come barging back here and expect me \nto forgive you for it.\nWell the answere&#39;s No.&quot;\n** She growled.**\n&quot; I&#39;ve been cheated all my life, so I can obviously say that nothing&#39;s \nchanged. Nothing&#39;s new. Other then the fact that I must still consider you \nsomething of value, otherwise you would be dead like the rest of my \ncheaters.&quot;\n** Carnage brought in a large breath into her lungs, the hint of the \ngathering storm on the wind.\nShe crossed her arms.**\n&quot; From what you told me, and this is what I find so hard to swollow, is that \nyou found a promotion much more important then a friend. You must; after \nall...you left.&quot;\n** Carnage glared down at the cat.**\n&quot; So what does that pretty much say about you? That you&#39;re selfish? That you \ncan&#39;t be trusted? Or do you think that you&#39;re actions were just and it&#39;s \nright to leave a friends trust at the door and leave?\nYou tell me?&quot;\n** Her voice was calm.She wanted to hear her answer.\nTeltoli should know that what she did was wrong, and this was as close \nCarbnage was going to get to giving Teltoli a second chance. It was just up \nto the fuzor to realize and recognize that.\nBut her expression was cold, with no hint of emotion as the reptile waited.\nTeltoli could say that she was weak or whatever she wanted, Carnage didn&#39;t \ncare what she called her, as long as she gave her an answer to her \nquestions.\nThen, maybe from there, the could work something out.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
