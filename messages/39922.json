Until then his only existence was as cells from \nthe\n&gt; transmetal T-Rex Megatron and a large Maximal dragon named \nNecromancer.\n&gt; Since Veratis&#39; past hasn&#39;t really been revealed as to where he got \nthe\n&gt; protoforms he&#39;s been &quot;Improving&quot; (Experimenting on with a mutant \nvirus which\n&gt; removes most signs of a robot form) I&#39;m sure something can be \nworked out,\n&gt; maybe have Stallex attacked by a bot resembling Megaton. A \nresemblance of\n&gt; his former mode might exist through the DNA replication. This could \nopen a\n&gt; rivalry between him and a few bots in the game. (Necromancer, \nVeratis,\n&gt; Megaton, just to name three.)\n&gt; Sound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future temporal \nanomaly\n&gt; will send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young but it \nhasn&#39;t\n&gt; happened to him yet. (If theres anyone who understands temporal \nphysics\n&gt; please explain them to me, I&#39;m getting a headache just thinking \nabout it.)\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 11:32 AM\n&gt; Subject: angry\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stallex had improved,but his dad was furious and figting harder \nthan\n&gt; &gt; ever so Stallex was being crushed. Not only had Mustex&#39;s plan to\n&gt; &gt; destroy the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; failed, but his ulterior motives to test \nhis\n&gt; &gt; strength against Zardus before taking on Megaton(who with \npermission\n&gt; &gt; from the owner once attacked Stallex when he was a baby realising \nthe\n&gt; &gt; advantages of a development period could prove dangerous so will\n&gt; &gt; whoever owns him please give me permission for that) had also \nfailed\n&gt; &gt; when he never saw Zardus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
