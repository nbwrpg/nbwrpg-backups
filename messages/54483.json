Thanx! Bic: Tyrael landed in the \n&gt;small hatch on the side of the Tripredacus Warship and went straight \n&gt;to the CR chambers and the medbay. Tyrael: Prometheus, Destructor, \n&gt;please follow me. We&#39;ll get them to CR then plan our next moves. (He \n&gt;opened a comm with Darkangel) Darkangel, are you trained in any form \n&gt;of medical interventions? He enters the room and places Dreadplague&#39;s \n&gt;pain-twisted body on a table. He was worried by the harpoon still \n&gt;deeply anchored in her body and did not dare to remove it. He knew it \n&gt;had to be out before she went in a CR or she would have disastrous \n&gt;side effects after. Tyrael: Do any of you know something in medical \n&gt;interventions? \n\n\n"}}
