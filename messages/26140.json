It was soft and pale peach. These people&#39;s \nskin was all colors.\nD had never seen a sky before, or an ocean or anything that would exist on a \nplanet. But that&#39;s what happened when a being was born and raised on a \nstartship all of their life.\nHis nose smelled things that were both pleasent and foul, it traveling less \nthen an inch off the ground as it went along.\nD flinched as Fenox(sp) touched his shoulder, his head snapping towards her, \nhis ears still flat against his head. The hair along his neck had stoiod up \nfor a moment or two but settled down, just surprised.\nShe was the first person he had seen and felt a slight tie to her, like some \nlife line to hold onto while drowning in the events of a strange world.\nD shifted on his fromt limbs, his hands/paws shifting the dirt slightly. He \nlooked at the ground and then back at her, then did it again. Searching for \nsomething of his limited speech to say that might communicate his \npuzzlement.\nHe wanted to learn as much as he could about this place, as well as finding \nout just what had happened to the ship and people he was with less then a \nday ago.\nD whined. What words to use?*\n\n&quot; No know.&quot;\n\n* That wasn&#39;t the answer to Fenox&#39;s question. He was saying that he didn&#39;t \nknow where he was, so he wanted someone to tell him. But with words like \nthat people could have a hard time trying to understand him.\nBut...maybe he could go at it another way? With more understandable words.*\n\n&quot; No know where is.&quot;\n\n* That was as close to, &quot; I don&#39;t know where I am,&quot; as he was going to get. \nBut he just hoped that she could understand.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
