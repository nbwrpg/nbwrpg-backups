Rampage was hit more than Hell Beast, but\n&gt; the giant crab pointed \n&gt; upward with his tricanon and fired at Magnus.\n&gt; \n&gt;        Tarantulas saw the shields shatter. And what\n&gt; a beautiful sight it was. \n&gt; However, the Maximals were right. The Element stood\n&gt; only a few hundred feet \n&gt; away and if the Predacons destroyed it, they\n&gt; Maximals would probly have the \n&gt; good luck of some other brand new and all powerful\n&gt; ship crashing into this \n&gt; area. \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
