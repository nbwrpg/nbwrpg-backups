Including the fact that the cloaking\ndevice she would use might malfunction, taking the extra precaution to take\nanother one.\nShe took the stasis globe in her one hand but kept it close to herself,\nthinking how the beat of her own spark might keep Gangon comfortable if he\never began to seem detoured. Then with her other hand she reached into her\nleg compartment and retrieved the second cloaking device. It masked one&#39;s\nsignature as well as their appearance.\nBrightBlade then looked back towards Perndabot and threw it towards him,\nthinking of how it wouldn&#39;t be damaged if he managed to drop it. *\n\n&quot; There. No signature, no sight, no detection.&quot;\n\n* She then looked ahead of herself again, noting that it wouldn&#39;t be long\nnow until they reached the grasslands the base was located in.\nBrightBlade looked down at Gangon&#39;s spark as it beat inside the transparent\nball; careful to carry it so that it wouldn&#39;t get all bumped about. *\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWish you had something rad to add to your email?\nWe do at www.supersig.com.\nhttp://click.egroups.com/1/6810/13/_/_/_/964274403/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
