I met a couple of people at a few Garage sales who wanted to sell thier\ncollections of Transformers. they were mostly in good shape so I bought them\nout. I got about four hundred toys. Transformers, Gobots, Robotech, and some\ngeneric ones for $225. I already have the Micro master rocket base sold for\n$50 so I should have no problems making a profit.\n\nBIC Blacknightmares stun missed Silver Scout striking the wall behind her.\nShe was ready to strike a killing blow to Kit Kat when the bot countered\nquickly grabbing the mutant. Plasma blasts struck Silver Scout solidly\ncausing a searing pain to shoot through her body. The mutants plasma based\nenergeon system prevented any serious damage as drops of her red energeon\nhit the floor. The blasts changed her momentum preventing Kit Kat from\nslamming her down so the mutant did the next best thing. She rolled to the\nground attempting to flip Kit Kat between her and the other bots.\n\nA sudden burning sensation and the sight of her shadow told her that her\ncloak was down. until her internal systems repaired it she was an open\ntarget. Her actions made it to late for an apology or a surender. In the\ncondition she was in her only defenses were her teeth and claws. They\nweren&#39;t much in a firefight but in these close quarters she&#39;d make due.\n\nBlaze drew her disruptor when Silver Scout appeared. She aimed carefully and\nwaited for either an open shot or orders to fire with Kit Kat at risk.\nBullet knew his rocket launcher wasn&#39;t any good in thier own base so he grew\na force pistol from his side. He wanted to fire but didn&#39;t want to risk\nharming the other Predacon. He hoped the orders were to take the chance and\nfire. He didn&#39;t care as long as he got to shoot something.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 18, 2001 9:43 PM\nSubject: Re: Happanings at BlackFortress\n\n\n&gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt;\n&gt; Blacknightmare shot her stun gun against Silverscout\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Ender::\n&gt; &gt;     He reached up and scratched the back of his head.
