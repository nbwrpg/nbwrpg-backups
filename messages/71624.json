He&#39;s a military tactician and will probably want to do things\n&gt; carefully.  He&#39;s also going to keep an eye on Hydras.  That way he makes\n&gt; sure nothing goes wrong.  Also securing fuel for everyone isn&#39;t a bad thing\n&gt; either.  That&#39;s it for now, reply to the last one in a little while.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 11, 2011, at 5:19 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tommorrow I plan to jump us foward a few hours that way The fuzors can\n&gt;&gt; be given the opportunity to show up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please let me know what your characters should be doing in the mean time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I believe Straightshot, Scourge, Nightshift, Waspinator, Elita and\n&gt;&gt; crew will be mapping things out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cyclonus and Rodimus will be trying to trace back where these guys came\n&gt;&gt; from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What will Hydras and Tuscon be doing in the mean time? I will add that\n&gt;&gt; into the next post. Also Hydras called Sky Shadow over to him, was\n&gt;&gt; there a purpose in that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, I look foward to your posts and plans :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
