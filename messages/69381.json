Suddenly the sky became dark and a\n&gt;&gt; rumbling noise could be hea=\r\nrd, growing louder and louder. He looked up to\n&gt;&gt; see almost the whole sky =\r\noccupied by a massive starship seemly heading\n&gt;&gt; straight for the island. T=\r\nhe Atlantis emergency alarm started to sound and\n&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to the=\r\nir shelters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; ordered Perseus breaking=\r\n out into a run.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The rumbling sound continued to get louder. As Perse=\r\nus and his crew\n&gt;&gt; reached\n&gt;&gt; the base door, it was quickly opened for them=\r\n then shut behind them. He\n&gt;&gt; ordered everyone to move the lower level of t=\r\nhe base. As the ship passed\n&gt;&gt; over the island, the sound grew so loud that=\r\n the ground shook and weaker\n&gt;&gt; parts of buildings started to crumble, as i=\r\nn an earthquake. The ship\n&gt;&gt; traveled for another three miles before it tou=\r\nched down in the deep ocean\n&gt;&gt; waters. The force of the impact sent the shi=\r\np hundreds of feet below the\n&gt;&gt; surface and it continued to sink until comi=\r\nng to rest on the top of an\n&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displ=\r\naced by the ship started a\n&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all d=\r\nirections.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the lights flickered i=\r\nnside the\n&gt;&gt; Maximal\n&gt;&gt; base.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked=\r\n, sealing the last heavy door to\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; underground section of the base.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At that moment=\r\n the ten-story-high wall of water struck Atlantis from the\n&gt;&gt; east, picking=\r\n up all the boats in the harbor and tossing them onto the\n&gt;&gt; land.\n&gt;&gt; The p=\r\narts of the docks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and\n&gt;&gt; dest=\r\nroyed. A moment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf\n&gt;&gt; are=\r\na and they immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.\n&gt;&gt; Like=\r\nwise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Maximal base\n&gt;&gt; was=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundations and carried away, along with\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n everything in the command center, the armory, mess hall, and the main bank=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; of CR chambers were also picked up and carried away.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The lower fl=\r\noor of the base had a large metal slab to protect it from\n&gt;&gt; bombing, and a=\r\ns the water continued to pour over it, everything on the\n&gt;&gt; upper\n&gt;&gt; floors=\r\n was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of metal sitting at the\n&gt;&gt; bottom\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; of the crater that was the base. The buildings along the center of the\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n town\n&gt;&gt; were a little sturdier and remained standing, though heavily damag=\r\ned. The\n&gt;&gt; hanger and all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into th=\r\ne ocean.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled up the deep trench arou=\r\nnd the\n&gt;&gt; structure\n&gt;&gt; then the wall hit it, wrapping it entirely except fo=\r\nr the top five\n&gt;&gt; stories,\n&gt;&gt; damaging supports, breaking out all the windo=\r\nws and destroying the bridges\n&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave=\r\n then continued across the rest\n&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying buildings and =\r\ncarrying away the mass of debris,\n&gt;&gt; and then all was eerily quiet.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006F_01C9E119.012E8DF0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Dutf-8&gt;\n&lt;META=\r\n content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18226&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=3DMai=\r\nlContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PADDING-T=\r\nOP: 15px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; \nbgColor=3D#ffffff leftMargin=3D0 topM=\r\nargin=3D0 CanvasTabStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Talon:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&quot;So are we m&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt Tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGR=\r\nOUND: #f5f5f5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dkr=\r\naftlos@... \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:kraftlos@...&quot;&gt;Kraftlos&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:36 PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A titl=\r\ne=3Dnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: The Crash Landing and Af=\r\ntermath&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Salveo la=\r\nnded their last remaining shuttle atop the metal slab that&lt;BR&gt;once \nwas the=\r\n Maximal Base.

Knowing that their on=\r\nly \nhope of survival was to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; safely crash land, the pilot picked=\r\n an open \narea of ocean and tried to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; approach at a safe angle t=\r\no slow itself \nenough to keep the ship intact.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord=\r\n Perseus and his \ncrew walked along the bridge that crossed the gap&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; between the part \nof the island where the hangers were located and the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; peninsula area \nwhere the base sat. Suddenly the sky became da=\r\nrk and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; rumbling \nnoise could be heard, growing louder and lou=\r\nder. He looked up to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; see \nalmost the whole sky occupied by a ma=\r\nssive starship seemly heading&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nstraight for the island. The Atl=\r\nantis emergency alarm started to sound \nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians rushed to=\r\n their shelters.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&quot;Everyone! To the base! Hurry!&quot; o=\r\nrdered Perseus breaking out into a \nrun.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The rumbli=\r\nng sound continued to get louder. As \nPerseus and his crew&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; reac=\r\nhed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the base door, it was \nquickly opened for them then shut be=\r\nhind them. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered everyone \nto move the lower level of the =\r\nbase. As the ship passed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; over the \nisland, the sound grew so lo=\r\nud that the ground shook and weaker&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nparts of buildings started=\r\n to crumble, as in an earthquake. The ship&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \ntraveled for anothe=\r\nr three miles before it touched down in the deep \nocean&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; waters.=\r\n The force of the impact sent the ship hundreds of feet \nbelow the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; surface and it continued to sink until coming to rest on \nthe top of an=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; underwater mountain. The mass of water displaced by \nthe ship =\r\nstarted a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; massive tsunami-like wave, going out in all \ndirectio=\r\nns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The ground began to shake again and the \nlights=\r\n flickered inside the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Maximal&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nbase.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s that noise?&quot; Guardia asked, sealing \nthe last heavy =\r\ndoor to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; underground section of the \nbase.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The lights continued to flicker, then went \nout.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; At that moment the ten-story-high wall of water \nstruck At=\r\nlantis from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; east, picking up all the boats in the \nharbor a=\r\nnd tossing them onto the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; land.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The parts of the \ndo=\r\ncks that were not made of concrete were pushed up and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; destroyed=\r\n. A \nmoment later the water hit the buildings in the lower wharf&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; area and \nthey immediately collapsed under the intense weight of water.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nLikewise the metal dome that made up the upper story of the Max=\r\nimal \nbase&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; was&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately ripped from its foundati=\r\nons and \ncarried away, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in the command cen=\r\nter, the \narmory, mess hall, and the main bank&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of CR chambers w=\r\nere also picked \nup and carried away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The lower flo=\r\nor of the base had a \nlarge metal slab to protect it from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; bombi=\r\nng, and as the water \ncontinued to pour over it, everything on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; upper&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nfloors was ripped away, leaving a clean plate of met=\r\nal sitting at \nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of the crater that was th=\r\ne base. The \nbuildings along the center of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; town&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n were a little \nsturdier and remained standing, though heavily damaged. The=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; hanger \nand all the craft in it were picked up and thrown into=\r\n the \nocean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; As the water came to tower it filled u=\r\np the deep \ntrench around the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; structure&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; then the wa=\r\nll hit it, \nwrapping it entirely except for the top five&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; storie=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \ndamaging supports, breaking out all the windows and destroy=\r\ning the \nbridges&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that allowed access to the tower. The wave the=\r\nn continued \nacross the rest&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of the island, destroying building=\r\ns and carrying \naway the mass of debris,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and then all was eeril=\r\ny \nquiet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/=\r\nP&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006F_01C9E119.012E8DF0--\r\n\n"}}
