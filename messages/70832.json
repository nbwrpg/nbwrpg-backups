When I reprogramed for firstime\n&gt; Nightlight it was very hard to do it but this second time, was relative\n&gt; easy.

It looked as if the program were\ndesigned to give the victim a total memory wipe down to the core.\n\nThe tall bulky form of Santon stood behind Perceptor, his arms behind\nhis back. &quot;Tell me Perceptor.&quot; The Maximal doctor said as he watched\nboth the code and Perceptor, &quot;We are busy writing a program that would\ntotally erase the memories of anyone if implanted properly and deeply\nenough.&quot; Santon loked squarely at perceptor, &quot;What could you do with a\nprogram like that?&quot; It would seem that Santon was testing Perceptor in\nsome way, to see what his thoughts were about the casual use of such a\npotentially destrcutive program.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
