In reality he does, but he&#39;s concentrating on Talon.  \nHe fires a burst of energy from his laser sword just before the pair \nreach melee range, then strikes out with a lateral slash.\n\n(Riekan&#39;s not using lasers, by the way - it&#39;s all solid \nprojectiles.)  The shark-like Riekan continues his assault, launching \nanother harpoon, this one with a towline attached instead of the \nexploding variety - rather like long-distance spearfishing.\n\nTorin gently examines the damage Jayde has taken, seemingly oblivious \nto the battle around him.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ????:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What your intention about us?&quot;replied the femme &quot;What&#39;s your \nclan?&quot; \n&gt; in a low voice the femme asked to Vlad &quot;What&#39;s a Trial of \nposession?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Coming from the back, Shadow Star sends two balls of fire hurling \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; Devilcat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shadow Star: Ease off, lady.
