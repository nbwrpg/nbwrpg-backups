The eaglebot reached into his memory and found\n&gt; a useable signal. activateing his commlink he sent the signal into the Earth\n&gt; below. A return signal confirmed his suspicions requesting Trainer\n&gt; authorization. Slayer wasn&#39;t with the group that had initially landed so the\n&gt; box might not recognize him.  Again Ignatius sent a signal to the box\n&gt; getting an &quot;Afirmative.&quot; the ground rose up, the grassy landmass remaining\n&gt; on top making it hard to spot from the air. &quot;Alright, I still got it.&quot;\n&gt; Ignatius boasted making himself out to seem like an arrogant bot.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 18, 2001 5:37 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: OOC: / Slayer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Slayer nods, speeding up.
