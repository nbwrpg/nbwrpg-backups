Out of his pocket he\npulled out a golden key. It had the symbol of the\nautobots embeded on it. Magamatron grinned at the\nsight. When they stole the golden disc unaware to\nmegatron he had also stolen the key to the Ark. This\nbeing the only way the ark would ever fly again. This\ncould be a useful tool in the war. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend instant messages with Yahoo! Messenger.\nhttp://im.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
