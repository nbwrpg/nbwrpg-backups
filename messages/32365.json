I was wondering, have you responded to my post with Sublime?\n\n* Without even thinking why, Sublime entered onto the battlefield around the\nCF. Though she can come around on the eastern side and saw something that\nshe was sure wasn&#39;t right.\nThere were 4 transformers bearing down on the CF with all the firepower they\nseemed to have. ( Aquarious, Black Aracnia, Bezerker, and Quickstrike )\nRemoving a small dagger from her waist she looked it over, squeezing the\nhandle a little and watching a green ooz slime out of the edges.\nPoison, one that would sieze the spark.\nWithout ni prime directive she threw it at the back of the nearest enemy,\nBerzerker.*\n\nI was just wondering because I haven&#39;t picked up on any response yet, if you \nhave then I&#39;ll look over my posts again.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
