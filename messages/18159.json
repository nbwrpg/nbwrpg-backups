He growls, his jetpack powering down as he drops toward \nBlender, \n&gt; slashing his sword at the bot&#39;s back as he lands.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; A shot hits Bloodystrike in the chest, sending him flying backwards \nbefore \n&gt; regaining stability.\n&gt; \n&gt; He aims carefully at Shockaract, firing off two missiles. He frowns \nas he \n&gt; notices a femm laying in stasis lock on the ground (Vamprah), \ngliding in and \n&gt; landing near her.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Reptilica opens his eyes, going out of stasis lock. He was drenched \nwith mech \n&gt; fluid, but he was still somewhat functional.\n&gt; \n&gt; A stray blast nearly hits him in the head, Reptilica realizing that \nhe was in \n&gt; a battle.
