It&#39;s not \na slag fest, so don&#39;t just try to kill each other, rp it out; and, \ngenerally speaking, when there is a fight, both sides usually get \ndamaged. =P\n\nYah, nuclear firepower and any nuclear type weapons are not allowed \nat the moment.

Then he charged at your char (not\n&gt; fired a beam). And Hugars on the council. The point\n&gt; was I&#39;ve already accepted losing an arm and almost\n&gt; loosing a leg. You haven&#39;t accepted squat and you need\n&gt; to accept something.

Well.... its a\n&gt; &gt; secret and as far as you \n&gt; &gt; bringing in hugar I dont remember him ever saying he\n&gt; &gt; was your lap dog and \n&gt; &gt; would do everything you say. He reads the post he\n&gt; &gt; knows whats going on, if he \n&gt; &gt; finds a problem with it or nother council member\n&gt; &gt; finds something so wrong \n&gt; &gt; they will bring it up and say to possibly to change\n&gt; &gt; it. Also demanding a \n&gt; &gt; person to take damage doesn&#39;t really look good for\n&gt; &gt; you and claiming that they \n&gt; &gt; will be moderated because you want them to be also\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make you look \n&gt; &gt; good. And as for a mutate making a barrier when he\n&gt; &gt; got scared that caused \n&gt; &gt; damage, that never happened, when he got sacred he\n&gt; &gt; channeled energy in its \n&gt; &gt; mouth and fired it at at a bot. And what type of\n&gt; &gt; radiation is it? Nuclear? \n&gt; &gt; Energon? If its nuclear then I believe thats illegal\n&gt; &gt; am I correct Rauq?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Find a job, post your resume.\n&gt; http://careers.yahoo.com\n\n\n"}}
