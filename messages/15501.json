With all his armor singed from before it was excruciating \npain. He got up, transformer, stumbled over to Reptillica and slapped \nhim in the face.\n\n&quot;I must not be very dumb, because if I were I wouldn&#39;t know that the \nquicker I see Zardus the quicker you have a chance to escape \nMegatron. Now open the door!&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers w/ Savage\n\nTrainer arrived in eye sight distance of the Ark. Prebon examined the \nsituation.\n\n&quot;Hmmmm..... Some bots over there. A bot lying on the ground, and an \nalomst destroyed ship. Perfect. Move out!&quot;\n\nBlaze, Ignatius, Bullet and Hammer ran out first, guns blazing at all \nthe bots. Next came Prebon, riding atop Savage, shooting fireballs at \nthe hull.\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nAfter a bit of rummagin, Brix and Fliq thought they found a suitable \npiece of rubble.\n\n&quot;Come, let&#39;s go use it.&quot;\n\nThey broought it back to Ramulus.\n\n&quot;Come on, help us attach it.&quot;\n\nBrix and Fliq started attaching the metal.\n\n\n"}}
