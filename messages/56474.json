His chest slid open \nrevealing tons of equipent... &quot;Use what you need but make it a small \nfile.&quot;\n\nQuetzalcoatl:\n\n&quot;Thanks sir&quot; Said the male while he transformed to his robot form for \nfirst time.  his first tranformation was painful and his bot form was \nterribly ugly,  Quetzalcoatl  has a skully body and he was huncback. \nHis Arms were thin and large, almost they reached the floor. His face \nshowed his ashame due his own ugly bot form and hi face was skully, \nhis eyes have a deep green bright, his golden helmet was decorate in \nthat way that it looked like Aztecs&#39; helmet. His metallic skin was \ngray and he had too, large and thin fingers.\n\nQuet started to work quickly, councious that he wans&#39;t very handsome, \nbut that wasn&#39;t important by now\n\nScourge looked down at the bot. &quot;Your a autobot right?&quot;\n\nQuetzalcoalt:\n\n&quot;A maximal, sir&quot;replied the male\n\nScourge nodded. &quot;And you know i am a decepticon, and that i once \ntried to kill the bot who lead the auto bots until primal took over?&quot;\n\n\nQuetzalcoatl:\n \n&quot;Yes, sir, History was my Fav subject in High Maximal Militar \nAcademy&quot; replied the male&quot;In order to,  prevent any future use to \nthis information, I  down loaded a virus that will erase this file, \njust this file,  when I command and if my spark fade... This virus \nwon&#39;t hurt you... just will erase the file&quot;\n\nScourge looked down at the small bot. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for your \nschooling young one i&#39;d swear you were a decepticon... maybe after \nthis you will join me, with your knowledge and my power and skills we \ncould topple megatron and rule over all.&quot;\n\nMirage and grimlock became a little edgy as the tried not to listen \nin to hard. &quot;Me grimlock no trust ugly bot, Grimlock no trust Bad \nPrime either./&quot; He let his sword slide out of the tail and ran his \nthumb over it. \n\n&quot;The same said my teachers&quot;replied the male while he still was \nworking &quot;Thunder, that was my maximal name, You&#39;re acting as \ndecepticon if you won&#39;t correct that you will end in a big \ntrouble&quot;said mimic a calling down tone&quot;But some times is useful brake \nsome rules, when situations needs and other times is better follow \nthe rules... But, I&#39;m happy to be a maximal, sir, due my personal \npoint of view and a embarrasing situation... I was sent in this \nmission&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh what got you put with the Big bad bot, the dino dummys, and the \ncoward?&quot; Scourge chuckled, he knew this was a mission for the big \nboys and the ones they wanted to get rid of.&quot;\n\nQuetzalcoatl:\n\n&quot;Well, &quot;said the male&quot; I can&#39;t sayt that... I&#39;ve been a goody \nMaximal &quot;said with EMbarrasing &quot;Well, I not an ortodoxy Maximal.... I \ndid some disasters... accidentaly and my Principal tought that I was \nenough smart to a mission but I&#39;m very inmature... They thought,  \nthat a tought comander and a mission would be enough good  for me to \ngrew up... and regarding my knowledge of History, they tuoght that  I \ncould be useful&quot;\n\nScourge nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll make you feel right at home kid. &quot;Grimlock walk \npoint, if you can survive re-entry, you can survive a cannon booby-\ntrap.&quot;\n\nGrimlock growled and transformed walking ahead.\n\n\n\n"}}
