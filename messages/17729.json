He dreampt he was at The Oracle again, \nbeing thanked for his great work. Than the Oracle begna to laugh. \nVulois was confused. Suddenly faces went onto the Oracle. Even though \nhe had not ever seen these people in his life, he knew all of their \nnames. Gotron, Perndabot, Reptillica, Bloodystrike, Stranato, \nWheeljack, Unitron. Than one final face, the face he recognized. The \nface of the man who killed his closest and longest friend on this \nplanet, Soundwave. It was Zardus.\n\nThan suddenly, Vulois could not move. He had been chained up. He \ntried to fight his way out, but it just became stronger. Zardus(This \nisn&#39;t the real Zardus, it&#39;s just a dream, so it&#39;s not moding.) \nstepped out from the Oracle and stood infront of Vulois. Vuois tried \nto fight, but was stuck by the chains. Than Zardus began changing. \nAnd when the changes were done, Vulois was shocked by what he looked \nlike.\n\nHimself\n\nThan the real Vulois went dormant, and this new Vulois took complete \ncontrol. The eyes on the body opened, and he spoke.\n\n&quot;Alliance member Vulois, reporting for duty.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
