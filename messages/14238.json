Let&#39;s go rip the hull off.&quot;\n\nAs the three began to walk off towards the hull, Fliq looked to \nRamulus. His thoughts had often been going towards him in the last \nlittle bit. He thought his life was bad. He watched as those he cared \nabout died, and now can no longer travel through space. But \nRamulus...Ramulus had never even seen Cybertron! Past Earth is all \nhe&#39;s known. And on top of it, he died! His Spark actually left his \nbody for awhile. Fliq continued to walk, reflecting on how he should \nbe happy with his life.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nStarscream stood by KitKat&#39;s door, and heard her conversation with \nDrillbit, and how they were much in love. When KitKat had ordered him \naround, he felt a little crush on her. She knew who he was, but \nwouldn&#39;t just roll over because of who he was. The old Starscream \nwould have bargined in their, blaster Drillbit and taken KitKat for \nhis. But not now. He understood they were in love. He would leave \nthem alone.\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois landed at the secret entrance to the tunnel.\n\n&quot;Should I go ahead? No, I should wait for them. They&#39;ll never find \ntheir way. There are so many other directions, it will be hard for \nthem to follow. I&#39;ll wait until they catch up.&quot;\n\nStarscream walked off towards his post.\n\n\n"}}
