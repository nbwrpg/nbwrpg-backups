(The bat probes and \n&gt; autoguns.) Have your main characters fire at him and I&#39;ll give you \na \n&gt; dinner instead of minor damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bounty ducked, sending Darkmouses blast away from him.\n&gt; The bat probes couldn&#39;t get a positive lock on Bounty so they \nmissed. \n&gt; The shots from B. Nightmare, Mantys, and Wespa bounced off the \n&gt; spinning Bounty. He stopped to soon and a lone shot struck him in \nthe \n&gt; side. He stumbled to the side and dropped his blades. Dizzy from \nall \n&gt; the spinning he stumbled around VULNERABLE to any attack. His \n&gt; depleted blasters returned to his side. He tried to see straight \nbut \n&gt; failed as he staggered against the wall of the Predacon Base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finish him at your convenience Airly.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
