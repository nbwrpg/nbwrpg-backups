Her woulds were getting \nto her.  Her beautiful female torso was now riddled with holes from \nthe shots, her shoulders were shot up and her legs were leaking as \nbad as the rest of her.  She was starting to feel weak from the loss \nof mech fluid.  She fired her optic lazars at twice at Beholder, and \nfires twice at Gigas.  \n\nShe stumbled and fell to the ground.  She growled and got back up.  \nShe was in a lot of pain, but was to mad to stop.  She kept firing, \nnot giving up untill she was dead.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ::Zardus/Reptilica/Bloodystrike/Havoc/Repressor::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zardus tries to dodge, one of the shots hitting him in the chest \nand\n&gt; leaving\n&gt; &gt; a large dent. He growls. He was not going to let another shot \nlike that\n&gt; hit\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zardus looks down at Grenade, Zardus fires two dozen more shots.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: How high up is Zardus?\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: Grenade was paying attention to Feline and was hit in the back \nwith\n&gt; every shot. He made a whining squeal like metal scraping together. \nHe looked\n&gt; up to see Zardus. He fired up at Zardus with a missile.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Havoc laughs as he sees Beholder fall, another bomb emerging out \nof the\n&gt; &gt; WarMachine and flying at Beholder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beholder also is looking at Feline, who wouldn&#39;t want to kill her? \nBeholder\n&gt; walks out from the way the bomb was falling, the explosion going up \nhis back\n&gt; and leaving him looking up in the air in shock.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; A missile explodes against the bottom of Repressor, sending him \nspiralling\n&gt; &gt; before he recovers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns in the air, his weapons getting a lock on Gigas and Horn \nDrill\n&gt; again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Horn Drill actually managed to get away from the shots, but in the \nprocess,\n&gt; he let Gigas be hit. Gigas doesn&#39;t notice and fires at Feline twice.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
