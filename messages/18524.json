If she woke up and ran off, it \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be too good.\n&gt; \n&gt; He enters, raising an eyebrow when he sees Kluster standing with a \n&gt; wheeled pallet behind him. The pallet had reinforced arm leg, and \n&gt; head straps, and had a strange device above the &quot;pillow&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Most of the crew are out on missions, so I&#39;m stuck with the \nfetching \n&gt; jobs,&quot; Kluster explains as Firearm puts Spears on the pallet, &quot;That \n&gt; device will block out transmissions and also acts as a scan jammer.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm looks at Kluster like the bot had finally snapped. &quot;Sir, I \n&gt; have been on this ship for a while now, I&#39;m not one of the new \n&gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster smiles, realizing he had been explaining something to \nFirearm \n&gt; that Firearm probably knew everything there was to know about. \n&gt; &quot;Sorry, hosting a factions isn&#39;t exactly easy on the nerves, you \n&gt; know.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Firearm nods, moving the pallet and heading over toward the lab \nwith \n&gt; it. &quot;Do you know if we have a bot specialist on this ship, sir? My \n&gt; knowledge of surgery and reprogramming might not be enough for \nthis. \n&gt; Its pretty limited.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Trainers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;All right, it&#39;s game time,&quot; said Prebon, &quot;Slayer, you start us \n&gt; off. \n&gt; &gt; Stay in cloak and hunt down the wolf. As soon as you open fire on \n&gt; &gt; him, we will attack the Ark. I think we will stay in cloak, and \nit \n&gt; &gt; will make them confused and by Blaze more time. Okay Slayer.
