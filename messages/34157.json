His rear rockets \nfire, incinerating several shrubs and charring a tree behind him, as \nhe moves forward. Slowly at first, Astroblast gains speed and \nmomentum quickly, putting distance between himself and the trees \nbelow. He head towards the CF, and Megatron&#39;s location, reveling \nat the chance to help Maximals and their allies to their matrix.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nDead-End fly&#39;s past Skyscream, and lands on the ground, he \ngroans. His eyes widden as he spots the impending doom. He \nquickly rolls to the side as two shells crash beside him. He rolls \ninto a rock. Not a big rock, but a rock large enough to stop him \nfrom rolling. The third shell replaces Dead-End&#39;s arm, and some of \nhis side armour, with a tangled mesh of mechafluid and wires. He \ngroans, &quot;Ughh, dangnabit....&quot; He tries to get up without much \nsuccess.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nDrag Strip continues up to Incarcinator, continuing his plasma fire. \n&quot;Wildrider, join the party,&quot; he yells without looking. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSwitchblade continues work on Speedbreaker. He smiles at his \nclever disguise; the sparks coming from the laser look like the \nsparks that would come from a damaged robot, and him being \ncloaked leaves it looking like a wreck on the ground. &quot;Just wait \nSpeedbreaker, you&#39;ll be up soon,&quot; he says quietly, mostly to \nhimself.\n\n\nOn 8 May 2001, at 18:32, robertdahl wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Okay, every post sent by Scorpius, has a date on it before he\n&gt; quit.

He smiles a twisted expression, as his eyes\n&gt; begin to glow red. &quot;Switchblade, get Speedbreaker fixed. He will be\n&gt; needed for my future plans&quot;. Megatron then looks at Triggerhappy,\n&gt; Scourge, and Cyclonus. &quot;Transform my Decepticons, and ATTACK&quot; he\n&gt; yells, poiting at the Element. &quot;Nightstrike, follow their flank, and\n&gt; listen to Cyclonus. Motormaster, continue the plan. Skullgrin&quot; he\n&gt; yells reffering to the Pretender. &quot;Receive&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron then jumps straight up into the air, and starts a back flip.\n&gt; As he does, he starts to fold in on himself, and shrink, transforming\n&gt; into his gun mode. He then falls towards Skullgrin, waiting for him to\n&gt; catch him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Motormaster walks up towards Speedbreaker, to inspect the damage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wildrider continues to fall, and gracefully just misses the shells, as\n&gt; he was keeping his eyes on Incarcinerator. He looks towards Shockwave,\n&gt; and starts to laugh. &quot;Commander Shockwave. Megatron wishes to speak to\n&gt; you&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
