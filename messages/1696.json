She sighed\nas\n&gt; she then looked up at Gangon, she had heard what he had said about kooks.\n&gt; She snickered, how wrong he was.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That isn&#39;t always true, Gangon. Some bots that may seem strange can be\n&gt; smarter then you know. Slag, you say that some bots like Dinobot and\n&gt; Tavatron are kooks when I know that you&#39;re wrong, that lizardbot of\nTvatrons\n&gt; there could rip both you and I apart and not even break a sweat.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * BrightBlade hated to admit it but there were more powerful bots then\n&gt; Gangon and herself, even though she knew that her hacking and hot-wiring\n&gt; skills were almost unmatched.\n&gt; She popped another piece of fruit in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully,\n&gt; yes...there were more powerful bots then Gangon and herself.\n&gt; Another bot that concerned her was that 3ed in command of Liono&#39;s, what\nwas\n&gt; her name? Iron Raptor?\n&gt; Well, there was a bot with a beast mode that kicked ass, literally!\n&gt; BrightBlade smiled, she wondered what sort of prize she would get from\nHell\n&gt; Beast if she and Gangon could manage to bag that bot!\n&gt; It was risky and she doubted that she could pull it off but just think, a\n&gt; beast mode like that fighting on the Predacons side!\n&gt; She crossed her arms in frontt of her and snickered, that would have to\n&gt; worth some type of prize...didn&#39;t it?\n&gt; BrightBlade sighed as she extinguished the idea, she would most likely end\n&gt; up dead if she so much as tried, she picked off another grape and\nswallowed\n&gt; it. But it was nice to dream.*\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Was the salesman clueless?
