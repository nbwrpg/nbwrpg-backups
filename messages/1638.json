It will repair all internal damages in which you might have. It also helps headaches and other forms of bodily annoyances.&quot;\n\n* She kept the liquid in her hands for Striker to take, she knew that if Rowdy didn&#39;t want this Maximal in his den then she could move him to hers. Just for the duration of his healing anyway.*\n\n__________________________________________\n\n* Iron Raptor landed with a soft thud on the ground below, to make sure that her signature wasn&#39;t detected she transformed into her beast mode.\nNow in familiar scales she looked at Prowl and narrowed her eyes at his comment, she then moved off towards the new base with stealth but had one last thing to say.*\n\n&quot; Thanks!&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
