He was suprised this was not\na Maximal. &quot;Never call me a Predacon.&quot; Megatron said through clenched\nteeth. He strained to raise his cannon arm again, aiming at Mutate. With\na quivering strain, he aimed at the mutated creature.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRampage rode over the terrain, his treads grinding the earth. He looked\nup at the two hovering robots. &quot;Ahhh it is you my friend.&quot; He whispered,\nwhen he then noticed the one robot aiming at him. &quot;It can&#39;t be,\nMegatron, ho ho ho, we are going to have fun here. HERE ARE SOME IRON\nRATIONS.&quot; he screamed as his gattling gun barrel turned, then fired off\na rocket at the Decepticon leader. The shell screamed off towards the\nDecepticon leader, leaving a trail of smoke as it slammed into\nMegatron&#39;s back, tearing a hole into his armor, and sending him\nplummeting to the ground.\n\n"}}
