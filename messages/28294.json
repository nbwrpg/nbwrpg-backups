He aimed \nthe Vok orb again, firing two bolts that destroyed one of the \nmissiles. Laser bolts flew by underneath, the other missiles hitting \nFZ, but the &#39;clone&#39; kept going.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing Vehement raise his arms, Killfest jumps into the air, his \njetpack activating again and sending him sailing high up. He feels \nthe air shaking under him as the sonic wave passes, but it misses \nhim. He fires two missiles at Vehement, followed by three more EMP \nblasts.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGreven boosts out of the way of the two charges, one of the missiles \nhitting him and flipping him backwards, but the Predacon didn&#39;t \nreally care. The rage of battle was setting into his mind, making him \nignore most of the damage on his body, which wasn&#39;t much at all. He \naims up at Sun Crusher and fires two missiles from each gun again, \nboth of them energy-seeking.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEndBringer jumps to the left, both the acid and the normal missiles \nmissing him. The seeker hits him, but the large bot barely flinches. \nHis two missile launchers fire two missiles each in opposite \ndirections, the missiles spreading out and then coming at Reflector \nfrom four different sides, aimed at his knees. They were heading \nupwards, so Reflector launching himself up wouldn&#39;t cause the \nmissiles to colide with each other.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; Unicron/Vehement/Sun Crusher/Reflector/Demon Wulf/Flesh Ripper/Dark \nClaw/\n&gt; The Protectobots/Shockwave:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Unicron turned around, firing a single optic blast, the other \nmissile blowing \n&gt; up against his chest.  He laughed, raising a hand, three laser \nbolts lancing \n&gt; out from the palm at FZ&#39;s sternum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising the other arm, he launched off an ES-seeking missile at the \nclone&#39;s \n&gt; left knee joint.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Vehement flew hard left firing off a couple optic blasts, \nintercepting the \n&gt; missiles, the two EMP bolts striking his chest, being absorbed by a \npart of \n&gt; his tattered Archbishop robes that were still in good condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising both arms together, he fired a large invisible sonic wave \nthat shot \n&gt; out at Kilfest&#39;s torso, the wave designed to badly damage internal \ncircuitry \n&gt; when used on a target enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun Crusher fired off five optic blasts on an intercept course with \nthe \n&gt; inbound missiles, pulling hard left in his flight, making sure he \nstays in \n&gt; the general direction of the northeast towards &quot;Red Hero&quot;.  One \nmissile \n&gt; blasted him in the chest, knocking him back in the air, extra power \nto both \n&gt; boosters in his feet allowing him to regain his balance in the air, \nblasting \n&gt; forward at an accellerated speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raising a wrist he launched off two energy-signature seeking \nmissiles at \n&gt; Greven.  In his left hand appeared a grenade launcher from \nsubspace.  Already \n&gt; set to explode on impact, he fired off two of the small explosives \ndownward \n&gt; towards Greven.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Reflector raised a wrist, making quick modifications to a missile \nhe launched \n&gt; it, exploding a few feet in front of the other missiles to block \nthem.  He \n&gt; fired six rapid blasts in the general direction of the missiles \njust in case.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his left arm, firing down a spray of acid at Endbringer, \nraising \n&gt; the same twin-barreled mounted launcher attached to his wrist that \nhad been \n&gt; fired to intercept the enemy missiles, firing one energy-signature \nseeking \n&gt; missile from one barrel down at Endbringer, two regular missiles \ndown at the \n&gt; Predacon immediately after, the Brotherhood member staying on \ncourse.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------\n&gt; \n&gt; Hot Spot watched as two CR chambers opened and he yelled.  &quot;Come \non!  Follow \n&gt; me!  Battle outside, no time to explain!&quot; he yelled, running full \nspeed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blades looked to First Aid and gave a confused look.  &quot;Didn&#39;t...we \njust fight \n&gt; in a battle?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, we better hurry though.&quot; the medic replied, going after Hot \nSpot with \n&gt; Blades in tow.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------\n&gt; \n&gt; Demon Wulf felt to blasts strike his right knee and he almost feel, \nbut with \n&gt; a free hand he pushed himself back up.  Opening his mouth he fired \noff a long \n&gt; burs to flames at Streetwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Flesh Ripper formed a black orb in his hand and threw it at the \nCybertronian \n&gt; Fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Dark Claw launched off two more missiles at the Cybertronian Fire \nfrom his \n&gt; ports, moving forward a meter.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Groove slowly got to a knee, taking out a charge and throwing at \nthe space in \n&gt; between Flesh Ripper&#39;s feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Streetwise fell to his back as the flames hit him full force \ncharring his \n&gt; armor.  He didn&#39;t get up.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Shockwave made a barrell roll and armed two more missiles.\n\n\n"}}
