We&#39;re allied with them, so we will help them for now,&quot; He says and flies off.\n\nThe two bots fly off after him.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl&#39;s breathing quickens considerably as Iron Raptor moves in his arms.\n\nHe looks at her and notices that she is tightly holding on to him. Somehow, that realization made his feel very good, and he barely sees Shockers shot before Tritan jumps in front of him.\n\nProwl folds his wings, diving toward the ground at an alarming rate to escape further shots.\n\nSeveral yards off of the ground, he opens his wings, catches a thermal, and he and Iron Raptor suddenly fly up and forward, heading for Shocker, Prowl firing at him.\n\n"}}
