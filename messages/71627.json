When would Tuscon have stopped to pick up those reserves?\nRemem=\r\nber Tuscon came out of repairs still hurt then turned into a\ndragon and the=\r\nn flew off. there was no posting of picking up enough\nfuel supplies to refu=\r\nel everyone. Now you do have Hydras standing\nthere with possible fuel suppl=\r\nies, but this is a disadvantage of being\nso far from home - no easy access =\r\nto supplies.\n\nPreston\n\nOn 8/11/11, Sandy Panico &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; Tucson knew that fuel reserves needed to be replenished.  Lucky for h=\r\nim he\n&gt; had emergency reserves subspaced within his draconic body.  He open=\r\ns up the\n&gt; left front haunch compartment and reveals a line of canisters.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &quot; I&#39;m sure many of you need fuel.  Help yourselves but try to consider\n&gt;=\r\n others who are Also in need of refueling.&quot; I have a second reserve on my\n&gt;=\r\n right side.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While with Waspinator, Straight Shot giggles with delight=\r\n.  She loved a\n&gt; little thrill seeking and being almost dropped was actuall=\r\ny exciting to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s okay, it was actually kinda fun.  I&#39;ve ne=\r\nver had the opportunity to\n&gt; fly and I&#39;m enjoying it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She transforms i=\r\nnto her robot mode and catches hold to Waspinator&#39;s spindly\n&gt; legs, keeping=\r\n a sure but gentile grip on it.  She keeps her beacon on track\n&gt; mode while=\r\n flying with what could very well be an evolving friendship.  She\n&gt; looks u=\r\np to Waspinator with a smile and a thumbs up.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We&#39;re still on track, a=\r\nnd my beacon is  rapidly flashing.  We must be\n&gt; getting close.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She no=\r\nw swings herself up onto his back, carefully minding his wings.  She\n&gt; prov=\r\nes to be a very light passenger as she rides contently on the Predacon&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\nback.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I never thought that I would ever make friends among enemies but=\r\n, I think I\n&gt; just did.  Nobody has ta know anything except for us.   What&#39;=\r\nd ya say?\n&gt; Friends?  I promise never ta tell Leo or Rodimus.  Tucson will =\r\nunderstand\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think the other two will.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She couldn&#39;t exactl=\r\ny tell what was happening to her but whatever it was,\n&gt; certainly didn&#39;t bo=\r\nther her in the least.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n On Aug 11, 2011, at 5:14 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; With deep breaths, Tucson cools down as nostrils fla=\r\nir to allow faster\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cooling of his systems.  At the same time he raises =\r\nhis neck for another\n&gt;&gt;&gt; look around.  Then his head is swung ahead facing =\r\nnorthward once again.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; His\n&gt;&gt;&gt; long tail snaps at the ground beneath him=\r\n, taking out what remains of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dinosaur bones, smashing them to splin=\r\nters.  It felt good to roar, it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; helped\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to release trapped emotions =\r\nthat had built up over time.  Certainly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Rodimus\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was trying his pati=\r\nence and it was a good method of not lashing out at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; him\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which would=\r\n have been a grave mistake.  He continues to wait for the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Fuzors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to=\r\n arrive.  He thinks to himself as he does.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As TUSCON wait=\r\ned for the Maximal fuzors the other Predacons seemed to\n&gt;&gt; give him a wide =\r\nberth. DEEPSTRYKE continued to hover into the air far\n&gt;&gt; above, his sensors=\r\n probing over the dinosaurs, the Predacons and the\n&gt;&gt; Maximals, missing ver=\r\ny little.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The predacons that could fly were still hover over the dino=\r\nsaurs just\n&gt;&gt; watching the flames, their fire and heat doing all the work o=\r\nf\n&gt;&gt; destroying the dinosaur flesh. However the work was slow gooing and\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n the Predacons were begining to mumble.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;This is burning up my heat e=\r\nxchanger.&quot; One said.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Another said, &quot;Yeah along with all our fuel rese=\r\nrves.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There was a pause as others began mumbling something similar a=\r\nll under\n&gt;&gt; their breath.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Straightshot&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Till all ar=\r\ne one.   I most certainly hope you&#39;re right about\n&gt;&gt;&gt; this,Primus.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Our =\r\nlives depend on your theory.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, having been above in Waspi=\r\nnator&#39;s grasp, Straight Shot could\n&gt;&gt;&gt; actually sense some good attributes =\r\nin him if there were any to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sensed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Although they could never be=\r\n allies she still could sense something\n&gt;&gt;&gt; positive\n&gt;&gt;&gt; about him.  His se=\r\nnse of sticking to things even if he didn&#39;t like doing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; them, was admira=\r\nble and she felt he should be complemented.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Waspinator, look I kn=\r\now you hate me with a passion and you aren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on my friends =\r\nlist but I want you to know that I really admire your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; loyalty\n&gt;&gt;&gt; towar=\r\nd this mission and having the tolerance to work with an enemy bot.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#39;=\r\nre doing a really good job, keep it up.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; WASPINATOR flies=\r\n a little higher as his wings buzz, &quot;Waspinator is\n&gt;&gt; better than dumb Maxi=\r\nmals!&quot; he says as he scans over the dinosaur\n&gt;&gt; remains. &quot;But sometimes som=\r\ne Maximals do have a good point.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In his glee over STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s com=\r\nment WASPINATOR almost dropped her,\n&gt;&gt; but then buzzed down to catch her. &quot;=\r\nSorry.&quot; he said sheepishly before\n&gt;&gt; flying on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Elita paled and slight shaken qhen Sourge was around and she asked in =\r\nlow\n&gt;&gt;&gt; voice to  Nightshift =93do you think that scourge eats little kitte=\r\nns?=94\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Nightshift&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nightshift keeps tabs on Scour=\r\nge, being sure he keeps his distance.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Good question, I think we b=\r\netter keep tabs on him.
