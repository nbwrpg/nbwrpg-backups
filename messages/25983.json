Leaving the\n&gt;rest of the shields up?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* She spoke this and then waited, glancing at Cheetor again but was eased\n&gt;when he decided just to lay back and stay in line with everyone else.\n&gt;But then Iron Raptor looked towards another voice, seeing that it was\n&gt;Rhinox. It was strange sometimes how people asked for orders or commands,\n&gt;like they want to be sent out to go and do something. Must be bord then.\n&gt;She shook her head.*\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot; There are none to give out other then maintaining the cease fire and\n&gt;watching the Alliance.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;* There was no telling just what the Alliance could do now and if they \n&gt;would\n&gt;leave once the captives had been released. But she hoped that they were \n&gt;just\n&gt;as tired of this battle as she was and ready to go back to their own base\n&gt;that needed it&#39;s own protecting.\n&gt;But then Iron Raptor suddenly remembered something, feeling rather guilty\n&gt;for forgetting.\n&gt;There was still the small kitten in her back compartment!\n&gt;She reached back to get hold of him, trying to get a punch of neck fur\n&gt;between her fingers to pull him out. But it wasn&#39;t long before there was\n&gt;some other sound which attracted her attention while she was trying to get\n&gt;the cat. It was a musical voice, and it was greeted by her with a slightly\n&gt;annoyed sigh.\n&gt;It was one thing after another.\n&gt;&lt; Could you reply to that, Prowl?&gt;*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
