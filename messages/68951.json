As he dove into \nthe area of =\r\nthe darkness his sensor locks are lost and he is forced \nto operate blindly=\r\n!\n\n(OOC: I posted the darkness on the last post, but you may have missed \ni=\r\nt)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nL=\r\nord Jhiaxus&#39;s missiles streak through the air at the form of Tummult \nas th=\r\ne minion spirals down from the last hit. As the missiles \nconverge on him a=\r\n beam of energy spews out from the ball of darkness \nthat was enveloping th=\r\ne ark, striking Tummult at that same moment as \nthe missiles. The minion di=\r\nsappeared in the exlosion! \n \nLord Elder and Grimlock are no longer able to=\r\n detect any sort of \nenergy signature coming from Tummult, perhaps because =\r\nof Jhiaxus&#39; \nmissiles, or perhaps that strange beam. In either case their \n=\r\nattention might be diverted to Nightstrike and Darkfate as the two \nconcent=\r\nrate their fire power in the Ark.\n\n----------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n\nFor those near the ark, if any are scanning f=\r\nor =96 there is a definite \nMinion energy signature is coming from the insi=\r\nde, although there is \na sensor distortion as well, so it is difficult to l=\r\nocalize exactly \nwhere the signature is inside the sphere of darkness. \n\n--=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThe s=\r\nweeps around Scorponok are far more wary, and do not quite fall \nfor his tr=\r\nap. With a quick movement they back away, using their omni-\ndirectional att=\r\nitude thrusters to move them in ways a jet or plane \ncould not move. While =\r\nhis weapons catch them with glancing strafing \nhits they still open up with=\r\n full cannons as the wheel around looking \nfor weakness.\n\n-----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nDecibel is hit by the f=\r\nirepower from Hydras and she hissed in \npain! &quot;That&#39;s IT! You fired on me, =\r\nTake THAT!!&quot; as she swung around \nand opened up on Hydras, even as smoke tr=\r\nailed from her wounds. \n\nPerceptor&#39;s firepower on sweeps is partially effec=\r\ntive as the sweeps \nback away. \n\n(OOC: Is Perceptor blind? I thought I had =\r\nread that in some earlier \npost. If so what is he using to track the sweeps=\r\n?)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n =\r\n\nRodimus was back on his feet, facing Cyclonus, in a fighting pose. As \nCyc=\r\n&#39;s palms glowed with energy, ready to strike, Rodimus locked on \nhis over-s=\r\nhoulder rockets.\n \n&gt; Rodimus: The difference is I don&#39;t know that part of m=\r\ny past any \n&gt; longer. I HAVE NO RULES!\n&gt; \n&gt; With Cyclonus hopefully prepare=\r\nd for a projectile attack Rodimus \ndoes \n&gt; the unexpected. With the aid of =\r\nhis thrusters he comes right at \n&gt; Cyclonus, attempting to spear tackle him=\r\n down.\n\nCyclonus nodded at Rodimus as the ex-Maximal/Autobot commander \nspo=\r\nke. &quot;Rules are important, but not so much that we loose victory.&quot; \nHe smile=\r\nd as Rodimus&#39; missile lock on to him, but then frowned as \nRodimus launched=\r\n himself instead!\n\nWith a quick and roll Cyclonus moved back with the attac=\r\nk, attempting \nto use Rodimus&#39; own momentum against him. As Rodimus made co=\r\nntact \nwith him, Cyclonus went down and back as he came up with a foot, \ntr=\r\nying flip the mech over him. \n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n\n"}}
