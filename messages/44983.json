I barely have any time left to myself anymore, and am \nhaving\n&gt; problems awnsering all the e-mail, espeacially as a council member \n(LN,\n&gt; you make our life very rough). Reading through 80 ooc&#39;s a day about\n&gt; nothing important is getting very tirring as well. I want to say \nthough,\n&gt; it&#39;s been one hell of a ride, I had a lot of fun, and I hope you \nguys\n&gt; can keep it going, and improve it. Just remember to try and be nice \nto\n&gt; new people who join.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to give speacial thank you&#39;s to:\n&gt; \n&gt; Soulstice: For befriending me so easily, and always being around to \ntalk\n&gt; to, for anything from the rpg to wrestling. I&#39;ll miss you budy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kslawdogg: For being the first person to approach me when I joined, \nand\n&gt; help me understand the game, and then for being a good friend for so\n&gt; long throughout it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alloran: I know he probably won&#39;t get this, but I&#39;d like to thank \nhim\n&gt; for supporting me, and also being so friendly when I first joined.\n&gt; \n&gt; Airly: For also being a true friend. I also have a lot of respect \nfor\n&gt; you airly, trying to learn how to play a game like this in a second\n&gt; language. I know how hard it can be to learn another language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yanshosh: I know he may not be able to read it either, but he best\n&gt; represents this rpg. He was an awesome story teller, and I have my \nbest\n&gt; fights with him, as he was always fair, and that made it fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also thanks to everyone who voted for me back at the election, I\n&gt; appreaciated the show of support I received. Again, I had a blast, \nand I\n&gt; am sorry I can&#39;t tie up all my characters, but this letter took me \nthree\n&gt; days to get to. Have fun guys.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: How do I get the rpg to stop sending me mail?\n\n\n"}}
