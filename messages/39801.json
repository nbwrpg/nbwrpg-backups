Very, very, very sorry.  \nThere are some major reasons.  Number one, I was going to schedule the first \nmatches this Monday, but thanks to my brother messing with my computer, I \ncan&#39;t access my archive of e-mails and that kind of had my whole game plan on \nit.  See, I passworded it, but it&#39;s not recognizing my password.  So...I&#39;m \nnot happy.  Also Rdahl has hounded me down since he wants to enter the IGL \nand told me to freeze it J/K\n\nIt&#39;s very late, 1 AM Pacific, my brother being lazy, he&#39;ll attempt to fix my \ncomputer completely.  But even if he does, I still have to reinstall \nRealplayer, RealJukeBox, all my games, and a ton of stuff. Moving files, \nyadda yadda.  So I need to take a little mental break.  I&#39;ll still \nparticipate OOC and IC and work on the IGL thing.  I pretty much have it all \nfigured out, I just need that list that is password protected...and I need to \nspeak with Yan when he gets back from gambling away all his money...errr, I \nmean &quot;Defcon&quot;, about him watching the IGL for any moding.  I noticed some \nstrong characters in a few bios and a few powers concern me ::Is looking at \nRdahl :):: J/K\n\nSo, thanks for all you IGL contestants, I&#39;m very sorry about postponing it, I \ndon&#39;t want to.  I want to start it.  It&#39;s off schedule by two weeks and that \nain&#39;t good.  But, but, so some things can get rolling ya know, if you want a \ncharacter to be in a fight to the death match, e-mail me personally with the \nname of that character(s) who will fight to the death.  Then I will pair them \nup with anyone else who wants to do so.  )\n\nThanks very much -\nL. Unitron\n\n"}}
