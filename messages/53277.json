I&#39;m sick and tired of this \n&gt; question simply being shrugged off (unless I missed the post in which \n&gt; case I apologize)!  Now if you people simply can&#39;t remember this \n&gt; let&#39;s review.  I left a while back.  I said that Cardhead could have \n&gt; Flicker, and Winged Warrior could have Owlhawk.  I came back.  \n&gt; Cardhead told me she couldn&#39;t remember where Flicker was, but hadn&#39;t \n&gt; posted with him in a week so I could take over from whereever I \n&gt; wanted too.  Winged Warrior said roughly the same thing about \n&gt; Owlhawk, except he failed to mention whether or not he had even used \n&gt; Owlhawk, and for that matter if Owlhawk had finished his training \n&gt; with the Mech girl.  Now FOR PETE&#39;S SAKE TELL ME!\n\n\n"}}
