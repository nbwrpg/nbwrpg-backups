Except for maybe \ncomments from the other council members. I shouldn&#39;t say don&#39;t \nreply, cause I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s private, and ONLY if it&#39;s private. \nOccasional OOC&#39;s are encouraged, but spamming them is frowned \nupon.\n\nDewboy, if you send another pointless OOC then I&#39;ll rip off your \nfingers one by one. (j/k... but maybe not) I just thought we&#39;d gotten \nthe OOC posting down to a respectable minimum. (Megan&#39;s post \nabout her b-day was ok, it&#39;s a birthday for gawdssake! and btw, \nMegan isn&#39;t new, you must have missed her posts when you \nweren&#39;t away) 13 of the last 18 messages (when i started typing \nthis one) were you writing OOC&#39;s, and that has to stop. There is a \nmessageboard on the nbwrpg site, use that to spam crap. Do you \nhave a private email, (other than that hotmail address) that you \nacctually check? Cause most of this can easily be put into a \nprivate message sent. I&#39;m not sure why Cyberwolf is acctually \nstanding up for you... you try too hard to make other people angry \nat you. You wonder why people wont stand up for you, or come \nwithin 20 feet, but that is mostly your fault... you seem to push \nthem away (most likely unintentionally). An appropriate anaolgy for \nyour situation would be: You are standing on a single file bridge \naccross a deep gorge, everyone else is walking either before you or \nbehind you, and every so often, to everyone elses horror, you start \nto jump up and down, effectively making them willing to cut off your \nlegs. Your alliance story is asking too much, so don&#39;t count on it. \nWe can probably let you post in a more spaced out time frame. Is \nthere any reason in particular that you can&#39;t post during \n\n1. If you ship has CR chambers it is a base(can cannot be moved). \nIf your ship can hold more than three bots, it is a base(can cannot \nbe moved).\n\n2. There is not currect criteria for a ship, but if you bring in \nsomething ridiculous, like bringing in a medium sized weapon \noutfitted cruiser manned by a single bot, for example. That would \nprobably have to re revamped.\n\n3. Hold the Rocak idea, don&#39;t post anything about it cause the \ncouncil will discuss it. In addition, send us an email privately \ndescribing what it is you want to do.\n\nGTG, I&#39;ll be back later. =)\n\n"}}
