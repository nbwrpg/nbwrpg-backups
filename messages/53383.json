He&#39;s also got an obvious Autobot \n&gt; insignia on his chestplate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotcha!\n&gt; \n&gt; IC: \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: What is that? A tiger-girl? A mutant?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;A transformer, actually.&quot; Wheeljack points out.  He switches his \n&gt; &gt; transmitter for a med-scanner.  &quot;She seems to be okay, just \nknocked \n&gt; &gt; out when the ship hit.&quot;  Looking around, he recalls Ragner&#39;s \nearlier \n&gt; &gt; question.  &quot;I&#39;d say this rig could fly again, with some work.  \nMaybe \n&gt; &gt; this chick could tell us what happened ...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He kneels to examine the pilot more closely, looking for any \ninjuries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Her icy clear blue optics glowed, but remained still. She was not \nalone. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar looked at her quizzically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ragnar: But how can she be a transformer? She looks so different \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; you, and even from Tyrael and his soldiers. My scanner barely \nshow her\n&gt; &gt; on magres, but they show her as red hot on infrared. Why is that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Because, I am a Decepticon,&quot; her deep growl feline femme voice \nstated, as \n&gt; sher slipped her hand under & quickly got up to face her &#39;guests&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics glanced to the 2. Then noticed Wheeljack & his insignia, \nas her \n&gt; optic grew larger with a stunned recognition. &quot;Autobot Wheeljack!&quot; \nshe \n&gt; hissed.  \n&gt; \n&gt; This was NOT how she wished for it all to go. Again, she cursed \nAlpha Trion \n&gt; for reviving her like this.\n\n&quot;Close, but no cigar,&quot; Jackie waggles a finger.  &quot;I&#39;m Wheeljack-X, a \nclone.  The original&#39;s been dead for quite some time.  So why the \nmeteor impression, honey?  What was so worth getting away from on \nCybertron that you jumped into our lap?&quot;\n\nSome people have said that Wheeljack-X isn&#39;t playing with a full \ndeck - and they&#39;re right.\n\n\n"}}
