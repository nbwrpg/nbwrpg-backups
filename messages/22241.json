He decides that in a fight, DrillBit wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; last a second, &quot;And this is my team,&quot; he points to the different \nbots \n&gt; as he lists them, &quot;EndBringer, Demise, Greven, and Scyther.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His team, standing behind him and looking at DrillBit, was very \n&gt; unimpressed so far. They had expected bigger bots, but these looked \n&gt; like the colony bots they were so used to butchering. EndBringer \nand \n&gt; Greven looked at DrillBit with half-threatening expressions. Demise \n&gt; looked at the bot with a neutral face; the beast was hungry. \nScyther, \n&gt; the only one who was as short as DrillBit (or shorter), had a \nneutral \n&gt; expression on his face, looking at KitKat&#39;s &#39;right hand bot&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He gave KitKat a quick questioning glance, at her words.\n&gt; &gt; He held out his hand, offering to shake Killfests hand.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
