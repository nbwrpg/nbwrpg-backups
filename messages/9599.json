She wondered if any of the others felt like they were on a \nsuicide mission like she did.  She wished Scorponok would come to her \nside and tell her that he would fight by her and help her in the \nfight.  But she shook her head.  She knew that he no onger cared for \nher and she would have to fend for herself in this battle.\n\nShe marched along with the others towards the other Pred base.\nShe prayed to the matrix that she would make it out of this fight \nalive.\n\n\n"}}
