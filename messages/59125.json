It would \nsurround the ship, but at only 15 feet away.  It was a foot off the \nground. And it gave a soft hum, but she could barely hear it.  With a \nlittle luck, she had it run off solar power. The had to use one of \nher own small power cells to help store energy while the sun was \ndown.  Her own power levels ran at 75% on a full charge now.  BUt she \nwasn&#39;t worried. So far, she had no clue other bots existed. And if no \nother creatures were like the spindly legged thing she saw earlier, \nthen she&#39;d be fine.\n\nJust on a sheer whim, she opened up her forarm scanners and \nradar. &quot;Hmm, wonder if I&#39;ll pick up anything other than atmospheric \ninterferrence.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The mayday could not be picked up do to the global communications \njamm that was currently in effect.

The sky was \n&gt; brilliant oranges and reds.  She got up, tansformed into bot mode \nand \n&gt; set about making her ship a little more livable.  She found her \nsmall \n&gt; tool kit and started working on fixing the emergency power cells, \nbut \n&gt; they were too far damaged.  She did find her distress beacon.  She \n&gt; pressed it and hoped someday, someone might find her. It gave out a \n&gt; general MAYDAY. But no allience signals. \n&gt; \n&gt; She cleaned up most of the rubble and made a pile of scrap outside \n&gt; the ship.  Next, she went to the console.  Th best she could manage \n&gt; was fixing her chair.  She sat in it and propped her feet up. She \nput \n&gt; her hands behind her head and leaned back.  \n&gt; &quot;Yeah, it won&#39;t be so bad here. A few curtains, a little paint, \nthis \n&gt; might be down right cozy.&quot;  with sarcasm dripping off her tongue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
