He drops her missile launcher, firing two \nmore darts at Teltoli. She had seen her other two darts hit the \nMaximal. The tranquilizer didn&#39;t act instantly, but two darts should \nbe enough to take out a bot twice Teltoli&#39;s size.\n\nStarlight flies back, pulling out Teltoli&#39;s rapier out of her arm. \nOverhead, Fenox flies by, firing down at Teltoli&#39;s head with her \nautomatic rifle.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, steph_teltoli@m... wrote:\n&gt; Teltoli:\n&gt; \n&gt; She flaps her wings to rise her altitude as well, sheathing her \nwhip \n&gt; and pulling out her rapier, flinging it at close range at \nStarlight, \n&gt; straight for her chest. After dodging the two stinger missiles, she \n&gt; gets hit in the wing by two of the dart. Teltoli growls and yanks \n&gt; them out, waiting to see if her sword hit Starlight.\n\n\n"}}
