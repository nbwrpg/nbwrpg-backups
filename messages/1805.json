She was dirty!\n&gt; BrightBlade scanned around and suddenly located just what she needed, a\n&gt; fresh water creek! She smiled to herself and then began to move slowly\naway\n&gt; from the tree and Gangon, she was in much need of a bath!\n&gt; The creek wasn&#39;t to far away from the tree in which Gangon hung, in the\nsame\n&gt; clearing and in clear sight of each spot.\n&gt; She stuck a foot in and then pulled it back, it was COLD!\n&gt; BrightBlade then thought about how dirty she felt and just plain waded in,\n&gt; she clenched her teeth as she wadded in to about waist height.\n&gt; It was a good time to be thankful that her circuits were waterproof!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 72% off on Name brand Watches!\n&gt; Come and buy today and get free shipping!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4011/10/_/_/_/958720091/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
