He knew most of the base, but he hadn&#39;t taken the time to \n&gt; &gt; totally memorize the inner parts of the base. He&#39;d arrive at the \n&gt; &gt; control center. It was just a matter of when. (heh a delay post \n=p)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo! Terms of \nService. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
