I could so faint right now.&quot;=\r\n\n\nHe catches his breath as he wipes off his forehead.\n\n&quot;I hope the rest of =\r\nour team&#39;s havn&#39; as much good luck as we&#39;re having.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Uproar get=\r\ns the command to go after the intruder and can hardly wait to pounce and ma=\r\nul his enemy.  With a roar, he replies.\n\n&quot;You got it Sir!  Consider this cr=\r\neep as good as junk!&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Tucson too, approaches the ninja intruder=\r\n, and ignores that little warning about his energy reserves going low.  He =\r\nhad dealt with intruders of the dark many times, and being visually impaire=\r\nd, he knew how to unlock their secrets of steath.  He nodds to Legacy&#39;s rep=\r\nly.\n\n&quot; Understood Legacy.&quot;\n\nHe replies with a silent message over the com l=\r\nink, to keep himself from making any noise.  He switches his sonar systems =\r\nto conscentrate on the intruder.  He was very close now.  His blips getting=\r\n stronger.  With Hydras not too far behind, he realized he had to do what h=\r\ne had pulled on the old abandoned base while working with Lord Perseus.    =\r\nWhen in doubt, resort to isolation.  He concentrates, listens, and decipher=\r\ns that the ninja is within his range, in the same area.  The dark was his e=\r\nlement as well, as he soon finds a manual control to shut the doors sealing=\r\n himself and the ninja inside.  With a narrow of his brow, he slaps his han=\r\nd against it, and then, waits to see if it works.  \n\nHis intent was clear, =\r\nhe wanted that ninja.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, this is Tucson.  I&#39;ve approached the area =\r\nwhere the intruder is located.  I&#39;m hoping the doors close properly to ensu=\r\nre capture.  I sense this enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting=\r\n Uproar and Leo ll in grave danger, I will take on the intruder personally.=\r\n  He has crossed the line in my envronment, and it&#39;s time he pays the price=\r\n by someone who is as versed in stealth as he is.  I ask you to call back U=\r\nproar and Leo ll to prevent further harm to them.&quot;\n\nHis optics narrow.  He =\r\ndraws Straight Shot in his hands, to begin his little game of cat and mouse=\r\n.  \n\nOutside the Ark, Night Shift quickly transforms and charges the enemy =\r\nwith a plasma riffle in hand, firing rounds, hoping to strike at least Scou=\r\nrge or Cyclonus, in hopes to disable them.\n\n&quot; We got some serious bolts ta =\r\npick with you punks!&quot;\n\nRat Trap also fires his own weaponry.\n\n&quot;Yeah!

He could still smell something familliar, and enemy.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Whoever was in this area, is still here, I can smell &#39;em. They&#39;re no=\r\nt too far off. Question is, who and what are we dealing with?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Uproar and Leo II are both pacing and sniffing their senses on hyper al=\r\nert. Who ever it is, there are skilled at keeping themselves hidden and hid=\r\ning their scent. But even with that there is the faint odor of Predacon or =\r\neven Unicronian in the air, it is coming from down the hall in the directio=\r\nn from where they had come. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita lowered her ears an=\r\nd said &quot;He almost caught me, dad... I&#39;m not so strong... He said that he wi=\r\nll come back for me... And I couldt stop him... What if he hurts mom trying=\r\n to caught me... Lord Elder!!!!! He&#39;s Hurt, badly hurt.... Daddy!!!

It is time to have a few words with=\r\n him.&quot; There was old confidence in Rodimus&#39; voice again as he stood tall an=\r\nd protective over his young daughter. &quot;Ramulus, go with them. I want him ca=\r\nptured!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor tried to cut of the main lead=\r\n, stop the explosion and save the ark!!!!!!! Then He yellss in pain, what e=\r\nver Tucson have done, it really hurted. but Overcoming the pain contined wo=\r\nrking and trying to insolate the Autobots and decepticons from the main mes=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Perceptor worked Legacy also struggled to keep differ=\r\nent systems online, rerouting power from one system to the next. There were=\r\n times when they were successful, but there were also many other times wHer=\r\ne sparks flew because a system was either shorted out or the fluctuation tr=\r\nipped some sort of breaker, causing cascading power failures. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Intere=\r\nsting.&quot; Legacy intoned as obviously like Perpector his acute senses were be=\r\ning similarly affected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. &quot;The bridge seems largely unaff=\r\nected by Tuscon&#39;s barrage. It must because it has shielding in place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the ark, Tucson=\r\n holds his position and his wave. A look of sheer determination floods his =\r\nface. He had not answered Kup right away, but needed not to, as his body la=\r\nngauge fortells that of a determined Autobot, sworn to duty, and prepared t=\r\no go as much distance as needed. In the midsts of the wave, he picks up a b=\r\nlip. He detects the intruder inside, and with that wave, pinpoints his loca=\r\ntion. Yet, he wasn&#39;t about to tell anyone what he&#39;d be up to next. With tra=\r\nnsmission still underway, he approaches the ark calmly, with an alert strid=\r\ne to his walk. The only one who would know what he&#39;d be up to, would be Leg=\r\nacy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Legacy, my sonar systems have picked up the intruder. I know =\r\nof his location and I&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to =\r\ntransmit. Can you give me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;One moment.&quot; Legacy replied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the front=\r\n door to the Ark began to slowly slide open. &quot;You should have complete acce=\r\nss to the Ark, as does everyone else.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon moved forward though =\r\nlow energy reserve alarm signals began to go off in Tuson&#39;s head. His wound=\r\ns, his own energy loss over his trip back finally beginning to catch up wit=\r\nh him. While his wounds were bound so he leaked no further energy, he had y=\r\net to get to a recharging chamber, and the tremendous amounts of energy tha=\r\nt he was putting out to maintain his wave was further depleting his already=\r\n low energy reserves.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Owww.. That wave is re=\r\nally hurting my relays.. Wait a sec, my radars are picking up activity all =\r\nover the place. We need ta amplify that wave of yours.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson look=\r\ns down to her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power already Straight Shot. Unless of =\r\ncourse, Legacy can rig up an amplifier within the Ark to supplement my sona=\r\nr attack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is =\r\nStraight Shot, I&#39;m asking a favor on Tucsons behalf. His waves are strong e=\r\nnough to pick up enemy forces in wide range, but he wants to take it up a n=\r\notch and see if he can immobilize them at a further range. Kind of put them=\r\n in a stall for now. Can you set up an amplifier signal to merge with Tucso=\r\nn&#39;s sonar system? It would be greatly appreciated.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy&#39;=\r\ns cold voice can be heard over Tuscon&#39;s radio, &quot;Many of the Ark&#39;s systems a=\r\nre also being affected by the wave you are transmitting. At the moment Perc=\r\neptor and I are minimizing the damage by reallocating power from down syste=\r\nms to the few that are still running. I have no resources available to comp=\r\nly with your request.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Night Shift ca=\r\ntches something on his radar, and begins to pick up a little speed, buzzing=\r\n a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunting dog fixated on it&#39;s target.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; H=\r\nello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;S A PRED SIGNATURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;re not far from =\r\nour targets Kup, I can feel &#39;em!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap too, senses them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s right! I got the pred signature and it&#39;s locked&#39;n loaded! Ohhh Whee=\r\nls was right! He was right! They&#39;re still here!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap gets a ho=\r\nld of Rodimus and the others at the Ark.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap ta base!=\r\n Ya won&#39;t believe it, but Wheels was right on the money this time! They&#39;re =\r\nout here, and I bet they&#39;re around the other parameters too! Keep your sens=\r\nors out for &#39;em, &#39;cause ya never know what those creeps are gonna be up to.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Back at the Ark, outside, Tucson holds for word, but with sonars =\r\nat full blast, he picks up activity happening all around the Ark. He narrow=\r\ns his optics dangerously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and seek... Bee=\r\nn there, done that a million times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I know you&#39;re out t=\r\nhere.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Keep in mind, it was ONLY the intruder inside the Ark w=\r\nho&#39;s stealth shielding went down. Blackrazor has an active shield that was =\r\ndisrupted by Tuscon&#39;s wave. The Sweep&#39;s stealth is of a different sort and =\r\nat the moment is unaffected by it. However that is water under the bridge w=\r\nith unfolding events :)\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC: \n&gt; \n&gt; As the Maximals creep forward in an=\r\n attempt to locate the Predacons, Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont touch the ark but ATTACK=\r\n THE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Six sweeps fly into the air, followed by their=\r\n leader Scourge! As soon as they leave the vicinity of Hydras, the Predacon=\r\n leader looses the advantage of their stealth and immediately begins showin=\r\ng up on Maximal radar screens! However the sweeps still maintain their stea=\r\nlth, and only those who can physically see them are aware of them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nth a viciousness all their own, they begin to open fire on the Maximals!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Tuscon receives a call from Legacy, &quot;Tuscon, I am receiving readings of =\r\na single Predacon in your area, his IFF signal identifying him as Hydras.&quot; =\r\nAlthough there was a certain level of urgency in his voice, Legacy was stil=\r\nl calm and reserved as he made his tranmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Back inside the =\r\nArk the intruder frowned as he realized that his bomb had not gone off. Wit=\r\nh a whispered curse he continued to try to adapt his stealth shielding to T=\r\nuscon&#39;s wave. With a worried look he began to run down the hall, if he coul=\r\ndn&#39;t sneak out, he would BLAST his way out!\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
