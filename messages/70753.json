He gestured to Hydras\n&gt; as the drones began to lead him down the hall.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; hydras started to walk ready for anything while he send a secret mesage \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; MAxima &quot;Be ready, I have a bad feelinga bout this&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras began to walk the door behind him slid shut, plunging him\n&gt; and his three companions into near darkness for a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BZZZZT!!&gt; &lt;BZZZZT!&gt; It would also seem that any communications have\n&gt; been cut off. At the moment it would seem that Hydras is unable to\n&gt; communicate with the outside, and that would of course include Maxima\n&gt; as well as Injector and the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; As this happened at the far end of the hall a door opened and a voice\n&gt; could be heard as Hydras approached, &quot;Well well My dear Hydras I could\n&gt; not have you talking about anything behind our backs now could I?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The voice is  genteel yet sarcastic as it spoke, &quot;It is so good to see\n&gt; you have made it, you and your . . . um friends there.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras got to the door he could see the interior of what would\n&gt; appear to be a large room, monitors and computer stations lining the\n&gt; walls. A tall figure hovered near the center of the room, next to what\n&gt; would at first glance appear to be a throne. The figure seemed to be\n&gt; draped in shadows, its dark armor almost exuding cold darkness and\n&gt; threatening evil. It floated a few inches from the floor, helicoptor\n&gt; type blades spinning at its shoulder blades were holding it aloft. Its\n&gt; cold red optics turned to look at Hydras as he, inferno, Buzzsaw and\n&gt; Terrorgator came to the door.\n&gt;\n&gt; However it is obvious that it was the figure on the throne itself that\n&gt; had been doing the talking, and the throne turned and the figure of\n&gt; Cryotek turned to greet Hydra, &quot;It has been a long time, yesss.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Cryotek was BW&#39;s Megatron&#39;s teacher and mentor. I would imaging\n&gt; that since Hydras is part Galvatron and part Megatron, the Megatron\n&gt; side of him should recognize him. Although they have not seen each\n&gt; other in quite some time. heh heh heh BWHAHAHAHAHAHA &gt;:)\n&gt;\n&gt; http://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Cryotek\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
