She wanted to tell him about \nDestructor, but thought better of it. &quot;I just wanted you to know that \nI have talked to Aracnia and she agrees, we will add Megatron to our \ncouncil. But he will be taking all the risks. WE will let him fight \nthe maximals and not use you or the others. I can&#39;t risk you or the \nother unless the risks are worth it. And right now, they aren&#39;t. &quot;\n\nShe looked into his eyes and wished she had never fallen for him. Now \nshe was torn in a three way tie between her pack, Drillbit and \nDestructor. And what made it worse, was she afraid for all three.\n\n&quot;I will meet with Megatron in two days and get things settled between \nus. Then, we will finish the war.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He was finally able to make it inside.
