The flight wasn�t as bad as she had previously \nthought, and despite her rather negative attitude towards anything that \ninvolved her feet leaving the ground, she was actually enjoying herself. The \nsky was painted a deep, rich black amidst a nest of stars and various \ncreatures of the night. She breathed deeply, something she tended to do when \nshe was in pleasant surroundings. She had come a long way since she first \njoined the forces.\n\nDespite her many failings she had triumphed in the face of adversity more \ntimes than she could remember. Her past was a blur of weapons fire and \nbattle, marked with the occasional �bot who had made such an impact on her \nlife that she cared to remember them at all. She always had trouble \nremembering things, but them, those �bots, she would never forget. The more \nshe thought about it the more she realized just how much Dinobot meant to \nher. He was a friend, a battling companion that could best her in almost any \nmatch. Only a few had been better than her, and Dinobot was one of them. Her \nears swiveled back in order to hear his reply. So, she did make a \ndifference. That was all she needed to hear.\n\nPerhaps there was a bit of emotion in his voice, but that could just be \nwishful thinking. However, perhaps she had finally been able to crack his \nrough exterior, but who was she kidding? He�d never see her as more than a \nfriend, no matter how she saw him. She had to admit, he wasn�t that bad as \n�bots went. He was definitely loyal, not to mention caring, in his own \nspecial way that is:\n\n&quot;I suppose we all make a difference.&quot;\n\nShe knew he had made a difference in her life, but whether it would be more \nthan that was up to him. She wasn�t going to push him into anything. She was \ncontent with being able to talk to him without ending up in a screaming \nmatch. Tavatron shifted herself so that her right leg was bent and her left \none was hanging over the edge of Necromancer�s back. She leaned back until \nshe was laying with her wolven head resting on her arms.\n\nShe looked up at the sky, searching the stars for any familiar sparks. She \nhad lost so many friends� but she would never forget them. That much she was \nsure of. With a final sigh she continued to search the heavens, wondering \nwhat would become of her, of all the warriors, once there were no more \nbattles to be fought and no more wars to be won. When the time came she \nwould know, until then she would be content to lay here and gaze skyward:\n\n&quot;It�s a beautiful night.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
