One that has nagged me for a day or so now but\nI keep forgetting to ask it. Why did you change Tuscon&#39;s motiff or\nsignature?\n\nWhen he was Tuscon in the begining he had sonar attacks, and even when\nhe was converted to his Prime form he kept that style. But when you\nconverted him to Drgon you gave him fire, which is a departure from\nwhat he was.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Rodimus already has a fire motiff, and now you\nwill kind of have two of them running around. :)\n\nWhy not give Tuscon a sonic breath attack rather than fire? Keep in\nmind, not all dragons had a fire attack. Sonics would go along better\nwith what he was. It would still be a very powerful attack. Look at\nthe Combaticon Brawl, who actually has a similar personality to Tuscon\nI think - but he has an ear splitting 300-decibel bursts of\nconcentrated sound as well as a 10-Megawatt electron gun, which would\nbe a lightning breath attack as well?? (although you can&#39;t use them\nboth together)\n\nAnd you also have Thundercracker as an example who had a sonic boom\nattack that can be heard for 200 miles. Sonic attacks are very\neffective weapons and then it would make sense that someone could hear\nTuscon&#39;s roar hundreds of miles away.\n\nIt would be different from fire, but I think it would be a lot more in\nkeeping with who Tuscon was as he was more of a sound based figure\nrather than a fire based one. He wouldn&#39;t neccessarilly have the sonar\nand all the other special stuff, but one could see how he shifted over\nand where he came from.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
