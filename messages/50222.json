But you must understand that we Clansmen hold \ntightly to honor. Before we enter your group, you will have to prove \nyour worth in battle.\n\nKatya: Therefore, I challenge you, Owlhawk, in a fist fight. The best \nwarrior will win, and the loser shall go with the winner.\n\nIt was obviously a move that belied the Clanners&#39;s will to follow the \nMaximals. Their honor code would not permit them to follow one who has \nnot proven himself. Katya was fast, but she seemed to be no match for \nOwlhawk. Still, she was a warrior born, a trueborn. She could still \nwin, but it was unlikely.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Rodimus Prime::\n&gt; \n&gt; He takes the information in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We also protect this planet from our enimies.
