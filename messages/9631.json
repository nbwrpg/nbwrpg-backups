She wondered if any of the others felt like they were on \na\n&gt; &gt; suicide mission like she did.  She wished Scorponok would come to \nher\n&gt; &gt; side and tell her that he would fight by her and help her in the\n&gt; &gt; fight.  But she shook her head.  She knew that he no onger cared \nfor\n&gt; &gt; her and she would have to fend for herself in this battle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She marched along with the others towards the other Pred base.\n&gt; &gt; She prayed to the matrix that she would make it out of this fight\n&gt; &gt; alive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
