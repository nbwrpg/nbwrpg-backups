Hydras appeared? How could it be? It \n&gt; was a electronic puppet what was identically Hydras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the same idea as Megatron of Beast Wars, Perceptor did one \n&gt; to Hydras for one ocation as this. The control was simple: the chair \n&gt; picked up the signals of his torso and legs and send them to the \n&gt; puppet to move it. some special &quot;Gloves&quot; picked the signal of his \n&gt; arms and hands, and as the &quot;Chair&quot; sent it to the puppet. A Special \n&gt; helmet trasmited to receptor what the puppet see and heard and a \n&gt; microphone let receptor sent his voice to the puppet.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;AS you see &quot;hissed Hydras&quot;I was keeping this little puppet for \n&gt; ocattions of this... Now here are my commands: YOu Inferno and \n&gt; QuickStrike will follow this puppet and will act as normally, as if \n&gt; this thing is me...
