I was just going with my own storylines, I wasn&#39;t trying\nto make everyone cease fire or anything like that. Technosis wasn&#39;t\nimportant to anyone, I thought, but Chordate is such a powerful figure, that\nit&#39;s easy to cause havoc by doing something like that. Understand now?\nDeemos taking Technosis captive didn&#39;t insure a victory for the CHosen Ones,\nhe just wanted to leave there with Technosis, no problem. If the Alliance\nleft with Chordate, would there be a problem with that? If so, then we have\nthe hostage crisis all over again, except that unitron will probably fool\neveryone into going to the Alliance base and stuff to kill them all. And if\nthere wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Well, Chordate will die. Tarantopulous isn&#39;t\nabout to give up something he believes in, so he keeps firing. CHordate\nmeans nothing to him. You see?...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Yanshosh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 8:20 PM\nSubject: Re: Battle at the Cybertronian Fire\n\n\n&gt; Soulstice, chill. Look at yourself before blaiming others.
