She checked \nher scanner and sure enough, there was a maximal signature standing \nright infront of her. She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle slightly. &quot;Oh \nplease, by all mean, infultrate the maximal base and find out all you \ncan, then bring the info back to me. Just becareful. These maximals \nare not dumb. They are smart, very smart. Watch your back.&quot;\n\nShe really didn&#39;t think he needed to hear that, but she felt like it \nshould be said.  They didn&#39;t know the maximals and she wanted to be \naware of the enimy that they would face. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; Sorry for lack of detail, the bell rang and I GTG.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ::Killfest/Scyther::\n&gt; \n&gt; Killfest nods. &quot;A bot into their base?
