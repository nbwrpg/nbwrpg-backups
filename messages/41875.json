(Chokes the \nhell out of the WWF. Turns around and chokes the hell out of Test) &gt;&gt;\n\n(I recall many a match they have lost.  But no, all four of those WWF members \nyou listed would still talent even if they lost every match against the \n&#39;Alliance&#39;, coincidentally a name for two major evils IRL and IC :).  \nAlliance members have no talent, save the WWF superstars that went over to \nit.  They pretty much have no charisma, the WWF superstars do.  Tajiri alone \nis more colorful than every WCW combined, save Booker T.  Booker T. has some, \nbut with moves like the spinerooni, to me, he&#39;s just a joke.  Especially \nsince he&#39;s copying the rock bottom and giving it some name like the &quot;book \nin&quot;.  How the hell does Booker come up with such lame names?  Good Leppard...\n\nWatching WCW on cable, when it was on, caused me to fall asleep.  Good \nLeppard, how it was boring.  Bringing in those wrestlers who did no \ninteresting moves.  The announcers were as irritating as Paul Heyman&#39;s voice. \n The referees were as bland as the WCW &#39;superstars&#39;.  That&#39;s why it should&#39;ve \nbeen called &quot;We Can&#39;t Wrestle&quot;.\n\n&quot;Robert Van Dam is a rising athlete.&quot;  Sorry, but I don&#39;t like wrestlers \nbeing shoved down my throat to try and make me like them.  It&#39;s bad enough \nhis costume sucks, much like all of the WCW and its intros.  Heh, probably \nthe best fighter in the Alliance is Shane O&#39;Mac and that&#39;s because he&#39;s WWF \nmaterial. \n\nThe Rock is the greatest wrestler ever.  He isn&#39;t shoved down people&#39;s \nthroats, he has more charisma than anyone, he&#39;s funny, and best of all, he&#39;s \ngot killer moves and could kick anyone&#39;s ass in real life.  I know someone \nmight say &quot;the Rock is being crammed down my throat&quot; so I just wanted to say \nthat.  Anyone who disagrees is just plain in the grip of idiocy.\n\nHas there ever been a good WCW coming over to the WWF?  Not really.  The \nRadicalz? Nah.  Benoit, Guerrero, and that fat guy who kept acting like a \nCasa Nova, no.  Perry Saturn...he&#39;s not a good wrestler but he&#39;s funny with \nhis insane act.  We needed someone to replace Al Snow in that department.\n\nECW has had several good wrestlers come over.  Tazz, Rhyno, and the Dudley \nBoyz.  But the Alliance still sucks.  That&#39;s why the script had WWF \nsuperstars go over there.  WCW losers fighting the WWF?  Ha!  Kane and \nUndertaker could take &#39;em all out.  \n\nBooker T&#39;s been WCW champion five times?  Wow.  Rock&#39;s been WWF champion six \ntimes.  And a WWF title is worth five WCW titles.  I had an earlier \nconversation about this over IM, wish I&#39;d saved it so I could just copy and \npaste.)\n\n- L. Unitron    \n\n"}}
