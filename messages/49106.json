This means \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that if the scans I asked are positive, we\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raid one of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; base. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Our objective here is not to eradicate our\n&gt; enemy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only to pinpoint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their position, if they are truly here.\n&gt; However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if I am right, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be two bases.

He took no time to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transform to robot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mode. His right arm consisted of the flailing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tendrils that had ripped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pod in two. His left arm was normal looking.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stood only 8 feet \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up, but his strength was undeniable. What was\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing was the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; absence of eyes or optics sensors. The bot was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Burrock: You Tyrael? Who&#39;s that guy?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tyrael: Yes, I am Major Tyrael (he insisted on \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Major). This is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lieutenant Shadow Star, second in command of\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group. We are the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tripredacus Strikers, and our mission here is to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find and neutralize \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megatron. We were about to mount a raid. I think\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will function \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well with Shadow Star.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Burrock: Yeah, whatever.
