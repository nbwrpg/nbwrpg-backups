And it wouldnt be a base, \nmore of a shuttle. Besides, you moved the Allience base, in peices of \nwhatever, and now are burying it. Thats moving it. So, in that case, I will \ntake apart Aracnias ship, move it to the coast, and build it from there. And \nif you still think im moding thats just too bad. You cna go ahead and make a \npoll if you want too. But, you locked yourself on an island, with a \ntremendous ship, (and what was that rule about super chars agian?), and all \nthese defences....so tell me, how would I be able to fight you? Also, it \nseems a little unfair you know my plan when you werent even in the room with \nmy guys.\n\n"}}
