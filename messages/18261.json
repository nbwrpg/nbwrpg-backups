I \ndon&#39;t see where this is right, but for some reason, that&#39;s the way it \nis. I merely pointed out that he fired many, many times in one post. \nFor once, I tried to fire 2 missiles plus 4 laser shots per post, and \nI was told it was illegal, that is why I do not understand why I am \nin so much trouble. I apologize to Lord Unitron is I offended him, \nbut I do not apologize for saying what I do not think is fair. Why am \nI treated so differently here anyway? Is it because my posts are not \nas interesting? Please, tell me what you people have against me! Is \nit that my bots don&#39;t die enough? That I attack everyone&#39;s bases or \nstand up for myself? What is wrong?...\n\n\n"}}
