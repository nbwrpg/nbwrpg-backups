She now had Megatron, her \nonce feared leader and made him an ally. Aracnia was now her ally as \nwell.  She knew that once the Allince was gone, the coucil would take \nover earth.  But Destructor kept after her about the maximals.  Why \ndid he feel that they needed the maximals? Were they not thier \nenemies?  She couldn&#39;t fathom the reason why he would want to make an \nallience with the maximals.  She planned to  pull him aside and ask \nhim.  But something else preyed on her mind. This Gabreil, he had \nmentionted that her and Destructor would spread the Predacon Empire \nacross the galaxy.  She wasn&#39;t sure, but in order for that to happen, \nsomething would have had to have happened to Drillbit. That thought \nsend a shiver up her spine. \n\nShe walked down the hall, still pondering about all this.\n\n\n"}}
