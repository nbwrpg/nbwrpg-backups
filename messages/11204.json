His arms hold her close to him, Prowl inhaling her scent. His eyes \nsoften as he looks at her, hearing her question, and knowing that his plans \nwould have to wait.\n\n&quot;Yeah. The Ark was attacked again. Its currently falling apart. Brooder and \nArcangel have a plan for it, we need to meet them at the conference room.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Iron Raptor, his arms tightening around her. She was the bot he \nloved, the femm he wanted to be with all the time, but duty called.\n\n&quot;Shall we go, then?&quot; he asks, looking at her with undying love in his optics.\n\n"}}
