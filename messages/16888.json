She knew that if this bot was under Prebon, she \n&gt; would have to be nice to him.

She hugged herself \n&gt; &gt; while \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting in the corner.  She wondered why she even gave a care \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Striker.  But she knew that he was gone forever.  She \nremembered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking to Prebon and giving herself up for Striker&#39;s release \n&gt; &gt; without \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a chip.  She then felt a surge as the chip on her straightened \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her programs again.  She stopped crying and wiped her face with \n&gt; her \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hands.  She slowly got up to her feet and walked over the door \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and watched Prebon and Slayer. She smiled and knew that is was \n&gt; now \n&gt; &gt; &gt; her place to serve Prebon and to make him happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She walked down and went to Prebon.
