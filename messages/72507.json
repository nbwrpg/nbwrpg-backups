I don&#39;t know what\n&gt; went off half cocked..  But all I think of that I can say..  Is if they&#39;re\n&gt; true we can but pray.  For if done by our own side..  Can things be made\n&gt; worse than taken out of Grimlock&#39;s hide?  For to have fought for so long..\n&gt; Then locked up and forced to pay a penance when he did no wrong.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He had heard the rumors, on different ends, of how many of the Autobot\n&gt; veterans had quietly faded away at the end of the war.  OR even worse, how\n&gt; mysteriously many of the higher ranking Autobots had been casualties in teh\n&gt; chaos after it.\n&gt;\n&gt; To this day, despite his endless memorials and nearly Primus-beaific state..\n&gt;\n&gt; No one could say what had been the fate of Optimus Prime.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nYes, no one could say what happened to OPTIMUS PRIME, the first one.\nOh there had been others he had taken on his name and mantle, there\nhad been a second OPTIMUS and even an OPTIMUS PRIMAL, but the first\nlegendary incarnation of OPTIMUS has been missing. Most thought he was\ndead, killed in a war that seemed to end so long ago. Others thought\nhe gave his life to end the hate plague, lying in a memorial tomb\nendlessly floating through space. Other thought he had risen since\nthen and is still waging a war against the forces of evil somewhere in\nthe galaxy.\n\nThe truth was far different.\n\nRODIMUS PRIME turned and looked around the room as his internal memory\nproccessors strove to recover his fragmented memory of recent events.\n&quot;I remember the rumors that Grimlockj and his team had to be\nre-educated.&quot; His optics brightened, &quot;But I had no idea that it would\nhave meant incarceration. A lot of us had trouble adjusting to\npeaceful life, but being locked up.&quot;\n\nShaking his head RODIMUS finally rose to his feet as he disengaged\nfrom the medbed. &quot;We have to find them.&quot; RODIMUS said, &quot;We need to see\nwhat has been done to them.&quot; RODIMUS began to pace across the room,\n&quot;If there are attacking Autobots or Maximals, then I think something\nhas happened to them.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
