In the movie half of the Matrix was used to defeat Unicron. Then in \nThe Return of Optimus Prime Optimus used the other half to destroy the hate \nplague that was causing all those affected to go insane and blasting those \nwho weren&#39;t infected and infecting them. The shell of the Matrix was then \nused and destroyed in another episode of G1, the reason for doing so I don&#39;t \nrecall but in G1 the matrix of leadership was eventually gone.\n\n"}}
