He&#39;s been with Hydras (preds) and Perseus\n(maximals). He and a few others just stole a shuttle from the\npacificus maximals.  Even on beastwars he started as a pred, but\nrefused to follow megatron and joined the maximals.  When he was\nkilled and resurrected in transmetal 2 form, he was once again a pred.\n Dinobot has realy never been loyal to any faction exclusively.\n\nAs for the factions we have 3 predicon and 2 maximal factions.  The\nwatchers are neutral and not to receptive to strangers visiting them.\nPreston got the descriptions mostly right.  For more, check out the\nwiki.\n\n-Kraftlos\n\nOn 12/25/07, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- mattwo7 &lt;Matfour@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; TBH I only have 2 questions, why is Dinobot a pred and what is with\n&gt; &gt; all the factions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello :)\n&gt;\n&gt; As to why Dinobot is a Pred, I will leave that to the player who\n&gt; controls that character.\n&gt;\n&gt; As to the factions, I will try to explain it, and will let others\n&gt; correct me as they see fit! :)\n&gt;\n&gt; As I see it you generally have two standard factions (well 3 but we\n&gt; will get to that later) - Maximals and Predicons. The Autobots have the\n&gt; basic ethos of &quot;Peace is the right of all sentient beings&quot; while the\n&gt; Decepticons are about &quot;Peace through tyranny!&quot; or &quot;Might makes right!&quot;.\n&gt; However there are variations on each theme.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you look at the Wiki site (which I encourage you to do) under the\n&gt; subsection summary and setting which kind of gives you a break down.\n&gt;\n&gt; (I have grafted these from the site. please read them there in their\n&gt; entirety)\n&gt;\n&gt; You have at least two versions of predacon : BUSHIDO PREDACONS who\n&gt; believe that preserving the peace will allow them to grow strong for\n&gt; the little while they still have before the Minions start an all-out\n&gt; war. their leader is Spire. And IRON SKULL PREDACONS who believe that\n&gt; Maximals are weak and they would rather take over the lead from the\n&gt; Maximals and act right now. Their leader is Jotunn.\n&gt;\n&gt; You also have at least two versions of Maximal: PACIFICUS MAXIMALSwho\n&gt; believe that peace is the only way everybody can focus on the efforts\n&gt; against the Minions. Their leader is Perseus. While you also have the\n&gt; SILVER WINGS MAXIMALS who are convinced that the Predacons are\n&gt; preparing a revolution and that they want to prepare a strike against\n&gt; them. They think they should take them all out before things get rough.\n&gt; Their leader is Razorwing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there are THE WATCHERS who look to me to still be Maximals but\n&gt; take in members from other factions like Predacons. This faction is\n&gt; dedicated to the monitoring of the Minions. They are crafty and swift,\n&gt; and they are renowned Minion-killers at times. Their skills also\n&gt; include diplomacy, however, as members of any factions can join the\n&gt; Watchers. Their leader is Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there are the Minions of Unicron, generally called either Minions\n&gt; or Unicronians. Their apparent goal is to turn the Earth into a ripe\n&gt; feeding ground for Unicron. Unicron realizing that the energon present\n&gt; on Earth was too powerful for him to absorb right away, left minions\n&gt; behind to keep an eye on Earth until the crystals were ripe for his\n&gt; taking. (Remember how the crystals originally interfered with Maximals\n&gt; & Predacons, and they couldn&#39;t stay in robot mode?) Up until recently a\n&gt; sort of Cold War was raging between the Unicronians and the\n&gt; Cybertronians however with the arrival of Cyclonus, Scourge and the\n&gt; sweeps, and the addition of several new warriors this cold war\n&gt; threatens to explode into something more. They are led by Vorpal, a\n&gt; powerful villain who&#39;s full abilities have yet to be revealed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope this helps, and I am sure the others will give corrections and\n&gt; expansions as well. Also Please read what is on the Wiki site, and\n&gt; explore the different links. There is ALOT of information there -\n&gt; Pictures of some of the bases, who leads, facts about the characters,\n&gt; the history and much more.\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and\n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
