There&#39;s a rule \n&gt; &gt; against making your chars too big.  Anyway, average G1 size is \n&gt; closer \n&gt; &gt; to 20 feet tall than 40.  You&#39;re talking about a character nearly \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; size of some gestalts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Umm.. Not from the stats that I know. Raksha&#39;s site even has a pretty \n&gt; good set up of sizes. Megatron himself is 39 feet in height. \n&gt; BMs are half the size of Gen 1.\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to get Maxima to revert back to her Gen 1 style. \n to rebuilt my old form, correct?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
