WELL ANYWHO STOP THE FUCKING OOC&#39;s\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;dewboy30816&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Guess what I found out that even though the Netscape browser \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work on my computer anymore the Microsoft one is still \nhere. \n&gt; I&#39;m glad when I decided that 2 browsers was a silly idea I seem to \n&gt; have missed this copy.  Also you guys complain that the new \n&gt; transformers alters stuff like what the Matrix is and cybertron \n&gt; having an organic core.  Well do we listen to that guy who said an \n&gt; atom was like &quot;plum pudding&quot; (dang it I&#39;m making myself hungry \nnow).  \n&gt; NO we listen to the modernday version that has better equipment to \n&gt; build on old theories.  Also I think the organic creatures probably \n&gt; were brought to Cybertron as a beatification project (and early \n&gt; experiments with DNA scanners I know some bot in transformers \nlooked \n&gt; like animals but it wasn&#39;t convincing just similar and I doubt it \n&gt; served the purpose of protecting them from energon), but I...I...I \n&gt; AGREE WTIH LN THERE I SAID IT!  NightScream suggested that &quot;some \nbot \n&gt; decided you weren&#39;t worth keeping around&quot; (he was talking to the \nbat \n&gt; sceleton he got his DNA from) and I think that after what LN \n&gt; suggested happened the Quasacons wiped out the animals, but they \nhad \n&gt; already become to much a part of Cybertron to just vanish so there \n&gt; souls (don&#39;t say they don&#39;t exist if sparks exist souls aren&#39;t a \n&gt; question) took on the form of organic core and took over Vector \nSigma \n&gt; altering it&#39;s nature.  The Matrix by this time had come close \nenough \n&gt; to expanding into heaven and had become so much smarter and \nuniversal \n&gt; it saw this was for the best and let it be.  It explains why a \n&gt; computer so bent on making Cybertron Technorganic had a weapon that \n&gt; only worked against organics.  I DID IT!  I DID THE UNTHINKABLE!  I \n&gt; LOGICALLY MELDED THE 3 SERIES TOGETHER! Well naturally BW and BM \nwere \n&gt; already together, but, I MELDED G1 TO THEM!  NO ONE CAN PENALIZE ME \n&gt; FOR THIS OOC BECAUSE IT COULD BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL THING I EVER \n&gt; POSTED (the ONLY OOC I ever posted that actually affected anything \n&gt; although I&#39;m sure SOME of my ICs MUST HAVE influenced SOMETHING)!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; My personal theory is that the Transformers tried to become more \n&gt; like humans. \n&gt; &gt; Remember in G1 during FFoD The quintessons were not too happy \nabout \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; humans helping the autobots because they were starting to act and \n&gt; think like \n&gt; &gt; them, thus becoming unpredictable, where as the Decepticons were. \nI \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; maybe in their efforts to become somewhat more human like \nsomething \n&gt; happened \n&gt; &gt; between Cybertron and Earth, something really bad and thus Earth \n&gt; was made a \n&gt; &gt; restricted area of space for cybertronians. Thats my two cents \n&gt; anyway.\n\n\n"}}
