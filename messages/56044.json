She could feel the gentle hand of a bot \nstroking her head.  It took a bit of effort, but she managed a weak \nsmile. She sighed softly, feeling no more pain and feeling much \nbetter, exhausted, but better. She slowly opened her optics and \nlooked up at Blackfang. She whispered, &quot;thank you.&quot; and closed her \noptics again.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blackfang leaned his back against a wall and started to chuckle. He\n&gt; was exhausted from the stress, but at least this beauty was safe \nnow.\n&gt; He decided she would recover better in CR.\n&gt; \n&gt; He came closer to her and stroked her head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Can you hear me? Are you still conscious?\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
