Their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attacks were nothing to be worried about, but it still added to \nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspicions about Unitron and company. His eyes glance over to \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scanner reports, watching something develop fairly close to\n&gt; &gt; Alliance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; island. His comm beeps.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Zardus, I&#39;m at the CF. There is a bot who looks just like \nUnitron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zardus growls, tapping a few buttons. This was enough. Three\n&gt; &gt; seconds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after a barely audable beep, the pipes blast open in the room \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unitron and his fellow bots were in, neuro-circuitry-destructive\n&gt; &gt; gas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rushes to fill the room. The gas worked by seeping into any \nopening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they could find in a bot (optics, mouth, nose, joints, cracks in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; armor, spaces between armor plates, etc..) and attacking any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; circuitry it touches, possibly completely destroying it. The \nblast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doors of that area of the base were all closed and airtight \n(blast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; door every 10 feet or so, as usual). Zardus activates his comm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jammers activate in the room, stopping any transmissions \nwhatsoever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from leaving or entering.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;All Alliance troops, there may be a revolt in sectors three\n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seven. Those sectors have been sealed off. Prepare for battle in\n&gt; &gt; case\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the revolt gets out of hand. Don&#39;t rush to fight yet, those \nsectors\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are highly dangerous at this point, but be ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The announcement, of course, was not heard in the room where\n&gt; &gt; Unitron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and co were. Zardus taps a few more buttons and the autoguns in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; room emerge, aiming at the crowd of bots and firing randomly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Future Zardus looks around the battle at the CF, watching for \nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other suspicious behavior other than what he reported to Zardus \na\n&gt; &gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seconds ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Astral runs out of his quarters at Zardus&#39;s transmission, his \ngun\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand and ready to be used. He wasn&#39;t too far from where\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;revolt&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was taking place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reptilica sighs, looking to Zardus. &quot;If this don&#39;t stop, I&#39;m \ngonna\n&gt; &gt; go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; insane from all the conflicts,&quot; he says to his commander, \nsitting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back in his chair, bored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DevilDuer groans and activates his stun gun, preparing for any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible battle. He sits up and exits his quarters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fenox jumps at the announcement of a possible revolt, her gun in\n&gt; &gt; her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand in under a second. &quot;You ready?&quot; She asks Vlad.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Griplash drags his sleepy self out of his quarters, both missile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; launchers ready for battle. From the next room, Recklessa \nemerges,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also ready to slag some bots.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The practice bots dissapear as Havoc waves his hand after \nZardus&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; announcement. He looks to Demolition and Repressor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Well, we get to fight real life. Let&#39;s go.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Havoc exits the training room, taking out his missile launcher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Repressor follows with both missile launchers drawn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perndabot takes out his missile launchers, remaining in his \nseat at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bridge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starlight yawns as she exits her quarters, her charge launcher\n&gt; &gt; armed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and ready to go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I&#39;ve tried not using Diamond as much as possible, cause I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using other people&#39;s chars, but Logo loaned her to me till she \ngets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back, and this is a serious situation, so I&#39;ll RP her for now)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Diamond jumps out of her bed, running out of her room with her\n&gt; &gt; poison\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gun ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        Nighteyes screams, but is hit in the leg.
