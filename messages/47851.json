As is repairs are under way, \nsensor range is limited for the moment and communications outside the \nship are being looked into.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Grinning he nodded, &quot;We&#39;ve got a foothold here to complete our \nmission, as for now I&#39;d like to see about getting the mess hall \ncleaned up and getting some of our people resting. We don&#39;t know the \nterrain, we don&#39;t know how many preds there are or if they&#39;re headed \nour way. I want every bot in good shape for when we find them or they \nfind us. Megatron is going back to cybertron, this time for good.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Nodding again saying his piece he walked out of the CR chamber \nroom and headed for the mess hall to assess the damage, from the look \nof Kup it must&#39;ve been pretty shook up.\n\n\n"}}
