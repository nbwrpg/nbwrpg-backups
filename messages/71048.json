How can you cover my signature?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nCyclonus paused thoughtfully. &quot;From the reports I got, Deepstryke is\nundamaged as is Scourge, but Phobia took several hits in the battle.\nShe will most likely need a CR chamber before she can go into battle\nagain.&quot;\n\nThe was another pause as Cyclonus consulted via radio with several\nothers. &quot;Waspinator is unhurt as is Inferno, however we haven&#39;t heard\nanything from Terrorsaur, we don&#39;t know what has happened.&quot; Cyclonus\npaused again as he got more information. &quot;The Fuzors, Injector,\nBuzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike are all okay, although thier\nleader Skyshadow has some batle damage.&quot;\n\n&quot;Insecticon, Bruticus-X, Fractyl, Iguanus and Tarantulus are all in\ngood condition as well&quot; Cyclonus said as he got the last bit of\ninformation from the troops. &quot;I don&#39;t think any of your troops are any\ncondition for a full scale assault without a good recharge, but we are\ngood enough for now.&quot;\n\nCyclonus pondered Hydras&#39; other question, &quot;As to hiding your\nsignature, that is no easy task for any of us.&quot; Sighing Cyclonus\ncontinued, &quot;However the sweeps positioned carefully around you you\ncould fly in virtually undected, but that would only help you as long\nas you stayed out of visual range. The sweeps don&#39;t actually turn\ninvisable to sight as much as they distort sensors crating a haze of\ninvisiblity for sensors.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
