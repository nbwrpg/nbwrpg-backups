You will note that on the inside of your arm there is \na new compartment, and inside that compartment, is a new, and \nexceptionally destructive weapon. Use it to crush the infidels. You \ncan destroy Soundwave, Rumble, Frenzy, Spasstik, and Astrotrain as \nsoon as you find them, anyone else should be given the choice of \nliving or dying.&quot;\n\nSwitchblade picks up a little remote control, and rips a paper from \nthe wall to reveal a vid screen. He presses a few buttons, and a \npicture of the control room appears. &quot;Here are the first targets, \ngo!&quot; Switchblade dusts off his hands, then sits back in a reclining \narmchair that was sitting in the corner of the room.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., gunthers@t... wrote:\n&gt; Firestrike awoke, slowly pulling light through his\n&gt; optics.  \n&gt; Adjustments, perfect, Vision 100%.
