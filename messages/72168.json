Whoever you\n&gt; are, my name is Tucson Prime, Maximal Commander.  Perhaps you may be able to\n&gt; assist me.  Several of my comrades have gone missing, and if you&#39;re willing\n&gt; to help, I will see to it that you&#39;re rewarded for your assistance.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs TUSCON revealed himself so did the other figures. The most\nprominant was the one to the front of TUSCON, he looked like he turned\ninto a creature similar to SLAG&#39;s beastmode that of an organic\ntriceratops dinosaur. However he was constructed differently and he\nwas was a mustard yellow in color.\n\nHowever he was in robot mode now, and although he resembled slag, he\nwas not as massive as he, standing a little shorter than TUSCON\nhimself, but he also looked far more intelligent.\n\nTo either side there were two other figures, one was purple and red\nand looked like he turned into some sort of avian creature similar to\nTERRORSAUR and the other was a marine green with purple chestplating.\nHe looked like he might turn into something similar to DINOBOT, but it\nwas difficult to tell. Both of them were a little smaller than the\nfigure that stood in front of TUSCON\n\nThe first figure standing before TUSCON spoke, obviously the one in\ncharge as held his weapon on TUSCON and shook his head. &quot;No.&quot; he said.\n&quot;You will come with us now. The only choice you have is how it will be\ndone. You can either be our prisoner or as a burnt out chassis!&quot;\n\nThe two on the sides of TUSCON just chuckled evilly as they held their\nweapons on him.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
