For now we need to lock down the situation and sww what we can\nsalvage.&quot; There was somehting more than anger in LEO&#39;s voice, it was\nconcern. &quot;From the reports I have read too many people have\ndisappeared since we have arrived here. Let&#39;s see if we can find some\nof them.&quot;\n\nThey quickly enough find themselves on the bridge. LEGACY is already\nthere sitting at one of the consoles while LORD ELDER and TORCA\nquickly follow behind TALON and STRAIGHT SHOT as they enter.\n\n&quot;Legacy.&quot; LEO PRIME said as he turned to look at him. &quot;Activate the\nsensor logs for the past hour and give me a visual diplay of\nNightlight&#39;s energy signature.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from LEGACY as the turned to complete the task.\n\nOn the main viewscreen an image of the ARK and the surrounding section\nis displayed. A dot representing NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s signature is shown to be\ninside the ark, and then flying out of it, and travelling some\ndistance. Her signature landing nearly 100 miles away in a loney\nisolated area.\n\n&quot;What is Nightlight doing out there?&quot; LORD ELDER said, obviously not\naware of what has been happening.\n\nTORCA looked similarly confused.\n\nLEO held up his hand, &quot;Just a moment.&quot; He said as he looked at LEGACY,\n&quot;Speed us up until we come to the present or until something happens.\n\nLEGACY nodded and the scene sped up and then slowed down again as\nsomething like RODIMUS PRIME showed up on the screen, or atleast an\nenergy signature that looked much like his.\n\nOn the screen the small dot that represented RODIMUS approached the\ndot that represented NIGHTLIGHT. They interacted for a moment and then\nthey both vanished.\n\n&quot;A teleoprtation device?&quot; TORCA said as he looked at the screen.\n\nLEGACY peered at his console. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; he siad in his typical cold\nvoice. &quot;The signature at their disappearance resembled a space bridge\nsignature but on a much smaller scale and there were differences in it\nas well.&quot;\n\nTORCA grunted, &quot;And that was probrably that Dark Rodimus again.&quot;\n\nLEO PRIME nodded to TORCA and then looked around the room.\n&quot;Suggestions on how to find Nightlight now?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
