Flesh Ripper fired off a single \nblast at Hiss&#39; chest.\n\n---\n\nDark One gained altitude rapidly to avoid the laser blast.  &quot;Understood.&quot; he \nreplied to Zardus, firing off ten rapid blasts down at the now enemy Vok.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown took out his grenade launcher, charging for Dark Claw to get into \nfiring range to bombard him.\n\n---\n\nPyro drove full speed, one missile missing and the other hitting its target \nand smashing a dent that looked like it was ready to give into his side.  \n&quot;BURN IN THE PIT!&quot; he screamed, activating his left missile launcher, \nlaunching to energy-signature seeking rockets off at Dark Claw.\n\n---\n\nHiss felt the laser blast burn into his chest and for a split second his grip \non Flesh Ripper&#39;s wrists loosened because of the pain, and that was all the \nVok needed.  Hiss let out a scream as he felt claws dig into chest.\n\n---\n\nScavenger came to a sudden halt, the abrupt stop sending Flesh Ripper \nflipping backwards and smashing through the windshield of the HUMV, slamming \ninto the hood and rolling off into the grass.\n\n---\n\nNemesis hovered for a second, looking over the battle and raising his rifle \nto point at Sinnertwin&#39;s back area, nineteen laser blasts heading for the \nDecepticon from behind.\n\n---\n\nScattershot raised his own rifle, getting a good aim and firing off twenty \narmor-piercing rounds at Demon Wulf&#39;s left arm.  &quot;Take that ya traitor!&quot;\n\n---\n\nImprisoner didn&#39;t long before firing another four missiles at the \nCybertronian Fire, two from each mounted missile launchers.\n\nPredator took out his plasma rifle, firing off three bolts of plasma energy \nat the CF.\n\nChoran set up a mortar, putting in a grenade and watching it launch into the \nair, heading down rapidly towards the CF.\n\n---\n\nHot Spot turned to see his fellow Protectobots under attack, and fired off a \nlong blast of flame at Headstrong.\n\n---\n\nGroove stopped, throwing his photon pistol into the air and taking his twin \nvaporators out before the pistol had even gone into his subspace pocket.  \nRaising his twin vaporators he shot off a long jet of freezing vapors at \nSinnertwin.\n\n---\n\nBlades reloaded his 30mm cannons, launching off 20 more explosive rounds at \nRampage.\n\n---\n\nFirst Aid, not expecting anything, was taken by surprised and when he jumped \nhe was hit with two blasts that sent him twisting through the air and \ncrashing to the ground.\n\n---\n\nStreetwise rolled out of the way of the electricity and stood up, pohoton \npistol raised but was struck in the side with two blasts.  Letting out a \nslight grunt, he painfully turned to face Headstrong.  &quot;Decepticlown \ntrash...&quot; he muttered, trying to ignore the memories that were surfacing.  He \nraised his pistol, firing off three pohoton blasts at Headstrong&#39;s torso.\n\n\n\n"}}
