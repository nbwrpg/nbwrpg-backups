I taken over half the shots that been fired \nat me. it seems that bombs don&#39;t hurt any of your men and YES I MODE because \nthe things that I moded are not in the rules. people like you [KSLAWDAGG] \nare pissing me off. I did not join this rpg to listen to whine that \neverything is not fair. THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE YOUR \nWAY. Why am I not posting damage because if every time you threw like 20 \nchareters at me this rpg would suck. why is it most the time you attack its \nall of your chareters and if I spelled wrong well you can fuck off. get a \nlife. you sit here all day thinking what I am going to do on the rpg. what \nthe hell kinda crap is that and get the hell off my back I have real life \nproblems to deal with. I don&#39;t want to put up with your crap.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
