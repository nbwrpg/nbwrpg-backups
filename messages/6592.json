She blindly snapped at the air in front of \nher, twisting and turning, doing her best to loosen her captor&#39;s\ngrip. \nHer hind legs frantically scratched and clawed at the floor. She was \ngetting desperate. She hated not being able to see her captors, it\nput \nher at a severe disadvantage. \n\nTavatron sontinued to claw and snap at the air surrounding her, \nunaware of the current situation. Suddenly something in the darkness \nspoke. She couldn&#39;t tell who exactly, all the voices and shadows were \nbeginning to blend, but that didn&#39;t matter. She heard the words \n&#39;torture&#39; and &#39;Tavatron&#39; in the same sentence. The fluid in her \nartificial viens froze. Torture. She had always been able to avoid \ncapture until now. As a former Predacon she had been trained to \nwithstand most forms of torture, but the Aliiance was different. They \nweren&#39;t the Predacons.\n\nTavatron&#39;s body tensed as Punch pressed his gun against her. This was \nthe third time someone had threatened to shoot her unless they \ncooperated. However this time she would rather be shot and have it \ndone with than be locked in some cell for Primus knows how long. \nTavatron found herself thinking about the last time she had seen \nDinobot. He was asleep, or so it appeared. Perhaps she should have \nwaited for him to rise. Who knows, she may never see him again. A\npity \ntoo, she was actually beginning to care for him as more than a\nfriend. \nWhether or not he felt that way about her, well, judging from the way \nhe acted most of the time she&#39;d have to say no, but then again he was \na warrior. Emotion wasn&#39;t a trait found in most warriors, perhaps he \ndid care for her, he just had an odd way of showing it. \n\nTavatron growled softly, no matter what happens next they were\ngetting \nout of here, ALIVE. Tavatron cringed at the sound of a blunt object \nhitting metal, the object hit most likely being Iron Raptor:\n\n&quot;Leave her alone. If you kill her then you will have nothing to \nbargain with.&quot;\n\n*First priority, keep Iron Raptor safe and alive,* Tavatron thought \nsolemnly, *at all costs.*\n\n\n"}}
