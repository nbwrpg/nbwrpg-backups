She was hit by flying bits of rock.  Her \nface cut and her side with bits of inbedded rock in her skin.  She \nstood and was about to throw a spear when she heard Shadow Wing call \nout. She crouched low behind what was left of the large rock and \nwaited.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She took another shot to her injured wing and fluttered to the \nground.\n&gt; She transformed to bot mode and walked up to Unitron.
