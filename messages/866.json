The clone must have decided to go along with her plan \nafter all, no matter...it was up to her anyway.\nCarnage snarled quietly as she came up right behind Tankoor, it was now or \nnever!*\n\n&quot; Carnage, TRANSFORM!!!&quot;\n\n*Now transformed she stood in plain view of the Predacon drone, she put her \nhand on her hip and whistled to get his attention...*\n\n&quot; Hay! Pred Boy! Over here!&quot;\n\n* She snarled as she straightened up her posture, she crossed her arms and \nawaited for the seemingly dim witted drone to turn and see her.\nIt would be fun to fight again, especially when she didn&#39;t have an employer \ndepending on the outcome.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
