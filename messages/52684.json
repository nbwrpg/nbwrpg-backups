I&#39;ve sent the pods out so we can \nuse them later. The Tripredacus, Maximals and a rogue band of \nPredacons have joined forces to bring a merged version of Megatron and \nGalvatron down. Seeing you&#39;re here, my alliance with these factions is \nlikely to end when this is over. I ask of you not to intervene unless \nI specifically request it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt; Blackheart stared at the scannes. &quot;I see maybe 4 bases....this is \n&gt; complicated. A ship is airborn..but it seems not for long. Its a \ntripred \n&gt; ship. The predacons are obviously out matched but they seem to be \n&gt; surviving.....they must be worthy opponents.&quot; Blackheart had one \n&gt; weakness...the thrill of a challenge. &quot;Send a comm to the \nTripreds...if im \n&gt; not mistake thats Tyrael....I thought hed be dead by now. Tell them \nour \n&gt; position around the moon and that we wish to speak to them whenever \ntheir \n&gt; battle is over...I dont think we should intervene just yet...not \nuntil we \n&gt; know what were dealing with.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
