I can control her body &#39;cause \n&gt; I insolate her spark, in that way that her sense can&#39;t registrate \n&gt; what&#39;s goin on outside... but every damage that some one do to her \n&gt; body just her will suffer it!!!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why is she so important that you decided to control her?!!&quot; said \n&gt; Rodimus almost angered and worry.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&#39;cause I finally decided that it&#39;s time that I personaly take \n&gt; control of situation&quot;replied the Vork\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you meaning that... you was inside before Unicron&#39;s arrival? \n&gt; How could It be? &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My masters knew that someone else will arrive to destroy our \n&gt; lab...&quot; started to say the vork&quot;so I had the command to find a drone \n&gt; and take its body, but I choose one whose spark still was alive but \n&gt; slowly was dying, it just was time that I were the owner of its \n&gt; body, so I just waited; time passed and that pod was found for you \n&gt; and that doggie bot...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;WHAT!?&quot; said suprised Rodimus\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;SO do you didn&#39;t know that you rescued her pod???? and where you \n&gt; brought her here???&quot;said the Vork almost laughting&quot;you never figured \n&gt; that you found her ???? well well that&#39;s not the subject; After that \n&gt; the wolfbot brought her here and with this IDIOT&#39;s help&quot; she said \n&gt; that words looking to Kenzo &quot;Her spark didn&#39;t vanished... So I \n&gt; decided to wait, wait until I know if would be needed my \n&gt; intervention... at first I consider influence her... bur she&#39;s wake, \n&gt; wake and afraid to hurt some one even if her live is at risk... hHer \n&gt; reaction after destroy that Unicron&#39;s minion confirmed that... SO I \n&gt; decided that it&#39;s time that I do something and took control of her \n&gt; and insolate her spark, it was pretty easy: she was emotionaly \n&gt; exausted... Now That I&#39;m in control... I have to start the mission \n&gt; that my masters order me...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
