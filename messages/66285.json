Welcome back!  I vaguely remember that name, you were\nprobably here right when I started but I&#39;m not sure.  The last few\nmonths we&#39;ve been working on an NBW wiki that i have found to be a\nreally easy way to keep track of plot info. It can be reached by\nsearching: NBWRPG wiki   on google.   It&#39;s the first link on the list.\n :-)\n\nthe parts about the working of the group are still a bit weak, but\nthat should be a good plot update.   i dont think we have formal\ncharacter creation procedures right now, so anything reasonable should\nbe fine. I can give you current events if you need me to.. but i gotta\nget off the email for now.   Welcome back!\n\nOn 3/10/07, hugar_twriker &lt;hugar_twriker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC:\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how many of you remember me, but I am back.  I think it\n&gt; has been since like 4 years since I last been here.\n&gt;\n&gt; For those that don&#39;t remember me it is I Hugar, for those history buffs\n&gt; you might remember me by another name Proto_b, one of the original\n&gt; founders.\n&gt;\n&gt; As you might imagine, coming back after four years can be a huge\n&gt; overload of information.  If anyone would be kind enough to fill me it\n&gt; that would be swell.  For example, is there a homepage anymore?  How do\n&gt; I create a character?  Yadda Yadda Yadda?  It might be a lot to tell so\n&gt; in order not to create to many messages it might be best to contact me\n&gt; on yahoo messanger at hugar_twriker, MSN at kmaddo3@..., or AIM at\n&gt; thecrowlord. Of course if you want I guess you can just reply to this\n&gt; meassage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hugar\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
