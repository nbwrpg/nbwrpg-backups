Now,\nI correct you, I am Admiral Astral of the LAVACONS!!!!  I didn&#39;t come to\nEarth to fight inferior transformers like you, but if I must, then you will\ndie, I won&#39;t allow anyone to stop me and my crew from finishing this\nexperiment!!!&quot; Astral screamed in rage, and continued blasting shots from\nhis machine gun at DevilDuer, putting his pistol away.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox got hit once by Hiss in the right shoulder, then in the left, and then\nin the chest, going backwards from each shot.  Then, two of Scavanger&#39;s\nshots hit Fenox, and he goes spiraling down to the ground, unconscious as he\nhit the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight did a somersault in the air towards Breakdown, dodging his shots,\nthen landing and firing her crossbow at him again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGriplash put his arms in front of him, to try to block a couple shots.  The\nshots hit him, and he went back, but, at the last shot, went flying back.\n\n    &quot;Ah!!  Stupid Oblitercon!!&quot; Griplash yelled, getting up, jumping in the\nair and going for Pyro with his lava blade.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecklessa sees that Dark One has sped away.\n\n    &quot;Ok, my fun just got SPOILED!!!!!!
