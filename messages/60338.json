Tell you what: if you go \nwith Organics, she&#39;ll get you whatever you want to eat.  How&#39;s that?&quot;\n&gt; Organics stepped right up to Malice and Elita, smiling big.\n&gt; &quot;C&#39;mon, we can go eat, then go play games, ok?&quot;\n&gt; Malice seized the opportunity.  He gently put Elita right into \nOrganics&#39; waiting arms.\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t do anything crazy Elita, I hope.&quot;\n&gt; He patted the baby on the shoulder, then his sister, then walked \ndown the hall to the labs.  He ounded a corner and found Wolfblade \nat work.  He stepped behind her, leaned over her, and rested his \nhands on the bench in front of her.  He looked at her now upside \ndown face, a big grin on his face.\n&gt; &quot;Parents don&#39;t take care of children all the time.

It&#39;s \n&gt; kinda of a back up plan.  We have been working on it off and on, \n&gt; between drinking and sleeping.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Malice shifted little Elita further up his arm so she was \nsitting \n&gt; up.  Organics didn&#39;t quite know what to make of the situation.  \n&gt; Either he was telling the truth or he was covering up more \nulterior \n&gt; motives.  But whatever the reason, he was really wanting to get to \n&gt; work.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Perhaps you need a baby sitter, Dad?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; She cracked up as Malice tried to take a swing at her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Windlord/Elita:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I have work to do to...&quot;said Windlord and looking to \n&gt; Malice &quot;Where you go, Malice?

I promise to come back and take \ncare \n&gt; of you.  While I&#39;m gone, why don&#39;t see Organics?  I&#39;m sure she \nwould \n&gt; take care of you just as well as I can.  Later we&#39;ll play a game, \n&gt; how&#39;s that?  If you&#39;ll let me work with Wolfblade and finish what \n&gt; we&#39;re doing, we&#39;ll play outside for a while?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Organics continued to grin as she looked between Malice, Elita, \n&gt; and Camoflage. &quot;Yes!
