However, she could\nunderstand security concerns. She nodded, &quot;Very well.&quot;\nShe was getting a little annoyed about how things had been since she\nwas imprisoned in her cocoon. She was rather hoping the Maximals would\nbe only a small resistance and the Predacons be ruling the galaxy by\nnow. Her face plates showed a minor irritation as she felt her\ndisappointment in the Predacon process so far. However, she seemed to\ngive a small smile as she knew that since she was now here, things\nwould truely change for the better.  After all, her programs made her\na very accomplished killer and skilled planner.  She felt that she\nwould be a great asset to the Predacons. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I can&#39;t told you anything by now...&quot;replied the male&quot;it&#39;s very\nrisky that enemies ears caught this litle chat...&quot;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Dark Mouse \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, February 23, 2005 10:57 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Reclusa\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Reclusa::\n&gt; \n&gt;   She grinned, &quot;Oh, how I am impressed.
