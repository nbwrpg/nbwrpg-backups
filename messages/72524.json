That was dumb on your part.&quot;\n\n\nDINOBOT grinned, &quot;To=\r\n see if they had changed at all.  Instead, I see merely that they continue =\r\nthe disintegration of their own cause, and if anything it has progressed fa=\r\nster.  You are like an infestation of scraplets, projecting all faults outw=\r\nards to others and in denial of your own contributions.  The rat lead to my=\r\n death, and I believe under any right I have to be upset with him, even by =\r\nMaximal standards.  And then your friend here drew her weapons and threaten=\r\ned to assault me when you had called us here for a truce.  You Maximals sta=\r\nted you needed our help, and then one of your member escalates and threaten=\r\ns assault.  The rodent led to my termination, I believe I have cause for ca=\r\nndor with him.  In his defense, if you call it such a thing, your little fr=\r\niend powered up her weapons systems an threatened me.&quot;  \n\nHIssing, continui=\r\nng as his sword was back in it&#39;s storage compartment.  &quot;That is escalation,=\r\n all on the part of your own troops. Now you on top of that are threatening=\r\n again.  That is two escalations on the part o the Maximals, who claim mora=\r\nl superiority.  A Predacon at the very least if he disagreed would not have=\r\n made such a show of things.  They would have been forthright where they st=\r\nood.  There woudl have been no gamesmechship.  Instead, you call us here fo=\r\nr a truce, come off as instigating a fight, and then put all of it WHEN YOU=\r\n ARMED YOUR WEAPONS upon my spark.&quot;  Snorting, &quot;That is somehow all my faul=\r\nt now, when I only drew my own saber after I had been directly targeted.&quot;  =\r\nLaughing, &quot;And are you going to attack me again when the Rodent baited me, =\r\nyour friend threatened to attempt to attack me, and even now the two of the=\r\nm continue to belittle and threaten me within audial receiver range?  Oh, a=\r\nnd speak of how I am to get my cumuppance from them and such?  Truly, what =\r\nare they, freshly sparked protoforms to utter such nonsense if this is trul=\r\ny such a critical event that only our alliance would stop it that they wish=\r\n to instigate an altercation and then suffer no consequences for it, and pu=\r\nt all of the responsibility upon another.  That extends to your faction, yo=\r\nur politics as a whole.  That is why you have made Cybertron rotten to the =\r\ncore.&quot;\n\nHissing, &quot;Now, restrain your whelps and do not let them belittle me=\r\n further or at least have the candor if they wish to do so to do upon a fie=\r\nld of battle.&quot;  Turning back to Hydras and awaiting orders then.\n\n\n"}}
