So I don&#39;t know mush about him before that.  \nI do now that he is like a wolf, looking after his pups.  He tries to \ntake care of us.&quot; She looked at Rowdy. &quot;He&#39;s more like a friend than \nanything else. But he is a great leader.&quot; She didn&#39;t understand why \nshe was talking this way about her commander like this. But she felt \nlike it was the truth. So she spoke it.  She just hoped that she \nwouldn&#39;t regret it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Rowdy Wolf:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rowdy Wolf held back a laugh from KitKat&#39;s question. It seemed to \nbe the \n&gt; main thing he had to explain. &quot;I don&#39;t know where I came from.&quot; he \nreplied. \n&gt; &quot;All I can remember is coming on-line to a barren place. I traveled \nuntil I \n&gt; found somewhere I could make a home of. I was alone. I stayed that \nway for a \n&gt; long time, until I found Quickstrike in my territory.&quot; He wasn&#39;t \nsure if he \n&gt; should tell her he attacked him. &quot;He told me about the Predacons. I \nagreed \n&gt; to stay in my territory until he needed me. Now, I guess he needs \nme.&quot; He \n&gt; shook his head while in motion. &quot;Tell me, how did Quickstrike \nbecome second \n&gt; in command?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
