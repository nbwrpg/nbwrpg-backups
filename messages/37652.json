There are larger enemies here, to both of us.&quot;  Feeling \nconfident he stands up and looks out the door.  One of Hellpeon&#39;s blasts \ncatches him full in the chest flinging him against the back wall.  With his \nlast breath he muttered.  &quot;I shall return ... my ... liege...&quot;  With that his \nhead slumped down and his spark left to join the matrix.\n\n    He was stopped along the way by another spark.  Enertron&#39;s spark, still \nstruggling against the Matrix&#39;s pull was sitting in limbo.  He needed another \nspark&#39;s cooperation to overcome the pull.  They began to speak and it quickly \nbecame clear that neither was ready to die.  With Cygnar&#39;s added support \nEnertron pulled away from the Matrix and brought Cygnar with him.\n\n    They returned to Earth and found an old discarded body.  When they tried \nto enter separately they found that they were no longer separate.  They had \nfused.  They could no longer exist without each other.  Together they \ninhabited the body, reformatting it to suit both of their needs.  It combined \nCygnar&#39;s elegant beast mode with Enertron&#39;s dragonesque appearance.  The \npower over energy had faded, now limited to firing energy shots of varying \nstrengths out of any part of their body.  With their new body the stood up \nand began to walk around to get their barings.  They found themselves \nsurprisingly close to the Sulaco.  They made the short walk there and \nannounced themselves to Magmatron.  &quot;Sir.  We have returned!&quot;\n\n"}}
