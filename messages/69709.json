He uses his current s=\r\ntate to his advantage, and screches his rubber on his tires, pivoting them =\r\nquickly to maneuver away from the blasts. He had no sonar senses to guide h=\r\nim but he had his audo sensors and his sense of feel and touch, guiding him=\r\n. The system that Rat Trap was now holding merely augments his audio sensor=\r\ns and even though he could have used the device, he was now quickly getting=\r\n used to not having it on him. And now, he could feel Rodimus&#39;s energy sign=\r\nature. But first he had to get rid of Scorponok and Dark Hawk. He knew he d=\r\nid not have enough energon in his main power core, but he did have a reserv=\r\ne stash in his backup battery. He calculated that since he had hardly touch=\r\ned this backup, it had close to ninety five percent capacity, yet it had to=\r\n be used sparingly. This meant deciding between vehicle and robot mode. He =\r\nmakes a quick anaylasis of his systems.. Which would be able to concerve mo=\r\nre? Vehicle or robot mode? \n\nThe truth was, they were equal in ussage. But =\r\nhe knew he had to stick to vehicle mode, to make for a fast getaway if he d=\r\nid indeed find a way out of there.. Meanwhile, hidden not too far now, from=\r\n the torture chamber, Rat Trap who has made his way into a vent hole, right=\r\n over the chamber, spots Tucson. He then finds another bundle of wires and =\r\nfinds readable tags on them.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s wheels, he&#39;s up&#39;n runn&#39;n.. Must be on a=\r\n backup battery... That might last a few hours but that&#39;s about it. Okay, t=\r\nime for this rat ta be his rattiest!&quot; \n\nHe finds a tag that leads to the ch=\r\namber, and begins to knaw at the wires that are connected to it. He snaps t=\r\nhem readilly with his strong, buck teeth. The doors suddenly open in the to=\r\nrture chamber.\n\n&quot;WHEELS, BURN RUBBER!&quot;\n\nTucson could hear Rat Trap&#39;s voice =\r\nand without questioning him, he spins his rear tires, creates a smoke scree=\r\nn and senses the wind coming in from the open doors. He takes this opportun=\r\nity to get past Scorponok, via creating a low lying smoke cloud, cloaking h=\r\nis chassse, and manges to get outside the chamber, stopping in front of Rod=\r\nimus. Rat Trap continues to knaw at wires, hoping that one of them was anot=\r\nher wire that would disable the security and weaponry systems.\n\nOutside, Tu=\r\ncson transforms into robot mode and in front of Rodimus. This was it,he was=\r\n face to face with his former leader. Rat Trap positions himself inside, at=\r\n a peek hole, to watch what&#39;s happening.\n\n&quot;Lord Elder, you wont&#39; believe th=\r\nis, but, Tucson got outa there, and he&#39;s face ta face with Rodimus.

Yet, the body =\r\nof Optimus Prime holds his attention for a moment as he looks up to him.\n\n&quot;=\r\nWow, you must&#39;ve been one heck of a leader in your days. Rat Trap says he&#39;s=\r\n with someone who&#39;s related to you. I wish I could do something ta help you=\r\n guys get back on your wheels, but I&#39;m just a Maximal and I really don&#39;t kn=\r\now how to bring your men back ta life... That Autobot out there could sure =\r\nuse your help, looks like that Rodimus guy really let you down and gave int=\r\no those Predacons. I really can&#39;t judge the guy because I wasn&#39;t there when=\r\n it happened, but from what Rat Trap says, I - dunno if I could ever respec=\r\nt a leader who weakens under pressure. Okay, I gotta go, Lord Elder needs m=\r\ny help. Rest in peace.\n\nHe salutes the still form of Optimus Prime and gets=\r\n to the shuttle. \n\n&quot;Lord Elder, I&#39;ve reached the shuttle and I&#39;m now perfor=\r\nming preliminary take off proceedures.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Pre=\r\nston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus had been standing just =\r\noutside the torture chamber not sure if\n&gt; he wanted to actually enter it. t=\r\nhere was something about this room\n&gt; that gave him the chills, especially w=\r\nhen he didn&#39;t need to go in\n&gt; there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead he just stood in the shad=\r\nows, listening the words of the\n&gt; others like Darkhawk, Scorponok and that =\r\nAutobot Tuscon. there was\n&gt; something about that Autobot that seemed to gra=\r\nte on his nerves.
