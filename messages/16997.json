But HotRod&#39;s driving put the fear of the Matrix in \nher.  Her eyes were transfixed on the ground in front of the car.  \nShe had a white nuckled, death grip on the steering wheel.  She was \nbreathing really hard as her spark felt like it would jump right out \nchest.  Her face had the look of sheer terror on it.  She swore under \nher breath that when she finally calmed down, she was going to get \nHotRod back for scaring her out of her skin. \n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Hot Rod::\n&gt; \n&gt; He closed the cockpit.
