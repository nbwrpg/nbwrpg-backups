The Commander turns around in his chair \nto look out the large window. All he could see was the last of what \nseemd to be a fire trail going down in the hills north of the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: What on Cybertron was that?!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile in the control room Kup was still at the sensor station \nwhen it picked up a signal. It was close and fast. The station \nstarted a siren and started to flash alert lights.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup had been paying little attention to the screens and the alarms \nand lights caused him to jump, nearly falling out of his chair. He \ngets back up and tries to ID what the trouble was.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: What in the bloody hell?! If this is the Predacons I&#39;m going \nto incenerate their hides!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup then figured out what had happaned, from the sensor data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup was about to contact Rodimus when the Commander&#39;s voice came \nover the comm system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Prime to control room, what&#39;s goind on? Did you pick \nup that activity outside?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup hit a button so he could reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup: We picked it up alright, Sir. It scared the hell out of me! \nThe sensors read it as some sort of crystalized structure. Want me to \ngo check it out?\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Not alone, old timer, I&#39;m coming also.
