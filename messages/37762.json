Depressed? Sad? Infuriated? Annoyed? Human? Alive? Dead? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then the message board at the NBW web site is for you! Join with other weirdos just like yourself to discuss topics normally seen as completely pointless (not that this makes them any more useful), but viewed as a life style to all of us on the board! Discuss things like Jume, sanity, Bond, Transformers, and 80s music. Listen to Jer&#39;s drunk ramblings or participate in many interesting flame wars. But remember, if it ain&#39;t on the NBW message board, it is not advertised in this ad!\n\nSo grab your keyboard, username, and password, bring a few dohnuts, maybe set up a little pot next to the chair (you&#39;re gonna be postin&#39; for a while; don&#39;t wanna be distracted by bathroom breaks) and come on down to the NBWRPG message board! Fun for the whole family!\n\nSee what our satisfied posters have said about the message board (note: this is not garaunteed to be true, but we&#39;ll act like it is anyways):\n\n&quot;The NBW message board is a very interesting learning experience. I recommend it for anyone who has any amount of time. Thank you, NBW! You have made my life worthwhile!&quot; - the Cookie Monster\n\n&quot;Uh, am I on candid camera?&quot; - Yanshosh\n\n&quot;The message board we currently have is a work of art that&#39;s easy to use and very convenient,&quot; remarks KSLawdogg, but then adds, commenting on the chat feature, &quot;It&#39;s a piece of crap, not worthy of my Jume.&quot;\n\n&quot;Uhhhh *hic* Errr *hic*&quot; - Jer in one of his better days.\n\n&quot;Oh my god! They killed Kenny, those bastards!&quot; - Cartman\n\n&quot;It&#39;ll be a cold day in hell when hell freezes over.&quot; - unknown\n\n&quot;The message board sucks! Hey! What are you doing? No! I didn&#39;t mean it! NOO!!! AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! *crunch*&quot; - unthankful bastard (born 1982, dead as of this writing.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t bother me, I&#39;m eating.&quot; - Carl&#39;s Junior.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a message board on the site? Wait, I made a site? Wow! I didn&#39;t know I made a site. You know, I remember making a site once. It was nice and green and big and...&quot; - Yanshosh in his natural state.\n\n&quot;Who are you?! Get away from me!!! POLICE! *gunfire*&quot; - random bum on street.\n\nAs you can see from the expriences of these fine gentle(mostly)men, the NBW message board is a good place to hang around and make friends. We encourage all sorts of insults, arguments, and just general human conversation. So drop on in and post a few posts!\n\n(This message has been brought to you by the Yanshosh Corporation. As you read this, our employees are sneaking up behind you to scare you half to death for no reason. You will be charged 10$ for this service. Additional charges may apply. Thank you for your cooperation and have a good day.)\n\n------- End of useless advertisement. --------\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey, Hedge should be getting upset.
