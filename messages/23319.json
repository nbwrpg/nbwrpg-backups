Shadow Cat \njumps to her feet, embarrased that Snow Tech would humiluate her this way*\n\n&quot; God you can be SO dumb Snow Tech. You do have brakes, don&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n* She then looked at prowl how had just then spoken, and nodded*\n\n&quot; Yeah, old friends. We where best buds back on the home planet, but we had \nto leave on a scouting mission and where gone for a long period of time, \nwhen we got back, IR was gone. Since we couldn&#39;t ask the mission control \nunit where she went, we broke into their computer system and tracked her to \nthis sector. It was then all up to chance to find out where she was.&quot;\n\n*She turns her head to Iron Raptor and speaks*\n\n&quot; So, i&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve changed since we&#39;ve last met. Er... It&#39;s, um, \ndifferent, thats for shure!&quot;\n\n* She smiles and goes to give Ir a hug, for old times sake, triping over \nSnow Tech, who had not risen off the ground since he fell, but layed their \nand watched every-one from his ground view.*\n\n&quot;SNOW TECH! YOU ASS!&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech smiles and gets to his feet, dusting himself off and walks over \nto IR, grabing her arm, causing the little &#39;un to lose his sence of balance. \nthe little &#39;un twists out of ir&#39;s grasp and flies to Prowl, curious to what \nthis thing was. Meanwhile, Snow Tech turns to Prowl*\n\n&quot; Hi, I&#39;m Iron&#39;s Lover. &#39;Scuse me while i go make mad, pattinote love to \nher!&quot;\n\n\n\n&gt;::Prowl::\n&gt;\n&gt;Prowl nods as he recieves Iron Raptor&#39;s thought, knowing she was\n&gt;probably right. He had been too excited to feel her fear, but that\n&gt;wasn&#39;t what was getting him down. What was getting him down was that\n&gt;she said she no longer trusted him.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Its ok,- he thinks to her, about to add on to that when Shadow Cat\n&gt;arrives. He glances at Iron Raptor, raising an eyebrow.\n&gt;\n&gt;-An old friend?- he thinks to her, knowing that Shadow Cat couldn&#39;t\n&gt;hear the thought. This new way of communication between him and Iron\n&gt;Raptor could come in very handy...\n&gt;\n&gt;His scanners pick up Angel Prime heading for his location.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Arcangel is heading for us,- he thinks to Iron Raptor, -Or someone\n&gt;that registers very closely to Arcangel&#39;s sign\n&gt;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
