This is the third attack on\n&gt; this base since I arrived, Obviously these Newcomers as you call them\naren&#39;t\n&gt; the only threat. We should prepare, in five days they&#39;ll return loaded to\n&gt; the teeth useing  munitions that they&#39;ve gathered since the ceasefire.&quot;\n&gt; Lunarpine showed his feelings toward the ceasefire, he knew that this scum\n&gt; they dealt with had alterior motives, why else would he have attacked the\n&gt; Ark if he wanted to be left alone. &quot;I&#39;ll fight at your side when you need\n&gt; me, follow your orders, but know this, on or off the record, whichever you\n&gt; choose, I don&#39;t have to agree with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; He knew that the only thing keeping him there were his feelings for Shadow\n&gt; Wing.
