The charges weren&#39;t slowing him at all.\nShe gasped when she saw Prowl about to leap at her, dropping her gun and \nputting her arms infront of her face, only to wait a few seconds when she \nwas sure that she&#39;d get hit...and nothing happens. She peeks past her arms, \nseeing Prowl suddenly raise up on his hind legs and screech. Iris winces at \nthe sound.\n\nIron saw Prowl rear back and bellow, gaining ground and increasing the sound \nas much as she could, but too much and she would shatter her own systems. \nShe had to keep him from getting at Iris, but then she also saw someone else \nheading for her. (Autofire) &lt; No!&gt;\nHer thoughts were shattered and the sound came to an abrupt stop, her mind \nswitching to where Autofire was heading.\nShe hissed at him and charged, spitting a wave of acid at him.\nBut her circuits had been bumbled around from the sound and the program \ncontaining her SBM was flictuating, causing her to stumble in her run and \nfall. Her face dug into the ground and she doubled over, wincing.\nIn seconds the huge shape of the SBM disappeared and all that was left was \nhalf of her unltrametal mode.\nWith the torso armor gone, all the was left was the leggings and stability \nplates ( foot armor ). Feeling the sudden chill the armor had prevented her \nfrom feeling, IR got up to a kneel and discovered that a black tank top \ncovered her chest, though her arms and face were bare. Well, now at least \nshe wasn&#39;t without protection.\nWithout the helm to keep her hair back it whipped around her face with the \nwind that blew from the south east.\nShe looked up towards Prowl, not sure of what was going to happen now.*\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
