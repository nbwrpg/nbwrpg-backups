I&#39;m not in control of this group!&quot;\n\n-IT DOES NOT MATTER, HE IS NOW AN ALLIANCE MEMBER, AND IF HE LEAVES, HE WILL \nMOST CERTAINLY DIE, PEACE BETWEEN THE MANY FACTIONS OF THE BEAST WARS IS NO \nLONGER A POSSIBILITY-\n\nNemsis Enforcer held a hand against the side of his, the booming voice \nhurting him.\n\n-BUT, THROUGH YOUR FAILURE YOU HAVE CAUSED AN EVEN GREATER THREAT.  VULOIS&#39; \nAPPRENTICE, CHILD, MEANS TO TURN CYBERTRON INTO AN ORGANIC PLANET.  THIS MUST \nNOT BE ALLOWED.  YOU MUST GAIN MORE FOLLOWERES, YOU MUST UNITE WITH \nSHOCKWAVE, SERPENTOR, SCATTERSHOT, AND UNITRON IF YOU ARE TO CRUSH THE \nUPCOMING REPUBLIC OF HEAVEN.  THOUGH YOU WILL HAVE FURTHER AID FROM A NEW \nFACTION-\n\nNemesis Enforcer was about to reply to the Matrix, but his vision ended.  He \nshook his head.\n\nPunch sighed loudly, opening his mouth again.  &quot;HEY!  YOU TWO GO OUTSIDE TO \nZARDUS, I&#39;ll STAY IN THE BRIDGE!&quot;\n\nNemesis looked to Scattershot, knowing he had just had the same vision as \nhim.  The two ran to get out of the Alliance base.\n\n-----\n\nSerpentor stepped out of the Alliance base, plasma launcher ready.  He had \njust recovered from a strange vision.  He was supposed to ally up with a \nbunch of losers!  He looked around and spotted Zardus.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the scoop?&quot;\n\n---\n\nUnitron ignored everyone in the room, including Vulois, and calmly walked \noutside, not receiving a vision of any kind.  It was the task of Nemesis \nEnforcer to make him aware.  \n\n"}}
