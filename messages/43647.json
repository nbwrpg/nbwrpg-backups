But he noticed Rumble had \nfallen to the ground to his chagrin, and all he was going to do was crash on \ntop of Rumble, unless the target got out of the way.\n\nThe roar of a helicopter&#39;s blades entered the area as an AH-46 Apache Attack \nHelicopter arrived in the general vacinity.  But this was no ordinary attack \ncraft, it was an Autobot!  But he had not followed the same course of his \nbrethren, he had circled around to come up behind the intruders!  \n\n&quot;Look out behind ya!&quot; Blades&#39; voice eminated from the apache towards the \nDecepticons, one of the cannons on the helicopter&#39;s nose firing off twenty \n30mm rounds at Soundwave&#39;s torso from behind.\n\nStreetwise&#39;s form twisted into a biped form, photon pistol in hand.  He \nsurveyed the area, watching the backs of his fellow Autobots and Maximals as \nwell as keeping an optic out for more &#39;Cons.\n\nFirst Aid stopped, but didn&#39;t transform.  He let his sensors search for any \ninjured allies.  &quot;Be careful!&quot; his voice warned to everyone else.     \n\n"}}
