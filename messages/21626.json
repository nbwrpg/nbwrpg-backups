She transformed into \nbot mode and got inside. She sat down and fired up the engines.  She \ntook off and headed high into the sky.  She was cruising near the \nupper atmosphere and following the signal that Zardus had given her \nto find.  She had a smile on her face and a plan developed in her \nhead. She flew the pod up higher into the sky and took it to the \nenvelope. She then activated the pods cloaking device so it wouldn&#39;t \nbe picked up by scanners. She then kept it there untill she found the \nsignal she was looking for, KitKat&#39;s.  She angeled the pod and sent \nit into a nose dive.  She  held her breath as the pod went into a \nspin, hurtling down towards the ground.  She cut off the engines when \nit was still about 2000 feet above the ground. The cloaking device \nshut off and so made the pod look like it was falling from from \nspace.  The pod dived and spun, gaining speed as it fell to the \nground.  It crashed just a mile from KitKat&#39;s base.  The pod lay \nmotionless on the ground.  It was relatively unharmed.  Diamond stood \nup, a little shaken, but ok. She turned on the computer and activated \nthe voice functions for the pod. The pod wouldn&#39;t work unless the \ncomputer recognized her voice only. \nShe stood up and stretched. Her neck was sore from the whiplash \nforced by the impact. But she was alright otherwise. She opened a \nlink to the base. She made her voice sound a little trouble and \nworried. &quot;Hello? Is anyone there? My pod crashed and I can use some \nhelp. Is there any predacon out there?&quot;  She knew that KitKat would \nreceive the transmission and think that she could make her an ally.  \nShe smiled and waited for a responce. \n\n\n"}}
