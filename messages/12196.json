He croutched at her side, \nagain he&#39;d failed in his mission and someone got hurt. The wolfbot \nraised his claws realizing he had to act fast if there was any hope \nof reviving her spark &quot;Computer prepare to activate internal repairs &quot;\n\n&quot;No damage indicated&quot; was the reply. Lunarpine brought his claws down \nslashing himself across the chest.\n\nHe reached in grabbing live wires attempting to hook them through \nShadow Wings system as well as his own. It was a long shot but the \nway he saw it it was his only shot there was a chance that his spark \ncould join the matrix along with hers. The wolfbot would rather spend \neternity in the matrix with her than spend one more moment on ancient \nearth without her.\n\nHe opened his mouth one more time, &quot;Anyone nearby please help us.&quot; \nWith those last desperate words Lunarpine collapsed into stasis lock \natop the motionless body of Shadow Wing.\n\n(Posibilities 1Shadow Wing is saved 2Shadow Wings spark is stored in \nLunarpines body for future reference 3 Both are trapped inside the \nMatrix. 4 Both remain in stasis lock for future reference. 5 anything \nLogo can think of.)\n\nForget about this part of the post, I found the retreat after I wrote \nit.\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; OK here I go again\n&gt; \n &gt; 12034 Lunarpine charges downhill fireing at Serpentor as he goes.\n \n\n\n"}}
