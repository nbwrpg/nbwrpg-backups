That you would like to drink and heard an old fellow\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Accepting his offer, she padded forward towards Hydras. Curious as to who \n&gt;in\n&gt;specific he meant was the &#39;old fellow Decepticon&#39;. Did he mean himself? Or\n&gt;... someone else?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Come...&quot; said Hydras while he walked along side Maxima&quot;I&#39;ll show you \n&gt;mess\n&gt; &gt; hall&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Padding along beside him. A mess hall? More like a recharging chamber, she\n&gt;hope or a room with an Energon stock pile.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Of course. Thank you.&quot; Watching a head of them for the time being, then\n&gt;glanced at him. &quot;You have me very curious concerning your plans.&quot; then she\n&gt;glanced away looking down the corridor. &quot;If it means a chance of payback\n&gt;towards the Autobots & the Tripredicus... you can most assuredly count upon\n&gt;me.&quot; She growled in thought to the idea of several being slagged & \n&gt;terminated\n&gt;by her own hands.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I like that Hydras said &quot;How rude I am&quot;,well that could help to the\n&gt; &gt; story line\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;OOC: LOL.. I know... true.... Would be interesting.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN. M�s �til Cada D�a  http://www.msn.es/intmap/\n\n\n"}}
