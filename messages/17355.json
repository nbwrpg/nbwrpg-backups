Gremlin then led him out \nof the chamber room and into the bridge, where Tarantulas, Tankkor, Rampage, \nParalysis, and Aerostreak wirly looked at them.\n    &quot;Ah, these are the troops of Black Aracnia. I see....not much to work \nwith but we will make the best of it.&quot; Hell Beast said making his way around \nthe room. It was differently arrangened from the last time he was here.\n    Aracnia marched in and glared at Hell Beast. &quot;Im in control of this ship! \nArgh! While your here you are under my influence and will follow my orders, \nunderstand? Because if you refuse to do so, I have 7 bots who will blow you \nbit to bit.&quot; \n    Hell Beast frowned. She was being a bitch, and it would be easyer if \nthings went this way because she would let them get away with things if he \nwas serving her. &quot;Alright, your wish is my command.&quot;\n\n"}}
