He finally nods. &quot;Both of you will need quarters,&quot; he says, remembering \nthat Battera didn&#39;t have any as her comm message arrives.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be right there,&quot; he says into his comm, &quot;Set the CR chamber to put him \nin stasis.&quot;\n\nHe looks at HotRod, Cybershark, and Feline, walking off to the residential \narea and motioning for them to follow.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDevilDuer smiles, watching the pod open. He looks over the femm as she \nemerges, glancing around when she asks her question.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re on past earth,&quot; he says, realizing that she probably didn&#39;t detect \nhim. His hand stays near his gun, DevilDuer ready for battle just in case, \n&quot;What faction are you?&quot;\n\n"}}
