They did answer one of the three questions though, the \nAlliance was thier faction, now to have the other two answered.\n\n&quot;You dare to speak to me that way? I am Lady Hawk, and you should \nshow me more respect.&quot; She hadn&#39;t been around many of her kind before \nand didn&#39;t know all the forms of ediquette on this planet. She didn&#39;t \nknow how these bots treated visitors of higher stature and decided \nnot to find out. &quot;I have come to you with my weapons at my side, my \narms in front of me and in a defensive form, I have no aggresive \ntendandcies toward you or this Alliance you speak of, I aske three \nthings of you, it would seem courteous of you to answer at least one \nintentionally before asking the same of me.&quot; The female bot was \nunsure of herself but her father had taught her that one rule of \ndiplomacy was to stay level headed, especially in anothers home.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer laughs at Lady Hawk&#39;s request. He figured that she \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt; put up much of a fight, but there was no reason to be sorry later. \n&gt; DevilDuer keeps his gun ready, his other hand near his comm-link, \n&gt; ready to call for back-up if neccessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re in no position to be making demands here,&quot; he yells loudly \n&gt; enough for her to hear, &quot;This is Alliance territory, I can have 5\n&gt; bots \n&gt; down on ya in seconds. Introduce yourself first.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
