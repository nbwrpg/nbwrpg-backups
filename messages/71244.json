As they lumber closser toward him, the family of stegosaurouses =\r\ncontinues to hold vigil over the area, shielding their comrade from further=\r\n enemy attack.  Yet, upon seeing their herd member, they do move asside to =\r\nallow him to approach Night Shift so that Rat Trap and Ramulus can get clos=\r\nser to him.\n\n&quot; Yeah, these guys are real smart Ramulus, and dinos aren&#39;t kn=\r\nown for it. Hmmm, gotta wonder about that but at least they&#39;re on our side.=\r\n Okay big guy, you can let us down now.&quot;\n\nThe dinosaur bows down to lower b=\r\noth Ramulus and Rat Trap to the ground next to Night Shift who is unable to=\r\n move his legs from the waist down. Night Shift grins casually upon seeing =\r\nthem.\n\n&quot; Good ta have these guys on our side huh?  Those bugs turned tail r=\r\neal fast when these dinos showed up.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, if i=\r\nt weren&#39;t for them we&#39;d be scrap right now. But I bet we&#39;re gettn&#39; help bec=\r\nause Night Shift helped these guys out earlier, when one of their own had s=\r\nomethn&#39; lodged in his foot.  Amazing how they remembered that he&#39;s the one =\r\nwho helped them.&quot;\n\nNight Shift smiles.\n\n&quot; Ya know, we may not have found Ch=\r\neetor, but, we found some new friends out here.  Hopefully they might be ab=\r\nle ta help us out in the future, and maybe even help us out with our fight =\r\nagainst those preds&#39;n cons.  As simple as they are, they can teach us a lot=\r\n about the environment, and how ta make the most of it. Oh, while we were s=\r\nittn&#39; here, another dino showwed up. I think it was curious ta see what the=\r\nse guys were hidn&#39;.&quot;\n\nA young triceratops peeks out from the brush, then co=\r\nmes out to sit down beside Night Shift who gently rubs the young dino&#39;s hea=\r\nd.\n\nI&#39;m sorry fellas, but I gotta go back with my comrades now.  I promise,=\r\n when I get fixed up, me &#39;n my buds here, we&#39;ll come back ta visit.  We won=\r\n&#39;t forget any of you guys.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right guys, but, we&#39;r=\r\ne sure gonna miss ya.  Heeey, I got an idea Ramulus.  I bet these guys can =\r\nhelp us get Night Shift back ta base.&quot;\n\nThe young adult stegosaurous waits =\r\nfor instructions and bobs his head up and down.  A second youngster also jo=\r\nins him to assist in transport duties. \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Sup=\r\ner Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap now arr=\r\nives back at the scene where Ramulus stands, as the stegosaurous he rides s=\r\ntops beside him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, good tim&#39;n, just got your call, c&#39;mon I&#39;ll t=\r\nake ya ta Night Shift, we gotta hurry because he&#39;s in major disrepair.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; He holds a hand down to help Ramulus up onto the stegosaurous. The old=\r\ner stego turns and waits for them to follow him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, =\r\nthese dinos are on our side. This old guy&#39;s got his entire herd lookn&#39; afte=\r\nr Night Shift.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus looked at the Stegosaurus with a st=\r\nrange look, &quot;You mean these\n&gt; beasties are helping you?&quot; He glanced over at=\r\n the Stegosaurus that had\n&gt; been gurgling, &quot;I don&#39;t know, these guys seem t=\r\no be acting kind&#39;a\n&gt; strange. I don&#39;t remember these guys being this smart.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a shrug he took Rat Trap&#39;s hand and leaped up on the Dinosaur&#39;s=\r\n\n&gt; back. &quot;It is a bit comfy here.&quot; He says with a slight smile. &quot;A bot\n&gt; co=\r\nuld get used to this.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Back where he had been left, Ni=\r\nght Shift tries to sit up against a boulder, and finds his legs completely =\r\nuseless. This meant he could neither walk, or transform. The stegos look to=\r\n him curiously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I&#39;ll be okay, no worries. Slag, sure hate ben&#39; in=\r\n this situation though. Night Shift ta Ramulus, Rat Trap&#39;s probably found y=\r\na by now, he&#39;ll take ya ta where I am, over.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I read you N=\r\night Shift.&quot; Ramulus said. &quot;I got some medical supplies\n&gt; with me, we might=\r\n be able to patch you up, if not we&#39;ll get you back\n&gt; to the Ark however we=\r\n have to.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turned to Rat Trap, &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get to Nightshift.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
