His body systems were screaming at him, fighting \nhis wanting to join her or keep watch, what he should be doing. She was a \npretty sight, but he hid his face. He put his chin on the ground and wrapped \nhis arms around his head. He laid on his belly, his legs straight out, \nfinding that the grass was cool, a nice place to relax when you where \nfeeling bad. He had ways of testing things out to get things just right for \nhis own desires.\n\nHe tried to dim his optics to ease his head.

He had stepped out of the CR tank a \n&gt;few\n&gt; &gt; cycles ago, and now he was dizzy and his stomach hurt. He thought. A few\n&gt; &gt; days ago, his body was put to his limits. Perhaps his systems were \n&gt;telling\n&gt; &gt; him to slow down. But he didn&#39;t like that. Not to mention he had lost a\n&gt;lot\n&gt; &gt; of weight.
