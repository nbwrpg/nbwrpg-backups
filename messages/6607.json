The area under attack came up, \nshowing some unfamilar transformers attmepting to use plasma grenades \nto burn through the hull.\n\n  &quot;They&#39;ll be in for quite a surpirse,&quot; Panzertron said. On the \nmonitor a porbe extended from the side of the ship.\n\n  &quot;The underwater hull is covered with those,&quot; he said,&quot; First line \nof defense. We didn&#39;t use them on our last visitor becuase we like to \nkeep aces up our sleeves. Now watch.&quot;\n\n   The probe started sparking.
