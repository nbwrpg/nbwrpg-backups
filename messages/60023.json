Predacons weren&#39;t supposed to be programmed \nto feel regret. However, she was feeling it.  Regret, regret that she \nwouldn&#39;t have more time to be with Blackfang. Why in her spark she \nwanted to be with him was beyond her, but she knew it to be true that \nshe had feelings for them.  She looked at him and commited his face \nto her memeory banks. If she was to leave this world for good, she \nwanted his face to be that last thing her optics showed her mind. \n\n&quot;Well, if it&#39;s the pit he want&#39;s, then let&#39;s give him the pit.&quot;\n\nShe smiled at him, &quot;Oh, and if we live through this, maybe perhaps we \ncould go on that picnic you spoke of a long time ago.&quot;  She said with \na grin.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Unicron&#39;s message arrived, and Blackfang looked dead serious when \n&gt; his eyes met KitKat&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: There, you have it. Unicron&#39;s here and the three \nfactions \n&gt; sorta agreed to work together for the time being. From what it \nlooks \n&gt; like, we&#39;re going to have some more company. Minions. They&#39;re \nstrong \n&gt; as Gestalts, but they&#39;re our size.

Now was not the time to dwell on lost, \n&gt; lost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crushes or cravings. Now she was setting herself to be in \n&gt; command \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a group again. She hoped that with hard work, she would again \n&gt; &gt; rule \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over a group of predacons and bring them to victory over the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maximals. Which was her spark&#39;s fondest wish  for her \n&gt; everntual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future. She refocused her optics and looked at Cooley.\n\n\n"}}
