A sheet of glass descended out\nof his helmet and over his eyes. The picture he was looking through\nbegan to zoom in, and record areas of energy, like guns on Redhot&#39;s\nshoulders, underground veins of oil and other sources, and then zoomed\nin and identified Beachcomber. &quot;It&#39;s Beachcomber,&quot; He said extatically.\nHe then zoomed in on the other, &quot;and he&#39;s with a seeker,&quot; he paused,\n&quot;With an Autobot symbol?&quot; He said with confusion. Cliffjumper sighed. He\nwas to rash, and almost filled a friend full of holes. &quot;You guys wait\nhere, I&#39;ll see whats happening.&quot; He said, transforming, and quickly\naccelerating to his max speed up the hill.\n\n"}}
