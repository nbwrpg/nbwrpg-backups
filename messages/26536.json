Tavatron could tell by Dinobot&#39;s stance \nthat whatever this creature was he was prepared to kill it if necessary. She \nshouldn&#39;t have laughed, and was prepared to tell Dinobot so if he would just \ncalm down long enough to let her attempt the removal of the small bundle of \nblack fur:\n\n&quot;I apologize, I shouldn&#39;t have laughed.&quot;\n\nTavatron peered closely at the small creature, her nose was centimeters from \nit&#39;s own when it swipped at her. Tavatron jumped back and whimpered softly. \nIt wasn&#39;t a matter of pride, well, perhaps it was, but most &#39;bots knew that \nthe nose was one of the most sensitive parts of a creature, especially \nwolves.\n\nShe stood a few feet away, rubbing her snout and contemplating her next \nmove. Whatever that thing was it definitely wasn&#39;t something she wanted to \ntouch again anytime soon. Tavatron removed her staff from subspace and spun \nit once, taking careful aim at the small creature. Perhaps she could knock \nit off with the blunt end of her staff:\n\n&quot;Hold still, I&#39;m going to try and hit it.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
