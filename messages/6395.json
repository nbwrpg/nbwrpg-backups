(The guns wouldn&#39;t do any good if you approached from the \nside.)&quot;I have shown you a gesture of trust, now do the same for me. \ntransform to bot mode (IF not already in bot mode) and lower your \nweapons to your sides. If you have optic blasters please approach \nwith them off line.&quot; \n\n(I know I&#39;m taking liberties here just prease bear with me.) The four \nMaximals lower thier weapons to thier side awaiting Phobias next move.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m coming out, please try to reserve judgement until later, I am \nhere to help.\n\nThe cargo plank lowers and a bright light is emmited from the inside \nof the craft. (I think the light thing is an unwritten rule of sci-fi-\nit seems every ship does it.) As the plank touches the ground a lone \nfigure steps into view, Predicon emblem shining almost tauntingly at \nthe center of his chest. &quot;I am Phobia, and you are?&quot;\n\n-- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster grins, looking down at Hysteria. &quot;We?
