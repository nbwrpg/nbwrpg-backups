He transforms \ninto his \n&gt; robot mode but his left wing is in pain.  He had tried to use it to \ndeflect \n&gt; the shot but it must have been stronger than he anticipated.  &quot;No \nmatter, I \n&gt; will still defeat you!&quot;  Out of each of his arms emerge double \nbarreled \n&gt; blasters (similar to the original Optimus Primal&#39;s only more \nmenacing).  He \n&gt; tries to move his wing but it is still stiff and sore from the \nshot.  He \n&gt; grimaces &quot;I will have to fight on the ground for now.&quot;  He spots \nTrinity and \n&gt; dives forward.  He places his right wing between her and Deemos and \nuses it \n&gt; to try and knock her backwards.  This done he lands and springs \nback out of \n&gt; the way.\n\n\n"}}
