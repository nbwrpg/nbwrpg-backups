She was having her best \ntimes in front of a computer.  She punched a few buttons and scanned \nfor the bot.  She found the maximal signature on the side of a \nmountain.  the hillside didn&#39;t appear to be very steep. But the \nterrane was riddled with boulders, rocks and other evedence of an \navalance from the past winter.  She smiled and pointed to the \nsignature. &quot;That bot would be right....there.&quot;  She grinned, vary \npleased with herself. &quot;So, want to roll out the welcome wagon? One \nless maxmial to worry about isn&#39;t a bad idea you know. One less lazar \nshot to waste, one less bot to have to worry about dying in battle, \none less, well the list goes on and on and on.&quot;  She sipped her cup \nof hot energon and relaxed in the chair. &quot;So, any ideas there Boss \nbot?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  He smiled. &quot;Very impressive young one.......can you scan for the \nnew bot?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
