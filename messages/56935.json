It took\nhim straight at the top stair of the huge space station. He\ndisembarked and walked into the office of Tycoon, his entrepreneur boss.\n\nTycoon: Hi Krhinos. Sit down please. You&#39;ve got a new mission! Energon?\n\nKrhinos: Just a small glass, you know I&#39;m trying to quit... So, what&#39;s\nthe new deal? The Tripredacus again?\n\nTycoon: Not this time. (He poured the liquid energon in two small\nglasses and handed one to his employee.) They&#39;ve offered great\ncontracts, but they&#39;re ending their invasion soon. They don&#39;t need any\nmore ore. (He sipped a little from his cup) This contractor wished to\nremain anonymous, but it&#39;s going to be one of our biggest offer yet.\nBasically, we have been given the mining rights for a whole planet!\n\nKrhinos nearly choked on his energon. A planet! StarDrill Inc would\nbecome the most profitable company in the whole system!\n\nKrhinos: You serious, Tyke?!? A planet!? Which one just for fun?\n\nTycoon smiled grimly.\n\nTycoon: Earth! We have the rights to mine Earth! The human cradle\nitself! (Seeing Krhinos&#39;s unbelieving face, he held a hand up.) Now,\nnow... It&#39;s the prehistoric Earth, not that rebellious headquarter of\ntoday&#39;s.\n\nKrhinos: What are we looking for? Iron? Radium?\n\nTycoon: All you can find! You get a full mobile mining base that you\ncan keep in orbit, a small outpost on the planet from which you can\nship the resources, I&#39;ll even grant you that Mammoth Drill you love so\nmuch. In short, do your best! Oh... I almost forgot... I got you a few\nmercenaries to bring along. They should be in the Mess Hall by now.\nTake &#39;em along. They&#39;ll help you a lot, it&#39;s on their contract. If it\nisn&#39;t, just pay them on the company&#39;s account.\n\nKrhinos: Will do, Boss. Thanks a lot! I&#39; make this mission pay up!\n\nThe massive bot stood up, finished his drink in a nano and saluted\nTycoon one last time before going to the Mess Hall. It was the kind of\nbar where he&#39;d expect anything, from the lowly pleasure bots to the\ndrunken brawls. He looked around, trying to find some relatively fresh\nmercs in the crowd...\n\n\n"}}
