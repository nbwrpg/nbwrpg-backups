And ya k=\r\nnow what?  When we get both your parents back, I&#39;m sure Rodimus is gonna ha=\r\nve a few exo skeletons ta pick with those insectoids. And if she knows your=\r\n heart is pouring out to her, she&#39;ll feel it, even if she&#39;s changed, there =\r\nis no greater power than what&#39;s in your heart, actually in all our hearts. =\r\n You have so much love ta share and that alone will be like a bright light,=\r\n guiding her home.&quot;\n\nNight Shift approaches, and kneels down to Elita.\n\n&quot;Sh=\r\ne&#39;s right, that little heart of yours has more power in it than any super d=\r\nestructive force those baddies are puttn&#39; out on their end. And I know it&#39;s=\r\n got all its hopes on Rodimus and Nightlight&#39;s recovery.  It will bring the=\r\nm home, that&#39;s for sure, it&#39;ll bring them home.&quot;\n\nRat Trap couldn&#39;t wait to=\r\n see what Rodimus and Tucson would do once they recovered from the ordeal.\n=\r\n\n&quot; Just wait till they all come outa this..  Those creeps are gonna get wha=\r\nt&#39;s comming ta them big time, and I&#39;m sure glad I&#39;m on this side of the fen=\r\nce.&quot;\n\nQuickstride ponders for just a moment.\n\n&quot; If ya ask me, I think Tucso=\r\nn Prime&#39;s gonna give them a run for their energon too.  Before he underwent=\r\n the whole upgrade thing, he was a real spit fire, according to Night Shift=\r\n.  Nothing really scared him, and where there&#39;s a will he finds a way.  And=\r\n yes, if there&#39;s one thing he does that manages to scare the bolts out of u=\r\ns, is when he puts himself in mortal danger just so we don&#39;t have to be in =\r\nthe thick of it.  Yeah, there&#39;s somethn&#39; different about &#39;em all right, jus=\r\nt wait till Rodimus starts workn&#39; with &#39;em...
