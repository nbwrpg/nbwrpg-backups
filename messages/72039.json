Rising architecture in the region, WHEELIE\n&gt; simply had nowhere else to go.  Finding his way out of the communications\n&gt; blockade would take too long, and even then the Maximals going into it would\n&gt; be scattered.  Such a signal could easily be faked by anyone with\n&gt; commuincations gear, and whatever it was was almost guaranteed to be a decoy\n&gt; or a trap, not a dropped Autobot.  Such things were a tactic as old as\n&gt; communications warfare existed.\n&gt;\n&gt; But he simply had nothing else to go on.  For the moment, as he zoomed along\n&gt; the road slowly, the dust and mud from the jungle and the clearing foilage\n&gt; still obscuring him somewhat as he went along the tracks, he had no other\n&gt; leads.  HE could not pick up anything on sensors, he was not a good enough\n&gt; technician to try and backtrack along the signal or try and bypass it, adnh\n&gt; the foliage of the jungle was far too thick for him to attempt any sort of\n&gt; scans regardless.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, he could not do anything but drive towards it, cautiously as he could,\n&gt; keeping his scanners set to passive and running along primarily on visual\n&gt; and auditory scanners.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point, he did not know whether the approaching structure was\n&gt; something made by the natives of thi splanet in time, or would be something\n&gt; of clearly alien manufacture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Upon feeling the..  Ghosts upon hi ssensors, Wheelie stayed quiet.  He did\n&gt; not know what they were, but he felt the chill upon ihs spark regardless.\n&gt; Yet he could not see them, out of the corner of his optics or on any sort of\n&gt; sensor.  Yet there was something there, if even nothing more than his own\n&gt; unease.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the very least, hopefully there would be SOMETHING ahead in th structure\n&gt; to give him a goal..  Or, otehrwise if he was being pursued, to give him a\n&gt; bit of cover he could use to shield himself if eh came under attack!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nIf a building could be said to be transmetal this one was it - Part\nearth and stone and part metal it looked much like a pyramid built out\nof stone and metal rising up at least 30 or 40 feet into the air.\nHowever instead of meeting at a point the last bit is a bit squared\noff, not quite the egyptian pyrmaid that might come to mind of a\nhuman, had they been approaching as WHEELIE was.\n\nThe structure was surrounded by a stone wall with an open gate, one\nthat the path WHEELIE was on was going towards. As he approached he\ncould see a single figure standing at the gate as if waiting for him.\n\nThe figure is in the photos section of the club site:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/306782857/pic/1443963172/view\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
