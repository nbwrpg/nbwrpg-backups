So I&#39;ll be slow posting. Sorry.\n&gt;\n&gt; * D watched as the land approached, wriggling but then becoming still\nagain\n&gt; once the island&#39;s solid earth was under his feet though his toes had not\nyet\n&gt; touched it.\n&gt; He wimpered one last time before Fenux landed, moving quickly so that his\n&gt; front paws touched the ground before his back. It felt so good!\n&gt; But this whole place was strange!\n&gt; He had grown in a star ship, he didn&#39;t know what living on a planet was\nlike\n&gt; and it was frightening as well as exciting.\n&gt; D curled into a tight ball as soon as all four linbs were on land, his\ntail\n&gt; curled around hos side and his ears flat against his skull. His nose\nsniffed\n&gt; carefully in every direction, pizzled on what this place was and taking in\n&gt; it&#39;s smells.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
