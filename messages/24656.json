Time to \nuse the main turret!\n\nCyberwolf sent me an email saying that he wouldn&#39;t be able to post \ntill Monday and that I had his chars till he&#39;s back, but it wasn&#39;t \nvery clear when he was leaving, so if he doesn&#39;t post tomorrow, I \nguess I get the Trainers for now.\n\n::Zardus/Havoc/Lavacons/Slayer/The Iron Fist::\n\nZardus raises an eyebrow at Prebon&#39;s reply. &quot;I don&#39;t think attacking \na full powered battle cruiser, especially with only five bots on your \nside, is very logical. But I do have a more logical solution, if you \ncare to listen.&quot;\n\nHe smiles, noticing that the attackers were on the beach. Zardus taps \na few buttons on his wrist comp.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRecieving several commands from Zardus&#39;s wrist comp, the Iron Fist \nactivates its main cannon. A panel slides aside on the top of it, and \na mean looking large cannon slides out. It aims at the shore of \nSpain, three miles away, where most of the attackers were.\n\nA wide glowing beam emerges from the cannon, making its way with \ngreat speed toward the beach. It hits land in three seconds, with \nmore energy than it had used last time during its demonstration of \ndestroying a whole mountain.\n\nThe shockwave from the blast reaches even the Alliance base, although \nthe cannon was designed not to leave a big shockwave. Water rushes \ninto the beach, which was now little more than smoking rocks. Hissing \nand steam rise up as cold water hits the rocks, making the area \ncompletely impossible to see through, although the Iron Fist&#39;s \nscanners were not affected by the water. The beach was destroyed.\n\nThe Iron Fist continues to fire its defences, missile launchers and \nlaser bolts streaming out toward the trainers, a missile toward each \none, along with a dozen or so bolts.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc stares in surprise as the Iron Fist destroys the shore of \nSpain. Several shots hit the shields in front of him, reminding him \nthat he was in a battle.\n\nHavoc fires two more missiles at Bullet. Even though he couldn&#39;t see \nhim, he could easily pick him up with the scanners.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAstral yelps as the beach that he was flying over is destroyed. He \ndoesn&#39;t see the shots, and two of them slam into his leg. He growls, \nflying upward and waiting till he could see again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFenox spins out of the way of the missiles, firing several shots back \nat them to make sure they didn&#39;t come back around. She looked ahead, \ntwo shots from Blaze slamming into her left shoulder. Diving down, \nshe flies under Blaze, firing up at the bot as the shore below them \nis destroyed.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStarlight dived out of the way, the bolt from Bullet grazing her back \nand leaving a wide scorch mark on it. She growls, taking out her \ncharge launcher and firing two charges at Bullet. The charges lock on \nmagnetically, zooming through the air to their target.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer erupts from the water, a mad-looking Recklessa flying after \nhim seconds later.\n\n&quot;Yes, I&#39;m perfectly fine,&quot; he replies, spinning in the air to avoid a \nmissile from Recklessa. Several bolts from the Iron Fist nearly hit \nhis head.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Prebon recieved Zardus&#39; transmission. &quot;They&#39;re still able to \ncommunicate?\n&gt; Itold Blaze to make sure to eliminate that possability.&quot; He wasn&#39;t \nhappy\n&gt; about how disorganized this organized attack was becoming, his \ntrainers were\n&gt; working well together but were still being sloppy. &quot;Hello Zardus, \nyou have\n&gt; an impressive ship, I must admit for Predacon technology it has it&#39;s\n&gt; advantages.&quot; he didn&#39;t want to keep the line open or he knew that \nthe ships\n&gt; defenses would lock on to him but he couldn&#39;t help to gloat. &quot;I \nfunction for\n&gt; the fight, I&#39;m programmed for battle, and I attack you because it \nis the\n&gt; most logical strategic move for this battle. Unless of course you \nhave a\n&gt; more logical solution.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
