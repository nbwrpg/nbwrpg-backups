So, this was going to be her new home. It looked rugged, and too unorganized to be Predacon worthy. What she didn&#39;t like was the thought of the little snake-bot being the leader of them. It just didn&#39;t settle down in her mind right. He had a harem, or those two females just favored him. She hoped they were because she wasn&#39;t going to be a part of it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She looked over and saw KitKat in the distance. She listened in. She was looking for Rowdy Wolf. She walked closer until she was close enough for her to reach her mind. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You won&#39;t find him, &lt;/EM&gt;she said to her. &lt;EM&gt;He is what your little snake-bot would have become.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;From: logomorph@... &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Date: Sun, 30 Jul 2000 23:57:47 -0000 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;::KitKat:: &lt;BR&gt;&gt;She tried her link again. &quot;Hey Rowdy, you copy?
