The ship, heavily damaged from metor collisions and interior \nexplosions, lit up the sky as it burned, leaving a huge smoke trail \nas it fell.  The metal on the hull started to melt from the heat of \nthe atmospheric friction as it fell. The ship was headed for a hill  \ntwo miles from the maximal ship, Cybertron Fire.   Just before \nimpact, a small pod was ejected out of the ship. The huge ship hit \nthe ground and exploded on inpact.  A bright flash of light could be \nseen from miles around from the explosion.  The ground shook and a \nhuge crater was left from the inpact and explosion.  Debrie and \nrubble was all that was left of the once huge craft. Bits of bots and \nparts were strung out around through the refuse of what used to be \nthe ship.  \n\nThe pod had landed and finally came to rest along the bottom of a dry \ncreek bed. About a mile from the maximal base.  The bot inside was a \njuevenal.  It had a form, that of a small saber tooth tiger kitten.  \nShe lay on her side inside the pod, in stasis lock. Shortly after \nlanding, the pod started to emitt a small homing beacan signal.\n\n\n"}}
