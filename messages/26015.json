See, I&#39;m against you saying \n&gt; Hell in\n&gt; &gt; this RPG too.  NOT because it&#39;s sometimes considered swearing, only \n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; it is not proper transformer language.  Any Transformers/BW/BM fan \n&gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; that &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot; are not the proper terms for the \n&gt; transformers&#39;\n&gt; &gt; heaven and hell\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Our Version:  Heaven\n&gt; &gt; Transformer Version:  The Matrix\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Our Version:  Hell\n&gt; &gt; Transformer Version:  The Pit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     So there ya go.
