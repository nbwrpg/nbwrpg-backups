Happens quite frequently during the winter \nunfortunately.  I lost all the e-mails I read, so I&#39;m just going by memory.  \nSorry if it&#39;s a little off, I&#39;m also not up-to-date on events in the battle)\n\n\nThe Oblitercons/Sixshot/Demon Wulf/Dark Claw/Flesh Ripper/Double \nPunch/Manterror/Injector/Bumblebee/Ares/Serpentor/Unitron/Chordate/Caitiff/\nShockwave/Nemesis Enforcer/Scattershot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark One barell rolled, dodging numerous blasts, an EMP shot hitting the tip \nof his left wing.  Fortunately, that part of his form was entirely useless, \nat least in the ways of circuitry and such.  He fired off two \nenergy-signature seeking missiles off at Lunaprine, who was attacking \nSerpentor.\n\n---\n\nBreakdown fired off another explosive shell from his artillery form at Hot \nRod.\n\n---\n\nPyro fired off three fireballs at the CF.\n\n---\n\nHiss fired off three fusion cannons, taking out an EMP cannon, autogun fire \nraking across his body and causing him to fall to his knees.\n\n---\n\nScavenger fired off twenty-five explosive rounds at Angel Prime.\n\n---\n\nSixshot&#39;s underbelly got hit with a blast, and he began to head straight for \nthe ground.  He pulled up a little, firing off two missiles at the CF, one \ntaking out three autoguns, the other blowing up against the shields.\n\n&quot;Gotta, make this, count.&quot; Sixshot yelled, transforming in mid air, slamming \nto the ground on his treads, the sides of the treads covered in heavy armor \nso they couldn&#39;t be simply shot.  He armed his cannon with laser energy.\n\n---\n\nDemon Wulf fired off a missile blade at Angel Prime from his sword, the blade \nquickly replaced as autogun fire raked over his legs, but causing little \ndamage.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw fired off two missiles from his attack vehicle form at Depth \nCharge.  An EMP blast hitting an unimportant part of his body.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper fired off ten red rapid optic blasts at Angel Prime&#39;s left knee, \ncharging forward at the enemy.\n\n---\n\nManterror kept his momentum, speeding up as an EMP blast nearly struck him, \nhe pulled up, dodging (Lunaprine&#39;s character, don&#39;t know name) unwittingly, \nbut still didn&#39;t know (Lunaprine&#39;s character) was there.  He fired off two \nmore ion disks, each penetrating into the chest of Caitiff.\n\n---\n\nDouble Punch walked around in his stealth mode, looking for a target.\n\n---\n\nInjector flew at the CF, firing off ten rapid optic blasts, followed by six \nstinger missiles, three from each weapon, all heading towards the \nCybertornian Fire.\n\n---\n\nBumblebee caught an autogun blast into his chest, which surprisingly pierced \ninto his body.  He raised both stinger missile launchers, firing off two \nmissiles each, the autogun blowing apart.\n\n---\n\nAres swerved his turret to face the Cybertronian Fire, firing off four \npowerful blasts from each of his cannons (sixteen shots in all) at the \nmassive warship.\n\n---\n\nSerpentor yelled as Lunaprine tackled him, but the Alliance warrior kept his \nwits and fired off an optic blast at Lunaprine&#39;s face, and brought out his \nenergy blade from subspace in his left hand, but kept it deactivated.\n\n---\n\nNemesis Enforcer flew through the air like a bat out of hell.  Coincidently \nin his giant bat mode.  The wings pulled back, numerous changes going on \nthrough his body, the winged biped form of Nemesis now apparent, a missile \nlauncher launching off a rocket at the Maximal warship.\n\n---\n\nScattershot touched to the ground, raising his rifle, looking around for any \ntargets.\n\n------\n\nChordate sighed as Kluster left without replying.  He pressed a few buttons, \nbringing the missile launchers online.  All five of them.  He pressed another \nbutton, firing off a single missile from each launcher.\n\n------\n\nUnitron hovered in his space fighter mode, when his sensors detected activity \nin the missile launchers of the Cybertronian Fire.  He activated his laser \nweaponry and charged forward at full speed with his engines blazing.\n\n&quot;Perfect.&quot; he said to himself, followed by a chuckle.  He saw one of the \nmissiles coming out, and he instinctively fired off twenty-five rapid laser \nblasts, the blasts intercepting the missile before it even left the missile \ntube.\n\n------\n\nChordate&#39;s scanner readings of the shields at 54% changed into a big red \n&quot;WARNING: EVACUATE BRIDGE IMMEDIATELY&quot; the flashed and played over and over \nagain.\n\n&quot;What the...?&quot;\n\nUnknown to Chordate, the missile in Missile Tube Three exploded before it \neven left the tube, and as a new missile was being armed only five feet \nbehind it.  As the first missile exploded from Unitron&#39;s laser blasts, the \nresulting explosion setting off the other missile, soon taking out the entire \nmissile launcher and blowing a small hole that was only 5 X 5 ft in diamter \nin the side of the Cybertronian Fire.\n\nChordate let out a yell as the main control panel of the CF glowed a bluish \nwhite for a second, then exploded, the resulting flames and scrap metal \ndigging into the Maximal&#39;s face.  Chordate let out a scream of pain and fell \nbackwards in his feet, rolling all over the floor screaming, mech-fluid \nleaking from his face over his hands.  He knew at least one optic sensor had \nbeen destroyed, and may have been so irreversably.  But he continued to \nscream in agony, hundreds of tiny metal and glass pieces stuck in his face.\n\n-------\n\nCaitiff jumped, but to no avail.  The ion disks pierced in his chest, and cut \nthrough his spark.  As the ion disks came into contact with his spark, the \nexplosion from the inside ripped him apart, killing him almost instantly.\n\n=====\n\nShockwave&#39;s long range scanners detected a battle at the ice continent of \nAntarctica.  He transformed into his space fighter mode, activating his \nengines and blasting full speed for the site of battle at Antarctica from the \nlarge island continent of Australia.\n\n"}}
