In a moment a beam flys down as eight \nblack rings surround the load and then transport it up and into the \nships cargo hold. Inside the ship the mysterious infecticon watches \nover a display on the arm rest of his command chair and then looks to \nDiablo and Demonite.\n\n????: &quot;It is done?&quot;\n\nDemonite: &quot;Yes my lord. All equipment has been retrieved and \ntransported.&quot;\n\n????: &quot;How about the crew?&quot;\n\nAs the mysterious infecticons says this the pale blue female robogt \nknown as Frostbite steps forward.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;The ships crew has been transported to the stasis hold. \nTHe unknown is currently awaiting in the medical bay awaiting to be \nawakened.&quot;\n\n????: &quot;Very well. I shall go speak with this being as well as \nBlacknightmare. Have this ship go back into the ocean where it once \nwas. Once we are clear of the island... Order Lucenite to destroy it \nwith the Fury cannon. After this we shall assault Maximal City.&quot;\n\nFrostbite: &quot;At once.&quot;\n\nThe mysterious infecticon then stands and turns around before he \nleaves the presence of the others. Frostbite then sits in the command \nchair. A moment later the ship heads back towards its previous \nresting place in the ocean. Meanwhile, once again the three support \ncannons of the Fury cannon glow and prepare to fire as deep in the \nocean at the main infecticon Complex Lucenite cackles as it presses \nvarious buttons. A secodn later the ocean lights up withj an intense \nlight as the fury cannon itself begins to glow as an intense field of \nenergy forms within it and begins to move upward and outward. \n\nBack inside the Oblivion, various devices travel over Chaostaurs body \nand begin to make any necessary repairs as the Mysterious infecticon \napproaches the Medical bay. In the same room as Chaostaur is \nblackknightmare. Inside there is no visible door only black walls \nthat have a slight glow to them.\n\n\n"}}
