He \nwould get to the crash site soon.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The ship that burns through the atmosphere is on a coarse towards \nturkey,\n&gt; and huge shockwaves from the sound of its engines blowing up, \nscatter the\n&gt; earth. Inside, the little red robot in the control chair gets flung \nback\n&gt; out of the chair and against the larger robot who is trying to put \nout the\n&gt; fires with liquid nitrogen. The two collide, and land in the stream \nof\n&gt; Liquid Nitrogen, being frozen in the beam. The little blue robot \npresses\n&gt; the button on the control pad to keep the emergency message playing \nat\n&gt; intervals, and just as he presses it, he is flung up against and \nengine\n&gt; wall, his back being seriously burnt, and a sickening thud can be \nheard as\n&gt; his head hits metal, and rips apart.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ship then makes hard impact with the ground, and leaves a huge \nrunning\n&gt; crater as it moves forward, through the earth. It then runs to a \nstop, and\n&gt; the back of it explodes violently, sending pieces of burning \nshrapnel miles\n&gt; around. The two frozen robots get thrown violently, and the larger \nones\n&gt; casing shatters, as his arm goes with it, he weakly looks up, and \nthen\n&gt; colapses. Everything turns silent, except for the repeating message,\n&gt; &quot;emergency, our ship is out of control, we will require assistance, \nand\n&gt; more than likely,\n&gt; repairs when we crash&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
