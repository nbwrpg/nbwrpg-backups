It would make for an interesting plot.  I want\n&gt; ideas about this, not \n&gt; opinions, LN that means no saying that&#39;s stupid\n&gt; unless you want to suggest \n&gt; something better to the whole group.  If you think\n&gt; this idea is terrible I \n&gt; want a better idea.\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup\nhttp://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
