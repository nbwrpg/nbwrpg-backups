Listen after the last battle I dug some \nbunker holes in the ground, they are covered and look natural.  There is \na path from my quarters into them, I need five of you to go into a \ndifferent bunker each, when they are in the right spot, I will give a \nsignal, then you jump through, it is primitive but will give us the \nadvantage.  Sarge, why don&#39;t you, Papertron, and Birdbot take three of \nthe bunkers, Areotaur and I can take the other two. I will be able to \ntell where they are with my vibration detector.  We must hold them off \nuntil Windlord arrives with hopefully Maximal help.  Now does that sound \nok. And where is BH and that other.&quot;\n\nRudra656@... wrote:\n\n&gt; OOC: Aerotaur is still at the base.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;     &quot;Hmm.  I knew they wouldn&#39;t stay away.
