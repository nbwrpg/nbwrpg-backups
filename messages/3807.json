She started back down the \nhallway and came to another room.  She saw Black Arachnia\nand Quickstrike talking.  She walked in and looked at both bots.\n&quot;Excuse me, I was just wondering where the living quarters were.  I&#39;m new \nhere and seemed to have gotten lost.  Could either of you two give me \ndirections to the spare living quarters?&quot;\n\nShe looked at Quickstrike for a moment.  She recognized him from somewhere \nbut couldn&#39;t remember where she had seen him.  Her stomach suddenly \ntightened on her as she looked at him.  She knew his face from somewhere.  \nShe searched her memory banks but could only find hazy images. Her \nreprogramming wiped alot of her memory out.  Who was he? Was he something to \nher before the reprogramming? She shook her head to clear her mind.  She \nsuddenly felt the urge to run away from these images and erased feelings.  \nShe felt that there was a reason she went through the reprogramming.  Maybe \nhe had something to do with it.  She just couldn&#39;t remember.\n\n&quot;Uh, never mind.  I&#39;m sorry to have bothered you two.  I&#39;ll find it on my \nown thanks.&quot;\n\nShe turned and walked down the hallway feeling her stomach tying up into \nknots.  For a moment, she thought she&#39;d lose her lunch.  She ran down the \nhallway and found an empty room.  She thought it may have been one of the \nspare living quarters she was looking for.  She laid down on the bed and \ncaught her breath.  Why was this happening.  Who was he? Why would any bot \nstir emotion in her and like that? How could one bot override her logic \ncircuits like that.  What was wrong with her?\n-----------------Original Message--------------\n&gt;From: &quot;Talon Harvilicz&quot; &lt;wilddance_mare@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Quickstrike:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Quickstrike gasped as he heard Black Arachnia&#39;s voice. He turned his head \n&gt;to\n&gt;her, with his eyes bright. &quot;Uuh, no, we&#39;re fine.&quot; The curving strips at the\n&gt;side of his cheeks quivered. &quot;Jus&#39; uh little tired wit&#39; these tin-horn&#39;s\n&gt;attitudes, ya know what ah mean? Don&#39;t wanna do their job.&quot; He shook his\n&gt;head, trying to change the subject.\n&gt;\n&gt;What should he say? He wanted to be with her again, but somewhere in his\n&gt;brain he thought that was stupid. He once hated her.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;So, uuh...didn&#39;t mean t&#39; leave ya back there. Duty called.&quot; He chuckled.\n&gt;&quot;Ya want&#39;d t&#39; talk?&quot;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
