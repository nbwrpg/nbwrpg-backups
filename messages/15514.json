Veratis was a week \nold bot who didn&#39;t seem to pose much of a threat but that&#39;s when \nthings have been hitting him lately. \n\nBoth bots remained silent for a long time before the silence was \nfinally broken by Veratis. &quot;You seem tired my friend, how long has it \nbeen since you recharged?&quot; The scientist seemed naturally worried \nabout his guest but he had other things on his mind as well.\n\nLunarpine couldn&#39;t understand Veratis&#39;s hospitality but his host had \nyet to give him any reason to deny his problems. &quot;It&#39;s been a while, \nI think that It&#39;s been a day or so. I could be wrong.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you must rest my new friend.&quot; Veratis&#39; grin showed no more than \na lonely bot looking for company. &quot;Sit right here and I&#39;ll be right \nback.&quot; The host left the room with a seemingly anxious manner.\n\nLunarpine knew that all this hospitality wasn&#39;t because of his hosts  \nneed for company. His wolf senses told him there were two others \naccompanying Veratis, thier scents were week so it&#39;d been some time \nsince thier departure. Still he didn&#39;t want to seem an ungrateful \nguest so he decided to play along for now.\n\nVeratis returned carrying a tray with old style energeon cubes, He \nplaced the tray between them and picked up two. He handed one to \nLunarpine and held one up to himself. &quot;You still don&#39;t trust me? well \nthen a toast, To the earning of trust.&quot; he then raised the cube to \nhis mettalic lips and drained it dry.\n\nThe cube handed to Lunarpine didn&#39;t smell right, it had a distinct \nscent added to it. He set it back on the tray and picked up another \none. this one smelled different, it was pure energeon, at least it \nsmelled pure. The wolf tipped his head back, looking at Veratis the \nwhole way. &quot;Ya to earning trust.&quot; He too sucked the energeon dry. It \nfealt reinviggorating to recharge. He tried to stand, to feal the \nenergy returning to his body. That was his second mistake. The \nwolfbot collapsed to the floor, going into stasis lock.\n\n\n"}}
