But thier journey had not been \nuneventful, due to an unplanned fight on board with the former crew, the \nship was noe plummeting towards the earth.\n\n  Upon re-entry the air around the ship&#39;s hull burst into flames, giving the \nship an image of a giant fireball heading towards the ground. Screaming over \nthe souther sky, Razorclaw was at least able to adjust course to land them \nin the water.   The co-ordinates showed that they would be landing close to \nwhat would be called the Azores Islands.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
