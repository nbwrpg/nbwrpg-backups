All my shouting isn&#39;t getting my counter point across so \nlisten. I spent a large amount of my vacation comming up with the \n&quot;around the world&quot; and I&#39;d hate to feel I wasted my time. Their are \nno requirements for a ship at all and any illegal technology he might \nfind will take more power than is at his disposal. At the end of the \nstory a Rocak computer will tell him he can only be part Rocak when \nthey need him so he turns back to normal until they call again(hey \nafter a while the part Rocak stuff would get boring). Will it make \nyou any happier if I tell you I won&#39;t do anymore on that story until \nI finish with the &quot;Mutants&quot;. I will finish with this story,but it \nwon&#39;t totally crush me if you decide it&#39;s null and void. Just say \nit&#39;s part OOC(he he he). Further more I haven&#39;t gotten an answer \nabout if you&#39;ll settle for weekly posts on my part after scholl starts\n(it&#39;s my Freshman year for goodness sake).\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Stop yelling, and will you listen to me, I asked you to stop \nposting \n&gt; about the Rocak robot thing, and you don&#39;t seem to understand my \n&gt; simple request. How bout this: just stop making posts that refer to \n&gt; the work Rocak or the idea of the Rocak robot/ship. The council \n&gt; wishes to discuss it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t like to keep making ooC posts, so Dewboy, do understand \n&gt; what I&#39;m saying to you so I can stop making ooC comments? \n&gt; (understand what I&#39;m saying in this post and the last one for sure)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 31 Jul 2001, at 20:47, dewboy30816@y... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME!
