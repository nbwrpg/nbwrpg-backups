They \nwatches the Decepticons leave and smiled.\n\n&quot;That was pretty good.&quot; Mantle said while they made their way to a group of \nMaximals. They were about to greet them when Iron Raptor called everyone to \nattention, and they followed everyone else&#39;s example and got into line.\n\n\nTruttle walked to Cledar and looked at all the robots around him. He then \nspun around and saluted along with Cledar and the rest of his group.\n\n\nCyndro scanned all the Decepticons while they retreated and saved them all \nin a file. He knew what tactics they used now and the next battle against \nthem would be easier. His nanobots were still working on adapting the \nCybertronian Fire&#39;s shield generators completely to his own, but work was \ngoing well. A large plate of metal slid apart on top of the center of \nMaximal City and two sets of solar panels emerged. One of the sets was the \nElement&#39;s and the other one was the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s. The panels quickly \nbegan powering the ship back up, and the shields almost instantly rose to \none hundred percent.\n\nCyndro heard Iron Raptor call to him but she was gone before he could \nanswer. He continued his work on the city but kept an eye out for what was \ngoing on outside with the Maximals while his nano probes began tyding up the \nland and removed scrap and traces of battle from it.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
