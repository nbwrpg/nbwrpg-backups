I am impressed. I am sure you\n&gt;   had some hand in it&#39;s designs. Please, give me the guided tour.&quot;  She\n&gt;   took a few steps and stopped. &quot;I would also like to hear more of your\n&gt;   specialties. After all, I know that your leader wouldn&#39;t have sent any\n&gt;   less than one of his best for me. So I know that you are a master in\n&gt;   your field. So, when I get settled in, you would tell me more of\n&gt;   yourself and this base. After all, how can any member of an effective\n&gt;   team function to thier highest capacity if they don&#39;t even know thier\n&gt;   own, eh, backyard, so to speak?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
