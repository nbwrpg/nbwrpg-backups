First thing, Rudrak is now the owner of the rpg. It \nneeded to be done since me staying the owner right now is rather \nsilly. I just don&#39;t have any time set aside for role playing right \nnow, so -- if it wasn&#39;t obvious already -- I&#39;m taking a break. I&#39;m \nnot gunna say that I&#39;m gunna be back on a specific day, but I do \nthink that I will return eventually.\n\nI guess that Noir will have to be under cardhead&#39;s control till the \nend of the battle. And ya, Aerosmith yer gunna be controlling Hydras \nfor a while longer, I hope you don&#39;t mind. =) As for Switchblade, he \ncan stay as an NPC repair bot in the Predacon base if nobody has any \ncomplaints. Also, should anyone want to use any of my characters \n(this being unlikely since most people are busy with their own \ncharacters =p) then you can email me anytime at x_rauq_x@....\n\nRudrak mentioned that elections are gunna happen again (to fill my \nspot probably), and I wish all who aspire to gain more influence \ngood luck. =)\n\nJeff (-rAuq-x)\n\n\n"}}
