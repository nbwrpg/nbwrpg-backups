Known by some as a wise elder who had\n&gt; =\r\nbeen on CYBERTRON for quite some time, acting within the council and\n&gt; then=\r\n eventually going into seclusion. He had not been heard from in\n&gt; quite som=\r\ne time.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he turned to regard different ones his MAXIMAL insignia was=\r\n clearly\n&gt; visable to all.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, him your leader now!&quot; GRIMLOCK said t=\r\no SWOOP as hethen turned\n&gt; and growled dangerously at BACKSTOP. &quot;I will des=\r\ntroy him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; SWOOP shook his head, &quot;No Gimlock, you always leader!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n BACKSTOP held up his hands, fingers opened wide in a gesture of peace.\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nNo Grimlock, I command no one, your troops are your own.&quot; BACKSTOP&#39;s\n&gt; voic=\r\ne was the voice of a wise elder, a sage.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Me Slag say let&#39;s smash!&quot; SL=\r\nAG said, SLUDGE and SNARL grumbled in agreement.\n&gt; \n&gt; GRIMLOCK stomped the =\r\nground sending shockwaves through it. &quot;No!&quot; He\n&gt; said as he looked over at =\r\nWHEELIE, &quot;What do you mean? Me Grimlock no\n&gt; sing.&quot; He seemed confused, but=\r\n somehow focused on WHEELIE. &quot;Explain\n&gt; what you mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; However even a=\r\ns GRIMLOCK spoke his words were once again going from a\n&gt; fight for control=\r\n to all an out anger and rage. &quot;Explain now, me\n&gt; Grimlock demand it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n BACKSTOP glanced at WHEELIE, &quot;He will need help to overcome this.\n&gt; Someht=\r\ning has affected his programing.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\nThat got a LOOK from WHEELIE, him mu=\r\nttering the Cybertronian aphorism &#39;No Slag Nightbeat&#39; under his vocalizer t=\r\no the last comment over from Backstop, equivalent and translatable to the o=\r\nld Terran descriptor for a fabled detective stating the blindingly obvious.=\r\n\n\n\nWHEELIE nodded up sadly at GRIMLOCK, &quot;Fighting wtihin his own mind, he c=\r\nannot find someone to protect his behind.  Out of it how to get him I do no=\r\nt know, but remain this way he cannot go.&quot;\n\nPausing up and running through =\r\nhis processor any conceivable way they could do.  They could not leave GRIM=\r\nLOCK out here and abandon him to the jungle and recapture by whomever contr=\r\nolled him.  They could not take him with them in search and risk him attack=\r\ning them each time his resistance was disrupted.  They couldn&#39;t do a proces=\r\nsor jack-up out here in the field either to try and upload themselves to GR=\r\nIMLOCK&#39;s central processor.  Appealing to GRIMLOCk&#39;s pride only seemed to w=\r\nork as a part time blockage..\n\nFinally, WHEELIE glanced at the others, &quot;All=\r\n of you, go after who did this to him.  Here I will stay, with him.  I will=\r\n try to keep him occupied, the rest of you free him for his pride.  Away fr=\r\nom the scene, we shall go, wtih luck you shall be able to free him, how I d=\r\no not know.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
