After making sure they&#39;re out \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; earshot, she looks at her old friend.  &quot;Okay, what&#39;s up?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics glanced about. &quot;They may still here us,&quot; looking up at the \n&gt; base. &quot;No matter.&quot; then she looked at her comrade. &quot;I was restored in \n&gt; this form for some reason, which is unknown to me. However, I don&#39;t \n&gt; plan to stay in this pathetic form for long. I crached not far from \n&gt; here. The ship contains large amounts of supplies... metallic \n&gt; supplies. I intend to use them to reconstruct my old form. However, I \n&gt; lack the skill to do it. Now, as I have come to find out, that we are \n&gt; in Earth past.&quot; She smirked. &quot;I intend to find the Ark. Teletran-1 \n&gt; can reconstruct my form.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You are more than welcome to join me & rebuild your form back to the \n&gt; noble Seeker you were during the Great War.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She paused. &quot;Are you with me? If not, no matter, I will do this \n&gt; alone. Would attract less attention. I do not intend to jeopardize \n&gt; our comrades in stasis in the Ark. I have a feeling though, that we \n&gt; will be needed to protect it eventually.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
