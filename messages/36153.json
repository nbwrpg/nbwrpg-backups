His opponent was about one third his height. He lifts his fist and swings it down, attempting to slam it into Dogged&#39;s head.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He&#39;s a little taller than the origional Bumblebee if we&#39;re still going by\n&gt; old  Autobot and  Decepticon hight, about 5 feet if we&#39;re stuck with Beast\n&gt; wars hight. Either way he&#39;s shorter than average.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dogged leaps up to about the hight of  &quot;the bums&quot; chest throwing a jab. The\n&gt; only chance he saw for victory was to punch the waste material out of his\n&gt; opponents.\n\n\n"}}
