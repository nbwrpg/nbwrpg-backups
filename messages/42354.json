Her vision was returning.  She slowly opened \nher optics and notice two very large figures standing over her.  She \nrubbed her optics with her paws and looked at them again. Her vision \nwas clear now. She saw the two dragons from earlier.  She tried to \njump to her feet, but her hind feet didn&#39;t want to co-operate. She \ntransformed into bot mode and stood there, on shakey legs. &quot;Who are \nyou? Why did you attack me? I didn&#39;t attack you? You know, that \nwasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;  She drew her sidearm, but kept it at her side. If \nthey hadn&#39;t killed her by now, then they must have a reason for \nkeeping her alive. &quot;Would you please explain to me what is going on?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
