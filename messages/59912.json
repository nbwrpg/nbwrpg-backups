He \nwanders \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outside of the base, searching for lava tubes or something.  \n&gt; After \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about a megacycle of wandering and searching, he finally found \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; basalt based lava flow and transformed.  He wadded about knee \n&gt; deep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and absorbed the heat so he would not melt or warp his legs.  \nHe \n&gt; &gt; got \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a hand full of the heavy thick stuff, and drew the heat out, \n&gt; &gt; leaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a solid mass.  He then dipped it into the lava, pulled it out, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated the process until it was halfway up his chest after \n&gt; &gt; several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; megacycles.  He rolled it out of the lava stream and began to \n&gt; roll \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back to the base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two megacycles later, Malice finally rolled the crude sphere \n&gt; &gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ball into the base.  He rolled it into the cargo bay, and went \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; find Wolfblade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hey Wolfblade, I finished the sphere!
