She still had her old cuffs on.\nShe walked over to the wall and leaned against it. She folded her \narms to cover her wrists. &quot;Well, the cuffs would not only control the \nbot, but relay all actions that the bot did to the council. It \nconstantly monitored the bot&#39;s movements as well as it&#39;s thoughts.  \nThe one who had the main controlling computer could control the the \nbot totally. The bot&#39;s mind, actions,feelings, everything.&quot; She \nlooked down and sighed.  &quot;Those things aren&#39;t what I would call a \ngood thing. They can do strange things to a bots mind if left to \ncontrol the bot to long.&quot; \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; GTG.
