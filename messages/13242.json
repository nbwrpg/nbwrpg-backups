Just toss him out \n&gt; and forget him.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Megatron.  She was afraid of him, and it was writen on \n&gt; her face.  BUt she would stand her ground.  &quot;Commander, Phobis had \n&gt; said he had other weapons taht would aid us.  In trying to save \n&gt; Etchingar, who didn&#39;t make it, I retireved a highly specialized \n&gt; energon rifle.  Phobia has promised other weapons.
