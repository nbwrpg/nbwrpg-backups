She was an assassin, not a muscled warrior.  &quot;Oh yeah, \nthat&#39;s rich. You don&#39;t want to hurt me, you just want to kill me. I&#39;m \nnot ready to meet the matrix yet.  I escaped from the Predacon \ncouncil, and I&#39;ll get out of here.&quot; she looked and hoped she would \nfind something.  She looked out into the middle of the cargo bay and \nfound just what she was looking for.  A small floor drain.  The last \nplace that they would think to find her and with luck, it would lead \noutside.  She transformed into rattle snake and slithered towards the \ndrain.  She had a little trouble pulling the cover off the drain, but \nkept talking to cover up audiably waht she was doing and hopefully \nbuy enough time for her to get away.  &quot;You know, if things had been \ndifferent, I think I could have fallen for a bot like you.  I like \nyou.  Your as efficiant a killer as I.  Had we met up on Cybertron, I \nthink we might have made quite a pair.&quot;  She almost had the cover off.\n&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a shame that you want me dead so badly. I think we could \nhave made a good team.&quot; A little more and the cover would be off.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::DevilDuer::\n&gt; \n&gt; DevilDuer nods, looking from Catgut to Threadshot. &quot;I got a lock \non &#39;er, she \n&gt; ain&#39;t gettin&#39; away.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He glances at his scanner, &quot;Allright, I&#39;ll take care of her. \nThere&#39;s a battle \n&gt; going on not far from here, if you guys want some action, you can \ngo join. \n&gt; Don&#39; let the femm out though! Make sure to close blast doors behind \nya.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He runs off down a hallway, slowing down as he approaches the cargo \nhold. \n&gt; Blast doors were closing behind him as he walked, and the same \nthing was \n&gt; happening at the cargo hold&#39;s end.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gun out, DevilDuer walks forward, ready for battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t wanna hurt ya,&quot; he yells to the hallway, &quot;Just come \nout \n&gt; peacefully, you&#39;ll be allright.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
