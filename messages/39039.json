He orders a meeting between our faction and yours to \ndiscuss the future leadership.

Heater was right behind him.  As they jumped out \nbellows of smoke poured out of his tank cockpit.

In a couple \nminutes he was out and Tiptop dropped Quake&#39;s back end down.\n\nHeater looked at him.  &quot;Quake you melted your transmission again, \nluckily I patched it up nice and good. Now lets go.&quot; The two nebulans \njumped back into the tank and Quake drove off.\n\nQuake spoke to Apeface.  &quot;Do you have any readings monkeyface on the \nsalthater.&quot;  Quake gave out a chuckle thinking his pointless jokes funny.\n\n0-------------------------------------------------------------------0\n\nDreadwind flew out of the cave housing the D.E.D base.
