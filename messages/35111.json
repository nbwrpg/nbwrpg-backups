He looks back at the city. He knew that it was neccessary. If they CF hadn&#39;t been dismantled, the Decepticons would probably be carrying its pieces back to their base right now. But still, he hadn&#39;t wanted to hurt IR by having the city built. He looks over at IR again.\n\n-Its hard switching homes, but hopefully this one is permenant.- he says to her and gives her a small squeeze with the arm he had around her, reaching Maximal City and entering, guiding IR beside him.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * IR sighed and felt the final drain of the Matrix&#39;s power, leaving her the \n&gt; way she was before. As Iron Raptor, though still Arkness Prime.\n&gt; All but one of her modes was damaged, but it was well worth it.\n&gt; Though she looked back at Prowl and smiled, putting an arm around his \n&gt; shoulders and walking along with him towards the city. &lt; I love you too...&gt;.\n&gt; But still she felt an ache in her spark, where the CF use to be. She had \n&gt; grown to like that ship, though it kept getting beaten up.  She had thought \n&gt; of it as a home, like she had the Ark.\n&gt; Now both were gone.\n&gt; It was hard, trying to settle in only to have your home taken away, or made \n&gt; into something else.\n&gt; But this city could protect the Maximals better then the CF could,but still \n&gt; she felt uneasy. Almost like she would rather sleep outside instead.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
