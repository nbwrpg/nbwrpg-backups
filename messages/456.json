He wasn&#39;t scared of it, it just felt strange and alien to \nhim. A feeling that he wasn&#39;t use to and doubted that he would ever really \nknow.\nHe looked at the screen and scrolled down, that was when he came to \nMegatron&#39;s profile.\nDinobot growled deeply and snarled, he shut off the screen and slammed it \nback down...the last thing he needed to see was the very bot that had killed \nhim!! (the comp&#39;s like a laptop.)\nHe looked away then stood up, he had seen enough for that day!\nDinobot walked to the doorway and looked out at the doors, he would give \nanything to have Megatron&#39;s head in his hands. He&#39;d bury it 7 feet under and \nleave it there!\nHe growled again and clenched his fist, the raptor claw digging into his \npalm and causing mech fluid to drip onto the floor.\nDinobot closed his optics and opened his hand, he then looked at his \nbleeding palm and sighed...*\n\n&quot; It would be wise for you to get some rest before the battle, it could be a \nlong one.&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
