She growled and followed, catching up to him very \nquickly. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Foxfingers gets a quick whiff of someone comming the other way. he \n&gt; dives out of the doorway as the missles impact. The concussion \nsends \n&gt; him sliding into the wall on the other side of the hallway. the \ndoor \n&gt; was destroyed so Foxfingers decided to use it. &quot;Thanks for the \nkey.&quot; \n&gt; he calls to bludgeon as he scampers into it. (I&#39;ll keep this \n&gt; interesting and let either Kinger or Logo post where the door \nleads. \n&gt; whomever posts first makes the call.)\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
