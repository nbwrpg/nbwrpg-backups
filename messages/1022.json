Her eyes kept shifting from side to side, this was a new area with new people, but she felt she could trust Iron Raptor. Her feet made a solid thunk as she ran, and that annoyed her, she liked being silent. But she couldn&#39;t carry anything as a panther*\n\n*She comes across the weapons hold and looks in awe at all the weapons. Teltoli picks up several huge looking guns, stores them in several places all over her body with straps so she looks like a walking weapon. She then picks up some more, careful to be able to hold one properly with one hand incase she needs it*\n\n*Exiting into the hall again, she looks left for where the other hall was supposed to be. Oh great*\n\n*She starts off running..*\n______________________________________________\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com\nSign up at http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n\n\n"}}
