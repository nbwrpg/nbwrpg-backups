The ship was going t=\r\no crash if they didn&#39;t do something\n&gt; fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going over to the power su=\r\npply panel he was surprised to see that it was\n&gt; fully operational.  He cou=\r\nldn&#39;t remember the last time it was\nfunctioning,\n&gt; but here it was.  He was=\r\n even more surprised to see that almost all\nmajor\n&gt; power grids were operat=\r\nional.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Then why are we crashing???&quot; he shouted to himself angrily.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Cyphia glanced over from her piloting station.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You should divert t=\r\nhe power from the prison ward and cargo\nsections.&quot; she\n&gt; said, almost sound=\r\ning like she was the one in command.  The captain\ndidn&#39;t\n&gt; seem to mind tho=\r\nugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wont the prisoners get out if we turn off the power to the\nforce=\r\nfields?  We\n&gt; don&#39;t know who&#39;s down there, we may be condemning them to the=\r\nir\ndeaths.&quot; he\n&gt; said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If we crash, we&#39;ll have much bigger problems t=\r\no deal with.  It\nlooks like\n&gt; security partitions are down in most the pris=\r\non sections.  I don&#39;t think\n&gt; most of them will be able to escape.  We don&#39;=\r\nt have any partitions\nin the\n&gt; holding cell area though.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The captain =\r\ntyped a few things on the control panel and a loud power\nsound\n&gt; could be h=\r\neard as the engines grew stronger.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Parts of the steering control seem=\r\n to be offline, but judging by the\n&gt; computer, we have about a 70% of getti=\r\nng back in orbit now...&quot; she said,\n&gt; unconvincingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Better than 0%..=\r\n.. and other ideas to boost the power?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; She didn&#39;t respond, =\r\nbecause she was looking out one of the small\nwindows on\n&gt; the bridge.  He w=\r\nalked behind her and looked out the window too.  A\nlarge\n&gt; orbital factory =\r\nwas about 80 nano-kliks away from the front of the ship.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The path the=\r\n computer has charted for us to get back into orbit\ngoes inside\n&gt; the safet=\r\ny margin of that orbital... there&#39;s a chance we might hit it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If the=\r\n only alternative is crashing.  I think we&#39;re going to have\nto take\n&gt; the r=\r\nisk.  Besides, as long as we just brush the surface of that\nthing, we\n&gt; sho=\r\nuldn&#39;t sustain any serious damage.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
