He walked up to \nher. &quot;You wanted to see me, commander,&quot; he asked, his eyes glinting \nmischevoustly. He glanced at Quizkstrike, on the chair, a bit \nsurprized to see his old teammate.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::KitKat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She checked the scanners. Megatron, Tarantulus, HellBeast, had gone \n&gt; to Aracnia&#39;s base. She opened her link. &quot;What is going on Megatron? \n&gt; Do you need any help?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She then checked her long range scanners and found where Destructor \n&gt; was at. She opened her link to him. &quot;Destructor, give me the reason \n&gt; to move, and we shall.&quot; She was following her insticts. And they \nsaid \n&gt; to follow Destructor.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at Quickstrike. &quot; Get ready, we&#39;re moving ourselves.&quot;\n&gt; She opened her link to DarkMouse, Drillbit, Dollen and \n&gt; GoldenEye. &quot;Hey all, we&#39;re moving. Grab your gear and all we might \n&gt; need. We&#39;re out of here. We got something that might be better and \n&gt; stand up to the Allience better.&quot;  At this point, she really had no \n&gt; idea what she was doing or where they were going, but her faith in \n&gt; her team was strong. She smiled, &quot;And Drillbit, I need to talk to \n&gt; you, in private, when you get a moment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She chuckled quietly to herself. She looked again at Quickstrike. \nShe \n&gt; put her hand on his shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again my \nfrined.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
