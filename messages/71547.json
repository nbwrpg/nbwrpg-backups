Behind Elita and rubs her head gently.\n\n&quot; Gotchya.  Nice try though. &quot;\n\nAs he interacts with her, a drop of condensation falls on his right \nshoulder.  He looks up to the ceiling and then back to Elita.\n\n&quot; I got a neat trick ta show ya.  And I&#39;m gonna teach it ta you&#39;n your \nfolks. Now, stay right there, hold out your paws, pads up, and watch \ncarefully.&quot;\n\nHe gently positions Elita&#39;s paws, steps back with a peaceful smile on his \nface, closes his eyes, and with a tranquil breath, slides his right foot \nacross the floor, starting from his left side, all the way to his right, in \na semi circle.\n\nAnother drop of condensation collects on the ceiling and forms another ball \nof moisture, which drips down from above.  Below it, Nightshift performs a \npoetic version of Tai Chi, and while going through one of the paces, the \nwater drop gently rolls down onto his arm without splattering and continues \nto stay intact as he moves with a peaceful grace and fluidity.  At the end \nof the performance, the water drop is caught on the top of his hand as he \nmanages to deposit it intact, into Elita&#39;s  paws.\n\n&quot; And there ya have it.  Master Yokitron called this Inner Peace.  One can \nonly find inner peace within themselves once they learn how ta accept and \nrecover from the demons of their past.   I&#39;m gonna teach you guys so many \nneat tricks, you&#39;re gonna make enemy heads spin clear off their body \nshells.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n\nOn Aug 2, 2011, at 1:29 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt; Nighlight/ELita:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nighlight came inside the Cr chamber and and looking to her daughter said\n&gt; &quot;Behave Elita and dont move away of Nightshift&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes mommiee&quot;said the child with a wide smile while she was in her beas \n&gt; mode\n&gt;\n&gt; Nighlight smiled and the cr closed.

You&#39;ll be able ta defend yourself no matter if \n&gt;&gt; ya\n&gt;&gt; got energy weapons or not.  Your body,mind and spark become your most\n&gt;&gt; powerful defense.  You&#39;ll see when I do a few demo rounds with you guys.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He chuckles quietly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; let&#39;s hope Rodimus joins in and pays attention this time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a nod from BUMP as the CR chamber for NIGHTLIGHT buzzed, &quot;It\n&gt; is ready.&quot; he said without much expression. &quot;Go ahead and enter. It\n&gt; will reconfigure you. However it will have to put you in stassis and\n&gt; reboot your systems.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; BUMP stepped over to help NIGHTLIGHT should she need it. &quot;I believe\n&gt; your systems are strong enough to handle it now, but you will be\n&gt; offline for a short while.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
