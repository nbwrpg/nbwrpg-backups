They look to Torca and Noctoro \nwith a reassuring grin on their muzzles.  Quickstride chimes in first.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s okay guys, if Perceptor was gonna pull a fast one on us, he would have \ndone it by now.  I think it&#39;s safe to say that he&#39;s officially on our side.&quot;\n\nUproar nods in agreement.\n\n&quot; I second that.  As we stand here right now, thanks to Perceptor, \nNightlight is coming back online.  He didn&#39;t have to do that but he did and \na good deed is worth a lot.&quot;\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jun 14, 2011, at 12:34 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nightlight had contradictories feelings about Perceptor&#39;s precences in \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; Ark, and she slowly rubbed Elita&#39;s head  and said &quot;How are you sure about\n&gt;&gt; that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; RODIMUS looked at his dear wife as he took her slender hand in his,\n&gt; “The interesting thing is, even when we were evil, working for Hydras,\n&gt; I still trusted him.” He shrugged, almost as if embarrassed by the\n&gt; admission. “He reminded me a little bit of Lord Elder here or maybe\n&gt; even an Ironhide. Stiff, gruff, but yet underneath there is something\n&gt; that cares.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Shrugging again RODIMUS gave his daughter a little tickle, “You can’t\n&gt; have mommy all to your self now.” He joked with her, a smile once\n&gt; again back on his normally haggard face.\n&gt;\n&gt; He continues to hold NIGHLIGHT’s hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *        *        *        *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Also in LEAGCY’s Chamber . . . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, in Legacy&#39;s chamber, Straight Shot now sees why he was so\n&gt;&gt; concerned about the time space continum.  She had not known what really\n&gt;&gt; happened, and at the time it did happen she had not yet been a part of \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; Autobot Faction.  She stands thoughtfully for a moment, now taking in \n&gt;&gt; what\n&gt;&gt; she had been missing for a long time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Wow, that part I never did understand..  That sure explains things. I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; glad I did talk to you, Legacy.  So by doing what he did, Starscream \n&gt;&gt; saved\n&gt;&gt; our faction...  I&#39;ve only heard bits&#39;n pieces about Starscream&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; relationship with Megatron, and from what I learned, they never did see \n&gt;&gt; eye\n&gt;&gt; to eye. Anyway, thanks for the explanation and the video feed, it was \n&gt;&gt; really\n&gt;&gt; useful. I better let ya get ta the bridge now.  Thanks again.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; She gets down from where she was standing and bids Legacy good bye for \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; time being.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; LEGACY just nodded once, the movement, a simple movement of the head\n&gt; and shoulders, but as with anything, it was cold and efficient.\n&gt; “Perhaps you would do well to study the history tapes. You may find\n&gt; other things of value as well.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Turning on a heel LEGACY exited his chamber, and as he did so several\n&gt; computer systems began to power down and the lights began to dim as if\n&gt; the room itself could sense that he was gone.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *        *        *        *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; MEANWHILE in the MAIN HALLS. . . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor looked at Torca and said &quot;What&#39;s wrong? If you trust enough to\n&gt;&gt; told me&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Windlord just arrived and listen carfully\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; TORCA looked at PERCEPTOR, his optics seeming to bore into the ex\n&gt; Predacon. Although most of the Maximals and Autobots were about the\n&gt; same size, there was something about the Fuzors that just emanated\n&gt; size, especially with ones like TORCA and NOCTORRO.\n&gt;\n&gt; “We will soon be sharing this with the rest of the crew, but we have\n&gt; words with Lord Elder first.” TORCA’s words were deep and yet\n&gt; powerful, his voice managing to almost echo in the hall they were\n&gt; walking through.\n&gt;\n&gt; NOCTORRO looked up at TORCA, “Legacy will be joining us there too.”\n&gt;\n&gt; ELDER glanced between the two, clearly not understanding either, “If\n&gt; Legacy is coming, why not the rest?”\n&gt;\n&gt; TORCA just shook his head. “When Tuscon is finished with his . . .”\n&gt; TORCA shrugged not quite how to put it, “. . . affairs and Rodimus is\n&gt; finished with his wife we will assemble everyone. And all will be made\n&gt; clear.”\n&gt;\n&gt; There was sorrow in LORD ELDER’s optics as he looked back at\n&gt; PERCEPTOR, “Later then. Until then, just walk with the others. I am\n&gt; sure this is just something preliminary.”\n&gt;\n&gt; ELDER glanced at UPROAR, “Until Uproar should be able to keep you busy.”\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Uproar smiles and salutes Lord Elder, enthusiastically addressing his\n&gt;&gt; request.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;You got it sir, I&#39;ll show him the Ark and the recharging chambers. Oh, \n&gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; the way, one more question.. Hydras knows Perceptor&#39;s one of us now, how \n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; we gonna fight &#39;em off if he tries another attack on the Ark?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ELDER looked at UPROAR, his optics somehow managing to be both wise\n&gt; and sad at the same time. “I am not sure yet. Perhaps that is\n&gt; something we will have to work out.”\n&gt;\n&gt; He glanced up at TORCA and NOCTORRO, neither of whom said anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; Glancing back at PERCEPTOR he smiled hopefully, “and perhaps Perceptor\n&gt; will have a few ideas as well. It would go a long way in settling some\n&gt; of the trust issues that some of the Maximals may still have.”\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;we willbe ready fot that&quot;replied Perceptor&quot;and we will have to start to\n&gt;&gt; work&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Uproar smiles to Perceptor.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Count me in Perceptor.  Whatever you need, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Quickstride also chimes in.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Same here, that windmill project may have ta go on hold.  We better work \n&gt;&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; how the heck we&#39;re gonna keep Hydras out without losing any more \n&gt;&gt; comrades..\n&gt;&gt; Heeeey, Perceptor, you&#39;re good at designing security systems..  If Uproar\n&gt;&gt; and I give you a hand, do you think you might be able to come up with\n&gt;&gt; something to keep the Ark&#39;s parameters safe?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; They look to him enthusiastically.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As UPROAR, QUICKSTRIDE and PERCEPTOR talked, ELDER and the two fuzors\n&gt; continued their way towards the bridge.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
