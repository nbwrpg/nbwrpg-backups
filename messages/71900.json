So many\nof us I think have created characters on the fly and have inserted\nthem in the game or perhaps have been given the character by someone\nelse, and the history is sparse.\n\nHowever I would think that after all this time it is safe to assume\nthat no matter how we got the character, these characters are\ncompletely ours now. So now we can create, reboot or whatever our\ncharacter&#39;s history so that they chime in with our portrayals of them.\n\nSo!\n\nDid your character come from G1/G2 time frame and some how appear\nhere, did they live through the great war and transport to old Earth\nfrom the future Beast Wars time frame or were they constructed\nsomewhere else?\n\nIf they did have a vehicular alt mode, why have they maintained it on\nAncient Earth where there are no roads?\n\n\nAll questions to ask ourselves about our characters. These are all\nways we can expand our knowledge of the characters we play - whether\nwe created them or given to us, and I look forward to the answers.\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
