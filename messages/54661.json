His wings spread and fiore exploded from his veins. &quot;He is \ncold, I can feel his dark energy, ah yesss Prime I&#39;ll meet you.&quot; he opened his \ncomm, &quot;I&#39;ll be there Prime, I&#39;ll be there.&quot; He looked around. &quot;You all stay \nhere, I shall be back.&quot; He opened the hatch. He knew hed be in danger of the \nrust plague but he didnt care this was much for imporant. He transformed into \nhis two headed dragon beast mode and flew to the coordinates.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I&#39;ll put a profile up as soon as I have a name and password...hint...hint hint)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Optimus Prime:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;              In his protoform body, Optimus Prime glided his stolen ship easily \n&gt; through the void of temporal space. He was heading to Earth to visit some \n&gt; friends. Not knowing what he would find when he got there, he decided he would \n&gt; need a suitable vehicle mode. He found one in the ships databanks. A \n&gt; Cybertronian tanker, complete with the ability to lift off.\n&gt; \n&gt;             As he cleared Temp Space he started the scan of the truck, every \n&gt; little detail. Then downloaded the information into himself. He got up from his \n&gt; chair, built for the old Autobots and Decpticons, and went to prepare. As he \n&gt; incorporated the designs into himself he thought of all the people on this \n&gt; planet. He was ready.\n&gt; \n&gt;             He touched his chest, the change to actual bot had hurt his combined \n&gt; Spark. Prime was shocked as he entered the atmosphere.\n&gt; \n&gt;             In the deep Prime voice that had once declared to Megatron that �one \n&gt; shall stand; one shall fall� he boomed, �Magnus would dare betray me like that?� \n&gt; He didn�t even sit down as he entered the atmosphere, the ship shook. He was \n&gt; searching for the bomb that he knew Magnus had planted on the ship. �Oh, crap.�\n&gt; \n&gt;             The ship�s thrusters exploded, but the rest of the ship didn�t. \n&gt; Instead, it careened out of control and slammed into the ground, throwing Prime \n&gt; out of the hatch. He slid across the ground as his ship stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt;             When he stopped and got up he checked himself over. He was in full \n&gt; operation, just his good looks were damaged. He walked back to the ship to look. \n&gt; He was in bad shape, his face had been ripped apart, and the visor over his \n&gt; ocular systems. Now everyone could see the protoform underneath, the red eye \n&gt; that turned and looked. His faceplate was smashed and dented, and his \n&gt; �windshield� chest was broken, so one could see the shoulder joints on the &gt; inside. All in all he looked like some sort of robot sent back from the future, \n&gt; to change the future. His arm was a bit ripped up too, but he could live with \n&gt; that.\n&gt; \n&gt;             Luckily for him, the communications boxes on these pods were nearly \n&gt; indestructible. He would need it to talk to the other bots. First though was \n&gt; Rodimus and Hydra.\n&gt; \n&gt;             �Rodimus Prime,� he started, with disgust, �and the one known as \n&gt; Hydra. I have a message for you. Magnus is dead. He was killed trying to stop \n&gt; me. But he was unsuccessful. I am requesting a meeting with both of you, at \n&gt; these coordinates. [Punches in coordinates] Know that if you decide to betray my \n&gt; trust and come with soldiers, I will kill all of you. I will know��\n&gt; \n&gt;             With that he cut off the transmission and waited, checking over his \n&gt; guns�.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
