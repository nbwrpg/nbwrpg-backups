Bloodystrike growls at Reptilica, \nmanaging to shut him up for the time being.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d be glad to get aquainted with you,&quot; Bloodystrike says, pulling \nDesmonus toward him.

Men, always greedy.\n&gt; But she could use this fact as well, probably eating her fill \nwithout really \n&gt; harming either of them...they&#39;de just need a napp for a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first she just thought that Bloodystrike was just going to show \nher his \n&gt; quarters, probably wanting to brage about them. But then she clued \nin, and \n&gt; narrowed her optics a bit.\n&gt; So, that was what they were both after? Well, she could play this \ngame \n&gt; too...making the suffer and wait just a while longer before she fed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then noticing the Reptilica also wanted to show her his quarters as \nwell, \n&gt; but restraining against both of them the best she could without \nbeing \n&gt; obviouse.\n&gt; Though...it was a bit useless, being dragged down the hall by both \nmales, \n&gt; each in hope to probably get her to themselves and alone so that \nthey can \n&gt; eventually pull off what they had in mind for her.\n&gt; But that sort of thing barely even made her care, being such a \nsimple thing \n&gt; that beings such as these could be pleased with.\n&gt; Simple pleasures for simple minds.\n&gt; Feeding upon her pray was where she got her pleasure from, but that \nwould \n&gt; all come in time.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, their arguing was getting tirsome, and she was actually \nbeginning \n&gt; to get tired of it.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hmm...maybe a tour isn&#39;t best viewed on an empty \nstomach...perhaps a hot \n&gt; drink would be nice...get to know my fellow bots...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She gave each of their hands an extra squeeze.*\n\n\n"}}
