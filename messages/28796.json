He nods at \nDrillBit&#39;s request to discuss the matter, and turns from Angel Prime. \nOnce he was sure that Angel Prime couldn&#39;t see his face, it relaxed \ninto the look of disgust that showed his opinion of the offer. \nKillfest didn&#39;t like Maximals. Attacking Hell Beast&#39;s forces and \nindirectly helping the Maximals was one thing, but allying with them \nwas quite another.\n\nHe walks up to DrillBit, waiting for Darkfate to join them.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked to the others. The idea had one problem. The DrillBit and\n&gt; DarkFate wanted an alliance with the Alliance. DB wasn&#39;t sure what\n&gt; Killfest thought.\n&gt; &quot;A momement for us do discuss, please.&quot;\n&gt; He walked off a little bit, and motioned for Killfest and DarkFate \nto\n&gt; follow.\n\n\n"}}
