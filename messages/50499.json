He thought of his options. He could start firing, but he had \nnot decided which group was the best to go with. Those Rogues were \ngreater in number, but that did not prove anything. Ice Hellion \nWarriors were many, and their prowess in combat did not reflect this. \nThe Tripredacus, on the other hand, seemed less organized, even though \nthey seemed better armed.\n\nHis declaration of being the object of the trial of possession might \nmotivate them, but he harbored no illusions. He was a human, unknown \nto these machines. He had not proven himself, but was confident he \ncould be of some use.\n\nThen, there was this female robot. He did not know who she was or \nwhich team she was in, but it seemed as though she had a clear \nmission, maybe even unknown to her. There had to be a way he could \nbring her with him.\n\nIn all these options, running was not present. It was the cowards way \nout, and Wolf Warriors were not cowards.\n\nOr... yes...\n\nHe fired his two missile racks in the air and forty tiny explosions \npeppered the sky. He intended to make a show.\n\nVlad: I AM KHAN VLADIMIR WARD OF CLAN WOLF. I DO NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE, \nBUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUE AS WARRIORS. I SUGGEST A TEMPORARY \nCEASE-FIRE SO WE MAY DISCUSS BETTER AMONG EQUALS.\n\nHe knew the chances that the enemies see themselves as equals were \nslim, but it was worth trying.\n\n\n"}}
