From \nwhat I&#39;ve seen, this Veratis isn&#39;t a killer. He&#39;s not trying to harm \nanyone. But what I don&#39;t understand is this prophecy of his. He keeps \nthinking about it, but I can&#39;t see that far into his mind to really \nunderstand it. OK, Sure he can be grumpy. But what game are you \nrefering to?&quot; She was trying to keep her mind out of his.  She was \ncontrolling it so that she wasn&#39;t jst reading the minds of the bots \nnear her. She would respect the thoughts of the other bots and not \nget into thier heads. That is unless it was absolutely nessasary.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s OK, You did real good.&quot; Lunarpine smiled since he now knew \nwhere they\n&gt; stood. &quot;He told me a little about the prophecy. It seems like it&#39;s \nalmost a\n&gt; religion to him and his group. The three of them seem almost \nfanatical about\n&gt; it.&quot; He walked past her a little, his back was now to her, &quot;Let&#39;s \nplay thier\n&gt; little game and see just what the next move is.&quot; He didn&#39;t exactly \ntrust the\n&gt; scientist but wanted to repay the debt he owed. If that meant \npulling one of\n&gt; his group out of trouble then that&#39;s what he&#39;d do. He wouldn&#39;t drag \nIce into\n&gt; this battle though, he still thought of her as the recon bot that \nShadow\n&gt; Wing had been.\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis stood up for a moment holding his head. &quot;Is there a \nproblem?&quot;\n&gt; Inquired Foxfingers as he placed a hand on his meantors back. \nVeratis\n&gt; glanced around the room, trying to regain his equilibreum, &quot;I just \ngot dizzy\n&gt; for a moment it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Protoform with the Raptor DNA was nearly complete. Veratis had \nhoped\n&gt; that the spark inside could be taught the ways of Prime. Time would \ntell\n&gt; just who or what would become of the new translife form.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
