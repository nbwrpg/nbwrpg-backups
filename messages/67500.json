He was still whole, still deadly, and the spots where his\n&gt; armor had been worn were even already beginning to grow back. He was\n&gt; still thrusting with his sword, ready to spear Animus on it. His grin\n&gt; could have sent shivers down the circuits of even Ironhide...\n\nAnimus watched as the form of Azureblade broke through one of his\ntoughest attacks, healing his damage along the way. The expression on\nAnimus&#39; face was one of dismay, frustration and perhaps even a little\nfear. Animus stepped back a step as he did a mental swallow, thinking\nthat perhaps this battle might be more than he had bargained for. \n\nBut as Azure approached, his long blade set out before him a calm\nreslove spread over Animus&#39; features. If he was to die, then he would\ndo so as a minion of Unicron, not as a fleeing simpleton! \n\nAnimus set himself, waiting for Azure (or is that Protoform Z?) to\napproach at high speed, at the last moment Animus fired a blinding beam\nof light at Azure blade as Animus leaped into the air, thrusting down\nwith his sword at the same time, in the desperate hope that the\npossibly blinded Azureblade would pass through and be vulnerable to\nthis attack!\n\nPreston\n(Animus)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
