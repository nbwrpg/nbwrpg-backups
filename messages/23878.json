Vlad \nlooked cunning, but inexperienced.\n\n&quot;This is the Alliance,&quot; Havoc answers Vlad&#39;s question, &quot;My name is \nHavoc, what&#39;s yours?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ( Carnage: Sorry for taking so long to reply with Vlad, Yanshosh. I \nhave \n&gt; been busy with Christmas business.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ** Vlad&#39;s optics become accustome to the light which fintered in \nthrough the \n&gt; open hatch-way, blinking a few last times before finally seeing the \nwall of \n&gt; a hallway just beyond the door.\n&gt; This was a ship...some sort of base.\n&gt; But what he could tell, it wasn&#39;t Maximal, and was more close to \nthe \n&gt; Predacon build.\n&gt; Though, there was no way to find out for sure until he met whom \never this \n&gt; ship belonged to, and maybe hire himself an assassin after all.\n&gt; Vlad smiled and chuckled deeply to himself. Von; if he was alive, \nwould know \n&gt; that his little brother came to give him a little visit.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks down at the animal at his side for a moment before he \nbegins to \n&gt; head for the door, jumping back in surprise as he nearly runs into \nsomeone. \n&gt; Shesta growling at his side.\n&gt; It was the man who had dragged him from the sea, recovered the pod, \nand then \n&gt; was taken away.\n&gt; Growling slighly as he saw the mans hand near his weapon, the growl \n&gt; disappearing as he straightened himself up and cleared his throat.\n&gt; Turning out to look like a rather striking young man, what he \nwanted to look \n&gt; like one.\n&gt; But Vlad nodded to Havoc&#39;s commant.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Yes. I don&#39;t like living in fish bowls for too long, get&#39;s \nstuffy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ** Vlad didn&#39;t smile, only had an expression on his face which \nreflected the \n&gt; brain within. Commented as clever by others. Sneaky and cruel by \nhis \n&gt; enemies.\n&gt; But it was time to get down to business.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; What faction is this? &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
