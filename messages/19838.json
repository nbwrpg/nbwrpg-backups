When Drillbit finally left Foxfingers stood up to explore \nthe\n&gt; room. he checked out the tube the clone was created in. There was a \nslimy\n&gt; ooze on the floor. He scooped it up and smelled it. It was DNA \nresidue. Kit\n&gt; Kat was already involved in some sort of cloning experiments. He \nplaced a\n&gt; sample in a specimen tube and added it to his collection.(Not to \nbright for\n&gt; Drillbit to lock a thief in a science lab.)\n\n\n\n"}}
