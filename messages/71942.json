Yet he knew he had to keep that in check if he was to keep his posi=\r\ntion.  He turns to Wheelie with a narrowed brow.  Yet not one word is said.=\r\n  He then raises it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Hmmmm... So that&#39;s how you see me?  If I&#39;m not =\r\nmistaken Wheelie I believe you have just crossed the line of insubordinatio=\r\nn.  I&#39;m giving you a chance to be part of the team but I see nothing in ret=\r\nurn on your part.  Well, care to explain to me the Autobot code of honor an=\r\nd what happens when a soldier behaves out of line, going as far as insultin=\r\ng a Prime Officer?  You seem to be quite intelligent, go on, tell me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Rattrap and Straight Shot look to Wheelie in shock.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Looks like a ce=\r\nrtain little go cart&#39;s in for some serious discipline. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Straight Shot=\r\n swallows hard.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; His voice, it sounds just like Ratchet&#39;s voice when =\r\nhe was ready ta lose it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rattrap watches with amusement.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ooohh=\r\nh so that&#39;s where Tucson&#39;s temper comes from.  Yep Wheelie is in big troubl=\r\ne.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucson eyes Wheelie with arms folded in his chest.  His stare indi=\r\ncative of Ratchet when he was ready to lose his temper.\n&gt; \n\nAt this point, =\r\nWheelie stood up, &quot;Yes, I say you are wrong.  There&#39;s no such thing as a sp=\r\nace bridge that strong.  You would simply see it from afar, with our own op=\r\ntics the sensors abar.  You cannot remotely hide such a hting, in the techn=\r\nology of our time or even that thing.  To do such a thing, to rip apart tim=\r\ne, is stupidly absurd, I call it this time.  So if you are going to say we =\r\nshould waste our time going after what does not exist, I say thee nay.&quot;\n\nWh=\r\neelie went on, &quot;So, stop wasting oru time for such a stupid thing, or I wil=\r\nl go out on my own and bring.  Rodimus is my friend, I won&#39;t leave him alon=\r\ne to face his end.  If you are goin to be a boron, then I shall call you a =\r\nnimrod and boron.&quot;\n\nHissing, &quot;Now, I would say you are wasting our time, on=\r\n pointless things that we needn&#39;t to whine.  So I say, I think you want my =\r\nfriend dead today.&quot;\n\nAt the Laurel and Hardy back and forth of Rattrap and =\r\nStraight SHot, Wheelie just laughed, &quot;And you bring up Ratchet?  Well he&#39;s =\r\ndead.  MEgatron blew off his head.  And you seem to want Rodimus to end the=\r\n same way.  So I shall now not leave my friend astray.&quot;\n\nAnd without a furt=\r\nher word, Wheelie transformed to his vehicle mode, and raced off!\n\nOOC - Th=\r\nis is how I see the character - at this point, he thinks it&#39;s utter nonsens=\r\ne to waste time looking for a Space Bridge that there&#39;s no evidence of or a=\r\nnything remotely suggesting, based upon Tuscon having a &#39;hunch&#39; so he&#39;s goi=\r\nng insubordinate and off on his own.  TO him, a Space Bridge would e imposs=\r\nible to hdie (a la the third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon), and so w=\r\nasting time scanning for it is a fool&#39;s errand.  So he&#39;s going off to &#39;look=\r\n&#39; for Rodimus on his own, unless stopped or otherwis einterfered with as he=\r\n&#39;s afraid that Tuscon is purposefully stalling to prevent them from going a=\r\nfter Rodimus.  He respects Leo Prime, but he&#39;s friends with Rorimus, and he=\r\n has a very low regard for Tuscon, and at this point in his processor Tusco=\r\nn deciding to check for something to him that has infinitesimal chances of =\r\nhaving been done and stall a gridwide search is abaondment of his friend.  =\r\nAnyways, wondrful posting and good luck!\n\n\n"}}
