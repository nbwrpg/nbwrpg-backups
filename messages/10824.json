Don&#39;t worry about the small stuff.  \nFor things can always be worse. Look at me, I lost an arm. But I&#39;m \nstill here and I got my arm back.  So don&#39;t worry about the small \nstuff.&quot; She looked at the blade that she had given back to Land Mine \nand thought about cutting her own arm. She shook her head. \n&quot;look, I&#39;m going to go hunting here in a little while. Your welcome \nto join me if you want.&quot; She got up and walked to  the door of the \nlab.\n&quot;Smile, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
