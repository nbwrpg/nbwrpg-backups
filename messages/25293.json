Prodigy, you said the Alliance destroyed the\n&gt; Ark. That&#39;s completely untrue. The Trainers destroyed the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt;\n&gt; Kluster frowns, looking over at Tarantoupulous. His one hand\n&gt; unconscioustly slid down to cradle the stump of his left hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;On the contrary, you are thinking only of yourself, my friend. I\n&gt; agree with Iron Raptor, and I am an experienced Maximal commander.\n&gt; Fighting to the death will get you nowhere, and if we fight right now\n&gt; it will be to certain death. Tell me, what would we gain by dying\n&gt; now? We would give the Alliance power. They can take save some of our\n&gt; bodies and use them as fresh troops, they could take the CF and have\n&gt; THREE bases instead of two. They would be all the more powerful. But\n&gt; if we play peaceful now, we can rebuild our base, we can repair\n&gt; ourselves, and then we will be there to fight them next time.\n&gt; Fighting to the end is what young and unexperienced bots think is\n&gt; honorable. Its not, its simply foolish. If you want to make an impact\n&gt; on the world, you should try to live to do it, and throwing your life\n&gt; away isn&#39;t worth it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks into the bot&#39;s eyes, trying to make him understand. &quot;I hope\n&gt; you understand what I&#39;m saying, because it is very good advice. Iron\n&gt; Raptor can&#39;t possibly not try to save our lives. We are her\n&gt; responsibility in a way, and our safety is her prime priority.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;SOULSTICE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Tarantoupulous responding to Iron Raptor: You are thinking only of\n&gt; yourself.\n&gt; &gt; I may be new here, but I know very well that you never surrender,\n&gt; even if\n&gt; &gt; you must die...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
