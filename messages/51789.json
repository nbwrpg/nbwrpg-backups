Why take a shot at\n&gt; Airly when you know that English is not her first\n&gt; language? It&#39;s all been said before. Don&#39;t you think\n&gt; Airly is sick of hearing it?\n&gt; \n&gt; On another note, just quit talking about your damn\n&gt; IQ. Not one damn person cares about your IQ.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop trying to prove that you are not gay. I don&#39;t\n&gt; think anyone originally used it in that context and\n&gt; the more you try to prove your not the more it seems\n&gt; like you are.
