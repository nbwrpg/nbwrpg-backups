A nuke\n&gt; you could only use once and overall would be less\n&gt; damaging. Granted I would momentarily hold the power\n&gt; of life and death over any one base (or maybe I should\n&gt; go through with my theory I&#39;ve had for a while we got\n&gt; the word &quot;Atlantice&quot; from &quot;Alliance&quot; not to hard to\n&gt; change over millions of years), but still the bots\n&gt; could easily evacuate before it hit, all that was lost\n&gt; could be rebuilt.\n\n\n"}}
