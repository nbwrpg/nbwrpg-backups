He wanted to go badly. He needed to get out \nagain. Sitting outside the cave wasn&#39;t enough. His eyes turned into a \nappearance of wanting. But he knew he was still stuck here.\n\n&quot;Ya could go,&quot; he managed to say. &quot;Ah still gotta talk t&#39; Stingtra.&quot; That \nbot was worrying him. He had never seen a bot that acted like that before. A \nbot that hurt herself and nearly aways came back damaged.\n\nHe looked up and saw Sinester and Sinesis with two other bots. They weren&#39;t \none of his comarades.\n\n&quot;Someone wit&#39; ya?&quot; he shouted over to them.\n\n\n&gt;From: logomorph@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Thu, 06 Jul 2000 19:24:10 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;::KitKat::\n&gt;\n&gt;She could tell he was bored with it all.  Here he was, a well\n&gt;seasoned warrior who was stuck at home base with nothing to do.  She\n&gt;felt sorry for him.  He wanted to see some action.  And quite\n&gt;frankly, so did she.  She was bored as well.  She wanted to fight.\n&gt;Her spark lived for fighting.  She loved bringing down an enemy and\n&gt;chewing on his remains.  But she was stuck at home base to with\n&gt;nothing to do.  She moved over and sat next to Quickstrike.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Ok Boss-bot. Now what? Megatron and that mouse aren&#39;t back yet.  Do\n&gt;you want to go on patrol of do some recon? If we are lucky, we will\n&gt;find some bot lurking around to scrap.&quot; She had a slight smile on her\n&gt;face.  She was trying to comeup with anything to cure the boredom.\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
