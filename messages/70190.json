But he knew if he \n&gt; did that, everyone he cared about, including Rodimus, would probably \n&gt; suffer great damages.  He wasn&#39;t about to do that.  Night Shift could see \n&gt; just by the way Tucson Prime was standing, as still as he was, and as \n&gt; solidly stanced, that he was up to something and nothing too common \n&gt; either.  He always knew when he was using his sonar emitter, as he closes \n&gt; his eyes, simulating his visually impaired sensation as all sonar \n&gt; equipment comes online at full tilt.  Extra sharp hearing, thermal sensory \n&gt; and touch sensory boards were kicking in once more.  With his eyes closed, \n&gt; he knew his greatest of silent weapons could be deployed.  He \n&gt; concentrates, and sends a frequency and attempts to send a painful \n&gt; frequency that would only effect Decepticon and Predacon programming, to \n&gt; the point where he thought he could cause some minor but bothersome \n&gt; malfunctions, giving them all time to escape safely, yet not really \n&gt; causing any major damage.  Night Shift feels a slight vibration coursing \n&gt; through his entire chassey.  And it was visible by the way he seemed to \n&gt; move slightly without even having his engine on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson then addresses everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Kup, you&#39;re forgiven.  Just don&#39;t let it happen again.  And Rodimus, Just \n&gt; because trust is hard to earn, it doesnt mean I don&#39;t have faith in your \n&gt; abilities.  Never lose touch of faith, for it will strengthen you against \n&gt; weakness.  Now, for those of you not used to this, this may effect you in \n&gt; some shape or form.  I appologize if it does.  I am not aiming this attack \n&gt; on any of you.  Autobots, Maximals, brace yourselves.  I am going into \n&gt; full sonic sonar attack mode.  Starting in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, \n&gt; five, four, three, two... One... Deploying now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift braces himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ohhh yeah, I bet these uglies didn&#39;t know ya had this under your \n&gt; manifold.  Heh, this kinda tickles my axles. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; While Tucson Prime works from the inside, Rat Trap and Quickstride now try \n&gt; to work from the outside.  Rat Trap transforms into his rodent form as \n&gt; Quickstride gets back into equine form. They trot up to the fortress, and \n&gt; then start to feel something vibrating through their bodies.  And then \n&gt; realize that it was far best to stay back.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Woahh, feel that Quickstride?  That&#39;s somethn&#39; only Wheels can do. Well, \n&gt; at least all it does is tickle my relays..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He starts to giggle as does Quickstride.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Aw geeze, that does tickle!  I can&#39;t stop laughing!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride falls on his back, stricken by laughter due to the ticklish \n&gt; feeling he gets from Tucson&#39;s sonar emittier. Yet he was not the only one \n&gt; being tickled by it.  Inside, Night Shift could barely keep himself from \n&gt; lauging.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Aww maaan, big bot, whatever you&#39;re usn&#39; it&#39;s don&#39; a number on my \n&gt; relays, I can&#39;t stop laughn&#39;!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson replies.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t warn you.  Good thing it&#39;s not hurting \n&gt; you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A transmission comes from Rat Trap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wheels, whatever you&#39;re do&#39;n in there, ya gotta tone it down or else \n&gt; we&#39;re gonna die laughn&#39;!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hydras/Kup/Darkhawk:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Darkhawk arrived to the area and he opened fire against Rodimus and the\n&gt;&gt; other maximal.
