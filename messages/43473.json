Yan said they \ndidnt exist \n&gt; because you never had an introduction post. he also said rhesus \ndoesnt exist \n&gt; because your history for him cotradicted the RPGs story. Saying a \nchar is a \n&gt; weapons dealer everyone knows when they dont doesnt make sense. not \nto \n&gt; mention the council said to hold off on your posts until you spoke \nto them. \n&gt; And people have complained about you having people appearing in \ncities \n&gt; withpout having them get there. YOu cant teleport your charachters \naround. \n&gt; So... just shut the hell up.\n\n\n"}}
