He knew his downtime would have to be limited because Hydras\n&gt;&gt; was still on the loose, and the insectoids had to be dealt with.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; If I may say something, Stanton, Legacy. Perceptor has proven his\n&gt;&gt; loyalty to us. He has done many favors which would have cost him his life\n&gt;&gt; if he were to be brought to Hydras now. To me that takes a lot of\n&gt;&gt; courage, and courage is something a Maximal and an Autobot are known for.\n&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s try to put things behind us, because we have a road ahead of us \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; is not shy of being perhaps one of our most difficult journeys.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Santon just shrugged, &quot;I am a doctor more than a combatant.&quot; the\n&gt; Maximal medic said, and despite his large size and the vicious tusks,\n&gt; somewhat similar to Torca, he was just that a highly decorated doctor\n&gt; and medic. &quot;It does take courage to stand up for what you believe in,\n&gt; it takes even more to stand up to do what is right.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked over at Perceptor, &quot;We shall see what you do Perceptor.&quot; he\n&gt; said, not totally trusting him, and yet open to perhaps that the\n&gt; predacon might be trying to change.\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy on the other hand just looked at Tuscon his face devoid of\n&gt; expression, &quot;Scientifically speaking an individual&#39;s history is often\n&gt; the best predictor of future behavior.&quot; He looked over at Perceptor,\n&gt; &quot;I look forward to observing this new behavior and seeing how it\n&gt; aligns with this stated new vector in life.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Still we have to reprogram Nightlight&quot;sighed Kup&quot;We cant allow her to\n&gt;&gt; remain in stacis much longer&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Just a warning&quot;said dryly Perceptor&quot;After her reprogramation she will \n&gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; a downtime... it seems that is part of her system, when she was \n&gt;&gt; reprogramed\n&gt;&gt; as Blackstorm and in this time her program was containes she showed a\n&gt;&gt; downtime with no phisical explantion... I guess tha tis part of her&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bump, the smaller of the three medics nodded, &quot;All of these patients\n&gt; will require rest anyway.&quot; he said as he prepared his medica\n&gt; equipment. &quot;We can prepare to bring her out oif stassis and transport\n&gt; her here.&quot; He glanced over at Perceptor, knowing he probrably has the\n&gt; greater knowldge of her status, &quot;Perhaps keep her sedated?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
