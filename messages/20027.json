Forgot about this. Add this on to my last post with Zardus.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks to his left at the exchange of fire between Inzola and\n&gt; Demmos, activating his comm-link to the four bots involved.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stop firing,&quot; he says to them, &quot;You&#39;re allied now. I&#39;ll be glad to\n&gt; listen to any objections you have later, but after the battle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Inzola looked away from Koj and she had heard it all, Deemos&#39;s\n&gt; group, the Alliance let them in? How was it possible? The Alliance\n&gt; had betrayed her!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos looked from behind Gigas and smiled evilly at Inzola. Inzola\n&gt; instinctively fires at Deemos. The shot hits Gigas, but even though\n&gt; it was fired by Inzola, Gigas doesn&#39;t pay attention. Stranato was\n&gt; just staring, dumbfounded the whole time. Deemos comes out from\n&gt; behind Gigas and angrily glares at Inzola, who promptly shoots him in\n&gt; the head. Stranato stares dumbfounded at Inzola. Deemos, on the\n&gt; ground, was looking on in shock at Inzola...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
