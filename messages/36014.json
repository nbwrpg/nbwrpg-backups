He sat down and watched as  Cyngra\nstarted. He nodded his head and thouhgt of the\ndisobidient destructacons. He liked them. They&#39;d be\nuseful. He stood up after Cyngar finished  and pulled\nout his fire sword. He raised it high looking at his\nfellow destrons. &quot;Destrons...today we start what will\nbe a glorius and never ending reign of evil and\ndestruction. This is the moment....this is our time\nnow. We will show these other bots what we can do. We\nwill conquer this planet and win the Beast Wars. Now\nas you all now I am in command in the battle field I\nwill be connected to you all in your comms sending\norders if necessary. We are joined by our allies the\npredacons. They also will help us in our fight. And I\nam privaleged to have them with us. Now lets go slag\nsomething.&quot; He turned his back and activated his\nsignal disquiser.
