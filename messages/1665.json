That means, we will tell him/her she&#39;/he&#39;s gone via e-mail or\nIM,\n&gt; and kill him off in the RPG.  Really no exact way how to kill the\ncharacter\n&gt; off, maybe an avalanche, tripping on a rock down Mount Everest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, yes, I&#39;ve noticed a character named &quot;Tocra&quot;, which is supposed to be\n&gt; Torca.  You can&#39;t really blame someone for bad spelling.  Some people,\njust\n&gt; plain suck at it and can&#39;t type the simplest words, ::Hack, cough::.  But,\nI\n&gt; personally would have to say you just making a character, and making Torca\n&gt; good friends with Liono, a mode, unless you discussed it with him.  That&#39;s\n&gt; like if I made a character who was best friends with Zardus, or said he\nwas\n&gt; Zardus&#39; partner in crime back on Cybertron and try and get him to have\npower\n&gt; in the Alliance.  To do something like that, you need the permission of\nthe\n&gt; charcacter&#39;s owner, unless you make two friends between your own\ncharacters.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: Decepticons own.  I&#39;m a Decepticon in every RPG I play, except for\nthis\n&gt; one, because of new rules it no longers allows members of the glorious\n&gt; Decepticon Empire.  But Decepticons would&#39;ve won, except for Galvatron!\nHow\n&gt; Galvatron?  Wouldn&#39;t it be more accurately Unicron?  I think not.  Unicron\n&gt; was probably going to spare Cybertron, but that idiot who didn&#39;t know jack\n&gt; about the Matrix tried to use it on Unicron...then he went crazy later in\n&gt; 5FoD, and made the Empire collapse.  Blow up Cybertron and Earth, what a\n&gt; putz.  As for Rebirth, that is one of the crappiest episodes I&#39;ve ever\nseen.\n&gt; Like the Autobots needed the help of the Nebulans to destroy a bunch of\n&gt; near-defenseless robots.  They&#39;d just shoot them from a ways away, that&#39;s\n&gt; what their rifles are for!\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Special Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup\n&gt; Get automatic protection and access to your important computer files.\n&gt; Install today:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/2344/10/_/_/_/958573978/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
