Too many orders. Finally Darkmouse guided \n&gt; Hell Beast out, but he was still confused. He looked at everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You. Nighteyes, someone called you. Why are you here. You came \nwith \n&gt; Megatron&#39;s men. And KitKat, what were you thinking!?! Have you \n&gt; forgotten what Megatron did? Are you willing to forgive just to get \n&gt; his military status? He&#39;s only going to use the council to his \n&gt; advantage and finally complete his plan to rule all Predacons! You \n&gt; know tht&#92;at! And now that Arachnia, Destructor and I are on the \n&gt; council, you can not just make a decision like that on your own! I \n&gt; know I said that I would leave many of the decisions to you and \n&gt; Arachnia, but bringing the traitor into the fold? We all need to \n&gt; agree on that, and I certainly do not.

The cable had been severed. The portal to \n&gt; Battera&#39;s mind closed. But he could tell that her dream was still \n&gt; going on, but in her own head. But if she&#39;s not in his, that \nmeans....\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly a bright light apperaed, and their was Battera, or atleast \n&gt; in his dream, and she shot at the Alliance. As soon as they were \nhit, \n&gt; they evaportated. The Alliance programming had been defeated. His \n&gt; cross disspapeared. And than their was darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois opened his eyes.\n\n\n"}}
