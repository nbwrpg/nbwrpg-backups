He \nwouldn&#39;t let Megatron kill his mate, but he wouldn&#39;t interfere \neither. Hearing a yell behind him, he turns around, two cyclone shots \nnearly hitting him. He flies into the air and fires two missiles from \nhis wings at Menasor, noticing that Megatron had ordered a retreat.\n\n-That coward,- he thinks to Iron Raptor, -Oh well, you would have \nbeaten him, love.-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron chuckled again. &quot;Optimus Prime was new my dear Raptor. \nWhere is\n&gt; he now?&quot; Megatron asked, spitting the challenge. He then looked \naround\n&gt; him, noticing he was not in the most suitable position however. He \nhad\n&gt; accomplished their main objective however. He stopped swinging the \nmace,\n&gt; and his shoulder cannon emitting a blast of stored energy straight \nat\n&gt; the ground, pushing up the dirt, and creating a lot of smoke, \nencircling\n&gt; Megatron. He then glew out of it, and towards \nAstroblast. &quot;Astroblast,\n&gt; transform&quot; he ordered.\n\n\n"}}
