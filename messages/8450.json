She could hear the \nsounds of a fight.  She heard the explosions and lazar fire.  She \npulled a quill from her side.  It stung a little, but it was more \ndiscomfort than pain.  She pulled it out to make it into a staff and \nwalked causiously towards the Ark. \n\nShe was only a mile away and could see the fight ensueing.  She crept \nalong the side of the road, keeping to the tall grasses and trying to \nstay hidden.  She held her staff out infront of her to block anything \nthat came her way.\n\n\n"}}
