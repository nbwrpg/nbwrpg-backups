Now, the situation on the planet is soon \n&gt; going to possibly heat up incredibly, and I want the Maximals to be \n&gt; ready to fight alongside us if needed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; A small smile crept onto his lips. Manipulating factions to do things \n&gt; was an artform. &quot;Do you think you can go to the Maximals and try to \n&gt; establish good relations with them? It will be possibly dangerous, and \n&gt; you&#39;ll have the Iron Fist&#39;s fastest craft with you in case you need to \n&gt; escape.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Gotron hurries to Zardus&#39; position, bowing before him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gotron: Yes, Lord Zardus, what do you want me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
