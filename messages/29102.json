Here&#39;s a slight summarry of events right now:\n\nA new group has recently risen up, beginning with the Stunticons \nlanding and then the other various G1 chars in Pred/Maxi size. They \ncreated a new faction and attacked the Cybertronian Fire (Maximal \nbase), at the same time that the Brotherhood (another faction) \nattacked it. The Alliance (yet another faction), came to aid for a \nfew moments and then flew off to attack the Brotherhood base. The \nDestrons (faction. Allies of the Alliance), came to the aid of the \nAlliance on their siege, and also attacked the Brotherhood base. \nDuring this whole period, nine bots were plotting something in the \nAlliance base, and Zardus (Alliance commander) gassed them on \nsuspicion of treason, adding to the general chaos.\n\nThe battles raged for a while before the Decepticons left the CF, the \nBrotherhood leaving soon after. After some confusion things got \nsettled down and the Maximals are currently recuperating from the \nattack. The gassed bots all died in the Alliance base, ending that \nconflict.\n\nMagmatron (Destron commander) decided to leave earth, taking alot of \nthe Destrons along with him. The remainder of the Destrons are \ncurrently trying to rebuild their faction.\n\nI think that&#39;s about it concerning the major faction. A group of \nDecepticons and Predacons are attacking Angel Prime, a Maximal, \nbecause he was near the Decepticon base. Plus Condor, also a Maximal, \nis trying to escape from being help prisoner at the Decepticon base.\n\nAllrighty, you should be all set. Sorry if this is confusing, I&#39;m in \nclass right now and am running out of time.\n\n\nAnd Robo, Omicron has already been discussed, and I think we came up \nwith a solution.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Kevin Ramsey &lt;kramsey20@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi. As someone who just today watched TF: The Movie\n&gt; for like, the 50th time, it&#39;s clear I love\n&gt; Transformers.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT, I just joined this RP yesterday. Anybody mind\n&gt; filling me in on what&#39;s going on? (I&#39;m loyal to\n&gt; Generation 1 and Beast Wars. Beast Machines was OKAY,\n&gt; but I just did not get anything that came post-movie.\n&gt; The magic, as they say...was gone after the TF: Movie\n&gt; mega-massacre. I can&#39;t get ahold of any of the\n&gt; Japanese episodes, Although I WILL watch the NEW\n&gt; TRANSFORMERS SHOW oh so faithfully.\n&gt; (Autobots...Decepticons...*sigh* Home at last). My\n&gt; favorite characters are in no particular order, both\n&gt; the original and Beast Wars Megatrons (but I favor the\n&gt; Decepticon to the Predacon), Dinobot, Optimus Prime,\n&gt; Cheetor, Waspinator (My favorite Predacon. Hey, who\n&gt; doesn&#39;t just laugh their asses off at\n&gt; &quot;WASSSSPINATORRRR TERRORIZZZZZZZZZZZE!&quot;), Grimlock and\n&gt; probably my favorite overall...Unicron (who I will say\n&gt; has probably THE BEST theme music in all of TF lore).\n&gt; I just wish Hasbro would stop pushing them to sell\n&gt; TOYS before telling stories. Then it would get REALLY\n&gt; good. \n&gt; \n&gt; Somebody mind telling me exactly WHAT is going on\n&gt; storylinewise? I have a couple of characters in mind.\n&gt; Even though I&#39;ll probably only use one or two in this\n&gt; RP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hummer: An Autobot, transforms into a Humvee. Real\n&gt; wiseass. Has a sarcastic remark for every occasion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Killshot: Decepticon (or he could be a Destron,\n&gt; whatever you guys have) who transforms into a very\n&gt; large machine gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Omicron: (so far my favorite) A planet-sized destroyer\n&gt; of worlds created by the same entity that created\n&gt; Unicron. Omicron is also twice the size of Unicron.\n&gt; He&#39;s been dormant for 6 million years until something\n&gt; awakens him. He could be a common villian for a later\n&gt; storyline.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can somebody bring me up to speed on what&#39;s\n&gt; happening? Thanx.\n&gt; \n&gt; AIM is KevServo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
