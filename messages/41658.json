He fealt it necessary to make sure that he reached the Black\n&gt; &gt; Fortress before they did.He was to the SouthEast of  Greece when \nhe\n&gt; &gt; detected two signals moving in his direction useing his personal\n&gt; &gt; frequency. He stopped, curious about how and why bots on this \nplanet\n&gt; &gt; would be useing such basic frequencies. &quot;Go on ahead, I&#39;ll catch \nup\n&gt; &gt; to you.&quot; He radio&#39;d back to Attilah and Kali.  He reset his course\n&gt; &gt; south on an intercept course. The Predacon Trainer wanted to see \nfor\n&gt; &gt; himself just what he was dealing with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
