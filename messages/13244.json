She saw the damage that teh shi[ had \ntaken.  She stopped in one hallway and leaned up against a wall and \nclosed her eyes.  She sniffed the air and sighed.  She knew her \ninsticts told her to come here and help, she just wondered if she had \ncome to late.  She had a smile slowly appear on her face.  She \nthought that as long as there was one bot to fight with, she wasn&#39;t \nlate at all.  She smiled and walked along the hallway.  She went to \nthe entrance and sat on the ramp and looked up at the sky.  She saw \nthe same sky she had seen up in the mountains. She whispered,&quot;Yup, \nsame sky, same sun, same air.  Just, different ground.&quot;  She \nsighed,&quot;I miss the snow though.&quot;  She sat on the ramp, with her knees \nup to her chin, and looked around the grounds around the ship.\n\n\n"}}
