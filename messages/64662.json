I guess. I got shot a couple of times, but nothing \n&gt; permanent...&quot;\n&gt;  &quot;I think you should let Kenzo look at your injuries. You look \nterible.&quot;\n&gt;  As they sat there the heard the volley of weapons fire hitting \nthe shields \n&gt; outside. Unfortunately, the shields prevented the turrets from \nfiring at the \n&gt; enemies. So they would have to sit and wait for them to shut down, \nor \n&gt; intentionally lower the shields so they could engage the enemy. \n&gt;  Salveo rarely was put in this position. In the past, Lord Perseus \nhad been \n&gt; with them when they had had to deal with insurgents. This time he \nwould have \n&gt; to think of a plan on his own. He certainly hoped those Maximals \noutside \n&gt; were on his side.\n&gt; \n&gt;  On 9/6/05, Airly &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate/Nightsrike:\n&gt; &gt;  Nightstrike fired against the base as same as Darkfate\n&gt; &gt;  Elita:\n&gt; &gt;  Elita walked towards Guardia&#39;s room and came in she lie down in \nthe bed \n&gt; &gt; and started to sob, all was her fault\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Just go into my room then, it should have my name on the door. \nI&#39;ll come \n&gt; &gt; back for you when the fighting is over.&quot; said Guardia.\n&gt; &gt;  She waved goodbye and headed for the front of the base.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  On 9/6/05, Airly &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Elita:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;But...
