She noticed that she hadn&#39;t seen Scorponok in the \nmain cave lately.  She wondered if he was in his lab working on \nsomething important.  &quot;Pardon me commander, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;\nShe walked over to Scorponok&#39;s lab.  She didn&#39;t see him there.  She \nwalked inside and looked around.  She saw tools and other things \nlaying about. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to have him pick up his toys more \noften.&quot; she chuckled to herself.  She saw a black box sitting on the \nwork bench.  She wondered what it was.  She picked it up and looked \nat it.  It didn&#39;t open and she couldn&#39;t find the open button.  She \nset it down and walked back out to the entrance of the cave.\n&quot;Uh, Commander Quickstrike, if you happen to see Scorponok, let him \nknow that i am loking for him.&quot;\n\nShe turned and went back to her computer console.\n\n\n"}}
