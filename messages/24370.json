�Besides, Yan told me you had some plans for the \nMaxis. �\n&gt; Attacking the Alliance is something I want to see the Maxis pathetically \nfail \n&gt; at :P\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyberwolf, I was waiting for you to reply with your guy, and I doubt you&#39;ll \n&gt; take Serpentor down. �Anyway, just because he murdered Luna&#39;s girlfriend is \n&gt; no reason to hold a grudge...look at Logomorph! �She&#39;s not out to rip my \n&gt; spark out!\n&gt; \n&gt; And last, but not least, Alloran, that would be awesome if the insane \n&gt; Galvatron was on the Maximal side. �Evil could finally triumph over the \ndark \n&gt; forces of the light. �Too bad Hot Rod still isn&#39;t evil. �Could have good \n&gt; Galvatron fight evil Hot Rod.\n&gt; \n&gt; Long live the Maximals?

�I&#39;ll give you something to play \n&gt; with, witch!&quot; he yelled, firing off twenty-five rapid laser bolts off at \nIron \n&gt; Raptor&#39;s chest.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Scattershot laughed at Nemesis getting hit. �He sighed, hovering in \nmid-air. �\n&gt; He better help him before Nemesis got angry at him. �He raised his rifle, \nhis \n&gt; arms akimbo, firing off 15 rounds at Tavatron&#39;s legs.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Serpentor ran back as fast as he could, barely avoiding the enraged \nLunaprine.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the outside, he made himself look like he was panicked and fearful. \n�But, \n&gt; on the inside, he was crazy. �Besides being crazy, he was being calm, and \nhad \n&gt; already seen the folly of Lunaprine&#39;s attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; He raised his right arm, firing off a blast straight at Lunaprine&#39;s chest \n&gt; (not sure if it would be considered point blank...), and slashed forward at \n&gt; Lunaprine&#39;s right side with his energy blade in his left hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Firestarter&#39;s craft reached Mach 5 as he quickly sped through the \natmosphere.\n&gt; He activated the comm. unit in the ship. �&quot;Shockwave, it is Firestarter, I \n&gt; have arrived. �You have no base, I can tell from my scans. �You are heading \n&gt; to an ice continent. �Report as soon as you can. �Unitron is currently in \n&gt; battle with Maximals. �I will aid him and his faction.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He ended the transmission, walking over to the only access hatch in his \nship \n&gt; and opened it via an access code into a access panel near it. �\n&gt; \n&gt; He leapt out of the ship, activating the boosters in his feet, heading for \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire as he watched his Talon class fighter head for Uluru \nin \n&gt; the large island continent of Australia. �He watched the craft smash \nthrough \n&gt; the top of the large Uluru, and went deep into its center, rock collapsing \non \n&gt; top of it. �It was barely noticable there was a hole in Uluru.\n&gt; \n&gt; He launched off towards the Cybertronian Fire, knowing he would repair the \n&gt; damage to Uluru later, but was only interested in battle now.\n&gt; \n__________________________________________________________________\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape Webmail account today at \nhttp://webmail.netscape.com/\n\n"}}
