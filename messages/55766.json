He wondered \n&gt; what Tyrael was up to. He hadn&#39;t heard back from his new leader. And \n&gt; Kaiser, his supposed new general hadn&#39;t called upon him either. He \n&gt; was getting frustrated. He wanted action and a chance to seek rank. \n&gt; Not rust to pieces in his room. He got up and wandered the halls. He \n&gt; found the main communications room and sat down. He picked up the \n&gt; scanner headset and put it on. Next, he started to adjust some of the \n&gt; dials to start picking up most predacon frequencies and some of the \n&gt; maximal frequencies. He listened to the scanner and hoped he would \n&gt; find out what was going on.\n\n\n"}}
