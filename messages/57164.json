I am very content\nof the form I have now.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, EmprzAnastazia@a... wrote:\n&gt;  Scourge began to walk forward, hoping she knew what she was talking\nabout, \n&gt; one part of him told him to trust her, the other to be wary of her\nnature, and \n&gt; the last... he growled as he slowly entered the pool... \n&gt; \n&gt; Her crimson optics watched him obey her, the power was very\nappeasing as her \n&gt; optics flashed. \n&gt; Watching him enter the pool.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Suddenly the matrix within her began to glow as did scourges spark... \n&gt; Scourge began to glow soflty as he sank within it. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Her body arched slightly skyward, as her optics closed halfway, in\na strange \n&gt; type of trance it seemed. The sensation rushing through her. A\nwicked grin \n&gt; appeared upon her face....  \n&gt; \n&gt;   Scourge cried out as his body began to glow he curled up and tried to \n&gt; transform, but instead the armor plates began to fuse and soon a\nblack egg like \n&gt; structure lay at the bottom of the pool, the matrix opened and the\negg cracked \n&gt; and a small glowing ball shot out and flew right at Maxima... \n&gt; \n&gt;   Her form still arched, the matrix glowing as if to accept the ball of \n&gt; light.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  The ball entered the matrix and the egg floated to the surface and\nmore \n&gt; cracks spread across the black object... the matrix cooled and\nsealed as it did it \n&gt; let loose a blast of power to maxima... \n&gt; \n&gt;  Her body jolted & arched as she cried out... &quot;uhhoh-AHHHHHH!!!!&quot;\n(Think of \n&gt; Heavy Metal War episode when Megatron gets all of the powers of the \n&gt; Decepticons). \n&gt; \n&gt; The egg began to hatch and a single a pair of eyes peared out at her... \n&gt; \n&gt; The power surged through her of the Matrix, as her crimson optics\nopened & \n&gt; glowed brightly. Then her form stood tall as her glowing crimson\noptics looked \n&gt; at the dark egg.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  The egg began to fall away as the figure stood, it was organic...\nbut also \n&gt; machine... it growled and a low dark voice emerged. &quot;Who... am I?&quot;\nThe figure \n&gt; stood and a werewolf like manbeast stood before her he had a thick\nblack mane \n&gt; and in some places he had silver designs running over his body, and\ntwo blood \n&gt; red eyes... \n&gt;  \n&gt; Her glowing crimson orbs gazed at him, as a wicked smirk appeared...\n&quot;You... \n&gt; are Scourge.... reborn.&quot; she purred with a hint of evil in her voice. \n&gt; Her shimmering form stood there, watching the new reformat of Scourge. \n&gt; \n&gt;   He looked down at himself and he growled looking up at her... His\nclawed \n&gt; hands opened and closed... &quot;Maxima....&quot; He looked up at her and then\nclinching \n&gt; his fists looked back at her. &quot;What do you wish of me...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Nothing .. for now,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Rest. For when the time comes,\nwe will \n&gt; make our mark upon our enemies.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Her optics glanced over at Azureblade. &quot;If you are with me, then\nreform in \n&gt; the pool. If you are against me, leave, never return & next we meet,\nI shall not \n&gt; be merciful.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Then her optics turned back to Scourge. He was indeed different.\nThe new \n&gt; form befit him very well. \n&gt; She grinned.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  He turned to her then looked back at Azureblade... he growled as\nhis inner \n&gt; body boiled with hatred... suddenly his body changed and the wolfman\nchanged \n&gt; the organics, and the mechanical parts changed and the form that\nloomed over \n&gt; Maxima and placed a clawed wing on her shoulder was a cross between\na dragon and \n&gt; a venus flytrap... It nuzzled her cheek and looked at azure with a\nface mostly \n&gt; made of teeth... \n&gt; \n&gt;  She felt both easy & uneasy about Scourge. It stirred her though,\nboth the \n&gt; fact that he would listen to her, her spark & Matrix glowed as one\nas she felt \n&gt; the power boil. There was a stirring that Scourge created... was\ndifficult to \n&gt; tell, as it was more than one type of stirring. \n&gt; she only stood there & smirked wickedly, a soft laugh boiled. \n&gt; But as her form restored, with the help of the lagoon & the Matrix, her \n&gt; memories returned.. one especially of a kiss....  \n&gt; \n&gt;  The beast turned and looked down at her. It grunted as if to say.\n&quot;Whats \n&gt; wrong?&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She hoped to gain Azureblade under to command. Not to command &\nrule, but \n&gt; just for the fun of it .... she didn&#39;t wish to best-\n&gt; Her optics widened.. Hydras! It was he whom she was loyal to... it\nwas he who \n&gt; had kissed her.. why though... her memories then gave her that\nwindow. It was \n&gt; of love. She dared to love?! It nearly sickened her. But then ...\nshe knew \n&gt; why. Hydras... was the combined form of both Megatron & Galvatron.\nOf the one \n&gt; she both did truly love & hate. \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Our time will soon be at hand, Scourge,&quot; she stated simply. What she \n&gt; remembered, would only be to herself. \n&gt; \n&gt; She looked up at Scourge, her crimson optics gazing up at him. \n&gt; \n&gt;  the toothy face curled into a grin as he opened his great wings and\nlet a \n&gt; jet of flame burst from his throat. \n&gt; \n&gt; She grinned, his excitement was comforting. \n&gt; She broke away from him for a moment, leapt into the lagoon. \n&gt; As she floated through the waters, it helped her to repair & restore\nher. \n&gt; As she resurfaced, she was repaired & restored. \n&gt; Stepping out of the waters on the opposite side of the waterfall,\nher form \n&gt; shimmering in the sunlight,\n\n\n"}}
