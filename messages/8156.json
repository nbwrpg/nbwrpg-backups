He found a \nvalley. He looked down and saw an human figure. He fired an optic \nblast at the humanfigure. He walked over to it. It was a protohuman. \n&quot;Hmm, there must be more of these around. I will kill all of them.&quot; \nLobstruck went down in to the valley and found a village with about\n30 \nprotohumans. He walked into the village. \n\n  Some of the Proto-human noticed him and started yelling. Some \nstarted throwing rocks at him, as others were runnig in terror and \nother were looking at him currioustly. \n\n  A rock hit Lobstruck, scracting his armor, &quot;Hey, you scratched my \narmor, I have to go to a cr chamber to get it back to normal and I \nhate CR CHAMBERS.&quot; Lobstruck fired a optic at a human that was about \nto throw a rock at him, as he walked over to the one that nailed him \nwith a rock. \n\n  The protohuman saw the bot coming as he started to throw more rocks \nat him. Some of the Protohumans who were watching, started to run in \nterror.\n\n  Lobstruck punched the human multiple time, killing him. He then \npulled out his double barrel pulse shotgun as he fired at the \nretraeting humans. \n\n  The Reatreating protohumans were mowed down to their death. There \nwere only 5 protohumans alive now. Each of the human started to throw \nmore rockets at the bot.\n\n  Lobstuck pulled out  his sword as he went and sliced up 4 of the \nhumans. He watched as they fell over dead. He went up and grabbed the \nlast human and brought the protohumans face to his. He took out a \nsmall pocket knife and cut off the human chest. Lobstruck then\ngrabbed \nthe beating heart and put it into a stroage bag he was carring. He \nthen left the village, laughing as he counted 32 dead protohumans. He \nclimb up the valley and started to look for some bots again. He had\nto \nfind a bot, it didn&#39;t matter if it was maximal or predacon, he wanted \nto know if there was life on this planet.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  Proto all of a sudden grabbed his head as he had a visoin of the \nvillage of Protohumans that were killed. He didn&#39;t know what was\ngoing \non. &quot;I&#39;m going to take a nap.&quot;\n\n\n(Can someone find lobstruck.) \n\n\n"}}
