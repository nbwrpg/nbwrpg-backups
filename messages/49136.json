Controlling proto-humans isnt going to happen. The council\nwill\n&gt; not put extremely important NPCs into the hands of players. In BW the\n&gt; Maximals interacted very little with the humans and thus that should be\n&gt; respected and shown in here. The protohumans would also get crushed in\ncombat\n&gt; with TFs they lack the know how to do so. While controling humans persay\n&gt; isn&#39;t a bad idea, it still isn&#39;t that good of one especially when you are\n&gt; talking about human ancestors. After all you have to look at this from a\n&gt; logical point of view, just how many transformers are going to be\nattracted\n&gt; to primitive earth. We&#39;ve had 5 or 6 factions already crashland onto the\n&gt; planet, that in itself defys some rational thought. Yes back stories are\ngood\n&gt; for them but sometimes its just enough. The RPG really doesn&#39;t need any\n&gt; wholey new factions to get it running again. It just needs a spark, an\n&gt; element of chaos if you will. So far everything that has appeared and\n&gt; happened has been pretty much voted on by the players, that just makes it\n&gt; boring. Once in a while something needs to happen that the players no\nnothing\n&gt; about. Better RPing skills are built that way. As for the quintesson\n&gt; question, they were always around as far as the fandom know. They made the\n&gt; transformers and in the continuity as far as my knowledge goes the gobots\n&gt; were never recognized, although it is possible that they were or could\nhave\n&gt; been since in Five Faces of Darkness it begins with a galactic olympics,\n&gt; however they were also not able to identify one of the attackers that got\n&gt; caught so it also shows that at the time not everything was known. Anyway\n&gt; thats my 2 cents for now. Flame me if you want but this has been my\nunbiased\n&gt; opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
