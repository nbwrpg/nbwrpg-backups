My \nparents were\n&gt; both killed in cold blood, it is a terrible thing. Zeni misses them\n&gt; terribly, you aren&#39;t alone. Gramps misses them, too, my mom was his\n&gt; daughter, and my dad was his daughter&#39;s husband. It isn&#39;t very fun \nin my\n&gt; memories neither, Trinity, but I&#39;m trying to replace the bad \nmemories with\n&gt; the good ones, I continue to do so every day of my life, and so does\n&gt; Gramps...and Zeni. Technosis has faced hardships, too. Maybe more \nawful ones\n&gt; than we&#39;ll ever know, and she&#39;s still trucking along. Come back \nwith me,\n&gt; Trinity, don&#39;t run away. Zeni needs you...\n\n\n\n"}}
