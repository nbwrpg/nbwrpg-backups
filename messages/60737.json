That way I can actvate him and brainwash him while he is \noffline.&quot;\n&gt; The probe was replaced with a multi interface data link.  It moved \ndown into the gel and opened his chest panel.  The t- rex head on \nhis chest lifted and opened, revealing the curcuitry inside.  The \ninterface connected and Hellplague went to the computer again.  She \nbegan accessing his core memory, as well as his software.  \n&gt; &quot;OOOOh, someone has put heavy restrictions on him.  He is actually \nmore powerful than what we saw!&quot;\n&gt; She set the computer to work, trying to unlock the restrictions on \nhis power absorbtion, his EPS grid, and his anti grav core.\n&gt; &quot;It will take a few minutes, but once the computer is done, we can \nbegin the brainwashing proceedure.&quot;\n&gt; he swep commander walked over to the table and stuck one hand into \nthe gel.  She carressed the seemingly soft face of the bounty \nhunter, and grinned more.\n&gt; &quot;I always wanted an obediant pet.  If you want, we may share him, \njust us two?&quot; Hellplague said with her grin plastered on her face.\n&gt; \n&gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blacknightmare:\n&gt; &quot;Have you found something?&quot;aske coriuosity the femme\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hellplague watched the sensor probe a while longer, before \nwalking \n&gt; over to the wall monitor.  the monitor showed nothing at the \nmoment, \n&gt; because the computer was compiling the data on Malice&#39;s arm.  A \nfew \n&gt; moments later, the screen came on again and this time with \n&gt; information.\n&gt; &gt; At first on might mistake the image as a mistake, for the image \n&gt; appeared to be from an organic creature.  Muscle tissues, \n&gt; circulatory systems, it appeared to be a glitch or the wrong \n&gt; information.  But upon closer inspection, Hellplague found curcuit \n&gt; pathways, fiber optic wiring, and armies of nano robots.  The \nimage \n&gt; zoomed out to examine the bounty hunter&#39;s skin, and the secret of \n&gt; his ability to absorb energy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Or so Hellplague thought.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Other than his skin being a mass of synthetic substances \norganized \n&gt; to be organic, nothing amazing, no revelation, just his skin.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Who did this?  Able to disguise their work so well?  Oh well.  \n&gt; Time to examine his power system.  Time to wake him up-&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hellplague stopped as she realized something.  Thn she \ndevilishly \n&gt; grinned and began to chuckle.

And \n&gt; &gt; since you aren&#39;t forth coming with details, I&#39;ll have to fully \n&gt; &gt; examine him before I can try to re activate him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hellplague returns to the console on the table.  The arm over \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; table drops down and extends a probe into the gel and begins \n&gt; making \n&gt; &gt; passes over Malice&#39;s upper arm.  The screen on the wall begins \nto \n&gt; &gt; register, and Hellplague walks over to it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Amazing... such technology... such craftmanship... I have \nnever \n&gt; &gt; seen anything like this before.  He is unlike anything else in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; universe.  That&#39;s why he was so powerful!  His healing, ability \nto \n&gt; &gt; absorb energy, he is one of a kind.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She turns and walks back to the table, placing a finger on her \n&gt; &gt; chin thoughtfully.  She then turns to Blacknightmare.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;As soon as I finish scanning him I will proceed with \n&gt; brainwashing \n&gt; &gt; him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackNightmare::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hiow long will you take to brainwashed him????&quot;snarled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BlackNightmare&quot;Unicron&#39;s pacience has limits&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Friends.
