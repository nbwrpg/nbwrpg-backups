He too\n&gt;&gt; &gt; had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; suffered many injustices from the Predacons, yet he tries to put that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; behind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him as he sees the need to put the past behind him and move ahead. The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; future depended on it. In his draconic form he leaps in front of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rodimus,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; staring him in the eyes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; No, it may look as if I am but in truth I am trying to make a point!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we have both lost a great deal to our enemy but we will lose something.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; GREATER if we don&#39;t learn to. PUT THE PAST BEHIND US! TIL ALL ARE ONE,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the words of Primus. Till all are one. Unicron is far beyond our\n&gt;&gt; &gt; factions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; alone but, if we work as one faction we have a chance to overpower this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; new\n&gt;&gt; &gt; threat. That is what I am trying to convey. Leo Prime, that also applies\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to you, you may not understand my reasoning but in time you will.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RODIMUS PRIME just looked at TUSCON as if he has just lost his mind,\n&gt;&gt; his optics still smoldering with his own inner emotions. &quot;You started\n&gt;&gt; this mission in an effort to wipe out the evil.&quot; He said in clipped\n&gt;&gt; tones. &quot;And yet here we are trying to work with them to destroy a\n&gt;&gt; greater evil.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He turned to look at TUSCON, optic to optic. &quot;And what do you think\n&gt;&gt; they will do should they gain the upper hand, or when this is over?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Folded his arms across his chest he just looked at TUSCON. &quot;Now is not\n&gt;&gt; the time for discussions like this. But if you think I will work with\n&gt;&gt; Cyclonus or any other Predacon without my hand on my weapon and my\n&gt;&gt; guard up, then you don&#39;t know me.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I will finish this mission as is needed.&quot; RODIMUS PRIME said as he\n&gt;&gt; stepped around TUSCON to continue towards the Dinosaurs. &quot;Then me and\n&gt;&gt; you are going to talk.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
