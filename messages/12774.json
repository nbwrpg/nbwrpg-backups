Together they\n&gt; entered the bridge to find Atma and his patner playing with themselfs.\n&gt;     &quot;You two, go and guard our new little addition to the family,\nTarantulas.\n&gt; And the Maximals too.&quot; she ordered, taking her place at the command\nstation.\n&gt; &quot;Paralysis, tell Quickstrike to come here. I have a mission for him. I\nwant\n&gt; him, Venomus, and Solo to go to a disclosed location and retrive...well,\nI&#39;ll\n&gt; have to tell him when he gets here with the others. Atma and Pursuedo will\n&gt; remain here with the rest of us in case of attack, but Aerostreak,\nGrappler,\n&gt; and Guantix will be dispatched if aid is needed.&quot; She said.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
