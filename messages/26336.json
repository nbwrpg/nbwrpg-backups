I was thinking about the plan and since we&#39;ll be \nsneaking in from the back all they have to do is send some of their troops \nout the front and around.  If they do that we end up trapped between two \ngroups of enemies as strong as we are.  I don&#39;t think the plan will work \nwithout significant losses.  Don&#39;t misunderstand me I&#39;m not questioning \nanyone&#39;s willingness to lay down their life for this cause, but the more bots \nyou lose the fewer there are to fight the next battle.&quot;\n\n"}}
