I\n&gt; hope you&#39;re considering joining us.  Both of you.  Although it may\nbe a bit\n&gt; dull for you Angel Prime.  We don&#39;t get many attacks way out here.\nAnd we\n&gt; aren&#39;t equipped to attack anyone.  But we could really use the help.\n We need\n&gt; to get some shields on this base.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt;     Still standing outside the base, &quot;Sirs I&#39;ve been thinking about\nthis\n&gt; problem.  I think I can develop a different type of shielding for\nthe base.\n&gt; It wouldn&#39;t be the best but it might work.  First we&#39;d need typical\nforce\n&gt; type shielding for use against missiles, lasers, etceteras.  Second\na type of\n&gt; back up shielding.  It wouldn&#39;t affect incoming attacks but it would\naffect\n&gt; the incoming attackers.  A typical shield system uses a bubble of\nforce to\n&gt; stop attacks. But deflecting them takes energy and they can be\nbrought down.\n&gt; I propose focusing energon in such a way that it creates a bubble of an\n&gt; energon field around the base.  This would prevent bots from getting\nthrough.\n&gt;  Unfortunately the instability would mean we couldn&#39;t get out while\nthey&#39;re\n&gt; up.  We would have to attack from well within the bubble to prevent\nstasis\n&gt; lock.  Our shots will still be able to pass through the shielding\nbut theirs\n&gt; would not.  And the energon shields would last until the energon\npower source\n&gt; ran out.  It wouldn&#39;t last more than a day or two but that would be\nenough to\n&gt; repair and get back to battle.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;Next for weapon systems we&#39;ll need automated turrets.  Mounted\nin the\n&gt; mountain side and around the base.  I&#39;d also like a mine field but that\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be necessary.  Maybe some more primitive traps, like the\nhole we&#39;re\n&gt; one step to the right of, or the logs.  They&#39;re primitive but\neffective.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;The shielding I can modify and repair from spare parts in the\nbase but I\n&gt; don&#39;t think I can make turrets from anything in there.  I&#39;ll need at\nleast\n&gt; one example and some spare parts to build more with.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt;     &quot;I think it&#39;s time we visit the Maximals again Windlord.  They\nowe us a\n&gt; favor or two.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
