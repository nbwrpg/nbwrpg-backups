Trelos can do combat with bots in beast mode, his jaws have been known to rip off arms and legs (necks too);  his front paws can also slash armor.  He runs faster than many bots fly, and he&#39;s racked up quite a kill list already.  He broke out of the Pasificus Maximal base without any assistance, while all the Maximals were in the base, he&#39;s bested Hydras in combat.
