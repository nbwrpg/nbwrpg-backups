He was ready to dodge the blast, but he \ndoubted Hovotron would fire. The yell from Domnijoe made his smile \ngrow wider, but he glances annoyingly at Firestrike as the dissident \nspoke, then returning his gaze to Hovotron.\n\n&gt; &quot;Interesting faction you have. Who exactly did you say was the \ncommander?&quot; Autofire asks, playing off of the uncertainty of the \nConstructicons and whatever was going on with the bot behind Hovotron. \nHis smile shrinks somewhat as the Constructicons briefly form \nDevastator, but he smiles again as Devastator crumbles.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &quot;Your troops seem to be a bit out of shape,&quot; he comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n    ::DOMNIJOE AND BLINDCHAOS::\n\n    Blindchaos, upon recieving new orders from Megatron, eagerly left \nthe ship to join his comrads against Havotron. His appearance was \nquick and silent. He landed beside Soundwave with an earth thundering \nTHOOM. He Transformed into his Ankylosaur format and he poised himself \nfor attack should his efforts demand it. He showed no emotion upon \nseeing Devistastor fall apart.\n    Domnijoe smiled at the appearance of Soundwave&#39;s cassettes and \naimed her wrist launcher at Havotron. She hid her alarm when \nDevistator formed and quickly became relieved when he fell apart. \nThings were becomming quite ...INTERESTING!!\n\n\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
