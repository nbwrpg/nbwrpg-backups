Her wounds, marked with blue stung with the strange water. She had \nnever been at an ocean before. She bared with it, since she had endored \nworse pain that this. It wasn&#39;t worth whimpering about. She shook her body, \nspraying the salt water here and there. She didn&#39;t like the salty smell of \nthis terrain. She preferred the forest.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
