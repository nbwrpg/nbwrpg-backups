As she gains speed, she \nnotices that the small bot was slowing down. Dumbly, she relizes that he \nwasn&#39;t made for such long, high flights. If he kept going too long, he would \neither pass out or crash, and if he&#39;s high enough he could get seriously \ndamaged. She speed up a bit more, hoping to catch him before such a thing \noccured. The bumbling speck started to droop and go down slowly. She dove \ndown and swooped up, catching the little tyke by suprise. And just in time \ntoo. He was panting and unable to put up much of a fight, and, in the end, \nshe flew away with him, cradled in her arms, with some scratches and \nmilk-teeth marks.8\n\n*SNow Tech glanced up as Shadow Cat decended from the air, craddling her \nprecious cargo and crooning softly to it so it wouldn&#39;t be afraid.\nHe sighed and smiled to her when she landed next to him.*\n\n&quot; You have a way with kids, Shadow, mabey you should think of a career in \nbaby-sittin!&quot;\n\n*Hsadow Cat glared at Snow Tech and smacked him on the arm, but when the \nliitle &#39;un started to wake, she began crooning again, reduced to giving him \nsideways glares.*\n\n* NSow Tech grins and turns his back to her, effectivly mooning her. He \nstraightens his back and wipes the smile off his face. He presses his \ncom-link and broadcasts a signal.*\n\n&quot; To any Maximals in the vaciniety, we have crashed landed and ask for your \nservice. I repeat, we have crash landed and require your services.&quot;\n\n* and after a pause, grins evily and adds,*\n\n&quot; And we know your out there, we&#39;ve been watching!&quot;\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
