At the same time he raise=\r\ns his neck for another \nlook around.&nbsp; Then his head is swung ahead fac=\r\ning northward once \nagain.&nbsp; His long tail snaps at the ground beneath =\r\nhim, taking out what \nremains of the dinosaur bones, smashing them to splin=\r\nters.&nbsp; It felt good to \nroar, it helped to release trapped emotions th=\r\nat had built up over time.&nbsp; \nCertainly Rodimus was trying his patience=\r\n and it was a good method of not \nlashing out at him which would have been =\r\na grave mistake.&nbsp;

If we fight, it will not be =\r\nfrom a \n  stab in the back or a&lt;br&gt;reprogramming, it will be machine to mac=\r\nhine weapon \n  to weapon.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a grunt from RODIMUS, &quot;You know=\r\n Cyclonus, I \n  almost look&lt;br&gt;foward to that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two drove on, tr=\r\nying to find a way \n  for mortal enemies to work together.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD =\r\n\n  &lt;Tuscon&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; STAND BY ALL SOLDIERS! DEPLOYING SONAR AT=\r\nTACK \n  AT FULL STRENGTH!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; With a deep breath, Tucson rattl=\r\nes the \n  horizon with a sensor splitting sonic&lt;br&gt;&gt; inhibited roar. A w=\r\nave of sonar \n  energy is cast from his throat and powerful&lt;br&gt;&gt; vocaliz=\r\ners. Sharp teeth \n  and fangs glimmer in the moonlight as a strong&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nsilver tail thrashes \n  the ground beneath his four feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As TUSCON&#39;=\r\ns warning is heard the \n  Predacons shift their audio circuits&lt;br&gt;off as th=\r\ney glance back at at the \n  large dragon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RRROOOAAARRR!!=\r\n!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TUSCON&#39;s \n  roar can be heard for hundreds of miles as=\r\n the sound of it&lt;br&gt;echoes and \n  re-echoes out across the miles and miles =\r\nof dead dinosaurs.&lt;br&gt;One of the \n  first things he reailzes is that althou=\r\ngh capable of large&lt;br&gt;amounts of \n  damage, It is rougher and cruder in it=\r\ns sensory mode, but&lt;br&gt;capable of far \n  more damage then he could once del=\r\niver before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is almost like a wind \n  has picked up and blown som=\r\ne of the bodies&lt;br&gt;back. Dinosaurs that are caught \n  in the cone of effect=\r\n are broken and&lt;br&gt;tossed about, bones vibrating and then \n  snapped as if =\r\nhit by a tidal&lt;br&gt;wave, although instead of one of water, this \n  one is ma=\r\nde of sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, it was not the same as his original sonar, \n  but i=\r\nt was very effective indeed!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around TUSCON the Predacons, as well \n =\r\n as probrably the Maximals leaped&lt;br&gt;out of the way as the cones sweeps \n  =\r\nthrough. At high enough levels&lt;br&gt;sound can do actual physical damage and n=\r\not \n  just bust ear drums and&lt;br&gt;over load audio circuits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the ro=\r\nar dies \n  down, the damage that is done is incredible and&lt;br&gt;TUSCON&#39;s ener=\r\ngy cells are \n  slowly trying to recharge themselves from&lt;br&gt;such a high en=\r\nergy output (OOC: \n  He has to catch his breath). Across&lt;br&gt;the sensors the=\r\nre is no evidence of \n  anyone being affected beyond the&lt;br&gt;dead dinosaurs =\r\nand the movement of \n  TUSCON&#39;s allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as anyone could tell =\r\neither their enemy was out \n  of range of&lt;br&gt;TUSCON&#39;s roar or was protected=\r\n by them in some \n  manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;That was interesting.&quot; SKY SHADOW said =\r\nfrom his position next \n  to&lt;br&gt;HYDRAS as he shrugged his shoulders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&quot;And loud!&quot; INJECTOR said as \n  he buzzed near by. He was in beast mode&lt;br=\r\n&gt;looking like a strange cross of \n  lionfish and hornet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CYCLONUS an=\r\nd RODIMUS continued up towards the path \n  of devastation left&lt;br&gt;by the di=\r\nnosaurs, RODIMUS weaving between the bodies in \n  vehicle mode&lt;br&gt;while CYC=\r\nLONUS just flew above them as a \n  jet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(TAG)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preston&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR: whit=\r\ne;&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-88--218506009--\r\n\n"}}
