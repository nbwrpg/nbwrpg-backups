She \ninstinctively covers the wound, trying to stop the flow of mech-fluid. \nTavatron looks up in time to see Dinobot take the acid meant for her:\n\n&quot;Dinobot!&quot; Tavatron snarls at Mosquitor, her eyes glowing a deep crimson \nred:\n\n&quot;You slaggin&#39; Pred!&quot; Tavatron watches as Dinobot fires on Mosquitor *(just \ndescribin&#39; previous e-mails, not modin&#39; or anythin&#39;).

She \nraised her staff and used the energon blade to block some of the acid. \nUnfortuneatly she wasn&#39;t fast enough.\n\nTavatron falls back against Dinobot as some of Mosquitor&#39;s acid connects \nwith her chest wound. Tavatron screamed, the pain was too much! The acid \ndidn&#39;t even have to burn through her armor, BrightBlade had made sure of \nthat.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
