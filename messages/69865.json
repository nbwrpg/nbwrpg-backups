As you can se=\r\ne.  But I think I showed &#39;em ample enough that ya don&#39;t mess with a Decepti=\r\ncon.

I thought I had the matrix covered but it turned out I=\r\n&#39;d been had, big time.  Slaggn&#39; son of a miserable glitch..  Ohh yeah, I&#39;m =\r\nnot finished with Pretty boy yet, Scorponok, not by a long shot.  Okay, I&#39;m=\r\n ready ta go explain myself ta Hydras.

T=\r\nhey didn&#39;t get far before they started to battle, yet Nightshift was transm=\r\nitting a message to Hydras. His transmission range is extensive.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: =\r\nThanks, I appreciate the info :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC: Tucson makes for a make shi=\r\nft, mid transformation sequence, as instructed by Lord Elder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorr=\r\ny about that Sir, I shouldn&#39;t have assumed you had the capability. You&#39;re r=\r\night, this should be convincing enough.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Half robot, half SUV, Tucs=\r\non now falls to the ground, as if going unconcious. Walking further ahead, =\r\nwith a slow limp, Night Shift puts a little distance between himself and Tu=\r\ncson before falling painfully to the ground, waiting for help to arrive.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Lord Elder acknowledged Tuscon&#39;s transmission with a single stroke on\n&gt; =\r\nthe terminal. there was something funny about that dot that\n&gt; periodically =\r\nappeared. For the moment it disappeared again, probably\n&gt; because it had st=\r\nopped moving again. His computer instruments were\n&gt; picking up just barely,=\r\n it was only the very slightest of distortions.\n&gt; \n&gt; He glanced over at Eli=\r\nta, &quot;Yes&quot; he said distractedly, &quot;A hologram. But\n&gt; I don&#39;t have one. But ma=\r\nybe we all could build one later.&quot; he said as\n&gt; he watched the screen as hi=\r\ns radar began picking up Scorponok&#39;s\n&gt; approach, &quot;Oh boy, here it goes&quot; he =\r\nmumbled under his breath again.\n&gt; \n&gt; **************************************=\r\n*****\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; Scorponok began his approach, his robot mod=\r\ne clearly visible. Like\n&gt; many of the earlier built Decepticons, he had the=\r\n ability to fly in\n&gt; robot mode. Typically he saw no need to use it, but th=\r\nere were times\n&gt; when it was useful, such as now.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Nightshift moved =\r\nacross the ground, Scorponok moved in his\n&gt; direction, his larger frame and=\r\n massive dimension dwarfing your more\n&gt; typical and even most of your large=\r\nr framed mechs.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a deft use of boosters he landed on the ground a =\r\nfew meters in\n&gt; front of Nightshift and looked around. He looked over at Tu=\r\nscon&#39;s\n&gt; apparently broken form in the distance. &quot;Interesting.&quot; he said as =\r\nhe\n&gt; turned his gaze on the approaching Nightshift. &quot;Tuscon fell much\n&gt; eas=\r\nier to you than he did to the others.&quot; Scorponok said thoughtfully,\n&gt; conve=\r\nniently obscuring the fact that he was there too.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hydras wants to see=\r\n you.&quot; he said, his voice deep and somewhat firm,\n&gt; holding out a large cla=\r\nwed hand to steady Nightshift should he need\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Kee=\r\np in mind, due to the information being sent to Cyclonus,\n&gt; Hydras and anyo=\r\nne else in the command center can see and hear what is\n&gt; going on here.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
