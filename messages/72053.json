I like your portrayals of Hydras and\nNightlight and I really look forward to seeing what will happen to\neach of them. Nightlight is meeting meeting with Dark Rodimus and yet\nunsure if he is Rodimus or something else, then there is Hydras who is\nhaving to  react to all the changes that are happening with his staff\nand the world around him. Great job so far on these accounts!\n\nADAM: I have really enjoyed your portrayal of Wheelie. He is the\naggravating type that we enjoy seeing interacting, just with somebody\nelse! (smile). And yet he still shows wisdom and intelligence behind\nthat acid tongue. I also appreciate your inner monologues from time to\ntime, they give me things to bounce off of. Also, you have just taken\non the roles of Dinobot, Vice Grip and Blackaracnia, and from what I\ncan they are excellent portrayals, each with thier own styles and\npersonalities. I can easily see that they are going to be vibrant\nchaters.\n\nSANDY: It may seem like I poke at you at times, but it is because I\nsee so much potential in you. You have a really good grasp of playing\nmultiple characters at once and yet keeping things going. You are a\nprolific poster and you seem to be able to invest your characters with\nso much vitality and energy. I also appreciate your flexability - If\nsomething has to changed, you are readilly able to adjust and continue\non, that is the sign of a mature player. I always enjoy looking to see\nwhat you will post next and bouncing off your posts.\n\nSo again: EXCELLENT JOB all around!\n\nI shall be posting again really soon. This will be a busy weekend :)\nBut I will give Airly a chance to post for her characters first, and\nthen I look foward to another exciting chapter in NBWRPG!!!\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
