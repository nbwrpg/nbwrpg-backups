I checked the origin of the transmission and it \n&gt; &gt; concorded with the base where you are heading. I suggested they \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; meet you there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: You have what? What if their intentions are hostiles? They \n&gt; &gt; will have time to get ready for a forceful defense and we could \n&gt; suffer \n&gt; &gt; great casualties! You idiot!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He thought for a minute. Tankor&#39;s silence revealed his great \n&gt; &gt; embarassment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: On the other hand... If they truly wish to work with us... \n&gt; &gt; This could make things easier... Hellgate over and out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He thought. This operation was going to be either easier than \n&gt; &gt; expected, or a total butchery. The homeworlds could not wait... He \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; to go on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daemos: Jetstorm, Anachronox, get ready for vanguard drop. I have \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; new data. Expect either great resistance or no resistance at all. \n&gt; &gt; There could be a group of bots wishing to discuss. That&#39;s where \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; prophets will come in play. As soon as you three drop, you form \n&gt; &gt; Prophetus and lead negotiations. The vanguard drop is in 5 cycles. \n&gt; &gt; Understood.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Prophets looked at each other, worried, excited, thoughtful, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; nonetheless decided to live up to their name.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Belthassan: We are ready, Daemos.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jetstorm: Anachronox, I want to pick the small and many ones. I \n&gt; leave \n&gt; &gt; the big ugly ones to you, okay?\n\n\n"}}
