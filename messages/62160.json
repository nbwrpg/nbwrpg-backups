He&#39;d have to hammer \nout a deal so Blacknightmare could stay, and find a way so Wolfblade \ndidn&#39;t ream him when he finally returned.  Such choices.  He sighed \nheavily and decided to rest, enjoying being so close o \nBlacknightmare.\nBlacknightmare: the femme also was meditating, would she and her sis \nwelcomed to Maximal base? if they wouldn&#39;t, where they would go?\nMalice:  The bounty hunter also thought of what to do with \nHellplague.  She was more likely to not go with them, she would \nrather live without the Maximals and live alone.  That made him a \nlitle sad, but it was her choice, not his.  Malice settled down and \nreadied to go to sleep this time.\nBlacknightmare: Blacknightmare continued meditating.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
