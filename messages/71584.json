Youth is the time for =\r\nlearning, and there is nothing greater than a young mind that is eager to o=\r\nbtain the knowledge that will layer serve a greater purpose.&quot;\n\n&quot; I know he&#39;=\r\nll be sore at me for this but, all great warriors gotta start somewhere and=\r\n be given the chance ta grow into their own state of being.  My Sensai woul=\r\nd&#39;ve agreed with what we&#39;re doing, and what was good enough for him is good=\r\n enough for me.  So let&#39;s go kick some Con&#39;s cans and show them what we&#39;re =\r\nmade of.&quot;\n\nAs Straight Shot rides with Talon, she picks up on Tucson&#39;s loca=\r\ntion and from a far, realizes what is now transpiring between him and Hydra=\r\ns!  Still in cross bow mode, she calibrates her systems and weight distribu=\r\ntion to fit Talon&#39;s configurations, for optimal results.\n\n&quot; Hydras!  Ohhh I=\r\n can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gonna face off with him again!  He doesn&#39;t realize that=\r\n he needs help!  Wait, Ohh good, he&#39;s not alone, Rodimus is with him.  But =\r\nstill, it doesn&#39;t hurt ta lend him a hand.  I better let Leo Prime in on th=\r\nis, he&#39;s probably wondering why Tucson isn&#39;t contacting him, which is somet=\r\nhing he&#39;s notorious for doing. &quot;\n\nShe opens her link to Leo Prime.\n\n&quot; Leo P=\r\nrime, it&#39;s me, Straight Shot.  Talon and I are reaching Tucson&#39;s location s=\r\nhortly and I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t contacted you yet.  He&#39;s with Rodimus and now=\r\n he&#39;s facing off with Hydras.  A lotta fire just got deployed and I&#39;m defin=\r\nitely sure it wasn&#39;t from Hydras.  Tucson&#39;s in a really bad mood, and I thi=\r\nnk it&#39;s about ta get worse.&quot;\n\nMuch to Straight Shot&#39;s suspicion, Tucson doe=\r\ns indeed have the look of an enraged predator on his draconic face.  What h=\r\ne wouldn&#39;t do to be able to sink his sharp claws into Hydras, tearing at hi=\r\ns armor until there was nothing left.  Yet he holds enough restraint to hol=\r\nd back from doing so, for the time being.  \n\n&quot; Many innocent creatures who =\r\nwere native to this planet have lost their lives needlessly, no thanks to y=\r\nou and your reign of greed and destruction.  This is NOT our planet and we =\r\nhave NO right taking away what belongs here!  That is what brings me here, =\r\nHydras!  This planet deserves freedom and I am here to make sure it gets it=\r\n!&quot;\n\nHe exclaims with a loud draconic roar, as smoke seeps out of his flarin=\r\ng nostrils as do a couple of white hot flames.\n\nWith Rodimus still on his b=\r\nack, Tucson circles Hydras as the never ending coils of his long tail creat=\r\nes a ring around the enemy.\n\n&quot;Rodimus, this is also your chance to take bac=\r\nk something that was taken from you.  No holds barred, do what you feel is =\r\nthe right thing, and what you feel in your spark is rightful to your cause.=\r\n  I will follow suit.  We will fight as one, and as one we will serve judge=\r\nment to those who deserve it. &quot;\n\nHe remains in his circling pattern, waitin=\r\ng for Rodimus to direct him, in hopes to help build his confidence as an Au=\r\ntobot Commander.  At the same time, Tucson had to learn to control his grea=\r\ntest weakness, his uncontrollable temper which left unchecked, had the pote=\r\nntial to turn him into an extremely dangerous individual.  Now that he take=\r\ns on the role of a powerful creature, it would prove hard to quell the fire=\r\n that burns deep within his spark.  He hoped that this partnership would he=\r\nlp keep the balance between the both of them.  They would need that more th=\r\nan ever if they have hopes of stopping Hydras for good.\n\n\n\nPerpetually on t=\r\nhe move and constantly busy. \n\nOn Aug 8, 2011, at 1:40 AM, Airshadow Nights=\r\ntar &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Talon/Hydras/Elita:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Elita s=\r\naid to Nightshift =E2=80=9CDo you think that my dad will be mad if we leave=\r\n the base and going where they are?=E2=80=9D\n&gt;  \n&gt; =C2=A8******************=\r\n*****************\n&gt;  \n&gt; talon smiled and said to straight shot =E2=80=9CThe=\r\nn let=E2=80=99s got to  join him=E2=80=9D\n&gt;  \n&gt; She took the crossbow and h=\r\neaded towards the exit, she quickly left the base and flew towards Tucson=\r\n=E2=80=99s signal.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; ******************************************=\r\n********\n&gt;  \n&gt; =E2=80=9CBe ready=E2=80=9Dhissed anoyed the male while his c=\r\nomlink picke up Tucson=E2=80=99s signature =E2=80=9COpen fire at my signal.=\r\n..

&nbsp;That is what brings me here, Hydra=\r\ns! &nbsp;This planet deserves freedom and I am here to make sure it gets it=\r\n!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He exclaims with a loud draconic roar, as smoke=\r\n seeps out of his flaring nostrils as do a couple of white hot flames.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With Rodimus still on his back, Tucson circles Hydras =\r\nas the never ending coils of his long tail creates a ring around the enemy.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Rodimus, this is also your chance to take back s=\r\nomething that was taken from you. &nbsp;No holds barred, do what you feel i=\r\ns the right thing, and what you feel in your spark is rightful to your caus=\r\ne. &nbsp;I will follow suit. &nbsp;We will fight as one, and as one we will=\r\n serve judgement to those who deserve it. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He rem=\r\nains in his circling pattern, waiting for Rodimus to direct him, in hopes t=\r\no help build his confidence as an Autobot Commander. &nbsp;At the same time=\r\n, Tucson had to learn to control his greatest weakness, his uncontrollable =\r\ntemper which left unchecked, had the potential to turn him into an extremel=\r\ny dangerous individual. &nbsp;Now that he takes on the role of a powerful c=\r\nreature, it would prove hard to quell the fire that burns deep within his s=\r\npark. &nbsp;He hoped that this partnership would help keep the balance betw=\r\neen the both of them. &nbsp;They would need that more than ever if they hav=\r\ne hopes of stopping Hydras for good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpe=\r\ntually on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Aug 8, 2011,=\r\n at 1:40 AM, Airshadow Nightstar &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:airly2002@...=\r\nm&quot;&gt;airly2002@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote=\r\n type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;;COLOR: #000000;FONT-SIZE: 12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Talo=\r\nn/Hydras/Elita:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Elita said t=\r\no Nightshift =E2=80=9CDo you think that my dad will be mad if we leave \nthe=\r\n base and going where they are?=E2=80=9D&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=\r\n=A8***********************************&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;talon s=\r\nmiled and said to straight shot =E2=80=9CThen let=E2=80=99s got to&nbsp; jo=\r\nin \nhim=E2=80=9D&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: normal;F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;;COLOR: #000000;FONT-SIZE: small;FONT-WEIGHT: normal;T=\r\nEXT-DECORATION: none;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt tahoma;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;She took the crossbow and headed towards the \nexit,=\r\n she quickly left the base and flew towards Tucson=E2=80=99s signal.&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;**=\r\n************************************************&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;=E2=80=9CBe ready=E2=80=9Dhissed anoyed the male while his \ncomli=\r\nnk picke up Tucson=E2=80=99s signature =E2=80=9COpen fire at my signal...&n=\r\nbsp; This will \nbe a large day=E2=80=9D&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;Hydras closed t=\r\nhe com link and opened in Tucson=E2=80=99s \nfrecuency =E2=80=9CWell, well P=\r\nrime...

The=\r\nre is a great fire going on, one that \n  seems to be&lt;br&gt;raging for miles.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the distance TUSCON can pick up the \n  definite scent of Predacon&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;energy signatures, their dark forms darting over \n  the fire looking&lt;br&gt;=\r\nalmost like moths over a bright flame. However these moths \n  are firing&lt;br=\r\n&gt;blasts of energy at the fire keeping it bright and \n  hot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as =\r\nTUSCON was picking up the Predacons, they seemed to \n  be&lt;br&gt;becoming aware=\r\n of him as well as several of them fanned \n  out&lt;br&gt;defensively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***=\r\n**************************&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same \n  time HYDRAS also gets a me=\r\nssage from FRACTYL, &quot;Sir.
