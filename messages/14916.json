He was now flying over the ocean, the view \nwasn&#39;t much through the clouds but good weather was on his side. he \napproached Europe at top speed, it wouldn&#39;t be long now until he \nfound what he was looking for.\n\n\nMeanwhile in Norway the two new bots were prepareing for the return \nof Foxfingers with the dna they required.\n\n&quot;Are the machines ready for the first trial run?&quot; the Bot resembling \na bat asked\n\n&quot;Almost father&quot; the Hawkbot replied, &quot;We need more material for the \ntest.&quot;\n\n&quot;I may have to send you out if Foxfingers fails, would you like \nthat?&quot; the first said, a small smile on his lips, he already knew the \nanswer but he had to make it her decision. \n\n&quot;You know I would father, it&#39;s been to long since I got to spread my \nwings.&quot; the female replied finding a reasonable excuse to let her go.\n\n&quot;Then go my Ladybird but don&#39;t forget about our mission&quot; he  \nexclaimed. It bothered him to allow her access to this big world but \nhe cared for her to much to deny her such luxuries.\n\n&quot;Yes my father, Till All Are One.&quot; with those words she became \nairborne. she transformed to a three eyed hawk, spread her wings and \nflew like a newborne bird spreading it&#39;s wings for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
