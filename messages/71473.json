But I think we have a way to\nreproduce it controllably, as long a=\r\ns you think your spark can handle\nit.&quot;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift looks to Nig=\r\nhtlight with a friendly smile.  He was happy to see\n&gt; that Nightlight remem=\r\nbered who he was.  He had also been concerned for her\n&gt; safety as were the =\r\nothers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; And I&#39;d go through it again too, if I had ta.  It&#39;s real nice=\r\n ta have ya\n&gt; back.  I just wish we knew what Hydras weakness is.  The prob=\r\nlem is that\n&gt; guy&#39;s got too many sets of eyes on &#39;em and in his alt form...=\r\n Wait Thats it,\n&gt; why didn&#39;t I think of this before?  Nightlight, I get it =\r\nnow.  I bet that if\n&gt; he lost all visual capabilities, Hydras would be seve=\r\nrely compromised.  On\n&gt; the other hand, Tucson lost the last fight because =\r\nHydras had &#39;em at a\n&gt; disadvantage.  But if Tucson took out all his visual =\r\ncircuitry, then he\n&gt; would have the upper hand.  Tucson&#39;s been blind a long=\r\n time, it&#39;s second\n&gt; nature ta him ta fight that way.  But it&#39;s not for Hyd=\r\nras. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He turns his head over to Bump.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; How would we go about knoc=\r\nk&#39;n out Hydras visual circuitry?&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a noncommital shrug fr=\r\nom BUMP, &quot;Well a simple flash-bang\ngrenade could do it. It is basically a b=\r\nright light followed by a\ndeafening noise.&quot; He shrugged again, &quot;I am not ty=\r\npically a weapons\nengineer, but they should be in the weapons stores.&quot;\n\nBUM=\r\nP glanced at the readouts displaying NIGHTLIGHT&#39;s vital signs,\nnodding when=\r\n everything looked good. He looked back at NIGHTSHIFT,\n&quot;Did you have anythi=\r\nng specific in mind?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
