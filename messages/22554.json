She waited untill the pod had landed and was shut down \nbefore leaving the pod. She walked out of the hanger bay and and went \nto the mess hall. She ordered a large glass of liquid gold energon an \ndowned the whole glass in one gulp.  Feeling refreshed, she opened \nher link. &quot;ZARDUS, I am home and have complete my mission. I am \nwaiting for an audiance with you when you are redy. Contact me when \nyou can.&quot; She shut off her link and ordered another drink.  She \nsmiled and planned to put her container with the remains of the GREAT \nKITKAT on a wall in her room.  She was glad she had another leader&#39;s \ndeath under her resume.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; He saw her spark flucuate.
