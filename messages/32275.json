He swears, waving the smoke away and backing up,\n&gt; firing his chain guns blindly in the general direction of the CF. He\n&gt; grunts as two objects hit him in the back, feeling his systems\n&gt; struggle as they tried to regain power, the two objects that had hit\n&gt; him draining energy faster than he could replace it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He spins around, backing away from the draining energy fields that\n&gt; the two missiles fired by Zardus had created. The drain lessens and\n&gt; his power levels begin to rise again. He looks up at the enemy,\n&gt; watching Zardus fly in, more than ten Alliance bots following. This\n&gt; was definitely not good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, attack,&quot; he replies to the member of the Predacons (gestalt\n&gt; group, not faction) who had sent him a comm, aiming both chain guns\nat\n&gt; Zardus and firing more than two dozen shots from each.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Zardus angles up, the shots fired by the bot he had just hit with\n&gt; the missiles missing. He scans the area, seeing that there were a\ngood\n&gt; amount of Decepticons here. He activates his comm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Astral,&quot; he says into it, &quot;New orders. Come and aid at this\nbattle,\n&gt; bring all the troops that you can.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; The Galactors spread out as they fly into the scene. Supernova\naims\n&gt; his missile launcher, letting loose several shots at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lessee, who I wanna kill?&quot; Flare says, then fires two grenades\ndown\n&gt; at Sinnertwin.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Vicyr, completely cloaked, flies below the others, firing three\n&gt; laser bolts at Rampage.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Slasys aims carefully, firing two missiles with deadly precision\n&gt; down at Razorclaw.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Scrap, flying to the left of the rest of the group, fires four\n&gt; lasers down at Rippersnapper.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Prowl spins around to look at the smoke when he recieves Quarto&#39;s\n&gt; message, thankful for the warning. He sees Alliance bots fly in in\nthe\n&gt; distance and open fire on the attackers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Time for battle yet again,&quot; he says to Mantle, flying into the\nair\n&gt; and seeing someone attacking behind the CF. He flies toward\nFireblade,\n&gt; landing quickly near Firedrill and his friends.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nice to see you both up and about,&quot; he says to the two that he\n&gt; hadn&#39;t seen conscious untill now. &quot;You guys are welcome to help\ndefend\n&gt; the base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prowl lifts off again, flying at Fireblade and firing two missiles\n&gt; at him.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Kluster runs out of the CF as the alarms go off, his missile\n&gt; launcher firing two missiles at Rippersnapper as soon as he gets out\n&gt; of the door, aiming carefully as to not hit any Maximals.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; (Argh, forgot about Grimmler! Sorry if I didn&#39;t reply to your last\n&gt; post with Tremmer, Megan)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Grimmler hears gunfire as he heads back to the CF. &quot;Slag! We&#39;re\n&gt; under attack again!&quot; He exclaims and runs off toward the ship,\n&gt; motioning for Tremmer to follow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ::Rippersnapper/Preadcons::\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rippersnapper&#39;s impatience increases, &quot;Signal!

He opens a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; commlink to Autofire, &quot;Hello Autofire. I am Razorclaw of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Predacons. Megatron sent me and my Predacons as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; renforcements, he told us to expect a signal to attack soon, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we are arriving and ready.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Divebomb reaches Autofire first, lands and transforms, looking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around and smiling.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rampage is thundering on behind Razorclaw, a sleek panther, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blur on the background. He dodges trees, speeding to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destination, Razorclaw doing likewise, after his commlink\nmessage.\n\n\n"}}
