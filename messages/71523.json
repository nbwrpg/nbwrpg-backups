It was all about speed, precision, balance, di=\r\nscipline, grace, and of course effectiveness.\n\nHe could see potential in he=\r\nr and turns his head in both Nightlight and Bumps direction.\n\n&quot; Bump&#39;s righ=\r\nt, that&#39;s somethn&#39; ya gotta learn, but I see a lotta potential for train&#39;n =\r\nya as a Ninjabot.  You got the right moves, mody, and grace, and once you&#39;r=\r\ne trained, there&#39;s gonna be no stopp&#39;n you Nightlight.  Master Yokitron onc=\r\ne said, that a student often shows potential even if they don&#39;t realize it =\r\nthemselves.  Now, that&#39;s totally up to you if ya want the training, just se=\r\ne me after we get repaired, and I&#39;ll set up a training program for ya.  Hmm=\r\n, maybe Rodimus might wanna join in on it too..  It&#39;s a perfect opportunity=\r\n for both of you ta get some extra training under your belts.&quot;\n\nHe position=\r\ns himself again.\n\n&quot; It would really help both of you out a lot, see&#39;n what =\r\nHydras managed ta pull on ya in the past.  The reason why it didn&#39;t work on=\r\n Tucson or me, is that Master Yokitron&#39;s training sorta prepared us spiritu=\r\nally for what could come down the pike.  Clear minds empty of thoughts are =\r\nless likely ta get infected by negative influences, simply because there&#39;s =\r\nno thought energy ta hold onto.  Clear mind, clear soul, clear spark.  Bad =\r\nstuff just goes in one way, and out the other.  You guys had a lot on your =\r\nminds when Hydras took you.  And that couldn&#39;t be helped, but now it can be=\r\n.  I bet my spark plugs that if you and Rodimus train with me, I can get bo=\r\nth of ya up ta our level and that&#39;ll make you a pair of the strongest Autob=\r\nots this side of the galaxy, but not the type of strength most warriors per=\r\nceive.  This type of strength is the strength of spirit, inner peace, and h=\r\narmony.  A perfect balance between spark, soul, and mind.  And yeah, there&#39;=\r\ns a lotta dexterity aquired in Ninjabot training, the type of dexterity tha=\r\nt makes even Tucson Prime a bit different then the traditional Autobot Comm=\r\nander.  It&#39;s a difference Hydras has no inclination how ta fend off. THAT&#39;S=\r\n the direction Tucson is gonna take, and if you guys were trained in our ar=\r\nt, so more power to ya.&quot;\n\nHe then looks to Bump, as the repair bench does i=\r\nts job to repair the internal damages done to him.\n\n&quot; Speakn&#39; of performanc=\r\ne, that reminds me...  I need new hydraulic shock absorbers, timing belt, a=\r\nnd I know my struts need work, new tires, body work, and Ty Rods fixed.  Oh=\r\n yeah, need a new front and back end alignment too.&quot;\n\nTo repair the damgage=\r\ns to his alt form, he now transforms into his vehicle mode, to prepare for =\r\nthe rest of his repairs.  He also notices a busted headlight on the left si=\r\nde.\n\n&quot;Scrap, throw in a new headlight for the left side, new bumpers, front=\r\n, back, side, and awww slag, transmission&#39;s actn&#39; up.  Probably because I s=\r\nmacked that tree real hard in alt form. After this is all done, I am so gon=\r\nna give those preds the bill, literally.  In other words, I need a total ov=\r\nerhaul ta my alt form.  And if you can help it, I&#39;d like ta hold onta this =\r\none for a while.&quot; \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight Stood up And leave her dau=\r\nghter in the bed, she smiled and said\n&gt; &gt; to her daughter &quot;I be righ back i=\r\nn  no time, just remain here&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes Mommie&quot;said happily Elita\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Nightlight smiled and she walked toward the interior of the cr, she looke=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; to Bump and said &quot;I&#39;m ready, could you add any defensive skills that =\r\nI may\n&gt; &gt; need?? please&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; BUMP looked at NIGHTLIGHT quizzica=\r\nlly, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He\n&gt; manipulated a few controls on his screen. &quot;If=\r\n you are looking for a\n&gt; specific ability, I can see what I can do, but as =\r\nfar as skills, that\n&gt; is something you learn. I can&#39;t make you a sharp shoo=\r\nter or a lock\n&gt; pick. I can only give you the tools you need to make that h=\r\nappen.
