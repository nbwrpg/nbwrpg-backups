The battle had \nbeen hard, and not being able to deal with wars between the factions \nany more, she had given up and become Neutral. It was so much easier \nthan constant war!\n\nShe actually felt pretty good, despite the fact she ran away. Ah \nheck, she&#39;d see them again, she&#39;d help them, but when the final \nbattle cane, she didn&#39;t want to be part of it.\n\nHer mind screamed at her that she was a coward. Her Father - a great \nWarrior - would be dissapointed in her. Her mother would be proud of \nher. Mother always wanted her to be a Healer, she always was one to \ngo go with The Way of the Leaf. To live ones appointed time, and to \nnot resist when its their time to die. If they are attacked, you run, \nbut you don&#39;t defend yourself, because to hurt something is bad to \nthe soul. \n\nTeltoli&#39;s face screwed up in contempt. She couldn&#39;t remember the \ntimes that she had argued with her Mother over that point.\n\nAnd so, here she was in this hot savannah, trying to seek out her old \nfriend Carnage. She missed her terribly, and she wanted to apolgize \nfor just vanishing like that last time. Hopefully she could stay a \nwhile longer this time!\n\nCarnage had been the first bot that Teltoli had met when she had come \nout the pod. First meetings were slightly scary, especially when the \nfirst bot was a large raptor that looked like she could tear a bot to \nshreds on a whim. But they had gotten to know each other, travelled \ntogether, and a friendship grew that couldn&#39;t be replaced, or at \nleast in her mind. \n\nShe shook a bug off her nose, and it flew off, twirling to the ground \nin it&#39;s vain attempt to get its wings to work. The yellow grass was a \nplain contrast against her silver and black coat, and it messed up \nher fur, annoyingly. A panther wasn&#39;t meant for this sort of \nenvironment, and her wings that were lying flat across her back only \nserved to heat her up more. Her wings! Teltoli rolled her eyes and \nflapped her hawk wings, flying into the sky and putting her two front \nlegs out to steady herself. \n\n&quot;Whoohoo!&quot; Her cry echoed over the gassy plains, she loved flying, \nand it was so much easier than walking. It made her feel free, to be \none with the sky, the very esscense of life and all the joys that \ncame with it. Free among the birds.\n\nRealizing what she was meant to be doing, she turned her optics to \nthe ground and hummed a tune as she scanned.\n\n\n"}}
