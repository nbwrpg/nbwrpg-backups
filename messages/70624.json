We will cover our signatures \n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; well&quot;said hydras as he masked his signatures with the device and headed\n&gt;&gt; towards the exit\n&gt;\n&gt; The other soldiers also follow suit, each taking a masking device.\n&gt; Each mask was designed to mask the spark signature of each individual\n&gt; it was attached to, making it difficult to scan for them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The area around the shuttle was barren, very few trees and foliage,\n&gt; and the ground was predominantly flat, it sloping up and down as one\n&gt; walked or flew. Although the land was flat that did not mean it was\n&gt; smooth, it was obvious to anyone looking that this area had been mined\n&gt; long ago, and parts of it were still broken and choppy, the very dirt\n&gt; still black and brown with mixtures of rust colored sediment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even the air itself was brown foggy haze, remenants of the smog that\n&gt; seemed to live over the mining city roughly a mile away from here.\n&gt;\n&gt; The soldiers each stood outside the shuttle, Inferno and Terrorsaur\n&gt; standing near to Hydras like bodyguards, with Taratulus nearby like\n&gt; some skulking meance. Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike\n&gt; also came out of the shuttle, each of them ready looking around an\n&gt; eagerness to each step. Last came Waspinator, his optics quick and\n&gt; furtive. Despite that he usually came back from battle in peices, he\n&gt; seemed ready to back up his comrades, his weapon held firmly in hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is all of us sir.&quot; Injector said, it seemed that for the moment\n&gt; he had taken charge of the Fuzors in Skyshadow&#39;s absence, and he was\n&gt; large and incharge. He smiled as he looked at Hydras, &quot;When ever you\n&gt; are ready we will follow you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
