She was mad.  She had tried to help him and he totaly blew \nher off.  She had help her hand out to help and he slapped it away. \nShe threw her fist into a wall as hard as she could.  She was livid \nwith him.  She hit the wall again and again.  She sat on the edge of \nher bed and watched her nuckles turn black and blue.  Then she had a \nnice thought.  She remembered that tomorrow she was to go sparring \nwith Lunarpine.\n&quot;I&#39;ll get that ego inflated flea bag tomorrow. And I know just how to \ndo it.&quot;\nShe grabbed her small sachel and walked out of her room.\nShe transformed into her owl mode and flew off in the opposite \ndirection of Lunarpine.  She went to a small creek and gathered up a \nfew stones.  The largest ones that she could lift with her beak and \nput them in her sachel.  When the sachel was full, she flew back to \nthe base.  She transformed into bot mode and walked to her room with \nthe sack full of rocks and closed her room door behind her.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; (Getting ready 4 the sparring match?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine stared up at the sky, it was beautifully lit through the \n&gt; trees. he needed a rest. his adrenaline was flowing from the \n&gt; explosion and the argument. he tried to pick up Megatrons trail but \n&gt; lost the scent when Megs left the treeline. the rest wasn&#39;t hard to \n&gt; follow. broken branches, downed trees, and burn marks on the ground \n&gt; made it obvious where Megs had been and he wasn&#39;t here now so \n&gt; Lunarpine found a nice place to curl up. He had to rest, he had a \n&gt; sparring session in the morning.
