He was humored by the bunch. He was glad to have found a \nrag-tag \n&gt; bunch of hooligans he could bunk with until he recovered. He had \n&gt; travelled alone for ar too long and he was glad that he found\n&gt; comrads. \n&gt; He was almost glad for his lost battle. He ran his fingers over his \n&gt; cockpit as he thought and quickly drew them away when agony shot \n&gt; through him.\n&gt;     &quot;Damn...I love... my cockpit.&quot; he said, strain and frustration \nin \n&gt; his voice. He paused and joined Beachcomber at his side. He watched \n&gt; the blue Autobot survey his surroundings. &quot;If I may add...&quot; he said \n&gt; carefully, &quot;try to find a spot..were...I can...fly...You can ..use \nme \n&gt; as an aerial...scout.&quot;\n&gt;     Redhot&#39;s expression became dark. Not quite evil but certainly \n&gt; betraying his Decepticon roots.\n\n\n::Redhot::\n\n    Redhot found a rocky rise he could sit on and carefully lowered \nhimself on it. His wings still ached. He yelped quietly when he bumped \none of them. Satisfied that the pain wasn&#39;t going to kill him, he \nactivated his colour scanners in his eyes. At the edges of his \neyesight flickering bars metered the amount of blues, reds, yellows \nand related mixes. Superficially they were useless, but they had \nproven useful more then once in conflict. He had taught himself to use \nthe colour changes to detect threats. He smiled at the thought. He \nfocused in on Beachcomber&#39;s arm and comaperd it to the sky&#39;s richest \nblue.\n    &quot;There&#39;s more red in his arm&quot; he muttered absentmindedly. &quot;Wonder \nhow much yellow he&#39;d need to blend in.&quot;\n\nNorthlight\nDomnijoe Productions\n\n********************************\n\n\n"}}
