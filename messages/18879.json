Oh my...are you sure that is what \nthe profecy meant? Literally till all are one? I&#39;m not sure.  I \nagree, combining the maximal and predacon programs may be a good \nthing, but then again... OK, think about how the predacons and \nmaximals get alone now.  If you combine the programs, you&#39;ll eithr \nhave a bot that is totally neutral, or totally insane. But, there may \nbe another way.  What if we took the best of both and combined parts \nof the two programs, but not doanload the whole program.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; -Lady Hawk listened intently, it was possible to teach a bot when \n&gt; it&#39;s programming is new, but it was to hard to teach a new bot old \n&gt; tricks. &quot;Right now there are still two main programmings, Maximal \nand \n&gt; Predacon. What if we were to combine the two? Not just combine \n&gt; animals but combine programming too.&quot; Squizzy was smart enough to \n&gt; know when ideas were right or wrong. She could be just the bot \n&gt; Veratis would need to help achieve his goals. &quot;After all&quot; She \n&gt; continued &quot;Didn&#39;t the profecy say Till all are one?&quot;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
