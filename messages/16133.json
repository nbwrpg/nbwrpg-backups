And they would have been attacked there then in this glade, which was \nnow reduced to nothing other then a battlefield now.\nHe sighed in both disappointment and the pain of his injuries, if only he \nwould have known that such an action as staying here would mean both the end \nof a truly magical place�and the destruction of half of his armor.\n\nDinobot growled as he looked down at his chest-plate and side, watching the \nwaves of mech-fluid as it flowed over his bare circuits and diodes. He was a \nmess! Even where he wasn�t injured he was covered with his own mech-fluid \nthanks to the force of that blast from Oblitercon, and he knew that sooner \nor later he would go into stasis lock�but just hoped that he was at the CF \nby the time that happened.\n\nThe pain of his wounds was making him more aggressive then he meant to be, \nhowever, he was in too much pain at the moment to really care if others were \noffended by his tone of voice. And frankly, he didn�t care if they were.\nDinobot continued to glare at Tavatron for a moment longer before turning \nhis optics towards the battlefield once again, the large shape of Oblitercon \nin the near distance.\nObviously there were bots now in battle with that giant, but he wasn�t one \nof them.\n\nIn one hit that slaging rusty Alliance bucket of slag had downed and \ndefeated him.\nThough, he had known even as the Alliance formed Oblitercon�that he didn�t \nhave a chance.\nDinobot growled, he never did like to admit he was weak to a foe, but when \nyou�re about as tall as its� middle finger�you sorta have to.\nHe snarled again in annoyance as he looked back towards Tavatron, the motion \nof his movements causing his wounds to spark in pain once again. Causing the \nreptile warrior to cringe, bow his head and bare his teeth for a moment \nwhile he waited for the pain to recede.\nFinally, after a few moments, the pain subsided and he was able to relax the \nmuscles in his chest again, finally able to look up at Tavatron again.\n\nBut then he noticed something about her that he hadn�t before, something \nthat he had missed�she was injured!\nHer shoulder-plate was missing and the circuits surrounding her joint was \nleaking a fair amount of mech-fluid.\nDinobot looked at her shoulder for a moment before turning his optics \ntowards her face, though her image was only half focused since one optic no \nlonger functioned.\nHe was about to say something before the giant reptile shape of Necromancer \nappeared, his huge head appearing right between the two warriors.\n\nDinobot backed up a step with a growl, yet again forced to refocus his optic \nto keep the dragon from becoming a blur.\nHe shook his head but couldn�t help feel the aggression in him rise yet \nanother notch at the dragons intrusion, growling deeply in his general \ndirection.\nIt was times like this that he was pissed off easily, and all a bot had to \ndo was be there!\nDinobot snarled as he then walked around Necromancers great head until \nTavatron was in his limited view once again, though hearing the dragons� \nwords once again.\nHowever, at the moment the wound on Tavatron�s shoulder frustrated him.*\n\n� I thought I told you to wait the battle out in the forest?!!�\n\n* He then thrust a clawed finger out towards her damaged shoulder.*\n\n� Now look what occurred. I did NOT rescue you from the Alliance so that you \ncould be slaged by them again!!�\n\n* Dinobot glared at her before he was forced to take a step back from a \nsudden pain in his chest, accidentally bumping into the side of \nNecromancer�s head as he bowed his own and cringed.\nIt seemed that yet another fluid pump had deactivated, which meant that \nthere was only one left before he went into stasis lock, and only that one \nand one other before he died.\nHe grit his teeth to try and force the pain down, but it just wouldn�t be \nreckoned with.\n\nDinobot knew that he needed help, and Necromancer was offering it. He knew \nit as acceptable and he needed help, and even though he wanted to simply \ntell the dragon to bug off�he needed his offered help.\nHowever, he did manage to speak with little proof that he was in true pain.\nHis head half turned towards the large eye of Necromancer. *\n\n� Your offer is acceptable�due to the current situation.�\n\n* But Dinobot slowly regained his posture and looked again up at Tavatron, \nthe pain slowly receding and allowing him to relax again�slightly.\nHe knew for a fact that he was severely injured and had no hope of making \nback to base without assistance, though, it was harder then anybot could \nknow for him to admit that.\nBut, now his internal systems were beginning to go offline and it we only a \nmatter of time before another fluid pump deactivated and he was sent into \nstasis lock, and that lightheadedness in which he experienced before as well \nas the lose of fluid was making his stomach upset to the point of \nexperiencing nausea.\n\nDinobot simply looked at Tavatron and gestured towards Necromancer, it \nevident that he was accepting the dragons help because he couldn�t make it \non his own�and the expression on his face not only relaying his pain�but \nrelaying his dislike of needing help in the first place. *\n\n� After you.�\n\n* His voice a wet growl, thanks the mech-fluid beginning to coat his throat. \n*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
