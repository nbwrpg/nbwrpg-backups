But the sheer \nsize of it was enough to make one think twice about attacking it head on, \nshe looked more closely and saw that this new bot almost seemed...wild.\nBrightBlade shook her head.*\n\n&quot; I haven&#39;t a clue. Most be something that Scourge scrounged up from \nsomewhere.&quot;\n\n* She looked at Scourge and then the new bot, she didn&#39;t like the look of \nit.*\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* Rage looked up at the huge ship and took a step back, she looked at \nScourge and then back at the metal thing in front of her.\nSuddenly the smell of food came to her sensors and her mouth began to water, \nRage looked around and finally saw the source of the smell.\nGangon!\nShe heard her stomach growl and she was dying to just sink her teeth into \nhim but then the words of Scourge came into her mind...she was not to attack \nany of the beings in this place.\nRage sighed, there went her dinner plans!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
