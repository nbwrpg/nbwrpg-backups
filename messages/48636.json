You&#39;re ideas\n&gt; could be worth considering, but the considering\n&gt; would be pointless because\n&gt; you&#39;re ideas suck.  You think you&#39;re ideas are great\n&gt; and that you&#39;re\n&gt; awesome, well guess what?  You act like an immature\n&gt; 13-year old or\n&gt; something, because all you do is rant and rave and\n&gt; say stuff and continue to\n&gt; get on my nerves!  Man, if there wasn&#39;t any of those\n&gt; weird &quot;nice-guys&quot; such\n&gt; as rauq on the council, but instead me, you would\n&gt; soooooo have your ass\n&gt; kicked!  And now, the council is either going to act\n&gt; like the Corporate\n&gt; idiots called the McMahons and start lecturing me on\n&gt; how I shouldn&#39;t swear\n&gt; and crap and say the truth by saying your ideas\n&gt; suck, and/or you&#39;re going to\n&gt; reply to this with your monotonous whining...\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Kyle Stewart&quot; &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, April 21, 2002 5:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Poll results for nbwrpg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (mindless rant in 3....2...1...) DID YOU NOT READ\n&gt; IT\n&gt; &gt; OR ARE YOU JUST TO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND IT!  GOOD\n&gt; &gt; RPING WOULD EARN MORE POINTS THAN WINNING BATTLES\n&gt; (I\n&gt; &gt; noted making a char successfully act messed up in\n&gt; da&#39;\n&gt; &gt; head would get more points than winning a fight)\n&gt; &gt; WINNING BATTLES WOULDN&#39;T GET YOU NEARLY AS MANY\n&gt; POINTS\n&gt; &gt; YOU MORON!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- Rudra656@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a) impractical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b) unfair\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not as simple as scoring a fight, for one\n&gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone would have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keep track of it and that person would have to\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impartial.  No one here is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impartial.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s unfair because there&#39;s more to RP&#39;ing than\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting.  In fact one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the biggest complaints before the restart was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there were too many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pointless battles.  To make it all about\n&gt; fighting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if you want to fix these problems and\n&gt; resubmit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your idea to the council,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest you send it to the council.  Your idea\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merit and might work if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can fix the flaws.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
