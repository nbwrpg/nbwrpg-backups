She ran \noutside the base.  She found a small hole in which to crawl into and \ntransformed into her mouse mode.  She crawled her way deep into the \nground and found the empty chamber at the bottom.  There, she curled \nup into a ball and went to sleep.  Over time, her systems shut down \nand she went into self sustained hybernation.  There she would rest \nfor eons if nessassary.  One day, she would awaken to find the new \nworld.  In her sleep, she dreamed of the predacons ruling the planet \nand winning the beast wars. Bu then, only the matrix new for sure.\n\nOOC:Take DarkMouse off the rosters.  She will be on the inactive list \nuntill I am able to return.\nThe  other chars have been handed out. \n\n\n"}}
