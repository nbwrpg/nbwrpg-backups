The wolfbot was a\ntransmutant but he still considered Maximal ground to be his territory and\nwolves didn&#39;t like any type of predatory creature in thier territory. &quot;Did\nVeratis send you?&quot; he asked fearing what a monster of this size could do to\nthe scientists base.\n\n&quot;He created me.&quot; the Dragon replied. &quot;I sent myself to this pathetic group.&quot;\nthe dragons grin was like a fox after a chicken dinner. &quot;I had no idea that\nother mutant existed.&quot; the creature of the dark ages stood tall. He was\nstriving for intelligence and made little secret of his motives.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll get nothing more from me except my name, rank, and function.&quot; the\nwolf bot stood tall. He was still nothing compared to his opponent but the\nstubborn bot would not back down.\n\n&quot;Fine&quot; A quick reply from Megaton caught Lunarpine off gaurd. &quot;We can start\nwith that.&quot; The dragon smiled again. He was getting what he wanted from the\nwolf in bots clothing.\n\nLunarpine was suspicious, this was to easy, Megaton had backed down way to\neasily. &quot;Ice Bird,&quot; he thought. He used her full name to show how serious\nthe matter was. &quot;What can you see in his thoughts?&quot; The meeting had turned\ninto a stareing contest between the two. Lunarpine had hoped Ice could hear\nhis thoughts.\n\nIce stood onboard the CF still unable to leave. Mentally she was still weak\nfrom  pushing Lunarpine through the shields when she heard her name. She\ntried to sense the other bot but couldn&#39;t read him very well. &quot;I&#39;m getting\nsomething.&quot; She pushed herself trying to get a better read. She sensed the\ndragons emotions, pain, anger, want, and something she couldn&#39;t quite\nrecognize, Megalomania. &quot;Be carefull my love.&quot;She thought back to Lunarpine,\n&quot;This bots more than you&#39;ll ever want to know.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
