The \nautoguns from the base peppered the skies, raking through the hos=\r\nt \ndropping many from the skies! Even as the combined firepower of \nthe=A0d=\r\nefenders raged across them the sweeps moved out into a slightly \nwider arc,=\r\n seperating so as not to present such an easy target. With \none accord thie=\r\nr own disintergrator cannons opened up, tearing into \nthe earth below them =\r\nas they targetted the base and the defenders!\n&gt; As Jhiaxus moved in to dogf=\r\night the sweeps, his weapons burning \ninto them, they quickly spin out of h=\r\nis way, thier movements quick \nand supple as they manuvered. However as he =\r\nmoved forward he realized \nthat it was not the effectiveness of his weapons=\r\n that gained him the \nadvantage, but it was the design of the sweeps! As th=\r\ney swung away \nfrom before him, they were closing in behind him, boxing him=\r\n in, \nthier powerful canons firing. \n&gt; Just as the sweeps were fulling clos=\r\ning the trap on Jhiaxus, a few \nof those to his rear exploded and began fal=\r\nling from the skies as \nMyrmidon, now in starfighter mode caught up, his ca=\r\nnnons cutting a \nswath of wreckage through the air. &quot;I would not recommend =\r\nseperating \nfrom the group.&quot; the 6-changer&#39;s voice cut through the \nchannel=\r\ns. &quot;There are so many of them, we could all be cut off.
