But who are these guys \n&gt; battling it out.&quot;  He then recieved the comm from Lynxiz, but not \n&gt; before blasts hit the Chivtron shields.  &quot;Lynxiz, the base is under \n&gt; attack, if I open the shields the base could be destroyed by one \nhit \n&gt; of that beast, but if I don&#39;t, Trinity...&quot; he left the sentece \nhanging for \n&gt; a moment.  &quot;You have ten seconds to get in the base. Go now&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The shields on the Chivtron base dropped as a blue glow went \n&gt; bright then out.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Seekker didn&#39;t have the same thoughts of either Lokk or Axis.  \n&gt; First, he never checked his ammo, second, he didn&#39;t care who \n&gt; knew where he was.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheee haaaaa hahaaaa whooooo&quot; he yelled jumping from off the \n&gt; pod Axis was behind pulling his trigger shooting out 20 shots from \n&gt; each minigun (40 total) before all he got was a click click click.  \nHe \n&gt; immediatly stopped running at Gemini.  &quot;ummm,  i&#39;ve been turned \n&gt; into a cow, may i go home&quot; he said looking confusedly at his \n&gt; miniguns.  Swinging them under his arms they latched on his back \n&gt; as the small bot began running at gemini again, top speed.  \n&gt; &quot;IIIICCCCEEE CRRREEEEAAAMMMM&quot; he yelled out as he leaped \n&gt; for one of gemini&#39;s heads.\n\n\n"}}
