His systems went into \ndefense and ran towards them. He could smell a few bots and even \nfirepower that had resently been fired, despite his poor sense of \nsmell. He found the room where the noise was, discovering that a \nscuffle was the focus. He saw the three bots he saw in the bridge \nbefore, Black Arachnia lying on the floor, and Tarantulas. \n\n&quot;T?&quot; he said, wide-eyed. He looked around. He walked towards Black \nArachnia to aid her. &quot;What in tarnation happpened?&quot; he asked, \nwatching Tarantulas.\n\n\n"}}
