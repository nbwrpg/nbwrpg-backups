How can they destroy what \nthey do not unders=\r\ntand?  My body is a complex marvel, my ability to \nheal, my power absorbtio=\r\nn, everything that I can do is to enable my \nultimate survival.  So I very =\r\nmuch doubt their ability to kill me.  \nBut don&#39;t tell them that.  When they=\r\n get sick of me, they&#39;ll \nsurrender to be rid of me!&quot;\n&gt; Without much warnin=\r\ng, Malice stunned Rodimus, knocked him out, and \ndrug him a short distance =\r\nfor safety.  He then charged toward the \nminions, intent on fulfilling his =\r\nplan.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Organics tried to take assurance in Nightlight&#39;s words, she sti=\r\nll \nfelt the fear of losing Malice again.  She jarred back to reality \nwhen=\r\n Nightlight hugged her.  The larger femme shuddered and lowered \nher head.\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;But Malice...?  Even he can&#39;t take them all...&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague charged=\r\n forward as Malice ran forward.  She tackled \nhim, and while he was on the =\r\nground, Splattercannon and Necross \npulled his arms behind his back.  The t=\r\nwo had to push his arms back \nso hard that his left arm didn&#39;t dislocate, i=\r\nt almost completely \nsevered.  Hellplague bound Malice&#39;s arms, and feet, an=\r\nd grabbed his \ntail.  She pulled on his tail to get him up, which the priso=\r\nner \nnaturally refused.  Malice looked over to Organics, who was \ndesperatl=\r\ny injured.\n&gt; &#39;Don&#39;t worry, sis,&#39; he said silently,&#39; I won&#39;t be long.  They =\r\nwill \nbe sick of me before he next sunset.&#39;\n&gt; Hellplague back handed him an=\r\nd then she and Necross picked him \nup.  Splattercannon transformed into his=\r\n gunship mode and flew cover \nas Hellplague loaded her new &#39;pet&#39; onboard.  =\r\nShe decended and \ncackled madly, and insulted the Maximals.\n&gt; &quot;Thanks for t=\r\nhe new toy!  We&#39;ll come back later and finish you off \nlater!&quot;\n&gt; Malice was=\r\n able to shout over the roar of Splattercannon&#39;s \nengines, to encourage his=\r\n allies.\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;ll have to live the next day before that, minion!  I&#39;ll be =\r\n\nback before nightfall tomorrow!  Nightlight!  Tell Wolfblade and \nOrganics=\r\n, I&#39;ll come back before too long.&quot;\n&gt; Splattercannon touched off his engines=\r\n and took off, towards \nUnicron.  Necross turned and followed, as did the f=\r\new remaining \nSweeps.\n&gt; &quot;Minions, return to Unicron!  A rest before we fini=\r\nsh off these \nfools!&quot;  Hellplague shouts as she transformed into vehicle mo=\r\nde and \nwited for the others to leave.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Organics looked up and saw Mal=\r\nice being whisked away.  SHe threw \nherself from Nightlight and tried to cr=\r\nawl to Malice, but her legs \nrefused to respond, and she looked up to the s=\r\nhrinking shape that \nbore her brother.\n&gt; &quot;Come back soon, brother.&quot; she whi=\r\nspered before collapsing on the \nground,&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; OOC: Don&#39;t=\r\n worry.
