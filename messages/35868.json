Burning Hammer is in...what \nyou call a personality conflict, of what he is, and what he wants to be. \n  He proves to be no harm right now, so please leave him to be. But i \nfeel the vibrations of something moving through the ground, which is my \nterritory. Nightlight please help Burning Hammer and the rest.  Also i \nhave heard something from that Deemos that is quite upsetting. He wishes \nto kill Trinity. Keep her out of trouble. I will leave now.&quot; Grounded \nreplied and using only vibrations to tell where things were ran and dove \noutside digging into the ground in a perfevt path to intercept Stranato. \nGrounded had finally remembered all of his past, but he would worry \nabout that later.\n\nairly2000@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Nightlight::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Arrow...&quot; said with a low voice Nightlight and she shouted &quot;All it&#39;s\n&gt; ok, Arrow, don&#39;t worry...
