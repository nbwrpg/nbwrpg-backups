He got up and looked over, the last of the clones fell to thr ground. \nHe was all that was left. Taking out his gun he made a tactical withdrawl \nuntil he saw Megatron, the clone.\n    &quot;Royalty! You have come for me! Together we shall destroy these \ninvaders!&quot; He cried with enthusiasm. He began to run towrds Megatron, but \nstopped as a grenade landed right between his feet. &quot;Royalty! Look out!&quot;\n    The clone looked down at the grenade, cried out, and blew to scrap before \nthe ees of Inferno. His head landed on the ground and rolled over to \nKitkat....&quot;You......little.....bitch.....&quot;It said with its last ounce of \nenergy, and then died. The head blanked out, a rather perfect trophy.\n    &quot;No! The Queen! .....You shall pay for this!&quot; Inferno cried, took to the \nsky, and went as fast as he could fly. He saw a small being beneath him in \nthe forest and went down. Apon landing he saw it was Darkmouse...a fimiliar \nface.\n\n    &quot;Excellent. Everything is going to plan. When Inferno arrives, and \nTerrorsaur, we can begin phase two. Hahahahahahah!&quot; He bellowed sitting on \nhis Command Chair.\n    &quot;Your a freak!&quot; Adrax cried, who now resided within a steal cage \nsuspended above a pit that was rather deep. He dangled back and forth.\n    Megatron turned, &quot;Silence! Your only alive because you know the access \ncodes. Now shut up!&quot;\n\n"}}
