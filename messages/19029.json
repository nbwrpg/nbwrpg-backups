She\n&gt; managed one word to come out clearly, the rest was\n&gt; garbled. &quot;Lunarpine.....&quot;   She tried again, but the connection\n&gt; wasn&#39;t clear.  She felt a little disappointed in herself.  She wanted\n&gt; so much to try to talk through this form, but it wasn&#39;t going to\n&gt; happen.  She reached up with the arm and touched Veratis. Through the\n&gt; connection to the eyes, she could see Veratis, but only as a fuzzy\n&gt; outline of a bot.  Not a clear visual picture. She touched his arm,\n&gt; but couldn&#39;t feel it.  She could see it a little, but still had no\n&gt; feeling.  This form was not her&#39;s yet.  It was a controlled form, but\n&gt; not connected to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
