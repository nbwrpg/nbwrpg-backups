I wasn&#39;t thinking\nthat if a missle can withstand reentry temperatures it can survive her\nweapon. I guess it is a little hard to grasp. Next time I&#39;ll try to get it\nright without breaking the rules. Attack her again and I&#39;ll do better.\n\nArty staggers forward, the punch didn&#39;t do much damage but it served the\npurpose of knocking him off balance. He fired his cannons and another missle\nbut his aim was forced upward causing him to blow a hole in the ceiling and\nsending the roof down on Arty and Pacifix.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: rAuq &lt;rauq@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 5:18 PM\nSubject: Pacifix\n\n\n&gt; --- Pacifix ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Pacifix siezes the moment and tries to punch Arty in the back with\n&gt; his grey gauntlet covered hand.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
