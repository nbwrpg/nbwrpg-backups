Do me a favor and take command for an hour. I need a\nquick\n&gt; nap. Ill be in my quarters. Let Venomous in with that bot. Thanks.&quot; She\nsaid,\n&gt; very sleepily.\n&gt;     With that, she made her way into her large penthouse quarters and\ncrawled\n&gt; into her bed, in beast mode of course. Curled up tightly, she drifted to\n&gt; sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Moments passed and she was in a surreal realm, one that often haunted\n&gt; her. It was a dark place deep within the ship. She could hear him walking,\n&gt; slamming about. It scared her more than anything else in the entire\ncreation.\n&gt;     She began to run in her robot mode as fast as she could. Aracnia began\nto\n&gt; panic, she heard him stomping behinde her. It was hard to run in this\ndream,\n&gt; it might have been because it took place in a rusty old engin room filled\n&gt; with obsticles and bad lighting. Or it could have been because the fear of\n&gt; Tarantulas was absolutely terrifying.\n&gt;     He stalked her like he was the spider, which he was, and she was the\nfly,\n&gt; which she didnt like at all. He gave his hideous rhaspy cackle that made\nher\n&gt; fall onto the floor. Aracnia knew she couldnt get away now. She was as\ngood\n&gt; as his.\n&gt;     The form of Tarantulas was different in this nightmare. He was a\ngiant,\n&gt; fully amred, and totally furious. Useing his right claw he ripped apart a\n&gt; group of pipes and stood before Aracnia as the steam from the broken pipes\n&gt; whirled around his hulky body.\n&gt;     Opening her mouth to scream would do nothing, nor would useing her\nwepon.\n&gt; He was in control of this real, despite it was really her dream. Last time\n&gt; she tried to imagine herself his size, with more wepons, but it failed\n&gt; miserably.\n&gt;     &quot;Ah, I have caught you widow! Hehehehehe!&quot; He cackled, &quot;now you will\nhelp\n&gt; me or I shall plauge your mind forever!&quot; His voice boomed like thunder in\nthe\n&gt; dream.\n&gt;     &quot;Wh-what are you talking about?&quot; She stammered frantically.\n&gt;     He laughed agian, this time holding himself and stomping the floor,\nwhich\n&gt; made her fly into the air. Aracnia landed with a hard thud.\n&gt;     &quot;You will restore my body for me. If you havent guessed, when the Vok\n&gt; destroyed me ever so long ago, my conscience was transmitted here.\n&gt; Unfortunetly it was locked in your subconscience. Now that I have finally\n&gt; caught you, I have broken free. The tourture was nessecery, belive me.&quot; He\n&gt; rhasped as Aracnia shivered with fear.\n&gt;     &quot;I can now talk to you directly from your mind. But, I can not control\n&gt; you. So, if you dont do as i say I can guarentee you will never slumber\n&gt; agian! Every time you close your eyes I will be there. Do we have a deal?&quot;\nHe\n&gt; hissed.\n&gt;     &quot;Alright. Once you got your body, you leave?&quot; She said, a little more\n&gt; relived.\n&gt;     &quot;Yes. Thats the deal. My body is in peices in the storeage room. Put\nit\n&gt; together and I will be able to depart from you and go through with my own\n&gt; affiars.&quot; The spider said. It seemed he was getting smaller, now that\nAracnia\n&gt; seemed less afraid.\n&gt;     &quot;Fine. Now, let me go. You&#39;ll get what you need.&quot; SHe said, and it\nechoed\n&gt; because the spider, the room, and everything around her suddenly swirled\n&gt; around her and she was awake, sitting in bed, shakeing.\n&gt;     Aracnia had a mission. To free Tarantulas from her body. It appears\nthat\n&gt; his clone knew about him, but left him in her banks. That bastard. She was\n&gt; glad Transantulas was gone, because if he was here she would have killed\nhim.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
