He remains calm through the ordeal of being stuck d=\r\nown a hole and then replies to Perceptor.\n\n&quot;Look, I don&#39;t care who&#39;s on who=\r\n&#39;s side right now, thing is, were here and we gotta work tagether. No if&#39;s =\r\nand&#39;s or buts.  All I know is that Darkhawk&#39;s hurt and I wanna find out how=\r\n serious his injuries are. And Tucson Prime wants ta know the same thing.  =\r\nYa see, that&#39;s who we are, we look out for each other, and sometimes even o=\r\nur enemies.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime could still hear echoes resounding in the dark d=\r\nitch, and he uses his sharp hearing to try and listen for a way out.  He co=\r\nncentrates on any slight sound he may be able to pick up.  Then, his sense =\r\nof touch quickly sharpens, as he feels the hot breezes of the lava pit touc=\r\nh his hand as he felt for breezes through his fingers.  He could also hear =\r\nRodimus getting a bit frustrated.  He couldn&#39;t blame him.  It was quite the=\r\n tribulation of dealing with a blind comrade who is at the present time wit=\r\nhout his finest of sonar gear.  \n\n&quot;It&#39;s all right Rodimus, I understand thi=\r\ns is hard for you.  We never really know how lucky we are, until something =\r\nvery vital to our survival is taken away from us.  We will get out of here,=\r\n and when we do, I promise to have extensive repairs on my optic sensors an=\r\nd visual components which will indeed be permanent.  Perhaps what is done f=\r\nor me, could also be done for Perceptor.  That&#39;s if, Perceptor, you wish to=\r\n come with us.  I don&#39;t need my eyes to understand what has happened to all=\r\n of you who serve Hydras. I see a lot of talent among all of you, a talent =\r\nhe fails to see, and acknowledge with compassion.  I think this may have ha=\r\nppened for a reason.&quot;\n\nHe directs his attentions to Dark Hawk first.\n\n&quot;Dark=\r\nhawk, your tactical skills as a warrior are exceptional. I&#39;m rather impress=\r\ned with the way you nearly saw me for scrap.  Talents like that need to be =\r\nappreciated and if you were to work with me, I&#39;d deeply appreciate them.&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe then directs his attentions to Perceptor.\n\n&quot;Perceptor, your understandin=\r\ng of intel is also highly impressive.  You&#39;d be a great asset to me and in =\r\nreturn for your exceptional skills, I&#39;d offer you anything you think you ma=\r\ny need or want.  And if it&#39;s freedom you desire, then that I will gladly gi=\r\nve you. You see, everyone, Rodimus, Night Shift, Perceptor, Darkhawk, we ma=\r\ny be on different factions but we were made from the same creator.  Are we =\r\nreally that different from each other?  I don&#39;t think so.&quot;  \n\nTucson Prime =\r\ncould now see the situation as a whole even though right now he was blind. =\r\n Perceptor and Darkhawk served Hydras, an evil power hungry leader who want=\r\ned nothing but domination and destruction. And if anyone dared to fail in t=\r\nheir duties, he&#39;d shove them asside, as he had done with Perceptor and Dark=\r\n Hawk.  He felt sorry for them, and it panged at his heart spark to know th=\r\nat Hydras could be so cruel to them.  And for the first time, sensing Dark =\r\nHawk near him, he puts a gentile hand on his shoulder, rather than a clench=\r\ning painful fist around it.  \n\n&quot;What ever side you chose, it&#39;s your choice.=\r\n  We will not be angry with what you chose.  Freedom is the right of all Se=\r\nntient beings.  And I sense this is what you and Perceptor long for.  I am =\r\ngiving you what you are entitled to. Now, I sense a hot breeze but then, th=\r\nere&#39;s also a down draft that seems a bit temperate.  I&#39;m getting a fix on t=\r\nhat down draft and I&#39;m going to see if I can map it out internally and try =\r\nto get a map grid over to Rodimus and Night Shift.  If you want, Perceptor,=\r\n I can give you this grid also, but you have to allow me to do it.&quot;\n\nHe kne=\r\nels down beside Dark Hawk.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s all right, since you&#39;re injured, I&#39;ll ca=\r\nrry you with me, if you&#39;ll let me.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2=\r\n002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Of course that I&#39;ve seen that, to say =\r\nit somehow&quot;replied the blind \n&gt; predacon&quot;i was behind Hydras, maybe he coul=\r\ndnt realise the mistake that he \n&gt; had done but i did and I came to fix it;=\r\n I came here for another tunnel...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; From: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Frid=\r\nay, April 30, 2010 4:45 PM\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Th=\r\ne Light of the Flame!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who: RODIMUS PRIME, LEGACY, Tuscon, Nightshift=\r\n, Darkhawk, Perceptor,\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap, Quickstride\n&gt; &gt; Location: Black Fortre=\r\nss - Hole/chamber beneath hallway\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Why do you presume that I&#39;l=\r\nl help you?&quot;said dryly the Predacon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus cocked his head as if t=\r\nhe answer was obvious, &quot;Because you are\n&gt; &gt; stuck down here with us.&quot; Rodim=\r\nus said as he glanced back up at the\n&gt; &gt; top of the hole. &quot;You saw how your=\r\n boss fired down here a few moments\n&gt; &gt; ago.&quot; Rodimus pointed ujp with his =\r\nfree hand to show some of the\n&gt; &gt; battle scars the wall had taken. &quot;If he s=\r\ntarts firing at us like he\n&gt; &gt; did before, then he might bring the whole ro=\r\nom in on us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimus fixed his gaze on Perceptor as he grips his w=\r\neapon with both\n&gt; &gt; hands again, &quot;and no matter what you think you want to =\r\ndo, if that\n&gt; &gt; happens you will be just as dead as we are.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rodimu=\r\ns waited, his weapon still drawn and pointed at Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yaho=\r\no!
