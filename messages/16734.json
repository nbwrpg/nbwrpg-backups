He could feel his arms and legs, and \neverything was blurry. His head felt like a hundred pounds and swayed from \nside to side. He then realized that his body was being suspended from above...\n    &quot;What the hell is going on here? I demand to have an explanation.....when \nI get my hands on you-&quot; he yelled until Tarantulas settled into his dazed \nsight of vision, sending shivers down the tyrants spine.\n    The scientist cackled, &quot;What hands you you be hurting me with Megatron? \nThese?!! Hahahahahahhaha!&quot; He said, and then held up both of his large strong \narms. The spider then dropped them and showed Megatron his detached legs. All \nthe while he was laughing.\n    Megatron realized then that all that remained of him was his torso, neck, \nand head. His arms and legs had been detached and he was being suspended in a \nsmall clear tube. An internment tube.\n    &quot;Youre insane!&quot; Megatron yelled as his body swayed back and forth. He \nwasnt happy and wanted to get out. &quot;Let me see Black Aracnia, now!&quot;\n    Tarantulas dropped Megatrons limbs to the floor and walked up to the tube \nand looked at Megatron in the eyes. &quot;Youre in no position to make demands. \nGood night Grape Face.&quot; He said, turned, and exited the small chamber \ncontaining the computers that showed Megatrons stats.\n    &quot;Well....things have changed, yes.&quot; He said to himself looking around his \nnew prison.\n\n    \n\n"}}
