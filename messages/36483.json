AH!&quot; Whatever the drunk was going to say to Crossfire was cut\nshort as Arty&#39;s blasts hit him in the back, almost slamming him into the\nwall. He spins around, his back dented, growling. Running toward Arty, the\ndrunk fires two missiles at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;How much firepower can to take?&quot; he asks the shield while charging at\nArty.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Arty had just gotten free when another slab was flopped on top of him.\nHis\n&gt; &gt; servos were damaged so he couldn&#39;t find the leverage he needed to push\nit\n&gt; &gt; back off. He tried to aim his cannons knowing that he was as good as\ntrapped\n&gt; &gt; but couldn&#39;t get an angle to aim at Pacifix. His eyes saw the drunk, his\n&gt; &gt; cannons turned and aimed, the tip started to glow and Arty fired both\n&gt; &gt; barrels at full power at the drunks back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
