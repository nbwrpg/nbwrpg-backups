The poision had run its\ncourse.\n&gt; That made things a lot easier. A well heated battle he wouldn&#39;t mind, but\nhe\n&gt; needed to get back to base, and tell Megatron what he had. Also, he didn&#39;t\n&gt; have a lot of space to move around in. The trees would just get in his\nway.\n&gt; But either way, he won. He told Cheetor he could beat him. Sure, he busted\n&gt; his foot, but he won.\n&gt;\n&gt; He kicked the Maximal on the side, watched him just in case he moved. He\n&gt; then crouched and waved two the Predacon females over.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 12:48:09 MDT\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;::KitKat::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;She stopped.
