Her scanners homed in on a streak of \npink heading towards her, her mind numb at what was going on.\nBut nothing was controling her body this time, instead she felt a power \npulsating from the very core of her spark.\nThe Matrix had come to life!\nPower serged inside of her super structure, so much that it almost hurt.  \nHer hands shook, then the rest of her body followed and she nearly dropped \nher sword.\nAnd in one burst, silver flashed wings erupted from her back and stratched \nout behind her.\nThe last of the dieing sun caught a glint off of them as a red light began \nto pulse at the flat of her chest. The light began to get brighter, always \npulsating with the beating of a single spark.\nThough there was no helm, a face-plate detatched from neck armor and covered \nher mouth and nose.\nAnd in one swipe of a swords blade, the turrent sent from Megatron bounced \naway and exploded behind her.*\n\n&quot; MEGATRON!!&quot;\n\n* With ice blue eyes she glared at him. And with a voice directed by the \nMatrix itself, she spoke.*\n\n&quot; I AM ARKNESS PRIME!&quot;\n\n* Gripping the sword with both hands she raised it above her her, the tip \npulsating with a bright red light.*\n\n&quot; AND YOU WILL YEALD!!&quot;\n\n* Flipping the blade so that it pointed down, with a will of commanders \nbefore her it was stabbed into the ground. Streaks of light erupted from \ntheblade and slithered along the ground like bolts of lightening from a \nthindercloud, cascading towards Magatron. But just before reaching him they \nshot into the air in straight bars of pure energy by the Matrix&#39;s will. \nAround Megatron them sprouted, growing and reaching for the sky...the gap at \nthe brink...beginning to shrink and close.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
