Abbot and Castello meets Frankenstein\nwas said to be the best Abbot and Castello movie ever\nmade, and it ripped off alot of horror movies.  If all\nthe bots that came here were realistic this would be\npretty boring, I think it&#39;s important to be able to RP\nseriously, and in funny situations created by stupid\nideas.  Personally at one point I had considered\nhaving Mustex rape Ice, but fortunatly I got over that\nbefore my moderation ended.\n\n--- cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ll stop when they do.  But Rauq, even you have to\n&gt; admit that HNC&#39;s \n&gt; inaugural rp post wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to\n&gt; read the first \n&gt; line, let alone the whole thing.  And Lurker&#39;s\n&gt; start-up is the most \n&gt; over-dramatized entrance I&#39;ve ever seen - all you\n&gt; need is a shot of \n&gt; Dr. Frankenstein throwing a switch and it&#39;s a ripoff\n&gt; of every single \n&gt; horror movie out there.  \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s improved somewhat since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as characters are concerned, Terminion and \n&gt; Skullertron/Slaughter actually display both\n&gt; personality and \n&gt; potential.  The remaining four have been\n&gt; cannon-fodder thus far.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s my opinion and it&#39;s up to you guys to prove\n&gt; me right or wrong \n&gt; by roleplaying, not bitching.  And this is a serious\n&gt; RPG, not a \n&gt; slapstick movie, so if I see another post/exchange\n&gt; like HNC&#39;s first \n&gt; one, where everyone involved is an absolute idiot, I\n&gt; will ingore \n&gt; every post thereafter made by the perpetrator(s)\n&gt; regardless of who \n&gt; they are or think they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking around for those wondering.\n&gt; Megatron is waiting \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the control room for the Predacons, most of which\n&gt; are &#39;busy&#39; or \n&gt; &gt; something. I really don&#39;t have much to post about\n&gt; right now, but I \n&gt; &gt; still have to read the posts up till when i last\n&gt; checked em.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I guess i have to stick my nose in, cause this\n&gt; obviously aint \n&gt; &gt; getting better, it&#39;s getting worse. *raises verbal\n&gt; shields*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First think that needs to happen is a cease fire\n&gt; in this flame war \n&gt; &gt; between cardhead, lurker, and narrator. it started\n&gt; wrong right from \n&gt; &gt; the start. certain things which shouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; been said, were \n&gt; said, \n&gt; &gt; and the replies were less than sucessful at\n&gt; defusing the situation \n&gt; &gt; and it blew up. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; cardhead, if you don&#39;t like Narrator&#39;s posting\n&gt; style, that&#39;s your \n&gt; &gt; problem. Telling him that you don&#39;t like it, with\n&gt; a bunch of \n&gt; &gt; senseless slander isn&#39;t going to make him post the\n&gt; way you&#39;d like \n&gt; &gt; him to post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narrator, keep ooc comments out of your posting,\n&gt; if you want to say \n&gt; &gt; something, say it and no pot shots. And I find it\n&gt; really hard to \n&gt; &gt; believe that you managed to put &#39;piece of dog\n&gt; shit&#39; and &#39;grow up&#39; \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the same context.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone wants to grow up, then they should shut\n&gt; up about this \n&gt; &gt; stupid arguement, and get back to role playing.\n&gt; Nothing anyone can \n&gt; &gt; say now short of an appologies and &#39;I&#39;m being\n&gt; quiet&#39;, can show me \n&gt; &gt; that anyone is growing up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *preps for backlash*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
