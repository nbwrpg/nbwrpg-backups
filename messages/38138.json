He rolled to his\nfeet fireing two missles at Shivah from the first and tird claw of his left\ntalon. His right talon fired 25 shots of energy at Kali .\n\nMech fluid was slowly seeping from his frame where a combination of weapons\nhad penetrated. He had to think of a way out. A sudden surge and a voice\ncame through his head. &quot;Head northeast, theres a sinkhole near the old\nPredacon base. You can hide in there.&quot; Ignatius thought he was going insane\nhearing voices. He decided to sort his sanity out later. Quickly the bot\nleapt into the air transforming to his eagle form and flying in the\ndirection the voice had told him to go.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 11:18 PM\nSubject: Re: Kill the Trainers\n\n\n&gt; Luzbel/Kali/Attila::\n&gt;\n&gt; Luzbel shouted &quot;Brother and sister... it&#39;s time to shot!!!!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Luzbel and Attila shot against Slayer (25 x bot) while Kali shot 25\n&gt; times against Ignatius\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Ignatius dives toward the ground avoiding the optic blasts.
