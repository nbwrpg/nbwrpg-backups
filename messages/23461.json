He admired the way Prebon \nhandled his troops. Slayer looks back at Probon and nods, then sits \ndown.\n\n&quot;I was retreating, Master,&quot; he explains, &quot;When the wolf attacked me. \nWe fought the battle to a duel, but I lost too much fuel, and \nobvioustly went into stasis on my way back to base.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Bullet snorted at Slayer &quot;It was Prebons orders to have you \nstay...&quot; The\n&gt; bull was interupted by a stern voice from behind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My orders were to stay put and rest Slayer, and Bullet?

He turned and departed leaving Slayer and \nPrebon\n&gt; alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon took his gaze off the departing bull and turned his \nattention to\n&gt; Slayer. &quot;Sit down Slayer, we have much to discuss. Lets start with \nan\n&gt; explanation on why you didn&#39;t follow my order to retreat, and what \nhappened\n&gt; to you since.&quot; He leaned back against the wall and awaited an \nexplanation.\n\n\n"}}
