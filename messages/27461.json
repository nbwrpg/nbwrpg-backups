He presses one more button, and both him and \n&gt; Fliq are edjected into the air, hundreds of feet from the CF.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Maximals, DROP DOWN, NOW!!!&quot; he yells into his comm on an encoded \n&gt; frequency, hoping that the Maximals will heed his warning. A second \n&gt; later, the shuttle, going over 400 miles per hour, clears the top \nof \n&gt; the Cybertronian Fire, smashing into the ground two dozen feet \nbehind \n&gt; Vehement and his minions. The shuttle digs several feet into the \n&gt; ground upon impact, the self destruct sequence that Grimmler had \n&gt; activated not having any time to activate. But that wasn&#39;t \n&gt; neccessary. Every fuel tank in the shuttle is smashed open, coming \n&gt; into contact with energy and exploding in a huge inferno. Rocks, \n&gt; dirt, and metal fly in all directions, the blast radius of the \n&gt; explosion being about 30 feet.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Kluster drops to the ground at Grimmler&#39;s warning, the shuttle \n&gt; exploding behind Vehement seconds later. He feels shuttle pieces \n&gt; flying over his head, smashing into the shields of the Cybertronian \n&gt; Fire (IR or Tav, please post damage). Dirt and rocks shower over \nhim, \n&gt; but the metal plates are launched from the shuttle too fast to hit \n&gt; anyone who is laying down. He opens his eyes, realizing it was \n&gt; impossible to see through all the ash.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler smiles, watching the huge explosion. His jetpack \npropelling \n&gt; him toward the Cybertronian Fire, he fires his rifle randomly at \n&gt; where he last saw the enemies. Several shuttle pieces fly past him. \n&gt; Grimmler dodges one and looking ahead. His eyes narrow as he sees \n&gt; another plate heading for him, but there wasn&#39;t time to dodge. The \n&gt; plate smashes into Grimmler, the impact instantly putting him into \n&gt; stasis lock and launching him down toward the ground, his jetpack \n&gt; exploding on his back.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Fliq lands safely on the ground, looking up to see Grimmler&#39;s \njetpack \n&gt; explode. He transforms into robot mode, running to catch the fellow \n&gt; Maximal.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (First you say it&#39;s not in your chest, then it is.

A bright flash emitted from \nthe \n&gt; camera, \n&gt; &gt; the flash designed to temporarily disable optic sensors, the \nflash \n&gt; heading \n&gt; &gt; for the Maximals present.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vehement&#39;s face contorted into a smile, the robot doing a flip \n&gt; backwards and \n&gt; &gt; transforming into the shape of a sword.  The sword hovered for \nthe \n&gt; briefest \n&gt; &gt; of seconds, not affected by the flash, same as Sun Crusher.  The \n&gt; tip of the \n&gt; &gt; nine foot long broadsword began to glow a dark emerald.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A bolt lanced out form the tip of the blade, extending into a \nfifty \n&gt; by fifty \n&gt; &gt; radius, the middle of the blast pointed at Iron Raptor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Control returned to Vehement, who instantly felt more drained \nthen \n&gt; he ever \n&gt; &gt; had, scanners telling him he had lost 80% of all his power in \nthat \n&gt; single ye \n&gt; &gt; powerful blast.  He transformed back to robot mode, feeling but \nnot \n&gt; showing \n&gt; &gt; his weakness.\n\n\n"}}
