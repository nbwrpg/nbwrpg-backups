In several \nseconds, they were approaching 400mph. He sees Shadow Cat and Snow \nTech up ahead, and in two seconds him and Iron Raptor were past the \ntwo cats, leaving them far behind. \n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor shook her head at her friends and their antics, \nwondering if \n&gt; she could ever admit to the Maqximals that those two just happened \nto be her \n&gt; freinds.\n&gt; But enough was enough about staying here while there was a battle \nback at \n&gt; base and giant machines coming this way bent on killing them.\n&gt; Looking at Snow Tech and Shadow Cat as they moved off towards the \nbase.\n&gt; &lt; Yes...they are.&gt; she answered Prowl, even though she had sensed \nthat the \n&gt; thought hadn&#39;t been directed to her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor looked down at the curled little fuzz ball in her \nhands, simply \n&gt; them bringing him to the flat of her chest so that she had no \npossibility of \n&gt; droping him on the way to the battle. Looking up at Prowl as he \ntightens his \n&gt; hold on her, knowing that it was time to leave.\n&gt; Returning the kiss he gave her as she felt her feet leave the \nground, \n&gt; holding the piff ball to her a little more tightly.\n&gt; &lt; We had better, slag knows what&#39;s going on at the Cybertronian \nFire.&gt;\n&gt; Iron Raptor squished herself against Prowl a little more, just not \nliking \n&gt; the idea of going fast...even though they had to.\n&gt; But then a concern poped into her head. The little guy she held in \nher hands \n&gt; couldn&#39;t be in battle, but she couldn&#39;t just let him go.\n&gt; She sighed, then looked down at him.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; When we land, there is a compartment in my back armor, get into \nthat, \n&gt; alright? And stay there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * She then looked at Prowl.* &lt; When we get to the CF, just drop me, \nI can \n&gt; land on my feet. I want to get into the fighting and get it over \nwith as \n&gt; quick as I can.
