Its 12:17 am and I am in a very very bad mood.\n\nI had lots of arguments about this US VS Canada thing but I don&#39;t want to further this flame war, so I&#39;ll keep them to myself. The next person to post a pointless OOC will get severely punished, I am not kidding. If you want OOC, go to the damn message board. I made it for a reason.\n\n::Zardus::\n\nZardus nods, walking into the Iron Fist and heading for the conference room. &quot;I&#39;ll show the status once we&#39;re in the conference room. Its easier with the aid of hologram projectors.&quot;\n\nWhile he walks, his comm answers a few messages, though none were heard externally. &quot;Yes, you may, Punch,&quot; he replies to Punch and then goes on to reply to Dark One.\n\n&quot;Judging from your performance in the last battle, a raise that generous isn&#39;t really in order right now. However, I will raise it by 40 kilograms, and maybe more if your team improves. Your payment right now will be waiting for you in storage room 7. You may use Lab 8 in the Iron Fist for upgrades.&quot;\n\nWith that he enters the conference room, sitting down and motioning for Daemos to do the same.\n\n\n"}}
