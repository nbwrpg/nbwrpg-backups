None of them turned to be Predacons, which meant that he could \njoin in on this battle after all.\nHe didn&#39;t really want to turn on the factor which he was using at the \nmoment, but as soon as he spotted a proper Pred unit, he would leave this \nplace.\nShesta came up behind Vlad and yipped, eager to try and knock someone down \nwhile Vlad acted quickly and slit their throat. Like so many turns he had \ndone in the past.\nAs it was, he alwats got what he wanted. And if it was a bots hide, he got \nit!\nVlad looked on and finally decided on just who would be the one he could \ntest his skill: Prebon!\nHe moved a little towards him but knew better then to get too close, \nthinking that he would rather test this robots&#39; abilities first and rate his \npower. To see just what sort of weapons he would need to take him down.\nVlad removed a phaser from his arm, it swinging up and into his palm from \nthe underside of his wrist.\nWith the gun right in place his fingers closed around the handle and another \nsqueezed the trigger, aiming towards Prebons shoulder.**\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
