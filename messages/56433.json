His \nskills as a flyer would be used to their potential.\n&gt; \n&gt; He listens to Kaiser and decides to comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkangel: He&#39;s right. The Preds will fight and destroy themselves \nfrom within if allowed too. He&#39;s also right about Hydras&#39; strength. \nWhen I observed the battle between the Maximals and Predacons, I saw \nRodimus Prime eventually engage Hydras in hand to hand combat. \nHydras&#39; form makes him very durible. It&#39;s hard to hurt him without \nharming yourself. Rodimus was able to sevearly wound Hydras but not \nwithout sustaining major damage himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kaiser::\n&gt;        He nods slowly listening to Tyrael&#39;s plan.  &quot;I am suitably \nimpressed ... though you&#39;re lacking a few critical details and suffer \nfrom a flawed assumption.&quot;  He walks to the table and sits down with \nhis back to the door to seem less threatening.  &quot;First off, although \nthe Predacons might be temporarily confused by Hydras&#39; death, it \nwouldn&#39;t stop them for long.  Someone would fill the vacuum quickly \nenough.&quot;  He stops and thinks to himself for a moment.  &quot;Yes, here&#39;s \nwhat we should do.  Go in, kill Hydras, making absolutely certain he \nis dead.  Then we pull back almost immediately.  That way, once they \nhave time to calm down a bit their command structure will truly \ndestabilize.  In an emergency they&#39;ll fight their enemy... Without an \nenemy they&#39;ll fight themselves.  That is when we move in for the \nkill.&quot;  He smiles proud of himself.\n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Now then, killing Hydras will be no easy task.  Few could \ntake him on, one on one, and live.  It is therefore my recommendation \nthat you, Tyrael, and the Dragoon, team up to eliminate him while the \nrest of us provide cover from his followers.&quot;  He looks up at Tyrael \nfor his opinion.  &quot;Well?&quot; \n\n\n"}}
