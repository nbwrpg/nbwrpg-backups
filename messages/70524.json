Was Vestige a part of Rodimus? =\r\n Every time Rodimus sounded in dispair, Vestige went off line.  And each ti=\r\nme the insects got closser, his power would diminish to the point where he =\r\nfalls lifeless.  He makes connections. Vestige had the same colors as Rodim=\r\nus.  Was this perhaps his inner soul helpless in his arms?  \n\n&quot; Don&#39;t worry=\r\n my friend. Even in darkness there is light.  And what if I were to physica=\r\nlly brighten things up a bit?  These arachnids don&#39;t seem to like the light=\r\n do they?  I wonder...&quot;\n\nHe now turns on his high beams to luminate the are=\r\na, attempting to see if light was one of the insects weak spots.  He keeps =\r\nit on as he walks forward, hoping to find Rodimus.\n\n&quot; Time to play the Exte=\r\nrminator.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson had no time to be alarmed. He is quick to kneel dow=\r\nn to Vestige, and picks him up gently. He was not about to leave him behind=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;They&#39;re comming, Vestige, hold on, we may not be able to escape =\r\nthe horde, but we can lose them long enough to get our bearings.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nucson takes his chances and prepares to get off the rail car, hoping to at =\r\nleast get Vestige to a safe place, even if it were just for a few moments, =\r\nto assemble a reasonable strategy to get rid of the horde, perhaps even van=\r\nquish them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;There has to be some way to stop them. Everything has =\r\na weakness, it&#39;s just a matter of finding it. No radar, no sonar, looks lik=\r\ne my eyes will have to do.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vesige stirred again as Tuscon talked,=\r\n his voice was weak as he spoke,\n&gt; &quot;They are trying to corrupt this world.&quot;=\r\n He paused as if trying to\n&gt; dredge up enough energy to continue speaking, =\r\n&quot;When they arrived\n&gt; everything . . . . changed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as Vestige talk=\r\ned the car slid into a dark tunnel the buzzing\n&gt; outside could be heard sti=\r\nll getting louder as the insects tried to\n&gt; follow the car inside, although=\r\n the width of the tunnel was slowing\n&gt; them down a little.\n&gt; \n&gt; The car pul=\r\nled into a dimly lit station and the magnacar door slid\n&gt; open to display a=\r\nn empty platform. The platform was pretty standard as\n&gt; platforms go, gun m=\r\netal grey walls, steel beams acting as pillars were\n&gt; positioned evenly at =\r\ndifferent parts of the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;TUSCON!&quot; came Rodimus&#39; voice. &quot;WHERE ARE=\r\n YOU TUSCON, I CAN&#39;T SEE YOU!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It echoed throught the station.
