She was \n&gt; trapped under the rubble from the maximal base. She couldn&#39;t move and \n&gt; her air for her systems was getting thin. She started pounding on \n&gt; parts of the collapsed ceiling, She yelled and screamed. Then she \n&gt; heard a voice on her commlink. It was megatron. &quot;You served me well \n&gt; KitKat, but you will be remembered as dying well in battle. Farwell \n&gt; KitKat.&quot;  and the link went dead.  She screamed and pounded on the \n&gt; ceiling. &quot;YOU SLAGGING PIECES OF RUSTED SCRAP METAL, HOW DARE YOU \n&gt; LEAVE ME TO DIE DOWN HERE, I&#39;LL COME BACK AND KILL YOU SO HELP ME I \n&gt; WILL!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Her words could be heard outside the chamber as she kicked and \n&gt; screamed. \n&gt; \n&gt; She pounded her fist againt the wall of the chamber, when the ringing \n&gt; of the metal being pounded woke her up. She looked around to see \n&gt; herself in a cr chamber. She relaxed and wondered how she ended up \n&gt; here.  She gently knocked from the inside of the chamber. &quot;Hello? \n&gt; anyone out there? Can I get out now?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
