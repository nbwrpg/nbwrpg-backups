It must be an Autobot trick. &quot;NO, we follow\n&gt; &gt; them. I want to know what they&#39;re after.&quot; Just then though, the ship\n&gt; &gt; began to sputter, as it was gaining speed being sucked in. \n&gt; Slugslinger\n&gt; &gt; and Apeface&#39;s eyes were begining to cloud over, as they were losing\n&gt; &gt; balance.

He looked at his other crewmates, his look as\n&gt; alarmed as their own. He joined Spinister at the window.
