They were much smaller than the gestalt, and the shots that he was \nfiring were easy to avoid. They all returned fire after taking some minor \nhits. Mist fired three charges down at Abominus&#39;s head, Aqua two explosive \nspears at Abominus&#39;s abdomen, Rubble two missiles at his chest, and Cinder \nthree plasma shots at the gestalt&#39;s optics. Mist saw Galaxor slashing a \nsword down at Abominus&#39;s head from behind and backed up in case something \nexploded.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
