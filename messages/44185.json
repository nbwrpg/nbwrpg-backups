Mutate had never been especially fast in the air (he \nwas even slower on the ground until Rhesus fixed his legs). He could \nprobably lure this guy in close and send out a wave of energy, and \nthat might even finish him. Still, before that had almost fried \nRampage AND Silverbolt (he wouldn&#39;t know Rampage was immortal). He \nflew at the fastest speed he could manage around Megatron and aimed \nat his jet pack hoping to gain the airial advantage by grounding his \nopponent. He pulled the trigger and a bolt went at Megatron.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The stun pistol slammed into Megatron shaking him slightly, and he\n&gt; seemed to have problems moving his fusion cannon arm. Through the \nraging\n&gt; red eyes he looked at the Mutate, and began to hoover towards him, \nhis\n&gt; functioning hand gripped tightly. &quot;I will rend your horrid body \nwith my\n&gt; bare hands.&quot; He whispered.\n\n\n"}}
