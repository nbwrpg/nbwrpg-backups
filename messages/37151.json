He ducked down, firing \noff five rapid optic blasts at Megatron&#39;s left knee joint, and two blasts \nfrom the rifle he held in his right hand at Firestrike&#39;s abdomen.\n\n&quot;Now I am sure you an impostor.  The real Megatron would not have called for \nhis cronies, even if he were losing!  He had to much pride!&quot;  Still in a \ncrouched position and ready to spring his left hand shot out and with a \nmagnetic attraction, the now deactivated energy blade&#39;s hilt flew into his \nleft hand, a fist now surrounding the hilt as the pink glow of deadly energy \nextended from it for a few feet.\n\n&quot;I will kill all the tw--&quot; Unitron began but stopped, seeing the third robot, \nNightstrike come into view.  He kept his comm. open, just in case he needed \nto call for reinforcements.\n\n"}}
