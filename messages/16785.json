It may come in a second time \nlater, but its better than not coming in at all.\n\n::Zardus/Oblitertron::\n\nOblitertron growls at Dark Lavatron, raising his weapon, about to \nopen fire. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Zardus motioning \nfor him to back off. Reluctantly, Dark One takes a step back, \nwatching Zardus fly forward.\n\nOblitertron had been looking forward to killing these puny bots, \nmaybe battle would still be possible....\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nZardus looks at Lavatron, thinking the offer over. Bots like these \ncould be an asset, yesss...\n\n&quot;What kind of alliance do you have in mind?&quot; Zardus asks mindly, his \nweapon ready just in case, &quot;You joining us?&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n"}}
