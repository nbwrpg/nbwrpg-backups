This was not the\nfirst time he felt Hydras was not acting in the manner his instincts\nwere telling him Megatron would have acted, but that feeling was\nbecoming more pronounced as he watched the display of this Megatron X. \n\nWith a growl he put that aside as he returned his hard gaze to the\nDecepticon before him, &quot;What is your answer intruder, stand before\nHydras or fall beneath our firepower?!&quot;\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n--- Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Myrmidon watched the display of Megatron with a cold expression,\n&gt; crimson optics unflinching. \n&gt; \n&gt; However inside things were much different. A cecophony of thoughts\n&gt; and\n&gt; memories flooded his consciousness as he watched, the name Megatron\n&gt; floating amongst the wave. A constant litanty, part statement part\n&gt; question, &quot;Megatron, who is the true Megaton.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was as if somthing in his programing was attempting to emerge.  It\n&gt; reminded him of how he felt when he first emerged here, and that\n&gt; drive\n&gt; to find Megatron, but more pronounced. When he heard from Hydras in\n&gt; the\n&gt; begining he thought his duty was answered, and yet now perhaps there\n&gt; was doubt. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was as if there was something he was suppose to do or remember,\n&gt; but\n&gt; he could not . . . yet!\n&gt; \n&gt; With a shake of his head he cleared his thoughts as the image of\n&gt; Megatron faded. In frustration and a desire to cover his distraction\n&gt; he\n&gt; grunted and spoke over his radio, &quot;Hydras, you had better if get out\n&gt; here if you wish to resolve this as you had hoped!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Myrmidon)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Robert Riley &lt;chiyohakuryuu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Malice:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dodging Trelos while hovering in vehicle mode was in no way easy. \n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; recieved signifigant scratches to his ventral heatshielding, but in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; few minutes it would be repaired.  In the meantime he transformed\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; focused his attention to Myrmidon.  A small panel on his chest\n&gt; opened\n&gt; &gt; and a communication holo emitter.  He made contact with Megatron\n&gt; via\n&gt; &gt; internal radio, and the image of the large and powerful Megatron X\n&gt; &gt; stood before Myrmidon.  Body very different, but his head and faced\n&gt; &gt; almost unchanged, save for a youthful countance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;*Hmm?  WHo are these creatures?  They look like slag in a slag\n&gt; heap.\n&gt; &gt;  Ah, I see now, they cower under that Hydras, huh?  Hmpt!  Pitiful\n&gt; &gt; excuses for Decepticons.  They can&#39;t conquer Prehistory Earth, what\n&gt; &gt; would make them suitable to follow me?*&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know, they talk an awful lot.  Maybe you should give thema\n&gt; &gt; chance?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;*YOU give them a second chance.
