The only thing for miles around \nis the ocean. I don&#39;t think waves offer too good a protection.\n\nAlso, please don&#39;t post damage for my ship. It&#39;ll take alot more than \nwhat you&#39;re firing right now to weaken the shields to any really \nnoticable. Remember, it took 30 Alliance bots over a week (real time) \nof battle to take down the Cybertronian Fire&#39;s shields, and the Iron \nFist is stronger than the Cybertronian Fire.\n\nOne last thing, please post for my Lavacons attacking your troops.\n\n::Zardus/Havoc/Astral/Fenox/Starlight/Griplash/Recklessa/Slayer::\n\nThe shots fired by the Trainers hit the shields, Zardus laughing. He \nloved this Predacon technology. Zardus fires back at Prebon with \nthree shots from his plasma launcher.\n\n&quot;Yes, it appears the Mighty Zardus has,&quot; he says, &quot;Although I&#39;d be \ninterested to know why you are attacking my base.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer and Recklessa plunge into the water, both trying to get at \neach other. The underwater defences of the Iron Fist begin to \nactivate.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHavoc smiles as the shots from Bullet&#39;s disruptor are intercepted by \nthe shields. The shields let things out, but they didn&#39;t let them in.\n\nHavoc fires two missiles at Bullet, still laughing.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Lavacons continue to fire at the Trainers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OK Yanshosh, since theres already been posts involving cover I&#39;ll \nsay\n&gt; limited cover. As for distance, they&#39;re supposedly a superior race \nthree\n&gt; miles is nothing to thier main weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bullet looks up, seeing havok, The missles head toward him faster \nthan he\n&gt; can react. Suddenly the missles explode in mid air as a burst of \nenergy\n&gt; strikes them down. Blaze stands, disruptor in hand awaiting further \nattacks.\n&gt; She aims at Hovok firing three shots from her disruptor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignatius joins Slayer in his attempts to bring down Wheeljack. he \nfires his\n&gt; eyebeams at the Alliance bot, and two missles at the shields \ncovering the\n&gt; power unit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hammer rises again and fires an energy beam across the battlefield, \nmoving\n&gt; back and forth at Sharpedge and Godfather.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re taking abuse here&quot; Hammer calls out. With the limited cover \nhe didn&#39;t\n&gt; feel such a small unit could be much effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon believed differently though as he continued to push for \nadvancement,\n&gt; the disruptorblasts were doing thier job and weakening the shields \nbut it\n&gt; still wasn&#39;t fast enough. &quot;Continue the advance, so far theres been \nlittle\n&gt; resistance, as long as they can&#39;t call for reinforcements we have \nthe upper\n&gt; hand.&quot; Prebons inspirational words pushed the Trainers forward with \nthe need\n&gt; for success or deleation. Failure was not a possability or an \noption.\n\n\n"}}
