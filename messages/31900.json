I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; hope you&#39;re considering joining us.  Both of you.\n&gt; Although\n&gt; &gt; it may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; be a bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; dull for you Angel Prime.  We don&#39;t get many attacks way\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; And we\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#39;t equipped to attack anyone.  But we could really\n&gt; use the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; help.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;  We need\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; to get some shields on this base.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Obfucious::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     Still standing outside the base, &quot;Sirs I&#39;ve been\n&gt; thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.  I think I can develop a different type of\n&gt; &gt; shielding for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; the base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; It wouldn&#39;t be the best but it might work.  First we&#39;d\n&gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; typical\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; force\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; type shielding for use against missiles, lasers,\n&gt; etceteras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Second\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; a type of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; back up shielding.  It wouldn&#39;t affect incoming attacks\n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; affect\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the incoming attackers.  A typical shield system uses a\n&gt; &gt; bubble of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; force to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; stop attacks. But deflecting them takes energy and they\n&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; brought down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I propose focusing energon in such a way that it creates a\n&gt; &gt; bubble\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; energon field around the base.  This would prevent bots\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;  Unfortunately the instability would mean we couldn&#39;t get\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; they&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; up.  We would have to attack from well within the bubble\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; prevent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; stasis\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; lock.  Our shots will still be able to pass through the\n&gt; &gt; shielding\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; but theirs\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; would not.  And the energon shields would last until the\n&gt; energon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; power source\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ran out.  It wouldn&#39;t last more than a day or two but\n&gt; that would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; enough to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; repair and get back to battle.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Next for weapon systems we&#39;ll need automated turrets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Mounted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; mountain side and around the base.  I&#39;d also like a mine\n&gt; field\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; but that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be necessary.  Maybe some more primitive traps,\n&gt; &gt; like the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; hole we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; one step to the right of, or the logs.  They&#39;re primitive\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; effective.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;The shielding I can modify and repair from spare\n&gt; parts\n&gt; &gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; base but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t think I can make turrets from anything in there.\n&gt; I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; least\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; one example and some spare parts to build more with.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; ::Aerotaur::\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;I think it&#39;s time we visit the Maximals again\n&gt; Windlord.\n&gt; &gt;  They\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; owe us a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; favor or two.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
