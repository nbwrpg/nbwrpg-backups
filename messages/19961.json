This\n&gt; was better than he had imagined. With a whole new group, especially\n&gt; one with a gestalt, the Alliance could become quite alot stronger..\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replies over the comm-link, &quot;We can talk more about the\n&gt; terms later, after the battle. Be careful if you&#39;re coming here.\n&gt; There&#39;s a battle and the shields are up. I&#39;ll set the defences to not\n&gt; fire on you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus looks around, realizing that there were quite alot of bots\n&gt; firing at Koj and Inu, something that wasn&#39;t really neccessary. He\n&gt; taps a few buttons, putting the Mafia on friend for now.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alliance bots,&quot; he says into his comm-link, &quot;The Mafia is coming\n&gt; here, don&#39;t fire at them. They seemed to have changed their minds\n&gt; from war to peace.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He walks over to Squizzy, firing a few more shots at Koj. &quot;Is the lab\n&gt; ready for the base to be moved?
