They&#39;de won. But now it was up to her to deal \nwith this.\nOr at least do as much as she could.\nIron Raptor thought of opening a commm to the Maximals coming home but \nthey&#39;de already saved the day. It was her turn now.\nShe looked at Histeria.*\n\n&quot; Make sure the shuttles get in safely and please put the shield up. Might \nsave us some repair.&quot;\n\n* She leaned down and set the little kitten on the floor, looking down at \nhim.*\n\n&quot; You can help her to, little guy.&quot;\n\n* And with that she turned away from the controle center and walked out of \nthe room, her helm covering her face so that, once again, the BlackKnight \nwas back.\nIron Raptor walked quickly enough so that it was only a few moments before \nshe exited the CF, sword in hand and her shield ready to extend and obsorb \ncharge energy.\nCape flapping in the wind, she looked at the three enemies that stood out on \nthe battlefirled. There were the men who were causing the trouble?\nShe looked at each before sliding her sword back into it&#39;s hold, looking \nthem over.\nThese 3 could easily be defeated, but they should at least know what they \nwere up against.*\n\n&quot; Stop firing! We have no fight with you! Get lost!&quot;\n\n* She just stood there, an obviously east target.\nIron wasn&#39;t going to fight until she was forced to. And the base wouldn&#39;t \nfire, since all she&#39;de said was to activate what was left of the shields.\nSo these men were left up to her and Kluster right now( it think he&#39;s on the \nfield anyway, if not then just omit that past. :) )*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
