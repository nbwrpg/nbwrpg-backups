Turning to \nsee the grenades, he jumped to the side, doing a cartwheel as the grenades \nexplode.  He lifts his left arm, blocking all the shrapnel and laughing.\n\n---\n\nDark Claw fired off two more missiles from his attack vehicle mode at the \nMafia base.  He would put the squeeze on that pathetic base.\n\n---\n\nFlesh Ripper caught the missiles in his chest plate, a deep gash visible in \nhis chest.\nPutting away the rifle, he clasped his hands together, slowly pulling them \napart.  He stopped when they were a foot away from each other.  In between, \nwas a blue sphere of destructive energy.\n\nUsing one hand, Flesh Ripper threw the energy up at Sharpedge.  It would have \nthe effect of a charge.\n\n---\n\nChaos fired ten rapid shots from his rifle up at Jetstorm.\n\n---\n\nMinion fired off ten rapid optic blasts at Jetstorm.\n\n---\n\nSixshot, making another pass, fired off two missiles down at the Mafia base.\n\n"}}
