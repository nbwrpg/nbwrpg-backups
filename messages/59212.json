After \nbeing on a fringe world out post the entire Great War, he was able to \ntravel and stay on Cybertron.  He was there for the Great Upgrade, \nwhen he met a femme named Organics.  Both were working at the same \nprison, both wardens, so they developed a bond that went beyond \nprofessional.  For reasons unknown, Organics disappeared suddenly, \nleaving Neutronics in agony.  He then became restless and became a \nbounty hunter, upgrading his power effecentcy close to Devcon, the \ngreat Autobot bounty hunter.  After years spent in such life he \nchanged his name and alt. form for something more suitable.  Malice \nspends time now hunting a bounty, working on his swords or rifle.  Or \npracticing his hunting skills, becoming a ruthless hunter.\n\n\n"}}
