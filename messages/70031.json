Rat Trap and Quickstride buckle in=\r\n, to anticipate the major kick back Tucson&#39;s missile launchers may have. Th=\r\nen, Tucson fires, as they kick back, causing him to lurch backward slightly=\r\n as he gets used to firing them at the same time.\n\n  &quot;Ughh, felt that.. Are=\r\n you two okay?&quot;\n\n  Rat Trap is now on top of Quickstride, who is now lookin=\r\ng to the control pannel.\n\n  &quot;Umm, we&#39;re - okay.. Just a little - bit shell =\r\nshocked.

That&#39;s the fire =\r\nI need to rekindle.&quot;\n\n  Rat Trap gasps as does Quickstride.\n\n  &quot;But Wheels,=\r\n that might that might do a number on ya.&quot;\n\n  Tuscon sighs.\n\n  &quot; I know Rat=\r\n Trap, it will. I&#39;ll still be a Prime no matter what happens, but if all go=\r\nes well, we will get Rodimus back and Cyclonus will pay for his deeds again=\r\nst Primus. It&#39;s worth the risk my friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;\n\n  Rat Tra=\r\np sheds a tear.\n\n  &quot;But but what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do with=\r\nout ya? What am I gonna do without ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real friend =\r\nI ever did have. I don&#39;t wanna lose ya.&quot;\n\n  Tucson could feel a tear drip o=\r\nn his dashboard. \n\n  &quot; I promise you Rat Trap, neither Talon or you is goin=\r\ng to lose me that easilly. I may be out of commission for a few days, but i=\r\nt&#39;s not going to kill me. Remember when we talked about the most powerful f=\r\norce in the universe? How nothing could ever surpass that?&quot;\n\n  Rat Trap nod=\r\nds.\n\n  &quot; I think so. Ya told me that love is a force no one can reckon with=\r\n. Nothing breaks the bond of friendship no matter how powerful evil becomes=\r\n. Love knows no boundaries and is the only infinite force that keeps on liv=\r\ning even when one has passed on long ago.&quot;\n\n  Tucson gently straps Rat Trap=\r\n in more securely.\n\n  &quot;That&#39;s right Rat Trap. Remember that. It&#39;s our bond =\r\nas friends that can never be broken. All of us, including Talon, Elita, Kup=\r\n, Lord Elder, Depthcharge, Lord Perseus, Legacy, Guardia, and Ravenchief ha=\r\nve the power within ourselves not because of tyranical strength, but becaus=\r\ne of that one thing that neither Hydras, Megatron or Galvatron ever had. An=\r\nd that was True Love. They rule with force, not with compassion. Our heart =\r\nis what is going to win us this battle, our hearts are going to come togeth=\r\ner as one and we will save those that need to be saved, and rekindle the li=\r\nghts that have nearly been blown out.&quot;\n\n  He starts up his engines.\n\n  &quot; NO=\r\nW, LET&#39;S DO THIS!

It&#39;s=\r\n worth the risk my \n  friends, it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap sheds =\r\na tear.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;But but \n  what if it kills ya? What&#39;s Talon gonna do witho=\r\nut ya? What am I gonna do \n  without ya? Wheels, you&#39;re the only real frien=\r\nd I ever did have. I don&#39;t wanna \n  lose ya.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson could feel a te=\r\nar drip on his dashboard. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I \n  promise you Rat Trap, neither Talo=\r\nn or you is going to lose me that easilly. I \n  may be out of commission fo=\r\nr a few days, but it&#39;s not going to kill me. \n  Remember when we talked abo=\r\nut the most powerful force in the universe? How \n  nothing could ever surpa=\r\nss that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rat Trap nodds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; I think so. \n  Ya told me that lo=\r\nve is a force no one can reckon with. Nothing breaks the \n  bond of friends=\r\nhip no matter how powerful evil becomes. Love knows no \n  boundaries and is=\r\n the only infinite force that keeps on living even when one \n  has passed o=\r\nn long ago.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tucson gently straps Rat Trap in more \n  securely.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right Rat Trap. Remember that. It&#39;s our bond as \n  friends that =\r\ncan never be broken. All of us, including Talon, Elita, Kup, Lord \n  Elder,=\r\n Depthcharge, Lord Perseus, Legacy, Guardia, and Ravenchief have the \n  pow=\r\ner within ourselves not because of tyranical strength, but because of that =\r\n\n  one thing that neither Hydras, Megatron or Galvatron ever had. And that =\r\nwas \n  True Love. They rule with force, not with compassion. Our heart is w=\r\nhat is \n  going to win us this battle, our hearts are going to come togethe=\r\nr as one and \n  we will save those that need to be saved, and rekindle the =\r\nlights that have \n  nearly been blown out.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He starts up his engines=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; NOW, LET&#39;S \n  DO THIS!
