The Maximals have a new base! And the Ark!\n\n::: He slams his fists down, and hopes Rat Trap is doing his mission. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Rat Trap makes his way to the ark, injured from a brutal beating from \nHell Beast. He still hadnt figured out why. but for now he was free of the \nPredacons and ready to be come a Maximal. From what he saw, the Ark was crap, \nbut the new cruiser looked excellent. Rat Trap, now changed from Predacon to \nMaximal, sent a distress signal to the Maximals. He was dying, and he needed \nhelp. The Predacons turned there backs on him, and he needed a good home. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Inferno and Jackle watch the Maximal cruiser with great curiosity. They \nsaw it set down, and make contact. But did Hell Beast know about it? :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: The Royalty will be very displeased! We should burn this new \ncolony to the ground!\n\n::: Jackle ::: Its not that simple. That ship is new, a virgin to this war. \nWe might take a few cracks at it, but besides that...look, theres Rat Trap!\n\n::: Inferno ::: Traitor! He will burn!\n\n::: Jackle ::: Leave him, Hell Beast beat the crap out of him, hes a goner. \nLets go.\n\n::: The two Predacons make there way home when they discover Gangon. Inferno \nbends down to help him. :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: We will take you home to the colony!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Megatron curls his lips at the new Maximal base. Ra and Waspinator stood \nbehinde him as they watched it from the cover of bushes. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: This war is getting ridiculos! I say we up the odds a bit, \nyes.\n\n::: Ra ::: What did you have in mind?\n\n::: Megatron ::: I do belive a trip to the Ark is in order. Ha ha ha!\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Ominus Prime and Set stare at the consol with the new Maxi base. They \ndidnt like it, but at least it was a new target. :::\n\n"}}
