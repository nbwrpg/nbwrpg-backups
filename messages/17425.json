He felt some sort of loyalty toward Ceratis that made him want to\nreject the cloaking device and fight straight up. If Striker was still under\nenemy influence the devices were a waste of time to begin with.

(How many cloaked bots are going into battle?) The\nscents of thier friends were all around them .
