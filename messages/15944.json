Burning Hammer wondered\nwhat it would be like to fight Dinobot...\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Carnage darkness&quot; &lt;carnage_blood@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, September 22, 2000 10:56 PM\nSubject: I Need Not Your Concern.\n\n\n\n\n( Carnage: Code, settle down! If it is THAT important to you then send me\nthe posts of your characters firing towards Dinobot that I&#39;ve obviously\nmissed and I&#39;ll make sure he gets hit? Will THAT suit you enough?!\nNow, either drop it or send me the damn posts.)\n\n* Dinobot watched out over the battlefield, not even believing his own\noptics at what he saw.\nNothing, absolutely nothing that was part of this small clearing even\nresembled the glade Tavatron and himself had stopped in a while back.\nThe grass beneath their feet was churned up and now nothing but raw dirt and\nsmall sprigs of green poking up in the occasional place, the waterfall was\nnow nothing more then a trickle emerging from crunched and fallen rock, the\nstream itself simply a drying bed of small pebbles and dirt.\nI was all gone, every square inch of it.\nA deep growl emanated from between his tightly clenched jaw, his hands\nballed into fists with the deadly claws of his fingers digging through each\npalm.\nYet, that only added to the pain he felt, and soon released his palms from\nthe slow torture of his claws as they dug deeper and deeper with every spark\nbeat.\nThis entire place was gone, and he couldn&#39;t even say that it was the entire\nAlliances fault. It had also been partly his.\nThey shouldn&#39;t have stopped here for such a long period of time, should have\njust collected themselves and moved on. Then, perhaps this glade would have\nbeen spared, and some other depth of the swamp would have looked like this\ninstead.\nBut it was too late to try and go back in time and fix mistakes now, this,\nonce wonderful, place was gone, and there was nothing that anybot could do\nnow to fix it.\nBut, it also wasn&#39;t entirely the glade that made Dinobot&#39;s aggression rise,\nit was also the factor that he had forced himself to receive a defeating\nblow RIGHT at the beginning of the battle. And now he had missed the entire\nthing, without even getting so much as two shots in.\nTHAT was the real downer, what made him realize that maybe he should have\nhung in there just a little bit longer before suddenly getting blown out by\na jusault.\nHowever, he had also saved Prowls life in the process on taking that blow,\none that could very possibly lead to his death now more then ever before.\nAnd the feathery bastard didn&#39;t even say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;\nBut, that really didn&#39;t matter to him. The concern, if it was that, in which\nProwl had expressed was good enough. For now.\nBut, by now Prowl had gone of to do slag knew what, leaving behind the sense\nthat he would need help getting back to the Cybertronian Fire.\nWell, that was what HE said anyway.\nDinobot knew that he needed help, but he didn&#39;t want to burden anybot with\nhis added weight so he wouldn&#39;t mention it.\nAs long as he could stay on his feet and actually walk he would be fine, so\nhe hoped anyway.\nHowever, there was one thing in which the damaged warrior didn&#39;t realize,\nnor notice until it was too late and nearly made his spark jump clear into\nhis throat.\nLooking over the smoking battlefield one last time he then turned his head\ntowards his blind side, clearly to see and pinpoint just where Tavatron was.\nHe hadn&#39;t seen her since he had been propelled into the trees by the force\nof Oblitercons blast, actually hoping that she would be alright.\nBut then as he snapped his head towards his left, he came face to face with\nexactly what he had been looking for.\nAnd quite frankly, it startled him.\nDinobot growled at the sudden appearance of the fembot, backing up a step so\nthat he could focus upon her in the process. His two dominant claws already\nfit and extended to slice through what he had thought was the enemy close\nenough to strike, then turning out to be Tavatron once his optic focused\nproperly.\nHe relaxed slightly, but was a little unnerved that he had been surprised by\nher. Making him feel foolish and out of place his claws relaxing.\nA snarl trickling from his throat. *\n\n&quot; Slag! WARN a bot before you come up on his blind side!!&quot;\n\n* That was all he managed to say before he suddenly saw the concern in\nTavatron&#39;s optics, making him stop and collect himself and completely forget\nany other things he was about to say.as well as a few curses.\nShe was worried about him and he could see that, even though she tried to\nhide it behind an emotionless expression.\nBut Dinobot had hid his own feelings behind such a look for years unknown,\nand he knew concern when he saw it.\nShe looked.she really looked worried about him.\nHis aggravated expression relaxed somewhat as he straightened himself, his\nhands simply falling at his sides as he head Tavatron&#39;s words.\nBut, he felt the pain that he had felt before, the wounds about his body far\nmore then what they looked, but not all that serious as they seemed.\nThey were basically only flesh wounds, ones that could be easily repaired in\nless then three mega-cycles.\nHowever, the pain of his wounds was the last thing on his mind. It was the\nconcern in the fembots optics that his conciseness dwelled on now.\nDinobot nodded once, still looking at her point blank.*\n\n&quot; Agreed. There IS nothing left here.&quot;\n\n* His sight then looking off again across the clearing, his body half turned\ntowards it.*\n\n&quot; Except.your concern.&quot;\n\n* He then looked back towards Tavatron, almost daring her to tell him just\nwhy she was so concerned about him all the time.*\n\n&quot; Even though it is not needed.&quot;\n\n* And it wasn&#39;t.\nHe didn&#39;t need her concern, and he wanted her to know that. He had far\nbetter things to worry about then himself at the moment, like getting her\nback to base and in one piece at the same time.\nDinobot then looked off towards the direction in which the swamp lay, where\nthe quickest path to the CF and Tavatron&#39;s safety lay.\nSo, with less effort then he knew, he transformed into Beast Mode. The pain\nof his wounds easing off and satisfied that the damage hadn&#39;t been\ntransferred to this mode as well. Giving his robot mode the chance to gain\npower and maybe even begin slow repairs as they traveled.\nBut now the pain was simply just a throb, and movement was easier now.\nDinobot turned his head towards Tavatron, waiting for her to transform as\nwell so that they could get going.\nIt was still going to be a long, and difficult way back to base.*\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
