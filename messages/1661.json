He calls &#39;Tocar&#39;, of which he has no excuse for (if\nhe\n&gt; even IS a BW fan), and when I said that I was the descendant of Optimus\n&gt; Prime, he called ME power-hungry!  Then he made up a G1 story that Prime\ndied\n&gt; in the end of G1.  Now I know that they wouldn&#39;t allow death in the show,\n&gt; even the Rebirth.  Did he read my profile?
