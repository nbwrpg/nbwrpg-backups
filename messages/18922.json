His jetpack sputters a bit before activating again, sending him \nflying, rather uncontrollably, in the direction of the Alliance base, barely \nmanaging to stay conscious.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike yells in pain as he attempts, but fails, to completely dodge \nSharpedge&#39;s sword. Following Reptilica&#39;s example, he jumps through the \nshield, taking off toward the Alliance base.\n\nBeing less damaged, he gets through easier than Reptilica.\n\n"}}
