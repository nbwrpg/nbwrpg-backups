Space out your characters like everyone else dose.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n War saw the crab bor come at him. He pulled the dagger from the bots side \n(hellbeast) and flipped backward. (im cooseing to ignore jp&#39;s posted damage \nfor my char here but iw ill acept in the other cases.) He landed  behind him \nfiring his wrist energy blasts. \n Proto took the shot from tankkor. He looked up one arm still in aracnia. \nThere was a hole in his stomach.miled as he healed over. Little slower then \nusual do to the cold. (If you have ever seen terminator 2 think of that.)  \nThe fist in aracnia spread out of it 20 spikes. (It should shoot those 20 out \nof her chest. Exposing her spark. But ill wait till jp posts.)Famine watched \nas the needle penetrated hell beast.  It would take 3 seconds for the bot to \ncollapse and his spark would  die in a minute. The virus randomly changed. So \nthey could never get a cure in time. He only has a min. He yanked the needle \nout and fired on tankore. Peastelense  sot at and enemy he saw. He ran and \ntried to make a shield for apocalypse. Apocalypse formed a shield of talons \nfrom his arms. One gift not yet tried out. he defleted a few blasts but one \nhit him in the shoulder sending shooting pain. HE nodded to death and  death \nwalked backward admiss the fire and swung down his reaper at aracnias neck. \nWhile doing so apocalypse tried to grab her by the next to hold her using his \nshield to block enemy fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------- Headers --------------------------------\nReturn-Path: \n&lt;sentto-508726-24262-977276007-JP3884=aol.com@...&gt;\nReceived: from  rly-za03.mx.aol.com (rly-za03.mail.aol.com [172.31.36.99]) by \nair-za03.mail.aol.com (v77.31) with ESMTP; Tue, 19 Dec 2000 20:54:22 -0500\nReceived: from  mo.egroups.com (mo.egroups.com [208.50.144.78]) by \nrly-za03.mx.aol.com (v77.27) with ESMTP; Tue, 19 Dec 2000 20:53:57 -0500\nX-eGroups-Return: \nsentto-508726-24262-977276007-JP3884=aol.com@...\nReceived: from [10.1.4.53] by mo.egroups.com with NNFMP; 20 Dec 2000 01:33:32 \n-0000\nX-Sender: Kinger01030@...\nX-Apparently-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nReceived: (EGP: mail-6_3_1_3); 20 Dec 2000 01:33:26 -0000\nReceived: (qmail 83253 invoked from network); 20 Dec 2000 01:33:26 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (10.1.10.26) by l7.egroups.com with QMQP; 20 Dec 2000 \n01:33:26 -0000\nReceived: from unknown (HELO imo-r03.mx.aol.com) (152.163.225.3) by mta1 with \nSMTP; 20 Dec 2000 01:33:25 -0000\nReceived: from Kinger01030@... by imo-r03.mx.aol.com (mail_out_v28.35.) id \na.14.d4b3889 (4402) for &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;; Tue, 19 Dec 2000 20:33:16 -0500 \n(EST)\nMessage-ID: &lt;14.d4b3889.2771665c@...&gt;\nTo: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nX-Mailer: CompuServe 2000 32-bit sub 107\nFrom: kinger01030@...\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nMailing-List: list nbwrpg@egroups.com; contact nbwrpg-owner@egroups.com\nDelivered-To: mailing list nbwrpg@egroups.com\nPrecedence: bulk\nList-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:nbwrpg-unsubscribe@egroups.com&gt;\nDate: Tue, 19 Dec 2000 20:33:16 EST\nReply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n\n"}}
