The sound of \nKitKat&#39;s voice, telling Gotron not to forward anything to Zardus, reaching \nhim as he lands. KitKat must have forgotten that Bloodystrike was under \nZardus&#39; command, he thought, ordering Alliance members not to forward info \nwas kinda useless.\n\nHe walks into the cave, his internal computer already formulating a report of \nthe battle.\n\n"}}
