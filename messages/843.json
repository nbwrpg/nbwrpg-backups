Taking the opportunity, Zardus crouches, pulls out his own \n&gt; gun, and fires off several shots at the traitor&#39;s chest. FZ stumbles \n&gt; back, right into Nemesis&#39; and Zergling&#39;s swords. He slides off the \n&gt; swords and falls to the ground, his eyes going blank.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus looks down at the still form of FZ. &quot;Thank you, Nemesis, \n&gt; Zergling.&quot; He says.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Take his weapons and put him in a CR chamber. Inform me when he \n&gt; wakes up. The fool will be very sorry before he dies......&quot; Zardus \n&gt; tells Nemesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks over at Wolfgang. &quot;Zergling, inform me if Wolfgang ever \n&gt; decides to speak. I&#39;ll go see the new bot.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zardus walks off down a hallway, heading for the entrance of the \n&gt; alliance base. He raises his comm-link to his mouth, &quot;I&#39;m on my way, \n&gt; Dracona.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *--- FREE VOICEMAIL FOR YOUR HOME PHONE! ---*\n&gt; With eVoice Now you can keep in touch with clients, vendors, co-workers, \n&gt; friends and family ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.
