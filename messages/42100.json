A spark container wasn&#39;t in any way important, since there were many in the lab, but why would Orchestra want one? Zardus didn&#39;t really believe the bot&#39;s exuse of research, but he didn&#39;t see anything bad about sparing one for better relations with the Predacons.\n\n&quot;Yes, you can have one. I have something to take care of, so I have to go.&quot;\n\nHe looks at Wheeljack. &quot;You can give him one of the spark containers in the equipment room next to here. If something comes up, contact me.&quot;\n\nZardus turns around, leaving the room and heading for the docking bay.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;LurkerAbyss&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Orchestra/Composer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Composer looked at Zardus, but didn&#39;t stay anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Uh, yes,&quot; Orchestra said, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to look like a thief or a moocher,\n&gt; but, I was wondering if I could borrow a spark container.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
