It was a peaceful time, her favorite time of the day.\nShe sighed and rested her head on her outstretched paws, relaxing her muscles as she rested there.\nIt had been a long journey from Rowdy�s cave to here, a good weeks travel since she kept a fairly fast pace.\nBut she rested here now, in the deepness of this comforting forest. \nShe still had a long way to go before she got home, this was just the half waypoint.\nWith a wolfish yawn she settled down and closed her eyes, breathing another sigh as she felt the stiffness of her muscles. There was a hope to take a short nap, just until nightfall.\nZyber�s muscles relaxed as sleep began to set in, slowly slipping into the world of dream as the light began to fade.\nIt was several hours before she was suddenly brought back to the world of reality, her ears pricked up. Her head snapped up but it too her a moment to focus her eyes, straining her ears to listen to what she had heard.\nSomething was crashing through the thickness of the forest, and there were voices. Male and female.\nWith a quick movement she got to her feel, shaking out her fur and growling at the stiffness in her joints.\nShe was well rested but still a bit groggy, but she decided that she would investigate anyway. She could use some amusement.\nZyber sniffed the air and thought that she recognized the scent of something, something that she remembered long ago. She couldn�t quite pinpoint what it was, but she was sure that it was familiar.\nShe listened to the thrashing of the bushes and the voices, finally locating where it was all coming from and heading off in the direction.\nIt wasn�t long until she finally found what was making all of that noise, both scores at the bottom of a small hill.\nThe night was surrounding the forest but she hardly noticed, her eyes adjusting to the light perfectly.\nShe was perched upon a large rock at the top of the hill that the rodent had fallen from, looking down at the scene that was unfolding before her.\nThere was a bird of prey sitting upon a log beside a giant rat, speaking to him and watching him intently.\nBut then when her eyes fell upon the rat Zyber finally understood why the scent had seemed familiar before, it was that of this rat, the same one in which she had tried to save from that blizzard a month or so before. And if he was there now, he must have survived.\nWith a sigh Zyber settled down on the boulder that she stood upon, sitting in her haunches and watching all that was going on below.\nHer white fur shone silver in the growing darkness, the stars beginning to come out as the beginning of a full moon rose in the east.\nBut if one was to look upon her now she would appear as if to look like some wild ghost, some mountain legend that roamed freely when the stars shone bright and the moon scored full.\nShe watched, through the trees of the forest. The soft night wind rustling through her fur as well as the leaves around her, making this a truly magical night.\n Where the ghosts of the wild roamed free.* \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________\nWant to make new friends all over the world?\nVisit http://www.penpals.com  It&#39;s FREE!\n\n"}}
