Look, you want pain, you got\n&gt; it.  Go to the lab and get the smallest brushes you can find and\n&gt; youand Land Mine can start scrubbing away at the walls right now.\n&gt; Start with this room. And make sure you get every inch of the walls\n&gt; clean too. Got it?&quot;   She know had two pain loving bots to deal with\n&gt; in addition to all the other stuff.  She was having trouble with it.\n&gt; she had Megatron and the Vok thing to deal with.  She was hearing\n&gt; Phobia and for some strange reason, wanting to follow Phobia&#39;s\n&gt; advice. And now she had two bots who were obsesded with hurting each\n&gt; other on top of that.  She rolled her optics and walked to the\n&gt; entrance.  She was hoping to see Megatron return. But he wasn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s just that we both thought you meant what you meant, and\n&gt; that&#39;s it.
