However the feline transformer quickly caught up to him near the \nMaximal base.  He leaps into the air, transforming in flight and launching \none dagger into Enertron&#39;s shoulder.  Enertron grunts and goes down hard, \nhitting the ground and rolling back to his feet.  He turns to face his \nassailant.  Holding the shoulder of his wounded arm he glares at Amperion.  \n&quot;Why must you insist on this?&quot;\n\n       Amperion returns his glare.  &quot;You know full well why.&quot;  As Enertron \nturns to flee again Amperion grabs his arm.  The sound of tiny mechanisms can \nbe heard as he attempts to gain Enertron&#39;s power of energy for himself, \nunfortunately this is less than effective on a living bot.  Enertron sends a \nsurge of energy through the link wiping most of Amperion&#39;s memories and \nleaving him a babbling mess in front of the Maximal base.  Enertron then \npulls the dagger from his shoulder and drops it next to Amperion.\n\n       With his pursuer disabled he takes flight heading aimlessly toward the \nSoutheast.  His wing was also damaged by the dagger, and thus his flight is \nboth erratic and painful.  With one last hurrah he clears a tree to land in a \nclearing.  Unfortunately the clearing is already occupied by the Predacon \nbase.  Bouncing off of the base he lands on the ground in severe pain.\n\r\n--part1_15d.14b76f42.2ac2785a_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=arial,helvetica&gt;&lt;FONT  SIZE=2&gt;OOC: Blah I keep forgetting my own storylines. :P\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;::Enertron/Amperion::\n&lt;BR&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enertron kept running as fast as he could away from his pursuer, Amperion. &nbsp;However the feline transformer quickly caught up to him near the Maximal base. &nbsp;He leaps into the air, transforming in flight and launching one dagger into Enertron&#39;s shoulder. &nbsp;Enertron grunts and goes down hard, hitting the ground and rolling back to his feet. &nbsp;He turns to face his assailant. &nbsp;Holding the shoulder of his wounded arm he glares at Amperion. &nbsp;&quot;Why must you insist on this?&quot;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amperion returns his glare. &nbsp;&quot;You know full well why.&quot; &nbsp;As Enertron turns to flee again Amperion grabs his arm. &nbsp;The sound of tiny mechanisms can be heard as he attempts to gain Enertron&#39;s power of energy for himself, unfortunately this is less than effective on a living bot. &nbsp;Enertron sends a surge of energy through the link wiping most of Amperion&#39;s memories and leaving him a babbling mess in front of the Maximal base. &nbsp;Enertron then pulls the dagger from his shoulder and drops it next to Amperion.\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his pursuer disabled he takes flight heading aimlessly toward the Southeast. &nbsp;His wing was also damaged by the dagger, and thus his flight is both erratic and painful. &nbsp;With one last hurrah he clears a tree to land in a clearing. &nbsp;Unfortunately the clearing is already occupied by the Predacon base. &nbsp;Bouncing off of the base he lands on the ground in severe pain.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n--part1_15d.14b76f42.2ac2785a_boundary--\r\n\n"}}
