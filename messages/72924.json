I&#39;ve made a misjudgement, I apologize for\n&gt; my assumption.   Yet I do believe we better be on guard as to how this rumor\n&gt; got started.  Leo, it could be possible that you have been cloned, and that\n&gt; clone could have started this.   It&#39;s only a guess, but it does fit from\n&gt; what you&#39;ve told me.  If Rodimus can be cloned, so can any of us.  Who\n&gt; knows, a black dragon could be out there tarnishing my reputation as we\n&gt; speak.  All right, I need to scan your systems and capture your schematics.\n&gt; Then I will attempt to seek out an outside match according to the intel I\n&gt; acquire from you.  I may not be blind but I still have my other senses that\n&gt; were there before I regained my sight.  It&#39;s a long shot but it should\n&gt; work.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already\n&gt; posses.  Nothing is worth more than family and friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 2, 2012, at 4:35 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson turns on Leo and stomps a powerful foot down on the ground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Something had just snapped inside his directory yet he still keeps his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; composure.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; It isn&#39;t a matter of what the Predacon has told me, it was a matter of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how\n&gt;&gt; &gt; composed they remained while helping us. Oh yes I kept that in the back\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; my mind Leo Prime, I kept that in the back of my mind. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He narrows his eyes with a wise expression.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; I wondered why the alliance went as well as it did. I was sure to get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; refusal but I didn&#39;t, and at first I thought nothing of it but then I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; started thinking. How could this be? Oh yes for a grave price you get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cooperation from a Predacon. Now you tell me Leo, I&#39;m listening, how is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that this alliance happened so easily? I will take back what I said and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things will be as they stand, with you in command of course. The truth\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Leo,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all I want IS THE TRUTH. You can tell me that can you?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He stands firm with a thrash of his tail.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO PRIME stood there grinding his teeth, well he would if he had any\n&gt;&gt; in robot mode. He glared at TUSCON. &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed that Hydras\n&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t here, or Cyclonus or Scourge or any of the sweeps?&quot; LEO said,\n&gt;&gt; his voice calm but seething with his own anger. &quot;The Predacons come\n&gt;&gt; for the same reason as we, to locate their missing comrades and to\n&gt;&gt; find out what is at the bottom of this jungle. The same reasons that\n&gt;&gt; they were ready to do so before.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LEO paused for emphasis, &quot;There is no offer of any life for a life for\n&gt;&gt; this mission, and if you claim to know what it is to be a Prime then\n&gt;&gt; you would know that I would never sell someone&#39;s life for this.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as he spoke LEO kept silent on the matters closest to him, like\n&gt;&gt; the suspicion that the PREDACONS did have some other agenda, some\n&gt;&gt; other reason for being here. But it was not something he was willing\n&gt;&gt; to give voice to so close to finding out what was going on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For the moment, witnessing the seeming altercation of aggression\n&gt;&gt; &gt; circuits\n&gt;&gt; &gt; between LEO PRIME and TUSCON PRIME as DINOBOT went out of the tunnel,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; flanking over towards SKY SHADOW with a look of.. AMUSEMENT upon his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; faceplate, but remaining in silence.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Staying on inter-Predacon radio, which hopefully at close range would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then, and not be audible to the MAXIMALS, and sending a signal to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CRYOTEK.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;We seem to be restrained down here for now. What are your orders then?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Press on or attempt to instigate altercations within the MAXIMALS?&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually inside the caves radios were completely out. However CRYOTEK\n&gt;&gt; had made his way back to stand with DINOBOT and SKYSHADOW. &quot;We may\n&gt;&gt; need them before we get to the end of this.&quot; CRYOTEK said\n&gt;&gt; thoughtfully. &quot;This is obviously a trap of some sort and unfortunately\n&gt;&gt; we seem to be caught within it as much as the Maximals are.&quot; he said\n&gt;&gt; in a low voice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; SKYSHADOW nodded, &quot;Unfortunately I have to agree.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; CRYOTEK glanced at DINOBOT, &quot;But go ahead and do what you can to keep\n&gt;&gt; them off balance. We can&#39;t have them ready to turn against us too\n&gt;&gt; soon.&quot; He grunted, &quot;Hydras has been taken from us, that seriously\n&gt;&gt; changes the balance of power here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The aerial Predacons up aboveground seemed to be cut off from them for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; now,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who had not followed them underground (such as WASPINATOAR and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BLACKARACHNIA).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DRILL BIT had dug back underground once his bait had been laid, digging\n&gt;&gt; &gt; underneath. VICE GRIP remained at hte rear of the tunnel, still cloaked,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and attempting to (and most likely failing) to scan whatever had\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seemingly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cut off the tunnel back to the surface.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Active sensors are down here inside the cave, however vibrations can\n&gt;&gt; be sensed by DRILLBIT, vibrations that center roughly about in the\n&gt;&gt; entrance chamber where they first entered into the caves. Vibrations\n&gt;&gt; were very familiar to DRILL BIT and but centered on that entrance way\n&gt;&gt; but spreading out to affect even the tunnels he was digging. . .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even above the rest of the MAXIMALS and PREDACONS began to feel a\n&gt;&gt; rumble and then a shaking, the rumbling quickly being felt down the\n&gt;&gt; paths to where the rest of the MAXIMALS and the PREDACONS stood.\n&gt;&gt; Anyone who had ever had any experience inside of caves or in\n&gt;&gt; underground setting knew what they were feeling.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The opening tremors for a CAVE IN!!!!!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The walls began to shake as stone and rocks began to fall. The\n&gt;&gt; apparent only way to safety lay in further into the caves themselves,\n&gt;&gt; since, strangely enough, it was the cave through which most of the\n&gt;&gt; MAXIMALS and PREDACON had entered this place was from where it seemed\n&gt;&gt; to be extending from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was like they were being pushed or herded forward!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
