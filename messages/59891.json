His luck had been with \nhim \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the Maximals and Predacons had returned in a mass of glory and \nthe \n&gt; Pred \n&gt; &gt; had been estatic, returning to his rightful place next to \nMegatron.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now that Megatron had become Hydras, the bug bot had still \nstayed \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; his side, even if he did change and maybe become a bit meaner. \nBut \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; would still be a faithful Predacon.
