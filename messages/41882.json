Don&#39;t forget that\n Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Steven Regal, all learned their trade in\n the WCW. &gt;&gt;\n\nThe Rock didn&#39;t come straight from pro football though.  And so?  He uses a \nmove that Owen Hart used to use as well.  He&#39;s got better moves than the WCW. \n Jake the Snake used the DDT as his major move now it&#39;s used by everyone.  \nHeh, Jeff Jarret is one of my least favorites, even when he was in the WWF \nOwen Hart carried him along.  Steiner, no idea who he is.  Sting was in the \nWWF before he was in the WCW by the way.  And I&#39;d like to point out his look \nin the WCW is laughable compared to the look during his years in the WWF.  \nYou may not have read what I said earlier, but I said I thought Benoit \nsucked, and I also said the WCW and ECW were breeding grounds for wrestlers \nwho can make it to the big time in the WWF.  Steven Regal&#39;s been in the WWF \nfor a while, too.  Before Regal he was The Manly Man, can&#39;t remember his \nnamed but it was something The Manly Man.  \n\n"}}
