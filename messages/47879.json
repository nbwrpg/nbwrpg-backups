The\nvoice sounded much like Sunhawks&#39; but with the communications system rather\nfritzy he couldn&#39;t hear the complete message. Tapping the wall communicator\nhe messaged the bridge, &quot;Talos here, how is repairs coming on the\ncommunications systems up there, try and get the incoming signal from\nSunhawk cleared up.&quot;\n\n    Shutting down both comms he went back to work helping to make the mess\nhall a place to relax, after todays events he was sure the crew would need\nsome down time. While he didn&#39;t want them too relaxed for when they dealt\nwith the preds, he didn&#39;t want them falling over either.\n\n\n\n"}}
