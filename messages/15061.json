Meaning, shuttles, transport ships, ships like Phobia has, \npods, etc... are fine, and can have CR chambers in them, but I can&#39;t launch \nthe Alliance base into the atmosphere (althoug it has flight capability), and \nbe going with the rules.\n\n::Ramulus::\n\nRamulus nods. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of spare parts around here, we could use them.&quot;\n\nHe sighs, thinking about Fliq. &quot;There&#39;s an option for repairing Fliq, \nthough,&quot; Ramulus says, looking back at the shuttle, &quot;My spark is a transmetal \n2. It has regeneration capabilities, and it probably would be able to fix \nhim. But to do that, we&#39;d need to put it into his body...&quot;\n\n"}}
