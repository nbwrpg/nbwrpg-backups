He felt like he was going to pass out for \nthe second time. He leaned over to the side and fought himself over it. He \nwas confused and no one was answering him. He was getting mad. If he found \nthose fools that shot him and blew his leg to the Pit, he would give them a \npiece of his mind. He wasn&#39;t in any good moods right now. &quot;Somebody tell me \nwhat we&#39;re doin&#39;!&quot; she screamed. He kicked the seat in front of him with his \ngood leg. He wanted to go back to base. He thought that it wouldn&#39;t be long \nunil the ship&#39;s computer turned on Hell Beast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alarms on the Predacon ship suddenly went off. The lights flashed red \nand the systems boom loudly, screaming its warnings. The computer detected \nnone of its trusted inhabitabts inside. The auto-guns, once again turned to \nfull alert. The voice of the computer announced its displeasure with the \n&quot;intruders&quot;, with the feminine voice of the Darkside. It locked doors on \nitself, and shut some systems down, some Hell Beast&#39;s soldier&#39;s needed. The \ncomputer was going to reject any commands.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
