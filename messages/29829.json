Iron Raptor had ignored her and just left \nher behind. She stood their astounded. How could her best friend ignore her \nso? It stung at Shadow Cat&#39;s eyes as she tried not to cry. &lt;Every one is \nleaving Me&gt; She thought. &lt; I&#39;m glad Snow tech is still around&gt; She frowned, \nwhere was her brother anyway? He should of been here by now! She turned to \nwhere she had left him and called his name.*\n\n&quot; SNOW TECHHHHHHH! WHERE ARE YOU?&quot;\n\n* The bushes ruffled and Snow Tech stepped out. He looked up at her with \nembarrassed eyes.*\n\n&quot; Whats wrong with yo....&quot;\n\n* Shadow Cat stopped. She had spied what had made the young bot embarrassed \nenough to turn red. There, hanging from each nipple, was the kittens, trying \nto suckle.*\n\n&quot; It&#39;s not my fault! They rushed me!&quot;\n\n&quot; Shadow Cat did not hear her brothers plea of innocents, she was laughing \nhard enough to split her gut. As she regained her breath, Snow Tech tugged \non one of the kittens.*\n\n&quot; Shut-up and help me get them off, they&#39;re stuck!&quot;\n\n* Giggling, Shadow Cat went to help him, grabbing a kitten by it&#39;s waist and \npulling. When it didn&#39;t let go, she pulled harder. When it STILL didn&#39;t let \ngo she started pulling in earnest, tugging on it till it pulled Snow tech&#39;s \n*AHEM* nipples till they stretched out as long as the kitten its self!*\n\n&quot; OW! OW. owowowowwww! STOP! IT HURRRTTTTTSSSSSS!&quot;\n\n  *Snow Tech whined and pleaded with tears in his eyes.*\n\n&quot; Just rip off my tit! GOD PLEASE STOP!!!&quot;\n\n* And, with a loud pop, the kitten came off. Snow tech rubbed his sore boob \nand gave a dirty look at the small kitten. Shadow Cat smiled*\n\n&quot; There&#39;s still one more to go!&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
