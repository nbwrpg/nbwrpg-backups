It was a small insect \ncrawling around the table. He squashed it. Getting up becasue he was \ndisgusted to eat his food he walked over to the trash and threw it in. He \nnoticed two more in the trash. (They are insects after all) He went into the \nkitchen to grab a drink and noticed somemore by a vent. He went to a computer \nmonitor.\n    &quot;Computer give me a schimatic of the ktichen,&quot; One popped up before him \non the screen. He pointed on the screen. &quot;Where does that vent lead to?&quot;\n    &quot;To many options to choose from, please specify.&quot; The computet replied. \n    &quot;Just show me all of where it leads to,&quot; The computer did as it was told. \nThe vent ran pratically through all of the ship, and to the outside. He \npicked up a bug and asked the computer to show where all organic life forms \nwere in the ship. It showed that there were none in the kitchen, including \nother places. The strange part was that he had one in his hand, and could see \na few more by a vent. But there were few organic creatures in the base at \nall. Only by the main door.\n    &quot;Battera, I will be right back, I&#39;m going to find Magmatron.&quot; CyberShark \nsaid and rushed out the door. He made his way to the Control room, but \nMagmatron was not there.\n    He asked the computer where Magmatron is. It showed him. He ran toward \nMagmatron.\n    &quot;Sir, I found this bug in the kitchen,&quot; CyberShark said out of breath. He \nneeded to catch his breath before he could explain.\n    &quot;Yes, we seem to be having an infestation problem. It&#39;s nothing of \nimportance. Yet.&quot; Magmatron replied.\n    &quot;But sir you don&#39;t understand, there no--urgk,&quot; CyberShark said as \nMagmatron lifted him off the ground by his neck.\n    &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I don&#39;t understand. Do yoy understand that?&quot; \nMagmatron said putting him down.\n    &quot;Yes sir. But the Computer doesn&#39;t show them as organic creatures. They \nare machines.&quot; CyberShark said.\n\n(I could go further, but I wanna see what Phobia does with this news.)\n\n\n"}}
