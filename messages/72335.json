Hmm, from what I have already observed, Magmatron is a highly establ=\r\nished strategist.  You&#39;re right, Big Convoy, getting past him will not be e=\r\nasy.  Then again, my comrades often have a hard time trying to figure me ou=\r\nt.  I admit that some of my techniques are completely out of the box but so=\r\n far, we&#39;ve all survived through some very difficult times.  Which has now =\r\nled me here, to you.  I know this happened for a very good reason, and if I=\r\n can get all of you out safely I will.  It&#39;s just going to have to be a lit=\r\ntle creatively done, if you know what I mean..  And I already have somethin=\r\ng in mind. &quot;\n\nHe steps closer to all of them.  As he spoke his voice was ke=\r\npt at a whisper. He continues but lowers it even further to the point where=\r\n only his new found friends could hear.\n\n&quot; I noticed that as a Maximal, in =\r\nbeast form, I experienced strong urges to revert to my most primitive of an=\r\nimal instincts.  Mind you, dragons can be extremely aggressive and destruct=\r\nive as well as wise.  I&#39;ve also found my tail and wings to be rather strong=\r\n.  But most of all, my voice. As the dragon, my roar has a sonic component =\r\nto it.  This means that through proper harmonics I could stir up a sizable =\r\ndiversion, long enough to get you out of here.  Of course my little reversi=\r\non will be controlled and as soon as you&#39;re free, I will join you.  If I do=\r\nn&#39;t make it out, at least I know that you will, and then you can rejoin Leo=\r\n Prime and the others back at the Ark where you belong. This is a risk I am=\r\n more than willing to take for your freedom.

Now, I need to know if Cy=\r\nclonus, Optimus Primal, or\n&gt; &gt; Cheetor have also been taken here. From here=\r\n on out, if we communicate this\n&gt; &gt; way, they will not understand us.

As the dragon, my roa=\r\nr has a sonic component to it. &nbsp;This means that through proper harmoni=\r\ncs I could stir up a sizable diversion, long enough to get you out of here.=\r\n &nbsp;Of course my little reversion will be controlled and as soon as you&#39;=\r\nre free, I will join you. &nbsp;If I don&#39;t make it out, at least I know tha=\r\nt you will, and then you can rejoin Leo Prime and the others back at the Ar=\r\nk where you belong. This is a risk I am more than willing to take for your =\r\nfreedom. &nbsp;So, all in favor, shake on it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He =\r\nkeeps his hand extended to his new comrades.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on t=\r\nhe move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Sep 29, 2011, at 6:25 A=\r\nM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclo=\r\nnus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;ci=\r\nte&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;BIG CONVOY &#39;bumped&#39; into TUSCON as he wa=\r\ns talking with his hands,&lt;br&gt;\ndisrupting the conversation. &quot;Be careful here=\r\n boy.&quot; He said in low&lt;br&gt;\nfierce tones. &quot;Some of Magmatron&#39;s men used to be=\r\n Maximals, and there&lt;br&gt;\nis no tellin&#39; who has been trained in what.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nThere was a resignation in BIG CONVOY&#39;s voice as he looked at TUSCON,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&quot;You don&#39;t think we tried to escape?&quot; He sighed, &quot;We caught up to&lt;br&gt;\nMa=\r\ngmatron on planet Gaia, but still lost, and ended up here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Who i=\r\ns this?&quot; Says one of two other warriors ask as they walk up to&lt;br&gt;\nBIG CONV=\r\nOY and TUSCON, he was shorter than TUSCON and BIG CONVOY,&lt;br&gt;\nperhaps as ta=\r\nll as CHEETOR.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Heh&quot; The other one grunts, this one perhaps as tal=\r\nl as Straight shot,&lt;br&gt;\nbut full of gusto. &quot;He looks kinda&#39; green.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nThe first shakes his head, &quot;Anh, he looks kinda silver.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere wa=\r\ns a trace of a smile on BIG CONVOY, &quot;Mach Kick, Break, meet Tuscon.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nMACH KICK =3D &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/albu=\r\nm/628943817/pic/1540469953/view&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/n=\r\nbwrpg/photos/album/628943817/pic/1540469953/view&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/nbwrpg/photos/album/628943817/pic/1540469953/view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBRE=\r\nAK =3D&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg/photos/album/628=\r\n943817/pic/1347017803/view&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nbwrpg=\r\n/photos/album/628943817/pic/1347017803/view&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nnbwrpg/photos/album/628943817/pic/1347017803/view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn 9/28/11, Sandy Panico &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magi=\r\ncquartz%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;magicquartz@y=\r\nahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tucson was now starting to put things =\r\ntogether.

In any event he knew he had&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to focus=\r\n on getting everyone out instead of fighting.

Now, I need to know=\r\n if Cyclonus, Optimus Primal, or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cheetor have also been taken here=\r\n.  From here on out, if we communicate this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; way, they will not und=\r\nerstand us.  Anything related to our escape plan will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be communica=\r\nted this way.

I went to visit our fallen leader, Optimus Prime,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; asked Primus for his help to recover R=\r\nodimus. And before I knew it, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; upg=\r\nraded to a Prime. Before that, I attempted to rescue Rodimus myself.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; &gt; No&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; matter the risk, I knew I had to put his s=\r\nafety ahead of my own.
