He was tall, with a gun mounted on each of his forearms, and had fur growing out of his armor. He begins to walk toward the Predacon base.\n\nThe bot was Slayer, but was completely uncomparable to him. His appearance, and his spark signature, were completely different. He had switched his comm off from a Trainer frequency so that he wouldn&#39;t be disturbed on this mission.\n\nSlayer taps his comm, sending a message to the Predacon base. &quot;Predacons, this is Striker,&quot; he&#39;d chosen the first fake name to pop into his mind, &quot;I am near your base and am looking to join you.&quot;\n\nHe calmly proceeds forward, taking one final check on all the various precautions that he had put into himself.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer emerges out of the equipment room, a totaly different bot. He had redesigned his look and spark signature, now appearing to be a complete Predacon. He walks to the exit and flies out, sending a message to Ignatius.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I will be back, with Prebon,&quot; the message reads as he flies off toward the Predacon base.\n\n\n"}}
