This started after they did Transformers: Headmasters.\nAnyway here is what I came up with in my head to fit &#39;Car Robots&#39; in.\nAfter the TF race stoped all contact with Earth, the great upgrade\nhappaned, and they became Maximals and Predacons. After Beast Wars Neo,\na group of Predacons(Destron/Destronger in Japan) went back in time, to\nEarth. Why? We dont know. Anyway Optimus Prime(Fire Convoy) and the last\nAutobots followed. What I dont gat is why the original TF&#39;s arn&#39;t in it.\nIt is in 2000, so it would be 5 years before Tf: The Movie.\n\nThings are going to get wierder because in a few months America is going\nto &#39;car&#39; TF&#39;s again. A new toy line called TF: Robots in Desquise will\nbe released. Also &#39;Car Robots&#39; will be inported, and tweaked a little so\nit fits the American continuity. It will probably have Predacons, after\nBeast Machines, going to Earth, and finding that the last Autobots were\nhiding there. They will probably change the year 2000 thing and set in a\nappropriat year. Well I hope I cleared things up, although I probably\nconfused you even more.\n\n"}}
