And that&#39;show a lot of his interaction comes a=\r\ncross - as baiting, heckling, and the like.  \n\nSo, I apologize for making t=\r\nhings testy, and hope to keep on having more fun with everyone and running =\r\nfof the interactions!  Hope the rest of you enjoy him stirring the pot, and=\r\n if you need it toned down, just ask.\n\n\n"}}
