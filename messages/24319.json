I was just about to reply.)\n\n** Carnage had had enough of the sun as it had began to dip down in the \nwest, it&#39;s rays not so alive and heating as before.\nIt had been late after noon before she had climbed down from her little \nsunning spot half way up a cliff, her body warmed by the great yellow orb \nabove her head...but her stomach growling from nothing to eat since the day \nbefore.\n\nHowever, now that she was in the cover of the trees and the sun had long \ndisappeared, she was in the mood for a bit of...carnage.\nHunting to put not too fine a point on it.\nThrough the day her temper hadn&#39;t lifted and her hunger had just given her \nan excuse to go out and do just what she felt like doing...strangling \nsomething!\nIt always relieved the anger.\nBesides, it was better then laying on that ledge and brooding all day about \nthings going on the in the world that she couldn&#39;t change.\nAlso, the night air and the thrill of the hunt always cleared her mind and \nmade her feel more a part of this planet then any other time. Simply letting \nher beast mode go and letting it do what it wanted, while she left the logic \nof her robot mode begind.\n\nCarnage passed by a rather large tree, finding her way over the huge roots \nand down onto the ground once again.\nAway from the battles, away from the bots. This was the life she was ment to \nlive!\nShe shook herself and looked around the trees, lifting her snout to the wind \nnow and again to see if she could catch the scent of something.\nBut there was nothing around.\nJust as well anyway.\nMost creatures other then smaller rodents didn&#39;t dare go out into \nunprotected places like this, where there was no cover other then the roots \nbetween trees.\nCarnage sighed and continued on her way, towards...slag knew where. \nWhereever her nose led her she guessed.\nBut then...her head snapped up and stared blindly into the darkness around \nher, all of her attention on what she had thought she had just smelled.\nHer head darted in a few directions for a moment, catching other whiffs of \nwhat she knew was game.\nIt was...something...not large but not all that small...either.\nBut...by the musky scent...it was covered in fur.\nSuddenly her head snapped forward, towards the direction that the \nscent...and a slight grunting was coming from.\nBoar!\nShe sniffed again...and a sow...with...3 piglets!\nCarnage growled as her eyes drew into slits and her mouth opened slightly, \nthe glands under her top lips which were built into her beast mode letting \nher know of the health of her prey...and that they were a little nervous.\nWell...they had every right to be!\nMoving forward and placed her feet carefully, moving very slowly before she \nsuddenly saw a tusked face dart up, looking towards her.\nCarnage froze, stopping her breathing completely so that her prey wouldn&#39;t \nknow that she was even alive.\nThe boar still looking at her from behond a root.\nShe glared at the wild pig.\nNow or never!\nCarnage bunched up her leg muscles, her tail going stiff and straight behind \nher.\nBut her target wasn&#39;t the boar, it was the sow and smaller swine behind him.\nShe used the strength in her hind legs to  move quickly and snapp her whole \nbody towards the root, smashing into it before she stepped up onto it.\nThe pigs squeeling in fright and beginning to run awat from the shower of \nsplinters she had sent up.\nBut her eyes had already narrowed onto the sow and her rushing young, not \neven noticing that the boar had stayed behind and was now right under her as \njumped from the root.\nIt jumped up with it&#39;s tusks in the lead, managing to catch her right on the \nbottom of her thigh.\nCarnage fell with a grunt onto the ground, snapping her head back to see the \nboar ready to gore her. But she had no time to deal with him!\nShe brough her hind legs up against her stomach and then snapped them down \ntowards his face, her claws first.\nThe boar squeeled as blood shot up from it&#39;s face and it&#39;s head snapped \nback, Carnage smiling and baring her teeth as she heard the saticfying sound \nof a broken neck as the body of the male pig slammed up against the trunk og \nthe tree behind it.\nGetting to her feet and looking towards the escaping sow, knwoing that the \nboar was still alive from it&#39;s pained screames behind her.\nEchoing through the trees.\nShe would come back to finish it&#39;s suffering after she had gotten what she \nhad come for.\nBut she was off again, her legs pumping behind her as she moved to gain upin \nthe sow which was moving through the trees towards the brush a few hundred \nmeters away.\nHowever, the smaller pigs could not keep up with their mother.\n\nCarnage snapped down with her jaws, moving over a small piglet with her body \nand then moving her jaws down, her teeth sinking into the back and front of \nit&#39;s neck as her jaws closed.\nThen bringing the squirming mass of pink up with her head as she kept \nrunning, moving along and gaining on it&#39;s mother.\nCarnage bit down hard onto the head of the small pig as her mody moved \nquickly, feeling the sudden squirt of the tiny thing&#39;s brains onto her \ntongue as she crushed it&#39;s skull. ( sorry if this is too disgusting for \nsome).\nThe sow was close!\nOpening her jaws as she neared the female pig, the corps of the infent \nfalling from her jaws, Carnage drew within striking distance.\nWith a bunching of muscles she lept onto the sows back, both of them \ndisappearing into the brush just as the sow had reached it.\n\nThe forest echoed with the horrid screams of a dying animal as and growls \nand bloodthirsty snarls followed. The sound of taring flesh coming much \nsooner before the screams eventually softened and then faded, leaving the \nechos of saticfied snarls and the crunching of bones.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
