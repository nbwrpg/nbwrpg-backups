He turned\nto see another dragon staring down at him.

The elemental stood up on his back legs\nbrandishing the maximal symbol on his chest. &quot;ROARRRRRRRRRRRRR&quot;\n\nThe force of the roar forced Ignatius off the cliff sending him tumbling\ndownward. He quickly righted himself by transforming to eagle mode and\nattempting to fly away. Necromancer quickly blocked his escape and\nredirected the eagle back toward the CF.
