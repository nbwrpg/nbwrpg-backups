If \nthey think there landing here, they must be suicidal! Black Aracnia, bring \nonline the Spacial Defense Systems.\n\n::: Black Aracnia turns around concerned ::: But Hell Beast, we can only use \nthose in outter space, not on planetside.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Then this will be a test, now wont it? Bring it online!\n\n::: Black Aracnia sighs and types in a few access codes. On the top of the \nPredacon ship, a panel slides open to reveal a missle turrent. It lights up \nand becomes active. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Is the cruiser tageted?\n\n::: Pheniox ::: Yes sir.\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Fire!\n\n::: The turrent sends out five large missels. Because they were ment to be \nused in Zero Gravity, two of them plummit to the ground and explode, the \nthree others make altitude and lock onto the Maximal ship. With swift speed, \nthey collide. :::\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Well, it wasnt perfect but if we can get it down we can \ninvade and slaughter.\n\n\n"}}
