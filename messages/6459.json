A blast in the center of the ship would hit \nthe engine room and we all have a one way trip out of here.&quot; Looks at DarkOne \n&quot;So I suggest we settle this in the old style one on one combat I&#39;ll \nRepresent the maximals and you can use your gestalt any natural attacks and \none weapon of choice. I win we walk away free all 3 of the maximals you win I \nsurrender with hurt pride and you have 3 Hostages. You game or well we all \nhead to the matrix here now.&quot; Tigerhawk keeps his finger on the button.\n\n"}}
