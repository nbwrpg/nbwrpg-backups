He wasnt thinking clearly, all he knew was that something was \non him,\n&gt; and he had to get it off. His powerful legs buckled as he bent \ndown, and\n&gt; then extended with him jumping high into the air, and starting to \nfly,\n&gt; hoping to make his attackers fall off with that. The metal surface \nthat\n&gt; Iron Raptor tore into was starting to corode, her teeth where having\n&gt; problems penetrating the metal, but it was slowly melting away.\n\n\n"}}
