Two of the big branches started bending down with \na cracking sound, but not breaking. Then, four eyes and a gaping mouth \nappeared on the trunk. He roared.\n\nYggdrasil planned to act on intimidation. Since his beast mode was \nbigger than his robot mode, and that he was 13 ft tall as a robot, it \nwould be achievable. But he wanted to add some effect.\n\nHe swung his arms around, breaking the other trees nearby and sending \nthose tumbling down either in front of him or directly at the Rogues.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Gatara&#39;s shots had hit, but they had done no more \nthan light armor damage.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;cardhead649&quot; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;I want them converted to jamming beacons, then we&#39;ll place them at \n&gt; strategic points to knock out all enemy communications and sensor \n&gt; scans,&quot; Devilcat explains.  &quot;Right now, though, we have to resolve \n&gt; some border troubles of our own.
