You can&#39;t post people being knocked out, even\nfor\n&gt; a little while. I don&#39;t know if you wanna rewrite your post, but I&#39;m going\nto\n&gt; respond to before Skulletron ran off. And if you&#39;re going to run out of\nthe\n&gt; bridge, let me respond before you go somewhere in one post. The defences\n&gt; would be firing at you continuoustly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Ramulus/Shredder/Striker/Proto/Chordate/Smokescreen::\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the room, Zardus turns to Sickle, frowning when he saw it as a\nfish.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m Zardus, Alliance commander,&quot; he says to the fish, wondering if his\n&gt; circuits were breaking down, &quot;You are?&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus looks down at SnowCat, grinning as color returns to his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You try flying up there, see how you feel!&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Shredder walks out of the Destron bace and looks at the two new bots,\n&gt; sighing. This was getting on his nerves, the constant interruptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Who are you two?&quot; he asks, looking them over.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Striker paced back and forth in his cell. He had to warn the Maximals, he\n&gt; just had to! He growls, trying to think of a way. He hoped that Ramulus\nwould\n&gt; be smart enough to see through the trap, and to be carefull.\n&gt;\n&gt; Striker frowns at the door, starting to think of something.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Proto looks up at Necromancer. Proto&#39;s chest was melted and leaking\nmechfluid\n&gt; at a quick rate, his left foot looked like it had been slammed with\nsomething\n&gt; big, and there was gashes all over his arms from tree branches.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hey, would you mind giving me a lift too?&quot; he asks. He hated requesting\n&gt; help, but there was no way he&#39;d make it 1000 miles back to base.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Chordate throws himself to the left, Skulletron&#39;s shot shooting off his\near\n&gt; and leaving a leaking, melted spot in his cranium. He jumps forward,\nfeeling\n&gt; a bit dizzy, and spins around, firing two shots at Skulletron.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Smokescreen enters the bridge, instantly pulling out his gun as he sees\nthe\n&gt; battle. He runs inside, firing at Skulletron.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
