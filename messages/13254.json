She \nhad received the transmission from Feline and had deactivated her com-link, \nnow dwelling on just what they needed to take with them to recover the \nmissing bots.\nShe growled low in thought, though, her thoughts were interrupted my the \npresence of Arcangle and his words.\nIron Raptor thought about his question for a moment, turning it around in \nher mind.\nIt was fairly risky to go out and look for the Autobots, half of the problem \nbeing that they didn�t know where they were. And she knew that the Predacons \nOR Alliance would attack any bots that came across their path, making it \nvery dangerous to try and locate something.\nIron Raptor slid off the tabletop and faced the projections of the missing \nMaximals, then turning towards the large window that looked out into the \nlarger of the two Conference Rooms. With a sigh she walked over to the \nwindow and put a hand on the glass, her mind still dwelling on the mission \nat hand but also Arcangels question.\nFinally she came to a conclusion.*\n\n� Yes. But when I get back and not until then.�\n\n* She traced her finger along the glass and tilted her head to the side.*\n\n� The Ark is extremely damaged and needs heavy repair. When I get back I�ll \nsend you out to look for the Autobots, but then half the Maximal forces and \nmyself will begin repairs. I want that ship completely functional before I \neven allow those bots anywhere near it. Understand?�\n\n* Iron Raptor then turned her head and looked over at Arcangel, then turning \nher optics towards Silver Sting and Hot Rod.*\n\n� You two can go with him when I return, if you want. Otherwise you�ll be \nrepairing the Ark with the rest of us. The choice is yours.�\n\n* But then she turned and faced the reflective surface of the window again, \nher finger still tracing invisible lines on the glass. But then she heard \nanother set of footsteps enter the room, softer and more collected�Feline. \nBut then she heard them slow a bit, thinking that it must be her becoming a \nware of the male bots in the room. Something that she would have to get \nover.\nShe then felt the fembots� optics on her, tilting her head to finally see \nFeline approach her.\nBut this time her expression was just as blank as it was when she was \nspeaking to Arcangle, Silver Sting and Hot Rod�but it was a little more \nrelaxed with a kind sense about her. After all, Feline was a little jittery \nabout around the men and she wanted her to feel relaxed around her at \nleast.*\n\n� No. You won�t be going. What I want you to do is set up a small medical \nunit in the CR room for when we get back.  Some of the damage that those two \nbots may have taken might be too extensive for just the CR chambers to \nhandle, and I need you to treat those wounds that the chambers can�t.  Any \nquestions?�\n\n* Iron Raptor then turned back to the window and crossed her arms in front \nof her chest, simply waiting for Feline to ask any questions that she might \nneed to know the answers to.*\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
