I \nrecieved a message from Lunarpine. He wants me to tell the maximals that \nsomething is big and ugly and will arrive here soon. Veratis, you in here?&quot;\n\n\n-OM--------------\n&gt;Lunarpine still didn&#39;t like the monster before him. The freak of nature was\n&gt;the ugliest thing he&#39;d seen since he&#39;d landed. &quot;You still haven&#39;t said why\n&gt;you&#39;re here.&quot; he says stating the obvious.\n&gt;\n&gt;Megaton waved off the wolf like he didn&#39;t exist. &quot;I must be going, I have\n&gt;business at your base.&quot; he turned his back and added &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I meant \n&gt;the\n&gt;Maximals base.&quot; He spread his wings again and flew toward the Cybertronian\n&gt;fires scanning range.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lunarpine transformed to wolf mode and started chaseing the mutant. He\n&gt;opened his mind to Ice, knowing any comm would be intercepted by the \n&gt;monster\n&gt;above.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Ice, if you can hear me, warn the Maximals that something big and ugly \n&gt;with\n&gt;big sharp teeth is flying that way.&quot; He thought, hoping that he was in her\n&gt;range.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
