We are approaching the wormhole. Auto pilot now \ndisengages.\n\nAnd there it was. From afar, the wormhole was an amazing thing, almost \nnot visible without instruments. Yet, the constant slight deformation \nof the visible stars showed there was something after all.\n\nYggdrasil Prime did not want to take time to wonder about that \nthough. To him, it was merely a useless distraction, not any kind of \nwonderful natural phenomenon. He had been sent on a priority mission \nand he was not going to scrap it away at the last moment.\n\nHe took control of the ship and gradually increased the speed. He then \nturned the neutron emittor on.\n\nWormholes were a complex thing. They could lead to millions of \ndifferent places if one was not careful. However, a predacon \nresearcher once discovered that the destination was predetermined by \nthe neutron flow of a ship&#39;s engines, among other variables. The \nBullet id not emit enough, so it used a neutron emittor to bring its \nlevel to the same one as that of the ships it pursued.\n\nYggdrasil entered the wormhole and gripped the controls as good as he \ncould.\n\nSoon afterwards, he was in the Solar System.\n\n\n"}}
