So far \nshe was just telling him things he already knew. He leans forward \nwhen she finishes.\n\n&quot;The planet is, or was, very rich in energon. It attracted the \nattention of Megatron, and a Maximal crew followed him. That crew was \ncarrying stasis pods, and some of those left up in space are still \nfalling to the ground. But war itself attracts warriors, so the \nplanet continues to be a battleground.&quot;\n\nHe glances around the walls for a second. Ironically enough, the \nConference rooms, ideally places for bots to come together and \ncooperate, were the most heavily defended rooms in the Iron Fist, \naside from the engine room and the bridge.\n\n&quot;But how did you get to the planet? When DevilDuer recruited you, he \nsimply found you in a forest, or you found him. There isn&#39;t any \ninformation on how you got here.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Lady Hawk enters the conference room and steps to a table. she \nremains\n&gt; standing waiting for Zardus to follow before taking a seat. &quot;I came \nto this\n&gt; planet because it showed a high concentration of Translife signs. \nfrom what\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen from your records I was correct.&quot;  she pulled her seat \nforward\n&gt; interlocking her mands on the table top. The bot leaned \nforward, &quot;It seemed\n&gt; like a good place to continue DNA research.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to \nreveal her\n&gt; true intentions but could see she was at a disadvantage. Zardus \nseemed to\n&gt; have to sure of himself. The royal bird could see it in his \nmanner. &quot;What is\n&gt; the attraction to this place? it seems to be a graveyard for stasis\n&gt; pods?&quot;she commented hoping to adjust the subject to her advantage.\n\n\n"}}
