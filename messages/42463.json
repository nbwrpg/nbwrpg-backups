I&#39;m\nsorry your losing interest Lurker, and I don&#39;t want you to leave, but\nthe RPG is really slow right now (like people taking days to reply\nsighs, and its not just because of Yan&#39;s absence) and I need people to\nreply before I can do stuff, plus it seems to me last time I gave an\norder to Whee (Sigh), Jume (Sigh), Triggerhappy and Skullgrin, you just\nkinda ignored it. I am glad to be back though, so I have some things to\nsay, and ask.\n\n1. Alloran, when you were gone, Cyclonus was still patroling the skies\naround Azores Islands, so you can land and report to Astrotrain.\nAbominus is in the process of moving a ship, but it can be your turn\nwith the ship. I&#39;m glad to see you back however. I am not sure about\nScourge and Godfather, although I suspect that they are at base. I know\nI don&#39;t always give orders to everyone, but it is hard to keep track on\neverything, so be like Lurker, and jump on me telling me, I am trying my\nbest, but I am only human :)\n\n2. Gnyinhhh, I am now the only council member active (those leaving for\na while shouldnt have run :) another sighhhhhhhhhhh. Well since rAuq is\ngone and he controls so many characters, again it slows the game down,\nso since it is normally against the rules, I am going to ask if it is\nall right with everyone if I control his characters until he gets back\nto keep the game moving. If he dosent so much as peep in a week though,\nwe&#39;ll get rid of them, but if people disagree, then there you have it.\n(I would make a fancysmanshy poll, but somebody who has all the access\nto that has a hurt hand. By the way, heal fast Yan.:) So cast your vote,\nAye, or Nay.\n\n\n3. Gunther, I don&#39;t remember what was going on with the D.E.D, so if you\ncould fill me in privatly.\n\n4. Kslawdogg, what happened to Grimlock/ Nightmare/ Jagged, I don&#39;t\nremember that either.\n\n5. Sorry this was so long, but I thought it was in order, so come on\nguys, help me out now that I am the &quot;Last of the Council&quot; and by the\nway, where are your suggestions on the game and rules and so on, this\ngame is made by us, keep your voices heard, it&#39;s been a pretty slow term\non council with there never being more than two members on regularily,\nmake my life hard :)\n\n"}}
