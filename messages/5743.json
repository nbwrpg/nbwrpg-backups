Megatron is \nwaiting for Panzertron so they can talk. DarkMouse said that she smelled a \ntrap while they were all waiting for Panzertron to appear.  Scorponok stayed \nwith Megatron while DarkMouse went looking around.  The only door she found \nopen was a CR chamber room.  She was headed back to the room where Megatron \nwas when she heard a noise behind a door.  She listened and heard nothing so \nshe porcceded back down the hallway to the room where Megatron and Scorponok \nwere.)\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
