Now there&#39;s some sort of creature out there \nthat acts like it&#39;s feral and a female clone of Dinobot running around!\nWhat&#39;s next, a Predacon that thinks it&#39;s the Tooth Fairy?!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli shook her head but smiled at Carnage&#39;s last comment, this must \nhave been some fight!\nShe trotted up beside the reptile and snickered.*\n\nTeltoli: &quot; Wouldn&#39;t surprise me. Just about anything can happen now.&quot;\n\n*Carnage could just picture it, a Predacon thinking that it WAS the Tooth \nFairy!*\n\nCarnage: &quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me either. I could just see it now, Megatron \nwith a pink too-too!&quot;\n\n* Teltoli laughed, she could see it as well.*\n\nTeltoli: &quot; Yeah! With pink tights and a wand too!&quot;\n\n* The two transformers joked and laughed as the continued their journey \ntowards the Maximal base.\nBesides, every rainstorm had it&#39;s rainbow at the end.*\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
