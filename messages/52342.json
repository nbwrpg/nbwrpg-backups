It transformed \nand landed. We Tripredacus actually consider this a better option than \ncrashing and damaging anything. I will send it back in orbit so that \nit doesn&#39;t even get attacked. However, this will mean that me and my \ncrew will be out of supplies unless Rodimus accepts to shelter us for \nthe duration of the crisis. I can give the order and it would be in \nthe air in no time. It would also provide us with orbital weaponry, \nmostly missiles.\n\nHe seems to regret having to leave his base, but he knows the \nsituation requires it.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Cygnar::\n&gt;        He receives a brief automated signal from his base.  He \ngrimaces and \n&gt; curses at himself for not having expected it.  &quot;They have already \nmoved \n&gt; first.  My base is gone.  Destroyed by it&#39;s own self destruct.  I \nshould&#39;ve \n&gt; seen that coming.&quot;  He shakes his head and looks at Tyrael.  &quot;They \nwill \n&gt; attack you next.  The Maximal&#39;s are going to be their last target.  \nI \n&gt; recommend meeting them between your base and theirs.
