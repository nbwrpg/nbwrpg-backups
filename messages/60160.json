That cargo netting I found was quite \ncomfortable, and good for my back.&quot;\nHe was tired, making the sphere, playing their little drinking game, \nit takes a lot out of a bot.  He figured they would sleep for a while \nand hn get up and mess with their little toy some more.  But \nWolfblade was fond of suprising him.  He though back a few moments, \nto when Wolfblade stumbled.  Was it really instinct that made him \ncatch her?  Or was there something else, something he wouldn&#39;t admit \nto himself.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadowess_azogoth&quot; \n&lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Yeah, cuz I&#39;m on line for a little bit.

It would fit, so he fit it inside and plugged it up with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; cross section he cut.
