She wasn&#39;t calming, even if \nthe Maximals ordered her to. But she never obeyed orders. Not even \nMegatron&#39;s. She went along with it if she was sure he was going to take her \nhead off, but there was on way in the Inferno she was going to follow a low \nMaximals order. She was going to be no longer a follower. She was in charge \nof herself.\n\nShe eyed every one of the Maximals in the room. The weapons in their hands \nweren&#39;t helping her mood, either. She had her back arched and her hands on \nthe door.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t talk,&quot; she replied to Tavatron. &quot;Just get me out of here! Open this \ndoor!&quot;\n\nShe could always try to do it by force, but she wasn&#39;t going to risk the \ndamage. It wasn&#39;t going to do her any good if she was to run out back into \nthe Wild damaged. That was a rule.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
