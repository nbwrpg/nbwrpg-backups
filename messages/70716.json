They sw=\r\nung around and oriented on the shuttle, thier sensors\nscanning over it for =\r\na moment, and then, as if noting the ship&#39;s\nlocation and intent, the jets b=\r\negan to move off, banking over to\ncontinue on their flight over and around =\r\nthe outside edge of the city.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked out at the city.=A0 Al=\r\nthough he was a Predecon, he&#39;d never really felt comfortable here.=A0 The b=\r\nase felt like home, but in the city outside, he was never sure from day-to-=\r\nday whether he was going to be welcomed or stabbed in the back.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe=\r\n city looked almost dim with all the soot and debris that coated\nit. Worker=\r\n drones moved along its streets transporting natural ores\nfrom one place to=\r\n another. Much of the city was dark, littered with\ndark allyways, dead end =\r\nstreets and dark pockets where neferious deals\nof all sorts could take plac=\r\ne.\n\nA few twin rotored helicoptors rose up over the city, thier watchful\nbe=\r\nams straying over the darker alleys. The curious thing is that these\nchoppe=\r\nrs, like the jets, registered as security and as Predacon, but\nthere was no=\r\n Bushido IFF codes coming from them, they were definitly\nsomething else. Al=\r\nso like the jets, the choppers paid little attention\nto the incomming shutt=\r\nle. Something interesting was happening in the\ncity, even the criminal elem=\r\nent was becoming more unified, more\nfocused.\n\n(TAG)\n\n&gt; OOC: So if they&#39;re s=\r\necurity forces, wouldn&#39;t they be Bushido Predecon NPC&#39;s?=A0 Or have local c=\r\nrime syndicates formed patrol squads.=A0 Anyway, I don&#39;t need an answer, ju=\r\nst musing.\n\nOOC: No problem, I appreciate the input, your knowledge of this=\r\n city\nis larger than mine. I am just running off my own imagination. I am\nu=\r\nnsure if you guys had fleshed anything out here.\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
