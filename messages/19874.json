She looke at Megatron \nand smiled a warm smile. &quot;May our paths lead where they may. Thank \nyou Megatron. Thank you Aracnia. We shall seal the pack and become \nthe new council on earth.&quot; She smiled and looked up at Megatron. &quot;We \ncan attack as soon as you and Aracnia have your troops in order, we \ncan all leave crush the Allience, then the maximals.&quot; She grinned a \nbit. &quot;Megatron, when you are ready come to my base and we will leave \nfrom there. I thank you again.&quot; she smiled and bowed to Megatron.  \nThen she turned to Aracnia. &quot;Bring your troops to my base and we will \nattack at once.&quot; She bowed to Aracnia. &quot;I thank you both for joining \nme on this great day.&quot;\n\nShe turned and started to leave and head back to her base.  She \nturned off her commlink and smiled. She was very pleased with what \nhad happened.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron had to decide.....ally with the Allience, one of the \nmost \n&gt; influencial and power factions, or remain with the Predacons and \nhelp them \n&gt; become the ultimate power on this planet. He looked up to the sky, \nas if it \n&gt; held the answer....\n&gt;     &quot;Kitkat, I belive I have just made a descicion that will change \nmy life, \n&gt; how ever long it may be.....&quot; He trailed off, without saying his \nlittle catch \n&gt; phrase. &quot;So be it, the Predacons will rule this planet. The \nAllience shall \n&gt; fall before us, just as the Maximals will be crushed under the heel \nof our \n&gt; boot. The Iron fist of Predacon rule has been long missed. It is \ntime for us \n&gt; to take hold of this planet...once and for all. Yes.....&quot; \n&gt;     Megatron now smiled. As did Aracnia. Three forces, together at \nlast, that \n&gt; will see the downfall of two empires, and several pathetic factions \nthat \n&gt; should have been weeded out long ago.\n&gt;     &quot;Now that things are settled, when shall we take on the \nAllience? my \n&gt; troops can be ready and mobil in less than an hour. &quot;Aracnia said, \nletting \n&gt; her claw slide across her womb, filled with another bos spark.\n\n\n"}}
