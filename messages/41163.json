Heh I dunno what&#39;s\n&gt;going to happen with alecto with the water pressure and all but that\n&gt;is another matter.. although Yan(I think, may have been someone else,\n&gt;rauq possibly?) did say she would be crushed by the pressure earlier,\n&gt;but its not my char so I can&#39;t say anything about it.\n&gt;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
