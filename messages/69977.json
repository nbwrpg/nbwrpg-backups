And I&#39;m sure Rodimus would=\r\n be really interested in tryn&#39; ta take down Tucson Prime, that&#39;s if you guy=\r\ns got enough back bone ta do it.  Keep in mind, he&#39;s got as much strength a=\r\ns Optimus Prime, and that ain&#39;t nothn&#39; ta sneeze at.&quot;\n\nWhile keeping in Dec=\r\nepticon code, he tries to open his Autobot channel to Lord Elder, keeping h=\r\nim informed of his progress.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras/Perceptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Like what, Nightshift?&quot;hissed maliciou=\r\ns Hydras while he came in and sit down in his trone &quot;Like what information=\r\n=A1?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ********************\n&gt; \n&gt; Perceptor finished to reprogram Nightl=\r\night, and he waited that she woke up \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Sandy \n&gt; Sent: Monday, =\r\nApril 05, 2010 8:33 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: BlackFo=\r\nrtress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Nightshift watches Scorponok.
