Suddenly he felt a slight tremble and soon the \ntrembling became \n&gt; a punding, which then became a booming like thunder... He slowly \nturned to see \n&gt; a gigantic pair of teeth reflecting his own face back at him, \nstartled he \n&gt; fell backwards as grimlock in his new form roared loud enough to \nsend a ripple \n&gt; through the sheild... The dino looked over the bots until his eyes \nfell on \n&gt; Jackie... He transformed and placed a hand against the sheild. In \nhis robot form \n&gt; his chest and head looked the same as the old dino-bot, but \neverything else had \n&gt; been updated, hydrolics, and muscle like cables intertwined around \nparts of \n&gt; his arms and the rex&#39;s tail was stiff and lance like in his \nhand. &quot;WheelJack?&quot; \n&gt; The bot looked at him, but shook his head and transformed back into \nthe Dino \n&gt; and lowered himself growling to their eye level. &quot;Leave... or you \nwill be \n&gt; destroyed.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
