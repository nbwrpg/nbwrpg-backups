I&#39;m sick and tired of this \nquestion simply being shrugged off (unless I missed the post in which \ncase I apologize)!  Now if you people simply can&#39;t remember this \nlet&#39;s review.  I left a while back.  I said that Cardhead could have \nFlicker, and Winged Warrior could have Owlhawk.  I came back.  \nCardhead told me she couldn&#39;t remember where Flicker was, but hadn&#39;t \nposted with him in a week so I could take over from whereever I \nwanted too.  Winged Warrior said roughly the same thing about \nOwlhawk, except he failed to mention whether or not he had even used \nOwlhawk, and for that matter if Owlhawk had finished his training \nwith the Mech girl.  Now FOR PETE&#39;S SAKE TELL ME!\n\n\n"}}
