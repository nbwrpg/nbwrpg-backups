She set her glass down and went to the \nbridge.  She walked in and looked at Prebon. She nodded to him and \nstood against the wall, waitng to hear what prebon had to say.  She \nalso thought that is Slayer was going to give her trouble, she might \nwant to stay out of his way for a while. Untill he got used to the \nidea that she was going to be around and here to stay no matter what \nSlayer thought or wanted.  She folded her arms across her chest and \nleaned against the wall.  She lowered her head and went deep into \nthought.  She wanted to tell Slayer who he was and where he had come \nfrom.  But prebon had ordered her not to speak a word of it to him. \nShe closed her eyes and felt the chip straighten out her programs. \nShe now felt like she had to focus on the mission and what Prebon \nwold order her to do.  Not worry about trivial problems like old \nfriends.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream responded to Phobia.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re on our way.&quot; He turned to the Lavacons, &quot;Come with me!
