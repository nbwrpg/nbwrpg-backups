She sighed. There were\n&gt; jsut the tree of them. She turned to Veratis.&quot;Uh, what will happen to\n&gt; the bots that currently exist? I mean, will the maximals and\n&gt; predacons simply, er, go exstinct?&quot; She had left friends behind in\n&gt; the maximal camps. She still had hopes of seeing them again, someday.\n&gt;\n&gt; She looked down at her clips board and at her notes from the class.\n&gt; She was hoping that Veratis wouldn&#39;t say what she thought he would\n&gt; say. She kept her mind closed and waited to hear the answer.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Veratis turned and hesitated for a moment before\n&gt; answering, &quot;Whatever the\n&gt; &gt; matrix has in store for you is what happens.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lunarpine wasn&#39;t convinced, &quot;And what will happen to the bots that\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; change?&quot; he asked in a pessamistic tone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;They will either join us and become what we are or perish in the\n&gt; &gt; transition. Veratis had the same determined look on his face like\n&gt; when he&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; told Lunarpine about the prophecy of Prime the first time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
