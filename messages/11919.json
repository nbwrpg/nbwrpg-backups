In\n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; right fist he clenched a bladeless hilt, with a flick of a button his\n&gt; &gt; energon sword flared to life, humming warmly in his fingers. The other\n&gt; &gt; object was much like a door sheild yet the main face of it was empty\nuntil\n&gt; &gt; it too was turned on, an energy sheild filling the gaps to provide\n&gt; &gt; protection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Xiane arrived just as Spears was blasted from her spot behind the\n&gt; metal\n&gt; &gt; plate, kneeling down he examined the bot. &quot;Hail to thee m&#39;lady, it seems\nI\n&gt; &gt; find myself on a battlefeild yet know not the very sides I face.

She glided in right between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the shots. They miss her by centimeters.  She flies closer and uses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her talons to scratch the cockpit glass as she turns and flies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; straight upwards in a right angle to Dark One.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Lord Unitron&quot; &lt;KSLawdogg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dark One/Hiss:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He cursed as a spear dug into his left side, though, it hit no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vital\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parts.

He was now upside down, facing Shadow Wing.  He opened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a barrage of 5 rapid laser bolts, not wanting to use up to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy to take out such a simple target.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
