Drillbit, Atma and \n&gt; Starscream all want KitKat. All out war in Pred ranks.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream, still carrying Phobia, went around the debris. The heat \n&gt; was getting intense, the flames getting larger and the ship nearing a \n&gt; crash that would kill any onboard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Computer:&quot;Heat Overload Iminant. Reverting to stasis lock..\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Delay that! Put all weapons power towards Heat Tolerence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Computer:&quot;Transfering.......Crisis averted.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Finaly Starscream made it to the escape hatch. He put Phobia down and \n&gt; went to Jet Mode. He than asked forgiveness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sorry to scare you for this, Phobia, but it&#39;s the only way.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream than nudged Phobia out of the ship and sent her falling he \n&gt; immediatly dove after him, got under, opened the cockpit and let him \n&gt; fall in. He closed it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There we are. All safe and sound.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream didn&#39;t know how wrong he was. Just as the was about to go \n&gt; and join the others, The ship hit the ground, causing what was eft of \n&gt; the cargo and fuel to explode in a vicious fury. Starscream, with \n&gt; Phobia inside him, was still very close to the blast. Most of his \n&gt; armor was incinerated, and he was thrown against a stone wall into \n&gt; stasis lock. Before he went it was his only hope that the cockpit had \n&gt; protected Phobia enough to give a help signal, or the Preds would \n&gt; think they died in the blast.\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Gotron\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotron headed back to the base on Zardus&#39; orders.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
