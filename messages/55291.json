In the original Tranformers series, when\n&gt; Bumblebee is talking with Daniel (or is it Spike?), he says he \nmisses\n&gt; his creator, and that she was gentle, or something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: So many debates on this subject i go through on forums. The\n&gt; general agreement is that by the Beast Wars era TFs have evolved to\n&gt; the point where they can do this. They no longer need Vector Sigma \nto\n&gt; give life. It makes a lot of sense though. TFs have always been \nsaid\n&gt; to evolve, and they mimic humans in every other way. The only \nthing is\n&gt; that Airly had Nightlight actually give birth to the child. Most\n&gt; people speculate that TFs would merge their programming, or copies \nof\n&gt; their sparks when having sex. This creates a new spark for the \nchild\n&gt; that is carried by the mother. Then a body is built to put the \nspark\n&gt; in, or a protoform can be used.\n&gt; &gt;  CatMaster o &lt;catmastero@y...&gt; wrote:--- In \nnbwrpg@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Well Roddy and Nightlight did the bad *cough good cough* \nthing\n&gt; &gt; and ended up with this daughter.
