She knew that she was \n&gt; outnumbered\n&gt; &gt; and overpowered. She&#39;d let her gaurd down one to many times. Now \n&gt; was the\n&gt; &gt; time for the tough act. &quot;Squizzy wanted credit for my expriments, \nI \n&gt; had to\n&gt; &gt; do to her before she did to me.&quot; She squirmed a little moire \ntrying \n&gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; at least her wings uncramped. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have done the same \nif \n&gt; someone\n&gt; &gt; wanted to steal your technology.&quot;  Lady Hawk was playing on \nZardus&#39; \n&gt; logic to\n&gt; &gt; escape this situation. &quot;I came to you alone and with technology \n&gt; that could\n&gt; &gt; help you in your goals.&quot; Logic dictated that she&#39;d be stupid to \n&gt; challenge\n&gt; &gt; the alliance one on all. &quot;Now that I&#39;ve answered you would you \n&gt; release me\n&gt; &gt; and at least grant me the dignitty of walking on my own two feet?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- &quot;But you have two wingssss to fly too... &quot;Replied Najah, nd \n&gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; t Zardus &quot;Excusssss me Ssssir... if the birdie try to fly over the\n&gt; &gt; cage, can I kill her????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again Lady Hawk looked to logic for an answer. &quot;I&#39;m a hawk, of \n&gt; course I can\n&gt; &gt; fly&quot; She was really feeling offended now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zardus nods, &quot;Of course. But she wont try to escape, not if she \n&gt; wants\n&gt; &gt; to live.&quot;, &quot;Correct?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lady hawk thought the question was redundant. &quot; Wher would I go?&quot; \n&gt; She knew\n&gt; &gt; that at 100 percent she could probably outfly any member of the \n&gt; alliance.\n&gt; &gt; But with her injuries she&#39;d either be caught or lead them back to \n&gt; Veratis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;Yanshosh@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, November 06, 2000 5:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Najah bites at Lady Hawk\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m running into some trouble in my personal life right now, so \nI \n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a bit of an irregular posting rate. I&#39;ll either post \nobsessively \n&gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; away\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from my life or a bit less than ussual cause I got so many \nthings \n&gt; I need\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take care of.

Zardus looks back to Lady Hawk, &quot;Now, what were you \n&gt; doing to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squizzy?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Havoc stops, nearing the flying portions of the Alliance base. \n&gt; For some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reason they had slowed, continuing ahead slowly. He activates \nhis \n&gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computers, tapping into the computer of one of the shuttles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He nods, looking through the info he got back. The cargo \nsection \n&gt; was a bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too heavy for the shuttle carrying it, so they had to slow for \n&gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; Another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle from the Iron Fist was on its way to soon help.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He sighs, flying ahead to the Iron Fist.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
