Im glad we are allowed pleasentrese. He \nwatched as the bot zoomed at him. He waited and waited until the bot was \nclose enough.. (6ft) The green jewel on his chest glowed. He jumed up and did \na mid air tuck and roll. The bot was still at full speed and wouldnt be able \nto adjust in time. He was above the bot he did a straight drop kick with full \nthruster speed about five feet from the bot. His flame sword was pulled \nstraight down on the bots right arm.. His tail about 8 ft long. Shot  \nunderneath the bot&#39;s stomach and shot up. He was only 5 ft from the bot. This \nwas done at an incredible pace. This move wasnt made to do sever damage but a \nspecial one. As the tail went for the bots left arm his flame energy  shot \nstraight down at the bots  head. His green jewel turned off and shot  out a \nblast about 5 feet in width and 5 in length.\n\n"}}
