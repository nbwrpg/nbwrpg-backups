The voice obviously belonged to Fumeral, but the footsteps were not heavy as Fumeral&#39;s had been.  Celeron reached around to his back to grab his rifle...which he hadn&#39;t worn in years.  He charged up both guns and got ready to cover his exit.\n\n&quot;I WARNED YOU!&quot;\n\n&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;\n\n&quot;WHAT!  SHOW YOURSELF!&quot;\n\n&quot;I RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU.&quot;\n\nA red targeting laser swept over the room again.  Celeron nervously knocked over a small box that was on the crate next to him!\n\n&quot;Fumeral!  Don&#39;t try any of your tricks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really....&quot;\n\nThe voice was right behind the crate he was hiding next to.  Celeron decided now would be an excellent time to relocate.\n\nCeleron scrambled toward where he had heard the footsteps, maybe a little to the right.  Then crouched behind an electrical box near the office.\n\n&quot;Fumeral,  I need you to come quietly.  I&#39;m arresting you.   There is nowhere for you to hide.&quot;\n\n&quot;On the contrary.  We are no longer in space, we are in a desert on some unknown planet.  I believe it is YOU that are at a disadvantage.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alright.  Fumeral, you are a no good criminal.  Either I arrest you or kill you.  But I cannot let you go back to your syndicate or start new crime.&quot;\n\n&quot;So BE IT!  ARRRRG!&quot;\n\nFumeral stood up and began to spray the room with his chainguns.  He stoped, reloaded, and waited.\n\nCeleron slipped into the office, finding that the room was actually an air tight room; he sealed himself in it.  The figure opposed to Fumeral looked up and noticed Celeron as he sealed himself in.  Fumeral looked over as well.  Celeron turned off the light, the room no longer had any light.\n\nThe air tight room was silent and soundproof.  Two targeting laser&#39;s swept the room and then thousands of bright flashes of light filled both  sides of the room.  They stoped.  And some energy weapons discharged.  Fumeral fired a missle, responded to by a volley of cannon fire, responded to by another missle and a granade.\n\nThe fight was over.  Fumeral had won, and he knew exactly where Celeron was.  Celeron, found a back door leading out into the hallway and slipped into a random darkened room.  Fumeral came charging down the hall, but was unable to locate Fumeral, and in a few minutes abandoned the search.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nGet 25MB, POP3, Spam Filtering with LYCOS MAIL PLUS for $19.95/year.\nhttp://login.mail.lycos.com/brandPage.shtml?pageId=plus&ref=lmtplus\n\n"}}
