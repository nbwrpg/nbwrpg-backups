Hades transformed into his 30 ft long mutant worm mode, this mode \ngenetically altered to dig through things.\n\n(Interesting note, Hades being the ancient Greek god of death, is a worm in \nthis, usually worms help to break down flesh on rotting corpses).  Lifting up \ninto the air on a section of itself, Hades smashed into the ground in his \ncurrent mode, easily drilling through the ground.\n\nSixshot transformed to his ramming tank mode, smashing against the blocked \ncave easily.  Rocks cracked, a third of the way through.  Activating his \nflame throwers, he fired, letting rocks slowly crumble, relatively quickly \nbreaking through with superior firepower.\n\nSerpentor transformed to his 30 ft long snake mode, slowly following Hades.\n\nUnitron transformed to his jet fighter mode, getting a lock and firing two \nmissiles after Sixshot had moved, blowing a hole in the blocked cave after \nother missiles had hit.  A 3 ft high, 5 ft wide hole in the cliff was broken \nopen.  \n\n"}}
