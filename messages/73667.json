They were a little outside\nimmediate scanning range, and it would only be a deliberate effort to\nscan the location that would easily reveal their location.\n\nThey were reasonably safe so long as the proper precautions were kept.\n\nRIPPERSNAPPER and BLOT disappeared near to the cave, presumably they\nwere digging.\n\nOff to one side a human was kneeling in the brush, then a second,\nlooking at the PREDACONS, but neither of them daring to move. Two\nmales.\n\nThey gestured to each other and then made to back away, hoping to stay\nunnoticed.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There, far away, stealted over was BLACKARACHNIA, who gazed over at the\n&gt; ARK..  &quot;oh, to be alone for a day..&quot;  Stroking at her chin, wishing she\n&gt; still had her access codes and overrides to it from so long ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; And so she went, giving her &#39;report&#39; to TARANTALUS and slinking over towards\n&gt; the underside of the heavily retrofitted VANGUARD class craft.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTARANULUS accepted the report, at least a recording of it was taken.\nIt is apparent that he was otherwise engaged, perhaps dealing with\nANTAGONY.\n\nAnd as far as BLACKARAKNIA&#39;S override codes, yes they all been taken\nfrom her by TARANULUS, but she was more than skilled enough to learn\nnew ones . . . or perhaps have some secreted away somewhere that she\ncould recover.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
