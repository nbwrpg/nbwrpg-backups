When \n&gt; you control chars in seperate factions and they get into a fight with \n&gt; each other you have to play them how you would play them if they were \n&gt; fighting a seperate faction. Just because your chars hate each other \n&gt; doesnt mean you have to kill the chars of one faction off. Thats just \n&gt; plain dumb its like saying &quot;Oh, I like this faction so all these guys \n&gt; have to die now because I cant handle them attacking each other.&quot; \n&gt; Look at Yan, he has the alliance against the Maximals, he doesnt go \n&gt; around killing his alliance chars and maximal chars simply because \n&gt; they cant or wont coexist. ou should try to do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Okay, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s the truth. My characters could not \n&gt; co-exist in the same faction like that, ad then what? Make them act \n&gt; unrealistic? To keep them in character of course the Mafia would \n&gt; attack the Chivtrons, and then  who would I have die? As much as I \n&gt; like them, my Chivtrons would end up dying. It&#39;s not a threat, \n&gt; honest, I&#39;m just pointing out what would really happen.

Now, for the (hopefully) final \n&gt; commant on this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   First of all: Soulstice, that was just plain cheap. Its threats \n&gt; like those that make people not want people&#39;s chars in their \n&gt; faction. &quot;If you do this, I&#39;ll kill off my chars on your side&quot; is \n&gt; exactly what makes faction commanders begin to rely on your chars \n&gt; less and less, resulting in them being ignored.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Second of all: as Gunthers said, quit trying to predict what the \n&gt; Alliance is gonna do. You&#39;re all wrong so far anyways.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; OOC: I did a poll.
