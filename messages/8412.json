Zardus is firing at Kambodia, not\nZergling.\n&gt; You said that you fired on Zergling in one of your posts, but Zergling is\nnot\n&gt; at the battlefield. Zardus is.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Zardus/Hiss/Scavanger/DevilDuer::\n&gt;\n&gt; Zardus ducks easily under the rockets, looking Kamodia over. She wouldn&#39;t\nbe\n&gt; a challenge, he funally decides, jumping up into the air and firing at\nher.\n&gt; From the corner of his eyes he sees Soundwave arrive. Zardus flies over to\n&gt; him, firing another shot at Kamodia.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We are a bit busy right now,&quot; he says, firing yet another shot, &quot;Your\nhelp\n&gt; would be greatly apreciated...&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Hiss turns quickly, Arcangel&#39;s blade slasing inches away from his chest.\n&gt; Reaching out to quickly grab the Maximal&#39;s arm, Hiss brings his knee up,\n&gt; attempting to break the arm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scavanger ducks under the missiles, flying back up in a spiral, trying to\n&gt; make himself hard to hit as he fires again from his rifle at Icedragon.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer&#39;s eyes widen as he sees the shots coming at him. He jumps to the\n&gt; right, the shots riddling his left leg. The Alliance member growls as he\nhits\n&gt; the ground, rolling to his feet to fire a shot at Shocker from his pistol.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
