She typed  some buttons in order to block at Blaze \nthe access to the computer. She typed some buttons more and eight \nmechanical craws appeared and took each leg and wrists of the femmes \nin order to that they couldn&#39;t do anything against her plans.\n\nShe typed some buttons and a sort of gun appeared. This gun shot 3 \ndarts to each femme that would do them sleep a long time.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Blaze looked back toward Silver Scout, &quot;They know we&#39;re here.&quot; she \nsmelled\n&gt; the gas, &quot;I could reopen the doors but we don&#39;t know what&#39;s on the \nother\n&gt; side.&quot; she thought fast. &quot;Well Shivah let&#39;s play for a while.&quot; \nuseing her\n&gt; advanced computer knowledge she accessed the gas control and shut \noff the\n&gt; valve to the room, and sent a false signal that the gas was still \nrunning.\n&gt; &quot;Lets see how you like it.&quot; typeing in more codes she opened a \nvalve near\n&gt; the terminal where Kali was. Again she turned to Silver Scout. &quot;Lay \ndown and\n&gt; close your eyes.&quot; Transforming to tigress she layed down and did \nthe same.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh I see.&quot; Silver Scout replied, &quot;Join the Predacons, learn to \nplay dead.&quot;\n&gt; she lay down on her side near the far wall and closed her eyes as \nshe was\n&gt; instructed.\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;airly2000@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 06, 2001 10:56 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: others\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; sHIVAH/KALI/lUZBEL/aTTILLA:::\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shivah noticed that someone was playing with the controls and  he\n&gt; &gt; typed some buttons inorder to stop Razorclaw and Ender before they\n&gt; &gt; could escape. Next he send a commands to his brothers  in order to\n&gt; &gt; stop Razorcraws and Ender.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kali typed some buttons and two wall slided in each side of the\n&gt; &gt; corritor where Silver Scout and Blaze were. Next the femme, \npushed a\n&gt; &gt; button and a gas started to araise where Silverscout and Blaze \nwere,\n&gt; &gt; that gas would made them sleep a large time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blaze and Silver Scout continued wandering back toward Shivahs\n&gt; &gt; location when Silver Scout picked up a scent. &quot;Foxfingers?&quot; the \nscent\n&gt; &gt; was strong, like he was close. &quot;Kit Kat and Drillbit were with \nhim,\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s in trouble.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The tigress travelling with the wolf transformed to get a better\n&gt; &gt; whif of what the mutant was smelling. &quot;He&#39;s caught, there&#39;s \nnothing\n&gt; &gt; we can do.&quot; she had given up hope of escape. By now her computer\n&gt; &gt; access was probably cut off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We have to save him, I owe my creator that much.&quot; the wolf \nstarted\n&gt; &gt; off in the direction but was quickly stopped.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Then fine, you won&#39;t die alone.&quot; Even without her computer \naccess\n&gt; &gt; she could still help, if she couldn&#39;t hack the computer then she\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t worth the function her motherboard was printed on. &quot;I&#39;ll \nsee\n&gt; &gt; what I can do.&quot; the tigress transformed back to her bot mode. The\n&gt; &gt; virus was taking effect eact time she transformed back she could \nfeel\n&gt; &gt; it impedeing her transformation. Quickly accessing a computer\n&gt; &gt; terminal she learned that Razor Claw and Ender were still\n&gt; &gt; trapped. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can&#39;t cause a little confusion around \nhere.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; soon after the door opened giveing the two bots an escape route.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
