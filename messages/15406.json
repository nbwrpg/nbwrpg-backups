He was going to find Iron Raptor, and then he was going to \napologize.\n\nAfter thinking it over in his quarters, he decided that it was best to just \nsay sorry. He couldn&#39;t bear not being able to touch his love, and if \napologizing would solve the problem, he&#39;d just have to swallow his pride.\n\nHe rounds a corner in time to see Iron Raptor touching Hot Rod on the arm, a \nwave of jealousy washing over him. He narrows his eyes, walking up to Iron \nRaptor.\n\n&quot;Hello, love,&quot; he says, glancing from her to Hot Rod.\n\n"}}
