His blade meets Grimlock&#39;s blade as he =\r\nangles the Katana to catch the oncoming sword with the sharp side of his ow=\r\nn weapon. Yet the move was only to defend himself not swing out towards the=\r\nm.  The Dinobots may be relentless but if there is a land and defenseless c=\r\nreatures being tormented by intruders, the Silver Dragon will not rest unti=\r\nl the tormentors are brought to justice!   True to his nature, Tucson gives=\r\n it his all to defend his turf.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; You leave me no choice but to figh=\r\nt back!   AND FIGHT I WILL!&quot;\n&gt; \n\nOOC - Just commenting, Sandy, this is read=\r\ning a bit like overkill to me.  Tuscon has been under four rounds of attack=\r\n from all five Dinobots, and has not taken a single hit.  He&#39;s dodged, bloc=\r\nked, or evaded more than fifteen to twenty attacks in the combat posts you&#39;=\r\nve had back and forth, which even for a skilled warrior would be near impos=\r\nsible to do.  Even Megatron was stalemated in direct combat wtih Grimlock, =\r\nand up against all five Dinobots Optimus Prime nearly died.  And Tuscon her=\r\ne is handling them all effortlessly, as you&#39;ve put into your postgs not eve=\r\nn trying to fight back.  I&#39;m not speaking as a mod, but this is getting a b=\r\nit silly as to how he&#39;s able to endlessly avoid every single attack they to=\r\nss his way, and they&#39;re one of the most potent teams the Autobots had as fa=\r\nr as fighting well and together went.\n\n\n"}}
