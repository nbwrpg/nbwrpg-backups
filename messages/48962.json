As the number of Maximals converging\n&gt; on his location \n&gt; increases, his frown deepens. \n&gt; \n&gt; Spotting the insolent Maximal who had hit him with a\n&gt; laser, Kup, he \n&gt; fires two missiles at the bot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sunhawk&#39;s laser shots scream past Megatron, one\n&gt; hitting him in the \n&gt; chest, another charring his arm and almost causing\n&gt; him to drop \n&gt; Warhead. Distracted by Sunhawks shots, Kup&#39;s laser\n&gt; blast hits him in \n&gt; the side of the head, disabling his left optic, and\n&gt; damaging his \n&gt; right one fairly severly. Megatron spots Hot Rod\n&gt; aiming and firing, \n&gt; and he quickly moves Warhead&#39;s unmoving form infront\n&gt; of him to \n&gt; intercept the weaponfire, &quot;Grr, at least he proved\n&gt; useful,&quot; mutters \n&gt; Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing an opertunity, he leaps into the air,\n&gt; throwing Warhead above \n&gt; him, then transforms into Dragon mode, catching\n&gt; Warhead with his \n&gt; clawed legs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
