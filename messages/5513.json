He wondered how she \ndid that. &quot;Be careful.&quot; He turned his shoulder and walked to his sleeping \nspot. He laid down on his side and watched the shadows in the cave. His head \nand optics grew heavy with the desire for sleep within seconds. He wasn&#39;t \ngoing to fight it. His fatiguenss was odd. He wasn&#39;t sure what to make of \nit. He saw the blanket he once had wrapped around his tail when he woke up. \nHe reached for it and put it over his body. He drew his legs up and tightly \nbunched his arms. He used his arms as a pillow.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;ilovealllizards&quot; &lt;ilovealllizards@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Sat, 1 Jul 2000 23:59:03 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;Stingtra: Well...I guess I fell on a stick. *Stingtra says as she pulls the\n&gt;stick out of her stomich and mech fluid pours out* Stingtra: Umm.....you \n&gt;run\n&gt;along.

Maybe she didn&#39;t like him. Maybe she did, and \n&gt;didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to show it. Quickstrike was dumbfounded about it.

He went back to the shore and ate both of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Afterwards he transformed to his robot mode and jogged back to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Predacon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cave.
