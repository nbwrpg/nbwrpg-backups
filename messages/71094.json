He\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; uses s=\r\nharp hearing to pick up the smallest of sounds, even those deemed to\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\nbe completely silent. He pays close attention to how the ground seems to\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; vibrate under his feet, giving him indication that although hidden, he\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; could\n  &gt; &gt; tell where his opponent was. He slowly brings Straight Sh=\r\not around. With\n  &gt; &gt; one of his arms injured, he had to do things in rever=\r\nse. With the good arm,\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; hold the weight of his weapon, and with =\r\nthe bad arm, pull the trigger. He\n  &gt; &gt; had often practiced alternating bet=\r\nween his hands, and was glad he had done\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous=\r\n was an attribute. He loads an arrow specifically\n  &gt; &gt; designed to be barb=\r\ned and most difficult to remove. He knew that it was\n  &gt; &gt; better just to d=\r\nisable his enemy rather than destroy him. He needed\n  &gt; &gt; Nightrazor for qu=\r\nestioning. Most effective area of targeting, would be the\n  &gt; &gt; knee joint =\r\nImbed the arrow in a joint and his opponent would find it most\n  &gt; &gt; diffic=\r\nult to abmulate, yet it would not kill or destroy him.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Now with=\r\nin striking distance, as determined by his sonar sensors, he sends\n  &gt; &gt; ou=\r\nt short pulse emissions to pinpoint his area of targeting. His reading is\n =\r\n &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; quick, yet, anything could happen at this point. He aims, and at=\r\ntempts to\n  &gt; &gt; launch an arrow deep into his enemy&#39;s knee, if his calculat=\r\nions were\n  &gt; &gt; correct.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &quot;Steady Straight Shot.

He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; uses sharp hearing \n  to pick up the smallest of sounds, even =\r\nthose deemed to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be \n  completely silent. He pays close attenti=\r\non to how the ground seems to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; vibrate under his feet, givin=\r\ng him indication that although hidden, \n  he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; tell where his opponent was. He slowly \n  brings Straight Shot around. Wi=\r\nth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one of his arms injured, he had \n  to do things in reverse.=\r\n With the good arm,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hold the \n  weight of his wea=\r\npon, and with the bad arm, pull the trigger. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  had often p=\r\nracticed alternating between his hands, and was glad he had \n  done&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous was an attribute. He \n  loads an =\r\narrow specifically&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; designed to be barbed and most \n  difficult=\r\n to remove. He knew that it was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; better just to disable \n  his =\r\nenemy rather than destroy him. He needed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightrazor for \n  que=\r\nstioning. Most effective area of targeting, would be the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; knee =\r\n\n  joint Imbed the arrow in a joint and his opponent would find it most&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n  &gt; difficult to abmulate, yet it would not kill or destroy him.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now within striking distance, as determined by =\r\nhis sonar \n  sensors, he sends&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; out short pulse emissions to pi=\r\nnpoint his area \n  of targeting. His reading is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; q=\r\nuick, yet, anything \n  could happen at this point. He aims, and attempts to=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; launch an \n  arrow deep into his enemy&#39;s knee, if his calcula=\r\ntions were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  correct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Steady Strai=\r\nght Shot. We need to make this \n  count.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Straigh=\r\nt Shot programs her mechanisms for \n  optimal effeciency.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &quot; Talk about a shot in the dark. \n  Okay, let&#39;s do this.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the Ark, Night Shift \n  quickly scrambles around =\r\nthe enemy fire,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; brought upon by the \n  Sweeps and is quick to =\r\ncover Rat Trap who is also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; trying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; to ellude th=\r\nem as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Woah!

He had dealt with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; intru=\r\nders of the dark many times, and being visually impaired, he \n  knew&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; how&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to unlock their secrets of steath.

I sense&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; \n  this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; enemy is much like myself, and instead o=\r\nf putting \n  Uproar and Leo ll in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grave&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n danger, I will \n  take on the intruder personally. He has crossed the line=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; my envronment, and it&#39;s time he pays =\r\nthe price by someone \n  who is as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; versed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in =\r\nstealth as he is. I ask you \n  to call back Uproar and Leo ll to prevent&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; further harm to \n  them.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; His optics narrow.

I will&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; send&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; them a message.
