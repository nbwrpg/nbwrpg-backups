With a brave fac=\r\ne, he stands firm and ready to take on his challenger.  Yet while he does s=\r\no he casually shifts a foot across the ground and dislodges a fairly good s=\r\nized stone of diamond like volcanic rock.  He crouches down to pick it up. =\r\n Slowly Tucson rises to his feet.  He playfully handles the stone for a mom=\r\nent or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Size isn&#39;t everything, Magmatron.  Sometimes the most suc=\r\ncessful warriors are no bigger than I am.  Yet you may not understand what =\r\nI&#39;m telling you because these were the words of Yoketron.  And I&#39;m not abou=\r\nt to divulge any of his secrets to the likes of you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He turns away fo=\r\nr a moment, as if not about to do anything.  He takes a step back but then,=\r\n he takes a running start, and a quick leap in the air followed by a very q=\r\nuick toss of the stone in an attempt to strike Magmatron in one of his eyes=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; The stone flies at bullet speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t be envious of what you d=\r\non&#39;t have, be grateful for things you already posses.

It was only his\n&gt; &gt; recent memories, the ones after they had rescued ROD=\r\nIMUS that last\n&gt; &gt; time from HYDRAS that seemed to differ.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also th=\r\ne MAXIMALS that NIGHLIGHT were saying were dead were beginning\n&gt; &gt; to stir.=\r\n Perhaps they were not dead but were only in a deep stasis\n&gt; &gt; lock.

As MAGMATRON =\r\nhad geown to nealry 20&#39; in height, his sword was\n&gt; &gt; nearly as tall as TUSC=\r\nON himself was! &quot;Come, come and taste death!&quot; he\n&gt; &gt; swung the sword menaci=\r\nngly!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile DARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS fought seemingly obliviou=\r\ns to the\n&gt; &gt; rest of the battle around them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; RODIMUS sent a crushi=\r\nng blow to the side of DARK RODIMUS&#39; helmet, only\n&gt; &gt; to have it block by t=\r\nhe mech almost effortlessly. &quot;You need to come\n&gt; &gt; trained to fight!&quot; He sa=\r\nid, an evil smile across his face.
