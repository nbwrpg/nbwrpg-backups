I \n  &gt;   came across \n  &gt;   &gt; a post talking =\r\nabout Neo beast Wars RPG.  I had\n  &gt; been looking to join \n  &gt;   an RPG, \n =\r\n &gt;   &gt; but none of them interested me, until NBW.  When\n  &gt; i joined, it wa=\r\ns \n  &gt;   just a \n  &gt;   &gt; mailing list.  Every day, people sent posts of\n  &gt;=\r\n the current list of \n  &gt;   members.  \n  &gt;   &gt; Eventually, we became part o=\r\nf egroups (now\n  &gt; Yahoogroups), and were \n  &gt;   able to \n  &gt;   &gt; gain a mu=\r\nch larger amount of members.  When i\n  &gt; joined, the council \n  &gt;   was \n  =\r\n&gt;   &gt; Yanshosh, Kslawdogg, JP3884, and Inferno371. \n  &gt; Soulstice was there=\r\n \n  &gt;   too, then \n  &gt;   &gt; being called &quot;code,&quot; much to his disliking.  The=\r\n\n  &gt; Maximals were led \n  &gt;   by Liono \n  &gt;   &gt; Prime, the Predacons by Hel=\r\nlbeast.  The Alliance\n  &gt; was there, but it \n  &gt;   was far \n  &gt;   &gt; smaller=\r\n.  And so i began my long involvement.  I\n  &gt; saw the tide turn \n  &gt;   both=\r\n ways \n  &gt;   &gt; in the war, and small custom factions spring up\n  &gt; and then=\r\n disapear.  \n  &gt;   I saw my \n  &gt;   &gt; fair share of idiots (ahh Icedemon), b=\r\nut there\n  &gt; were also some great \n  &gt;   posters.  \n  &gt;   &gt; There was Dacha=\r\nnde who started the Destrons,\n  &gt; Logo, who had the \n  &gt;   hottest female \n=\r\n  &gt;   &gt; characters ever, my good friend shomin, with his\n  &gt; psycho \n  &gt;   =\r\nreligiousness, \n  &gt;   &gt; carnagedarkness, with (his/her? not sure) long,\n  &gt;=\r\n thinky posts with \n  &gt;   Dinobot, \n  &gt;   &gt; and many others.  And let&#39;s not=\r\n forget\n  &gt; Minime_316, this RPG&#39;s only \n  &gt;   tragedy.  \n  &gt;   &gt; For those=\r\n of you who don&#39;t know, Minime\n  &gt; overdosed himself with \n  &gt;   pills.  To=\r\n \n  &gt;   &gt; make matters worse, that bastard JP beleived\n  &gt; that the tragic =\r\nemail \n  &gt;   by his \n  &gt;   &gt; brother was fake.  Oh, and KSL, im not angry\n =\r\n &gt; that your characters \n  &gt;   murdered \n  &gt;   &gt; Soundwave, don&#39;t worry abo=\r\nut it.  For those that\n  &gt; didn&#39;t like me, \n  &gt;   well then \n  &gt;   &gt; good f=\r\nor you, but for my friends here, feel free\n  &gt; to talk to me \n  &gt;   wheneve=\r\nr you \n  &gt;   &gt; want.
