He could not let the \nmaximals die. He was one of the few who knew what was at stake here. \nHe flew above megatron and he four mini rockets at him [the mini \nrockets are half the size of the regular rockets so it&#39;s just like \nfiring two missles.]\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheetor switched out of battle mode. he put his blades together and \nfired a green blast at Megatron.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nRhinox fired 25 rounds at Megatron.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nStarwind open his three front lazer gun points and fired at megatron.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDepth Charge flew next to Prowl. &quot;well looks like the cf is gone.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
