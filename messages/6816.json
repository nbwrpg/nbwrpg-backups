An overload of systems had merged parts of his mind with that of \nthe ship&#39;s computers. The computer voice was now superimposed with that of \nBobertron&#39;s voice, he literally was the ship.\n    &quot;Scanners report that a mass of Predacons are converging on the \nCybertronian Fire. The Maximals are preparing defenses. Unit Cheetor is among \nthem.&quot;\n    &quot;Interesting, this could be used well in the plans,&quot; Bobertron said in \nrepliance to what the computer had just stated. &quot;Mantella, Shredder, \nCyberShark, Battera, the Destrocons, stop what you are doing. I have a plan. \nWe are going to allie with the Maximals. They are about to be attacked by the \nPredacons, I wish for us to help them. Now no matter how much you dislike \nthem, help them.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::CyberShark::\n\n    Leaving the Iron Fist he flew away toward the Cybertronian Fire. Once he \nwas out of weapons range of the Iron Fist he decloaked. He was feeling \nextremly tired, the cloak had taken a lot out of him. He turned his jets to \nmaximum burn so he could get there all the faster and get back all the faster.\n\n"}}
