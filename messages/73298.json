Also,\neverything in the room looked as if it was sized to be utilized by\ntransformers of their hight and size.\n\nSCROPONOK stood across the room from HYDRAS looking at him and then he\npointed to the symbol painted on the door that le out of the room. &quot;I\nam sure you&#39;ve seen that sign?&quot;\n\nThe symbol was not Autobot or Maximal, Decepticon or Predacon but the\nsymbol of UNICRON!\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
