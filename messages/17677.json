He pulls out his sword and stabs it \nright \n&gt; into Koj&#39;s chest so the could go into back-up plan. He kicked \nSpears \n&gt; out of the way of the beam, letting it zoom past her by inches. Now \n&gt; it was back-up time. He sent a message to everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes, open fire! Come down Slayer! Everyone else! Ignatius, Savage, \n&gt; barage from the skies! Hammer, Blaze, Bullet! Come down and focus \non \n&gt; where the fire is coming from, and shoot!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pretty soon this forest was filled with weapons fire. Ignatius and \n&gt; Savage were sending lasers and fireballs down to the ground. Blaze \n&gt; Hammer and Bullet each fired in a direction that firing was coming \n&gt; from. (Bullet was firing at proto, Hammer at Firearm and Blaze at \n&gt; SnowCat.) This gave Prebon the opportunity to try and get away. He \n&gt; pulled out the two cloaking devices he had saved for him and \nSpears, \n&gt; and attempts to move closer to stick it on her and cloak them.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix adn Fliq were about to join the battle, but they thought they \n&gt; saw something.
