However that did not stop him from keep an optic on the others in the room. \n\nIn the midst of the tension of the room, in one corner of the room a door slid open, revealing the dark form of the chaned Rodimus, the Rodimus that nolonger belonged to the Autobots, but now had the heart of a decepticon, a heart as dark as his new paintjob. \n\nHe looked over at Cyclonus and Scourge, his face turning cold as he looked. There was no love lost between Cyclonus and Rodimus, and it was obvious as Rodimus walked over and took his place near to Hydras. \n\n&quot;What dose HE and his hunting dog have to say?&quot; Rodimus said, his voice dripping with ill concealed animosity\n\nAt that verbal thrust Scourge turned, his weapon seemingly drawn and leveled at Rodimus in one swift move!\n\n&quot;NO&quot; Cyclonus said, his voice like an iron spike through the air. &quot;That is NOT why we came here.&quot; Cyclonus was tough and no nonsence.\n\nRodimus on the other hand just chuckled as Scourge&#39;s hand just shook, just itching to pull the trigger, and yet so far did not. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n(Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus)\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
