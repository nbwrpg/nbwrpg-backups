I&#39;m being called for some \nreason.&quot; =\r\nShe looked down both ways in the hall. &quot;Umm, where is \nConference Room 6-3?=\r\n&quot;\nShe opened her link.&quot;I&#39;ll be righ there.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Ir=\r\non Raptor &lt;ironraptor13@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor looked at Arcang=\r\nel as she heard his plan, it was \nfairly simple to concieve=85but not to ca=\r\nrry out.\n&gt; It would take a lot of bot power to get Brooder&#39;s engines from\nh=\r\nis \nship and onto the Ark, many solar-cycles as well.\n&gt; She pondered what h=\r\ne asked for. But Brooder was right, they needed \nto find the Autobots first=\r\n before all of this took place=85if she \ndecided that it would happen.\n&gt; Ir=\r\non Raptor studied the wall behind the bots ahead of her, her mind \ndeep in =\r\nthrought.\n&gt; It could work, it could damn well work.\n&gt; But there were a few =\r\nmore details that had to be worked out before \nshe accepted anything. Like,=\r\n just how were they going to get the ship \ninto space without a pilot? Thin=\r\ngs such as that.\n&gt; But there was also another problem, the Ark was basicall=\r\ny scrap. It \nwould have to be repaired before they did anything.\n&gt; Iron Rap=\r\ntor sighed and leaned forward, placing her hands on the \ntable and leaning =\r\non them.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; This plan of yours sounds fairly possible. But I need more=\r\n\ndetail \non it. I need to know what your actions will be if anything goes \n=\r\nwrong, if there&#39;s a deadline and just how you plan to pull this\nstunt \noff.=\r\n I&#39;m not going to clarify this unless I know EVERYTHING.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Rapto=\r\nr then scanned the ship again but found that the new \nbot ( Feline ) was no=\r\n where in even nearing the Conference Room as \nshe had asked.\n&gt; Either this=\r\n bot hadn&#39;t gotten her message or she was ignoring\nher, \neither way she was=\r\n required to at least follow a simple order as to \ncome when she was called=\r\n.\n&gt; With her internal systems she scanned through this new bot&#39;s\nfile \nand =\r\nfinally found her name and other vital info.\n&gt; She looked at Arcangle for a=\r\n moment but then opened her com-link to \nthe fembot again.\n&gt; Besides, she a=\r\nlready had a few things that this bot could do to \nkeep her busy=85and out =\r\nof restricted areas.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Feline, this is Iron Raptor, Maximal Commander=\r\n. Report to me\nin \nConference Room 6-3. I wish to speak to you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And=\r\n with that she turned back towards Arcangel.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Sorry, just another ma=\r\ntter of buisness.
