Within a mega-cycle or two it would be fully repaired.\nShe sighed and looked over at Prowl, she smiled.*\n\n&quot; Perhaps, but considering that some bot&#39;s have been acting a little strange lately I would doubt that fact. But I also think that you are acting a bit modest, you did a brave thing out there, Prowl. You should be proud if nothing else.&quot;\n\n* She gave him a firm pat on the shoulder and looked over at the doors  just a Teltoli dragged a weak bot in.\nIron Raptor growled, looked back at Prowl with a worried glance and walked over to Teltoli. She looked at the fuzor and then at the damaged bot in her arms.*\n\n&quot; What happened,are you alright?&quot;\n\n*She looks at Stinkbomb and feels for a pulse, there was a faint one but it was strong enough to last a few more cycles without care. However, he wouldn&#39;t be without care as long as she was around. Iron Raptor looked back to Teltoli.*\n\n&quot; Are there more out there? If there are then leave them to me, you go and get a few mega-cycles in the CR chamber and please take Stinkbomb with you.&quot;\n\n* She gave the fuzor a weak smile and then looked up at Prowl, he face now as emotionless as stone. She then ordered the computer to arm the remaining auto guns and begin repairs on the damaged ship. With that now done it would only take a few mega-cycles for the repair to be complete. She growled as she looked around for Liono.*\n\n\n&quot; Where is that commander of ours when he is most needed, off picking daisies?! Slag! He&#39;s never around when a bot needs him, just that second commander of his. *sigh* Oh, well. Guess one can&#39;t have everything huh? &quot;\n\n* She then turned her attention to Teltoli to see if there were any more wounded outside, if there were then she and Prowl would go and get them. It was far better to travel in tows, that way a bot can get twice as much done and they could watch each other&#39;s backs as well. She thought about that a little more and wondered if a buddy system would benefit them any, she pondered the idea and then decided to bring it up at the next meeting...if there was one. And if there wasn&#39;t then she would just arrange one, she still planned to copy the Predacon&#39;s defence system and announcing a buddy system at that time wouldn&#39;t seem so bad. There had to be some organizing in this base and if she was the one to do it then so be it!\nAs Iron Raptor thought this she waited quietly for Teltoli to answer her question.*\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
