She could have \nkilled him!!! If she had learned one thing it was DO NOT REWIRE A WEAPON \nUNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING!!!\nShe looked over at him and glared, she suddenly sneezed(like the short and \nsudden ones that dogs and foxes do).*\n\n&quot; YOU IDIOT!&quot;\n\n* She yipped in anger again but the transmission from Black Arach stopped \nher short, she and Gangon were required to go to the Maximal base for and \nattack. BrightBlade looked at Gangon and motioned with her head, they were \nto leave. Now!\nShe turned towards the Predacons and bowed with extreme sarcasm...*\n\n&quot; Farewell, Traitors. I must now leave, orders. Hell Beast has called. And I \nwould rather face the wrath of your weapons then the wrath of Hell Beast if \nI disobey him.&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade turned and transformed into her B mode, she flipped her tail \nup at the traitors and then began to scamper off towards the Maximal base. \nShe looked back at Gangon to follow and soon disappeared into the brush.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
