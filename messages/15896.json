The trainers came \nand attacked us while you were gone.  They took Striker and Spears \nwith them. Striker was damaged and unconsious.  Spears was turned \ninto a slave by some chip.&quot;  She looked at the others who steppped \noff the shuttle.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have to tell you like this, but we \nneed to plan to get them back some how.&quot;  She winced at her shoulder, \nstill dripping fluid.  She looked up at Ramulus, hoping he would have \nan answer.\n\n\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ::Striker/Ramulus::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Striker looks back at Prebon, his eyes hostile. He glanced at \n&gt; Spears, \n&gt; &gt; wondering who she could have named. She hadn&#39;t been on the planet \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; too long, so she probably didn&#39;t know who was the Maximal leader, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; he was sure he had met at least a few high officials.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One thing was for sure in Striker&#39;s mind, whoever the Maximal \n&gt; leader \n&gt; &gt; was would probably be this team&#39;s next target. He couldn&#39;t let \nthat \n&gt; &gt; happen. Setting his scanners to give him info on the chip in \n&gt; Spears&#39; \n&gt; &gt; head, Striker looks back at Prebon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who should he name? Someone that Spears might have also named, \n&gt; &gt; someone who was experienced, someone like.....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ramulus,&quot; Striker says, &quot;And if you let Spears and me go, I can \n&gt; lead \n&gt; &gt; you right to him. Or him to you, whichever you preffer.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt; Ramulus lets out a breath of relief as the shuttle lands safely, \n&gt; &gt; nearly jumping out of his seat as the belt releases. He makes his \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; outside, looking lovingly around at nature, even if nature was a \n&gt; bit \n&gt; &gt; charred and cratered. This is where he belonged, not on some moon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He looks back at the Maximals, waiting for them to say something.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
