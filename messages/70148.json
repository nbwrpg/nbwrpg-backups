I have the feeling that she is starting to remember too&quot;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFrom: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, April 20, 2010 11:12 AM\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: BlackFortress\n\n&gt; Who: RODIMUS, Perceptor, Darkhawk\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Cell Block Control Room\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Looking to Rodimus said &quot;Is something related to her, right?&quot;Perceptor\n&gt;&gt; thought a little bit and said &quot;She&#39;s in her quaters now, if you want to \n&gt;&gt; pay\n&gt;&gt; a visit; I can stay a while... But let me tell you an advice for your \n&gt;&gt; good\n&gt;&gt; sake: Dont do something stupid, Rodimus; for her, dont do it; I&#39;m quite\n&gt;&gt; fond of you two... By the pit, I&#39;m getting old&quot; lamented the Predacon but \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; added&quot;but if you do something stupid due her, hydras could start to \n&gt;&gt; restrict\n&gt;&gt; her movements... Whatever happens dont start to give problems to others&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; For a moment fear and some other emotion, perhaps anger swept across\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; face as Perceptor spoke of restricting Nightlight. He was not\n&gt; even sure why the emotion came over him so strongly. However it passed\n&gt; almost as quickly as it came. Rodimus looked back at the security\n&gt; console where he had been talking to Tuscon a few moments ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What do you make of that Autobot Tuscon?&quot; Rodimus said, his tone both\n&gt; annoyed and yet curious at the same time. &quot;Twice he came in here\n&gt; trying to rescue people, and has been captured both times, yet he\n&gt; keeps on trying. He hasn&#39;t given up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Deep in his mind, far down where no one could see, he began to wonder\n&gt; about Tuscon and his words, it was like some small flame was trying to\n&gt; light, but kept sputtering out.\n&gt;\n&gt; However outwardly Rodimus just shook his head, &quot;It just doesn&#39;t make\n&gt; any sense to me.&quot; he said, his voice cool and low, not sure what he\n&gt; believed any more.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
