But it has always been a comfort to me to know \nthat he died a hero, a great hero.&quot;\n\n* That was her one weakness, the thoughts of the past always brought painful \nmemories to the surface and seemed to stop the world in it&#39;s tracks.\nYes, Dinobot was dead. Her last best friend, her last best allie.\nCarnage looked up at Cyber Claw, her solum expression now turning into solid \nrock. Did she hear the clone right, she wanted to join them?\nThat was a first!\nShe studied the clone for a moment, why would she want to join them? She had \nthought that the clone hated them because Teltoli was a Maximal.\nCarnage glared at Cyber Claw and bared her teeth but then sighed and \ngrowled.*\n\n&quot; How do I know that I can trust you, after all, you did try and kill me \nback there! How do I know that you won&#39;t try again?!&quot;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
