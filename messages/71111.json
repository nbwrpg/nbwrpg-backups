With two of his senses quelled, \nit was time to rely on a third, touch.  Knowing that talking would not help \nanything at all, he concentrates on the vibrations he feels through his \nhands, feet, and even the movement of the air around him.  He hoped that \nRodimus too, would be able to sense touch, and vibration.  He could feel \nwhere Rodimus was stepping, and somehow, by that alone, he manages to find \nhim, and then starts tapping lightly on his shoulder in a morse code, that \ncould be translated into communication.\n\n&quot; Careful Rodimus, this is one of Nightrazor&#39;s tricks.  He&#39;s dulled our \nsenses to give the illusion that most of us have been taken off line.  It&#39;s \nwhat I was able to gather from my intel processors.&quot;\n\nHe thinks for a moment.  This was a great way to communicate because \nNightrazor may not have any idea that Tucson was still able to communicate \nin this mode.  He raises an optic and continues to tap his shoulder.\n\n&quot; Don&#39;t take this the wrong way Rodimus, but it&#39;s the only way we can \ncommunicate in a way that Nightrazor has no notion of us doing so.  Feel \nfree to do the same, use the morse coding, it will help us understand each \nother to apprehend him sufficiantly.&quot;\n\nHe then taps Straight Shot&#39;s shoulder, who immediately responds by tapping \non Tucson&#39;s left leg.\n\n&quot; I bet Nightrazor wasn&#39;t planning on us being this resourceful huh?&quot;\n\nTucson responds back on her shoulder.\n\n&quot; He actually left me with no choice but to be resourceful.&quot;\n\nHe stops to feel the vibrations of the floor.  Then he puts out his hand to \nsense vibrations in the air.  Through that, he could get a faint idea as to \nhow the air circulates around various objects.  A cross breeze as stale as \nit was, would navigate him toward an emergency generator switch.  He follows \nthat breeze, and extends his hand out to touch it, slowly comming to the \ndevice.  With another raise of the brow he carefully throws the switch and \nwaits to see what happens.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the Ark, Uproar could see that he&#39;d be one fried kitty \ncat if he didn&#39;t move his aft out of the way of Cyclonus&#39;s fire.  In mid \nair, he&#39;s forced to duck the blast, which causes him to lose concentration, \nand quickly fall to the ground, in a drop roll maneuver, until he slams his \nhead up against a boulder, with a loud bang!\n\n&quot;Owwwww...  Remind me not - ta try that again.&quot;\n\nQuickstride now gets sick and tired of Waspinator&#39;s torment as he too, \nbreaks out the big guns against his flying foe.\n\n&quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;m gettn&#39; pretty sick of you dropping your bombs on me too, \nbug aft!&quot;\n\nHe throws continuous rounds from his large blast cannon while deflecting \nWaspinator&#39;s blasts.\n\n&quot;TIME FOR SOME MAJOR PEST CONTROL!  THIS&#39;LL MAKE YA WISH YA NEVER GOT OUTA \nYOUR HIVE THIS MORNING!&quot;\n\nAs it was for equine nature, Quickstride shows a severe dislike to \nWaspinator, hoping one day he would swat the servos out of him in his wasp \nmode, with his long, copper tail while in his own equine beast mode.\n\nFurthest away from the Ark, Night Shift pauses for a moment, as does Rat \nTrap, knowing that if they went in too quickly, something could go wrong. \nThis was unfamilliar territory now, and the slower they went, and the more \ncareful they were, would make a difference as to how they got out of their \nsituation.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s gonna take my GPS forever ta navigate this place.  Got any idea what \nthis is, Rat Trap?&quot;\n\nRat Trap shakes his head.\n\n&quot;No clue, never been here before..  Now, I don&#39;t think Cheetor came this \nway.  Remember? The last we heard, he was at the Black Fortress.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right.  That means he&#39;s back there somewhere.  Well, he&#39;s one of us, \nand I&#39;m willn&#39; ta go the distance if you are.&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m in.  Someone has ta help Cheetor.  But first, howd&#39;we get outa here? \nIf we go back the way we came, those sweeps will get us for sure.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks around.\n\n&quot; Yeah, and if I go alt mode, with just one spare tire, what happens when \nthe others go flat..  My guess is we try&#39;n see if we can find a way outa \nhere where those airheads aren&#39;t waitn&#39; for us at the other end.  Once we do \nthat, we&#39;ll head back ta the fortress site&#39;n see if we can pick up on \nCheetor.  Let&#39;s see, I might be able ta get my GPS online... &quot;\n\nRat Trap sniffs the air.\n\n&quot;Wait, ya might not need that.  I can smell it, well, the burnt remains \nanyway, kinda faint, but it&#39;s there, all I gotta do is follow the smell.\n\nNight Shift grits his teeth.\n\n&quot;Slag, no signal.  Yeah we&#39;ll have ta go that route little guy.&quot;\n\nSlowly Rat Trap follows the scent, but is careful as to where he steps. \nNight Shift realizes that he&#39;s ten times heavier than Rat Trap, and \ncarefully tests each step as he goes along.\n\nAlong the way, he notices some botanical life that he had never seen before. \nHe notices a large moth like insect drinking the nectar from the mysterious \nplant.\n\n&quot; This place might be strange, but at least it supports life.&quot;\n\nHe then walks along, leaving the plant and insect alone.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: I hope I got everything. This is like writing 4 or 5 posts in \n&gt; ne.  )\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; INSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Inside the Ark, Tucson makes his way toward Rodimus&#39;s position, while\n&gt; keeping close tabs on the signal he&#39;s able to work with, as faint as it \n&gt; is.\n&gt; He also picks up on Rodimus as he now approaches him quietly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; I take it you&#39;ve picked up on Nightrazor&#39;s trail. Well, he&#39;s checked\n&gt; himself in but he won&#39;t check himself out. His signatures are fluctuating,\n&gt; which means he&#39;s trying to recalibrate his systems. Hense he&#39;s also\n&gt; distracted. Good time to apprehend him. All right, I&#39;m going in, but \n&gt; before\n&gt; I do, I used my last pair of stasis cuffs, would you by chance have \n&gt; another\n&gt; I could borrow?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon is able to quickly reach Rodimus, who is currently in robot mode,\n&gt; looking around with his weapon drawn. &quot;I heard him in here.&quot; Rodimus said \n&gt; as\n&gt; he continued to look around, his high beams illuminating the other wise \n&gt; dark\n&gt; room.\n&gt;\n&gt; The light shines across the fallen bodies of the much older and much \n&gt; larger\n&gt; Autobots and Decepticons. They were all positioned in the front chamber of\n&gt; the ship, strewn between the door leading out of the ship and the main\n&gt; control station that the Autobots would one day, millions of years from \n&gt; now,\n&gt; turn into the control center for their base. However at the moment the \n&gt; room\n&gt; was, save for the lights brought by Rodimus,  completely dark the front \n&gt; door\n&gt; of the Ark finally able to close, sealing out the light from the outside,\n&gt; and hopefully the damage that would come from the outside.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there was the sound of something being thrown through the air, and\n&gt; Rodimus&#39; light went out and as far as Tuscon, Rodimus and Straightshot \n&gt; could\n&gt; tell, the room went completely silent and they couldn&#39;t even hear the \n&gt; sound\n&gt; of their own voice - even Tuscon&#39;s radar/sonar seemed to be down.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Nightrazor, LEAVE THAT PLACE INMEDEATLY&quot;said Hydras by comlink whine he\n&gt; fire back to Bantos and Torca\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a short message back from Nightrazor. &quot;I&#39;m working on it. I have\n&gt; to get past these Maximals first.&quot; There was a pause and then a grunt,\n&gt; &quot;Okay, I believe I have distracted them. I would appreciate some help\n&gt; getting the front door open again.&quot; Nightrazor was of course talking about\n&gt; the main door of the Ark. It was the only thing that separated him from\n&gt; freedom . . . that and that cursed wave that Tuscon was emitting.\n&gt;\n&gt; ELSEWHERE IN THE ARK:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Elita hide behind Ramulus but still she was peeking trying to find out \n&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; were the fallen ones...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus looked back at Elita again and then down at the figures at his \n&gt; feet.\n&gt; He bent down to examine them, running a small scanner on them. It was \n&gt; Santon\n&gt; and Bump, both laying there in a heap.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They are alive.&quot; Ramulus said with a slight hitch in his voice. &quot;But\n&gt; barely. Weren&#39;t they supposed to be . . .&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus&#39; head snapped up as he looked at Elita, &quot;Come on, we have to get \n&gt; to\n&gt; the Medbay, Quick!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus tapped a control activating his communication gear, &quot;Tuscon, \n&gt; Rodimus\n&gt; Santon and Bump are down. Weren&#39;t they suppose to be . . .&quot; he glanced at\n&gt; Elita, &quot;. . . some where else?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor continue working fast trying to seal all acces to the sleeping\n&gt; Autobots and decepticons &quot;Legacy, we must find the way to seal the ARK!!! \n&gt; we\n&gt; have to keep out Hydras of the ark&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy nodded, &quot;The main door to the Ark has been sealed. However with the\n&gt; reapplication of Tuscon&#39;s wave emission getting main power online will \n&gt; prove\n&gt; to be difficult. It is possible to for Hydras to simply blast through. I \n&gt; may\n&gt; be needed in the main room to protect the elder ones.&quot; Legacy was talking\n&gt; about the old Autobots and Decepticons. &quot;I believe at the moment I am the\n&gt; only one with a working shield.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy turned to leave, &quot;I will leave you to protect the Ark as best you\n&gt; can. I have set the control for tactile and verbal operation. You should \n&gt; be\n&gt; able to operate it by touch.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; MEANWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord keep the fire in Deepstrike  while Kup continue to shooting\n&gt; Scourge and the sweeps, he had a hard time doing that.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Windlord and Kup kept firing up at the Predacons, theirs combined with \n&gt; Torca\n&gt; and Leo II were lighting up the skies. Leo II&#39;s shot&#39;s along with Kup&#39;s \n&gt; hit\n&gt; Scourge on two sides, sending the hunter spinning in the air. He was not\n&gt; brought down so much as he received two terrible wounds which forced him \n&gt; to,\n&gt; at least temporarily, break off his attack.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile Deepstryke slowly made his way towards the Ark, Windlord&#39;s \n&gt; attacks\n&gt; able to slow him down as he had to maneuver around the attacks, or allow \n&gt; his\n&gt; armored chassis to absorb them. But being a gun unit had its advantages as\n&gt; he also returned fire on Windlord.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar growls as he addresses Cyclonus while leaping into the air on\n&gt; strong legs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;BANZAIIII!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He raises his left arm to attempt a powerful claw swipe.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Uproar leaped up to try to meet Cyclonus in the air, the elegantly\n&gt; graceful craft that was Cyclonus began to spin in the air, angling away \n&gt; from\n&gt; the nasty claws that Uproar was swinging at him, spinning wing over wing \n&gt; to\n&gt; do it. It was as if Cyclonus were some sort of dancer, or an agile bird of\n&gt; flight. Behind him his boosters flared brightly as picked up speed!\n&gt;\n&gt; Even as he moved though, at the top of the jet a twin cannon turret spun,\n&gt; orienting on Uproar and then with a pause for target acquisition they \n&gt; opened\n&gt; up with twin plumes of coruscating power!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride calibrates his large blast cannon, and takes\n&gt; careful aim at Waspinator. He chuckles under his breath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Bye bye BUGGIE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; His finger pulls back on the trigger, as he now attempts to shoot\n&gt; Waspinator down.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Waspinator is not nearly so agile as Cyclonus in the air, nor is he built \n&gt; as\n&gt; durable. But what he lacks in these two qualities he makes up in tenacity\n&gt; and just foolish luck. Buzzing, much like a real wasp he flew in, dodging\n&gt; one blast, and then another, until a third one catches him in a wing \n&gt; sending\n&gt; Waspinator rocketing through the air like a cannon ball.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Me Waspinator am tired of Maxibots beating on him.&quot; Waspinator said as he\n&gt; was flung through the air. &quot;Waspinator TERRORIZE!&quot; he said as he shifted\n&gt; into his transmetaled form, that of a fighter jet. The battle was far from\n&gt; over as he righted himself and came back at Quickstride, guns blazing!\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile as Hydras and Inferno arrived at the door to the Ark, they found\n&gt; it closed, the massive doors clicking as they came to a stop. Getting into\n&gt; the Ark would not be that easy. In fact it was to be much more difficult \n&gt; as\n&gt; Quicksilver, Airhammer and Noctorro, three of the Maximal Fuzors, came\n&gt; flying in from one side, firing their weapons at Hydras and Inferno as\n&gt; Bantor, the other more land bound Fuzor leaped in to attack Hydras again!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; AND SOME DISTANCE AWAY:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap grins.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oooh yeah, good thinkn&#39;. I dunno if I like this place, but it&#39;s better\n&gt; than havn&#39; those airheads blastn&#39; the fuzz off my tail end.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Together they walk into the dense overgrowth, exploring its parameters\n&gt; with what little light comes from Night Shift&#39;s high beams.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As some of the ancient forests actually stretched across much of the North\n&gt; American continent, the `parameters&#39; of the forest stretch out for as far \n&gt; as\n&gt; the optic can see. The area inside the forest is not as densely overgrown \n&gt; as\n&gt; one might imagine. With the canopy of trees over head blocking most of the\n&gt; direct sunlight, at ground level things are fairly clear, save for large \n&gt; and\n&gt; leafy growths of ferns or other wild plants.\n&gt;\n&gt; That does not mean that the ground is flat, as large tree roots, stones \n&gt; and\n&gt; broken ground break up the ground making it treacherous for the unaware,\n&gt; making anything close to four wheel travel, even for those of Cybertronian\n&gt; descent, extremely difficult and hazardess. There is even the occasional\n&gt; large fallen tree here and there; signs that not even the tall spires of \n&gt; the\n&gt; forest are immune to the ravages of time and unforeseen occurrence.\n&gt;\n&gt; In robot rode, Nightshift and Rat Trap can still hear the movements of\n&gt; animals all around them, birds still occasionally fly up or make odd \n&gt; noises\n&gt; as they pass. There is the occasional foot print and the obvious sounds of\n&gt; passage of large animals, some perhaps larger than a school bus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Should these two desire to travel back the scene of Hydras&#39; tower, it \n&gt; might\n&gt; be possible, and maybe even safe from the sweeps that had chased them into\n&gt; the forest, but that does not mean it will be easy or quick.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
