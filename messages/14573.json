The missile hits behind Deemos, sending dirt\nand\n&gt; rocks flying toward the Maximal.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That was a warning shot. If you don&#39;t get otta here, a few more are gonna\n&gt; hit a few of you,&quot; he says, firing two more missiles, these ones aimed at\n&gt; Deemos. He activates his comm-link, setting it to transmitt to both\nPredacon\n&gt; and Alliance frequences.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Everyone,&quot; he says into it, &quot;Zardus sent us here to help the Preds. Fire\n&gt; only on Maximal signatures.&quot; The command was meant for the Alliance, the\n&gt; explanation for the Preds.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; DevilDuer runs jumps out into the clearing, transforming in the air, and\n&gt; firing his pistol at Infectra.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Run, Maxi! While ya can!&quot; he yells, firing repetedly at her.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Bloodystrike flies into the scene, a heavy-fire rifle in one hand and a\n&gt; rapid-fire one in the other. He opens fire on Doom Ice&#39;s ship, five shots\n&gt; from the heavy-fire and 13 from the automatic.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Zardus, we&#39;ve engaged the Maxi&#39;s,&quot; he says into his comm, sending the\n&gt; transmission to Zardus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
