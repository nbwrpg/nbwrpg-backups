Its main bay\nwindow had=\r\n been smashed ages ago when the fighters had left the place\nin a hurry as t=\r\nhe warship was crashing into the sea.\n\nA volcanic eruption shook the area. =\r\nThe energon deposits encrusted\nalong its rim exploded and boiled away, but =\r\nnot before a low magnitude\nsurge hit the ship. It was just enough.\n\nThe lon=\r\ne warrior, twice a hero, had been in stasis lock since the\ncrash.  By now, =\r\nhe was covered in seaweeds and deep sea animals, then\nthe surge shook him b=\r\nack to life. Pressure should have crushed him to\nruins, but his was a trans=\r\nmetal 2 body, and not so easily vanquished\nby nature.\n\nHe rose painfully, c=\r\nonfused, and after computing where he was, started\nwalking back to the shor=\r\ne.\n\nDinobot 2 was back.\n\n\n"}}
