He had heard the orders over radio link. &quot;Okay recruit,\n&gt; show us what you got,&quot; He said, pointing at Incinerator. Wildrider on\n&gt; the other hand didnt have patience for that. He took aim on a bigger\n&gt; target, and found one. He pulled his trigger laughing, firring a\n&gt; scattering eight laser beams at Lavatron, not caring if any by mistake\n&gt; hit Surgital.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
