It trys to explain things with science that shouldn&#39;t be explained with science.  You cannot scientiffycally prove wiether or not the spiritual realm exists.\n\nBut partial creationism is foolishness.  If you are following the biblical account of creation, there is no room for interperatation.  The Bible tells you when it is being symbolic by using words as: &quot;like&quot; &quot;as&quot; but when it refers to creation, it doesn&#39;t.  You cannot interperet on it&#39;s own; the rest of scriptures back this up.\n\nIf God has the power to create something from nothing, then why would he only set it in motion?  Wouldn&#39;t he rather be involved in the project?\n\nAnyway, It&#39;s ok to be a &quot;radical&quot; if you can use your head.\n&gt;Message: 1\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2002 12:18:39 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;   From: Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Merry Christmas!\n&gt;\n&gt;I know it&#39;s a little late, but I meant to do this on\n&gt;Christmas eve/day:\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh come, oh come Emaaanuel,\n&gt;and ransom captive Iiisreal,\n&gt;which mourns in lonely eeeexile here,\n&gt;until the son of Goood appears,\n&gt;rejoice, rejoice, Emaaanuel,\n&gt;shall come to thee oh Iiisreal.\n&gt;\n&gt;.....*sigh* o.k. just get it over with, start with the\n&gt;anti-religious flames because you falsely believe me\n&gt;to be a radical.  Believe it or not I&#39;ve often\n&gt;defended such losing causes as evolution in the name\n&gt;of partial creationism (it means God worked THROUGH\n&gt;evolution and the seven days were symbolic)....o.k.\n&gt;you can flame me about that to, but like it or not\n&gt;evolution currently IS a losing cause, why, because\n&gt;there are NO holes in creationism, it&#39;s to simple to\n&gt;find holes in, just God made everything in a few days\n&gt;and everything looked old even then, so while\n&gt;evolution in my opinion is just as legitimate,\n&gt;whenever a tiny hole appears the pure creationists can\n&gt;beat both pure evolutionists and us partial\n&gt;creationists over the head with it for two or three\n&gt;decades until ninty percent of the world is on there\n&gt;side.\n&gt;  My defense of partial creationism against pure\n&gt;evolutionism is simple though.  Before the Big Bang,\n&gt;how did the so-called &quot;primortial atom&quot; get there.  I\n&gt;mean infinately dense particals billions of times\n&gt;smaller than normal atoms don&#39;t usually just pop out\n&gt;of nowhere do they.  The only person I&#39;ve ever heard\n&gt;answer that was some nutcase astronomer who said\n&gt;aliens from another dimension wanted to do a science\n&gt;project and overloaded a black hole to start the big\n&gt;bang, but then you can simply ask how did THEIR\n&gt;primortial atom get there, and yes I do believe the\n&gt;stories about alien abductions, but not that one.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt;&quot;\n&gt;&lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Merry Christmas everybody and may your wishes come\n&gt;&gt; true!
