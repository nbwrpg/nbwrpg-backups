My friends are commn&#39; back ta h=\r\nelp me out.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, another stego scouts the area where Night Shift=\r\n and Rat Trap had just fled. He had been with the family originally, and ap=\r\npears to be one of the oldest members of the herd. He picks up a familliar =\r\nscent, yet not Night Shift, but the scent of another comrade, and follows i=\r\nt. It leads him close to Ramulus. He spots the Maximal, and waits for his a=\r\npproach, quietly gurgling his growl, and lowering his head as if to try and=\r\n get him to follow him.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWhen the Stegosauras spotted Ramulus, the M=\r\naximal was at the scene of\nthe battle. He was in robot mode skulking around=\r\n the area, the smell\nof gunpowder and burnt metal and smoke still hung in t=\r\nhe air like a\ncloud. But for him it would seem that battle is over. There a=\r\nre no\ncombatants, no explosions, and no bright flashes of light in the\ndist=\r\nance. All is quiet, except for a strange gurgling growling sound.\n\nRamulus =\r\nlooked over at the rather strange acting Stegosauras. he gave\nit a quizzica=\r\nl look and tried to shoo it away. &quot;Hey big fella, you\ndon&#39;t need to be arou=\r\nnd here. It might not be safe.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile he turned his radio on. &quot;Rat Tra=\r\np, Nightshift. I am here at\nthe site wher you called us from, but I don&#39;t s=\r\nee you.&quot; There was a\ncautious and confused timber to his voice. &quot;I can see =\r\nthe battle you\nwere talking about, but there is no one left. It looks like =\r\nhalf the\nforest was set ablaze though.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
