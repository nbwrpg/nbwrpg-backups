And the first two don&#39;t count.\n\n::DarkMouse::\n\nShe went to the lab and started looking at the DNA samples. She noticed one \nthat said a certain bot&#39;s name on it. She smiled and remembered her old \nleader.  &quot;Yeah, she was a good leader. Too bad she was killed by that damned \nrattlesnake bot.&quot;  She went looking around just to cure bordom.  Then she \nremembered her old experiment.  She went rushing over to the CR tanks and \npeered inside them.  They were all empty.  She sighed and guessed the \nexperiment had been trashed.  Then she turned and was about to leave, when \nshe saw the cloning tank.  She looked inside it and saw what she was looking \nfor. It was a perfect replica of her former leader. She smiled and double \nchecked the process on the console. It had been completed, but no one had \never activated the bot.  She couldn&#39;t hold her excitement in any longer. She \nyelled out,&quot;YES! IT&#39;S BEEN SITTING HERE AND IT&#39;S JUST FINE!&quot; She went about \nchecking all the programs and making sure that everything was in order. &quot;Oh \nyeah, things will get better when she&#39;s re-awakened. Oh my leader, you will \nrise again.&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
