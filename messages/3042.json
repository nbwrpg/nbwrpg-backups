The rare moment now gone for a while, it even taking years to surface again at times.\nDinobot reached the War room just as Tavatron had caught up to him, her pulling ahead a bit and then opening the door for him with the comment of if he thought he was smart.\nHe noted her smile before her hand had opened the door but had then kept his commonly emotionless expression, not really in the mood for any more comments or unwanted concerns.\nHe glared at her for a moment for no real reason in particular but then walked up and pushed the door even wider then she had.\nHe growled...*\n\n&quot; I do not think, I know.&quot;\n\n* And with that Dinobot then gestured for Tavatron to take the lead and enter the room before himself, his last comment hanging in the air but then hopefully ending the humorous moments of the day...or just for now. Either suited him fine.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
