He =\r\nkeeps the base&#39;s defense system online just in \ncase, and he watches the ma=\r\nssive form cautiously as comes ever \ncloser. Such an imposing beast was som=\r\nething to be reckoned with.\n\nHearing the bot, now revealed to have an Eleph=\r\nant beast mode, name \nhimself an Autobot, he relaxes even more. Still a lit=\r\ntle wary, he \nspeaks to Hoist quietly, &quot;Hoist, any confirmation on his clai=\r\nm?&quot;\n\nHoist&#39;s voice comes onto Pacifix&#39; comm, &quot;Yes, base camera has picked \n=\r\nup an allied symbol on him. I&#39;d be willing say with confidence he&#39;s \nnot ho=\r\nstile.&quot; \n\n&quot;Thanks,&quot; replies Pacifix. He looks up at the bot again, and repl=\r\nies \nloudly, &quot;Welcome Maximal Infantry Skullhammer to the Autobot base. \nPl=\r\nease come down here and meet our crew. The base&#39;s defenses have \nbeen disar=\r\nmed.&quot; He puts his weapons away, and motions with his hand \nfor the bot to j=\r\noin him. \n\nAfter waving, he opens a commlink to Crotale and \nCrossroads, &quot;C=\r\nrotale and Crossroads, I&#39;m outside the base right now, \ncome and meet a new=\r\ncomer to the planet, Skullhammer. He&#39;s an Autobot \nfrom Cybertron.&quot;\n\nThen h=\r\ne contacts JetV and Artemis, &quot;Artemis and JetV, return to base \nas soon as =\r\npossible, and be prepared to meet a visitor. Don&#39;t worry, \nhe&#39;s not hostile=\r\n.&quot;\n\n--------------\n\nCrossroads gets Pacifix&#39; message, and quickly confirms =\r\nthat, &quot;Gotcha \nPacifix.&quot; He drags his small body out of a minor state of \nm=\r\neditation, and walks out of his quarters. He turns down the hall, \nand begi=\r\nns to make his way to the exit of the base.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;polar_cl=\r\naw_ca&quot; &lt;dfinnamore@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (OOC) \n&gt; Ahh=85so kind and encouraging, t=\r\nhis group. Boy, I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a \n&gt; bunch of you nice folks up here=85 La=\r\nst time I joined a game, people \n&gt; all tried to kill me off right away. Not=\r\n that I don&#39;t expect some \n&gt; combat=85o_O;;\n&gt; \n&gt; (IC)\n&gt; Skullhammer&#39;s huge,=\r\n grey form thundered across the plains of the \n&gt; African region. His large =\r\npadded feet crashed along the ground at \na \n&gt; great pace, striking up a clo=\r\nud of dust which encircled and \ntrailed \n&gt; after him like a tsunami. Powerf=\r\nul robotic legs pushed him onwards \n&gt; towards the base, his newly formed be=\r\nast mode speeding nearer and \n&gt; nearer. \n&gt; \n&gt; His robotic mind, a network o=\r\nf circuitry and uplink servo-chips, \n&gt; accepted an incoming message clearly=\r\n across the rapidly lessening \n&gt; distance between himself and the Autobot b=\r\nase. As he heard the \nvoice \n&gt; and verification of being an Autobot, his te=\r\nnse steel muscles \n&gt; relaxed, and he continued on his pace. Amongst the hea=\r\nvy footfalls \nof \n&gt; his massive elephant form, Skullhammer made his reply w=\r\nith a high \n&gt; heart=85er, spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings Autobot Commander Pacifix.=\r\n This is Maximal Infantry \n&gt; Skullhammer, approaching your base&#39;s eastern s=\r\nide. I&#39;ve just \nlanded \n&gt; on this planet. Most of my own sensors are offlin=\r\ne yet.&quot; His \nvoice, \n&gt; made up of a deep and even tonality in line with his=\r\n large body, \nwas \n&gt; clear even above the loud rumbling his four strong leg=\r\ns made as he \n&gt; rushed across the barren region.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skullhammer&#39;s pace qu=\r\nickened, shocking even him. The corded steel \n&gt; muscles of the Maximal warr=\r\nior flexed underneath the pseudo-skin \n&gt; which covered him, propelling him =\r\nalong at speeds he didn&#39;t think \n&gt; possible for the somewhat unwieldy and s=\r\nizeable form which he \n&gt; inhabited. His weighty body came closer and closer=\r\n to the base \nuntil \n&gt; he was less than fifty meters. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well inside the=\r\n range of the base&#39;s autocannons, Skullhammer \nskidded \n&gt; to a halt on a sm=\r\nall stone ridge. The base was clearly an Autobot \n&gt; site, and was furthermo=\r\nre armed to the teeth, ready to unload a \n&gt; powerful and violent volley of =\r\nblasts upon his metallic hide. He \n&gt; could almost picture the barrage of en=\r\nergy bolts and hot \nprojectile \n&gt; fire being fired in a terrifying storm of=\r\n death, and himself being \n&gt; stuck right in the center of it, if he were to=\r\n make a wrong move \nor \n&gt; come under suspicion. His life as an Autobot told=\r\n him the \nprocedures \n&gt; Autobots followed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking directly to the ba=\r\nse now, closer in range, Skullhammer \n&gt; raised his voice in a clear opening=\r\n statement. &quot;Autobots, I am \n&gt; Skullhammer, an Autobot of Cybertron sent to=\r\n assist the Maximals \nin \n&gt; their mission here on Earth against the Predaco=\r\nn forces.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
