And I&#39;m sorry.\nYou see, you do such a good with your characters the I just wanted to try one out. I wouldn&#39;t touch Dinobot, you do too good of a job with him. But I just wanted to try one out. I know that this&#39;ll be a mark against me and I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll ask you next time. (Not to mention that I&#39;m half asleep right now.But that&#39;s no real excuse.)\nAnd I apologize to all of the NBWers out there about the last post I sent, do what Carnage said and just delete it. I&#39;m sorry, again.\nI&#39;ll post my own character now.\n\n                                   I.R.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
