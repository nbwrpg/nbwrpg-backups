Two of the blasts hit him\nin the head, but he turns around, and two hit Firedrill. THey both\ncollapse.\n\nCliffjumper looking on sees Firedrill fall, and assumes Gimler was\nfiring on him in the first place. &quot;Why you backstabber&quot; he yelled, and\ntransformed into his car mode, quickly eccxellerating to 300mph in a\nsecond and heads straight at Gimller&#39;s feet.\n\n"}}
