Ahh, yes, always of the foibles of\n&gt; &gt; the MAXIMALS to think that o=\r\nnly they were right on any occasion, and especially\n&gt; &gt; that infuriating ro=\r\ndent. Still fully concealed from view, still in total\n&gt; &gt; stealth mode now =\r\nand her cloak powered up, she kept on working to try and\n&gt; &gt; see if she cou=\r\nld obost the homing signals any better, to probably no luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; So far there was no contact from BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s attempt to locate\n&gt; HYDR=\r\nAS. If he is still functional he is definitly out of range of her\n&gt; ability=\r\n to connect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also she had any kind of signal on DRILL BIT, VICE GRIP a=\r\nnd/or DINOBOT\n&gt; then as they went deeper into the caves they quickly fell o=\r\nff of her\n&gt; radar as well. Whatever interferance there was it wasy cutting =\r\noff her\n&gt; range even faster in the caves.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; WASPINATOR w=\r\nas flying up and over into the air, going in a long circle for\n&gt; &gt; the mome=\r\nnt as he was attempting to try and find a clear path through the\n&gt; &gt; underb=\r\nrush. OF all the ironies, WASPINATOR was a surprisingly dextrous\n&gt; &gt; flier,=\r\n and with nothing shooting at him immediately, he was seemingly able\n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n clear his way through it surprisingly deftly. Avoiding the branches,\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\novering in the air and going thorugh them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, BLACKARACHNIA=\r\n mused more over on TARANTALUS, testing\n&gt; &gt; again the mental link with her =\r\n&#39;Lord&#39; to see if there was any response over it,\n&gt; &gt; or she was truly on he=\r\nr own for now. If not.. Then it would be her happy time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fo=\r\nr the moment BLACKARACHNIA was truely alone, or so it seemed. At\n&gt; least th=\r\nere no was answering call from TARANTULUS. The only thing she\n&gt; could hear =\r\nwas the conversations going on around her. But was that\n&gt; because she was t=\r\nruely cut off from TARANTULUS or because he was just\n&gt; letting her believe =\r\nthat she was.\n&gt; \n&gt; The old spider was a wiley old creature. One that has on=\r\nly gotten more\n&gt; crafty with age.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fortunately, VICE GR=\r\nIP could do both. Gesturing over to DRILL BIT, &quot;Come\n&gt; &gt; with me, we&#39;re goi=\r\nng down.&quot; Giving instructions to DINOBOT, &quot;Go up to the\n&gt; &gt; surface and inf=\r\norm CRYOTEK of what we&#39;ve found and what we&#39;re doing.  We&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; going to k=\r\neep on digging and trying to track the souce.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that, the two w=\r\nould head towards it while DINOBOT went up towards the\n&gt; &gt; surface to cover=\r\ntly report to CRYOTEK.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As VICE GRIP and DRILL BIT prepared =\r\nto go further in and DINOBOT\n&gt; prepared to go back to the surface there was=\r\n an odd tapping that could\n&gt; be heard even above the hum. One that echoed t=\r\nhrough out the cave\n&gt; coming from further in and further down.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ech=\r\no made it difficult to discern any patturns to it, but one\n&gt; thing was for =\r\nsure, it definitly did not sound like anything natural.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - P=\r\nreston\n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-F218AE20-BCED-4662-9851-6A4FB710750A\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rattrap and Straight Shot=\r\n nod in agreement to Wing Callibers question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Wi=\r\nngcalliber has a point.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Straight Shot says quietl=\r\ny.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; What if Rodimus truly lost the Matrix or what=\r\n if it got corrupted? &nbsp;And if we don&#39;t find it in time? &nbsp;What the=\r\nn?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful for things =\r\nyou already posses. &nbsp;Nothing is worth more than family and friends.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Dec 12, 2011, at 2:34 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      =\r\n\n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap listens patiently and =\r\nthen looks back up to the sky.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Yeah, I kinda read up on=\r\n that..

Ahh, yes, always of the foibles of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the MAXIMALS to=\r\n think that only they were right on any occasion, and especially&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nhat infuriating rodent.  Still fully concealed from view, still in total&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; stealth mode now and her cloak powered up, she kept on working to tr=\r\ny and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; see if she could obost the homing signals any better, to pro=\r\nbably no luck.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo far there was no contact fr=\r\nom BLACKARACHNIA&#39;s attempt to locate&lt;br&gt;\nHYDRAS. If he is still functional =\r\nhe is definitly out of range of her&lt;br&gt;\nability to connect.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlso s=\r\nhe had any kind of signal on DRILL BIT, VICE GRIP and/or DINOBOT&lt;br&gt;\nthen a=\r\ns they went deeper into the caves they quickly fell off of her&lt;br&gt;\nradar as=\r\n well. Whatever interferance there was it wasy cutting off her&lt;br&gt;\nrange ev=\r\nen faster in the caves.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; WASPINA=\r\nTOR was flying up and over into the air, going in a long circle for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; the moment as he was attempting to try and find a clear path through the&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; underbrush.  OF all the ironies, WASPINATOR was a surprisingly dex=\r\ntrous&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; flier, and with nothing shooting at him immediately, he was =\r\nseemingly able&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to clear his way through it surprisingly deftly.  A=\r\nvoiding the branches,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hovering in the air and going thorugh them.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, BLACKARACHNIA mused more over on TARANTALUS, t=\r\nesting&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; again the  mental link with her &#39;Lord&#39; to see if there was =\r\nany response over it,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or she was truly on her own for now.  If not=\r\n..  Then it would be her happy time.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor the =\r\nmoment BLACKARACHNIA was truely alone, or so it seemed. At&lt;br&gt;\nleast there =\r\nno was answering call from TARANTULUS. The only thing she&lt;br&gt;\ncould hear wa=\r\ns the conversations going on around her. But was that&lt;br&gt;\nbecause she was t=\r\nruely cut off from TARANTULUS or because he was just&lt;br&gt;\nletting her believ=\r\ne that she was.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe old spider was a wiley old creature. One that =\r\nhas only gotten more&lt;br&gt;\ncrafty with age.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Fortunately, VICE GRIP could do both.  Gesturing over to DRILL B=\r\nIT, &quot;Come&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with me, we&#39;re going down.&quot;  Giving instructions to DINO=\r\nBOT, &quot;Go up to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; surface and inform CRYOTEK of what we&#39;ve found =\r\nand what we&#39;re doing.  We&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; going to keep on digging and trying t=\r\no track the souce.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With that, the two would head towards=\r\n it while DINOBOT went up towards the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; surface to covertly report t=\r\no CRYOTEK.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs VICE GRIP and DRILL BIT prepare=\r\nd to go further in and DINOBOT&lt;br&gt;\nprepared to go back to the surface there=\r\n was an odd tapping that could&lt;br&gt;\nbe heard even above the hum. One that ec=\r\nhoed through out the cave&lt;br&gt;\ncoming from further in and further down.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe echo made it difficult to discern any patturns to it, but one&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nthing was for sure, it definitly did not sound like anything natural.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end=\r\n group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-F218AE20-BCED-4662-9851-6A4FB710750A--\r\n\n"}}
