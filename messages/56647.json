However, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;in the meantime, she rendezvoused with Blackstorm as she detected the femme &lt;BR&gt;&gt;nearby &amp; changed course just enough to intercept. Noticing also a couple others &lt;BR&gt;&gt;with her. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;Opening a com to Blackstorm, &gt;&quot;Blackstorm this is Maxima. Comrades or &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;prisoners?&quot;&lt; she was very too the point &amp; dry about the question. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;BlackStorm opened her comlink and answered &quot;Comrades... until Hydras say other thing.... Maxima, this will please you... I received a message for help in Decepticons&#39; frecuency... I&#39;m ... we&#39;re&nbsp; follonwing it&quot;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Closing in on Blackstorm, she transformed into bot mode as her wings expanded to allow her to soar if not hover. &quot;Decepticons?!&quot; This surprized &amp; excited her. More Decepticons... it was almost too good to be true. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Lead the way! We must intercept at their location immediately,&quot; she replied. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Follow my signal&quot;replied the femme&quot;If you wish we can do a meeting before contact them... I don&#39;t know how this will be end&quot;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Hmm.. Agreed. But Decepticons have an understanding not to fire upon another Decepticon. It&#39;s a sort of kinship, Decepticon programming that allows such a possibility not to come under fire.&quot; she followed Blackstorm, somewhat ignoring Sideways &amp; the others. But, she still kept her sensors on them just in case. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;Maxima, what happened while you was in... in the place?&quot;said Black Storm&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;MSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.msn.com/8HMJESMX/2746??PS=&quot;&gt;Haz clic aqu� &lt;/a&gt; Get 2 months FREE*. &lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
