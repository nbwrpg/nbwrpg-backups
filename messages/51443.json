Seeing another shot coming from a large tank that had just \narrived, he rises higher and avoids the large blast that could have \nblown him down. The smaller shots however did get to him, and his leg \nwas getting weak. He wouldn&#39;t be able to use that talon for some \ntimes.\n\nHe saw that Skulletron was trying to coordinate with Wolfenstein, and \nthe tank&#39;s arrival made things more complicated. A plan formed in his \nhead.\n\nHe directed two turrets to concentrate fire on the new bot and follow \nit. They both unleashed a hellfire of laser beams at him.\n\nTyrael: Khan Vlad! Forward and do not stop! We drive them back now!\n\nVlad: Are you certain, Major?\n\nThe Clanner looked around. The brunt of the enemy opposition was \nsituated on a northeastern frontline from the base. Inferno and \nQuickstrike were near, but the base defenses could handle the pair.\n\nVlad: I see... (He turned to Inferno) I withdraw my claim on you as my \nopponent. Forward Tyrael!\n\nHe turned to Wolfenstein, transformed then used his medium laser on \nthe hairy bot.\n\nAt the same moment, Tyrael let go another volley of needles on \nSkulletron, dived down and slashed twice at him with his razor-sharp \nfeathers.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Eric Bischoff&quot; &lt;1641coburn@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; : : Skulletron : :\n&gt; \n&gt; Skulletron nods, then he points to Tyrael.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skulletron:  That&#39;s the bot in charge of the Tripreds.  I need you \nto go and take his attention, but try not to get hurt.  And please, \ntry to resist aggression, or else this will be harder for me.  Can you \ndo that, comrade?\n\n\n"}}
