Cybertron \n&gt; seems all good and everything, but there are some general guidelines \n&gt; we&#39;d have to follow. On some colony world, we&#39;d get to create the \n&gt; world we want to play on.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Vincent Price&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Well, then, I give it a fair chance. I reacted that way I \nthink \n&gt; because I&#39;m still upset about the death of NBMSSO. But then again, \n&gt; it&#39;s death may have brought for the life of DBZSF, since it made me \n&gt; spend more time on it. I&#39;m still actually one of the only ones in \nthe \n&gt; RPG who prefers to do more talking than fighting, like what goes on \nin \n&gt; DBZSF. I say, whatever comes around in this RPG, comes around, I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; fear the future...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: KSLawdogg@c... \n&gt; &gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 3:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: Debate (important everyone read)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   (I beg to differ.  I&#39;m in a MUSH, that takes place solely on \n&gt; Cybertron.  And \n&gt; &gt;   it is way better than the NBW.  Cybertron would just require \nlots \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt;   thinking.  Like the millions if not billions of civilians that \n&gt; would be on \n&gt; &gt;   the planet, and since all we do in this RPG is fight we&#39;d have \nto \n&gt; take that \n&gt; &gt;   into account.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Because most factions in the NBW have, if they&#39;re big, 20 \n&gt; characters, and 20 \n&gt; &gt;   characters would mean jack crap compared to a population of \n&gt; millions or \n&gt; &gt;   billions.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
