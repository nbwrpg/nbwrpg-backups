Set the shuttle in the last know coordinates \n&gt;&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There were many soldier already at the shuttle when Hydras arrived,\n&gt; Insecticon and Bruticus-X, both of whom had just finished being\n&gt; repaired. The remaineder of the fuzors, Injector, Buzzclaw,\n&gt; Terrorgator, and Quickstrike. Lastly came the soldiers that had served\n&gt; with the old Megatron - Terrorsaur, Waspinator, and Inferno.\n&gt;\n&gt; Only Cyclonus, Scourge, Deepstryke, Blackrazor and Phobia stayed\n&gt; behind, presumably to care for Hydras&#39; base, to be sure that it would\n&gt; be protected. Hydras&#39; The shuttle quickly started up, and with a boost\n&gt; of power quickly took off in the direction of Skyshadow&#39;s last\n&gt; transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; After nearly 30 minutes of flight the ship was begining to come to the\n&gt; approximate location of Skyshadow&#39;s last known location, but so far\n&gt; all that could be scanned was a fading vapor trail. The sensors were\n&gt; picking up that the ship had flown through here at one point, but now\n&gt; was no longer visible.\n&gt;\n&gt; A voice came over the communication band to Hydras&#39; shuttle, &quot;This is\n&gt; the VMP Security Force, you are invading our airspace. You will state\n&gt; your businiess or prepare to be engaged.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
