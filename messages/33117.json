If you&#39;re running, send me an email saying that you&#39;re running, and\n&gt; name the two supporters you got.\n&gt; 2. If you&#39;re supporting someone, send me an email saying who you&#39;re\n&gt; supporting. Remember, if you&#39;re running, you can support one person,\n&gt; if you&#39;re not running, you can support two people.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will be accepting emails all through tomorrow. At that point, I will\n&gt; set up the poll at the site and the voting will begin. If you don&#39;t\n&gt; have a username and password for the site, get one from me, or else\n&gt; you won&#39;t be able to get into the polls.\n\n\n"}}
