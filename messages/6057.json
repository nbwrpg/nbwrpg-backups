I never \nmeant to get anyone in trouble.  I didn&#39;t mean for you to come out \nhere and risk your life for me.  Even if that Pred had come back, I \nwouldn&#39;t want you to get in harms way for me. I&#39;m not worth it.&quot;\n\nShe checked her internal systems and found her wing had healed \nitself.  She transformed into her owl mode. &quot;I can fly again. I wil \nfollow you back to the base.&quot; she said in a low, soft voice. She felt \nlike she made another mistake and was about o make another one by \nfollowing him back to the base.  But part of her spark told her to \nfollow Lunarpine back to the base.\n\n\n"}}
