Not enough strength to keep two\nbots \nin the air, the jetpack burns at its maximum, but the two bots begin \ndecending.\n\nSlayer takes hold of Lunarpine&#39;s arm, attempting to dislodge the bot. \nSomehow, this Maximal seemed familiar to him, like he had met him \nbefore, perhaps in a past life.
