She heard what Veratis said and could \ntell that he ws uncertain about this virus of his.  &quot;Veratis, what \nwould this, virus of yours do? You said it slowly down the translife \nabillities. But what exactly does that mean?&quot;  She could feel the \nform changing and developing into something, but what that was she \ndidn&#39;t know. She cold feel the outside of the protoform, her new \nbody, start to grow skin and fur.  She was very scared.  She didn&#39;t \nknow what was happening or why. Her thoughts ran in a million \ndirectiosns at once, with fearful questions.\n\n&quot;Veratis, you said you didn&#39;t know what would happen if you give this \nvirus to me.  What do you think would happen? I don&#39;t know what is \nging on, but, if you htink it will help...&quot;  she stopped and sayed a \nprayer to the matrix, which Veratis may have heard in his mind.&quot;Do \nit.&quot;\nShe just hoped that this was the right thing to do.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadow Wings Scream echoed through Veratis&#39; mind causing him to \nclench his\n&gt; forhead. &quot;My dear, please don&#39;t panic&quot; he said out loud still \ntrying to\n&gt; figure out what had happened. He studied the insturments carefully \ntrying to\n&gt; find the logic to the situation. The sensors showed nothing more \nthan a\n&gt; normal protoform with the basic abilities of such. He could see the \nfur\n&gt; beginning to form. It had to be slowed until Lunarpine \nreturned. &quot;I&#39;m afraid\n&gt; that theres only one alternative.&quot; He thought about the virus \nagain, he\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to use it not knowing what side effects it might have \nbut he\n&gt; didn&#39;t want her suffering any longer than she had to.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to be honest with you&quot; he said using a slow bedside \nmanner voice\n&gt; He saw no reason to lie to her when she could read his mind. &quot;I \ndeveloped a\n&gt; type of virus that slows down translife abilities, I&#39;d prefer not \nto use it\n&gt; but it could help you adapt, the choice is yours.&quot; he was up \nagainst a wall\n&gt; in this situation. Shadow Wing was confused and it seemed she was\n&gt; frightened. In a way he was frightened too. But such choices were \nbest left\n&gt; to the patient, not the (Mad) scientist.\n\n\n\n"}}
