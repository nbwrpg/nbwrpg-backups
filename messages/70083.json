Shifting back into robot mode Chopshop caught the metal\nchunk he had cut out and laid it to the side, revealing a hole large\nenough for he and Lamia to enter the ship. Water from the interior of\nthe ship began to run through the new hole in the ship.\n\n&gt; Lamia noddes and said &quot;the massster will be pleasssed with this new\n&gt; recluit&quot;She transformed and went inside, moving carfully ready for\n&gt; everything\n\nInside the ship is dark and dank, water has dripped in from the\noutside and pools of it sit on the floor, which both Lamia and\nChopshop step into as the entered, the water reaches up almost to\ntheir knees in spots as they walk, although now with the hold that\nChopshop had cut, the water was quickly draining, and the water level\nis beginning to drop.\n\nThe chamber where they stood seemed to be a cargo hold of some type,\nalthough whatever cargo it held seems to be long gone, if there ever\nwas anything here at all.\n\nTo the right leads back to the engine room of the ship as well as the\nsleeping quarters, although from the size of them, this ship was not\ndesigned for comfort or long travels.\nThe ship itself is not very large\n\nTo the left is the cockpit, which like the rest of the ship, is\nheavily damaged and has water along the floor boards. It is heavily\ncrumpled and a single pilot lay slumped over the controls, the body\nimpaled by several stout tree limbs and large pieces of bent metal.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
