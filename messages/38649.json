I am not saying I will not follow you\n&gt; Megatron, you have done much, and taken the Decepticons far. What I\n&gt; am saying however, is I will not cowl under your antics, to be one of\n&gt; your lackeys you can throw around.  That does nothing but weaken the\n&gt; moral of one and the strength of many.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megatron looked straight at Firestrike, his hands on his hips. &quot;I am\n&gt; &gt; busy now Nightstrike.&quot; He then looked Firestrike with a stare that\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; crush a warship. &quot;Then shoot me, shoot up the Decepticon cause,\n&gt; until I\n&gt; &gt; came around the Decepticons were just a pipe dream, I built this\n&gt; maching\n&gt; &gt; of conquest, SHOOT ME.&quot; he yelled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Menasor looked on in confusion at what was happening, first at\n&gt; &gt; Firestrike, then Megatron.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
