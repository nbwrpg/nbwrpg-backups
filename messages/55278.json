He dug his saw which was in the place of his right hand, down into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras&#39; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arm. With his balance on his left arm, Roddy flipped both legs up to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; double &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dropkick Hydras. After hitting this he back flips away and to his feet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just then Perceptor is heard over the comm system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus stands motionless, and optics look empty, like all hope had been &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lost. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: Enough of this! Maximals, kill these bastards in cold &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fluid!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus&#39; face shows nothing but hate. He grits his teeth together, while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; letting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out an yell that could destroy an audio receptor. He is almost fomeing at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mouth, with the mixed mech fluids that leak from it. The anger causes his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; normally blue optic sensors to turn a crimson red. His gaze locked on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hydras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus empties his mouth, spitting all the energon and other mech fluids &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his mouth at Hydras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: On this day, Galvatron, I&#39;ll finally KILL YOU!!!!!!!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus transformes to car mode and fires his propulsion rockets. Full &lt;BR&gt;&gt; power &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at once, sending Rodimus Prime at Hydras&#39; gut at an airborn 300mph!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Kup : :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the Maximal base Kup was about to take Elita from Cam...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Give her here...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Perceptos message came over the comm sytem as well as a picture on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the monitors.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: By primus no... How could they?! She was a mother, a good bot, she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deserve this. They targeted her just to get at Rodimus...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup drops to the floor.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Cam, you may have to help with that baby more if you can. Her father &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commander, and she just lost her mother...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup looks up at the picture of Perceptor on the monitor.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kup: Rodimus will lose all control now. I fear that are leader is gone, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing machine is in his place. I actually pitty those Predacons now, for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus will do to them. May primus have pitty on their sparks...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I hope I really showed the emotion I meant to in this post. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hatred, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sarrow, all of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; airly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:Perceptor:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;To all maxiamls, and specially to you...
