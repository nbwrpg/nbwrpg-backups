The=\r\nre was something going on here and he\nneeded to get to the bottom of it bef=\r\nore it was too late.\n\nHe was on his way back to the command center when a c=\r\nall came in to him . . .\n\n&gt; &quot;Lord Elder, we&#39;re here, but we dunno what&#39;s go=\r\n&#39;n down with Tucson Prime. Cyclonus asked &#39;em a question and I thought for =\r\nsure he was gonna go after him with a vengeance. But he didn&#39;t. He&#39;s right =\r\nhere, in some sorta trance like state. Hope those creepoids didn&#39;t get insi=\r\nde his directory. Quickstride, how is he?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride shrugs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; No=\r\nthn&#39; yet Rat Trap, he&#39;s in deep thought. Sir, we dunno what ta make of this=\r\n, we never saw anything like this before. Got any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; They look to the video com link device on Rat Trap&#39;s arm as they wait for=\r\n an answer.\n\nElder looked at Rat Trap and Quickstride through the comlink, =\r\ntaking a\nmoment to comprehend just what he was hearing. Finally he shook hi=\r\ns\nhead, &quot;I doubt that he has been taken over.&quot;\n\nElder shrugged slightly, fe=\r\neling every bit uneasy about events, and\nvery much out of his depth, &quot;There=\r\n are very few who could take over a\nPrime.&quot; he said confidently, although h=\r\ne could think of a few, one of\nthe insecticons for one. He was certainly gl=\r\nad those guys weren&#39;t\naround.\n\n&quot;If you guys are where I think you are, then=\r\n you need to get Tuscon\nout of there. You guys are an easy target with Tusc=\r\non frozen like\nthat. How come you guys didn&#39;t just storm the fortress . . .=\r\n &quot;\n\nElder peered into the scene behind Rat Trap and Quickstride, &quot;Ahhhh,\nHy=\r\ndras has sank he base.&quot;\n\nElder thought for a moment, &quot;Legacy and I had been=\r\n experimenting with\nexplosive depth charges to counter that.&quot; Elder rubbed =\r\nhis chin\nthoughtfully, &quot;If you can create a breach in Hydras&#39; walls from th=\r\ne\noutside while it is submerged, I don&#39;t think even he would like all\nthat =\r\nhot magma running into his base.&quot;\n\nElder shrugged, &quot;We never got a chance t=\r\no test it, and we weren&#39;t sure\nif it would work anyways.&quot; He glanced over a=\r\nt Tuscon through Rat\nTrap&#39;s video feed, sadness on his face, &quot;It&#39;s too bad =\r\nyou don&#39;t have\nany explosive charges with you . . . &quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
