Send a flier to check the base out.  \n&gt; The maximals may still have an eye on the base seeing if we might \n&gt; come back.  One bot go to scout around the old base, then report \n&gt; back.  Another flier go and look for another base.&quot;  She stopped and \n&gt; had to catch her breath.  She coughed and whimpered.  &quot;Then go \n&gt; and..and..&quot; She groaned as her ribs ached in protest of wanting to \n&gt; breath.  She broke out in a small sweat and shivered. She was having \n&gt; trouble breathing.  &quot;then go and find a place for us to hole up for \n&gt; the night.  We will look for a new base in the morning.&quot;  She coughed \n&gt; and groaned.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
