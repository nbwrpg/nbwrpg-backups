Heed the call of Megatron.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What sounded like whispers for but a moment, broke away to sile=\r\nnce. Then a ghostly reverse echo that whispered and barely heard. Soon enou=\r\ngh was well heard. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Megatron?&quot; the femme voice replied almost in disb=\r\nelief. \n&gt; The spark pulsed a moment as though it were contemplating or some=\r\nthing else. But definitely feeding off the energon. \n&gt; &quot;I am most grateful =\r\nfor the energon and the rescue.&quot; That calm deep femme voice stated. &quot;And ho=\r\nnored to once again be in thy presense, oh, mighty Megatron.&quot; Her voice sin=\r\ncere to every degree. There was only one whom she respected 100%... and tha=\r\nt was Megatron. \n&gt; &quot;I am forever in your debt.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; The spark hummed with=\r\n light, brilliant and glowing, sparks of controlled energy in gold and blue=\r\n. Glowing like a star in the heavens.\n&gt;\n\n\nSilence overtook the vicinity onc=\r\ne more. Darkness and silence. Not that it was a bad thing... but it wasn&#39;t =\r\na good thing either. \nThe spark pulsed from time to time, feeding off the e=\r\nnergy that was offered to it, recovering. \nIt had recovered enough strength=\r\n for the time being. Some sparks recalled past memories. It took some time,=\r\n but this particular spark was able to recall much. The last moments it was=\r\n functioning or alive was as some predacon to assasinate someone. And a nam=\r\ne, a face, a sensation seemed to reverberate causing the spark to pulse.\n\nN=\r\nearby the spark, a chassis was being constructed. A large one. One nearly t=\r\nhe height of the original Megatron. As drone parts worked furiously upon th=\r\ne chassis, the spark pulsed moreso. The containment that held it, nurtured =\r\nit, opened and out floated the spark. \n\nLike a ghost, it wandered about bef=\r\nore leaving the facility. For the time being, the spark had forgotten about=\r\n it&#39;s rescuer. But it would return. Soon or eventually. \n\n\n"}}
