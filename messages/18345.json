She looked tired, \nbeaten, ragged. She was definetly under alot of stress lately. &quot;We can hold \nthem over the comm-link, its not top secret.&quot;\n    She took a seat and began, &quot;Now, both of us are capable leaders with \ncapable crews, but the Predacons seem to be getting more and more distnat \nfrom each other. Thats why I wish to join your group. Together, under your \nleadership, and with my own input, I think both of our teams could unite the \nPredacons for good. Right now, our main problem is Hell Beast and Megatron. \nHell Beast left and I cant locate him anywhere, I fear that he might decide \nto take Megatron out himself, and if he fails Megatron would surely convert \nhim. Together they would be unstopable. So, what do you say? Do I have the \nhonor of joining your team or what?&quot; She said, truthfully and with no hint of \ntreachery. Aracnia really did want to join with Kitkat....the backstabbing \ngames were over. This was a time to be serious.\n\n    Tarantulas and Aerostreak limed after Hell Beast, a good distance behinde \nthem. Tarantulas wasnt going to let this chance pass him by, to find Megatron \nthat is. Once located he would tell Aracnia and get all the credit.\n    &quot;Hurry up bird brain! Were going to lose them!&quot; The spider hissed at \nAerostreak who scooted after the spider in vhicle form. He was hard to keep \nup with.\n    &quot;Shut up you fatt assed spider! I cant go as fast as you!&quot; He said back, \nand looked on the scanners to see that Hell Beast and Gremlin came to an \nabrupt stop at a moutian. &quot;Why stop at a mountian?&quot;\n    They continued on in the artic cold until the mountian came into view. \nThe signitures of Hell Beast and Gremlin were at the base of the mound. \nTarantulas and Aerostreak stoped and watched.\n\n    &quot;Who the hell is it? How did they find me?&quot; Megatron screamed at the \nMaximal counterparts, who still didnt realize they were serving a Predacon. \nHe glared a them, &quot;Well damn it?&quot;\n    Nighteyes spoke, &quot;Sir, they claim to be Senetor Hell Beast and Major \nGremlin. Ive never heard of them before.&quot; She then put her head down and went \nback in line.\n    Megatron thought a moment. This could be a trap, or a very good \noppertunity. With Ol&#39; Hell Beast on his side, they would make an exceptional \nfighting force. If he were to talk to Hell Beast himself.....\n    &quot;Take them to the main entrance. I will meet them there. I want you armed \nand ready to fight if nessecery. Understood?&quot; He said getting up.\n    Waspinator nodded and left to let Hell Beast and Gremlin inside while the \nthree Maximals grabed wepons and left. Megatron prepared himself for what \nmight be a meeting of bloodshed, or a meeting of destiny.\n\n"}}
