Landing softly beside the downed &#39;bot, he looked towards \nthe true battlefield.\n\nThe Decepticons were retreating.\n\nHe had arrived too late for the battle. But he could cover the \nretreat and take the downed Perceptor, be he an ally in need of \nrepair, or enemy to use as a hostage.\n\nPutting away his laser swords he transformed into his dragon form.  \nUsing one of his huge foreclaws he grabbed perceptor and headed \ntowards the other retreating Decepticons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
