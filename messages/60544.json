Rodimus had good intentions, but Malice was right in this instance.\n&quot;No, they can&#39;t reprogram or kill me.  How can they destroy what they do not understand?  My body is a complex marvel, my ability to heal, my power absorbtion, everything that I can do is to enable my ultimate survival.  So I very much doubt their ability to kill me.  But don&#39;t tell them that.  When they get sick of me, they&#39;ll surrender to be rid of me!&quot;\nWithout much warning, Malice stunned Rodimus, knocked him out, and drug him a short distance for safety.  He then charged toward the minions, intent on fulfilling his plan.\n \nOrganics tried to take assurance in Nightlight&#39;s words, she still felt the fear of losing Malice again.  She jarred back to reality when Nightlight hugged her.  The larger femme shuddered and lowered her head.\n&quot;But Malice...?  Even he can&#39;t take them all...&quot;\n \nHellplague charged forward as Malice ran forward.  She tackled him, and while he was on the ground, Splattercannon and Necross pulled his arms behind his back.  The two had to push his arms back so hard that his left arm didn&#39;t dislocate, it almost completely severed.  Hellplague bound Malice&#39;s arms, and feet, and grabbed his tail.  She pulled on his tail to get him up, which the prisoner naturally refused.  Malice looked over to Organics, who was desperatly injured.\n&#39;Don&#39;t worry, sis,&#39; he said silently,&#39; I won&#39;t be long.  They will be sick of me before he next sunset.&#39;\nHellplague back handed him and then she and Necross picked him up.  Splattercannon transformed into his gunship mode and flew cover as Hellplague loaded her new &#39;pet&#39; onboard.  She decended and cackled madly, and insulted the Maximals.\n&quot;Thanks for the new toy!  We&#39;ll come back later and finish you off later!&quot;\nMalice was able to shout over the roar of Splattercannon&#39;s engines, to encourage his allies.\n&quot;You&#39;ll have to live the next day before that, minion!  I&#39;ll be back before nightfall tomorrow!  Nightlight!  Tell Wolfblade and Organics, I&#39;ll come back before too long.&quot;\nSplattercannon touched off his engines and took off, towards Unicron.  Necross turned and followed, as did the few remaining Sweeps.\n&quot;Minions, return to Unicron!  A rest before we finish off these fools!&quot;  Hellplague shouts as she transformed into vehicle mode and wited for the others to leave.\n \nOrganics looked up and saw Malice being whisked away.  SHe threw herself from Nightlight and tried to crawl to Malice, but her legs refused to respond, and she looked up to the shrinking shape that bore her brother.\n&quot;Come back soon, brother.&quot; she whispered before collapsing on the ground,&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;\n \nOOC: Don&#39;t worry.  Malice is going to be ok, so just let him go and I&#39;ll return him soon.\n\nairly2000 &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\nRodimus/windlord/BlackFang/Nightlight(Sedna)/BlackNightmare:\n\n&quot;Never my friend&quot;said serioulsy Rodimus while he moved Malice \ntowards a safe place &quot;I lost several good friends...
