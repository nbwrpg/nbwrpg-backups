Also, \nthere is a bot attacking the Allience base.\nKitKat is talking to Megatron about destroying the Allince before the \nkillling the maximals, KitKat opened a link to Destructor so he could \nlisten in on the conversation, but not talk to her.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  sorry I havent posted in a few days.
