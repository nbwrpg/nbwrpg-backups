Her chest wounds were to extensive for her \ninternal healing systems to heal.  She was laying in a puddle of her own \nmech fluid.  She heard the noise of the predacons storming the ship \nsomewhere in the back of her mind.  She couldn&#39;t hold on any longer.  She \nslipped away into nothingness.  Her spark joined with the Matrix.\n\nPlease put Fidgit on the deceased list.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
