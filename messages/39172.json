Every wire in his body strains at\nthe effort to keep himself upright. Then as he looked out of the window,\nhis jaw fell wide open. The rock they had crashed into was just as\nbeautiful as he remembered. They had arrived on earth. He felt all his\ninjurys leave him, and leapt up, throwing his fist triumphantly into the\nair. &quot;Yahhoooooo.&quot; he screamed. He then realized no one else was around,\nhe quickly ran along to try and find someone. He eventually stumbled\ninto the storage bay. With bewilderment he started. &quot;Can you guys\nbelieve it, it&#39;s magnificent.&quot; he said with pure excitemen, and a smile\nso large, it looked like his face would fall of his hinges.\n\n"}}
