It was obvious that this \nwasn&#39;t going to be over any time soon and she then leaned all her weight \nagainst the trunk, simply relaxing in the company of her own enemies.\nShe looked over at the small battle, amusement written on her face.\nBrightBlade then turned her attention towards Perndabot, noticing his thanx \nand info about the captured Maximals.\nShe smiled at him, calmly and without any other meaning bahind it. But then \nthe smile turned a bit on the evil side but one that was directed towards \nher next sentance...not towards the Alliance member.*\n\n&quot; Maximals are ALWAYS pathetic in battle. They may not seem so at times but \nsoon their true weakness are shown. Never fails.&quot;\n\n* BrightBlade then looked Perndabot over, noticing that he wasn&#39;t all that \nbad for an Allaince bot. Even a bit on the handsome side.\nShe smiled at him again, with no real meaning behind it other then to \nclerify her statement.*\n\n&quot; You know, you&#39;re a rather handsome bot...when you&#39;re not pointing a gun at \nanother.&quot;\n\n* But she then turned her head towards the battle again, simply not wanting \nto see if the Alliance male shoved his blaster down her throat for what she \nhad just said.\nIt wasn&#39;t normal for a Predacon to be standing beside an Alliance member and \nsimply not be battleing each other, the fact that a Predacon had just \ncommented an Alliance member only making the situation more odd.\nBut BrightBlade didn&#39;t care, she just simply spoke her mind...in hope that \nHell Beast didn&#39;t hear about this.\nBut then her mind switched to him, her commander with the power over her to \nsimply crush her life in the palm of his hand...and she would let him!\nHer faith lied in him, the only bot she had EVER let rule over her...and \nfollowed so blindly and with total trust.\nIt was just her, nothing more. But she trusted him, something in which she \nhad never done before.\nBrightBlade then sighed as she uncrossed her arms and ran her fingers \nthrough her fur which crested her head, then simply placing a hand against \nher hip watching the fight.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
