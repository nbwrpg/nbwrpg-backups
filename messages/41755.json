Operation Retrieval.&quot; As he \nfinishes, he turns to look at the other decepticons present, thus \ndismissing his cassettes to complete their operation. On a side \nthough, he wonders where Megatron is.\n\nFrenzy leaps out of the slot, and transforms spinning and landing in \na crouch on the ground. &quot;Rumble, lets go. Maybe we&#39;ll get to mash \nsome metal along the way.&quot; Frenzy stops, &quot;Uhh, so where are we going, \nSoundwave?&quot;\n\nooc: Kinger, where is you bot?\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rumble looked up to Soundwave and sighed, as Spasstik finished \ngrowling,\n&gt; and followed Frenzy, taking a step back, then using the momentum to \nleap\n&gt; up and transform, neatly entering Soundwave. Rumble wanted some \nkind of\n&gt; action after so many years of imprisonment. He had waited for three\n&gt; hundred years, he wasnt looking forward to waiting any longer. He \ntook a\n&gt; step forward to leap up, and transformed, but stopped, and listened\n&gt; carefully. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Soun, Soundwave, you hear that?&quot; he asked cheerfully. &quot;It&#39;s someone\n&gt; who&#39;s looking for some Decepticons. Let me and Frenzy go meet him.&quot;\n&gt; Rumble said, demanding instead of asking, as he looked up to the \nlarge\n&gt; Decepticon Comunicator.\n\n\n"}}
