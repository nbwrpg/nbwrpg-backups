First off why do you think I used the word founder and not \nthe word Council Member.  Because a founder had power before all the \nfounders quit and then the council took over because they wanted the \nRPG to continue.\n\n   If you Read the about section at nbwrpg.com, then you will hear a \nmention about the founders.  The guys from Louisiana  (Hey Yan, you \nmight want to fix Luisiana to Lousiana.)  were the founders.  The \nfounders were the ones that came up with the whole idea of Neo Beast \nWars RPG.  Does the name Biostinger familiar to you.  Well I am not \nhim, but I go to the same school as him and I made NBWRPG with him.\n\n   I was the one that called him one day and said hey (I don&#39;t think \nhe wants his name reveled) Biostinger, you know how you wanted to \nmake an Beast Wars Rpg earlier, well I have an Idea for the Story \nline.  So I told him the story line.  He liked it and we figure that \nour good friend should be a co-founder.  We than had Biostinger \ngo into the Beastwars RPG AOL Chatroom(He was the only one with AOL)  \nI ended up making sites saying join NBWRPG.  And well Firestorm 316 \ngr81(The Co-founder) just sat around and watched.\n\n   So, I am instrumental in the making of this RPG.\n\n   And also, Whem I say founder, I mean when I made this RPG, and if \nI say council, then I am mentioning the Council.\n\nNOTE:  The main reason Firestorm 316 Gr81 just sat around and watch \nis because hid Dad was very very very very very very very Strict.\n\nNOTE:  If anyone wants to take this up with me than email me at \nproto@...(Temp address While Hotmail fix things up.)\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Roland the Gunslinger&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: He is, and so are Jeff, Alloran, and Megan, although Megan&#39;s \nnever on anymore. Unless the Council Election is over, Hedge isn&#39;t a \nfounder yet. My pal Jer is also getting on the Council, it seems, and \nmy good friend Alloran is sadly leaving the Council, as it seems \nright now. My friend Jeff is staying on, it seems, and my pal Lurker \ndidn&#39;t go on at all. Alot of mixed emotions about this whole Coucil \nElection for me!...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: dewboy30816@y... \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, July 19, 2001 10:15 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: Questions\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I thought Zardus was in charge?\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., hugar_twriker@y... wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; 1.
