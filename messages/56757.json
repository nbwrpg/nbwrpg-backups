But to her, it felt as though it were him \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;touching &amp; kissing her. Oh, how she wished she were there. His words, especially \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;wishing she was there so that he could shower her with kisses warmed her \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;lasercore terribly. Causing the ache to grow. &quot;I can only imagine, Hydras,&quot; she purred \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;warmly. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Then she replied about Blackstorm, &quot;Yes, she has been kept well enough busy. &amp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; far enough away from prying Autobot optics. If they wanted to find her, they \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;would be led on a long wild roboto-goose chase. She did pick up a couple new \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;bots, unknown what side they serve. &amp; as I said, on our way to rendezvous with \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Decepticons she intercepted. She&#39;s doing rather well, for being \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;reprogrammed.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;Then she dropped to a deeper voice &amp; a slightly serious tone. &quot;We have a \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;slight little issue. I was at the Ark. We have some new arrivals at the Ark as \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;well. One claims to be the combined offspring of Megatron &amp; Optimus Prime.&quot; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt;She waited for his response to that one. \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;MSN Fotos: la forma m�s f�cil de compartir e imprimir fotos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.msn.com/8HMRESMX/2752??PS=&quot;&gt;Haz clic aqu� &lt;/a&gt; Get 2 months FREE*. &lt;/html&gt;\n\n"}}
