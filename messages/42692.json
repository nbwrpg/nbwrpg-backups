Decepticons Forever/\nAutobots Roll OUT\n\n\n&gt; OOC: Okay everyone, I want to get this game moving, since many people\n&gt; have stated, it has stopped, almost for good. I know that rAuq and Yan\n&gt; are temporarily away, that Megan has quit (sigh) and that people never\n&gt; seem to reply  anymore. Another problem is we have a new council dropped\n&gt; on it&#39;s head (okay not really a council, ME for christ sakes, Hedge\n&gt; where are you?) and I never was told what to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, no one replied to my last rant, I repeat, everyone must at\n&gt; least skim every message to make sure it does not apply to them, and if\n&gt; it does, reply. No one said anything about me playing out rAuq&#39;s\n&gt; characters, and Lurker, Airly, you guys never replied to my ask for\n&gt; suggestions on how to be a better leader, making it so I am not even\n&gt; sure if you guys read it. Kslawdogg, if you could get this IGL going\n&gt; please, so we can speed up the RPG, also, WHat happened to Grimlock, did\n&gt; you post about it? What about Jagged and Nightmare. Without further Apu,\n&gt; and since no one argued, here is a super long post.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nPacifix/Technobots/Menasor/Abominus/Astrotrain/Swoop/Grimlock/Jagged/Nightma\nre/Megatron/Hook/Bonecrusher/Soundwave/Frenzy/Rumble/Spinister/\n&gt; Crossroads/Firedrill/Cliffjumper/Beachcomber/Hoist.\n&gt;\n&gt; Autobots\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; Beachcomber looked on in awe, as the ship disapeared with his friends.\n&gt; He ran up to RedHot, &quot;They, they got away.&quot; he mummured.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scattershot looked oh, &quot;Oh no they won&#39;t, not with a Technobot.&quot; he then\n&gt; turned to them. &quot;Transform, and roll out.&quot; he shouted, as he leapt into\n&gt; the air, and transformed into his Jet mode, speeding away towards the\n&gt; Arena like ship, the other Technobots followed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pacifix looked on as his troops were scattering. &quot;No, not now, not\n&gt; without a plan.&quot; he said in disbelief, as the ships doors folded open,\n&gt; Hoist trudging out.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The computer is back online sir.&quot; Hoist said in ignorance to what was\n&gt; happening.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt;\n&gt; Decepticons\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt;\n&gt; Dominjoe landed near the Constructicons and Soundwave, as they all\n&gt; looked around. The cockpit opened, and Megatron flew out of it,\n&gt; transforming into his large robot mode. He looked to his old troops, and\n&gt; began to speak informally.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Greetings Decepticons, It is time to rejoin the cause you gave your\n&gt; life to Millions of years ago, that, or be oblitorated.&quot; he said, firing\n&gt; his fusion cannon into the air to add an exclamation point to his\n&gt; phrase.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bonecrusher looked in awe. &quot;It can&#39;t be, Megatron.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rumble and Frenzy walked forward away from Proto 1000. &quot;Yeah, we saw you\n&gt; die.&quot; They said in unison.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soundwave looked at both of them, no emotion showing on his face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Megatron obviously exists.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; Decepticon Ship\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Come on, hurry up Abominus.&quot; Astrotrains voice complained, showing the\n&gt; weariness in him. Then out of nowhere the island began to shake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile deep under the water, Abominus plunged his second hand deep\n&gt; within the core of the Islands anchor to the earth, as he placed his big\n&gt; hands around the ship, then he began to pull, his eyes showing no sign\n&gt; of intelligence, as he placed his foot on the island core for leverage.\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; Grimlock&#39;s rescue attempt\n&gt; ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt;\n&gt; Grimlock arced towards the giant threatening robot. &quot;Wrong, you release\n&gt; Autobots, and Grimlock not smash you.&quot; he yelled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Behind the ship, Firedrill finally arrived, and transformed, and began\n&gt; banging his fists agains it&#39;s armored sides. &quot;Let Cliffjumper gooooooo.&quot;\n&gt; He screamed with rage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
