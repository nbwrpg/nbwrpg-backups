She flew down to him and hovered on the \nbreese. &quot;What is going on?  are you going on a mission of some sort?&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;         Dollen grumbled.  He looked at Reptilica, and then at \nStarscream, and then at Phobia.  When he looked at Phobia he \nsneered.  Then he looked up at GoldenEye, flying off.  He was going \ninsane!!!  He couldn&#39;t take it anymore!!  Suddenly, his mind was \nblinded, by images of the beautiful bot he thought he was over.  He \nheld his head in his hands, and fell down on his knees.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Uggghh, who are you!!!!!!  What do you want!!!!!!  I don&#39;t \nlike you, stop this!!&quot; He mumbled.\n&gt; \n&gt;       He kept repeating to himself, &quot;I don&#39;t like you, I don&#39;t like \nyou, I don&#39;t like you......&quot; He kept saying to himself, his voice \ndrifting off into the air.  Then he suddenly saw, in his mind, all of \nthe Predacons.  He was looking up at them.  They were laughing at \nhim, laughing hysterically.  Then he saw GoldenEye, making out with \nanother bot.  Suddenly, all the bots there started saying, &quot;Reject!!  \nA Reject!  A Reject!!  Nothing but a reject!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;Nooooo, noooo!!!!!  Go away!!!!  It&#39;s not true!!  \nNOOOOO!!!!,&quot; Then, his mind snapped back to where he was, what was \ngoing on.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore!!!!!  I&#39;m sorry, fellow team mates, \nI have to get away.  I can&#39;t do this anymore!!  I need some time to \ncool off, when you see GoldenEye again, tell her I am gone, but I \nstill want to be there for her,&quot; And with that, he turned, and walked \naway, into the shadows, and he couldn&#39;t be seen anymore.  \nUnfortunately for him, he still had Phobia&#39;s baby implanted on him.\n\n\n"}}
