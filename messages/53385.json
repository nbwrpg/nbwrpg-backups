Empath&#39;s gratified to learn that her initial\n&gt; &gt;assessment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;was correct, but she&#39;s not done.  Briefly, she opens her own \nmind\n&gt; &gt;to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the Maximal, allowing him to see all she&#39;s seen - from her \ncreation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;millions of years ago, through the Great War, to the pain of \nlosing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Skywarp to Galvatron&#39;s selfish machinations.  She shows him the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reformatting, when she became a predacon trapped under \nGalvatron&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;control; finding the Soul Orb and accidentally freeing \nherself; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;finally, she shows the recent events that have drawn them to \nthis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;moment - and the fact that her own emotions mirror his.\n&gt; http://messenger.microsoft.com/es\n\n\n"}}
