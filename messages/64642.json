I want them near termination, but still alive.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jotunn, on his side, also decided to help. He called Olympus, which\n&gt;   was nearer to Atlantis and mobilized troops.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Jotunn: Mobilize two Governmental battalions. They have five Minions\n&gt;   as targets. Bring them down!\n&gt; \n&gt;   He also entered a code that mobilized his nameless second into the\n&gt;   fight. Things would get very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
