Inferno you will come\n&gt; with me, Tarantulous and all vailable Predacons will come as well; Fractil\n&gt; and Sky shadow, take the minimal requierent of predacons that you need to\n&gt; defend the base incase of attack, specially those that doesnt have\n&gt; unicronian origin; Fractil, you will rebiuld the defence protocols and when\n&gt; you have done it give me them to me; Its time to act&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras walekd towards the exit\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a nod from CRYOTEK as he stood up from the table, his wings\nfolding down around him like an elegant cape. &quot;My shuttle is not far\nfrom here. It was my means of transport as I came to your base.&quot;\n\nAfter exiting HYDRAS ship he quickly shifted into his beast mode a\nlarge dark blue transmetal dragon with ice blue highlights. He was\nevery bit as large as HYDRAS himself, as his wings flexed outwards and\ncaught the air and began to rise.\n\nMeanwhile SKYSHADOW nodded as he glanced back at FRACTYL who also he a\nslight nod. &quot;Your ship shall be as you left it.&quot; SKYSHADOW said as he\nturned back to HYDRAS his smile ingraciating.\n\nAs they rose higher into the air they could see CRYOTEK&#39;s ship just\nover the next rise. His &#39;shuttle&#39; was actually a small cargo freighter\ndesigned for planatary landings. Smooth and areodynamic, it was built\nto take the rigors of space but was able to easily penatrate the\natmosphere of planets as well.\n\nThe door of the ship was already opening as CRYOTEK, HYDRAS,\nTARANTULUS, INFERNO came in for a landing. Behind them BRUTICUS X also\ncame, one of the guards that was used to watch over prisoners, as well\nas IGUANUS and WASPINATOR.\n\nInside the cargo section of the ship there were CR chambers were\nstored, and even as CRYOTEK was leading the others into the ship they\nwere already begining to charge up, waking up their occupants as\nenergy shunts were retracting. There was a click and a hiss as doors\nthat had been closed for quite some time finally broke their seal and\nbegan to open.\n\n&quot;Occupants active.&quot; came the femenine voice of CRYOTEK&#39;s computer.\n\nInside the chamber there were two protoforms sitting in CR chambers,\none black and the other clear, but most important there were two other\nCR chambers that were opening up, steam and other assorted gasses\nbillowing out as the occupant&#39;s optics began to glow with life.\n\nCYROTEK gestured to HYDRAS to enter the chamber, &quot;After you, meet your\nnew . . . or should I say old soldiers.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
