This \ntime he was stuck in some sort of venting system, and he was talking \nto someone below. When he looked closer, he saw that it was the bat \ngirl again! What did she have to do with his life? He heard her yell \nback to him, and he immediatly flew back to the cave. He saw another \nbot there, but introductions would come later. He needed answers.\n\n&quot;Thank You for forgiving me. But I need you to answer my question. \nWhat do you know about my past life?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
