There is no Q in my name.\n&gt;   2. The fact that vehicons are mostly the original bot has nothing \nto \n&gt;   do with that Megatron being an attemt to purge himself of organic \n&gt;   life.\n&gt;   3. Then why is there a Jetstorm in this storyline.\n&gt;   4. I am not going to let it go.\n&gt;   5. You don&#39;t own an Anglion char so you can&#39;t say the&#39;re from \nanother \n&gt;   dimension.\n&gt;   6. You basically just said that NBW never happened in Optimus \nFury&#39;s \n&gt;   timeline then how does he know to go south to find the alliance \nbase?\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., Legendarynemasis@a... wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; Vehicons arent Vehicons. like 98 percent of all the original \n&gt;   transformers \n&gt;   &gt; transformed into some type of machine.
