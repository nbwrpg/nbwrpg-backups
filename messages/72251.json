After all, he did get an idea of his stormy like temper before they got =\r\nseparated .  It would be interesting to have a battle between Magmatron and=\r\n Tucson, as a challenge to preserve the land from further harm.  One on one=\r\n, in an honorable battle, in warrior mode of course.  And the one who remai=\r\nns on his feet, wins the freedom of the land and it&#39;s inhabitants.  He who =\r\nloses, must retreat honorably and give up the opposition he so desperately =\r\nfights for.  It would be an ultimate test of Honor and courage for Tucson, =\r\nwho must realize that sometimes doing the right thing is to anticipate defe=\r\nat and learn from that in order to avoid it the next time one faces a formi=\r\ndable enemy.  It&#39;s a lesson no mentor can teach him, it&#39;s a lesson he needs=\r\n to learn on his own.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s a good plot seeing that for a bot=\r\n, he has a lot of backbone and unlike Rodimus, perhaps just a little too mu=\r\nch of it.  It goes with having his father&#39;s temperament and stubbornness.  =\r\nThat too is turning out to be a challenge for him, because Ratchet may have=\r\n been the chief CMO, but never a Prime.  Tucson, who is very much like Ratc=\r\nhet, is a Prime who is having to work with temperament issues as well as th=\r\ne issues impacting everyone else.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Rodimus started sassing the Pre=\r\nds while on Tucson&#39;s back, Tucson was trying desperately to form an allianc=\r\ne and was not in the mood for snide commentary.  His reaction was similar t=\r\no how Ratchet might have commented on it.  Good thing Rodimus didn&#39;t get th=\r\ne classic &quot; Give me one good reason why I shouldn&#39;t reformat your hard driv=\r\ne and turn you into a garbage scow!&quot;\n&gt; But when Tucson lost his temper Rodi=\r\nmus may have picked up on his voice pattern which sounds EXACTLY like Ratch=\r\net when he lost his temper.  I don&#39;t recall Rodimus&#39;s relationship with Rat=\r\nchet but he could probably get an idea that Tucson is from the same mold as=\r\n the old CMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perpetually on the move and constantly busy. \n&gt; \n&gt; On Se=\r\np 18, 2011, at 7:13 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Good, wonderful, excellent!

Tuscon will be fortunate to ge=\r\nt out in one peace. :)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Magmatron is a very ol=\r\nd soldier, and his been through countless battles and he is most likely the=\r\n most formidable opponant that Tuscon&nbsp;or perhaps anyone else here on O=\r\nld Earth has met thus far, except for maybe some of the older Unicronians.&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Do not be too quick to act is my advise=\r\n to Tuscon. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;- Preston&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sun, Sep 18, 2011 at 10:36 AM, Sandy Panico &lt;spa=\r\nn dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:magicquartz@...&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cool, so even when Rodimus sees lightning and hears=\r\n thunder, he too will think of Tucson or may very well see him and those el=\r\nements in a dream. &nbsp;After all, he did get an idea of his stormy like t=\r\nemper before they got separated . &nbsp;It would be interesting to have a b=\r\nattle between Magmatron and Tucson, as a challenge to preserve the land fro=\r\nm further harm. &nbsp;One on one, in an honorable battle, in warrior mode o=\r\nf course. &nbsp;And the one who remains on his feet, wins the freedom of th=\r\ne land and it&#39;s inhabitants. &nbsp;He who loses, must retreat honorably and=\r\n give up the opposition he so desperately fights for. &nbsp;It would be an =\r\nultimate test of Honor and courage for Tucson, who must realize that someti=\r\nmes doing the right thing is to anticipate defeat and learn from that in or=\r\nder to avoid it the next time one faces a formidable enemy. &nbsp;It&#39;s a le=\r\nsson no mentor can teach him, it&#39;s a lesson he needs to learn on his own. &=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I think it&#39;s a good plot seeing that for =\r\na bot, he has a lot of backbone and unlike Rodimus, perhaps just a little t=\r\noo much of it. &nbsp;It goes with having his father&#39;s temperament and stubb=\r\nornness. &nbsp;That too is turning out to be a challenge for him, because R=\r\natchet may have been the chief CMO, but never a Prime. &nbsp;Tucson, who is=\r\n very much like Ratchet, is a Prime who is having to work with temperament =\r\nissues as well as the issues impacting everyone else.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;When Rodimus started sassing the Preds while on Tucson&#39;s back, Tucso=\r\nn was trying desperately to form an alliance and was not in the mood for sn=\r\nide commentary. &nbsp;His reaction was similar to how Ratchet might have co=\r\nmmented on it. &nbsp;Good thing Rodimus didn&#39;t get the classic &quot; Give me on=\r\ne good reason why I shouldn&#39;t reformat your hard drive and turn you into a =\r\ngarbage scow!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;But when Tucson lost his temper Rodimus may have=\r\n picked up on his voice pattern which sounds EXACTLY like Ratchet when he l=\r\nost his temper. &nbsp;I don&#39;t recall Rodimus&#39;s relationship with Ratchet bu=\r\nt he could probably get an idea that Tucson is from the same mold as the ol=\r\nd CMO.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpetually on the move and const=\r\nantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;On Sep 18, 2011, at 7:13 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyc=\r\nlonus@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...=\r\nm&quot;&gt;supercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;bl=\r\nockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Good, =\r\nwonderful, excellent!&nbsp;I have no problems with that!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I hope to post later today or tommorrow.

But what do you mean by flashes&lt;br&gt;of lightning?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Just making sure=\r\n I have a clear understanding before I have a clear&lt;br&gt;understanding. Tusco=\r\nn&#39;s sonic roar could be as loud as thunder and&lt;br&gt;even perhaps sound like i=\r\nt, but would not be thunder in the sense of&lt;br&gt;\nbeing part of the weather p=\r\natterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For instance nearby thunder can range as loud as 120 Db. Fo=\r\nr&lt;br&gt;references: This is roughly the equivalent to being within 200 feet of=\r\n&lt;br&gt;a jet aircraft during take-off or about 3 feet from an auto horn. A&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nchain saw is rated around 100 decibels. A sound of 140 decibels is&lt;br&gt;pain=\r\nfully loud. [Note each 10 decibel increase in noise level seems&lt;br&gt;twice as=\r\n loud.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would imagine that Tuscon is probrably like Brawl in this =\r\nmatter,&lt;br&gt;\nbut more effective in its use, meaning he can hit at almost 300=\r\n Db if&lt;br&gt;conscentrated into a blast, probrably 200 in a cone and 150 in a =\r\nwave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;300 (BEAM) can blow out metal and concrete and such like. Basi=\r\ncally as&lt;br&gt;\npowerful as any blast Megatron, Gavatron, Optimus Prime, Rodim=\r\nus or&lt;br&gt;any other leader type can deliver. It is just created from Sonic&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;energies rather than more conventional energies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;200 (CONE) Could =\r\nconcievably kill a human and probrably cause serious&lt;br&gt;\ndamage on some of =\r\nthe sensative inner workings of a transformer. Could&lt;br&gt;do things like blow=\r\n out glass and other unprotected crystalized&lt;br&gt;materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;150 (CIRC=\r\nLE) Painfully loud and POSSIBLY stunning affects.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Here is a list of=\r\n Db counts. I cannot say I would follow it&lt;br&gt;religiously, since this is a =\r\nScifi settings and the transformers are&lt;br&gt;not human, but it would give you=\r\n an idea and could spark creativity.&lt;br&gt;However some things may not work ex=\r\nactly as planned.
