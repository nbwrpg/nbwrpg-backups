By the way, do you have any lubricating\noil onboard?  My shoulder is begining to show signs of friction. \nAnyway, I will be finished inspecting your engines in about 100 cycles\nand at that point I will be able to tell you if these engines are\nsalvagable.&quot;\n\nCeleron then abruptly turned away from Hellplague and returned to his work.\n\n\nOn Fri, 29 Oct 2004 09:35:36 -0700 (PDT), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hellplague stirred a while later, and sat up in the bed.  She needed some\n&gt; energon, and she did not know if there was any avalible on the ship.  She\n&gt; looked around in the room and found an insulated bin filled with small\n&gt; energon cubes.  Taking out two hand fulls, she stepped out and decided that\n&gt; Celeron needed reward for his work on the computer.  She heard someone in\n&gt; the back of the ship, and she stepped back there and found Celeron\n&gt; inspecting the engines.  She cleared her throat and handed Celeron a few\n&gt; cubes of energon.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; rm2kmidi &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After a few hours, Celeron woke up.  The ship was rather quiet and he\n&gt; decided now would be a good time to inspect the engines to see if he\n&gt; could actually fix them.  He looked around for a light switch, then\n&gt; began checking the condition of all the equipment in the engine hold. \n&gt; He figured this would take at least 2 hours....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;NOW...
