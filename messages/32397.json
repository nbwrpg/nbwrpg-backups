I&#39;ve missed out \n&gt; on some really good chances to build some stories with you guys, but \n&gt; I hope that I can post more soon. I will be posting regularely, but \n&gt; not as much as I used to. Hopefully soon I can resume as I used to. \n&gt; Alloran, as far as i&#39;m concerened you guys can use Abominus this \n&gt; fight. I&#39;m sorry Kslawdogg and Roborick that my Autobots didnt reply, \n&gt; I wish I was able to, okay well here it goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Firedrill/Cliffjumper/Beachcomber/Megatron/Motormaster/Headstrong/\n&gt; Tantrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Firedrill looks to Firstaid who is rushing off, and dosent get a \n&gt; chance to have his sentence heard by the robot. &quot;Don&#39;t you recognize \n&gt; me?&quot; he asked, but it fell on deaf ears. He transformed, and race to \n&gt; follow him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beachcomber ran up to Cliffjumper who was shaking his head after \n&gt; being brought back on line and having his body repaired a \n&gt; bit. &quot;Thank&quot; he mentioned, both to his former leader Hotrod, and \n&gt; Halucigen for repairing him. He turned to Beachcomber &quot;It&#39;s Roddy, \n&gt; let&#39;s go help him&quot; and before Beachomber can reply Cliffjumper leaps \n&gt; forward, and fluidly shifts, transforming into his car mode, hitting \n&gt; the ground with his wheels burning to propelle himself, and he heads \n&gt; towards his former leader. Beachcomber transforms, and follows, but \n&gt; behind him, due to his lack of speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron Turned around noticing the situation, and his plan \n&gt; deteriorating, &quot;That&#39;s it, this fits into my plans terribly \n&gt; Astroblast, luckily I had planned for this turn of evets, take us \n&gt; down to earth&quot;. He said comanding his ship.

He landed as close as possible, trying to surround his \n&gt; enemy in a wall of Headstrong&#39;s, and then each one began to swing his \n&gt; sword in a wide arc towards Hotspot (only one will hit though as the \n&gt; other four are holograms, if it does hit that is)\n&gt; \n&gt; Tantrum flew up, and turned around noticing Abominus&#39; enemy. He fired \n&gt; two streams of lighting towards Element and fired his catalyst \n&gt; blaster at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
