He could still smell somethin=\r\ng familliar, and enemy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Whoever was in this area, is still here, I can=\r\n smell &#39;em. They&#39;re not too far off. Question is, who and what are we deali=\r\nng with?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nUproar and Leo II are both pacing and sniffing their sens=\r\nes on hyper alert. Who ever it is, there are skilled at keeping themselves =\r\nhidden and hiding their scent. But even with that there is the faint odor o=\r\nf Predacon or even Unicronian in the air, it is coming from down the hall i=\r\nn the direction from where they had come. \n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Elita lowered her e=\r\nars and said &quot;He almost caught me, dad... I&#39;m not so strong... He said that=\r\n he will come back for me... And I couldt stop him... What if he hurts mom =\r\ntrying to caught me... Lord Elder!!!!! He&#39;s Hurt, badly hurt.... Daddy!!!

It is time to have a few words wi=\r\nth him.=94 There was old confidence in Rodimus=92 voice again as he stood t=\r\nall and protective over his young daughter. =93Ramulus, go with them. I wan=\r\nt him captured!=94\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor tried to cut of the main lead, =\r\nstop the explosion and save the ark!!!!!!! Then He yellss in pain, what eve=\r\nr Tucson have done, it really hurted. but Overcoming the pain contined work=\r\ning and trying to insolate the Autobots and decepticons from the main mess.=\r\n\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs Perceptor worked Legacy also struggled to keep different system=\r\ns online, rerouting power from one system to the next. There were times whe=\r\nn they were successful, but there were also many other times wHere sparks f=\r\nlew because a system was either shorted out or the fluctuation tripped some=\r\n sort of breaker, causing cascading power failures. \n\n=93Interesting.=94 Le=\r\ngacy intoned as obviously like Perpector his acute senses were being simila=\r\nrly affected by Tuscon=92s barrage. =93The bridge seems largely unaffected =\r\nby Tuscon=92s barrage. It must because it has shielding in place.=94\n\n\nMEAN=\r\nWHILE OUTSIDE THE ARK:\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the ark, Tucson holds his posit=\r\nion and his wave. A look of sheer determination floods his face. He had not=\r\n answered Kup right away, but needed not to, as his body langauge fortells =\r\nthat of a determined Autobot, sworn to duty, and prepared to go as much dis=\r\ntance as needed. In the midsts of the wave, he picks up a blip. He detects =\r\nthe intruder inside, and with that wave, pinpoints his location. Yet, he wa=\r\nsn&#39;t about to tell anyone what he&#39;d be up to next. With transmission still =\r\nunderway, he approaches the ark calmly, with an alert stride to his walk. T=\r\nhe only one who would know what he&#39;d be up to, would be Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Legacy=\r\n, my sonar systems have picked up the intruder. I know of his location and =\r\nI&#39;m very sure I can keep up with him, if I continue to transmit. Can you gi=\r\nve me access into the Ark at this time?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n=93One moment.=94 Legacy r=\r\neplied over the radio to Tuscon, and then the front door to the Ark began t=\r\no slowly slide open. =93You should have complete access to the Ark, as does=\r\n everyone else.=94\n\nAs Tuscon moved forward though low energy reserve alarm=\r\n signals began to go off in Tuson=92s head. His wounds, his own energy loss=\r\n over his trip back finally beginning to catch up with him. While his wound=\r\ns were bound so he leaked no further energy, he had yet to get to a recharg=\r\ning chamber, and the tremendous amounts of energy that he was putting out t=\r\no maintain his wave was further depleting his already low energy reserves. =\r\n \n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Owww.. That wave is really hurting my relays.. Wait a se=\r\nc, my radars are picking up activity all over the place. We need ta amplify=\r\n that wave of yours.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson looks down to her.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m at full power =\r\nalready Straight Shot. Unless of course, Legacy can rig up an amplifier wit=\r\nhin the Ark to supplement my sonar attack.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I=\r\n&#39;ll ask. Legacy, this is Straight Shot, I&#39;m asking a favor on Tucsons behal=\r\nf. His waves are strong enough to pick up enemy forces in wide range, but h=\r\ne wants to take it up a notch and see if he can immobilize them at a furthe=\r\nr range. Kind of put them in a stall for now. Can you set up an amplifier s=\r\nignal to merge with Tucson&#39;s sonar system? It would be greatly appreciated.=\r\n&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nLegacy=92s cold voice can be heard over Tuscon=92s radio, =93Many=\r\n of the Ark=92s systems are also being affected by the wave you are transmi=\r\ntting. At the moment Perceptor and I are minimizing the damage by reallocat=\r\ning power from down systems to the few that are still running. I have no re=\r\nsources available to comply with your request.=94\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside the =\r\nArk, Night Shift catches something on his radar, and begins to pick up a li=\r\nttle speed, buzzing a bit ahead of Kup, like a hunting dog fixated on it&#39;s =\r\ntarget.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hello, I got somethn&#39;! IT&#39;S A PRED SIGNATURE! Ohhh yeah, we&#39;r=\r\ne not far from our targets Kup, I can feel &#39;em!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap too, senses t=\r\nhem.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s right! I got the pred signature and it&#39;s locked&#39;n loaded! Oh=\r\nhh Wheels was right! He was right! They&#39;re still here!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rat Trap gets a=\r\n hold of Rodimus and the others at the Ark.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is Rat Trap ta base! =\r\nYa won&#39;t believe it, but Wheels was right on the money this time! They&#39;re o=\r\nut here, and I bet they&#39;re around the other parameters too! Keep your senso=\r\nrs out for &#39;em, &#39;cause ya never know what those creeps are gonna be up to.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Back at the Ark, outside, Tucson holds for word, but with sonars at fu=\r\nll blast, he picks up activity happening all around the Ark. He narrows his=\r\n optics dangerously.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ohh, so that&#39;s it? Hide and seek... Been there, =\r\ndone that a million times. Signal&#39;s faint, but I know you&#39;re out there.&quot;\n\n\n=\r\nOOC: Keep in mind, it was ONLY the intruder inside the Ark who=92s stealth =\r\nshielding went down. Blackrazor has an active shield that was disrupted by =\r\nTuscon=92s wave. The Sweep=92s stealth is of a different sort and at the mo=\r\nment is unaffected by it. However that is water under the bridge with unfol=\r\nding events :)\n\nBIC: \n\nAs the Maximals creep forward in an attempt to locat=\r\ne the Predacons, Hydras chooses this moment to attack!!\n\n&gt; &quot;ATTACK THE MAXI=\r\nMALS!!!!!&quot;Hydras yelled &quot;dont touch the ark but ATTACK THE MAXIMALS!!!!&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n\nSix sweeps fly into the air, followed by their leader Scourge! As soon as=\r\n they leave the vicinity of Hydras, the Predacon leader looses the advantag=\r\ne of their stealth and immediately begins showing up on Maximal radar scree=\r\nns! However the sweeps still maintain their stealth, and only those who can=\r\n physically see them are aware of them. \n\nWith a viciousness all their own,=\r\n they begin to open fire on the Maximals!\n\nTuscon receives a call from Lega=\r\ncy, =93Tuscon, I am receiving readings of a single Predacon in your area, h=\r\nis IFF signal identifying him as Hydras.=94 Although there was a certain le=\r\nvel of urgency in his voice, Legacy was still calm and reserved as he made =\r\nhis tranmission.\n\n\n\nBack inside the Ark the intruder frowned as he realized=\r\n that his bomb had not gone off. With a whispered curse he continued to try=\r\n to adapt his stealth shielding to Tuscon=92s wave. With a worried look he =\r\nbegan to run down the hall, if he couldn=92t sneak out, he would BLAST his =\r\nway out!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0009_01CBE364.D3CA33F0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n\n/* start of attachment style */\n=\r\n       .ygrp-photo-title{\n         clear: both;\n         font-size: smaller=\r\n;\n         height: 15px;\n         overflow: hidden;\n         text-align: ce=\r\nnter;\n         width: 75px;\n       }\n       div.ygrp-photo{\n         backgr=\r\nound-position: center;\n         background-repeat: no-repeat;\n         back=\r\nground-color: white;\n         border: 1px solid black;\n         height: 62p=\r\nx;\n         width: 62px;\n       }\n\n       div.photo-title \n         a,\n    =\r\n     div.photo-title a:active,\n         div.photo-title a:hover,\n         d=\r\niv.photo-title a:visited {\n           text-decoration: none; \n       }\n\n   =\r\n    div.attach-table div.attach-row {\n         clear: both;\n       }\n\n     =\r\n  div.attach-table div.attach-row div {\n         float: left;\n         /* m=\r\nargin: 2px;*/\n       }\n\n       p {\n         clear: both;\n         padding: =\r\n15px 0 3px 0;\n\t overflow: hidden;\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file {\n        =\r\n width: 30px;\n         valign: middle;\n       }\n       div.attach-table div=\r\n.attach-row div div a {\n         text-decoration: none;\n       }\n\n       di=\r\nv.attach-table div.attach-row div div span {\n         font-weight: normal;\n=\r\n       }\n\n       div.ygrp-file-title {\n         font-weight: bold;\n       }=\r\n\n /* end of attachment style */\n        --&gt;\n        &lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=\r\n=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: A=\r\nrial;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\n  border: 1px =\r\nsolid #d8d8d8;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  fon=\r\nt-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n =\r\n margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p=\r\n {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: n=\r\none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-FAMILY: &#39;Calibri&#39;; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PErceptor/El=\r\nita/windlord/Hydras:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Perceptor continues worki=\r\nng trying to insolate the most important parts of \nthe ark and he said =93H=\r\nYDRAS IS A COMPLETE FOOOL!!!!...
