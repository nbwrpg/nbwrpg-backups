To make \n&gt;it\n&gt;fair the system also prevents Veratis from using energy weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt;Grizzltron was faster than Veratis had anticipated, the bot had avoided his\n&gt;grab and countered just as fast. The old scientist wasn&#39;t a slouch though\n&gt;and quickly recovered. Grizzltrons sword nearly connected but Veratis&#39; \n&gt;agile\n&gt;half bat form glided backward avoiding the slash. &quot;I give you one last\n&gt;chance to act in a civilized manner before I stop you.&quot; The scientist\n&gt;appalled violence in his home and wanted nothing more than common courtesy.\n&gt;&quot;So what&#39;ll it be? will you calm down or do I take you down?&quot; the old bot\n&gt;hovered inches from the ground prepared to fight if necessary, his beady \n&gt;bat\n&gt;eyes watched for movement while his snout constantly sent out sonar waves\n&gt;telling him where Grizzletron was at all times. his claws were held in \n&gt;front\n&gt;of him in a judo like stance, his wings beat softly keeping him aloft, his\n&gt;long half robotic legs hung below him slightly bent ready to push him\n&gt;whichever way he needed to go. He&#39;d been in to many fights in his long life\n&gt;to not know what he was doing and he intended to show the opponent that he\n&gt;meant business.\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: Proto [ &lt;beastwars@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Monday, July 09, 2001 8:37 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: old but still strong.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;�Grizzltron�\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Grizzltron was amazed by the strength of this older bot.
