Feline had kissed him, her purring adding onto \nit nicely, and then she had rubbed his chest, which was very pleasurable.  \nShe was definately not like any Maximal he had ever met.  Not that he was \ncomplaining.\n\nWith one hand, he gently lifted her head.  &quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; he said, kissing her, \nwishing that THIS moment would last forever.\n\n"}}
