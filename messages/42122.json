She got up muttering under \nher breath. She nodded to Galvatron and started scurrying over \ntowards the maximal signal.  She stayed close to the ground and stuck \nto the rocks.  Finally, she made her way on a ledge, just a few \nmeters away from the scene.  She saw a maximal with one gun and \nholding back two preds. Or what ever they were. She hadn&#39;d seend bots \nlike that before and wondered what they were. She transformed into \nbot mode, then drew her pistol with the stun charges and took \naime. &quot;Don&#39;t move&quot; she whispered.  Then pulled the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  God Neptune didnt appreciate the sarcasim. As the stopped about 20 \nfeet from \n&gt; the signal he lowered himself 5 feet from the ground and dropped \nher on her \n&gt; but. He landed and turned to Galvatron. &quot; I have a net we can use. \nWe just \n&gt; have to get her still in one place. I sense many bot signatures on \nthe other \n&gt; side of her. That may give us time.&quot; Galvatron thought about \nthis. &quot;That is \n&gt; not enough insurance. Dark Mouse could you put her down or at least \nslow her \n&gt; down enough for us to grab her?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
