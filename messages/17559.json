He smelled Spears scent again, it \nhad Prebons scent all over it, disgusting thought that such a good \nsparked Maximal would be forced to associate with such a slimy bot. \nHe thought about killing her, it might be a bkinder fate than letting \nher remember whatever sick exhibitions he&#39;d forced on her.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; How in the pit would Hot Rod have ANY codes whatsoever from the \nCybertronian \n&gt; Fire. He wasn&#39;t any high official, he didn&#39;t even spend that much \ntime in the \n&gt; bridge. And I don&#39;t remember Kluster, Firearm, Proto, Rex, \nGrimmler, or \n&gt; Chordate telling him any of the codes.\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Ramulus/Firearm/Proto/Smokescreen/Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramulus continues walking, thinking over Koj&#39;s suggestion. &quot;No,&quot; he \nreplies \n&gt; to the cloaked bot, &quot;We have a few air troops as it is, but we need \nthe \n&gt; ground troops.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks up as Prebon and Spears come into view, shouts from Spears \nfloating \n&gt; back to him. That didn&#39;t sound like Spears at all, not the Spears \nthat yelled \n&gt; at Unitron back when the Newcomers attacked the Ark... But where \nwas Striker?\n&gt; \n&gt; He frowns, slowly aproaching.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Firearm and Proto were flying high above Prebon and Spears, looking \ndown at \n&gt; them, their jetpacks not making a sound. Both of them could feel a \nbattle \n&gt; coming, they&#39;ve had enough military experience to know that they \nwern&#39;t \n&gt; getting Spears back so easilly.. But they couldn&#39;t see Striker \nanywhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; THe two bots frown, weapons ready.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Smokescreen stops, Prebon in clear view. He had his gun out, \nwaiting for \n&gt; something to happen.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Slayer&#39;s eyes narrow as he watches Ramulus get closer and closer, \nhis weapons \n&gt; tracking the Maximal. Soon, Ramulus would be in firing range...\n&gt; \n&gt; His eyes narrow as he sees Lunarpine next to Ramulus. What was that \nbot doing \n&gt; here? He glances at Prebon, wondering if his master had noticed.\n\n\n"}}
