He sent also some coordinates close to h=\r\nis base.\n&gt; \n&gt;      The ship banked only slightly in its flight path as it \n=\r\n&gt; acknowledged the signal and location.

More Tiny ...=\r\n More mechanical ... More ... something ... But \nit \n&gt; was near enough to M=\r\negatron&#39;s typical signature that the ship \nchanged \n&gt; course. \n&gt; \n&gt;      Th=\r\ne ship quickly neared it&#39;s goal, as it had already been \nmoving \n&gt; in that =\r\ndirection. As it neared what would typically be the \nextreme \n&gt; edge of rad=\r\nar range the ship shifted form to that of a rather \nlarge \n&gt; eagle with ebo=\r\nny and deep purple plumage, similar to that of the \n&gt; ship.
