Namely mind controll devices, probably chips?&quot;\n\nHe looks up as the two bots, Astrol and Fenox, fly up, sighing in both relief \nand annoyance. New troops were always welcome, but interruptions....\n\n&quot;Yes, a temporary truce will be good,&quot; he replies over his comm, &quot;We might \nneed some help soon. Are your troops willing to fight?&quot;\n\n"}}
