This Maximal is trying to assassinate me. \n&gt;Not\n&gt;every Maximal has a soft point like you think! If you fight me, you die,\n&gt;that is my warning. Back out now while you still can. Perplex!

Eventually I could even leave the planet, how would you know\n&gt;where I went?\n&gt;\n&gt;Burning Hammer: Because YOU hold the tracking device! Haha!\n&gt;\n&gt;Perplex realized that he must have caused this. A beeping sound is heard\n&gt;that makes him know Burning Hammer was telling the truth.\n&gt;\n&gt;Burning Hammer: Reprogrammed your stupid computer you stupidly put in\n&gt;yourself. Move it and it will self destruct.\n&gt;\n&gt;Perplex: This...this is my fault. I&#39;m leading him here.\n&gt;\n&gt;Burning Hammer: Old man did it for me.
