Sorry, Orchid and Minime.\n&gt;\n&gt; ::Ramulus/Shredder::\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramulus looks at the spark as Brix puts it into the pod, turning to the\n&gt; controlls. Pressing a few buttons, Ramulus activates the scanners, the pod\n&gt; begining its work.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now we wait,&quot; Ramulus says, stepping back.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Shredder nods, looking back at Mantella. They were pretty close to the\n&gt; Predacon cave, they&#39;d need to slow down. He looks up as he sees a bot fly\n&gt; overhead, carrying another bot. He turns back to Mantella.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I think this is around where the scanners start picking us up. We should\n&gt; slow down.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
