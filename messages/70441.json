It was the same tunnel that Perceptor, Tuscon abd\nthe other Maximals had taken during their escape.\n\nThe tunnel was much as they had seen it. The approximately 10 feet\nwide with a little variance here and there. As Hydras moves further\ninto the tunnels the light quickly disappears, the only light comming\nfrom whatever light Hydras or one of the others turns on. There walls\nare generally smooth, although there are a few marks along the walls\nas if something large and heavy had been through here recently. On the\nfloor are the tire prints of a large vehicle that had evidently\ntraveled down the path. From the size of the prints the vehicle was\nalmost as wide as the tunnel itself, leaving only a foot or two\nclearance on each side. That vehicle must have had an excellent\ndriver.\n\nAs Hydras traveled he got to one point where he can see the obvious\nsings of battle, and then he sees another, this one filled with far\nmore firepower than the first.\n\nFinally as Hydas continued his push foward, floowed still by Iguanus,\nInferno and Fractyl, he can see up ahead the signs of a fire fight.\nLights flash from up ahead, and the sounds of battle can be heard.\nCyclonus&#39; signal is clearly in the midst of it, as well as those of\nInsecticon and Bruticus-X. Also, in the battle with Cyclonus, Hydras\ncan pick up reading of some sort of strange almost alien type of\ncreature, and the odd thing is that the signature has bits of Autobot\nelements in it as well.\n\nSo far Deepstryke, Phobia and Nightrazor have not arrives as they are\nstill somewhat further back down the tunnel behind Hydras.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
