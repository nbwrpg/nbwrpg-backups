He picked random targets.\n\n    Gremlin watched the maps. He didnt understand what was going on. He knew \nthier was a secret mission in progress....but why were there holograms on the \nmap? It didnt make sense at all. \n    &quot;Hell Beast, what do you make of these holograms?&quot; Gremlin asked, turning \nto the Commander.\n    &quot;Interesting, &quot; he said, &quot;I dont know. Have one of the bots \ninvestigate.Im sure it has something to do with this mission....and begin to \ndecode this transmission from War to Killfest.&quot;\n\n    Putnam, Odiphious, and Venus see Akron n the midst of battle. The join \nher, armed and ready. &quot;Wheres the rat?&quot; Putnam asked. Akron shot at her \nseveral time, and the other Energonians too kthier spots and joined it.\n\n    Ominous looked at Quasar. In the Orb, they were alone. She should be \nwaking up at any moment...\n\n"}}
