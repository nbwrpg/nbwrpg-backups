Orchestra was \na\n&gt; stealthy covert ops agent, always uncovering even the most hidden\n&gt; information.  But Symphony had yet to find any skill in himself.  \nBut he had\n&gt; to prove he had some fighting strength!  He wouldn&#39;t let his \npeaceful ways\n&gt; get in the way of being accepted into a war faction.\n&gt; \n&gt;         &quot;Here I come!!!&quot; He yelled, running after Kluster into the \nbattle.\n&gt; \n&gt;          Symphony pulled out his machine gun and fired 22 shots at \nKluster&#39;s\n&gt; target, Reflector.\n\n\n"}}
