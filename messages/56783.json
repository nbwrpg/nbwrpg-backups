They all had a duty to \nperform & did it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Internally, she picked up a weak signal that was actually not too \nfar away. \n&gt; &quot;The group of crashed Decepticons are not that far. Once I have \nthem, we shall \n&gt; return immediately to base.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; After a moment&#39;s thought on the last couple words, she smiled & \ntried to \n&gt; contain her excitement. &quot;Until then?&quot; She purred as she smiled, \nher optics gazing \n&gt; off in the direction of the weak Decepticon signal.\n\n\n"}}
