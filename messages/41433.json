The two pods keep going down.  While going down, the DNA Scanners activate.  The first bot was a fuzor between a lobster and a sting ray.  The second bot also became a fuzor, of a shark and a seagull.  Just before the two pods hit the ocean floor, the two bots came came out from their pods.  They both transformed to beast mode, and surfaced.  The second bot, who had seagull wings, flew up from the ocean and was flying in the air.  The first bot came up too and swam to the shore of Alliance Island, and sat there.  The second bot followed.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Finally,&quot; the first bot shouted, &quot;We&#39;ve made it to planet Earth!  Let&#39;s find a good faction to join Anthrostite.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;Yes, I agree, Protostite,&quot; replied Anthrostite.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Anthrostite and Protostite figured that this base here&#39;s faction would be good to join.  Anthrostite tried to send a signal to get the Alliance&#39;s attention...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Abyssian By Birth~\n&gt; ~Badass By Choice~\n\n\n"}}
