I really enjoye=\r\nd the freedom here to create different\ncharacters, and run interesting idea=\r\ns and plots. I will miss that.\n\nI recognize that I have several plot lines =\r\nrunning. \n\nTo help close keep in mind the characters I played: Rodimus, Sco=\r\nrponok\nand Lord Elder belonged  to Robo. I had also promised him Cyc and\nSc=\r\nourge as well. So please consider them open for play, but return\nthem to hi=\r\nm when and if he should return. \n\nAs to who can lead the Maximals - I will =\r\nleave that up to you folks. \n\nAs to Cyc and Scourge - If you like just assu=\r\nme they leave the\nfortress. Remember they currenly have no leader right now=\r\n, and will\nonly follow a proven stong leader, most prefferably a unicronian=\r\n or a\nprevious unicronian minion (Like galvatron) . . . or perhaps a megs i=\r\nn\na pinch. \n\nAnyways, what you do is up to you, I leave them all in your ca=\r\npable\nhands.  \n\nSorry I have to go in such a fashion :( \n\nPreston\n\n\n"}}
