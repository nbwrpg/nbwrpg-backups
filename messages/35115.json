He thought that Maximal City was a very good idea, and it looked pretty well built from the outside, and from the inside so far. He sighs and looks at IR.\n\n-If it hadn&#39;t been built, we wouldn&#39;t have a base,- he says to her, and then looks over at Iris.\n\n&quot;And you&#39;d preffer that the CF was being taken in pieces to the Decepticon base right now? I&#39;m sure you saw the shields fall, twice,&quot; he says to the ex-computer program, wondering if there was any responce she could give in her defence.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron let go of Prowl, looking back at Iris as she walked in behind the \n&gt; couple.\n&gt; Iris looked around.*\n&gt; \n&gt; Iris: &quot; How disappointing.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron wished she could say the same, but she couldn&#39;t without hurting \n&gt; anyone&#39;s feelings.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Talk to Prowl, Mantle and Epyon, they&#39;re the ones that build it.
