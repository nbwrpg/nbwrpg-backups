If he wer=\r\ne to strike the first blow he knew he&#39;d be putting himself on the same leve=\r\nl as a Decepticon.  True he had hidden from Hydras and his merry men, and t=\r\nhat was not indicative of Optimus yet a little bit of originality of Tucson=\r\n, but, Tucson realized that this was serious and it had to be handled as su=\r\nch.  His all wheel drive systems quickly kick in to give him strength in hi=\r\ns legs, feet arms and hands.  And now he takes on the same defensive poses =\r\nas Optimus had taken when battling against Megatron.  It would almost seem =\r\nas if Optimus were really reincarnated in Tucson, yet that was not the case=\r\n.\nHe thinks to himself once again.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t have wanted to =\r\ndo this either Optimus, and I can see why that sometimes the hardest lesson=\r\ns are learned when you face an enemy upon who has been your comrade for man=\r\ny years.  But if this were you, I trust you would do the same.&quot;\n\nHe keeps h=\r\nis ears on his opponent, and his sensors at the ready.  The feeling inside =\r\nhim grows stronger and soon, he feels metallic plates shifting once again, =\r\nputting him in battle mode, with a shield over his face.  He had not ever e=\r\nxperienced the change into battle mode quite like this, which now has him a=\r\nppearing a lot like Optimus yet smaller in size.\n\n&quot; All right, have it your=\r\n way Rodimus.  This is going to hurt me more than it will hurt you.&quot;  \n\n---=\r\n In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; DarkHawk/Hydras/Perc=\r\neptor:\n&gt; \n&gt; Darkhawk Waitted impatient to set a blow, but he didnt liked to=\r\n interfere.

And for the first time, even though he could not see from his e=\r\nyes, it appears that he looks Rodimus in the eyes, as Optimus would have do=\r\nne with Megatron many years ago. His expression stoic, as was Optimus Prime=\r\n, and then out of nowhere he gives his reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It doesn&#39;t have to com=\r\ne to this, Rodimus, but you leave me with no choice. One shall rise, and on=\r\ne shall fall.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; His voice had always sounded like Optimus when he was =\r\nhis age. But now, at this moment, it sounded more and more like the legenda=\r\nry Autobot leader. Now something inside him was coming alive. A spirit that=\r\n he had kept deep down within him and now it was emerging. He did not cower=\r\n in shock at the thought of going toe to toe with Rodimus, although not thr=\r\nilled with the idea, as Optimus would have felt the same way, going against=\r\n one of his own, but he knew it had to be done. Perhaps it was the first st=\r\nep in hopefully recovering his lost leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s clear to me that yo=\r\nu have chosen the same path Megatron chose years ago. A path that lead to h=\r\nis demise. So, if this is the path you wish to take, then I fight you as an=\r\n enemy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His eyes do not narrow in rage, but take on a look of concent=\r\nration.
