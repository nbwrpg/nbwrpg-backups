She&#39;d been sitting in the CR chamber for she \ndidn&#39;t know how long.  She pounded on the door to no avail.  She began to \noverhear Burning Hammer&#39;s conversation with Nightlight and Zeni.  She needed \nto get out of the CR chamber.  She finally realized she had a second gun and \nshot a hole in the door large enough for her to reach out and open it.\n\n    She stepped into the room rather melodramatically.  &quot;Burning Hammer.  Why \ndo you lie to yourself?  Tell yourself that you must kill them because it&#39;s \nyour job.  Because they didn&#39;t trust you after you tried to kill them.  They \nare not gods.  They don&#39;t forgive instantly.  You must know that by now.  You \nare not a stupid bot.  I suspect that you liked it here.  You should also \nknow that they decided not to erase your memories because they wanted it to \nbe your choice to stay.  Don&#39;t you understand that they aren&#39;t like any other \nfaction in this war.  Fighting for members and imposing it on other bots.  If \nthey were I would&#39;ve stepped out shooting.  Actually I wouldn&#39;t have because \nI&#39;d now be reprogrammed but I wasn&#39;t.  Now can you give me one good reason \nthat you should do anything but thank and help these people?&quot;\n\n"}}
