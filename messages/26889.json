He didn&#39;t \nthink that they had gone too fast, but then again, he was male. Yet, \nhe thought that they had gone at good pace back then. Any couple that \nwas in love as much as him and Iron Raptor could pick their own pace. \nHeck, anyone could pick their pace.\n\nProwl slightly smiled again, remembering things that would not be \nappropriate to display in this post. But then he sighs. He saw little \npoint to going slow. In a war like this there was always a chance that \neither of them could end up dead the next day, and they would simply \nlose out on what they could have done. But if one of them died, so \nwould the other. That was how the Matrix had brought them back, and \nthat was why they could hear each other&#39;s thoughts. In alot of ways, \nthey shared their thoughts and feelings.\n\n-You don&#39;t think we should have done what we did back at the Ark?- He \nthought to her. It wasn&#39;t a regretful question, but a curious one. \nIron Raptor was entitled to her thoughts, but Prowl wanted to know why \nshe thought that they should go slow.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor continued to walk along with Prowl, still holding the \nsmall \n&gt; kitten to her chest.\n&gt; She cought the stray thoughts from Prowl about the time that they \nhad spent \n&gt; in her quarters, remembering it also but not thinking of it as such \na big \n&gt; deal.\n&gt; She felt a strain of regret as well just then.\n&gt; She actually wished that what had happened in that room would have \nnever \n&gt; happened at that time, that things had gone too fast and they were \njust \n&gt; acting on their sparks and not their brains.\n&gt; But it wasn&#39;t like anything too much really had happened, the battle \nhad \n&gt; called before they could really get into it.\n&gt; But now she had her mind in the right place and did regret letting \ntheir \n&gt; relationship go too fast, remembering now to go slower so that there \nwould \n&gt; be no more regrets.\n&gt; Besides, they haven&#39;t even had a first date yet.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed and looked down at the small kitten, not seeing \nProwl \n&gt; smile at her.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; I&#39;ll hear it later.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; *************************************************  ^..^\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iris looked over the battle fieled before turning and heading in \ntowards \n&gt; the CF, glancing up and seeing Prowl with Iron Raptor.\n&gt; It was hard to explain but she knew that those two weren&#39;t in for \nthe best \n&gt; of times and would be tested beyone imagination.\n&gt; Iris crossed her arms, her face hidden behind her helm.\n&gt; She hadn&#39;t been left active to just watch them, but she would let \nthem be \n&gt; for now.\n&gt; If only they knew....*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmai\n\n\n"}}
