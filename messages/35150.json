And don&#39;t worry bout the \nlockdown because i have loaded all systems into my own cerebrum chips \nso i can override it as well. And sahll i have to change the codes so \nthe others can too then so be it. You still haven&#39;t explained to me \nhow your codes will work through my carbon shield.  Yes so it \nhtought. And about being assigned to wepons i had no idea, I saw the \nshields being down and nobody doing anything about it so i put them \nup.  So if you want to control shields so be it, i will control the \nweapons.  But before you go sulk away let me transfer my codes so you \ncan work with the vines shield.

The shields were repaired before you \never began \n&gt; work on them.  You were assigned to work on the weapons which, I \nmight add, \n&gt; you never did.  As for my codes not working, I copied your program \nwith only \n&gt; one addition.  I made only three codes with the new addition \nbecause it is \n&gt; for those who were here before I arrived.  And yes I made myself a \ncode, I \n&gt; left out the new addition however.  This addition provides for an \noverride in \n&gt; case of a lockdown of the ship.  This way only those with the code \nmay travel \n&gt; freely during a lockdown and they may begin or end a shutdown.&quot;  He \nbegins to \n&gt; think to himself about the currant situation.  &quot;Your engineering \nskills are \n&gt; impressive and your ego is enormous.&quot;  He turns to the computer and \nwith a \n&gt; few quick strokes erases the new program with no way to retrieve it \nexcept \n&gt; for the copy in his own memory.  &quot;You are obviously more useful \nhere.&quot;  He \n&gt; manages to get that out with only the slightest hint of sarcasm in \nhis voice. \n&gt;  &quot;I&#39;m sure I can find another computer to fiddle with, in a quieter \nplace so \n&gt; that I can think at the same time.&quot;  He stalks off to a storage \nlocker to \n&gt; pick up a few things.\n\n\n"}}
