Necromancer wondered if Iron Raptor was still the leader, and\n&gt; what changes had gone by.  It seemed like much time had passed, but\n&gt; if he knew how much time had really passed, he wouldn&#39;t be in so much\n&gt; wonder.  He decided to send a message to Iron Raptor through his comm-\n&gt; link.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Iron Raptor, this is Necromancer, I&#39;ve returned, and Hell\n&gt; Drak is with me,&quot; Necromancer said.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
