Despite all that the CR was trying to do it just wasn&#39;t enough to repair his body fully, all of the internal damage remained while the external was healed. Try as it might the chamber wasn&#39;t used to repairing Transmetal 2 circuitry and failed in the attempt, sadly there was nothing that it could do.\nDinobot stood there inside of the chamber, barely conscious but enough to know that unless he was fully healed his time on this planet was limited.\nHe slowly opened his optics but viewed nothing but static, his breathing was shallow and raspy.\nHis body was slowly failing him...his spark growing dim, was he was to die...again?\nThe sound of his spark echoed in his systems, it&#39;s beats becoming further and further apart from the next until they were so few then he knew that death was there...only waiting until the final beat sounded.\nDinobot knew that he HAD to hold on, had to keep himself alive...if not for his sake then...Tavatrons.\nHis spark sounded...1....2.....3......4.........!\nSilence.\nNot a sound was heard, not a system fluttered...darkness.\nThere was nothing but darkness, silence, and the constant pain of loneliness. Yes, he knew this feeling...all to well. It was what accompanied...death.\nIt was a familiar feeling to dwell in constant darkness, something that he knew but now hated!\nWhy must he die again, why must he be separated from a world of battle and fighting for what was right. Why?!\nAgain plunged into loneliness and despair, he would not, could not just let it happen again!\nThe events of both his past and new life seemed to flash before him, the beginning of the Beast Wars, the Maximals, confrontations with Megatron, the alien encounters, the vallie...his demise, the journey towards the Maxtrix, the far off calling of battle, the return, the first battle, meeting Tavatron, the practice battle, Predacon attack,....it was all there!\nHe knew the darkness was just the first stage before the spark left the body, but while it was still centered within his spark-cavity the blackness would last.\nIf he would have had a voice he would have roared, if he would have had a fist he would have struck out, NOT AGAIN!!!\nBut suddenly he wasn&#39;t alone...there was not just darkness about him, there was a jumble of feelings present. Fear, sorrow, concern...all felt towards him along with a small power that seemed to grow in intensity about him. The fear grew, the sorrow grew, and the concern grew until it swamped his senses completely. It was almost as if the were feeding themselves into his systems, but then soon they seemed to merge together into a faint green glow. Soon even that began to grow in size and intensity and strength until he was surrounded in a green light. \nSoon there was a sound as if somebot beating a drum, it began slowly but then began to beat quicker and steadily. But as the rhythm became more loud and steady the feelings soon began to fade away and just leave the glow like some reminder that they had once been there. Hi senses reached out to the feelings and the comfort they gave together as they retreated but then his senses were suddenly pulled away in a sudden and fierce force. The sudden realization that he was being pulled away from the comforting feeling caused him to panic and caused him to...roar.\nRoar?\nA gasped escaped his lips as he optics flew open and closed his mouth, the sound of a gut-wrenching roar fading away into silence after echoing off of the inside of the chamber.\nHe blinked a few times but then gathered himself, he was alive!\nDinobot looked at the door of the CR chamber in front of him, a green glow reflected off of it.\nA green glow?!\nHe looked down at his chest and saw his spark-cavity illuminated with the energy of his repair system. Soon the glow died away to leave a greyness about his form, but where had the system gotten the energy to repair himself?\nA sudden flicker of the merged feelings caught his attention and he looked to the left wall of the chamber where it had seemed to come from, something was on the other side...something that felt like it had felt that fear, sorrow and concern that had merged and created a power...that was enough to reactivate his repair system. But was it just a dream, was it just an illusion on which he had experienced from loosing to much mech fluid? That question was one of life&#39;s mysteries in which may never be answered...for now.\nLight flooded the CR chamber as it opened, Dinobot squinted and shielded his optics with his hand.\nA world awaited for him, beyond.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
