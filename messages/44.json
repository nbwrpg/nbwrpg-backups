He kept a watchful\n&gt;optic, he hoped for a real fight but a practice battle was good enough for\n&gt;now. Besides, he wanted to test Tavatron&#39;s power and battle knowledge.\n&gt;It was almost midnight but they could both see well in the dark, the moon\n&gt;shawn it&#39;s reflection in a small pond at the bottom of the valley. Yet\n&gt;another challenge.\n&gt;Dinobot hade to admit though, Tavatron had a good optic for terrain that\n&gt;challenged her abilities of a warrior.*\n&gt;\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
