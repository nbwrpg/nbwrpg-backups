Her tail twitched wildly and her optics \nflashed wildly in various colors.  She twitched and sputtered a bit. \nAfter a few seconds, her body returned to normal. With a little mech \nfluid leaking from her nose and ears, she grinned. &quot;Ah, finally. \nsomething with a kick.&quot;  She looked at her empty glass. &quot;Got another \none?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
