Sorry it took so long, a good bit to\nmake sure of. Oh well ...\n\nBIC:\n\n--- khamkain &lt;khamkain@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Remus was silent. He was figthing against is own will to not figth\n&gt; back. The situation was desastrous, but he had to survived. He waited\n&gt; the end of Cyclonus&#39;s show to get to jotunn and Lord Elder.\n\nCyclonus continued to bath the forms in energy as they shifted and were\ntransformed by the now corrupted matrix! Then as soon as quickly energy\nstarted it stopped and the five forms lay before him. \n\nTwo by two, five pair of optics fluttered and then lit as life once\nagain invigorated their once apparently dead circuits. They sat up and\nnimbly climbed to their feet. \n\n�Greetings soldiers of Unicron!� Cyclonus� voice was rich and powerful\nas he regarded his progeny. �You have awakened to a new world, a new\nuniverse. I am Cyclonus, herald of Unicron, Introduce yourselves!�\n\nThe first to step forward was massive with weapons fairly ripping from\nhis body. His most prominent features being the crimson cylinders of\narm cannons that extended from massive red armored shoulders down past\nhis elbows. While there are touches of red at his fore arms, hips and\nfeet, the rest of his large form is dominated by gunmetal gray, with\nonly highlights of yellow at his chest and face.  �I am DEEPSTRYKE� he\nsays, the deep bass of his voice reverberating across the area.\n�Superior firepower wins battles, superior intellect wins wars.�\n\nThe next to step forward was a female, tall and slender, she radiated a\ncold power and confidence. She like Deepstryke was predominantly red,\nespecially across her torso, chest, hips and feet, but most of the rest\nof her was covered in an ebony black armor. Her face is framed by four\nfin-like projections sweeping back behind her head like some mask, and\nyet the look of her face is almost achingly beautiful to behold.  �I am\nPHOBIA.� She smiled as she took her place behind the first. �Your\ngreatest fear is my greatest vice.�\n\nThe third to step forward is a truly dark soldier, colored in deep\npurple and black, his optics are almost furtive as he surveys the area.\nThe twin boosters positioned above his shoulders, the nosecone on his\nchest as well as the wings that sprout from behind his shoulders and\ncalves hint at his aerial alt-mode. He moved to stand to the other side\nof Deepstryke. �I am NIGHTRAZOR.� His voice was quiet, understated and\ncalm as his optics focused on Cyclonus. �Don�t fear what you cannot\nsee, fear what do not expect.�\n\nThe next to step forward is another female robot, perhaps as tall as\nPhobia but not quite as smooth. She is wide shouldered and slim of hip,\nher armor is nearly all gunmetal gray, save for the items that betray\nher alt-mode. Large intake engines on her back, her face and a nosecone\nlike assembly on her chest all display her aerial mode. At the top of\nher intake jet though open to display rather large speaker-like\nassemblies and the sound of her voice seemed to boom as much from them\nas from her mouth. �I am DECIBEL.� Her voice is powerful as it echoes\nover the landscape. She quirked a small smile as her voice while\nassuming a more reasonable volume was still powerful nonetheless, �The\nsound of my music is death in your ears!�\n\nThe last of the quintuplets to step forward was something like\nDeepstryke. While not as tall, he was thick and well armored. The large\nintake jets that made up his chest were a deep blue as well as the\ncranial guard of is helm, parts of his fore arms, his hips, his lower\nlegs and his feet. On his shoulder a large silver/gray cannon is\nmounted and in his left hand is an equally vicious looking rifle. His\nsteps are heavy and powerful as he took up his place behind the rest.\n�I am TUMULT!� His voice was that of a soldier, zealous and eager, \n�The greater the fight, the more glorious the Victory!�\n\nAs the five complete their introductions they unison drop to one knee,\n�We are yours to command Lord Cyclonus.�\n\nCyclonus, who had been smiling up to this time frowned, �You are\nwarriors of UNICRON! Never forget that.� \n\n�Whatever you command Lord Cyclonus.� They spoke once again in unison. \n\n\nCyclonus continued to frown, unsure if his point was taken.\n\nCyclonus turned to look at Remus, �Through the defeat of your leader\nyou have been granted a stay of execution, that stay is at an end -\nfollow us no longer.� Cyclonus glanced skywards, obviously about to\ntake off. He looked back at Remus, �But know this, without Rodimus\nPrime you cannot stand against us. If your leaders choose to surrender\nwe may consider it. Otherwise when next we meet it will be as bringers\nof your destruction.� \n\nCyclonus smiled slightly, �Until we meet again maximal.�\n\nOOC: If Remus remains silent than all will move skyward and quickly\ndisappear. \n\nPreston\n(Da�minion)\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
