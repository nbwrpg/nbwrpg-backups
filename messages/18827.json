The maximal base is \ntotally gone?&quot;  She looked at her hands and then looked up at \nDestructor.  &quot;But we are still here? Is it possable that if the ark \nif rebuild, that will save history? Or is it possable that the ark \nisn&#39;t as important as we originally thought.&quot;  She thought about the \ndeal. Perhaps this might work out yet.  She talks to Aracnia, \nstarting the Predacon counsil here on earth. Now that the maximals \nare without a base, they are vulnerable. But, the alience is a \nproblem. Or are they. They had helped her in the past. Then a strange \nidea came across her mind.  If she helped the maximals, and still \nkept her stings with Aracnia and add the allience to the council,  \nthen she could very easily have the maximals pay back the fave and \nuse the council ties to get rid of Megatron.  Then, once that is \ndone, she would use the council to get rid of the maximals and have \nthe ark under predacon rule.  Safe and sound, but no maximals.  She \nsmiled and looked at Destructor.  &quot;Right now, I am not worried about \nthe allience.  What worries me is Megatron. But if the ark is needed \nto keep our history going, then.....&quot; she looked down. She really \ndidn&#39;t want to give this order, it went against every predacon \nprogram she had in her body. &quot;You may take DarkMouse, your troops to \nhelp out.  You may take whom you need for this mission. But we must \nhave enough bots here to defend the base.  Autoguns aren&#39;t always \nreliable.&quot;  She walked up to Destructor and whispered into his ear,&quot; \nYou had better be right about this. I&#39;m going on your word on this. I \ndon&#39;t beleive in helping the maximals. but if you feel this strongly \nabout it, I shall go along with it. But if you put your troops in \ndanger needlessly, put this base or anyone on it&#39;s crew in danger, \nyou will answer to me.  I will not risk my troops.  Not on a whim. \nI...I have to much respect for my crew...and you, to lose you all on \nsome maximals who can&#39;t defend thier own base. But we won&#39;t do this \nfor nothing.  If we help, then they will help us to seek out and \ndestroy Megarton.  If we are to help, then they will follow that part \nof the bargin.&quot;  she put her hand on his shoulder and looked at his \nface, looking for a responce and understanding.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;   &quot;I have been contacted by my allies. The ark has been destroyed. \nWe have \n&gt; not been destroyed but i dont know how. All I know is it must be \nrebuilt. My \n&gt; destron friend Sphink has already contacted you. His destron forces \nhave \n&gt; already agreeded to help the maximals rebuild the ark. I fwe do so \nwe will \n&gt; save history and help us win over the maximals favor. I know you do \nnot like \n&gt; the maximals but if we are to take down the alliance we will need \nthe \n&gt; maximals. Now we will also need the help of your troops to rebuild \nthe ark. \n&gt; My spy..is Ultra Magnus. The former comander of the autobots. And \nhe is ready \n&gt; to go under your command.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
