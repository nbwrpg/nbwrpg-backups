The shuttle looks something like a Bident but instead of \ntw=\r\no\n&gt; &gt;pokers it has two lightning bolts.  It is a metallic silver/white\n&gt; &gt;c=\r\nolor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      But enough of the space shuttle, inside the unique space=\r\nship\n&gt; &gt;were two individuals.  They were both silver metallic.  Over their\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;metallic though was more metallic but this is where the two\n&gt; &gt;individua=\r\nls looked different.  One was a shinny red metallic and \nthe\n&gt; &gt;other was a=\r\n shinny blue metallic.  So for now they shall be known \nas\n&gt; &gt;Red and Blue.=\r\n  Red was studying a map of the world known as Earth.\n&gt; &gt;Blue was sitting i=\r\nn the pilot&#39;s chair but instead of carefully\n&gt; &gt;planning the course he had =\r\nhis legs up on the controls and was\n&gt; &gt;twiddinling his thumbs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n &quot;Hey Brother,&quot; Red said as he turned and faced his\n&gt; &gt;comrade, &quot;What the G=\r\nrease Bolting are you doing!  Why aren&#39;t you\n&gt; &gt;planning our landing!  I do=\r\nn&#39;t want to crash.  Plan ahead.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;Plan Ahead?  Yeah right!&quot;  =\r\nBlue said as he let out a small\n&gt; &gt;chuckle, &quot;You are suppose to move with t=\r\nhe flow.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;We need a landing vector!&quot;  Red yells.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n   &quot;YOU NEED a tic-tack!&quot;  Blue yells back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Poor Poor Blue, i=\r\nf only he listen to his brother.  But he\n&gt; &gt;decided to not listen to his br=\r\nother and decided to go with the\n&gt; &gt;flow.  Well now they are flowing on the=\r\n mountains of the Northern\n&gt; &gt;Continent where they crashed.  Their exact lo=\r\ncation of the crash is\n&gt; &gt;(using the map on the events page) as far east of=\r\n the Predacon base\n&gt; &gt;as possible and about an inch up.  It looks like thes=\r\ne two bots \nneed\n&gt; &gt;a rescue operation. (Hint:  I just making the rescue op=\r\neration to \nsee\n&gt; &gt;which groups are active and that is how I am going to de=\r\ncide who to\n&gt; &gt;join to rescue me.)  (So Bots, move out.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______=\r\n___________________________________________________________\n&gt; Charla con tu=\r\ns amigos en l=EDnea mediante MSN Messenger:  \n&gt; http://messenger.microsoft.=\r\ncom/es\n\n\n"}}
