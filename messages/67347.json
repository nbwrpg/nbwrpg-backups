He readied his pulse cannon, his\n&gt; missile launcher and his sword. This would be a day they&#39;d wish had\n&gt; never come!\n\nFrom the distance three shadows seem to almost materialize in the\ndistance as cold laughter echoes back at Azureblade. &quot;You do not belong\nhere Predacon.&quot; \n\nThe shadows as they approach take on distinct forms: A trio of black\nshapes looking like both beast and machine with large outswept wings as\nif to catch an air that all knows doesn&#39;t exist here on the moon. Long\nserpentine necks end in large and elongated reptillian heads with jaws\nfilled with rows of teeth. Optics blaze as boosters mounted on thier\nbacks flare. Long whiplike tails complete the picture, swishing behind\nthem as they agiliy push through the faint atmosphere of the moon.\n\n&quot;And the only thing you will reap here is your own DEATH!&quot;\n\nThey continue to approach, as what could only be cannons glow and rip\ninto the area Azureblade stands!\n\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)  \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
