As he look down towards the new person about \nto fight him and Daydream he smiled and thought. If I could take both \nof them out I wonder.... his thoughts went on in this form. He \nshouted out loud &quot;Ahahahha fools, ahahaha&quot; he laughed with \nvengence. &quot;Now it is time to meet your makers. As he said this his \nwings faned back suddenly. The sun bright in the distance was covered \nup with his wide outspread. below them a huge shadow fell where his \nopponents were standing. Auron holds out his hands to both sides of \nhis body. He begins to quiver as little slits in his wings begin to \nopen up. As you look up Aurons eyes begin glowering red and his body \nseems to shimmer in the morning daylight. &quot;Yes are you ready now&quot; as \nhe says this his sensors lock on his foes below. As his arms come \ntogether, he smiles a crazy demented smile. &quot;Lock&quot; he says as his \nhordes of missles come out of his wings are in fiering postion. As \nthey come out it seems he has volleys and volleys of them \nstored. &quot;Are you ready now&quot; he asked once more as the first volley \ncame down, 20 missles locked on Daydreamer and his new opponent went \nstreaming toward them.\n\nOOC:This is like a move I just made up but when I use it my amo kinda \nruns out quickly\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; ooc:yes i posted her going there.\n&gt; Night Prowler:very well daydreamer ill help you.\n\n\n"}}
