Its optics flickered on. This was no\n&gt; &gt; longer the body of RebelYell. It now belonged to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; revived Maximal Sideswipe. Sideswipe shook his\n&gt; head\n&gt; &gt; from side to side, trying to throw off his feeling\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; grogginess.He looked down at his sleek new black\n&gt; body.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;By the Matrix!&quot; he said softly.&quot;What happened to\n&gt; me?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The last thing he knew he was being blasted by\n&gt; &gt; Megastorm. Now he found himself in a body that was\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; his own.Just then he noticed the sound of weapons\n&gt; &gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; He looked up. He recognized that ship. It was the\n&gt; Ark,\n&gt; &gt; and it was under heavy attack. He picked up the\n&gt; chain\n&gt; &gt; gun and laser rifle that were still lying on the\n&gt; &gt; ground and rushed off to join the battle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with\n&gt; Yahoo!
