If necessary we can even trust the\n&gt; council to post damage since we&#39;re obviously Biased.\n&gt;\n&gt; We can work out the details if everyone agrees to these terms.\n&gt;\n&gt; Majority rules, anyone against this match taking place would be\n&gt; excluded from judgement.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, KSLawdogg@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (STOP with the useless OOC e-mails!
