I&#39;m assuming you came here in the interests of peace.&quot;\n\nAs he talks, his comm replies to Composer, unheard to Orchestra (unless he intercepts it, I guess). &quot;Yes. Please report to my position. I&#39;m in a meeting, but you can sit through it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Abyssian Badass&quot; &lt;1641coburn@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Orchestra/Composer::\n&gt; \n&gt;     Orchestra sat himself down.
