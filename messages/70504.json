He had always been the strategic type, and as if plannin=\r\ng his next move in a game of chess, he narrows his brow and not one word co=\r\nmes out of his mouth, except...\n\n&quot;Not on my watch.&quot;  \n\nWhich was also what =\r\nhe had said in his sub conscious.  \n\nAs Night Shift, Rat Trap and Straight =\r\nShot watch, they look to Kup and nodd, yet, what comes out of Tucson&#39;s mout=\r\nh causes them to turn on a heel.   Straight Shot sees the determination in =\r\nhis face.  A determination he had when he first faced Hydras before he beca=\r\nme a Prime.\n\n&quot; Ohhh I think whoever has Rodimus Prime under their control i=\r\ns gonna have their tendrils full with Tucson.  That&#39;s it Tucson, you can do=\r\n it, you got your name for a reason.&quot;\n\nRat Trap watches carefully.\n\n&quot; If an=\r\nyone get get Rodimus outa that jam it&#39;s Wheels.  He didn&#39;t let Hydras stop =\r\n&#39;em and now he ain&#39;t gonna let any oversized bug stop &#39;em either.&quot;\n\nNight S=\r\nhift follows Straight Shot and Talon.\n\n&quot; Talon, you can bet your spark that=\r\n Tucson Prime&#39;s gonna come outa this with Rodimus just fine.  Tucson got hi=\r\ns name for a reason, like Straight Shot said, every mech gets his or her na=\r\nme depending on his spark, and lemme tell ya Tucson&#39;s got one heck of a spa=\r\nrk, and a back bone. Okay, let&#39;s get ta the CR chamber&#39;n get Nightlight&#39;n W=\r\nindlord back online where they belong.&quot;\n\nAs Straight Shot follows Night Shi=\r\nft, Rat Trap stays with the others, including Quickstride, Silverbolt, Noct=\r\noro, Ramhorn, and Bump, carefully watching his newly found friend&#39;s every m=\r\nove.  There was a power there, a power that even Tucson himself couldn&#39;t ex=\r\nplain.  Again, another indication of strength, as Tucson begins to grip his=\r\n fist tightly with a narrowing brow.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly=\r\n2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kup/nightlight/Windlord:\n&gt; \n&gt; Kup reicved the signal o=\r\nf the cr and said &quot;Nightlight and Windlord has been \n&gt; repaired...
