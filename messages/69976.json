I - was=\r\n just on my way to Nightstrike when I ran a little low on fuel, so I was gi=\r\nven something here and it had a few side effects...  Look, I&#39;m a little tie=\r\nd up right now, I&#39;ll definitely get back to you when I have more time.  Tuc=\r\nson Prime out.&quot;\n\nThis time he manages to disengage the com link.\n\n&quot;Ohh boy,=\r\n I sure hope he bought that one.  It&#39;s not like me to lie but some things a=\r\nre best kept to ourselves. And this time, I remember where I left off.&quot;\n\nHe=\r\n had not realized it but Tucson was capable of many emotions, love being on=\r\ne of them.\n\nOutside the storage area, Rat Trap tries to cover for Tucson an=\r\nd looks over to the area while scratching behind his head.\n\n&quot;Hmm, Wheels we=\r\nnt inta the storage bay.  He could&#39;ve had ta replace a tire or two and is h=\r\navn&#39; a hard time lookn&#39; for tires that fit his specs.
