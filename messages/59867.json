I think a\nmore conditional rule needs to be imposed. That is\nathat all players in the vicinity of a scene must be\ngiven upto 24 hours to reply to any post. This kills\noff two birds with one stone- firstly it stops flood\nposting and second it forces people to post every day.\n\n --- Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@...&gt; wrote: &gt; Nic,\nI got an Ideal for the posting, How about\n&gt; limiting it to like five post a day. I mean that\n&gt; might be better. I mean I am soo Confused with the\n&gt; ammount of post. I have SBC Yahoo DSL and I got in\n&gt; the matter of five minutes like 12 mails from the\n&gt; same source. Man it&#39;s gotta stop. I have schoool and\n&gt; work . It takes up most of my time right now and\n&gt; when I check out my post then I got like 40+ post in\n&gt; my inbox. And it like blows. I am bout ready to walk\n&gt; away from this game.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nic, I think the flood posting thing has gotten\n&gt; beyond\n&gt; the point of discussion, with the current modding\n&gt; going on (at the risk of pointing fingers, airly and\n&gt; shadowess agoth are by far the worst offenders at\n&gt; this), how the heck am I meant to get a fair chance\n&gt; to\n&gt; reply to posts. I think you need to set a ruling in\n&gt; stone on this because it&#39;s clear that discussion is\n&gt; pointless with the nothing coming of it. I think a\n&gt; rule needs to be set that if a player is not given a\n&gt; fair chance to reply, then any posts beyond the\n&gt; point\n&gt; of a realistic reply (as in anything that would\n&gt; exceed\n&gt; time periods where characters reply if the situation\n&gt; were real) be declared VOID. Because I currently\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; see how I can continue in this RPG when I&#39;m not\n&gt; given\n&gt; a fair chance to reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
