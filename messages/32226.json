He looked back, just in time \nto see Diana wailing for him to stop before turning to face te monster. He \nwasn&#39;t about to abandon her. Nuh-uh.\n\n&quot;Hang on! I&#39;m coming!&quot;\n\nRion pulled to the side as he did a quick u-turn in mid-air and flew at top \nspeed to Diana&#39;s side. He landed beside her, skidding to a stop just inches \nbefore the monster.\n\n&quot;Yikes!&quot;\n\nRion jumped back. That was a little &#39;too&#39; close for comfort. He drew his \nsword and gulped loudly. His knees were shaking but he wasn&#39;t about to leave \nDiana alone with this thing.\n\n*****\n\nHysteria had made her way through the ship, repairing what little damage she \ncould. Most of it was either not worth the effort or out of her limited \nreach. She was of something at a loss when it came to high places. Still, \nshe did her best.\n\n(I&#39;m not exactly sure what&#39;s going on with the CF right now, so I&#39;ll keep \nthings concerning it a little vague for now.)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
