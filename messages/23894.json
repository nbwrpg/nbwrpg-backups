LOL I got a bit mixed up \nwith spelling)\n\nDiablo watched the battle for a few more minutes, and then snickered \nquietly as he saw a bot (Angel Prime) kiss a female that was \nobviously in trouble (Teltoli). At first he thought that there was \nsomething going on, but his sharp eyes picked out the fact that the \nfemale&#39;s wounds had vanished.\n\nHis main eyes narrowed, while his stalk eyes continued to scan the \nfield. If he was to join the attackers, he&#39;d have to start by getting \nrid of this bot that healed others. Not really needing to revert to \nBot mode, Diablo took a step forward, still hidden by the stealthing \ntechnology. With careful aim he flung out his long tail in a whipping \nmotion, and the poisoned scythe blade on the end spun towards Angel \nPrime.\n\nHe knew it would hit, as it too was cloaked, and it even poisoned the \nair around it, so any way he would still get infected. It was \nsomething of a virus, you never knew it was there until it actually \nknocked you senseless.\n\nAnother scythe began to grow back on his tail, as he watched his \nscythe fly into the battlefield.\n\n\n===============\n\nProfile...\n\nName: Diablo\n\nGender: Male\n\nBeast Mode Characteristics: His body is like one of a cenataur, yet \nslightly different. He had horse legs and body, but where the horse \nchest would be is a slightly human torso, with strong looking arms \nand chest. His face has no mouth, just a nose, pointed ears, and two \nblack almond eyes. Atop his head sit two stalk eyes which could twist \nin any direction. His whole body is covered in black fur. Where the \nhorse tail would be, is a 2 meters long tail, with a scythe like \nblade, wickedly sharp and coated with poison, on the end. He can \nfling these at enemies, and another one will grow instantly, and he \ncan also use it like a blade. \n\nRobot Mode Characteristics: In Bot Mode, Diabo is a mix of Dark Blue \nand Midnight Black. He legs are strong, and sturdy, supporting a \nspike at the knee which can be driven into opponents. His chest is \nplain, rippled with muscles, leading to his arms which at the elbows \nhave another two spikes. His face pretty much remains the same, \nexcept for the fact the fur gives way to dark blue metal and the \nstalk eyes vanish.\n\nPersonality: Diabo is, what you could say, Tainted with Evil. He&#39;s \nnever done one good deed in his life, and never intends to. He uses \npoison alot, and heavy firepower. He never shows any emotion, and it \nis said that he can outwait a stone.\n\nWeapons: His blade turns into a scythe weapon, still with poison. \nBlack Optic lasers than if hit, knock the bot out for three hours.\n\n\n"}}
