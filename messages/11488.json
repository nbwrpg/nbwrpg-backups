She relaxed and\n&gt; smiled,&quot;Geez, you \n&gt; startled me.&quot;  She chuckled, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; &quot;OK, so what&#39;s on your mind? You looked like you\n&gt; were taking a trip \n&gt; back to Cybertron.&quot; She said with half a chuckle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spears::\n&gt; &quot;yeah, but not in this pile of rusted bolts. This\n&gt; ship is so damaged, \n&gt; it wouldn&#39;tfly again even if we replaced everything\n&gt; onboard down to \n&gt; the paper clips in the captain&#39;s desk. The ark is\n&gt; grounded for good. \n&gt; And all we can do is sit here and repair parts of it\n&gt; just enough to \n&gt; survive another pred attack.&quot; She gave a deep sigh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadow Wing::\n&gt; She put a comforting hand on Spears shoulder. \n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, \n&gt; everything will work out.  You&#39;ll see.&quot; She smiled\n&gt; at Spears and \n&gt; walked down the ramp.  She had another welding torch\n&gt; with her.  She \n&gt; walked up to Lunarpine, &quot;Hello beloved.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
