She looks around quic=\r\nkly and realizes the terrain was full of trees that may be damaged but were=\r\n still stable enough to  hold her weight.  She jumps up to catch a hanging =\r\nbranch and like a skilled acrobat, she manages to swing herself up higher i=\r\nnto the trees.  From there, she could see a large branch severely cracked, =\r\nhanging right over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.     She then spots a large tree roo=\r\nt at the edge of what looked like a tar pool.  How convenient was that?  An=\r\nd she certainly was fast enough to dart out of the way if she had to.  But =\r\nif she could only break that branch without falling out of the tree herself=\r\n. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda predictable..  So wh=\r\ny not try something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; She exami=\r\nnes the crack in the branch.  She finds that with just a strong hit with a =\r\nsharp object, the branch would definitely come down. She raises a brow, aim=\r\ns her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the branch.  She hits her targ=\r\net as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from the damaged tree with a lo=\r\nud creaking noise.  She hoped her first plan of attack would work.  Phase t=\r\nwo would also prove difficult as she waits to see how the chips fall, liter=\r\nally.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot; Timber..&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson quickly catches Noctorro as=\r\n he puts his body beneath his to support him.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot; Easy I got you.

She \nraises a brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the cr=\r\nack in the branch.&nbsp; \nShe hits her target as the branch cracks loudly a=\r\nnd detaches from the damaged \ntree with a loud creaking noise.&nbsp; She ho=\r\nped her first plan of attack would \nwork.&nbsp; Phase two would also prove =\r\ndifficult as she waits to see how the \nchips fall, literally. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot; Timber..&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, Tucson=\r\n quickly catches Noctorro as he puts his body beneath his \nto support him.&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot; Easy I got you.&nbsp; Seekers?&nbsp; But how=\r\n?
