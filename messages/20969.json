He didn&#39;t like the \nsound of this, but he had a feeling that Black Arachnia could handle \nthis. He knew how treachrous she was. \n\n&quot;Listen,&quot; he said to her. &quot;She&#39;s mah mate an&#39; leader. Ah know she \nain&#39;t on their side. Most certainly not on Hell Beast. He was gonna \nkill &#39;er. She&#39;s gonna do somethin&#39;, ah got uh feelin&#39;. Ah jus&#39; need \nt&#39; find out. Ah&#39;s been kept outta this fer some reason, but ah&#39;m \ngonna get inta it. Ah was busy back at base wit&#39; Rattrap. Black \nArachnia ain&#39;t no traitor t&#39; us. Ah know she ain&#39;t. But if somethin&#39; \ngoes wrong, an&#39; ya think somethin&#39;s gonna happen, ya can jus&#39; leave. \nYa don&#39;t have t&#39; stick by me if somethin&#39; gonna blow by yer head, \nhear? Ah&#39;ll stay &#39;til ah get uh gun t&#39; mah head, that&#39;s th&#39; way ah \nam. Ah&#39;m used t&#39; it. Ah&#39;m second in command, ah gotta stick by Black \nArachnia. But ah can still save mah own tail. Ah jus&#39; trust her a \nlot. Ya don&#39;t understand how much ah missed her. An&#39; ya don&#39;t have \nt&#39;. Ah jus&#39; need t&#39; get back wit&#39; her and find out what&#39;s th&#39; plan.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; DarkMouse::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No. Black Aracnia is in good with Hell Beast and Megatron. I&#39;ve \nseen \n&gt; them. They walk together now all the time. They have plans. Their \n&gt; going to change the old base to a moving underwater base.&quot;\n&gt; She smiled. &quot;Well, nowing a lot about computers and ease dropping \n&gt; does help once in a while. But you can&#39;t trust Aracnia. She&#39;ll tell \n&gt; Megatron everything.&quot; she had a worried look on her face. She felt \n&gt; that something wasn&#39;t right with Quickstike. She knew he liked her, \n&gt; but how much, she couldn&#39;t say. She didn&#39;t want to hurt him by \n&gt; telling him this, but he had to know. &quot;Look, Aracnia and Megatron \nare \n&gt; working side by side. I can&#39;t take the chance and trust her now. I \n&gt; got left behind once, and was counted for as dead. I didn&#39;t return \n&gt; because I&#39;m sure she would have thought me a traitor or something. \n&gt; I&#39;m no traitor, but I got to do what I can to stay alive.  your the \n&gt; only one I trust. I don&#39;t trust Megatron, Aracnia, Hell Beast, or \n&gt; KitKat. It&#39;s just you and me. I know KitKat&#39;s a good leader and \nall, \n&gt; but she listens to her spark and not her head. She&#39;s bound to get \n&gt; killed. When that happens, I&#39;m toast. So, what do you say, we stick \n&gt; together on this?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, wilddance_mare@h... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quickstrike grinned at Dark Mouse. &quot;Sure thing.
