Tucson\n&gt; looks to Nightshift from where he stands, and then to Lord Elder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I trust that whoever did that to him will be found and they will answer to\n&gt; me.  Now, I will be back, but I would like to show Talon the land outside\n&gt; the Ark, the land we will now protect for all time.  Nightshift, whoever did\n&gt; that to you will pay a price, I promise you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightshift nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Gotchya.

It looks like in the end it was suppose to be a weapon.&quot; SANTON\ngestured at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;I think the only reason reason he is still\nalive is because he was shot while in Beast mode.&quot;\n\nBUMP who was still kneeling over NIGHTSHIFT nodded, &quot;Whatever you do,\ndo not go back to robot mode right now.&quot; He said to NIGHTSHIFT, his\ntones grim.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
