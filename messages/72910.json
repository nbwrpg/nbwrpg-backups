Although PREDACONS like SKY SHADOW got a\n&gt; mischievo=\r\nus look on his face as he heard the accusation, although\n&gt; CRYOTEK&#39;s was mo=\r\nre amused than anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What!?!?&quot; LEO PRIME finally blurted out=\r\n, his word an explosive sound.\n&gt; &quot;You relieve me of what and assign whom?&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO made to walk up to TUSCON but SANTON held him back, &quot;You do not\n&gt; =\r\nhave the right to call for my resignation of command, my authority\n&gt; extend=\r\ns from the council.&quot; LEO&#39;s optics darkened further, &quot;And what\n&gt; make&#39;s you =\r\nthink I would *ever* sell a life for *anyone* for *any*\n&gt; purpose? That sou=\r\nnds like a Predacon lie! and you believed it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Folding his arms over h=\r\nis chest LEO glaring at TUSCON, looking and\n&gt; obviously feeling very insult=\r\ned. &quot;Perhaps it is you who needs to step\n&gt; down if you are so easily taken =\r\nin by this obvious ruse!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; BREAK and MACH KICK walked over and rooted a=\r\nround the hole that DRILL\n&gt; BIT had left behind as if they could pull him o=\r\nut of it.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor the moment, witnessing the seeming altercation of agg=\r\nression circuits between LEO PRIME and TUSCON PRIME as DINOBOT went out of =\r\nthe tunnel, flanking over towards SKY SHADOW with a look of..  AMUSEMENT up=\r\non his faceplate, but remaining in silence.\n\nStaying on inter-Predacon radi=\r\no, which hopefully at close range would work then, and not be audible to th=\r\ne MAXIMALS, and sending a signal to CRYOTEK.  &lt;We seem to be restrained dow=\r\nn here for now.  What are your orders then?  Press on or attempt to instiga=\r\nte altercations within the MAXIMALS?&gt;\n\nThe aerial Predacons up aboveground =\r\nseemed to be cut off from them for now, who had not followed them undergrou=\r\nnd (such as WASPINATOAR and BLACKARACHNIA).\n\nDRILL BIT had dug back undergr=\r\nound once his bait had been laid, digging underneath.  VICE GRIP remained a=\r\nt hte rear of the tunnel, still cloaked, and attempting to (and most likely=\r\n failing) to scan whatever had seemingly cut off the tunnel back to the sur=\r\nface.\n\n\n\n"}}
