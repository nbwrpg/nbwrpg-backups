He bent over grabing the bars and with a heave of his arms=\r\n \nbent them over.  As he walked out the small nebulan ran as fast he \ncould=\r\n. The large bot grabbed his rifle, nebulan bio-partner Muchos \nand aimed at=\r\n Gonzo.\n\n&quot;Auto&quot; he called out.\n\n&quot;Online&quot; the gun replied.\n\nHe pulled the tr=\r\nigger half wayin and a laser shot out targeting the \nrunning nebulan.  With=\r\n the other half a pull withan a few seconds \nGonzo was shreds.  \n\nThe bot s=\r\nlung Muchos over his back and called out &quot;Guarda, Hacha.&quot; \nTwo more nebulan=\r\ns ran to him, jumping up and transforming.  Guarda \ninto a sheild and Hacha=\r\n into an double sided axe.  Wieldign them both \nhe walked down out of his h=\r\nolding tent into the big top.  \n\nAll of the performers stop dead in thier t=\r\nracks after seeing him. One \nbrave performer spoke up.  &quot;H-How did you get =\r\nout?&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up...&quot; was the simple reply.  \n\nThe nebulans ran for thier liv=\r\nes while some ran for weapons.  With a \nslice one way and another the other=\r\n, 50 nebulans were dead.  The \nalrge fighter through his axe end over end c=\r\nutting through nebulans \nbefore finally jamming in front of the exit.  \n\n&quot;Y=\r\nou wanted me to fight, so I fight...&quot;\n\nMuchos once again came over his shou=\r\nlder to his hand.  \n\n&quot;Grenade&quot;\n\n&quot;Online&quot;\n\nThump thump thump...  Three grena=\r\ndes pumped out of the compact \nrifle.  The explosions took out another hund=\r\nred nebulans.  Shots rang \nin from the nebulans who had weapons.  Guarda in=\r\ntercepts them easily \ntaking the hits to his energon shield body. \n\n&quot;Torch&quot;=\r\n\n\n&quot;Online&quot;\n\n He turned and this time from the rifle a large blast of flame =\r\n\nblasted out melting everything in it&#39;s path.  \n\n--------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\nThe big top was a ruin of flames=\r\n and tatters now as bloodshed was all \nover.  Hacha transformed and walked =\r\nto a solitary tap still standing \nin the ruins.  \n&quot;I prefere oil over me ra=\r\nther than blood....kinda a zangy taste.&quot;  He \nwashed off his engineered arm=\r\nour.  \n\n&quot;At least you aren&#39;t covered in dents after every fight Hacha&quot; came=\r\n \nthe reply from Guarda. Who took out a hammer and began to bang out \nhis d=\r\nents.\n\n&quot;There always complaining about this or that. We were fine without \n=\r\nthem before for that tournament where we won them.&quot; Came the hasty \ncomment=\r\n from Muchos\n\n&quot;Oh whatever, they help in battle that is all that matter. No=\r\nw we \nhave to steer this cruiser for Earth.  That is where this IGL is.  \nM=\r\nuchos get us on path.&quot; the prize fighter ordered.\n\n&quot;Uh oh&quot; was all he said.=\r\n\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, I guess one of those freaks reached the alarm, cuz we got=\r\n n \narmy of bounty hunters on us, which means on thing compa=F1ero.  We are=\r\n \nnow fugitives.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ummm, punch it hermano.&quot;  \n\nThe ship jerked as it reach=\r\ned full momentum.  But it wasn&#39;t enough as \nthe bounty ships caught up easi=\r\nly.  \n\n&quot;I have an idea...&quot; Muchos said.\n\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n\nKiller, the head bounty hunter, enter=\r\ned the circus ship and looked at \nthe bloodshed. &quot;They aren&#39;t here....&quot;\n\nUn=\r\nknown the prize fighter and now murderer, were escaping right \nbeneath thie=\r\nr noses  in a stealth escape pod. (what else would you \nescape in...)This w=\r\nas jsut the beggining of thier goal to be top of \nthe IGL tournament....\n\n-=\r\nTo Be Continued\n\n\n\n\n"}}
