The ship was \ncarrying far more passengers than it was designed to, There were 5 \nseats occupied, three crew quarters, and the cargo bay holding the \nescaping predacons.\n\nNow came the decision he&#39;d been dreading. &quot;Relay power from the CR \nchamber to the engines.&quot; Phobia just hoped that nobody was damaged \ncritically.\n\nThe ship flew skyward as the Predacon cave exploded.

The landing however would be a little tricky.\n\n\n\nThere happy now?\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; I think my last post may have been unclear.
