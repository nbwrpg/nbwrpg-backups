Exiting the portal is the Violator, which seems to be in far \nworse of a condition then it was before. All over te outside of ship \nelectricity crackles as explosions occur near the rear of the ship. \nInside, Vile struggles with the controls of the Violator trying to \nregain control of it as it barrels towards the face of the mountain. \n\nVile: &quot;Damn it! The activating of the gate proved to be too much for \nthe ship with its current damages. Skywarp, Methos help me pull up.&quot;\n\nThe two X-Predacons nod and at their stations pull down on two \njoysticks. The combined effort worked, the ship flew up the face of \nthe montain narrowly escaping what seemed to be a certain collision. \nAs the ship flew up another explosion occured destroying two of the \nships engines sending all three of the X-Preds to the ground. As Vile \ngot up he looked in horror as the ship barreled down towards a sheet \nof ice. Quickly he opened a transmission to everyone on the ship.\n\nVile: &quot;All men brace form impact were going to crash!&quot;\n\nAs if on cue the massive ship slammed down against the sheet of ice \nbelow it and began to skid across the ice. Once it came to a stop \nVile stood and looked around, suddenly the ship began to tremble as \nthe ice beneath it began to crack under the ships weight. a moment \nlater the ice gave way and shattered sending everyone on the ship \nflying into the air as if there was no gravity. As the ship continued \nits plunge Vile struggled and pressed a red button causing the ships \nremaining thrusters to go online. Outside the back of the ship lit up \nas three thrusters activated and slowed the ships descent before it \nlanded on a large rock surrounded by hot springs with a loud crash. \nThis sent all members of the Vile Force back down onto the ships \nfloors with a loud crash...\n\nElsewhere, above Alliance Island(you know the alliances base), The \nInfecticon ship the Oblivion floats harmlessly unseen to all scanners \nand eyes. A moment later the ship dephase shifts making it visible to \nscanners and eyes again. Inside Frostbite sits with Blight by her \nside.\n\nFrostbite: &quot;Bring us into the ocean. We shall let the seas protect us \nfrom all and then begin &quot;Operation: Fury.&quot; The fools on the island \nbelow wont have a clue of what is going on until it is too late.&quot;\n\nFrostbite laughs evily as the Infecticon ship flys about 2 miles from \nthe Alliance base and begins to descend down into the depths of the \nocean.\n\n\n"}}
