It \nwas a replicator, and was activated, busy producing equipment.\n\nA small chip emerges from the machine, Ramulus snatching it up immediately. \nHe grins, walking over to another machine and putting it in to test it. The \nchip was specially designed to reroute the bot&#39;s neural interface, keeping it \nunder its own controll even with a mind chip activated, and sending the mind \nchip false information that the bot was under the chip&#39;s controlls. It was \nnearly undetecteble as well.\n\nRamulus snaps open his face plate, carefully inserting the chip and hooking \nit up. Walking back to the machine, many of the chips laying there now, he \ntaps a button, beginning the manufacture of the next item.\n\n"}}
