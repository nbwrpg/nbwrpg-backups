Who&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; knows, a black dragon could =\r\nbe out there tarnishing my reputation as we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; speak.  All right, I n=\r\need to scan your systems and capture your schematics.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then I will =\r\nattempt to seek out an outside match according to the intel I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; acqu=\r\nire from you.  I may not be blind but I still have my other senses that&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; were there before I regained my sight.  It&#39;s a long shot but it shoul=\r\nd&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; work.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME smiled as it seem=\r\ned that finally TUCON was geting the point.&lt;br&gt;\nThat is until he started ta=\r\nlking about cloning and the need for a&lt;br&gt;\nscan, and then a look of shock a=\r\nnd even outrage was appearing on LEO&lt;br&gt;\nPRIME&#39;s face. &quot;What you think that=\r\n I was cloned? What, when?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs he talked there was a sudden commot=\r\nion as the ground began to rumble . . .&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; At this point, DRILL BIT, and the others who had been hiding over&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; underground trasnformed to robot mode and began racing forwards as=\r\n fast as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they could, without care for whom they might be trampling=\r\n over in front of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; them!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gang way gang way gang =\r\nway!&quot;  The group rushing forwards in disarray even&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as the cave see=\r\nmed to be coming down about them!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs the cave in progressed large =\r\nrocks and stone began to rain down on&lt;br&gt;\nthe section of tunnel that the gr=\r\noup was standing in. Tons of sand and&lt;br&gt;\ndirt began to pour in quickly fil=\r\nling it. Any who did not quickly run&lt;br&gt;\nfurther into the tunnel would quic=\r\nkly be caught in the wave of&lt;br&gt;\ndestruction.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNeedless to say CRYO=\r\nTEK and PREDACON FUZORS were quick to make their get away.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRI=\r\nME looked around alarm registering on his face. &quot;Let&#39;s go&lt;br&gt;\nMaximals!&quot; He=\r\n cried out. &quot;Further into the tunnel!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;This could all be a trap&quot; =\r\nWING CALIBER said as he dodge a rather&lt;br&gt;\nlarge stone comming at him.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nLEO PRIME nodded as he also began running urging them forward, &quot;Yeah,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nbut at this point we have no choice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe MAXIMAL FUZORS began=\r\n to run forward as well. It was time to&lt;br&gt;\nexercise the better part of val=\r\nor and retreat.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe whole tunnel continued to rumble and shake dan=\r\ngerously!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(TAG)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n- Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n   =\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body=\r\n&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-BCCAF28E-31AC-4B15-AA31-9ABFFC76B523--\r\n\n"}}
