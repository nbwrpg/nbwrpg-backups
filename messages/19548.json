Well being mortal and \nteenage kid((and a Rookiee)) gives me chance to achieve the impossible.  \nAlso for those that think I&#39;m crazy and have lectures for  me because I&#39;m \ntrying its better to try now than hiding behind the defense of the CF or \ncowering like a dog so save it for later. Since the Alliance is a legend \nright now this is the part of the game when legends fall. Since I&#39;m out of \nlines there is only on thing left to say &quot;Alliance are you ready for this? \nAlso Zardus what do you want me to say when I gloat about my win &quot;Zardus was \nbeaten by Koj of the Silver Dragon or Zardus was lost in my hurricane of \ndestuction&quot; I&#39;ll give you time to think about this.As for the rest Wish me \nluck.\n\n::Koj and Inu-Yasha for Eight hours review the study the plans reworking the \nattack tactics and the postion on the hologram layout of the Alliance \nbase.::\n\n::Koj::\nKoj programs the transwarp cells and re-checks all the figures.\n\n::Inu-Yasha::\nBrings up 5 stasis pods with blank Protoforms in them and installs the \ntranswarp cells.\n\n::Koj::\nKoj relaxs as he loads the pods with ????? then seals them so they only open \nfrom the outside.Then starts to study the data on the fighters in hopes of \nlearning how to predict there actions and up his chance to counter.\n\n::Inu-Yasha::\nRecharges his breath weapons and adds some fire power to his body 2 chain \npulse guns and a Missile launcher in his chest. Then goes to sit out on his \nperch watching the sun.\n\n::Koj::\nKoj goes to the center of the room drops to his knees and opens a small box \nthat contains a White Lilly and meditates on the events to come and what \nLilly told him for one hour. Then he reachs in the box takes out a metallic \nred ribbon and ties it around his forehead. Then goes and takes medical \ntapes up his knuckles and he adjust his body makeing sure all systems are \ngo. &quot;Feel the storm its coming!&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
