Be quiet. If we got, we&#39;ll be killed!&quot;\n\nA small group of Predacons, lead by Terminess, was trying to snaek \ninto a Maximal stronghold on Cybertron. They needed the valuable \ninformation that the Maximals had. Terminess was bright, and was \nknown to have strange psychic powers. She could change things, and \nmake things move with her mind. It was amaxing. Many believe this was \nbecause she was another daughter of StarScream, but there is nothing \nto point to this that it is true. She carefully moved towards the \nmain computer, when a voice called to her.\n\n&quot;Freeze!&quot;\n\n25 Maximals stood their. She only had a group of 5. She didn&#39;t want \nto waste her life, so she surrendered. After a few days she was \nbrought before the high council. Optimal Optimus gave her sentence.\n\n&quot;Terminess, you have been found guilty of treason. We sentence you to \nspend the reast of your days in stasis, travelling the Universe in a \nstasis pod. We have plotted a course that will keep leading in \ncircles. We are giving siganls to all planets not to touch your pod. \nYou should be greatful. It may feel like we are giving you death, but \nit is actually eternal life.\n\nAfter a few more days, Terminess was taken to be placed in her pod. \nBut she had other ideas. After the pod is launched, it will take 5 \ncycles for the stasis to take affect. That&#39;s all the time she needed. \nAfter she was launched, she used her mind skills to hack into the \ncomputer and change her course. She altered it to head to the warp \nportal. In a few mega-cycles she went off course, much to the \nsurprise of the council. She dissapeared into the warp and was never \nseen on cybertron again.\n\nThe pod was travelling fast towards Past Earth. Terminess, unconcious \ninside the pod, was unaware of what was happening. The pod crashed on \nher with the thud. The pod began the DNA scanning and brought her out \nof stasis. When she left the pod she found she had six legs, a \nchooper at the fron and an antenna! She had aquired the Beast Mode of \na termite. She TF&#39;d and began to laugh.\n\n&quot;I did it! I outsmarted the Maximals! I outsmarted Cybertron!&quot; said \nTerminess, pulling out her poison blaster., &quot;Now I can use my talents \nin an actual war. It&#39;s time for Terminess to make an impact on the \nNeo Beast Wars.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
