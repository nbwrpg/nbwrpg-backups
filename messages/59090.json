The thing he \ndoes is grab his Radiant pistol and fire a radioactive blast at \nDragos.\n\nLunekill was in range. She unleashed the three fusion rays at the \nMaximals base. The shields, already damaged by Rockseeker&#39;s kamikaze \nattack, were further reduced to a total power of 15%.\n\nAzureBlade barely had time to avoid the blasts . He transformed to \njet mode and went straight to the hude station that Lunekill was. She \nwas already charging her cannons for a second attack, but she never \nsaw the attack coming.\n\nThe Maximal dragon-jet fired in the central cannon. The charge in it \nblew up and ripped the cannon to splinters. However, the counter-\nattack took him out of the sky and he fell like a brick to the ground.\n\nInside the base, Yggdrasil tried to coordinate the attacks. There \nwere only two attackers, but he couldn&#39;t even realize how persistent \nthey were.\n\nYggdrasil: All units, Azureblade has been hit. The frozen one is back \nin the fray, and the shields won&#39;t hold out much longer. No quarters! \nKill them before you consider making them prisoners!\n\nHe began to ask himself who these guys were...\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Jerame Johnson &lt;jeramej@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Surestrike: Looks at Denzabar and then at his friends &quot;I&#39;ll stay \nhere with Denzabar and help him out.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dragos: Nods and tells the others &quot; Lets get back out there and \nFight.&quot;\n&gt; As the rest of them heads back outside to engage in the defense of \nthe Maximal Base.\n&gt;  \n&gt; SureStrike: Looking at Denzabar &quot; Okay time for a crash Course,&quot; As \nhe starts to teach Denzabar the ropes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gimliyotoden@a... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Comm-mun-ic-ations?\n&gt; Denzabarrepeated.
