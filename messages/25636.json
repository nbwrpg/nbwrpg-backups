There are more of them than there are of us at\nthe moment so it would be a good idea to place thier agressions against the\nother faction of Predacons. The Maximals are currently hurting so they&#39;d be\na low risk of turning against us. If they did we could crush them.&quot;\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;JP3884@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 14, 2001 7:12 AM\nSubject: Re: Bases and Quasar\n\n\n&gt;     Megatron stepped out of the CR chamber, he was the last to go in and\nnow\n&gt; his troops looked to him for the next move. Hell Beast, who was still a\nbit\n&gt; ill, slept mostly.\n&gt;     &quot;According to this screen Megatron, Killfests team is held up here.&quot;\n&gt; Black Aracnia said. She stood before the viewscreen displaying the battle\n&gt; area. &quot;I believe is used to be yours and Kitkats former base.&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron thought a moment. Wht the hell would Killfest go to that\nheap?\n&gt; It was decimated, destroyed. Surely he couldnt hope to settle himself and\nhis\n&gt; forces there. But, prehaps he had a trick up his sleeve. Mabey he was\nlooking\n&gt; for something....mabey Megatron missed something very important that\nKillfest\n&gt; knew about.\n&gt;     &quot;Hmm, very interesting indeed. Mabey we shall put off the attack on\nthe\n&gt; Maximals and hit Killfest and his men agian. Here.&quot; He pointed one large\n&gt; transmetal purple finger to the rock quarry to the east of the cave.\n&gt;     &quot;If we got them there, we could finish them alomst.&quot; Tarantulas said,\n&gt; from behinde a computer terminal. &quot;But dont you think Killfest would be\n&gt; expecting us?&quot;\n&gt;     Megatron did take that into consideration. Killfest was clever, but he\n&gt; and his men were damaged. Megatrons men had the advantage of being\nrepaired.\n&gt; If they did strike Killfest, Megatron and his men would have the upper\nhand.\n&gt;     &quot;I want to scout it out first. Nighteyes, and Waspinator, you will go\nand\n&gt; send back any images you record.&quot; Megatron said, turing to them.\n&gt;     Nighteyes bowed her panther head. &quot;If Megatron says it, it is to be\ndone.\n&gt; I will go.&quot;\n&gt;     Waspinator buzzed over to Megatron and began to praise his leader for\n&gt; such an important task. Megatron swatted them away and sent them to see\nwhat\n&gt; Killfest was up to. ...And if they were spotted, and Killfest did open\nfire,\n&gt; Megatron guessed he woul;d have no choice but to engage him agian. And\nafter\n&gt; that, agian, and agian, and agian.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Ominous watched his four troops enter the Orb. For now Quasar was in\nthe\n&gt; ship. She wouldnt get far, not in the Ord. It was like a giant energon\n&gt; reactor, one wrong move and she could vaporize herself.\n&gt;     &quot;Putnam, where is Darkmouse?&quot; He demanded, slamming his fist agianst a\n&gt; small side table. His tone of voice was angry.\n&gt;     Putnam held out his arms in defeat. &quot;They alluded us sir. Once we\nrepair,\n&gt; we shall go back. Mabey, under your leadership?&quot; He said.\n&gt;     Ominous waved them away in disgust, away to the Energon CR Chambers.\nHe\n&gt; supposed he would need to lead them into battle next time. ut, for now, he\n&gt; was going to get that little arachnid Quasar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
