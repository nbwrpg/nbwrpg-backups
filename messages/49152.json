We all know the rpg seems to bog down these days. Rauq, \nRudra and I will do something about it, and changes, hopefully for the \nbetter, will come sooner or later. \n  However, the council may be an important part of the rpg, but they \nare merely players amongst others. For this reason, it is important \nfor everyone to reply to the posts concerning their characters AS \nOFTEN AS POSSIBLE. I do not ask ten posts daily, but maybe posting \nevery two days would be a good start. With the end of the school year, \nI know everyone will not always be posting ready. I can understand \nthat.\n  Also, LN gave me and Rauq a lot to think about. His arguments had a \nlot of interest, in my opinion, and they could serve for ameliorating \nthe game. If you have suggestions that you feel could help us in that \nsense, please, do like LN (well, except dropping all chars, lol!) and \ngive us feedbacks about the way you feel in this rpg. This council, \nafter all, is here for the players and as players as well. If everyone \ngets really into it, we can and we will make this a lot better.\n  Rudra, Rauq, tell me if I screwed up. BTW, Rudra, I&#39;ll send some \nstuff to you so you can get back in the train.\n\n\n"}}
