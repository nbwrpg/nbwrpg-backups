She tried to stand, but fell back down. She \nwondered why on Cybertron she had the inclination to jumo from the \nship.  She perked her ears up and hear the squablling of the other \nbots.  They were fighting for leadership.  She sighed and new that in \nher state, she couldn&#39;t challange for leadership.  And she needed \nhelp. Her body wasn&#39;t going to hold out without a CR.  She tried to \nstand agains and finally stood on her legs. She wasn&#39;t going to stay \naround let watch them get killed.  She walked over to Atma and the \nothers.  She growled loudly, snapped and bared her teeth.  She raised \nthe hair on her back and snarled. &quot;NOW listen to me.  If you want to \nlead this pack, you will have to fight me.  I have tried to save your \npelts over and over again.  Phobia saved us this last time. And I am \ngrateful to him.  But now is not the time to fight amonst ourselves.  \nWe need to stick together and get ourselves a plan.  Now I have a \nplan if you want to hear it. If not. then walk.  I&#39;m going to go and \nkill those blasted maximals.  But not this minute.&quot; she coughed and \nfell to the ground.  She looked up, still growling. &quot;Now you can \nfight me now, or walk away. Or you can stay and we can kill \nthose, &quot;coughs,&quot;maximals for all they did to us. Revenge, &quot; she \ncoughed and shook from the pain,&quot; REVENGE! &quot;\n\nShe could barely hold her head up. But she hoped she was able to keep \nthem together for a little while longer.   She knew that even with \nonly the five of them, they could attack and hurt them as baddly as \nthey had been hurt.  She lowered her head and groaned.  She didn&#39;t \ncare if they killed her any more.  But she still flet a sence of \nloyalty to them.  She trembled and coughed. Her chest hurt and she \nwhined a bit.  She closed her eyes and hope the pain would stop. \n\n\n"}}
