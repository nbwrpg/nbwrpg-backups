I&#39;m just \ntrying to get my friend to the Maximal base!!!What&#39;s your problem?!&quot;\n\n* Carnage breathed hard, the mech fluid still running down her neck and \ndripping from her claws. Now she thought that she understood, this clone was \nrunning from something or somebot and it thought that she was sent to track \nit down and destroy it.\nCarnage looked the bot over and sneered, even if it was supposed to be a \nfemale clone of Dinobot it was made very poorly, by her standards anyway.\nShe paced in front of the clone, ready for another attack if it decided to \njump at her.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
