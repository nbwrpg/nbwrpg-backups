He \ndove for cover behinde several fallen tress and poked up to fire at Grim \nReaper. He was useing his semiautomatic machine gun. It was a rapid fire \ndevice that was fantastically accurate.\n    \n    Inside, Black Aracnia stared at the blue print of the ship and useing the \nkeyboard began to activate the defense systems. The shiled started, a dozen \nAutoguns burst to life attacking the intruders, and inside the ship the \ncorridor internal defences swung down from the ceiling and were on full alert.\n    &quot;Ah, nothing like having Fort Knox as a base!&quot; She giggled as she got up \nfrom her chair and armed herself with her signiture bowcaster. She opened the \nramp, exited, and CLOSED it behinde her. Joining Paralysis, she aimed at Rush \nand sent a misslebow flying towrds him.\n\n\n    Aerostreak was the one who heard the gunfire first. Grappler and Gunatix \nbegan to worry, along with the Maximals as they drew closer to the vessle. Te \njourney wasnt that far actually, and they were surprized they didnt find \nanyone on the trip.\n    &quot;I dont like it, not one bit!&quot; Grappler hissed as he looked at the battle \nunfolding. He held his bowcaster, similar to Aracnias, close to him.\n    &quot;Well, we had better get down there and meet up with our Commrads. Its \nnow or never.&quot; Gunatix said as the group began to head towrds the battle, \nwepons drawn and battle ready.\n\n    Adrax looked down at the sixsome heading for the battle. New arrivals \nwere always open game to mess with. He could bring them to Aracnia as a \npresent. Three warriors with three Maximal prisoners would be very diplomatic.\n\n"}}
