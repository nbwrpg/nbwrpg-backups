Worse yet the new bot looked like a BABY, it had to be \n&gt; &gt; weak now, but it could be a formidable opponent in the future if \nit \n&gt; &gt; went through the same gradual upgrades as humans. He wouldn&#39;t \nallow \n&gt; &gt; it to happen. HE was the maost powerful bot in the universe, and \nit \n&gt; &gt; would stay that way.

He needed rest and the cave \nwould \n&gt; &gt; offer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough concealment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once inside the mutant found the cave paintings from a youth,  \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; what he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could tell the youth was human, a tribe of the useless fleshy, \n&gt; weak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures must have migrated away and left only thier paintings \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; show they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were ever there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Megaton reached out and touched the wall, a sudden charge of \n&gt; energy \n&gt; &gt; forced\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the large bot away from the wall. He held up his hand and \nscanned \n&gt; &gt; it for an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy signature only to find nothing had happened to him. The \n&gt; &gt; scanns did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reveal one oddity though. A thin layer of berries, sap, and mud \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; coated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his fingers.

The beast transformed to his T-Rex form and went to \n&gt; &gt; investigate. once\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nearby he detected animals, three of them. from the looks of \n&gt; things \n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a mother, father and baby.
