This is an RPG.\n&gt; Not an e-mail group that talks about old toys.  So please, stop.  Unless\nit&#39;s\n&gt; about Unicron or the USSR.  Or voice actors from TF.  Or any other cool\n&gt; cartoons.  Pokemon is not a cool show by the way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Unitron\n&gt; KSLawDogg@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; BTW: Did you buy that new car yet?\n&gt; If not, check this site out.\n&gt; They&#39;re called CarsDirect.com and it&#39;s a pretty sweet way to buy a car.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6847/13/_/_/_/964324708/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
