Tucson had learned that a hero never made\n&gt; the first blow and he was not about to do that now.  So with complete\n&gt; silence, poise, and focus, he closes his optics, stands perfectly straight,\n&gt; and drags his right foot across the ground in a slow semi circle in front of\n&gt; where he stands.  This blossoms into a graceful and fluid form of a\n&gt; meditative exercise similar to Tai Chi.  He implements his katana in the\n&gt; tranquil dance as a dew drop falls from a branch from a tree that hangs over\n&gt; him.  The drop lands on his sword but does not spatter.  It rolls in perfect\n&gt; form, over the blade, which is lowered to the ground as the dew drop lands\n&gt; perfectly intact to a fern leaf.  This maneuver was known as INNER PEACE.\n&gt; The most ancient tricks in the history of Kung Fu, which was also taught in\n&gt; Ninjabot training.  So as Tucson maneuvers once again, his sword braces for\n&gt; impact as he retains a highly meditative state.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nSo as TUSCON braced for impact, using his inner peace and kung Fu\nbalance the DINOBOTS do what they do best and use their might to their\nadvantage.\n\nGRIMLOCK&#39;s sword comming in high, his arm flexing mightilly as he did\nso. He swung up and over, bringing the business end of it straight\ndown the middle, using his weight as well as his skill and cunning to\nhis advantage. He cared nothing for the seeming balance that TUSCON\nhad maintained as he brought his blade down at TUSCON\n\nAt the same time SLAG&#39;s attack came from in through the middle from\nthe back as he thrust foward not allowing Maximal a chance to step\nback or even move, his blade perfectly timed to coincide with\nGRIMLOCK&#39;s attack as well as its angle.\n\nAnd if that were not enough SLUDGE and SNARL were coming in from\neither side, thier size and power making them both forces to be\nreckoned with. With vicious attacks they sought to take a bite out of\nTUSCON with razor sharp teeth!\n\nThis was a group who had fought together for centuries just like this,\nin terrain much harsher than this. it was they who had fought their\nway out of the darkness out of defeat, carving triumph out of loss.\nThey were the ones that even the combiner robots feared to face. When\nit came to fight Unicron, they were the first ones sent in. They were\nwell trained, not by a master as TUSCON was, but by the sheer weight\nof years, the number of victories, their skills, prowess and mindless\nferocity were unmatched! They acted, not as seperate individuals but\nas one beast, each one acting in concert, always in a way that helped\nthe others to close the attack and to do as much damage as possible.\n\nThe more TUSCON would defend, the more they were close the attack, the\nmore he would step away, the more they would close. If he attacked one\nthen the others would use the opening to make the hit. If he attacked\nmore than one then others would close from the opposite side. What\nthey did was driven as much by skill as by instinct - they knew what\nto do without even thinking about it. They were well armed and armored\nand knew how to use them and they would not stop!\n\nClaws, teeth, sword and laser cannon they were bringing them all to\nbear on TUSCON and they had little care for what he said or did, their\nonly goal was to bring him down and to do it now!\n\nThe battle was begining in earnest now and his choice was to fight or flee!\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
