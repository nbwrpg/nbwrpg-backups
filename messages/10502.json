Paralysis signals to the \nothers to stay put until Aracnia said what she needed to say. &quot;Wait here. \nAracnia is gonna tell him off.&quot;\n    Aracnia stands before Rampage. &quot;Now, Rampage. I have control of this \nship, and several armed associates that will fight along with me. Let me rule \nthe Predacons with Megatron now, peacefully, or refuse and die. I hate to be \nso blunt...but were short on time.&quot;\n\n"}}
