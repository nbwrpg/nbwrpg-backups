They land on the ground, looking at each other, waiting for \na strike.\n\n-I&#39;m doing ok,- Prowl replies, jumping back as FZ jumps at him. He \nrecieves the image of Nemesis on the ground, stumbling back from a \nkick from FZ.\n\n-Hey, the battle&#39;s not lost. As long as the Maximals live, we still \nhave a chance,- he thinks to her, the world suddenly flashing as FZ&#39;s \nheel smashes into Prowl&#39;s head. Prowl stumbles to the side, his \nhelmet dented. FZ jumps at him and brings him down.\n\nThe future self of the Alliance commander smiles as he stands up, \ndragging Prowl up with him. FZ&#39;s left hand was pressed to Prowl&#39;s \nforehead, holding the Maximal&#39;s head in place while his other hand \nheld Prowl&#39;s arms. The orb in FZ&#39;s left hand flashes slightly.\n\nInside Prowl&#39;s mind, suggestions were being whispered from FZ&#39;s orb. \nIt hinted at turning against the Maximals, whispered that it was a \ngood idea, benificial. Prowl&#39;s mind fought against it, but the orb \nwas stronger. It was, after all, a Vok artifact.\n\nImages of Alliance victory fluttered through Prowl&#39;s mind, the orb \ntrying to turn him against the Maximals. Maximal bodies were sprawled \naround the Cybertronian Fire, and Alliance troops were standing \nproudly in the background. Prowl&#39;s eyes looked through the bodies, \nseeing his and strangely feeling rather proud of it. Then his eyes \nstopped at one body, Iron Raptor...\n\nProwl yells, twisting out of FZ&#39;s grasp and jumping away from the \nbot. He spins around, growling.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Prowl says. He didn&#39;t appreciate having his mind toyed \nwith. His wrist plate slid aside, a pair of nunchucks flipping out. \nHe put the two parts together, the string-like material that combined \nthem pulling into the two halves. The halves extended and combined, \nmaking a glowing staff.\n\nFZ jumps back as Prowl swings the staff toward him. The Alliance \nbot&#39;s mind was on other manners.\n\n&quot;I wouldn&#39;t stab down if I were you,&quot; he says over the comm to Iron \nRaptor. He&#39;d seen the image she&#39;d projected to Prowl while trying to \ninfluence Prowl&#39;s mind, &quot;My troops are in position to destroy your \nbase. Something like killing a second-in-command can really influence \nthem to destroy.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPerndabot jumps at Prowl as the energy blast hits him. He yells, \nfalling to the ground and clutching at his chest, although every part \nof his body was burning with pain. He shudders, his armor beginning \nto melt.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Oops! Sorry about that. I never knew DarkWolf split.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor growled from behind her helm as she watchjed the \ncharge \n&gt; Scattershot was sending interfere with her energy.\n&gt; Feeling the kickback as the energy of the explosion was sucked into \nthe beam \n&gt; only to make it stronger.\n&gt; The sword in her hands was almost burning hot, and she was sure \nthat it \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be able to take the heat of this energy for too much \nlonger.\n&gt; Her fingers were already cramping!\n&gt; Iron Raptor concintrated her thoughts and directed them to Prowl \nwhile she \n&gt; kept the beam going.*\n&gt; &lt; Prowl? How are you holding up?&gt;\n&gt; Just then the dropping motion of Nemisis cought her attention and \nshe looked \n&gt; towards his crippled form as he came to earth.\n&gt; Her scanners detecting that he was still awake but very near to \nstasis lock.\n&gt; Perhaps...it was time to finish him.\n&gt; &lt; I think it&#39;s time...to end a threat.&gt; Her thoughts didn&#39;t seem so \nsure and \n&gt; she projected the image of the fallen Nemisis, knowing that Prowl \nwould pick \n&gt; them up even those those thoughts weren&#39;t directed to him.\n&gt; But so many things played in her mind, about what the impact of \nwhat she \n&gt; would do would have on this battle.\n&gt; She would have killed a threat, but then the Alliance would be \nenraged and \n&gt; perhaps finish this battle...by finishing the Maximals.\n&gt; Iron Raptor sighed.\n&gt; &lt; We&#39;ve lost already. We lost the moment Oblitercon took shape.&gt;\n&gt; It was the truth too, and from what her scanners showed, there were \nenemies \n&gt; in the ship. And that the CF had been damaged pretty bad.\n&gt; She glared at the lump on the ground which was Nemisis Enforcer, \nwalking up \n&gt; to him before her shoulder snapped forward from the impact of \nScattershots \n&gt; charges struck her.\n&gt; Iron Raptor winced and grit her teeth, biting back the pain. Her \neyes taking \n&gt; a good look around her and seeing all of the carnage and battles.\n&gt; All of the mech-fluid and bodies.\n&gt; This was war. Real war.\n&gt; And she was sick of it!\n&gt; Iron Raptor retracted her helm, her hair falling out and down her \nback, her \n&gt; head slowly turning towards Scattershot, not with a frown, but with \na blank \n&gt; expression.\n&gt; The beam had disappeared by now and the blade shimmered as she \nlowered the \n&gt; tip of it down towards the crippled Nemisis, resting the tip just \nabove his \n&gt; spark cavity.\n&gt; Her free hand rested against her shoulder, mech-fluid leaking \nbetween her \n&gt; fingers.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Scattershot...just how much do Alliance bots value their \nsuperiors? Not \n&gt; much?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * normal voice, the sword still just above Nemisis Enforcer&#39;s spark.\n&gt; Didn&#39;t really matter what his answer was, as soon as he gave her \none that \n&gt; sword would be through Nemisis&#39;s cavity and into his spark.\n&gt; But it was too bad that he wasn&#39;t part of a gustalt, then she would \nbe \n&gt; removing a vital limb and the gustalt wouldn&#39;t be able to form \nwithout, \n&gt; say...a leg.\n&gt; Iron Raptor&#39;s mint ticked with that thought,  dwelling more on it \nand \n&gt; turning it around in her mind.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
