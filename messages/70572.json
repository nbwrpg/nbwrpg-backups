He sighs heavilly, as his chest=\r\n rises and falls with each breath.  The light in his chest continues to pul=\r\nsate, and even brighter than before.  Straight Shot, who was perhaps the cl=\r\nossest to Tucson as well as Rat Trap, could now feel something they had not=\r\n yet felt before.  Something deep down in their hearts, a power unlike any =\r\nother, yet simple enough where those who had a heart could feel it. They lo=\r\nok to each other.  Straight Shot puts a hand on his shoulder.\n\n&quot;Are you thi=\r\nnking what I&#39;m thinking?&quot;\n\nRat Trap nodds.\n\n&quot;I ain&#39;t never felt like this b=\r\nefore but I definitely am think&#39;n what you&#39;re think&#39;n.  No one should have =\r\nta fight a battle on their own, and if Wheels is gonna win this, he needs o=\r\nur support big time.  Notice how his chest glows brighter, when we get clos=\r\nser ta the glass? That&#39;s what he needs, he needs ALL of us ta believe in hi=\r\nm, it&#39;s in our hearts, not in our weapons.&quot;\n\nHe faces everyone.\n\n&quot;Guys, Whe=\r\nels is fightn&#39; a battle of his life in there, and we all know that no great=\r\n leader should ever have ta believe that he&#39;s alone in battle.  He&#39;s got wh=\r\nat it takes in his heart ta stay a float, but, he needs somethn&#39; extra ta g=\r\no the distance completely.  It&#39;s like he said, we all got somethn&#39; those cr=\r\neepoids don&#39;t have.  And it&#39;s so simple that even organics have it.&quot;\n\nQuick=\r\nstride puts a hand over his chest.  He was very concerned for Tucson and Ro=\r\ndimus.  So much so that he had been trying to hold back a tear but one just=\r\n simply escapes and cascades down his faceplate. \n\n&quot; You&#39;re right Rat Trap,=\r\n no great warrior fights alone.  We can&#39;t let Tucson and Rodimus die, we ju=\r\nst can&#39;t.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot steps forward.\n\n&quot;And we&#39;re not going to either.&quot;\n=\r\n\nNight Shift could hear what was going on, and like Tucson he was a fighter=\r\n.  And a fighter with a heart bigger than his own chest cavity.\n\n&quot; No great=\r\n warrior fights alone.  Tucson, if you can hear us, big guy, we&#39;re all behi=\r\nnd ya a hundred percent.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s at this time, when a simple red light begin=\r\ns to pulsate in Night Shift.  The same thing happens to Straight Shot, Rat =\r\nTrap, and Quickstride.  And spiritually, they pour their hearts and souls i=\r\nnto hoping that Tucson can pull through and succeed.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nElita started to sob and she opened a com link and said to her dad &quot;Dad wak=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; up...

He begins to talk in his sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The distance that =\r\nseperates Tuscon from Rodimus is fairly short, only\n&gt; a few feet. He is jus=\r\nt outside of arm&#39;s reach. Legacy glanced over at\n&gt; Tuscon as his brain wave=\r\n patturn indicated that he was rising up into\n&gt; a more wakeful state of sle=\r\nep for some reason. He moved quickly as he\n&gt; saw Tuscon&#39;s hand reaching for=\r\n Rodimus snf stepped around the beds . .\n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Just - a=\r\n hand - a - way. Just - a hand a way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He fights hard to extend his=\r\n arm far enough to attempt to feel Rodimus&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy was abou=\r\nt to touch Tuscon&#39;s hand, pehpas help him make the\n&gt; contact when several o=\r\nf the tendrils that lay on Rodimus, some of the\n&gt; last few reached out and =\r\ngrabbed hold of Tuscon&#39;s arm! A shock of\n&gt; energy went through it as it glo=\r\nwed blue for a moment, then red and\n&gt; then began to settle down into a colo=\r\nr that was unsettling close to\n&gt; Tuscon&#39;s color.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Quickly!&quot; Legacy sai=\r\nd to bump and Santon, his voice louder than\n&gt; normal, &quot;This tendril must be=\r\n severed from Tuscon&#39;s arm.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With a nod from Santon, Bump came over wi=\r\nth a laser cutter and began\n&gt; working on it as Santon continued to work on =\r\nRodimus. This proceedure\n&gt; was proving to be far more difficult then he had=\r\n at first anticipated.\n&gt; Meanwhile Tuscon&#39;s form goes limp as he fell back =\r\ninto the deep states\n&gt; of sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
