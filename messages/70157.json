Does Darkhawk have a reaso=\r\nn to hates you? Have you done\n&gt; something to him?&quot;\n\nAs Perceptor spoke Rodi=\r\nmus barely heard him. It was as if inside his head voices were talking. The=\r\n word faliure echoing through his systems. Some voices seemed to be whisper=\r\ning into his ears while others were yelling at the top of thier lungs. Some=\r\n where reminding him of his failure - his failure to protect Nightlight, hi=\r\ns failure to defeat Cyclonus, and his failure to keep the power of the matr=\r\nix. \n\nYet despite all of that, he could now hear voices of hope, of redempt=\r\nion, of a returning to his former glory!\n\n&quot;I will not allow anyone to come =\r\nto harm because of my own failure!&quot; Rodims said again, but this time he con=\r\ntinued, &quot;Because I will no longer allow my failure to consume me!!&quot; \n\nIt wa=\r\ns a profound statement of some internal conviction he felt. Meanwhile some =\r\ninternal warmth stealed over his internal systems, as the fire that had bee=\r\nn cold and black for so long was now burning a bright firey red as a power =\r\nthat he had almost forgotten about once again flooded him. \n\nWhen Rodimus l=\r\nooked back at Perceptor again, it was not through the crimson optics of a D=\r\necepticon or Predacon, but the clear yellow ones of an Autobot, one that ha=\r\nd once been given the task to lead the Autobots through thier darkest hour,=\r\n only to be consumed by it, but now through the hope and efforts of others =\r\nhad risen once again. \n\nWith a swift movement the reborn RODIMUS PRIME atte=\r\nmpted to shove Perceptor back. Then without out even looking to see if he h=\r\nad been successful he leaped over to the cell block control panel and enter=\r\ned the command that would open all the cells and release the prisoners!\n\n&quot;R=\r\nISE AUTOBOTS AND MAXIMALS!&quot; Rodimus said both out loud and over the Maximal=\r\n and Autobot frequencies, &quot;THE TIME HAS COME TO FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM! ARIS=\r\nE!&quot;\n\nOOC: Airly, its up to you how successful that was :)\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
