Go to the \nold\n&gt; Predicon cave. Look for evidense of a collapsed tunnel. You&#39;ll have \nto\n&gt; dig through a little bit. When your in, the tunnel will lead you to \na\n&gt; underground lava chamber. The new base is inside the lava chamber \non a\n&gt; small island. Hope to see you soon.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
