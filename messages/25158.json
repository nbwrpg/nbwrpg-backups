Releasing a few captives would be alright...but she knew\n&gt; from experience that the Maximals were hard to stop once the rage of\nbattle\n&gt; took them.\n&gt; She sighed and straightened herself out, opening her comm-link.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Dark One...I have to say that...the proposition is very...tempting.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She was out of breath and tired, sweating in her suit.\n&gt; Iron Raptor swollowed and lowered her helm, looking out over the field as\n&gt; the battle continued.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; But I need to meet face to face with Zardus about this...while we BOTH\n&gt; give the word to stop the fighting. You know my location, tell him, I&#39;ll\nbe\n&gt; waiting.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then shut off the transmission to Dark One and opened one to all\n&gt; Maximal codes, wondering if they were going to listen to her or will it be\na\n&gt; reapeat of that one time when she had to shout to Oblitertron to shoot at\n&gt; her instead.\n&gt; It had to be worth the risk.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Maximals!! Chordat&#39;s being held by the Alliance and they&#39;ve said that\nthey\n&gt; would release him if we relaeased their troops that are in our ship and\nlet\n&gt; them leave without firing on them.\n&gt; I want you ALL to cease fire on any enemy and converge on my position, if\nwe\n&gt; want our Maximal back alive you&#39;ll do this for him. I don&#39;t want his life\n&gt; hanging on your shoulders just because a few of us might be trigger\nhappy.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She kept her comm open as she waited, to all codes. Both Maximal and\n&gt; enemy, hoping that the Maximals would listen, and if they didn&#39;t then she\n&gt; would have to do something about it.\n&gt; Iron Raptor looked at her sword, a light show might do, but not to hurt\n&gt; anyone, just to get them shocked into listening, if it became that bad.\n&gt; Maybe another stream of light except into the cloude, create some thunder.\n&gt; Just something.\n&gt; But she hoped that she wouldn&#39;t have to drain her energy to go that.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
