The Maximal =\r\nHigh Council is internally repressive and paranoid of another war, and expe=\r\nriments on their own citizens and law enforcement.\n\nWhat you can say is it&#39;=\r\ns the intiial stages of the loop we see in many Transofrmers media where th=\r\ne Autobot repression gives rise to the corruption that the Decepticons use =\r\nas an impetus to rise ot power.  Whether the castes of Transformers: Prime =\r\nand the Exodus novel, or the Marvel US nad UK comics, or referenced in the =\r\nAllspark ALmanac.  \n\nSo, things are very grey and grey.  The Predacons have=\r\n many justified grievances, and the Maximals are engaged in a degree of cor=\r\nruption adn repression of thier own people, and are far from perfect.  So y=\r\nou can say it&#39;s the drive of the TRANSFORMERS all over again.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have =\r\nwritten Airly about this but I am going to bring it out in the\n&gt; open as we=\r\nll. I am trying to create a cohesive history of things and I\n&gt; am creating =\r\nwhat Cybertron is now and this is will require a soft\n&gt; reboot of Cybertron=\r\n. I am basing it in part on our sister RPG site:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://wikihost.org/w=\r\nikis/nbwrpg_wiki/wiki/start\n&gt; \n&gt; As well as using Transformers Animated for=\r\n the general FEEL and\n&gt; ATMOSPHERE of Cybertron today. My history for Beast=\r\n Wars basically\n&gt; uses G1/G2 cartoon from the 80&#39;s with elements from the c=\r\nomics and\n&gt; perhaps some of the other toons for spice. I am ignoring Beast\n=\r\n&gt; Machines, although if someone wants or needs elements from it it can\n&gt; be=\r\n incorporated into what we have. For me Cybertron is still metal and\n&gt; the =\r\nMaximal council rules, and there is a cold war of sorts going on\n&gt; on Cyber=\r\ntron between the Maximals and the Predacons. Decepticons and\n&gt; Autobots exi=\r\nst but are consider rare and odd, Decepticons are to be\n&gt; hunted down and A=\r\nutobots are considerfed relics of times past.\n&gt; \n&gt; None of this should affe=\r\nct what has already happened here on old\n&gt; Earth, but if anyone has any que=\r\nstions or comments, please feel free\n&gt; to let me know. I have a time line i=\r\nn the works to help put things\n&gt; into perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
