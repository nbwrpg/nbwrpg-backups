Indeed now she had what she needed, however, wanted Teltoli to know the meaning of work before she finally settle down and began to make their meal. But even this wasn&#39;t really work compared to what she had in store for the fuzor, but it was more positive to dwell on it over a nice warm morning meal.\r\nCarnage didn&#39;t bother to lower herself to the ground to continue wrapping while Teltoli flew off in search for that boulder she had asked for. It was good to see that she was listening so well to given commands, which would benefit both her and her commander since it was annoying having to give an order twice or even more then that.  However, even while he mind settled back into getting to work she could hear the growing sound of Teltoli&#39;s approach, thinking to herself that she had located the moss rather quickly.\r\nIt didn&#39;t take Teltoli long before she finally landed and made enough comments about the moss to cause Carnage to turn and look towards her with a knowing smile. That was what she had thought about that exact same fungi when she first discovered it&#39;s properties, but now she thought it as no different then picking flowers from a clearing on a summers day. Perhaps Teltoli would get so that it was the same for her, since she would learn just what this moss was used for.\r\nCarnage picked the leaf carrying the moss and look inside, closing it after nodding. Teltoli had picked the right fungi.  But she glanced over towards her with a look in her optics which would clearly tell Teltoli to get to her feet if she could read it correctly, though that glance turned to a glare when she heard Teltoli&#39;s next words.  She wasn&#39;t moving until she had explained just what the purposes of the boulders and moss was?\r\nCarnage put the leaf down and looked squarely at Teltoli, even though she could see the hint of a smile on the fuzor&#39;s lips. She had been in a fairly good mood and still was but what was Teltoli doing this for when she was the one who was supposed to be proving herself, and being boneheaded as this was a way that a soldier would get their throat cut by a superior officer.  And she wasn�t just going to let this go, the young woman had to learn this valuable lesson sooner or later.\r\nCarnage went to walk by Teltoli when she swung her arm around so that it would curl around the girls neck, moving so that she would take Teltoli down onto the ground roughly, going to move the arm from around her neck to replacing it with a hand firmly clamped around it instead. Tight but not enough to choke off any air. She brought her other arm up so that he hand was by her own head, claws springing from her finger tips before snapping it down towards Teltoli�s face only to have them dig into the ground less then an inch from her skull.  However, while doing so her expression was blank with no sign of aggression in it, meaning that this was a lesson to be learned and not a fight to be won. Her voice was flat as she spoke.**  � You�re lucky I�m your friend and not some Pred commander, otherwise I�d have your head on a pike right now.�  *her optics narrowed.* � One of the first rules is to learn how to take an order and keep your opinions to yourself. If you were being tested now instead of this afternoon�you would have failed right there.�\r\n\r\n( Carnage: The attack might be taken as a mode yet it is now. All actions are �woulds� and �coulds�, which indicates that Steph may accept the actions and react to them or not. Which would leave the attack void. It was just mind to make this fact clear, as to not confuse so that I would be wrongly accused.  Thank you for what time you took to read this and RP well.)\r\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Email, News, Links and The Best Selection at http://www.AnimeNation.com\n\n"}}
