His arms, his legs. His chest rose and\n&gt; felt quickly, as if in panting movements. He looked at Transulas now\ncoming\n&gt; to him, with a med kit. He thought with his, damage it wouldn&#39;t help too\n&gt; much.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked back at Mentella. &quot;Yer joinin&#39;?&quot; His voice was a little quivery\nto\n&gt; sound tough and solid as he usually was. But the last few days were stress\n&gt; for the little Fuzor. &quot;Good.&quot; He could feel his head lightly shaking. He\n&gt; wanted it to stop. &quot;S-stick wit&#39; us.&quot; Then he quickly added, &quot;Jus&#39; don&#39;t\ngo\n&gt; near Hell Beast!
