Since the taking\nof that prisoner caused so much emotion in Rodimus it was obviously\nsomeone very close to him. It was a femme. I&#39;d say that it was most\nlikely Prime&#39;s lover. He was clearly showing the most emotion. So much\nthat he wasn&#39;t leading with a clar mind and that the Maximals had to\nforce him to pull out.

I\nsaw him, in car mode, drive through a Predacon femme at speeds close\nto 300mph. He criticaly injured her.
