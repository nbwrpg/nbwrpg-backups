It might limit the possibilities to just cut \noff mobile ship defences, but it&#39;ll cut off alot of arguing and \nconfusion as well.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think that crafts with limited defenses should be allowed as long \nas\n&gt; they&#39;re not abused. Phobias former ship would be a good example, it \nwas\n&gt; designed to hold up to 5 bots comfortably but had room for more. It \nhad\n&gt; shielding that could be knocked out by a series of missles. (Nobody \ntried to\n&gt; destroy it until the preds tried thier dramatic escape. Mini \nslipped a bot\n&gt; into the ship when  I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the posts. It had \nforward\n&gt; guns that had to take time to recharge after firing depending on \nthe force\n&gt; of the blast. (An easy target from all sides except the front. I \nset the\n&gt; limitations within reason, I feal that other ships should be allowed\n&gt; depending on limitations. All ships can be destroyed if the right \nweapon is\n&gt; used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phobias ship was allowed for months until it was destroyed, other \nships\n&gt; should be allowed too.\n\n\n"}}
