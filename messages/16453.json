She saw a bunch of \nbuttons around the speaker on the console.  She shook her head.&quot;No, \nnot those buttons,&quot;  She kept looking and saw a panel that was \nconnected to a columb that led deeper into the front of the craft.  \nShe shook her head again.  She couldn&#39;t remember how these things \nwere put together.  Too much of her prgramming had been scrambled.  \nShe kept looking and then turned her eyes to her seat.  She looked \ndown on hte left side of the seat and saw a little lever near the \nbase of the seat.  She looked and saw a wire connected from the lever \nto something under her seat.  She felt her spark jump at the notion \nof her idea being right.  She then gave a deep sigh and prayed to the \nmatrix that her hunch would be right.  She lowered her hand and \nwrapped her hand around the lever.  She held the lever with a death \ngrip.  She then closed her eyes and held her breath.  She made one \nlast prayer before pulling the lever.\n\n(NO, she didn&#39;t pull the lever.  She was just holding it at this \npoint.  But if they land before she pulls it and pulled out of the \ncraft and not on her own free will, she will pull the lever just \nbecause she has such a tight grip on it. This all on that hunch that \nthe lever she is holding is the eject lever.  But that is up to you \nYanshosh)\n\n\n"}}
