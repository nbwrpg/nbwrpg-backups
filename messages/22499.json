Was he a Pred? Alliance?\nAnyway, he was going down!\n\nIron Raptor turned and faced Shadow, feeling her muscles tighten as she \nlooked at him.\nWould her body react on it&#39;s own again, leaving her mind to catch up when it \nwas all over...again?\nThere was only one way to find out.\nIron Raptor looked at Prowl for a sec.*\n\n&lt; Ofcourse, I wouldn&#39;t like it any other WAY!!&gt;\n\n* With that she felt her body shift, just the same as it had when it moved \non it&#39;s own the first time.\nOnly...only she had a feeling that she might be able to controle it this \ntime.\nIron Raptor pounded her feet in two quick steps towards Shadow before she \nremoved her sword from behind her head in one fluid motion, the blade \nglowing for a sec, then bringing it down in one smooth slash, sending an \nenergy slash towards Shadow.\nBut then she brought up her hand again, leaving the sword to point up \nstright in the air with her arms straight as well...and another e-slash sent \ntowards the enemy.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
