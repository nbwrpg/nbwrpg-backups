If they wouldn&#39;t come to him he would come to them!\nHe hit the doors with his shoulder and scanned before they opened out to the \nbattle field beyond, he sighted his target and walked through.\nDinobot aimed his rifle at Scourge (hope I spelled it right) as the doors \nclosed behind him, this one would be the first to sample the explosive power \nof a reround laser-pulse rifle!\nHe snarled as he locked in on target and fired at Scourge&#39;s torso, a mirage \nof charges heading straight for the Predacon&#39;s chest-plate. It wasn&#39;t called \na reround for nothing.\nDinobot knew that this weapon hadn&#39;t been dubbed laser-pulse for nothing \neither, once the charges came into contact with a solid mass they would \nexplode with the force of a small techtonic explosion.\nMainly ripping a bot to peices!\nHe snarled, he had chosen well!*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
