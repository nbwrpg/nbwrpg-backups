You can \n&gt;&gt; Retire,\n&gt;&gt; Little one &quot;He said to Nightlight&quot; keep open your comlink &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes Sir&quot;said the femme and she left the room and headed to her quarters\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perceptor Arrived too and he sit down\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus turned as Hydras entered and nodded agreeably. &quot;Greetings\n&gt; Hydras.&quot; Cyclonus said as he came to stand in front of the three new\n&gt; soldiers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus gestured at them as he continued spaeking, &quot;You may recognize\n&gt; them from the last battle we had.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; voice dropped as he\n&gt; talked, but the confidence in it continued. &quot;These are my progeny.&quot; he\n&gt; said carefully. &quot;I created them with the last remnants of the matrix I\n&gt; had absorbed, and gave them life.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus gestured at each one in turn, &quot;The first is called\n&gt; Deepstryke, and he is an excellent tactical commander soldier.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he spoke, the largest of the three soldiers stepped foward and\n&gt; saluted Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The next is named Phobia.&quot; Cyclonus said, gesturing at the red and\n&gt; white female soldier. &quot;She is an excellent warrior, but specializes in\n&gt; psychological warfare.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The female nodded at Hydras, smiling coyly, at the last moment her\n&gt; smile becoming more impish and daring.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The last is called Nightrazor.&quot; Cyclonus said as he gestured at the\n&gt; dark colored soldier. &quot;He is one of the best infiltration experts I\n&gt; have seen. Able to become invisible and teleport, there are few places\n&gt; he cannot get to unseen.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus turned back to Hydras, &quot;He is the one I had watching the Ark\n&gt; all this time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightrazor just nodded at Hydras, saying nothing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deepstryke nodded as Cyclonus concluded the introductions, &quot;Hydras, we\n&gt; have come in repsonse to Cyclonus&#39; call to arms. We have heard that\n&gt; you have captured the Autobot leader. Is this true?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
