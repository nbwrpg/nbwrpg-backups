Like him, the sight of Dark Rodimus was enough to \ndim her trust in the real Rodimus Prime as she remembers what had happened \nto him in the past.  She opens a com link to Tucson directly.\n\n&quot; Tucson, it&#39;s me, look, I think ya might have ta take leadership privileges \naway from Rodimus.  He&#39;s turned evil again.  And I don&#39;t think Nightshift or \nanyone else is gonna trust him after this.  I know I won&#39;t. &quot;\n\nTucson gets her call while holding onto Noctorro, flying him back to where \nthe other injured Fuzors are to stand guard until help got to them.  His \neyes narrow.\n\n&quot; I was afraid of this, Noctorro.  Rodimus has been taken again.  Straight \nShot is right, he can&#39;t be trusted.  And he accuses me of not being in my \nright of mind..  Not good, not good at all.&quot;\n\nHe continues his flight while carefully tending to his comrade.\n\n&quot; Leo Prime, I am flying Noctorro back to the damaged Fuzors and I will \nstand guard with them until help arrives.  In the mean time, Rodimus has \nfallen back into evil hands and I think it&#39;s best if he is barred from \nleadership duties until further notice.  I don&#39;t like being this harsh, but \nright now he can&#39;t be trusted.  Tell Bump to secure Nightlight in the med \nbay and put the Ark in immediate lockdown. We can&#39;t afford to take any \nchances.&quot;\n\nNightshift continues to keep his doors locked and engine in drive for quick \nescape if need be.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Dark Rodimus get to Elita.  If \nanything he knew that returning her to the Ark would also put his other \ncomrades at risk.  That too was out of the question.\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t think so, Punk, you ain&#39;t puttn one mean aft hand on anyone if I \ncan help it!  You gotta outrun me first before ya even THINK about gett&#39;n \nyour hands on her!   Hold on tight kid, I think we&#39;re in for a little car \nchase.&quot;\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n\nOn Aug 13, 2011, at 8:56 AM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Straight Shot&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Upon encountering Dark Rodimus, Straight Shot&#39;s reaction was one of\n&gt;&gt; deviousness instead of fear.  She looks around quickly and realizes the\n&gt;&gt; terrain was full of trees that may be damaged but were still stable \n&gt;&gt; enough\n&gt;&gt; to hold her weight.  She jumps up to catch a hanging branch and like a\n&gt;&gt; skilled acrobat, she manages to swing herself up higher into the trees.\n&gt;&gt; From there, she could see a large branch severely cracked, hanging right\n&gt;&gt; over Dark Rodimus&#39;s head.     She then spots a large tree root at the \n&gt;&gt; edge\n&gt;&gt; of what looked like a tar pool.  How convenient was that?  And she \n&gt;&gt; certainly\n&gt;&gt; was fast enough to dart out of the way if she had to.  But if she could \n&gt;&gt; only\n&gt;&gt; break that branch without falling out of the tree herself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Hmmm...  He&#39;s right, we typically are kinda predictable..  So why not \n&gt;&gt; try\n&gt;&gt; something original?  Now how deep is that crack?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; She examines the crack in the branch.  She finds that with just a strong \n&gt;&gt; hit\n&gt;&gt; with a sharp object, the branch would definitely come down. She raises a\n&gt;&gt; brow, aims her arm launcher and fires at the crack in the branch.  She \n&gt;&gt; hits\n&gt;&gt; her target as the branch cracks loudly and detaches from the damaged tree\n&gt;&gt; with a loud creaking noise.  She hoped her first plan of attack would \n&gt;&gt; work.\n&gt;&gt; Phase two would also prove difficult as she waits to see how the chips \n&gt;&gt; fall,\n&gt;&gt; literally.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Timber..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – Dark Rodimus&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (OOC: Remember, I said the figure stepped into a clearing. By that\n&gt; definition there should be nothing over his head, at the very least no\n&gt; big branches)\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a look of amusement from DARK RODIMUS as he turned to watch\n&gt; STRAIGHT SHOT. Not that he had lost track of the others, but he kept\n&gt; her in view as well. He watched her swing up into the trees and try to\n&gt; bring a branch down.\n&gt;\n&gt; “How very amusing.” He said the smile on DARK RODIMUS’ face was barely\n&gt; visible in the fading moonlight that cut through all the barren trees.\n&gt; Most of the leaves and even a lot of the bark had been either knocked\n&gt; or burned away from the trees making them look like so many match\n&gt; sticks. Even the tar pit had not escaped the ravages of the fires that\n&gt; had recently burned through, it was dried up and looked almost solid\n&gt; the water leeched away by the heat that had so recently ripped through\n&gt; the area.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Nightshift&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile Nightshift watches from a good distance as Straight Shot \n&gt;&gt; attempts\n&gt;&gt; to play decoy with Dark Rodimus.  Yet seeing him seems extremely \n&gt;&gt; disturbing\n&gt;&gt; to Nightshift.  He rolls into view and looks to the dark imposter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; So that&#39;s it, huh?!  First you make us believe you&#39;re all over the evil\n&gt;&gt; thing and now you go right back ta be&#39;n an A class Aft.  Nice, real nice.\n&gt;&gt; Elita hate ta say it but I think your dad just turned tail on us.  That&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; it, I take orders from Leo and Tucson but that&#39;s about it.  Consider\n&gt;&gt; yourself on my do not trust list.  Peace out.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He turns around to drive Elita to safety.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; FROM HERE ON OUT, I ONLY TAKE ORDERS FROM REAL PRIMES, NOT OVER RATED \n&gt;&gt; HOT\n&gt;&gt; ROD WANNA BE AFTS LIKE YOU!&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He secures Elita on his drivers side seats.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Sorry Elita but your dad really is act&#39;n like a real aft right now&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; “What means Tail on???”said Elita confused  “and what means AFT? Is he my\n&gt;&gt; daddy??”\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD - NIGHTSHIFT&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Nightshift tries to get Elita to a safe location, he tries to explain \n&gt;&gt; his\n&gt;&gt; language to her.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Uhh yeah those were not very nice words.  Aft means the rear end and\n&gt;&gt; turn&#39;n tail means ya turn and run&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;OLD - ELITA&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &quot;Who is he??&quot;said Elita while she looked the dark Rodimus and hide&quot;looks\n&gt;&gt;  like my dad... But more Scary...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – DARK RODIMUS, WASPINATOR, SCOURGE & SWEEPS&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dark image of RODIMUS turned to look at NIGHTSHIFT and ELITA as\n&gt; they both moved away from him and he smiled, the grill plating in his\n&gt; mouth glinting a strange silver color in the moonlight. “Come my\n&gt; love.” He said to ELITA in a dark voice so much like that of RODIMUS\n&gt; PRIME, “Come to papa.”\n&gt;\n&gt; He held in his left hand the device he picked up, his rifle in his right.\n&gt;\n&gt; SCOURGE shifted form as he landed on the ground a few meters from DARK\n&gt; RODIMUS, his sweeps following suit. “You’re coming with us!” SCOURGE’s\n&gt; voice all business as his sweeps fanned out trying to surround DARK\n&gt; RODIMUS. “Hydras will have a few questions for you.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile from above WASPINATOR buzzed around, unsure what to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a dark chuckle from DARK RODIMUS as he stepped back closer\n&gt; to the tree line on the far side, temporarily making it difficult to\n&gt; surround him. “I will do no such thing.” He held the device he picked\n&gt; up in his hand and looked at it and smiled.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked over at NIGHTSHIFT again, his optics seeming to find ELITA\n&gt; quickly enough, “Your papa misses you.” He said with a dark smile.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson quickly catches Noctorro as he puts his body beneath \n&gt;&gt; his\n&gt;&gt; to support him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Easy I got you.  Seekers?  But how? They&#39;re out scouting the \n&gt;&gt; parameters, I\n&gt;&gt; saw them myself.  Something is very wrong here. Leo Prime, it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; definitely\n&gt;&gt; not Hydras and I&#39;m almost certain a greater evil is at play here.  I \n&gt;&gt; suggest\n&gt;&gt; we send rescue efforts to the Fuzors immediately. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; matter of who, it&#39;s a matter of what is causing such chaos.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He looks to Hydras.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You haven&#39;t deployed any seekers have you?  If you gave that order to \n&gt;&gt; attack\n&gt;&gt; the Fuzors our alliance ends here.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He scowls at Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW – NOCTORRO&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Fuzor coughed as he relaxed TUSCON supported him. “There were\n&gt; three of them. Seekers. They detected as Minion but we had never seen\n&gt; them before . . . “ He coughed again. “We were ambushed . . .\n&gt; Silverbolt and Bantor went down, Torca sent me to get to you. I don’t\n&gt; know what has happened.”\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; “I respected our truce, Prime”Hissed Hydras offended” I know that this is\n&gt;&gt; one of those ocations that it isnt convenient attack, and as proof of \n&gt;&gt; good\n&gt;&gt; faith, Cyclonus and waspanetor, could help you to repair the Fuzors... ”\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then he opened his comlink asn said “To all predacons and decepticons,\n&gt;&gt; Inform!”\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson nods.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Right, that proves you had nothing to do with the attack on the Fuzors.\n&gt;&gt; Good, we&#39;re still on the same page, Hydras.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - TALON&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon looked around and said nervous &quot;What&#39;s goin on?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Hydras opened a comlink to all his forces &quot;Be careful, Seekers are\n&gt;&gt; aroundif\n&gt;&gt;  you see them open fire. Scourge what is goin on there?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; HYDRAS got call back from various Predacons all telling him basically\n&gt; they were flying over the area where the dead dinosaurs used to lay,\n&gt; making sure that there was nothing around. The last of them were\n&gt; clearing away and that the breezes were carrying the last bit of the\n&gt; carcasses away. None of them report any seeker activity,\n&gt;\n&gt; From SCOURGE there was a message, “Dark Rodimus is back. I don’t know\n&gt; how.” There was a pause, “But he smells different.”\n&gt;\n&gt; There was no answer from CYCLONUS\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Then Hydras send a com link back to Cryotek, that was highly encoded\n&gt;&gt; &quot;What&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;  wrong?? what&#39;s goin on?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW - CRYOTEK&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; CRYOTEK paused and then answered, “It would seem that we will have to\n&gt; work together after all.” There was another pause and then he\n&gt; continued, “A group of seekers, a trio of them appeared and ransacked\n&gt; my base, killed my men and left.”\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
