Hidden One \nbegins to takes off of the planet in a relatively silent launch.\n\nSoundwave watches the other DED members lose intrest in him, and he \nsneaks off to the pod that the Council wants him to bring aboard. \n&lt;&lt;This will be tricky...&gt;&gt; he thinks to himself, &lt;&lt;Here we go...&gt;&gt; He \nwatches carefully, and then wheels the pot towards the ship&#39;s storage \nbay, when the others aren&#39;t looking. He then loads it on, and \nproceeds to cover it up. He hops out of the storage, and joins the \ngroup as silently as he had left. &quot;DED, are we leaving? Radar shows \nthat the Autobots are on the move.&quot; \n\nOOC: Hurry up Jer, DED must leave soon! =)\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Pacifix / JetV ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix gets onboard the ship, and heads towards the control room.\n&gt; \n&gt; JetV is there, and raring to go, &quot;Pacifix, our engines are primed \nand \n&gt; we are ready to go go go.&quot; JetV smiles in anticipation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix nods his approval, and speaks the word, &quot;Fly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Tomorrow, when I&#39;m not sleeping at the keyboard, I&#39;ll finish \n&gt; this. =P\n\n\n"}}
