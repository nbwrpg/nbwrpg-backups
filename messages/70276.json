The =\r\ncompassion for a comrade has far out powered my better judgement for surviv=\r\nal. I can not deny what my heart spark tells me. And it has told me that th=\r\nere is no greater power than that which is held by all Autobots and Maximal=\r\ns a like. Rat Trap, I hear you too, I know this is upsetting you greatly, a=\r\nnd if you had not extended your own heart spark to help me the first time, =\r\nI would not have made it this far. All of you who worry for me, take heart,=\r\n I&#39;ve been through worse. And please, understand that I failed Rodimus once=\r\n, I will not fail him a second time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot; Lord elder responded ba=\r\nck. &quot;But if I were attempting to\ndo the same thing that you were doing, wha=\r\nt would you be saying.&quot; He\nsighed, knowing that even as he spoke that Tusco=\r\nn had already gone on\nanyway.\n\n&gt; &quot; By the Matrix.. Lord Elder, Legacy, Perc=\r\neptor, I&#39;ve got my vision back. I can now see everything around me clearly.=\r\n Now, I can also hear Rodimus on the other end. I&#39;m attempting to get throu=\r\ngh the rubble, but it may take a moment or so to do it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As he continue=\r\ns to dig, he keeps an ear out for Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, if you can hear me=\r\n, I need you to follow my voice and dig through the rubble on your end, to =\r\nmeet up with me. I&#39;ve got my vision back and I am now fully capable of gett=\r\ning us both out of here safely. Please, respond.&quot;\n\nAs Tuscon dug and pushed=\r\n, the debris rumbled. As anyone knows, once\nthere has been a land slide, to=\r\n move the supporting debris only risks\nanother slide. The dirt and such tha=\r\nt Tuscon moves is light and sandy,\nhad he been a farmer, no doubt he would =\r\nhave realized that this\naccounts for much of the scrub that grew around thi=\r\ns area, the soil\nhad so little nutrients, built as it was on volcanic rock =\r\nbeneath.\n\nHowever when Tuscon was finally able to break through to the othe=\r\nr\nside there was no Rodimus to see or any of the other Decepticons for\nthat=\r\n matter: Cyclonus, Scourge, Scorponok and Jhiaxus were all absent.\nInstead =\r\nthere was only the opening of some large pit, perhaps 15 or 20\nfeet across =\r\nfrom which the smell of sulfur and other strange gasses\nrose.\n\nHad Tuscon r=\r\nead the old reports of Kup and Grimlock&#39;s tunneling\nexpedition while follow=\r\ning Scorponok, then he might connect that to\nthe pit he saw before him. It =\r\nran deep, its sides sloping down rather\nsharply, although the floor of it w=\r\nas exceedingly smooth. It was part\nof the original tunnel that led far unde=\r\nrground and in the direction\nof the Ark.\n\nPerhaps several hundred yards dow=\r\nn the tunnel/pit there was a dark\nform, something that MIGHT be Rodimus. Wh=\r\no or what ever it was it lay\ntotally unmoving, unresponsive to anything tha=\r\nt Tuscon has done so\nfar.\n\nBut then the sound of water could be heard as if=\r\n some small\nunderground dam had burst, and then steam began billowing up fr=\r\nom the\nhole obscuring sight. The last view Tuscon could see of the figure w=\r\nas\nthat it moved, as if pushed by something, and then it was totally lost\nf=\r\nrom sight.\n\n\nMeanwhile . . .\n\nWho: LEGACY, Rat Trap, Quickstride, Kup\nLocat=\r\nion: Area outside of the Black Fortress\n\n&gt; &quot; That&#39;s a good hope ta have Qui=\r\nckstride. We gotta believe in Tucson, guys. That&#39;s our greatest power, beli=\r\neve in our allies and our friends. Somethn&#39; Hydras doesn&#39;t usually practice=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift turns to Legacy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Belief is all we got gon&#39; for us =\r\nnow Legacy. We gotta hold onta that.&quot;\n\nLegacy paused as he listened to the =\r\nothers as his own sensors\ncontinued to scan the area.\n\n&quot;Belief is inconsequ=\r\nential if it cannot be supported by fact.&quot; Legacy\nsaid, ever the bot that w=\r\nas rooted in empirical logic. &quot;Historically\nOptimus Prime was renowned for =\r\nhis ability to act in unpredictable\nways and still emerge victorious, as wa=\r\ns Optimus Primal. However\nneither of them are still with us.&quot;\n\n&quot;I would sus=\r\npect that Tuscon is now motivated by the emotions of guilt\nand fear. Guilt =\r\nthat he has allowed Rodimus to left behind and fear\nthat he may be lost aga=\r\nin. Hardly the motivators that allow for the\noptimal success for his missio=\r\nn.&quot;\n\nLegacy transformed into robot mode, setting down anyone who may still\n=\r\nhave been riding inside of him. &quot;I would recommend that Talon or Rat\nTrap t=\r\nake the injured back to the ark in the shuttle and then the rest\nof us atte=\r\nmpt to locate Tuscon and Rodimus.&quot;\n\nLegacy&#39;s cold cyclopian gaze swept the =\r\ngroup as he spoke. &quot;We cannot\nknow the condition of the Predacons or Decept=\r\nicon, and if in his\ncurrent state that Tuscon has not pushed himself into a=\r\nnother\nsituation that it will be difficult to extricate himself from alone.=\r\n&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
