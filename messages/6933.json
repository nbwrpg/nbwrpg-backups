She was having difficulty with the \ncomputer.  The comp was acting like it was hit with some type of \nscrambler or something.  Then she heard a noise come fron inside the \nconsole.  she bent down and opened a panel to see inside.  She shined \na little light in the panel and saw a small rat chewing on the wires.\nShe smiled and picked up the rat.\n&quot;A rodent after my own spark.&quot; She smiled and put the small rat in a \nbucket and placed it next to her computer.  She started repairs.\n\nShe looked at the bucket, &quot;When I&#39;m done here my little friend, I&#39;ll \nmake you a nice big cage to stay in.  I can always use a friend here.&quot;\n\nShe went back to fixing the wires.\n\n\n"}}
