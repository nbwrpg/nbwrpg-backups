I have been awoken from his \ncontrol over me.  We cannot be scared of him. WE are strong, and must \nnot let him be our master.

He had never felt like \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; before.  After the shot from Megatron he had lost his programming \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; always be controlled by someone else. He was finally his own bot. \n&gt; And \n&gt; &gt; he was pissed.\n\n\n"}}
