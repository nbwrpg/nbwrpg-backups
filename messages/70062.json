He subspaces the missile chambers and powers down the w=\r\neaponry.  Night Shift also submits, and subspaces his own weaponry.\n\nThe ne=\r\nwly appointed Autobot leader still had much to learn, and he knew it.  He w=\r\nasn&#39;t perfect, it would take some time to be as knowledgable as Optimus Pri=\r\nme.  \n\n&quot;Everyone, I&#39;m sorry, I made a mistake.  They&#39;re right, I was off in=\r\n my tactics, so I am asking all of you to stand down and do as told.  I wil=\r\nl not risk anyone elses lives here this day.  Jhiaxus, you have my word.  A=\r\nll weapons are powered down and we will abide by Hydras&#39; commands.&quot;\n\nNight =\r\nShift was not angry at his leader.  He looks to him sincerely.\n\n&quot;Ya know, a=\r\ndmittn&#39; that you&#39;re wrong like that, that takes a lotta courage sir.&quot;\n\nTucs=\r\non Prime sighs.\n\n&quot; Thank you.  I&#39;m only doing what I feel is best for every=\r\none&#39;s saftey.&quot;\n\nNight Shift looks over at Rodimus  his eyes narrow.\n\n&quot; Ya k=\r\nnow, Tucson Prime wouldn&#39;tve made this effort for just anyone.  He&#39;s risked=\r\n his spark ta try&#39;n get ya back.  That&#39;s right, he didn&#39;t come here for som=\r\ne half baked power trip, he came back here because he really cares about yo=\r\nu.  The least you can do, is return the favor&#39;n make some sorta effort ta c=\r\nome around&#39;n try and remember who you are, and what you stand for.  Because=\r\n right now, I&#39;m just gonna have ta call ya Hot Rod.  There ain&#39;t no Prime i=\r\nn there that I can see.  Nope, not at all. Not one trace.  There, I said my=\r\n peace, and now I&#39;m gonna do as told.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime does nothing to rebel =\r\nagainst orders.  Yet, he listens to Night Shift carefully.\n\n&quot; All right Hyd=\r\nras, ball is in your court.  I will comply to your demands as you wish.&quot;\n\n-=\r\n-- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nightlight:\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\nightlight gasped in terror\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Preston Carroll \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, =\r\nApril 13, 2010 11:32 AM\n&gt; To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: Re: BlackF=\r\nortress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Who: SCOURGE, SCORPONOK, Hydras, Darkhawk, Perceptor, =\r\nNightshift,\n&gt; Tuscon Prime, Kup, Rodimus, Nightlight\n&gt; Location: Black Fort=\r\nress - Throne Room\n&gt; \n&gt; Scourge, who had never been affected by the disrupt=\r\nor wave from\n&gt; Tuscon, quite probrably because he is of minion design rathe=\r\nr then\n&gt; just decepticon, just watched, unsure of what to do.
