Suddenly a dull pain began to radiate through her \nstomach. It was barely noticable, but still, it shouldn&#39;t be there. Dinobot \nhad made sure of that. No matter, she would worry about it later:\n\n&quot;Dinobot, are you alright?&quot; Tavatron placed her other hand against Dinobot&#39;s \nclenched fist. The pain in her stomach had intensified, but it was not of \nany importance. She would survive. Tavatron heard Iron over her com:\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get back to the ark.&quot; Tavatron shouldered her staff, all the \nwhile keeping a concerned hand on Dinobot&#39;s shoulder. It was obvious he was \nin pain, but why didn&#39;t he say something?\n\nTavatron placed her other hand on her stomach. What was wrong with it? It \nshouldn&#39;t hurt. Her internal comp said that her systems were at full power, \nso why did it hurt? No matter, it was only a dull pain, nothing important.\n\n(OOC: Sorry if I missed any important posts or anything, I&#39;m really tired \nand kinda out of it. If there&#39;s anything that concerns Tav that I failed to \nreply to please let me know. Thanx!)\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
