No fighting without her was her own rule. She \ndid \n&gt; look back at Blackfang and grin a bit.

If we harness enough energy, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; we catch him off guard, we could shove him back through the \nrift.  \n&gt; &gt; Then all we would have to do is seal the instablility.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was worked up, the plan would work... if a few things \nhappened \n&gt; &gt; right.  One, securing a large enough energy supply for Malice, \ntwo, \n&gt; &gt; a way to get energy to Malice, and three, get energy from said \n&gt; &gt; bounty hunter to the repulser.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Please!
