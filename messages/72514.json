Since clearly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we cannot trust Maximal honor=\r\n from a leader whom has no qualms about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; permitting his own=\r\n personal troops to do as they wish and threaten a parlay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nhe himself invited. So, you wish our cooperation, pay our hand for it or go=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in on your own.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There was a sound somewhere between a lion=92s ro=\r\nar and a growl that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; erupted from LEO PRIME=92s mouth as he tra=\r\nnsformed from beast mode back&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to his robotic seemingly in mids=\r\ntride.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =93Who is threatening our truce?=94 LEO P=\r\nRIME said as he stepped up&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; towards the group of MAXIMALS and P=\r\nREDACONS, his optics glancing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; across each one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; LEO=92s optics came to a stop on DINOBOT, =93No, we will not be=\r\n giving you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; any kind of spark. You and your teammates are in a=\r\ns much danger from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this as we are and we are going to have to =\r\npull this together if we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are going to make this work we don=92=\r\nt have time for games.=94&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Stepping back LEO PRIM=\r\nE gestured at DINOBOT pointing at the path&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; leading away from t=\r\nhe group, =93But if you want to leave, you are more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than welco=\r\nme, but do not come crawling to us with your tail between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your=\r\n legs later, this is bigger than all of us.=94&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=93ALL OF US!=94 LEO said again as he glanced at the others again. His&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; voice and tone was emphatic, =93But if anyone wants to stay and tr=\r\ny to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; work this out, then anyone who tries and break this truce=\r\n they will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; answer to *me*=94 LEO was in full command mode, his=\r\n face calm and yet&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his tone firm and authoritative no matter w=\r\nho his optics fell on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; MAXIMAL or PREDACON.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Yup, LEO is trying to hold this thing together, even if he did not&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; agree to it in the first place. Now it was their only shot. DI=\r\nNOBOT&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was free to leave as was anyone who chose.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The choice was theirs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On 1=\r\n0/25/11, adamsafran &lt;adamsafran@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &l=\r\nt;OLD&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There is=\r\n a watchful smile from AIRHAMMER as he watched the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; con=\r\nversation go back and forth. He is not the long winded sort, and so&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; stays largely quiet in all of this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ahh yes, you were a Maximal at one time weren&#39;t you?&quot; BA=\r\nNTOR said to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the new and improved DINOBOT, &quot;First Pred=\r\nacon, then Maximal and now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Predacon again?&quot; He said as=\r\n he tilted his head in DINBOT&#39;s direction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;You seemed=\r\n to have had an upgrade or two.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n BANTOR gestured at DINOBOT&#39;s frame, &quot;You look more like the old&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; Megatron now, before he went all draconish.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile on the otherside of the clearing SKYSHADO=\r\nW was still looking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at HYDRAS awaiting his next words =\r\nand LEO was standing towards the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; middle of the clearin=\r\ng, a growing sense of agitation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n WINGCALIBER, TORCA and SANTON were standing next to him, waiting on&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&gt; the small sidebar conference to end while NOCTORRO was pacin=\r\ng around,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; obviously letting his own sense of impatienc=\r\ne get the better of him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tha=\r\nt erupted in a laugh over from DINOBOT, &quot;Oh, yes. One member of your&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; team whom got a teammate killed, and another for whom is directl=\r\ny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; threatening the others. You seem to have an excellent ta=\r\nste in comrades,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; CONVOY.&quot; Hissing over at the MAXIMALS.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Regardless, make up your mind? What will =\r\nit be, Maximals? Will you be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; threatening us for every sing=\r\nle word exchanged and threatening to assault us&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; while out =\r\nof the other end of your vocalizer saying you need our help? If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; you wish our assistance, decide what it will be. That requires you to=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; eitehr cooperate with us and make a good show or you can =\r\ngo into the jungle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on your own.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; DINOBOT was baiting, attempting to drive a wedge between the MAXI=\r\nMALS to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; either force LEO PRIME to discipline them and unde=\r\nrmine his authority, or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; letting them go on which would pro=\r\nbably lead to greater and greater tension&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in the field, an=\r\nd would give the PREDACONS more changes for disruption&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sho=\r\nuld they find a way to abandon the MAXIMALS. Or to get LEO PRIME to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; admit more of what was going on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; Finally, DINOBOT went to up the escalation, taking over the cue of&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; negotiation from HYDRAS. &quot;And for our cooperation in this we ha=\r\nve a price.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A stasis pod with an intact protoform and a sp=\r\nark. There will be no basis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for negotiation otherwise. It =\r\nwould have been free given the necessity,b&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ut given your t=\r\nroops have not even entered the combat zone and are pointing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; fully armed weapons at us and threatening assault when we have given no&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; threat ourselves, there is now a price for our cooperation=\r\n. Since clearly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we cannot trust Maximal honor from a leade=\r\nr whom has no qualms about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; permitting his own personal tro=\r\nops to do as they wish and threaten a parlay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he himself in=\r\nvited. So, you wish our cooperation, pay our hand for it or go&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; in on your own.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OOC - Anyways, Hyd=\r\nras/Leo Prime, this is DINOBOT taking a cue to try and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dri=\r\nve a wedge further into the Maximals and Leo Prime&#39;s authority, given&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; they&#39;re giving him a rather significant opening, and given his =\r\ndata files&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; over on them. He&#39;s going to try and bait them d=\r\nirectly to either disrupt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things for further chaos later. =\r\nIT&#39;s a more subtle and Predacon thing to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do, so I&#39;ll let y=\r\nou decide where to run with it. And Hydras, request you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; le=\r\nt DINOBOT play it out then given you would probably trust him in this and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it humilaites the Maximals as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
