Her \nbody twitched and moved while her programs started to correct \nthemselves.  Her memory chip, while still damaged, went though and re-\nuploaded her training programs.  When she awoke, she would remember \nher techo-organic enginering abilities and programming skills.  She \nwould remember her repair skills as well.  But the other half of her \nmemory, who she was, why she was there, what faction she belonged to, \nwould still be missing.  Her body stopped twitching and stayed still.\n\n\n"}}
