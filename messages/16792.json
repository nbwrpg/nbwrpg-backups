Tarantulas had constructed \ncollars to which he could enduce sever pain to the Maximal slaves, thus \nforceing them to do the bidding of the Predacons. At that moment, they were \nmustering around the holding chamber of Megatron. Tarantulas was having that \nroomec cleared for more computer space. The job was very difficult, \nconsidering that most of the stuff in there was old heavey junk.\n    &quot;Damn it....this is rediculous! I cant belive no one has tried to save \nus.&quot; Aquarious, the dolphin, complained as he lifted a pile of scrap and \nmoved it into the garbage shute.\n    Night Eyes, there unofficial leader snaped back at him, &quot;Listen, no one \neven knows we exsist. If anyone is going to save us, its going to be \nourselfs. And this is the perfect oppertuninty to do it.&quot; She said looking \naround showing them that they were alone, except for that weird tube in the \nmiddle of the room.\n    &quot;Shes right. We have to get out of here.....and get these collars off. \nKeep a look out while I try to fine something to pry them off.&quot; Paddle tail \nsaid. He was a smart engineer and would get them off somehow.\n    Aquarious looked to see if anyone was coming and then gazed up at the \ntube. It was dark, but what fasinated him was what was hiding inside of it. \nHe reached out and touch the control panel. Immedietly, the tube light up and \ninside hung a sleeping Megatron.\n    &quot;By the matrix....look!&quot; He cried pointing up at the purple tyrant, just \nas he awoke to the new light inside his internment tube.\n    The other gazed up, as well, and were just a s shocked. The Maximals \ngathered around the tube trying to figure out who it was...\n    &quot;What the hell are you all stareing at?!?!&quot; Megatron roared in fistration \nas he remembered he had no arms or legs. Then a thought hit him, and he oozed \nout his devilish charm. &quot;Are you prisoners too? These crule Predacons \ncaptured me as well....and are experimenting on me.&quot;\n    Night Eyes stepped forward, &quot;Your a prisoner too? Well, I guess it must \nbe your lucky day. Were escaping today. We&#39;ll take you with us!&quot;\n    Megatron smiled. &quot;Raise the tube, and inside that crate you will find my \nlimbs. Hurry, before someone comes.&quot; He said excited because he just found \nthree new idiots to follow him.\n    The Maximals did as they were told and freed Megatron. He flexed his \narms, now that they were attached, and stood tall on his legs. Paddle Tail \nproved correct and freed them from the collars.\n    Megatron turned to look down on them. &quot;Before we go, we must get some \none....Inferno. he is my...um....luitenent. They brain washed him and we must \nfree him. Come along and arm yourself. This is going to be tricky.&quot; He said \nand then opened up the door to reveal the corridor.\n\n"}}
