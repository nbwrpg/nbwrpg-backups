It sure didn&#39;t work for \n&gt; &gt; Megatron.&quot;  She&#39;s teasing again. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your termination is only an option. Though I have orders, does it \nmake sense \n&gt; other than one&#39;s revenge?&quot; She only gazed out. &quot;Besides, if there \nis some \n&gt; reason for my being here, then all the loyal Decepticons will be \nneeded.&quot; \n&gt; Then smirking, as she faced Empath. &quot;Well.. Talking you to bordom & \nceasing \n&gt; to function could be an option. Though I am sure I am far better to \nlisten to \n&gt; than Starscream.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t intend to betray Hydras. If he uses me, then \nso be it. \n&gt; Let him try. His plans are obviously of revenge. There is too much \nof \n&gt; Galvatron in him.&quot; Pausing a moment. &quot;Yes, it tears me apart to \nthink that \n&gt; Hydras is both our Leader & yet not our Leader.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You know, I could probably get \n&gt; &gt; Wheeljack to short your emotion chips if you wanted.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No need, Empath. Soon enough, I shall have rid myself of this \nTechno organic \n&gt; form & regained my old form.&quot; Her optics sparkled. &quot;They will all \nsoon know \n&gt; the meaning of Decepticon might.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; She turned to Empath, facing her. &quot;Join me, Empath. To return to \nthe glory & \n&gt; splendor of what we once were. Hydras can have his Predacon \nwannabes. WE \n&gt; shall resurrect the Decepticons!&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; She wasn&#39;t sure if Empath would accept, probably not. In any case, \nMaxima \n&gt; would be alone in her quest. & her feelings for Hydras would \ncontinue as she \n&gt; saw fit.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Empath states.  &quot;I have my own revenge to take care of \nfirst - I&#39;ll consider your plan AFTER Hydras is dead.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
