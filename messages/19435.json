He looks back up as she covers \nthem by folding her arms, his gaze locking on the machine&#39;s screen as \nhe thinks over her words. He&#39;d have to watch her.\n\n&quot;Hmm,&quot; he says, glancing at her, not acting any different than he was \nbefore he noticed the cuffs, or at least not showing outside, &quot;I \nfound it better to make a small chip and plug it into their head. \nEasier that way, all the neural connections are closer. Mine warped \nthe bot&#39;s mind untill they wanted to do as I say, but most of the \nbots on this planet are far too advanced for the old design.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Diamond::\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked at her wrists.  She still had her old cuffs on.\n&gt; She walked over to the wall and leaned against it. She folded her \n&gt; arms to cover her wrists. &quot;Well, the cuffs would not only control \nthe \n&gt; bot, but relay all actions that the bot did to the council. It \n&gt; constantly monitored the bot&#39;s movements as well as it&#39;s thoughts.  \n&gt; The one who had the main controlling computer could control the the \n&gt; bot totally. The bot&#39;s mind, actions,feelings, everything.&quot; She \n&gt; looked down and sighed.  &quot;Those things aren&#39;t what I would call a \n&gt; good thing. They can do strange things to a bots mind if left to \n&gt; control the bot to long.&quot; \n\n\n"}}
