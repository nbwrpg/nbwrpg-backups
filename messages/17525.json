We may be out numbered by the time we get there. \nAnd Starscream is planning on attacking them solo.

She looked out towards the open \nfield and started screaming. &quot;OH NO! DON&#39;T PLEASE! OH MATRIX NOOO!&quot; \nShe tried to struggle and had a look of sheer terror on her \nface. &quot;PLEASE&lt; DON&quot;T SHOOT ME! NO PLEASE!&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Starscream\n&gt; \n&gt; Starscream hid himself as the bots landed. He looked at them. From \n&gt; his studies he knew that the red one was Inferno, but the \n&gt; others....they were like him, but blue. He whispered a message in a \n&gt; secret frequency.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Phobia? KitKat? Anyone? It&#39;s Starscream. I&#39;m at the ruins. Inferno \n&gt; is here, probably planning an ambush. But he&#39;s brought 5 other \n&gt; people, who look exactly like him except they are blue. Almost \n&gt; like.....clones. My God! If Megatron has mastered cloning \ntechnology, \n&gt; he will have a never ending army! Please hurry. The Lavacons and I \n&gt; will engage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He quietly walked over to the Lavacons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Soldiers! Your time has come! Those 6 bots over there are servants \n&gt; of the Enemey. We must engage them!&quot; Starscream waited for the \n&gt; Lavacons to arouse.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Vulois\n&gt; \n&gt; Vulois came out of stasis lock for a second, noticing that he was \n&gt; moving. He was still very groggy though.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where am I....&quot; But before he could get a clear picture, he went \n&gt; back to stasis, his head wires still frazzeled.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Brix/Fliq\n&gt; \n&gt; Brix and Fliq heard what Ramulus said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What? You mean we might not even fight? This sucks.&quot; They laughed \nas \n&gt; they continued walking in cloak. They walked a bit with Ramulus and \n&gt; than turned off track to join Snowcat so that the Trainers couldn&#39;t \n&gt; smell anything.\n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; Prebon laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent Slayer. First clear shot you get, take him out. If you \ndo \n&gt; this succesfully, you will get a large reward.&quot; He turned to \nSpears, \n&gt; pulling out his blaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to have this to your head during the process. The safety \n&gt; is on, so it won&#39;t fire. Just keep your coll and scream your head \n&gt; off.&quot; Prebon laughed at how dumb that sounded. He opened a comm to \n&gt; Hammer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Are you all in place?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yes sir. If we here gun fire than we&#39;ll be there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent. Their&#39;s me, and you Spears, and Slayer, and the other \n&gt; four Trainers, and Savage. That&#39;s 8. Their is no way they could&#39;ve \n&gt; gotten a force larger than 8 in the short time they had.&quot; He \ngrabbed \n&gt; Spears&#39; arm and put the gun to her head, waiting for the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Everything will be all right,&quot; He whispered to her, kissing her \n&gt; cheek.\n\n\n"}}
