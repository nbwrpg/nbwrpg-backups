Airbomber stepped backwards and fired at\nthe missile. Nothing happened. Airbomber was afraid of that. The missile\nexploded right above his head even though he ducked, singing him pretty bad.\nDeemos was stuck by most of the 25 shots, but being that they were rapid\nfire shots, he wasn&#39;t damaged enough to worry about it. Stranato suddenly\nflipped head over heels and landed on his feet, avoiding everything.\n\nStranato: Not beaten down yet.\n\nTrain Wreck kept driving straight through the shots and heading towards\nTermitron, still.\n\nAirbomber: You cannot stop superiority.\n\nAirbomber was hurt but hid it well. Arrow sees Train Wreck on a collision\ncourse with Termitron. *Time to prove I&#39;m with them* Arrow thought. He\nchanged to motorcycle mode and went screecing in front of Train Wreck,\nfiring away at him. Train Wreck saw the opportunity and rammed into Arrow,\nsending him flying. He aimed his cannon and fired it at Arrow 4 times,\nhitting each time. He kept heading towards Termitron. Airbomber pulled a\ngrenade and threw it at Arrow. Arrow transformed and started to stand up\nwearily.\n\nGrenade Timer: 3, 2, 1,\n\nArrow didn&#39;t notice the grenade...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;airly2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 12:31 AM\nSubject: Re: Chivitron Battle\n\n\n&gt; Termitron/Windlord:\n&gt;\n&gt; Termitron spat his acyd to the projectiles hoping destroy them.\n&gt; Windlord fired two missiles one agaisnt Deemos and other to Airbomber\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Soulstice Omega&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Airbomber wasn&#39;t stupid, though, and he was about to fire at the\n&gt; disks.\n&gt; &gt; Maybe he was stupid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos: No!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos ran and pushed Airbomber out of the way, the disks ended up\n&gt; exploding\n&gt; &gt; harmlessly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Airbomber: I had it right there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos: You would have been dead, Maximal!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deemos raised a blaster, it appeared to be a new one.
