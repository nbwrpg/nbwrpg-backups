At \nthis range, Ragnar could be ripped wide open by such a blast.  Fury \nwhirls his blade, waiting for another opening.\n\nMost of the fire impacts on Pumpskin&#39;s self-regenerating limbs, but \nBlackfang scores a solid body hit with his last shot - and this wound \ndoesn&#39;t close itself up right away, betraying the relative \nvulnerability of his torso.\n\n&quot;Hee hee, you&#39;re a perceptive one!&quot; Pumpskin chuckles as he flails in \nboth directions, looking to give each of them a two-tentacle hug.  \nAll four appendages stretch out to their maximum length again.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ragnar sidestepped and avoided the knife, but Riekan fell down hard \non \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ragnar muttered: Honorless fools...\n&gt; \n&gt; He fired his autocannon on the bot right on top of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Katya jerked backward as the metal foot caught her. She regained \n&gt; enough to fire her large laser.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang took his shotgun and aimed. He fired four blasts at the \n&gt; pumpkin abomination. But then, he realized that it bore the Maximal \n&gt; insignia and a unit designation he seemed to remember.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Shit! You&#39;re a member of the Maximal Iron Squad!\n\n\n"}}
