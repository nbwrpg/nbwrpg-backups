But thank the pit that she wasn�t able to \nbe detected.\nBrightBlade looked back towards Chordate and began to walk towards him, her \nsteps silent as she approached the Maximal.\nShe gave the Alliance bot a signal with her hand not to shoot, taking a \nsmall contained from her leg compartment.\nIt was the same device that had taken out rex, only she was going to get it \ndirectly to this Maximal so that it wouldn�t affect Perndabot�she needed him \nstill.\nWith a growl she pulled the pin on the gas bomb and threw it right between \nChordates� legs. A clear gas hissing up into the air around the Maximal.\nIf all worked well it would make him go into stasis lock, fast and silent.\nBrightBlade looked towards the Alliance bot, taking another piece of \nequipment out of her leg.\nThe reflecting device that shielded her so well, but just another one.\nShe tossed to him.:\n\n� On the cloaking device, quickly.�\n\n: BrightBlade then looked towards Chordate again.:\n\n� We have much to do��\n\n\n\nRage:\n\n: She watched through the shield of leavs ahead of her, her prey in her \nsight.\nher longer front limbs supporting her great weight as she stalked through \nthe forest growth, relying on surprise.\nRages bulk couldn&#39;t easily be hidden, thus, she was forced to stalk the best \nshe could and then just strike.\nHer prey, a forest buck.\nBut there was the close smell of metal that clouded her senses sometimes \nnow, the scent familiar but her mind still dwelling on her prey.\nSuddenly, the male deers head snapped up, looking around a bit to locate a \ndistant sound it had heard.\nRages muscles bunched under her great bulk for a body as she saw it raise \nits head, her mind knowing that her meal could bolt any moment.\nAnd just as suddenly as the deer had looked up, it raised it&#39;s tail in \nwarning and bounded off into the forest shadows.\nRage snarled and raised to her muscled hind legs, the trees and bushes \ngiving way as she gave chase to her prey.\nThe buck fled in panic but the great monsters hunger was to strong this \ntime, and in the end she would be triumphant.\n\nThe buck burst from the cover of the forest, not knowing that it had entered \ninto the clearing where the Alliance base stood, it&#39;s panic blinding it.\nBut then it slowed, it&#39;s sides heaving and trying to take in enough breath \nto fuel it&#39;s quickly beating heart.\nNow in the center of the clearing, there was nothing which followed.\nThe buck looked around, only seeing the line of trees and the large metal \nthing a bit off to the left.\nThe deer relaxed and began to move off towards the other side of the forest, \nit&#39;s senses still open and aware of everything around it.\nBut even that didn&#39;t save it.\n\nA pair of huge jaws burst from the forest and into the clearing, easily \nclearing the space between her and the buck in two strides.\nThe buck didn&#39;t even have enough time to take another breath before massive \njaws closed around it&#39;s middle, snapping down and splitting the animal in \nhalf with a sprey of warm blood and meat.\n\nRage lifted her head from what was left of the buck, her jaws dripping with \nthe warm blood of her kill.\nThis was turning out to be a good day for her.\nShe looked over and saw what she had been smelling while stalking this deer, \na large ship but one that she had never seen before.\nBut then she looked down at the gutted buck and roared before digging her \njaws into the meat, taring off chunks of flesh.\nThough, a animal this side would be nothing more then a snack.:\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
