She went to\n&gt;the lab and looked around.  She saw the viles that had the mind\n&gt;numbing liquid in it.  She had used it on Dracona.  It would do the\n&gt;same for Quickstrike.  It would stop the pain and hopefully make him\n&gt;feel better.  She grabbed a vile and a needle.  She filled the needle\n&gt;and walked over to Quickstrike.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I have something that might take away the pain.&quot; she looked at him\n&gt;and wanted to help him.\n&gt;&quot;Please let me give this to you.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
