It was actually a welcomed development, as he had=\r\n become quite accustomed to being sightless.  He could hear and sense thing=\r\ns with much more clarity then he was able to sense with even with his optic=\r\ns. His transmitter kicks in as a sonar system once more.  It had been progr=\r\named as such, but now, only used as a listening device.  It gives him infor=\r\nmation about his surroundings and with his thermal sensory board, he gets a=\r\n general idea on what the room is like.  Room enough for only one bot.  It =\r\nwas hot, but being silver in color, he&#39;s able to deflect a good portion of =\r\nthat heat away from his body.  Yet, he remains placid to avoid overheating.=\r\n  He knew that fighting would only make things worse for his systems.  Inst=\r\nead of giving a show of protest, he decides to get himself in a near medita=\r\ntive state, relaxing his entire body so is not to cause strain on his syste=\r\nm.  He had learned quite a bit about meditation from Ninjabot training, and=\r\n found it rather beneficial when encountered in times of great stress.  He =\r\ncould hear things outside, and realized he had contact ability with Rodimus=\r\n.  All the while, even though he didn&#39;t show signs of strategizing, he sile=\r\nntly assembles a plan to himself as to how he was going to get out of his n=\r\next predicament.  Phase one was already in place.  It was time for phase tw=\r\no.  Getting captured was not part of the plan at first, but then in all res=\r\npects he could see the advantages of being caught.  He had close contact wi=\r\nth Rodimus and this was a perfect opportunity to turn things around without=\r\n really raising suspicions.  As soon as he had something in mind, he casual=\r\nly turns his head in Rodimus&#39;s direction, following the mild sonar signal h=\r\ne bounces off, which hones in on Rodimus without actually having any effect=\r\ns on anyone.  \n\n&quot;Tell me Rodimus, have you ever once been appreciated for a=\r\nll the effort you&#39;ve given to Hydras?  From the sounds of things I don&#39;t th=\r\nink you&#39;re even recognized for your attributes.&quot;\n\nIn Night Shift&#39;s cell, Ni=\r\nght Shift also uses a very meditative state, to avoid getting himself overh=\r\neated.  He had learned that in tight situations, meditation was the best me=\r\ndicine. After a few moments of meditation, he casually looks around.  The m=\r\nore relaxed his body was, the less stress he places on his system.  And the=\r\n less stress he puts on his system, the less he felt tortured.  \n\n&quot;Not exac=\r\ntly my type of architecture but at least we&#39;re gettn&#39; some energon down her=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nHe grins to himself.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, the less agression we show the mo=\r\nre frustrated our guards will be.  These guys expect us ta put up a fuss, y=\r\neah, well, I ain&#39;t gonna buy inta that.  And I know Tucson Prime ain&#39;t eith=\r\ner.  I just hope Kup catches onta this&#39;n does the same... Poor guy, I don&#39;t=\r\n wanna see him get overheated.&quot;\n\nOutside the fortress, Rat Trap spots the o=\r\nncomming objects, and holds on tight to Quickstride&#39;s mane.\n\n&quot;We got tailga=\r\nters!&quot;\n\nQuickstride quickens his gallop and tries to step it up. At the sam=\r\ne time, his stomach rumbles, as it feels as if it&#39;s getting just a bit bloa=\r\nted.  He had overdosed on the bean pods, and now his system was about to pa=\r\ny for it.  \n\n&quot; Uh ohh..  Rat trap, Umm.. You - better cover your nose.&quot;\n\nRa=\r\nt Trap looks down to him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m tryn&#39; ta hold on for dear life here!  Why&#39;d=\r\nya want me ta do that for?!&quot;\n\nQuickstride&#39;s hooves almost appear not to tou=\r\nch the ground as he really accelerates in his gallop.\n\n&quot; Because in a fract=\r\nion of a nanosecond, things are NOT going to smell too good around here.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRat Trap does as told.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re right, that ain&#39;t such a bad idea!&quot;\n\nNo soo=\r\nner does he cover his nose, Quickstride releases a large cloud of noxious f=\r\numes from his tail end which aleviates his bloat, enabling him to pick up h=\r\nis pace.  A green cloud wafts upward.\n\nOOC: The bean pods I&#39;m reffering to =\r\nwere in Beast Wars, and had this effect on Rhinox who ate a considerable am=\r\nount of these gassy pods in a particularly funny episode.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: CYCLONUS=\r\n, Nightlight\n&gt; Location: Black Fortress - Throne Room\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;That&#39;s Great&quot;=\r\nhissed the male by comlink&quot;As soon as they arrive pass them to\n&gt; &gt; the thro=\r\nne Room, When i finsh here I&#39;l go there&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot; Cyclonus said. =\r\nWith a few deft touches Cyclonus sent off\n&gt; a few orders as he glanced up a=\r\nnd looked at the female as she sat on\n&gt; the stairs in front of the throne.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Greetings.&quot; he said to the female as he walked over to her. &quot;I know\n&gt;=\r\n that this has been a trying time for you.&quot; Cyclonus said, his voice\n&gt; and =\r\nmovements elegant, strong and yet graceful. Cyclonus stood tall\n&gt; and robus=\r\nt, his armor shined purple and white, glinting slightly in\n&gt; the relfected =\r\nlight of the room. He was like a powerful knight of some\n&gt; great reknowned =\r\nspeaking to a fair princesses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cyclonus folded one hand behind his bac=\r\nk as he reached down with\n&gt; other, bowing his head slightly in an almost co=\r\nurtly gesture. His\n&gt; fingers were strong yet somehow gentle as sought to gr=\r\nasp the Lady&#39;s\n&gt; hand and help her to her feet. Tilting his head up and to =\r\nthe side\n&gt; slightly Cyclonus looked at her, his penatrating gaze staring in=\r\nto\n&gt; hers, &quot;What is your name?&quot; he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
