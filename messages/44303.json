The raptor had sized up the dragons and\nknew that to win he&#39;d have to fight up close so that weapons other than body\nparts would be ineffective. He&#39;d anticipated that the two opponents would\nlead with thier teeth he just underestimated thier speed. he tried to roll\nto the side and slash Attilla as he went passed.
