A fear she had never known in her entire life.  She was happy tha=\r\nt she had someone riding in front with her, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly an Au=\r\ntobot or Maximal.  More and more, she begins to cling to Perceptor.  Even T=\r\nucson could sense her rapidly beating heart spark.\n\n&quot; Straight Shot, are yo=\r\nu all right?&quot;\n\nShe clings more to Perceptor.\n\n&quot;No.  I&#39;m scared out of my sp=\r\nark.&quot;\n\nTucson could not deny the feelings he had now himself.\n\n&quot; Truthfully=\r\n, so am I.  So am I.&quot;\n\nQuickstride now leans over from the back of Tucson&#39;s=\r\n cab, in the back seat, and looks down to Perceptor.  He could tell that St=\r\nraight Shot was completely fear stricken, and something she normally did no=\r\nt display.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve never seen her this scared.  Well, one time I have.  Two=\r\n years ago, that nasty confrontation we had with the preds and the cons.  I=\r\nt was right after she saw Tucson get hit.... Wait a minute...  Tucson can&#39;t=\r\n remember who hit him...  But, she was there, inside him when it happened.&quot;=\r\n\n\nStraight Shot now rambles on about the incident two years ago.\n\n&quot; He neve=\r\nr saw it comming, a blast that would take him off line almost instantly.  B=\r\nut I did Perceptor, I saw it.  And there was no time ta take the wheel and =\r\ndrive Tucson out of danger to avoid it.  But I wish I did have the time bec=\r\nause if I did, he wouldn&#39;tve gone off line, gone blind, and we wouldn&#39;tve l=\r\nost Rodimus two years ago.  And now, it&#39;s happening all over again.&quot;  \n\nQui=\r\nckstride listens to Straight Shot and then looks to Perceptor.\n\n&quot; No doubt =\r\nshe&#39;s probably seen the bot who&#39;s guilty of striking Tucson down.&quot;  \n\nStrai=\r\nght Shot looks to everyone.  Courage returning somewhat.\n\n&quot;Yeah, I saw who =\r\ndid it.&quot;\n\nTucson Prime now turns his audio sensors to inside his cab.\n\n&quot;Str=\r\naight Shot?  You - saw who hit me?&quot;\n\nShe swallows hard and nodds yes.\n\n&quot;Yea=\r\nh, I did.  It was really hard to see who was up over us, but through the re=\r\nar view mirror in Tucson&#39;s cab, I saw who it was.  It happened so fast...  =\r\nCame out of nowhere... &quot;\n\nTucson was curious as to who had struck him, as h=\r\ne continues his fast drive through the tunnel.\n\n&quot; Who was it Straight Shot?=\r\n&quot;\n\nHer face stifens.\n\n&quot; Cyclonus.  He knows your blind spots and took advan=\r\ntage of them.  Yes Tucson, you were struck by a slag drinking Decepticon.&quot;\n=\r\n\nTucson&#39;s pace quickens in the tunnel.  New found rage builds within him.\n\n=\r\n&quot; Then as soon as we find Rodimus Prime, we will tell him who was responsib=\r\nle for the entire mess. And after that, I will PERSONALLY see to it that Cy=\r\nclonus gets what he rightfully deserves. Now, let&#39;s find Rodimus!&quot;\n\nHe turn=\r\ns on a honing signal, mixed with special sonar equipment, he tries to bounc=\r\ne harmless waves through the tunnel, attempting to pick up on the very allo=\r\ny Rodimus is made of, to get a solid idea of how far he was within the tunn=\r\nel.\n\n&quot; We&#39;re here Rodimus, we will not give up on you.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor/Talon\n&gt; \n&gt; talon went in=\r\nside tucson while Perceptor tunr on his audio devices  and said \n&gt; &quot;He shou=\r\nld better does, I would hate to have done all this thing for \n&gt; naught!! &quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt; From: &quot;Sandy&quot; =\r\n&lt;magicquartz@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, May 15, 2010 10:19 PM\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tucson had done his j=\r\nob successfully, and turns off his sonar emitter. \n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot taps P=\r\nerceptor on the shoulder as promised, to signal that \n&gt; &gt; Tucson had turned=\r\n off his sonar emitting device.

We aren&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; leaving Rodimus=\r\n behind.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot realizes that he&#39;s right, and watches the w=\r\nay ahead inside \n&gt; &gt; at the driver&#39;s side seat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; No, we can&#39;t.
