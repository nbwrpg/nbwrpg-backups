It is the year 2271, the\nthird Cybertronian war has just ended, the Decepticons have scattered to\nthe far reaches of the Univrese, their army in shambles, their leader\nmissing, and many of the Decepticon heroes, imprisoned. Their\nDescendants, the Predacons, and the Autobots Descendants, the Maximals,\nare now living in peace, trying to repair the dammage done, by their\nmillions of years of conflict, and repairing Cybertron is a long job.\nOver the busy Cybertronian Highways, two vehicles of importance can be\nnoticed. Neither of them are Cybertronian vehicles, they both look out\nof place on the highway, as they roar by other vehicles, and take a side\nroad only allowed to certain authorized personel. &quot;Whoa, slow down\nCliffjumper, your gonna crash dude.&quot; the porsh pleaded. \n\n&quot;No way Jazz, I don&#39;t want to be late for this.&quot; Cliffjumper said, as he\nsped up even more. They both arrived at a toll booth, and the security\ngate was in their way. They both screeched to a stop, and Cliffjumper\ntransformed, then quickly hopped towards the ID area. As he entered his\nID the gate lifted, and the porsh spe by, as Cliffjumper quickly ran\nunder, then transformed again, and picked up speed to catch up.\n\n"}}
