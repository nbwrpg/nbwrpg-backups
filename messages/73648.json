RODIMUS PRIMAL was holding a battle with several figures in\nstrange armored suits and carrying laser rifles. At the same time he\nwas slowly backing up towards a tunnel behind him.\n\nMeanwhile inside the tunnel PERCEPTOR was dragging a similarly\noutfitted figure as RODIMUS was fighting, but this one was\nunconscious.\n\nWINDLORD and RAT TRAP were entering the same tunnel, laser fire and\nthe stink of burning metal and debris in the air from the fire fight\nahead.\n\nAbout center of the tunnel PERCEPTOR, WINDLORD and RAT TRAP meet, each\ngoing in the other direction, two going to help RODIMUS and the last\ntrying to get out.\n\n&quot;Are you through yet?&quot; Came a fierce whisper to PERCEPTOR across the\ncomlinks. It would seem that communications worked -inside- the cave,\nthey just could not penetrate outside of it to reach the ark.\n\nPerhaps it was the minerals and such lining the rock.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
