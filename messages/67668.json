What a surprise!&quot; Big c=\r\nonvoy said, &quot;Hmm so that makes\n&gt; two leader-types to crash today&quot; A voice s=\r\naid, emerging from a bush,\n&gt; it was Chomp, the Triceratops transformer, in =\r\nhis robot mode... &quot;Who\n&gt; you callin&#39; leader type kid?&quot; Big convoy said argu=\r\ning his role as a\n&gt; Convoy... then Lio Convoy said, &quot;Heh, some things never=\r\n change... by\n&gt; the way, who are you?&quot; &quot;Beast mode!&quot; Chomp said transformin=\r\ng, &quot;You can\n&gt; call me Chomp...&quot; The two convoys stared at each other as if =\r\nChomp had\n&gt; said something weird... &quot;What? it&#39;s a nice name, it fits me, as=\r\n seeing\n&gt; as how I like food and enegeron alot...&quot; He said as he started to=\r\n eat\n&gt; the bush he emerged from... the two convoys just laughed... \n&gt;    Me=\r\nanwhile a good distance away but not too far away to spy on them,\n&gt; Terry w=\r\nas spying on them, waiting for the right moment &quot;Laugh while\n&gt; you can fool=\r\ns!

How observant!&quot; Terry said firing again, \n=\r\n    &quot;Terry! since when were you a predicon?!&quot; Chomp exclaimed, as if\nthey k=\r\nnew each other, while doging &quot;Hehehehe, you mean you haven&#39;t yet\nfigured it=\r\n out? I was always a Predicon, Hehehe...&quot; This time big\nconvoy fired his bi=\r\ng cannon at the same time and the two beams clashed\nin an energy struggle..=\r\n. &quot;Woah he&#39;s stronger than I expected...&quot; Big\nconvoy said, &quot;And you are wea=\r\nker than /I/ expected&quot; Terry replied...\n   &quot;You can&#39;t out gun him Big, you =\r\nneed to out maneuver or outsmart\nhim&quot; Just as chop had begun to say this, L=\r\nio convoy had snuck up\nbehind Terry (Big and Terry are still in the beam st=\r\nruggle) and fired\nhis paw-mounted cannons, and Terry went flying... until h=\r\ne was just a\nstar-shaped object in the distance, &quot;Looks like Terry is blast=\r\ning off\nfor the first time heh&quot; Chomp remarked...\n\n\n"}}
