Striker was my friend. I will \nhave Slayers head.&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure just how he&#39;d find them but he was \nsure that Slayer would stain his claws once again.\n\n\n\nVeratis studied the CR Chamber results since Lunarpines return. There \nwas DNA on Lunarpines claws that didn&#39;t belong to him. From the looks \nof things it was another wolf.(Slayer) Now Veratis had DNA from three \ndifferent wolves. He wondered what would happen if all three were \ninjected into one being. He already had one problem to deal with so \nhe didn&#39;t try.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; Ice::\n&gt; \n&gt; She sighed.
