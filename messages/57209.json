There was no it, not until \nyou replied to tankor&#39;s little blurb saying he likes the TF movie \nregardless of whether you dislike it or not. That&#39;s not a hostile \ncomment, but your reply certainly was. I certainly don&#39;t want to \noffend you, but I&#39;m really not sure why you&#39;ve gone into hostile \nrant mode. You can&#39;t really take moding out on tankor as an offense \npunishable by death, since he was a new role player when he started. \nIn other words, learning how to role play. \n\nAs Stacy said: Opinions are & will be voiced. If you don&#39;t agree \nwith them, then don&#39;t shoot down someone for it. Let alone the use \nof name calling & foul language. It&#39;s bad sportsmanship. \n\nYou&#39;ve got a lot of experience behind your back, you should know and \nunderstand this.\n\nLastly before I leave, I really have no clue how you managed to \ndecide that everyone hates you and you&#39;re not wanted here. No one \nwas taking shots at you from what I can see.\n\n*sighs* hopefully I haven&#39;t just walked myself into the gas \nchamber... ^^&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Hollywood Narrator&quot; \n&lt;hollywood.narrator@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Oh, WAIT a minute. I HAD to post again now that I remember THIS \nlittle tidbit. I&#39;m sure you all won&#39;t mind, since I&#39;m going to be \ngone anyway, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tankor? Boy, aren&#39;t you that same guy who moded me a bit back by \nignoring my shots despite me repeatedly asking you to acknowledge \nthem? Kid, you&#39;ve got a LOT to learn about RPGing, but if you can \npull stunts like that and get away with it completely free, bravo. \nMe and Cardhead fought, didn&#39;t always agree, but we at least agreed \nthat you, Tankor, are a moder. And that is all I&#39;ve got to say.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Hollywood Narrator \n&gt;   To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, June 13, 2003 4:31 AM\n&gt;   Subject: My Sundown...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   After some consideration I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m going to be \nleaving. It&#39;s obvious that many here hate me and I shouldn&#39;t be a \nmember of this RPG. I simply cannot sit idly by while people take \nshots at me, I always must respond. For this, I am an outcast, and \nnot fit to post here, let alone hang around here. So, hopefully for \nthe final time, I am gone.
