You \nwere \n&gt; not a protoform, no. You were an autobot called Firedrill. I have \nbeen \n&gt; warned about your pledge of alliegance to the Tripredacus. I am \nnot \n&gt; accusing you of anything, I am merely telling you the facts. \nSomehow \n&gt; the Renewal Chamber you were in reformatted you. You must know, \n&gt; however, that if Pacifix, the autobot leader, and I find that \n&gt; Firedrill can be revived, such thing could happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Belthassan: That is, if you agree. I think you could make a fine \n&gt; addition to our forces.\n\n\n"}}
