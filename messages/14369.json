She walked\n&gt; towards Testifier, growling. &quot;Do you know what those sick, blood\n&gt; thirsty maximals would have done to her had I done what I did? Thye\n&gt; would have put her through the worst kind of torture ever thought of,\n&gt; just for fun.  They would had made her suffer unspeakable pain and\n&gt; misery and then let her die a slow death.  I did her a favor and\n&gt; ended it before they could have hurt her any more.  You take about\n&gt; pain, I know pain.  Every time I close my eyes, I see her.  She\n&gt; haunts my dreams and my mind every waking moment.  No matter what, I\n&gt; have to live with this pain for the rest of my life.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She was angry  and almost to the brink of tears. She growled and\n&gt; yelled at Testifier.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I did what I had to do because she was my friend.  Because I cared,\n&gt; I did what I had to do.  I cared enough to save her pain and\n&gt; suffering at the hands of our enemy.  And if you can&#39;t understand\n&gt; that, then tothe pit with you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stood there for a moment looking at Testifier with pain and hurt in\n&gt; her eyes.  Just before she broke down, she transformed into wolf mode\n&gt; and ran out of the base.  She ran through the forest, trying to out\n&gt; run her pain.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;THECODE&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Tesifier gets up, charging towards Drill Bit and KitKat.
