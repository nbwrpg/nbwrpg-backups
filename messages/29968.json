(considering that my box fills up with an average\n&gt; of 30 NBWRPG posts an hour, I&#39;m willing to bet that at\n&gt; least some of you don&#39;t have time to rifle through up\n&gt; to 100 messages a day if you only have time to do\n&gt; e-mail once or twice a day.). I wouldn&#39;t mind things\n&gt; changing. Maybe a tag system where at the end of the\n&gt; message everybody puts in parentheses say...(Tag: John\n&gt; Doe) or something. Or maybe an Attention system in\n&gt; every subject header, say....&quot;Your Subject Header Here\n&gt; (ATTN: Optimus Prime)&quot;. If something is REALLY\n&gt; important, the subject header could be (ATTN:\n&gt; Everyone). \n&gt; \n&gt; I remember being told shortly after I joined that the\n&gt; current system is SUPPOSED to be so everybody has to\n&gt; go through every message. But considering that most of\n&gt; the posts here are one-liners and/or complete drivel\n&gt; (that&#39;s not to say EVERY post are one-liners or drivel\n&gt; though), doing that just seems like a Unicron-sized\n&gt; waste of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts anyone?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Rudra656@a... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     As much as I enjoy watching pointless arguments,\n&gt; &gt; this could drive another \n&gt; &gt; wedge between people in the group.  We don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; that.  Alten, as amusing as \n&gt; &gt; the post was, it went beyond the bounds of good\n&gt; &gt; taste.  From an objective \n&gt; &gt; perspective, Yan probably could have been less harsh\n&gt; &gt; but his point was valid.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
