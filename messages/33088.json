He had only fought with the Maximal&#39;s to save his own \n&gt; &gt; hide...they were different then him. He was destructive and \nnasty. \n&gt; &gt; They were honourable and good. Definetly not his style. He had \n&gt; fixed \n&gt; &gt; that one bot for the fact that he had saved him. But nothing to \n&gt; &gt; matter. He had learned many secrets of this faction as well as \n&gt; thier \n&gt; &gt; base from his brief look into the thoughts of Prowl.\n&gt; &gt; He looked to the sky and took off transforming to his vulture \nmode \n&gt; &gt; and flying off into the distance. Two things for sure on his \n&gt; &gt; mind....he needed a faction to join....and that the Maximals were \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; it.\n\n\n"}}
