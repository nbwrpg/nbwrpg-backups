We did not know it at the time, but they are part of a gestalt\ngroup, with Deemos&#39; Maximals. Hot Rod fought Depp, and the rest of us\nwent after McGowan. They were helping some friends of theirs attack.\nAlso they said something about killing a Maximal traitor. It was us, the\nChivitons, and Shockwave and Unitron of the NDE against them and their\nfriends. McGowan, Depp, and the rest of them transformed to the gestalt,\nRadistor, and soon headed towards Maximal City. Thats when I warned you.\nWe then found out that they were Maximals, and stoped fighting. Tempers\nwere high but Hot Rod defused the situation... for now. Currently Hot\nRod is talking with some bots at the Chiviton base. The gestalt group\nand us are heading back,&quot; Cleder finished his report to IR.\n\n"}}
