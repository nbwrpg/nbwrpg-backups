The war suit was doing its best to \nprotect him, but it couldn&#39;t take too much more. With a silent \ncommand from him, his cloaking device activates, Slayer dissapearing \nfrom view.\n\nHe jumps into the air, his jetpack lifting him up as he shoots \nmissile after missile at the bots on the ground.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRamulus jumps to the side, a missile nearly hitting him. Another one \nhits to the side of him, sending him flipping him into a tree.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; SnowCat::\n&gt; \n&gt; She saw the rocket come towards her.  She waited, then at the last \n&gt; second, jumped to the side to get out of the way.  The rocket \nstruck \n&gt; ground near her.  She fell and slowly got up.  She started off \nagain \n&gt; towards Striker and Ramulus. She fired her optic lazars at Striker. \n&gt; Ignoring her side, wires exposed and flapping around as she ran.\n\n\n"}}
