Remember, Tuscon is fighting an Ex Prime, and he is still Dark Rodimus and not Dark Hot Rod. Even Prime or Megatron couldn&#39;t throw Rodimus around like that when they&#39;re at full strength.\n\nIf you want to throw him around, then talk to me on list or off, and we can work something out. \n\nAgain, I am not mad, but I want to keep it fair for all the characters involved. \n\nPreston\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
