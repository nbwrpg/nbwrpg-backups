The shields were repaired before you ever began \nwork on them.  You were assigned to work on the weapons which, I might add, \nyou never did.  As for my codes not working, I copied your program with only \none addition.  I made only three codes with the new addition because it is \nfor those who were here before I arrived.  And yes I made myself a code, I \nleft out the new addition however.  This addition provides for an override in \ncase of a lockdown of the ship.  This way only those with the code may travel \nfreely during a lockdown and they may begin or end a shutdown.&quot;  He begins to \nthink to himself about the currant situation.  &quot;Your engineering skills are \nimpressive and your ego is enormous.&quot;  He turns to the computer and with a \nfew quick strokes erases the new program with no way to retrieve it except \nfor the copy in his own memory.  &quot;You are obviously more useful here.&quot;  He \nmanages to get that out with only the slightest hint of sarcasm in his voice. \n &quot;I&#39;m sure I can find another computer to fiddle with, in a quieter place so \nthat I can think at the same time.&quot;  He stalks off to a storage locker to \npick up a few things.\n\n"}}
