Several armed humanoids come out, a few unarmed ones following \ncarrying some equipment.\n\nThe guards move to get between Epyon and Bruiser, in case Epyon tries to \nfinish Bruiser off.  The unarmed humanoids begin quick repairs, in a few \nminutes they successfully clot the leaking of mech-fluid from his severed \nlimb and reattach the leg.  They continue with the repairs, not bothering to \nanswer his question.  \n\nOver the loudspeaker, the victor is announced;  \n\n&quot;Congratulations to Epyon, victor of this bout and the first fighter to win \nhis match in this year&#39;s Round One.  With such a quick win, it will no doubt \nbring him many fans.  Remember everyone, the IGL is brought to you by Trees.  \nThey&#39;re everywhere.&quot;  \n\n"}}
