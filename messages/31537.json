He recieves Dark One&#39;s transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Kill them,&quot; he replies, &quot;If they&#39;re firing at you, they&#39;re no\nlonger part of the Alliance.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He sees Composer enter the battle, opening a comm to him as well.\n&quot;Open fire on anyone non-Maximal, prefferebly the ones with Decepticon\nsymbols. Use all you got.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks down at the battle, aiming at Rampage and firing two\nenergy-draining missiles at the bot. The missile lock onto Rampage&#39;s\nsignature, following it.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Supernova spins in the air, two blasts passing right next to him. He\nfires his gun at one of the incoming missiles, causing it to detonate\nalong with the other ones, but the shockwave nearly knocked him out of\nthe air. He flies up, avoiding Rampage.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Galactors, let&#39;s show them what we can do!&quot; he yells to his fellow\nteammates, &quot;Form jets!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He transforms into a part of a jet, waiting for his team to do so as\nwell.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; One of the shots hit Slasys, nearly knocking him out of the air as\nhe recieves orders from Supernova. He clenches his teeth, transforming\ninto another part of a jet and joining with Supernova. He hoped that\nScrap would join with them so that they could use his repair system.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Scrap transforms into part of a jet, joining with Supernova and\nSlasys. The large jet takes off at full speed, passing Rampage and\nfiring two large signature-seeking missiles at Surgital.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Vicyr transforms into a part of a jet, combining with Flare and\ncloaking them both. They fly at Surgital, firing two large charges,\nset to explode on impact.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Astral recieves Zardus&#39;s orders, taking off and flying toward the\nCybertronian Fire. The other Lavacons follow him. He growls, looking\nback and seeing that Fenox wasn&#39;t there. If they had to form Lavatron,\nhe would be missing an arm.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Seeing his target stand up, Kluster fires two more missiles at\nRippersnapper.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Grimmler reaches the CF, flying into the air and pulling out a\nmissile launcher. He aims carefully, firing two missiles at Rampage,\nhoping to knock him out of the air. The missiles were heat seeking.\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &quot;Decepticons, it looks like,&quot; Prowl replies to Epyon as he fires two\nmore missiles at Fireblade.

He waved it away, and\nwas enraged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Cutthroat slag Autobot trash buckets!!!!&quot; Cutthroat yelled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Cutthroat shot a big stream of flame from his mouth at the CF.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;       Triggerhappy cackled, then fired a compressed air shot from\nBlowpipe at the CF.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;       The Bodicons saw this &quot;Alliance&quot; coming to help the Maximals.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;COMBINE!!!!!!!!&quot; Decapitron yelled.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       The other 4 Bodicons got close to Decapitron.  Then, their\nbodies all got into the right positions and they formed a huge gestalt\nwarrior called Surgital.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;It&#39;s time for your operation!!!!&quot; Surgital yelled down at\nthe Alliance members.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        The Bodicons all agreed on a target.  Surgital&#39;s hand\nconverted into a massive spinning saw.  He lowered his hand down and\nattempted to cut Megaton in half.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;        Composer eventually arrived at the scene.  He landed beside\nZardus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;My leader, I&#39;m here to help you aid the Maximals.\nWheeljack is coming as well,&quot; Composer informed Zardus of his arrival.\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;       Quatro could hear the battle all around him.  Quatro went\noutside and saw the gestalt warrior Surgital, and the Alliance coming\nto help Maximals.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &quot;The Maximals and their allies can fend off the Decepticons\nby themselves.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that this is a big trick.  I have\nto see Megatron,&quot; Quatro said to himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Quatro ran around, trying to be stealthy so that nobody\ncould see him.  He didn&#39;t want to waste power on using his stealth\nmode here.  Then, when he was away from the battle, he did a data\nsearch on the Decepticons to try and find their base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &quot;Decepticon Base:Dark Avian,&quot; Quatro said aloud.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        Quatro transformed to hoverbike mode, and speeded off\ntowards the Dark Avian.\n\n\n"}}
