Pain! Lights! Pain! Darkness! Pain!\n\nThese were the things that ass=\r\naulted Rodimus as he somehow moved down a tunnel that seemed to be composed=\r\n of stone and heat and flames! He opened his eyes, not even having been awa=\r\nre of closing them and looked around. he could barely make out the reddish =\r\nsheen that the faintly glowing magma left along the walls and ceiling. The =\r\nheat was barely tolerable and almost unbearable. \n\nHe looked down at his ha=\r\nnds and shuddered as he saw only the blackness of Dark Rodimus, it took him=\r\n a full moment that his armor was black, not because of evil, but because i=\r\nt was so badly scorched and burnt that all the other colors had been lost.\n=\r\n\nHe smiled for a moment, feeling a curious sense of freedom. He felt free o=\r\nf the darkness that had overwhelmed him, the fear and guilt he had lived wi=\r\nth for so many months. He felt new and alive! He felt a sense of giddiness =\r\nas he flexed his fingers and he began to laugh  . . . \n\nTwo luminous eyes a=\r\nppeared out of the darkness and blinked, &quot;Yesss, you lie still now.&quot; a voic=\r\ne hissed from nearby. &quot;We will get you back to the machine, yess we will.&quot; =\r\n\n\nRodimus&#39; laughter was cut short as he realized that he was being carried =\r\nby something, something large and misshapen, yet it moved amazingly quick! =\r\n\n\nIt was then that Rodimus heard a strange piercing scream from somewhere i=\r\nn the darkness. It took him a moment to realize that it was he that was the=\r\n one screaming as he saw and felt large all around him! \n\nHe felt a sting o=\r\nn his shoulder, and for a second he was surprised that he could feel such a=\r\n tiny sensation and then his world went dark.\n\n(TAG or TBC)\n\nPreston\n\n\n"}}
