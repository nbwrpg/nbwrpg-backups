You have ta stay here.\n&gt; Sorry but rules are rules.  If you&#39;re sick or injured you must stay behind\n&gt; for proper treatment.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The large cat groans and steps back to the Ark, plopping himself down at the\n&gt; entrance.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry Uproar, you&#39;ll have your chance when you&#39;re fully cured.&quot;\n\n"}}
