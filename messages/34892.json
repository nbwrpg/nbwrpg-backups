Menasor, a little \ndisoriented, swings a large round house punch at Prowl.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAstroblast pulls up, missiles grazing his bottom. He catches one \nmissile with his tractor beam, and turns it around sending it back at \nthe jet he can see behind him.\n\nSwitchblade&#39;s cloaking energy is depleted, he decloaks, and \nlaughs. &quot;Astroblast open your hatch a bit, I&#39;m going to toss some \ndemo packs at the tailers.&quot;\n\nAstroblast&#39;s hatch opens up enough or Switchblade to toss something \nout.\n\nSwitchblade pulls out two antimatter demo charges. &quot;Food for thought \nstupid jet.&quot; He mutters to himself, as he sets the charges to \ndetonate when they reach the jet that he can see behind. He throws \none at the jets behind, waits a second, then throws the other in the \nsame matter. The explosion should deter any further followers.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nRippersnapper growls and grows even more angrier at the \nword, &quot;retreat&quot;. &quot;Rippersnapper no want retreat, Rippersnapper want \ndestroy Maximal!&quot; lasers from Orion sear his optics, rendering him \nblinded for a second, the Rippersnapper reluctantly transforms, \nfollowing Astroblast. He fires two blasts from his cyclone gun back \nat Orion as he goes.\n\n\n"}}
