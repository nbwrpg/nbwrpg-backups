Megatron is not able to get his mace up in\ntime, and receives the blade, as it plunges into his neck. A grinding of\nMetal against Metal can be heard, and Motormaster strains, his arms heating\nup from the amount of energy used, to try to finish the stroke cleanly,\nthrough Megatron&#39;s head.\n\nThe sword opens a small wound, and as oil starts to produce, it continues.\nMegatron finally brings the mace, in a wide swing, and hits Motormaster\nhead on, the impact sending the Stunticon leader into the star ship, and\nthe small part caves in. Megatron replaces his mace with his hand again,\nand steps forward. &quot;Give it up Motormaster.&quot;\n\nFor a moment there is silence, then the ruble comes to life, and\nMotormaster lunges out of it, bringing fist after fist into Megatrons\nchest. The Slagmaker doubles back from the pain, and tries to put his hands\nup, but Motormaster puts his fists together, and rocks Megatron with an Axe\nlike blow across the jaw, then again across the jaw, in an upward stroke,\nsending Megatron back several 100 feet, and into the foilage. Motormaster\ntransforms, and follows his would be fake leader.\n\n\n\n"}}
