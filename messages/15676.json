Prowl was in the\nair\n&gt; instead of on the ground. And I realized that once the post was alreadt\n&gt; sent. I apologize.\n&gt; However...you have just commited a mode against my character, Dinobot.\n&gt; Dinobot&#39;s isn&#39;t unconciouse nor has asked to be lifted, so, there is no\n&gt; reason why Firearm should touch him at all.\n&gt; I deny this move and it shall not be accepted.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * Dinobot had hit the ground hard after being shot in the side by\n&gt; Oblitercon, the force of the blast sending him crashing into the trees at\n&gt; the far side of the clearing.\n&gt; He now lay half suspended off of the ground by a particularely soft bush,\n&gt; and a few dozen branches...as well as a tree which had toppled over when\nhe\n&gt; had slammed into it&#39;s trunk.\n&gt; He groaned as he lay there, completely sprawled out and in the most\nextreme\n&gt; pain he had ever felt in his entire life.\n&gt; Dinobot caughed to clear his throat of what mech-fluid had worked its way\nup\n&gt; it and opened his optics.\n&gt; He was slightly confused when he was only able to see out of one side,\nthen\n&gt; remembering that his other optic had been damaged as well.\n&gt; With a sigh he heaved himself to his feet, but ended up in a kneel, his\nhead\n&gt; bowed and his optics clenched in pain.\n&gt; This just wasn&#39;t his day.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
