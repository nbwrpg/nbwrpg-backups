Looking up at Prowl as he tightens his \nhold on her, knowing that it was time to leave.\nReturning the kiss he gave her as she felt her feet leave the ground, \nholding the piff ball to her a little more tightly.\n&lt; We had better, slag knows what&#39;s going on at the Cybertronian Fire.&gt;\nIron Raptor squished herself against Prowl a little more, just not liking \nthe idea of going fast...even though they had to.\nBut then a concern poped into her head. The little guy she held in her hands \ncouldn&#39;t be in battle, but she couldn&#39;t just let him go.\nShe sighed, then looked down at him.*\n\n&quot; When we land, there is a compartment in my back armor, get into that, \nalright? And stay there.&quot;\n\n* She then looked at Prowl.* &lt; When we get to the CF, just drop me, I can \nland on my feet. I want to get into the fighting and get it over with as \nquick as I can. Alright?&gt;\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
