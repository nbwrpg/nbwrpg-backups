And then there&#39;s this thing about Rodimus..  Tha=\r\nt is so gonna put him over the edge.

I hope Rodimus tries to explain himself gradually around my br=\r\nother because if he plows into him about it, yeah, Tucson will snap, and we=\r\n don&#39;t want that.  But if he waits and thinks about how to explain in a civ=\r\nil manner, Tucson will listen to him.  But if he says he can not be trusted=\r\n with the Matrix, then his request to hand it over has ta be honored, and i=\r\nt can only be given to Leo Prime as he requests.&quot;\n\nRattrap cocks his head c=\r\nuriously.\n\n&quot; Why can&#39;t Wings hold onto it?  He&#39;s earned that right more tha=\r\nn a few times.  He put his life on the line for everyone and he gave his al=\r\nl ta Silverbolt when he didn&#39;t even have enough for himself.  So why doesn&#39;=\r\nt he deserve that honor?&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks to him.\n\n&quot; Good question, he=\r\n never said why he didn&#39;t feel that he deserved to have the Matrix.  But he=\r\n wants Leo Prime to hold onto it so we have to honor his request. &quot;\n\nQuicks=\r\ntride nods.\n\n&quot; Come to think of it, I kind of remember seeing a lot of dama=\r\nge to the walls of that cave the first time we went in to scope it out.  It=\r\n looked like a large animal was taking his anger out on the walls.  That ol=\r\nd dragon must&#39;ve had a really baaaad temper and he didn&#39;t want to take it o=\r\nut on any other creature but himself.  And now, Tucson is the Silver Dragon=\r\n, temper and all.  So he probably feels that his flaws aren&#39;t worth the hon=\r\nor of the Matrix.&quot;\n\nDon&#39;t be envious of what you don&#39;t have, be grateful fo=\r\nr things you already posses.
