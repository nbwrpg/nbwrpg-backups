Barging in there with guns blazing is going to get us all killed, though.&quot;\n\nHe frowns, deep in thought. &quot;Bots like us arn&#39;t designed to operate under water, but with special suits and things like that, we can be able to. However, it might still slow us down.\n\n&quot;What I think we should do,&quot; he continues, &quot;Is first scout the base out to see if it has any weaknesses. Scyther has technology that can be used to do that. Once we have a scan, we can coordinate our attack accordingly. I think attacking only specific sectors is the better idea, but we need to know what sectors are the important ones.&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Shivah::\n&gt; \n&gt; Shivah looked to Killfest &quot;what&#39;s your plan commander Killfest?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
