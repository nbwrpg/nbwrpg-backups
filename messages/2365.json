You had\nScamrock \ngrab\n&gt; them,\n&gt; &gt; which would cause them to explode because of impact.  That was \nyour\n&gt; mistake\n&gt; &gt; by doing that.  Also, I read in a few posts that the People&#39;s Base\n&gt; exploded,\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t see the actual post where it exploded, and I never saw \nyour\n&gt; &#39;sister&#39;\n&gt; &gt; , but evidently since I didn&#39;t get the e-mail, you can&#39;t blame me)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Oblitercons (Oblitertron)/Nemesis \nEnforcer/Anubis/Hades/Unitron/Koga\n&gt; &gt; Shuko/Scattershot:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Oblitertron raised both of his arms in triumph, splitting into \nfive\n&gt; seperate\n&gt; &gt; pieces, each transforming into a robot, the Oblitercons landing\nin \na line.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dark One: &quot;Alright, the base is crushed, this...Dracona&#39;s base is \nin\n&gt; &gt; ruins...her forces are destroyed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Breakdown: &quot;I think Nemesis called for reinforcements.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pyro: &quot;Then let&#39;s fire a few shots off and pull back to \nre-energize.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hiss: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scavenger raised his missile launcher, firing a rocket off at \nScamrock,\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; other Oblitercons charging off towards the Alliance base, not \nreally\n&gt; caring\n&gt; &gt; about finishing them off, leaving Nemesis and Scattershot alone \nwith the f\n&gt; our\n&gt; &gt; Newcomers.\n&gt; &gt; -------------\n&gt; &gt; Nemesis Enforcer fired two optic blasts at the People&#39;s base&#39;s \nrubble,\n&gt; &gt; turning, a clawed fist sending him slamming into a trunk.  Anubis \ngrabbed\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; by the neck, kneeing him in the face twice, backhanded him with \nclaws.\n&gt; &gt; -------------\n&gt; &gt; Scattershot fired off twenty explosive bullets down randomly at \nthe\n&gt; Radicons,\n&gt; &gt; deciding he really didn&#39;t enjoy them without a bomb, he&#39;d have to \ngo bumb\n&gt; &gt; some off other people.  Raising an &#39;eyebrow&#39;, he fired off ten \nshots,\n&gt; Anubis\n&gt; &gt; slamming into a tree, the tree hitting the ground.  Landing to\nthe \nground,\n&gt; &gt; his side aching from previous wounds, he didn&#39;t spot Unitron from \nbehind,\n&gt; six\n&gt; &gt; laser bolts tearing into the Alliance member&#39;s back, sending him \ncrashing\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; the ground.\n&gt; &gt; ------------\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Excellent, Unitron.  Let&#39;s move out!  Hades, grab Anubis.  It&#39;s \ntime to\n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; rejuvinated.  The people here shouldn&#39;t hinder our plans, their \nbase is\n&gt; &gt; destroyed.&quot;  Unitron ordered, Hades picking Anubis up, the \nNewcomers\n&gt; heading\n&gt; &gt; back towards their downed ship to recieve repairs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; &gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:\n&gt; &gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/10/_/_/_/959480510/\n&gt; &gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
