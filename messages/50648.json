Late Lincoln Osis, the \nlast Smoke Jaguar, had won his position as a Khan and then as Ilkhan. \nHe was a tactical Genius, but his lack of strategic thinking got his \nClan wiped out by the Inner Sphere forces. However, we train our \nwarriors so that they understand strategies as well as tactics. In \nyour case though, I will support you and help you with strategies, and \nI hope so will Ragnar. That man is a strategic-planner born.

They are the\n&gt; &gt; founders of all Clans, \n&gt; &gt; the makers of our society and one of the most, if\n&gt; &gt; not the most revered \n&gt; &gt; Bloodline among all Clans. Some of us maintain that\n&gt; &gt; our duty as \n&gt; &gt; Warriors is to protect the Inner Sphere. We oppose\n&gt; &gt; the Crusaders \n&gt; &gt; saying it is a desecrated place and that it deserves\n&gt; &gt; only to be \n&gt; &gt; conquered and brought back up into a stronger Clan\n&gt; &gt; society. It is all \n&gt; &gt; interpretation of the words of Nicholas Kerensky,\n&gt; &gt; the first Ilkhan, \n&gt; &gt; and it has led many to die, both among and outside\n&gt; &gt; the Clans.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She closed her eyes remembered all too well the two\n&gt; &gt; days she had spent \n&gt; &gt; evading the massive ComGuard battlemechs at the\n&gt; &gt; Great battle of \n&gt; &gt; Tukkayid.

Remember, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told you that we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abhor waste. Destroying a forest is the kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing that debalances \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a world&#39;s environment needlessly. A military\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compound can be built on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rock farther away. In that situation, when you\n&gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your officer&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orders betray the spirits of Kerensky, you can\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; youmust challenge \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him to a Trial.

She was a Wolf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and she had to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; break him from the tactics and habits he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make him into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: Neg. A Clan warrior that is not\n&gt; &gt; prepared,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically is as good as the freebirth scum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; populating the bandit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste. You must learn to be ready at all\n&gt; &gt; times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She eased her tone. She had rebuked him, and\n&gt; &gt; now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instruct him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Katya: The Clan rituals have two goals; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one is honor. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces meeting in a Trial meet in a circle\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals. This way, we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight zellbringen, single combat. I admit\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity may prevent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us from always achieving single combat, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; honor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not diminish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this way. The second reason for Trials is\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevents waste. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Clans have survived their birthing because\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reduced wastes of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kind to a minimum.
