He had only fought with the Maximal&#39;s to save his own \nhide...they were different then him. He was destructive and nasty. \nThey were honourable and good. Definetly not his style. He had fixed \nthat one bot for the fact that he had saved him. But nothing to \nmatter. He had learned many secrets of this faction as well as thier \nbase from his brief look into the thoughts of Prowl.\nHe looked to the sky and took off transforming to his vulture mode \nand flying off into the distance. Two things for sure on his \nmind....he needed a faction to join....and that the Maximals were not \nit.\n\n\n"}}
