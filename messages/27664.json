ANTOTHER ONE? Arrgghh!!&quot; She threw her hands up in \nmock-surrender and made to pull her bottom lip down in a pout.. but \ndecided against it. \n\n&quot;You and your boulders..&quot; The Fuzor muttered before taking off again \nto the sky.\n\nShe knew the track, and made it to the bog in a shorter time, much to \nher pleasure. When she was landing by it, she spotted some of the \nblack moss Carnage had been talking about. It looked.. icky. \n\nTentivly she prodded a finger at it, and found that it wasn&#39;t as \ndisgusting as it looked. Grabbing a few pints of it, the Fuzor stored \nit in a large leaf she had found on a bush nearby. Deciding she \nshould take this back first before she found another boulder, Teltoli \nflew up into the sky and jetted back to the clearing.\n\nReaching her friend, she discovered that somehow she had flown pretty \nfar up into the sky.. higher than what was usually needed. Teltoli \nsmiled and enjoyed the view for a moment, before landing softly in \nthe clearing.\n\n&quot;There! Moss! Yech!&quot; She said in close-disgust and she put the leaf \nfull of moss down by the boulder, and positioned herself on the \nboulder.\n\n&quot;I am -so- not moving until you tell me what you need the boulder \nfor! And that Moss stuff!&quot; The Fuzor said stubbornly, crossing her \narms across her chest. A small hint of a smile kept tugging at her \nface, even though she was trying to remain serious.\n\n\n"}}
