He looked \nat the fallen tarantula.\n    &quot;Im Tarantulas, and your a dead bot walking!&quot; He hissed. Suddenly, his \nshoulders arched and four cluster missles collided with Paralysis, sending \nhim into peices.\n    Aerostreak began to fire, but the spider anticipated the attack and shot \nthe pistol out of his hand. Then netted him in a techno-web.\n    &quot;Well, that settles that. Aracnia, its been a pleasure.&quot; He hissed and \nheaded out into the corridor and saw Quickstrike running towrds him.\n    &quot;Stop fuzor! Leave me be or I shall destroy Aracnia!&quot; He said, pointing \nhis gun at the unconscience Black Aracnia. But, in the shadows, Paralysis \ncrawled over to Aerostreak nad released him before going into stasis. \nAerostreak hoped Quickstrike would distract the spider so he could nab him.\n\n"}}
