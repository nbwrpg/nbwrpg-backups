He is slightly shorter than DarkPrime and just as \nwide.  It is a matter of weight ratios.  A several hundred pound Silverbolt \ncannot carry a one ton Blaise.)\n\n::KnokBlaise::\n    He was starting to be raised and is moved a few feet when he falls back \nto the ground.  Blaise tips forward and Knok wisely jumps out before Blaise \ncomes crushing down.\n\n::Knok::\n    He does a nice flip landing on Skar who is now awake.\n\n::Skar::\n    Skar throws Knok into Blaise making a small ding in his leg.  Skar runs \npast Knok and quickly digs a hole to get at the control port.  Once again in \ncontrol of Blaise, Skar decides to change the weapon back to two guns.\n\n::SkarBlaise::\n    He looks up to where Silverbolt is and fires a pair of rockets while \nfiring a set of four blasts at Fury.\n\n"}}
