The Trainier program was fighting \nthe device that held her in stasis lock.  A  small rbbon of smoke \nescaped from her head gear as well as at the device.  The trainer \nchip was no longer needed.  The program was now 95% complete, only a \nsmall portion of her original maximal program remained.   Her systems \nstarted running a self diognostic and her eyess opened, then closed \nagain.  Her fists clentched up, then relaxed. Her maximal logic \ncircuits were smoldering, but the trainer program was rebuilding the \nactual logic circuits to function with trainer logic.  The program \nalso made sure that she would serve Prebon and be subservient to any \nother male trainer.  But her warrior program was being re-enforced as \nwell.  She would fight to the death for the trainers when she came \nout of stasis lock.\n\n\n"}}
