Or since they had landed.\nDays, weeks�months?\nBut she smiled. It was good to be together again.\nDiana tickled a little harder for a moment before she pushed her head \nagainst Rion to get him to fall over. And with him in this state, it \nwouldn�t be hard.\nShe put her paw back down to the ground and pushed a little more, mainly \nbecause she knew that Rion would be out of breath after ticking him like \nthat, and he would need to sit to regain his breath. Also�he would be at a \ndisadvantage off his feet like that if she decided that he hadn�t had enough \nof tickling. *\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
