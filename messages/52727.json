The explosions started to \nblow up the engines first, then expanded to the rest of the ship. It \ndid not even have time to crash as it came apart in the air. Burning \npieces of metal and smoldering airborne ruins fell down hard.\n\nTyrael looked around. His ship and his command were gone, unless \nCheetah and Tigerhawk had managed to get out. He was decided to end \nthe battle though. He looked for Rodimus.\n\nTyrael: Rodimus, Tyrael here. Mind keeping a piece of Hydras for me?\n\nSanguine and Meteara were in heavy combat. Sanguine rushed at the Vok \nand threw her in the air. Meteara quickly engaged her jets to get \ncontrol, but was hit by a fiery steel beam. She was grounded but came \nback.\n\nSanguine approached her with deadly determination. She made a fierce \nlooking stiletto out of her hand brought it closer and closer to her \nenemy&#39;s head.\n\nMeteara: Why do you want to kill me?\n\nSanguine breathed heavily. Why? There was too much to be said.\n\nSanguine: Your race killed a brethren of mine. There is something in \nPredacon behavior that is called vengeance. That is what&#39;s going on.\n\nLittle did she notice the crackling sound growing louder and louder. \nAs the tip of her weapon was in range of the Vok, a massive electric \njolt jumped on it and shocked the criminal. She fell hard to the \nground too. Meteara stood up. She was clearly wounded too.\n\nMeteara: I too have many assets. Let&#39;s finish this folly.\n\nSanguine: Yes, you are right.\n\nIn an instant, Meteara started firing innumerable bullets from her \nmachine guns. At the same moment, Sanguine morphed. She made a beast&#39;s \nhead out of her legs and went at Meteara...\n\n\n"}}
