A lotta fire just got deployed\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nI&#39;m definitely sure it wasn&#39;t from Hydras.

What he wouldn=\r\n&#39;t do to be able to\n&gt; &gt; sink his sharp claws into Hydras, tearing at his ar=\r\nmor until there was\n&gt; &gt; nothing left. Yet he holds enough restraint to hold=\r\n back from doing so, for\n&gt; &gt; the time being.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Many innocent creatu=\r\nres who were native to this planet have lost their\n&gt; &gt; lives needlessly, no=\r\n thanks to you and your reign of greed and destruction.\n&gt; &gt; This is NOT our=\r\n planet and we have NO right taking away what belongs here!\n&gt; &gt; That is wha=\r\nt brings me here, Hydras! This planet deserves freedom and I am\n&gt; &gt; here to=\r\n make sure it gets it!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He exclaims with a loud draconic roar, as s=\r\nmoke seeps out of his flaring\n&gt; &gt; nostrils as do a couple of white hot flam=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With Rodimus still on his back, Tucson circles Hydras as the ne=\r\nver ending\n&gt; &gt; coils of his long tail creates a ring around the enemy.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is also your chance to take back something that was take=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; from you. No holds barred, do what you feel is the right thing, and w=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; you feel in your spark is rightful to your cause. I will follow sui=\r\nt. We\n&gt; &gt; will fight as one, and as one we will serve judgement to those wh=\r\no deserve\n&gt; &gt; it. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He remains in his circling pattern, waiting for=\r\n Rodimus to direct him, in\n&gt; &gt; hopes to help build his confidence as an Aut=\r\nobot Commander. At the same\n&gt; &gt; time, Tucson had to learn to control his gr=\r\neatest weakness, his\n&gt; &gt; uncontrollable temper which left unchecked, had th=\r\ne potential to turn him\n&gt; &gt; into an extremely dangerous individual. Now tha=\r\nt he takes on the role of a\n&gt; &gt; powerful creature, it would prove hard to q=\r\nuell the fire that burns deep\n&gt; &gt; within his spark. He hoped that this part=\r\nnership would help keep the\n&gt; &gt; balance between the both of them. They woul=\r\nd need that more than ever if\n&gt; &gt; they have hopes of stopping Hydras for go=\r\nod.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon!&quot; RODIMUS imperiously said from TUSCON&#39;s ba=\r\nck. &quot;That&#39;s alot of\n&gt; Predacons out there. Unless you have some back up out=\r\n here that I\n&gt; don&#39;t know about we are a long way from home.&quot; RODIMUS looke=\r\nd around,\n&gt; &quot;I see Cyclonus, have you seen Hydras yet?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was not fea=\r\nr that moved RODIMUS in all this, but a warrior&#39;s\n&gt; caution. Even the most =\r\nfearless of warriors had to know when the odds\n&gt; were stacked against them,=\r\n and when they had even a snowball&#39;s chance\n&gt; of winning a fight. As RODIMU=\r\nS pulled out his rifle and targeted the\n&gt; Predacons, he could not help wond=\r\nering if he fires will it get them\n&gt; all killed, and if TUSCON wanted to th=\r\nem to go down in some blaze of\n&gt; glory. Even two primes cannot stand up to =\r\nthe entire Predacon forces!\n&gt; \n&gt; CYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles the=\r\nir equals and at the moment\n&gt; HYDRAS was not visible, which made the situat=\r\nion even more dangerous.\n&gt; And that was not counting all the other Predacon=\r\ns just waiting to blow\n&gt; them out of the air.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What are you doing here=\r\n.&quot; CYCLONUS&#39; voice came over the comlink over\n&gt; a general frequency. &quot;We ha=\r\nve no quarel with you this night. Continue\n&gt; firing on us and we will wipe =\r\nyou from the skies.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a wicked chuckle from SKYSHADOW, &quot;I don=\r\n&#39;t think these two\n&gt; would try to take on the entire Predacon army. Maybe t=\r\nhey came to be\n&gt; the dino beasts along with us?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He is full of enough=\r\n hot air.&quot; SCOURGE said, sounding almost eager to\n&gt; fight. &quot;Maybe he can pu=\r\nt it to some good use.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s sweeps began\n&gt; to circle outwards their w=\r\neapons charging but not yet firing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Finish burning the dinosaurs.&quot; CY=\r\nCLONUS barked to the other Predacons\n&gt; who seemed to be approaching. &quot;Make =\r\nsure none of the crazed beasts\n&gt; rises again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; CYCLONUS, SCOURGE and t=\r\nhe sweeps slid foward, &quot;We will deal with these\n&gt; intruders.&quot; DEEPSTRYKE PH=\r\nOBIA and BLACK RAZOR slid in behind them.\n&gt; \n&gt; DEEPSTRYKE sent HYDRAS a mes=\r\nsage alerting him to TUSCON&#39;s and RODIMUS&#39;\n&gt; appearance and the approach of=\r\n a flying Maximal.

He&#39;s wit=\r\nh&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus and now he&#39;s facing off with Hydras.  A lotta fire just =\r\ngot deployed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and I&#39;m definitely sure it wasn&#39;t from Hydras.  Tucso=\r\nn&#39;s in a really bad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mood, and I think it&#39;s about ta get worse.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;This is Leo. Judging from your location we are=\r\n at least several hours&lt;br&gt;\nfrom you, and that that is for those of us who =\r\ncan fly. You had better&lt;br&gt;\nget Tuscon reigned in until we can get there. L=\r\neo Prime. Out.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;OLD - Straight Shot, Talon &amp; Hydras&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Much to Straight Shot&#39;s suspicion, Tucson does indeed =\r\nhave the look of an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; enraged predator on his draconic face.  What h=\r\ne wouldn&#39;t do to be able to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sink his sharp claws into Hydras, tear=\r\ning at his armor until there was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nothing left.  Yet he holds enoug=\r\nh restraint to hold back from doing so, for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the time being.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Many innocent creatures who were native to this planet have l=\r\nost their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lives needlessly, no thanks to you and your reign of gre=\r\ned and destruction.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is NOT our planet and we have NO right ta=\r\nking away what belongs here!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That is what brings me here, Hydras! =\r\n This planet deserves freedom and I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; here to make sure it gets i=\r\nt!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He exclaims with a loud draconic roar, as smoke seeps=\r\n out of his flaring&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nostrils as do a couple of white hot flames.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; With Rodimus still on his back, Tucson circles Hydras as t=\r\nhe never ending&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; coils of his long tail creates a ring around the e=\r\nnemy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Rodimus, this is also your chance to take back som=\r\nething that was taken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from you.  No holds barred, do what you feel=\r\n is the right thing, and what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you feel in your spark is rightful t=\r\no your cause.  I will follow suit.  We&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will fight as one, and as o=\r\nne we will serve judgement to those who deserve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; He remains in his circling pattern, waiting for Rodimus to direct him=\r\n, in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hopes to help build his confidence as an Autobot Commander.  =\r\nAt the same&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; time, Tucson had to learn to control his greatest weak=\r\nness, his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; uncontrollable temper which left unchecked, had the pote=\r\nntial to turn him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; into an extremely dangerous individual.  Now tha=\r\nt he takes on the role of a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; powerful creature, it would prove hard=\r\n to quell the fire that burns deep&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; within his spark.  He hoped tha=\r\nt this partnership would help keep the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; balance between the both of=\r\n them.  They would need that more than ever if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they have hopes of =\r\nstopping Hydras for good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Tuscon!&quot; =\r\nRODIMUS imperiously said from TUSCON&#39;s back. &quot;That&#39;s alot of&lt;br&gt;\nPredacons =\r\nout there. Unless you have some back up out here that I&lt;br&gt;\ndon&#39;t know abou=\r\nt we are a long way from home.&quot; RODIMUS looked around,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I see Cyclonus,=\r\n have you seen Hydras yet?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt was not fear that moved RODIMUS in =\r\nall this, but a warrior&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\ncaution. Even the most fearless of warriors h=\r\nad to know when the odds&lt;br&gt;\nwere stacked against them, and when they had e=\r\nven a snowball&#39;s chance&lt;br&gt;\nof winning a fight. As RODIMUS pulled out his r=\r\nifle and targeted the&lt;br&gt;\nPredacons, he could not help wondering if he fire=\r\ns will it get them&lt;br&gt;\nall killed, and if TUSCON wanted to them to go down =\r\nin some blaze of&lt;br&gt;\nglory.  Even two primes cannot stand up to the entire =\r\nPredacon forces!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCYCLONUS and HYDRAS were by themsevles their equa=\r\nls and at the moment&lt;br&gt;\nHYDRAS was not visible, which made the situation e=\r\nven more dangerous.&lt;br&gt;\nAnd that was not counting all the other Predacons j=\r\nust waiting to blow&lt;br&gt;\nthem out of the air.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;What are you doing h=\r\nere.&quot; CYCLONUS&#39; voice came over the comlink over&lt;br&gt;\na general frequency. &quot;=\r\nWe have no quarel with you this night. Continue&lt;br&gt;\nfiring on us and we wil=\r\nl wipe you from the skies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a wicked chuckle from SKYSHA=\r\nDOW, &quot;I don&#39;t think these two&lt;br&gt;\nwould try to take on the entire Predacon =\r\narmy. Maybe they came to be&lt;br&gt;\nthe dino beasts along with us?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;H=\r\ne is full of enough hot air.&quot; SCOURGE said, sounding almost eager to&lt;br&gt;\nfi=\r\nght. &quot;Maybe he can put it to some good use.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s sweeps began&lt;br&gt;\nto =\r\ncircle outwards their weapons charging but not yet firing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Finish=\r\n burning the dinosaurs.&quot; CYCLONUS barked to the other Predacons&lt;br&gt;\nwho see=\r\nmed to be approaching. &quot;Make sure none of the crazed beasts&lt;br&gt;\nrises again=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCYCLONUS, SCOURGE and the sweeps slid foward, &quot;We will deal wit=\r\nh these&lt;br&gt;\nintruders.&quot; DEEPSTRYKE PHOBIA and BLACK RAZOR slid in behind th=\r\nem.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDEEPSTRYKE sent HYDRAS a message alerting him to TUSCON&#39;s and =\r\nRODIMUS&#39;&lt;br&gt;\nappearance and the approach of a flying Maximal.
