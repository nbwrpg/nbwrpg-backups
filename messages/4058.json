If he had brought it in the front door Hell Beast and his lacky&#39;s would \nhave spotted it. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: The pod has arrived! Excellent! Scorpinox will have to \nselect a powerful beast mode for it. Now, bring it into my quarters, its my \ntemporary H.Q.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Hell Beast, on the brdge and giving orders looks to Jackle and Black \nAracnia who were on the systems. The fembot turned to him. :::\n\n::: Black Aracnia ::: Hell Beast, im getting a Predacon signiture in the back \nof the ship, but its not registered.\n\n::: Hell Beast gave a slow frown ::: wheres Megatron?\n\n::: Jackle, already loading his pistol ::: I&#39;ll be more than happy to find \nhim.\n\nOOC: I hope Inferno, or anyone else minds, but I would like to mode Inferno \nand Rampage while hes gone. I wont kill them or damage them.\n\n::: Inferno, in his beast mode lunges forward and knocks Jackle onto the \nfloor ::: I shall find Megatron for the Royalty! You will remain here!\n\n::: Hell Beast ::: Inferno, Jackle, come with me. Rampage, watch the \ncomputers with Black Aracnia.\n\n::: Rampage opened his tired, painful eyes and with his brimstone voice \nreplied, ::: As you wish, Commander. Dont get shot in the back or anything.\n\n::: Hell Beast narrowed his eyes at the moody crab, but moved out with gun in \nhand to find Megatron. :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: Inferno took it apon himself to check Megatron&#39;s quarters first. With his \nflame thrower in hand, he sneaked down the ahll, stopping and looking in all \ndirections with his insanity. He came up to the double sliding doors and ever \nso slightly knocked and then put his audio reciver up to it to listen. :::\n\n::: Inferno ::: Come out, come out......Open the door in the name of the \nRoyalty!\n\n\n"}}
