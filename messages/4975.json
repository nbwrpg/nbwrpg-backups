He saw Scattershot and Nemesis Enforcer \ntransformed and start to take off. Just then it hit him that was an order \nform his leader, and he must carry it out.......for some reason.  It was \nweird to see a bot transform, he wondered why.\n\nHe started to walk out when Zardus warned him of the extreme enegron and \nthat we have developed a shield for it, the transformation you just saw.  \nbut he said he didn&#39;t have time to install it in me, but he did have this \nready.  A enegron force field.  He told me it&#39;s a enegron blocking shield. \nit won&#39;t block and physical and energy attack, but it will block \nenegron...........but the down said it&#39;s un-tested. he told me just to say \n&quot;Field on&quot; and it should work........hopefully.  and with that, i went to \ncatch up with the other two.\n\nProtoform 5 ran at his max speed towards the exit (i know, i know you&#39;re \ngoing to say &quot;but Bill......He doesn&#39;t know the ship that well!!&quot; -_-() deal \nwith it! it&#39;s late, and i got work tomorrow!) and when the ship exit door \nopen he jumped out. &quot;FIELD ON!&quot; he yelled at the top of his speakers.  A \nlight green flash like a sphere surrounded him and dissipated.  He landed  \nright in fount of Nemesis and Scattershot.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
