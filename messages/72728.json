It was\n&gt; no longer under Maximal control.  It would be a situation that Tucson could\n&gt; never handle on his own no matter how strong he is now and how determined he\n&gt; is to set things right.  But being clever was something Nightshift was\n&gt; famous for.  He radios back to Polarclaw via text message.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Guess what, I know why this tower dissed us.  It&#39;s been infested with\n&gt; those giant ugly aft bugs that we ran into at the jungle location.  Brute\n&gt; force might not work but germ warfare will.  See if you guys can drum up\n&gt; someth&#39;n about insectile viruses, and see where we might find out how ta\n&gt; spread one and where ta find the virus spores.  Viruses can spread faster\n&gt; than we can storm a complex, and wipe out an entire colony once an outbreak\n&gt; is established.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He then turns to the honey comb like structure.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I hate bugs.  And after this, the only bugs I wanna see are the ones I can\n&gt; squash under my paws!&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs NIGHTSHIFT sent his message a message blinked on his screen.\n{Message undeliverable, cannot connect to main server. Shall I resend\nwhen server is available?}\n\nYes, the radio had been down since NIGHTSHIFT had left the storage room.\n\nHowever even as that was happening a side door, out of view of the\ninsectile drones, opened slightly, just big enough for for POLAR CLAW\nto look around. It was the door leading to the stairwell.\n\nMeanwhile in the center of the room the honeycomb structure continued\nto glow, getting brighter and brighter. Cables of different sorts led\nfrom it to different parts of the room, presumably they were feeding\npower to it.\n\nFrom the center of the structure the collosal form of the queen came\nout, looking like a strange cross between a spider a wasp and some\nsort of mantis, only with four mantis claws rather than two. She stood\nat nearly 18&#39; tall, three times as large as NIGHTSHIFT and her armored\ncarapase looked thick and durable.\n\nShe looked at NIGHTSHIFT, &quot;So you two have come to crush me under your\nboot?&quot; She peered at NIGHTSHIFT and BATSCOUT. &quot;You are small and\npathetic beings. You have no idea of the power that is my command.&quot;\n\nBehind the queen the honey comb structure began to move and sway\nslightly as it continued to glow. Meanwhile the snow and wind\ncontinued to swirl through the room. The tempeature was getting much\ncolder.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
