He was now in visible range of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; base, and he chuckled his old, evil sounding laugh.

The \nlarge \n&gt; &gt; male hit the door bell and a voice on the other side responded.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Enter Constable.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The door slid opened and the officer stepped in.  The large \noffice \n&gt; &gt; contained many decorations and awards the Admiral had \naccumulated.  \n&gt; &gt; In the center of the room was a large desk, and behind it the \nAdmiral \n&gt; &gt; sat.  He was looking at some new business from the government \nthat \n&gt; &gt; pretained to the fleet.  He tossed the data pad on the pile \nalready \n&gt; &gt; on his desk and looked at the Security officer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I see your mission to Oricron Core was a success.&quot; Hyper \nConvoy \n&gt; &gt; said as he stood and walked to the large window behind him.  &quot;I \ncould \n&gt; &gt; not expect less from you, could I, Megatron Revived?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The large Neo Decepticon stepped forward, the stylized purple \n&gt; &gt; insignia on his chest fully visable.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes it was.  That prisoner was quite a hand full for the \ncrew.  \n&gt; &gt; But overall he was apprehended without bloodshed or incident.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Fleet Admiral smiled and turned to Megatron Revived.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You have served our government and it&#39;s citizens very well \nfor the \n&gt; &gt; past few years.  Our Chief Exectutor, Tyrannis Kaitan, has given \nyou \n&gt; &gt; free reign.  You are basically free to do as you choose.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hyper Convoy turned to Megatron Revived.  He extended his \nright \n&gt; &gt; hand, which Megatron Revived hearily shook.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I hear from your old friend Shockwave, that you brothe and \nsister \n&gt; &gt; are still very much alive.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, the Matrix tells me they live and fight even now, but \n&gt; &gt; someplace I cannot go,&quot; Megaton Revived said, his hand over his \nchest \n&gt; &gt; panels.  Inside his armor exterior, a ornate golden Matrix of \n&gt; &gt; Leadership resided.  Vector Sigma gave this Matrix to the \nDecepticon \n&gt; &gt; Liege Maximo.  But Maximo made the mistake of leaving it \nbehind.  Now \n&gt; &gt; Megatron possesses it, and eventually even the greatLiege will \nsubmit \n&gt; &gt; to justice.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~*~\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Weeks later- Restricted Area MGA-0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Weeks of travelling and bartering and threatening, Megatron \nRevived \n&gt; &gt; was mere meters from the jump point were the Maximals and \nPredacons \n&gt; &gt; jumped to the past and started the Beast Wars.  Also, Rodimus \nPrime \n&gt; &gt; pursued Hydras through this point, and now, he had to go through \nit.  \n&gt; &gt; In his armored gunship mode, Megatron Revived launched a small \n&gt; &gt; transwarp core into the Resticted area.  Undernegth of the ship \nwas \n&gt; &gt; an engine pod with the barrel of the fusion cannon powered to \nlife.  \n&gt; &gt; The transwarp core reached the correct area of spatial \ninstability \n&gt; &gt; and Megatron Revived fired his mightuy fusion cannon, detonating \nthe \n&gt; &gt; core and opened a rift in space time.  he engines touch off, and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; gunship takes off for the rift.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~*~\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Prehistoric Earth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The rift emptied over the north pole of the little blue \nplanet.  \n&gt; &gt; The white and black gunship sits motionless, observing and \ngetting \n&gt; &gt; his bearings.  Unicron was a far distance off, but too close for \n&gt; &gt; comfort.  Megatron began scanning for signs of settlement, and \nfound \n&gt; &gt; the closest to be the Predacon base.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Well, let us harass these so called decendants of the \n&gt; &gt; Decepticons.  I have wondered about them so, let&#39;s see if they \nlive \n&gt; &gt; up to there reputation. /\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The ship changed attitude, and began to enter the atmosphere, \n&gt; &gt; headed for the Predacon base, to cause Chaos and wreak havok.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
