There\n&gt; would be no scaring him off as he stomps a foot down hard wit=\r\nh a loud growl\n&gt; and a snarl on his muzzle.  He meant business.  He was goi=\r\nng to protect the\n&gt; jungle come what may.   Yet there were a few curious an=\r\nimals who did seem\n&gt; comfortable having him there.  One of them being a fal=\r\ncon, and a cougar.\n&gt; They clear the area to give Tucson room to assert his =\r\ndominance among the\n&gt; jungle creatures.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Don&#39;t worry, I will protect y=\r\nou and your jungle.  No hand will lay harm\n&gt; here, I assure you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gi=\r\nves a loud warning roar to the approaching figures.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nA loud answerin=\r\ng roar could be heard in the distance as the shapes\nspeed up their approach=\r\n!\n\nThe other animals that were with TUSCON quickly scatter, all too ready\nt=\r\no leave him alone with whatever was coming to face him. The clearing\nTUSCON=\r\n is standing in is approximately 30=92 wide with little or no tree\ncover an=\r\nd whatever birds that have been in the tree tops flap their\nwings and take =\r\nto the skies in an outpouring of fear. The trees\nthemselves rustle as anima=\r\nls of all sorts vacate! As they do so the\nsound of the approaching shapes g=\r\not steadily louder. Trees crack,\nbrush is uprooted, and the heavy thud of f=\r\neet moving swiftly through\nthe jungle could be clearly heard.\n\nOut of the t=\r\nrees four shapes come lumbering through into the clearing\nwith TUSCON, anot=\r\nher loud roar accompanying their arrival!\n\nThe first to be seen is a large =\r\nTyrannosaurus Rex, standing at 10 and\nmassively built he is as fully as lar=\r\nge and massive as TUSCON himself,\nit takes only a moment to recognize him. =\r\nHis colors are different,\ninstead of the silver and grey paint job of forme=\r\nr times he is black,\ngold and chrome. Other then that he looks exactly like=\r\n a transmetal\nversion of GRIMLOCK!\n\nBehind him came a Triceratops, an Apato=\r\nsaurus and a Stegosaurus all in\nthe same sort of black, gold and chrome tra=\r\nnsmetal motif lumber\nforward, their heavy weight smashing through anything =\r\nin their path:\nSLAG, SLUDGE and SNARL all of them as large as GRIMLOCK!\n\nWi=\r\nth no words save a savage growl GRIMLOCK ran at TUSCON his jaws open\nwide, =\r\nblack teeth ready to rip and shred as the other three transmetal\ndinosaurs =\r\nspread out hoping to get a bite as well.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
