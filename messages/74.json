He could hear wild animal calls such as \nelk, moose, squirel and even a bear, filter in through the trees.\nA light mist had developed among the massive tree trunks, almost making this \nevent seem like out of a horror movie and Tavatron and himself were the \nstars! However, horror was Dinobot&#39;s middle name.\nHe was still following Tavatron&#39;s sent through the trees but it was \nbeginning to get old, which meant that she was gaining ground and was far \nahead of him.\nDinobot kept a watch out, not only for Predacons but also for female bots \nwho decided to circle around and get the drop on him.\nHe snarled when he noticed that Tavatron&#39;s sent had suddenly disappeared, \nnow it was down to the basics in order to track her down.\nDinobot looked around and saw a bent twig, he walked over and sniffed at it. \nTavatron!\nDinobot snarled deeply, she wouldn&#39;t leave such an obvious sign to her \npassing unless...she was toying with him! She was playing a game, the \ntitle... Track Me If You Can!\nSoon the clues would become harder to recognise and eventually disappear, \nthis was probably part of their practice battle.\nDinobot looked up slowly and grinned to himself, he could play this game \ntoo!*\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
