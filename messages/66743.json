Are we in agreement?&quot;\n\nRavenchief, seeing combat was over, moved closer to their position\nwith the two troops.\n\nOn 6/30/07, Nic &lt;warriorazure@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The two reply shots came too fast for Dinobot to dodge. The first hit\n&gt; him right in the chest, while the second whizzed right in his blaster\n&gt; optic. He was pushed upwards in the air and landed heavily on his back.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dinobot: That... [grunt] that was... a good... fight. I concede victory.\n&gt;\n&gt; He hesitantly and slowly got back to a sitting position. His optic was\n&gt; gone, Blasted away by the shot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dinobot: If you would be so kind as to offer me the hospitality of one\n&gt; of your CR chambers, I would be more than grateful. But of course,\n&gt; that will have to wait. As I promised, I have to reveal a lot of\n&gt; things, Perseus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Farther, Doc was itchy with his rifle. He had quickly resighted\n&gt; Dinobot as he went down and did not move the barrel of his weapon by a\n&gt; millimeter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Doc: Rodimus, I really don&#39;t like this guy. We should at least send\n&gt; someone down there with Perseus to handle him in case he tries to pull\n&gt; a trick.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraftlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: Grats!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The first shot missed as he jumped to avoid the first shot.  Perseus\n&gt; &gt; fired two shots back.  The second shot struck him in the chest and he\n&gt; &gt; flew backward falling to the ground.  He tried to stand up before\n&gt; &gt; Dinobot retaliated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
