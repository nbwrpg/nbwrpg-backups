He wasn&#39;t sure \nwhere to go, but he figured that he had better get out of the sky.  \nHe let down gently on a hilltop and started running full speed \ntoward the base, hoping that the hills would block the enemies&#39; \nfire. \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Ravenchief to all maximals in range....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Salveo here, we&#39;re on our way back to the base, Guardia is with \nus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Good... that&#39;s one less thing to worry about.  One slight \nproblem, I have the angry mob right behind me, if they catch up to \nme... I probably wont be seeing you again.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;I know this is a lot to ask, but since you&#39;re there, would you \nmind leading them away from the base.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;These are Unicronians, I&#39;m pretty sure they know where our base \nis.  Lets get back there and fire up the turrets... I wont come to \nthe base until everyone&#39;s safely inside, ok?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Rodger... I&#39;ll keep trying to get in contact with Lord Perseus \nand the others.   Until then, just worry about yourself.... get back \nsafely.  Salveo out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Ravencheif continued running as fast as possible....\n\n\n\n"}}
