She didn&#39;t know the bots who were \nso far, helping htem out.  Usually when one helped, they expected the \nfavor returned, and with more in return than what was offered.  She \nlooked at Phobia,&quot;Tell me, who is this Destrustor?  And why did he \nhelp us? No Pred would just help and expect nothing in return. Also, \nif Megatron is without followers, who does that leave us with? I \nheard that most of our groups is gone.&quot;  She looked down and \nsighed. &quot;I know that I can only trust you and Drillbit right now.&quot;\nShe looked up at Phobia.  &quot;I think it would be best if we takled to \nthis Desctuctor. Then we need to get our group together.  I  know I&quot;m \nnot the only one who wants to get Megatron for deserting us.  And \nonce Megatron is done with, we can then start looking for a base of \nour own.  BUt Megatron has to be delt with. As long as he is around, \nwe will never have a moment&#39;s rest.  After that,&quot; she suddenly had an \nangry look on her face,&quot;After that, I want to pay back those slagging \nmaximals.&quot; She relaxed, &quot;What do you think Phobia?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re currently at the base of a Predacon named Destrucror, \n&gt; Starscreem went ahead to the alliance base, Goldeneye and Dollen \nare \n&gt; considering returning to us and Megatron is currently without \n&gt; followers I suggest we meet the alliance, track him down and take \n&gt; care of our problems one at a time.&quot; Phobia knew to leave out the \n&gt; part about Destructors offer so he&#39;d have an ace in the hole if \nthis \n&gt; fell through. He didn&#39;t fully trust Destructor yet and KitKats \n&gt; trusting ways may get in the way of earning that trust.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
