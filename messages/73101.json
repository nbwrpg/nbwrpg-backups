Size i=\r\ns not everything.   But cunning can be.&quot;\n\nWhile in flight, Tucson breaks of=\r\nf a stalactite and attempts to lodge it in between Magmatrons sword arm, at=\r\n the shoulder joint!

GET OUTA HERE IF YA KNOW THAT&#39;S\n&gt;&gt; GOOD FOR YA!  &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\nNEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; QUICKSTRIDE=E2=80=99s hooves are used to good affect as two of th=\r\ne hordes of\n&gt; SHARKTICONS are taken out, the hard surface of his hooves pen=\r\netrating\n&gt; their armor and into their internal structures. Both of them fal=\r\nl to\n&gt; the ground, their systems failing as they did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; However there=\r\n are more right behind, ever ready to take the place of\n&gt; their fallen comr=\r\nades. Horseflies may indeed be an applicable\n&gt; illustration of their attack=\r\n method, if Horseflies were as large as\n&gt; you were and had large teeth that=\r\n could easily penetrate your armor as\n&gt; well. However just like the proverb=\r\nial horsefly they were easy to\n&gt; kill, but unfortunately there are always m=\r\nore!\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same RAT TRAP is also facing his share of these creaturs a=\r\ns\n&gt; they were able to fly and swoop and maneuver in ways that they never\n&gt; =\r\nseemed to be able to do before.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; DINOBOT paused.  The SHA=\r\nRKTICONS seemed to be barely sentient, but reliant\n&gt;&gt; upon a general to giv=\r\ne them orders ni battle and direct them.  However, the\n&gt;&gt; GENERAL seemed to=\r\n be content to hold back, and fighting him directly would\n&gt;&gt; require simult=\r\naneously engaging him AND his forces.  The DINOBOT of old\n&gt;&gt; would have rel=\r\nished such a challenge, but for this new incarnation, &#39;honor&#39;\n&gt;&gt; was the la=\r\nst thing on his processor.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Going to try and engage the SHARKTICONS g=\r\nroup by gruop, attempting to thin\n&gt;&gt; down thier numbers with hit and run ta=\r\nctics, counting that the groups would\n&gt;&gt; be trying to pursue them to just o=\r\nverwhelm with numbers, and thus running\n&gt;&gt; into one another and messing up =\r\ntheir formations with each hit and run\n&gt;&gt; attack of his own, trying to thin=\r\n the herd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DINOBOT is reasonably astute in his assessment o=\r\nf the situation, at\n&gt; least as far as he could see it. SKYBYTE did seem to =\r\nbe giving them\n&gt; general direction and impetus. While he was not controllin=\r\ng them by\n&gt; remote control or on an individual basis, he was acting as a gu=\r\niding\n&gt; force in matters, directing them to where the MAXIMAL and PREDACON\n=\r\n&gt; forces were the weakest and exploiting what he could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using his supe=\r\nrior speed and armor DINOBOT is able to begin the act of\n&gt; thinning their n=\r\number as his hit and run tactics are beginning to have\n&gt; an impact on the S=\r\nHARKTICONS!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was of a different mind=\r\nset, just going to charge in\n&gt;&gt; directly over towards SKYBYTE!  Of course, =\r\nthis would lead his charge right\n&gt;&gt; through the main cluster of SHARKTICONS=\r\n, and give them a golden opportunity\n&gt;&gt; to dogpile (or sharkpile) on him..\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; SKYBYTE blinked as he noted VICE GRIP moving straight through the\n&gt; SH=\r\nARKTICONS coming straight at him. In a quick move he has the\n&gt; SHARKTICONS =\r\nconverge on his position in an effort to pile up on the\n&gt; approaching VICE =\r\nGRIP!\n&gt; \n&gt; However that maneuver also has the affect of further thinning ou=\r\nt the\n&gt; ranks as they focused on the center. It is at that point that the\n&gt;=\r\n MAXIMAL FUZORS begin to act, their teeth and claws ripping through the\n&gt; S=\r\nHARKTICONS, spreading out and attacking left and right creating an\n&gt; explos=\r\nion of confusion that SKYBYTE was having trouble directing.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Tucson continues to step forth to face Magmatron.  With no f=\r\near,\n&gt;&gt; just the courage he was programmed with, he takes a brave step forw=\r\nard.  He\n&gt;&gt; holds his hand back to Leo and Big Convoy.  It was clear that h=\r\ne wanted to\n&gt;&gt; fight him on his own, knowing that it was his idea to come t=\r\nhis far and he\n&gt;&gt; alone had to complete the journey.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Leo, Convoy, =\r\nhelp Optimus, I will deal with Magmatron.  I started this\n&gt;&gt; journey, now I=\r\n must complete it.    Very well Magmatron you have your\n&gt;&gt; battle. &quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n He takes his Martial Arts stance, and prepares to go one on one with\n&gt;&gt; Ma=\r\ngmatron.  And hopefully win back what the Silver Dragon had fought for so\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; many years .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; LEO PRIME and BIG CONVOY nod, =E2=80=9CBe careful. .=\r\n . he is probrably the\n&gt; most dangerous foe here and I would guess the most=\r\n dangerous one you\n&gt; have ever met.=E2=80=9D They quickly take off towards =\r\nOPTIMUS!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile MAGMATRON smiled, =E2=80=9CSo you sent off your bac=\r\nkup? How unwise\n&gt; of you.=E2=80=9D He chuckled as he looked down at TUSCON =\r\nas MAGMATRON stood at\n&gt; nearly twice TUSCON&#39;s height. =E2=80=9CI have been =\r\nfighting since long before\n&gt; you were a pulse in you your creation matrix&#39;s=\r\n thought process.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at TUSCON, =E2=80=9CYou believe t=\r\nhat you have skills.=E2=80=9D MAGMATRON=E2=80=99s\n&gt; chuckle was becoming op=\r\nen derisive laughter, =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t realize just\n&gt; how little =\r\nyou have.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; With a forward sweep he slashed forward with a swor=\r\nd that was about\n&gt; the same size as TUSCON himself!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the background =\r\nDARK RODIMUS and RODIMUS were still in battle\n&gt; pushing themselves to the l=\r\nimit as each kick and punch was met with an\n&gt; equally skilled counter attac=\r\nk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guard, Perry, Thrust!\n&gt; \n&gt; Their steps taking them ever closer to t=\r\nhe form of OPTIMUS who hung\n&gt; over the pit!\n&gt; \n&gt; However at the same time S=\r\nKYSHADOW and his FUZORS had fought their way\n&gt; through the crowd of SHARKTI=\r\nCONS and were also making their own way to\n&gt; OPTIMUS, their optics looking =\r\nat him greedily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile in the far corner, against the wall, away f=\r\nrom the battle at\n&gt; large, the dark form of CRYOTEK was beginning to stir a=\r\nnd his cold\n&gt; crimson optics snapped back as he head rose and looked around=\r\n.
