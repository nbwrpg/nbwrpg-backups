It felt warm \nand comforting.  She felt cold, but who ever was petting her, she \nwould thank later on.  It made her feel good in knowing that this \nwasn&#39;t all a dream, but that she really was alive.  She sniffed the \nair and recognized the scent, BlackAracnia.  She would thank her \nlater when she was able to.  She tried to open her eyes and move her \nbody, but it wouldn&#39;t respond to her.  She heard her spark slow it&#39;s \nthundering down to a steady normal pace.\n\n\n"}}
