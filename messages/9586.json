You see, Rampage has rejected my advice to let me rule \nthe \n&gt; Predacon as I always have. This could be very useful in gaining \nback my \n&gt; army. We should go there soon to Hell Beast&#39;s ship and claim it by \nforce.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But boss,&quot; Quickstrike objected. &quot;We ain&#39;t all here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron turned his head and glowered at the little bot. &quot;Then \nwhere are the \n&gt; others?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: cyberwolf4@p...\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 01 Aug 2000 22:07:02 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;It has been a while since you left cybertron, The weapon you hold \nis\n&gt; &gt;a new model Predacon Decimator rifle, it has single beam and pulse\n&gt; &gt;capabilities that can cut enemies like tin plate.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;Phobia knows Megatron expects nothing but the best. &quot;In a raid on a\n&gt; &gt;Maximal settlement I hit a Maximal point blank.
