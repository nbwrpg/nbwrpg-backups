On instinct programming he \ntransformed into robot mode, and lied there, unmoving, eyes shut. \nThere were no more energon surges going through him, but he seemed \nquite dead. \n&gt; \n&gt;        That&#39;s when the hunger took over, his eyes whipped open, to \nreveal a new colour. His optics, which were normally light blue, had \nturned a frightening blood red. The colour almost illuminated the \nroom. When Vampirtron spole, it was with a slight modification to his \nvocal center, his voice was deeper and almost seemed to echo. \n&gt; \n&gt;        &quot;Activating Mayfair Recording,&quot; He said, in a very flat \ntone. Then his voice picked up emotions that weren&#39;t his own, &quot;Ahh, \ngreetings,&quot; He said in a chipper voice, &quot;I see you have found my pet. \nWell, isn&#39;t this a golden opportunity? I think it is. What can I tell \nyou about Experiment 666? Well, he has no spark for one, but \nironically, one of the most compasionate transformers I&#39;ve ever met. \nHow does he stay alive? Well, he feeds on other transformers. How \ndoes he make this process happen? Well, if this recording has been \nactivated, I think you&#39;re all going to get a personal demonstration.&quot; \nVampirtron sat unmoving still, &quot;End of Mayfair Recording.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;        Vampirtron sat still for a few more seconds, but then leaped \nup towards the nearest person, Nightlight. He opened his mouth wide \nin midair, and huge canine teeth extended, with little drills at the \nend. His claws extended and he reached out to grab her... \n&gt; \n&gt;    RoboRick007 wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt;     : :  Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; \n&gt;     Rodimus Prime: Ok, just tell me what you need when you need it. \nI want to see Vampirtron not in pain.\n&gt;       ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;       From: airly2000 \n&gt;       To: nbwrpg@y... \n&gt;       Sent: Saturday, August 17, 2002 2:01 AM\n&gt;       Subject: Re: Artifact 1\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Nightlight::\n&gt; \n&gt;       Nighlight looked to Rodimus and said &quot;it seems that all it&#39;s \nall \n&gt;       right, but perhaps we might need a hand&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       --- In nbwrpg@y..., RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt;       &gt; \n&gt;       &gt; Rodimus walks into the med room where Nightlight and \nVampirtron are.\n&gt;       &gt; \n&gt;       &gt; Rodimus Prime: How are things going?
