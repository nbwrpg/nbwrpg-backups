He smiles as \nhe remembers the last time he had carried her like this, when he had been to \ndistracted by her to notice a shot heading at him, which later caused him to \ncrash. He wouldn&#39;t let that happen this time. As good as she smelled, and he \nalways liked the smell of her, and the feel of her body against his. His mind \nwanders to the time in her quarters, which was distracted by a Predacon \nattack.\n\nA missile barely misses him, scattering his thoughts. Prowl quickly does a \nspiral in the air, several more shots going past him.\n\n&quot;Hold on tight,&quot; he says to Iron Raptor, hoping she wasn&#39;t being serious \nabout her stomach. He looks back, the Alliance base still visible, and the \nbots pursuing them even more so.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nReptilica flies after Prowl, firing at and missing the Maximal. He looks \nbehind him at the others flying at Prowl: Scattershot and Breakdown, also \nfiring. Reptilica&#39;s eyes widen as he sees a missile nearly hit the Maximal, \nthe Alliance bot looking at the owner of the shot. That was a Predacon!\n\n&quot;Zardus,&quot; Reptilica says into his comm-link, &quot;There are Predacons attacking \nthe Maximals we&#39;re following. What should we do?&quot;\n\n&quot;Are they Megatron&#39;s?&quot; Zardus&#39; voice replies.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not sure these ones were on H-&quot; Reptilica is interrupted as a \nconcentrated spray of acid barely misses him, Mosquitor flying out of the \ntrees and screaming insanely.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re opening fire, Zardus!&quot; Reptilica yells into his comm-link, flying \nleft as several drops of acid hit his armor.\n\n&quot;Then kill them,&quot; Zardus&#39; voice replies, &quot;Both the Maximals and the \nPredacons.&quot;\n\n&quot;You heard him,&quot; Reptilica says into his comm-link to the others as he shoots \ndown at Mosquitor, &quot;Fire at will.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScattershot frowns as he hears Reptilica&#39;s voice. He didn&#39;t remember a bot \nnamed Will in the Predacon forces. He looks down, shrugging. He hoped that \nthe Predacon he saw would do, or maybe that was Will!\n\nScattershot takes out a charge, set to explode on impact, and throws it down \nat Double Punch.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHiss frowns as he hears Reptilica&#39;s message. Activating his thrusters and \nflying into the air, he changes course from Dinobot, firing at Manterror.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBloodystrike and Pyro continue to run at Dinobot, firing, while Scavanger \nfollows Hiss, firing at Bumblebee.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark One opens his eyes. He was in a puddle of mech fluid, on his chest, in \nthe torture chamber. His back hurt like it was stabbed through by the claws \nof a giant lizard. He grabs on to a table, getting up. Using various objects \nfor support, Dark One exits the torture chambers, heading toward the CR room.\n\n"}}
