Caught a bit awkwardly=\r\n, he replies.\n\n&quot;Oh, Lord Elder, thanks for the report.  I&#39;m sure Nightshift=\r\n is in control of his situation and if anything does go wrong I have confid=\r\nence that he&#39;ll do the right thing.  I say let him move in slowly to reduce=\r\n the amount of suspicion.. And I was just on my - way to interrogate Nights=\r\ntrike..  I feel that if I can get an angle from the Unicronian&#39;s side I may=\r\n be able to piece everything together...&quot;\n\nHe could not keep his mind off o=\r\nf Talon.  His heart beating twice as fast as before.  Yet he tries to keep =\r\nhis composure while conversing with Lord Elder.\n\n&quot; I know this is a bit of =\r\na shot in the dark, and if it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t work.  But I&#39;m almos=\r\nt certain that if I can get the full scope of what&#39;s going on, I may be abl=\r\ne to take care of things on all fronts, or at least meet with everyone to s=\r\nee how we can all remedy this situation.  It&#39;s gonna be a group effort but =\r\nany information I can get, will help us immensely.  All right thats it in a=\r\n lugnut Lord Elder, I&#39;m off - to question Nighstrike.. Tucson Prime out.&quot;\n\n=\r\nHe looks to Talon.\n\n&quot;Now, where were we?  Oh, I remember..  I - don&#39;t think=\r\n they&#39;ll mind if we take a little detour...&quot;\n\nHe finds a storage room and o=\r\npens the door to it, gently escorting Talon inside.  As he had done with Ni=\r\nghtstrike, he closes the door so they can be alone.\n\n&quot; Sorry, this is the b=\r\nest I can do as far as privacy.  I have to admit, I&#39;ve never actually spent=\r\n time alone with anyone...  Wow, I&#39;ve heard of power surges but I&#39;ve never =\r\nhad any quite like the ones - I&#39;m having now..&quot; \n\nWithout completely thinki=\r\nng, and giving in to his passion for Talon, Tucson takes Talon into his arm=\r\ns and gives her a kiss on her lips and holds here there for a good long tim=\r\ne in an intimate embrace.  All the while the tires on his ankles spinning i=\r\nn elation.  \n\nRat Trap hears a slight tire screech coming from the storage =\r\ncloset.\n\n&quot; Ahh, the sound of screechn&#39; tires.  Love is in the air.&quot;\n\nHe dar=\r\nts up to Depthcharge and the others.\n\n&quot; Um, wait up fellas, I think Wheels&#39;=\r\nn Talon took a little detour.  They should be along shorty.&quot;\n\nWithout knowi=\r\nng, Tucson had not fully closed off his com link to Lord Elder, as the soun=\r\nd of the screech of his tires reaches the base with a bit of a &quot;Screee.&quot;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: lets said that he is knocked out and in place in custody\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nOC: Sounds good to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; **************************************\n&gt; \n&gt; Who=\r\n: Legacy\n&gt; Location: Old Maximal Base - makeshift stockade\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy stoo=\r\nd watching the form of Nightstrike, his single optic\n&gt; pulsing impassively =\r\nfor a moment as if trying to decide what to do\n&gt; with the Minion.
