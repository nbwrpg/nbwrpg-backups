Enough to see by, but not truly bright by any\nstandards.\n\nFinally the hall opened into a giant chasm, easily 100 meters across.\nHowever it&#39;s width that gave its size, it was its depth.\n\n&quot;This was once a great thermal vent dear Lamia, but it has been put to\nbetter uses.&quot; Marauder spoke, his voice betraying a bit of pride and\naccomplishment. &quot;There was a time when volcanic rock poured through\nthis very channel that we walked, flowing out onto the surface of the\nground. But now its power is banked and curbed and channeled to our\nown uses.&quot; Maurader laughed.\n\n&quot;Sir.&quot; came a voice out of the crimson gloom from up ahead. &quot;It is\ngood to see you have returned. All is nearly in readiness.&quot;\n\nAs the voice spoke a figure stepped out of the shadows, obviously\nhaving come from somewhere further in the chasm. His armored chassis\nwas predominantly purple and black, although it was difficult to make\nout the hue in the strange redness of the area. A large insectile head\nmade up the figure&#39;s broad and powerful chest while insect-like wings\nwere folded down his back, giving him a regal, almost kingly visage.\n\n&quot;You have done well!&quot; Marauder said as he looked approvingly upon the figure.\n\nThe figure nodded, a slight smile appearing on his face, and then he\nturned his head as his optics fell on Lamia. He looked at her\ncuriously as he steped further into the light. He was not overly tall,\nbut although he was deferential to Marauder, there was still something\nabout him that was commanding as more of his form was revealed.\n\n&quot;Ahh yes.&quot; Marauder said magnanimously, &quot;Where are my manners?&quot; he\nsmiled as he stepped back slightly, &quot;Lamia, meet Dirge, my second in\ncommand here. &quot; Maruader gestured at Lamia, &quot;Dirge meet Lamia, she is\nanother of the Minions to have found her way back home.&quot;\n\nMaruader nodded as he looked at both of them in satisfaction,\n&quot;Together, with the legions we are ready to build, we will bring this\nplanet to its knees! and will serve the might of UNICRON&quot; Mauraduer\nlaughed evilly, &quot;BWHAHAHAHA!!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\nOOC: I will be putting up a profile soon :)\n\n"}}
