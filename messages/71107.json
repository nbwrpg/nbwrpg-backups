Ku=\r\np was able to hit Scourge with a few glancing\n&gt; blows, but Scourge was made=\r\n of sterner stuff, and continued to rain down\n&gt; fire on Kup.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; De=\r\nepstryke on the other hand was built like a tank. He was definitely\n&gt; NOT b=\r\nuilt for manuverablity, but he was heavily armored. Like a cross\n&gt; between =\r\na gun emplacement and a satellite Deepstryke took a few hits from\n&gt; Windlor=\r\nd, but he kept returning fire with his powerful and precise cannons.\n&gt; Howe=\r\nver for the moment Windlord seemed to be successful in keeping\n&gt; Deepstryke=\r\n from following Hydras towards the Ark!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n He [Tuscon] slams a foot down hard, and at the same time, lets loose\n&gt; ano=\r\nther round of formidable sonar waves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There w=\r\nas no sound or movement in or near the room with Tuscon and\n&gt; Straight Shot=\r\n, however there was a new wave of sparks that ran through the\n&gt; Ark&#39;s syste=\r\nms as once again Tuscon&#39;s wave wreaks havoc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no sign o=\r\nf the intruder with Tuscon, however a weak signal does\n&gt; appear in the fron=\r\nt chamber, the very same chamber that held the font door,\n&gt; as well as the =\r\nfallen Autobots and Decepticons! It would seem that the\n&gt; intruder has used=\r\n his time wisely and was attempting to make a fast get\n&gt; away!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMeanwhile Hydras received a message from Deepstryke, &quot;Sir. I am\n&gt; detecting=\r\n a wave harmonic affect emanating from within the Ark.&quot; Deepstryke\n&gt; was of=\r\n course talking about the wave Tuscon was emimitting. &quot;Shall I attempt\n&gt; to=\r\n counter it?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile back inside the Ark:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Elit=\r\na squeezed Ramulu&#39;s hand and asaid quietly &quot;I want my mommie... I\n&gt; want he=\r\nr back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as well as my dad&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I will get=\r\n you to her as soon as I can. Come.&quot; Romulus said. His voice\n&gt; was guff, un=\r\nused to speaking to young Autobots. Turning to look around for a\n&gt; moment h=\r\ne glanced back at Elita. &quot;We have to get you to safety. &quot;Stay behind\n&gt; me.&quot;=\r\n He took off at a slow jog down one of the side hallways, occasionally\n&gt; lo=\r\noking back to be sure that Elita was keeping up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then Romulus s=\r\ntopped as he came to be standing over two dark shapes\n&gt; lying on the floor.=\r\n &quot;Oh dear Primus!&quot; he said. He looked back at Elita,\n&gt; shock and fear in hi=\r\ns optics, &quot;Stay back. You don&#39;t need to see this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
