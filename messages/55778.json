He \nwondered \n&gt; &gt; what Tyrael was up to. He hadn&#39;t heard back from his new leader. \nAnd \n&gt; &gt; Kaiser, his supposed new general hadn&#39;t called upon him either. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; was getting frustrated. He wanted action and a chance to seek \nrank. \n&gt; &gt; Not rust to pieces in his room. He got up and wandered the halls. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; found the main communications room and sat down. He picked up the \n&gt; &gt; scanner headset and put it on. Next, he started to adjust some of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; dials to start picking up most predacon frequencies and some of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; maximal frequencies. He listened to the scanner and hoped he \nwould \n&gt; &gt; find out what was going on.\n\n\n"}}
