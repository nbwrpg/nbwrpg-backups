She heard him, her sensory system was \n&gt; strong. She smirked. At least her memories were still with her. For\nsome \n&gt; reason, instead of wanting to rip him to shreads, she just smirked.\nShe felt \n&gt; alone still. Kindred souls may be upon this planet, but she still\nfelt alone. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Plans started to form in her head. \n&gt; \n&gt; She padded out of the crashed shuttle, stepping outside. She glanced\nabout. \n&gt; &quot;This.. is the mudball Earth?&quot; A little disappointed. It was more to\nherself, \n&gt; she didn&#39;t expect an answer. \n&gt; \n&gt; She glanced at Ragnar. &quot;Which way, Autobot?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
