Just got done with 741 e-mails. A lots happened. Any way, I&#39;ll \npost a little history as to what has happened with my characters, first and \nforemost Primal..ahem...May I say Optimus Prime?\n\n::Primal Prime::\n\n    Before the first fight at the Cybertronian Fire Primal had another \nvision. In this one everything became clear. He knows knew who is is, and \nwhat he must do.\n    &quot;Computer, scan area for unit Hot Rod,&quot; Prime said to his internal \ncomputer system. The computer fed him the location. (Not sure exactly, so I&#39;m \njust gonna head in that general direction) Prime transformed to Ground \nAssault Mode and started to race to Hot Rod.\n    &quot;Hot Rod, Hot Rod. This is Optimus Prime, I need to speak with you,&quot; \nPrime said, now with a full Optimus Prime voice.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Cheetor::\n\n    He had fired several shots at the Predacons, but all missed, he needed \npractice. He went inside the ship and went to a training facility. He has \nbeen there for quite some time now.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Bobertron::\n\n    After trying to help the Maximals, he saw on the scanners that a \nDeception shuttle was leaving. He had it scanned and found that it contained \nthe one known as Hell Beast. He now figured that it would be much easier to \ncrush the Predacons, with the numbers weakened.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Pantron::\n\n    After walking endlessly for weeks (He still won&#39;t be back for a while) he \nfigured out the riddle. He found a natural bridge with many fossils around \nit. Looking around he found the Key to the Ark. Something deep inside him \nfelt it would be wrong to give it to Bobertron, and that if Bobertron ever \nfound out he would be scrap.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n::Magmatron::\n\n    The Drake left his cave to return to his home. He sensed a shift in the \npower struggles of the planet. His biggest threat had returned from the \ngrave. Flying as fast as his new wings could carry him, he reached the \nDestron base in a matter of minutes (before he had relatively small wings, \nnow they are huge, you do the math). He transformed to Robot mode, it was an \nimpressive on indeed. He stood well over what he used to. As soon as he \nwalked into the base he had all controls transferred to him. He now was the \nbase, in all aspects. Anybody that was as intimately connected to the base \nwas fodder compared to what he was. Returning to one of his Labs he opened a \ndrawer. In it was a small spider robot. He held it up and looked at it. His \nhand glowed a bright crimson red....\n\n"}}
