Though I lack the colors of a humming bird, I thank \nyou for you kind words.&quot;\nShe hoped that would get to him. &quot;I would love to spar with you my \nbeloved friend. But as you can most likely tell, you have the upper \nhand.  Since I can not out muscle you, I an trying to make you use \nanother muscle.

By throwing the rocks \nwith \n&gt; her beak she&#39;d lost much of her accuracy. It landed about three \nfeet \n&gt; to his left. By hiding herself in the foliage she&#39;d given up most \nof \n&gt; her flying advantages. How to get up to where she was on the other \n&gt; hand, was Lunarpines main disadvantage. She thought out her \nstrategy \n&gt; well this time. If he could teach her to use those skills in a real \n&gt; battle she would easily survive every time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If I&#39;d wanted to fight rocks then I wouldn&#39;t have needed a \nsparring \n&gt; partner. So Come out and fight you overstuffed hummingbird.&quot; he was \n&gt; hoping to rattle her nerves, make her stop thinking for a few \n&gt; seconds. A wolf can&#39;t climb trees, but a bot can, all he needed was \n&gt; for her to lose her temper and give him an opening.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
