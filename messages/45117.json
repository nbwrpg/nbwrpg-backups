And X-Box is coming out with the sweet looking\n&gt; &#39;WWF Raw Is War&#39;.\n&gt; Anyway I just wanted to add my 2 cents!\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes the PS/PS2 WWF Smackdown series sucks!\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nBuy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
