He was angry. Even if this bot \ndidn&#39;t know where Megatron was, she must have known something. Why \ndid Inferno want her to go to Arachnia when he worked for Megatron? \nIt made no sense! Unless.....By the Matrix! That&#39;s it! Megatron&#39;s \ngoal was to untie the Preds, and he must have made a treaty with \nArachnia! Now she comes in here and merges groups and sends all our \nplans to Megatron! She must be stopped! Starscream left and burst \ninto the conference room.\n\n&quot;KitKat, stop! Arachnia is a fraud! She is working for Megatron!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
