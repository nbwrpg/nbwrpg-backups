Tell me how this is for a first post and new character.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[Ganthrax]\n\nGanthrax was settling down by a lake, watching the night stars.  The water \nglimmered from the moonlight.  Ganthrax&#39;s dark body could only be seen by \nhis glowing red optics.  He walked up to the edge of the lake, and looked at \nhis reflection.  He thought to himself, Earth was wonderful.  Marvelous.  \nGanthrax went over by some trees, and went to sleep, his red optics getting \ndimmer and dimmer.  So much beauty, so many things to see, so many bots to \nkill.  Yes, Earth was wondeful.\n\n(Did I do okay?
