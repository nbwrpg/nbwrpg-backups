It would be\nsuicide \nto  stay, but if Dinobot chose to stay and fight she would stand \nbeside him. She wasn&#39;t about to abandon him now. She watched as \nDinobot fired off multiple shots at the aproaching Alliance. Tavatron \ngrowled softly, if they were going to battle then so be it. She \nunsheathed her sword and began to fire multiple optic blasts in the \ngeneral direction of the approaching &#39;bots. Tavatron almost didn&#39;t \nnotice when Dinobot transformed, her attention being directed \nelsewhere. When Dinobot spoke her head snapped in his direction. He \nwanted her to ride him? Well, there&#39;s a first time for everything. \nTavatron quickly climbed aboard Dinobot, wrapping her arms about the \nbase of his reptilian neck. She layed her head against his back and \nwaited for him to start running:\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
