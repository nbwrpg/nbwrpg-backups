Wolves don&#39;t fly.)\n\nwell anyway, Lunarpine exits the pod, The green jungle of Tibet \nnearly hypnotized him. The green was a surprisingly nice change from \nwhat he was usedto. the myriad of smells told him he would eat well \nhere. \n\nLunarpine followed Shadow Wing toward the Ark.\n\n&quot;So how longs it been since your last visit?&quot;He asked hoping they&#39;d \nremember her.He&#39;d hate to be greeted by gunfire.--- In \nnbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Logo morph&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (didn&#39;t realize we made it to the pod that fast or that I had the \ncontrols \n&gt; already.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She transformed into bot mode and hopped in.  She took the Controls \nand \n&gt; started up the pod.  It jumped across the oceans in a few minutes.  \nThe pod \n&gt; landed on a mountain near the Ark.\n&gt; &quot;Well, we&#39;re here.&quot; She jumped out and looked at Lunarpine. &quot;It&#39;s \nnot much, \n&gt; but it&#39;s liveable.&quot;\n&gt; She started to walk to the Ark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message----\n&gt; From:   &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri Jun 30, 2000 9:16pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The transport pod lowered to grant Lunarpine access. He stepped in\n&gt; with a quick gracefull leap.\n&gt; Lunarpine thought about the three questions that must go through\n&gt; every transformers CPU when they&#39;re reformatted: What have I become?\n&gt; Why are we here?and most of all Will I change when the other two\n&gt; questions are answered?\n&gt; \n&gt; He looked at Shadowwing at the controls, he saw how natural it\n&gt; appeared, and with the word &quot;MAXIMIZE&quot; he transformed and took a \nseat\n&gt; at her left.\n&gt; Something about the panel brought back memories, he remembered a\n&gt; similar situation with him at navigation.The memory was vague, but \nit\n&gt; was there. He looked back at Shadowwing and said &quot;well this is\n&gt; it.Lets fly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With one last glance outside Lunarpine couldn&#39;t help thinking &quot;Hope\n&gt; I&#39;m ready for the Maximals again: But are the Maximals ready for \nme.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n__\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
