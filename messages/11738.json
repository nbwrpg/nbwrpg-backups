She fnished her apple and tossed the core away in \nthe trash.  She started eating a peach.  She hoped the leader of this \ngroup would call on her soon so she could speak her case.  She \nstarted thinking of Cybershark.  She hoped he was having better luck \nthatn she was.  Turned her head around and looked at the empty room. \nShe sighed. She was beginnning to feel like she was failing at her \nmission.  She was feeling like this was would never end. That is \nwould go on forever. She got a scent going by the room. Firearm, \nthat&#39;s who it reminded her of.  She looked but no one was around.\n\nShe got up, still nibling on the peach.  She picked up three more \napples and decided to walk over to the bridge. She figured she had \nfound bots there every other time she went to the bridge, why should \nthis time be different.  If she found someone, she at least could ask \nto see if the leader had arrived yet.  She strolled down the hallway \ntowards the bridge.\n\n\n"}}
