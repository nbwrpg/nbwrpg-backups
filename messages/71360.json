He who says how he sh=\r\nould be said, more often than not\n&gt; &gt; ends up shot in the head!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wh=\r\neelie skittering about the room, &quot;Now, what I say may not be the right\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthing to do.  But talkign like you know it all makes it no better than you!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Here you arei n hte past, and doiing things to leave the rest of us ag=\r\nhast!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Old - Leo Prime/SuperCyc NPC&#39;s&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As WHEELIE moved about th=\r\ne room, TUSCON was getting angry and WINDLORD\n&gt; left it completely the meet=\r\ning was getting disrupted.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Wheelie!&quot; LEO PRIME said from the stage, &quot;=\r\nOur job is to help. Not\n&gt; everyone was brought here by choice or for the sa=\r\nme reason. Some crash\n&gt; landed, some traveled here to help with the threat =\r\nof Unicron and his\n&gt; minions.&quot; He gave WHEELIE and TUSCON a look, &quot;We are a=\r\nll here to\n&gt; help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; RODIMUS PRIME stepped up behind WHEELIE, or as clo=\r\nse as he could get\n&gt; to the fast moving robot, and if possible laid a frien=\r\ndly hand on his\n&gt; shoulder. &quot;Calm down, we are all friends here right?&quot; Wit=\r\nh that last\n&gt; word RODIMUS looked at TUSCON as well to be sure that he got =\r\nthe point\n&gt; to cool down on his famous temper.\n&gt; \n&gt; LEO was on the stage lo=\r\noking sternly across the floor as he gripped\n&gt; the podium, dealing with ang=\r\ner issues of his own. &quot;This is NOT going\n&gt; to solve our issues.&quot; He glanced=\r\n at KUP, TUSCON, WHEELIE and a few\n&gt; others, &quot;Everyone, please retake your =\r\nseats.&quot; He said in a firm voice\n&gt; in an effort to get the meeting back unde=\r\nr control.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking over at LORD ELDER, LEO PRIME gestured, &quot;If you wou=\r\nld go see\n&gt; about Windlord?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ELDER nodded as he got up from his seat w=\r\nalked towards the same exit\n&gt; of the room that WINDLORD had just used.\n\n&lt;OL=\r\nD - Tuscon & Friends&gt;\n\nTucson&#39;s expression doesn&#39;t change .  In fact it see=\r\nmed to become rather fierce as if he had a mortal enemy in front of him.  H=\r\nis words were  being contradicted and that was one of his greatest pet peev=\r\nes.  At any moment it seemed that he would easily thrust an angry fist clea=\r\nr through the table but he restrains himself from doing so.  Straight Shot =\r\nlooks at Wheelie with a bit of concern.\n\n&quot; Ohh boy, Wheelie I think you bet=\r\nter not lash out at Tucson any more.  First of, he&#39;s a Prime, and we never =\r\ncontradict a prime.  Second, his bite is as bad as his bark.  Just picture =\r\nRatchet but a thousand times worse&quot; .  Third, keep it up and he will send y=\r\nou through walls effortlessly. &quot;\n\nNight Shift nods in agreement. &quot;\n\n&quot; Oh ye=\r\nah, she&#39;s got that right.  I&#39;ve seen what happens when ya cross Tucson&#39;s li=\r\nne.  And you&#39;re just a toe length away from feel&#39;n his fury.&quot;\n\nTucson turns=\r\n his attentions to the group. \n\n&quot; I may be blind but I&#39;m not without logic =\r\ncircuitry.  Leo Prime called this meeting to discuss matters of importance,=\r\n not for singling out comrades and commanders for ridicule!  Now if one mor=\r\ne shred of ridicule is thrown out on this table, I will demand that the ind=\r\nividual responsible, be escorted out of this room IMMEDIATELY!  THAT IS AN =\r\nORDER!&quot;\n\nHis fist goes down hard on the table, causing it to vibrate.  Rat =\r\nTrap straightens up on his chair as he pays close attention to Tucson.\n\n&quot; U=\r\nlp, yep, he&#39;s mad, really, really mad.&quot;\n\n\n&lt;NEW - Wheelie&gt;\n\nWheelie was in a=\r\n standoff over wiht Tuscon, Tuscon seemingly ready to redn and rage about, =\r\nWheelie seeming to enjoy picking and baiting the larger (relatively) and bu=\r\nlkier Autobot.\n\nWheelie catcalled over at Tuscon, &quot;Talking about how angry =\r\nyou are.  Why not drive off and show off that car?  That&#39;s all you seem to =\r\nbe, talk talk talk, saying how you&#39;re so scary!  Well, where I come from, p=\r\neople do and don&#39;t say!  Those who say don&#39;t do, and they just all play!&quot;\n\n=\r\nAnd then over from the front of the room as pandemonium seemed to be ready =\r\nto break out, as Windlord left, and Leo PRime tried to get control, one of =\r\nthe few mechanoids that Wheelie respected to a degree, RODIMUS PRIME, spoke=\r\n up.  And Wheelie then lowered his weapon, &quot;As you ask, I shall do.  But I =\r\ndo it for him, not for you.&quot;  Glancing over at Tuscon.\n\nThen, at the commen=\r\nts from Night Shift and Straight Shot, Wheelie was egged on again, &quot;I would=\r\n say get bent, since you already seem to be, it&#39;s nothing new, just between=\r\n you and me.&quot;  And then at the tossing out of Ratchet, &quot;You say that name l=\r\nike it should make sense.  He&#39;s here in a sleep, so don&#39;t be dense.&quot; Meanin=\r\ng the Ark, &quot;By the time I was around, he was dead, word to the wise.  So th=\r\nreatening me with the name of someone passed along makes you silly, ineffec=\r\ntive guys.&quot;\n\nWheelie going on, then retreating into the back, &quot;You want som=\r\neone mad, you want someone angry, I&#39;ll give you Slag, for whom his name is =\r\na cuss word thrown out like candy!  He&#39;s not a very happy guy, and I see no=\r\nthing for why Ratchet should be brought up, oh my.&quot;\n\nThen going over to tak=\r\ne a seat in the corner, Wheelie glancing up at Leo PRime, and finally softe=\r\nning, &quot;I guess I owe you an apology. I&#39;m sorry.  With the cast of glitches =\r\non Earth, you have a cue to worry.  Looks like you&#39;ve got your work cut out=\r\n, if you&#39;re going to stay about.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
