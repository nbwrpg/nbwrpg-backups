As \nRDahl stated Decpeticons and Autobots were firing missiles at each \nother underwater without any problems that he stated. And as for \nphysically possible, are we forgeting that TF physics and human \nphysics are two entirely different things? And Yan who has \ncomplained? I mean really if players have that many complaints about \nsomething they should really have the guts to say something to the \nplayer so that they may be able to clear up any questioning stuff. \nInstead of going behind the players back and complaining without \nwanting any explanation. And Ive talked with a great many players who \nfeel that way too. The point of the second Infecticon base is to be \nheavily defended and hard to reach, because it is the most important. \n&gt; LN, the energy required to push a missile up from the bottom of the \nocean ot anywhere would probably be able to power Manhatton (yeah, I \nspelled it wrong, oh well) for several years. Having your base that \nfar down under is a tradeoff I guess. I toned your weapons list down \nwithout realizing the depth, but with all the complaints I&#39;ve been \ngetting I think a good tradeoff (and physically possible) would be to \nhave almost no defences since its that far down.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, LN, the council&#39;s been recieving complaints about you acting \nlike a council member. You&#39;ve been telling members what they can and \ncannot do, and you&#39;ve made quite alot of people&#39;s RPGing experience \nmuch worse. Please stop this instantly. The council has the job of \npoliceing the RPG, and we&#39;ll call a mode if we see it. Until such a \ntime when you are on the council, though, please refrain from \nattempting to moderate the RPG.\n\n\n\n"}}
