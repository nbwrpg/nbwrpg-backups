However these same fissures were also\n&gt; making=\r\n it difficult for the SHARKTICONS to advance across the rough\n&gt; and shaky t=\r\nerrain.\n&gt; \n&gt; VICE GRIP&#39;s attempt to collapse the floor was assisted by the\n=\r\n&gt; expanding cracks that were still stretching across it. Several\n&gt; SHARKTIC=\r\nONS fell into them and disappeared from view.\n&gt; \n&gt; However these SHARKTICON=\r\nS were not the ones of old from the days of\n&gt; UNICRON! They had been advanc=\r\ned and were slimmer and seemed to be a\n&gt; little more designed to fight, alt=\r\nhough not all that much more\n&gt; intelligent.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tfwiki.net/w2/image=\r\ns2/d/d4/ESharkticon.jpg\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nDINOBOT took the time over to =\r\nunleash his heavy power drill, going to charge over inot the midst of the S=\r\nHARKTICONS.  They might be dangerous over in numbers, but individually they=\r\n were not threats.  HOwever, thanks to the drilling, with luck he might ISO=\r\nLATE small pockets of them to eliminate groupings cluster by cluster.  Igno=\r\nring the brawling leaders for now - that was the battle of the leaders, not=\r\n his mission.\n\nWhat injuries he would take would hopefully be minor, and hi=\r\ns superior skill would allow him to take on pockets of sharkticons one at a=\r\n time!\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; &quot;Spread out!&quot; SKY SHADOW said as he and his FUZORS were do=\r\ning just\n&gt; that. &quot;These guys are idiots! they don&#39;t do well without leaders=\r\nhip.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The pits is empty and all the devils are here.&quot; There was laugh=\r\nter\n&gt; from SKYBYTE the leader of the SHARKTICONS as he stood as his soldier=\r\ns\n&gt; continued to pour out of the caves! &quot;Come my devils, rise! RISE!&quot; With\n=\r\n&gt; that he transformed into his shark mode and began to fly as did the\n&gt; SHA=\r\nRTICONS with him rising around the upper sides of the massive cave!\n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nth large, micro serrated teeth at least three launched themselves at\n&gt; DINO=\r\nBOT, coming at him with a menacing ferocity!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile RAT TRAP and QU=\r\nICKSTRIDE face their own enemies as each of\n&gt; them have two SHARKTICONS fly=\r\ning at them, their mouths open wide, the\n&gt; teeth ready to rend flesh, bone =\r\nand metal!\n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT AND VICEGRIP&gt;\n\nBut at this point, DINOBOT was in=\r\ntercepted then by the charging SHARKTICON, and his response oer was qutie b=\r\nrutal!  Metallidiko taught to do the most powerful blow when your enemy cou=\r\nld not resist it, so his large tail cannon swung around on his arm then to =\r\ntry and blast it over at point blank range in the faceplate!\n\nMeanwhile, VI=\r\nCE GRIP just went to transform now back to his robot mode, attempting to us=\r\ne his superior strength to try and pickl up one SHARKTICOn and then toss it=\r\n over at the rest like a bowling ball!\n&gt; \n&gt; VICEGRIP is also beset with SHA=\r\nRKTICONS of his own as they circled\n&gt; around to strike at him!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Do=\r\nn&#39;t forget, they are Sharkticons, individually they are push\n&gt; overs - alth=\r\nough there are a lot of them.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
