Did you hear the rules Atma? Now voting for yourself \nand i didn&#39;t mention Technosis&#39; name in the voting party. You have \none vote. Us five, you, me, Drillbit, Pseudo and Phobia are voting, \ncause we basically lead. No matter what KitKat says we have to \nrelieve her of command. I don&#39;t want to, but for the safety of the \ngroup we have to. My vote for Phobia stands. Pseudo, you vote for \nAtma. Drillbit, Atma, Phobia, whom do you vote for?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix\n\nBrix gazed at Ramulus.\n\n&quot;You want to put yourself inside Fliq? I don&#39;t know. I mean, when \nFliq and I were in my body, it changed to this. Your spark could \nchange Fliq&#39;s body, and with the damage who knowd if he could take \nit. But if it&#39;s the only way........Alright. He&#39;ll die anyway if we \ndon&#39;t. What do i do?&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________\nVulois\n\nVulois&#39; face was struck with happiness.\n\n&quot;Child....this theory could be great. How do you think the angels \nplaced this book here? Human history has not been recorded yet. Thery \nbarely exist. They must know time travel of some type. If they left \nthat secret with the book...who knows what we can do? What if we \nstopped Hell Beast from coming  to the planet? We could end this war, \nbefore it began? It&#39;s already a proven fact that organics were on \nCybertron. What if we went back and saved them? We could prevent the \nupcoming catastrophe. Sure, there could be conciquences, and before \nwe made any decision we would weigh it, but if we could learn it, it \nwould make our jobs a whole lot easier!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
