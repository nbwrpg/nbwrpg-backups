I promised Rodim=\r\nus Prime that if he needed me, I&#39;d be there, and before he ever fell into t=\r\nhe depths of no return, I&#39;d be sure that my hand was down there to reach hi=\r\ns and pull him up from the point of no return.  I will not back away from m=\r\ny promise to him.  I feel as if this is something that my extra power was m=\r\neant to do.

My \n&gt; &gt; spark has more t=\r\nhan enough power to transfuse energy from my body into \n&gt; &gt; his.  Not to wo=\r\nrry, I will not go off line.
