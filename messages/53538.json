Speaking of which, I \n&gt; ought to check on them.&quot;  The Rogue commander keys his comlink.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Devilcat to base, report!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hey boss, it&#39;s Fury.  They&#39;re just about finished down back.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Excellent, excellent.  I&#39;ve hammered out a treaty of sorts with the \n&gt; Maximals.  What&#39;s the Predacon base look like?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Like a tomb - nothing&#39;s happened except a few scouts going out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Probably means they&#39;re up to something.  If you see any movement, \n&gt; update me at once.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Right, boss!&quot;  Fury breaks the link.\n&gt; \n&gt; Devilcat looks at Yggdrasil.  &quot;Well, I suppose that answers your \n&gt; question.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: That could be a good idea. It will all depend on how the\n&gt; &gt; Tripreds want to act it out also, on their strategy. Can your tell \n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; what damages your ship suffers and how long it will be until it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; repaired? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;That will not be an issue once Rogue Star is repaired.&quot; Devilcat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; says confidently.  &quot;It may be smaller than a battlecruiser, but \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much faster and its armament and shields are roughly on a par \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Tripred ship.  If we can bring it into play, their firepower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage will be negated.  And its cloaking ability is quite \n&gt; useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for setting traps.&quot;  Devilcat smiles as an idea strikes \n&gt; him.  &quot;That \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be used to our advantage here as well.  If the enemy comes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; expecting the defense capabilities of one starship and they are \n&gt; met \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with two, it will make a mess of their attack plans.

In this case, The maximals could hold \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; line\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here while the Rogues go and destroy the remaining attackers at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base. The preds tend to strike with all forces, but I don&#39;t \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Tripreds. Besides, their ship seemed to be quite well \n&gt; defended.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would be very hard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cardhead649 &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;cardhead649@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I understand that the Tripreds are much more dangerous,&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Devilcat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; points out.  &quot;But harsh experience has taught me never to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; discount an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposing force, no matter how weak it may seem.  If we focus \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attention on the Tripredacus forces, Hydras is free to strike \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chooses.  And I know from doing it myself how devastating \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tactic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is when done properly.  A better plan would be to wait for \n&gt; one or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other to make a move, then counter it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: Alright, but remember I have to talk to you as \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil looked at Devilcat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yggdrasil: I don&#39;t want the Tripreds to take hold here, but \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hope \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; see why they are the real threat, not the Preds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen \n&gt; &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : : Rodimus Prime : :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus gets up, looking to the guests on the otherside \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desk.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus Prime: If you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to go deal \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pod\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.
