The \nreal\n&gt; one. Another person posted that characters are not allowed to die\n&gt; currently...he is utterly incorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is the role-playing 101 aspect. People are given the\n&gt; responsibility to judge how much damage they take...however as we&#39;ve \nseen\n&gt; some can&#39;t role-play their way out of a wet paper bag let alone \nresponsibly\n&gt; judge how much damage their character takes. When a bot does get \ndamaged\n&gt; what typically happens here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the list:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The enemy bot suddenly becomes cockeyed unable to hit the broad \nside of a\n&gt; barn even if he was a g1 and standing over it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The bot never gives chase to his prey. It always lets the long \ntime\n&gt; character slip away.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) A short stay (a few hours usually) in the CR chamber and any \ndamage is\n&gt; completely gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The character &quot;dies&quot; but faked his death coming back as an enemy\n&gt; infiltrator.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Character &quot;dies&quot; but an evil clone appears which after various \nmeeting\n&gt; with colleagues or &quot;loved ones&quot; turns good again. Personality \nreverts to\n&gt; pre-evil clone.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) Character &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn as a more powerful offspring. \nPersonality\n&gt; is hardly different.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) Character &quot;dies&quot; but the players 6 other characters cart it&#39;s \nblasted\n&gt; carcass back to a lab where they resurrect him.\n&gt; \n&gt; 8) Character &quot;dies&quot; replace with new bot same \npersonality...eventually\n&gt; people will forget you died and you can go back to your old form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since most will never let their &quot;favorite&quot; character(s) die, I mean \ntruly\n&gt; die, never come back like, there&#39;s really very little new plotlines \nyou can\n&gt; do with them without repeating rehashed already done ones. Take for \nexample\n&gt; the geotrons planing to attack the new cat faction....both factions \nwill\n&gt; survive, I doubt either player who controls the majority of bots in \neither\n&gt; faction is gonna let their characters get anywhere near killed.\n&gt; \n&gt; And what&#39;s to stop this from happening if a restart/sequel DOES \noccur? The\n&gt; role-playing by some will still stink, characters will still be \nincapable of\n&gt; dying and given another year or so all plotlines for THAT game will \nbe\n&gt; starting to repeat. While I still do believe a restart/sequel is in \norder I\n&gt; think the role-playing problem needs addressing first to stop a \nrepeat of\n&gt; what&#39;s happening to NBW.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;x_rauq_x&quot; &lt;x_rauq_x@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 5:57 AM\n&gt; Subject: All Read: Important\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My appologies, Narrator, I actually missed your original post.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I find that Neo Beast Wars has been dragged on for too long, and \nthe\n&gt; &gt; world is becoming clogged with bases among other things. Ideas are\n&gt; &gt; becoming exausted, if not completely exausted already. It seems to\n&gt; &gt; me that we are almost delaying the end of the rpg. If you&#39;ve \ncreated\n&gt; &gt; one storyline that you like, is it not fair to say that you can\n&gt; &gt; create another better one?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The idea of creating a sequel to the rpg is one that I would agree\n&gt; &gt; with. That would require several things to happen:\n&gt; &gt; 1) Changing the name of the RPG.\n&gt; &gt; 2) Appropriate changes to the website.\n&gt; &gt; 3) A means to store all of everyone&#39;s previous characters (don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know about everyone else, but I don&#39;t want to lose the bio&#39;s of \nall\n&gt; &gt; my characters).\n&gt; &gt; 4) New story (i have an idea, not necessarily for the story, but \nfor\n&gt; &gt; how we could create the story).\n&gt; &gt; 5) A catalyst to start us all off (the story should provide that).\n&gt; &gt; 6) Implementation of new rules, some of which have been, and are\n&gt; &gt; being, discussed in the login messageboard.\n&gt; &gt; 7) other stuff that could be written if I wasn&#39;t so tired.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All in all, since there are more people voting anti-restart that \nI&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; anticpated, I&#39;ll ask everyone a perhaps fate deciding question:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would it be favourable to have a sequel instead of a restart?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m agree with Soulstice, restart isn&#39;t good idea. All have good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; story-lines and good characters. Perhaps the best would be\n&gt; &gt; eliminate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less importat characters of our story-line (every rpgers could\n&gt; &gt; choice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at whom wants eliminate) and elimitante factions where are \nmember\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t posting and join factions that have few characters\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That other way than restart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Narrator&quot; &lt;thecode@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I at first wasn&#39;t sure if I could vote in this one. Not\n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am I seemingly not too much an important part of this RPG, \ndespite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the general current lack of members, and the fact that I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for getting close to 2 years, but also I am not involved in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restart. I have very few characters. Characters that, if the RPG\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restarted, will still be together (Insecticons, specifically), \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it wouldn&#39;t harm me to vote yes. However, I don&#39;t \nthink\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could vote yes, because I am apposed to restarting the RPG. I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided to vote no. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to end the\n&gt; &gt; saga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Neo Beast Wars. It&#39;s a great saga that we&#39;ve worked hard over\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years to keep going. I don&#39;t think that we could suddenly \npretend\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never happened, I think it&#39;s impossible. Maybe if we ended it \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started the sequel, I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but otherwise, my\n&gt; &gt; vote\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no.
