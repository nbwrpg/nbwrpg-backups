It frightened her.  She \nfelt like she had lost her connection to Lunarpine.  She couldn&#39;t \nfeel his presence like she had before. That scared her beyond words.  \nShe felt alone now. Alone and helpless to do anything.  She prayed to \nthe Matrix that Lunarpine was alright.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, cyberwolf4@p... wrote:\n&gt; Lunarpine nearly lost control when he heard the mention of Shadow \n&gt; Wings name. He&#39;d already gone through the pain of failing her now \n&gt; this madbot&#39;s reminding him. He punched the front of his \ncylindrical \n&gt; (I like big words) prison trying to escape. His hand ached as it \n&gt; struck the immovable surface. He glanced down at the hand. It was \nthe \n&gt; hand that he used to strike with but it wasn&#39;t his. Lunarpine&#39;s \n&gt; senses flooded with the realization of what had happened in his \n&gt; stasis lock. Not only did he get experimented on, he&#39;d switched \n&gt; bodies which meant he no longer carried Shadow Wings Spark with \n&gt; him. &quot;You monster&quot; he howled ferociously glaring at the bot who&#39;d \n&gt; changed him.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So it finally sunk through your thick skull.&quot; Veratis \nanswered &quot;But \n&gt; you still haven&#39;t answered my question.&quot; Veratis turned his back to \n&gt; Lunarpine as if to taunt him &quot;I&#39;ll wager a guess that you two were \n&gt; close, and that hers is the second spark in your old body. Am I \n&gt; right?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunarpine didn&#39;t have to answer, Veratis had pieced together the \n&gt; equation nicely and both of them knew it. &quot;Yes, You&#39;re right she \nwas \n&gt; dear to me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Good now that you&#39;re being so talkative you may ask a question.&quot; \n&gt; Veratis was back to his kind self showing courtesy even with \n&gt; Lunarpine his prisoner instead of his guest.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where&#39;s my old body?&quot; Lunarpine asked, without power her Spark \nwould \n&gt; surely leave the body.\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s been...&quot;Veratis paused trying to find the right words &quot;Taken \n&gt; care of.&quot; There was no easy way to tell someone that thier old body \n&gt; was chopped up into samples.&quot;But I placed the other spark in a safe \n&gt; place. I can help you my friend but you have to tell me exactly \nwhat \n&gt; I ask for.&quot; Again he had Lunarpines hands tied.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
